"10.12942/lrr-2003-2"], "abstract": ["  Physics faculty consider the photoelectric effect important, but many\nerroneously believe it is easy for students to understand. We have developed\ncurriculum on this topic including an interactive computer simulation,\ninteractive lectures with peer instruction, and conceptual and mathematical\nhomework problems. Our curriculum addresses established student difficulties\nand is designed to achieve two learning goals, for students to be able to (1)\ncorrectly predict the results of photoelectric effect experiments, and (2)\ndescribe how these results lead to the photon model of light. We designed two\nexam questions to test these learning goals. Our instruction leads to better\nstudent mastery of the first goal than either traditional instruction or\nprevious reformed instruction, with approximately 85% of students correctly\npredicting the results of changes to the experimental conditions. On the\nquestion designed to test the second goal, most students are able to correctly\nstate both the observations made in the photoelectric effect experiment and the\ninferences that can be made from these observations, but are less successful in\ndrawing a clear logical connection between the observations and inferences.\nThis is likely a symptom of a more general lack of the reasoning skills to\nlogically draw inferences from observations.\n", "  Global linear stability analysis of a self-similar solution describing the\ninteraction of a relativistic shell with an ambient medium is performed. The\nsolution is shown to be unstable to convective Rayleigh-Taylor modes having\nangular scales smaller than the causality scale. Longer wavelength modes are\nstable and decay with time. For modes of sufficiently large spherical harmonic\ndegree $l$ the dimensionless growth rate scales as $\\sqrt{l/\\Gamma}$, where\n$\\Gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the shell. The instability commences at the\ncontact interface separating the shocked eject a and shocked ambient gas and\npropagates to the shocks. The reverse shock front responds promptly to the in\nstability and exhibits rapidly growing distortions at early times. Propagation\nto the forward shock is slower, and it is anticipated that the region near the\ncontact will become fully turbulent before the instability is communicated to\nthe forward shock. The non-universality of the Blandford-McKee blast wave\nsolution suggests that turbulence generated by the instability in the shocked\nambient medium may decay slowly with time and may be the origin of magnetic\nfields over a long portion of the blast wave evolution. It is also speculated\nthat the instability may affect the emission from the shocked ejecta in the\nearly post-prompt phase of GRBs.\n", "  We present a solution to the problem of broadband decoupling of a coupled\nhomonuclear two-spin system. We describe a pulse sequence that creates an\neffective field perpendicular to the coupling interaction with a magnitude\npropotional to the chemical shift of the spins over a broad range of chemical\nshifts. When the chemical shift difference as imprinted on the perpendicular\nfield is greater than the coupling between the spins, we get effective\ndecoupling. The pulse sequence may be useful in various NMR applications.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the combination of first-order\nquadrupole-quadrupole and second-order dipole-dipole effects on the long-range\nelectrostatic interactions between a ground-state homonuclear alkali-metal\ndimer and an excited alkali-metal atom. As the electrostatic energy is\ncomparable to the dimer rotational structure, we develop a general description\nof the long-range interactions which allows for couplings between the dimer\nrotational levels. The resulting adiabatic potential energy curves, which\nexhibit avoided crossings, cannot be expanded on the usual $1/R^{n}$ series. We\nstudy in details the breakdown of this approximation in the particular case\nCs$_{2}+$Cs. Our results are found promising in the prospect of accomplishing\nthe photoassociation of ultracold trimers.\n", "  We study topological string amplitudes for the local half K3 surface. We\ndevelop a method of computing higher-genus amplitudes along the lines of the\ndirect integration formalism, making full use of the Seiberg-Witten curve\nexpressed in terms of modular forms and E_8-invariant Jacobi forms. The\nSeiberg-Witten curve was constructed previously for the low-energy effective\ntheory of the non-critical E-string theory in R^4 x T^2. We clarify how the\namplitudes are written as polynomials in a finite number of generators\nexpressed in terms of the Seiberg-Witten curve. We determine the coefficients\nof the polynomials by solving the holomorphic anomaly equation and the gap\ncondition, and construct the amplitudes explicitly up to genus three. The\nresults encompass topological string amplitudes for all local del Pezzo\nsurfaces.\n", "  We investigate non-trivial localized solutions of the condensate in a\n(2+1)-dimensional D-wave holographic superconductor model in the presence of a\nbackground magnetic field. The calculation is done in the context of the\n(3+1)-dimensional dual gravity theory of a charged massive spin-2 field in an\nAdS black hole background. By using numeric techniques, we find both vortex and\ndroplet solutions. These solutions are important for studying the full phase\ndiagram of D-wave superconductors.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a Kerr-like wormhole supported by phantom\nmatter, which is an exact solution of the Einstein-phantom field equations. It\nis shown that the solution has a naked ring singularity which is unreachable to\nnull geodesics falling freely from the outside. Similarly to Roger Penrose's\ncosmic censorship, that states that all naked singularities in the Universe\nmust be protected by event horizons, here we conjecture from our results that a\nnaked singularity can also be fully protected by the intrinsic properties of a\nwormhole's throat.\n", "  We report the results of Faraday rotation measurements of 23 background radio\nsources whose lines of sight pass through or close to the Rosette Nebula. The\nRosette Nebula is an excellent candidate for studies of super bubbles\nassociated with young star clusters. We made linear polarization measurements\nwith the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at frequencies of 4.4GHz,\n4.9GHz, and 7.7GHz. We are able to establish a background rotation measure in\nthis part of the sky due to the Galaxy of +147 rad m^-2. Sources whose lines of\nsight pass through the nebula have an excess rotation measure of 50-750 rad\nm^-2, which we attribute to the plasma shell of the Rosette Nebula. We consider\ntwo simple plasma shell models and how they reproduce the magnitude and sign of\nthe rotation measure, and its dependence on distance from the center of the\nnebula. These two models represent different modes of interaction of the\nRosette Nebula star cluster with the surrounding interstellar medium. Both can\nreproduce the magnitude and spatial extent of the rotation measure enhancement,\ngiven plausible free parameters. We contend that the model based on a stellar\nbubble more closely reproduces the observed dependence of rotation measure on\ndistance from the center of the nebula.\n", "  We consider the gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous\nmatter distribution consisting of a Weyssenhoff fluid in the presence of a\nnegative cosmological constant. Our aim is to investigate the effects of\ntorsion and spin averaged terms on the final outcome of the collapse. For a\nspecific interior spacetime setup, namely the homogeneous and isotropic FLRW\nmetric, we obtain two classes of solutions to the field equations where\ndepending on the relation between spin source parameters, $(i)$ the collapse\nprocedure culminates in a spacetime singularity or $(ii)$ it is replaced by a\nnon-singular bounce. We show that, under certain conditions, for a specific\nsubset of the former solutions, the formation of trapped surfaces is prevented\nand thus the resulted singularity could be naked. The curvature singularity\nthat forms could be gravitationally strong in the sense of Tipler. Our\nnumerical analysis for the latter solutions shows that the collapsing dynamical\nprocess experiences four phases, so that two of which occur at the pre-bounce\nand the other two at post-bounce regimes. We further observe that there can be\nfound a minimum radius for the apparent horizon curve, such that the main\noutcome of which is that there exists an upper bound for the size of the\ncollapsing body, below which no horizon forms throughout the whole scenario.\n", "  In this paper, we search for accelerating power-law and ekpyrotic solutions\nin heterotic string theory with NS-NS fluxes compactified on half-flat and\ngeneralized half-flat manifolds. We restrict our searches to the STZ sector of\nthe theory. We also considered linear order $\\alpha'$ corrections for the\nhalf-flat case. The power-law solutions that we find are neither accelerating\nnor ekpyrotic in any of the models.\n", "  We report an inductive process that allows for a sequential construction of\npolynomial invariants of state coefficients for multipartite quantum states.\nThe starting point can be a physically meaningful invariant of a smaller part\nof the system. The process is applied to construct a chain of invariants that\nquantify GHZ state like non-local N-way correlations in an N qubit pure state\nand the sum of N-way and (N-1)-way correlations. Analytic expressions for four\nand three-way correlation quantifiers for four qubits, as well as, five-way and\nfour-way correlation quantifiers for a five qubit pure state are given.\n", "  Using an algebraic condition of vanishing discriminant for multiple roots of\nfourth degree polynomials we derive an analytical expression of a shadow size\nas a function of a charge in the Reissner -- Nordstr\\\"om (RN) metric\n\\cite{Reissner_16,Nordstrom_18}. We consider shadows for negative tidal charges\nand charges corresponding to naked singularities $q=\\mathcal{Q}^2/M^2 > 1$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{Q}$ and $M$ are black hole charge and mass, respectively, with\nthe derived expression. An introduction of a negative tidal charge $q$ can\ndescribe black hole solutions in theories with extra dimensions, so following\nthe approach we consider an opportunity to extend RN metric to negative\n$\\mathcal{Q}^2$, while for the standard RN metric $\\mathcal{Q}^2$ is always\nnon-negative. We found that for $q > 9/8$ black hole shadows disappear.\nSignificant tidal charges $q=-6.4$ (suggested by Bin-Nun (2010)) are not\nconsistent with observations of a minimal spot size at the Galactic Center\nobserved in mm-band, moreover, these observations demonstrate that a Reissner\n-- Nordstr\\\"om black hole with a significant charge $q \\approx 1$ provides a\nbetter fit of recent observational data for the black hole at the Galactic\nCenter in comparison with the Schwarzschild black hole.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the energy distribution E(r) associated with a\nstatic spherically symmetric non-singular phantom black hole metric in\nEinstein's prescription in general relativity. As required for Einstein\nenergy-momentum complex, we perform calculations in quasi-Cartesian\ncoordinates. We also calculate momentum components and get zero values as\nexpected from the geometry of the metric.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the twisted algebra of the fermionic\noscillators associated with Dirac field defined in $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nspace-time. Starting from $\\kappa$-deformed Dirac theory, which is invariant\nunder the undeformed $\\kappa$-Poincare algebra, using the twisted flip\noperator, we derive the deformed algebra of the creation and annihilation\noperators corresponding to the Dirac field quanta in $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nspace-time. In the limit $a\\rightarrow 0$, the deformed algebra reduces to the\ncommutative result.\n", "  We study local-realistic inequalities, Bell-type inequalities, for bipartite\npure states of finite dimensional quantum systems -- qudits. There are a number\nof proposed Bell-type inequalities for such systems. Our interest is in\nrelating the value of Bell-type inequality function with a measure of\nentanglement. Interestingly, we find that one of these inequalities, the\nSon-Lee-Kim inequality, can be used to measure entanglement of a pure bipartite\nqudit state and a class of mixed two-qudit states. Unlike the majority of\nearlier schemes in this direction, where number of observables needed to\ncharacterize the entanglement increases with the dimension of the subsystems,\nthis method needs only four observables. We also discuss the experimental\nfeasibility of this scheme. It turns out that current experimental set ups can\nbe used to measure the entanglement using our scheme.\n", "  We show that two consecutive Universes with positive cosmological constants\nfilled with perfect fluids and conformal to the positive-spatial-curvature FLRW\nmetric by an analytic conformal transformation have the following features\nimplied by the Einstein equations: a) the fluids can only belong to 4 classes\n(radiation, dust and two other classes with negative pressures corresponding to\na gas of strings and a gas of domain walls), b) the field equations on both\nsides of the future/eternity hypersurface exhibit certain duality with the\nEinstein Universe at the background, and c) both eons (one at the end, and the\nother at the beginning) are almost critical, so that the future eon is\ndominated by radiation and resembles the beginning of our Universe.\n", "  By mapping the Hamiltonians of the two-mode and 2-photon Rabi models to\ndifferential operators in suitable Hilbert spaces of entire functions, we prove\nthat the two models possess entire and normalizable wavefunctions in the\nBargmann-Hilbert spaces only if the frequency $\\omega$ and coupling strength\n$g$ satisfy certain constraints. This is in sharp contrast to the quantum Rabi\nmodel for which entire wavefunctions always exist. For model parameters\nfulfilling the aforesaid constraints we determine transcendental equations\nwhose roots give the regular energy eigenvalues of the models. Furthermore, we\nshow that for $k\\geq 3$ the $k$-photon Rabi model does not possess\nwavefunctions which are elements of the Bargmann-Hilbert space for all\nnon-trivial model parameters. This implies that the $k\\geq 3$ case is not\ndiagonalizable, unlike its RWA cousin, the $k$-photon Jaynes-Cummings model\nwhich can be completely diagonalized for all $k$.\n", "  A model is developed with the aim of analyzing interacting superparamagnets.\nModel is built from magnetic dipolar interaction and demagnetizing mean field\nconcepts. A useful expression for effective demagnetizing factors is achieved,\nwhich allows for the analysis of non uniform spatial distributions of\nnanoparticles. This expression is a function of demagnetizing factors\nassociated with specimen and clusters shapes, and of the mean distances between\nnear neighbor nanoparticles and between clusters, relative to the\ncharacteristic sizes of each of these two types of objects, respectively. It\nexplains effects of magnetic dipolar interactions such as the observation of\napparent nanoparticle magnetic-moments smaller than real ones. It is shown that\nby performing a minimum set of experimental determinations, model application\nallows retrieval of intrinsic properties, like magnetic moment and\nsusceptibility in the absence of interactions. It also permits the estimation\nof mean interparticle and intercluster relative distances, and of demagnetizing\nfactors associated with clusters shape. An expression for magnetic dipolar\nenergy per nanoparticle is also derived. Model experimental test was performed\nby analysis of results reported in the literature and of original results. They\ncorrespond to magnetite particles dispersed in PEGDA-600 polymer, and in PVA\nferrogels. Experimental results display different magnetic response when prism\nshaped specimens are measured along principal directions. Intrinsic properties\nand structural information were retrieved from the analysis, in excellent\nagreement with information obtained from FESEM images. In the studied samples\nnanoparticles were found to be in close contact to each other within almost\nrandomly oriented clusters. Intercluster mean relative-distance was found to\nvary between 2.2 and 7.5, depending on particles volume fraction.\n", "  In this paper, we will analyse the cosmological models in Einstein-aether\ngravity, which is a modified theory of gravity in which a time-like vector\nfield breaks the Lorentz symmetry. We will use this formalism to analyse\ndifferent cosmological models with different behavior of the scale factor. In\nthis analysis, we will use a certain functional dependence of the dark energy\non the Hubble parameter. It will be demonstrated that the aether vector field\nhas a non-trivial effect on these cosmological models. We will also perform the\n\\emph{Om} diagnostic in Einstein-aether gravity. Thus, we will fit parameters\nof the cosmological models using recent observational data.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor stars are uniquely informative on the nature of massive\nPopulation III stars. Modulo a few elements that vary with stellar evolution,\nthe present-day photospheric abundances observed in extremely metal-poor stars\nare representative of their natal gas cloud composition. For this reason, the\nchemistry of extremely metal-poor stars closely reflects the nucleosynthetic\nyields of supernovae from massive Population III stars. Here we collate\ndetailed abundances of 53 extremely metal-poor stars from the literature and\ninfer the masses of their Population III progenitors. We fit a simple initial\nmass function to a subset of 29 of theinferred Population III star masses, and\nfind that the mass distribution is well-represented by a power law IMF with\nexponent $\\alpha = 2.35^{+0.29}_{-0.24}$. The inferred maximum progenitor mass\nfor supernovae from massive Population III stars is $M_{\\rm{max}} =\n87^{+13}_{-33}$ M$_\\odot$, and we find no evidence in our sample for a\ncontribution from stars with masses above $\\sim$120 M$_\\odot$. The minimum mass\nis strongly consistent with the theoretical lower mass limit for Population III\nsupernovae. We conclude that the IMF for massive Population III stars is\nconsistent with the initial mass function of present-day massive stars and\nthere may well have formed stars much below the supernova mass limit that could\nhave survived to the present day.\n", "  We numerically generate the six-dimensional landscape of D3-brane inflation\nand identify patches of eternal inflation near sufficiently flat inflection\npoints of the potential. We show that reasonable measures that select patches\nof eternal inflation in the landscape yield sharp predictions for the spectral\nproperties of primordial perturbations on observable scales. These include a\nscalar tilt of .936, a running of the scalar tilt -.00103, undetectably small\ntensors and non-Gaussianity, and no observable spatial curvature. Our results\nexplicitly demonstrate that precision cosmology probes the combination of the\nstatistical properties of the string landscape and the measure implied by the\nuniverse's quantum state.\n", "  We study the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous time-dependent scalar\nfield that, besides its coupling to curvature, it is also kinematically coupled\nto the Einstein tensor. This coupling is a part of the Horndeski theory and we\ninvestigate its effect on the collapsing process. We find that the time\nrequired for the scalar field to collapse depends on the value of the\nderivative coupling and the singularity is protected by a horizon. Matching the\ninternal solution with an external Schwarzschild- AdS metric we show that a\nblack hole is formed, while the weak energy condition is satisfied during the\ncollapsing process. The scalar field takes on a finite value at the\nsingularity.\n", "  In the present work we discuss inter-species entanglement in Bose-Bose\nmixtures trapped in optical lattices. This work is motivated by the observation\nthat, in the presence of a second component, the Mott-insulator lobe shifts\n{\\em{differently}} on the hole- and particle-side with respect to the Mott lobe\nof the single species system (Phys. Rev. A 82, 021601, Laser Phys. 21, 1443).\nWe use perturbation theory, formulated in a Hilbert space decomposed by means\nof lattice symmetries, in order to show that the nonuniform shift of the Mott\nlobe is a consequence of an inter-species entanglement which differs in the\nlowest excited states to remove and add a particle. Our results indicate that\ninter-species entanglement in mixtures can provide a new perspective in\nunderstanding quantum phase transitions. To validate our approach, we compare\nour results from perturbation theory with quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  This paper describes the first data release (DR1) of the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (VUDS). The DR1 includes all low-resolution spectroscopic data obtained\nin 276.9 arcmin2 of the CANDELS-COSMOS and CANDELS-ECFDS survey areas,\nincluding accurate spectroscopic redshifts z_spec and individual spectra\nobtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT. A total of 698 objects have a measured\nredshift, with 677 galaxies, two type-I AGN and a small number of 19\ncontaminating stars. The targets of the spectroscopic survey are selected\nprimarily on the basis of their photometric redshifts to ensure a broad\npopulation coverage. About 500 galaxies have z_spec>2, 48 with z_spec>4, and\nthe highest reliable redshifts reach beyond z_spec=6. This dataset\napproximately doubles the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at\nz>3 in these fields. We discuss the general properties of the sample in terms\nof the spectroscopic redshift distribution, the distribution of Lyman-alpha\nequivalent widths, and physical properties including stellar masses M_star and\nstar formation rates (SFR) derived from spectral energy distribution fitting\nwith the knowledge of z_spec. We highlight the properties of the most massive\nstar-forming galaxies, noting the large range in spectral properties, with\nLyman-alpha in emission or in absorption, and in imaging properties with\ncompact, multi-component or pair morphologies. We present the catalogue\ndatabase and data products. All data are publicly available and can be\nretrieved from a dedicated query-based database available at\nhttp://cesam.lam.fr/vuds.\n", "  Data of six flybys, those of Galileo I, Galileo II, NEAR, Cassini, Rosetta\nand Messenger were reported by Anderson et al \\citep{Anderson}. Four of them:\nGalileo I, NEAR, Rosetta and Messenger gain Newtonian energy during the flyby\ntransfer, while Galileo II and Cassini lose energy. This is, in both cases, a\nsurprising anomaly since Newtonian forces derive from a potential and they are,\ntherefore, conservative. We show here that the gravitational field of a\nrotating planet as derived from a new model introduces a non conservative force\nthat gives a partial, but in our opinion satisfactory, explanation of these\nanomalies and suggests a correlation between the sign of the anomaly and the\nsign of the azimuthal velocity at perigee.\n", "  In the standard framework of thermodynamics the work produced or consumed in\na process is a random variable whose average value is bounded by the change in\nthe free energy of the system. This work is calculated without regard for the\nsize of its fluctuations. We find that in some processes, such as reversible\ncooling, the fluctuations of the work can diverge. Small or fragile thermal\nmachines may be unable to cope with large fluctuations. Hence, with the present\nfocus on nano- scale thermodynamics, we analyse how thermodynamic efficiency\nrates are modified when the size of the fluctuations around the average is\nrestricted. We quantify the work content and work of formation of any state\nwhen the work fluctuations are bounded by a given amount c. By varying c we\ninterpolate between the standard free energy c = infinity and the min-free\nenergy c = 0, defined in the context of single-shot thermodynamics. We derive\nfundamental relations between average work and its fluctuations, and explore\nthe emergence of irreversibility and partial order on state transformations\nwhen bounding fluctuations. We also study the efficiency a single qubit thermal\nengine model with constrained fluctuations, and derive the corrections to the\nCarnot efficiency.\n", "  Living cells display a remarkable capacity to compartmentalize their\nfunctional biochemistry. A particularly fascinating example is the cell\nnucleus. Exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and the surrounding\ncytoplasm does not involve traversing a lipid bilayer membrane. Instead, large\nprotein channels known as nuclear pores cross the nuclear envelope and regulate\nthe passage of other proteins and RNA molecules. Beyond simply gating\ndiffusion, the system of nuclear pores and associated transport receptors is\nable to generate substantial concentration gradients, at the energetic expense\nof guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. In contrast to conventional\napproaches to demixing such as reverse osmosis or dialysis, the biological\nsystem operates continuously, without application of cyclic changes in pressure\nor solvent exchange. Abstracting the biological paradigm, we examine this\ntransport system as a thermodynamic machine of solution demixing. Building on\nthe construct of free energy transduction and biochemical kinetics, we find\nconditions for stable operation and optimization of the concentration gradients\nas a function of dissipation in the form of entropy production.\n", "  We report perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the half-metallic\nferromagnetic Heusler alloy Co$_2$Fe$_{0.4}$Mn$_{0.6}$Si (CFMS) in a\nMgO/CFMS/Pd trilayer stack. PMA is found for CFMS thicknesses between 1 and 2\nnm, with a magnetic anisotropy energy density of $K_U = 1.5\\times 10^6$\nerg/cm$^3$ for t$_{\\tiny \\textrm{CFMS}} = 1.5$ nm. Both the MgO and Pd layer\nare necessary to induce the PMA. We measure a tunable anomalous Hall effect,\nwhere its sign and magnitude vary with both the CFMS and Pd thickness.\n", "  We study the fragmentation of the nearest high line-mass filament, the\nintegral shaped filament (ISF, line-mass $\\sim$ 400 M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-1}$) in the\nOrion A molecular cloud. We have observed a 1.6 pc long section of the ISF with\nthe Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 3 mm continuum\nemission, at a resolution of $\\sim$3\" (1 200 AU). We identify from the region\n43 dense cores with masses about a solar mass. 60% of the ALMA cores are\nprotostellar and 40\\% are starless. The nearest neighbour separations of the\ncores do not show a preferred fragmentation scale; the frequency of short\nseparations increases down to 1 200 AU. We apply a two-point correlation\nanalysis on the dense core separations and show that the ALMA cores are\nsignificantly grouped at separations below $\\sim$17 000 AU and strongly grouped\nbelow $\\sim$6 000 AU. The protostellar and starless cores are grouped\ndifferently: only the starless cores group strongly below $\\sim$6 000 AU. In\naddition, the spatial distribution of the cores indicates periodic grouping of\nthe cores into groups of $\\sim$30 000 AU in size, separated by $\\sim$50 000 AU.\nThe groups coincide with dust column density peaks detected by Herschel. These\nresults show hierarchical, two-mode fragmentation in which the maternal\nfilament periodically fragments into groups of dense cores. Critically, our\nresults indicate that the fragmentation models for lower line-mass filaments\n($\\sim$ 16 M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-1}$) fail to capture the observed properties of the\nISF. We also find that the protostars identified with Spitzer and Herschel in\nthe ISF are grouped at separations below $\\sim$17 000 AU. In contrast, young\nstars with disks do not show significant grouping. This suggests that the\ngrouping of dense cores is partially retained over the protostar lifetime, but\nnot over the lifetime of stars with disks.\n", "  Correct identification of the true gauge symmetry of General Relativity being\n3d spatial diffeomorphism invariant(3dDI) (not the conventional infinite tensor\nproduct group with principle fibre bundle structure), together with intrinsic\ntime extracted from clean decomposition of the canonical structure yields a\nself-consistent theory of quantum gravity. A new set of fundamental commutation\nrelations is also presented. The basic variables are the eight components of\nthe unimodular part of the spatial dreibein and eight SU(3) generators which\ncorrespond to Klauder's momentric variables that characterize a free theory of\nquantum gravity. The commutation relations are not canonical, but have well\ndefined group theoretical meanings. All fundamental entities are dimensionless;\nand the quantum wave functionals are preferentially in the dreibein\nrepresentation. The successful quantum theory of gravity involves only broad\nspectrum of knowledge and deep insights but no exotic idea.\n", "  We report a theoretical study of electron transport along helical molecules\nunder an external electric field, which is perpendicular to the helix axis of\nthe molecule. Our results reveal that the topological states could appear in\nsingle-helical molecule and double-stranded DNA in the presence of the\nperpendicular electric field. And these topological states guarantee adiabatic\ncharge pumping across the helical molecules by rotating the electric field in\nthe transverse plane and the pumped current at zero bias voltage is quantized.\nIn addition, the quantized current constitutes multiple plateaus by scanning\nthe Fermi energy as well as the bias voltage, and hold for various model\nparameters, since they are topologically protected against perturbations. These\nresults could motivate further experimental and theoretical studies in the\nelectron transport through helical molecules, and pave the way to detect\ntopological states and quantized current in the biological systems.\n", "  We calculate the inclusive spectra of secondaries produced in soft (minimum\nbias) p+Pb collisions in the framework of Quark-Gluon String Model at LHC\nenergy, by taking into account the inelastic screening corrections (percolation\neffects). The role of these effects is expected to be very large at the very\nhigh energies, and they should decrease the spectra more than 2 times in the\nmidrapidity region at sqrt(s)_(NN) = 5 TeV. The experimental data confirm such\na picture, which means that the nuclear screening effects are connected with\nthe Pomeron interaction rather than with the interactions of the produced\nsecondary particles in the final state.\n", "  We have directly detected millimeter wave (mm-wave) free space superradiant\nemission from Rydberg states ($n \\sim 30$) of barium atoms in a single shot. We\ntrigger the cooperative effects with a weak initial pulse and detect with\nsingle-shot sensitivity and 20 ps time resolution, which allows measurement and\nshot-by-shot analysis of the distribution of decay rates, time delays, and\ntime-dependent frequency shifts. Cooperative line shifts and decay rates are\nobserved that exceed values that would correspond to the Doppler width of 250\nkHz by a factor of 20 and the spontaneous emission rate of 50 Hz by a factor of\n$10^5$. The initial superradiant output pulse is followed by evolution of the\nradiation-coupled many-body system toward complex long-lasting emission modes.\nA comparison to a mean-field theory is presented which reproduces the\nquantitative time-domain results, but fails to account for either the\nfrequency-domain observations or the long-lived features.\n", "  We consider the impact of neutral-current (NC) non-standard neutrino\ninteractions (NSI) on the determination of the neutrino mass ordering. We show\nthat in presence of NSI there is an exact degeneracy which makes it impossible\nto determine the neutrino mass ordering and the octant of the solar mixing\nangle $\\theta_{12}$ at oscillation experiments. The degeneracy holds at the\nprobability level and for arbitrary matter density profiles, and hence, solar,\natmospheric, reactor, and accelerator neutrino experiments are affected\nsimultaneously. The degeneracy requires order-one corrections from NSI to the\nNC neutrino--quark interaction and can be tested in neutrino--nucleus NC\nscattering experiments.\n", "  In a recent work, mean-field analysis and computer simulations were employed\nto analyze critical self-organization in networks of excitable cellular\nautomata where randomly chosen synapses in the network were depressed after\neach spike (the so-called annealed dynamics). Calculations agree with\nsimulations of the annealed version, showing that the nominal \\textit{branching\nratio\\/} $\\sigma$ converges to unity in the thermodynamic limit, as expected of\na self-organized critical system. However, the question remains whether the\nsame results apply to the biological case where only the synapses of firing\nneurons are depressed (the so-called quenched dynamics). We show that\nsimulations of the quenched model yield significant deviations from $\\sigma=1$\ndue to spatial correlations. However, the model is shown to be critical, as the\nlargest eigenvalue of the synaptic matrix approaches unity in the thermodynamic\nlimit, that is, $\\lambda_c = 1$ . We also study the finite size effects near\nthe critical state as a function of the parameters of the synaptic dynamics.\n", "  The interaction of charged particles and photons with intense electromagnetic\nfields gives rise to multi-photon Compton and Breit-Wheeler processes. These\nare usually described in the framework of the external field approximation,\nwhere the electromagnetic field is assumed to have infinite energy. However,\nthe multi-photon nature of these processes implies the absorption of a\nsignificant number of photons, which scales as the external field amplitude\ncubed. As a result, the interaction of a highly charged electron bunch with an\nintense laser pulse can lead to significant depletion of the laser pulse\nenergy, thus rendering the external field approximation invalid. We provide\nrelevant estimates for this depletion and find it to become important in the\ninteraction between fields of amplitude $a_0 \\sim 10^3$ and electron bunches\nwith charges of the order of 10 nC.\n", "  We perform a sudden quench on the Haldane model with long range interactions,\nmore specifically generalising to the next to next nearest neighbour hopping,\nreferred to as the $N3$ model in our work. Such a model possesses both\nisotropic and multiple anisotropic (satellite) Dirac points which lead to a\nrich topological phase diagram consisting of phases with higher Chern number\n($C$). Quenches between the topological and the non-topological phases of such\nan infinite system probe the effect of the presence of the anisotropic Dirac\npoints on the non-equilibrium response of the topological system.\nInterestingly, the Chern number remains the same before and after the quench\nfor both the quenching protocols, even when the quench of the system is carried\nout between two different topological phases. {However, for a finite system, we\nestablish that the initial edge current asymptotically decays to zero when the\nsystem is quenched to the non-topological phase although the Chern number for\nthe corresponding periodically wrapped system remains unaltered; what is\nremarkable is that when the Hamiltonian is quenched from $|C|=2$ phase to the\nnon-topological phase the edge current associated with the inner channel decays\nat a faster rate than the outer channel resembling a situation in which the\nsystem passes through the phase with $|C|=1$ before ending up in the phase\n$C=0$.\n", "  In this work, we present an effective field theory to describe a\ntwo-component Fermi gas near a $d$-wave interaction resonance. The effective\nfield theory is renormalizable by matching with the low energy $d$-wave\nscattering phase shift. Based on the effective field theory, we derive\nuniversal properties of the Fermi gas by the operator product expansion method.\nWe find that beyond the contacts defined by adiabatic theorems, the asymptotic\nexpressions of the momentum distribution and the Raman spectroscopy involve two\nextra contacts which provide additional information of correlations of the\nsystem. Our formalism sets the stage for further explorations of many-body\neffects in a $d$-wave resonant Fermi gas. Finally we generalise our effective\nfield theory for interaction resonances of arbitrary higher partial waves.\n", "  Phase separation and coarsening is a phenomenon commonly seen in binary\nphysical and chemical systems that occur in nature. Often times, thermal\nfluctuations, modeled as stochastic noise, are present in the system and the\nphase segregation process occurs on a surface. In this work, the segregation\nprocess is modeled via the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook model, which is a fourth-order\nparabolic stochastic system. Coarsening is analyzed on two sample surfaces: a\nunit sphere and a dumbbell using a variety and a statistical analysis of the\ngrowth rate is performed. The influence of noise level and mobility is also\ninvestigated. It is also shown that a log-normal distribution fits the results\nwell.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the nonlinear optical pulse responses of\nexcitons in a thin film where the excitonic center-of-mass motion is confined.\nA large interaction volume between excitons and radiation yields particular\ncoupled states with radiative decay times reaching several femto-seconds. By\nconsidering two polarization directions of light, we reveal that these\nfast-decay modes dominantly survive in an optical Kerr spectra even under a\nmassive nonradiative damping $\\Gamma=30$ meV. The results clearly show that\nthere is an optimal combination of the incident pulse width and the film\nthickness for maximizing the integrated intensity of nonlinear signals.\n", "  Statistical properties of the one-dimensional spring-block (Burridge-Knopoff)\nmodel of earthquakes obeying the rate and state dependent friction law are\nstudied by extensive computer simulations. The quantities computed include the\nmagnitude distribution, the rupture-length distribution, the mainshock\nrecurrence-time distribution, the seismic time correlations before and after\nthe mainshock, the mean slip amount, and the mean stress drop at the mainshock,\netc. Events of the model can be classified into two distinct categories. One\ntends to be unilateral with its epicenter located at the rim of the rupture\nzone of the preceding event, while the other tends to be bilateral with\nenhanced \"characteristic\" features resembling the so-called \"asperity\". For\nboth types events, the distribution of the rupture length $L_r$ exhibits an\nexponential behavior at larger sizes, $\\approx \\exp[-L_r/L_0]$ with a\ncharacteristic \"seismic correlation length\" $L_0$. The mean slip as well as the\nmean stress drop tends to be rupture-length independent for larger events. The\ncontinuum limit of the model is examined, where the model is found to exhibit\npronounced characteristic features. In the continuum limit, the characteristic\nrupture length $L_0$ is estimated to be $\\sim $100 [km]. This means that, even\nin a hypothetical homogenous infinite fault, events cannot be indefinitely\nlarge in the exponential sense, the upper limit being of order $\\sim 10^3$\nkilometers. Implications to real seismicity are discussed.\n", "  The switching field distribution within arrays of single-domain ferromagnetic\nislands incorpo- rates both island-island interactions and quenched disorder in\nisland geometry. Separating these two contributions is important for\ndisentangling the effects of disorder and interactions in the magnetization\ndynamics of island arrays. Using sub-micron, spatially resolved Kerr imaging in\nan external magnetic field for islands with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy,\nwe map out the evolution of island arrays during hysteresis loops. Resolving\nand tracking individual islands across four different lattice types and a range\nof inter-island spacings, we extract the individual switching fields of every\nisland and thereby determine the relative contributions of interactions and\nquenched disorder in the arrays. The width of the switching field distribution\nis well explained by a simple model comprising the sum of an array-independent\ncontribution (interpreted as disorder-induced), and a term proportional to the\nmaximum field the fully polarized array could exert on a single island. We\nconclude that disorder in these arrays is primarily a single-island property.\n", "  The set $GU_f$ of possible effective elastic tensors of composites built from\ntwo materials with elasticity tensors $\\BC_1>0$ and $\\BC_2=0$ comprising the\nset $U=\\{\\BC_1,\\BC_2\\}$ and mixed in proportions $f$ and $1-f$ is partly\ncharacterized. The material with tensor $\\BC_2=0$ corresponds to a material\nwhich is void. (For technical reasons $\\BC_2$ is actually taken to be nonzero\nand we take the limit $\\BC_2\\to 0$). Specifically, recalling that $GU_f$ is\ncompletely characterized through minimums of sums of energies, involving a set\nof applied strains, and complementary energies, involving a set of applied\nstresses, we provide descriptions of microgeometries that in appropriate limits\nachieve the minimums in many cases. In these cases the calculation of the\nminimum is reduced to a finite dimensional minimization problem that can be\ndone numerically. Each microgeometry consists of a union of walls in\nappropriate directions, where the material in the wall is an appropriate\n$p$-mode material, that is easily compliant to $p\\leq 5$ independent applied\nstrains, yet supports any stress in the orthogonal space. Thus the material can\neasily slip in certain directions along the walls. The region outside the walls\ncontains \"complementary Avellaneda material\" which is a hierarchical laminate\nwhich minimizes the sum of complementary energies.\n", "  We compute for general single-field inflation the intrinsic non-Gaussianity\ndue to the self-interactions of the inflaton field in the squeezed limit. We\nrecover the consistency relation in the context of the delta N formalism, and\nargue that there is a particular field redefinition that makes the intrinsic\nnon-Gaussianity vanishing, thus improving the estimate of the local\nnon-Gaussianity using the delta N formalism.\n", "  The set $GU_f$ of possible effective elastic tensors of composites built from\ntwo materials with positive definite elasticity tensors $\\BC_1$ and\n$\\BC_2=\\Gd\\BC_0$ comprising the set $U=\\{\\BC_1,\\Gd\\BC_0\\}$ and mixed in\nproportions $f$ and $1-f$ is partly characterized in the limit $\\Gd\\to\\infty$.\nThe material with tensor $\\BC_2$ corresponds to a material which (for technical\nreasons) is almost rigid in the limit $\\Gd\\to \\infty$. The paper, and the\nunderlying microgeometries, have many aspects in common with the companion\npaper \"On the possible effective elasticity tensors of 2-dimensional printed\nmaterials\". The chief difference is that one has a different algebraic problem\nto solve: determining the subspaces of stress fields for which the thin walled\nstructures can be rigid, rather than determining, as in the companion paper,\nthe subspaces of strain fields for which the thin walled structure is\ncompliant. Recalling that $GU_f$ is completely characterized through minimums\nof sums of energies, involving a set of applied strains, and complementary\nenergies, involving a set of applied stresses, we provide descriptions of\nmicrogeometries that in appropriate limits achieve the minimums in many cases.\nIn these cases the calculation of the minimum is reduced to a finite\ndimensional minimization problem that can be done numerically. Each\nmicrogeometry consists of a union of walls in appropriate directions, where the\nmaterial in the wall is an appropriate $p$-mode material, that is almost rigid\nto $6-p\\leq 5$ independent applied stresses, yet is compliant to any strain in\nthe orthogonal space. Thus the walls, by themselves, can support stress with\nalmost no deformation. The region outside the walls contains \"Avellaneda\nmaterial\" that is a hierarchical laminate which minimizes an appropriate sum of\nelastic energies.\n", "  We present a general formulation to calculate the dynamic optical\nconductivity, beyond the linear response regime, of any electronic system whose\nquasiparticle dispersion is described by a two band model. Our phenomenological\nmodel is based on the optical Bloch equations. In the steady state regime it\nyields an analytic solution for the population inversion and the interband\ncoherence, which are nonlinear in the optical field intensity, including finite\ndoping and temperature effects. We explicitly show that the optical\nnonlinearities are controlled by a single dimensionless parameter which is\ndirectly proportional to the incident field strength and inversely proportional\nto the optical frequency. This identification leads to a unified way to study\nthe dynamical conductivity and the differential transmission spectrum across a\nwide range of optical frequencies, and optical field strength. We use our\nformalism to analytically calculate the nonlinear optical conductivity of doped\nand gapped graphene, deriving the well known universal ac conductivity of\n$\\sigma_0={e^2}/4\\hbar$ in the linear response regime of low optical\nintensities (or equivalently high frequencies) and non-linear deviations from\nit which appear at high laser intensities (or low frequencies) including the\nimpact of finite doping and band-gap opening.\n", "  We find a four-dimensional N=1 gauge theory which flows to the minimal\ninteracting N=2 superconformal field theory, the Argyres-Douglas theory, in the\ninfrared up to the extra free chiral multiplets. The gauge theory is obtained\nfrom a certain N=1 preserving deformation of the N=2 SU(2) gauge theory with\nfour fundamental hypermultiplets. From this description, we compute the full\nsuperconformal index and find agreements with the known results in special\nlimits.\n", "  In this work, we consider inflection point inflation in the framework of\nrunning kinetic term inflation in supergravity. We study the inflationary\ndynamics and show that the predicted value of the scalar spectral index and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio can lie within the $1\\sigma$ confidence region allowed\nby the result of Planck 2015.\n", "  We approach multipartite entanglement classification in the symmetric\nsubspace in terms of algebraic geometry, its natural language. We show that the\nclass of symmetric separable states has the structure of a Veronese variety and\nthat its $k$-secant varieties are SLOCC invariants. Thus SLOCC classes gather\nnaturally into families. This classification presents useful properties such as\na linear growth of the number of families with the number of particles, and\nnesting, i.e. upward consistency of the classification. We attach physical\nmeaning to this classification through the required interaction length of\nparent Hamiltonians. We show that the states $W_N$ and GHZ$_N$ are in the same\nsecant family and that, effectively, the former can be obtained in a limit from\nthe latter. This limit is understood in terms of tangents, leading to a\nrefinement of the previous families. We compute explicitly the classification\nof symmetric states with $N\\leq 4$ qubits in terms of both secant families and\nits refinement using tangents. This paves the way to further use of projective\nvarieties in algebraic geometry to solve open problems in entanglement theory.\n", "  We propose an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in $3+1$\ndimensions utilising ideas from higher lattice gauge theory, where the gauge\nsymmetry is given by a finite 2-group. We explicitly show that the model is a\nHamiltonian realisation of Yetter's homotopy 2-type topological quantum field\ntheory whereby the groundstate projector of the model defined on the manifold\n$M^3$ is given by the partition function of the underlying topological quantum\nfield theory for $M^3\\times [0,1]$. We show that this result holds in any\ndimension and illustrate it by computing the ground state degeneracy for a\nselection of spatial manifolds and 2-groups. As an application we show that a\nsubset of our model is dual to a class of Abelian Walker-Wang models describing\n$3+1$ dimensional topological insulators.\n", "  Flat domain walls and spherical black holes are solutions to coupled\nsecond-order ODE's of the Hamiltonian form. Hamilton-Jacobi theory then implies\nthat first-order flow equations always exist (possibly up to isolated\nsubmanifolds). If the first-order equations factorise in a specific way, they\ntake a form that has been named fake supersymmetry. We point out that this\nfactorisation is always possible at zero temperature. We therefore propose a\nless generic definition of fake supersymmetry, which involves the boundary\nconditions in a non-trivial way, and we analyse its physical relevance. For\ninstance attractor flows are necessarily fake supersymmetric in our restricted\nsense. To illustrate the definition we provide new analytic solutions for\naxion-dilaton domain walls with fake superpotentials that were argued not to\nexist.\n", "  We investigate the properties of the galaxies that reionized the Universe and\nthe history of cosmic reionization using the \"Evolution and Assembly of\nGaLaxies and their environments\" (EAGLE) cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We obtain the evolution of the escape fraction of ionizing photons\nin galaxies assuming that galactic winds create channels through which\n20~percent of photons escape when the local surface density of star formation\nis greater than $0.1$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Such threshold behaviour\nfor the generation of winds is observed, and the rare local objects which have\nsuch high star formation surface densities exhibit high escape fractions of\n$\\sim 10$ percent. In our model the luminosity-weighted mean escape fraction\nincreases with redshift as $\\bar f_{\\rm esc}=0.045~((1+z)/4)^{1.1}$ at $z>3$,\nand the galaxy number weighted mean as $\\langle f_{\\rm esc}\n\\rangle=2.2\\times10^{-3}~((1+z)/4)^4$, and becomes constant $\\approx0.2$ at\nredshift $z>10$. The escape fraction evolves as an increasingly large fraction\nof stars forms above the critical surface density of star formation at earlier\ntimes. This evolution of the escape fraction, combined with that of the star\nformation rate density from EAGLE, reproduces the inferred evolution of the\nfilling factor of ionized regions during the reionization epoch ($6<z<8$), the\nevolution of the post-reionization ($0\\leq z<6$) hydrogen photoionisation rate,\nand the optical depth due to Thomson scattering of the cosmic microwave\nbackground photons measured by the Planck satellite.\n", "  The Galactic blue supergiant SBW1 with its circumstellar ring nebula\nrepresents the best known analog of the progenitor of SN 1987A. High-resolution\nimaging has shown H-alpha and IR structures arising in an ionized flow that\npartly fills the ring's interior. To constrain the influence of the stellar\nwind on this structure, we obtained an ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the central\nstar of SBW1 with the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). The UV spectrum\nshows none of the typical wind signatures, indicating a very low mass-loss\nrate. Radiative transfer models suggest an extremely low rate below 10$^{-10}$\nMsun/yr, although we find that cooling timescales probably become comparable to\nor longer than the flow time below 10$^{-8}$ Msun/yr. We therefore adopt this\nlatter value as a conservative upper limit. For the central star, the model\nyields $T_{\\rm eff}$=21,000$\\pm$1000 K, $L\\simeq$5$\\times$10$^4$ $L_{\\odot}$,\nand roughly Solar composition except for enhanced N abundance. SBW1's very low\nmass-loss rate may hinder the wind's ability to shape the surrounding nebula.\nThe very low mass-loss rate also impairs the wind's ability to shed angular\nmomentum; the spin-down timescale for magnetic breaking is more than 500 times\nlonger than the age of the ring. This, combined with the star's slow rotation\nrate, constrain merger scenarios to form ring nebulae. The mass-loss rate is at\nleast 10 times lower than expected from mass-loss recipes, without any account\nof clumping. The physical explanation for why SBW1's wind is so weak presents\nan interesting mystery.\n", "  The anisotropic galaxy clustering of large scale structure observed by the\nBaryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Data Release 11 is analyzed to probe\nthe sum of neutrino mass in the small $m_\\nu < 1eV$ limit in which the early\nbroadband shape determined before the last scattering surface is immune from\nthe variation of $m_\\nu$. The signature of $m_\\nu$ is imprinted on the altered\nshape of the power spectrum at later epoch, which provides an opportunity to\naccess the non--trivial $m_\\nu$ through the measured anisotropic correlation\nfunction in redshift space (hereafter RSD instead of Redshift Space\nDistortion). The non--linear RSD corrections with massive neutrinos in the\nquasi linear regime are approximately estimated using one-loop order terms\ncomputed by tomographic linear solutions. We suggest a new approach to probe\n$m_\\nu$ simultaneously with all other distance measures and coherent growth\nfunctions, exploiting this deformation of the early broadband shape of the\nspectrum at later epoch. If the origin of cosmic acceleration is unknown,\n$m_\\nu$ is poorly determined after marginalising over all other observables.\nHowever, we find that the measured distances and coherent growth functions are\nminimally affected by the presence of mild neutrino mass. Although the standard\nmodel of cosmic acceleration is assumed to be the cosmological constant, the\nconstraint on $m_\\nu$ is little improved. Interestingly, the measured CMB\ndistance to the last scattering surface sharply slices the degeneracy between\nthe matter content and $m_\\nu$, and the hidden $m_\\nu$ is excavated to be\n$m_\\nu=0.19^{+0.28}_{-0.17} eV$ which is different from massless neutrino more\nthan 68% confidence.\n", "  Field models with $n$ extra spatial dimensions have a larger $SO(1,3+n)$\nLorentz symmetry which is broken down to the standard $SO(1,3)$ four\ndimensional one by the compactification process. By considering Lorentz\nviolating operators in a $5D$ supersymmetric Wess-Zumino mo\\-del, which\notherwise conserve the standard four dimensional Poincare invariance, we show\nthat supersymmetry can be restored upon a simple deformation of the\nsupersymmetric transformations. However, supersymmetry is not preserved in the\neffective $4D$ theory that arises after compactification when the $5D$ Lorentz\nviolating operators do not preserve $Z_2: y\\rightarrow -y$ bulk parity. Our\nmechanism unveils a possible connection among Lorentz violation and the\nScherk-Schwarz mechanism. We also show that parity preserving models, on the\nother hand, do provide well defined supersymmetric KK models.\n", "  One of the fundamental problems of modern physics is how the classical world,\nthe 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and the whole irreversibility emerges from the\nquantum reality with reversible evolution. This relates to the problem of\nmeasurement transforming quantum, non-copyable data, towards intersubjective,\ncopyable classical knowledge. We use the quantum state discrimination to show\nin a central system model how it's evolution leads to the broadcasting of the\nclassical information. We analyze the process of orthogonalization and\ndecoherence, their time scales and dependence on the environment.\n", "  High pressure X-ray diffraction measurements have been carried out on the\nintermetallic semiconductor FeGa$_3$ and the equation of state for FeGa$_3$ has\nbeen determined. First principles based DFT calculations within the GGA\napproximation indicate that although the unit cell volume matches well with the\nexperimentally obtained value at ambient pressure, it is significantly\nunderestimated at high pressures and the difference between them increases as\npressure increases. GGA + U calculations with increasing values of U$_{Fe(3d)}$\n(on-site Coulomb repulsion between the Fe 3d electrons) at high pressures,\ncorrect this discrepancy. Further, the GGA+U calculations also show that along\nwith U$_{Fe(3d)}$, the Fe 3d band width also increases with pressure and around\na pressure of 4 GPa, a small density of states appear at the Fermi level. High\npressure resistance measurements carried out on FeGa$_3$ also clearly show a\nsignature of an electronic transition. Beyond the pressure of 19.7 GPa, the\ndiffraction peaks reduce in intensity and are not observable beyond $\\sim$ 26\nGPa, leading to an amorphous state.\n", "  We investigate decay modes of spin-1 heavy vector bosons ($V'$) from the\nviewpoint of perturbative unitarity in a model-independent manner. Perturbative\nunitarity requires some relations among couplings. The relations are called\nunitarity sum rules. We derive the unitarity sum rules from processes that\ncontain two fermions and two gauge bosons. We find the relations between $V'$\ncouplings to the SM fermions $(f)$ and $V'$ couplings to the SM gauge bosons\n($V$). Using the coupling relations, we calculate partial decay widths for $V'$\ndecays into $VV$ and $ff$. We show that Br($W' \\to WZ) \\lesssim$ 2$\\%$ in the\nsystem that contains $V'$ and CP-even scalars as well as the SM particles. This\nresult is independent of the number of the CP-even scalars. We also show that\ncontributions of CP-odd scalars help to make Br($W' \\to WZ$) larger than Br($W'\n\\to ff$) as long as the CP-odd scalars couple to both the SM fermions and the\nSM gauge bosons. The existence of the CP-odd scalar couplings is a useful\nguideline to construct models that predict Br($W' \\to WZ) \\gtrsim$ 2$\\%$. Our\nanalysis relies only on the perturbative unitarity of $f\\bar{f} \\to WW'$.\nTherefore our result can be applied to various models.\n", "  We improve and extend our study of the complex in-medium heavy quark\npotential and its Debye mass $m_D$ in a gluonic medium with a finer scan around\nthe deconfinement transition and newly generated ensembles closer to the\nthermodynamic limit. On the lattices with larger physical volume, Re[V] shows\nsigns of screening, i.e. a finite $m_D$, only in the deconfined phase,\nreminiscent of a genuine phase transition. Consistently Im[V] exhibits nonzero\nvalues also only above $T_C$. We compare the behavior of Re[V] with the color\nsinglet free-energies that have been used historically to extract the Debye\nmass. An effective coupling constant is computed to assess the residual\ninfluence of the confining part of the potential at $T>0$. Our previous finding\nof a gradual screening of Re[V] around $T_C$ on finer lattices is critically\nreassessed and interpreted to originate from finite volume artifacts that\naffect the deployed $\\beta=7$, $\\xi_b=3.5$ parameter set at $N_s=32$.\n", "  We derive a set of composite pulse sequences that generates CNOT gates and\ncorrect all systematic errors within the logical subspace to arbitrary order.\nThese sequences are applicable for any two-qubit interaction Hamiltonian, and\nmake no assumptions about the underlying noise mechanism except that it is\nconstant on the timescale of the operation. We do assume access to error-free\nsingle-qubit gates, so single-qubit gate imperfections eventually limit the\nachievable fidelity. However, since single-qubit gates generally have much\nhigher fidelities than two-qubit gates in practice, these pulse sequences offer\nuseful dynamical correction for a wide range of coupled qubit systems.\n", "  We present gravitational wave (GW) signal predictions from four 3D\nmulti-group neutrino hydrodynamics simulations of core-collapse supernovae of\nprogenitors with 11.2 Msun, 20 Msun, and 27 Msun. GW emission in the\npre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is\ndominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and\ndiffers considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal\ncomponent below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a\nnon-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and\nSASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably\nlower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism\nfor high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly\nexcited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface\ng-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D\nbecause of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability\nin the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in\nenhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the\nconvective eddies in the PNS convection zone. Estimates of the expected excess\npower in two frequency bands suggests that second-generation detectors will\nonly be able to detect very nearby events, but that third-generation detectors\ncould distinguish SASI- and convection-dominated models at distances of ~10\nkpc.\n", "  We show that the coherent forward scattering (CFS) interference peak\namplitude sharply jumps from zero to a finite value upon crossing a\nmetal-insulator transition. Extensive numerical simulations reveal that the CFS\npeak contrast obeys the one-parameter scaling hypothesis and gives access to\nthe critical exponents of the transition. We also discover that the critical\nCFS peak directly controls the spectral compressibility at the transition where\neigenfunctions are multifractal, and we demonstrate the universality of this\nproperty with respect to various types of disorder.\n", "  In multi-field inflation one or more non-adiabatic modes may become light,\npotentially inducing large levels of isocurvature perturbations in the cosmic\nmicrowave background. If in addition these light modes are coupled to the\nadiabatic mode, they influence its evolution on super horizon scales. Here we\nconsider the case in which a non-adiabatic mode becomes approximately massless\n(\"ultralight\") while still coupled to the adiabatic mode, a typical situation\nthat arises with pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons or moduli. This ultralight mode\nfreezes on super-horizon scales and acts as a constant source for the curvature\nperturbation, making it grow linearly in time and effectively suppressing the\nisocurvature component. We identify a Stuckelberg-like emergent shift symmetry\nthat underlies this behavior. As inflation lasts for many e-folds, the\nintegrated effect of this source enhances the power spectrum of the adiabatic\nmode, while keeping the non-adiabatic spectrum approximately untouched. In this\ncase, towards the end of inflation all the fluctuations, adiabatic and\nnon-adiabatic, are dominated by a single degree of freedom.\n", "  The combination of bistability and noise is ubiquitous in complex systems,\nfrom biological to social interactions, and has important implications for\ntheir functioning and resilience. We analyze a simple three-state model for\nbistability in networks under varying unbiased noise. In a fully connected\nnetwork increasing noise yields a collapse of bistability to an unpolarised\nstate. In contrast, in complex networks noise can abruptly switch the\npolarization state in an irreversible way. When two networks are combined\nthrough increasing multiplex coupling, one is dominant and progressively\nimposes its state on the other, offsetting or promoting the ability of noise to\nswitch polarization. Our results show that dynamical correlations and asymmetry\nin dynamical processes in networks are sufficient for allowing unbiased noise\nto produce abrupt irreversible transitions between extremes, which can be\nneutralized or enhanced by multiplex coupling.\n", "  With the recent discovery of transiting planetary material around WD\n1145+017, a critical target has been identified that links the evolution of\nplanetary systems with debris disks and their accretion onto the star. We\npresent a series of observations, five epochs over a year, taken with Keck and\nthe VLT, which for the first time show variability of circumstellar absorption\nin the gas disk surrounding WD 1145+017 on timescales of minutes to months.\nCircumstellar absorption is measured in more than 250 lines of 14 ions among\nten different elements associated with planetary composition, e.g., O, Mg, Ca,\nTi, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni. Broad circumstellar gas absorption with a velocity spread\nof 225 km/s is detected, but over the course of a year blue shifted absorption\ndisappears while redshifted absorption systematically increases. A correlation\nof equivalent width and oscillator strength indicates that the gas is not\nhighly optically thick (median tau approximately 2). We discuss simple models\nof an eccentric disk coupled with magnetospheric accretion to explain the basic\nobserved characteristics of these high resolution and high signal-to-noise\nobservations. Variability is detected on timescales of minutes in the two most\nrecent observations, showing a loss of redshifted absorption for tens of\nminutes, coincident with major transit events and consistent with gas hidden\nbehind opaque transiting material. This system currently presents a unique\nopportunity to learn how the gas causing the spectroscopic, circumstellar\nabsorption is associated with the ongoing accretion evidenced by photospheric\ncontamination, as well as the transiting planetary material detected in\nphotometric observations.\n", "  A central challenge in quantum computing is to identify more computational\nproblems for which utilization of quantum resources can offer significant\nspeedup. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to tackle the\nquantum optimal control problem. We show that the most computationally\ndemanding part of gradient-based algorithms, namely computing the fitness\nfunction and its gradient for a control input, can be accomplished by the\nprocess of evolution and measurement on a quantum simulator. By posing queries\nto and receiving messages from the quantum simulator, classical computing\ndevices update the control parameters until an optimal control solution is\nfound. To demonstrate the quantum-classical scheme in experiment, we use a\nnine-spin nuclear magnetic resonance system, on which we have succeeded in\npreparing a seven-correlated quantum state without involving classical\ncomputation of the large Hilbert space evolution.\n", "  Context. Although a variety of techniques have been employed for determining\nthe Milky Way dark matter halo mass distribution, the range of allowed masses\nspans both light and heavy values. Knowing the precise mass of our Galaxy is\nimportant for placing the Milky Way in a cosmological $\\Lambda$CDM context.\nAims. We show that hypervelocity stars (HVSs) ejected from the center of the\nMilky Way galaxy can be used to constrain the mass of its dark matter halo.\nMethods. We use the asymmetry in the radial velocity distribution of halo stars\ndue to escaping HVSs, which depends on the halo potential (escape speed) as\nlong as the round trip orbital time is shorter than the stellar lifetime, to\ndiscriminate between different models for the Milky Way gravitational\npotential. Results. Adopting a characteristic HVS travel time of $330$ Myr,\nwhich corresponds to the average mass of main sequence HVSs, we find that\ncurrent data favors a mass for the Milky Way in the range $(1.2$-$1.9)\\times\n10^{12} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.\n", "  A simple mechanical analog describing Landau-Zener tunneling effect is\nproposed using two weakly coupled chains of nonlinear oscillators with\ngradually decreasing (first chain) and increasing (second chain) masses. The\nmodel allows to investigate nonlinear generalization of Landau-Zener tunneling\neffect considering soliton propagation and tunneling between the chains. It is\nshown that soliton tunneling characteristics become drastically dependent on\nits amplitude in nonlinear regime. The validity of the developed tunneling\ntheory is justified via comparison with direct numerical simulations on\noscillator ladder system.\n", "  The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) is an invaluable new tool\nto probe gravity and the nature of cosmic acceleration. A large class of\nscalar-tensor theories predict that GWs propagate with velocity different than\nthe speed of light, a difference that can be $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for many models\nof dark energy. We determine the conditions behind the anomalous GW speed,\nnamely that the scalar field spontaneously breaks Lorentz invariance and\ncouples to the metric perturbations via the Weyl tensor. If these conditions\nare realized in nature, the delay between GW and electromagnetic (EM) signals\nfrom distant events will run beyond human timescales, making it impossible to\nmeasure the speed of GWs using neutron star mergers or other violent events. We\npresent a robust strategy to exclude or confirm an anomalous speed of GWs using\neclipsing binary systems, whose EM phase can be exquisitely determined. he\nwhite dwarf binary J0651+2844 is a known example of such system that can be\nused to probe deviations in the GW speed as small as $c_g/c-1\\gtrsim 2\\cdot\n10^{-12}$ when LISA comes online. This test will either eliminate many\ncontender models for cosmic acceleration or wreck a fundamental pillar of\ngeneral relativity.\n", "  Within the context of semiquantum nonlocal games, the trust can be removed\nfrom the measurement devices in an entanglement-detection procedure. Here we\nshow that a similar approach can be taken to quantify the amount of\nentanglement. To be specific, first, we show that in this context a small\nsubset of semiquantum nonlocal games is necessary and sufficient for\nentanglement detection in the LOCC paradigm. Second, we prove that the maximum\npay-off for these games is a universal measure of entanglement which is convex\nand continuous. Third, we show that for the quantification of\nnegative-partial-transpose entanglement, this subset can be further reduced\ndown to a single arbitrary element. Importantly, our measure is operationally\naccessible in a measurement-device-independent way by construction. Finally,\nour approach is simply extended to quantify the entanglement within any\npartitioning of multipartite quantum states.\n", "  The positive-parity nucleon spectrum is explored in $2 + 1$-flavour lattice\nQCD in a search for new low-lying energy eigenstates near the energy regime of\nthe Roper resonance. In addition to conventional three-quark operators, we\nconsider novel, local five-quark meson-baryon type interpolating fields that\nhold the promise to reveal new eigenstates that may have been missed in\nprevious analyses. Drawing on phenomenological insight, five-quark operators\nbased on $\\sigma{N}$, $\\pi{N}$ and $a_0{N}$ channels are constructed. Spectra\nare produced in a high-statistics analysis on the PACS-CS dynamical gauge-field\nconfigurations with $m_{\\pi} = 411\\textrm{ MeV}$ via variational analyses of\nseveral operator combinations. Despite the introduction of qualitatively\ndifferent interpolating fields, no new states are observed in the energy regime\nof the Roper resonance. This result provides further evidence that the\nlow-lying finite-volume scattering states are not localised, and strengthens\nthe interpretation of the Roper as a coupled-channel, dynamically-generated\nmeson-baryon resonance.\n", "  Einstein's famous equation $E_{\\rm rest}=mc^2$ for the rest energy of a\nsystem with mass $m$ requires that the internal energy of the system be\nincluded in $m$. Pursuing this idea using Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics\nyields a relativistic coupling between the center of mass motion and the\ninternal dynamics of the system. Here we explore the consequences of this\ncoupling, first classically, where we find that the dynamics of the system is\ntime dilated when moving relative to another inertial frame. We then apply the\ndynamics to a quantum 2-level atom bound in a 1-dimensional infinite potential\nwell, and show that the coupling produces collapses and revivals in quantum\ninterference.\n", "  Recently, several studies have investigated synchronization in\nquantum-mechanical limit-cycle oscillators. However, the quantum nature of\nthese systems remained partially hidden, since the dynamics of the oscillator's\nphase was overdamped and therefore incoherent. We show that there exist regimes\nof underdamped and even quantum-coherent phase motion, opening up new\npossibilities to study quantum synchronization dynamics. To this end, we\ninvestigate the Van der Pol oscillator (a paradigm for a self-oscillating\nsystem) synchronized to an external drive. We derive an effective quantum model\nwhich fully describes the regime of underdamped phase motion and additionally\nallows us to identify the quality of quantum coherence. Finally, we identify\nquantum limit cycles of the phase itself.\n", "  Although chiral magnetic materials have emerged as a potential ingredient in\nfuture spintronic memory devices, there are few comprehensive studies of\nmagnetic properties in scalably-grown thin films. We present growth, systematic\nphysical and magnetic characterization, and microwave absorption spectroscopy\nof B20 FeGe thin films. We also perform micromagnetic simulations and\nanalytical theory to understand the dynamical magnetic behavior of this\nmaterial. We find magnetic resonance features in both the helical and\nfield-polarized magnetic states that are well explained by micromagnetic\nsimulations and analytical calculations. In particular, we show the resonant\nenhancement of spin waves along the FeGe film thickness that has a wave vector\nmatching the helical vector. Using our analytic model, we also describe the\nresonance frequency of a helical magnetic state, which depends solely on its\nuntwisting field. Our results pave the way for understanding and manipulating\nhigh frequency spin waves in thin-film chiral-magnet FeGe near room\ntemperature.\n", "  We numerically examine the dynamic phases and pattern formation of\ntwo-dimensional monodisperse repulsive disks driven over random quenched\ndisorder. We show that there is a series of distinct dynamic regimes as a\nfunction of increasing drive, including a clogged or pile-up phase near\ndepinning, a homogeneous disordered flow state, and a dynamically phase\nseparated regime consisting of high density crystalline regions surrounded by a\nlow density of disordered disks. At the highest drives the disks arrange into\none-dimensional moving lanes. The phase separated regime has parallels with\nphase separation observed in active matter systems, and arises in the disk\nsystem due to the combination of nonequilibrium fluctuations and density\ndependent mobility. We discuss how this system exhibits pronounced differences\nfrom previous studies of driven particles moving over random substrates where\nthe particles, such as superconducting vortices or electron crystals, have\nlonger range repulsive interactions, and where dynamical phase separation and\nstrong one-dimensional moving chain effects are not observed. The system we\nconsider could be realized experimentally using sterically interacting colloids\ndriven over random pinning arrays or quasi-two-dimensional granular matter\nflowing over rough landscapes.\n", "  The majority of recent hydrodynamical simulations indicate the creation of\ncentral cores in the mass profiles of low-mass halos, a process that is\nattributed to star formation-related baryonic feedback. Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem). Here we test core creation as a solution of cosmological\nissues by using a sample of dwarfs with measurements of their atomic hydrogen\n(HI) kinematics extending to large radii. Using the NIHAO hydrodynamical\nsimulation as an example, we show that core creation can successfully reproduce\nthe kinematics of dwarfs with small kinematic radii, R <~ 1.5 kpc. However, the\nagreement with observations becomes poor once galaxies with kinematic\nmeasurements extending beyond the core region, R ~ 1.5 - 4 kpc, are considered.\nThis result illustrates the importance of testing the predictions of\nhydrodynamical simulations that are relevant for cosmology against a broad\nrange of observational samples. We would like to stress that our result is\nvalid only under the following set of assumptions: i) that our sample of dwarfs\nwith HI kinematics is representative of the overall population of field dwarfs,\nii) that there are no severe measurement biases in the observational parameters\nof our HI dwarfs (e.g., related to inclination estimates), and iii) that the HI\nvelocity fields of dwarfs are regular enough to allow the recovery of the true\nenclosed dynamical mass.\n", "  We investigate the statistics of heat exchange between a finite system\ncoupled to reservoir(s). We have obtained analytical results for heat\nfluctuation theorem in the transient regime considering the Hamiltonian\ndynamics of the composite system consisting of the system of interest and the\nheat bath(s). The system of interest is driven by an external protocol. We\nfirst derive it in the context of a single heat bath. The result is in exact\nagreement with known result. We then generalize the treatment to two heat\nbaths. We further extend the study to quantum systems and show that relations\nsimilar to the classical case hold in the quantum regime. For our study we\ninvoke von Neumann two point projective measurement in quantum mechanics in the\ntransient regime. Our result is a generalisation of Jarzynski-W$\\grave{o}$jcik\nheat fluctuation theorem.\n", "  In~this paper, we construct noncommutative coherent states using various\nfamilies of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of $\\g$, a connected,\nsimply connected nilpotent Lie group, that was identified as the kinematical\nsymmetry group of noncommutative quantum mechanics for a system of 2-degrees of\nfreedom in an earlier paper. Likewise described are the degenerate\nnoncommutative coherent states arising from the degenerate UIRs of $\\g$.\nWe~then compute the reproducing kernels associated with both these families of\ncoherent states and study Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of the observables on\nthe underlying 4-dimensional phase space, analyzing in particular the\nsemi-classical asymptotics for both these cases.\n", "  Small angle neutron scattering measurements have been performed to study the\nthermodynamic stability of skyrmion-lattice phases in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. We found\nthat the two distinct skyrmion-lattice phases [SkX(1) and SkX(2) phases] can be\nstabilized through different thermal histories; by cooling from the\nparamagnetic phase under finite magnetic field, the SkX(2) phase is selected.\nOn the other hand, the 30$^{\\circ}$-rotated SkX(1) phase becomes dominant by\nheating the sample from the ordered conical phase under finite field. This\ndifference in stabilization is surprisingly similar to the irreversibility\nobserved in spin glasses. The zero-field cooling results in the co-existence of\nthe two phases. It is further found that once one of the skyrmion-lattice\nphases is formed, it is hardly destabilized. This indicates unusual thermal\nstability of the two skyrmion-lattice phases originating from an unexpectedly\nlarge energy barrier between them.\n", "  We have studied the dependence of the rotation angle and ellipticity on the\nsample orientation and incident polarization from metallic nanohole arrays. The\narrays have four-fold symmetry and thus do not possess any intrinsic chirality.\nWe elucidate the role of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in determining the\nextrinsic chirality and we verify the results by using finite-difference\ntime-domain simulation. Our results have indicated the outgoing reflection\narises from the interference between the nonresonant background, which\npreserves the input polarization, and the SPP radiation damping, which is\nlinearly polarized but carries a different polarization defined by the\nvectorial field of SPPs. More importantly, the interference manifests various\npolarization states ranging from linear to elliptical across the SPP resonance.\nWe analytically formulate the outgoing waves based on temporal coupled mode\ntheory (CMT) and the results agree well with the experiment and simulation.\nFrom CMT, we find the polarization conversion depends on the interplay between\nthe absorption and radiative decay rates of SPPs and the sample orientation.\n", "  Topological states of matter are characterized by global topological\ninvariants which change their value across a topological quantum phase\ntransition. It is commonly assumed that the transition between topologically\ndistinct noninteracting gapped phases of fermions is necessarily accompanied by\nthe closing of the band gap as long as the symmetries of the system are\nmaintained. We show that such a quantum phase transition is possible without\nclosing the gap in the case of a three-dimensional topological band insulator.\nWe demonstrate this by calculating the free energy of the minimal model for a\ntopological insulator, the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model, and show that as the\nband curvature continuously varies, a jump between the band gap minima\ncorresponding to the topologically trivial and nontrivial insulators occurs.\nTherefore, this first order phase transition is a generic feature of\nthree-dimensional topological band insulators. For a certain parameter range we\npredict a re-entrant topological phase transition. We discuss our findings in\nconnection with the recent experimental observation of a discontinuous\ntopological phase transition in a family of topological crystalline insulators.\n", "  A generalised phase-space kinetic Boltzmann equation for highly\nnon-equilibrium charged particle transport via localised and delocalised states\nis used to develop continuity, momentum and energy balance equations,\naccounting explicitly for scattering, trapping/detrapping and recombination\nloss processes. Analytic expressions detail the effect of these microscopic\nprocesses on the mobility and diffusivity. Generalised Einstein relations (GER)\nare developed that enable the anisotropic nature of diffusion to be determined\nin terms of the measured field-dependence of the mobility. Interesting\nphenomena such as negative differential conductivity and recombination\nheating/cooling are shown to arise from recombination loss processes and the\nlocalised and delocalised nature of transport. Fractional transport emerges\nnaturally within this framework through the appropriate choice of divergent\nmean waiting time distributions for localised states, and fractional\ngeneralisations of the GER and mobility are presented. Signature impacts on\ntime-of-flight current transients of recombination loss processes via both\nlocalised and delocalised states are presented.\n", "  The Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and the multi-local field theory are\ninteresting and promising candidates for solving the naturalness problem in the\nuniverse. These theories are based on the different physical principles: The\nformer assumes the micro-canonical partition function $\\int {\\cal{D}}\\phi\\\n\\prod_i \\delta (S_i^{}-I_i^{})$, and the latter assumes the partition function\n$\\int {\\cal{D}}\\phi\\ \\exp\\left(iS_M^{}\\right)$ where $S_M^{}$ is the\nmulti-local action $\\sum_i c_i^{}S_i^{}+\\sum_{i,j}c_{i,j}^{}S_i^{}S_j^{}+\\cdots\n$. Our main purpose is to show that they are equivalent in the sense that they\npredict the same fine-tuning mechanism. In order to clarify our argument, we\nfirst study (review) the similarity between the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism and\nstatistical mechanics in detail, and show that the dynamical fine-tuning in the\nformer picture can be understood completely in the same way as the\ndetermination of the temperature in the latter picture. Afterward, we discuss\nthe multi-local theory and the equivalence between it and the the\nFroggatt-Nielsen mechanism. Because the multi-local field theory can be\nobtained from physics at the Planck/String scale, this equivalence indicates\nthat the micro-canonical picture can also originate in such physics. As a\nconcrete example, we also review the IIB matrix model as an origin of the\nmulti-local theory.\n", "  We show that the total kinetic energy (TKE) of nuclei after the spontaneous\nfission of $^{258}$Fm can be well reproduced using simple assumptions on the\nquantum collective phase-space explored by the nucleus after passing the\nfission barrier. Assuming energy conservation and phase-space exploration\naccording to the stochastic mean-field approach, a set of initial densities is\ngenerated. Each density is then evolved in time using the nuclear\ntime-dependent density-functional theory. This approach goes beyond mean-field\nby allowing spontaneous symmetry breaking as well as a wider dynamical\nphase-space exploration leading to larger fluctuations in collective space. The\ntotal kinetic energy and mass distributions are calculated. New information on\nthe fission process: fluctuations in scission time, strong correlation between\nTKE and collective deformation of daughter nuclei as well as pre- and\npost-scission particle emission, are obtained.\n", "  Supersymmetric (SUSY) gauge theories such as the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model play a fundamental role in modern particle physics, but have not\nbeen verified so far in nature. Here, we show that a SUSY gauge theory with\ndynamical gauge bosons and fermionic gauginos emerges naturally at the\npair-density-wave (PDW) quantum phase transition on the surface of a correlated\ntopological insulator (TI) hosting three Dirac cones, such as the topological\nKondo insulator SmB$_6$. At the quantum tricritical point between the surface\nDirac semimetal and nematic PDW phases, three massless bosonic Cooper pair\nfields emerge as the superpartners of three massless surface Dirac fermions.\nThe resulting low-energy effective theory is the supersymmetric XYZ model,\nwhich is dual by mirror symmetry to $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum\nelectrodynamics (SQED) in 2+1 dimensions, providing a first example of emergent\nsupersymmetric gauge theory in condensed matter systems. Supersymmetry allows\nus to determine exactly certain critical exponents and the optical conductivity\nof the surface states at the strongly coupled tricritical point, which may be\nmeasured in future experiments.\n", "  Killing vector fields $K$ are defined on Finsler manifold. The Killing\nsymmetry is reformulated simply as $\\delta K^\\flat =0$ by using the Killing\nnon-linear 1-form $K^\\flat$ and the spray operator $\\delta$ with the Finsler\nnon-linear connection. $K^\\flat$ is related to the generalization of Killing\ntensors on Finsler manifold, and the condition $\\delta K^\\flat =0$ gives an\nanalytical method of finding higher derivative conserved quantities, which may\nbe called hidden conserved quantities. We show two examples: the Carter\nconstant on Kerr spacetime and the Runge-Lentz vectors in Newtonian gravity.\n", "  We present the evidence of lattice rotation vortices having an average radius\nof ~7 nm at the monoclinic ferroelectric domain boundary of\n(1-x)Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 (PZN-xPT, x=0.08). Maps of crystal orientations,\ndomain configurations, symmetry breaking are obtained using scanning convergent\nbeam electron diffraction (SCBED). Such measurements suggest the merging of 2D\nand 1D topological defects, with implications for domain-switching mechanisms\nin relaxor ferroelectric crystals, and the possibility of a new form of\nnanoscale ferroelectric devices.\n", "  We study, within a framework of the classical fields approximation, the\nstatic structure factor of a weakly interacting Bose gas at thermal\nequilibrium. As in a recent experiment (R. Schley et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n055301 (2013)), we find that the thermal distribution of phonons in a\nthree-dimensional Bose gas follows the Planck distribution. On the other hand\nwe find a disagreement between the Planck and phonon (calculated just like for\nthe bulk gas) distributions in the case of elongated quasi-one-dimensional\nsystems. We attribute this discrepancy to the existence of spontaneous dark\nsolitons (i.e., thermal solitons as reported in T. Karpiuk et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 109, 205302 (2012)) in an elongated Bose gas at thermal equilibrium.\n", "  The detailed investigation of the Higgs sector at present and future\ncolliders necessitates from the theory side as precise predictions as possible,\nincluding higher order corrections. An important ingredient for the computation\nof higher order corrections is the renormalization of the model parameters and\nfields. In this paper we complete the renormalization of the 2-Higgs-Doublet\nModel (2HDM) Higgs sector launched in a previous contribution with the\ninvestigation of the renormalization of the mixing angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nHere, we treat the renormalization of the mass parameter $m_{12}^2$ that softly\nbreaks the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of the 2HDM Higgs sector. We investigate the\nimpact of two different renormalization schemes on the sample Higgs-to-Higgs\ndecay $H\\to hh$. This decay also allows us to analyze the renormalization of\nthe mixing angles and to confirm the properties extracted before in other Higgs\ndecays. In conclusion we find that a gauge-independent, process-independent and\nnumerically stable renormalization of the 2HDM Higgs sector is given by the\napplication of the tadpole-pinched scheme for the mixing angles $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ and by the use of the $\\overline{MS}$ scheme for $m_{12}^2$.\n", "  The high room temperature mobility and the electron effective mass in\nBaSnO$_3$ are investigated in depth by evaluation of the free carrier\nabsorption observed in infrared spectra for epitaxial films with free electron\nconcentrations from $8.3 \\times 10^{18}$ to $7.3 \\times 10^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$.\nBoth the optical band gap widening by conduction band filling and the carrier\nscattering mechanisms in the low and high doping regimes are consistently\ndescribed employing parameters solely based on the intrinsic physical\nproperties of BaSnO$_3$. The results explain the current mobility limits in\nepitaxial films and demonstrate the potential of BaSnO$_3$ to outperform\nestablished wide band gap semiconductors also in the moderate doping regime.\n", "  Living cells use readout molecules to record the state of receptor proteins,\nsimilar to measurements or copies in typical computational devices. But is this\nanalogy rigorous? Can cells be optimally efficient, and if not, why? We show\nthat, as in computation, a canonical biochemical readout network generates\ncorrelations; extracting no work from these correlations sets a lower bound on\ndissipation. For general input, the biochemical network cannot reach this\nbound, even with arbitrarily slow reactions or weak thermodynamic driving. It\nfaces an accuracy-dissipation trade-off that is qualitatively distinct from and\nworse than implied by the bound, and more complex steady-state copy processes\ncannot perform better. Nonetheless, the cost remains close to the thermodynamic\nbound unless accuracy is extremely high. Additionally, we show that\nbiomolecular reactions could be used in thermodynamically optimal devices under\nexogenous manipulation of chemical fuels, suggesting an experimental system for\ntesting computational thermodynamics.\n", "  Some discrepancies have been reported between observed and simulated muon\ncontent of extensive air showers: the number of observed muons exceeded the\nexpectations in HiRes-MIA, Yakutsk and Pierre Auger Observatory data. Here, we\nanalyze the data of the Moscow State University Extensive Air Shower (EAS-MSU)\narray on E_mu>~10 GeV muons in showers caused by ~(10^17-10^18) eV primary\nparticles and demonstrate that they agree with simulations (QGSJET-II-04\nhadronic interaction model) once the primary composition inferred from the\nsurface-detector data is assumed.\n", "  Determination and characterization of criticality in two-dimensional (2D)\nquantum many-body systems belong to the most important challenges and problems\nof quantum physics. In this paper we propose an efficient scheme to solve this\nproblem by utilizing the infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS), and\ntensor network (TN) representations. We show that the criticality of a 2D state\nis faithfully reproduced by the ground state (dubbed as boundary state) of a\none-dimensional effective Hamiltonian constructed from its iPEPS\nrepresentation. We demonstrate that for a critical state the correlation length\nand the entanglement spectrum of the boundary state are essentially different\nfrom those of a gapped iPEPS. This provides a solid indicator that allows to\nidentify the criticality of the 2D state. Our scheme is verified on the\nresonating valence bond (RVB) states on kagom\\'e and square lattices, where the\nboundary state of the honeycomb RVB is found to be described by a $c=1$\nconformal field theory. We apply our scheme also to the ground state of the\nspin-1/2 XXZ model on honeycomb lattice, illustrating the difficulties of\nstandard variational TN approaches to study the critical ground states. Our\nscheme is of high versatility and flexibility, and can be further applied to\ninvestigate the quantum criticality in many other phenomena, such as\nfinite-temperature and topological phase transitions.\n", "  ANTARES is currently the largest neutrino telescope operating in the Northern\nHemisphere, aiming at the detection of high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical\nsources. Neutrino telescopes constantly monitor at least one complete\nhemisphere of the sky, and are thus well-suited to detect neutrinos produced in\ntransient astrophysical sources. A timedependent search has been applied to a\nlist of 33 x-ray binaries undergoing high flaring activities in satellite data\n(RXTE/ASM, MAXI and Swift/BAT) and during hardness transition states in the\n2008-2012 period. The background originating from interactions of charged\ncosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere is drastically reduced by requiring a\ndirectional and temporal coincidence with astrophysical phenomena. The results\nof this search are presented together with comparisons between the neutrino\nflux upper limits and the neutrino flux predictions from astrophysical models.\nThe neutrino flux upper limits resulting from this search limit the jet\nparameter predictions for some astrophysical models.\n", "  The hundreds of multiple planetary systems discovered by the \\textit{Kepler}\nmission are typically observed to reside in close-in ($\\lesssim0.5$ AU),\nlow-eccentricity, and low-inclination orbits. We run N-body experiments to\nstudy the effect that unstable outer ($\\gtrsim1$ AU) giant planets, whose end\norbital configurations resemble those in the Radial Velocity population, have\non these close-in multiple super-Earth systems. Our experiments show that the\ngiant planets greatly reduce the multiplicity of the inner super-Earths and the\nsurviving population can have large eccentricities ($e\\gtrsim0.3$) and\ninclinations ($i\\gtrsim20^\\circ$) at levels that anti-correlate with\nmultiplicity. Consequently, this model predicts the existence of a population\nof dynamically hot single-transiting planets with typical eccentricities and\ninclinations %in the ranges of $\\sim 0.1-0.5$ and $\\sim 10^\\circ-40^\\circ$. We\nshow that these results can explain the following observations: (i) the recent\neccentricity measurements of \\textit{Kepler} super-Earths from transit\ndurations; (ii) the tentative observation that single-transiting systems have a\nwider distribution of stellar obliquity angles compared to the\nmultiple-transiting systems; (iii) the architecture of some eccentric\nsuper-Earths discovered by Radial Velocity surveys such as HD\\,125612c. Future\nobservations from \\textit{TESS} will reveal many more dynamically hot single\ntransiting planets, for which follow up Radial Velocity studies will be able to\ntest our models and see whether they have outer giant planets.\n", "  We study the chiral ring of four-dimensional superconformal field theories\nobtained by wrapping M5-branes on a complex curve inside a Calabi-Yau\nthree-fold. We propose a field theoretic construction of all the theories found\nby Bah, Beem, Bobev and Wecht by introducing new building blocks, and prove\nseveral $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ dualities featuring the latter. We match the central\ncharges with those computed from the M5-brane anomaly polynomial, perform the\ncounting of relevant operators and analyze unitarity bound violations. As a\nbyproduct, we compute the exact dimension of \"heavy operators\" obtained by\nwrapping an M2-brane on the complex curve.\n", "  WR 148 (HD 197406) is an extreme runaway system considered to be a potential\ncandidate for a short-period (4.3173 d) rare WR + compact object binary.\nProvided with new high resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra from the Keck\nobservatory, we determine the orbital parameters for both the primary WR and\nthe secondary, yielding respective projected orbital velocity amplitudes of\n$88.1\\pm3.8$ km s$^{-1}$ and $79.2\\pm3.1$ km s$^{-1}$ and implying a mass ratio\nof $1.1\\pm0.1$. We then apply the shift-and-add technique to disentangle the\nspectra and obtain spectra compatible with a WN7ha and an O4-6 star.\nConsidering an orbital inclination of $\\sim67^\\circ$, derived from previous\npolarimetry observations, the system's total mass would be a mere 2-3\nM$_{\\odot}$ , an unprecedented result for a putative massive binary system.\nHowever, a system comprising a 37 M$_{\\odot}$ secondary (typical mass of an O5V\nstar) and a 33 M$_{\\odot}$ primary (given the mass ratio) would infer an\ninclination of $\\sim18^\\circ$. We therefore reconsider the previous methods of\nderiving the orbital inclination based on time-dependent polarimetry and\nphotometry. While the polarimetric results are inconclusive requiring better\ndata, the photometric results favour low inclinations. Finally, we compute WR\n148's space velocity and retrace the runaway's trajectory back to the Galactic\nplane (GP). With an ejection velocity of $198\\pm27$ km s$^{-1}$ and a travel\ntime of $4.7\\pm0.8$ Myr to reach its current location, WR 148 was most likely\nejected via dynamical interactions in a young cluster.\n", "  We have studied the spin-wave stiffness of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nhelimagnet FeGe in a temperature range from 225~K up to $T_C \\approx$~278.7~K\nby small-angle neutron scattering. The method we have used is based on [S. V.\nGrigoriev et al. Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{92} 220415(R) (2015)] and was extended\nhere for the application in polycrystalline samples. We confirm the validity of\nthe anisotropic spin-wave dispersion for FeGe caused by the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We have shown that the spin-wave stiffness\n$A$ for FeGe helimagnet decreases with a temperature as $A(T) =\n194(1-0.7(T/T_C)^{4.2})$ meV\\AA$^2$. The finite value of the spin-wave\nstiffness $A = 58$ meV\\AA$^2$ at $T_C$ classifies the order-disorder phase\ntransition in FeGe as being the first order one.\n", "  We show that spin squeezing criteria commonly used for entanglement detection\ncan be erroneous, if the probe is not symmetric. We then derive a lower bound\non squeezing for separable states in spin systems probed asymmetrically. Using\nthis we further develop a procedure that allows us to verify the degree of\nentanglement of a quantum state in the spin system. Finally, we apply our\nmethod for entanglement verification to existing experimental data, and use it\nto prove the existence of tri-partite entanglement in a spin squeezed atomic\nensemble.\n", "  The motion of the solar system with respect to the cosmic rest frame\nmodulates the monopole of the Epoch of Reionization 21-cm signal into a dipole.\nThis dipole has a characteristic frequency dependence that is dominated by the\nfrequency derivative of the monopole signal. We argue that although the signal\nis weaker by a factor of $\\sim100$, there are significant benefits in measuring\nthe dipole. Most importantly, the direction of the cosmic velocity vector is\nknown exquisitely well from the cosmic microwave background and is not aligned\nwith the galaxy velocity vector that modulates the foreground monopole.\nMoreover, an experiment designed to measure a dipole can rely on differencing\npatches of the sky rather than making an absolute signal measurement, which\nhelps with some systematic effects.\n", "  A novel methodology for measuring gas flow from small orifices or nozzles\ninto vacuum is presented. It utilizes a high-intensity femtosecond laser pulse\nto create a plasma within the gas plume produced by the nozzle, which is imaged\nby a microscope. Calibration of the imaging system allows for the extraction of\nabsolute number densities. We show detection down to helium densities of\n$4\\times10^{16}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a spatial resolution of a few micrometer. The\ntechnique is used to characterize the gas flow from a convergent-nozzle aerosol\ninjector [Struct.\\ Dyn.~2, 041717 (2015)] as used in single-particle\ndiffractive imaging experiments at free-electron laser sources. Based on the\nmeasured gas-density profile we estimate the scattering background signal under\ntypical operating conditions of single-particle imaging experiments and\nestimate that fewer than 50 photons per shot can be expected on the detector.\n", "  We present results from the \"Ponos\" simulation suite on the early evolution\nof a massive, $M_{\\rm vir}(z=0)=1.2\\times 10^{13}$ M$_{\\odot}$ galaxy. At\n$z\\gtrsim6$, before feedback from a central supermassive black hole becomes\ndominant, the main galaxy has a stellar mass $\\sim 2\\times 10^{9}$ M$_{\\odot}$\nand a star formation rate $\\sim 20$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The galaxy sits near\nthe expected main sequence of star-forming galaxies at those redshifts, and\nresembles moderately star-forming systems observed at $z>5$. The high specific\nstar formation rate results in vigorous heating and stirring of the gas by\nsupernovae feedback, and the galaxy develops a thick and turbulent disc, with\ngas velocity dispersion $\\sim 40$ km s$^{-1}$, rotation to dispersion ratio\n$\\sim 2$, and with a significant amount of gas at $\\sim 10^5$ K. The Toomre\nparameter always exceeds the critical value for gravito-turbulence, $Q\\sim\n1.5-2$, mainly due to the contribution of warm/hot gas inside the disc. Without\nfeedback, a nearly gravito-turbulent regime establishes with similar gas\nvelocity dispersion and lower $Q$. We propose that the \"hot and turbulent\" disc\nregime seen in our simulations, unlike the \"cold and turbulent\"\ngravito-turbulent regime of massive clumpy disc galaxies at $z\\sim 1-2$, is a\nfundamental characterisation of main sequence galaxies at $z\\gtrsim 6$, as they\ncan sustain star formation rates comparable to those of low-mass starbursts at\n$z=0$. This results in no sustained coherent gas inflows through the disc, and\nin fluctuating and anisotropic mass transport, possibly postponing the assembly\nof the bulge and causing the initial feeding of the central black hole to be\nhighly intermittent.\n", "  Quantum interference of two independent particles in pure quantum states is\nfully described by the particles' distinguishability: the closer the particles\nare to being identical, the higher the degree of quantum interference. When\nmore than two particles are involved, the situation becomes more complex and\ninterference capability extends beyond pairwise distinguishability, taking on a\nsurprisingly rich character. Here, we study many-particle interference using\nthree photons. We show that the distinguishability between pairs of photons is\nnot sufficient to fully describe the photons' behaviour in a scattering\nprocess, but that a collective phase, the triad phase, plays a role. We are\nable to explore the full parameter space of three-photon interference by\ngenerating heralded single photons and interfering them in a fibre tritter.\nUsing multiple degrees of freedom - temporal delays and polarisation - we\nisolate three-photon interference from two-photon interference. Our experiment\ndisproves the view that pairwise two-photon distinguishability uniquely\ndetermines the degree of non-classical many-particle interference.\n", "  There is an increasing interest in the electronic properties of few layer\ngraphene as it offers a platform to study electronic interactions because the\ndispersion of bands can be tuned with number and stacking of layers in\ncombination with electric field. However, electronic interaction becomes\nimportant only in very clean devices and so far the trilayer graphene\nexperiments are understood within non-interacting electron picture. Here, we\nreport evidence of strong electronic interactions and quantum Hall\nferromagnetism (QHF) seen in ABA trilayer graphene (ABA-TLG). Due to high\nmobility $\\sim$500,000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ in our device compared to\nprevious studies, we find all symmetry broken states and that Landau Level (LL)\ngaps are enhanced by interactions; an aspect explained by our self-consistent\nHartree-Fock (H-F) calculations. Moreover, we observe hysteresis as a function\nof filling factor ($\\nu$) and spikes in the longitudinal resistance which,\ntogether, signal the formation of QHF states at low magnetic field.\n", "  The slow-bond problem is a long-standing question about the minimal strength\n$\\epsilon_\\mathrm{c}$ of a local defect with global effects on the\nKardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) universality class. A consensus on the issue has\nbeen delayed due to the discrepancy between various analytical predictions\nclaiming $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{c} = 0$ and numerical observations claiming\n$\\epsilon_\\mathrm{c} > 0$. We revisit the problem via finite-size scaling\nanalyses of the slow-bond effects, which are tested for different boundary\nconditions through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide\nevidence that the previously reported nonzero $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{c}$ is an\nartifact of a crossover phenomenon, which logarithmically converges to zero as\nthe system size goes to infinity.\n", "  We have measured Hall effect, magnetotransport and magnetostriction on the\nfield induced phases of single crystalline UPt$_2$Si$_2$ in magnetic fields up\nto 60\\,T at temperatures down to 50\\,mK. For the magnetic field applied along\nthe $c$ axis we observe strong changes in the Hall effect at the phase\nboundaries. From a comparison to band structure calculations utilizing the\nconcept of a dual nature of the uranium 5$f$ electrons, we find evidence for\nfield induced topological changes of the Fermi surface due to at least one\nLifshitz transition. Furthermore, we find a unique history dependence of the\nmagnetotransport and magnetostriction data, indicating that the Lifshitz type\ntransition is of a discontinuous nature, as predicted for interacting electron\nsystems.\n", "  We compare the kinetic energy and momentum injection rates from intense star\nformation, bolometric AGN radiation, and radio jets with the kinetic energy and\nmomentum observed in the warm ionized gas in 24 powerful radio galaxies at z~2.\nThese galaxies are amongst our best candidates for being massive galaxies near\nthe end of their active formation period, when intense star formation, quasar\nactivity, and powerful radio jets all co-exist. All galaxies have VLT/SINFONI\nimaging spectroscopy of the rest-frame optical line emission, showing\nemission-line regions with large velocity offsets (up to 1500 km/s) and line\nwidths (typically 800-1000 km/s) consistent with very turbulent, often\noutflowing gas. As part of the HeRGE sample, they also have FIR estimates of\nthe star formation and quasar activity obtained with Herschel/PACS and SPIRE,\nwhich enables us to measure the relative energy and momentum release from each\nof the three main sources of feedback in massive, star-forming AGN host\ngalaxies during their most rapid formation phase. We find that star formation\nfalls short by factors 10-1000 of providing the energy and momentum necessary\nto power the observed gas kinematics. The obscured quasars in the nuclei of\nthese galaxies provide enough energy and momentum in about half of the sample,\nhowever, only if these are transfered to the gas relatively efficiently. We\ncompare with theoretical and observational constraints on the efficiency of the\nenergy and momentum transfer from jet and AGN radiation, which advocates that\nthe radio jet is the main driver of the gas kinematics.\n", "  The chimera state with co-existing coherent-incoherent dynamics has recently\nattracted a lot of attention due to its wide applicability. We investigate\nnon-locally coupled identical chaotic maps with delayed interactions in the\nmultiplex network framework and find that an interplay of delay and\nmultiplexing brings about an enhanced or suppressed appearance of chimera state\ndepending on the distribution as well as the parity of delay values in the\nlayers. Additionally, we report a layer chimera state with an existence of one\nlayer displaying coherent and another layer demonstrating incoherent dynamical\nevolution. The rich variety of dynamical behavior demonstrated here can be used\nto gain further insight into the real-world networks which inherently possess\nsuch multi-layer architecture with delayed interactions.\n", "  We compare the low redshift (z ~ 0.1) Lyman-alpha forest from hydrodynamical\nsimulations with data from the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS). We find\ntension between the observed number of lines with b-parameters in the range\n25-45 km/s and the predictions from simulations that incorporate either\nvigorous feedback from active galactic nuclei or that exclude feedback\naltogether. The gas in these simulations is, respectively, either too hot to\ncontribute to the Lyman-alpha absorption or too cold to produce the required\nline widths. Matching the observed b-parameter distribution therefore requires\nfeedback processes that thermally or turbulently broaden the absorption\nfeatures without collisionally (over-)ionising hydrogen. This suggests the\nLyman-alpha forest b-parameter distribution is a valulable diagnostic of\ngalactic feedback in the low redshift Universe. We furthermore confirm the low\nredshift Lyman-alpha forest column density distribution is better reproduced by\nan ultraviolet background with an HI photo-ionisation rate a factor 1.5-3\nhigher than predicted by Haardt & Madau (2012).\n", "  Whether in nature exists Majorana neutrino is one of the most fundamental\nquestions in physics. It is directly related to the violation of accidental\n$U(1)$-lepton number symmetry(LNV). Enormous efforts had been put into such\ntest and among them, one conventional experiment is the neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$). On the other hand, there have been\nproposals of future electron-positron colliders such as International Linear\nCollider (ILC) for precision measurements of Higgs boson or new discovered\nbeyond SM particles and it can potentially be converted into an\nelectron-electron collider. Such collider enables a new probe of Majorana\nneutrino via the inverse $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ process($e^{-}e^{-}\\to W^- W^-$) as\nan alternative and complementary test to the conventional neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay experiments. In this paper, we illustrate the searching\nstrategies of $e^{-}e^{-}\\to W^- W^-$ at future electron colliders, and find\nthat the channels of pure hadronic, semi-leptonic with muon and pure leptonic\nwith muons have the most discovery potential.\n", "  Spin transport in thin-film materials can be studied by ferromagnetic\nresonantly (FMR) driven spin pumping of a charge-free spin current which\ninduces an electromotive force through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). For\nquantitative ISHE experiments, precise control of the FMR driving field\namplitude $B_1$ is crucial. This study exploits in situ monitoring of $B_1$ by\nutilization of electron paramagnetic resonantly (EPR) induced transient\nnutation of paramagnetic molecules (a 1:1 complex of\n{\\alpha},{\\gamma}-bisdiphenylene-{\\beta}-phenylallyl and benzene, BDPA) placed\nas $B_1$ probe in proximity of a NiFe/Pt-based ISHE device. Concurrent to an\nISHE experiment, $B_1$ is obtained from the inductively measured BDPA\nRabi-nutation frequency. Higher reproducibility is achieved by renormalization\nof the ISHE voltage to $B_1^2$ with an accuracy that is determined by the\nhomogeneity of the FMR driving field and thus by the applied microwave\nresonator and ISHE device setup.\n", "  Current and future neutrino experiments can be used to discover dark matter,\nnot only in searches for dark matter annihilating to neutrinos, but also in\nscenarios where dark matter itself scatters off Standard Model particles in the\ndetector. In this work, we study the sensitivity of different neutrino\ndetectors to a class of models called boosted dark matter, in which a\nsubdominant component of a dark sector acquires a large Lorentz boost today\nthrough annihilation of a dominant component in a dark matter-dense region,\nsuch as the galactic center or dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This analysis focuses\non the sensitivity of different neutrino detectors, specifically the\nCherenkov-based Super-K and the future argon-based DUNE to boosted dark matter\nthat scatters off electrons. We study the dependence of the expected limits on\nthe experimental features, such as energy threshold, volume and exposure in the\nlimit of constant scattering amplitude. We highlight experiment-specific\nfeatures that enable current and future neutrino experiments to be a powerful\ntool in finding signatures of boosted dark matter.\n", "  We report measurements of the NMR lineshape of 4.685\\% abundant $^{29}$Si in\nsingle-crystal silicon for four different crystallographic orientations\nrelative to the applied magnetic field. To avoid significant inhomogeneous\nbroadening, the sample crystals are immersed in a susceptibility matched liquid\nand the proton NMR lineshape in the liquid is used to measure the residual\nsusceptibility mismatch and to shim the applied field. The observed lineshapes\nare in good agreement with disorder-averaged spin dynamics simulations\nperformed on a $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ unit cell lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions. The splitting of resolved doublet features is used to measure the\nasymmetry $\\Delta J$ of the nearest-neighbor indirect dipole or J-coupling\ntensor, with the result $\\Delta J=90\\pm20$ Hz. All resolved doublets can be\nidentified with specific nearest and next-nearest neighbor isolated spin pairs\nthat occur in the disorder ensemble.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos can be generated in the early universe through oscillations\nwith active neutrinos and represent a popular and well-studied candidate for\nour universe's dark matter. Stringent constraints from X-ray and gamma-ray line\nsearches, however, have excluded the simplest of such models. In this letter,\nwe propose a novel alternative to the standard scenario in which the mixing\nangle between the sterile and active neutrinos is a dynamical quantity, induced\nthrough interactions with a light axion-like field. As the energy density of\nthe axion-like particles is diluted by Hubble expansion, the degree of mixing\nis reduced at late times, suppressing the decay rate and easily alleviating any\ntension with X-ray or gamma-ray constraints. We present a simple model which\nillustrates the phenomenology of this scenario, and also describe a framework\nin which the QCD axion is responsible for the production of sterile neutrinos\nin the early universe.\n", "  We report a density-matrix renormalization group study of the $t$-$J$ model\nwith nearest ($t_1$ & $J_1$) and next-nearest ($t_2$ & $J_2$) interactions on a\n4-leg cylinder with concentration $\\delta=1/8$ of doped holes. We observe an\nastonishingly complex interplay between uniform $d$-wave superconductivity (SC)\nand strong spin and charge density wave ordering tendencies (SDW and CDW).\nDepending on parameters, the CDWs can be commensurate with period 4 or 8. By\ncomparing the charge ordering vectors with $2 k_F$, we rule out Fermi surface\nnesting-induced density wave order in our model. Magnetic frustration (i.e.\n$J_2/J_1 \\sim 1/2$) significantly quenches SDW correlations with little effect\non the CDW. Typically, the SC order is strongly modulated at the CDW ordering\nvector and exhibits $d$-wave symmetry around the cylinder. There is no evidence\nof a near-degenerate tendency to pair-density wave (PDW) ordering, charge 4e\nSC, or orbital current order.\n", "  We perform transport measurements on double quantum dots defined in Ge/Si\ncore/shell nanowires and focus on Pauli spin blockade in the regime where tens\nof holes occupy each dot. We identify spin blockade through the magnetic field\ndependence of leakage current. We find both a dip and a peak in the leakage\ncurrent at zero field. We analyze this behavior in terms of the quantum dot\nparameters such as coupling to the leads, interdot tunnel coupling as well as\nspin-orbit interaction. We find a lower bound for spin-orbit interaction with\n$l_{\\rm so}=500$ nm. We also extract large and anisotropic effective Land$\\rm\n\\acute{e}$ g-factors, with larger g-factors in the direction perpendicular to\nthe nanowire axis in agreement with previous studies and experiments but with\nlarger values reported here.\n", "  We present thermal properties and an improved shape model for potentially\nhazardous asteroid (162421) 2000 ET70. In addition to the radar data from 2000\nET70's apparition in 2012, our model incorporates optical lightcurves and\ninfrared spectra that were not included in the analysis of Naidu et al. (2013,\nIcarus 226, 323-335). We confirm the general \"clenched fist\" appearance of the\nNaidu et al. model, but compared to their model, our best-fit model is about\n10% longer along its long principal axis, nearly identical along the\nintermediate axis, and about 25% shorter along the short axis. We find the\nasteroid's dimensions to be 2.9 km $\\times$ 2.2 km $\\times$ 1.5 km (with\nrelative uncertainties of about 10%, 15%, and 25%, respectively). With the\navailable data, 2000 ET70's period and pole position are degenerate with each\nother. The radar and lightcurve data together constrain the pole direction to\nfall along an arc that is about twenty-three degrees long and eight degrees\nwide. Infrared spectra from the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) provide\nan additional constraint on the pole. Thermophysical modeling, using our\nSHERMAN software, shows that only a subset of the pole directions, about twelve\ndegrees of that arc, are compatible with the infrared data. Using all of the\navailable data, we find that 2000 ET70 has a sidereal rotation period of 8.944\nhours ($\\pm$ 0.009 h) and a north pole direction of ecliptic coordinates\n$(52^{\\circ}, -60^{\\circ}) \\pm 6^{\\circ}$. The infrared data, acquired over\nseveral dates, require that the thermal properties (albedo, thermal inertia,\nsurface roughness) must change across the asteroid's surface. By incorporating\nthe detailed shape model and spin state into our thermal modeling, the multiple\nground-based observations at different viewing geometries have allowed us to\nconstrain the levels of the variations in the surface properties.\n", "  We are interested in evolution phenomena on star-like networks composed of\nseveral branches which vary considerably in physical properties. The initial\nboundary value problem for singularly perturbed hyperbolic differential\nequation on a metric graph is studied. The hyperbolic equation becomes\ndegenerate on a part of the graph as a small parameter goes to zero. In\naddition, the rates of degeneration may differ in different edges of the graph.\nUsing the boundary layer method the complete asymptotic expansions of solutions\nare constructed and justified.\n", "  We explore the dependence of fermion propagators on the covariant gauge\nfixing parameter in quantum electrodynamics (QED) with the number of spacetime\ndimensions kept explicit. Gauge covariance is controlled by the the\nLandau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation (LKFT). Utilizing its group nature,\nthe LKFT for a fermion propagator in Minkowski space is solved exactly. The\nspecial scenario of 3D is used to test claims made for general cases. When\nrenormalized correctly, a simplification of the LKFT in 4D has been achieved\nwith the help of fractional calculus.\n", "  The low energy band structure near the band gap determines the electrical\nperformance of thermoelectric materials. Here, by using the hybrid-density\nfunctional theory (hybrid-DFT) calculations, we calculate the low energy band\nstructure of Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 in tetradymite phase. We find\nthat the band structure characteristics are very sensitive the selection of the\nexchange energy functional. The predictability of the band gaps and band\ndegeneracies is not enhanced in hybrid-DFT calculations, as compared to DFT\ncalculations. The poor prediction of low energy band structures is originated\nfrom the poor prediction of interlayer distances and the high structure\nsensitivity on the band gap. We conclude that the hybrid DFT calculations are\nnot superior to DFT calculations when predicting band structures of tetradymite\nBi2Te3, Sb2Te3, Bi2Se3 and Sb2Se3 thermoelectric materials.\n", "  The $\\gamma \\gamma^\\ast \\to \\eta_{c,b}$ transition form factors are computed\nusing a continuum approach to the two valence-body bound-state problem in\nrelativistic quantum field theory, and thereby unified with equivalent\ncalculations of electromagnetic pion elastic and transition form factors. The\nresulting $\\gamma \\gamma^\\ast \\to \\eta_c$ form factor, $G_{\\eta_c}(Q^2)$, is\nconsistent with available data: significantly, at accessible momentum\ntransfers, $Q^2 G_{\\eta_c}(Q^2)$ lies well below its conformal limit. These\nobservations confirm that the leading-twist parton distribution amplitudes\n(PDAs) of heavy-heavy bound-states are compressed relative to the conformal\nlimit. A clear understanding of the distribution of valence-quarks within\nmesons thus emerges; a picture which connects Goldstone modes, built from the\nlightest-quarks in Nature, with systems containing the heaviest valence-quarks\nthat can now be studied experimentally, and highlights basic facts about\nmanifestations of mass within the Standard Model.\n", "  We infer gravitational lensing shear and convergence fields from galaxy\nellipticity catalogs under a spatial process prior for the lensing potential.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with simulated\nGaussian-distributed cosmological lensing shear maps and a reconstruction of\nthe mass distribution of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 781 using galaxy\nellipticities measured with the Deep Lens Survey. Given interim posterior\nsamples of lensing shear or convergence fields on the sky, we describe an\nalgorithm to infer cosmological parameters via lens field marginalization. In\nthe most general formulation of our algorithm we make no assumptions about weak\nshear or Gaussian distributed shape noise or shears. Because we require\nsolutions and matrix determinants of a linear system of dimension that scales\nwith the number of galaxies, we expect our algorithm to require parallel\nhigh-performance computing resources for application to ongoing wide field\nlensing surveys.\n", "  We derive a general relation in two-body scattering theory that more directly\nrelates the change of density of states (DDOS) due to interaction to the shape\nof the potential. The relation allows us to infer certain global properties of\nthe DDOS from the global properties of the potential. In particular, we show\nthat DDOS is negative at all energies and for all partial waves, for potentials\nthat are more repulsive than $+1/r^2$ everywhere. This behavior represents a\ndifferent class of global properties of DDOS from that described by the\nLevinson's theorem.\n", "  Utilizing data from the ELVIS and Via Lactea-II simulations, we characterize\nthe local dark matter subhalo population, and use this information to refine\nthe predictions for the gamma-ray fluxes arising from annihilating dark matter\nin this class of objects. We find that the shapes of nearby subhalos are\nsignificantly altered by tidal effects, and are generally not well described by\nNFW density profiles, instead prefering power-law profiles with an exponential\ncutoff. From the subhalo candidates detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space\nTelescope, we place limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section that\nare only modestly weaker than those based on observations of dwarf galaxies. We\nalso calculate the fraction of observable subhalos that are predicted to be\nspatially extended at a level potentially discernible to Fermi.\n", "  Through the study of the power spectra of a monochromatic light beam\nreflected by metallic mirrors, fluctuations in their reflectance is observed.\nThe power spectra were obtained down to a factor $10^{-6}$ below the Standard\nQuantum Limit, with a dynamic range of $10^5$ in the frequency and power, using\nmethods we developed. The properties of the spectra are investigated and their\ndependence on the material is analyzed. The physics underlying the phenomenon\nis also discussed. These fluctuations provide a new window for investigating\nthe inner workings of materials.\n", "  We present a detailed theoretical study of effective spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) Hamiltonians for graphene based systems, covering global effects such as\nproximity to substrates and local SOC effects resulting, for example, from\ndilute adsorbate functionalization. Our approach combines group theory and\ntight-binding descriptions. We consider structures with global point group\nsymmetries $D_{6h}$, $D_{3d}$, $D_{3h}$, $C_{6v}$, and $C_{3v}$ that represent,\nfor example, pristine graphene, graphene mini-ripple, planar boron-nitride,\ngraphene on a substrate and free standing graphone, respectively. The presence\nof certain spin-orbit coupling parameters is correlated with the absence of the\nspecific point group symmetries. Especially in the case of $C_{6v}$---graphene\non a substrate, or transverse electric field---we point out the presence of a\nthird SOC parameter, besides the conventional intrinsic and Rashba\ncontributions, thus far neglected in literature. For all global structures we\nprovide effective SOC Hamiltonians both in the local atomic and Bloch forms.\nDilute adsorbate coverage results in the local point group symmetries $C_{6v}$,\n$C_{3v}$, and $C_{2v}$ which represent the stable adsorption at hollow, top and\nbridge positions, respectively. For each configuration we provide effective SOC\nHamiltonians in the atomic orbital basis that respect local symmetries. In\naddition to giving specific analytic expressions for model SOC Hamiltonians, we\nalso present general (no-go) arguments about the absence of certain SOC terms.\n", "  During the recent developments of quantum theory it has been clarified that\nthe observable quantities (like energy or position) may be represented by\noperators (with real spectra) which are manifestly non-Hermitian. The\nmathematical consistency of the resulting models of stable quantum systems\nrequires a reconstruction of an alternative, amended, physical inner product of\nstates. We point out the less known fact that for more than one observable the\ntask is not always feasible. The difficulty is re-analyzed and its elementary\nlinear-algebraic interpretation and treatment are outlined.\n", "  We study the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in InAs/ GaSb and InAs quantum\nwells. We show through temperature- and gate-dependent magnetotransport\nmeasurements of weak antilocalization that the dominant spin-orbit relaxation\nmechanism in our low-mobility heterostructures is Elliott-Yafet and not\nDyakonov-Perel in the form of the Rashba or Dresselhaus SOI as previously\nsuggested. We compare our findings with recent work on this material system and\nshow that the SOI length lies within the same range. The SOI length may be\ncontrolled using an electrostatic gate, opening up prospects for developing\nspintronic applications.\n", "  We provide a classification of $\\Lambda>0$-vacuum spacetimes which admit a\nKilling vector field with respect to which the associated \"Mars-Simon tensor\"\n(MST) vanishes and having a conformally flat $\\mathcal{J}^-$ (or\n$\\mathcal{J}^+$). To that end, we also give a complete classification of\nconformal Killing vector fields on the $3$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^3$ up to M\\\"obius\ntransformations shedding light on the two fundamental constants that\ncharacterize the family of Kerr-de Sitter-like spacetimes, which turn out to be\nwell-defined geometrical invariants. The topology of $\\mathcal{J}$ is\ndetermined in every case, and a characterization result at $\\mathcal{J}$ of the\nKerr-de Sitter family presented.\n", "  Soft materials consist of basic units that are significantly larger than an\natom but much smaller than the overall dimensions of the sample. The label\n\"soft condensed matter\" emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of\nthese materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material's ability to\nwithstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties\nthat are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft\nmatter is dissipative, disordered, far-from-equilibrium, non-linear, thermal\nand entropic, slow, observable, gravity-affected, patterned, non-local,\ninterfacially elastic and active. This is only a partial list of how matter\ncreated from large component particles is distinct from \"hard matter\" composed\nof constituents at an atomic scale. Issues inherent in soft matter raise\nproblems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require\nmultiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium behavior is\nconfronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics and nuclear physics.\nSimilarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches\nof inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked. This article reviews the\ndiscussions that occurred during a workshop held on January 30-31, 2016 in\nwhich opportunities in soft-matter experiment were surveyed. Soft matter has\nhad an exciting history of discovery and continues to be a fertile ground for\nfuture research.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of the structure of the low-lying\npositive-parity energy spectrum of $^{12}$C from a no-core shell-model\nperspective. The approach utilizes a fraction of the usual shell-model space\nand extends its multi-shell reach via the symmetry-based no-core symplectic\nshell model (NCSpM) with a simple, physically-informed effective interaction.\nWe focus on the ground-state rotational band, the Hoyle state and its $2^+$ and\n$4^+$ excitations, as well as the giant monopole $0^+$ resonance, which is a\nvibrational breathing mode of the ground state. This, in turn, allows us to\naddress the open question about the structure of the Hoyle state and its\nrotational band. In particular, we find that the Hoyle state is best described\nthrough deformed prolate collective modes rather than vibrational modes, while\nwe show that the higher-lying giant monopole $0^+$ resonance resembles the\noblate deformation of the $^{12}$C ground state. In addition, we identify the\ngiant monopole $0^+$ and quadrupole $2^+$ resonances of selected light and\nintermediate-mass nuclei, along with other observables of $^{12}$C, including\nmatter rms radii, electric quadrupole moments, as well as $E2$ and $E0$\ntransition rates.\n", "  We present the first results from the Swift Ultraviolet Survey of the\nMagellanic Clouds (SUMaC), the highest resolution ultraviolet (UV) survey of\nthe Magellanic Clouds yet completed. In this paper, we focus on the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC). When combined with multi-wavelength optical and\ninfrared observations, the three near-UV filters on the Swift\nUltraviolet/Optical Telescope are conducive to measuring the shape of the dust\nextinction curve and the strength of the 2175\\AA\\ dust bump. We divide the SMC\ninto UV-detected star-forming regions and large 200\" (58~pc) pixels and then\nmodel the spectral energy distributions using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method\nto constrain the ages, masses, and dust curve properties. We find that the\nmajority of the SMC has a 2175\\AA\\ dust bump, which is larger to the northeast\nand smaller to the southwest, and that the extinction curve is universally\nsteeper than the Galactic curve. We also derive a star formation history and\nfind evidence for peaks in the star formation rate at 6-10 Myr, 30-80 Myr, and\n400 Myr, the latter two of which are consistent with previous work.\n", "  We discuss the mechanism of cluster formation in a numerical simulation of a\nmolecular cloud (MC) undergoing global hierarchical collapse (GHC). The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination\nwith the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear\nlate in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps. We\ndiscuss the correspondence of these features with observed properties of young\nstellar clusters, finding very good qualitative agreement, thus providing\nsupport to the scenario of global, hierarchical collapse of MCs, while\nexplaining the origin of the observed cluster structure.\n", "  Electron capture can determine the electron neutrino mass, while the beta\ndecay of Tritium measures the electron antineutrino mass and the neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay observes the Majorana neutrino mass. Electron capture e. g.\non 163Ho plus bound electron to 163Dy* plus neutrino can determine the electron\nneutrino mass from the upper end of the decay spectrum of the excited Dy*,\nwhich is given by the Q-Value minus the neutrino mass. The Dy* states decay by\nX-ray and Auger electron emissions. The total decay energy is measured in a\nbolometer. These excitations have been studied by Robertson and by Faessler et\nal.. In addition the daughter atom Dy can also be excited by moving in the\ncapture process one electron into the continuum. The escape of these continuum\nelectrons is automatically included in the experimental bolometer spectrum.\nRecently a method developed by Intemann and Pollock was used by DeRujula and\nLusignoli for a rough estimate of this shake-off process for \"s\" wave electrons\nin capture on 163Ho. The purpose of the present work is to give a more reliable\ndescription of \"s\" wave shake-off in electron capture on Holmium. For that one\nneeds very accurate atomic wave functions of Ho in its ground state and excited\natomic wave functions of Dy* including a description of the continuum\nelectrons. In the present approach the wave functions of Ho and Dy* are\ndetermined selfconsistently with the antisymmetrized relativistic\nDirac-Hartree-Fock approach. The relativistic continuum electron wave functions\nfor the ionized Dy* are obtained in the corresponding selfconsistent\nDirac-Hartree-Fock-Potential. In this improved approach shake-off can hardly be\nseen after electron capture in 163Ho and thus can probably not affect the\ndetermination of the electron neutrino mass.\n", "  It is demonstrated here that local dynamics have the ability to strongly\nmodify the entangling power of unitary quantum gates acting on a composite\nsystem. The scenario is common to numerous physical systems, in which the time\nevolution involves local operators and nonlocal interactions. To distinguish\nbetween distinct classes of gates with zero entangling power we introduce a\ncomplementary quantity called gate-typicality and study its properties.\nAnalyzing multiple applications of any entangling operator interlaced with\nrandom local gates, we prove that both investigated quantities approach their\nasymptotic values in a simple exponential form. This rapid convergence to\nequilibrium, valid for subsystems of arbitrary size, is illustrated by studying\nmultiple actions of diagonal unitary gates and controlled unitary gates.\n", "  We derive a formula for the spacetime volume of a small causal cone. We use\nthis formula within the context of causal set theory to construct causal set\nexpressions for certain geometric quantities relating to a spacetime with a\nspacelike hypersurface. We also consider a scalar field on the causal set, and\nobtain causal set expressions relating to its normal derivatives with respect\nto the hypersurface.\n", "  We carried out a systematic high-precision relativistic study of the\nforbidden magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole transitions in Ca+, Rb, Sr+,\nCs, Ba+, Fr, Ra+, Ac2+, and Th3+. This work is motivated by the importance of\nthese transitions for tests of fundamental physics and precision measurements.\nThe relative importance of the relativistic, correlation, Breit correction, and\ncontributions of negative-energy states is investigated. Recommended values of\nreduced matrix elements are presented together with their uncertainties. The\nmatrix elements and resulting lifetimes are compared with other theoretical\nvalues and with experiment where available.\n", "  We study the rheology of suspensions of ice crystals at moderate to high\nvolume fractions in a sucrose solution in which they are partially soluble; a\nmodel system for a wide class of crystal mushes or slurries. Under step changes\nin shear rate, the viscosity changes to a new `relaxed' value over several\nminutes, in a manner well fitted by a single exponential. The behavior of the\nrelaxed viscosity is power-law shear thinning with shear rate, with an exponent\nof $-1.76 \\pm 0.25$, so that shear stress falls with increasing shear rate. On\nlonger timescales, the crystals ripen (leading to a falling viscosity) so that\nthe mean radius increases with time to the power $0.14 \\pm 0.07$. We speculate\nthat this unusually small exponent is due to the interaction of classical\nripening dynamics with abrasion or breakup under flow. We compare the\nrheological behavior to mechanistic models based on flow-induced aggregation\nand breakup of crystal clusters, finding that the exponents can be predicted\nfrom liquid phase sintering and breakup by brittle fracture.\n", "  Ultralow emittance ($\\leq20$ nm, normalized) electron beams with $10^5$\nelectrons per bunch are obtained by tightly focusing an ultrafast ($\\sim$ 100\nfs) laser pulse on the cathode of a 1.6 cell radiofrequency photoinjector.\nTaking advantage of the small initial longitudinal emittance, a downstream\nvelocity bunching cavity is used to compress the beam to $<10$ fs rms bunch\nlength. The measurement is performed using a thick high voltage deflecting\ncavity which is shown to be well-suited to measure ultrashort durations of\nbunching beams, provided that the beam reaches a ballistic longitudinal focus\nat the cavity center.\n", "  We provide a systematic study for the accretion of a collisionless,\nrelativistic kinetic gas into a nonrotating black hole. To this end, we first\nsolve the relativistic Liouville equation on a Schwarzschild background\nspacetime. The most general solution for the distribution function is given in\nterms of appropriate symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and the\nassociated observables, including the particle current density and stress\nenergy-momentum tensor, are determined. Next, we explore the case where the\nflow is steady-state and spherically symmetric. Assuming that in the asymptotic\nregion the gas is described by an equilibrium distribution function, we\ndetermine the relevant parameters of the accretion flow as a function of the\nparticle density and the temperature of the gas at infinity. In particular, we\nfind that in the low temperature limit the tangential pressure at the horizon\nis about an order of magnitude larger than the radial one, showing explicitly\nthat a collisionless gas, despite exerting kinetic pressure, behaves very\ndifferently than an isotropic perfect fluid, and providing a partial\nexplanation for the known fact that the accretion rate is much lower than in\nthe hydrodynamic case of Bondi-Michel accretion. Finally, we establish the\nasymptotic stability of the steady-state spherical flows by proving pointwise\nconvergence results which show that a large class of (possibly nonstationary\nand nonspherical) initial conditions for the distribution function lead to\nsolutions of the Liouville equation which relax in time to a steady-state,\nspherically symmetric configuration.\n", "  Modulated martensites play an important role in magnetic shape memory alloys,\nbecause all functional properties are closely connected to the twin\nmicrostructure and the phase boundary. The nature of the modulated martensites\nis still unclear. One approach is the concept of adaptive martensite, which\nregards all modulated phases as nanotwinned microstructures. In this article,\nwe use the Ni-Mn-based shape memory alloys as an example to show the geometric\nrationale behind this concept using analytic equations based on the\nphenomenological theory of martensite. This could enhance discussions about the\nimplications of the adaptive martensite by showing the exact relations between\nthe various unit cells used to describe the structure. We use the concept to\ndiscuss the compatibility at the habit plane, the nature of high-order twin\nboundaries and the dependence of the lattice constants on the different types\nof modulation.\n", "  We study the manifestation of the non-perturbative effects of interaction in\nsequential tunnelling between a quasi-one dimensional system of chiral quantum\nHall edge channels and a multilevel quantum dot (QD). We use the formal\nscattering theory approach to the bosonization technique to present an\nalternative derivation of the Fermi-edge singularity (FES) effect and\ndemonstrate the origin of its universality. This approach allows us to address,\nwithin the same framework, plasmon assisted sequential tunnelling to relatively\nlarge dots and investigate the interaction induced level broadening. The\nresults are generalised by taking into account the dispersion in the spectrum\nof plasmons in the QD. We then discuss their modification in the presence of\nneutral modes, which can be realised either in a QD with two chiral strongly\ninteracting edge channels or in a three dimensional QD in the Coulomb blockade\nregime. In the former case a universal behaviour of the tunnelling rate is\ndiscovered.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength analysis of 52 sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs),\nidentified using ALMA 870$\\mu$m continuum imaging in a pilot program to\nprecisely locate bright SCUBA2-selected sub-mm sources in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (UDS) field. Using the available deep (especially near-infrared),\npanoramic imaging of the UDS field at optical-to-radio wavelengths we\ncharacterize key properties of the SMG population. The median photometric\nredshift of the bright ALMA/SCUBA-2 UDS (AS2UDS) SMGs that are detected in a\nsufficient number of wavebands to derive a robust photometric redshift is\n$z$=2.65$\\pm$0.13. However, similar to previous studies, 27% of the SMGs are\ntoo faint at optical-to-near-infrared wavelengths to derive a reliable\nphotometric redshift. Assuming that these SMGs lie at z$\\gtrsim$3 raises the\nmedian redshift of the full sample to $z$=2.9$\\pm$0.2. A subset of 23,\nunlensed, bright AS2UDS SMGs have sizes measured from resolved imaging of their\nrest-frame far-infrared emission. We show that the extent and luminosity of the\nfar-infrared emission are consistent with the dust emission arising from\nregions that are optically thick, on average, at a wavelength of\n$\\lambda_0$$\\ge$75$\\mu$m (1-$\\sigma$ dispersion of 55-90$\\mu$m). Using the dust\nmasses derived from our optically-thick spectral energy distribution models we\ndetermine that these galaxies have a median hydrogen column density of\n$N_{H}$=9.8$_{-0.7}^{+1.4}$$\\times$10$^{23}$cm$^{-2}$, or a corresponding\nmedian $V$-band obscuration of $A_\\mathrm{v}$=540$^{+80}_{-40}$mag, averaged\nalong the line of sight to the source of their restframe $\\sim$200$\\mu$m\nemission. We discuss the implications of this extreme attenuation by dust for\nthe multiwavelength study of dusty starbursts and reddening-sensitive tracers\nof star formation.\n", "  Observational astronomy in the time-domain era faces several new challenges.\nOne of them is the efficient use of observations obtained at multiple epochs.\nThe work presented here addresses faint object detection with multi-epoch data,\nand describes an incremental strategy for separating real objects from\nartifacts in ongoing surveys, in situations where the single-epoch data are\nsummaries of the full image data, such as single-epoch catalogs of flux and\ndirection estimates for candidate sources. The basic idea is to produce\nlow-threshold single-epoch catalogs, and use a probabilistic approach to\naccumulate catalog information across epochs; this is in contrast to more\nconventional strategies based on co-added or stacked image data across all\nepochs. We adopt a Bayesian approach, addressing object detection by\ncalculating the marginal likelihoods for hypotheses asserting there is no\nobject, or one object, in a small image patch containing at most one cataloged\nsource at each epoch. The object-present hypothesis interprets the sources in a\npatch at different epochs as arising from a genuine object; the no-object\n(noise) hypothesis interprets candidate sources as spurious, arising from noise\npeaks. We study the detection probability for constant-flux objects in a\nsimplified Gaussian noise setting, comparing results based on single exposures\nand stacked exposures to results based on a series of single-epoch catalog\nsummaries. Computing the detection probability based on catalog data amounts to\ngeneralized cross-matching: it is the product of a factor accounting for\nmatching of the estimated fluxes of candidate sources, and a factor accounting\nfor matching of their estimated directions. We find that probabilistic fusion\nof multi-epoch catalog information can detect sources with only modest\nsacrifice in sensitivity and selectivity compared to stacking.\n", "  Effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are obtained to describe coherent\nperfect absorbing and lasing boundary conditions. PT -symmetry of the\nHamiltonians enables to design configurations which perfectly absorb at\nmultiple frequencies. Broadened and flat perfect absorption is predicted at the\nexceptional point of PT -symmetry breaking while, for a particular case,\nabsorption is enhanced with the use of gain. The aforementioned phenomena are\nillustrated for acoustic scattering through Helmholtz resonators revealing how\ntailoring the non-Hermiticity of acoustic metamaterials leads to novel\nmechanisms for enhanced absorption.\n", "  In this paper, we present the results of our investigation on the\nmodification of Zitterbewegung due to the noncommutativity of the space-time.\nFirst, we study the effect of $\\kappa$-deformation of the space-time on\nZitterbewegung. For this, we start with the $\\kappa$-deformed Dirac theory and\nusing $\\kappa$-deformed Dirac equation valid upto first order in deformation\nparameter $a$, we find the modification in the Zitterbewegung valid upto first\norder in the deformation parameter $a$. In the limit $a\\rightarrow 0$, we get\nback the commutative result. Secondly, we find the modification in the\nZitterbewegung due to the Magueijo-Smolin(MS) approach of doubly special\nrelativity(DSR) and in the limit $E_p \\rightarrow \\infty$, we get back the\nresult in the commutative space-time.\n", "  Low-temperature electronic properties of rare-earth intermetallics are\nsubstantially influenced by the symmetry and magnitude of the crystal electric\nfield. The direct spectroscopic analysis of crystal field splitting can be\nchallenging, especially in low-dimensional systems, because it requires both\nhigh spectral resolution and pronounced sensitivity. We demonstrate the\neligibility of electronic Raman spectroscopy for this purpose by the direct\ndetermination of the $4f$ level splitting in ultra-thin ordered CePt$_5$ films\ndown to 1.7 nm thickness on Pt(111). Crystal field excitations of Ce $4f$\nelectrons give rise to Raman peaks with energy shifts up to $\\approx$ 25 meV.\nThree distinct peaks occur which we attribute to inequivalent Ce sites, located\n(i) at the interface to the substrate, (ii) next to the Pt-terminated surface,\nand (iii) in the CePt$_5$ layers in between. The well-resolved Raman signatures\nallow us to identify a reduced crystal field splitting at the interface and an\nenhancement at the surface, highlighting its strong dependence on the local\natomic environment.\n", "  A comparative analysis of the special shapes (patterns, profiles) of the\neclipses applied for the phenomenological modeling of the light curves of\neclipsing binary stars is conducted. Families of functions are considered,\ngeneralizing local approximations (Andronov, 2010, 2012) and the functions\ntheoretically unlimited in a width, based on a Gaussian (Mikulasek, 2015). For\nan analysis, the light curve of the star V0882 Car = 2MASS J11080308 - 6145589\nof the classic Algol - subtype (\\beta Persei) is used. By analyzing dozens of\nmodified functions with additional parameters, it was chosen the 14 best ones\naccording to the criterion of the least sum of squares of deviations. The best\nare the functions with an additional parameter, describing profiles, which are\nlimited in phase.\n", "  In this paper, we propose $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}/\\mathrm{YbCoIn_5}$ superlattice\nsystems as a test bed for the reduction of topological classification in free\nfermions. We find that the system with quad-layer of $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ shows\na topological crystalline superconducting phase with the mirror Chern number\neight at the non-interacting level. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the\npresence of two-body interactions, gapless edge modes are no longer protected\nby the symmetry in the system with quad-layer, but are protected in the systems\nwith bi- or tri-layer. This clearly exemplifies the reduction of topological\nclassification from $\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}$ to\n$\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}_8$.\n", "  We study the decays $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ in light of the available\ndata from BABAR, Belle and LHCb. We divide our analysis into two parts: in one\npart we fit the form-factors in these decays directly from the data without\nadding any additional new physics (NP) contributions and compare our fit\nresults with those available from the decays $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\ell\\nu_{\\ell}$.\nWe find that the $q^2$-distributions of the form-factors associated with the\npseudo-vector current, obtained from $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$ and $B\\to\nD^{(\\ast)}\\ell\\nu_{\\ell}$ respectively, do not agree with each other, whereas\nthe other form-factors are consistent with each other. In the next part of our\nanalysis, we look for possible new effective operators of dimension 6 amongst\nnew vector, scalar, and tensor-type that can best explain the current data in\nthe decays $B\\to D^{(\\ast)}\\tau\\nu_{\\tau}$. We use the information-theoretic\napproaches, especially of `Second-order Akaike Information Criterion' (AIC$_c$)\nin the analysis of empirical data. Normality tests for the distribution of\nresiduals are done after selecting the best possible scenarios, for\ncross-validation. We find that it is the contribution from the operator\ninvolving left or right-handed vector current that passes all the selection\ncriteria defined for the best-fit scenario and can successfully accommodate all\nthe available data set.\n", "  The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) is based on the clamped\nnucleus paradigm and solely working with the electronic wavefunctions, so does\nnot include nuclear vibrations in the AIM analysis. On the other hand, the\nrecently extended version of the QTAIM, called the multi-component QTAIM\n(MC-QTAIM), incorporates both electrons and quantum nuclei, i.e. those nuclei\ntreated as quantum waves instead of clamped point charges, into the AIM\nanalysis using non-adiabatic wavefunctions. Thus, the MC-QTAIM is the natural\nframework to incorporate the role of nuclear vibrations into the AIM analysis.\nIn this study, within the context of the MC-QTAIM, the formalism of including\nnuclear vibrational energy in the atomic basin energy is developed in detail\nand its contribution is derived analytically using the recently proposed\nnon-adiabatic Hartree product nuclear wavefunction. It is demonstrated that\nwithin the context of this wavefunction the quantum nuclei may be conceived\npseudo-adiabatically as quantum oscillators and both isotropic harmonic and\nanisotropic anharmonic oscillator models are used to compute the zero-point\nnuclear vibrational energy contribution to the basin energies explicitly.\nInspired by the results gained within the context of the MC-QTAIM analysis, a\nheuristic approach is proposed within the context of the QTAIM to include\nnuclear vibrational energy in the basin energy from the vibrational\nwavefunction derived adiabatically. The explicit calculation of the basin\ncontribution of the zero-point vibrational energy using uncoupled harmonic\noscillator model leads to results consistent with those derived from the\nMC-QTAIM.\n", "  Communication delays and multiplexing are ubiquitous features of real-world\nnetworked systems. We here introduce a simple model where these two features\nare simultaneously present, and report the rich phe- nomenology which is\nactually due to their interplay on cluster synchronization. A delay in one\nlayer has non trivial impacts on the collective dynamics of the other layers,\nenhancing or suppressing synchronization. At the same time, multiplexing may\nalso enhance cluster synchronization of delayed layers. We elucidate several\nnon trivial (and anti-intuitive) scenarios, which are of interest and potential\napplication in various real-world systems, where introduction of a delay may\nrender synchronization of a layer robust against changes in the properties of\nthe other layers.\n", "  We propose a method for using ultracold atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, to\nform an analog model of a relativistic massive field that carries \"charge\" and\ninteracts with an external nondynamical gauge field. Such a \"scalar QED\" analog\nmodel, may be useful for simulating various effects of QFT involving charged\nparticles, such as the Schwinger pair-creation of charged phonons in a constant\nexternal field, and vacuum instability.\n", "  Recent observations of topological spin textures brought spintronics one step\ncloser to new magnetic memories. Nevertheless, the existence of Skyrmions, as\nwell as their stabilization, require very specific intrinsic magnetic\nproperties which are usually fixed in magnets. Here we address the possibility\nto dynamically control their intrinsic magnetic interactions by varying the\nstrength of a high-frequency laser field. It is shown that drastic changes can\nbe induced in the antiferromagnetic exchange interactions and the latter can\neven be reversed to become ferromagnetic, provided the direct exchange is\nalready non-negligible in equilibrium as predicted, for example, in Si doped\nwith C, Sn, or Pb adatoms. In the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions, this enables us to tune features of ferromagnetic Skyrmions such\nas their radius, making them easier to stabilize. Alternatively, such\ntopological spin textures can occur in frustrated triangular lattices. Then, we\ndemonstrate that a high-frequency laser field can induce dynamical frustration\nin antiferromagnets, where the degree of frustration can subsequently be tuned\nsuitably to drive the material toward a Skyrmionic phase.\n", "  We present results of experimental studies of structural, magneto-transport\nand magnetic properties of CoFe-B-Al-O films deposited onto a glass ceramic\nsubstrate by the ion-beam sputtering of the target composed of Co40Fe40B20 and\nAl2O3 plates. The system consists on the strained crystalline CoFe metallic\nnanogranules with the size 2-5 nm which are embedded into the B-Al-O oxide\ninsulating matrix. Our investigations are focused on the anomalous Hall effect\n(AHE) resistivity Rh and longitudinal resistivity R at T=5-200 K on the\nmetallic side of metal-insulator transition in samples with the metal content\nx=49-56 at.%, that nominally corresponds to (Co40Fe40B20)x(Al2O3)100-x in the\nformula approximation. The conductivity at T > 15 K follows the lnT behavior\nthat matches a strong tunnel coupling between nanogranules. It is shown that\nthe scaling power-laws between AHE resistivity and longitudinal resistivity\nstrongly differ, if temperature T or metal content x are variable parameters:\nRh(T)~R(T)^0.4-0.5 obtained from the temperature variation of R and Rh at fixed\nx, while Rh(x)/x~R(x)^0.24, obtained from measurements at the fixed low\ntemperature region (10-40 K) for samples with different x. We qualitatively\ndescribe our experimental data in the frame of phenomenological model of two\nsources of AHE e.m.f. arising from metallic nanogranules and insulating\ntunneling regions, respectively, at that the tunneling AHE (TAHE) source is\nstrongly shunted due to generation of local circular Hall currents. We consider\nour experimental results as the first experimental proof of the TAHE\nmanifestation.\n", "  In this work, we propose two possibilities of CPT-odd and Lorentz-violating\n(LV) nonminimal couplings in the Electroweak sector. These terms are\ngauge-invariant and couple a fixed 4-vector to the physical fields of the\ntheory. After determining the LV contributions to the electroweak currents, we\nreassess the evaluation of the decay rate for the vector mediators $W$ and $Z$.\nUsing the experimental uncertainty in these decay rates, upper bounds of $1$\npart in $10^{-15}$ (eV )$^{-1}$ and $10^{-14}$ (eV )$^{-1}$ are imposed on the\nmagnitude of the proposed nonmimal interactions.\n", "  The superconducting properties of small metallic grains has been a topic of\nactive research for half a century now. Early experiments demonstrated a\nremarkable rise in the critical temperature, $T_{c}$, with reducing grain size\nin a variety of materials. In two dimensional diffusive superconductors,\n$T_{c}$ is decreased due to enhanced Coulomb repulsion. We propose that in\nfinite size grains, the diffusive enhancement of the Coulomb repulsion is\nweakened and leads ultimately to an increase in $T_{c}$ in isolated, disordered\ntwo dimensional grains. Our mechanism is superimposed on the possible\nenhancement in $T_{c}$ due to the change in the density of states of finite\nsize systems.\n", "  The DUET Collaboration reports on the measurements of the absorption\n($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ABS}}$) and charge exchange ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CX}}$) cross\nsections of positively charged pions on carbon nuclei for the momentum range\n201.6 MeV$/c$ to 295.1 MeV$/c$. The uncertainties on the absorption and charge\nexchange cross sections are $\\sim$9.5\\% and $\\sim$18\\%, respectively. The\nresults are in good agreement with previous experiments. A covariance matrix\ncorrelating the 5 $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ABS}}$ and 5 $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{CX}}$ measured\ndata points is also reported\n", "  We discuss the gravitational wave emission and the orbital evolution of a\nhierarchical triple system composed of an inner binary black hole (BBH) and an\nouter tertiary. Depending on the kick velocity at the merger, the merged BBH\ncould tidally disrupt the tertiary. Even though the fraction of BBH mergers\naccompanied by such disruptions is expected to be much smaller than unity, the\nexistence of a tertiary and its basic parameters (e.g. semimajor axis,\nprojected mass) can be examined for more than 1000 BBHs with the space GW\ndetector LISA and its follow-on missions. This allows us to efficiently\nprescreen the targets for the follow-up searches for the tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs). The TDE probability would be significantly higher for triple\nsystems with aligned orbital- and spin-angular momenta, compared with random\nconfigurations.\n", "  The accreting millisecond pulsars IGR J00291+5934 and SAX J1808.4-3658 are\ntwo compact binaries with very similar orbital parameters. The latter has been\nobserved to evolve on a very short timescale of ~70 Myr which is more than an\norder of magnitude shorter than expected. There is an ongoing debate on the\npossibility that the pulsar spin-down power ablates the companion generating\nlarge amount of mass-loss in the system. It is interesting therefore to study\nwhether IGR J00291+5934 does show a similar behaviour as its twin system SAX\nJ1808.4-3658. In this work we present the first measurement of the orbital\nperiod derivative of IGR J00291+5934. By using XMM-Newton data recorded during\nthe 2015 outburst and adding the previous results of the 2004 and 2008\noutbursts, we are able to measure a 90% confidence level upper limit for the\norbital period derivative of -5x10^-13<Pb_dot<6x10^-13. This implies that the\nbinary is evolving on a timescale longer than ~0.5 Gyr, which is compatible\nwith the expected timescale of mass transfer driven by angular momentum loss\nvia gravitational radiation. We discuss the scenario in which the power loss\nfrom magnetic dipole radiation of the neutron star is hitting the companion\nstar. If this model is applied to SAX J1808.4-3658 then the difference in\norbital behavior can be ascribed to a different efficiency for the conversion\nof the spin-down power into energetic relativistic pulsar wind and\nX-ray/gamma-ray radiation for the two pulsars, with IGR J00291+5934 requiring\nan extraordinarily low efficiency of less than 5% to explain the observations.\nAlternatively, the donor in IGR J00291+5934 is weakly/not magnetized which\nwould suppress the possibility of generating mass-quadrupole variations.\n", "  We analyze numerically the formation and the subsequent dynamics of\ntwo-dimensional matter wave dark solitons in a Thomas-Fermi rubidium condensate\nusing various techniques. An initially imprinted sharp phase gradient leads to\nthe dynamical formation of a stationary soliton as well as very shallow grey\nsolitons, whereas a smooth gradient only creates grey solitons. The depth and\nhence, the velocity of the soliton is provided by the spatial width of the\nphase gradient, and it also strongly influences the snake-instability dynamics\nof the two dimensional solitons. The vortex dipoles stemming from the unstable\nsoliton exhibit rich dynamics. Notably, the annihilation of a vortex dipole via\na transient dark lump or a vortexonium state, the exchange of vortices between\neither a pair of vortex dipoles or a vortex dipole and a single vortex, and so\non. For sufficiently large width of the initial phase gradient, the solitons\nmay decay directly into vortexoniums instead of vortex pairs, and also the\ndecay rate is augmented. Later, we discuss alternative techniques to generate\ndark solitons, which involve a Gaussian potential barrier and time-dependent\ninteractions, both linear and periodic. The properties of the solitons can be\ncontrolled by tuning the amplitude or the width of the potential barrier. In\nthe linear case, the number of solitons and their depths are determined by the\nquench time of the interactions. For the periodic modulation, a transient\nsoliton lattice emerges with its periodicity depending on the modulation\nfrequency, through a wave number selection governed by the local Bogoliubov\nspectrum. Interestingly, for sufficiently low barrier potential, both Faraday\npattern and soliton lattice coexist. The snake instability dynamics of the\nsoliton lattice is characteristically modified if the Faraday pattern is\npresent.\n", "  A discrete quantum spin system is presented in which several modern methods\nof canonical quantum gravity can be tested with promising results. In\nparticular, features of interacting dynamics are analyzed with an emphasis on\nhomogeneous configurations and the dynamical building-up and stability of\nlong-range correlations. Different types of homogeneous minisuperspace models\nare introduced for the system, including one based on condensate states, and\nshown to capture different aspects of the discrete system. They are evaluated\nwith effective methods and by means of continuum limits, showing good agreement\nwith operator calculations whenever the latter are available. As a possibly\nquite general result, it is concluded that an analysis of the building-up of\nlong-range correlations in discrete systems requires non-perturbative solutions\nof the dynamical equations. Some questions related to stability can be analyzed\nperturbatively, but suggest that matter couplings may be relevant for this\nquestion in the context of quantum cosmology.\n", "  We study the Casimir vacuum energy density and the Casimir pressure for a\nmassless scalar field confined between two nearby parallel plates in a slightly\ncurved, static spacetime background, employing the weak field approximation in\nthe framework of Extended Theories of Gravity (ETG). Following a perturbative\napproach upto second order, we find the gravity correction in the ETG to\nCasimir vacuum energy density and pressure. The corrections to the vacuum\nenergy density in presence of curved spacetime in the framework of General\nRelativity (GR) are small and today they are still undetected with the current\ntechnology. However, future sensitivity improvement in gravitational\ninterferometer experiments will give an useful tool to detect such effect\ninduced by gravity. For these reason we retain interesting from a theoretical\npoint of view generalize the outcomes of GR in the context of ETG. Finally, we\nfind the general relation to constraining the free parameters of the ETG.\n", "  Time derivatives of scalar fields occur quadratically in textbook actions. A\nsimple Legendre transformation turns the lagrangian into a hamiltonian that is\nquadratic in the momenta. The path integral over the momenta is gaussian. Mean\nvalues of operators are euclidian path integrals of their classical\ncounterparts with positive weight functions. Monte Carlo simulations can\nestimate such mean values.\n  This familiar framework falls apart when the time derivatives do not occur\nquadratically. The Legendre transformation becomes difficult or so intractable\nthat one can't find the hamiltonian. Even if one finds the hamiltonian, it\nusually is so complicated that one can't path-integrate over the momenta and\nget a euclidian path integral with a positive weight function. Monte Carlo\nsimulations don't work when the weight function assumes negative or complex\nvalues.\n  This paper solves both problems. It shows how to make path integrals without\nknowing the hamiltonian. It also shows how to estimate complex path integrals\nby combining the Monte Carlo method with parallel numerical integration and a\nlook-up table. This \"Atlantic City method\" lets one estimate the energy\ndensities of theories that, unlike those with quadratic time derivatives, may\nhave finite energy densities. It may lead to a theory of dark energy.\n  The approximation of multiple integrals over weight functions that assume\nnegative or complex values is the long-standing sign problem. The Atlantic City\nmethod solves it for problems in which numerical integration leads to a\npositive weight function.\n", "  We have developed a new gravitaional-wave (GW) detector, TOrsion-Bar Antenna\n(TOBA), with multiple-output configuration. TOBA is a detector with bar-shaped\ntest masses that rotate by the tidal force of the GWs. In our detector, three\nindependent information about the GW signals can be derived by monitoring\nmultiple rotational degrees of freedom, i.e., horizontal rotations and vertical\nrotations of the bars. Since the three outputs have different antenna pattern\nfunctions, the multi-output system improves the detection rate and the\nparameter estimation accuracy. It is effective in order to obtain further\ndetails of the GW sources, such as population and directions. We successfully\noperated the multi-output detector continuously for more than 24 hours with\nstable data quality. Also, the sensitivity of one of the signals is improved to\nbe $1 \\times 10^{-10}$ ${\\rm Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 3 Hz by the combination of the\npassive and active vibration isolation systems, while sensitivities to possible\nGW signals derived from the vertical rotations are worse than that from the\nhorizontal rotation.\n", "  We present high-statistics estimates of the isovector charges of the nucleon\nfrom four 2+1-flavor ensembles generated using Wilson-clover fermions with\nstout smearing and tree-level tadpole improved Symanzik gauge action at lattice\nspacings $a=0.114$ and $0.080$ fm and with $M_\\pi \\approx 315$ and 200 MeV. The\ntruncated solver method with bias correction and the coherent source sequential\npropagator construction are used to cost-effectively achieve $O(10^5)$\nmeasurements on each ensemble. Using these data, the analysis of two-point\ncorrelation functions is extended to include four states in the fits and of\nthree-point functions to three states. Control over excited-state contamination\nin the calculation of the nucleon mass, the mass gaps between excited states,\nand in the matrix elements is demonstrated by the consistency of estimates\nusing this multistate analysis of the spectral decomposition of the correlation\nfunctions and from simulations of the three-point functions at multiple values\nof the source-sink separation. The results for all three charges, $g_A$, $g_S$\nand $g_T$, are in good agreement with calculations done using the\nclover-on-HISQ lattice formulation with similar values of the lattice\nparameters.\n", "  We investigate the open dynamics of a quantum system when it is rapidly\nrepeatedly updated by a quantum channel. Specifically, we analyze when this\ndynamics can purify the system. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor such purification effects to occur and characterize their strength. We\nthoroughly analyze the specific scenario of a quantum system undergoing rapid\nunitary interactions with a sequence of ancillary quantum systems. We find that\nwhile the purification effects are generally present, in order for these\neffects to be strong compared to the decoherence effects the interaction\nHamiltonian must have a minimum degree of complexity. Specifically, a tensor\nproduct interaction $\\hat{Q}_\\text{S}\\otimes\\hat{R}_\\text{A}$, as well as many\ncommon light-matter interactions cannot purify efficiently.\n", "  Parameter estimates of GW150914 were obtained using Bayesian inference, based\non three semi-analytic waveform models for binary black hole coalescences.\nThese waveform models differ from each other in their treatment of black hole\nspins, and all three models make some simplifying assumptions, notably to\nneglect sub-dominant waveform harmonic modes and orbital eccentricity.\nFurthermore, while the models are calibrated to agree with waveforms obtained\nby full numerical solutions of Einstein's equations, any such calibration is\naccurate only to some non-zero tolerance and is limited by the accuracy of the\nunderlying phenomenology, availability, quality, and parameter-space coverage\nof numerical simulations. This paper complements the original analyses of\nGW150914 with an investigation of the effects of possible systematic errors in\nthe waveform models on estimates of its source parameters. To test for\nsystematic errors we repeat the original Bayesian analyses on mock signals from\nnumerical simulations of a series of binary configurations with parameters\nsimilar to those found for GW150914. Overall, we find no evidence for a\nsystematic bias relative to the statistical error of the original parameter\nrecovery of GW150914 due to modeling approximations or modeling inaccuracies.\nHowever, parameter biases are found to occur for some configurations disfavored\nby the data of GW150914: for binaries inclined edge-on to the detector over a\nsmall range of choices of polarization angles, and also for eccentricities\ngreater than $\\sim$0.05. For signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than\nGW150914, or in other regions of the binary parameter space (lower masses,\nlarger mass ratios, or higher spins), we expect that systematic errors in\ncurrent waveform models may impact gravitational-wave measurements, making more\naccurate models desirable for future observations.\n", "  We develop a rigorous theoretical framework to describe light-sound\ninteraction in the laser-pumped periodic multiple-quantum-well structure\naccounting for the hybrid phonon-polariton excitations, termed as phonoritons.\nWe show that phonoritons exhibit the pumping-induced synthetic magnetic field\nin the artificial \"coordinate-energy\" space, that makes transmission of left-\nand right- going waves different. The transmission nonreciprocity allows to use\nsuch phonoritonic crystals with realistic parameters as optically controlled\nnanoscale acoustic diodes.\n", "  We investigate the current-induced spin-orbit torque in thin topological\ninsulator (TI) films in the presence of hybridization between the top and\nbottom surface states. We formulate the relation between spin torque and TI\nthickness, from which we derived the optimal value of the thickness to maximize\nthe torque. We show numerically that in typical TI thin films made of\n$\\mathrm{Bi_2Se_3}$, the optimal thickness is about 3-5 nm.\n", "  Kinematic edges of cascade decays of new particles produced in high-energy\ncollisions may provide important constraints on the involved particles' masses.\nFor the exemplary case of gluino decay $\\tilde{g}\\to q\\bar q \\tilde{\\chi}$ into\na pair of quarks and a neutralino through a squark resonance, we study the\nhadronic invariant mass distribution in the vicinity of the kinematic edge. We\nperform a next-to-leading order calculation in the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$\nand the ratio of squark width and squark mass $\\Gamma_\\tilde{q}/m_\\tilde{q}$,\nbased on a systematic expansion in $\\Gamma_\\tilde{q}/m_\\tilde{q}$. The\nseparation into hard, collinear and soft contributions elucidates the process\ndependent and universal features of distributions in the edge region,\nrepresented by on-shell decay matrix elements, universal jet functions and a\nsoft function that depends on the resonance propagator and soft Wilson lines.\n", "  RR Lyrae stars may be the best practical tracers of Galactic halo\n(sub-)structure and kinematics. The PanSTARRS1 (PS1) $3\\pi$ survey offers\nmulti-band, multi-epoch, precise photometry across much of the sky, but a\nrobust identification of RR Lyrae stars in this data set poses a challenge,\ngiven PS1's sparse, asynchronous multi-band light curves ($\\lesssim 12$ epochs\nin each of five bands, taken over a 4.5-year period). We present a novel\ntemplate fitting technique that uses well-defined and physically motivated\nmulti-band light curves of RR Lyrae stars, and demonstrate that we get accurate\nperiod estimates, precise to 2~sec in $>80\\%$ of cases. We augment these light\ncurve fits with other {\\em features} from photometric time-series and provide\nthem to progressively more detailed machine-learned classification models. From\nthese models we are able to select the widest ($3/4$ of the sky) and deepest\n(reaching 120 kpc) sample of RR Lyrae stars to date. The PS1 sample of $\\sim\n45,000$ RRab stars is pure (90\\%), and complete (80\\% at 80 kpc) at high\ngalactic latitudes. It also provides distances precise to 3\\%, measured with\nnewly derived period-luminosity relations for optical/near-infrared PS1 bands.\nWith the addition of proper motions from {\\em Gaia} and radial velocity\nmeasurements from multi-object spectroscopic surveys, we expect the PS1 sample\nof RR Lyrae stars to become the premier source for studying the structure,\nkinematics, and the gravitational potential of the Galactic halo. The\ntechniques presented in this study should translate well to other sparse,\nmulti-band data sets, such as those produced by the Dark Energy Survey and the\nupcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Galactic plane sub-survey.\n", "  We present for the first time the complete twist-4 result for the\nsemi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering $e^- N \\to e^-qX$ with polarized\nelectron and proton beams at the tree level of pQCD. The calculations have been\ncarried out using the formulism obtained after collinear expansion where the\nmultiple gluon scattering are taken into account and gauge links are obtained\nautomatically in a systematical way. The results show in particular that there\nare twist-4 contributions to all the eight twist-2 structure functions for $e^-\nN \\to e^-hX$ that correspond to the eight twist-2 transverse momentum dependent\nparton distribution functions. Such higher twist effects could be very\nsignificant and therefore have important impacts on extracting these\nthree-dimensional parton distribution functions from the asymmetry data on $e^-\nN \\to e^-hX$. We suggest also an approximate way for a rough estimation of such\nhigher twist contributions.\n", "  We present a new calculation of the mass and width of the exotic $0^{--}$\nglueball in the framework of the QCD sum rules. We next construct a new current\nwhich couples to a pure $0^{--}$ gluon state and derive consistent and stable\nsum rules. A previously used current in this approach was shown to be\ninconsistent. We obtain for this state a mass $M_G=6.3^{+0.8}_{-1.1}$ GeV and\nan upper limit for the total width $\\Gamma_G\\leq 235$ MeV. These values can be\nused as an important guide for the experimental search of this exotic state. We\nargue that the mixing of this glueball state with $0^{--}$ tetraquark is very\nsmall. Therefore, the exotic $0^{--}$ glueball can be considered as a pure\ngluon state.\n", "  The merger rate of black hole binaries inferred from the detections in the\nfirst Advanced LIGO science run, implies that a stochastic background produced\nby a cosmological population of mergers will likely mask the primordial\ngravitational-wave background. Here we demonstrate that the next generation of\nground-based detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer,\nwill be able to observe binary black hole mergers throughout the universe with\nsufficient efficiency that the confusion background can potentially be\nsubtracted to observe the primordial background at the level of\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{GW}} \\simeq 10^{-13}$ after five years of observation.\n", "  Interferometric gravitational wave detectors operate with high optical power\nin their arms in order to achieve high shot-noise limited strain sensitivity. A\nsignificant limitation to increasing the optical power is the phenomenon of\nthree-mode parametric instabilities, in which the laser field in the arm\ncavities is scattered into higher order optical modes by acoustic modes of the\ncavity mirrors. The optical modes can further drive the acoustic modes via\nradiation pressure, potentially producing an exponential buildup. One proposed\ntechnique to stabilize parametric instability is active damping of acoustic\nmodes. We report here the first demonstration of damping a parametrically\nunstable mode using active feedback forces on the cavity mirror. A 15,538 Hz\nmode that grew exponentially with a time constant of 182 sec was damped using\nelectro-static actuation, with a resulting decay time constant of 23 sec. An\naverage control force of 0.03 nNrms was required to maintain the acoustic mode\nat its minimum amplitude.\n", "  Subtracted geometries are black hole solutions of the four dimensional STU\nmodel with rather interesting ties to asymptotically flat black holes. A\npeculiar feature is that the solutions to the Klein-Gordon equation on this\nsubtracted background can be organized according to representations of the\nconformal group $SO(2,2)$. We test if this behavior persists for the linearized\nfluctuations of gravitational and matter fields on static, electrically charged\nbackgrounds of this kind. We find that there is a subsector of the modes that\ndo display conformal symmetry, while some modes do not. We also discuss two\ndifferent effective actions that describe these subtracted geometries and how\nthe spectrum of quasinormal modes is dramatically different depending upon the\naction used.\n", "  The advent of next generation radio telescope facilities, such as the Square\nKilometer Array (SKA), will usher in an era where a Pulsar Timing Array (PTA)\nbased search for gravitational waves (GWs) will be able to use hundreds of well\ntimed millisecond pulsars rather than the few dozens in existing PTAs. A\nrealistic assessment of the performance of such an extremely large PTA must\ntake into account the data analysis challenge posed by an exponential increase\nin the parameter space volume due to the large number of so-called pulsar phase\nparameters. We address this problem and present such an assessment for isolated\nsupermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) searches using a SKA era PTA containing\n$10^3$ pulsars. We find that an all-sky search will be able to confidently\ndetect non-evolving sources with redshifted chirp mass of $10^{10}$ $M_\\odot$\nout to a redshift of about $28$ (corresponding to a rest-frame chirp mass of\n$3.4\\times 10^{8}$ $M_\\odot$). We discuss the important implications that the\nlarge distance reach of a SKA era PTA has on GW observations from optically\nidentified SMBHB candidates. If no SMBHB detections occur, a highly unlikely\nscenario in the light of our results, the sky-averaged upper limit on strain\namplitude will be improved by about three orders of magnitude over existing\nlimits.\n", "  In this paper, we present a framework for assessing the effect of\nnon-stationary Gaussian noise and radio frequency interference (RFI) on the\nsignal to noise ratio, the number of false positives detected per true positive\nand the sensitivity of standard pulsar search pipelines. The results highlight\nthe necessity to develop algorithms that are able to identify and remove\nnon-stationary variations from the data before RFI excision and searching is\nperformed in order to limit false positive detections. The results also show\nthat the spectrum whitening algorithms currently employed, severely affect the\nefficiency of pulsar search pipelines by reducing their sensitivity to long\nperiod pulsars.\n", "  We study the optical and near-infrared luminosities and detectability of\nradioactively powered electromagnetic transients ('macronovae') occuring in the\naftermath of binary neutron star and neutron star black hole mergers. We\nexplore the transients that result from the dynamic ejecta and those from\ndifferent types of wind outflows. Based on full nuclear network simulations we\ncalculate the resulting light curves in different wavelength bands. We\nscrutinize the robustness of the results by comparing a) two different nuclear\nreaction networks and b) two macronova models. We explore in particular how\nsensitive the results are to the production of alpha-decaying trans-lead\nnuclei. We compare two frequently used mass models: the Finite-Range Droplet\nModel (FRDM) and the nuclear mass model of Duflo and Zuker (DZ31). We find that\nthe abundance of alpha-decaying trans-lead nuclei has a significant impact on\nthe observability of the resulting macronovae. For example, the DZ31 model\nyields considerably larger abundances resulting in larger heating rates and\nthermalization efficiencies and therefore predicts substantially brighter\nmacronova transients. We find that the dynamic ejecta from NSNS models can\nreach peak K-band magnitudes in excess of -15 while those from NSBH cases can\nreach beyond -16. Similar values can be reached by some of our wind models.\nSeveral of our models (both wind and dynamic ejecta) yield properties that are\nsimilar to the transient that was observed in the aftermath of the short GRB\n130603B. We further explore the expected macronova detection frequencies for\ncurrent and future instruments such as VISTA, ZTF and LSST.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection and non-thermal particle distributions associated with\ncurrent-driven instabilities are investigated by means of resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations combined with relativistic test particle\nmethods. We propose a system with two parallel, repelling current channels in\nan initially force-free equilibrium, as a simplified representation of flux\nropes in a stellar magnetosphere. The current channels undergo a rotation and\nseparation on Alfv\\'enic timescales, forming secondary islands and (up to\ntearing unstable) current sheets in which non-thermal energy distributions are\nexpected to develop. Using the recently developed particle module of our\nopen-source grid-adaptive MPI-AMRVAC software, we simulate MHD evolution\ncombined with test particle treatments in MHD snapshots. We explore under which\nplasma-$\\beta$ conditions the fastest reconnection occurs in two-and-a-half\ndimensional (2.5D) scenarios and in these settings test particles are evolved.\nWe quantify energy distributions, acceleration mechanisms, relativistic\ncorrections to the particle equations of motion and effects of resistivity in\nmagnetically dominated proton-electron plasmas. Due to large resistive electric\nfields and indefinite acceleration of particles in the infinitely long current\nchannels, hard energy spectra are found in 2.5D configurations. Solutions to\nthese numerical artifacts are proposed for both 2.5D setups and future 3D work.\nWe discuss the magnetohydrodynamics of an additional kink instability in 3D\nsetups and the expected effects on energy distributions. The obtained results\nhold as a proof-of-principle for test particle approaches in MHD simulations,\nrelevant to explore less idealised scenarios like solar flares and more exotic\nastrophysical phenomena, like black hole flares, magnetar magnetospheres and\npulsar wind nebulae.\n", "  We study two-dimensional F(R) Horava-Lifshitz gravity from the Hamiltonian\npoint of view. We determine constraints structure with emphasis on the careful\nseparation of the second class constraints and global first class constraints.\nWe determine number of physical degrees of freedom and also discuss gauge\nfixing of the global first class constraints.\n", "  The ground state properties of spin-1/2 ladders are studied, emphasizing the\nrole of frustration and ring exchange coupling. We present a unified field\ntheory for ladders with general coupling constants and geometry. Rich phase\ndiagrams can be deduced by using a renormalization group calculation for\nladders with in--chain next nearest neighbor interactions and plaquette ring\nexchange coupling. In addition to established phases such as Haldane, rung\nsinglet, and dimerized phases, we also observe a surprising instability towards\nan incommensurate phase for weak interchain couplings, which is characterized\nby an exotic coexistence of self-consistent ferromagnetic and\nanti-ferromagnetic order parameters.\n", "  We study dusty winds driven by radiation pressure in the atmosphere of a\nrapidly star-forming environment. We apply the variable Eddington tensor\nalgorithm to re-examine the two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic problem of a\ncolumn of gas that is accelerated by a constant infrared radiation flux. In the\nabsence of gravity, the system is primarily characterized by the initial\noptical depth of the gas. We perform several runs with different initial\noptical depth and resolution. We find that the gas spreads out along the\nvertical direction, as its mean velocity and velocity dispersion increase. In\ncontrast to previous work using flux-limited diffusion algorithm, we find\nlittle evolution in the trapping factor. The momentum coupling between\nradiation and gas in the absence of gravity is similar to that with gravity.\nFor Eddington ratio increasing with the height in the system, the momentum\ntransfer from the radiation to the gas is not merely $\\sim L/c$, but amplified\nby a factor of $1+\\eta \\tau_{\\rm IR}$, where $\\tau_{\\rm IR}$ is the integrated\ninfrared optical depth through the system, and $\\eta\\sim0.5-0.9$, decreasing\nwith the optical depth. We apply our results to the atmosphere of galaxies and\nconclude that radiation pressure may be an important mechanism for driving\nwinds in the most rapidly star-forming galaxies and starbursts.\n", "  We explore routes to realize electrically driven Bose-Einstein condensation\nof magnons in insulating antiferromagnets. Even in insulating antiferromagnets,\nthe localized spins can strongly couple to itinerant spins in adjacent metals\nvia spin-transfer torque and spin pumping. We describe the formation of\nsteady-state magnon condensates controlled by a spin accumulation polarized\nalong the staggered field in an adjacent normal metal. Two types of magnons\nexist in antiferromagnets, which carry opposite magnetic moments. Consequently,\nand in contrast to ferromagnets, Bose-Einstein condensation can occur for\neither sign of the spin accumulation. This condensation may occur even at room\ntemperature when the interaction with the normal metal is fast compared to the\nrelaxation processes within the antiferromagnet. In antiferromagnets, the\noperating frequencies of the condensate are orders of magnitude faster than in\nferromagnets.\n", "  We analyze the complex level structure of ions with many-valence-electron\nopen [Kr] 4$d^\\textrm{m}$ sub-shells ($\\textrm{m}$=7-4) with ab initio\ncalculations based on configuration-interaction many-body perturbation theory\n(CI+MBPT). Charge-state-resolved optical and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra\nof Sn$^{7+}$-Sn$^{10+}$ ions were obtained using an electron beam ion trap.\nSemi-empirical spectral fits carried out with the orthogonal parameters\ntechnique and Cowan code calculations lead to 90 identifications of\nmagnetic-dipole transitions and the determination of 79 energy\nground-configuration levels, questioning some earlier EUV-line assignments. Our\nresults, the most complete data set available to date for these ground\nconfigurations, confirm the ab initio predictive power of CI+MBPT calculations\nfor the these complex electronic systems.\n", "  The `fundamental plane of black hole accretion' (FP), a relation between the\nradio luminosities ($L_R$), X-ray luminosities ($L_X$), and masses ($M_{BH}$)\nof hard/quiescent state black hole binaries and low-luminosity active galactic\nnuclei, suggests some aspects of black hole accretion may be scale invariant.\nHowever, key questions still exist concerning the relationship between the\ninflow/outflow behaviour in the `classic' hard state and quiescence, which may\nimpact this scaling. We show that the broadband spectra of A0620-00\nand~\\sgra~(the least luminous stellar mass/supermassive black holes on the FP)\ncan be modelled simultaneously with a physically-motivated outflow-dominated\nmodel where the jet power and all distances are scaled by the black hole mass.\nWe find we can explain the data of both A0620-00 and~\\sgra~(in its non-thermal\nflaring state) in the context of two outflow-model scenarios: (1) a\nsynchrotron-self-Compton dominated state in which the jet plasma reaches highly\nsub-equipartition conditions (for the magnetic field with respect to that of\nthe radiating particles), and (2) a synchrotron dominated state in the\nfast-cooling regime in which particle acceleration occurs within the inner few\ngravitational radii of the black hole and plasma is close to equipartition. We\nshow that it may be possible to further discriminate between models (1) and (2)\nthrough future monitoring of its submm/IR/X-ray emission, in particular via\ntime lags between the variable emission in these bands.\n", "  We investigate the ordering dynamics of the voter model with time-delayed\ninteractions. The dynamical process in the $d$-dimensional lattice is shown to\nbe equivalent to the first passage problem of a random walker in the\n$(d+1)$-dimensional strip of a finite width determined by the delay time. The\nequivalence reveals that the time delay leads to the dimensional crossover from\nthe $(d+1)$-dimensional scaling behavior at short time to the $d$-dimensional\nscaling behavior in the long time. The scaling property in both regimes and the\ncrossover time scale are obtained analytically, which are confirmed with the\nnumerical simulation results.\n", "  We present a general method for constructing effective field theories for\nnon-relativistic superfluids, generalizing the previous approaches of Greiter,\nWitten, and Wilczek, and Son and Wingate to the case of several superfluids in\nsolution. We investigate transport in mixtures with broken parity and find a\nparity odd \"Hall drag\" in the presence of independent motion as well as a\npinning of mass, charge, and energy to sites of nonzero relative velocity. Both\neffects have a simple geometric interpretation in terms of the signed volumes\nand directed areas of various sub-complexes of a \"velocity polyhedron\": the\nconvex hull formed by the endpoints of the velocity vectors of a superfluid\nmixture. We also provide a simple quasi-one-dimensional model that exhibits\nnon-zero Hall drag.\n", "  We propose a possible way to realize topological superconductivity with\napplication of laser light to superconducting cuprate thin films. Applying\nFloquet theory to a model of $d$-wave superconductors with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling, we derive an effective model and discuss its topological nature.\nInterplay of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the laser light effect induces\nthe synthetic magnetic fields, thus making the system gapped. Then the system\nacquires the topologically non-trivial nature which is characterized by Chern\nnumbers. The effective magnetic fields do not create the vortices in\nsuperconductors, and thus the proposed scheme provides a promising way to\ndynamically realize a topological superconductor in cuprates. We also discuss\nan experimental way to detect the signature.\n", "  We present ALMA Band 6 observations (1.3 mm/233 GHz) of Fomalhaut and its\ndebris disc. The observations achieve a sensitivity of 17 $\\mu$Jy and a\nresolution of 0.28 arcsec (2.1 au at a distance of 7.66 pc), which are the\nhighest resolution observations to date of the millimetre grains in Fomalhaut's\nmain debris ring. The ring is tightly constrained to $139^{+2}_{-3}$ au with a\nFWHM of $13\\pm3$ au, following a Gaussian profile. The millimetre spectral\nindex is constrained to $\\alpha_{mm} = -2.62\\pm0.12$. We explore fitting debris\ndisc models in the image plane, as well as fitting models using visibility data\ndirectly. The results are compared and the potential advantages/disadvantages\nof each approach are discussed.\n  The detected central emission is indistinguishable from a point source, with\na most probable flux of $0.90\\pm 0.12$ mJy (including calibration\nuncertainties). This implies that any inner debris structure, as was inferred\nfrom far-Infrared observations, must contribute little to the total central\nemission. Moreover, the stellar flux is less than 70\\% of that predicted by\nextrapolating a black body from the constrained stellar photosphere\ntemperature. This result emphasizes that unresolved inner debris components\ncannot be fully characterized until the behaviour of the host star's intrinsic\nstellar emission at millimetre wavelengths is properly understood.\n", "  We examine the properties of the Magellanic Bridge connecting the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds using ab-type RR Lyrae variables from the extensive\ndataset of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), Phase IV data\nrelease. The metallicities of the RR Lyraes are determined from the\ncharacteristics of their light curves, with an average abundance of [Fe/H] =\n-1.790 +/- 0.011 (sem) in the Magellanic Bridge. From the individual reddenings\nof these stars, derived via their minimum light curve colors, we determined a\nmedian color excess of E(V-I) = 0.101 +/- 0.007 (sem) (implying E(B-V)\n$\\approx$ 0.077). The peak distance modulus of 18.57 +/- 0.048 (sem) places the\nBridge stars at distances between the two systems. The metallicity and distance\ndistributions probe the structure of the Magellanic system as a whole,\nrevealing a smooth transition that connects the galaxies. An examination of the\nHI content does not find a clear correlation between HI emission strength and\nRR Lyrae spatial distribution, suggesting that the old stellar populations may\ntrace the overlapping halo distributions of the two Magellanic Clouds.\n", "  Under the assumption that jets explode core collapse supernovae in a negative\njet feedback mechanism (JFM), I show that rapidly rotating neutron stars are\nlikely to be formed when the explosion is very energetic. Under the assumption\nthat an accretion disk or an accretion belt around the just-formed neutron star\nlaunch jets and that the accreted gas spins-up the just-formed neutron star, I\nderive a crude relation between the energy that is stored in the spinning\nneutron star and the explosion energy. This relation reads\nEspin/Eexp~(Eexp/1e52erg). It shows that within the frame of the JFM explosion\nmodel of core collapse supernovae, spinning neutron stars, such as magnetars,\nmight have significant energy in super-energetic explosions. The existence of\nmagnetars, if confirmed, such as in the recent super-energetic supernova\nGAIA16apd, further supports the call for a paradigm shift from neutrino-driven\nto jet-driven core-collapse supernova mechanisms.\n", "  Signatures of Majorana fermion bound states in one-dimensional topological\ninsulator (TI) nanowires with proximity effect induced superconductivity are\nstudied. The phase diagram and energy spectra are calculated for single TI\nnanowires and it is shown that the nanowires can be in the topological\ninvariant phases of winding numbers $W=0, \\pm 1$, and $\\pm 2$ corresponding to\nthe cases with zero, one and two pairs of Majorana fermions in the single TI\nnanowires. It is also shown that the topological winding numbers, i.e., the\nnumbers of pairs of Majorana fermions in the TI nanowires can be extracted from\nthe transport measurements of a Josephson junction device made from two TI\nnanowires, while the sign in the winding numbers can be extracted using a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) setup.\n", "  Motivated by the latest results of the LHC Run-2 and LUX experiments, we\nexamine the status of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model\n(CMSSM) by performing a global fit. We construct a likelihood function\nincluding the electroweak precision observables, $B$-physics measurements, LHC\nRun-1 and -2 data of SUSY direct searches, Planck observation of the dark\nmatter relic density and the combined LUX Run-3 and -4 detection limits. Based\non the profile likelihood functions of 1 billion samples, we obtain the\nfollowing observations: (i) The stau coannihilation region has been mostly\nexcluded by the latest LHC Run-2 data; (ii) The focus point region has been\nlargely covered by the LUX-2016 limits while the $A$-funnel region has been\nseverely restricted by flavor observables like $B_s \\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$. The\nremaining parts of both regions will be totally covered by the future LZ dark\nmatter experiment; (iii) The masses of the stop, the lightest neutralino and\nthe gluino have been pushed up to 1033 GeV, 449 GeV and 2285 GeV, respectively.\n", "  This paper summarizes the results obtained by the team \"Heliosheath Processes\nand the Structure of the Heliopause: Modeling Energetic Particles, Cosmic Rays,\nand Magnetic Fields\" supported by the International Space Science Institute in\nBern, Switzerland. We focus on the physical processes occurring in the outer\nheliosphere, especially at its boundary called the heliopause (HP), and in the\nLISM. The importance of magnetic field, charge exchange between atoms and ions,\nand solar cycle on the heliopause topology and observed heliocentric distances\nto different heliospheric discontinuities are discussed. It is shown that\ntime-dependent boundary conditions are necessary to describe the heliospheric\nasymmetries detected by the Voyager spacecraft. We also discuss the structure\nof the HP, especially due to its instability and magnetic reconnection. It is\ndemonstrated that the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the nose of the HP creates\nconsecutive layers of the interstellar and heliospheric plasma which are\nmagnetically connected to different sources. This may be a possible explanation\nof abrupt changes in the galactic and anomalous cosmic ray fluxes observed by\nVoyager 1 when it was crossing the HP structure for a period of about one month\nin the summer of 2012. This paper also discusses the plausibility of fitting\nsimulation results to a number of observational data sets obtained by in situ\nand remote measurements. The distribution of magnetic field in the vicinity of\nthe HP is discussed in the context of Voyager measurements. We discuss the\ntransport of energetic particles in the inner and outer heliosheath,\nconcentrating on the anisotropic spatial diffusion diffusion tensor and the\npitch-angle dependence of perpendicular diffusion and demonstrate that the\nlatter can explain the observed pitch-angle anisotropies of both the anomalous\nand galactic cosmic rays in the outer heliosheath.\n", "  We present time series photometry of Bienor in four observation campaigns\nfrom 2013 to 2016 and compare them with previous observations in the literature\ndating back to 2000. The results show a remarkable decline in the amplitude of\nthe rotational light curve and in the absolute magnitude. This suggests that\nthe angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight has changed\nnoticeably during the last 16 years as Bienor orbits the Sun. From the light\ncurve amplitude data we are able to determine the orientation of the rotation\naxis of Bienor ($\\beta_p=50\\pm3^{\\circ}$, $\\lambda_p=35\\pm8^{\\circ}$). We are\nalso able to constrain the $b/a$ axial ratio of a triaxial Jacobi ellipsoidal\nbody (with semi-axis $a>b>c$). The best fit is for $b/a=0.45\\pm0.05$, which\ncorresponds to a density value of $594^{+47}_{-35}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$ under the\nusual assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and given that Bienor's rotational\nperiod is 9.17 h. However, the absolute magnitude of Bienor at several epochs\nis not well reproduced. We tested several explanations such as relaxing the\nhydrostatic equilibrium constraint, a large North-South asymmetry in the\nsurface albedo of Bienor or even a ring system. When a ring system of similar\ncharacteristics to those of Chariklo and Chiron is included, we can fit both\nthe light curve amplitude and absolute magnitude. In this case the derived\naxial ratio is modified to $b/a=0.37\\pm0.10$. The implied density is\n$678^{+209}_{-100}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$. Also the existence of a ring is consistent\nwith the spectroscopic detection of water ice on Bienor. Nevertheless the other\nexplanations cannot be discarded.\n", "  Solitons and vortices obtain widespread attention in different physical\nsystems as they offer potential use in information storage, processing, and\ncommunication. In exciton-polariton condensates in semiconductor microcavities,\nsolitons and vortices can be created optically. However, dark solitons are\nunstable and vortices cannot be spatially controlled. In the present work we\ndemonstrate the existence of stable dark solitons and vortices under\nnon-resonant incoherent excitation of a polariton condensate with a simple\nspatially periodic pump. In one dimension, we show that an additional coherent\nlight pulse can be used to create or destroy a dark soliton in a controlled\nmanner. In two dimensions we demonstrate that a coherent light beam can be used\nto move a vortex to a specific position on the lattice or be set into motion by\nsimply switching the periodic pump structure from two-dimensional (lattice) to\none-dimensional (stripes). Our theoretical results open up exciting\npossibilities for optical on-demand generation and control of dark solitons and\nvortices in polariton condensates.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling in crystals is known to lead to unusual direction\ndependent exchange interactions, however understanding of the consequeces of\nsuch effects in molecular crystals is incomplete. Here we perform four\ncomponent relativistic density functional theory computations on the\nmulti-nuclear molecular crystal {Mo$_3$S$_7$(dmit)$_3$} and show that both\nintra- and inter-molecular spin-orbit coupling are significant. We determine a\nlong-range relativistic single electron Hamiltonian from first principles by\nconstructing Wannier spin-orbitals. We analyse the various contributions\nthrough the lens of group theory. Intermolecular spin-orbit couplings like\nthose found here are known to lead to quantum spin-Hall and topological\ninsulator phases on the 2D lattice formed by the tight-binding model predicted\nfor a single layer of {Mo$_3$S$_7$(dmit)$_3$}.\n", "  Recent analysis of the WMAP and Planck data have shown the presence of a dip\nand a bump in the spectrum of primordial perturbations at the scales $k=0.002$\nMpc${}^{-1}$ and $k=0.0035$ Mpc${}^{-1}$ respectively. We analyze for the first\ntime the effects a local feature in the inflaton potential to explain the\nobserved deviations from scale invariance in the primordial spectrum. We\nperform a best fit analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation\ntemperature and polarization data. The effects of the features can improve the\nagreement with observational data respect to the featureless model. The best\nfit local feature affects the primordial curvature spectrum mainly in the\nregion of the bump, leaving the spectrum unaffected on other scales.\n", "  Galactic rotation curves are a fundamental constraint for any cosmological\nmodel. We use controlled N-body simulations of galaxies to study the\ngravitational effect of baryons in a scenario with collisionless cold dark\nmatter (CDM) versus one with a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) component.\nIn particular, we examine the inner profiles of the rotation curves in the\nvelocity range Vmax = 30-250 km/s, whose diversity has been found to be greater\nthan predicted by the Lambda-CDM scenario. We find that the scatter in the\nobserved rotation curves exceeds that predicted by dark matter only\nmass-concentration relations in either the CDM nor SIDM models. Allowing for\nrealistic baryonic content and spatial distributions, however, helps create a\nlarge variety of rotation curve shapes; which is in better agreement with\nobservations in the case of self-interactions due to the characteristic cored\nprofiles being more accommodating to the slowly rising rotation curves than\nCDM. We find individual fits to model two of the most remarkable outliers of\nsimilar Vmax, UGC 5721 and IC 2574, the former a cusp-like rotation curve and\nthe latter a seemingly 8 kpc cored profile. This diversity in SIDM arises as\npermutations of overly concentrated halos with compact baryonic distributions\nversus underdense halos with extended baryonic disks. The SIDM solution is\npromising and its feasibility ultimately depends on the sampling of the halo\nmass-concentration relation and its interplay with the baryonic profiles,\nemphasising the need for a better understanding of the frequency of extreme\noutliers present in current observational samples.\n", "  We derive algebraic bounds on achievable rates for quantum state transfer and\nentanglement generation in general quantum systems. We apply these bounds to\ngraph-based models of local quantum spin systems to obtain speed limits on\nthese tasks. A comparison to numerical optimal control results for spin chains\nsuggests that unexplored regions of the dynamical landscape may support\nenhanced performance of key quantum information processing tasks.\n", "  We implement a quantum optimal control algorithm based on automatic\ndifferentiation and harness the acceleration afforded by graphics processing\nunits (GPUs). Automatic differentiation allows us to specify advanced\noptimization criteria and incorporate them in the optimization process with\nease. We show that the use of GPUs can speed up calculations by more than an\norder of magnitude. Our strategy facilitates efficient numerical simulations on\naffordable desktop computers, and exploration of a host of optimization\nconstraints and system parameters relevant to real-life experiments. We\ndemonstrate optimization of quantum evolution based on fine-grained evaluation\nof performance at each intermediate time step, thus enabling more intricate\ncontrol on the evolution path, suppression of departures from the truncated\nmodel subspace, as well as minimization of the physical time needed to perform\nhigh-fidelity state preparation and unitary gates.\n", "  An oxyborate Co2AlBO5 belonging to the ludwigite family is investigated using\nstructural, thermodynamic, dielectric and magnetic measurements. Magnetic\nmeasurements indicate that this system is seen to exhibit long range magnetic\nordering at T{_N} = 42 K, signatures of which are also seen in the specific\nheat, dielectric susceptibility, and the lattice parameters. The absence of a\nstructural phase transition down to the lowest measured temperatures,\ndistinguishes it from the more extensively investigated Fe-based ludwigites. At\nlow temperatures, the system is seen to stabilize in a reentrant superspin\nglass phase at T{_G} = 10.6 K from within the magnetically ordered state. This\nground state is also characterized by magnetic field induced metamagnetic\ntransitions, which at the lowest measured temperatures exhibit a number of\nsharp magnetization steps, reminiscent of that observed in the mixed valent\nmanganites.\n", "  We present an optimal detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and applied it to\nevaluate the local roughness exponent in non-equilibrium surface growth models\nwith mounded morphology. Our method consists in analyzing the height\nfluctuations computing the shortest distance of each point of the profile to a\ndetrending curved that fits the surface within the investigated interval. We\ncompare the optimal DFA (ODFA) with both the standard DFA and nondetrended\nanalysis. We validate the ODFA method considering a one-dimensional model in\nthe Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class starting from a mounded initial\ncondition. We applied the methods to the Clarke-Vvdensky (CV) model in $2+1$\ndimensions with thermally activated surface diffusion and absence of step\nbarriers. It is expected that this model belongs to the nonlinear Molecular\nBeam Epitaxy (nMBE) universality class. However, an explicit observation of the\nroughness exponent in agreement with the nMBE class was still missing. The\neffective roughness exponent obtained with ODFA agrees with the value expected\nfor nMBE class whereas using the other methods it does not. We also\ncharacterized the transient anomalous scaling of the CV model and obtained that\nthe corresponding exponent is in agreement with the value reported for other\nnMBE models with weaker corrections to the scaling.\n", "  We have calculated cross sections for the production of lepton pairs by a\nneutrino incident on a nucleus using both the equivalent photon approximation,\nand deep inelastic formalism. We find that production of mixed flavour lepton\npairs can have production cross sections as high as 35 times those of the\ntraditional muon pair-production process. Rates are estimated for the SHiP and\nDUNE intensity frontier experiments. We find that multiple trident production\nmodes, some of which have never been observed, represent observable signals\nover the lifetime of the detectors. Our estimates indicate that the SHiP\ncollaboration should be able to observe on the order of 300 trident events\ngiven $2\\cdot 10^{20}$ POT, and that the DUNE collaboration can expect\napproximately 250 trident events in their near detector given 3X10^{22} POT. We\nalso discuss possible applications of the neutrino trident data to be collected\nat SHiP and DUNE for SM and BSM physics.\n", "  The gapless Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles of a clean three\ndimensional spinless $p_x+ip_y$ superconductor provide an intriguing example of\na thermal Hall semimetal (ThSM) phase of Majorana-Weyl fermions in class D of\nthe Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classification; such a phase can support a large\nanomalous thermal Hall conductivity and protected surface Majorana-Fermi arcs\nat zero energy. We study the effect of quenched disorder on such a topological\nphase with both numerical and analytical methods. Using the kernel polynomial\nmethod, we compute the average and typical density of states for the BdG\nquasiparticles; based on this, we construct the disordered phase diagram. We\nshow for infinitesimal disorder, the ThSM is converted into a diffusive thermal\nHall metal (ThDM) due to rare statistical fluctuations. Consequently, the phase\ndiagram of the disordered model only consists of ThDM and thermal insulating\nphases. Nonetheless, there is a cross-over at finite energies from a ThSM\nregime to a ThDM regime, and we establish the scaling properties of the avoided\nquantum critical point which marks this cross-over. Additionally, we show the\nexistence of two types of thermal insulators: (i) a trivial thermal band\ninsulator (ThBI) [or BEC phase] supporting only exponentially localized\nLifshitz states (at low energy), and (ii) a thermal Anderson insulator (AI) at\nlarge disorder strengths. We determine the nature of the two distinct\nlocalization transitions between these two types of insulators and ThDM.We also\ndiscuss the experimental relevance of our results for three dimensional, time\nreversal symmetry breaking, triplet superconducting states.\n", "  Imposing restrictions on the Feynman paths of the monitored system has in the\npast been proposed as a universal model-free approach to continuous quantum\nmeasurements. Here we revisit this proposition, and demonstrate that a Gaussian\nrestriction, resulting in a sequence of many highly inaccurate (weak) von\nNeumann measurements, is not sufficiently strong to ensure proximity between a\nreadout and the Feynman paths along which the monitored system evolves. Rather,\nin the continuous limit, the variations of a typical readout become much larger\nthan the separation between the eigenvalues of the measured quantity. Thus, a\ntypical readout is not represented by a nearly constant curve, correlating with\none of the eigenvalues of the measured quantity $\\a$, even when decoherence, or\nZeno effect are achieved for the observed two-level system, and does not point\ndirectly to the system's final state. We show that the decoherence in a \"free\"\nsystem can be seen as induced by a Gaussian random walk with a drift,\neventually directing the system towards one of the eigenstates of $\\a$. A\nsimilar mechanism appears to be responsible for the Zeno effect in a driven\nsystem, when its Rabi oscillations are quenched by monitoring. Alongside the\nGaussian case, which can only be studied numerically, we also consider a fully\ntractable model with a \"hard wall\" restriction, and show the results to be\nsimilar.\n", "  We use the compatibility of D-brane action with linear off-shell T-duality\nand linear on-shell S-duality as guiding principles to find all world volume\ncouplings of one massless closed and three massless open strings at order\n$\\alpha'^2$ in type II superstring theories in flat space-time.\n", "  The Standard-Model Extension (SME) parameterizes all possible\nLorentz-violating contributions to the Standard Model and General Relativity.\nIt can be considered as an effective framework to describe possible\nquantum-gravity effects for energies much below the Planck energy. In the\ncurrent paper, the spin-nondegenerate operators of the SME fermion sector are\nthe focus. The propagators, energies, and solutions to the modified Dirac\nequation are obtained for several families of coefficients including nonminimal\nones. The particle energies and spinors are computed at first order in Lorentz\nviolation and, with the optical theorem, they are shown to be consistent with\nthe propagators. The optical theorem is then also used to derive the matrices\nformed from a spinor and its Dirac conjugate at all orders in Lorentz\nviolation. The results are the first explicit ones derived for the\nspin-nondegenerate operators. They will prove helpful for future\nphenomenological calculations in the SME that rely on the footing of quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  We present results from MMT/Hectochelle spectroscopy of red giant candidate\nstars along the line of sight to the recently-discovered Galactic satellite\nCrater 2. Modelling the joint distribution of stellar positions, velocities and\nmetallicities as a mixture of Crater 2 and Galactic foreground populations, we\nidentify 62 members of Crater 2, for which we resolve line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion 2.7 +/- 0.3 km/s about mean velocity of 87.5 +/- 0.4 km/s. We also\nresolve a metallicity dispersion 0.22 about a mean of [Fe/H]=-1.98 +/- 0.1 that\nis 0.28 +/- 0.14 poorer than is estimated from photometry. Despite Crater 2's\nrelatively large size (projected halflight radius R(h)=1 kpc) and intermediate\nluminosity (M_V =-8), its velocity dispersion is the coldest that has been\nresolved for any dwarf galaxy. These properties make Crater 2 the most extreme\nlow-density outlier in dynamical as well as structural scaling relations among\nthe Milky Way's dwarf spheroidals. Even so, under assumptions of dynamical\nequilibrium and negligible contamination by unresolved binary stars, the\nobserved velocity distribution implies a gravitationally dominant dark matter\nhalo, with dynamical mass 4.4 x 10^6 Msun and mass-to-light ratio M/L=53\nenclosed within a radius of 1 kpc, where the equivalent circular velocity is\n4.3 km/s.\n", "  We present a radio and optical study of the double-double radio galaxy\nJ1328+2752 based on new low-frequency GMRT observations and SDSS data. The\nradio data were used to investigate the morphology and to perform a spectral\nindex analysis. In this source we find that the inner double is misaligned by\n$\\sim$30$^\\circ$ from the axis of the outer diffuse structure. The SDSS\nspectrum shows that the central component has double-peaked line profiles with\ndifferent emission strengths. The average velocity off-set of the two\ncomponents is 235$\\pm$10.5 km s$^{-1}$. The misaligned radio morphology along\nwith the double-peaked emission lines indicate that this source is a potential\ncandidate binary supermassive black hole. This study further supports mergers\nas a possible explanation for repeated jet activity in radio sources.\n", "  We describe the coupling of moving atoms to a one dimensional photonic\nwaveguide in the regime where the atomic velocities are comparable to the\neffective speed of light. Such conditions could be achieved, for example, in\nphotonic crystals or coupled resonator arrays, where the maximal photonic group\nvelocity is significantly reduced compared to free space. In this case the\ninterplay between a velocity-induced directionality and the emergence of new\ndivergencies in the photonic density of states gives rise to a range of novel\nphenomena and non-perturbative effects in the emission of photons and the\nresulting photon-mediated interactions between moving atoms. We show that apart\nfrom potential implementations with optical waveguides, Rydberg atoms flying\nabove a coupled array of superconducting microwave resonators provide a\nversatile platform for exploring this new regime of atom-light interactions\nunder experimentally accessible conditions.\n", "  A new approach to efficient quantum computation with probabilistic gates is\nproposed and analyzed in both a local and non-local setting. It combines\nheralded gates previously studied for atom or atom-like qubits with logical\nencoding from linear optical quantum computation in order to perform high\nfidelity quantum gates across a quantum network. The error-detecting properties\nof the heralded operations ensure high fidelity while the encoding makes it\npossible to correct for failed attempts such that deterministic and\nhigh-quality gates can be achieved. Importantly, this is robust to photon loss,\nwhich is typically the main obstacle to photonic based quantum information\nprocessing. Overall this approach opens a novel path towards quantum networks\nwith atomic nodes and photonic links.\n", "  We take advantage of the deep and wide coverage of the VST ATLAS survey to\nstudy the line-of-sight structure of the Sagittarius stellar stream in the\nSouthern hemisphere, only ~40{\\deg} away from the progenitor. We use\nphotometrically selected Sub-Giant Branch (SGB) stars to reveal a complex\ndebris morphology of the trailing arm and detect at least two clear peaks in\nthe SGB distance modulus distribution. The separation between the two\nline-of-sight components is at least 5 kpc at the edge of the VST ATLAS\nfootprint, but appears to change along the stream, which allows us to conclude\nthat these detections correspond to two physically independent stellar\nstructures, rather than a mix of co-distant stellar populations within a single\nstream. Our discovery of a fork in the Sgr trailing arm is verified using Blue\nHorizontal Branch stars and our distance measurements are calibrated using RR\nLyrae stars from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey. Comparing with\nnumerical simulations of the Sgr dwarf disruption, the more distant of the two\ncomponents in the fork matches perfectly with the track of the trailing debris.\nHowever, no obvious counterpart exists in the simulation for the closer\nline-of-sight component.\n", "  Seemingly unrelated models of inflation that originate from different\nphysical setups yield, in some cases, identical predictions for the currently\nconstrained inflationary observables. In order to classify the available\nmodels, we propose to express the slow-roll parameters and the relevant\nobservables in terms of frame and reparametrisation invariant quantities. The\nadopted invariant formalism makes manifest the redundancy that afflicts the\ncurrent description of inflation dynamics and offers a straightforward way to\nidentify classes of models which yield identical phenomenology. In this Letter\nwe offer a step-to-step recipe to recast every single field inflationary model\nin the proposed formalism, detailing also the procedure to compute inflationary\nobservables in terms of frame and reparametrisation invariant quantities. We\nhope that our results become the cornerstone of a new categorisation of viable\ninflationary models and open the way to a deeper understanding of the inflation\nmechanism.\n", "  We study correlations functions of magnetic vortices $V$ and Polyakov loop\n$P$ operators in the 2+1 dimensional Georgi-Glashow model in the vicinity of\nthe deconfining phase transition. In this regime the (dimensionally reduced)\nmodel is mapped onto a free theory of two massive Majorana fermions. We utilize\nthis fermionic representation to explicitly calculate the expectation values of\n$V$ and $P$ as well as their correlators. In particular we show that the $VV$\ncorrelator is large, and thus the anomalous breaking of the magnetic $U(1)$\nsymmetry is order one effect in the near critical region. We also calculate the\ncontribution of magnetic vortices to the entropy and the free energy of the\nsystem.\n", "  Holographic models provide unique laboratories to investigate non-linear\nphysics of transport in inhomogeneous systems. We provide a detailed account of\nboth DC and AC conductivities in a defect CFT with spontaneous stripe order.\nThe spatial symmetry is broken at large chemical potential and the resulting\nground state is a combination of a spin and charge density wave. An\ninfinitesimal applied electric field across the stripes will cause the stripes\nto slide over the underlying density of smeared impurities, a phenomenon which\ncan be associated with the Goldstone mode for the spontaneously broken\ntranslation symmetry. We show that the presence of a spatially modulated\nbackground magnetization current thwarts the expression of some DC\nconductivities in terms of horizon data.\n", "  Nowadays different experimental techniques, such as single molecule or\nrelaxation experiments, can provide dynamic properties of biomolecular systems,\nbut the amount of detail obtainable with these methods is often limited in\nterms of time or spatial resolution. Here we use state-of-the-art computational\ntechniques, namely atomistic molecular dynamics and Markov state models, to\nprovide insight into the rapid dynamics of short RNA oligonucleotides, in order\nto elucidate the kinetics of stacking interactions. Analysis of multiple\nmicrosecond-long simulations indicates that the main relaxation modes of such\nmolecules can consist of transitions between alternative folded states, rather\nthan between random coils and native structures. After properly removing\nstructures that are artificially stabilized by known inaccuracies of the\ncurrent RNA AMBER force field, the kinetic properties predicted are consistent\nwith the timescales of previously reported relaxation experiments.\n", "  The debris disk of HIP73145 has been detected in scattered light in the\nnear-IR, and at far-IR wavelengths before, but no substructure has been seen so\nfar. Detection of such substructures in combination with detailed modeling can\nhint at the presence of perturbing planetary bodies, or reveal other mechanisms\nacting to replenish gas and dust reservoirs and forming structures such as\nspirals or rings. We obtained multiwavelength images with SPHERE in the near-IR\nin the H2 and H3 bands with the IRDIS camera and a 0.95-1.35 micron spectral\ncube with the IFS. Data were acquired in pupil-tracking mode, thus allowing for\nangular differential imaging. The SPHERE standard suite of angular differential\nimaging algorithms was applied. ALMA Band 6 observations complement the SPHERE\ndata. We detect a bright ring of scattered light plus more structures inside,\nat least one of them forming a secondary, concentric ring with the first. This\nis the first detection of this disk in total-intensity scattered light. A\nsecond object is detected in the field at high contrast but concluded to be a\nbackground star. Forward modeling yields information on the primary parameters\nof the disk and confirms that the detected substructures are not due to the\ndata analysis approach, which sometimes leads to spurious structures. We detect\na series of concentric rings in the disk around HIP73145. This is one of the\nrare cases where multiple components are necessary to fit the SED and are also\ndetected in scattered light. The presence of such ring structures somewhat\nquestions the nature of the object as a pure debris disk, but the gas and dust\ncontent would presumably offer sufficient explanations for such structures to\nform.\n", "  We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs)\nin the mass range 10^{15}-10^{17} g using data from the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) and MeV extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGB). Hawking\nradiation from PBHs with lifetime greater than the age of the universe leaves\nan imprint on the CMB through modification of the ionization history and the\ndamping of CMB anisotropies. Using a model for redshift dependent energy\ninjection efficiencies, we show that a combination of temperature and\npolarization data from Planck provides the strongest constraint on the\nabundance of PBHs for masses \\sim 10^{15}-10^{16} g, while the EGB dominates\nfor masses \\gtrsim 10^{16} g. Both the CMB and EGB now rule out PBHs as the\ndominant component of dark matter for masses \\sim 10^{16}-10^{17} g. Planned\nMeV gamma-ray observatories are ideal for further improving constraints on PBHs\nin this mass range.\n", "  Single-shot readout of qubits is required for scalable quantum computing.\nNuclear spins are superb quantum memories due to their long coherence times but\nare difficult to be read out in single shot due to their weak interaction with\nprobes. Here we demonstrate single-shot readout of a weakly coupled $^{13}$C\nnuclear spin, which is unresolvable in traditional protocols. We use dynamical\ndecoupling pulse sequences to selectively enhance the entanglement between the\nnuclear spin and a nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin, tuning the weak\nmeasurement of the nuclear spin to a strong, projective one. A nuclear spin\ncoupled to the NV center with strength 330 kHz is read out in 200 ms with\nfidelity 95.5\\%. This work provides a general protocol for single-shot readout\nof weakly coupled qubits and therefore largely extends the range of physical\nsystems for scalable quantum computing.\n", "  We analyze the properties of a two and three dimensional quantum walk that\nare inspired by the idea of a brane-world model put forward by Rubakov and\nShaposhnikov [1]. In that model, particles are dynamically confined on the\nbrane due to the interaction with a scalar field. We translated this model into\nan alternate quantum walk with a coin that depends on the external field, with\na dependence which mimics a domain wall solution. As in the original model,\nfermions (in our case, the walker), become localized in one of the dimensions,\nnot from the action of a random noise on the lattice (as in the case of\nAnderson localization), but from a regular dependence in space. On the other\nhand, the resulting quantum walk can move freely along the \"ordinary\"\ndimension.\n", "  We present a study of di-lepton production at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\nwith a particular focus on the contribution resulting from both real and\nvirtual photons in the initial state. We discuss the region of phase space in\nwhich the invariant mass of the lepton pair is of the order of several TeV,\nwhere searches for new physics phenomena yielding a di-lepton signature are\npresently carried out. We study both the yield and associated uncertainties for\nall possible topologies in photon-induced di-lepton production and compare\nthese with what is expected in the standard Drell-Yan channel, where\nquark-antiquark pairs are responsible for the production of lepton pairs. We\nanalyse the impact of these QED contributions on the expected Standard Model\nbackground and on searches for new physics. In this latter case, we use the\nproduction of an extra heavy $Z^\\prime$-boson predicted by the Sequential\nStandard Model (SSM) as a benchmark process.\n", "  Interaction with divalent cations is of paramount importance for RNA\nstructural stability and function. We here report a detailed molecular dynamics\nstudy of all the possible binding sites for Mg$^{2+}$ on a RNA duplex,\nincluding both direct (inner sphere) and indirect (outer sphere) binding. In\norder to tackle sampling issues, we develop a modified version of bias-exchange\nmetadynamics which allows us to simultaneously compute affinities with\npreviously unreported statistical accuracy. Results correctly reproduce trends\nobserved in crystallographic databases. Based on this, we simulate a carefully\nchosen set of models that allows us to quantify the effects of competition with\nmonovalent cations, RNA flexibility, and RNA hybridization. Our simulations\nreproduce the decrease and increase of Mg$^{2+}$ affinity due to ion\ncompetition and hybridization respectively, and predict that RNA flexibility\nhas a site dependent effect. This suggests a non trivial interplay between RNA\nconformational entropy and divalent cation binding.\n", "  Generalising arXiv:1511.08496, we construct further families of compact\nEinstein-Maxwell instantons associated with the Kerr-Newman metrics with a\npositive cosmological constant.\n", "  We present a study of the kinematics of 101 stars observed with VIMOS around\nWhiting1, a globular cluster embedded in the Sagittarius tidal stream. The\nobtained velocity distribution shows the presence of two wraps of that halo\nsubstructure at the same heliocentric distance as that of the cluster and with\nwell differentiated mean radial velocities. The most prominent velocity\ncomponent seems to be associated with the trailing arm of Sagittarius with\n$<v_{\\rm r}>$ ~ -130 km/s, which is consistent with the velocity of Whiting1.\nThis result supports that this globular cluster was formed in Sagittarius and\nrecently accreted by the Milky Way. The second component with $<v_{\\rm r}>$ ~\n120 km/s might correspond to the leading arm of Sagittarius, which has been\npredicted by numerical simulations but with no conclusive observational\nevidence of its existence presented so far. This detection of the old leading\nwrap of Sagittarius in the southern hemisphere may be used to confirm and\nfurther constrain the models for its orbit and evolution.\n", "  We study time-dependent electron transport and quantum noise in a ballistic\ngraphene field effect transistor driven by an ac gate potential. The non-linear\nresponse to the ac signal is computed through Floquet theory for scattering\nstates and Landauer-B\\\"uttiker theory for charge current and its fluctuations.\nPhoton-assisted excitation of a quasibound state in the top-gate barrier leads\nto resonances in transmission that strongly influence the noise properties. For\nstrong doping of graphene under source and drain contacts, when electrons are\ntransmitted through the channel via evanescent waves, the resonance leads to a\nsubstantial suppression of noise. The Fano factor is then reduced well below\nthe pseudo-diffusive value, $F<1/3$, also for strong ac drive. The good\nsignal-to-noise ratio (small Fano factor) on resonance suggests that the device\nis a good candidate for high-frequency (THz) radiation detection. We show\nanalytically that Klein tunneling (total suppression of back-reflection)\npersists for perpendicular incidence also when the barrier is driven\nharmonically. Although the transmission is inelastic and distributed among\nsideband energies, a sum rule leads to total suppression of shot noise.\n", "  We investigate the dimensionally induced phase transition from the normal to\nthe Bose-Einstein-condensed phase for a weakly interacting Bose gas in an\noptical lattice. To this end we make use of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov-Popov\ntheory, where we include numerically exact hopping energies and effective\ninteraction strengths. At first we determine the critical chemical potential,\nwhere we find a much better agreement with recent experimental data than a pure\nHartree-Fock treatment. This finding is in agreement with the dominant role of\nquantum fluctuations in lower dimensions, as they are explicitly included in\nour theory. Furthermore, we determine for the 1D-3D-transition the power-law\nexponent of the critical temperature for two different non-interacting Bose gas\nmodels yielding the same value of 1/2, which indicates that they belong to the\nsame universality class. For the weakly interacting Bose gas we find for both\nmodels that this exponent is robust with respect to finite interaction\nstrengths.\n", "  We study ultrastrong-coupling quantum-phase-transition phenomena in a\nfew-qubit system. In the one-qubit case, three second-order transitions occur\nand the Goldstone mode emerges under the condition of ultrastrong-coupling\nstrength. Moreover, a first-order phase transition occurs between two different\nsuperradiant phases. In the two-qubit case, a two-qubit Hamiltonian with\nqubit-qubit interactions is analyzed fully quantum mechanically. We show that\nthe quantum phase transition is inhibited even in the ultrastrong-coupling\nregime in this model. In addition, in the three-qubit model, the superradiant\nquantum phase transition is retrieved in the ultrastrong-coupling regime.\nFurthermore, the N-qubit model with U(1) symmetry is studied and we find that\nthe superradiant phase transition is inhibited or restored with the\nqubit-number parity.\n", "  General relativity is a set of physical and geometric principles, which lead\nto a set of (Einstein) field equations that determine the gravitational field,\nand to the geodesic equations that describe light propagation and the motion of\nparticles on the background. But open questions remain, including: What is the\nscale on which matter and geometry are dynamically coupled in the Einstein\nequations? Are the field equations valid on small and large scales? What is the\nlargest scale on which matter can be coarse grained while following a geodesic\nof a solution to Einstein's equations? We address these questions. If the field\nequations are causal evolution equations, whose average on cosmological scales\nis not an exact solution of the Einstein equations, then some simplifying\nphysical principle is required to explain the statistical homogeneity of the\nlate epoch Universe. Such a principle may have its origin in the dynamical\ncoupling between matter and geometry at the quantum level in the early\nUniverse. This possibility is hinted at by diverse approaches to quantum\ngravity which find a dynamical reduction to two effective dimensions at high\nenergies on one hand, and by cosmological observations which are beginning to\nstrongly restrict the class of viable inflationary phenomenologies on the\nother. We suggest that the foundational principles of general relativity will\nplay a central role in reformulating the theory of spacetime structure to meet\nthe challenges of cosmology in the 21st century.\n", "  Color symmetry is spontaneously broken in quark matter at high density as a\nconsequence of di-quark condensations with exhibiting color superconductivity.\nNon-Abelian vortices or color magnetic flux tubes stably exist in the\ncolor-flavor locked phase at asymptotically high-density. The effective\nworldsheet theory of a single non-Abelian vortex was previously calculated in\nthe singular gauge to obtain the ${\\mathbb C}P^2$ model [ arXiv:0908.4470 ,\narXiv:0912.1352 ]. Here, we reconstruct the effective theory in a regular gauge\nwithout taking a singular gauge, confirming the previous results in the\nsingular gauge. As a byproduct of our analysis, we find that non-Abelian\nvortices in high-density QCD do not suffer from any obstruction for the global\ndefinition of a symmetry breaking.\n", "  We show that in D=2n+1 dimensions, when mass is negative and all angular\nmomenta are non-vanishing, Kerr and Kerr-AdS metrics describe smooth time\nmachines, with no curvature singularity. Turning off the angular momenta\nappropriately can lead to static AdS solitons with negative mass. Setting zero\nthe cosmological constant yields a class of Ricci-flat K\\\"ahler metrics in D=2n\ndimensions. We also show that Euclidean-signatured AdS solitons with negative\nmass can also arise in odd dimensions. We then construct time machines in D=5\nminimal gauged supergravity that carry only magnetic dipole charges. Turning\noff the cosmological constant, the time machine becomes massless and\nasymptotically flat. It can be described as a constant time bundle over the\nEguchi-Hanson instanton.\n", "  We report the discovery of a large population of Ultra-diffuse Galaxies\n(UDGs) in the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2744 (z=0.308) as observed by the\nHubble Frontier Fields program. Since this cluster is ~5 times more massive\nthan Coma, our observations allow us to extend 0.7 dex beyond the high-mass end\nof the relationship between UDG abundance and cluster mass reported by van der\nBurg et al. 2016. Using the same selection criteria as van der Burg et al.\n2016, A2744 hosts an estimated 2133 +/- 613 UDGs, ten times the number in Coma.\nAs noted by Lee & Jang 2016, A2744 contains numerous unresolved compact\nobjects, which those authors identified predominantly as globular clusters.\nHowever, these objects have luminosities that are more consistent with\nultra-compact dwarf (UCD) galaxies. The abundances of both UCDs and UDGs scale\nwith cluster mass as a power law with a similar exponent, although UDGs and\nUCDs have very different radial distributions within the cluster. The radial\nsurface density distribution of UCDs rises sharply toward the cluster centre,\nwhile the surface density distribution of the UDG population is essentially\nflat. Together, these observations hint at a picture where some UCDs in A2744\nmay have once been associated with infalling UDGs. As UDGs fall in and\ndissolve, they leave behind a residue of unbound ultra-compact dwarfs.\n", "  We present results from a 54.7 live-day shielded run of the DRIFT-IId\ndetector, the world's most sensitive, directional, dark matter detector.\nSeveral improvements were made relative to our previous work including a lower\nthreshold for detection, a more robust analysis and a tenfold improvement in\nour gamma rejection factor. After analysis, no events remain in our fiducial\nregion leading to an exclusion curve for spin-dependent WIMP-proton\ninteractions which reaches 0.28 pb at 100 GeV/c^2 a fourfold improvement on our\nprevious work. We also present results from a 45.4 live-day unshielded run of\nthe DRIFT-IId detector during which 14 nuclear recoil-like events were\nobserved. We demonstrate that the observed nuclear recoil rate of 0.31+/-0.08\nevents per day is consistent with detection of ambient, fast neutrons emanating\nfrom the walls of the Boulby Underground Science Facility.\n", "  We present a construction of a mean-field theory for thermodynamic and\nspectral properties of correlated electrons reliable in the strong-coupling\nlimit. We introduce an effective interaction determined self-consistently from\nthe reduced parquet equations. It is a static local approximation of the\ntwo-particle irreducible vertex, the kernel of a potentially singular\nBethe-Salpeter equation. The effective interaction enters the Ward identity\nfrom which a thermodynamic self-energy, renormalizing the one-electron\npropagators, is determined. The dynamical Schwinger-Dyson equation with the\nthermodynamic propagators is then used to calculate the spectral properties.\nThe thermodynamic and spectral properties of correlated electrons are in this\nway determined on the same footing and in a consistent manner. Such a\nmean-field approximation is analytically controllable and free of unphysical\nbehavior and spurious phase transitions. We apply the construction to the\nasymmetric Anderson impurity and the Hubbard models in the strong-coupling\nregime.\n", "  For asymptotically flat spacetimes, using the inverse mean curvature flow, we\nshow that any compact $2$-surface, $S_0$, whose mean curvature and its\nderivative for outward direction are positive in spacelike hypersurface with\nnon-negative Ricci scalar satisfies the inequality $A_0 \\leq 4 \\pi (3Gm)^2$,\nwhere $A_0$ is the area of $S_0$ and $m$ is the total mass. The upper bound is\nrealized when $S_0$ is the photon sphere in a hypersurface isometric to\n$t=$const. slice of the Schwarzschild spacetime.\n", "  We consider theoretically domain wall motion driven by spin-orbit and spin\nHall torques. We find that it is possible to achieve universal absence of\nWalker breakdown for all spin-orbit torques using experimentally relevant\nspin-orbit coupling strengths. For spin-orbit torques other than the pure\nRashba spin-orbit torque, this gives a linear current-velocity relation instead\nof a saturation of the velocity at high current densities. The effect is very\nrobust and is found in both soft and hard magnetic materials, as well as in the\npresence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and in coupled domain walls\nin synthetic antiferromagnets, where it leads to very high domain wall\nvelocities. Moreover, recent experiments have demonstrated that the switching\nof a synthetic antiferromagnet does not obey the usual spin Hall\nangle-dependence, but that domain expansion and contraction can be selectively\ncontrolled toggling only the applied in-plane magnetic field magnitude and not\nits sign. We show for the first time that the combination of spin Hall torques\nand interlayer exchange coupling produces the necessary relative velocities for\nthis switching to occur.\n", "  Super star clusters (SSCs), likely the progenitors of globular clusters, are\none of the most extreme forms of star formation. Understanding how SSCs form is\nan observational challenge. Theoretical studies establish that, to form such\nclusters, the dynamical timescale of their parent clouds has to be shorter than\nthe timescale of the disruption of their parent clouds by stellar feedback.\nHowever, due to insufficient observational support, it is still unclear how\nfeedback from SSCs acts on their surrounding matter. Studying feedback in SSCs\nis essential to understand how such clusters form. Based on ALMA and VLT\nobservations, we study this process in a SSC in the overlap region of the\nAntennae galaxies. We analyze a unique massive (~10^7 Msun) and young (1-3.5\nMyr) SSC, still associated with compact molecular and ionized gas emission. The\ncluster has two CO velocity components, a low velocity one spatially associated\nwith the cluster and a high velocity one distributed in a bubble-like shape\naround the cluster. Our results on the low velocity component suggest that this\ngas did not participate in the formation of the SSC. We propose that most of\nthe parent cloud has already been blown away, accelerated at the early stages\nof the SSC evolution by radiation pressure, in a timescale ~1 Myr. The high\nvelocity component may trace outflowing molecular gas from the parent cloud.\nSupporting evidence is found in shock heated H2 gas. The low velocity component\nmay be gas that was near the SSC when it formed but not part of its parent\ncloud or clumps that migrated from the SGMC environment. This gas would be\ndispersed by stellar winds and supernova explosions. Within ~100 pc from the\ncluster, we estimate SFE>17%, smaller than the theoretical limit of 30% needed\nto form a bound cluster. Further higher spatial resolution observations are\nneeded to test and quantify our proposed scenario.\n", "  Using the first-principles and Monte Carlo methods, here we systematically\nstudy magnetic properties of monolayer octagonal-tetragonal phosphorus with 3d\ntransition-metal (TM) adatoms. Different from the puckered hexagonal black\nphosphorus monolayer (phosphorene or $\\alpha$-P), the octagonal-tetragonal\nphase of 2D phosphorus (named as ot-P or $\\epsilon$-P in this article) is\nbuckled with octagon-tetragon structure. Our calculations show that all TMs,\nexcept the closed-shell Zn atom, are able to strongly bind onto monolayer\n$ot$-P with significant binding energies. Local magnetic moments (up to 6\n$\\mu$B) on adatoms of Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co originate from the exchange\nand crystal-field splitting of TM 3d orbitals. The magnetic coupling between\nlocalized magnetic states of adatoms is dependent on adatomic distances and\ndirections. Lastly, the uniformly magnetic order is investigated to screening\ntwo-dimensional dilute ferromagnets with high Curie temperature for\napplications of spintronics. It is found that ot-P with V atoms homogeneously\nadsorbed at the centre of octagons with a concentration of 5% has the most\nstable ferromagnetic ground state. Its Curie temperature is estimated to be 173\nK using the Monte Carlo method.\n", "  A biexciton in a semiconductor quantum dot is a source of\npolarization-entangled photons with high potential for implementation in\nscalable systems. Several approaches for non-resonant, resonant and\nquasi-resonant biexciton preparation exist, but all have their own\ndisadvantages, for instance low fidelity, timing jitter, incoherence or\nsensitivity to experimental parameters. We demonstrate a coherent and robust\ntechnique to generate a biexciton in an InGaAs quantum dot with a fidelity\nclose to one. The main concept is the application of rapid adiabatic passage to\nthe ground state-exciton-biexciton system. We reinforce our experimental\nresults with simulations which include a microscopic coupling to phonons.\n", "  TeV-scale lepton number violation can affect neutrinoless double beta decay\nthrough dimension-9 $\\Delta L= \\Delta I = 2$ operators involving two electrons\nand four quarks. Since the dominant effects within a nucleus are expected to\narise from pion exchange, the $ \\pi^- \\to \\pi^+ e e$ matrix elements of the\ndimension-9 operators are a key hadronic input. In this letter we provide\nestimates for the $\\pi^- \\to \\pi^+ $ matrix elements of all Lorentz scalar\n$\\Delta I = 2$ four-quark operators relevant to the study of TeV-scale lepton\nnumber violation. The analysis is based on chiral $SU(3)$ symmetry, which\nrelates the $\\pi^- \\to \\pi^+$ matrix elements of the $\\Delta I = 2$ operators\nto the $K^0 \\to \\bar{K}^0$ and $K \\to \\pi \\pi$ matrix elements of their $\\Delta\nS = 2$ and $\\Delta S = 1$ chiral partners, for which lattice QCD input is\navailable. The inclusion of next-to-leading order chiral loop corrections to\nall symmetry relations used in the analysis makes our results robust at the\n$30\\%$ level or better, depending on the operator.\n", "  We measure the variation of the escape speed of the Galaxy across a range of\n$\\sim$ 40 kpc in Galactocentric radius. The local escape speed is found to be\n$521^{+46}_{-30}\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, in good agreement with other studies.\nWe find that this has already fallen to $379^{+34}_{-28}\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$\nat a radius of 50 kpc. Through measuring the escape speed and its variation, we\nobtain constraints on the Galactic potential as a whole. In particular, the\ngradient in the escape speed with radius suggests that the total mass contained\nwithin 50 kpc is $29^{+7}_{-5}\\times10^{10}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, implying a\nrelatively light dark halo for the Milky Way. Our method represents a novel way\nof estimating the mass of the Galaxy, and has very different systematics to\nmore commonly used models of tracers, which are more sensitive to the central\nparts of the halo velocity distributions. Using our inference on the escape\nspeed, we then investigate the orbits of high-speed Milky Way dwarf galaxies.\nFor each dwarf we consider, we predict small pericenter radii and large orbital\neccentricities. This naturally explains the large observed ellipticities of two\nof the dwarfs, which are likely to have been heavily disrupted as they passed\nthrough pericenter.\n", "  The protohalo patches from which halos form are defined by a number of\nconstraints imposed on the Lagrangian dark matter density field. Each of these\nconstraints contributes to biasing the spatial distribution of the protohalos\nrelative to the matter. We show how measurements of this spatial distribution\n-- linear combinations of protohalo bias factors -- can be used to make\ninferences about the physics of halo formation. Our analysis exploits the fact\nthat halo bias factors satisfy consistency relations which encode this physics,\nand that these relations are the same even for sub-populations in which\nassembly bias has played a role. We illustrate our methods using a model in\nwhich three parameters matter: a density threshold, the local slope and the\ncurvature of the smoothed density field. The latter two are nearly degenerate;\nour approach naturally allows one to build an accurate effective two-parameter\nmodel for which the consistency relations still apply. This, with an accurate\ndescription of the smoothing window, allows one to describe the\nprotohalo-matter cross-correlation very well, both in Fourier and configuration\nspace. We then use our determination of the large scale bias parameters\ntogether with the consistency relations, to estimate the enclosed density and\nmean slope on the Lagrangian radius scale of the protohalos. Direct\nmeasurements of these quantities, made on smaller scales than those on which\nthe bias parameters are typically measured, are in good agreement.\n", "  Based on a covariant coalescence model with a blast-wave-like parametrization\nfor the phase-space configuration of constituent particles at freeze-out, we\nderive an approximate analytical formula for the yields of clusters produced in\nrelativistic heavy-ion collisions. Compared to previous existing formulae, the\npresent work additionally considers the contributions from the longitudinal\ndimension in momentum space, the relativistic corrections and the finite size\neffects of the produced clusters relative to the spatial distribution of\nconstituent particles at freeze-out. The new analytical coalescence formula\nprovides a useful tool to evaluate the yield of produced clusters, such as\nlight nuclei from nucleon coalescence and hadrons from quark coalescence, in\nheavy-ion collisions. As a first application of the new analytical formula, we\nexplore the strangeness population factor $S_3 = ^3_{\\Lambda}$H/($^3$He$\\times\n\\Lambda/$p) based on nucleon/$\\Lambda$ coalescence as well as the production of\nexotic hadrons based on quark coalescence, in central Pb+Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The results are compared with the predictions from\nother models.\n", "  We report on a new method to compute the flare reconnection (RC) flux from\npost-eruption arcades (PEAs) and the underlying photospheric magnetic fields.\nIn previous works, the RC flux has been computed using cumulative flare ribbon\narea. Here we obtain the RC flux as half of that underlying the PEA associated\nwith the eruption using an image in EUV taken after the flare maximum. We apply\nthis method to a set of 21 eruptions that originated near the solar disk center\nin Solar Cycle 23. We find that the RC flux from the arcade method ({\\Phi}rA)\nhas excellent agreement with that from the flare-ribbon method ({\\Phi}rR)\naccording to: {\\Phi}rA = 1.24({\\Phi}rR)^0.99. We also find {\\Phi}rA to be\ncorrelated with the poloidal flux ({\\Phi}P) of the associated magnetic cloud at\n1 AU: {\\Phi}P = 1.20({\\Phi}rA)^0.85. This relation is nearly identical to that\nobtained by Qiu et al. (Astrophys. J. 659, 758, 2007) using a set of only nine\neruptions. Our result supports the idea that flare reconnection results in the\nformation of flux rope and PEA as a common process.\n", "  We apply the theory of radiative torque (RAT) alignment for studying\nprotoplanetary disks around a T-Tauri star and perform 3D radiative transfer\ncalculations to provide the expected maps of polarized radiation to be compared\nwith observations, such as with ALMA. We revisit the issue of grain alignment\nfor large grains expected in the protoplanetary disks and find that mm-sized\ngrains at midplane do not align with the magnetic field as the Larmor\nprecession timescale for such large grains becomes longer than the gaseous\ndamping timescale. Hence, for these grains the RAT theory predicts that the\nalignment axis is determined by the grain precession with respect to the\nradiative flux. As a result, we expect that the polarization will be in the\nazimuthal direction for a face-on disk. It is also shown that if dust grains\nhave superparamagnetic inclusions, magnetic field alignment is possible for\n(sub-)micron grains at the surface layer of disks, and this can be tested by\nmid-infrared polarimetric observations.\n", "  Ultrafast photocurrent experiments are performed on semiconducting,\nsingle-walled carbon nanotubes under a resonant optical excitation of their\nsubbands. The photogenerated excitons are dissociated at large electric fields\nand the resulting transport of the charge carriers turns out to be ballistic.\nThermionic emission processes to the contacts dominate the photocurrent. The\ncharge current without laser excitation is well described by a Fowler-Nordheim\ntunneling. The time-averaged photocurrent changes polarity as soon as\nsufficient charge carriers are injected from the contacts, which can be\nexplained by an effective population inversion in the optically pumped\nsubbands.\n", "  Context. Ice lines are suggested to play a significant role in grain growth\nand planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Evaporation fronts directly\ninfluence the gas and ice abundances of volatile species in the disk and\ntherefore the coagulation physics and efficiency and the chemical composition\nof the resulting planetesimals.\n  Aims. In this work we investigate the influence of the existence of the CO\nice line on the particle growth and on the distribution of CO in the disk.\n  Methods. We include the possibility of tracking the CO content and/or other\nvolatiles in particles and in the gas in our existing dust coagulation and disk\nevolution model and developed a method for evaporation and condensation of CO\nusing the Hertz-Knudsen equation. Our model does not include fragmentation,\nyet, which will be part of further investigations.\n  Results. We find no enhanced grain growth just outside the ice line where the\nparticle size is limited by radial drift. Instead we find a depletion of solid\nmaterial inside the ice line which is solely due to evaporation of the CO. Such\na depression inside the ice line may be observable and may help to quantify the\nprocesses described in this work. Furthermore, we find that the viscosity and\ndiffusivity of the gas heavily influence the re-distribution of vaporized CO at\nthe ice line and can lead to an increase in the CO abundance by up to a factors\nof a few in the region just inside the ice line. Depending on the strength of\nthe gaseous transport mechanisms the position of the ice line in our model can\nchange by up to 10 AU and consequently, the temperature at that location can\nrange from 21 K to 23 K.\n", "  There is a wide consensus on the correct dynamics of the background in loop\nquantum cosmology. In this article we make a systematic investigation of the\nduration of inflation by varying what we think to be the most important\n\"unknowns\" of the model: the way to set initial conditions, the amount of shear\nat the bounce and the shape of the inflaton potential.\n", "  As part of our on-going project on the homogeneous chemical characterization\nof multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs), we studied NGC\n5634, associated to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy of red giant stars collected with FLAMES@VLT. We\npresent here the radial velocity distribution of the 45 observed stars, 43 of\nwhich are member, the detailed chemical abundance of 22 species for the seven\nstars observed with UVES-FLAMES, and the abundance of six elements for stars\nobserved with GIRAFFE. On our homogeneous UVES metallicity scale we derived a\nlow metallicity [Fe/H]=-1.867 +/-0.019 +/-0.065 dex (+/-statistical\n+/-systematic error) with sigma=0.050 dex (7 stars). We found the normal\nanti-correlations between light elements (Na and O, Mg and Al), signature of\nmultiple populations typical of massive and old GCs. We confirm the\nassociations of NGC 5634 to the Sgr dSph, from which the cluster was lost a few\nGyr ago, on the basis of its velocity and position and the abundance ratios of\nalpha and neutron capture elements.\n", "  We consider Chiral Separation Effect (CSE) in the lattice regularized quantum\nfield theory. We discuss two types of regularization - with and without exact\nchiral symmetry. In the latter case this effect is described by its\nconventional expression for the massless fermions. This is illustrated by the\ntwo particular cases - of Wilson fermions and of the conventional overlap\nfermions. At the same time in the presence of the exact chiral symmetry the CSE\ndisappears. This is illustrated by the naive lattice fermions, when the\ncontributions of the fermion doublers cancel each other. Another example is the\nmodified version of the overlap regularization proposed recently, where there\nis the exact chiral symmetry, but as a price for this the fermion doublers\nbecome zeros of the Green function. In this case the contribution to the CSE of\nzeros and poles of the Green function cancel each other.\n", "  We investigate the phase structure of QCD with 3 degenerate quark flavors as\nfunction of the degenerate quark masses at vanishing baryon number density. We\nuse the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks on lattices with temporal extent\n$N_{t}=6$ and perform calculations for six values of quark masses, which in the\ncontinuum limit correspond to pion masses in the range $80~{\\rm MeV} \\lesssim\nm_{\\pi} \\lesssim 230~$MeV. By analyzing the volume and temperature dependence\nof the chiral condensate and chiral susceptibility we find no direct evidence\nfor a first order phase transition in this range of pion mass values. Relying\non the universal scaling behaviors of the chiral observables near an\nanticipated chiral critical point, we estimate an upper bound for the critical\npion mass, $m_\\pi^c \\lesssim$ 50 MeV, below which a region of first order\nchiral phase transition is favored.\n", "  A set of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of the influence of\nphotoionising radiation and stellar winds on a series of 10$^{4}$M$_{\\odot}$\nturbulent molecular clouds with initial virial ratios of 0.7, 1.1, 1.5, 1.9 and\n2.3 and initial mean densities of 136, 1135 and 9096\\,cm$^{-3}$ are presented.\nReductions in star formation efficiency rates are found to be modest, in the\nrange $30\\%-50\\%$ and to not vary greatly across the parameter space. In no\ncase was star formation entirely terminated over the $\\approx3$\\,Myr duration\nof the simulations. The fractions of material unbound by feedback are in the\nrange $20-60\\%$, clouds with the lowest escape velocities being the most\nstrongly affected.\\\\ Leakage of ionised gas leads to the HII regions rapidly\nbecoming underpressured. The destructive effects of ionisation are thus largely\nnot due to thermally--driven expansion of the HII regions, but to momentum\ntransfer by photoevaporation of fresh material. Our simulations have similar\nglobal ionisation rates and we show that the effects of feedback upon them can\nbe adequately modelled as a steady injection of momentum, resembling a\nmomentum--conserving wind.\n", "  The spin noise signal in the Faraday-rotation-based detection technique can\nbe considered equally correctly either as a manifestation of the spin-flip\nRaman effect or as a result of light scattering in the medium with fluctuating\ngyrotropy. In this paper, we present rigorous description of the signal\nformation process upon heterodyning of the field scattered due to fluctuating\ngyrotropy. Along with conventional single-beam experimental arrangement, we\nconsider here a more complicated, but more informative, two-beam configuration\nthat implies the use of an auxiliary light beam passing through the same\nscattering volume and delivering additional scattered field to the detector. We\nshow that the signal in the spin noise spectroscopy arising due to heterodyning\nof the scattered field is formed only by the scattered field components whose\nwave vectors coincide with those of the probe beam. Therefore, in principle,\nthe detected signal in spin noise spectroscopy can be increased by increasing\noverlap of the two fields in the momentum space. We also show that, in the\ntwo-beam geometry, contribution of the auxiliary (tilted) beam to the detected\nsignal is represented by Fourier transform of the gyrotropy relief at the\ndifference of two wave vectors. This effect can be used to study spin\ncorrelations by means of noise spectroscopy.\n", "  We consider a set of radiative contributions from one-loop lepton vacuum\npolarization to the hyperfine splitting of true muonium. Improving previous\nresults, we obtain values for the electron-loop coefficients and extract their\nleading dependence upon $\\beta=m_\\mu/m_e$. The coefficients are\n$C^{\\mu}_{20,1{\\rm VPCT}}=0.734931603\\beta$, $C^{\\mu}_{20,1{\\rm\nVPCA}}=0.551198702\\beta$, and $C^\\mu_{20,1{\\rm VPT}}=0.419149715\\beta$. The\nmass-independent contribution from three one-loop vacuum polarization is\n$C_{40,{\\rm VPX}}=\\frac{1}{127575}\\left(-5255-2016\\pi^2+51840\\zeta(3)\\right)$.\nContributions from $\\tau$ up to $\\mathcal{O}(m_\\mu\\alpha^8)$ are calculated.\n", "  We examine the 2008-2016 $\\gamma$-ray and optical light curves of three\nbright BL Lac objects, 0716+714, MRK 421, BL Lac, which exhibit large\nstructured variability. We searched for periodicities by using a fully Bayesian\napproach. For two out of three sources investigated no significant periodic\nvariability was found. In the case of BL Lac we detected a periodicity of ~ 680\ndays. Although the signal related to this is modest, the coincidence of the\nperiods in both gamma and optical bands is indicative of a physical relevance.\nConsidering previous literature results, possibly related $\\gamma$-ray and\noptical periodicities of about one year time scale are proposed in 4 bright\n$\\gamma$-ray blazars out of the 10 examined in detail. Comparing with results\nfrom periodicity search of optical archives of quasars, the presence of\nquasi-periodicities in blazars might be more frequent by a large factor. This\nsuggests the intriguing possibility that the basic conditions for their\nobservability are related to the relativistic jet in the observer direction,\nbut the overall picture remains uncertain.\n", "  We suggest a simple approach to populate photonic quantum materials at\nnon-zero chemical potential and near-zero temperature. Taking inspiration from\nforced evaporation in cold-atom experiments, the essential ingredients for our\nlow-entropy thermal reservoir are (a) inter-particle interactions, and (b)\nenergy-dependent loss. The resulting thermal reservoir may then be coupled to a\nbroad class of Hamiltonian systems to produce low-entropy quantum phases. We\npresent an idealized picture of such a reservoir, deriving the scaling of\nreservoir entropy with system parameters, and then propose several practical\nimplementations using only standard circuit quantum electrodynamics tools, and\nextract the fundamental performance limits. Finally, we explore, both\nanalytically and numerically, the coupling of such a thermalizer to the\nparadigmatic Bose-Hubbard chain, where we employ it to stabilize an $n=1$ Mott\nphase. In this case, the performance is limited by the interplay of dynamically\narrested thermalization of the Mott insulator and finite heat capacity of the\nthermalizer, characterized by its repumping rate. This work explores a new\napproach to preparation of quantum phases of strongly interacting photons, and\nprovides a potential route to topologically protected phases that are difficult\nto reach through adiabatic evolution.\n", "  Usual gauge fixing procedures in classical general relativity rely on the\nexistence of solutions of a second order wave equation. We propose to use the\nequation to relate asymptotic symmetries at infinity to asymptotic symmetries\nof a black hole horizon, in tune with recent proposals. We illustrate the\nconstruction for the BTZ and four-dimensional Kerr black holes. We find in both\ncases a realization of the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle $S^1$.\n", "  We report on subarcsecond observations of complex organic molecules (COMs) in\nthe high-mass protostar IRAS20126+4104 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer\nin its most extended configurations. In addition to the simple molecules SO,\nHNCO and H2-13CO, we detect emission from CH3CN, CH3OH, HCOOH, HCOOCH3,\nCH3OCH3, CH3CH2CN, CH3COCH3, NH2CN, and (CH2OH)2. SO and HNCO present a\nX-shaped morphology consistent with tracing the outflow cavity walls. Most of\nthe COMs have their peak emission at the putative position of the protostar,\nbut also show an extension towards the south(east), coinciding with an H2 knot\nfrom the jet at about 800-1000 au from the protostar. This is especially clear\nin the case of H2-13CO and CH3OCH3. We fitted the spectra at representative\npositions for the disc and the outflow, and found that the abundances of most\nCOMs are comparable at both positions, suggesting that COMs are enhanced in\nshocks as a result of the passage of the outflow. By coupling a parametric\nshock model to a large gas-grain chemical network including COMs, we find that\nthe observed COMs should survive in the gas phase for about 2000 yr, comparable\nto the shock lifetime estimated from the water masers at the outflow position.\nOverall, our data indicate that COMs in IRAS20126+4104 may arise not only from\nthe disc, but also from dense and hot regions associated with the outflow.\n", "  The Lindblad dynamics with dephasing in the bulk and magnetization-driving at\nthe two boundaries is studied for the quantum spin chain with random fields\n$h_j$ and couplings $J_j$ (that can be either uniform or random). In the regime\nof strong disorder in the random fields, or in the regime of strong\nbulk-dephasing, the effective dynamics can be mapped onto a classical Simple\nSymmetric Exclusion Process with quenched disorder in the diffusion coefficient\nassociated to each bond. The properties of the corresponding\nNon-Equilibrium-Steady-State in each disordered sample between the two\nreservoirs are studied in detail by extending the methods that have been\npreviously developed for the Symmetric Exclusion Process without disorder.\nExplicit results are given for the magnetization profile, for the two-point\ncorrelations, for the mean current and for the current fluctuations, in terms\nof the random fields and couplings defining the disordered sample.\n", "  The mass-loss process from evolved stars is a key ingredient for our\nunderstanding of many fields of astrophysics, including stellar evolution and\nthe chemical enrichment of the interstellar medium via stellar yields. One the\nmain unsolved questions is the geometry of the mass-loss process. Taking\nadvantage of the results from the Herschel Mass loss of Evolved StarS (MESS)\nprogramme, we initiated a coordinated effort to characterise the geometry of\nmass loss from evolved red giants at various spatial scales. For this purpose\nwe used the MID-infrared interferometric Instrument (MIDI) to resolve the inner\nenvelope of 14 asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs) in the MESS sample. In this\ncontribution we present an overview of the interferometric data collected\nwithin the frame of our Large Programme, and we also add archive data for\ncompleteness. We studied the geometry of the inner atmosphere by comparing the\nobservations with predictions from different geometric models. Asymmetries are\ndetected for five O-rich and S-type, suggesting that asymmetries in the N band\nare more common among stars with such chemistry. We speculate that this fact is\nrelated to the characteristics of the dust grains. Except for one star, no\ninterferometric variability is detected, i.e. the changes in size of the shells\nof non-mira stars correspond to changes of the visibility of less than 10%. The\nobserved spectral variability confirms previous findings from the literature.\nThe detection of dust in our sample follows the location of the AGBs in the\nIRAS colour-colour diagram: more dust is detected around oxygen-rich stars in\nregion II and in the carbon stars in region VII. The SiC dust feature does not\nappear in the visibility spectrum of UAnt and SSct, which are two carbon stars\nwith detached shells. This finding has implications for the theory of SiC dust\nformation.\n", "  We provide a parametrization of a new phenomenological scaling function\nobtained from a chi-square fit to a selected set of (e,e') cross section data\nexpanding a band centered around the quasielastic peak. We start from a\nre-analysis of quasielastic electron scattering from nuclear matter within the\nrelativistic mean field model. The cross section depends on the relativistic\neffective mass of the nucleon, $m_N^*$, and it scales with respect to a new\nscaling variable, $\\psi^*$. This suggests a new superscaling approach with\neffective mass (SuSAM*) for predicting quasielastic cross sections within an\nuncertainty band. The model reproduces previously established results on the\nenhancement of the transverse response function as compared to the traditional\nrelativistic Fermi gas.\n", "  The similarity of the host galaxy of FRB 121102 with those of long gamma-ray\nbursts and Type I super-luminous supernovae suggests that this FRB could be\nassociated with a young magnetar. By assuming the FRB emission to be produced\nwithin the magnetosphere, we derive a lower limit on the age of the magnetar,\nafter which GHz emission is able to escape freely from the dense relativistic\nwind of the magnetar. Another lower limit is obtained by requiring the\ndispersion measure contributed by the electron/positron pair wind to be\nconsistent with the observations of the host galaxy. Furthermore, we also\nderive some upper limits on the magnetar age with discussions on possible\nenergy sources of the FRB emission and the recently-discovered persistent radio\ncounterpart. As a result, some constraints on model parameters are addressed by\nreconciling the lower limits with the possible upper limits that are derived\nwith an assumption of rotational energy source.\n", "  Following the idea that hydrogen-rich compounds might be high-T$_c$\nsuperconductors at high pressures, and the very recent breakthrough in\npredicting and synthesizing hydrogen sulfide with record-high T$_c$ = 203 K, ab\ninitio evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction was employed to\nfind stable germanium hydrides. In addition to the earlier structure of germane\nwith space group Ama2, we propose a new C2/m structure, which is energetically\nmore favorable at pressures above 278 GPa (with inclusion of zero point\nenergy). Our calculations indicate metallicity of the new C2/m phase of germane\nwith T$_c$ = 67 K at 280 GPa. Germane is found to exhibit thermodynamic\ninstability to decomposition to hydrogen and the new compound Ge$_3$H$_{11}$ at\npressures above 300 GPa. Ge$_3$H$_{11}$ with space group I$\\bar{4}$m2 is found\nto become stable at above 285 GPa with T$_c$ = 43 K. We find that the\npressure-induced phase stability of germanium hydrides is distinct from its\nanalogous isoelectronic systems, e.g., Si-hydrides and Sn-hydrides.\nSuperconductivity stems from large electron-phonon coupling associated with the\nwagging, bending and stretching intermediate-frequency modes derived mainly\nfrom hydrogen.\n", "  We study the emergence of anisotropic (Bianchi IX) inflationary universes\nwith no-boundary conditions in the path integral approach to quantum gravity.\nIn contrast to previous work, we find no evidence for any limit to how large\nthe anisotropies can become, although for increasing anisotropies the shape of\nthe instantons becomes significantly different from Hawking's original\nno-boundary instanton. In all cases an inflationary phase is reached, with the\nanisotropies decaying away. Larger anisotropies are associated with a much\nlarger imaginary part of the action, implying that the highly anisotropic\nbranches of the wavefunction are heavily suppressed. Interestingly, the\npresence of anisotropies causes the wavefunction to become classical much more\nslowly than for isotropic inflationary universes. We derive the associated\nscaling of the WKB classicality conditions both numerically and analytically.\n", "  We derive a direct correlation between the power spectrum and bispectrum of\nthe primordial curvature perturbation in terms of the Goldstone mode based on\nthe effective field theory approach to inflation. We show examples of\ncorrelated bispectra for the parametrized feature models presented by the\nPlanck collaboration. We also discuss the consistency relation and the validity\nof our explicit correlation between the power spectrum and bispectrum.\n", "  The need to increase data transfer rates constitutes a key challenge in\nmodern information-driven societies. Taking advantage of the transverse spatial\nmodes of light to encode more information is a promising avenue for both\nclassical and quantum photonics. However, to ease access to the encoded\ninformation, it is essential to be able to sort spatial modes into different\noutput channels. Here, we introduce a novel way to customize the sorting of\narbitrary spatial light modes. Our method relies on the high degree of control\nover random scattering processes by preshaping of the phase structure of the\nincident light. We demonstrate experimentally that various sets of modes,\nirrespective of their specific modal structure, can be transformed to any\noutput channel arrangement. Thus, our method enables full access to all of the\ninformation encoded in the transverse structure of the field, for example,\nazimuthal and radial modes. We also demonstrate that coherence is retained in\nthis complex mode transformation, which opens up applications in quantum and\nclassical information science.\n", "  We discuss the effect of heavy new physics, parameterised in terms of\nfour-fermion operators, in the polarisation of single top (anti-)quarks in the\n$t$-channel process at the LHC. It is found that for operators involving a\nright-handed top quark field the relative effect on the longitudinal\npolarisation is twice larger than the relative effect on the total cross\nsection. This enhanced dependence on possible four-fermion contributions makes\nthe polarisation measurements specially interesting, in particular at high\nmomenta.\n", "  We constructed an effective tight-binding model with five Cr $3d$ orbitals\nfor LaOCrAs according to first-principles calculations. Basing on this model,\nwe investigated possible superconductivity induced by correlations in doped\nLaOCrAs using the functional renormalization group (FRG). We find that there\nare two domes of superconductivity in electron-doped LaOCrAs. With increasing\nelectron doping, the ground state of the system evolves from G-type\nantiferromagnetism in the parent compound to an incipient $s_\\pm$-wave\nsuperconducting phase dominated by electron bands derived from the\n$d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital as the filling is above $4.2$ electrons per site on the\n$d$-orbitals of Cr. The gap function has strong octet anisotropy on the Fermi\npocket around the zone center and diminishes on the other pockets. In electron\nover-doped LaOCrAs, the system develops $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting\nphase and the active band derives from the $d_{xy}$ orbital. Inbetween the two\nsuperconducting domes, a time-reversal symmetry breaking $s+id$ SC phase is\nlikely to occur. We also find $s_\\pm$-wave superconducting phase in the\nhole-doped case.\n", "  We consider an asymptotically free vectorial SU($N_c$) gauge theory with\n$N_f$ massless fermions in a representation $R$, having an infrared fixed point\n(IRFP) of the renormalization group at $\\alpha_{IR}$ in the conformal\nnon-Abelian Coulomb phase. The cases with $R$ equal to the fundamental,\nadjoint, and symmetric rank-2 tensor representation are considered. We present\nscheme-independent calculations of the anomalous dimension\n$\\gamma_{\\bar\\psi\\psi,IR}$ to $O(\\Delta_f^4)$ and $\\beta'_{IR}$ to\n$O(\\Delta_f^5)$ at this IRFP, where $\\Delta_f$ is an $N_f$-dependent expansion\nparameter. Comparisons are made with conventional $n$-loop calculations and\nlattice measurements. As a test of the accuracy of the $\\Delta_f$ expansion, we\ncalculate $\\gamma_{\\bar\\psi\\psi,IR}$ to $O(\\Delta_f^3)$ in ${\\cal N}=1$\nSU($N_c$) supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics and find complete agreement, to\nthis order, with the exactly known expression. The $\\Delta_f$ expansion also\navoids a problem in which an IRFP may not be manifest as an IR zero of a higher\n$n$-loop beta function.\n", "  Long-range interactions in triple quantum dots (TQDs) in Kondo regime are\ninvestigated by accurately solving the three-impurity Anderson model. For the\noccupation configuration of (N1,N2,N3) = (1, 0, 1), a long-range\nantiferromagnetic exchange interaction (JAF) is demonstrated and induces a\ncontinuous phase transition from the separated Kondo singlet (KS) to the\nlong-range spin singlet (LSS) state between edge dots. The expression of JAF is\nanalytically derived and numerically verified, according to which JAF can be\nconveniently manipulated via gate control of the detuning energy. The\nlong-range entanglement of Kondo clouds are proved to be quite robust at strong\ninter-dot coupling limit. Under equilibrium condition, it induces an unexpected\npeak in the spectral function of the middle dot whose singly occupied level\nkeeps much higher than the Fermi level. Under nonequilibrium condition, higher\ninter-dot tunneling barrier induces an anomalous enhancement of current. These\nnovel features can be observed in routine experiments.\n", "  We provide a mapping between past null and future null infinity in\nthree-dimensional flat space, using symmetry considerations. From this we\nderive a mapping between the corresponding asymptotic symmetry groups. By\nstudying the metric at asymptotic regions, we find that the mapping is energy\npreserving and yields an infinite number of conservation laws.\n", "  We compute the one-loop quantum corrections to the gravitational potentials\nof a spinning point particle in a de Sitter background, due to the vacuum\npolarisation induced by conformal fields in an effective field theory approach.\nWe consider arbitrary conformal field theories, assuming only that the theory\ncontains a large number $N$ of fields in order to separate their contribution\nfrom the one induced by virtual gravitons. The corrections are described in a\ngauge-invariant way, classifying the induced metric perturbations around the de\nSitter background according to their behaviour under transformations on\nequal-time hypersurfaces. There are six gauge-invariant modes: two scalar\nBardeen potentials, one transverse vector and one transverse traceless tensor,\nof which one scalar and the vector couple to the spinning particle. The quantum\ncorrections consist of three different parts: a generalisation of the\nflat-space correction, which is only significant at distances of the order of\nthe Planck length; a constant correction depending on the undetermined\nparameters of the renormalised effective action; and a term which grows\nlogarithmically with the distance from the particle. This last term is the most\ninteresting, and when resummed gives a modified power law, enhancing the\ngravitational force at large distances. As a check on the accuracy of our\ncalculation, we recover the linearised Kerr-de Sitter metric in the classical\nlimit and the flat-space quantum correction in the limit of vanishing Hubble\nconstant.\n", "  Massive, O and early B-type (OB) stars remain incompletely catalogued in the\nnearby Galaxy due to high extinction, bright visible and infrared nebular\nemission in H II regions, and high field star contamination. These difficulties\nare alleviated by restricting the search to stars with X-ray emission. Using\nthe X-ray point sources from the Massive Young star-forming complex Study in\nInfrared and X-rays (MYStIX) survey of OB-dominated regions, we identify 98\nMYStIX candidate OB (MOBc) stars by fitting their 1-8 micron spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) with reddened stellar atmosphere models. We identify 27\nadditional MOBc stars based on JHK photometry of X-ray stars lacking SED\nfitting. These candidate OB stars indicate that the current census of stars\nearlier than B1, taken across the 18 MYStIX regions studied, is less than 50%\ncomplete. We also fit the SEDs of 239 previously-published OB stars to measure\ninterstellar extinction and bolometric luminosities, revealing six candidate\nmassive binary systems and five candidate O-type (super)giants. As expected,\ncandidate OB stars have systematically higher extinction than\npreviously-published OB stars. Notable results for individual regions include:\nidentification of the OB population of a recently discovered massive cluster in\nNGC 6357; an older OB association in the M17 complex; and new massive luminous\nO stars near the Trifid Nebula. In several relatively poorly-studied regions\n(RCW 38, NGC 6334, NGC 6357, Trifid, and NGC 3576), the OB populations may\nincrease by factors of >2.\n", "  Buoyancy of proton vortices is considered as one of the important mechanisms\nof magnetic field expulsion from the superconducting interiors of neutron\nstars. Here we show that the generally accepted expression for the buoyancy\nforce is not correct and should be modified. The correct expression is derived\nfor both neutron and proton vortices. It is argued that this force is already\ncontained in the coarse-grained hydrodynamics of Bekarevich & Khalatnikov and\nits various multifluid extensions, but is absent in the hydrodynamics of Hall.\nSome potentially interesting buoyancy-related effects are briefly discussed.\n", "  In the early stages of heavy-ion collisions, the hot QCD matter expands more\nlongitudinally than transversely. This imbalance causes the system to become\nrapidly colder in the longitudinal direction and a local momentum anisotropy\nappears. In this paper, we study the heavy-quarkonium spectrum in the presence\nof a small plasma anisotropy. We work in the framework of pNRQCD at finite\ntemperature. We inspect arrangements of non-relativistic and thermal scales\ncomplementary to those considered in the literature. In particular, we consider\ntemperatures larger and Debye masses smaller than the binding energy, which is\na temperature range relevant for presently running LHC experiments. In this\nsetting we compute the leading thermal corrections to the binding energy and\nthe thermal width induced by quarkonium gluo-dissociation.\n", "  We targeted the massive star forming region W33A using the Atacama Large\nSub/Millimeter Array (ALMA) in band 6 (230 GHz) and 7 (345 GHz) to search for a\nsub-1000au disc around the central O-type massive young stellar object (MYSO)\nW33A MM1-Main. Our data achieves a resolution of ~0.2\" (~500au) and resolves\nthe central core, MM1, into multiple components and reveals complex and\nfilamentary structures. There is strong molecular line emission covering the\nentire MM1 region. The kinematic signatures are inconsistent with only\nKeplerian rotation although we propose that the shift in the emission line\ncentroids within ~1000au of MM1-Main could hint at an underlying compact disc\nwith Keplerian rotation. We cannot however rule out the possibility of an\nunresolved binary or multiple system. A putative smaller disc could be fed by\nthe large scale spiral `feeding filament' we detect in both gas and dust\nemission. We also discuss the nature of the now-resolved continuum sources.\n", "  Constraints on primordial black holes in the range $10^{-18} M_{\\odot}$ to\n$10^{3} M_{\\odot}$ are reevaluated for a general class of extended mass\nfunctions. Whereas previous work has assumed that PBHs are produced with one\nsingle mass, instead there is expected to be a range of masses even in the case\nof production from a single mechanism; constraints therefore change from\nprevious literature. Although tightly constrained in the majority of cases, it\nis shown that, even under conservative assumptions, primordial black holes in\nthe mass range $10^{-10} M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{-8} M_{\\odot}$ could still\nconstitute the entirety of the dark matter. This stresses both the importance\nfor a comprehensive reevaluation of all respective constraints that have\npreviously been evaluated only for a monochromatic mass function, and the need\nto obtain more constraints in the allowed mass range.\n", "  The central parsec of the Milky Way hosts two puzzlingly young stellar\npopulations, a tight isotropic distribution of B stars around SgrA* (the\nS-stars) and a disk of OB stars extending to ~0.5pc. Using a modified version\nof Sverre Aarseth's direct summation code NBODY6 we explore the scenario in\nwhich a young star cluster migrates to the Galactic Centre within the lifetime\nof the OB disk population via dynamical friction. We find that star clusters\nmassive and dense enough to reach the central parsec form a very massive star\nvia physical collisions on a mass segregation timescale. We follow the\nevolution of the merger product using the most up to date, yet conservative,\nmass loss recipes for very massive stars. Over a large range of initial\nconditions, we find that the very massive star expels most of its mass via a\nstrong stellar wind, eventually collapsing to form a black hole of mass 20 -\n400 M_Sun, incapable of bringing massive stars to the Galactic Centre. No\nmassive intermediate mass black hole can form in this scenario. The presence of\na star cluster in the central ~10 pc within the last 15 Myr would also leave a\n~2 pc ring of massive stars, which is not currently observed. Thus, we conclude\nthat the star cluster migration model is highly unlikely to be the origin of\neither young population, and in-situ formation models or binary disruptions are\nfavoured.\n", "  A previous formal derivation of the effective chiral Lagrangian for low-lying\npseudoscalar mesons from first-principles QCD without approximations [Wang et\nal., Phys. Rev. D61, (2000) 54011] is generalized to further include scalar,\nvector, and axial-vector mesons. In the large Nc limit and with an Abelian\napproximation, we show that the properties of the newly added mesons in our\nformalism are determined by the corresponding underlying fundamental\nhomogeneous Bethe--Salpeter equation in the ladder approximation, which yields\nthe equations of motion for the scalar, vector, and axial-vector meson fields\nat the level of an effective chiral Lagrangian. The masses appearing in the\nequations of motion of the meson fields are those determined by the\ncorresponding Bethe--Salpeter equation.\n", "  The field equation for a spin 1/2 massive charged particle propagating in\nspacetimes that are the direct product of 2-dimensional spaces is separated.\nMoreover, we use this result to attain the separability of the Dirac equation\nin some specific static black hole solutions whose horizons have topology\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathbb{S}^2 \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{S}^2$.\n", "  We present a new 5-GHz global-VLBI image of supernova 1986J, observed in 2014\nat $t=31.6$ yr after the explosion, and compare it to previous images to show\nthe evolution of the supernova. Our new image has a dynamic range of ~100 and a\nbackground rms noise level of 5.9 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. There is no significant\nlinear polarization, with the image peak being $<$3% polarized. The latest\nimage is dominated by the compact central component, whose flux density is now\ncomparable to that of the extended supernova shell. This central component is\nmarginally resolved with a FWHM width of $900_{-500}^{+100} \\; \\mu$as,\ncorresponding to a radius of $r_{\\rm comp}=6.7 _{-3.7}^{+0.7} \\times 10^{16}$\ncm for a distance of 10 Mpc. Using VLBI observations between 2002 and 2014, we\nmeasured the proper motions of both the central component and a hot-spot to the\nNE in the shell relative to the quasar 3C66A. The central component is\nstationary to within the uncertainty of 12 $\\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, corresponding to\n570 km s$^{-1}$. Our observations argue in favor of the central component being\nlocated near the physical center of SN 1986J. The shell hot-spot had a mean\nvelocity of 2810+-750 km s$^{-1}$ to the NE, which is consistent with it taking\npart in the homologous expansion of the shell seen earlier. The shell emission\nis evolving in a non-selfsimilar fashion, with the brightest emission shifting\ninwards within the structure, and with only relatively faint emission being\nseen near the outer edge and presumed forward shock. An animation is available.\n", "  We introduce a new generation of PARSEC-COLIBRI stellar isochrones that\ninclude a detailed treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch\n(TP-AGB) phase, and covering a wide range of initial metallicities\n(0.0001<Zi<0.06). Compared to previous releases, the main novelties and\nimprovements are: use of new TP-AGB tracks and related atmosphere models and\nspectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in\nthe isochrone tables, accounting for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up\nepisodes and hot-bottom burning; inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles,\nwith a complete description of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters;\nnew pulsation models to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental\nand first overtone modes; new dust models that follow the growth of the grains\nduring the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer calculations\nfor the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall, these improvements\nare expected to lead to a more consistent and detailed description of\nproperties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved stellar populations, especially\nin regard to their mean photometric properties from optical to mid-infrared\nwavelengths. We illustrate the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different\ntypes in stellar populations covering a wide range of ages and initial\nmetallicities, providing further details on the C-star island that appears at\nintermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the AGB-boosting effect\nthat occurs at ages close to 1.6 Gyr for populations of all metallicities. The\nisochrones are available through a new dedicated web server.\n", "  The crystallographic, magnetic, and transport properties of the van der Waals\nbonded, layered compound CrTe3 have been investigated on single crystal and\npolycrystalline materials. The crystal structure contains layers made up of\nlozenge shaped Cr_4 tetramers. Electrical resistivity measurements show the\ncrystals to be semiconducting, with a temperature dependence consistent with a\nband gap of 0.3eV. The magnetic susceptibility exhibits a broad maximum near\n300K characteristic of low dimensional magnetic systems. Weak anomalies are\nobserved in the susceptibility and heat capacity near 55K, and single crystal\nneutron diffraction reveals the onset of long range antiferromagnetic order at\nthis temperature. Strongly dispersive spin-waves are observed in the ordered\nstate. Significant magneto-elastic coupling is indicated by the anomalous\ntemperature dependence of the lattice parameters and is apparent in structural\noptimization in van der Waals density functional theory calculations for\ndifferent magnetic configurations. The cleavability of the compound is apparent\nfrom its handling and is confirmed by first principles calculations, which\npredict a cleavage energy 0.5J/m^2, similar to graphite. Based on these\nresults, CrTe3 is identified as a promising compound for studies of low\ndimensional magnetism in bulk crystals as well as magnetic order in monolayer\nmaterials and van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  A lattice computation of the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment can potentially help reduce the error on the Standard\nModel prediction for this quantity, if sufficient control of all systematic\nerrors affecting such a computation can be achieved. One of these systematic\nerrors is that associated with the extrapolation to the physical pion mass from\nvalues on the lattice larger than the physical pion mass. We investigate this\nextrapolation assuming lattice pion masses in the range of 200 to 400MeV with\nthe help of two-loop chiral perturbation theory, and find that such an\nextrapolation is unlikely to lead to control of this systematic error at the 1%\nlevel. This remains true even if various tricks to improve the reliability of\nthe chiral extrapolation employed in the literature are taken into account. In\naddition, while chiral perturbation theory also predicts the dependence on the\npion mass of the leading-order hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment as the chiral limit is approached, this prediction turns out to\nbe of no practical use, because the physical pion mass is larger than the muon\nmass that sets the scale for the onset of this behavior.\n", "  Stars are self-gravitating fluids in which pressure, buoyancy, rotation and\nmagnetic fields provide the restoring forces for global modes of oscillation.\nPressure and buoyancy energetically dominate, while rotation and magnetism are\ngenerally assumed to be weak perturbations and often ignored. However,\nobservations of anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes in red giant stars\nsuggest that a substantial fraction of these are subject to an additional\nsource of damping localised to their core region, with indirect evidence\npointing to the role of a deeply buried magnetic field. It is also known that\nin many instances the gravity-mode character of affected modes is preserved,\nbut so far no effective damping mechanism has been proposed that accommodates\nthis aspect. Here we present such a mechanism, which damps the oscillations of\nstars harbouring magnetised cores via resonant interactions with standing\nAlfv\\'en modes of high harmonic index. The damping rates produced by this\nmechanism are quantitatively on par with those associated with turbulent\nconvection, and in the range required to explain observations, for realistic\nstellar models and magnetic field strengths. Our results suggest that magnetic\nfields can provide an efficient means of damping stellar oscillations without\nneeding to disrupt the internal structure of the modes, and lay the groundwork\nfor an extension of the theory of global stellar oscillations that incorporates\nthese effects.\n", "  We report that a longitudinal epsilon-near-zero (LENZ) film leads to giant\nfield enhancement and strong radiation emission of sources in it and that these\nfeatures are superior to what found in previous studies related to isotropic\nENZ. LENZ films are uniaxially anisotropic films where relative permittivity\nalong the normal direction to the film is much smaller than unity, while the\npermittivity in the transverse plane of the film is not vanishing. It has been\nshown previously that realistic isotropic ENZ films do not provide large field\nenhancement due to material losses, however, we show the loss effects can be\novercome using LENZ films. We also prove that in comparison to the (isotropic)\nENZ case, the LENZ film field enhancement is not only remarkably larger but it\nalso occurs for a wider range of angles of incidence. Importantly, the field\nenhancement near the interface of the LENZ film is almost independent of the\nthickness unlike for the isotropic ENZ case where extremely small thickness is\nrequired. We show that for a LENZ structure consisting of a multilayer of\ndysprosium-doped cadmium oxide and silicon accounting for realistic losses,\nfield intensity enhancement of 30 is obtained which is almost 10 times larger\nthan that obtained with realistic ENZ materials\n", "  While Wigner functions forming phase space representation of quantum states\nis a well-known fact, their construction for noncommutative quantum mechanics\n(NCQM) remains relatively lesser known, in particular with respect to gauge\ndependencies. This paper deals with the construction of Wigner functions of\nNCQM for a system of 2-degrees of freedom using 2-parameter families of gauge\nequivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Lie\ngroup $\\g$ which has been identified as the kinematical symmetry group of NCQM\nin an earlier paper. This general construction of Wigner functions for NCQM, in\nturn, yields the special cases of Landau and symmetric gauges of NCQM.\n", "  Using the redMaPPer cluster catalogue based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) photometry, we investigate the importance of major mergers in the\nstellar mass build-up of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) between $0.08 \\leq z\n\\leq 0.50$. We use the SDSS spectroscopy, supplemented with spectroscopic\nobservations from the Southern African Large Telescope at higher redshifts, to\nidentify which BCGs and nearby companions are potential major merger\ncandidates. We use the pair fraction as a proxy for the merger fraction in\norder to determine how much stellar mass growth the BCGs have experienced due\nto major mergers. We observe a weak trend of the BCG pair fraction increasing\nwith decreasing redshift, suggesting that major mergers may become more\nimportant towards the present day. Major mergers are found to contribute, on\naverage, $24 \\pm 14 $ $(29 \\pm 17)$ per cent towards the stellar mass of a\npresent day BCG since $z=0.32$ (0.45), assuming that half of the companion's\nstellar mass is accreted onto the BCG. Furthermore, using our merger results in\nconjunction with predictions from two recent semi-analytical models along with\nobservational measurements from the literature, we find that major mergers have\nsufficient stellar material to account for the stellar mass growth of the\nintracluster light between $z=0.3$ and $z=0$.\n", "  The study of invisibility of an infinite dielectric rod with high refractive\nindex is based on the two-dimensional Mie scattering problem, and it suggests\nstrong suppression of scattering due to the Fano interference between\nspectrally broad nonresonant waves and narrow Mie-resonant modes. However, when\nthe dielectric rod has a finite extension, it becomes a resonator supporting\nthe Fabry-Perot modes which introduce additional scattering and eventually\ndestroy the invisibility. Here we reveal that for shorter rods with modest\nvalues of the aspect ratio r/L (where r and L are the radius and length of the\nrod, respectively), the lowest spectral window of the scattering suppression\nrecovers completely, so that even a finite-size resonator may become invisible.\nWe present a direct experimental verification of the concept of switchable\ninvisibility at microwaves using a cylindrical finite-size resonator with high\nrefractive index.\n", "  Canards are special solutions to ordinary differential equations that follow\ninvariant repelling slow manifolds for long time intervals. In realistic\nbiophysical single cell models, canards are responsible for several complex\nneural rhythms observed experimentally, but their existence and role in\nspatially-extended systems is largely unexplored. We describe a novel type of\ncoherent structure in which a spatial pattern displays temporal canard\nbehaviour. Using interfacial dynamics and geometric singular perturbation\ntheory, we classify spatio-temporal canards and give conditions for the\nexistence of folded-saddle and folded-node canards. We find that\nspatio-temporal canards are robust to changes in the synaptic connectivity and\nfiring rate. The theory correctly predicts the existence of spatio-temporal\ncanards with octahedral symmetries in a neural field model posed on the unit\nsphere.\n", "  We report the discovery of HAT-P-67b, a hot-Saturn transiting a rapidly\nrotating F-subgiant. HAT-P-67b has a radius of Rp = 2.085 -0.071/+0.096 RJ,,\norbiting a M* = 1.642 -0.072/+0.155 Msun, R* = 2.546 -0.084/+0.099 Rsun host\nstar in a ~4.81-day period orbit. We place an upper limit on the mass of the\nplanet via radial velocity measurements to be Mp < 0.59 MJ, and lower limit of\n> 0.056 MJ by limitations on Roche lobe overflow. Despite being a subgiant, the\nhost star still exhibits relatively rapid rotation, with a projected rotational\nvelocity of v sin I* = 35.8 +/- 1.1 km/s, making it difficult to precisely\ndetermine the mass of the planet using radial velocities. We validated\nHAT-P-67b via two Doppler tomographic detections of the planetary transit,\nwhich eliminated potential eclipsing binary blend scenarios. The Doppler\ntomographic observations also confirmed that HAT-P-67b has an orbit that is\naligned to within 12 degrees, in projection, with the spin of its host star.\nHAT-P-67b receives strong UV irradiation, and is amongst the one of the lowest\ndensity planets known, making it a good candidate for future UV transit\nobservations to search for an extended hydrogen exosphere.\n", "  Observations of astrophysical objects such as galaxies are limited by various\nsources of random and systematic noise from the sky background, the optical\nsystem of the telescope and the detector used to record the data. Conventional\ndeconvolution techniques are limited in their ability to recover features in\nimaging data by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem. Here we train a\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN) on a sample of $4,550$ images of nearby\ngalaxies at $0.01<z<0.02$ from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and conduct\n$10\\times$ cross validation to evaluate the results. We present a method using\na GAN trained on galaxy images that can recover features from artificially\ndegraded images with worse seeing and higher noise than the original with a\nperformance which far exceeds simple deconvolution. The ability to better\nrecover detailed features such as galaxy morphology from low-signal-to-noise\nand low angular resolution imaging data significantly increases our ability to\nstudy existing data sets of astrophysical objects as well as future\nobservations with observatories such as the Large Synoptic Sky Telescope (LSST)\nand the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.\n", "  We report the observation and physical characterization of the possible dwarf\nplanet \\UZ\\ (\"DeeDee\"), a dynamically detached trans-Neptunian object\ndiscovered at 92 AU. This object is currently the second-most distant known\ntrans-Neptunian object with reported orbital elements, surpassed in distance\nonly by the dwarf planet Eris. The object was discovered with an $r$-band\nmagnitude of 23.0 in data collected by the Dark Energy Survey between 2014 and\n2016. Its 1140-year orbit has $(a,e,i) = (109~\\mathrm{AU}, 0.65,\n26.8^{\\circ})$. It will reach its perihelion distance of 38 AU in the year\n2142. Integrations of its orbit show it to be dynamically stable on Gyr\ntimescales, with only weak interactions with Neptune. We have performed\nfollowup observations with ALMA, using 3 hours of on-source integration time to\nmeasure the object's thermal emission in the Rayleigh-Jeans tail. The signal is\ndetected at 7$\\sigma$ significance, from which we determine a $V$-band albedo\nof $13.1^{+3.3}_{-2.4}\\mathrm{(stat)}^{+2.0}_{-1.4}\\mathrm{(sys)}$ percent and\na diameter of $635^{+57}_{-61}\\mathrm{(stat)}^{+32}_{-39}\\mathrm{(sys)}$~km,\nassuming a spherical body with uniform surface properties.\n", "  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is involved in many regulatory and catalytic processes\nin the cell. The function of any RNA molecule is intimately related with its\nstructure. In-line probing experiments provide valuable structural datasets for\na variety of RNAs and are used to characterize conformational changes in\nriboswitches. However, the structural determinants that lead to differential\nreactivities in unpaired nucleotides have not been investigated yet. In this\nwork we used a combination of theoretical approaches, i.e., classical molecular\ndynamics simulations, multiscale quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical\ncalculations, and enhanced sampling techniques in order to compute and\ninterpret the differential reactivity of individual residues in several RNA\nmotifs including members of the most important GNRA and UNCG tetraloop\nfamilies. Simulations on the multi ns timescale are required to converge the\nrelated free-energy landscapes. The results for uGAAAg and cUUCGg tetraloops\nand double helices are compared with available data from in-line probing\nexperiments and show that the introduced technique is able to distinguish\nbetween nucleotides of the uGAAAg tetraloop based on their structural\npredispositions towards phosphodiester backbone cleavage. For the cUUCGg\ntetraloop, more advanced ab initio calculations would be required. This study\nis the first attempt to computationally classify chemical probing experiments\nand paves the way for an identification of tertiary structures based on the\nmeasured reactivity of non-reactive nucleotides.\n", "  We present an exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid with Abelian\nanyons in d=2 spatial dimensions. With spins 1/2 on a triangular lattice and\nsix-body interactions, our model has zero spin correlation length and localized\nelementary excitations like the toric codes of Kitaev and Wen. In contrast to\nthose earlier models, it has more elementary particles---4 bosons and 3\nfermions---and higher topological degeneracy of 64 on a torus. Elementary\nexcitations are boson-fermion pairs that come in 12 distinct flavors. We use\nstring operators to expose the topological nature of the model.\n", "  The precise knowledge of the atomic order in monocrystalline alloys is\nfundamental to understand and predict their physical properties. With this\nperspective, we utilized laser-assisted atom probe tomography to investigate\nthe three-dimensional distribution of atoms in non-equilibrium epitaxial\nSn-rich group IV SiGeSn ternary semiconductors. Different atom probe\nstatistical analysis tools including frequency distribution analysis, partial\nradial distribution functions, and nearest neighbor analysis were employed in\norder to evaluate and compare the behavior of the three elements to their\nspatial distributions in an ideal solid solution. This atomistic-level analysis\nprovided clear evidence of an unexpected repulsive interaction between Sn and\nSi leading to the deviation of Si atoms from the theoretical random\ndistribution. This departure from an ideal solid solution is supported by first\nprincipal calculations and attributed to the tendency of the system to reduce\nits mixing enthalpy throughout the layer-by-layer growth process.\n", "  The effects of fluctuations are discussed around the phase boundary of the\ninhomogeneous chiral transition between the inhomogeneous chiral phase and the\nchiral-restored phase. The particular roles of thermal and quantum fluctuations\nare elucidated and a continuity of their effects across the phase boundary is\nsuggested. In addition, it is argued that anomalies in the thermodynamic\nquantities should have phenomenological implications for the inhomogeneous\nchiral transition. Some common features for other phase transitions, such as\nthose from the normal to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov\nstate in superconductivity, are also emphasized.\n", "  We study the processes $e^+ e^- \\to \\ \\gamma_{\\rm ISR} J/\\psi$ where $J/\\psi\n\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$, $J/\\psi \\to K^+ K^- \\pi^0$, and $J/\\psi \\to K^0_S\nK^{\\pm} \\pi^{\\mp}$ using a data sample of 519 $fb^{-1}$ recorded with the BaBar\ndetector operating at the SLAC PEP-II asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider at\ncenter-of-mass energies at and near the $\\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n = 2,3,4$)\nresonances. We measure the ratio of branching fractions $R_1 = \\frac{B(J/\\psi \\\n\\to \\ K^+ K^- \\pi^0)}{B(J/\\psi \\ \\to \\ \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0)}$ and $R_2 =\n\\frac{B(J/\\psi \\ \\to \\ K^0_S K^{\\pm} \\pi^{\\mp})}{B(J/\\psi \\ \\to \\ \\pi^+ \\pi^-\n\\pi^0)}$. We perform Dalitz-plot analyses of the three $J/\\psi$ decay modes and\nmeasure fractions for resonances contributing to the decays. We also analyze\nthe $J/\\psi \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^0$ decay using the Veneziano model. We observe\nstructures compatible with the presence of $\\rho(1450)$ in all the three\n$J/\\psi$ decay modes and measure the relative branching fraction:\n$R(\\rho(1450)) = \\frac{B(\\rho(1450) \\ \\to \\ K^+ K^-)}{B(\\rho(1450) \\ \\to \\\n\\pi^+ \\pi^-)} = 0.307 \\pm 0.084 ({\\rm stat}) \\pm 0.082 ({\\rm sys})$.\n", "  We consider a single magnetic impurity described by the spin--anisotropic\ns-d(f) exchange (Kondo) model and formulate scaling equation for the\nspin-anisotropic model when the density of states (DOS) of electrons is a power\nlaw function of energy (measured relative to the Fermi energy). We solve this\nequation containing terms up to the second order in coupling constants in terms\nof elliptic functions. From the obtained solution we find the phases\ncorresponding to the infinite isotropic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange,\nto the impurity spin decoupled from the electron environment (only for the\npseudogap DOS), and to the infinite Ising exchange (only for the diverging\nDOS). We analyze the critical surfaces, corresponding to the finite isotropic\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange for the pseudogap DOS.\n", "  We consider the exclusive $P_{\\ell 4}$ decays, $P\\to (P_1P_2)_V\\ell\n\\nu_{\\ell}$, where the subindex $V$ means that the invariant mass of the\npseudoscalar pair is taken within a small window around the mass of the vector\nmeson $V$. Pole contributions beyond the dominant $P\\to V(\\to\nP_1P_2)\\ell\\nu_{\\ell}$ amplitude of $P_{\\ell 4}$ decays are identified, which,\nin turn, affects the determination of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{qq'}|$. We\nevaluate the effects of those contributions in the extraction of bottom and\ncharm quark mixings. An application to $B\\to (\\pi\\pi)_{\\rho}\\ell \\nu_{\\ell}$\ndata from Belle collaboration, shows an increase in the extracted value of\n$|V_{ub}|$ in better agreement with determinations based on $B\\to\n\\pi\\ell\\nu_{\\ell}$ decays. The effect of the $\\rho$ and $D^*$ pole\ncontributions in the determination of $|V_{cd}|$ from the decay $D\\to \\pi\\pi\n\\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell}$, has been also investigated.\n", "  The detection of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in Galactic globular\nclusters (GCs) has so far been controversial. In order to characterize the\neffectiveness of integrated-light spectroscopy through integral field units, we\nanalyze realistic mock data generated from state-of-the-art Monte Carlo\nsimulations of GCs with a central IMBH, considering different setups and\nconditions varying IMBH mass, cluster distance, and accuracy in determination\nof the center. The mock observations are modeled with isotropic Jeans models to\nassess the success rate in identifying the IMBH presence, which we find to be\nprimarily dependent on IMBH mass. However, even for a IMBH of considerable mass\n(3% of the total GC mass), the analysis does not yield conclusive results in 1\nout of 5 cases, because of shot noise due to bright stars close to the IMBH\nline-of-sight. This stochastic variability in the modeling outcome grows with\ndecreasing BH mass, with approximately 3 failures out of 4 for IMBHs with 0.1%\nof total GC mass. Finally, we find that our analysis is generally unable to\nexclude at 68% confidence an IMBH with mass of $10^3~M_\\odot$ in snapshots\nwithout a central BH. Interestingly, our results are not sensitive to GC\ndistance within 5-20 kpc, nor to mis-identification of the GC center by less\nthan 2'' (<20% of the core radius). These findings highlight the value of\nground-based integral field spectroscopy for large GC surveys, where systematic\nfailures can be accounted for, but stress the importance of discrete kinematic\nmeasurements that are less affected by stochasticity induced by bright stars.\n", "  As we approach the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era, several studies\nhave emerged that aim to: 1) characterize how the instruments will perform and\n2) determine what atmospheric spectral features could theoretically be detected\nusing transmission and emission spectroscopy. To some degree, all these studies\nhave relied on modeling of JWST's theoretical instrument noise. With under two\nyears left until launch, it is imperative that the exoplanet community begins\nto digest and integrate these studies into their observing plans, as well as\nthink about how to leverage the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to optimize JWST\nobservations. In order to encourage this and to allow all members of the\ncommunity access to JWST & HST noise simulations, we present here an\nopen-source Python package and online interface for creating observation\nsimulations of all observatory-supported time-series spectroscopy modes. This\nnoise simulator, called PandExo, relies on some aspects of Space Telescope\nScience Institute's Exposure Time Calculator, Pandeia. We describe PandExo and\nthe formalism for computing noise sources for JWST. Then, we benchmark\nPandExo's performance against each instrument team's independently written\nnoise simulator for JWST, and previous observations for HST. We find that\n\\texttt{PandExo} is within 10% agreement for HST/WFC3 and for all JWST\ninstruments.\n", "  We theoretically study the effects of strong magnetoelastic coupling on the\ntransport properties of magnetic insulators. We develop a Boltzmann transport\ntheory for the mixed magnon-phonon modes (magnon polarons) and determine\ntransport coefficients and spin diffusion length. Magnon-polaron formation\ncauses anomalous features in the magnetic field and temperature dependence of\nthe spin Seebeck effect when the disorder scattering in the magnetic and\nelastic subsystems is sufficiently different. Experimental data by Kikkawa et\nal. [PRL 117, 207203 (2016)] on yttrium iron garnet films can be explained by\nan acoustic quality that is much better than the magnetic quality of the\nmaterial. We predict similar anomalous features in the spin and heat\nconductivity and non-local spin transport experiments.\n", "  The census of star clusters in the inner Milky Way is incomplete because of\nextinction and crowding. We embarked on a program to expand the star cluster\nlist in the direction of the inner Milky Way using deep stacks of Ks-band\nimages from the VISTA Variables in Via Lactea (VVV) Survey. We applied an\nautomated two-step procedure to the point-source catalog derived from the deep\nKs images: first, we identified overdensities of stars, and then we selected\nonly candidate clusters with probable member stars that match an isochrone with\na certain age, distance, and extinction on the color-magnitude diagram. This\npilot project only investigates the cluster population in part of one VVV tile,\nthat is, b201. We identified nine cluster candidates and estimated their\nparameters. The new candidates are compact with a typical radius on the sky of\n~0.2--0.4 arcmin (~0.4-1.6 pc at their estimated distances). They are located\nat distances of ~5-14 kpc from the Sun and are subject to moderate extinction\nof E(B-V)=0.4-1.0 mag. They are sparse, probably evolved, with typical ages\nlog(t/1 yr)~9. Based on the locations of the objects inside the Milky Way, we\nconclude that one of these objects is probably associated with the disk or halo\nand the remaining objects are associated with the bulge or the halo. The\ncluster candidates reported here push the VVV Survey cluster detection to the\nlimit. These new objects demonstrate that the VVV survey has the potential to\nidentify thousands of additional cluster candidates. The sub-arcsec angular\nresolution nd the near-infrared wavelength regimen give it a critical advantage\nover other surveys.\n", "  We show that the semiclassical entropy of $D$-dimensional rotating\n(an)isotropic black holes with planar horizon can be successfully computed\naccording to a Cardy-like formula. This formula does not refer to any central\ncharges but instead involves the vacuum energy which is identified with a\ngravitational bulk soliton. The soliton is obtained from the non-rotating black\nhole solution by means of a double analytic continuation. The robustness of the\nCardy-like formula is tested with numerous and varied examples, including AdS,\nLifshitz and hyperscaling violation planar black holes.\n", "  Synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy have been used to study\nchemical reactions of molecular hydrogen (H2) with sulfur (S) at high\npressures. We find theoretically predicted Cccm and Im-3m H3S to be the\nreaction products at 50 and 140 GPa, respectively. Im-3m H3S is a stable\ncrystalline phase above 140 GPa and it transforms to R3m H3S on pressure\nrelease below 140 GPa. The latter phase is (meta)stable down to at least 70 GPa\nwhere it transforms to Cccm H3S upon annealing (T<1300 K) to overcome the\nkinetic hindrance. Cccm H3S has an extended structure with symmetric hydrogen\nbonds at 50 GPa and upon decompression it experiences a transformation to a\nmolecular mixed H2S-H2 structure below 40 GPa without any apparent change in\nthe crystal symmetry.\n", "  We theoretically study the dynamics of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in\ninhomogeneous metallic films close to the angular momentum compensation point.\nIn particular, it is shown that the line of the vanishing angular momentum can\nbe utilized as a self-focusing racetrack for skyrmions. To that end, we begin\nby deriving the equations of motion for the dynamics of collinear ferrimagnets\nin the presence of a charge current. The obtained equations of motion reduce to\nthose of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets at two special limits. In the\ncollective coordinate approach, a skyrmion behaves as a massive charged\nparticle moving in a viscous medium subjected to a magnetic field. Analogous to\nthe snake orbits of electrons in a nonuniform magnetic field, we show that a\nferrimagnet with the nonuniform angular momentum density can exhibit snake\ntrajectories of skyrmions, which can be utilized as racetracks for skyrmions.\n", "  Accurate modelling of solar-like oscillators requires that modelled mode\nfrequencies are corrected for the systematic shift caused by improper modelling\nof the near-surface layers, known as the surface effect. ... We investigate how\nmuch additional uncertainty is introduced to stellar model parameters by our\nuncertainty about the functional form of the surface effect. At the same time,\nwe test whether any of the parametrizations is significantly better or worse at\nmodelling observed subgiants and low-luminosity red giants. We model six stars\nobserved by Kepler that show clear mixed modes. We fix the input physics of the\nstellar models and vary the choice of surface correction ... Models using a\nsolar-calibrated power law correction consistently fit the observations more\npoorly than the other four corrections. Models with the remaining four\ncorrections generally fit ... about equally well, with the combined surface\ncorrection by Ball & Gizon perhaps being marginally superior. The fits broadly\nagree on the model parameters within about the $2\\sigma$ uncertainties, with\ndiscrepancies between the modified Lorentzian and free power law corrections\noccasionally exceeding the $3\\sigma$ level. Relative to the best-fitting\nvalues, the total uncertainties on the masses, radii and ages of the stars are\nall less than 2, 1 and 6 per cent, respectively. A solar-calibrated power law\n... appears unsuitable for use with more evolved solar-like oscillators. Among\nthe remaining surface corrections, the uncertainty in the model parameters\nintroduced by the surface effects is about twice as large as the uncertainty in\nthe individual fits for these six stars. Though the fits are thus somewhat less\ncertain because of our uncertainty of how to manage the surface effect, these\nresults also demonstrate that it is feasible to model the individual mode\nfrequencies of subgiants and low-luminosity red giants. ...\n", "  We present near-infrared interferometry of the carbon-rich asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) star R Sculptoris.\n  The visibility data indicate a broadly circular resolved stellar disk with a\ncomplex substructure. The observed AMBER squared visibility values show drops\nat the positions of CO and CN bands, indicating that these lines form in\nextended layers above the photosphere. The AMBER visibility values are best fit\nby a model without a wind. The PIONIER data are consistent with the same model.\nWe obtain a Rosseland angular diameter of 8.9+-0.3 mas, corresponding to a\nRosseland radius of 355+-55 Rsun, an effective temperature of 2640+-80 K, and a\nluminosity of log L/Lsun=3.74+-0.18. These parameters match evolutionary tracks\nof initial mass 1.5+-0.5 Msun and current mass 1.3+-0.7 Msun. The reconstructed\nPIONIER images exhibit a complex structure within the stellar disk including a\ndominant bright spot located at the western part of the stellar disk. The spot\nhas an H-band peak intensity of 40% to 60% above the average intensity of the\nlimb-darkening-corrected stellar disk. The contrast between the minimum and\nmaximum intensity on the stellar disk is about 1:2.5.\n  Our observations are broadly consistent with predictions by dynamic\natmosphere and wind models, although models with wind appear to have a\ncircumstellar envelope that is too extended compared to our observations. The\ndetected complex structure within the stellar disk is most likely caused by\ngiant convection cells, resulting in large-scale shock fronts, and their\neffects on clumpy molecule and dust formation seen against the photosphere at\ndistances of 2-3 stellar radii.\n", "  We consider the scalar field profile around relativistic compact objects such\nas neutron stars for a range of modified gravity models with screening\nmechanisms of the chameleon and Damour-Polyakov types. We focus primarily on\ninverse power law chameleons and the environmentally dependent dilaton as\nexamples of both mechanisms. We discuss the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequation and then implement a relaxation algorithm to solve for the scalar\nprofiles numerically. We find that chameleons and dilatons behave in a similar\nmanner and that there is a large degeneracy between the modified gravity\nparameters and the neutron star equation of state. This is exemplified by the\nmodifications to the mass-radius relationship for a variety of model\nparameters.\n", "  The solar-activity-cycle minimum observed between Cycles 23 and 24 is\ngenerally regarded as being unusually deep and long. That minimum is being\nfollowed by one of the smallest amplitude cycles in recent history. We perform\nan in-depth analysis of this minimum with helioseismology. We use Global\nOscillation Network Group (GONG) data to demonstrate that the frequencies of\nhelioseismic oscillations are a sensitive probe of the Sun's magnetic field:\nThe frequencies of the helioseismic oscillations were found to be\nsystematically lower in the minimum following Cycle 23 than in the minimum\npreceding it. This difference is statistically significant and may indicate\nthat the Sun's global magnetic field was weaker in the minimum following Cycle\n23. The size of the shift in oscillation frequencies between the two minima is\ndependent on the frequency of the oscillation and takes the same functional\nform as the frequency dependence observed when the frequencies at cycle maximum\nare compared with the cycle-minimum frequencies. This implies that the same\nnear-surface magnetic perturbation is responsible. Finally, we determine that\nthe difference in the mean magnetic field between the minimum preceding Cycle\n23 and that following it is approximately 1G.\n", "  The quest to observe gravitational waves challenges our ability to\ndiscriminate signals from detector noise. This issue is especially relevant for\ntransient gravitational waves searches with a robust eyes wide open approach,\nthe so called all- sky burst searches. Here we show how signal classification\nmethods inspired by broad astrophysical characteristics can be implemented in\nall-sky burst searches preserving their generality. In our case study, we apply\na multivariate analyses based on artificial neural networks to classify waves\nemitted in compact binary coalescences. We enhance by orders of magnitude the\nsignificance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the\nnoise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of\nnoise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We\nalso show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be\nperformed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in\ndiscriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future\nobservations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing\nrecoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of\nthe flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient\ngravitational waves.\n", "  We consider a system with spin-orbit coupling and derive equations of motion\nwhich include the effects of Berry curvatures. We apply these equations to\ninvestigate the dynamics of particles with equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit\ncoupling in one dimension. In our derivation, the adiabatic transformation is\nperformed first and leads to quantum Heisenberg equations of motion for\nmomentum and position operators. These equations explicitly contain\nposition-space, momentum-space, and phase-space Berry curvature terms.\nSubsequently, we perform the semiclassical approximation, and obtain the\nsemiclassical equations of motion. Taking the low-Berry-curvature limit results\nin equations that can be directly compared to previous results for the motion\nof wavepackets. Finally, we show that in the semiclassical regime, the\neffective mass of the equal Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled system can be\nviewed as a direct effect of the phase-space Berry curvature.\n", "  We present the results of our spectroscopic observations of eight detached\neclipsing binaries (DEBs), selected from the $Kepler$ Eclipsing Binary Catalog.\nRadial velocities (RVs) were calculated from high resolution spectra obtained\nwith the HIDES pectrograph, attached to the 1.88-m telescope of the Okayama\nAstrophysical Observatory, and were used to characterize the targets in\ncombination with the $Kepler$ light curves. For each binary we obtained a full\nset of orbital and physical parameters, reaching precision below 3% in masses\nand radii for 5 pairs. By comparing our results with theoretical models, we\nassess the distance, age and evolutionary status of the researched objects. We\nalso study eclipse timing variations of selected objects, and identify a new\nsystem with a $\\gamma$Dor pulsator. Two systems are triples, and show lines\ncoming from three components. In one case the motion of the outer star and the\nperturbation in the RVs of the inner binary are clearly visible and periodical,\nwhich allows us to directly calculate the mass of the third star, and\ninclination of the outer orbit. In the second case we only see a clear motion\nof the tertiary, and investigate two scenarios: that it is a linear trend\ncoming from the orbital motion around the inner binary, and that it is caused\nby a planetary mass companion. When possible, we also compare our results with\nthe literature, and conclude that only by combining photometry with RVs it is\npossible to obtain correct physical parameters of both components of a DEB.\n", "  We describe a 20-year survey carried out by the Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet\nSurvey Team (LCES), using precision radial velocities from HIRES on the Keck-I\ntelescope to find and characterize extrasolar planetary systems orbiting nearby\nF, G, K, and M dwarf stars. We provide here 60,949 precision radial velocities\nfor 1,624 stars contained in that survey. We tabulate a list of 357 significant\nperiodic signals that are of constant period and phase, and not coincident in\nperiod and/or phase with stellar activity indices. These signals are thus\nstrongly suggestive of barycentric reflex motion of the star induced by one or\nmore candidate exoplanets in Keplerian motion about the host star. Of these\nsignals, 225 have already been published as planet claims, 60 are classified as\nsignificant unpublished planet candidates that await photometric follow-up to\nrule out activity-related causes, and 54 are also unpublished, but are\nclassified as \"significant\" signals that require confirmation by additional\ndata before rising to classification as planet candidates. Of particular\ninterest is our detection of a candidate planet with a minimum mass of 3.9\nEarth masses and an orbital period of 9.9 days orbiting Lalande 21185, the\nfourth-closest main sequence star to the Sun. For each of our exoplanetary\ncandidate signals, we provide the period and semi-amplitude of the Keplerian\norbital fit, and a likelihood ratio estimate of its statistical significance.\nWe also tabulate 18 Keplerian-like signals that we classify as likely arising\nfrom stellar activity.\n", "  The Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) is a wide-field two-band photometric\nsurvey of the Northern Galactic Cap using the 90Prime imager on the 2.3 m Bok\ntelescope at Kitt Peak. It is a four-year collaboration between the National\nAstronomical Observatory of China and Steward Observatory, the University of\nArizona, serving as one of the three imaging surveys to provide photometric\ninput catalogs for target selection of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI) project. BASS will take up to 240 dark/grey nights to cover an area of\nabout 5400 deg$^2$ in the $g$ and $r$ bands. The 5$\\sigma$ limiting AB\nmagnitudes for point sources in the two bands, corrected for the Galactic\nextinction, are 24.0 and 23.4 mag, respectively. BASS, together with other DESI\nimaging surveys, will provide unique science opportunities that cover a wide\nrange of topics in both Galactic and extragalactic astronomy.\n", "  This paper describes the design, operations, and performance of the\nMulti-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA). Its primary goal is to find new exoplanets\ntransiting bright stars, $4 < m_V < 8$, by monitoring the full sky. MASCARA\nconsists of one northern station on La Palma, Canary Islands (fully operational\nsince February 2015), one southern station at La Silla Observatory, Chile\n(operational from early 2017), and a data centre at Leiden Observatory in the\nNetherlands. Both MASCARA stations are equipped with five interline CCD cameras\nusing wide field lenses (24 mm focal length) with fixed pointings, which\ntogether provide coverage down to airmass 3 of the local sky. The interline CCD\ncameras allow for back-to-back exposures, taken at fixed sidereal times with\nexposure times of 6.4 sidereal seconds. The exposures are short enough that the\nmotion of stars across the CCD does not exceed one pixel during an integration.\nAstrometry and photometry are performed on-site, after which the resulting\nlight curves are transferred to Leiden for further analysis. The final MASCARA\narchive will contain light curves for ${\\sim}70,000$ stars down to $m_V=8.4$,\nwith a precision of $1.5\\%$ per 5 minutes at $m_V=8$.\n", "  We investigate the phase transitions in a coupled system of Ising spins and a\nfluctuating network. Each spin interacts with $q$ neighbors through links of\nthe rewiring network. The Ising spins and the network are in thermal contact\nwith the heat baths at temperatures $T_S$ and $T_L$, respectively, so that the\nwhole system is driven out of equilibrium for $T_S \\neq T_L$. The model is a\ngeneralization of the $q$-neighbor Ising model, which corresponds to the\nlimiting case of $T_L=\\infty$. Despite the mean field nature of the\ninteraction, the $q$-neighbor Ising model was shown to display a discontinuous\nphase transition for $q\\geq 4$. Setting up the rate equations for the\nmagnetization and the energy density, we obtain the phase diagram in the\n$T_S$-$T_L$ parameter space. The phase diagram consists of a ferromagnetic\nphase and a paramagnetic phase. The two phases are separated by a continuous\nphase transition belonging to the mean field universality class or by a\ndiscontinuous phase transition with an intervening coexistence phase. The\nequilibrium system with $T_S=T_L$ falls into the former case while the\n$q$-neighbor Ising model falls into the latter case. At the tricritical point,\nthe system exhibits the mean field tricritical behavior. Our model demonstrates\na possibility that a continuous phase transition turns into a discontinuous\ntransition by a nonequilibrium driving. Heat flow induced by the temperature\ndifference between two heat baths is also studied.\n", "  We map the lensing-inferred substructure in the first three clusters observed\nby the Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields Initiative (HSTFF): Abell 2744 (z\n= 0.308), MACSJ0416, (z = 0.396) and MACSJ1149 (z = 0.543). Statistically\nresolving dark-matter subhaloes down to ~10^{9.5} solar masses, we compare the\nderived subhalo mass functions (SHMFs) to theoretical predictions from\nanalytical models and with numerical simulations in a Lambda Cold Dark Matter\n(LCDM) cosmology. Mimicking our observational cluster member selection criteria\nin the HSTFF, we report excellent agreement in both amplitude and shape of the\nSHMF over four decades in subhalo mass (10^{9-13} solar masses). Projection\neffects do not appear to introduce significant errors in the determination of\nSHMFs from simulations. We do not find evidence for a substructure crisis,\nanalogous to the missing satellite problem in the Local Group, on cluster\nscales, but rather excellent agreement of the count-matched HSTFF SHMF down to\nM_{sub halo}/M_{halo} ~ 10^{-5}. However, we do find discrepancies in the\nradial distribution of sub haloes inferred from HSTFF cluster lenses compared\nto determinations from simulated clusters. This suggests that although the\nselected simulated clusters match the HSTFF sample in mass, they do not\nadequately capture the dynamical properties and complex merging morphologies of\nthese observed cluster lenses. Therefore, HSTFF clusters are likely observed in\na transient evolutionary stage that is presently insufficiently sampled in\ncosmological simulations. The abundance and mass function of dark matter\nsubstructure in cluster lenses continues to offer an important test of the LCDM\nparadigm, and at present we find no tension between model predictions and\nobservations.\n", "  We modify the path integral representation of exciton transport in open\nquantum systems such that an exact description of the quantum fluctuations\naround the classical evolution of the system is possible. As a consequence, the\ntime evolution of the system observables is obtained by calculating the average\nof a stochastic difference equation which is weighted with a product of\npseudo-probability density functions. From the exact equation of motion one can\nclearly identify the terms that are also present if we apply the truncated\nWigner approximation. This description of the problem is used as a basis for\nthe derivation of a new approximation, whose validity goes beyond the truncated\nWigner approximation. To demonstrate this we apply the formalism to a\ndonor-acceptor transport model.\n", "  Linear carbon chains are common in various types of astronomical molecular\nsources. Possible formation mechanisms involve both bottom-up and top-down\nroutes. We have carried out a combined observational and modeling study of the\nformation of carbon chains in the C-star envelope IRC+10216, where the\npolymerization of acetylene and hydrogen cyanide induced by ultraviolet photons\ncan drive the formation of linear carbon chains of increasing length. We have\nused ALMA to map the emission of 3 mm rotational lines of the hydrocarbon\nradicals C2H, C4H, and C6H, and the CN-containing species CN, C3N, HC3N, and\nHC5N with an angular resolution of 1\". The spatial distribution of all these\nspecies is a hollow, 5-10\" wide, spherical shell located at a radius of 10-20\"\nfrom the star, with no appreciable emission close to the star. Our observations\nresolve the broad shell of carbon chains into thinner sub-shells which are 1-2\"\nwide and not fully concentric, indicating that the mass loss process has been\ndiscontinuous and not fully isotropic. The radial distributions of the species\nmapped reveal subtle differences: while the hydrocarbon radicals have very\nsimilar radial distributions, the CN-containing species show more diverse\ndistributions, with HC3N appearing earlier in the expansion and the radical CN\nextending later than the rest of the species. The observed morphology can be\nrationalized by a chemical model in which the growth of polyynes is mainly\nproduced by rapid gas-phase chemical reactions of C2H and C4H radicals with\nunsaturated hydrocarbons, while cyanopolyynes are mainly formed from polyynes\nin gas-phase reactions with CN and C3N radicals.\n", "  We present the results of the spatial and spectral analysis of the deep (~200\nksec) Chandra HETG observation of the changing look AGN NGC7582. During this\nobservation NGC7582 was in a highly obscured state. Therefore, we considered\nalso a short Suzaku observation, which caught NGC7582 in a Compton thick state.\nThis allows us to determine the underlying continuum and the amount of\nabsorption ($N_H \\sim~1.2\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$). A wealth of emission lines\nare detected in the Chandra data, which allow us to map the structure of the\ncircum-nuclear emitters. The high resolution spectrum reveals that the soft\nX-ray emission originates in a hybrid gas, which is ionized in part by the\nstarforming activity and in part by the central AGN. The high resolution images\nconfirm that the emitting region is inhomogeneous and extends up to a few\nhundred pc from the nuclear source. The X-ray images are more extended in the\nlower energy lines (Ne and Mg) than in the higher energy lines (Si, Fe), where\nthe former are dominated by the collisionally ionised gas and the latter by the\nphotoionized AGN emission. This is supported by the analysis of the He-like\ntriplets. We deduce that a low density photoionized gas is responsible for the\nstrong forbidden components, which is likely to originate from extended AGN\nNarrow Line Region gas at distances of 200-300 pc from the black hole. We also\ndetected an absorption feature at ~ 6.7 keV consistent with the rest frame\nenergy of the resonance absorption line from FeXXV, which traces the presence\nof a sub-parsec scale ionized absorber. The emerging picture is in agreement\nwith our view of the circumnuclear gas in AGN, where the medium is clumpy and\nstratified in both density and ionization. These absorbers and emitters are\nlocated on different scales: from the sub-pc Broad Line Region gas out to the\nkpc scale of the galactic absorber.\n", "  We present a simplified description for spin-dependent electronic transport\nin honeycomb-lattice structures with spin-orbit interactions, using\ngeneralizations of the stochastic non-equilibrium model known as the totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process. Mean field theory and numerical\nsimulations are used to study currents, density profiles and current\npolarization in quasi- one dimensional systems with open boundaries, and\nexternally-imposed particle injection ($\\alpha$) and ejection ($\\beta$) rates.\nWe investigate the influence of allowing for double site occupancy, according\nto Pauli's exclusion principle, on the behavior of the quantities of interest.\nWe find that double occupancy shows strong signatures for specific combinations\nof rates, namely high $\\alpha$ and low $\\beta$, but otherwise its effects are\nquantitatively suppressed. Comments are made on the possible relevance of the\npresent results to experiments on suitably doped graphenelike structures.\n", "  The CIII] and CIV rest-frame UV emission lines are powerful probes of the\nionizations states of galaxies. They have furthermore been suggested as\nalternatives for spectroscopic redshift confirmation of objects at the epoch of\nreionization ($z>6$), where the most frequently used redshift indicator,\nLy$\\alpha$, is attenuated by the high fraction of neutral hydrogen in the\ninter-galactic medium. However, currently only very few confirmations of carbon\nUV lines at these high redshifts exist, making it challenging to quantify these\nclaims. Here, we present the detection of CIV$\\lambda\\lambda$1548,1551\\AA\\ in\n\\HST\\ slitless grism spectroscopy obtained by GLASS of a Ly$\\alpha$ emitter at\n$z=6.11$ multiply imaged by the massive foreground galaxy cluster RXJ2248. The\nCIV emission is detected at the 3--5$\\sigma$ level in two images of the source,\nwith marginal detection in two other images. We do not detect significant\nCIII]$\\lambda\\lambda$1907,1909\\AA\\ emission implying an equivalent width\nEW$_\\textrm{CIII]}<20$\\AA\\ (1$\\sigma$) and $\\textrm{CIV/CIII}>0.7$ (2$\\sigma$).\nCombined with limits on the rest-frame UV flux from the HeII$\\lambda$1640\\AA\\\nemission line and the OIII]$\\lambda\\lambda$1661,1666\\AA\\ doublet, we put\nconstraints on the metallicity and the ionization state of the galaxy. The\nestimated line ratios and equivalent widths do not support a scenario where an\nAGN is responsible for ionizing the carbon atoms. SED fits including nebular\nemission lines imply a source with a mass of log(M/M$_\\odot)\\sim9$, SFR of\naround 10M$_\\odot$/yr, and a young stellar population $<50$Myr old. The source\nshows a stronger ionizing radiation field than objects with detected CIV\nemission at $z<2$ and adds to the growing sample of low-mass\n(log(M/M$_\\odot)\\lesssim9$) galaxies at the epoch of reionization with strong\nradiation fields from star formation.\n", "  Observations of nine transits of WASP-107 during the {\\it K2} mission reveal\nthree separate occasions when the planet crossed in front of a starspot. The\ndata confirm the stellar rotation period to be 17 days --- approximately three\ntimes the planet's orbital period --- and suggest that large spots persist for\nat least one full rotation. If the star had a low obliquity, at least two\nadditional spot crossings should have been observed. They were not observed,\ngiving evidence for a high obliquity. We use a simple geometric model to show\nthat the obliquity is likely in the range 40-140$^\\circ$, i.e., both spin-orbit\nalignment and anti-alignment can be ruled out. WASP-107 thereby joins the small\ncollection of relatively low-mass stars hosting a giant planet with a high\nobliquity. Most such stars have been observed to have low obliquities; all the\nexceptions, including WASP-107, involve planets with relatively wide orbits\n(\"warm Jupiters\", with $a_{\\rm min}/R_\\star \\gtrsim 8$). This demonstrates a\nconnection between stellar obliquity and planet properties, in contradiction to\nsome theories for obliquity excitation.\n", "  Infra-Red(IR) astronomical databases, namely, IRAS, 2MASS, WISE, and Spitzer,\nare used to analyze photometric data of 126 carbon stars whose spectra are\nvisible in the First Byurakan Survey low-resolution spectral plates. Among\nthese, six new objects, recently confirmed on the digitized FBS plates, are\nincluded. For three of them, moderate-resolution CCD optical spectra are also\npresented. In this work several IR color-color diagrams are studied. Early and\nlate-type C stars are separated in the JHK Near-Infra-Red(NIR) color-color\nplots, as well as in the WISE W3-W4 versus W1-W2 diagram. Late N-type\nAsymptotic Giant Branch stars are redder in W1-W2, while early-types(CH and R\ngiants) are redder in W3-W4 as expected. Objects with W2-W3 > 1.0 mag. show\ndouble-peaked spectral energy distribution, indicating the existence of the\ncircumstellar envelopes around them. 26 N-type stars have IRAS Point Source\nCatalog(PSC) associations. For FBS 1812+455 IRAS Low-Resolution Spectra in the\nwavelength range 7.7 - 22.6micron and Spitzer Space Telescope Spectra in the\nrange 5 - 38micro are presented clearly showing absorption features of\nC2H2(acetylene) molecule at 7.5 and 13.7micron , and the SiC(silicone carbide)\nemission at 11.3micron. The mass-loss rates for eight Mira-type variables are\nderived from the K-[12] color and from the pulsation periods. The reddest\nobject among the targets is N-type C star FBS 2213+421, which belong to the\ngroup of the cold post-AGB R Coronae Borealis(R CrB) variables.\n", "  We present a new formulation for the canonical approach to conformal\n(Weyl-squared) gravity and its extension by the Einstein-Hilbert term and a\nnonminimally coupled scalar field. For this purpose we use a unimodular\ndecomposition of the three-metric and introduce unimodular-conformal canonical\nvariables. The important feature of this choice is that only the scale part of\nthe three-metric and the rescaled trace part of the extrinsic curvature change\nunder a conformal transformation. This significantly simplifies the constraint\nanalysis and manifestly reveals the conformal properties of a theory that\ncontains the conformally invariant Weyl-tensor term. The conformal symmetry\nbreaking which occurs in the presence of the Einstein-Hilbert term and a\nnonconformally coupled scalar field can then be interpreted directly in terms\nof this scale and this trace. We also discuss in detail the generator for the\nconformal transformations. This new Hamiltonian formulation is especially\nsuitable for quantization, which will be the subject of a separate paper.\n", "  High-metallicity pollution is common in white dwarf (WD) stars hosting\nremnant planetary systems. However, they rarely have detectable debris\naccretion discs, possibly because much of the influx is fast steeply-infalling\ndebris in star-grazing orbits, producing a more tenuous signature than a slowly\naccreting disk. Processes governing such deposition between the Roche radius\nand photosphere have so far received little attention and we model them here\nanalytically by extending recent work on sun-grazing comets to WD systems. We\nfind that the evolution of cm-to-km size (a_0) infallers most strongly depends\non two combinations of parameters, which effectively measure sublimation rate\nand binding strength. We then provide an algorithm to determine the fate of\ninfallers for any WD, and apply the algorithm to four limiting combinations of\nhot versus cool (young/old) WDs with snowy (weak, volatile) versus rocky\n(strong, refractory) infallers. We find: (i) Total sublimation above the\nphotosphere befalls all small infallers across the entire WD temperature (T_WD)\nrange, the threshold size rising with T_WD and 100X larger for rock than snow.\n(ii) All very large objects fragment tidally regardless of T_WD: for rock, a_0\n>= 10^5 cm; for snow, a_0 >= 10^3 -- 3x10^4 cm across all WD cooling ages.\n(iii) A considerable range of a_0 avoids fragmentation and total sublimation,\nyielding impacts or grazes with cold WDs. This range narrows rapidly with\nincreasing T_WD, especially for snowy bodies. Finally, we discuss briefly how\nthe various forms of deposited debris may finally reach the photosphere surface\nitself.\n", "  Context: Observations of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with increasing\nspatial resolution reveal new layers of complexity of atmospheric processes on\na variety of scales. Aim: To analyze the physical mechanisms that cause\nasymmetries and surface structures in observed images, we use detailed 3D\ndynamical simulations of AGB stars; these simulations self-consistently\ndescribe convection and pulsations. Methods: We used the CO5BOLD\nradiation-hydrodynamics code to produce an exploratory grid of global\n\"star-in-a-box\" models of the outer convective envelope and the inner\natmosphere of AGB stars to study convection, pulsations, and shock waves and\ntheir dependence on stellar and numerical parameters. Results: The model\ndynamics are governed by the interaction of long-lasting giant convection\ncells, short-lived surface granules, and strong, radial, fundamental-mode\npulsations. Radial pulsations and shorter wavelength, traveling, acoustic waves\ninduce shocks on various scales in the atmosphere. Convection, waves, and\nshocks all contribute to the dynamical pressure and, thus, to an increase of\nthe stellar radius and to a levitation of material into layers where dust can\nform. Consequently, the resulting relation of pulsation period and stellar\nradius is shifted toward larger radii compared to that of non-linear 1D models.\nThe dependence of pulsation period on luminosity agrees well with observed\nrelations. The interaction of the pulsation mode with the non-stationary\nconvective flow causes occasional amplitude changes and phase shifts. The\nregularity of the pulsations decreases with decreasing gravity as the relative\nsize of convection cells increases. The model stars do not have a well-defined\nsurface. Instead, the light is emitted from a very extended inhomogeneous\natmosphere with a complex dynamic pattern of high-contrast features.\n", "  We have been spectroscopically monitoring 88 quasars selected to have broad\nH$\\beta$ emission lines offset from their systemic redshift by thousands of km\ns$^{-1}$. By analogy with single-lined spectroscopic binary stars, we consider\nthese quasars to be candidates for hosting supermassive black hole binaries\n(SBHBs). In this work we present new radial velocity measurements, typically\n3-4 per object over a time period of up to 12 years in the observer's frame. In\n29/88 of the SBHB candidates no variability of the shape of the broad H$\\beta$\nprofile is observed, which allows us to make reliable measurements of radial\nvelocity changes. Among these, we identify three objects that have displayed\nsystematic and monotonic velocity changes by several hundred km s$^{-1}$ and\nare prime targets for further monitoring. Because the periods of the\nhypothetical binaries are expected to be long, we cannot hope to observe many\norbital cycles during our lifetimes. Instead, we seek to evaluate the\ncredentials of the SBHB candidates by attempting to rule out the SBHB\nhypothesis. In this spirit, we present a method for placing a lower limit on\nthe period, and thus the mass, of the SBHBs under the assumption that the\nvelocity changes we observe are due to orbital motion. Given the duration of\nour monitoring campaign and the uncertainties in the radial velocities, we were\nable to place a lower limit on the total mass in the range\n$4.7\\times10^4-3.8\\times10^8$ $M_{\\scriptscriptstyle \\odot}$, which does not\nyet allow us to rule out the SBHB hypothesis for any candidates.\n", "  The heavyweight stellar initial mass function (IMF) observed in the cores of\nmassive early-type galaxies (ETGs) has been linked to formation of their cores\nin an initial swiftly-quenched rapid starburst. However, the outskirts of ETGs\nare thought to be assembled via the slow accumulation of smaller systems in\nwhich the star formation is less extreme; this suggests the form of the IMF\nshould exhibit a radial trend in ETGs. Here we report radial stellar population\ngradients out to the half-light radii of a sample of eight nearby ETGs.\nSpatially resolved spectroscopy at 0.8-1.35{\\mu}m from the VLT's KMOS\ninstrument was used to measure radial trends in the strengths of a variety of\nIMF-sensitive absorption features (including some which are previously\nunexplored). We find weak or no radial variation in some of these which, given\na radial IMF trend, ought to vary measurably, e.g. for the Wing-Ford band we\nmeasure a gradient of +0.06$\\pm$0.04 per decade in radius.\n  Using stellar population models to fit stacked and individual spectra, we\ninfer that the measured radial changes in absorption feature strengths are\nprimarily accounted for by abundance gradients which are fairly consistent\nacross our sample (e.g. we derive an average [Na/H] gradient of\n-0.53$\\pm$0.07). The inferred contribution of dwarf stars to the total light\ntypically corresponds to a bottom heavy IMF, but we find no evidence for radial\nIMF variations in the majority of our sample galaxies.\n", "  Supernova 2011kl, associated with the ultra-long gamma-ray burst (ULGRB)\n111209A, exhibited a higher-than-normal peak luminosity, placing it in the\nparameter space between regular supernovae and super-luminous supernovae. Its\nlight curve can only be matched by an abnormally high fraction of $^{56}$Ni\nthat appears inconsistent with the observed spectrum, and as a result it has\nbeen suggested that the supernova, and by extension the gamma-ray burst, are\npowered by the spin-down of a highly magnetised millisecond pulsar, known as a\nmagnetar. We investigate the broadband observations of ULGRB 111209A, and find\ntwo independent measures that suggest a high density circumburst environment.\nHowever, the light curve of the GRB afterglow shows no evidence of a jet break\n(the steep decline that would be expected as the jet slows due to the\nresistance of the external medium) out to three weeks after trigger, implying a\nwide jet. Combined with the high isotropic energy of the burst, this implies\nthat only a magnetar with a spin period of ~ 1 ms or faster can provide enough\nenergy to power both ULGRB 111209A and Supernova 2011kl.\n", "  In our previous articles (Chertok et al.: 2013, Solar Phys. 282, 175, and\n2015, Solar Phys. 290, 627), we presented a preliminary tool for the early\ndiagnostics of the geoeffectiveness of solar eruptions based on the estimate of\nthe total unsigned line-of-sight photospheric magnetic flux in accompanying\nextreme-ultraviolet arcades and dimmings. This tool was based on the analysis\nof eruptions observed in 1996-2005 with SOHO/EIT and MDI. Empirical\nrelationships were obtained to estimate the probable importance of upcoming\nspace weather disturbances caused by an eruption, which just occurred, without\ndata on the associated coronal mass ejections. It was possible to estimate the\nintensity of a non-recurrent geomagnetic storm (GMS) and Forbush decrease (FD),\nas well as their onset and peak times. After 2010-2011, data on solar eruptions\nare obtained with SDO/AIA and HMI. We use relatively short intervals of\noverlapping EIT-AIA and MDI-HMI detailed observations and a number of large\neruptions over the next five years with the 12-hour cadence EIT images to adapt\nthe SOHO diagnostic tool to SDO data. The adopted brightness thresholds select\nfrom the EIT 195 \\AA\\ and AIA 193 \\AA\\ image practically the same areas of\narcades and dimmings with a cross-calibration factor of 3.6-5.8 (5.0-8.2) for\nthe AIA exposure time of 2.0 s (2.9 s). For the same photospheric areas, the\nMDI magnetic flux systematically exceeds the HMI flux by a factor of 1.4. Based\non these results, the empirical diagnostic relationships obtained from SOHO\ndata are adjusted to SDO instruments. Examples of a post-diagnostics based on\nSDO data are presented. As before, the tool is applicable to non-recurrent GMSs\nand FDs caused by nearly central eruptions from active regions, provided that\nthe southern component of the interplanetary magnetic field near the Earth is\npredominantly negative, which is not predicted by this tool.\n", "  The polarization of direct photons produced in an ultrarelativistic heavy-ion\ncollision reflects the momentum anisotropy of the quark-gluon plasma created in\nthe collision. This paper presents a general framework, based on the photon\nspectral functions in the plasma, for analyzing the angular distribution and\nthus the polarization of dileptons in terms of the plasma momentum\nanisotropies. The rates of dilepton production depend, in general, on four\nindependent spectral functions, corresponding to two transverse polarizations,\none longitudinal polarization, and -- in plasmas in which the momentum\nanisotropy is not invariant under parity in the local rest frame of the matter\n-- a new spectral function, $\\rho_n$, related to the anisotropy direction in\nthe collision. The momentum anisotropy appears in the difference of the two\ntransverse spectral functions, as well as in $\\rho_n$. As an illustration, we\ndelineate the spectral functions for dilepton pairs produced in the lowest\norder Drell-Yan process of quark-antiquark annihilation to a virtual photon.\n", "  Defect-free SrTiO3 (STO) is a band insulator but Angle Resolved Photoemission\nSpectroscopy (ARPES) experiments have demonstrated the existence of a nanometer\nthin two-dimensional electron liquid (2DEG) at the (001) oriented surface of\nthis compound. The bulk is a trivial insulator, but our theoretical study\nreveals that the parity of electronic wavefunctions in this 2DEG is inverted in\nthe vicinity of special points in reciprocal space where the low-energy\ndispersion consists of four gapped Dirac cones with a tilted and anisotropic\nshape. This gives rise to linearly dispersing topological edge states at the\none-dimensional boundary. We propose to probe these modes by measuring the\nJosephson radiation from gapless bound Andreev states in STO based junctions,\nas it is predicted that they display distinctive signatures of topology.\n", "  We present the analysis of the onset of the new 2010s' OH flaring event\ndetected in the OH ground-state main line at 1665~MHz towards o Ceti and\ncompare its characteristics with those of the 1990s' flaring event. This is\nbased on a series of complementary single-dish and interferometric observations\nboth in OH and H2O obtained with the Nancay Radio telescope (NRT), the Medicina\nand Effelsberg Telescopes, the European VLBI Network (EVN), and\n(e)Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network ((e)MERLIN). We compare\nthe overall characteristics of o Ceti's flaring events with those which have\nbeen observed towards other thin-shell Miras, and explore the implication of\nthese events with respect to the standard OH circumstellar-envelope model. The\nrole of binarity in the specific characteristics of o Ceti's flaring events is\nalso investigated. The flaring regions are found to be less than ~400$ +/- 40\nmas (i.e., ~40 +/- 4$ AU) either side of o Ceti, with seemingly no preferential\nlocation with respect to the direction to the companion Mira B. Contrary to the\nusual expectation that the OH maser zone is located outside the H2O maser zone,\nthe coincidence of the H2O and OH maser velocities suggests that both emissions\narise at similar distances from the star. The OH flaring characteristics of\nMira are similar to those observed in various Mira variables before, supporting\nthe earlier results that the regions where the transient OH maser emission\noccurs are different from the standard OH maser zone.\n", "  Based on the difference between the orientation of the interstellar $B_{ISM}$\nand the solar magnetic fields, there was an expectation that the magnetic field\ndirection would rotate dramatically across the heliopause (HP). However, the\nVoyager 1 spacecraft measured very little rotation across the HP. Previously we\nshowed that the $B_{ISM}$ twists as it approaches the HP and acquires a strong\nT component (East-West). Here we establish that reconnection in the eastern\nflank of the heliosphere is responsible for the twist. On the eastern flank the\nsolar magnetic field has twisted into the positive N direction and reconnects\nwith the Southward pointing component of the $B_{ISM}$. Reconnection drives a\nrotational discontinuity (RD) that twists the $B_{ISM}$ into the -T direction\nand propagates upstream in the interstellar medium towards the nose. The\nconsequence is that the N component of $B_{ISM}$ is reduced in a finite width\nband upstream of the HP. Voyager 1 currently measures angles\n($\\delta=sin^{-1}(B_{N}/B)$) close to solar values. We present MHD simulations\nto support this scenario, suppressing reconnection in the nose region while\nallowing it in the flanks, consistent with recent ideas about reconnection\nsuppression from diamagnetic drifts. The jump in plasma $\\beta$ (the plasma to\nmagnetic pressure) across the nose of HP is much greater than in the flanks\nbecause the heliosheath $\\beta$ is greater there than in the flanks.\nLarge-scale reconnection is therefore suppressed in the nose but not at the\nflanks. Simulation data suggest that $B_{ISM}$ will return to its pristine\nvalue $10-15~AU$ past the HP.\n", "  The propagation of cosmic rays in turbulent magnetic fields is a diffusive\nprocess driven by the scattering of the charged particles by random magnetic\nfluctuations. Such fields are usually highly intermittent, consisting of\nintense magnetic filaments and ribbons surrounded by weaker, unstructured\nfluctuations. Studies of cosmic ray propagation have largely overlooked\nintermittency, instead relying on Gaussian random magnetic fields. Using test\nparticle simulations, we investigate cosmic ray diffusivity in intermittent,\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields. The results are compared with those obtained\nfrom non-intermittent magnetic fields having identical power spectra. The\npresence of magnetic intermittency significantly enhances cosmic ray diffusion\nover a wide range of particle energies. We demonstrate that the results can be\ninterpreted in terms of a correlated random walk.\n", "  We present new radial velocity measurements for three low-metallicity\nsolar-like stars observed with the SOPHIE spectrograph and its predecessor\nELODIE, both installed at the 193 cm telescope of the Haute-Provence\nObservatory, allowing the detection and characterization of three new giant\nextrasolar planets in intermediate periods of 1.7 to 3.7 years. All three\nstars, HD17674, HD42012 and HD29021 present single giant planetary companions\nwith minimum masses between 0.9 and 2.5 MJup. The range of periods and masses\nof these companions, along with the distance of their host stars, make them\ngood targets to look for astrometric signals over the lifetime of the new\nastrometry satellite Gaia. We discuss the preliminary astrometric solutions\nobtained from the first Gaia data release.\n", "  We characterized the population of galaxy clusters detected with the SZ\neffect with Planck, by measuring the cool core state of the objects in a\nwell-defined subsample of the Planck catalogue. We used as indicator the\nconcentration parameter Santos et al. (2008). The fraction of cool core\nclusters is $29 \\pm 4 \\%$ and does not show significant indications of\nevolution in the redshift range covered by our sample. We compare the\ndistribution of the concentration parameter in the Planck sample with the one\nof the X-ray selected sample MACS (Mann & Ebeling, 2011): the distributions are\nsignificantly different and the cool core fraction in MACS is much higher ($59\n\\pm 5 \\%$). Since X-ray selected samples are known to be biased towards cool\ncores due to the presence of their prominent surface brightness peak, we\nsimulated the impact of the \"cool core bias\" following Eckert et al. (2011). We\nfound that it plays a large role in the difference between the fractions of\ncool cores in the two samples. We examined other selection effects that could\nin principle bias SZ-surveys against cool cores but we found that their impact\nis not sufficient to explain the difference between Planck and MACS. The\npopulation of X-ray under-luminous objects, which are found in SZ-surveys but\nmissing in X-ray samples (Planck Collaboration 2016), could possibly contribute\nto the difference, as we found most of them to be non cool cores, but this\nhypothesis deserves further investigation.\n", "  (Abridged) Our sensitive ($\\sigma_{\\rm n} = 572\\,{\\rm nJy\\,beam}^{-1}$),\nhigh-resolution (FWHM $\\theta_{1/2} = 220\\,{\\rm mas}\n\\approx2\\mathrm{\\,kpc~at~}z\\gtrsim1$) 10$\\,$GHz image covering a single Karl\nG.~Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) primary beam (FWHM $\\Theta_{1/2} = 4.25'$) in\nthe GOODS-N field contains 32 sources with $S_{\\rm p}\\gtrsim2\\,\\mu{\\rm\nJy~beam}^{-1}$ and optical and/or near-infrared (OIR) counterparts.

By applying a\nlocalized perturbation to the central or the peripheral elements, we\ndemonstrate the subsequent spreading, pinning, or retraction of the\nactivations; such analysis enables the characterization of the formation of\nstationary patterns of localized activity. The results are interpreted with a\ntheoretical analysis of a simplified bistable reaction-diffusion model. Weak\ncoupling results in trivial pinned states where the activation cannot\npropagate. At strong coupling, uniform state is expected with active or\ninactive elements at small or large degree networks respectively. Nontrivial\nstationary spatial pattern, corresponding to an activation pinning, is\npredicted to occur at intermediate number of peripheral elements and at\nintermediate coupling strengths, where the central activation of the network is\npinned, but the peripheral activation propagates toward the center. The results\nare confirmed in experiments with star networks of bistable electrochemical\nreactions. The experiments confirm the existence of the stationary spatial\npatterns and the dependence of coupling strength on the number of peripheral\nelements for transitions between pinned and retreating or spreading fronts in\nforced network configurations (where the central or periphery elements are\nforced to maintain their states).\n", "  The Talbot effect in quantum physics is known to produce intricate patterns\nin the probability distribution of a particle, known as \"quantum carpets\",\ncorresponding to the revival and replication of the initial wave function.\nRecently, it was shown that one can encode a $D$-level qudit, in such a way\nthat the Talbot effect can be used to process the $D$-dimensional quantum\ninformation [Far\\'{\\i}as et al, PRA (2015)]. Here we introduce a scheme to\nproduce free-propagating \"entangled quantum carpets\" with pairs of photons\nproduced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion. First we introduce an\noptical device that can be used to synthesize arbitrary superposition states of\nTalbot qudits. Sending spatially entangled photon pairs through a pair of these\ndevices produces an entangled pair of qudits. As an application, we show how\nthe Talbot effect can be used to test a $D$-dimensional Bell inequality.\nNumerical simulations show that violation of the Bell inequality depends\nstrongly on the amount of spatial correlation in the initial two-photon state.\nWe briefly discuss how our optical scheme might be adapted to matter wave\nexperiments.\n", "  In this paper we treat the pre-ionisation problem in shocks over the velocity\nrange $10 < v_{\\rm s} < 1500$\\,km/s in a self-consistent manner. We identify\nfour distinct classes of solution controlled by the value of the shock\nprecursor parameter, $\\Psi = {\\cal Q}/v_s$, where ${\\cal Q}$ is the ionization\nparameter of the UV photons escaping upstream. This parameter determines both\nthe temperature and the degree of ionisation of the gas entering the shock. In\nincreasing velocity the shock solution regimes are cold neutral precursors\n($v_s \\lesssim 40$\\,km/s), warm neutral precursors ($40 \\lesssim v_s \\lesssim\n75$\\,km/s), warm partly-ionized precursors ($75 \\lesssim v_s \\lesssim\n120$\\,km/s), and fast shocks in which the pre-shock gas is in photoionisation\nequilibrium, and is fully ionized. The main effect of a magnetic field is to\npush these velocity ranges to higher values, and to limit the post-shock\ncompression. In order to facilitate comparison with observations of shocks, we\nprovide a number of convenient scaling relationships for parameters such as\npost-shock temperature, compression factors, cooling lengths, and H$\\beta$ and\nX-ray luminosity.\n", "  We present both exact and numerical results for the behavior of the Casimir\nforce in $O(n)$ systems with a finite extension in one direction when the\nsystem is subjected to surface fields that induce helicity in the order\nparameter. We show that for such systems the Casimir force in certain\ntemperature ranges is of the order of $L^{-2}$, both above and below the\ncritical temperature, $T_c$, of the bulk system. An example of such a system\nwould be one with chemically modulated bounding surfaces, in which the\nmodulation couples directly to the system's order parameter. We demonstrate\nthat, depending on the parameters of the system, the Casimir force can be\neither attractive or repulsive. The exact calculations presented are for the\none dimensional $XY$ and Heisenberg models under twisted boundary conditions\nresulting from finite surface fields that differ in direction by a specified\nangle and the three dimensional Gaussian model with surface fields in the form\nof plane waves that are shifted in phase with respect to each other.\nAdditionally, we present exact and numerical results for the mean field version\nof the three dimensional $O(2)$ model with finite surface fields on the\nbounding surfaces. We find that all significant results are consistent with the\nexpectations of finite size scaling.\n", "  The work of Adamo et al. (2015) showed that the mass distributions of young\nmassive stellar clusters were truncated above a maximum-mass scale in the\nnearby galaxy M83 and that this truncation mass varies with galactocentric\nradius. Here, we present a cloud-based analysis of ALMA CO($1\\to 0$)\nobservations of M83 to search for such a truncation mass in the molecular cloud\npopulation. We identify a population of 873 molecular clouds in M83 that is\nlargely similar to those found in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies,\nthough clouds in the centre of the galaxy show high surface densities and\nenhanced turbulence, as is common for clouds in high-density nuclear\nenvironments. Like the young massive clusters, we find a maximum-mass scale for\nthe molecular clouds that decreases radially in the galaxy. We find the most\nmassive young massive cluster tracks the most massive molecular cloud with the\ncluster mass being $10^{-2}$ times that of the most massive molecular cloud.\nOutside the nuclear region of M83 ($R_{g}>0.5$ kpc), there is no evidence for\nchanging internal conditions in the population of molecular clouds, with the\naverage internal pressures, densities, and free-fall times remaining constant\nfor the cloud population over the galaxy. This result is consistent with the\nbound cluster formation efficiency depending only on the large-scale properties\nof the ISM, rather than the internal conditions of individual clouds.\n", "  Flares from tidal disruption events are unique tracers of quiescent black\nholes at the centre of galaxies. The appearance of these flares is very\nsensitive to whether the star is totally or partially disrupted, and in this\npaper we seek to identify the critical distance of the star from the black hole\n(r_d) that enables us to distinguish between these two outcomes. We perform\nhere Mesh-free Finite Mass, traditional, and modern Smoothed Particle\nHydrodynamical simulations of star-black hole close encounters, with the aim of\nchecking if the value of r_d depends on the simulation technique. We find that\nthe critical distance (or the so-called critical disruption parameter beta_d)\ndepends only weakly on the adopted simulation method, being beta_d=0.92\\pm 0.02\nfor a gamma=5/3 polytrope and beta_d=2.01\\pm 0.01 for a gamma=4/3 polytrope.\n", "  The common envelope binary interaction occurs when a star transfers mass onto\na companion that cannot fully accrete it. The interaction can lead to a merger\nof the two objects or to a close binary. The common envelope interaction is the\ngateway of all evolved compact binaries, all stellar mergers and likely many of\nthe stellar transients witnessed to date. Common envelope simulations are\nneeded to understand this interaction and to interpret stars and binaries\nthought to be the byproduct of this stage. At this time, simulations are unable\nto reproduce the few observational data available and several ideas have been\nput forward to address their shortcomings. The need for more definitive\nsimulation validation is pressing, and is already being fulfilled by\nobservations from time-domain surveys. In this article, we present an initial\nmethod and its implementation for post-processing grid-based common envelope\nsimulations to produce the light-curve so as to compare simulations with\nupcoming observations. Here we implemented a zeroth order method to calculate\nthe light emitted from common envelope hydrodynamic simulations carried out\nwith the 3D hydrodynamic code Enzo used in uni-grid mode. The code implements\nan approach for the computation of luminosity in both optically thick and\noptically thin regimes and is tested using the first 135 days of the common\nenvelope simulation of Passy et al. (2012), where a 0.8 solar masses red giant\nbranch star interacts with a 0.6 solar masses companion. This code is used to\nhighlight two large obstacles that need to be overcome before realistic light\ncurves can be calculated. We explain the nature of these problems and the\nattempted solutions and approximations in full detail to enable the next step\nto be identified and implemented. We also discuss our simulation in relation to\nrecent data of transients identified as common envelope interactions.\n", "  This work extends the still modest number of multiple stars with known\nrelative orbit orientation. Accurate astrometry and radial velocities are used\njointly to compute or update outer and inner orbits in three nearby triple\nsystems HIP 101955 (orbital periods 38.68 and 2.51 years), HIP 103987 (19.20\nand 1.035 years), HIP 111805 (30.13 and 1.50 years) and in one quadruple system\nHIP 2643 (periods 70.3, 4.85 and 0.276 years), all composed of solar-type\nstars. The masses are estimated from the absolute magnitudes and checked using\nthe orbits. The ratios of outer to inner periods (from 14 to 20) and the\neccentricities of the outer orbits are moderate. These systems are dynamically\nstable, but not very far from the stability limit. In three systems all orbits\nare approximately coplanar and have small eccentricity, while in HIP 101955 the\ninner orbit with e=0.6 is highly inclined.\n", "  Using observations made with MOSFIRE on Keck I as part of the ZFIRE survey,\nwe present the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation at 2.0 < z < 2.5. The sample\nwas drawn from a stellar mass limited, Ks-band selected catalog from ZFOURGE\nover the CANDELS area in the COSMOS field. We model the shear of the Halpha\nemission line to derive rotational velocities at 2.2X the scale radius of an\nexponential disk (V2.2). We correct for the blurring effect of a\ntwo-dimensional PSF and the fact that the MOSFIRE PSF is better approximated by\na Moffat than a Gaussian, which is more typically assumed for natural seeing.\nWe find for the Tully-Fisher relation at 2.0 < z < 2.5 that logV2.2 =(2.18 +/-\n0.051)+(0.193 +/- 0.108)(logM/Msun - 10) and infer an evolution of the\nzeropoint of Delta M/Msun = -0.25 +/- 0.16 dex or Delta M/Msun = -0.39 +/- 0.21\ndex compared to z = 0 when adopting a fixed slope of 0.29 or 1/4.5,\nrespectively. We also derive the alternative kinematic estimator S0.5, with a\nbest-fit relation logS0.5 =(2.06 +/- 0.032)+(0.211 +/- 0.086)(logM/Msun - 10),\nand infer an evolution of Delta M/Msun= -0.45 +/- 0.13 dex compared to z < 1.2\nif we adopt a fixed slope. We investigate and review various systematics,\nranging from PSF effects, projection effects, systematics related to stellar\nmass derivation, selection biases and slope. We find that discrepancies between\nthe various literature values are reduced when taking these into account. Our\nobservations correspond well with the gradual evolution predicted by\nsemi-analytic models.\n", "  In this work we address the reconstruction problem, investigating the\nconstruction of field theories from supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The\nprocedure is reviewed, starting from reflectionless potentials that admit one\nand two bound states. We show that, although the field theory reconstructed\nfrom the potential that support a single bound state is unique, it may break\nunicity in the case of two bound states. We illustrate this with an example,\nwhich leads us with two distinct field theories.\n", "  We study the effective action for the massive vector field theory\nnon-minimally coupled to external gravitational field. Such a theory is an\ninteresting model both from the theoretical side and also due to the various\nphenomenological applications to cosmology and astrophysics. The present work\npretends to initiate a systematic study of its properties at the quantum level,\nby exploring free massive vector coupled to an external symmetric second-rank\ntensor. Stueckelberg scalar field is used to restore the gauge invariance.\nAfter that, by using a special gauge fixing and non-local in external fields\nchange of variables, we diagonalize the bilinear form of the action and develop\na consistent procedure to study the effective action. As a result we derive a\ncomplete non-linear structure of divergences of the effective action and\ndiscuss its properties.\n", "  We briefly review the recent results of constraining neutrino mass in\ndynamical dark energy models using cosmological observations and summarize the\nfindings. (i) In dynamical dark energy models, compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, the\nupper limit of $\\sum m_\\nu$ can become larger and can also become smaller. In\nthe cases of phantom and early phantom (i.e., the quintom evolving from $w<-1$\nto $w>-1$), the constraint on $\\sum m_\\nu$ becomes looser; but in the cases of\nquintessence and early quintessence (i.e., the quintom evolving from $w>-1$ to\n$w<-1$), the constraint on $\\sum m_\\nu$ becomes tighter. (ii) In the\nholographic dark energy (HDE) model, the tightest constraint on $\\sum m_\\nu$,\ni.e., $\\sum m_\\nu<0.105$ eV, is obtained, which is almost equal to the lower\nlimit of $\\sum m_\\nu$ of IH case. Thus, it is of great interest to find that\nthe future neutrino oscillation experiments would potentially offer a possible\nfalsifying scheme for the HDE model. (iii) The mass splitting of neutrinos can\ninfluence the cosmological fits. We find that the NH case fits the current\nobservations slightly better than the IH case, although the difference of\n$\\chi^2$ of the two cases is still not significant enough to definitely\ndistinguish the neutrino mass hierarchy.\n", "  We describe the selection of galaxies targeted in eight low redshift clusters\n(APMCC0917, A168, A4038, EDCC442, A3880, A2399, A119 and A85; $0.029 < z <\n0.058$) as part of the Sydney-AAO Multi-Object integral field Spectrograph\nGalaxy Survey (SAMI-GS). We have conducted a redshift survey of these clusters\nusing the AAOmega multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9m Anglo-Australian\nTelescope. The redshift survey is used to determine cluster membership and to\ncharacterise the dynamical properties of the clusters. In combination with\nexisting data, the survey resulted in 21,257 reliable redshift measurements and\n2899 confirmed cluster member galaxies. Our redshift catalogue has a high\nspectroscopic completeness ($\\sim 94\\%$) for $r_{\\rm petro} \\leq 19.4$ and\nclustercentric distances $R< 2\\rm{R}_{200}$. We use the confirmed cluster\nmember positions and redshifts to determine cluster velocity dispersion,\n$\\rm{R}_{200}$, virial and caustic masses, as well as cluster structure. The\nclusters have virial masses $14.25 \\leq {\\rm log }({\\rm\nM}_{200}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot}) \\leq 15.19$. The cluster sample exhibits a range of\ndynamical states, from relatively relaxed-appearing systems, to clusters with\nstrong indications of merger-related substructure. Aperture- and PSF-matched\nphotometry are derived from SDSS and VST/ATLAS imaging and used to estimate\nstellar masses. These estimates, in combination with the redshifts, are used to\ndefine the input target catalogue for the cluster portion of the SAMI-GS. The\nprimary SAMI-GS cluster targets have $R< \\rm{R}_{200}$, velocities $|v_{\\rm\npec}| < 3.5\\sigma_{200}$ and stellar masses $9.5 \\leq {\\rm\nlog(M}^*_{approx}/\\rm{M}_{\\odot}) \\leq 12$. Finally, we give an update on the\nSAMI-GS progress for the cluster regions.\n", "  We use information entropy to test the isotropy in the nearby galaxy\ndistribution mapped by the Two Micron All-Sky redshift survey (2MRS). We find\nthat the galaxy distribution is highly anisotropic on small scales. The radial\nanisotropy gradually decreases with increasing length scales and the observed\nanisotropy is consistent with that expected for an isotropic Poisson\ndistribution beyond a length scale of $90 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$. Using mock\ncatalogues from N-body simulations, we find that the galaxy distribution in the\n2MRS exhibits a degree of anisotropy compatible with that of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel after accounting for the clustering bias of the 2MRS galaxies. We also\nquantify the polar and azimuthal anisotropies and identify two directions\n$(l,b)=(150^{\\circ}, -15^{\\circ})$, $(l,b)=(310^{\\circ},-15^{\\circ})$ which are\nsignificantly anisotropic compared to the other directions in the sky. We\nsuggest that their preferential orientations on the sky may indicate a possible\nalignment of the Local Group with two nearby large scale structures. Despite\nthe differences in the degree of anisotropy on small scales, we find that the\ngalaxy distributions in both the 2MRS and the $\\Lambda$CDM model are isotropic\non a scale of $90 \\, h^{-1}\\, {\\rm Mpc}$.\n", "  A combined mid-IR spectrum of five colliding-wind, massive, dust-producing\nPopulation I Wolf-Rayet (WR) binaries shows a wealth of absorption and emission\ndetails coming from the circumstellar dust envelopes, as well as from the\ninterstellar medium. The prominent absorption features may arise from a mix of\ninterstellar carbonaceous grains formed in high- (e.g., 3.4, 6.8, 7.2 $\\mu$m)\nand low-temperature (3.3, 6.9, 9.3 $\\mu$m) environments. The broad emission\ncomplexes around $\\sim$6.5, 8.0 and 8.8 $\\mu$m could arise from ionized, small\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) clusters and/or amorphous carbonaceous\ngrains. As such these PAH emissions may represent the long sought after\nprecursors of amorphous Carbon dust. We also detect a strong $\\sim$10.0 $\\mu$m\nemission in the spectra of WR48a and WR112, that we tentatively link to ionized\nPAHs. Upon examining the available archival spectra of prodigious individual WR\ndust sources, we notice a surprising lack of 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH band in the\nspectrum of the binary WR19, in contrast to the apparent strength of the 11.2,\n12.7 and 16.4 $\\mu$m PAH features. Strong PAH emissions are also detected in\nthe $\\lambda>$10 $\\mu$m spectrum of another dust-producing system, WR118,\npointing to the presence of large, neutral, presumably interstellar PAH\nmolecules towards WR19 and WR118.\n", "  We analysed the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data from a sample of\nbright accreting neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). With the\naim of studying the quasi-periodic variability as a function of the accretion\nregime, we carried out a systematic search of the quasi-periodic oscillations\n(QPOs) in the X-ray time series of these systems, using the integrated\nfractional variability as a tracker for the accretion states. We found that the\nthree QPO types originally identified in the '80s for the brightest LMXBs, the\nso-called Z-sources, i.e., horizontal, normal and flaring branch oscillations\n(HBOs, NBOs and FBOs, respectively), are also identified in the slightly less\nbright NS LMXBs, the so-called Atoll sources, where we see QPOs with a\nbehaviour consistent with the HBOs and FBOs. We compared the quasi-periodic\nvariability properties of our NS sample with those of a sample of black hole\n(BH) LMXBs. We confirm the association between HBOs, NBOs and FBOs observed in\nZ-sources, with the type-C, type-B and type-A QPOs, respectively, observed in\nBH systems, and we extended the comparison to the HBO-like and FBO-like QPOs\nseen in Atoll sources. We conclude that the variability properties of BH and\nweakly-magnetized NS LMXBs show strong similarities, with QPOs only weakly\nsensitive to the nature of the central compact object in both classes of\nsystems. We find that the historical association between kHz QPOs and\nhigh-frequency QPOs, seen around NSs and BHs, respectively, is not obvious when\ncomparing similar accretion states in the two kinds of systems.\n", "  From a sample of 84 local barred, moderately inclined disc galaxies, we\ndetermine the fraction which host boxy or peanut-shaped (B/P) bulges (the\nvertically thickened inner parts of bars). We find that the frequency of B/P\nbulges in barred galaxies is a very strong function of stellar mass: 79% of the\nbars in galaxies with log (M_{star}/M_{sun}) >~ 10.4 have B/P bulges, while\nonly 12% of those in lower-mass galaxies do. (We find a similar dependence in\ndata published by Yoshino & Yamauchi 2015 for edge-on galaxies.) There are also\nstrong trends with other galaxy parameters -- e.g., Hubble type: 77% of S0-Sbc\nbars, but only 15% of Sc-Sd bars, have B/P bulges -- but these appear to be\nside effects of the correlations of these parameters with stellar mass. In\nparticular, despite indications from models that a high gas content can\nsuppress bar buckling, we find no evidence that the (atomic) gas mass ratio\nM_{atomic}/M_{star} affects the presence of B/P bulges, once the stellar-mass\ndependence is controlled for.\n  The semi-major axes of B/P bulges range from one-quarter to three-quarters of\nthe full bar size, with a mean of R_{box}/L_{bar} = 0.42 +/- 0.09 and\nR_{box}/a_{max} = 0.53 +/- 0.12 (where R_{box} is the size of the B/P bulge and\na_{max} and L_{bar} are lower and upper limits on the size of the bar).\n", "  The distinctive morphology of head-tail radio galaxies reveals strong\ninteractions between the radio jets and their intra-cluster environment, the\ngeneral consensus on the morphology origin of head-tail sources is that radio\njets are bent by violent intra-cluster weather. We demonstrate in this paper\nthat such strong interactions provide a great opportunity to study the jet\nproperties and also the dynamics of intra-cluster medium (ICM). By\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we analyse the detailed\nbending process of a magnetically dominated jet, based on the magnetic tower\njet model. We use stratified atmospheres modulated by wind/shock to mimic the\nviolent intra-cluster weather. Core sloshing is found to be inevitable during\nthe wind-cluster core interaction, which induces significant shear motion and\ncould finally drive ICM turbulence around the jet, making it difficult for jet\nto survive. We perform detailed comparison between the behaviour of pure\nhydrodynamical jets and magnetic tower jet, and find that the jet-lobe\nmorphology could not survive against the violent disruption in all of our pure\nhydrodynamical jet models. On the other hand, the head-tail morphology is well\nreproduced by using a magnetic tower jet model bent by wind, in which\nhydrodynamical instabilities are naturally suppressed and the jet could always\nkeep its integrity under the protection of its internal magnetic fields.\nFinally, we also check the possibility for jet bending by shock only. We find\nthat shock could not bend jet significantly, so could not be expected to\nexplain the observed long tails in head-tail radio galaxies.\n", "  Aims. As a sub-Uranus-mass low-density planet, GJ 3470b has been found to\nshow a flat featureless transmission spectrum in the infrared and a tentative\nRayleigh scattering slope in the optical. We conducted an optical transmission\nspectroscopy project to assess the impacts of stellar activity and to determine\nwhether or not GJ 3470b hosts a hydrogen-rich gas envelop. Methods. We observed\nthree transits with the low-resolution OSIRIS spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias, and one transit with the high-resolution UVES spectrograph\nat the 8.2 m Very Large Telescope. Results. From the high-resolution data, we\nfind that the difference of the Ca II H+K lines in- and out-of-transit is only\n0.67 +/- 0.22%, and determine a magnetic filling factor of about 10-15%. From\nthe low-resolution data, we present the first optical transmission spectrum in\nthe 435-755 nm band, which shows a slope consistent with Rayleigh scattering.\nConclusions. After exploring the potential impacts of stellar activity in our\nobservations, we confirm that Rayleigh scattering in an extended\nhydrogen/helium atmosphere is currently the best explanation. Further\nhigh-precision observations that simultaneously cover optical and infrared\nbands are required to answer whether or not clouds and hazes exist at\nhigh-altitude.\n", "  We report on the stationary and robust propagation of light beams with rather\narbitrary and controllable intensity and dissipation transverse patterns in\nself-focusing Kerr media with nonlinear absorption. When nonlinear absorption\nis due to multi-photon ionization at high beam powers in transparent media such\nas glasses or air, these beams can generate multiple plasma channels with\ntailored geometries. Their nature and spatial characteristics are discussed in\ndetail, as well as the laws determining their spontaneous formation from\ncoherent superpositions of Bessel beams of different amplitudes and topological\ncharges.\n", "  The Wiener Filter (WF) technique enables the reconstruction of density and\nvelocity fields from observed radial peculiar velocities. This paper aims at\nidentifying the optimal design of peculiar velocity surveys within the WF\nframework. The prime goal is to test the dependence of the quality of the\nreconstruction on the distribution and nature of data points. Mock datasets,\nextending to 250 Mpc/h, are drawn from a constrained simulation that mimics the\nlocal Universe to produce realistic mock catalogs. Reconstructed fields\nobtained with these mocks are compared to the reference simulation.\nComparisons, including residual distributions, cell-to-cell and bulk\nvelocities, imply that the presence of field data points is essential to\nproperly measure the flows. The fields reconstructed from mocks that consist\nonly of galaxy cluster data points exhibit poor quality bulk velocities. In\naddition, the quality of the reconstruction depends strongly on the grouping of\nindividual data points into single points to suppress virial motions in high\ndensity regions. Conversely, the presence of a Zone of Avoidance hardly affects\nthe reconstruction. For a given number of data points, a uniform sample does\nnot score any better than a sample with decreasing number of data points with\nthe distance. The best reconstructions are obtained with a grouped survey\ncontaining field galaxies: Assuming no error, they differ from the simulated\nfield by less than 100 km/s up to the extreme edge of the catalogs or up to a\ndistance of three times the mean distance of data points for non-uniform\ncatalogs. The overall conclusions hold when errors are added.\n", "  White dwarf stars have been used as flux standards for decades, thanks to\ntheir staid simplicity. We have empirically tested their photometric stability\nby analyzing the light curves of 398 high-probability candidates and\nspectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs observed during the original Kepler\nmission and later with K2 Campaigns 0-8. We find that the vast majority (>97\nper cent) of non-pulsating and apparently isolated white dwarfs are stable to\nbetter than 1 per cent in the Kepler bandpass on 1-hr to 10-d timescales,\nconfirming that these stellar remnants are useful flux standards. From the\ncases that do exhibit significant variability, we caution that binarity,\nmagnetism, and pulsations are three important attributes to rule out when\nestablishing white dwarfs as flux standards, especially those hotter than\n30,000 K.\n", "  Spiral arms are common features in low-redshift disc galaxies, and are\nprominent sites of star-formation and dust obscuration. However, spiral\nstructure can take many forms: from galaxies displaying two strong `grand\ndesign' arms, to those with many `flocculent' arms. We investigate how these\ndifferent arm types are related to a galaxy's star-formation and gas properties\nby making use of visual spiral arm number measurements from Galaxy Zoo 2. We\ncombine UV and mid-IR photometry from GALEX and WISE to measure the rates and\nrelative fractions of obscured and unobscured star formation in a sample of\nlow-redshift SDSS spirals. Total star formation rate has little dependence on\nspiral arm multiplicity, but two-armed spirals convert their gas to stars more\nefficiently. We find significant differences in the fraction of obscured\nstar-formation: an additional $\\sim 10$ per cent of star-formation in two-armed\ngalaxies is identified via mid-IR dust emission, compared to that in many-armed\ngalaxies. The latter are also significantly offset below the IRX-$\\beta$\nrelation for low-redshift star-forming galaxies. We present several\nexplanations for these differences versus arm number: variations in the spatial\ndistribution, sizes or clearing timescales of star-forming regions (i.e.,\nmolecular clouds), or contrasting recent star-formation histories.\n", "  Magnetar magnetospheres gradually become twisted due to shearing by footpoint\nmotion. The axisymmetric solutions for the force-free field with a power-law\ncurrent model are calculated by taking into account general relativistic\neffects. Here we show how the magnetic energy and helicity are accumulated\nalong a sequence of equilibria. In a strongly twisted case, a magnetic flux\nrope, in which a large amount of toroidal field is confined, detaches in the\nvicinity of the star. It is found this kind of magnetic field line structure is\neasily produced due to strong relativistic effects compared with the results in\nflat spacetime. Although the structure is not inherent to the relativity, the\nconfinement is possible even for a smaller power-law index. There is an upper\nbound on the energy and helicity stored in the magnetosphere. When the helicity\nis further accumulated, a catastrophic event such as a giant flare may occur.\n", "  Non-VLBI measurements of Faraday rotation at mm wavelengths have been used to\nconstrain mass accretion rates ($\\mdot$) onto supermassive black holes in the\ncentre of the Milky Way and in the centre of M87. We constructed general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamics models for these sources that qualitatively\nwell describe their spectra and radio/mm images invoking a coupled jet-disk\nsystem. Using general relativistic polarized radiative transfer, we now also\nmodel the observed mm rotation measure (RM) of M87. The models are tied to the\nobserved radio flux, however, electron temperature and accretion rate are\ndegenerate parameters and are allowed to vary. For the inferred low viewing\nangles of the M87 jet, the RM is low even as the black hole $\\mdot$ increases\nby a factor of $\\simeq100$. In jet-dominated models, the observed linear\npolarization is produced in the forward-jet, while the dense accretion disk\ndepolarizes the bulk of the near-horizon scale emission which originates in the\ncounter-jet. In the jet-dominated models, with increasing $\\mdot$ and\nincreasing Faraday optical depth one is progressively sensitive only to\npolarized emission in the forward-jet, keeping the measured RM relatively\nconstant. The jet-dominated model reproduces a low net-polarization of\n$\\simeq1$ per cent and RMs in agreement with observed values due to Faraday\ndepolarization, however, with $\\mdot$ much larger than the previously inferred\nlimit of $9\\times10^{-4}\\,\\mdotu$. All jet-dominated models produce much higher\nRMs for inclination angles $i\\gtrsim30^\\circ$, where the line-of-sight passes\nthrough the accretion flow, thereby providing independent constraints on the\nviewing geometry of the M87 jet.\n", "  The energy released in solar flares derives from a reconfiguration of\nmagnetic fields to a lower energy state, and is manifested in several forms,\nincluding bulk kinetic energy of the coronal mass ejection, acceleration of\nelectrons and ions, and enhanced thermal energy that is ultimately radiated\naway across the electromagnetic spectrum from optical to X-rays. Using an\nunprecedented set of coordinated observations, from a suite of instruments, we\nhere report on a hitherto largely overlooked energy component -- the kinetic\nenergy associated with small-scale turbulent mass motions. We show that the\nspatial location of, and timing of the peak in, turbulent kinetic energy\ntogether provide persuasive evidence that turbulent energy may play a key role\nin the transfer of energy in solar flares. Although the kinetic energy of\nturbulent motions accounts, at any given time, for only $\\sim (0.5-1)$\\% of the\nenergy released, its relatively rapid ($\\sim$$1-10$~s) energization and\ndissipation causes the associated throughput of energy (i.e., power) to rival\nthat of major components of the released energy in solar flares, and thus\npresumably in other astrophysical acceleration sites.\n", "  In an earlier paper we treated the pre-ionisation problem in shocks over the\nvelocity range $20 < v_{\\rm s} < 1000$km/s in a fully self-consistent manner.\nHere we investigate in detail the effect of the upstream UV photon field\ngenerated in the radiative zone of shocks in the range in which hydrogen is\nonly partly ionised ($20 < v_{\\rm s} < 150$km/s). We show that, as a result of\nsuper-heating in the non-equilibrium pre-shock plasma, both the magnetic\nparameter and the Mach number of the shock is strongly affected by the\npre-ionisation state of the gas which controls to a large extent the radiative\nspectrum of the shock. We use these models to provide specific line diagnostics\nfor Herbig-Haro objects which allow us to solve for both the pre-shock density\nand shock velocity, and present detailed models of the HH34 jet which allows us\nto derive the shock conditions, mass-loss rate, momentum flux and chemical\nabundances in the jet. We show that the refractory elements, Mg, Ca, Fe and Ni\nare enhanced by 0.22 dex over the solar values, which provides interesting\nclues about the jet launching mechanism in pre-main sequence evolution.\n", "  We have searched for photometric variability in 95 Vir, a fast rotating,\nchromospherically active early F-type star, which was observed in the framework\nof Campaign 6 of the Kepler K2 mission. Available literature information on 95\nVir were procured, and well-established calibrations were employed to verify\nthe derived astrophysical parameters. We have investigated the location of our\ntarget star in the M(Bol) versus log T(eff) diagram, which provides information\non evolutionary status. We have discussed our results in detail, drawing on\nliterature information and the theoretical predictions of state-of-the-art\npulsation models, with the aim of unraveling the underlying variability\nmechanisms. From an analysis of 3400 long-cadence measurements, we have\nidentified two main frequencies and several harmonics in our target star. We\nattribute the main frequency, f1 = 9.53728 d**-1, to delta Scuti pulsations.\nThe origin of the secondary signal, f2 = 1.07129 d**-1, is less clear. We have\ninvestigated three possible interpretations of the low-frequency variation:\nbinarity, pulsation and rotational modulation. Current evidence favours an\ninterpretation of f2 as a signature of the rotational period caused by the\npresence of cool star spots, which goes along well with the observed\nchromospheric activity. However, phase-resolved spectroscopy is needed to\nverify this assumption. We briefly consider other chromospherically active\ndelta Scuti stars that have been presented in the literature. A search for star\nspot-induced photometric variability in these objects might be of great\ninterest, as well as an investigation of the interplay between chromospheric\nand pulsational activity.\n", "  We explore how measurements of protoplanetary disc masses and accretion rates\nprovided by surveys of star forming regions can be analysed via the\ndimensionless accretion parameter, which we define as the product of the\naccretion rate and stellar age divided by the disc mass. By extending and\ngeneralising the study of Jones et al (2012), we demonstrate that this\nparameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of\nevolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of\noutside in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess\nthe reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and submm\ncontinuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in\nregions which are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while\ndust based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical\nexpectations assuming canonical dust/gas ratio, the systematically lower CO\nbased estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in\ncontrast with the theory. This finding provides additional evidence that CO\nbased disc masses are an under-estimate, in line with arguments that have been\nmade on the basis of chemical modelling of relatively small samples. On the\nother hand, we demonstrate that dust based mass estimates are sufficiently\naccurate to reveal distinctly higher accretion efficiencies in the Trapezium\ncluster, where this result is expected given the evident importance of external\nphotoevaporation. We therefore propose the dimensionless accretion parameter as\na new diagnostic of external photoevaporation in other star forming regions.\n", "  We obtained new quantitative determinations of the nitrogen abundance and a\nconsistent relation between nitrogen and oxygen abundances for a sample of\nSeyfert 2 galaxies located at redshift $z < 0.1$. We carried out this analysis\nusing the Cloudy code to build detailed photoionization models. We were able to\nreproduce observed optical narrow emission line intensities for 44 sources\ncompiled from the literature. Our results show that Seyfert 2 nuclei have\nnitrogen abundances ranging from $\\sim0.3$ to $\\sim 7.5$ times the solar value.\nWe derived the relation $\\rm \\log(N/H)=1.05 (\\pm0.09) \\times [\\log(O/H)] -0.35\n(\\pm 0.33$). Results for N/O vs. O/H abundance ratios derived for Seyfert 2\ngalaxies are in consonance with those recently derived for a sample of\nextragalactic disk HII regions with high metallicity.\n", "  Using a sample of two hundred luminous (L_unabs>10^38 erg/s, where L_unabs is\nthe unabsorbed 0.25-8 keV luminosity) high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) candidates\nfound with Chandra in 27 nearby galaxies, we have constructed the collective\nX-ray spectrum of HMXBs in the local Universe per unit star formation rate,\ncorrected for observational biases associated with intrinsic diversity of HMXB\nspectra and X-ray absorption in the interstellar medium. This spectrum is well\nfit by a power law with a photon index Gamma=2.1+/-0.1 and is dominated by\nultraluminous X-ray sources with L_unabs>10^39 erg/s. Hard sources (those with\nthe 0.25-2 keV to 0.25-8 keV flux ratio of <0.6) dominate above ~2 keV, while\nsoft and supersoft sources (with the flux ratios of 0.6-0.95 and >0.95,\nrespectively) at lower energies. The derived spectrum probably represents the\nangle-integrated X-ray emission of the near- and super-critically accreting\nstellar mass black holes and neutron stars in the local Universe. It provides\nan important constraint on supercritical accretion models and can be used as a\nreference spectrum for calculations of the X-ray preheating of the Universe by\nthe first generations of X-ray binaries.\n", "  We constrain the proper motions of five OB stars associated with candidate\nstellar wind bow shocks in the Carina Nebula using HST ACS imaging over 9--10\nyear baselines. These proper motions allow us to directly compare each star's\nmotion to the orientation of its candidate bow shock. Although these stars are\nsaturated in our imaging, we assess their motion by the shifts required to\nminimize residuals in their Airy rings. The results limit the direction of each\nstar's motion to sectors less than 90 degrees wide. None of the five stars are\nmoving away from the Carina Nebula's central clusters as runaway stars would\nbe, confirming that a candidate bow shock is not necessarily indicative of a\nrunaway star. Two of the five stars are moving tangentially relative to the\norientation of their candidate bow shocks, both of which point at the OB\ncluster Trumpler 14. In these cases, the large-scale flow of the interstellar\nmedium, powered by feedback from the cluster, appears to dominate over the\nmotion of the star in producing the observed candidate bow shock. The remaining\nthree stars all have some component of motion toward the central clusters,\nmeaning that we cannot distinguish whether their candidate bow shocks are\nindicators of stellar motion, of the flow of ambient gas, or of density\ngradients in their surroundings. In addition, these stars' lack of outward\nmotion hints that the distributed massive-star population in Carina's South\nPillars region formed in place, rather than migrating out from the\nassociation's central clusters.\n", "  We model the radiatively driven flow from IM Lup -- a large protoplanetary\ndisc expected to be irradiated by only a weak external radiation field (at\nleast 10$^4$ times lower than the UV field irradiating the Orion Nebula Cluster\nproplyds). We find that material at large radii ($>400$AU) in this disc is\nsufficiently weakly gravitationally bound that significant mass loss can be\ninduced. Given the estimated values of the disc mass and accretion rate, the\nviscous timescale is long ($\\sim10$Myr) so the main evolutionary behaviour for\nthe first Myr of the disc's lifetime is truncation of the disc by\nphotoevaporation, with only modest changes effected by viscosity. We also\nproduce approximate synthetic observations of our models, finding substantial\nemission from the flow which can explain the CO halo observed about IM Lup out\nto $\\geq1000$AU. Solutions that are consistent with the extent of the observed\nCO emission generally imply that IM Lup is still in the process of having its\ndisc outer radius truncated. We conclude that IM Lup is subject to substantial\nexternal photoevaporation, which raises the more general possibility that\nexternal irradiation of the largest discs can be of significant importance even\nin low mass star forming regions.\n", "  We present the first fully simultaneous fits to the NIR and X-ray spectral\nslope (and its evolution) during a very bright flare from Sgr A*, the\nsupermassive black hole at the Milky Way's center. Our study arises from\nambitious multi-wavelength monitoring campaigns with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR and\nSINFONI. The average multi-wavelength spectrum is well reproduced by a broken\npower-law with $\\Gamma_{NIR}=1.7\\pm0.1$ and $\\Gamma_X=2.27\\pm0.12$. The\ndifference in spectral slopes ($\\Delta\\Gamma=0.57\\pm0.09$) strongly supports\nsynchrotron emission with a cooling break. The flare starts first in the NIR\nwith a flat and bright NIR spectrum, while X-ray radiation is detected only\nafter about $10^3$ s, when a very steep X-ray spectrum\n($\\Delta\\Gamma=1.8\\pm0.4$) is observed. These measurements are consistent with\nsynchrotron emission with a cooling break and they suggest that the high energy\ncut-off in the electron distribution ($\\gamma_{max}$) induces an initial\ncut-off in the optical-UV band that evolves slowly into the X-ray band. The\ntemporal and spectral evolution observed in all bright X-ray flares are also in\nline with a slow evolution of $\\gamma_{max}$. We also observe hints for a\nvariation of the cooling break that might be induced by an evolution of the\nmagnetic field (from $B\\sim30\\pm8$ G to $B\\sim4.8\\pm1.7$ G at the X-ray peak).\nSuch drop of the magnetic field at the flare peak would be expected if the\nacceleration mechanism is tapping energy from the magnetic field, such as in\nmagnetic reconnection. We conclude that synchrotron emission with a cooling\nbreak is a viable process for Sgr A*'s flaring emission.\n", "  We calculate tidally driven mean flows in a slowly and uniformly rotating\nmassive main sequence star in a binary system. We treat the tidal potential due\nto the companion as a small perturbation to the primary star. We compute tidal\nresponses of the primary as forced linear oscillations, as a function of the\ntidal forcing frequency $\\omega_{\\rm tide}=2(\\Omega_{\\rm orb}-\\Omega)$, where\n$\\Omega_{\\rm orb}$ is the mean orbital angular velocity and $\\Omega$ is the\nangular velocity of rotation of the primary star. The amplitude of the tidal\nresponses is proportional to the parameter $f_0\\propto (M_2/M)(a_{\\rm\norb}/R)^{-3}$, where $M$ and $M_2$ are the masses of the primary and companion\nstars, $R$ is the radius of the primary and $a_{\\rm orb}$ is the mean orbital\nseparation between the stars. For a given $f_0$, the amplitudes depend on\n$\\omega_{\\rm tide}$ and become large when $\\omega_{\\rm tide}$ is in resonance\nwith natural frequencies of the star. Using the tidal responses, we calculate\naxisymmetric mean flows, assuming that the mean flows are non-oscillatory flows\ndriven via non-linear effects of linear tidal responses. We find that the\n$\\phi$-component of the mean flow velocity dominates. We also find that the\namplitudes of the mean flows are large only in the surface layers where\nnon-adiabatic effects are significant and that the amplitudes are confined to\nthe equatorial regions of the star. Depending on $M_2/M$ and $a_{\\rm orb}/R$,\nthe amplitudes of mean flows at the surface become significant.\n", "  We have studied the environment of the FU Ori type star V582 Aur. Our aim is\nto explore the star-forming region associated with this young eruptive star.\nUsing slitless spectroscopy we searched for H alpha emission stars within a\nfield of 11.5arcmin \\times 11.5arcmin, centred on V582 Aur. Based on UKIDSS and\nSpitzer Space Telescope data we further selected infrared-excess young stellar\nobject candidates. In all, we identified 68 candidate low-mass young stars, 16\nof which exhibited H alpha emission in the slitless spectroscopic images. The\ncolour-magnitude diagram of the selected objects, based on IPHAS data, suggests\nthat they are low-mass pre-main-sequence stars associated with the Aur OB 1\nassociation, located at a distance of 1.3 kpc from the Sun. The bright-rimmed\nglobules in the local environment of V582 Aur probably belong to the dark cloud\nLDN~1516. Our results suggest that star formation in these globules might have\nbeen triggered by the radiation field of a few hot members of Aur OB 1. The\nbolometric luminosity of V582 Aur, based on archival photometric data and on\nthe adopted distance, is 150-320 Lsun.\n", "  Accurate measurements of deep solar meridional flow are of vital interest for\nunderstanding the solar dynamo. In this paper, we validate a recently developed\nmethod for obtaining sensitivity functions (kernels) for travel-time\nmeasurements to solar interior flows using the Born approximation in spherical\ngeometry, which is expected to be more accurate than the classical ray\napproximation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical approach to efficiently\ncompute a large number of kernels based on the separability of the\neigenfunctions into their horizontal and radial dependence. The validation is\nperformed using a hydrodynamic simulation of linear wave propagation in the\nSun, which includes a standard single-cell meridional flow profile. We show\nthat, using the Born approximation, it is possible to accurately model\nobservational quantities relevant for time-distance helioseismology such as the\nmean power spectrum, disc-averaged cross-covariance functions, and travel times\nin the presence of a flow field. In order to closely match the model to\nobservations, we show that it is beneficial to use mode frequencies and damping\nrates which were extracted from the measured power spectrum. Furthermore, the\ncontribution of the radial flow to the total travel time is found to reach 20%\nof the contribution of the horizontal flow at travel distances over $40^\\circ$.\nUsing the Born kernels and a 2D SOLA inversion of travel times, we can recover\nmost features of the input meridional flow profile. The Born approximation is\nthus a promising method for inferring large-scale solar interior flows.\n", "  The test particle Monte-Carlo models for neutral particles are often used in\nthe tokamak edge modelling codes. The drawback of this approach is that the\nself-consistent solution suffers from random error introduced by the\nstatistical method. A particular case where the onset of nonphysical solutions\ncan be clearly identified is violation of the global particle balance due to\nnon-converged residuals. There are techniques which can reduce the residuals -\nsuch as internal iterations in the code B2-EIRENE - but they may pose severe\nrestrictions on the time-step and slow down the computations. Numerical\ndiagnostics described in the paper can be used to unambiguously identify when\nthe too large error in the global particle balance is due to finite-volume\nresiduals, and their reduction is absolutely necessary. Algorithms which reduce\nthe error while allowing large time-step are also discussed.\n", "  We present sensitive 3.0 cm JVLA radio continuum observations of six regions\nof low-mass star formation that include twelve young brown dwarfs and four\nyoung brown dwarf candidates. We detect a total of 49 compact radio sources in\nthe fields observed, of which 24 have no reported counterparts and are\nconsidered new detections. Twelve of the radio sources show variability in\ntimescales of weeks to months, suggesting gyrosynchrotron emission produced in\nactive magnetospheres. Only one of the target brown dwarfs, FU Tau A, was\ndetected. However, we detected radio emission associated with two of the brown\ndwarf candidates, WL 20S and CHLT 2. The radio flux densities of the sources\nassociated with these brown dwarf candidates are more than an order of\nmagnitude larger than expected for a brown dwarf and suggest a revision of\ntheir classification. In contrast, FU Tau A falls on the well-known correlation\nbetween radio luminosity and bolometric luminosity, suggesting that the\nemission comes from a thermal jet and that this brown dwarf seems to be forming\nas a scaled-down version of low-mass stars.\n", "  We compare the effects of local features (LF) and branch features (BF) of the\ninflaton potential on the spectrum of primordial perturbations. We show that LF\naffect the spectrum in a narrow range of scales while BF produce a step between\nlarge and small scales with respect to the featureless spectrum. We comment on\nthe possibility of distinguishing between these two types of feature models\nfrom the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data.\n  We also show that there exists a quantitative similarity between the\nprimordial spectra predicted by two of the BF potentials considered. This could\nlead to a degeneracy of their predicted CMB temperature spectra which could\nmake difficult to discriminate between the models from a CMB analysis. We\ncomment on the possibility that the degeneracy can be broken when higher order\nterms in the perturbations are considered. In this sense non-Gaussianity may\nplay an important role in discerning between different inflationary models\nwhich predict similar spectra.\n", "  We present an X-ray timing analysis of the transient X-ray binary MXB\n1658-298, using data obtained from the RXTE and XMM-Newton observatories. We\nhave made 27 new mid eclipse time measurements from observations made during\nthe two outbursts of the source. These new measurements have been combined with\nthe previously known values to study long term changes in orbital period of the\nbinary system. We have found that the mid-eclipse timing record of MXB 1658-298\nis quite unusual. The long term evolution of mid-eclipse times indicates an\noverall orbital period decay with a time scale of -- 6.5(7) x 10^7 year. Over\nand above this orbital period decay, the O-C residual curve also shows a\nperiodic residual on shorter timescales. This sinusoidal variation has an\namplitude of ~9 lt-sec and a period of ~760 d. This is indicative of presence\nof a third body around the compact X-ray binary. The mass and orbital radius of\nthe third body are estimated to lie in the range, 20.5-26.9 Jupiter mass and\n750-860 lt-sec, respectively. If true, then it will be the most massive\ncircumbinary planet and also the smallest period binary known to host a planet.\n", "  We present the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations\ninvestigating the evolution and fragmentation of filaments that are accreting\nfrom a turbulent medium. We show that the presence of turbulence, and the\nresulting inhomogeneities in the accretion flow, play a significant role in the\nfragmentation process. Filaments which experience a weakly turbulent accretion\nflow fragment in a two-tier hierarchical fashion, similar to the fragmentation\npattern seen in the Orion Integral Shaped Filament. Increasing the energy in\nthe turbulent velocity field results in more sub-structure within the\nfilaments, and one sees a shift from gravity-dominated fragmentation to\nturbulence-dominated fragmentation. The sub-structure formed in the filaments\nis elongated and roughly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the filament,\nsimilar to the fibres seen in observations of Taurus, and suggests that the\nfray and fragment scenario is a possible mechanism for the production of\nfibres. We show that the formation of these fibre-like structures is linked to\nthe vorticity of the velocity field inside the filament and the filament's\naccretion from an inhomogeneous medium. Moreover, we find that accretion is\nable to drive and sustain roughly sonic levels of turbulence inside the\nfilaments, but is not able to prevent radial collapse once the filaments become\nsupercritical. However, the supercritical filaments which contain fibre-like\nstructures do not collapse radially, suggesting that fibrous filaments may not\nnecessarily become radially unstable once they reach the critical line-density.\n", "  The presence of multiple populations (MPs) with distinctive light element\nabundances is a widespread phenomenon in clusters older than 6 Gyr. Clusters\nwith masses, luminosities, and sizes comparable to those of ancient globulars\nare still forming today. Nonetheless, the presence of light element variations\nhas been poorly investigated in such young systems, even if the knowledge of\nthe age at which this phenomenon develops is crucial for theoretical models on\nMPs. We use J-band integrated spectra of three young (7-40 Myr) clusters in NGC\n4038 to look for Al variations indicative of MPs. Assuming that the large\nmajority (>70%) of stars are characterised by high Al content - as observed in\nGalactic clusters with comparable mass; we find that none of the studied\nclusters show significant Al variations. Small Al spreads have been measured in\nall the six young clusters observed in the near-infrared. While it is unlikely\nthat young clusters only show low Al whereas old ones display different levels\nof Al variations; this suggests the possibility that MPs are not present at\nsuch young ages at least among the high-mass stellar component. Alternatively,\nthe fraction of stars with field-like chemistry could be extremely large,\nmimicking low Al abundances in the integrated spectrum. Finally, since the\nnear-infrared stellar continuum of young clusters is almost entirely due to\nluminous red supergiants, we can also speculate that MPs only manifest\nthemselves in low mass stars due to some evolutionary mechanism.\n", "  Both simulations and observations have found that the spin of halo/galaxy is\ncorrelated with the large scale environment, and particularly the spin of halo\nflips in filament. A consistent picture of halo spin evolution in different\nenvironments is still lacked. Using N-body simulation we find that halo spin\nwith its environment evolves continuously from sheet to cluster, and the flip\nof halo spin happens both in filament and nodes. For the flip in filament can\nbe explained by halo formation time and the migrating time when its environment\nchanges from sheet to filament. For low-mass haloes, they form first in sheets\nand migrate into filaments later, so their mass and spin growth inside filament\nare lower, and the original spin is still parallel to filament. For massive\nhaloes, they migrate into filaments first, and most of their mass and spin\ngrowth are obtained in filaments, so the resulted spin is perpendicular to\nfilament. Our results well explain the overall evolution of cosmic web in the\ncold dark matter model and can be tested using high-redshift data. The scenario\ncan also be tested against alternative models of dark matter, such as warm/hot\ndark matter, where the structure formation will proceed in a different way.\n", "  Water fountain stars (WFs) are evolved objects with water masers tracing\nhigh-velocity jets (up to several hundreds of km s$^{-1}$). They could\nrepresent one of the first manifestations of collimated mass-loss in evolved\nobjects and thus, be a key to understanding the shaping mechanisms of planetary\nnebulae. Only 13 objects had been confirmed so far as WFs with interferometer\nobservations. We present new observations with the Australia Telescope Compact\nArray and archival observations with the Very Large Array of four objects that\nare considered to be WF candidates, mainly based on single-dish observations.\nWe confirm IRAS 17291-2147 and IRAS 18596+0315 (OH 37.1-0.8) as bona fide\nmembers of the WF class, with high-velocity water maser emission consistent\nwith tracing bipolar jets. We argue that IRAS 15544-5332 has been wrongly\nconsidered as a WF in previous works, since we see no evidence in our data nor\nin the literature that this object harbours high-velocity water maser emission.\nIn the case of IRAS 19067+0811, we did not detect any water maser emission, so\nits confirmation as a WF is still pending. With the result of this work, there\nare 15 objects that can be considered confirmed WFs. We speculate that there is\nno significant physical difference between WFs and obscured post-AGB stars in\ngeneral. The absence of high-velocity water maser emission in some obscured\npost-AGB stars could be attributed to a variability or orientation effect.\n", "  Despite the more than one order of magnitude difference between the measured\ndipole moments in $^{144}$Ba and $^{146}$Ba, the strength of the octupole\ncorrelations in $^{146}$Ba are found to be as strong as those in $^{144}$Ba\nwith a similarly large value of $B(E3;3^- \\rightarrow 0^+)$ determined as\n48($^{+21}_{-29}$) W.u. The new results not only establish unambiguously the\npresence of a region of octupole deformation centered on these neutron-rich Ba\nisotopes, but also manifest the dependence of the electric dipole moments on\nthe occupancy of different neutron orbitals in nuclei with enhanced octupole\nstrength, as revealed by fully microscopic calculations.\n", "  We present a set of full evolutionary sequences for white dwarfs with\nhydrogen-deficient atmospheres. We take into account the evolutionary history\nof the progenitor stars, all the relevant energy sources involved in the\ncooling, element diffusion in the very outer layers, and outer boundary\nconditions provided by new and detailed non-gray white dwarf model atmospheres\nfor pure helium composition. These model atmospheres are based on the most\nup-to-date physical inputs. Our calculations extend down to very low effective\ntemperatures, of $\\sim 2\\,500$~K, provide a homogeneous set of evolutionary\ncooling tracks that are appropriate for mass and age determinations of old\nhydrogen-deficient white dwarfs, and represent a clear improvement over\nprevious efforts, which were computed using gray atmospheres.\n", "  Here we present an in-depth study of the behaviour of the Fast Folding\nAlgorithm, an alternative pulsar searching technique to the Fast Fourier\nTransform. Weaknesses in the Fast Fourier Transform, including a susceptibility\nto red noise, leave it insensitive to pulsars with long rotational periods (P >\n1 s). This sensitivity gap has the potential to bias our understanding of the\nperiod distribution of the pulsar population. The Fast Folding Algorithm, a\ntime-domain based pulsar searching technique, has the potential to overcome\nsome of these biases. Modern distributed-computing frameworks now allow for the\napplication of this algorithm to all-sky blind pulsar surveys for the first\ntime. However, many aspects of the behaviour of this search technique remain\npoorly understood, including its responsiveness to variations in pulse shape\nand the presence of red noise. Using a custom CPU-based implementation of the\nFast Folding Algorithm, ffancy, we have conducted an in-depth study into the\nbehaviour of the Fast Folding Algorithm in both an ideal, white noise regime as\nwell as a trial on observational data from the HTRU-S Low Latitude pulsar\nsurvey, including a comparison to the behaviour of the Fast Fourier Transform.\nWe are able to both confirm and expand upon earlier studies that demonstrate\nthe ability of the Fast Folding Algorithm to outperform the Fast Fourier\nTransform under ideal white noise conditions, and demonstrate a significant\nimprovement in sensitivity to long-period pulsars in real observational data\nthrough the use of the Fast Folding Algorithm.\n", "  Gas velocity dispersion measures the amount of disordered motions of a\nrotating disk. Accurate estimates of this parameter are of the utmost\nimportance because it is directly linked to disk stability and star formation.\nA global measure of the gas velocity dispersion can be inferred from the width\nof the atomic hydrogen HI 21 cm line. We explore how several systematic effects\ninvolved in the production of HI cubes affect the estimate of HI velocity\ndispersion. We do so by comparing the HI velocity dispersion derived from\ndifferent types of data cubes provided by The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS).\nWe find that residual-scaled cubes best recover the HI velocity dispersion,\nindependent of the weighting scheme used and for a large range of\nsignal-to-noise ratio. For HI observations where the dirty beam is\nsubstantially different from a Gaussian, the velocity dispersion values are\noverestimated unless the cubes are cleaned close to (e.g., ~1.5 times) the\nnoise level.\n", "  We have obtained OH spectra of four transitions in the $^2\\Pi_{3/2}$ ground\nstate, at 1612, 1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz, toward 51 sightlines that were\nobserved in the Herschel project Galactic Observations of Terahertz C+. The\nobservations cover the longitude range of (32$^\\circ$, 64$^\\circ$) and\n(189$^\\circ$, 207$^\\circ$) in the northern Galactic plane. All of the diffuse\nOH emissions conform to the so-called 'Sum Rule' of the four brightness\ntemperatures, indicating optically thin emission condition for OH from diffuse\nclouds in the Galactic plane. The column densities of the HI `halos' N(HI)\nsurrounding molecular clouds increase monotonically with OH column density,\nN(OH), until saturating when N(HI)=1.0 x 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ and N (OH) $\\geq\n4.5\\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$, indicating the presence of molecular gas that\ncannot be traced by HI. Such a linear correlation, albeit weak, is suggestive\nof HI halos' contribution to the UV shielding required for molecular formation.\nAbout 18% of OH clouds have no associated CO emission (CO-dark) at a\nsensitivity of 0.07 K but are associated with C$^+$ emission. A weak\ncorrelation exists between C$^+$ intensity and OH column density for CO-dark\nmolecular clouds. These results imply that OH seems to be a better tracer of\nmolecular gas than CO in diffuse molecular regions.\n", "  A brief analysis of the proton parallel and oblique firehose instability is\npresented from a fluid perspective and the results are compared to kinetic\ntheory solutions obtained by the WHAMP code. It is shown that the classical CGL\nmodel very accurately describes the growth rate of these instabilities at\nsufficiently long spatial scales (small wavenumbers). The required\nstabilization of these instabilities at small spatial scales (high wavenumbers)\nnaturally requires dispersive effects and the stabilization is due to the Hall\nterm and finite Larmor radius (FLR) corrections to the pressure tensor. Even\nthough the stabilization is not completely accurate since at small spatial\nscales a relatively strong collisionless damping comes into effect, we find\nthat the main concepts of the maximum growth rate and the stabilization of\nthese instabilities is indeed present in the fluid description. However, there\nare differences that are quite pronounced when close to the firehose threshold\nand that clarify the different profiles for marginally stable states with a\nprescribed maximum growth rate $\\gamma_{max}$ in the simple fluid models\nconsidered here and the kinetic description.\n", "  We report on speckle observations of binary stars carried out at the WIYN\nTelescope over the period from September 2010 through February 2012, providing\nrelative astrometry for 2521 observations of 883 objects, 856 of which are\ndouble stars and 27 of which are triples. The separations measured span a range\nof 0.01 to 1.75 arc seconds. Wavelengths of 562 nm, 692 nm, and 880 nm were\nused, and differential photometry at one or more of these wavelengths is\npresented in most cases. Sixty-six components were resolved for the first time.\nWe also estimate detection limits at 0.2 and 1.0 arc seconds for high-quality\nobservations in cases where no companion was seen, a total of 176 additional\nobjects. Detection limits vary based on observing conditions and\nsignal-to-noise ratio, but are approximately 4 magnitudes at 0.2 arc seconds\nand 6 magnitudes at 1.0 arc seconds on average. Analyzing the measurement\nprecision of the data set, we find that the individual separations obtained\nhave linear measurement uncertainties of approximately 2 mas, and photometry is\nuncertain to approximately 0.1 magnitudes in general. This work provides\nfundamental, well-calibrated data for future orbit and mass determinations, and\nwe present three first orbits and total mass estimates of nearby K-dwarf\nsystems as examples of this potential.\n", "  Employing two state-of-the-art methods, multiconfiguration\nDirac--Hartree--Fock and second-order many-body perturbation theory, the\nexcitation energies and lifetimes for the lowest 200 states of the $2s^2 2p^4$,\n$2s 2p^5$, $2p^6$, $2s^2 2p^3 3s$, $2s^2 2p^3 3p$, $2s^2 2p^3 3d$, $2s 2p^4\n3s$, $2s 2p^4 3p$, and $2s 2p^4 3d$ configurations, and multipole (electric\ndipole (E1), magnetic dipole (M1), and electric quadrupole (E2)) transition\nrates, line strengths, and oscillator strengths among these states are\ncalculated for each O-like ion from Cr XVII to Zn XXIII. Our two data sets are\ncompared with the NIST and CHIANTI compiled values, and previous calculations.\nThe data are accurate enough for identification and deblending of new emission\nlines from the sun and other astrophysical sources. The amount of data of high\naccuracy is significantly increased for the $n = 3$ states of several O-like\nions of astrophysics interest, where experimental data are very scarce.\n", "  We report on an X-ray observing campaign of the ultraluminous X-ray source IC\n342 X-1 with NuSTAR and Swift in 2016 October, in which we captured the very\nmoment when the source showed spectral variation. The Swift/XRT spectrum\nobtained in October 9--11 has a power-law shape and is consistent with those\nobserved in the coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations in 2012. In\nOctober 16--17, when the 3--10 keV flux became $\\approx$4 times higher, we\nperformed simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift observations. In this epoch, the source\nshowed a more round-shaped spectrum like that seen with ASCA 23 years ago.\nThanks to the wide energy coverage and high sensitivity of NuSTAR, we obtained\nhard X-ray data covering up to $\\sim$30 keV for the first time during the high\nluminosity state of IC 342 X-1. The observed spectrum has a broader profile\nthan the multi-color disk blackbody model. The X-ray flux decreased again in\nthe last several hours of the NuSTAR observation, when the spectral shape\napproached those seen in 2012 and 2016 October 9--11. The spectra obtained in\nour observations and in 2012 can be commonly described with disk emission and\nits Comptonization in cool ($T_{\\rm e} \\approx 4$ keV), optically-thick ($\\tau\n\\approx 5$) plasma. The spectral turnover seen at around 5--10 keV shifts to\nhigher energies as the X-ray luminosity decreases. This behavior is consistent\nwith that predicted from recent numerical simulations of super-Eddington\naccretion flows with Compton-thick outflows. We suggest that the spectral\nevolution observed in IC 342 X-1 can be explained by a smooth change in mass\naccretion rate.\n", "  The large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations of solar filaments have been\nobserved and explored for more than ten years. Previous studies are mainly\nbased on the one-dimensional rigid flux tube model with a single magnetic dip.\nHowever, it is noticed that there might be two magnetic dips, and hence two\nthreads, along one magnetic field line. Following the previous work, we intend\nto investigate the kinematics of the filament longitudinal oscillations when\ntwo threads are magnetically connected, which is done by solving\none-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic equations with the numerical code\nMPI-AMRVAC. Two different types of perturbations are considered, and the\ndifference from previous works resulting from the filament thread-thread\ninteraction is investigated. We find that even with the inclusion of the\nthread-thread interaction, the oscillation period is modified weakly, by at\nmost 20% compared to the traditional pendulum model with one thread. However,\nthe damping timescale is significantly affected by the thread-thread\ninteraction. Hence, we should take it into account when applying the consistent\nseismology to the filaments where two threads are magnetically connected.\n", "  We have detected [C I] 3P1-3P0 emissions in the gaseous debris disks of 49\nCeti and Beta Pictoris with the 10 m telescope of the Atacama Submillimeter\nTelescope Experiment, which is the first detection of such emissions. The line\nprofiles of [C I] are found to resemble those of CO(J=3-2) observed with the\nsame telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This\nresult suggests that atomic carbon (C) coexists with CO in the debris disks,\nand is likely formed by the photodissociation of CO. Assuming an optically thin\n[C I] emission with the excitation temperature ranging from 30 to 100 K, the\ncolumn density of C is evaluated to be (2.2+-0.2)x10^17 and (2.5+-0.7)x10^16\ncm^-2 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris, respectively. The C/CO column density\nratio is thus derived to be 54+-19 and 69+-42 for 49 Ceti and Beta Pictoris,\nrespectively. These ratios are higher than those of molecular clouds and\ndiffuse clouds by an order of magnitude. The unusually high ratios of C to CO\nare likely attributed to a lack of H2 molecules needed to reproduce CO\nmolecules efficiently from C. This result implies a small number of H2\nmolecules in the gas disk; i.e., there is an appreciable contribution of\nsecondary gas from dust grains.\n", "  We report the first detection of sodium absorption in the atmosphere of the\nhot Jupiter WASP-52b. We observed one transit of WASP-52b with the\nlow-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution\nIntegrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC).\nThe resulting transmission spectrum, covering the wavelength range from 522 nm\nto 903 nm, is flat and featureless, except for the significant narrow\nabsorption signature at the sodium doublet, which can be explained by an\natmosphere in solar composition with clouds at 1 mbar. A cloud-free atmosphere\nis stringently ruled out. By assessing the absorption depths of sodium in\nvarious bin widths, we find that temperature increases towards lower\natmospheric pressure levels, with a positive temperature gradient of 0.88 +/-\n0.65 K/km, possibly indicative of upper atmospheric heating and a temperature\ninversion.\n", "  High-resolution ground-based images of the T Tauri star LkCa 15 have revealed\nmultiple companions that are thought to comprise a formative planetary system.\nThe candidate protoplanets orbit at distances ~15 - 20 AU within the\ndust-depleted inner region of the circumstellar disk. Because of its young age\n(1 - 4 Myr), LkCa 15 provides a benchmark system for testing planet-formation\nmodels. We detected LkCa 15 as a bright X-ray source in a short 10 ks Chandra\nobservation in 2009. We report here new results obtained from a deeper 37 ks\nXMM-Newton observation in 2014. The new data provide better sampling in the\ntime domain and improved sensitivity at low energies below 1 keV. Spectral fits\nwith thermal emission models require at least two temperature components at\nkT_cool ~ 0.4 keV and kT_hot ~ 2.2 keV. The value of kT_hot is about a factor\nof two less than inferred from Chandra, suggesting that the hot-component\ntemperature is variable. The best-fit absorption column density is in good\nagreement with that expected from optical extinction estimates A_v = 1.3 - 1.7\nmag. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity is L_x(0.2 - 10 keV) = 3e30 ergs/s.\nEstimates of the X-ray heating rate of the inner disk and protoplanets are\nsensitive to the assumed disk gas surface density for which recent ALMA\nobservations give estimates Sigma_0(gas) ~ 100 g/cm^2 at 1 AU from the star. At\nsuch densities, X-ray heating is confined mainly to the upper disk layers and\nX-ray penetration through the disk midplane to the protoplanets at r ~ 15 - 20\nAU is negligible.\n", "  The gas giant planets in the Solar System have a retinue of icy moons, and we\nexpect giant exoplanets to have similar satellite systems. If a Jupiter-like\nplanet were to migrate toward its parent star the icy moons orbiting it would\nevaporate, creating atmospheres and possible habitable surface oceans. Here, we\nexamine how long the surface ice and possible oceans would last before being\nhydrodynamically lost to space. The hydrodynamic loss rate from the moons is\ndetermined, in large part, by the stellar flux available for absorption, which\nincreases as the giant planet and icy moons migrate closer to the star. At some\nplanet-star distance the stellar flux incident on the icy moons becomes so\ngreat that they enter a runaway greenhouse state. This runaway greenhouse state\nrapidly transfers all available surface water to the atmosphere as vapor, where\nit is easily lost from the small moons. However, for icy moons of Ganymede's\nsize around a Sun-like star we found that surface water (either ice or liquid)\ncan persist indefinitely outside the runaway greenhouse orbital distance. In\ncontrast, the surface water on smaller moons of Europa's size will only persist\non timescales greater than 1 Gyr at distances ranging 1.49 to 0.74 AU around a\nSun-like star for Bond albedos of 0.2 and 0.8, where the lower albedo becomes\nrelevant if ice melts. Consequently, small moons can lose their icy shells,\nwhich would create a torus of H atoms around their host planet that might be\ndetectable in future observations.\n", "  Dormant or near-dormant short-period comets can unexpectedly regain ability\nto eject dust. In many known cases, the resurrection is short-lived and lasts\nless than one orbit. However, it is possible that some resurrected comets can\nremain active in latter perihelion passages. We search the archival images of\nvarious facilities to look for these \"reactivated\" comets. We identify two\ncandidates, 297P/Beshore and 332P/Ikeya-Murakami, both of which were found to\nbe inactive or weakly active in the previous orbit before their discovery. We\nderive a reactivation rate of\n$\\sim0.007~\\mathrm{comet}^{-1}~\\mathrm{orbit}^{-1}$, which implies that typical\nshort-period comets only become temporary dormant for less than a few times.\nSmaller comets are prone to rotational instability and may undergo temporary\ndormancy more frequently. Next generation high-cadence surveys may find more\nreactivation events of these comets.\n", "  New CCD photometry of seven successive years from 2010 is presented for the\nHW Vir-type eclipsing binary 2M 1533+3759. Using the $VI$ light curves together\nwith the radial-velocity data given by For et al. (2010), we determined the\nabsolute parameters of each component to be $M_1$ = 0.442$\\pm$0.012 M$_\\odot$,\n$M_2$ = 0.124$\\pm$0.005 M$_\\odot$, $R_1$ = 0.172$\\pm$0.002 R$_\\odot$, $R_2$ =\n0.157$\\pm$0.002 R$_\\odot$, $L_1$ = 19.4$\\pm$1.4 L$_\\odot$, and $L_2$ =\n0.002$\\pm$0.002 L$_\\odot$. These indicate that 2M 1533+3759 is a detached\nsystem consisting of a normal sdB primary and an M7 dwarf companion. Detailed\nanalyses of 377 minimum epochs, including our 111 timings, showed that the\norbital period of the system remains constant during the past 12 yrs.\nInspecting both types of minima, we found a delay of 3.9$\\pm$1.0 s in the\narrival times of the secondary eclipses relative to the primary eclipse times.\nThis delay is in satisfactory agreement with the predicted R{\\o}mer delay of\n2.7$\\pm$1.4 s and the result is the second measurement in sdB+M eclipsing\nbinaries. The time shift of the secondary eclipse can be explained by some\ncombination of the R{\\o}mer delay and a non-zero eccentricity. Then, the binary\nstar would have a very small eccentricity of $e \\cos {\\omega} \\simeq$ 0.0001.\n", "  We present the first discoveries from a survey of $z\\gtrsim6$ quasars using\nimaging data from the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in the optical, the UKIRT\nDeep Infrared Sky Survey (UKIDSS) and a preliminary version of the UKIRT\nHemisphere Survey (UHS) in the near-IR, and ALLWISE in the mid-IR. DECaLS will\nimage 9000 deg$^2$ of sky down to $z_{\\rm AB}\\sim23.0$, and UKIDSS and UHS,\nwhich will map the northern sky at $0<DEC<+60^{\\circ}$, reaching $J_{\\rm\nVEGA}\\sim19.6$ (5-$\\sigma$). The combination of these datasets allows us to\ndiscover quasars at redshift $z\\gtrsim7$ and to conduct a complete census of\nthe faint quasar population at $z\\gtrsim6$. In this paper, we report on the\nselection method of our search, and on the initial discoveries of two new,\nfaint $z\\gtrsim6$ quasars and one new $z=6.63$ quasar in our pilot\nspectroscopic observations. The two new $z\\sim6$ quasars are at $z=6.07$ and\n$z=6.17$ with absolute magnitudes at rest-frame wavelength 1450 \\AA\\ being\n$M_{1450}=-25.83$ and $M_{1450}=-25.76$, respectively. These discoveries\nsuggest that we can find quasars close to or fainter than the break magnitude\nof the Quasar Luminosity Function (QLF) at $z\\gtrsim6$. The new $z=6.63$ quasar\nhas an absolute magnitude of $M_{1450}=-25.95$. This demonstrates the potential\nof using the combined DECaLS and UKIDSS/UHS datasets to find $z\\gtrsim7$\nquasars. Extrapolating from previous QLF measurements, we predict that these\ncombined datasets will yield $\\sim200$ $z\\sim6$ quasars to $z_{\\rm AB} < 21.5$,\n$\\sim1{,}000$ $z\\sim6$ quasars to $z_{\\rm AB}<23$, and $\\sim 30$ quasars at\n$z>6.5$ to $J_{\\rm VEGA}<19.5$.\n", "  X-ray and gamma-ray polarimetry is a promising tool to study the geometry and\nthe magnetic configuration of various celestial objects, such as binary black\nholes or gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, statistically significant\npolarizations have been detected in few of the brightest objects. Even though\nfuture polarimeters using X-ray telescopes are expected to observe weak\npersistent sources, there are no effective approaches to survey transient and\nserendipitous sources with a wide field of view (FoV). Here we present an\nelectron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC) as a highly-sensitive gamma-ray imaging\npolarimeter. The ETCC provides powerful background rejection and a high\nmodulation factor over a FoV of up to 2$\\pi$ sr thanks to its excellent imaging\nbased on a well-defined point spread function. Importantly, we demonstrated for\nthe first time the stability of the modulation factor under realistic\nconditions of off-axis incidence and huge backgrounds using the SPring-8\npolarized X-ray beam. The measured modulation factor of the ETCC was 0.65 $\\pm$\n0.01 at 150 keV for an off-axis incidence with an oblique angle of 30$^\\circ$\nand was not degraded compared to the 0.58 $\\pm$ 0.02 at 130 keV for on-axis\nincidence. These measured results are consistent with the simulation results.\nConsequently, we found that the satellite-ETCC proposed in Tanimori et al.\n(2015) would provide all-sky surveys of weak persistent sources of 13 mCrab\nwith 10% polarization for a 10$^{7}$ s exposure and over 20 GRBs down to a\n$6\\times10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ fluence and 10% polarization during a one-year\nobservation.\n", "  The two most common techniques for measuring planetary masses - the radial\nvelocity (RV) and the transit timing variations (TTVs) techniques - have been\nobserved to yield systematically different masses for planets of similar radii.\nFollowing Steffen (2016), we consider the effects of the observational biases\nof the two methods as a possible cause for this difference. We find that at\nshort orbital periods ($P<11$ day), the two methods produce statistically\nsimilar results, whereas at long periods ($P>11$ day) the RV masses are\nsystematically higher than the TTV ones. We suggest that this is consistent\nwith an RV detection-sensitivity bias for longer periods. On the other hand, we\ndo find an apparently significant difference between the short and the\nlong-period planets, obtained by both observing techniques-the mass-radius\nrelationship parameterized as a power law has a steeper index at short periods\nthan at long periods. We also point out another anticipated observational bias\nbetween the two techniques - multiple planet systems with derived RV masses\nhave substantially larger period ratios than the systems with TTV mass\nderivation.\n", "  It is often assumed that gravitational wave (GW) events resulting from the\nmerger of stellar-mass black holes are unlikely to produce electromagnetic (EM)\ncounterparts. We point out that the progenitor binary has probably shed a mass\n$\\gtrsim 10\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ during its prior evolution. If a tiny fraction of\nthis gas is retained until the merger, the recoil and sudden mass loss of the\nmerged black hole shocks and heats it within hours of the GW event. Whether\nresulting EM emission is detectable is uncertain. The optical depth through the\ndisk is likely to be high enough that the prompt emission consists only of\nphotons from its optically thin skin, while the majority may take years to\nemerge. However, if some mechanism can release more photons in a time\ncomparable to the few-hour energy production time, the peak luminosity of the\nEM signal could be detectable. For a disk retaining only $\\sim 10^{-3}$ of the\nmass shed in the earlier binary evolution, medium-energy X-rays to infrared\nemission would be observable hours after the GW event for source distances\n$\\sim 500\\,\\rm{Mpc}$. Events like this may already have been observed, but\nascribed to unidentified active galactic nuclei. Improved sky-localization\nshould eventually allow identification based on spatial coincidence. A\ndetection would provide unique constraints on formation scenarios and\npotentially offer tests of strong-field general relativity. Accordingly we\nargue that the high scientific payoff of an EM detection fully justifies search\ncampaigns.\n", "  We address the physical nature of subdwarf A-type (sdA) stars and their\npossible link to extremely low mass (ELM) white dwarfs (WDs). The two classes\nof objects are confused in low-resolution spectroscopy. However, colors and\nproper motions indicate that sdA stars are cooler and more luminous, and thus\nlarger in radius, than published ELM WDs. We demonstrate that surface gravities\nderived from pure hydrogen models suffer a systematic ~1 dex error for sdA\nstars, likely explained by metal line blanketing below 9000 K. A detailed study\nof five eclipsing binaries with radial velocity orbital solutions and infrared\nexcess establishes that these sdA stars are metal-poor ~1.2 Msun main sequence\nstars with ~0.8 Msun companions. While WDs must exist at sdA temperatures, only\n~1% of a magnitude-limited sdA sample should be ELM WDs. We conclude that the\nmajority of sdA stars are metal-poor A-F type stars in the halo, and that\nrecently discovered pulsating ELM WD-like stars with no obvious radial velocity\nvariations may be SX Phe variables, not pulsating WDs.\n", "  Recent years have seen growing interest in the streaming instability as a\ncandidate mechanism to produce planetesimals. However, these investigations\nhave been limited to small-scale simulations. We now present the results of a\nglobal protoplanetary disk evolution model that incorporates planetesimal\nformation by the streaming instability, along with viscous accretion,\nphotoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-ray photons, dust evolution, the water ice\nline, and stratified turbulence. Our simulations produce massive (60-130\n$M_\\oplus$) planetesimal belts beyond 100 au and up to $\\sim 20 M_\\oplus$ of\nplanetesimals in the middle regions (3-100 au). Our most comprehensive model\nforms 8 $M_\\oplus$ of planetesimals inside 3 au, where they can give rise to\nterrestrial planets. The planetesimal mass formed in the inner disk depends\ncritically on the timing of the formation of an inner cavity in the disk by\nhigh-energy photons. Our results show that the combination of photoevaporation\nand the streaming instability are efficient at converting the solid component\nof protoplanetary disks into planetesimals. Our model, however, does not form\nenough early planetesimals in the inner and middle regions of the disk to give\nrise to giant planets and super-Earths with gaseous envelopes. Additional\nprocesses such as particle pileups and mass loss driven by MHD winds may be\nneeded to drive the formation of early planetesimal generations in the planet\nforming regions of protoplanetary disks.\n", "  As part of the Fornax Deep Survey with the ESO VLT Survey Telescope, we\npresent new $g$ and $r$ bands mosaics of the SW group of the Fornax cluster. It\ncovers an area of $3 \\times 2$ square degrees around the central galaxy\nNGC1316. The deep photometry, the high spatial resolution of OmegaCam and the\nlarge covered area allow us to study the galaxy structure, to trace stellar\nhalo formation and look at the galaxy environment. We map the surface\nbrightness profile out to 33arcmin ($\\sim 200$kpc $\\sim15R_e$) from the galaxy\ncentre, down to $\\mu_g \\sim 31$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $\\mu_r \\sim 29$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$. This allow us to estimate the scales of the main components\ndominating the light distribution, which are the central spheroid, inside 5.5\narcmin ($\\sim33$ kpc), and the outer stellar envelope. Data analysis suggests\nthat we are catching in act the second phase of the mass assembly in this\ngalaxy, since the accretion of smaller satellites is going on in both\ncomponents. The outer envelope of NGC1316 still hosts the remnants of the\naccreted satellite galaxies that are forming the stellar halo. We discuss the\npossible formation scenarios for NGC1316, by comparing the observed properties\n(morphology, colors, gas content, kinematics and dynamics) with predictions\nfrom cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. We find that {\\it i)} the\ncentral spheroid could result from at least one merging event, it could be a\npre-existing early-type disk galaxy with a lower mass companion, and {\\it ii)}\nthe stellar envelope comes from the gradual accretion of small satellites.\n", "  Periodic structures of phases with orientational order of molecules, but\nhomogenous electron density distribution: a short pitch cholesteric, blue phase\nand twist-bend nematic phase, were probed by a resonant soft x-ray scattering\n(RSoXS) at the carbon K-edge. The theoretical model shows that in case of a\nsimple heliconical nematic structure two resonant signals corresponding to the\nfull and half pitch band should be present, while only the full pitch band is\nobserved in experiment. This suggests that the twist-bend nematic phase has\ncomplex structure with a double-helix, built of two interlocked, shifted\nhelices. We confirm that the helical pitch in the twist-bend nematic phase is\nin a 10 nm range, for both, the chiral and achiral materials. We also show that\nthe symmetry of a blue phase can unambiguously be determined through a resonant\nenhancement of x-ray diffraction signals, by including polarization effects,\nwhich are found to be an important indicator in phase structure determination.\n", "  A potential threat to the performance of magnetically confined fusion plasmas\nis the problem of impurity accumulation, which causes the concentration of\nhighly charged impurity ions to rise uncontrollably in the center of the plasma\nand spoil the energy confinement by excessive radiation. It has long been\nthought that the collisional transport of impurities in stellarators always\nleads to such accumulation (if the electric field points inwards, which is\nusually the case), whereas tokamaks, being axisymmetric, can benefit from\n\"temperature screening\", i.e., an outward flux of impurities driven by the\ntemperature gradient. Here it is shown, using analytical techniques supported\nby results from a new numerical code, that such screening can arise in\nstellarator plasmas too, and indeed does so in one of the most relevant\noperating regimes, where the impurities are highly collisional whilst the bulk\nplasma is in any of the low-collisionality regimes.\n", "  Could there be intermediate mass black holes in essentially all old dwarf\ngalaxies? I argue that current observations of Active Galactic Nuclei in dwarfs\nallow such a radical hypothesis which provides early feedback and potentially\nprovides a unifying explanation for many if not all of the apparent dwarf\ngalaxy anomalies, such as the abundance, core-cusp, \"too big to fail\",\nultra-faint and baryon-fraction issues. I describe the supporting arguments,\nwhich are largely circumstantial in nature, and discuss a number of tests.\nThere is no strong motivation for modifying the nature of cold dark matter in\norder to explain any of the dwarf galaxy \"problems\".\n", "  We examine how shell geometry affects fracture. As suggested by previous\nresults and our own phase-field simulations, shell shape dramatically affects\ncrack evolution and the effective toughness of the shell structure. To gain\ninsight and eventually develop new concepts for optimizing the design of thin\nshell structures, we derive the configurational force conjugate to crack\nextension for Koiter's linear thin shell theory. We identify the conservative\ncontribution to this force through an Eshelby tensor, as well as\nnon-conservative contributions arising from curvature.\n", "  The phase dependence of the cavity quantum dynamics in a driven equidistant\nthree-level ladder-type system found in a quantum well structure with\nperpendicular transition dipoles is investigated in the good cavity limit. The\npumping laser phases are directly transferred to the superposed amplitudes of\nthe cavity-quantum-well interaction. Their phase difference may be tuned in\norder to obtain destructive quantum interferences. Therefore, the cavity field\nvanishes although the emitter continues to be pumped.\n", "  The galactocentric distance of quasar absorption outflows are conventionally\ndetermined using absorption troughs from excited states, a method hindered by\nseverely saturated or self-blended absorption troughs. We propose a novel\nmethod to estimate the size of a broad absorption line (BAL) region which\npartly obscures an emission line region by assuming virialized gas in the\nemission region surrounding a supermassive black hole with known mass. When a\nspiky Lya1216 line emission is present at the flat bottom of the deep Nv1240\nabsorption trough, the size of BAL region can be estimated. We have found 3 BAL\nquasars in the SDSS database showing such Lya lines. The scale of their BAL\noutflows are found to be 3-26 pc, moderately larger than the theoretical scale\n(0.01-0.1 pc) of trough forming regions for winds originating from accretion\ndiscs, but significantly smaller than most outflow sizes derived using the\nabsorption troughs of the excited states of ions. For these three outflows, the\nlower limits of ratio of kinetic luminosity to Eddington luminosity are\n0.02%-0.07%. These lower limits are substantially smaller than that is required\nto have significant feedback effect on their host galaxies.\n", "  We derive a new analytical model for the evolution of a collisional cascade\nin a thin annulus around a single central star. In this model, $r_{max}~$ the\nsize of the largest object declines with time (t); $r_{max} \\propto\nt^{-\\gamma}$, with $\\gamma$ = 0.1-0.2. Compared to standard models where\n$r_{max}~$ is constant in time, this evolution results in a more rapid decline\nof $M_d$, the total mass of solids in the annulus and $L_d$, the luminosity of\nsmall particles in the annulus: $M_d \\propto t^{-(\\gamma + 1)}~$ and $L_d\n\\propto t^{-(\\gamma/2 + 1)}~~$. We demonstrate that the analytical model\nprovides an excellent match to a comprehensive suite of numerical coagulation\nsimulations for annuli at 1 AU and at 25 AU. If the evolution of real debris\ndisks follows the predictions of the analytical or numerical models, the\nobserved luminosities for evolved stars require up to a factor of two more mass\nthan predicted by previous analytical models.\n", "  We review some recent developments in Chern-Simons theory on a hyperbolic\n3-manifold $M$ with complex gauge group $G$. We focus on the case\n$G=SL(N,\\mathbb{C})$ and with $M$ a knot complement. The main result presented\nin this note is the cluster partition function, a computational tool that uses\ncluster algebra techniques to evaluate the Chern-Simons path integral. We also\nreview various applications and open questions regarding the cluster partition\nfunction and some of its relation with string theory.\n", "  We report the discovery and analysis of PTF1 J085713+331843, a new eclipsing\npost common-envelope detached white-dwarf red-dwarf binary with a 2.5h orbital\nperiod discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory. ULTRACAM multicolour\nphotometry over multiple orbital periods reveals a light curve with a deep\nflat-bottomed primary eclipse and a strong reflection effect. Phase-resolved\nspectroscopy shows broad Balmer absorption lines from the DA white dwarf and\nphase-dependent Balmer emission lines originating on the irradiated side of the\nred dwarf. The temperature of the DA white dwarf is $T_\\mathrm{WD} = 25700 \\pm\n400\\,$K and the spectral type of the red dwarf is M3-5. A combined modelling of\nthe light curve and the radial velocity variations results in a white dwarf\nmass of $M_\\mathrm{WD} = 0.61^{+0.18}_{-0.17}\\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and radius\nof $R_\\mathrm{WD} = 0.0175^{+0.0012}_{-0.0011}\\, \\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$, and a red\ndwarf mass and radius of $M_\\mathrm{RD} = 0.19^{+0.10}_{-0.08}\\,\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and $R_\\mathrm{RD} = 0.24^{+0.04}_{-0.04}\\,\n\\mathrm{R_{\\odot}}$. The system is either a detached cataclysmic variable or\nhas emerged like from the common envelope phase at nearly its current orbital\nperiod. In $\\sim70\\,$Myr, this system will become a cataclysmic variable in the\nperiod gap.\n", "  Reichenbach defined a common cause which explains a correlation between two\nevents if either one does not cause the other. Its intuitive idea is that the\nstatistical ensemble can be divided into two disjoint parts so that the\ncorrelation disappears in both of the resulting subensembles if there is no\ncausal connection between these correlated events. These subensembles can be\nregarded as common causes. Hofer-Szab\\'{o} and R\\'{e}dei (2004) generalized a\nReichenbachian common cause, and called it a Reichenbachian common cause\nsystem. In the case of Reichenbachian common cause systems the statistical\nensemble is divided more than two, while it is divided into two parts in the\ncase of Reichenbachian common causes. The number of these subensembles is\ncalled the size of this system. In the present paper, we examine Reichenbachian\ncommon cause systems in general probability theories which include classical\nprobability theories and quantum probability theories. It is shown that there\nis no Reichenbachian common cause system for any correlation between two events\nwhich are not logical independent, and that a general probability theory which\nis represented by an atomless orthomodular lattice with a faithful\n$\\sigma$-additive probability measure contains Reichenbachian common cause\nsystems of size 3 for any correlation between two compatible and logical\nindependent events. Moreover, we discuss a relation between Bell's inequality\nand Reichenbachian common cause systems, and point out that this violation of\nBell's inequality can be compatible with a Reichenbachian common cause system\nalthough it contradicts a `common' common cause system.\n", "  Very recently, the CMS collaboration has reported a search for the production\nfor a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson in association with a top quark pair ($t\nbar{t} H$) at the LHC Run-2 and a best fit $t bar{t} H$ yield of $1.5 pm 0.5$\ntimes the SM prediction with an observed significance of $3.3 sigma$. We study\na possibility of whether or not this observed deviation can be explained by\nanomalous Higgs Yukawa couplings with the top and the bottom quarks, along with\nthe LHC Run-1 data for the Higgs boson properties. We find that anomalous top\nand bottom Yukawa couplings with about $0-20$% and $10-40$% reductions from\ntheir SM values, respectively, can simultaneously fit the recent CMS result and\nthe LHC Run-1 data.\n", "  Riemannian and Absolute Parallelism (AP) geometries are discussed. A lavish\ntreatment of path equations in the AP-space using the Bazanski-type Lagrangian\nis presented; We write down an expression that is absolutely conserved along a\ncurve in the AP-space and show that it gives the same path equations as\nobtained using the conventional Lagrangian formalism. We attribute physical\ninterpretations to the resultant path equations and we show that the\nspin-torsion interaction is an inherent property of the AP-space.\n", "  With several short-period, Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone, the\nTRAPPIST-1 system potentially allows litho-panspermia to take place on very\nshort timescales. We investigate the efficiency and speed of inter-planetary\nmaterial transfer resulting from impacts onto the habitable zone planets. By\nsimulating trajectories of impact ejecta from their moment of ejection until\n(re-)accretion, we find that transport between the habitable zone planets is\nfastest for ejection velocities around and just above planetary escape\nvelocity. At these ejection velocities, ${\\sim}10\\%$ of the ejected material\nreaches another habitable zone planet within $10^2\\mathrm{~yr}$, indicating\nlitho-panspermia can be 4 to 5 orders of magnitude faster in TRAPPIST-1 than in\nthe Solar System.\n", "  One of the primary surprises of exoplanet detections has been the discovery\nof compact planetary systems, whereby numerous planets reside within ~0.5 AU of\nthe host star. Many of these kinds of systems have been discovered in recent\nyears, indicating that they are fairly common orbital architecture. Of\nparticular interest are those systems for which the host star is low-mass, thus\npotentially enabling one or more of the planets to lie within the Habitable\nZone of the host star. One of the contributors to the habitability of the Earth\nis the presence of a substantial moon whose tidal effects can stabilize axial\ntilt variations and increase the rate of tidal pool formation. Here we explore\nthe constraints on the presence of moons for planets in compact systems based\non Hill radii and Roche limit considerations. We apply these constraints to the\nTRAPPIST-1 system and demonstrate that most of the planets are very likely to\nbe worlds without moons.\n", "  Recent space missions have provided information on the physical and chemical\nproperties of interstellar grains such as the ratio $\\beta$ of radiation\npressure to gravity acting on the grains in addition to the composition,\nstructure, and size distribution of the grains. Numerical simulation on the\ntrajectories of interstellar grains captured by Stardust and returned to Earth\nconstrained the $\\beta$ ratio for the Stardust samples of interstellar origin.\nHowever, recent accurate calculations of radiation pressure cross sections for\nmodel dust grains have given conflicting stories in the $\\beta$ ratio of\ninterstellar grains. The $\\beta$ ratio for model dust grains of so-called\n\"astronomical silicate\" in the femto-kilogram range lies below unity, in\nconflict with $\\beta \\sim 1$ for the Stardust interstellar grains. Here, I\ntackle this conundrum by re-evaluating the $\\beta$ ratio of interstellar grains\non the assumption that the grains are aggregated particles grown by coagulation\nand composed of amorphous MgSiO$_{3}$ with the inclusion of metallic iron. My\nmodel is entirely consistent with the depletion and the correlation of major\nrock-forming elements in the Local Interstellar Cloud surrounding the Sun and\nthe mineralogical identification of interstellar grains in the Stardust and\nCassini missions. I find that my model dust particles fulfill the constraints\non the $\\beta$ ratio derived from not only the Stardust mission but also the\nUlysses and Cassini missions. My results suggest that iron is not incorporated\ninto silicates but exists as metal, contrary to the majority of interstellar\ndust models available to date.\n", "  This paper examines the properties of flows around objects embedded within\ncommon envelopes in the simplified context of a \"wind tunnel.\" We establish\ncharacteristic relationships between key common envelope flow parameters like\nthe Mach number and density scale height. Our wind tunnel is a\nthree-dimensional, cartesian geometry hydrodynamic simulation setup that\nincludes the gravity of the primary and secondary stars and allows us to study\nthe coefficients of drag and accretion experienced by the embedded object.\nAccretion and drag lead to a transformation of an embedded object and its orbit\nduring a common envelope phase. We present two suites of simulations spanning a\nrange of density gradients and Mach numbers -- relevant for flow near the limb\nof a stellar envelope to the deep interior. In one suite, we adopt an ideal gas\nadiabatic exponent of $\\gamma=5/3$, in the other, $\\gamma=4/3$. We find that\ncoefficients of drag rise in flows with steeper density gradients and that\ncoefficients of drag and accretion are consistently higher in the more\ncompressible, $\\gamma=4/3$ flow. We illustrate the impact of these newly\nderived coefficients by integrating the inspiral of a secondary object through\nthe envelopes of $3M_\\odot$ ($\\gamma\\approx5/3$) and $80M_\\odot$\n($\\gamma\\approx4/3$) giants. In these examples, we find a relatively rapid\ninitial inspiral because, near the stellar limb, dynamical friction drag is\ngenerated mainly from dense gas focussed from deeper within the primary-star's\nenvelope. This rapid initial inspiral timescale carries potential implications\nfor the timescale of transients from early common envelope interaction.\n", "  It is shown that using the similarity transformations, a set of\nthree-dimensional p-q nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations with inhomogeneous\ncoefficients can be reduced to one-dimensional stationary NLS equation with\nconstant or varying coefficients, thus allowing for obtaining exact localized\nand periodic wave solutions. In the suggested reduction the original\ncoordinates in the (1+3)-space are mapped into a set of one-parametric\ncoordinate surfaces, whose parameter plays the role of the coordinate of the\none-dimensional equation. We describe the algorithm of finding solutions and\nconcentrate on power (linear and nonlinear) potentials presenting a number of\ncase examples. Generalizations of the method are also discussed.\n", "  We study exact solutions of the quasi-one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequation with the (space, time)-modulated potential and nonlinearity and the\ntime-dependent gain or loss term in Bose-Einstein condensates. In particular,\nbased on the similarity transformation, we report several families of exact\nsolutions of the GP equation in the combination of the harmonic and Gaussian\npotentials, in which some physically relevant solutions are described. The\nstability of the obtained matter-wave solutions is addressed numerically such\nthat some stable solutions are found. Moreover, we also analyze the parameter\nregimes for the stable solutions. These results may raise the possibility of\nrelative experiments and potential applications.\n", "  The integrable nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NNLS) equation with the\nself-induced parity-time-symmetric potential [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 (2013)\n064105] is investigated, which is an integrable extension of the standard NLS\nequation. Its novel higher-order rational solitons are found using the nonlocal\nversion of the generalized perturbation (1, N-1)-fold Darboux transformation.\nThese rational solitons illustrate abundant wave structures for the distinct\nchoices of parameters (e.g., the strong and weak interactions of bright and\ndark rational solitons). Moreover, we also explore the dynamical behaviors of\nthese higher-order rational solitons with some small noises on the basis of\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  In this paper, a simple and constructive method is presented to find the\ngeneralized perturbation (n,M)-fold Darboux transformations (DTs) of the\nmodified nonlinear Schrodinger (MNLS) equation in terms of fractional forms of\ndeterminants. In particular, we apply the generalized perturbation (1,N-1)-fold\nDTs to find its explicit multi-rogue-wave solutions. The wave structures of\nthese rogue-wave solutions of the MNLS equation are discussed in detail for\ndifferent parameters, which display abundant interesting wave structures,\nincluding the triangle and pentagon, etc. and may be useful to study the\nphysical mechanism of multirogue waves in optics. The dynamical behaviors of\nthese multi-rogue-wave solutions are illustrated using numerical simulations.\nThe same Darboux matrix can also be used to investigate the Gerjikov-Ivanov\nequation such that its multi-rogue-wave solutions and their wave structures are\nalso found. The method can also be extended to find multi-rogue-wave solutions\nof other nonlinear integrable equations.\n", "  The effect of derivative nonlinearity and parity-time- (PT-) symmetric\npotentials on the wave propagation dynamics is investigated in the derivative\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation, where the physically interesting Scarff-II and\nhamonic-Hermite-Gaussian potentials are chosen. We study numerically the\nregions of unbroken/broken linear PT-symmetric phases and find some stable\nbright solitons of this model in a wide range of potential parameters even\nthough the corresponding linear PT-symmetric phases are broken. The\nsemi-elastic interactions between exact bright solitons and exotic incident\nwaves are illustrated such that we find that exact nonlinear modes almost keep\ntheir shapes after interactions even if the exotic incident waves have\nevidently been changed. Moreover, we exert the adiabatic switching on\nPT-symmetric potential parameters such that a stable nonlinear mode with the\nunbroken linear PT-symmetric phase can be excited to another stable nonlinear\nmode belonging to the broken linear PT-symmetric phase.\n", "  A spectacular manifestation of solar activity is the appearance of transient\nbrightenings in the far wings of the H$\\alpha$ line, known as Ellerman bombs\n(EBs). Recent observations obtained by the Interface Region Imaging\nSpectrograph (IRIS) have revealed another type of plasma \"bombs\" (UV bursts)\nwith high temperatures of perhaps up to $8\\times 10^4$ K within the cooler\nlower solar atmosphere. Realistic numerical modeling showing such events is\nneeded to explain their nature. Here, we report on 3D radiative\nmagneto-hydrodynamic simulations of magnetic flux emergence in the solar\natmosphere. We find that ubiquitous reconnection between emerging bipolar\nmagnetic fields can trigger EBs in the photosphere, UV bursts in the mid/low\nchromosphere and small (nano-/micro-) flares ($10^6$ K) in the upper\nchromosphere. These results provide new insights on the emergence and build up\nof the coronal magnetic field and the dynamics and heating of the solar surface\nand lower atmosphere.\n", "  We report the bright solitons of the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequation with some types of physically relevant parity-time-(PT-) and\nnon-PT-symmetric potentials. We find that the constant momentum coefficient can\nmodulate the linear stability and complicated transverse power-flows (not\nalways from the gain toward loss) of nonlinear modes. However, the varying\nmomentum coefficient Gamma(x) can modulate both unbroken linear PT-symmetric\nphases and stability of nonlinear modes. Particularly, the nonlinearity can\nexcite the unstable linear mode (i.e., broken linear PT-symmetric phase) to\nstable nonlinear modes. Moreover, we also find stable bright solitons in the\npresence of non-PT-symmetric harmonic-Gaussian potential. The interactions of\ntwo bright solitons are also illustrated in PT-symmetric potentials. Finally,\nwe consider nonlinear modes and transverse power-flows in the three-dimensional\n(3D) GP equation with the generalized PT-symmetric Scarf-II potential\n", "  Galileo's support to the Copernican theory was decisive for the revolutionary\nastronomical discoveries he achieved in 1610. We trace the origins of Galileo's\nconversion to the Copernican theory, discussing in particular the \"Dialogo de\nCecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de La Stella Nuova\". Later\ndevelopments of Galileo's works are briefly treated.\n", "  There is a thin transition region (TR) in the solar atmosphere where the\ntemperature rises from 10,000 K in the chromosphere to millions of degrees in\nthe corona. Little is known about the mechanisms that dominate this enigmatic\nregion other than the magnetic field plays a key role. The magnetism of the TR\ncan only be detected by polarimetric measurements of a few ultraviolet (UV)\nspectral lines, the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line of neutral hydrogen at 121.6 nm (the\nstrongest line of the solar UV spectrum) being of particular interest given its\nsensitivity to the Hanle effect (the magnetic-field-induced modification of the\nscattering line polarization). We report the discovery of linear polarization\nproduced by scattering processes in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line, obtained with the\nChromospheric Lyman-Alpha Spectro-Polarimeter (CLASP) rocket experiment. The\nStokes profiles observed by CLASP in quiet regions of the solar disk show that\nthe $Q/I$ and $U/I$ linear polarization signals are of the order of 0.1 % in\nthe line core and up to a few percent in the nearby wings, and that both have\nconspicuous spatial variations with scales of $\\sim 10$ arcsec. These\nobservations help constrain theoretical models of the chromosphere-corona TR\nand extrapolations of the magnetic field from photospheric magnetograms. In\nfact, the observed spatial variation from disk to limb of polarization at the\nline core and wings already challenge the predictions from three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamical models of the upper solar chromosphere.\n", "  The success of loop quantum cosmology to resolve classical singularities of\nhomogeneous models has led to its application to the classical Schwarszchild\nblack hole interior, which takes the form of a homogeneous Kantowski-Sachs\nmodel. The first steps of this were done in pure quantum mechanical terms,\nhinting at the traversable character of the would-be classical singularity, and\nthen others were performed using effective heuristic models capturing quantum\neffects that allowed a geometrical description closer to the classical one but\navoided its singularity. However, the problem of establishing the link between\nthe quantum and effective descriptions was left open. In this work, we propose\nto fill in this gap by considering the path-integral approach to the loop\nquantization of the Kantowski-Sachs model corresponding to the Schwarzschild\nblack hole interior. We show that the transition amplitude can be expressed as\na path integration over the imaginary exponential of an effective action which\njust coincides, under some simplifying assumptions, with the heuristic one.\nAdditionally, we further explore the consequences of the effective dynamics. We\nprove first that such dynamics imply some rather simple bounds for phase-space\nvariables, and in turn, remarkably, in an analytical way, they imply that\nvarious phase-space functions that were singular in the classical model are now\nwell behaved. In particular, the expansion rate, its time derivative, and the\nshear become bounded, and hence the Raychaudhuri equation is finite term by\nterm, thus resolving the singularities of classical geodesic congruences.\nMoreover, all effective scalar polynomial invariants turn out to be bounded.\n", "  Linear and circular polarizations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been\ndetected during recent years. We adopt a simplified model to investigate GRB\npolarization characteristics in this paper. A compressed two-dimensional\nturbulent slab containing stochastic magnetic fields is considered, and jitter\nradiation can produce the linear polarization under this special magnetic field\ntopology. Turbulent Faraday rotation measure (RM) of this slab makes strong\nwavelength-dependent depolarization. The jitter photons can also scatter with\nthose magnetic clumps inside the turbulent slab, and a nonzero variance of the\nStokes parameter $V$ can be generated. Furthermore, the linearly and circularly\npolarized photons in the optical and radio bands may suffer heavy absorptions\nfrom the slab. Thus we consider the polarized jitter radiation transfer\nprocesses. Finally, we compare our model results with the optical detections of\nGRB 091018, GRB 121024A, and GRB 131030A. We suggest simultaneous observations\nof GRB multi-wavelength polarization in the future.\n", "  MOEMS Deformable Mirrors (DM) are key components for next generation\ninstruments with innovative adaptive optics systems, in existing telescopes and\nin the future ELTs. These DMs must perform at room temperature as well as in\ncryogenic and vacuum environment. Ideally, the MOEMS-DMs must be designed to\noperate in such environment. We present some major rules for designing /\noperating DMs in cryo and vacuum. We chose to use interferometry for the full\ncharacterization of these devices, including surface quality measurement in\nstatic and dynamical modes, at ambient and in vacuum/cryo. Thanks to our\nprevious set-up developments, we placed a compact cryo-vacuum chamber designed\nfor reaching 10-6 mbar and 160K, in front of our custom Michelson\ninterferometer, able to measure performances of the DM at actuator/segment\nlevel as well as whole mirror level, with a lateral resolution of 2{\\mu}m and a\nsub-nanometric z-resolution. Using this interferometric bench, we tested the\nIris AO PTT111 DM: this unique and robust design uses an array of single\ncrystalline silicon hexagonal mirrors with a pitch of 606{\\mu}m, able to move\nin tip, tilt and piston with strokes from 5 to 7{\\mu}m, and tilt angle in the\nrange of +/-5mrad. They exhibit typically an open-loop flat surface figure as\ngood as <20nm rms. A specific mount including electronic and opto-mechanical\ninterfaces has been designed for fitting in the test chamber. Segment\ndeformation, mirror shaping, open-loop operation are tested at room and cryo\ntemperature and results are compared. The device could be operated successfully\nat 160K. An additional, mainly focus-like, 500 nm deformation is measured at\n160K; we were able to recover the best flat in cryo by correcting the focus and\nlocal tip-tilts on some segments. Tests on DM with different mirror thicknesses\n(25{\\mu}m and 50{\\mu}m) and different coatings (silver and gold) are currently\nunder way.\n", "  There is generally no obvious evidence in any direct relation between photon\nblockade and atomic coherence. Here instead of only illustrating the photon\nstatistics, we show an interesting relation between the steady-state photon\nblockade and the atomic coherence by designing a weakly driven cavity QED\nsystem with a two-level atom trapped. It is shown for the first time that the\nmaximal atomic coherence has a perfect correspondence with the optimal photon\nblockade. The negative effects of the strong dissipations on photon statistics,\natomic coherence and their correspondence are also addressed. The numerical\nsimulation is also given to support all of our results.\n", "  Recently, the photon absorption attracts lots of interest and plays an\nimportant role in a variety of applications. Here, we propose a valuable scheme\nto investigate the perfect photon absorption in a hybrid atom-optomechanical\nsystem both under and beyond the low-excitation limit.\n  The perfect photon absorption persists both in the linear atomic excitation\nregime and nonlinear atomic excitation regime, below the threshold of the\noptical bistability/multistability, respectively. We also show that the optical\nnonlinearity raised by the nonlinear optomechanical interaction and nonlinear\natomic excitation can be overlap-added, there presents a perfect corresponding\nrelation between perfect photon absorption and the optical multistability\nbeyond the low-excitation limit, the optical bistability can be switched to the\noptical multistability by increasing the input intensity. The combination of\nthe perfect photon absorption and optical bistability/mutistability is useful\nfor the photon switch application. We believe that this study will provide a\npossible design of an optical switch.\n", "  We discuss a methodology to identify observation points for muongraphy of\nactive Colombian Volcanoes and it is found that only Cerro Machin can be\nstudied.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate numerical computations of turbulent wind blowing\nover group of waves that are growing in time. The numerical model adopted for\nthe turbulence model is based on differential second-moment model that was\nadopted for growing idealized waves by Drullion and Sajjadi (2014). The results\nobtained here demonstrate the formation of cat's-eye which appear\nasymmetrically over the waves within a group.\n", "  A weakly nonlinear theory has been proposed and developed for calculating the\nenergy- transfer rate to individual waves in a group. It is shown what portion\nof total energy- transfer rate, over the envelope of wave group, affects\nindividual waves in the group. From this an expression for complex phase speed\nof individual waves is calculated. It is deduced that each wave in a group does\nnot grow at the same rate. It is shown that the critical layer is no longer\nsymmetrical compared with the ideal monochromatic waves. This asymmetry causes\nthe critical layer height to be lower over the downwind part. Therefore the\npositive growth of the individual waves on the upwind part of the wave group\nexceeds the negative growth on the downwind part (which would not be true if\n$z_c$, where the mean flow $U$ is equal to the speed of the wave propagation,\nwas the same over the whole group). This leads to the critical layer group\neffect producing a net horizontal force on the waves, in addition to the\nsheltering effect. Computational simulations over a non-growing wave group is\nalso presented, which confirms the above postulation made by Sajjadi, Hunt and\nDrullion (2014) (SHD).\n", "  Quantum information theory and quantum computing are theoritical basis of\nquantum computers. Thanks to entanglement, quantum mechanical systems are\nprovisioned to realize many information processing problems faster than\nclassical counterparts. For example, Shor factorization algorithm, Grover\nsearch algorithm, quantum Fourrier transformation, etc. Entanglement, is the\ntheoretical basis providing the expected speedups. It can be view in bipartite\nor multipartite forms. In order to quantify entanglement, some measures are\ndefined. On the other hand, a general and accepted criterion, which can measure\nthe amount of entanglement of multilateral systems, has not yet been found. In\nthis work, we make a short review of recent research on the topic entanglement\nmonotones and measures with an analitical approach.\n", "  New scientific instruments are starting to generate an unprecedented amount\nof data. LOFAR, one of the Square Kilometre Array pathfinders, is already\nproducing data on a petabyte scale. The calibration of these data presents a\nhuge challenge for final users: a) extensive storage and computing resources\nare required; b) the installation and maintenance of the processing software is\nnot trivial; and c) the requirements of (experimental) calibration pipelines\nare quickly evolving. After encountering some limitations in classical\ninfrastructures, we investigated the viability of cloud infrastructures as a\nsolution. We found that the installation and operation of LOFAR data\ncalibration pipelines is not only possible, but can also be efficient in cloud\ninfrastructures. The main advantages were: (1) ease of software installation\nand maintenance, and the availability of standard APIs and tools, widely used\nin the industry; this reduces the requirement for significant manual\nintervention, which can have a highly negative impact; (2) flexibility to adapt\nthe infrastructure to the needs of the problem, especially as those demands\nchange over time; (3) on-demand consumption of (shared) resources. We found no\nsignificant impediments associated with the speed of data transfer, the use of\nexternal block storage, or the memory available. However, the availability of\nscratch storage areas of an appropriate size is critical. Finally, we\nconsidered the cost-effectiveness of a commercial cloud like Amazon Web\nServices. While it is more expensive than the operation of a large,\nfully-utilised cluster completely dedicated to LOFAR data reduction, its costs\nare competitive if the number of datasets to be analysed is not high, or if the\ncosts of maintaining the dedicated system become high. Coupled with the\nadvantages discussed above, this suggests that a cloud infrastructure may be\nfavourable for many users.\n", "  This work explores the ability of computer vision algorithms to characterise\ndark matter haloes formed in different models of structure formation. We\nproduce surface mass density maps of the most massive haloes in a suite of\neight numerical simulations, all based on the same initial conditions, but\nimplementing different models of gravity. This suite includes a standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, two variations of $f(R)$-gravity, two variations of\nSymmetron gravity and three Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati (DGP) models. We use\nthe publicly available WND-CHARM algorithm to extract 2919 image features from\neither the raw pixel intensities of the maps, or from a variety of image\ntransformations including Fourier, Wavelet, Chebyshev and Edge transformations.\nAfter discarding the most degenerate models, we achieve more than 60%\nsingle-image classification success rate in distinguishing the four different\nmodels of gravity while using a simple weighted neighbour distance (WND) to\ndefine our classification metric. This number can be increased to more than 70%\nif additional information, such as a rough estimate of the halo mass, is\nincluded. We find that the classification success steeply declines when the\nnoise level in the images is increased, but that this trend can be largely\nreduced by smoothing the noisy data. We find Zernike moments of the Fourier\ntransformation of either the raw image or its Wavelet transformation to be the\nmost descriptive feature, followed by the Gini coefficient of several\ntransformations and the Haralick and Tamura textures of the raw pixel data\neventually pre-processed by an Edge transformation. The proposed methodology is\ngeneral and does not only apply to the characterisation of modified gravity\nmodels, but can be used to classify any set of models which show variations in\nthe 2D morphology of their respective structure.\n", "  The standard treatment of quantum corrections to semiclassical electronic\nconduction assumes that charge carriers propagate many wavelengths between\nscattering events, and succeeds in explaining multiple phenomena (weak\nlocalization magnetoresistance (WLMR), universal conductance fluctuations,\nAharonov-Bohm oscillations) observed in polycrystalline metals and doped\nsemiconductors in various dimensionalities. We report apparent WLMR and\nconductance fluctuations in H$_{x}$VO$_{2}$, a poor metal (in violation of the\nMott-Ioffe-Regel limit) stabilized by the suppression of the VO$_{2}$\nmetal-insulator transition through atomic hydrogen doping. Epitaxial thin\nfilms, single-crystal nanobeams, and nanosheets show similar phenomenology,\nthough the details of the apparent WLMR seem to depend on the combined effects\nof the strain environment and presumed doping level. Self-consistent\nquantitative analysis of the WLMR is challenging given this and the high\nresistivity of the material, since the quantitative expressions for WLMR are\nderived assuming good metallicity. These observations raise the issue of how to\nassess and analyze mesoscopic quantum effects in poor metals.\n", "  The giant magnetoresistance (GMR) was investigated for electrodeposited Co/Cu\nmultilayers. In order to better understand the formation of individual layers\nand their influence on GMR, multilayers produced by two different deposition\nstrategies were compared. One series of Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayers with tCu\nranging from 0.5 nm to 6 nm was produced with the conventional two-pulse\nplating by using a galvanostatic/potentiostatic (G/P) pulse combination for the\nmagnetic/non-magnetic layer deposition, respectively, whereby the Cu layer\ndeposition was carried out at the electrochemically optimized potential.\nAnother Co(2 nm)/Cu(tCu) multilayer series with the same tCu range was prepared\nwith the help of a G/P/G pulse combination. In this latter case, first a\nbilayer of Co(2 nm)/Cu(6 nm) was deposited in each cycle as in the G/P mode\nafter which a third G pulse was applied with a small anodic current to dissolve\npart of the 6 nm thick Cu layer in order to ensure the targeted tCu value. The\ncomparison of the two series revealed that the G/P/G pulse combination yields\nmultilayers for which GMR can be obtained even at such low nominal Cu layer\nthicknesses where G/P multilayers already exhibit bulk-like anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance only. Surface roughness measurements by atomic force\nmicroscopy revealed that the two kinds of pulse combination yield different\nsurface roughness values which correlate with the structural quality of the\nmultilayers as indicated by the absence or presence of multilayer satellite\nreflections in the X-ray diffraction patterns. The results of multilayer\nchemical analysis revealed that mainly an increased Cu content of the magnetic\nlayer is responsible for the onset of SPM regions in the form of Co\nsegregations in the G/P/G multilayers with small Cu layer thicknesses.\n", "  The Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology is analyzed with a particular\npotential $\\rm V(\\phi)=V_0 e^{-\\sqrt{3} \\phi}$ in the quintessence field\nscenario, which emerges in the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY)\nformalism. Using Hamilton's approach for a scalar field $\\phi$ with standard\nkinetic energy, and the Hamilton equations, we find exact solutions to the\ncomplete set of the\n  Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations without the need of the slow-roll conditions\nin order to model the inflation phenomenon. We find that the solutions are in\ngood agreement with the inflationary conditions such as the e-folding function\n${\\cal N}$ which corresponds to the $\\Omega$ function in the Misner\nparametrization for the scale factor $\\rm A(t)=e^{\\Omega(t)}$ when evaluated in\n$\\rm \\Delta t$, which is the time interval for the inflation period. The\nacceleration of the scale factor was computed and it was found to be positive\nfor the inflation period with a range of values for the parameters of the\nmodel. Quantum solution from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is presented, where\nthe wave function in relation to the evolution of the scale factor, shows that\nfor this period of time at larger values of $\\rm A$ and for any value of\nscalar-field $\\rm \\varphi$, the wave function is peaked.\n", "  Plasmonic nanocrystals with hot spots are able to localize optical energy in\nsmall spaces. In such physical systems, near-field interactions between\nmolecules and plasmons can become especially strong. This paper considers the\ncase of a nanoparticle dimer and a chiral biomolecule. In our model, a chiral\nmolecule is placed in the gap between two plasmonic nanoparticles, where the\nelectromagnetic hot spot occurs. Since many important biomolecules have optical\ntransitions in the UV, we consider the case of Aluminum nanoparticles, as they\noffer strong electromagnetic enhancements in the blue and UV spectral\nintervals. Our calculations show that the complex composed of a chiral molecule\nand an Al-dimer exhibits strong CD signals in the plasmonic spectral region. In\ncontrast to the standard Au- and Ag-nanocrystals, the Al system may have a much\nbetter spectral overlap between the typical biomolecule's optical transitions\nand the nanocrystals' plasmonic band. Overall, we found that Al nanocrystals\nused as CD antennas exhibit unique properties as compared to other commonly\nstudied plasmonic and dielectric materials. The plasmonic systems investigated\nin this study can be potentially used for sensing chirality of biomolecules,\nwhich is of interest in applications such as drug development.\n", "  Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) models represent the workhorse for\nstudying turbulent flows in industrial applications. Such single-point\nturbulence models have limitations in accounting for the influence of the\nnon-local physics and flow history on the evolution of the turbulent flow. In\nthis context, we investigate the sensitivity inherent to single-point models\ndue to their characterization of the internal structure of homogeneous\nturbulent flows solely by the means of the Reynolds stresses. For a variety of\nmean flows, we study the prediction intervals engendered due to this\ncoarse-grained description. The nature of this variability and its dependence\non parameters such as the mean flow topology, the initial Reynolds stress\ntensor and the normalized strain rate is identified, analyzed and explicated.\nThe ramifications of this variability on the formulation of classical RANS\nclosure models are highlighted.\n", "  We perform first-principles path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and density\nfunctional theory molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) calculations to explore warm\ndense matter states of LiF. Our simulations cover a wide density-temperature\nrange of $2.08-15.70$~g$\\,$cm$^{-3}$ and $10^4-10^9$~K. Since PIMC and DFT-MD\naccurately treat effects of atomic shell structure, we find a pronounced\ncompression maximum and a shoulder on the principal Hugoniot curve attributed\nto K-shell and L-shell ionization. The results provide a benchmark for\nwidely-used EOS tables, such as SESAME, LEOS, and models. In addition, we\ncompute pair-correlation functions that reveal an evolving plasma structure and\nionization process that is driven by thermal and pressure ionization. Finally,\nwe compute electronic density of states of liquid LiF from DFT-MD simulations\nand find that the electronic gap can remain open with increasing density and\ntemperature to at least 15.7 g$~$cm$^{-3}$.\n", "  In this brief report, we attention to the system of two qubits modeled by\nHeisenberg XXZ chain with the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. The system\nexposed to bosonic baths with the Cauchy Lorentz distribution of frequency.\nWe've got a new formula to calculate the specific heat of open systems using\ndensity and found that the specific heat at low temperatures can be negative.\nWe observed that when the state of system is entangle, in contradiction with\nthe third law of thermodynamics, the specific heat is diverge when the\ntemperature goes to zero. The speed of divergence is depend to the amount of\nentanglement. These results may be useful to design solid quantum gate and\nquantum memories.\n", "  The flow of water confined to nanometer-sized pores is central to a wide\nrange of subjects from biology to nanofluidic devices. Despite its importance,\na clear picture about nanoscale fluid dynamics is yet to emerge. Here we\nmeasured dissipation in less than 20 nm thick water films and it was found to\ndecrease for both wetting and non-wetting confining surfaces. The fitting of\nCarreau-Yasuda model of shear thinning to our measurements implies that flow is\nnon-Newtonian and for wetting surfaces the no-slip boundary condition is valid.\nOn the contrary, for non-wetting surfaces boundary slippage occurs with slip\nlengths of the order of few nm. The findings suggest that both, the wettability\nof the confining surfaces and nonlinear rheological response of water molecules\nunder nano-confinement play a dominant role in transport properties.\n", "  A phenomenological thermodynamic potential was constructed based on the\nsymmetry analysis and property characterization of bulk DyCo2. An eight-order\npolynomial of Landau expansion was employed to describe the thermodynamic\nbehavior of DyCo2. Several properties were reproduced including ferromagnetic\ntransition temperature, magnetization curve, temperature dependence of\nmagnetization. The transition behavior was analyzed via the thermodynamic\npotential. The Landau phenomenological thermodynamic model predicts the correct\nmetamagnetic transition near the Curie temperature.\n", "  Quantum enhanced microscopy allows for measurements at high sensitivities and\nlow damage. Recently, multi-pass microscopy was introduced as such a scheme,\nexploiting the sensitivity enhancement offered by multiple photon-sample\ninteractions. Here we theoretically and numerically compare three different\ncontrast enhancing techniques that are all based on self-imaging cavities: CW\ncavity enhanced microscopy, cavity ring-down microscopy and multi-pass\nmicroscopy. We show that all three schemes can lead to sensitivities beyond the\nstandard quantum limit.\n", "  From microscopic point-dipole model calculations of the screening of the\nCoulomb interaction in non-polar systems by polarizable atoms, it is known that\nscreening strongly depends on dimensionality. For example, in one dimensional\nsystems the short range interaction is screened, while the long range\ninteraction is anti-screened. This anti-screening is also observed in some zero\ndimensional structures, i.e. molecular systems. By means of ab-initio\ncalculations in conjunction with the random-phase approximation (RPA) within\nthe FLAPW method we study screening of the Coulomb interaction in FexOy\nclusters. For completeness these results are compared with their bulk\ncounterpart magnetite. It appears that the onsite Coulomb interaction is very\nwell screened both in the clusters and bulk. On the other hand for the\nintersite Coulomb interaction the important observation is made that it is\nalmost contant throughout the clusters, while for the bulk it is almost\ncompletely screened. More precisely and interestingly, in the clusters\nanti-screening is observed by means of ab-initio calculations.\n", "  We propose that a tunable generalized three-dimensional Hofstadter\nHamiltonian can be realized by engineering the Raman-assisted hopping of\nultracold atoms in a cubic optical lattice. The Hamiltonian describes a\nperiodic lattice system under artificial magnetic fluxes in three dimensions.\nFor certain hopping configurations, the bulk bands can have Weyl points and\nnodal loops, respectively, allowing the study of both the two nodal semimetal\nstates within this system. Furthermore, we illustrate that with proper rational\nfluxes and hopping parameters, the system can exhibit the three-dimensional\nquantum Hall effect when the Fermi level lies in the band gaps, which is\ntopologically characterized by one or two nonzero Chern numbers. Our proposed\noptical-lattice system provides a promising platform for exploring various\nexotic topological phases in three dimensions.\n", "  The thesis focuses on the prediction of solvation thermodynamics using\nintegral equation theories. Our main goal is to improve the approach using a\nrational correction. We achieve it by extending recently introduced pressure\ncorrection, and rationalizing it in the context of solvation entropy. The\nimproved model (to which we refer as advanced pressure correction) is rather\nuniversal. It can accurately predict solvation free energies in water at both\nambient and non-ambient temperatures, is capable of addressing ionic solutes\nand salt solutions, and can be extended to non-aqueous systems. The developed\napproach can be used to model processes in biological systems, as well as to\nextend related theoretical models further.\n", "  We examine the gender balance of the 18th and 19th meetings of the Cambridge\nWorkshop on Cool Stellar Systems and the Sun (CS18 and CS19). The percent of\nfemale attendees at both meetings (31% at CS18 and 37% at CS19) was higher than\nthe percent of women in the American Astronomical Society (25%) and the\nInternational Astronomical Union (18%). The representation of women in Cool\nStars as SOC members, invited speakers, and contributed speakers was similar to\nor exceeded the percent of women attending the meetings. We requested that\nconference attendees assist in a project to collect data on the gender of\nastronomers asking questions after talks. Using this data, we found that men\nwere over-represented (and women were under-represented) in the question\nsessions after each talk. Men asked 79% of the questions at CS18 and 75% of the\nquestions at CS19, but were 69% and 63% of the attendees respectively. Contrary\nto findings from previous conferences, we did not find that the gender balance\nof questions was strongly affected by the session chair gender, the speaker\ngender, or the length of the question period. We also found that female and\nmale speakers were asked a comparable number of questions after each talk. The\ncontrast of these results from previous incarnations of the gender questions\nsurvey indicate that more data would be useful in understanding the factors\nthat contribute to the gender balance of question askers. We include a\npreliminary set of recommendations based on this and other work on related\ntopics, but also advocate for additional research on the demographics of\nconference participants. Additional data on the intersection of gender with\nrace, seniority, sexual orientation, ability and other marginalized identities\nis necessary to fully address the role of gender in asking questions at\nconferences.\n", "  We present a joint-measurement uncertainty relation for a pair of mean square\ndeviations of canonical variables averaged over Gaussian distributed quantum\noptical states. Our Bayesian formulation is free from the unbiasedness\nassumption, and enables us to quantify experimentally implemented\njoint-measurement devices by feeding a moderate set of coherent states. Our\nresult also reproduces the most informative bound for quantum estimation of\nphase-space displacement in the case of pure Gaussian states.\n", "  Quantum gases of rare-earth elements are of interest due to the large\nmagnetic moment of many of those elements, leading to strong dipole-dipole\ninteractions, as well as an often nonvanishing orbital angular momentum in the\nelectronic ground state, with prospects for long coherence time Raman\nmanipulation, and state-dependent lattice potentials. We report on the\nrealization of a Bose-Einstein condensate of erbium atoms in a\nquasielectrostatic optical dipole trap generated by a tightly focused\nmidinfrared optical beam derived from a $\\textrm{CO}_2$ laser near 10.6$\\mu$m\nin wavelength. The quasistatic dipole trap is loaded from a magneto-optic trap\noperating on a narrow-line erbium laser cooling transition near 583nm in\nwavelength. Evaporative cooling within the dipole trap takes place in the\npresence of a magnetic field gradient to enhance the evaporative speed, and we\nproduce spin-polarized erbium Bose-Einstein condensates with $3\\times10^4$\natoms.\n", "  We present an experimental study of the bending waves of freestanding\n\\ce{Si3N4} nanomembranes using optical profilometry in varying environments\nsuch as pressure and temperature. We introduce a method, named Vibrometry in\nContinuous Light (VICL) that enables us to disentangle the response of the\nmembrane from the one of the excitation system, thereby giving access to the\neigenfrequency and the quality ($Q$) factor of the membrane by fitting a model\nof a damped driven harmonic oscillator to the experimental data. The validity\nof particular assumptions or aspects of the model such as damping mechanisms,\ncan be tested by imposing additional constraints on the fitting procedure. We\nverify the performance of the method by studying two modes of a\n$478~\\textrm{nm}$ thick \\ce{Si3N4} freestanding membrane and find $Q$ factors\nof $2 \\times 10^4$ for both modes at room temperature. Finally, we observe a\nlinear increase of the resonance frequency of the ground mode with temperature\nwhich amounts to $550~\\textrm{Hz}/^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for a ground mode\nfrequency of $0.447~\\textrm{MHz}$. This makes the nanomembrane resonators\nsuitable as high-sensitive temperature sensors.\n", "  The lunar technique is a method for maximising the collection area for\nultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic ray and neutrino searches. The method uses\neither ground-based radio telescopes or lunar orbiters to search for Askaryan\nemission from particles cascading near the lunar surface. While experiments\nusing the technique have made important advances in the detection of\nnanosecond-scale pulses, only at the very highest energies has the lunar\ntechnique achieved competitive limits. This is expected to change with the\nadvent of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the low-frequency component of\nwhich (SKA-low) is predicted to be able to detect an unprecedented number of\nUHE cosmic rays.\n  In this contribution, the status of lunar particle detection is reviewed,\nwith particular attention paid to outstanding theoretical questions, and the\ntechnical challenges of using a giant radio array to search for nanosecond\npulses. The activities of SKA's High Energy Cosmic Particles Focus Group are\ndescribed, as is a roadmap by which this group plans to incorporate this\ndetection mode into SKA-low observations. Estimates for the sensitivity of\nSKA-low phases 1 and 2 to UHE particles are given, along with the achievable\nscience goals with each stage. Prospects for near-future observations with\nother instruments are also described.\n", "  This paper proves almost-sharp asymptotics for small data solutions of the\nVlasov-Nordstr\\\"om system in dimension three. This system consists of a wave\nequation coupled to a transport equation and describes an ensemble of\nrelativistic, self-gravitating particles. We derive sharp decay estimates using\na variant of the vector-field method introduced in previous work. More\nprecisely, we construct modified vector fields, depending on the solutions, to\npropagate $L^1$-bounds for the distribution function and its derivatives. The\nmodified vector fields are designed to have improved commutation properties\nwith the transport operator and yet to still provide sufficient control on the\nsolutions to allow for a sharp Klainerman-Sobolev type inequality. Our method\ndoes not require any compact support assumption in the velocity variable nor do\nwe need strong interior decay for the solution to the wave equation.\n", "  Orbital angular momentum of light has recently been recognized as a new\ndegree of freedom to encode information in quantum communication using light\npulses. Methods to extract this information include reversing the process by\nwhich such twisted light was created in the first place or interference with\nother beams. Here, we propose an alternative new way to directly read out the\nextra information encoded in twisted light using plasmonic nanoantennas by con-\nverting the information about the orbital angular momentum of light into\nspectral information using bright and dark modes. Exemplarily considering\nrotation-symmetrical nanorod nanoan- tennas we show that their scattering\ncross-section is sensitive to the value of the orbital angular momentum\ncombined with the polarisation of an incident twisted light beam. Explaining\nthe twist-dependence of the excited modes with a new analytical model our\nresults pave the way to twisted light nanoplasmonics, which is of central\nimportance for future on-chip communication using orbital angular momentum of\nlight.\n", "  We investigate the thin-shell wormholes constrained by cosmological\nobservations for the first time in the literature. Without loss of generality,\nwe study the thin-shell wormholes in $\\omega$CDM model and analyze their\nstability under perturbations preserving the symmetry. Firstly, we constrain\nthe $\\omega$CDM model using a combination of Union 2.1 SNe Ia data, the latest\n$H(z)$ data and CMB data. Secondly, we use the constrained dark energy equation\nof state (EoS) $\\omega$ which lies in $[-1.05,-0.89]$ to investigate thin-shell\nwormholes of various black hole spacetimes. We find that the stable\nSchwarzschild and Reinssner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m thin-shell wormholes constrained by\ncosmological observations do not exist. In addition, the method we developed\ncan be applied into exploring the stable thin-shell wormholes from any black\nhole spacetime in the framework of any cosmological theory.\n", "  A deterministic multi-scale dynamical system is introduced and discussed as\nprototype model for relative dispersion in stationary, homogeneous and\nisotropic turbulence. Unlike stochastic diffusion models, here trajectory\ntransport and mixing properties are entirely controlled by Lagrangian Chaos.\nThe anomalous \"sweeping effect\", a known drawback common to kinematic\nsimulations, is removed thanks to the use of quasi-Lagrangian coordinates.\nLagrangian dispersion statistics of the model are accurately analysed by\ncomputing the Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponent (FSLE), which is the optimal\nmeasure of the scaling properties of dispersion. FSLE scaling exponents provide\na severe test to decide whether model simulations are in agreement with\ntheoretical expectations and/or observation. The results of our numerical\nexperiments cover a wide range of \"Reynolds numbers\" and show that chaotic\ndeterministic flows can be very efficient, and numerically low-cost, models of\nturbulent trajectories in stationary, homogeneous and isotropic conditions. The\nmathematics of the model is relatively simple and, in a geophysical context,\npotential applications may regard small-scale parametrization issues in general\ncirculation models, mixed layer and/or boundary layer turbulence models as well\nas Lagrangian predictability studies.\n", "  Hole doping of La_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4 (Ae=Sr,Ba) and La_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4 (Ln =\nNd, Eu; y = 0.4, 0.2) introduces unidirectional charge density waves (CDWs) of\nincommensurability delta_c(x) in domains of the CuO_2 planes. A periodic\nstructure, each CDW gives rise to a Bragg-reflection mirror of extension\ndelta_c(x) that attaches to a nodal point \\.{Q} on the planar diagonal in\nreciprocal space. This confines itinerant holes to a Fermi arc about \\.{Q},\nleaving a pseudogap along the remainder of the underlying Fermi surface. The\nlength of the Fermi arc and the magnitude of the pseudogap both are determined\nby \\delta_c(x). The pseudogap closes when the Fermi arc reaches the antinodal\nsymmetry points M. This is the case at a doping level x^*_0 = 0.182 for\nLa_{2-x}Ae_xCuO_4 at T=0 (quantum critical point, QCP) and otherwise at a\ndoping-dependent pseudogap temperature T^*(x) that marks the boundary between\nthe compounds' pseudogap phase and strange-metal phase. The different value of\nthe observed QCP in La_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4, x^*_0 = 0.235, is attributed to\nextra magnetic order from Ln^{3+} ions with a finite magnetic moment instead of\nLa^{3+} with none. The possibility of quantum oscillations in\nLa_{2-y-x}Ln_ySr_xCuO_4 in the high-end doping interval of their pseudogap\nphase, 0.182 < x < 0.235, is raised. The strange-metal phase is interpreted as\na consequence of conflicting Bragg reflection conditions for the crystals'\nitinerant charge carriers when boundaries of the BZ and the CDW mirrors\ncoincide, frustrating umklapp processes of carrier-carrier scattering.\n", "  We discuss a method of calculating the key cosmological parameters on the\nbasis of a selected scale factor by using exact solutions of the background\nequations. We specify the formulas for calculating the power spectrum, the\nspectral indices and their ratios, and the ratio of squared amplitudes of\nscalar and tensor perturbations. We obtain, for the first time, expressions for\nthe basic cosmological parameters in terms of the scalar factor value at the\ninstant of crossing the cosmological horizon. In this case, the cosmological\nparameters are calculated for a wide class of exact models. They are compared\nwith their analogs derived in the slow-rolling approximation.\n", "  The high field transport characteristics of nanostructured transistors based\non layered materials are not only important from a device physics perspective\nbut also for possible applications in next generation electronics. With the\ngrowing promise of layered materials as replacements to conventional silicon\ntechnology, we study here the high current density properties of the layered\nmaterial titanium trisulfide (TiS3). We observe high breakdown current\ndensities up to 1.7 10^6 A/cm^2 in TiS3 nanoribbon-based field-effect\ntransistors which are among the highest found in semiconducting nanomaterials.\nInvestigating the mechanisms responsible for current breakdown, we perform a\nthermogravimetric analysis of bulk TiS3 and compare the results with density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations. We conclude that\noxidation of TiS3 and subsequent desorption of sulfur atoms plays an important\nrole in the electrical breakdown of the material in ambient conditions. Our\nresults show that TiS3 is an attractive material for high power applications\nand lend insight to the thermal and defect activated mechanisms responsible for\nelectrical breakdown in nanostructured devices.\n", "  We complete the analysis of the phase diagram of the complex branching\nBrownian motion energy model by studying Phases I, III and boundaries between\nall three phases (I-III) of this model. For the properly rescaled partition\nfunction, in Phase III and on the boundaries I/III and II/III, we prove a\ncentral limit theorem with a random variance. In Phase I and on the boundary\nI/II, we prove an a.s. and $L^1$ martingale convergence. All results are shown\nfor any given correlation between the real and imaginary parts of the random\nenergy.\n", "  We construct the q-discrete Painleve I and II equations and their higher\norder analogues by virtue of periodic cluster algebras. Using particular (k,k)\nexchange matrices, we show that the cluster algebras corresponding to k=4 and 5\ngive the q-discrete Painleve I and II equations respectively. For k=6,7,..., we\nhave the higher order discrete equations that satisfy an integrable criterion,\nthe co-primeness property.\n", "  We establish how the intensities of the higher harmonics that arise when a\nphotoelectron recombines with a parent ion depend functionally on the\nparameters of the laser wave and atomic medium, and estimate the limiting\nvalues of these parameters that are needed to observe the phase synchronization\neffect.\n", "  We measure the high-frequency emission of a single Cooper pair\ntransistor(SCPT) in the regime where transport is only due to tunneling of\nCooper pairs. This is achieved by coupling on-chip the SCPT to a\nsuperconductor-insulator-superconductor junction and by measuring the photon\nassisted tunneling current of quasiparticles across the junction. This\ntechnique allows a direct detection of the AC Josephson effect of the SCPT and\nprovides evidence of Landau-Zener transitions for proper gate voltage. The\nemission in the regime of resonant Cooper pair tunneling is also investigated.\nIt is interpreted in terms of transitions between charge states coupled by the\nJosephson effect.\n", "  Gravitational wave emission from the gravitational collapse of massive stars\nhas been studied for more than three decades. Current state of the art\nnumerical investigations of collapse include those that use progenitors with\nrealistic angular momentum profiles, properly treat microphysics issues,\naccount for general relativity, and examine non--axisymmetric effects in three\ndimensions. Such simulations predict that gravitational waves from various\nphenomena associated with gravitational collapse could be detectable with\nadvanced ground--based and future space--based interferometric observatories.\n"]}
