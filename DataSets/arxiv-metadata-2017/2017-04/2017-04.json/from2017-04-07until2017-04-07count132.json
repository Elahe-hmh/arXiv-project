However, this conclusion was drawn for systems of\nnoninteracting or weakly interacting carriers, while in all 2D systems\nexhibiting the metal-insulator transition, the interaction energy greatly\nexceeds all other energy scales. We review the main experimental findings and\nshow that, although significant progress has been achieved in our understanding\nof the MIT in 2D, many open questions remain.\n", "  The production of the prompt charm mesons $D^0$, $D^+$, $D^{*+}$, and their\nantiparticles, was measured with the ALICE detector in Pb-Pb collisions at the\nLHC, at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV per nucleon--nucleon\ncollision. The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential production yields in the range\n$2<p_{\\rm T}<16$ GeV/c at central rapidity, $|y|<0.5$, were used to calculate\nthe nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ with respect to a proton-proton\nreference obtained from the cross section measured at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and\nscaled to $\\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV. For the three meson species, $R_{AA}$ shows a\nsuppression by a factor 3-4, for transverse momenta larger than 5 GeV/c in the\n20% most central collisions. The suppression is reduced for peripheral\ncollisions.\n", "  We establish existence and uniqueness for Gaussian free field flow lines\nstarted at {\\em interior} points of a planar domain. We interpret these as rays\nof a random geometry with imaginary curvature and describe the way distinct\nrays intersect each other and the boundary.\n  Previous works in this series treat rays started at {\\em boundary} points and\nuse Gaussian free field machinery to determine which chordal\n\\SLE_\\kappa(\\rho_1; \\rho_2) processes are time-reversible when \\kappa < 8. Here\nwe extend these results to whole-plane \\SLE_\\kappa(\\rho) and establish\ncontinuity and transience of these paths. In particular, we extend ordinary\nwhole-plane SLE reversibility (established by Zhan for \\kappa \\in [0,4]) to all\n\\kappa \\in [0,8].\n  We also show that the rays of a given angle (with variable starting point)\nform a space-filling planar tree. Each branch is a form of SLE_\\kappa for some\n\\kappa \\in (0, 4), and the curve that traces the tree in the natural order\n(hitting x before y if the branch from x is left of the branch from y) is a\nspace-filling form of \\SLE_{\\kappa'} where \\kappa':= 16/\\kappa \\in (4, \\infty).\nBy varying the boundary data we obtain, for each \\kappa'>4, a family of\nspace-filling variants of \\SLE_{\\kappa'}(\\rho) whose time reversals belong to\nthe same family. When \\kappa' \\geq 8, ordinary \\SLE_{\\kappa'} belongs to this\nfamily, and our result shows that its time-reversal is \\SLE_{\\kappa'}(\\kappa'/2\n- 4; \\kappa'/2 - 4).\n  As applications of this theory, we obtain the local finiteness of\n\\CLE_{\\kappa'}, for \\kappa' \\in (4,8), and describe the laws of the boundaries\nof \\SLE_{\\kappa'} processes stopped at stopping times.\n", "  Recent results by Harrow et. al. and by Ta-Shma, suggest that quantum\ncomputers may have an exponential advantage in solving a wealth of linear\nalgebraic problems, over classical algorithms. Building on the quantum\nintuition of these results, we step back into the classical domain, and explore\nits usefulness in designing classical algorithms. We achieve an algorithm for\nsolving the major linear-algebraic problems in time $O(n^{\\omega+\\nu})$ for any\n$\\nu>0$, where $\\omega$ is the optimal matrix-product constant. Thus our\nalgorithm is optimal w.r.t. matrix multiplication, and comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for these problems due to Demmel et. al. Being\nderived from quantum intuition, our proposed algorithm is completely disjoint\nfrom all previous classical algorithms, and builds on a combination of\nlow-discrepancy sequences and perturbation analysis. As such, we hope it\nmotivates further exploration of quantum techniques in this respect, hopefully\nleading to improvements in our understanding of space complexity and numerical\nstability of these problems.\n", "  It is well known that cooperation cannot be an evolutionary stable strategy\nfor a non-iterative game in a well-mixed population. In contrast, structured\npopulations favor cooperation since cooperators can benefit each other by\nforming local clusters. Previous studies have shown that scale-free networks\nstrongly promote cooperation. However, little is known about the invasion\nmechanism of cooperation in scale-free networks. To study microscopic and\nmacroscopic behaviors of cooperators' invasion, we conducted computational\nexperiments of the evolution of cooperation in scale-free networks where,\nstarting from all defectors, cooperators can spontaneously emerge by mutation.\nSince the evolutionary dynamics are influenced by the definition of fitness, we\ntested two commonly adopted fitness functions: accumulated payoff and average\npayoff. Simulation results show that cooperation is strongly enhanced with the\naccumulated payoff fitness compared to the average payoff fitness. However, the\ndifference between the two functions decreases as the average degree increases.\nAs the average degree increases, cooperation decreases with the accumulated\npayoff fitness, while it increases with the average payoff fitness. Moreover,\nwith the average payoff fitness, low-degree nodes play a more important role in\nspreading cooperative strategies compared to the case of the accumulated payoff\nfitness.\n", "  Here we present a theoretical study of the thermoelectric transport through\n{[}2,2{]}para\\-cyclo\\-phane-based single-molecule junctions. Combining\nelectronic and vibrational structures, obtained from density functional theory\n(DFT), with nonequilibrium Green's function techniques, allows us to treat both\nelectronic and phononic transport properties at a first-principles level. For\nthe electronic part, we include an approximate self-energy correction, based on\nthe DFT+$\\Sigma$ approach. This enables us to make a reliable prediction of all\nlinear response transport coefficients entering the thermoelectric figure of\nmerit $ZT$. Paracyclophane derivatives offer a great flexibility in tuning\ntheir chemical properties by attaching different functional groups. We show\nthat, for the specific molecule, the functional groups mainly influence the\nthermopower, allowing to tune its sign and absolute value. We predict that the\nfunctionalization of the bare paracyclophane leads to a largely enhanced\nelectronic contribution $Z_{\\mathrm{el}}T$ to the figure of merit.\nNevertheless, the high phononic contribution to the thermal conductance\nstrongly suppresses $ZT$. Our work demonstrates the importance to include the\nphonon thermal conductance for any realistic estimate of the $ZT$ for\noff-resonant molecular transport junctions. In addition, it shows the\npossibility of a chemical tuning of the thermoelectric properties for a series\nof available molecules, leading to equally performing hole- and\nelectron-conducting junctions based on the same molecular framework.\n", "  We exploit the beauty and strength of the symmetry invariant restrictions on\nthe (anti-)chiral superfields to derive the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST),\nanti-BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations in the case of a two\n(1+1)-dimensional (2D) self-dual chiral bosonic field theory within the\nframework of augmented (anti-)chiral superfield formalism. Our 2D ordinary\ntheory is generalized onto a (2, 2)-dimensional supermanifold which is\nparameterized by the superspace variable Z^M = (x^\\mu, \\theta, \\bar\\theta)\nwhere x^\\mu (with \\mu = 0, 1) are the ordinary 2D bosonic coordinates and\n(\\theta,\\, \\bar\\theta) are a pair of Grassmannian variables with their standard\nrelationships: \\theta^2 = {\\bar\\theta}^2 =0, \\theta\\,\\bar\\theta +\n\\bar\\theta\\theta = 0. We impose the (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariant\nrestrictions on the (anti-)chiral superfields (defined on the (anti-)chiral (2,\n1)-dimensional super-submanifolds of the above general (2, 2)-dimensional\nsupermanifold) to derive the above nilpotent symmetries. We do not exploit the\nmathematical strength of the (dual-)horizontality conditions anywhere in our\npresent investigation. We also discuss the properties of nilpotency, absolute\nanticommutativity and (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry invariance of the\nLagrangian density within the framework of our augmented (anti-)chiral\nsuperfield formalism. Our observation of the absolute anticommutativity\nproperty is a completely novel result in view of the fact that we have\nconsidered only the (anti-)chiral superfields in our present endeavor.\n", "  Dynamical models implemented on the large scale architecture of the human\nbrain may shed light on how function arises from the underlying structure. This\nis the case notably for simple abstract models, such as the Ising model. We\ncompare the spin correlations of the Ising model and the empirical functional\nbrain correlations, both at the single link level and at the modular level, and\nshow that their match increases at the modular level in anesthesia, in line\nwith recent results and theories. Moreover, we show that at the peak of the\nspecific heat (the \\it{critical state}) the spin correlations are minimally\nshaped by the underlying structural network, explaining how the best match\nbetween structure and function is obtained at the onset of criticality, as\npreviously observed. These findings confirm that brain dynamics under\nanesthesia shows a departure from criticality and could open the way to novel\nperspectives when the conserved magnetization is interpreted in terms of an\nhomeostatic principle imposed to neural activity.\n", "  Nanoscale focused ion beams (FIBs) represent one of the most useful tools in\nnanotechnology, enabling nanofabrication via milling and gas-assisted\ndeposition, microscopy and microanalysis, and selective, spatially resolved\ndoping of materials. Recently, a new type of FIB source has emerged, which uses\nionization of laser cooled neutral atoms to produce the ion beam. The extremely\ncold temperatures attainable with laser cooling (in the range of 100 uK or\nbelow) result in a beam of ions with a very small transverse velocity\ndistribution. This corresponds to a source with extremely high brightness that\nrivals or may even exceed the brightness of the industry standard Ga+ liquid\nmetal ion source. In this review we discuss the context of ion beam technology\nin which these new ion sources can play a role, their principles of operation,\nand some examples of recent demonstrations. The field is relatively new, so\nonly a few applications have been demonstrated, most notably low energy ion\nmicroscopy with Li ions. Nevertheless, a number of promising new approaches\nhave been proposed and/or demonstrated, suggesting that a rapid evolution of\nthis type of source is likely in the near future.\n", "  By foliating the four-dimensional C-metric black hole spacetime, we consider\na kind of initial-value-like formulation of the vacuum Einstein's equation, the\nholographic initial data is a double consisting of the induced metric and the\nBrown-York energy momentum tensor on an arbitrary initial hypersurface. Then by\nperturbing the initial data that generates the background spacetime, it is\nshown that, in an appropriate limit, the fluctuation modes are governed by the\ncontinuity equation and the compressible Navier-Stokes equation which describe\nthe momentum transport in non-relativistic viscous fluid on a flat Newtonian\nspace. It turns out that the flat space fluid behaves as a pure vortex and the\nviscosity to entropy ratio is subjected to the black hole acceleration.\n", "  We review the physical phenomena that arise when quantum mechanical energy\nlevels are modulated in time. The dynamics resulting from changes in the\ntransition frequency is a problem studied since the early days of quantum\nmechanics. It has been of constant interest both experimentally and\ntheoretically since, with the simple two-state model providing an inexhaustible\nsource of novel concepts. When the transition frequency of a quantum system is\nmodulated, several phenomena can be observed, such as\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana interference, motional averaging and\nnarrowing, and the formation of dressed states with the presence of sidebands\nin the spectrum. Adiabatic changes result in the accumulation of geometric\nphases, which can be used to create topological states. In recent years, an\nexquisite experimental control in the time domain was gained through the\nparameters entering the Hamiltonian, and high-fidelity readout schemes allowed\nthe state of the system to be monitored non-destructively. These developments\nwere made in the field of quantum devices, especially in superconducting\nqubits, as a well as in atomic physics, in particular in ultracold gases. As a\nresult of these advances, it became possible to demonstrate many of the\nfundamental effects that arise in a quantum system when its transition\nfrequencies are modulated. The purpose of this review is to present some of\nthese developments, from two-state atoms and harmonic oscillators to multilevel\nand many-particle systems.\n", "  The QCD running coupling $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ sets the strength of the\ninteractions of quarks and gluons as a function of the momentum transfer $Q$.\nThe $Q^2$ dependence of the coupling is required to describe hadronic\ninteractions at both large and short distances. In this article we adopt the\nlight-front holographic approach to strongly-coupled QCD, a formalism which\nincorporates confinement, predicts the spectroscopy of hadrons composed of\nlight quarks, and describes the low-$Q^2$ analytic behavior of the strong\ncoupling $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$. The high-$Q^2$ dependence of the coupling\n$\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ is specified by perturbative QCD and its renormalization group\nequation. The matching of the high and low $Q^2$ regimes of $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$\nthen determines the scale $Q_0$ which sets the interface between perturbative\nand nonperturbative hadron dynamics. The value of $Q_0$ can be used to set the\nfactorization scale for DGLAP evolution of hadronic structure functions and the\nERBL evolution of distribution amplitudes. We discuss the scheme-dependence of\nthe value of $Q_0$ and the infrared fixed-point of the QCD coupling. Our\nanalysis is carried out for the $\\bar{MS}$, $g_1$, $MOM$ and $V$\nrenormalization schemes. Our results show that the discrepancies on the value\nof $\\alpha_s$ at large distance seen in the literature can be explained by\ndifferent choices of renormalization schemes. We also provide the formulae to\ncompute $\\alpha_s(Q^2)$ over the entire range of space-like momentum transfer\nfor the different renormalization schemes discussed in this article.\n", "  We present a formulation of the maximally supersymmetric N=4 gauge theory in\nLorentz harmonic chiral (LHC) superspace. It is closely related to the twistor\nformulation of the theory but employs the simpler notion of Lorentz harmonic\nvariables. They parametrize a two-sphere and allow us to handle efficiently\ninfinite towers of higher-spin auxiliary fields defined on ordinary space-time.\nIn this approach the chiral half of N=4 supersymmetry is manifest. The other\nhalf is realized non-linearly and the algebra closes on shell. We give a\nstraightforward derivation of the Feynman rules in coordinate space. We show\nthat the LHC formulation of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory is remarkably\nsimilar to the harmonic superspace formulation of the N=2 gauge and\nhypermultiplet matter theories. In the twin paper arXiv:1601.06804 we apply the\nLHC formalism to the study of the non-chiral multipoint correlation functions\nof the N=4 stress-tensor supermultiplet.\n", "  We study the multipoint super-correlation functions of the full non-chiral\nstress-tensor multiplet in N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory in the Born\napproximation. We derive effective supergraph Feynman rules for them.\nSurprisingly, the Feynman rules for the non-chiral correlators are obtained\nfrom those for the chiral correlators by a simple Grassmann shift of the\nspace-time variables. We rely on the formulation of the theory in Lorentz\nharmonic chiral (LHC) superspace elaborated in the twin paper arXiv:1601.06803.\nIn this approach only the chiral half of the supersymmetry is manifest. The\nother half is realized by nonlinear and nonlocal transformations of the LHC\nsuperfields. However, at Born level only the simple linear part of the\ntransformations is relevant. It corresponds to effectively working in the\nself-dual sector of the theory. Our method is also applicable to a wider class\nof supermultiplets like all the half-BPS operators and the Konishi multiplet.\n", "  Violation of Lorentz invariancy in the high energy quantum gravity motivates\none to consider an energy dependent spacetime with massive deformation of\nstandard general relativity. In this paper, we take into account an energy\ndependent metric in the context of a massive gravity model to obtain exact\nsolutions. We investigate the geometry of black hole solutions and also\ncalculate the conserved and thermodynamic quantities, which are fully\nreproduced by the analysis performed with the standard techniques. After\nexamining the validity of the first law of thermodynamics, we conduct a study\nregarding the effects of different parameters on thermal stability of the\nsolutions. In addition, we employ the relation between cosmological constant\nand thermodynamical pressure to study the possibility of phase transition.\nInterestingly, we will show that for the specific configuration considered in\nthis paper, van der Waals like behavior is observed for different topology. In\nother words, for flat and hyperbolic horizons, similar to spherical horizon, a\nsecond order phase transition and van der Waals like behavior are observed.\nFurthermore, we use geometrical method to construct phase space and study phase\ntransition and bound points for these black holes. Finally, we obtain critical\nvalues in extended phase space through the use of a new method.\n", "  Preventing infectious disease like flu from spreading to large communities is\none of the most important issues for humans. One effective strategy is\nvoluntary vaccination, however, there is always the temptation for people\nrefusing to be vaccinated because once herd immunity is achieved, infection\nrisk is greatly reduced. In this paper, we study the effect of social impact on\nthe vaccination behavior resulting in preventing infectious disease in\nnetworks. The evolutionary simulation results show that the social impact has\nboth positive and negative effects on the vaccination behavior. Especially, in\nheterogeneous networks, if the vaccination cost is low, the behavior is more\npromoted than the case without social impact. In contrast, if the cost is high,\nthe behavior is reduced compared to the case without social impact. Moreover,\nthe vaccination behavior is effective in heterogeneous networks more than in\nhomogeneous networks. This implies that the social impact puts people at risk\nin homogeneous networks. We also evaluate the results from the social cost\nrelated to the vaccination policy.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy of crystalline/molecular systems is well backed with\nquantum chemical calculations and group theory, making it a unique\ncharacterization tool. For the \"intermediate\" case of nanoscale systems,\nhowever, the use of Raman spectroscopy is limited by the lack of such\ntheoretical bases. Here, we suggest to couple a scaled quantum-mechanical (SQM)\ncalculation with the phonon confinement model (PCM) to construct a universal\nand physically consistent basis for nanoscale Raman spectroscopy. Unlike the\ncommonly used one-dimensional dispersion PCM, we take into account the\nconfinement along all the three dimensions of the k-space. We apply it to\ndiamond nanoparticles of sub-50nm size, a system with pronounced anisotropy of\ndispersion for which the use of three-dimensional dispersion is a requisite.\nThe model excellently reproduces size-sensitive spectral features, including\nthe peak position, bandwidth and asymmetry of the sp3 C-C Raman band. This\nfundamental approach can be easily generalized to other nanocrystalline solids\nto hopefully contribute the future development of quantitative nanoscale Raman\nspectroscopy.\n", "  Unveiling new topological phases of matter is one of the current objectives\nin condensed matter physics. Recent experimental discoveries of Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals prompt to search for other exotic phases of matter. Here we present\na systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of ZrSiS,\na prime topological nodal semimetal candidate. Our wider Brillouin zone (BZ)\nmapping shows multiple Fermi surface pockets such as the diamond-shaped Fermi\nsurface, ellipsoidal-shaped Fermi surface, and a small electron pocket\nencircling at the zone center (G) point, the M point and the X point of the BZ,\nrespectively. We experimentally establish the spinless nodal fermion semimetal\nphase in ZrSiS, which is supported by our first-principles calculations. Our\nfindings evidence that the ZrSiS-type of material family is a new platform to\nexplore exotic states of quantum matter, while these materials are expected to\nprovide an avenue for engineering two-dimensional topological insulator\nsystems.\n", "  We present a scaling theory for the effect of thermal fluctuations on the\ncharacteristics of the depinning transition, and also in the closely related\ndirected percolation model. Thermal effects act as a sort of external field\nthat produces a rounding of the sharp transition occurring at zero temperature.\nThe theory allows to predict the value of the thermal rounding exponent that\nquantifies the rounding effect. It also gives insight into the spatial and\ntemporal correlations between thermally activated events, which are highly\nnon-trivial.\n", "  We investigate the bounce and cyclicity realization in the framework of\nweakly broken galileon theories. We study bouncing and cyclic solutions at the\nbackground level, reconstructing the potential and the galileon functions that\ncan give rise to a given scale factor, and presenting analytical expressions\nfor the bounce requirements. We proceed to a detailed investigation of the\nperturbations, which after crossing the bouncing point give rise to various\nobservables, such as the scalar and tensor spectral indices and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio. Although the scenario at hand shares the disadvantage\nof all bouncing models, namely that it provides a large tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nintroducing an additional light scalar significantly reduces it through the\nkinetic amplification of the isocurvature fluctuations.\n", "  Ground-based whole sky imagers (WSIs) can provide localized images of the sky\nof high temporal and spatial resolution, which permits fine-grained cloud\nobservation. In this paper, we show how images taken by WSIs can be used to\nestimate solar radiation. Sky cameras are useful here because they provide\nadditional information about cloud movement and coverage, which are otherwise\nnot available from weather station data. Our setup includes ground-based\nweather stations at the same location as the imagers. We use their measurements\nto validate our methods.\n", "  GeMn granular thin films are a unique and promising material for spintronics\napplications due to large positive magnetoresistance (MR). Previous studies on\nGeMn have suggested that the large MR is related to nanospinodal decomposition\nof GeMn into Mn-rich ferromagnetic nanoparticles and Mn-poor paramagnetic\nmatrix. However, its microscopic origin of the MR has not been clarified yet.\nHere, using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), which is extremely\nsensitive to the local magnetic state of each atom, we investigate the magnetic\nproperties of the nanoparticles and the matrix in GeMn separately. We find that\nthe MR ratio is proportional to the product of the magnetizations originating\nfrom the nanoparticles and the matrix. This result indicates that\nspin-polarized holes in the nanoparticles penetrate into the matrix and that\nthese holes undergo spin-disorder magnetic scattering by the paramagnetic Mn\natoms in the matrix, which induces the large MR.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall effect has been theoretically predicted and\nexperimentally verified in magnetic topological insulators. In addition, the\nsurface states of these materials exhibit a hedgehog-like \"spin\" texture in\nmomentum space. Here, we apply the previously formulated low-energy model for\nBi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound for magnetic topological insulators, to a slab\ngeometry in which an exchange field acts only within one of the surface layers.\nIn this sample set up, the hedgehog transforms into a skyrmion texture beyond a\ncritical exchange field. This critical field marks a transition between two\ntopologically distinct phases. The topological phase transition takes place\nwithout energy gap closing at the Fermi level and leaves the transverse Hall\nconductance unchanged and quantized to $e^2/2h$. The momentum-space skyrmion\ntexture persists in a finite field range. It may find its realization in hybrid\nheterostructures with an interface between a three-dimensional topological\ninsulator and a ferromagnetic insulator.\n", "  A recent experimental study of excited $^{8}\\!Be$ decay to its ground state\nreveals an anomaly in the final states angle distribution. This exceptional\nresult is attributed to a new vector gauge boson X(16.7). We study the\nsignificance of this new boson, especially its effect in anomalies observed in\nlong-lasting experimental measurements. By comparing the discrepancies between\nthe standard model predictions and the experimental results, we manage to find\nout the values and regions of the couplings of X(16.7) to muon and muon\nneutrino. In this work, we find that the newly observed boson X(16.7) may be\nthe solution of both NuTeV anomaly and the $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ puzzle.\n", "  We introduce a scheme for the quantum simulation of many-body decoherence\nbased on the unitary evolution of a stochastic Hamiltonian. Modulating the\nstrength of the interactions with stochastic processes, we show that the\nnoise-averaged density matrix simulates an effectively open dynamics governed\nby $k$-body Lindblad operators. Markovian dynamics can be accessed with\nwhite-noise fluctuations; non-Markovian dynamics requires colored noise. The\ntime scale governing the fidelity decay under many-body decoherence is shown to\nscale as $N^{-2k}$ with the system size $N$. Our proposal can be readily\nimplemented in a variety of quantum platforms including optical lattices,\nsuperconducting circuits and trapped ions.\n", "  This paper examines unexplored correlations in the parameter spaces probed by\nrecent ATLAS analyses for gluinos and squarks, addressing various shortcomings\nin the literature. Six 13 TeV ATLAS analyses based on 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of\nintegrated luminosity are interpreted in the 19-parameter R-parity conserving\nphenomenological minimal supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model\n(pMSSM). The distinct regions covered by each search are independent of prior,\nand we reveal particularly striking complementarity between the 2-6 jets and\nMulti-b searches. In the leptonic searches, we identify better sensitivity to\nmodels than those used for analysis optimisation, notably a squark-slepton-wino\nscenario for the SS/3L search. Further, we show how collider searches for\ncoloured states probe the structure of the pMSSM dark sector more extensively\nthan the Monojet analysis alone, with sensitivity to parameter spaces that are\nchallenging for direct detection experiments.\n", "  We use the intertwining properties of integral transformations to provide a\ncompact proof of the holographic equivalence between the first law of\nentanglement entropy and the linearized gravitational equations, in the context\nof the AdS/CFT-correspondence. We build upon the framework developed by\nFaulkner et al. [1] using the the Wald formalism, and exploit the symmetries of\nthe vacuum modular Hamiltonian of ball-shaped boundary regions.\n", "  Baryon number fluctuations are sensitive to the QCD phase transition and QCD\ncritical point. According to the Feynman rules of finite-temperature field\ntheory, we calculated various order moments and cumulants of the baryon number\ndistributions in the quasi-particle model of quark gluon plasma. Furthermore,\nwe compared our results with the experimental data measured by the STAR\nexperiment at RHIC. It is found that the experimental data can be well\ndescribed by the model for the colliding energies above 30 GeV and show large\ndiscrepancies at low energies. It can put new constraint on qQGP model and also\nprovide a baseline for the QCD critical point search in heavy-ion collisions at\nlow energies.\n", "  We study the effect of the electron-phonon interaction on the finite\nfrequency dependent electronic thermal conductivity of two dimensional\ngraphene. We calculate it for various acoustic phonons present in graphene and\ncharacterized by different dispersion relations using the memory function\napproach. It is found that the thermal conductivity $\\kappa(T)$ in the zero\nfrequency limit follows different power law for the longitudinal/transverse and\nthe flexural acoustic phonons. For the longitudinal/transverse phonons,\n$\\kappa(T) \\sim T^{-1}$ at the low temperature and saturates at the high\ntemperature. These signatures are qualitatively agree with the results\npredicted by the Boltzmann equation. Similarly, for the flexural phonons, we\nfind that $\\kappa(T)$ shows $T^{1/2}$ law at the low temperature and then\nsaturates at the high temperature. In the finite frequency regime, we observe\nthat the real part of the thermal conductivity, $\\text{Re}[\\kappa(\\omega,T)]$\nfollows $\\omega^{-2}$ behavior at the low frequency and becomes frequency\nindependent at the high frequency.\n", "  The existence of polyexcitons, the $N$-body complexes of excitons for $N > 2$\nin 3D bulk systems, has been controversial for more than 40 years since its\nfirst theoretical suggestion. We investigated the stability of fundamental\nexcitonic complexes in diamond numerically with the stochastic variational\nmethod (SVM) and an explicitly correlated Gaussian (ECG) basis. The\nelectron-hole many-body system is described by an effective mass Hamiltonian.\nOur model includes the effective mass anisotropy and multiple valley and band\ndegrees of freedom. We show that the excitons, trions, biexcitons, charged\nbiexcitons, and triexcitons are stable in diamond. Numerical calculations\nreproduce from 81% to 86% of the experimentally reported binding energies for\nneutral bound states.\n", "  Future experiments at the Jefferson Lab 12 GeV upgrade, in particular, the\nSolenoidal Large Intensity Device (SoLID), aim at a very precise data set in\nthe region where the partonic structure of the nucleon is dominated by the\nvalence quarks. One of the main goals is to constrain the quark transversity\ndistributions. We apply recent theoretical advances of the global QCD\nextraction of the transversity distributions to study the impact of future\nexperimental data from the SoLID experiments. Especially, we develop a simple\nstrategy based on the Hessian matrix analysis that allows one to estimate the\nuncertainties of the transversity quark distributions and their tensor charges\nextracted from SoLID data simulation. We find that the SoLID measurements with\nthe proton and the effective neutron targets can improve the precision of the\nu- and d-quark transversity distributions up to one order of magnitude in the\nrange 0.05 < x < 0.6.\n", "  The use of mass preconditioning or Hasenbusch filtering in modern Hybrid\nMonte Carlo simulations is common. At light quark masses, multiple filters\n(three or more) are typically used to reduce the cost of generating dynamical\ngauge fields; however, the task of tuning a large number of Hasenbusch mass\nterms is non-trivial. The use of short polynomial approximations to the inverse\nhas been shown to provide an effective UV filter for HMC simulations. In this\nwork we investigate the application of polynomial filtering to the mass\npreconditioned Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm as a means of introducing many time\nscales into the molecular dynamics integration with a simplified parameter\ntuning process. A generalized multi-scale integration scheme that permits\narbitrary step- sizes and can be applied to Omelyan-style integrators is also\nintroduced. We find that polynomial-filtered mass-preconditioning (PF-MP)\nperforms as well as or better than standard mass preconditioning, with\nsignificantly less fine tuning required.\n", "  Classical anisotropic XY antiferromagnets in a field on square and simple\ncubic lattices are studied using mainly Monte Carlo simulations. While in two\ndimensions the ordered antiferromagnetic and spin--flop phases are observed to\nbe separated by a narrow disordered phase, a line of direct transitions of\nfirst order between the two phases and a bicritical point are found in three\ndimensions. Results are compared to previous findings.\n", "  The neutrino mixing parameters are thoroughly studied using\nrenormalization-group evolution of Dirac neutrinos with recently proposed\nparametrization of the neutrino mixing angles referred as `high-scale mixing\nrelations'. The correlations among all neutrino mixing and $CP$ violating\nobservables are investigated. The predictions for the neutrino mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$ are precise, and could be easily tested by ongoing and future\nexperiments. We observe that the high scale mixing unification hypothesis is\nincompatible with Dirac neutrinos due to updated experimental data.\n", "  Let $N$ be a compact hyperbolic manifold, $M\\subset N$ an embedded totally\ngeodesic submanifold, and let $-\\hbar^2\\Delta_{N}$ be the semiclassical\nLaplace--Beltrami operator.\n  For any $\\varepsilon>0$, we explicitly construct families of\n\\emph{quasimodes} of spectral width at most\n$\\varepsilon\\frac{\\hbar}{|\\log\\hbar|}$ which exhibit a \"strong scar\" on $M$ in\nthat their microlocal lifts converge weakly to a probability measure which\nplaces positive weight on $S^*M$ ($\\hookrightarrow S^*N$). An immediate\ncorollary is that \\emph{any} invariant measure on $S^*N$ occurs in the ergodic\ndecomposition of the semiclassical limit of certain quasimodes of width\n$\\varepsilon \\frac{\\hbar}{|\\log\\hbar|}$\n", "  From the paper \"Formality Conjecture\" (Ascona 1996): \"I am aware of only one\nsuch a class, it corresponds to simplest good graph, the complete graph with\n$4$ vertices $($and $6$ edges$)$. This class gives a remarkable vector field on\nthe space of bi-vector fields on $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$. The evolution with respect\nto the time $t$ is described by the following non-linear partial differential\nequation: ..., where $\\alpha=\\sum_{i,j}\\alpha_{ij} {\\partial}/{\\partial\nx_{i}}\\wedge {\\partial}/{\\partial x_{j}}$ is a bi-vector field on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n  It follows from general properties of cohomology that $1)$ this evolution\npreserves the class of $($real-analytic$)$ Poisson structures}, ...\n  In fact, I cheated a little bit. In the formula for the vector field on the\nspace of bivector fields which one get from the tetrahedron graph, an\nadditional term is present. ... It is possible to prove formally that if\n$\\alpha$ is a Poisson bracket, i.e. if $[{\\alpha,\\alpha}]=0\\in\nT^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, then the additional term shown above vanishes.\"\n  By using twelve Poisson structures with high-degree polynomial coefficients\nas explicit counterexamples, we show that both the above claims are false:\nneither does the first flow preserve the property of bi-vectors to be Poisson\nnor does the second flow vanish identically at Poisson bi-vectors. The\ncounterexamples at hand suggest a correction to the formula for the \"exotic\"\nflow on the space of Poisson bi-vectors; in fact, this flow is encoded by the\nbalanced sum involving both the Kontsevich tetrahedral graphs (that give rise\nto the flows mentioned above). We reveal that it is only the balance $1:6$ for\nwhich the flow does preserve the space of Poisson bi-vectors.\n", "  The determination of the properties of neutron stars from the underlying\ntheory, QCD, is still an unsolved problem. This is mainly due to the difficulty\nto obtain reliable results for the equation of state for cold, dense QCD. As an\nalternative route to obtain qualitative insights, we determine the structure of\na neutron star for a modified version of QCD: By replacing the gauge group\nSU(3) with the exceptional Lie group G2, it is possible to perform lattice\nsimulations at finite density, while still retaining neutrons. Here, results of\nthese lattice simulations are used to determine the mass-radius relation of a\nneutron star for this theory. The results show that phase changes express\nthemselves in this relation. Also, the radius of the most massive neutron stars\nis found to vary very little, which would make radius determinations much\nsimpler if this would also be true in QCD.\n", "  We review the definition of semi-inclusive jet functions within Soft\nCollinear Effective Theory (SCET) and their application to inclusive jet cross\nsections. As an example, we consider both the inclusive production of jets and\nthe jet fragmentation function in proton-proton collisions. The semi-inclusive\njet functions satisfy renormalization group (RG) equations which take the form\nof standard timelike DGLAP evolution equations, analogous to collinear\nfragmentation functions. By solving these RG equations, the resummation of\npotentially large single logarithms $(\\alpha_s \\ln R)^n$ can be achieved. We\npresent numerical results at NLO+NLL$_R$ accuracy and compare to existing data\nfrom the LHC.\n", "  We consider scattering in quantum gravity and derive long-range classical and\nquantum contributions to the scattering of light-like bosons and fermions\n(spin-0, spin-1/2, spin-1) from an external massive scalar field, such as the\nSun or a black hole. This is achieved by treating general relativity as an\neffective field theory and identifying the non-analytic pieces of the one-loop\ngravitational scattering amplitude. It is emphasized throughout the paper how\nmodern amplitude techniques, involving spinor-helicity variables, unitarity,\nand squaring relations in gravity enable much simplified computations. We\ndirectly verify, as predicted by general relativity, that all classical effects\nin our computation are universal (in the context of matter type and\nstatistics). Using an eikonal procedure we confirm the post-Newtonian general\nrelativity correction for light-like bending around large stellar objects. We\nalso comment on treating effects from quantum hbar dependent terms using the\nsame eikonal method.\n", "  We develop a version of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) which includes\nfinite quark masses, as well as Glauber gluons that describe the interaction of\ncollinear partons with QCD matter. In the framework of this new effective field\ntheory, labeled SCET$_{\\mathrm{M,G}}$, we derive the massive splitting\nfunctions in the vacuum and the QCD medium for the processes $Q\\to Qg$, $Q\\to\ngQ$ and $g\\to Q\\bar Q$. The numerical effects due to finite quark masses are\nsizable and our results are consistent with the traditional approach to parton\nenergy loss in the soft gluon emission limit. In addition, we present a new\nframework for including the medium-induced full splitting functions consistent\nwith next-to-leading order calculations in QCD for inclusive hadron production.\nFinally, we show numerical results for the suppression of $D$- and $B$-mesons\nin heavy ion collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV and 2.76 TeV and\ncompare to available data from the LHC.\n", "  We present a calculation of the global polarization of Lambda hyperons in\nrelativistic Au-Au collisions at RHIC Beam Energy Scan range sqrt{s}_NN = 7.7 -\n200 GeV with a 3+1 dimensional cascade + viscous hydro + cascade model,\nUrQMD+vHLLE. Within this model, the mean polarization of Lambda in the\nout-of-plane direction is predicted to decrease rapidly with collision energy\nfrom a top value of about 2% at the lowest energy examined. We explore the\nconnection between the polarization signal and thermal vorticity and estimate\nthe feed-down contribution to Lambda polarization due to the decay of higher\nmass hyperons.\n", "  In this article, we study the Schr\\\"odinger operator for a large class of\nperiodic potentials with the symmetry of a hexagonal tiling of the plane. The\npotentials we consider are superpositions of localized potential wells,\ncentered on the vertices of a regular honeycomb structure corresponding to the\nsingle electron model of graphene and its artificial analogues. We consider\nthis Schr\\\"odinger operator in the regime of strong binding, where the depth of\nthe potential wells is large. Our main result is that for sufficiently deep\npotentials, the lowest two Floquet-Bloch dispersion surfaces, when\nappropriately rescaled, converge uniformly to those of the two-band\ntight-binding model (Wallace, 1947). Furthermore, we establish as corollaries,\nin the regime of strong binding, results on (a) the existence of spectral gaps\nfor honeycomb potentials that break $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$ symmetry and (b)\nthe existence of topologically protected edge states -- states which propagate\nparallel to and are localized transverse to a line-defect or \"edge\" - for a\nlarge class of rational edges, and which are robust to large localized\nperturbations of the edge. We believe that the ideas of this article may be\napplicable in other settings for which a tight-binding model emerges in an\nextreme parameter limit.\n", "  The presence of contextuality in quantum theory was first highlighted by\nBell, Kochen and Specker, who discovered that for quantum systems of three or\nmore dimensions, measurements cannot be viewed as revealing pre-existing\nproperties of the system. More precisely, no model can assign deterministic\noutcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only\non the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it\nappeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with\nprojectors are independent of the context. A more general, operational\ndefinition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term\n\"probabilistic contextuality\", drops the assumption of determinism and allows\nfor operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.\nProbabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an\noperational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the\nstatistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically\nidentical. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to\ndistinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the\nrelationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory\ngiven a certain relation between their operational representations. This\nframework can be used to motivate and define a \"possibilistic\" analogue,\nencapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be\nunambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously\ndistinguished ontologically. We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality\nis equivalent to an alternative notion proposed by Hardy. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that these weaker noncontextuality assumptions are sufficient to\nprove alternative versions of known \"no-go\" theorems that constrain\n$\\psi$-epistemic models for quantum mechanics.\n", "  We report coherent coupling between two macroscopically separated\nnitrogen-vacancy electron spin ensembles in a cavity quantum electrodynamics\nsystem. The coherent interaction between the distant ensembles is directly\ndetected in the cavity transmission spectrum by observing bright and dark\ncollective multiensemble states and an increase of the coupling strength to the\ncavity mode. Additionally, in the dispersive limit we show transverse\nensemble-ensemble coupling via virtual photons.\n", "  We show that the off-diagonal exchange anisotropy drives Mott insulators with\nstrong spin-orbit coupling to a classical spin liquid regime, characterized by\nan infinite number of ground states and Ising variables living on closed or\nopen strings. Depending on the sign of the anisotropy, quantum fluctuations\neither fail to lift the degeneracy down to very low temperatures, or select\nnon-collinear magnetic states with unconventional spin correlations. The\nresults apply to all 2D and 3D tri-coordinated materials with bond-directional\nanisotropy, and provide a consistent interpretation of the suppression of the\nx-ray magnetic circular dichroism signal reported recently for\n$\\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ under pressure.\n", "  Magnetization dynamics in thin film ferromagnets can be studied using a\ndispersive hydrodynamic formulation. The equations describing the\nmagnetodynamics map to a compressible fluid with broken Galilean invariance\nparametrized by the longitudinal spin density and a magnetic analog of the\nfluid velocity that define spin-density waves. A direct consequence of these\nequations is the determination of a magnetic Mach number. Micromagnetic\nsimulations reveal nucleation of nonlinear structures from an impenetrable\nobject realized by an applied magnetic field spot or a defect. In this work,\nmicromagnetic simulations demonstrate vortex-antivortex pair nucleation from an\nobstacle. Their interaction establishes either ordered or irregular\nvortex-antivortex complexes. Furthermore, when the magnetic Mach number exceeds\nunity (supersonic flow), a Mach cone and periodic wavefronts are observed,\nwhich can be well-described by solutions of the steady, linearized equations.\nThese results are reminiscent of theoretical and experimental observations in\nBose-Einstein condensates, and further supports the analogy between the\nmagnetodynamics of a thin film ferromagnet and compressible fluids. The\nnucleation of nonlinear structures and vortex-antivortex complexes using this\napproach enables the study of their interactions and effects on the stability\nof spin-density waves.\n", "  Finding microscopic models for metallic states that exhibit quantum critical\nproperties such as $\\omega/T$ scaling is a major theoretical challenge. We\ncalculate the local dynamical spin susceptibility $\\chi(T,\\omega)$ for a\nHubbard model at half filling using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory, which is exact\nin infinite dimensions. Qualitatively distinct behavior is found in the\ndifferent regions of the phase diagram: Mott insulator, Fermi liquid metal, bad\nmetal, and a quantum critical region above the finite temperature critical\npoint. The signature of the latter is $\\omega/T$ scaling where $T$ is the\ntemperature. Our results are consistent with previous results showing scaling\nof the dc electrical conductivity and are relevant to experiments on organic\ncharge transfer salts.\n", "  We proposed the discrete Euler top in 2000. In that paper, exact solutions\nand conserved quantities are described. However, a Lax pair of our proposed\ndiscrete Euler top is not contained. Moreover, the Lax pair is still unknown.\nIn this paper, from a generalized eigenvalue problem, we obtain the Lax pair of\nthe discrete Euler top. In addition, we introduce another Lax pair of the\ndiscrete Euler top in terms of quaternions.\n", "  We demonstrate that dispersion theory allows one to deduce crucial\ninformation on $\\pi\\eta$ scattering from the final-state interactions of the\nlight mesons visible in the spectral distributions of the decays $\\bar{B}^0_d\n\\to J/\\psi(\\pi^0\\eta,K^+K^-,K^0\\bar{K}^0)$. Thus high-quality measurements of\nthese differential observables are highly desired. The corresponding rates are\npredicted to be of the same order of magnitude as those for $\\bar{B}^0_d \\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ measured recently at LHCb, letting the corresponding\nmeasurement appear feasible.\n", "  The formation of basal/prismatic (BP) interfaces accompanying with the\nnucleation and growth of a reoriented crystal in Mg single-crystals under\nc-axis tension is investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The BP\ninterfaces nucleate by shuffling mechanism via local rearrangements of atoms.\nBoth two-layer disconnections and one-layer disconnections contribute to the\nmigration of BP interfaces. In a three-dimensional view, the BP interfaces\nrelatively tend to migrate towards the [1-210] direction rather than the\n[-1010]/[0001] direction since the misfit disconnection or misfit dislocation\ncaused by the accumulation of mismatch along the [-1010] /[0001] direction\nimpedes the disconnection movement. The BP interfaces can transform to the\n{10-12} twin boundary (TB) and vice versa. While the process from BP interface\nto TB is described as the linear pile-up of interface disconnections, the versa\ntransformation is proposed as the upright pile-up process. Both BP\ntransformation and {10-12} twinning can efficiently accommodate the strain\nalong the c-axis, and the conjugate BP interfaces and {10-12} TBs account for\nthe large deviations of twin interfaces from the {10-12} twin plane.\n", "  Many spin systems affected by critical slowing down can be efficiently\nsimulated using cluster algorithms. Where such systems have long-range\ninteractions, suitable formulations can additionally bring down the\ncomputational effort for each update from O($N^2$) to O($N\\ln N$) or even\nO($N$), thus promising an even more dramatic computational speed-up. Here, we\nreview the available algorithms and propose a new and particularly efficient\nsingle-cluster variant. The efficiency and dynamical scaling of the available\nalgorithms are investigated for the Ising model with power-law decaying\ninteractions.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological evolution of a scalar field with non standard\nkinetic term in terms of a Renormalization Group Equation (RGE). In this\nframework inflation corresponds to the slow evolution in a neighborhood of a\nfixed point and universality classes for inflationary models naturally arise.\nUsing some examples we show the application of the formalism. The predicted\nvalues for the speed of sound $c_s$ and for the amount of non-Gaussianities\nproduced in these models are discussed. In particular, we show that it is\npossible to introduce models with $c_s^2 \\neq 1$ that can be in agreement with\npresent cosmological observations.\n", "  We review some recent investigations of the 3d plaquette Ising model. This\ndisplays a strong first-order phase transition with unusual scaling properties\ndue to the size-dependent degeneracy of the low-temperature phase. In\nparticular, the leading scaling correction is modified from the usual inverse\nvolume behaviour 1/L^3 to 1/L^2. The degeneracy also has implications for the\nmagnetic order in the model which has an intermediate nature between local and\nglobal order and gives rise to novel fracton topological defects in a related\nquantum Hamiltonian.\n", "  This paper describes the algorithms for the reconstruction and identification\nof electrons in the central region of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC). These algorithms were used for all ATLAS results with electrons\nin the final state that are based on the 2012 pp collision data produced by the\nLHC at $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{s}}$ = 8 TeV. The efficiency of these algorithms,\ntogether with the charge misidentification rate, is measured in data and\nevaluated in simulated samples using electrons from $Z\\rightarrow ee$,\n$Z\\rightarrow ee\\gamma$ and $J/\\psi \\rightarrow ee$ decays. For these\nefficiency measurements, the full recorded data set, corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$, is used. Based on a new reconstruction\nalgorithm used in 2012, the electron reconstruction efficiency is 97% for\nelectrons with $E_\\mathrm{T}=15$ GeV and 99% at $E_\\mathrm{T} = 50$ GeV.\nCombining this with the efficiency of additional selection criteria to reject\nelectrons from background processes or misidentified hadrons, the efficiency to\nreconstruct and identify electrons at the ATLAS experiment varies from 65% to\n95%, depending on the transverse momentum of the electron and background\nrejection.\n", "  We investigate the binding transition of two flexible polymers grafted to a\nsteric surface with closeby end points. While free polymers show a\ndiscontinuous transition, grafting to a steric flat surface leads to a\ncontinuous binding transition. This is supported by results from Metropolis and\nparallel multicanonical simulations. A combination of canonical and\nmicrocanonical analyses reveals that the change in transition order can be\nunderstood in terms of the reduced translational entropy of the unbound\nhigh-temperature phase upon grafting.\n", "  Detecting the atmospheres of low-mass low-temperature exoplanets is a\nhigh-priority goal on the path to ultimately detect biosignatures in the\natmospheres of habitable exoplanets. High-precision HST observations of several\nsuper-Earths with equilibrium temperatures below 1000K have to date all\nresulted in featureless transmission spectra, which have been suggested to be\ndue to high-altitude clouds. We report the detection of an atmospheric feature\nin the atmosphere of a 1.6 Mearth transiting exoplanet, GJ 1132b, with an\nequilibrium temperature of ~600K and orbiting a nearby M dwarf. We present\nobservations of nine transits of the planet obtained simultaneously in the griz\nand JHK passbands. We find an average radius of 1.43 +/- 0.16 Rearth for the\nplanet, averaged over all the passbands, and a radius of 0.255 +/- 0.023 Rsun\nfor the star, both of which are significantly greater than previously found.\nThe planet radius can be decomposed into a \"surface radius\" at ~1.375 Rearth\noverlaid by atmospheric features which increase the observed radius in the z\nand K bands. The z-band radius is 4sigma higher than the continuum, suggesting\na strong detection of an atmosphere. We deploy a suite of tests to verify the\nreliability of the transmission spectrum, which are greatly helped by the\nexistence of repeat observations. The large z-band transit depth indicates\nstrong opacity from H2O and/or CH4 or a hitherto unconsidered opacity. A\nsurface radius of 1.375 +/- 0.16 Rearth allows for a wide range of interior\ncompositions ranging from a nearly Earth-like rocky interior, with ~70%\nsilicate and ~30% Fe, to a substantially H2O-rich water world.\n", "  We consider one dimensional diffusive search strategies subjected to external\npotentials. The location of a single target is drawn from a given probability\ndensity function (PDF) $f_G(x)$ and is fixed for each stochastic realization of\nthe process. We optimize the quality of the search strategy as measured by the\nmean first passage time (MFPT) to the position of the target. For a symmetric\nbut otherwise arbitrary distribution $f_G(x)$ we find the optimal potential\nthat minimizes the MFPT. The minimal MFPT is given by a nonstandard measure of\nthe dispersion, which can be related to the cumulative R\\'enyi entropy. We\ncompare optimal times in this model with optimal times obtained for the model\nof diffusion with stochastic resetting, in which the diffusive motion is\ninterrupted by intermittent jumps (resets) to the initial position.\nAdditionally, we discuss an analogy between our results and a so-called\nsquare-root principle.\n", "  The study of continuous phase transitions triggered by spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking has brought revolutionary ideas to physics. Recently, through the\ndiscovery of symmetry protected topological phases, it is realized that\ncontinuous quantum phase transition can also occur between states with the same\nsymmetry but different topology. Here we study a specific class of such phase\ntransitions in 1+1 dimensions -- the phase transition between bosonic\ntopological phases protected by $Z_n\\times Z_n$. We find in all cases the\ncritical point possesses two gap opening relevant operators: one leads to a\nLandau-forbidden symmetry breaking phase transition and the other to the\ntopological phase transition. We also obtained a constraint on the central\ncharge for general phase transitions between symmetry protected bosonic\ntopological phases in 1+1D.\n", "  Majorana zero modes are usually attributed to topological superconductors. We\nstudy a class of two-dimensional topologically trivial superconductors without\nchiral edge modes, which nevertheless host robust Majorana zero modes in\ntopological defects. The construction of this minimal single-band model is\nfacilitated by the Hopf map and the Hopf invariant. This work will stimulate\ninvestigations of Majorana zero modes in superconductors in the topologically\ntrivial regime.\n", "  We present a deep near-infrared spectrum of the Orion Bar Photodissociation\nRegion (PDR) taken with the Immersion Grating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) on\nthe 2.7 m telescope at the McDonald Observatory. IGRINS has high spectral\nresolution (R~45000) and instantaneous broad wavelength coverage (1.45-2.45\nmicrons), enabling us to detect 87 emission lines from rovibrationally excited\nmolecular hydrogen (H_2) that arise from transitions out of 69 upper\nrovibration levels of the electronic ground state. These levels cover a large\nrange of rotational and vibrational quantum numbers and excitation energies,\nmaking them an excellent probe of the excitation mechanisms of H_2 and physical\nconditions within the PDR. The Orion Bar PDR is thought to consist of cooler\nhigh density clumps or filaments (T=50-250 K, n_H = 10^5 - 10^7 cm^-3) embedded\nin a warmer lower density medium (T=250-1000 K, n_H=10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3). We fit\na grid of simple constant-temperature and constant-density Cloudy models, which\nrecreate the observed H_2 level populations well, to constrain the temperature\nto a range of 600 to 650 K and the density to n_H = 2.5 x 10^3 to 10^4 cm^-3.\nThe best fit model gives T = 625 K and n_H = 5x10^3 cm^-3. This well\nconstrained warm temperature is consistent with kinetic temperatures found by\nother studies for the Orion Bar's lower density medium. However, the range of\ndensities well fit by the model grid is marginally lower than those reported by\nother studies. We could be observing lower density gas than the surrounding\nmedium, or perhaps a density-sensitive parameter in our models is not properly\nestimated.\n", "  We consider a general stationary solution and derive the general laws for\naccretion of rotating perfect fluids. For non-degenerate and degenerate Fermi\nand Bose fluids we derive new effects that mimic the center-of-mass-energy\neffect of two colliding particle in the vicinity of horizons. Non-degenerate\nfluids see their chemical potential grow arbitrarily and ultra-relativistic\nFermi fluids see their specific enthalpy and Fermi momentum grow arbitrarily\ntoo while the latter vanishes gradually for non-relativistic Fermi fluids. For\ndegenerate Bose fluids two scenarios remain possible as the fluid approaches a\nhorizon: a) The Bose-Einstein condensation ceases or b) the temperature drops\ngradually down to zero.\n", "  We develop a new formalism to describe the inclusive production of small\nradius jets in heavy-ion collisions, which is consistent with jet calculations\nin the simpler proton-proton system. Only at next-to-leading order (NLO) and\nbeyond, the jet radius parameter $R$ and the jet algorithm dependence of the\njet cross section can be studied and a meaningful comparison to experimental\nmeasurements is possible. We are able to consistently achieve NLO accuracy by\nmaking use of the recently developed semi-inclusive jet functions within Soft\nCollinear Effective Theory (SCET). In addition, single logarithms of the jet\nsize parameter $\\alpha_s^n\\ln^n R$ are resummed to next-to-leading logarithmic\n(NLL$_R$) accuracy. The medium modified semi-inclusive jet functions are\nobtained within the framework of SCET with Glauber gluons that describe the\ninteraction of jets with the medium. We present numerical results for the\nsuppression of inclusive jet cross sections in heavy ion collisions at the LHC\nand the formalism developed here can be extended directly to corresponding jet\nsubstructure observables.\n", "  Multi-Application Solar Telescope (MAST) is a 50 cm off-axis Gregorian\ntelescope and started operational recently at Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO).\nFor understanding the evolution and dynamics of solar magnetic and velocity\nfields, an imaging spectropolarimeter is being developed as one of the back-end\ninstruments of MAST. This system consists of a narrow-band filter and a\npolarimeter. Polarimeter includes a linear polarizer and two sets of Liquid\nCrystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs). The instrument is intended for the\nsimultaneous observations in the spectral lines 617.3 nm and 854.2 nm, which\nare formed in photosphere and chromosphere, respectively. In this paper, we\npresent results from the characterization of the LCVRs for the spectral lines\nof interest and response matrix of the polarimeter. We also present preliminary\nobservations of an active region obtained using the spectropolarimeter. For\nverification, we compare the Stokes observations of the active region obtained\nfrom Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO) with that of MAST observations in the spectral line 617.3 nm. We found\ngood agreement between both the observations, considering the fact that MAST\nobservations are seeing limited.\n", "  S. J. van Enk and R. Pike in PRA 66, 024306 (2002), argue that the\nequilibrium solution to a quantum game isn't unique but is already present in\nthe classical game itself. In this work, we debunk this assertion by showing\nthat a random strategy in a particular quantum (Hawk-Dove) game is unique to\nthe quantum game. In other words the equilibrium solution of the quantum\nHawk-Dove game can not be obtained in the classical Hawk-Dove game. Moreover,\nwe provide an analytical solution to the quantum $2\\times2$ strategic form\nHawk-Dove game using random mixed strategies. The random strategies which we\ndescribe are evolutionary stable implying both Pareto optimality and Nash\nequilibrium with their payoff's classically unobtainable.\n", "  In this paper strain transfer efficiencies from single crystalline\npiezoelectric lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) substrate to a GaAs\nsemiconductor membrane bonded on top are investigated using state-of-the-art\nx-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques and finite-element-method (FEM) simulations.\nTwo different bonding techniques are studied, namely gold-thermo-compression\nand polymer-based SU8 bonding. Our results show a much higher strain-transfer\nfor the \"soft\" SU8 bonding in comparison to the \"hard\" bonding via\ngold-thermo-compression. A comparison between the XRD results and FEM\nsimulations allows to explain this unexpected result with the presence of\ncomplex interface structures between the different layers.\n", "  We show how to use quantum metrology to detect a wormhole. A coherent state\nof the electromagnetic field experiences a phase shift with a slight dependence\non the throat radius of a possible distant wormhole. We show that this tiny\ncorrection is, in principle, detectable by homodyne measurements after long\npropagation lengths for a wide range of throat radii and distances to the\nwormhole, even if the detection takes place very far away from the throat,\nwhere the spacetime is very close to a flat geometry. We use realistic\nparameters from state-of-the-art long-baseline laser interferometry, both\nEarth-based and space-borne. The scheme is, in principle, robust to optical\nlosses and initial mixedness.\n", "  We study the conditions required to produce self-sustained detonations in\nturbulent, carbon-oxygen degenerate plasma at low densities.\n  We perform a series of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nturbulence driven with various degrees of compressibility. The average\nconditions in the simulations are representative of models of merging binary\nwhite dwarfs.\n  We find that material with very short ignition times is abundant in the case\nthat turbulence is driven compressively. This material forms contiguous\nstructures that persist over many ignition times, and that we identify as\nprospective detonation kernels. Detailed analysis of prospective kernels\nreveals that these objects are centrally-condensed and their shape is\ncharacterized by low curvature, supportive of self-sustained detonations. The\nkey characteristic of the newly proposed detonation mechanism is thus high\ndegree of compressibility of turbulent drive.\n  The simulated detonation kernels have sizes notably smaller than the spatial\nresolution of any white dwarf merger simulation performed to date. The\nresolution required to resolve kernels is 0.1 km. Our results indicate a high\nprobability of detonations in such well-resolved simulations of carbon-oxygen\nwhite dwarf mergers. These simulations will likely produce detonations in\nsystems of lower total mass, thus broadening the population of white dwarf\nbinaries capable of producing Type Ia supernovae. Consequently, we expect a\ndownward revision of the lower limit of the total merger mass that is capable\nof producing a prompt detonation.\n  We review application of the new detonation mechanism to various explosion\nscenarios of single, Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics cannot explain the dominance of matter\nover anti-matter in our Universe. In many model extensions this is a very\nnatural consequence of neutrinos being their own anti-particles (Majorana\nparticles) which implies that a lepton number violating radioactive decay named\nneutrinoless double beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$) decay should exist. The detection\nof this extremely rare hypothetical process requires utmost suppression of any\nkind of backgrounds.\n  The GERDA collaboration searches for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge\n($^{76}\\rm{Ge} \\rightarrow\\,^{76}\\rm{Se} + 2e^-$) by operating bare detectors\nmade from germanium with enriched $^{76}$Ge fraction in liquid argon. Here, we\nreport on first data of GERDA Phase II. A background level of $\\approx10^{-3}$\ncts/(keV$\\cdot$kg$\\cdot$yr) has been achieved which is the world-best if\nweighted by the narrow energy-signal region of germanium detectors. Combining\nPhase I and II data we find no signal and deduce a new lower limit for the\nhalf-life of $5.3\\cdot10^{25}$ yr at 90 % C.L. Our sensitivity of\n$4.0\\cdot10^{25}$ yr is competitive with the one of experiments with\nsignificantly larger isotope mass.\n  GERDA is the first $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiment that will be background-free\nup to its design exposure. This progress relies on a novel active veto system,\nthe superior germanium detector energy resolution and the improved background\nrecognition of our new detectors. The unique discovery potential of an\nessentially background-free search for $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay motivates a\nlarger germanium experiment with higher sensitivity.\n", "  We have determined the thermal conductance of a system consisting of a\ntwo-level atom coupled to two quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with heat\nreservoirs at distinct temperatures. The calculation of the heat flux as well\nas the atomic population and the rate of entropy production are obtained by the\nuse of a quantum Fokker-Planck-Kramers equation and by a Lindblad master\nequation. The calculations are performed for small values of the coupling\nconstant. The results coming from both approaches show that the conductance is\nproportional to the coupling constant squared and that, at high temperatures,\nit is proportional to the inverse of temperature.\n", "  The role of the a_1(1420) resonance in the three-pion decays of the tau\nlepton is investigated using a phenomenological model. For all data before\n2008, roughly equal fit quality is achieved when the basic a_1(1260) resonance\nis supplemented with either a_1(1640) or a_1(1420). However, two recent and\nmore precise data sets require resonances with masses that are not very far\nfrom that of a_1(1420). This suggests that the axial-vector resonance that\naccompanies the a_1(1260) in the three-pion decays of the tauon is a_1(1420),\nnot a_1(1640), as believed up to now. More data are needed to demonstrate this\ndefinitely.\n", "  All-carbon heterostructures have been produced recently via focused ion beam\npatterning of single layer graphene. Amorphized graphene is similar to a\ngraphene sheet in which some hexagons are replaced by a combination of\npentagonal, heptagonal and octagonal rings. The present investigation provides\na general view regarding phonon and load transfer along amorphous graphene. The\ndeveloped models for the evaluation of mechanical and thermal conductivity\nproperties yield accurate results for pristine graphene and acquired findings\nfor amorphized graphene films are size independent. Our atomistic results show\nthat amorphous graphene sheets could exhibit a remarkably high elastic modulus\nof ~500 GPa and tensile strengths of ~50 GPa at room temperature. However, our\nresults show that mechanical properties of amorphous graphene decline at higher\ntemperatures. Furthermore, we show that amorphized graphene present a low\nthermal conductivity ~15 W/mK which is two orders of magnitude smaller than\npristine graphene, and we verify that its thermal conductivity is almost\ninsensitive to temperature since it is dominated by phonon-defect scattering\nrather than phonon-phonon scattering. Finally, our results show that amorphized\ngraphene structures present a remarkably high elastic modulus and mechanical\nstrength, along with a low thermal conductivity, which is an unusual\ncombination for carbon-based materials.\n", "  We developed a combined atomistic-continuum hierarchical multiscale approach\nto explore the effective thermal conductivity of graphene laminates. To this\naim, we first performed molecular dynamics simulations in order to study the\nheat conduction at atomistic level. Using the non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics method, we evaluated the length dependent thermal conductivity of\ngraphene as well as the thermal contact conductance between two individual\ngraphene sheets. In the next step, based on the results provided by the\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we constructed finite element models of\ngraphene laminates to probe the effective thermal conductivity at macroscopic\nlevel. A similar methodology was also developed to study the thermal\nconductivity of laminates made from hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) films. In\nagreement with recent experimental observations, our multiscale modeling\nconfirms that the flake size is the main factor that affects the thermal\nconductivity of graphene and h-BN laminates. Provided information by the\nproposed multiscale approach could be used to guide experimental studies to\nfabricate laminates with tunable thermal conduction properties.\n", "  We extract polarized parton distribution functions (PPDFs), referred to as\n\"KTA17,\" together with the highly correlated strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ from\nrecent and up-to-date $g_1$ and $g_2$ polarized structure functions world data\nat next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. The stability and\nreliability of the results are ensured by including nonperturbative target mass\ncorrections as well as higher-twist terms which are particularly important at\nthe large-$x$ region at low Q$^2$. Their role in extracting the PPDFs in the\nnucleon is studied. Sum rules are discussed and compared with other results\nfrom the literature. This analysis is made by means of the Jacobi polynomials\nexpansion technique to the DGLAP evolution. The uncertainties on the\nobservables and on the PPDFs throughout this paper are computed using standard\nHessian error propagation which served to provide a more realistic estimate of\nthe PPDFs uncertainties.\n", "  We provide a general construction of convex roof measures of coherence. This\nconstruction is based on arbitrary coherence measures of pure states in the\nframework of resource theory of coherence. Convex roof measures of coherence\nbound from above all possible coherence measures, given specific valid\nquantifications of pure states.\n", "  Background: Over the past few decades, numerous forecasting methods have been\nproposed in the field of epidemic forecasting. Such methods can be classified\ninto different categories such as deterministic vs. probabilistic, comparative\nmethods vs. generative methods, and so on. In some of the more popular\ncomparative methods, researchers compare observed epidemiological data from\nearly stages of an outbreak with the output of proposed models to forecast the\nfuture trend and prevalence of the pandemic. A significant problem in this area\nis the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best\nalgorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible\nconfiguration for a particular algorithm.\n  Results: In this paper, we present an evaluation framework which allows for\ncombining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate\nforecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to\ncharacterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error\nmeasures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with\nrespect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than\nshort-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by\nevaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United\nStates. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different\nrankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show\nthat no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features, when\nevaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various\nconsensus ranking schema that summarizes individual rankings, thus accounting\nfor different error measures. We believe that a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational\nepidemiology community.\n", "  A novel bilayer is introduced, consisting of a stiff film adhered to a soft\nsubstrate with patterned holes beneath the film and substrate interface. To\nuncover the transition of surface patterns, two dimensional plane strain\nsimulations are performed on the defected bilayer subjected to uniaxial\ncompression. Although the substrate is considered as the linear elastic\nmaterial, the presence of defects can directly trigger the formation of locally\nridged and then folding configurations from flat surface with a relatively\nsmall compressive strain. It is followed by the coexisting phases of folds and\nwrinkles under further overall compression. This phase transition reverses the\ntraditional transition of wrinkle to ridge or fold for defect free substrates.\nIt is also found that the onset of initial bifurcation is highly dependent on\nthe spatial configuration and geometries of holes, since the interaction of\ndefects allows more strain relief mechanisms beyond wrinkling. Furthermore, a\nrich diversity of periodic surface topologies, including overall waves,\nlocalizations, saw like and coexisting features of folds and wrinkles can be\nobtained by varying the diameter, depth and spacing of holes as well as\ncompressive strain, which provides a potential approach to engineer various\nsurface patterns for applications.\n", "  Pimple is one of the most common skin diseases for humans. The mechanical\nmodeling of pimple growth is very limited. A finite element model is developed\nto quantify the deformation field with the expansion of follicle, and then the\nmechanical stimulus is related to the sensation of pain during the development\nof pimple. Through these models, parametric studies show the dependence of\nmechanical stimulus and pain level on the pimple-surrounded structures,\nfollicle depth and mechanical properties of the epidermis. The findings in this\npaper may provide useful insights on prevention or pain relief of pimples, as\nwell as those related to cosmetics and other tissue growth.\n", "  This note is a short summary of the workshop on \"Energy and time measurements\nwith high-granular silicon devices\" that took place on the 13/6/16 and the\n14/6/16 at DESY/Hamburg in the frame of the first AIDA-2020 Annual Meeting.\nThis note tries to put forward trends that could be spotted and to emphasise in\nparticular open issues that were addressed by the speakers.\n", "  We investigate the elastic scattering of $^9$Be on $^{208}$Pb at beam\nenergies above (50 MeV) and below (40 MeV) the Coulomb barrier. The reaction is\ndescribed within a four-body framework using the Continuum-Discretized\nCoupled-Channels (CDCC) method. The $^9$Be projectile states are generated\nusing the analytical Transformed Harmonic Oscillator (THO) basis in\nhyperspherical coordinates. Our calculations confirm the importance of\ncontinuum effects at low energies.\n", "  We consider the statistical properties of interaction parameter estimates\nobtained by the direct coupling analysis (DCA) approach to learning\ninteractions from large data sets. Assuming that the data are generated from a\nrandom background distribution, we determine the distribution of inferred\ninteractions. Two inference methods are considered: the L2 regularized naive\nmean-field inference procedure (regularized least squares, RLS), and the\npseudo-likelihood maximization (plmDCA). For RLS we also study a model where\nthe data matrix elements are real numbers, identically and independently\ngenerated from a Gaussian distribution; in this setting we analytically find\nthat the distribution of the inferred interactions is Gaussian. For data of\nBoolean type, more realistic in practice, the inferred interactions do not\ngenerally follow a Gaussian. However, extensive numerical simulations indicate\nthat their distribution can be characterized by a single function determined by\na few system parameters after normalization by the standard deviation. This\nproperty holds for both RLS and plmDCA and may be exploitable for inferring the\ndistribution of extremely large interactions from simulations for smaller\nsystem sizes.\n", "  This paper is a comment on the paper \"Quantum Mechanics and Algorithmic\nRandomness\" was written by Ulvi Yurtsever \\cite{Yurtsever} and the briefly\nexplanation of the algorithmic randomness of quantum measurements results.\n  There are differences between the computability of probability sources, (\nwhich means there is an algorithm that can define the way that random process\nor probability source generates the numbers ) and the algorithmic randomness of\nthe sequences or strings which are produced by a source. We may have the source\nwithout a computable algorithm for that but it can produce compressible or\nincompressible strings. For example, so far there is no computable algorithm\nthat can define the abstract meaning of randomness even the easiest one,\nBernoulli probability distribution. Historically and philosophically there many\nscientist believe the existence of the algorithm for a random process is a\ncontradiction because in their opinion, in the definition of a random variable,\nimplicitly assumed that there is no reason for the happening of an event and we\njust know the probabilities. There is however no need to enter into this matter\nhere. As in the paper mentioned, all the algorithms for simulating a random\nprocess try to pass the statistical tests and be close to the abstract meaning\nof it.\n", "  Two strategies for enhancing photovoltaic (PV) performance in chalcopyrite\nsolar cells were investigated: Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers with low K content\n(K/(K+Cu), or x ~ 0.07) distributed throughout the bulk, and CuIn1-yGaySe2\nabsorbers with KIn1-yGaySe2 grown on their surfaces. For the Ga-free case,\nincreased temperature improved PV performance in the KInSe2 surface absorbers,\nbut not in the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers. Growth temperature also increased\nKInSe2 phase fraction, relative to Cu1-xKxInSe2 alloys-evidence that surface\nKInSe2 improved performance more than bulk KInSe2. Surface KIn1-yGaySe2 and\nbulk x ~ 0.07 Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 films with Ga/(Ga+In), or y of 0.3 and 0.5\nalso had improved efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF),\nrelative to CuIn1-yGaySe2 baselines. On the other hand, y ~ 1 absorbers did not\nbenefit from K introduction. Similar to Cu1-xKxInSe2, the formation of\nCu1-xKxGaSe2 alloys was favored at low temperatures and high substrate Na\ncontent, relative to the formation of mixed-phase CuGaSe2 + KGaSe2.\nKIn1-yGaySe2 alloys were grown for the first time, as evidenced by X-ray\ndiffraction and ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. For all Ga/(Ga+In)\ncompositions, the surface KIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers had superior PV performance in\nbuffered and buffer-free devices. However, the bulk x ~ 0.07 absorbers only\noutperformed the baselines in buffered devices. The data demonstrate that\nKIn1-yGaySe2 passivates the surface of CuIn1-yGaySe2 to increase efficiency,\nVOC, and FF, while bulk Cu1-xKxIn1-yGaySe2 absorbers with x ~ 0.07 enhance\nefficiency, VOC, and FF by some other mechanism.\n", "  The nuclear shell model assumes an effective mean-field plus interaction\nHamiltonian in a specific configuration space. We want to understand how\nvarious interaction matrix elements affect the observables, the collectivity in\nnuclei and the nuclear level density for odd-A and odd-odd nuclei. Using the sd\nand pf shells, we vary specific groups of matrix elements and study the\nevolution of energy levels, transition rates and the level density. In all\ncases studied, a transition between a \"normal\" and a collective phase is\ninduced, accompanied by an enhancement of the level density in the collective\nphase. In distinction to neighboring even-even nuclei, the enhancement of the\nlevel density is observed already at the transition point. The collective phase\nis reached when the single-particle transfer matrix elements are dominant in\nthe shell model Hamiltonian, providing a sign of their fundamental role.\n", "  LHD inward-shifted configurations are unstable to resistive MHD\npressure-gradient-driven modes. These modes drive sawtooth like events during\nLHD operation. In this work, we simulate sawtooth like activity and internal\ndisruptions in order to improve the understanding of these relaxation events\nand their effect over the device efficiency to confine the plasma, with the aim\nto improve the LHD present and future operation scenarios minimizing or\navoiding the disadvantageous MHD soft and hard limits. By solving a set of\nreduced non-linear resistive MHD equations, we have studied the evolution of\nperturbations to equilibria obtained before and after a sawtooth like event in\nLHD. The equilibrium $\\beta$ value is gradually increased during the simulation\nuntil it reaches the experimental value. Sawtooth like events and internal\ndisruption events take place in the simulation for $\\beta_{0}$ values between\n$1\\%$ and $1.48\\%$. The main driver of the sawtooth like events is the resonant\nand non-resonant effect of the $(n=1, m=3)$ mode. The instability is stronger\nfor resonant events, and they only appear when $\\beta_{0} = 1.48 \\%$. Internal\ndisruptions are mainly driven by the $(n=1, m=2)$ mode, and they extend\nthroughout the whole plasma core. Internal disruption events do not show up\nwhen resonant sawtooth like events are triggered.\n", "  Phagraphene is a novel 2D carbon allotrope with interesting electronic\nproperties which has been recently theoretically proposed. Phagraphene is\nsimilar to a defective graphene structure with an arrangement of pentagonal,\nheptagonal and hexagonal rings. In this study we investigate thermal\nconductivity and mechanical properties of phagraphene using molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Using the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method, we found the\nthermal conductivity of phagraphene to be anisotropic, with room temperature\nvalues of $218 \\pm 20$ W/m-K along the armchair direction and $285 \\pm 29$\nW/m-K along the zigzag direction. Both values are one order of magnitude\nsmaller than pristine graphene. Analysis of phonon group velocities also shows\na significant reduction in this quantity for phagraphene in comparison to\ngraphene. By performing uniaxial tensile simulations, we studied the\ndeformation process and mechanical response of phagraphene. We found that\nphagraphene exhibits a remarkable high tensile strength around $85 \\pm 2$ GPa,\nwhereas its elastic modulus is also anisotropic along in-plane directions, with\nvalues of $870 \\pm 15$ GPa and $800 \\pm 14$ GPa for armchair and zigzag\ndirections respectively. The lower thermal conductivity of phagraphene along\nwith its predicted electronic properties suggests that it could be a better\ncandidate than graphene in future carbon-based thermoelectric devices.\n", "  LHD inward-shifted configurations are unstable to resistive MHD\npressure-gradient-driven modes. Sawtooth like activity was observed during LHD\noperation. The main drivers are the unstable modes $1/2$ and $1/3$ in the\nmiddle and inner plasma region which limit the plasma confinement efficiency of\nLHD advanced operation scenarios. The aim of the present research is to study\nthe hard MHD limit of $1/2$ sawtooth like activity, not observed yet in LHD\noperation, and to predict its effects on the device performance. Previous\ninvestigations pointed out this system relaxation can be an internal disruption\n[J. Varela et al, internal disruptions and sawtooth like activity in LHD, 38 th\nEPS Conference on Plasma Physics, 2011, P5.077]. In the present work, we\nsimulate an internal disruption; we study the equilibria properties before and\nafter the disruptive process, its effects on the plasma confinement efficiency\nduring each disruptive phase, the relation between the $n/m = 1/2$ hard MHD\nevents and the soft MHD events and how to avoid or reduce their adverse\neffects. The simulation conclusions point out that the large stochastic region\nin the middle plasma strongly deforms and tears the flux surfaces when the\npressure gradient increases above the hard MHD limit. If the instability\nreaches the inner plasma, the iota profiles will be perturbed near the plasma\ncore and three magnetic islands can appear near the magnetic axis. If the\ninstability is strong enough to link the stochastic regions in the middle\nplasma (around the half minor radius $\\rho$) and the plasma core ($\\rho <\n0.25$), an internal disruption is driven.\n", "  We adapt the well-known spectral decimation technique for computing spectra\nof Laplacians on certain symmetric self-similar sets to the case of magnetic\nSchrodinger operators and work through this method completely for the diamond\nlattice fractal. This connects results of physicists from the 1980's, who used\nsimilar techniques to compute spectra of sequences of magnetic operators on\ngraph approximations to fractals but did not verify existence of a limiting\nfractal operator, to recent work describing magnetic operators on fractals via\nfunctional analytic techniques.\n", "  This paper proposes a new definition of science based on the distinction\nbetween the activity of scientists and the product of that activity: the former\nis denoted (lower-case) science and the latter (upper-case) Science. These\ndefinitions are intended to clarify the nature of scientific knowledge, its\nauthority as well as its limitations, and how scientific knowledge differs from\nother forms of human knowledge. The body of knowledge we call Science is\nexemplified by elementary arithmetic: it has the following properties: (i)\nScience is collective, public knowledge; (ii) Science is universal and free of\ncontradiction; (iii) Science emerges from science; (iv) Science is nevertheless\nbathed in ignorance and subject to change. These properties imply that many\nquestions that are of great interest to humanity are out of reach to Science,\nsince they necessarily involve individual and group commitments and beliefs.\nExamples are questions of ethics, religion, politics, art and even technology,\nfor which diversity is a fundamental virtue.\n", "  The era of interferometric observations leads to the need of a more and more\nprecise description of physical structures and dynamics of star-forming\nregions, from pre-stellar cores to protoplanetary discs. The molecular emission\ncan be traced in multiple physical components such as infalling envelopes,\noutflows and protoplanetary discs. To compare with the observations, a precise\nand complex radiative transfer modelling of these regions is needed. We present\nGASS (Generator of Astrophysical Sources Structure), a code that allows us to\ngenerate the three-dimensional (3D) physical structure model of astrophysical\nsources. From the GASS graphical interface, the user easily creates different\ncomponents such as spherical envelopes, outflows and discs. The physical\nproperties of these components are modelled thanks to dedicated graphical\ninterfaces that display various figures in order to help the user and\nfacilitate the modelling task. For each component, the code randomly generates\npoints in a 3D grid with a sample probability weighted by the molecular\ndensity. The created models can be used as the physical structure input for 3D\nradiative transfer codes to predict the molecular line or continuum emission.\nAn analysis of the output hyper-spectral cube given by such radiative transfer\ncode can be made directly in GASS using the various post-treatment options\nimplemented, such as calculation of moments or convolution with a beam. This\nmakes GASS well suited to model and analyse both interferometric and\nsingle-dish data. This paper is focused on the results given by the association\nof GASS and LIME, a 3D radiative transfer code, and we show that the complex\ngeometry observed in star-forming regions can be adequately handled by\nGASS+LIME.\n", "  The optimization of LHD discharges in inward-shifted configurations with\n$1/3$ sawtooth like activity is an open issue. These relaxation events limit\nthe LHD performance driving a periodic plasma deconfinement. The aim of this\nstudy is to analyze the $1/3$ sawtooth like activity in plasmas with different\nstability properties to foreseen the best operation conditions and minimize its\nundesired effects. We summarize the results of several MHD simulations for\nplasmas with Lundquist numbers between $10^5$ and $10^6$ in the slow\nreconnection regime, studying the equilibria properties during the onset of a\nchain of $1/3$ sawtooth like events. The research conclusions point out that\nthe hard MHD limit can be reached in the inner plasma region after the onset of\na strong $1/3$ resonant sawtooth like event and trigger a plasma collapse. The\ncollapse can be avoided if the system remains in the soft MHD limit, namely in\na regime with a pressure gradient and a magnetic turbulence below the critical\nvalues to drive the soft-hard MHD transition. In the soft MHD limit the system\nrelaxations are the non resonant $1/3$ sawtooth like events or a weak version\nof the $1/3$ resonant sawtooth like events. A system relaxation in the soft MHD\nregime drives a minor plasma deconfinement that doesn't limit the LHD\nperformance if the event periodicity is not very high.\n", "  The aim of this study is to analyze the feedback process between the magnetic\nturbulence and the pressure gradients in LHD inward-shifted configurations as\nwell as its role in the transition between the soft-hard MHD regimes for\ninstabilities driven by the mode $1/2$ in the middle plasma. In the present\npaper we summarize the results of two simulations with different Lundquist\nnumbers, $S = 2.5 \\times 10^5$ and $10^6$, assuming a plasma in the slow\nreconnection regime. The results for the high Lundquist number simulation shows\nthat the magnetic turbulence and the pressure gradient in the middle plasma\nregion of LHD are below the critical value to drive the transition to the hard\nMHD regime, therefore only relaxations in the soft MHD limit are triggered\n($1/2$ sawtooth like events) [Phys. Plasmas 19, 082512 (2012)]. In the case of\nthe simulation with low Lundquist number, the system reaches the hard MHD limit\nand a plasma collapse is observed.\n", "  The interactions of gravitons with spin-1 matter are calculated in parallel\nwith the well known photon case. It is shown that graviton scattering\namplitudes can be factorized into a product of familiar electromagnetic forms,\nand cross sections for various reactions are straightforwardly evaluated using\nhelicity methods. Universality relations are identified. Extrapolation to zero\nmass yields scattering amplitudes for photon-graviton and graviton-graviton\nscattering. The phenomenon of light bending near a massive object, which is\ngenerally treated using classical general relativity, is discussed from\nalternative points of view.\n", "  Formation, emission and lasing properties of strain-free InP(As)/AlInAs\nquantum dots (QDs) embedded in AlInAs microdisk (MD) cavity were investigated\nusing transmission electron microscopy and photoluminescence (PL) techniques.\nIn MD structures, the QDs having nano-pan-cake shape have height of ~2 nm,\nlateral size of 20-50 nm and density of ~5x109 cm-2. Their emission observed at\n~940 nm revealed strong temperature quenching, which points to exciton\ndecomposition. It also showed unexpected type-I character indicating In-As\nintermixing, as confirmed by band structure calculations. We observed lasing of\nInP(As) QD excitons into whispering gallery modes in MD having dimeter ~3.2 mkm\nand providing free spectral range of ~27 nm and quality factors up to Q~13000.\nThreshold of ~50 W/cm2 and spontaneous emission coupling coefficient of ~0.2\nwere measured for this MD-QD system.\n", "  We present hydrodynamic and magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of liquid sodium\nflow with the PLUTO compressible MHD code to investigate influence of magnetic\nboundary conditions on the collimation of helicoidal motions. We use a\nsimplified cartesian geometry to represent the flow dynamics in the vicinity of\none cavity of a multi-blades impeller inspired by those used in the\nVon-K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n-Sodium (VKS) experiment. We show that the impinging of the\nlarge scale flow upon the impeller generates a coherent helicoidal vortex\ninside the blades, located at a distance from the upstream blade piloted by the\nincident angle of the flow. This vortex collimates any existing magnetic field\nlines leading to an enhancement of the radial magnetic field that is stronger\nfor ferromagnetic than for conducting blades. The induced magnetic field\nmodifies locally the velocity fluctuations, resulting in an enhanced helicity.\nThis process possibly explains why dynamo action is more easily triggered in\nthe VKS experiment when using soft iron impellers.\n", "  This paper begins with a theoretical explanation of why spacetime is\ndiscrete. The derivation shows that there exists an elementary length which is\nessentially Planck's length. We then show how the existence of this length\naffects time dilation in special relativity. We next consider the symmetry\ngroup for discrete spacetime. This symmetry group gives a discrete version of\nthe usual Lorentz group. However, it is much simpler and is actually a discrete\nversion of the rotation group. From the form of the symmetry group we deduce a\npossible explanation for the structure of elementary particle classes.\nEnergy-momentum space is introduced and mass operators are defined. Discrete\nversions of the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are derived. The final section\nconcerns discrete quantum field theory. Interaction Hamiltonians and scattering\noperators are considered. In particular, we study the scalar spin~0 and spin~1\nbosons as well as the spin~$1/2$ fermion cases\n", "  Using results of our exact description of the spinless fermion motion in a\nnonhomogeneous magnetic field \\( {\\bf B} = B( 0, 0, 1/cosh^{2}( \\frac{x-x_{0}}{\n\\delta })) \\) we study a gas of these particles moving in this field. For lower\ndensities \\( \\nu < \\nu_{c}(B, \\delta ) \\) the corresponding total energy is\nlower than that of the uniform field state. Thus when the density of anyons\ndecreases a transition from the uniform statistical field state to the\nnonhomogeneous field state is predicted.\n", "  Silicene offers an ideal platform for exploring the phase transition due to\nstrong spin-orbit interaction and its unique structure with strong tunability.\nWith applied electric field and circularly polarized light, siliccene is\npredicted to exhibit rich phases. We propose that these intricate phase\ntransitions can be detected by measuring the bulk Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\n(RKKY) interaction. We have in detail analyzed the dependence of RKKY\ninteraction on phase parameters for different impurity configurations along\nzigzag direction. Importantly, we present an interesting comparison between\ndifferent terms of RKKY interaction with phase diagram. It is found that the\nin-plane and out-of-plane terms can exhibit the local extreme value or change\nof sign at the phase critical point and remarkable difference in magnitude for\ndifferent phase regions. Consequently, the magnetic measurement provides\nunambiguous signatures to identify various types of phase transition\nsimultaneously, which can be carried out with present technique.\n", "  We review the algebraic Bethe ansatz for the Heisenberg model. The exposition\nincludes some of recent advancements with emphasis on a relation with the\nrigged configurations.\n  We also provide somewhat thorough review of the crystal bases and the rigged\nconfigurations. In particular, we provide the inverse scattering transform for\nthe type $D^{(1)}_n$ box-ball systems. We also provide a reformulation of a\nresult of arXiv:0711.4185.\n", "  This article deals with the spectra of Laplacians of weighted graphs. In this\ncontext, two objects are of fundamental importance for the dynamics of complex\nnetworks: the second eigenvalue of such a spectrum (called algebraic\nconnectivity) and its associated eigenvector, the so-called Fiedler vector.\nHere we prove that, given a Laplacian matrix, it is possible to perturb the\nweights of the existing edges in the underlying graph in order to obtain simple\neigenvalues and a Fiedler vector composed of only non-zero entries. These\nstructural genericity properties with the constraint of not adding edges in the\nunderlying graph are stronger than the classical ones, for which arbitrary\nstructural perturbations are allowed. These results open the opportunity to\nunderstand the impact of structural changes on the dynamics of complex systems.\n", "  Theory testing in the physical sciences has been revolutionized in recent\ndecades by Bayesian approaches to probability theory. Here, I will consider\nBayesian approaches to theory extensions, that is, theories like inflation\nwhich aim to provide a deeper explanation for some aspect of our models (in\nthis case, the standard model of cosmology) that seem unnatural or fine-tuned.\nIn particular, I will consider how cosmologists can test the multiverse using\nobservations of this universe.\n", "  Shot noise is a powerful tool to probe correlations and microscopic transport\ndetails that conductance measurements alone cannot reveal. Even in atomic-scale\nAu devices that are well described by Landauer-B{\\\"u}ttiker physics,\ncomplications remain such as local heating and electron-phonon interactions. We\nreport systematic rf measurements of shot noise in individual atomic-scale gold\nbreak junctions at multiple temperatures, with most bias voltages well above\nthe energy of the Au optical phonon mode. Motivated by the previous\nexperimental evidence that electron-phonon interactions can modify Fano factors\nand result in kinked features in bias dependence of shot noise, we find that\nthe temperature dependence of shot noise from 4.2~K to 100~K is minimal.\nEnhanced Fano factors near 0.5$~G_0$ and features beyond simply linear bias\ndependence of shot noise near the 1$~G_0$ plateau are observed. Both are\nbelieved to have non-interacting origins and the latter likely results from\nslightly bias-dependent transmittance of the dominant quantum channel.\n", "  In this investigation, we outline an enveloping models methodology for\nestimating structural uncertainty bounds on RANS closures. This methodology\nincorporates both eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbations in the spectral\nrepresentation of the Reynolds stress tensor. The underlying rationale of this\nenveloping models methodology are explicated in detail and the mathematical\nnuances are outlined. This methodology is validated via its application to a\ncanonical case of separated turbulent flow, while contrasted against numerical\ndata. It is exhibited that this procedure is able to provide prudent estimates\non the uncertainty of quantities of interest. Furthermore, uncertainty bounds\nof engineering utility can be engendered using just two specific RANS\nsimulations, minimizing the computational overheads associated with uncertainty\nestimation. Thence, this methodology is applied to a supersonic axisymmetric\n\"submerged\" jet flow. The epistemic uncertainty envelopes are contrasted\nagainst the aleatoric uncertainty bounds predicated upon the predictions of the\nRANS closure. The methodology is able to provide satisfactory results for this\nhigh-speed flow.\n", "  Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been shown to be of use in\na disparate range of fields ranging from astronomy to optical trapping, and as\na promising new dimension for multiplexing signals in optical communications\nand data storage. A challenge to many of these applications is a reliable and\ndynamic method that sorts incident OAM states without altering them. Here we\nreport a wavelength-independent technique capable of dynamically filtering\nindividual OAM states based on the resonant transmission of a tunable optical\ncavity. The cavity length is piezo-controlled to facilitate dynamic\nreconfiguration, and the sorting process leaves both the transmitted and\nreflected signals in their original states for subsequent processing. As a\nresult, we also show that a reconfigurable sorting network can be constructed\nby cascading such optical resonators to handle multiple OAM states\nsimultaneously. This approach to sorting OAM states is amenable to integration\ninto optical communication networks and has implications in quantum optics,\nastronomy, optical data storage and optical trapping.\n", "  Online social media have become an integral part of our social beings.\nAnalyzing conversations in social media platforms can lead to complex\nprobabilistic models to understand social interaction networks. In this paper,\nwe present a modeling approach for characterizing social interaction networks\nby jointly inferring user communities and interests based on social media\ninteractions. We present several pattern inference models: i) Interest pattern\nmodel (IPM) captures population level interaction topics, ii) User interest\npattern model (UIPM) captures user specific interaction topics, and iii)\nCommunity interest pattern model (CIPM) captures both community structures and\nuser interests. We test our methods on Twitter data collected from Purdue\nUniversity community. From our model results, we observe the interaction topics\nand communities related to two big events within Purdue University community,\nnamely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue\nUniversity as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016. Constructing social\ninteraction networks based on user interactions accounts for the similarity of\nusers' interactions on various topics of interest and indicates their community\nbelonging further beyond connectivity. We observed that the\ndegree-distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of\nthe existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions,\nand many other nodes with less interactions. We also discuss the application of\nsuch networks as a useful tool to effectively disseminate specific information\nto the target audience towards planning any large-scale events and demonstrate\nhow to single out specific nodes in a given community by running network\nalgorithms.\n", "  In this talk I update the precision determination of the CKM element\n$|V_{cb}|$ from the inclusive decay $B\\to X_c\\ell\\nu_{\\ell}$.\n", "  Polarization of optical starlight and far-infrared thermal dust emission due\nto alignment of interstellar grains offers a powerful window to study magnetic\nfields in the various astrophysical environments, from the diffuse interstellar\nmedium to accretion disks surrounding young stars. Precision cosmology requires\naccurate model of Galactic dust polarization for the first detection of Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) B-modes signal. Such an accurate model is only\nachieved when a quantitative theory of grain alignment that links grain\nalignment efficiency with local physical conditions and dust properties is\ndeveloped and tested. In this paper, we review the successful development of\nsuch a quantitative alignment theory, focusing on a unified model of grain\nalignment based on radiative torques and magnetic relaxation for dust grains\nincorporated with iron inclusions. We discuss the implication of the unified\nalignment model for interpreting the latest observational results by Planck and\nALMA.\n", "  We study nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs) in quantum spin-1/2 chains in\ncontact with two heat baths at different temperatures. We consider the\nweak-coupling limit both for spin-spin coupling in the system and for\nsystem-bath coupling. This setting allows us to treat NESSs with a nonzero\ntemperature gradient analytically. We develop a perturbation theory for this\nweak-coupling situation and show a simple condition for the existence of\nnonzero temperature gradient. This condition is independent of the\nintegrability of the system.\n", "  The notion of entropy is shared between statistics and thermodynamics, and is\nfundamental to both disciplines. This makes statistical problems particularly\nsuitable for reaction network implementations. In this paper we show how to\nperform a statistical operation known as Information Projection or E projection\nwith stochastic mass-action kinetics. Our scheme encodes desired conditional\ndistributions as the equilibrium distributions of reaction systems. To our\nknowledge this is a first scheme to exploit the inherent stochasticity of\nreaction networks for information processing. We apply this to the problem of\nan artificial cell trying to infer its environment from partial observations.\n", "  Schaefer introduced a framework for generalized satisfiability problems on\nthe Boolean domain and characterized the computational complexity of such\nproblems. We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which the\nFourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomials\nin a unique way. The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to a\nrelaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are\nlinear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by a\nsystem of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation has\nreceived considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where\nsuch constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systems\nthat have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator\nassignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain a complete\ncharacterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gap\nbetween satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation of\nsatisfiability via operator assignments. To establish our main result, we adapt\nthe notion of primitive-positive definability (pp-definability) to our setting,\na notion that has been used extensively in the study of constraint satisfaction\nproblems. Here, we show that pp-definability gives rise to gadget reductions\nthat preserve satisfiability gaps. We also present several additional\napplications of this method. In particular and perhaps surprisingly, we show\nthat the relaxed notion of pp-definability in which the quantified variables\nare allowed to range over operator assignments gives no additional expressive\npower in defining Boolean relations.\n", "  Investigating microstructure of suspensions with particles having anisotropic\nshape that share complex interactions is a challenging task leading to\ncompeting claims. This work investigates phase behavior of one such system:\naqueous Laponite suspension, which is highly contested in the literature, using\nrheological and microscopic tools. Remarkably, we observe that over a broad\nrange of Laponite (1.4 to 4 weight %) and salt concentrations (0 to 7 mM), the\nsystem overwhelmingly demonstrates all the rheological characteristics of the\nsol-gel transition leading to a percolated network. Analysis of the rheological\nresponse leads to fractal dimension that primarily depends on the Laponite\nconcentration. We also obtain the activation energy for gelation, which is\nobserved to decrease with increase in Laponite as well as salt concentration.\nSignificantly, the cryo-TEM images of the post-gel state clearly show presence\nof a percolated network formed by inter-particle bonds. The present work\ntherefore conclusively establishes the system to be in an attractive gel state\nresolving a long-standing debate in the literature.\n", "  Elastic constants and their derived properties of various cubic Heusler\ncompounds were calculated using first-principles density functional theory. To\nbegin with, Cu$_2$MnAl is used as a case study to explain the interpretation of\nthe basic quantities and compare them with experiments. The main part of the\nwork focuses on Co$_2$-based compounds that are Co$_2$Mn$M$ with the main group\nelements $M=$~Al, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb, Sb, Bi, and Co$_2TM$ with the main\ngroup elements Si or Ge, and the $3d$ transition metals $T=$~Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,\nand Fe. It is found that many properties of Heusler compounds correlate to the\nmass or nuclear charge $Z$ of the main group element.\n  Blackman's and Every's diagrams are used to compare the elastic properties of\nthe materials, whereas Pugh's and Poisson's ratios are used to analyze the\nrelationship between interatomic bonding and physical properties. It is found\nthat the {\\it Pugh's criterion} on brittleness needs to be revised whereas {\\it\nChristensen's criterion} describes the ductile--brittle transition of Heusler\ncompounds very well. The calculated elastic properties give hint on a metallic\nbonding with an intermediate brittleness for the studied Heusler compounds.\n  The universal anisotropy of the stable compounds has values in the range of\n$0.57 <A_U <2.73$. The compounds with higher $A_U$ values are found close to\nthe middle of the transition metal series. In particular, Co$_2$ScAl with\n$A_U=0.01$ is predicted to be an isotropic material that comes closest to an\nideal Cauchy solid as compared to the remaining Co$_2$-based compounds. Apart\nfrom the elastic constants and moduli, the sound velocities, Debye\ntemperatures, and hardness are predicted and discussed for the studied systems.\nThe calculated slowness surfaces for sound waves reflect the degree of\nanisotropy of the compounds.\n", "  We report the results from a pilot search for radio recombination line (RRL)\nemission at millimeter wavelengths in a small sample of pre-planetary nebulae\n(pPNe) and young PNe (yPNe) with emerging central ionized regions. Observations\nof the H30\\alpha, H31a, H39a, H41a, H48b, H49b, H51b, and H55g lines at 1 and\n3mm have been performed with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope. These lines are\nexcellent probes of the dense inner (<~150 au) and heavily obscured regions of\nthese objects, where the yet unknown agents for PN-shaping originate. We\ndetected mm-RRLs in three objects: CRL 618, MWC 922, and M 2-9. For CRL 618,\nthe only pPN with previous published detections of H41a, H35a, and H30a\nemission, we find significant changes in the line profiles indicating that\ncurrent observations are probing regions of the ionized wind with larger\nexpansion velocities and mass-loss rate than ~29 years ago. In the case of MWC\n922, we observe a drastic transition from single-peaked profiles at 3mm to\ndouble-peaked profiles at 1mm, which is consistent with maser amplification of\nthe highest frequency lines; the observed line profiles are compatible with\nrotation and expansion of the ionized gas, probably arranged in a disk+wind\nsystem around a ~5-10 Msun central mass. In M 2-9, the mm-RRL emission appears\nto be tracing a recent mass outburst by one of the stars of the central binary\nsystem. We present the results from non-LTE line and continuum radiative\ntransfer models, which enables us to constrain the structure, kinematics, and\nphysical conditions (electron temperature and density) of the ionized cores of\nour sample. (abridged). We deduce mass-loss rates of ~1e-6-1e-7 Msun/yr, which\nare significantly higher than the values adopted by stellar evolution models\ncurrently in use and would result in a transition from the asymptotic giant\nbranch to the PN phase faster than hitherto assumed.\n", "  Machine elements and mechanical components have often surfaces with\nanisotropic roughness, which may result from the machining processes, e.g.\ngrinding, or from wear. Hence, it is important to understand how surface\nroughness anisotropy affects contact mechanics properties, such as friction and\nthe interface separation, which is important for lubricated contacts. Here we\nextend and apply a multiscale mean-field model to the lubricated contact\nbetween a soft (e.g. rubber) elastic solid and a rigid countersurface. We\nconsider surfaces with anisotropic surface roughness, and discuss how the fluid\nflow factors and friction factors depend on the roughness. We present an\nexperimental study of the lubricated sliding contact between a nitrile\nbutadiene rubber O-ring and steel surfaces with different types of isotropic\nand anisotropic surface roughness. The good quantitative comparison between the\nexperimental results and the theory predictions suggests that the multiscale\nlubrication mechanisms are accurately captured by the theory.\n", "  Recent advances in the preparation, control and measurement of atomic gases\nhave led to new insights into the quantum world and unprecedented metrological\nsensitivities, e.g. in measuring gravitational forces and magnetic fields. The\nfull potential of applying such capabilities to areas as diverse as biomedical\nimaging, non-invasive underground mapping, and GPS-free navigation can only be\nrealised with the scalable production of efficient, robust and portable\ndevices. Here we introduce additive manufacturing as a production technique of\nquantum device components with unrivalled design freedom, providing a step\nchange in efficiency, compactness and facilitating systems integration. As a\ndemonstrator we present a compact ultracold atom source using less than ten\nmilliwatts power to produce large samples of cold rubidium gases in an\nultrahigh vacuum environment. This disruptive technology opens the door to\ndrastically improved integrated structures, which will further reduce power\nconsumption, size and assembly complexity in scalable series manufacture of\nbespoke quantum devices.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that liquid drops on highly deformable\nsubstrates exhibit mutual interactions. This is similar to the Cheerios effect,\nthe capillary interaction of solid particles at a liquid interface, but now the\nroles of solid and liquid are reversed. Here we present a dynamical theory for\nthis inverted Cheerios effect, taking into account elasticity, capillarity and\nthe viscoelastic rheology of the substrate. We compute the velocity at which\ndroplets attract, or repel, as a function of their separation. The theory is\ncompared to a simplified model in which the viscoelastic dissipation is treated\nas a localized force at the contact line. It is found that the two models\ndiffer only at small separation between the droplets, and both of them\naccurately describe experimental observations.\n", "  Sterile neutrino dark matter is expected to suppress structure formation at\nsmall astrophysical scales. The details of the suppression depend on the\nsterile neutrino production mechanism in the early universe. In this\nproceeding, we focus on the most popular cases of resonant production (via the\nmixing between active and sterile neutrinos) and scalar decay production (via\nthe decay of a hypothetical scalar singlet). We first review current\nconstraints from structure formation before discussing how the sterile neutrino\ndark matter hypothesis can alleviate the overabundance problem of dwarf\ngalaxies in the local universe.\n", "  The possibility in principle is shown for the existence of Casimir\nelectromotive force (EMF) in a configuration with parallel nanosized metal\nplates which are shifted relative one another. The effect is theoretically\ndemonstrated for a configuration with two plates (wings) of finite length, the\nparticular case of which is classical Casimir configuration with parallel\nplates. It is found that when the plates are strictly parallel, EMF does not\nappear. However, when the plates are shifted relative one another, in each of\nthem time-constant EMF is generated. It is also found that maximal EMF values\ndepending on the plate shifts are larger than those depending on the values of\nangles between the wings. All the found effects exist in periodic\nconfigurations with shifted elements. There are optima of the configuration\ngeometrical parameters at which the EMF generation can be maximal.\n", "  Mid-infrared nano-imaging and spectroscopy of two-dimensional (2D) materials\nhave been limited so far to scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical\nMicroscopy (s-NSOM) experiments where light from the sample is scattered by a\nmetallic-coated Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tip interacting with the material\nat the nanoscale. These experiments have recently allowed imaging of plasmon\npolaritons in graphene as well as hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HP2) in\nhexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN). Here we show that the high mechanical\nsensitivity of an AFM cantilever can be exploited for imaging hyperbolic phonon\npolaritons in hBN. In our imaging process, the lattice vibrations of hBN\nmicrometer-sized flakes are locally enhanced by the launched phonon polaritons.\nThese enhanced vibrations are coupled to the AFM tip in contact to the sample\nsurface and recorded during scanning. Imaging resolution better than\n{\\lambda}/20 is showed, comparable to the best resolution in s-NSOM.\nImportantly, this detection mechanism is free from light background and it is\nin fact the first photon-less detection of phonon polaritons.\n", "  The J-integral is recognized as a fundamental parameter in fracture mechanics\nthat characterizes the inherent resistance of materials to crack growth.\nHowever, the conventional methods to calculate the J-integral, which require\nknowledge of the exact position of a crack tip and the continuum fields around\nit, are unable to precisely measure the J-integral of polymer composites at the\nnanoscale. This work aims to propose an effective calculation method based on\ncoarse-grained (CG) simulations for predicting the J-integral of carbon\nnanotube (CNT)/polymer composites. In the proposed approach, the J-integral is\ndetermined from the load displacement curve of a single specimen. The\ndistinguishing feature of the method is the calculation of J-integral without\nneed of information about the crack tip, which makes it applicable to complex\npolymer systems. The effects of the CNT weight fraction and covalent\ncross-links between the polymer matrix and nanotubes, and polymer chains on the\nfracture behavior of the composites are studied in detail. The dependence of\nthe J-integral on the crack length and the size of representative volume\nelement (RVE) is also explored.\n", "  It is generally accepted that the dynamics of relativistic particles in the\nlab frame can be described by taking into account the relativistic dependence\nof the particles momenta on the velocity, with no reference to Lorentz\ntransformations. The electrodynamics problem can then be treated within a\n\"single inertial frame\" description. To evaluate radiation fields from moving\ncharged particles we need their velocities and positions as a function of the\nlab frame time t. The relativistic motion of a particle in the lab frame is\ndescribed by Newton's second law corrected for the relativistic dependence of\nthe particle momentum on the velocity. In all standard derivations the\ntrajectories in the source part of the usual Maxwell's equations are identified\nwith the trajectories $\\vec{x}(t)$ calculated by using the \"corrected\" Newton's\nsecond law. This way of coupling fields and particles is considered correct. We\nargue that this procedure needs to be changed by demonstrating a\ncounterintuitive: the results of conventional theory of radiation by\nrelativistically moving charges are not consistent with the principle of\nrelativity. The trajectory of a particle in the lab frame consistent with the\nusual Maxwell's equations, is found by solving the dynamics equation in\nmanifestly covariant form, with the proper time $\\tau$ used to parameterize the\nparticle world-line in space-time. We find a difference between the \"true\"\nparticle trajectory $\\vec{x}(t)$ calculated or measured in the conventional\nway, and the covariant particle trajectory $\\vec{x}_{cov}(t)$ calculated by\nprojecting the world-line to the lab frame and using t to parameterize the\ntrajectory curve. The difference is due to a choice of convention, but only\n$\\vec{x}_{cov}(t)$ is consistent with the usual Maxwell's equations: therefore,\na correction of the conventional synchrotron-cyclotron radiation theory is\nrequired.\n", "  A close-in giant planetary (CGP) system has a net polarization signal whose\nvalue varies depending on the orbital phase of the planet. This polarization\nsignal is either caused by the stellar occultation or by reflected starlight\nfrom the surface of the orbiting planet. When the CGP system is located in the\nGalactic bulge, its polarization signal becomes too weak to be measured\ndirectly. One method for detecting and characterizing these weak polarization\nsignatures due to distant CGP systems is gravitational microlensing. In this\nwork, we focus on potential polarimetric observations of highly-magnified\nmicrolensing events of CGP systems. When the lens is passing directly in front\nof the source star with its planetary companion, the polarimetric signature\ncaused by the transiting planet is magnified. As a result some distinct\nfeatures in the polarimetry and light curves are produced. In the same way\nmicrolensing amplifies the reflection-induced polarization signal. While the\nplanet-induced perturbations are magnified, whenever these polarimetric or\nphotometric deviations vanish for a moment the corresponding magnification\nfactor or the polarization component(s) is equal to the related one due to the\nplanet itself. In order to evaluate the observability of such systems through\npolarimetric or photometric observations of high-magnification microlensing\nevents, we simulate these events by considering confirmed CGP systems as their\nsource stars and conclude that the efficiency for detecting the planet-induced\nsignal with the state-of-the-art polarimetric instrument (FORS2/VLT) is less\nthan 0.1 %. Consequently, these planet-induced polarimetry perturbations can\nlikely be detected under favorable conditions by high-resolution and\nshort-cadence polarimeters of the next generation.\n", "  Efficiency is a critical factor limiting the applications of nonlinear\nplasmonic devices. We show by theory and experiments that high efficiency\nfour-wave mixing (FWM) is achieved in nanometer size plasmonic hotspots, which\nopen up opportunities for nanoscale light manipulation. First, we present a\nclassical calculation on the efficiency of frequency conversion by\nquadruple-enhanced FWM for a Kerr nonlinear material loaded in the plasmonic\nhotspot of a gold nanosphere dimer. The results indicate the viability to\nachieve over 10% efficiency in a nanometer volume under milliwatts of pump\npower consumption or less. Next, we present experimental results which show\nnearly 50% linewidth broadening of a 100 fs pulsed laser by a monolayer\ngraphene in a gold nanosphere-plane junction under 25 mW of instantaneous pump\npower. Such a high efficiency, low power, and nanoscale nonlinear process is a\npromising candidate for making ultra-compact and high-speed nonlinear optical\ndevices.\n", "  We numerically investigate Taylor-Couette flow in a wide-gap configuration,\nwith $r_i/r_o=1/2$, the inner cylinder rotating, and the outer cylinder\nstationary. The fluid is taken to be electrically conducting, and a magnetic\nfield of the form $B_z\\approx(1 + \\cos(2\\pi z/z_0))/2$ is externally imposed,\nwhere the wavelength $z_0=50(r_o-r_i)$. Taylor vortices form where the field is\nweak, but not where it is strong. As the Reynolds number measuring the rotation\nrate is increased, the initial onset of vortices involves phase slip events,\nwhereby pairs of Taylor vortices are periodically formed and then drift\noutward, away from the midplane where $B_z=0$. Subsequent bifurcations lead to\na variety of other solutions, including ones both symmetric and asymmetric\nabout the midplane. For even larger Reynolds numbers a different type of phase\nslip arises, in which vortices form at the outer edges of the pattern and drift\ninward, disappearing abruptly at a certain point. These solutions can also be\nsymmetric or asymmetric about the midplane, and co-exist at the same Reynolds\nnumber. Many of the dynamics of these phase slip solutions are qualitatively\nsimilar to previous results in geometrically ramped Taylor-Couette flows.\n", "  The interference effect between leptonic radiative corrections and hadronic\npolarization functions is calculated via optical theorem for $\\mu-$pair\nproductions. It is achieved within the use of the last data for\n$\\sigma_h(e^+e^-\\rightarrow hadrons)$ from SND,CMD,CMD-2,BABAR and BESSIII\nexperimental Collaborations. The paper takes into account specific experimental\nconditions and the result is compared with KLOE experiment for $\\mu^{-}\\mu^{+}$\nproduction at $\\phi$ meson energy. Small, but non-negligible tension between\ntheory and experiment is discussed.\n", "  Population annealing is a hybrid of sequential and Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethods geared towards the efficient parallel simulation of systems with\ncomplex free-energy landscapes. Systems with first-order phase transitions are\namong the problems in computational physics that are difficult to tackle with\nstandard methods such as local-update simulations in the canonical ensemble,\nfor example with the Metropolis algorithm. It is hence interesting to see\nwhether such transitions can be more easily studied using population annealing.\nWe report here our preliminary observations from population annealing runs for\nthe two-dimensional Potts model with $q > 4$, where it undergoes a first-order\ntransition.\n", "  The growth of single-layer MoS2 with chemical vapor deposition is an\nestablished method that can produce large-area and high quality samples. In\nthis article, we investigate the geometrical and optical properties of hundreds\nof individual single-layer MoS2 crystallites grown on a highly-polished\nsapphire substrate. Most of the crystallites are oriented along the terraces of\nthe sapphire substrate and have an area comprised between 10 {\\mu}m2 and 60\n{\\mu}m2. Differential reflectance measurements performed on these crystallites\nshow that the area of the MoS2 crystallites has an influence on the position\nand broadening of the B exciton while the orientation does not influence the A\nand B excitons of MoS2. These measurements demonstrate that differential\nreflectance measurements have the potential to be used to characterize the\nhomogeneity of large area CVD grown samples.\n", "  The interaction of light with matter has triggered the interest of scientists\nfor long time. The area of plasmonics emerges in this context through the\ninteraction of light with valence electrons in metals. The random phase\napproximation in the long wavelength limit is used for analytical investigation\nof plasmons in three-dimensional metals, in a two-dimensional electron gas and\nfinally in the most famous two-dimensional semi-metal, namely graphene. We show\nthat plasmons in bulk metals as well as in a two-dimensional electron gas\noriginate from classical laws, whereas, quantum effects appear as non-local\ncorrections. On the other hand, graphene plasmons are purely quantum modes and,\nthus, they would not exist in a \"classical world\". Furthermore, under certain\ncircumstances, light is able to couple with plasmons on metallic surfaces,\nforming a surface plasmon polariton, which is very important in nanoplasmonics\ndue to its subwavelength nature. In addition, we outline two applications that\ncomplete our theoretical investigation. Firstly, we examine how the presence of\ngain (active) dielectrics affects surface plasmon polariton properties and we\nfind that there is a gain value for which the metallic losses are completely\neliminated resulting to lossless plasmon propagation. Secondly, we combine\nmonolayers of graphene in a periodic order and construct a plasmonic\nmetamaterial that provides tunable wave propagation properties, such as\nepsilon-near-zero behavior, normal and negative refraction.\n", "  We address light propagation properties in complex media consisting of random\ndistributions of lenses that have specific focusing properties. We present both\nanalytical and numerical techniques that can be used to study emergent\nproperties of light organization in these media. As light propagates, it\nexperiences multiple scattering leading to the formation of light bundles in\nthe form of branches; these are random yet occur systematically in the the\nmedium, particularly in the weak scattering limit. On the other hand, in the\nstrong scattering limit we find that coalescence of branches may lead to the\nformation of extreme waves of the \"rogue wave\" type. These waves appear at\nspecific locations and arise in the linear as well as in the nonlinear regimes.\nWe present both the weak and strong scattering limit and show that these\ncomplex phenomena can be studied numerically and analytically through simple\nmodels.\n", "  We numerically investigate the implementation of Haar-random unitarity\ntransformations and Fourier transformations in photonic devices consisting of\nbeam splitters and phase shifters, which are used for integrated photonics\nimplementations of boson sampling. The distribution of reflectivities required\nto implement an arbitrary unitary transformation is skewed towards low values,\nand this skew becomes stronger the larger the number of modes. A realistic\nimplementation using Mach-Zehnder interferometers is incapable of doing this\nperfectly and thus has limited fidelity. We show that numerical optimisation\nand adding extra beam splitters to the network can help to restore fidelity.\n", "  With sufficient time, double edge-swap Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods are able to sample uniformly at random from many different and\nimportant graph spaces. For instance, for a fixed degree sequence, MCMC methods\ncan sample any graph from: simple graphs; multigraphs (which may have\nmultiedges); and pseudographs (which may have multiedges and/or multiple\nself-loops). In this note we extend these MCMC methods to `multiloop-graphs',\nwhich allow multiple self-loops but not multiedges and `loopy-multigraphs'\nwhich allow multiedges and single self-loops. We demonstrate that there are\ndegree sequences on which the standard MCMC methods cannot uniformly sample\nmultiloop-graphs, and exactly characterize which degree sequences can and\ncannot be so sampled. In contrast, we prove that such MCMC methods can sample\nall loopy-multigraphs. Taken together with recent work on graphs which allow\nsingle self-loops but no multiedges, this work completes the study of the\nconnectivity (irreducibility) of double edge-swap Markov chains for all\ncombinations of allowing self-loops, multiple self-loops and/or multiedges.\nLooking toward other possible directions to extend edge swap sampling\ntechniques, we produce examples of degree and triangle constraints which have\ndisconnected spaces for all edges swaps on less than or equal to 8 edges.\n", "  We calculate exactly the quantum mechanical, temporal Wigner quasiprobability\ndensity for a single-mode, degenerate parametric amplifier for a system in the\nGaussian state, viz., a displaced-squeezed thermal state. The Wigner function\nallows us to calculate the fluctuations in photon number and the quadrature\nvariance. We contrast the difference between the nonclassicality criteria,\nwhich is independent of the displacement parameter $\\alpha$, based on the\nGlauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distribution $P(\\beta)$ and the\nclassical/nonclassical behavior of the Mandel $Q_{M}(\\tau)$ parameter, which\ndepends strongly on $\\alpha$. We find a phase transition as a function of\n$\\alpha$ such that at the critical point $\\alpha_{c}$, $Q_{M}(\\tau)$, as a\nfunction of $\\tau$, goes from strictly classical, for $|\\alpha|< |\\alpha_{c}|$,\nto a mixed classical/nonclassical behavior, for $|\\alpha|> |\\alpha_{c}|$.\n", "  Understanding the interaction between the valves and walls of the heart is\nimportant in assessing and subsequently treating heart dysfunction. With\nadvancements in cardiac imaging, nonlinear mechanics and computational\ntechniques, it is now possible to explore the mechanics of valve-heart\ninteractions using anatomically and physiologically realistic models. This\nstudy presents an integrated model of the mitral valve (MV) coupled to the left\nventricle (LV), with the geometry derived from in vivo clinical magnetic\nresonance images. Numerical simulations using this coupled MV-LV model are\ndeveloped using an immersed boundary/finite element method. The model\nincorporates detailed valvular features, left ventricular contraction,\nnonlinear soft tissue mechanics, and fluid-mediated interactions between the MV\nand LV wall. We use the model to simulate the cardiac function from diastole to\nsystole, and investigate how myocardial active relaxation function affects the\nLV pump function. The results of the new model agree with in vivo measurements,\nand demonstrate that the diastolic filling pressure increases significantly\nwith impaired myocardial active relaxation to maintain the normal cardiac\noutput. The coupled model has the potential to advance fundamental knowledge of\nmechanisms underlying MV-LV interaction, and help in risk stratification and\noptimization of therapies for heart diseases.\n"]}
