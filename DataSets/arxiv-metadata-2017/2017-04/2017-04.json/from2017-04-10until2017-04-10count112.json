The\nextension results in a higher Lie algebroid. We give exact Courant algebroids\nand string Lie 2-algebras as examples of such extensions. We then apply this to\nobtain a Lie 2-groupoid integration of an exact Courant algebroid.\n", "  In quantum magnetism spin dimers are typically associated with spin-singlet\nstates. To date, $triplet$ $dimerization$ has not been observed in any 3D or\nquasi-2D material. With this in mind we here discuss the electronic structure\nof the spin-orbit driven $5d^5$ Mott insulator Li$_2$IrO$_3$, a\nhoneycomb-lattice system with two crystallographically inequivalent Ir-Ir\nbonds. From $ab$ $initio$ many-body calculations we find that, while both\nHeisenberg and Kitaev couplings are present, the magnetic interactions are\ndominated by a strong isotropic ferromagnetic exchange on only one set of\nbonds. This causes the formation of triplet spin dimers effectively placed on a\nstrongly frustrated triangular lattice. The triplet dimers remain protected in\na large region of the phase diagram, suggesting that Li$_2$IrO$_3$ has a\nlong-range incommensurate magnetic ground state that is pushed by the Kitaev\nexchange interactions beyond a standard planar helix configuration.\n", "  We study the quantum contributions to the classical cosmological constant in\na quantum gravity theory for GR with matter on a piecewise linear spacetime\ncorresponding to a triangulation of a smooth manifold. We use the effective\naction approach and a special path-integral (PI) measure which depends on a\nfree parameter, while matter is modeled by a massive self-interacting scalar\nfield. The effective cosmological constant (CC) is given as a sum of 3 terms:\nthe classical CC, the quantum gravity CC and the matter CC. We show that the\nfree parameters of the theory can be chosen such that the classical CC cancels\nthe matter CC so that the effective CC is given by the QG CC. Since the value\nof the quantum gravity CC is determined by the PI measure only, the PI measure\nparameter can be chosen such that the effective CC gives the observed value.\nThis is equivalent to the statement that the experimentally observed CC value\nbelongs to the spectrum of the CC operator in this QG theory.\n", "  The calculation of the molecular column density from molecular spectral\n(rotational or ro-vibrational) transition measurements is one of the most basic\nquantities derived from molecular spectroscopy. Starting from first principles\nwhere we describe the basic physics behind the radiative and collisional\nexcitation of molecules and the radiative transfer of their emission, we derive\na general expression for the molecular column density. As the calculation of\nthe molecular column density involves a knowledge of the molecular energy level\ndegeneracies, rotational partition functions, dipole moment matrix elements,\nand line strengths, we include generalized derivations of these\nmolecule-specific quantities. Given that approximations to the column density\nequation are often useful, we explore the optically thin, optically thick, and\nlow-frequency limits to our derived general molecular column density relation.\nWe also evaluate the limitations of the common assumption that the molecular\nexcitation temperature is constant, and address the distinction between beam-\nand source-averaged column densities. We conclude our discussion of the\nmolecular column density with worked examples for C$^{18}$O, C$^{17}$O,\nN$_2$H$^+$, NH$_3$, and H$_2$CO. Ancillary information on some subtleties\ninvolving line profile functions, conversion between integrated flux and\nbrightness temperature, the calculation of the uncertainty associated with an\nintegrated intensity measurement, the calculation of spectral line optical\ndepth using hyperfine or isotopologue measurements, the calculation of the\nkinetic temperature from a symmetric molecule excitation temperature\nmeasurement, and relative hyperfine intensity calculations for NH$_3$ are\npresented in appendices. The intent of this document is to provide a reference\nfor researchers studying astrophysical molecular spectroscopic measurements.\n", "  The immersed boundary (IB) method is a general mathematical framework for\nstudying problems involving fluid-structure interactions in which an elastic\nstructure is immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid. In the IB formulation,\nthe fluid described by Eulerian variables is coupled with the immersed\nstructure described by Lagrangian variables via the use of the Dirac delta\nfunction. From a numerical standpoint, the Lagrangian force spreading and the\nEulerian velocity interpolation are carried out by a regularized, compactly\nsupported discrete delta function, which is assumed to be a tensor product of a\nsingle-variable immersed-boundary kernel. IB kernels are derived from a set of\npostulates designed to achieve approximate grid translational invariance,\ninterpolation accuracy and computational efficiency. In this note, we present\nnew 5-point and 6-point immersed-boundary kernels that are $\\mathscr{C}^3$ and\nyield a substantially improved translational invariance compared to other\ncommon IB kernels.\n", "  Despite being one of the hallmarks of quantum physics, there is a lack of\noperational interpretations of quantum coherence. Here we provide an\noperational interpretation of coherence of a quantum system, in terms of the\namount of noise that is to be injected in order to fully decohere it. In\nparticular, we show that in the asymptotic limit, the minimum amount of noise\nthat is required to fully decohere a quantum system, is equal to the relative\nentropy of coherence. This quantifies the erasure cost of quantum coherence. We\nemploy the entropy exchanged between system and environment during the\ndecohering operation and the memory required to store the information about the\ndecohering operation as the quantifiers of noise. We show that both the\nquantifiers yield the same cost of erasing coherence in the asymptotic limit.\nThe relative entropy of coherence, hence, is endowed with a thermodynamical and\noperational interpretation.\n", "  The next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with an extended\nHiggs sector offers one of the Higgs boson as the Standard model (SM) like\nHiggs with a mass around 125 GeV along with other Higgs bosons with lighter and\nheavier masses and not excluded by any current experiments. At the LHC,\nphenomenology of these non SM like Higgs bosons is very rich and considerably\ndifferent from the other supersymmetric models. In this work, assuming one of\nthe Higgs bosons to be the SM like, we revisit the mass spectrum and couplings\nof non SM like Higgs bosons taking into consideration all existing constraints\nand identify the relevant region of parameter space. The discovery potential of\nthese non SM like Higgs bosons, apart from their masses, is guided by their\ncouplings with gauge bosons and fermions which are very much parameter space\nsensitive. We evaluate the rates of productions of these non SM like Higgs\nbosons at the LHC for a variety of decay channels in the allowed region of the\nparameter space. Although bb, {\\tau}{\\tau} decay modes appear to be the most\npromising, it is observed that for a substantial region of parameter space the\ntwo-photon decay mode has a remarkably large rate. In this work we emphasize\nthat this diphoton mode can be exploited to find the NMSSM Higgs signal and can\nalso be potential avenue to distinguish the NMSSM from the MSSM. In addition,\nwe discuss briefly the various detectable signals of these non SM Higgs bosons\nat the LHC.\n", "  Astrophysical black hole candidates are thought to be the Kerr black holes of\ngeneral relativity, but there is not yet direct observational evidence that the\nspacetime geometry around these objects is described by the Kerr solution. The\nstudy of the properties of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by gas or\nstars orbiting these objects can potentially test the Kerr black hole\nhypothesis. In this paper, I review the state of the art of this research\nfield, describing the possible approaches to test the Kerr metric with current\nand future observational facilities and discussing current constraints.\n", "  We consider the steady-state regime describing the density profile of a dark\nmatter halo, if dark matter is treated as a Bose-Einstein condensate. We first\nsolve the fluid equation for \"canonical\" cold dark matter, obtaining a class of\ndensity profiles which includes the Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and which\ndiverge at the halo core. We then solve numerically the equation obtained when\nan additional \"quantum pressure\" term is included in the computation of the\ndensity profile. The solution to this latter case is finite at the halo core,\npossibly avoiding the \"cuspy halo problem\" present in some cold dark matter\ntheories. Within the model proposed, we predict the mass of the cold dark\nmatter particle to be of the order of M_chi c2 = 10^-24 eV, which is of the\nsame order of magnitude as that predicted in ultra-light scalar cold dark\nmatter models. Finally, we derive the differential equation describing\nperturbations in the density and the pressure of the dark matter fluid.\n", "  We discuss some features of thermodynamics in the presence of multiple\nconserved quantities. We prove a generalisation of Landauer principle\nillustrating tradeoffs between the erasure costs paid in different\n\"currencies\". We then show how the maximum entropy and complete passivity\napproaches give different answers in the presence of multiple observables. We\ndiscuss how this seems to prevent current resource theories from fully\ncapturing thermodynamic aspects of non-commutativity.\n", "  In this paper we propose the identification in AdS4 N = 2 gauged supergravity\nof the coefficient $\\tau_{RR}$ of 3D N = 2 SCFTs. We constraint the structure\nof this function in supergravity by combining the results from unitarity,\nholography and localization. We show that our conjectured function is minimized\nby the exact R-charge, corresponding to a gravitational attractor for the\nscalars in the special geometry. We identify this mechanism with the\nsupergravity dual of the $\\tau_{RR}$-minimization. We check this proposal in\nthe ABJM model, comparing with the expectations from localization and the\nAdS/CFT duality. We comment also on some possible relations with the black hole\nmicrostate counting, recently obtained from the application of localization\ntechniques.\n", "  We recover the classification of the maximally supersymmetric bosonic\nbackgrounds of eleven-dimensional supergravity by Lie algebraic means. We\nclassify all filtered deformations of the $\\mathbb Z$-graded subalgebras\n$\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{h}_{-2}\\oplus\\mathfrak{h}_{-1}\\oplus\\mathfrak{h}_{0}$\nof the Poincar\\'e superalgebra\n$\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{g}_{-2}\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}_{0}=V\\oplus\nS\\oplus \\mathfrak{so}(V)$ which differ only in zero degree, that is\n$\\mathfrak{h}_0\\subset\\mathfrak{g}_0$ and $\\mathfrak{h}_j=\\mathfrak{g}_j$ for\n$j<0$. Aside from the Poincar\\'e superalgebra itself and its $\\mathbb Z$-graded\nsubalgebras, there are only three other Lie superalgebras, which are the\nsymmetry superalgebras of the non-flat maximally supersymmetric backgrounds. In\npassing we identify the gravitino variation with (a component of) a Spencer\ncocycle.\n", "  The conventional hadron-resonance gas (HRG) model with the Particle Data\nGroup (PDG) hadron input, full chemical equilibrium, and the hadron type\ndependent eigenvolume interactions is employed to fit the hadron mid-rapidity\nyield data of ALICE Collaboration for the most central Pb+Pb collisions. For\nthe case of point-like hadrons the well-known fit result $T = 154 \\pm 2$ MeV is\nreproduced. However, the situation changes if hadrons have different\neigenvolumes. In the case when all mesons are point-like while all baryons have\nan effective hard-core radius of 0.3 fm the $\\chi^2$ temperature dependence of\nthe $\\chi^2$ has a broad minimum in the temperature range of $155-210$ MeV,\nwith fit quality comparable to the $T \\sim 155$ MeV minimum in the\npoint-particle case. Very similar result is obtained when only baryon-baryon\neigenvolume interactions are considered, with eigenvolume parameter taken from\nprevious fit to ground state of nuclear matter. Finally, when we apply the\neigenvolume corrections with mass-proportional eigenvolume $v_i \\sim m_i$,\nfixed to particular proton hard-core radius $r_p$, we observe a second minimum\nin the temperature dependence of the $\\chi^2$, located at the significantly\nhigher temperatures. For instance, at $r_p = 0.5$ fm the fit quality is better\nthan in the point-particle HRG case in a very wide temperature range of\n$170-320$ MeV, which gives an uncertainty in the temperature determination from\nthe fit to the data of 150 MeV. These results show that thermal fits to the\nheavy-ion hadron yield data are very sensitive to the modeling of the\nshort-range repulsion eigenvolume between hadrons, and that chemical freeze-out\ntemperature can be extracted from the LHC hadron yield data only with sizable\nuncertainty.\n", "  The focal field properties of radially/azimuthally polarized Zernike\npolynomials are studied. A method to design the pupil field in order to shape\nthe focal field of radially or azimuthally polarized phase vortex is\nintroduced. With this method, we are able to obtain a pupil field to achieve a\nlongitudinally polarized hollow spot with a depth of focus up to $12\\lambda$\nand $0.14\\lambda$ lateral resolution for a optical system with numerical\naperture 0.99; A pupil field to generate 8 circularly polarized focal spots\nalong the optical axis is also obtained with this method.\n", "  During the merger of a black hole and a neutron star, baryonic mass can\nbecome unbound from the system. Because the ejected material is extremely\nneutron-rich, the r-process rapidly synthesizes heavy nuclides as the material\nexpands and cools. In this work, we map general relativistic models of black\nhole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers into a Newtonian smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow the evolution of the thermodynamics and\nmorphology of the ejecta until the outflows become homologous. We investigate\nhow the subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that the\nresults are robust. Using thermodynamic histories from the SPH particles, we\nthen calculate the expected nucleosynthesis in these outflows while varying the\nlevel of neutrino irradiation coming from the postmerger accretion disk. We\nfind that the ejected material robustly produces r-process nucleosynthesis even\nfor unrealistically high neutrino luminosities, due to the rapid velocities of\nthe outflow. Nonetheless, we find that neutrinos can have an impact on the\ndetailed pat- tern of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Electron neutrinos are\ncaptured by neutrons to produce protons while neutron capture is occurring. The\nproduced protons rapidly form low mass seed nuclei for the r-process. These low\nmass seeds are eventually incorporated into the first r-process peak at A~78,\nproducing mainly Ge and Se. We consider the mechanism of this process in detail\nand discuss if it can impact galactic chemical evolution of the first peak\nr-process nuclei.\n", "  A high index dielectric nano-sphere can be excited and yet remain\nradiationless. A method to excite the non-radiating anapole mode of a high\nindex isotropic dielectric nanosphere is presented. With tightly focused\nradially polarized beam illumination, the main-contributing electric dipole\nmode and magnetic modes can be zero with only a weak electric quadruple\ncontributing to the total scattering. Further, with a standing wave\nillumination formed by two counter-propagating focused radially polarized beam\nunder $4\\pi$ configuration, the ideal radiationless ananpole can be excited.\n", "  Ultra-fast laser experiments yield increasingly reliable data on warm-dense\nmatter (WDM), but rely on entrenched simplistic theoretical models. We\nre-analyze two topical experiments, avoiding (i) {\\it ad hoc} core-repulsion\nmodels, (ii) \"Yukawa screening\" models and (iii) electron-ion equilibrium\nassumptions. An accurate, rapid density-functional neutral-pseudoatom model\ncoupled to a hyper-netted-chain (HNC) equation with a bridge term is used to\ncompute structure factors, X-Ray scattering, compressibility, phonons and\nresistivity. Electronic-structure codes are used to confirm the calculations.\nThe Yukawa and core-repulsion models are shown to be misleading.\n", "  Bulk viscosity leads to negative pressure, which is a key ingredient for\nsuccessful inflation. We build an inflationary model where the slow-roll of the\ninflaton field is driven by a viscous component instead of the flat potential\ncommonly used. Since viscosity does not contribute to the energy density of the\nUniverse, the Hubble rate depends only on the kinetic energy of the inflaton.\nThe power spectrum is almost scale-invariant, with a tilt depending on the\nslow-roll parameters defined within the model.\n", "  We report on a set of long-term general-relativistic three-dimensional (3D)\nmulti-group (energy-dependent) neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics simulations of\ncore-collapse supernovae. We employ a full 3D two-moment scheme with the local\nM1 closure, three neutrino species, and 12 energy groups per species. With\nthis, we follow the post-core-bounce evolution of the core of a nonrotating\n$27$-$M_\\odot$ progenitor in full unconstrained 3D and in octant symmetry for\n$\\gtrsim$$ 380\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. We find the development of an asymmetric runaway\nexplosion in our unconstrained simulation. We test the resolution dependence of\nour results and, in agreement with previous work, find that low resolution\nartificially aids explosion and leads to an earlier runaway expansion of the\nshock. At low resolution, the octant and full 3D dynamics are qualitatively\nvery similar, but at high resolution, only the full 3D simulation exhibits the\nonset of explosion.\n", "  In this work, a new Physics laboratory experiment on Acoustics beats is\npresented. We have designed a simple experimental setup to study superposition\nof sound waves of slightly different frequencies (acoustic beat). The\nmicrophone of a smartphone is used to capture the sound waves emitted by two\nequidistant speakers from the mobile which are at the same time connected to\ntwo AC generators. The smartphone is used as a measuring instrument. By means\nof a simple and free AndroidTM application, the sound level (in dB) as a\nfunction of time is measured and exported to a .csv format file. Applying\ncommon graphing analysis and a fitting procedure, the frequency of the beat is\nobtained. The beat frequencies as obtained from the smartphone data are\ncompared with the difference of the frequencies set at the AC generator. A very\ngood agreement is obtained being the percentage discrepancies within 1 %.\n", "  By identifying the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with the hydrodynamic equations\nin superfluid ${^3}$He, the effective potential is introduced in the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation to solve the quantum pressure in steady state. The\npure gauge velocity solutions of hydrodynamic equations provide an analogous\nWu-Yang monopole potential. The two cases of velocity in superfluid are\nequivalent to the two regions of Wu-Yang monopole potential. Due to the\ncompressibility of superfluid, the physical models are limited, such as hard\ncore and harmonic oscillator. It is important that the constraint condition of\n$\\nabla\\rho\\cdot \\textbf{v}=0$ plays a key role, which determines that the\nintegral quantum numbers are selected in monopole harmonics and shows the\nspecial analogous Wu-Yang monopole. The results provide a new possibility for\nthe simulation of Wu-Yang monopole.\n", "  We develop a theory of the exchange interaction between ferromagnetic (FM)\nmetallic grains embedded into insulating matrix by taking into account the\nCoulomb blockade effects. For bulk ferromagnets separated by the insulating\nlayer the exchange interaction strongly depends on the height and thickness of\nthe tunneling barrier created by the insulator. We show that for FM grains\nembedded into insulating matrix the exchange coupling additionally depends on\nthe dielectric properties of this matrix due to the Coulomb blockade effects.\nIn particular, the FM coupling decreases with decreasing the dielectric\npermittivity of insulating matrix. We find that the change in the exchange\ninteraction due to the Coulomb blockade effects can be a few tens of percent.\nAlso, we study dependence of the intergrain exchange interaction on the grain\nsize and other parameters of the system.\n", "  We show that simulated relativistic motion can generate entanglement between\nartificial atoms and protect them from spontaneous emission. We consider a pair\nof superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator mode, where the modulation of\nthe coupling strength can mimic the harmonic motion of the qubits at\nrelativistic speeds, generating acceleration radiation. We find the optimal\nfeasible conditions for generating a stationary entangled state between the\nqubits when they are initially prepared in their ground state. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the effects of motion on the probability of spontaneous emission in the\nstandard scenarios of single-atom and two-atom superradiance, where one or two\nexcitations are initially present. Finally, we show that relativistic motion\ninduces sub-radiance and can generate a Zeno-like effect, preserving the\nexcitations from radiative decay.\n", "  We study the quantum behaviour of a particle moving in a one-dimensional\ndouble well potential. This double well is obtained by gluing together, at the\norigin, two shifted harmonic oscillator potentials. The Schr\\\"odinger equation\nis exactly solvable. The requirement that discontinuities, in the wavefunction\nand its first derivative, are absent at the origin, leads to the quantisation\nof the energy eigenvalues. We also show that oscillations in time take place\nbetween two nearby single harmonic oscillator ground states. Finally, the\ndouble well potential is augmented by a Dirac delta-function potentials at the\norigin and the corresponding Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved.\n", "  Electronic states are responsible for most material properties, including\nchemical bonds, electrical and thermal conductivity, as well as optical and\nmagnetic properties. Experimentally, however, they remain mostly elusive. Here,\nwe report the real-space mapping of selected transitions between p and d states\non the {\\AA}ngstr\\\"om scale in bulk rutile (TiO2) using electron energy-loss\nspectrometry (EELS), revealing information on individual bonds between atoms.\nOn the one hand, this enables the experimental verification of theoretical\npredictions about electronic states. On the other hand, it paves the way for\ndirectly investigating electronic states under conditions that are at the limit\nof the current capabilities of numerical simulations such as, e.g., the\nelectronic states at defects, interfaces, and quantum dots.\n", "  The Ginzburg-Landau free energy of a conventional superconductor coupled to a\nhelimagnet is microscopically derived using functional field integral\ntechniques. We show that the spin texture leads to a Lifshitz invariant in the\nfree energy, which couples the momentum density of the superconducting\ncondensate to the magnetization of the helimagnet. For helimagnets with a\nconical texture, the Lifshitz invariant yields a spatial modulation of the\nsuperconducting phase along the helical wavevector of the magnetic texture.\nBased on self-consistent numerical calculations, we verify the theoretical\nformalism by investigating a superconductor that contains a helical\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) chain. We demonstrate that the texture-induced\nmagnetoelectric coupling produces a strong supercurrent along the YSR chain,\nwhich induces a detectable magnetic field.\n", "  This paper fails to derive quantum mechanics from a few simple postulates.\nBut it gets very close --- and it does so without much exertion. More exactly,\nI obtain a representation of finite-dimensional probabilistic systems in terms\nof euclidean Jordan algebras, in a strikingly easy way, from simple\nassumptions. This provides a framework within which real, complex and\nquaternionic QM can play happily together, and allows some --- but not too much\n--- room for more exotic alternatives. (This is a leisurely summary, based on\nrecent lectures, of material from the papers arXiv:1206:2897 and\narXiv:1507.06278, the latter joint work with Howard Barnum and Matthew Graydon.\nSome further ideas are also explored.)\n", "  We consider D3 branes in presence of an S-fold plane. The latter is a non\nperturbative object, arising from the combined projection of an S-duality twist\nand a discrete orbifold of the R-symmetry group. This construction naively\ngives rise to 4d $\\mathcal{N}=3$ SCFTs. Nevertheless it has been observed that\nin some cases supersymmetry is enhanced to $\\mathcal{N}=4$. In this paper we\nstudy the explicit counting of degrees of freedom arising from vector\nmultiplets associated to strings suspended between the D3 branes probing the\nS-fold. We propose that, for trivial discrete torsion, there is no vector\nmultiplet associated to $(1,0)$ strings stretched between a brane and its\nimage. We then focus on the case of rank 2 $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theory that enhances\nto $SU(3)$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, explicitly spelling out the isomorphism between\nthe BPS-spectrum of the manifestly $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theory and that of three D3\nbranes in flat spacetime. Subsequently, we consider 3-pronged strings in these\nsetups and show how wall-crossing in the S-fold background implies wall\ncrossing in the flat geometry. This can be considered a consistency check of\nthe \\emph{conjectured} SUSY enhancement. We also find that the above\nisomorphism implies that a $(1,0)$ string, suspended between a brane and its\nimage in the S-fold, corresponds to a 3-string junction in the flat geometry.\nThis is in agreement with our claim on the absence of a vector multiplet\nassociated to such $(1,0)$ strings. This is because the 3-string junction in\nflat geometry gives rise to a $1/4$-th BPS multiplet of the $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nalgebra. Such multiplets always include particles with spin $>1$ as opposed to\na vector multiplet which is restricted by the requirement that the spins must\nbe $\\leq 1$.\n", "  We study interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) based on the many-body Coulomb\ninteraction between conduction electrons in magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ).\nThis mechanism complements the known IEC based on virtual electron hopping (or\nspin currents). We find that these two mechanisms have different behavior on\nsystem parameters. The Coulomb based IEC may exceed the hopping based exchange\ncoupling. We show that the Coulomb based exchange coupling, in contrast to the\nhopping based coupling, depends strongly on the dielectric constant of the\ninsulating layer. The dependence of the IEC on the dielectric properties of the\ninsulating layer in MTJ is similar to magneto-electric (ME) effect where\nelectric and magnetic degrees of freedom are coupled. We calculate the IEC as a\nfunction of temperature and electric field for MTJ with ferroelectric (FE)\nlayer and show that IEC has a sharp decrease in the vicinity of the FE phase\ntransition and varies strongly with external electric field.\n", "  Detection of supernova relic neutrinos could provide key support for our\ncurrent understanding of stellar and cosmological evolution, and precise\nmeasurements of these neutrinos could yield novel insights into the universe.\nIn this paper, we studied the detection potential of supernova relic neutrinos\nusing linear alkyl benzene (LAB) as a slow liquid scintillator. The linear\nalkyl benzene features good separation of Cherenkov and scintillation lights,\nthereby providing a new route for particle identification. We further addressed\nkey issues in current experiments, including (1) the charged current background\nof atmospheric neutrinos in water Cherenkov detectors and (2) the neutral\ncurrent background of atmospheric neutrinos in typical liquid scintillator\ndetectors. A kiloton-scale LAB detector at Jinping with $\\mathcal{O}$(10) years\nof data could discover supernova relic neutrinos with a sensitivity comparable\nto that of large-volume water Cherenkov detectors, typical liquid scintillator\ndetectors, and liquid argon detectors.\n", "  The Precision IceCube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU) is a proposed\nlow-energy in-fill extension to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. With\ndetection technology modeled closely on the successful IceCube example, PINGU\nwill provide a 6Mton effective mass for neutrino detection with an energy\nthreshold of a few GeV. With an unprecedented sample of over 60,000 atmospheric\nneutrinos per year in this energy range, PINGU will make highly competitive\nmeasurements of neutrino oscillation parameters in an energy range over an\norder of magnitude higher than long-baseline neutrino beam experiments. PINGU\nwill measure the mixing parameters $\\theta_{\\rm 23}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{\\rm 32}$,\nincluding the octant of $\\theta_{\\rm 23}$ for a wide range of values, and\ndetermine the neutrino mass ordering at $3\\sigma$ median significance within 4\nyears of operation. PINGU's high precision measurement of the rate of\n${\\nu_\\tau}$ appearance will provide essential tests of the unitarity of the\n$3\\times 3$ PMNS neutrino mixing matrix. PINGU will also improve the\nsensitivity of searches for low mass dark matter in the Sun, use neutrino\ntomography to directly probe the composition of the Earth's core, and improve\nIceCube's sensitivity to neutrinos from Galactic supernovae. Reoptimization of\nthe PINGU design has permitted substantial reduction in both cost and\nlogistical requirements while delivering performance nearly identical to\nconfigurations previously studied. This document summarizes the results of\ndetailed studies described in a more comprehensive document to be released\nsoon.\n", "  Satisfiability filters, introduced by S. A. Weaver et al. in 2014, are a new\nand promising type of filters to address set membership testing. In order to\nconstruct satisfiability filters, it is necessary to find disparate solutions\nto hard random $k$-SAT problems. This paper compares simulated annealing,\nsimulated quantum annealing and walkSAT, an open-source SAT solver, in terms of\ntheir ability to find such solutions. The results indicate that solutions found\nby simulated quantum annealing are generally less disparate than solutions\nfound by the other solvers and therefore less useful for the construction of\nsatisfiability filters.\n", "  We revisit the recent limits from LHCb on a Majorana neutrino N in the mass\nrange 250 - 5000 MeV. These limits are among the best currently available, and\nthey will be improved soon by the addition of data from Run 2 of the LHC. LHCb\npresented a model-independent constraint on the rate of like-sign leptonic\ndecays, and then derived a constraint on the mixing angle V{\\mu}4 based on a\ntheoretical model for the B decay width to N and the N lifetime. The model used\nis unfortunately unsound. We revise the conclusions of the paper based on a\ndecay model similar to the one used for the tau lepton and provide formulae\nuseful for future analyses.\n", "  In a periodically driven (Floquet) system, there is the possibility for new\nphases of matter, not present in stationary systems, protected by discrete\ntime-translation symmetry. This includes topological phases protected in part\nby time-translation symmetry, as well as phases distinguished by the\nspontaneous breaking of this symmetry, dubbed \"Floquet time crystals\". We show\nthat such phases of matter can exist in the pre-thermal regime of\nperiodically-driven systems, which exists generically for sufficiently large\ndrive frequency, thereby eliminating the need for integrability or strong\nquenched disorder that limited previous constructions. We prove a theorem that\nstates that such a pre-thermal regime persists until times that are nearly\nexponentially-long in the ratio of certain couplings to the drive frequency. By\nsimilar techniques, we can also construct stationary systems which\nspontaneously break *continuous* time-translation symmetry. We argue\nfurthermore that for driven systems coupled to a cold bath, the pre-thermal\nregime could potentially persist to infinite time.\n", "  If one assumes a particular form of non-minimal coupling, called the\nconformal coupling, of a perfect fluid with gravity in the fluid-gravity\nLagrangian then one gets modified Einstein field equation. In the modified\nEinstein equation, the effect of the non-minimal coupling does not vanish if\none works with spacetimes for which the Ricci scalar vanishes. In the present\nwork we use the Schwarzschild metric in the modified Einstein equation, in\npresence of non-minimal coupling with a fluid, and find out the energy-density\nand pressure of the fluid. In the present case the perfect fluid is part of the\nsolution of the modified Einstein equation. We also solve the modified Einstein\nequation, using the flat spacetime metric and show that in presence of\nnon-minimal coupling one can accommodate a perfect fluid of uniform\nenergy-density and pressure in the flat spacetime. In both the cases the fluid\npressure turns out to be negative. Except these non-trivial solutions it must\nbe noted that the vacuum solutions also remain as trivial valid solutions of\nthe modified Einstein equation in presence of non-minimal coupling.\n", "  We study the temperature and doping evolution of the NMR Knight shift, spin\nrelaxation rate, and spin echo decay time in the pseudogap regime of the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model for parameters believed to be relevant to cuprate\nsuperconductors using cluster dynamical mean field theory. We recover the\nsuppression of the Knight shift seen in experiment upon entering the pseudogap\nregime and find agreement between single and two-particle measures of the\npseudogap onset temperature. The simulated spin-echo decay time shows a linear\nin T behavior at high T which flattens off as T is lowered, and increases as\ndoping is increased. The relaxation rate shows a marked increase as T is\nlowered but no indication of a pseudogap on the Cu site, and a clear downturn\non the O site, consistent with experimental results on single layer materials\nbut different from double layer materials. The consistency of the simulated\nsusceptibilities with experiment, along with similar agreement on the\nsingle-particle level and the absence of long-range order and symmetry breaking\nsuggests that the pseudogap is well described by strong short-range correlation\neffects and that long-range order and multi-orbital effects are not required.\n", "  An algebraic interpretation of the $q$-Meixner polynomials is obtained. It is\nbased on representations of $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ on\n$q$-oscillator states with the polynomials appearing as matrix elements of\nunitary $q$-pseudorotation operators. These operators are built from\n$q$-exponentials of the $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ generators. The\northogonality, recurrence relation, difference equation, and other properties\nof the $q$-Mexiner polynomials are systematically obtained in the proposed\nframework.\n", "  We study deviations between MSSM and $Z_3$-invariant NMSSM, with respect to\ntheir predictions in $\\Delta F=2 $ processes. We find that potentially\nsignificant effects arise either from the well known double-penguin diagrams,\ndue to the extra scalar NMSSM states, or from neutralino-gluino box\ncontributions, due to the extended neutralino sector. Both are discussed to be\neffective in the large $\\tan\\beta$ regime. Enhanced genuine-NMSSM contributions\nin double penguins are expected for a light singlet spectrum (CP-even,CP-odd),\nwhile the magnitude of box effects is primarily controlled through singlino\nmixing. The latter is found to be typically subleading (but non-negligible) for\n$\\lambda \\lesssim 0.5$, however it can become dominant for $\\lambda\\sim\n\\mathcal{O}(1)$. We also study the low $\\tan\\beta$ regime, where a distinction\nbetween MSSM and NMSSM can come instead due to experimental constraints, acting\ndifferently on the allowed parameter space of each model. To this end, we\nincorporate the LHC Run-I limits from $H\\rightarrow Z Z$, $A \\rightarrow hZ$\nand $H^\\pm \\rightarrow \\tau \\nu $ non-observation along with Higgs observables\nand set (different) upper bounds for new physics contributions in $\\Delta F=2 $\nprocesses. We find that a $\\sim 25\\%$ contribution in $\\Delta M_{s(d)}$ is\nstill possible for MFV models, however such a large effect is nowadays severely\nconstrained for the case of MSSM, due to stronger bounds on the charged Higgs\nmasses.\n", "  Carrier mobility is a crucial character for electronic devices since it\ndomains power dissipation and switching speed. Materials with certain high\ncarrier mobility, equally, unveil rich unusual physical phenomena elusive in\ntheir conventional counterparts. As a consequence, the methods to enhance the\ncarrier mobility of materials receive immense research interests due to their\npotential applications in more effective electronic devices and enrichment of\nmore unusual phenomena. For instance, introducing a flat hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) substrate to enhance the carrier mobility has been achieved\nexperimentally. However, the underlying mechanics is not well understood. In\nthis study, we estimate the carrier mobility of phosphorene on h-BN substrate\n(P/h-BN) within the framework of the phonon-limited scattering model at\nfirst-principles level. %Our results are generic. Besides high-$\\kappa$\ndielectric property, h-BN also possesses excellent mechanical property of a\nhigh two-dimensional elastic modulus. The P/h-BN heterostructure inherits the\nhigh elastic modulus of h-BN, leading to an enhanced carrier mobility in\nphosphorene. Owing to the weak van der Waals interactions between the layers,\nthe unique electronic properties of phosphorene are almost perfectly preserved\nnear the Fermi level, guaranteeing the superior electronic transport in P/h-BN.\nOur findings offer a new perspective to improve the carrier mobility in\nphosphorene as well as other 2D materials based field effect transistors.\n", "  With the development of affordable aberration-correctors, analytical scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies of complex interfaces can now\nbe conducted at high spatial resolution at laboratories worldwide.\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) in particular has grown in\npopularity, since it enables elemental mapping over a wide range of ionization\nenergies. However, the interpretation of atomically-resolved data is greatly\ncomplicated by beam-sample interactions that are often overlooked by novice\nusers. Here we describe the practical factors---namely, sample thickness and\nthe choice of ionization edge---that affect the quantification of a model\nperovskite oxide interface. Our measurements of the same sample in regions of\ndifferent thickness indicate that interface profiles can vary by as much as 2-5\nunit cells, depending on the spectral feature. This finding is supported by\nmultislice simulations, which reveal that on-axis maps of even perfectly abrupt\ninterfaces exhibit significant delocalization. Quantification of thicker\nsamples is further complicated by channeling to heavier sites across the\ninterface, as well as an increased signal background. We show that extreme care\nmust be taken to prepare samples to minimize channeling effects and argue that\nit may not be possible to extract atomically-resolved information from many\nchemical maps.\n", "  A measurement of the $ZZ$ production in the $\\ell^{-}\\ell^{+}\\ell^{\\prime\n-}\\ell^{\\prime +}$ and $\\ell^{-}\\ell^{+}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ channels $(\\ell = e,\n\\mu)$ in proton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV at the Large Hadron\nCollider at CERN, using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2012 is presented. The fiducial\ncross sections for $ZZ\\to\\ell^{-}\\ell^{+}\\ell^{\\prime -}\\ell^{\\prime +}$ and\n$ZZ\\to \\ell^{-}\\ell^{+}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ are measured in selected phase-space\nregions. The total cross section for $ZZ$ events produced with both $Z$ bosons\nin the mass range 66 to 116 GeV is measured from the combination of the two\nchannels to be\n$7.3\\pm0.4\\textrm{(stat)}\\pm0.3\\textrm{(syst)}\\pm0.2\\textrm{(lumi)}$ pb, which\nis consistent with the Standard Model prediction of $6.6^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ pb. The\ndifferential cross sections in bins of various kinematic variables are\npresented. The differential event yield as a function of the transverse\nmomentum of the leading $Z$ boson is used to set limits on anomalous neutral\ntriple gauge boson couplings in $ZZ$ production.\n", "  The effects of quark-sector Lorentz violation on deep inelastic\nelectron-proton scattering are studied. We show that existing data can be used\nto establish first constraints on numerous coefficients for Lorentz violation\nin the quark sector at an estimated sensitivity of parts in a million.\n", "  This article reviews theoretical and experimental advances in Efimov physics,\nan array of quantum few-body and many-body phenomena arising for particles\ninteracting via short-range resonant interactions, that is based on the\nappearance of a scale-invariant three-body attraction theoretically discovered\nby Vitaly Efimov in 1970. This three-body effect was originally proposed to\nexplain the binding of nuclei such as the triton and the Hoyle state of\ncarbon-12, and later considered as a simple explanation for the existence of\nsome halo nuclei. It was subsequently evidenced in trapped ultra-cold atomic\nclouds and in diffracted molecular beams of gaseous helium. These experiments\nrevealed that the previously undetermined three-body parameter introduced in\nthe Efimov theory to stabilise the three-body attraction typically scales with\nthe range of atomic interactions. The few- and many-body consequences of the\nEfimov attraction have been since investigated theoretically, and are expected\nto be observed in a broader spectrum of physical systems.\n", "  The applications of the recent results obtained in the theory of generalized\nLambert functions, to the mean field theory of ferromagnetism are presented. As\na consequence, all the predictions of the Weiss theory of ferromagnetism can be\nexplicitly and exactly formulated. In several quantum mechanical problems\ninvolving delta function potentials, the solutions of the transcendental\neigenvalue equations are expressed in terms of two parameters generalized\nLambert functions. Some others, till unnoticed examples of eigenvalue equations\nwhose solutions can be written using the Lambert W function, are also\npresented.\n", "  We study unconventional superfluids of fermionic polar molecules in a\ntwo-dimensional bilayer system with dipoles are head-to-tail across the layers.\nWe analyze the critical temperature of several unconventional pairings as a\nfunction of different system parameters. The peculiar competition between the\n$d$- and the $s$- wave pairings is discussed. We show that the experimental\nobservation of such unconventional superfluids requires ulralow temperatures,\nwhich opens up new possibilities to realize several topological phases.\n", "  We study the properties of a refined weak coupling limit that preserves\ncomplete positivity in order to describe non-Markovian dynamics in the\nspin-boson model. With this tool, we show the system presents a rich and new\nnon-Markovian phenomenology. This implies a dynamical difference between\nentanglement and coherence: the latter undergoes revivals whereas the former\nnot, despite the induced dynamics being fully incoherent. In addition, the\nevolution presents \"quasieternal\" non-Markovianity, becoming non-divisible at\nany time period where the system evolves qualitatively. Furthermore, the method\nallows for an exact derivation of a master equation that accounts for a\nreversible energy exchange between system and environment. Specifically, this\nis obtained in the form of a time-dependent Lamb shift term.\n", "  Bipartite Bell inequalities can be simultaneously violated by two different\npairs of observers when weak measurements and signaling is employed. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate the violation of two simultaneous CHSH inequalities\nby exploiting a two-photon polarization maximally entangled state. Our results\ndemonstrate that large double violation is experimentally achievable. Our\ndemonstration may have impact for Quantum Key Distribution or certification of\nQuantum Random Number generators based on weak measurements.\n", "  ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ have attracted increasingly attention recently since\nthe theoretical prediction of being topological insulators (TIs). However,\nsubsequent works show many contradictions about their topological nature.Three\npossible phases, i.e. strong TI, weak TI, and Dirac semi-metal, have been\nobserved in different experiments until now. Essentially whether ZrTe$_5$ or\nHfTe$_5$ has a band gap or not is still a question. Here, we present detailed\nfirst-principles calculations on the electronic and topological properties of\nZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ on variant volumes and clearly demonstrate the\ntopological phase transition from a strong TI, going through an intermediate\nDirac semi-metal phase, then to a weak TI when the crystal expands.Our work\nmight give a unified explain about the divergent experimental results and\npropose the crucial clue to further experiments to elucidate the topological\nnature of these materials.\n", "  For stationary KPZ growth in 1+1 dimensions the height fluctuations are\ngoverned by the Baik-Rains distribution. Using the totally asymmetric single\nstep growth model, alias TASEP, we investigate height fluctuations for a\ngeneral class of spatially homogeneous random initial conditions. We prove that\nfor TASEP there is a one-parameter family of limit distributions, labeled by\nthe diffusion coefficient of the initial conditions. The distributions are\ndefined through a variational formula. We use Monte Carlo simulations to obtain\ntheir numerical plots. Also discussed is the connection to the six-vertex model\nat its conical point.\n", "  We extend Laughlin's magnetic-flux-threading argument to the quantized\nthermal Hall effect. A proper analogue of Laughlin's adiabatic magnetic-flux\nthreading process for the case of the thermal Hall effect is given in terms of\nan external gravitational field. From the perspective of the edge theories of\nquantum Hall systems, the quantized thermal Hall effect is closely tied to the\nbreakdown of large diffeomorphism invariance, that is, a global gravitational\nanomaly. In addition, we also give an argument from the bulk perspective in\nwhich a free energy, decomposed into its Fourier modes, is adiabatically\ntransferred under an adiabatic process involving external gravitational\nperturbations.\n", "  It is expected that in the interior of compact stars a proton superconductor\ncoexists with and couples to a neutron superfluid. Starting from a\nfield-theoretical model for two complex scalar fields - one of which is\nelectrically charged - we derive a Ginzburg-Landau potential which includes\nentrainment between the two fluids and temperature effects from thermal\nexcitations of the two scalar fields and the gauge field. The Ginzburg-Landau\ndescription is then used for an analysis of the phase structure in the presence\nof an external magnetic field. In particular, we study the effect of the\nsuperfluid on the flux tube phase by computing the various critical magnetic\nfields and deriving an approximation for the flux tube interaction. As a\nresult, we point out differences to the naive expectations from an isolated\nsuperconductor, for instance the existence of a first-order flux tube onset,\nresulting in a more complicated phase structure in the region between type-I\nand type-II superconductivity.\n", "  Ensembles of driven or motile bodies moving along opposite directions are\ngenerically reported to self-organize into strongly anisotropic lanes. Here,\nbuilding on a minimal model of self-propelled bodies targeting opposite\ndirections, we first evidence a critical phase transition between a mingled\nstate and a phase-separated lane state specific to active particles. We then\ndemonstrate that the mingled state displays algebraic structural correlations\nalso found in driven binary mixtures. Finally, constructing a hydrodynamic\ntheory, we single out the physical mechanisms responsible for these universal\nlong-range correlations typical of ensembles of oppositely moving bodies.\n", "  We present the first X-ray observations of the eclipsing cataclysmic\nvariables Lanning 386 and MASTER OTJ192328.22+612413.5, possible SW Sextantis\nsystems. The X-ray light curve of Lanning 386 shows deep eclipses, similar to\nthe eclipses seen in the optical light curve, confirming the high inclination\nof the system. There is evidence of a periodicity between 17-22 min in the\nX-ray and optical light curves of Lanning 386, which is associated with\nquasi-periodic oscillations. This system also displays a hard X-ray spectrum\nwhich is well fit by a partially covered, absorbed 2 temperature plasma. The\ncool plasma temperature (0.24$^{+0.17}_{-0.08}$ keV) and hot plasma temperature\n(9$^{+4}_{-2}$ keV) are not atypical plasma temperatures of known intermediate\npolar systems. Based on this model, we suggest that Lanning 386 is an\nintermediate polar with a high accretion rate. The hot plasma temperature\nlimits the white dwarf mass to $>$0.5 M$_{\\odot}$. From the optical spectrum\nobtained using the Large Binocular Telescope, we find that the secondary in the\nsystem is consistent with an M5V star, and refine the distance to Lanning 386\nto be 160$\\pm$50 pc. Finally, we use the high time resolution of the optical\nspectra to crudely constrain the magnetic moment of the white dwarf in Lanning\n386. J1923 was not detected during the observations, but the upper limit on the\nflux is inline with J1923 and Lanning 386 being related.\n", "  Minimal SO(10) grand unified models provide phenomenological predictions for\nneutrino mass patterns and mixing. These are the outcome of the interplay of\nseveral features, namely: i) the seesaw mechanism; ii) the presence of an\nintermediate scale where B-L gauge symmetry is broken and the right-handed\nneutrinos acquire a Majorana mass; iii) a symmetric Dirac neutrino mass matrix\nwhose pattern is close to the up-type quark one. In this framework two natural\ncharacteristics emerge. Normal neutrino mass hierarchy is the only allowed, and\nthere is an approximate relation involving both light-neutrino masses and\nmixing parameters. This differs from what occurring when horizontal flavour\nsymmetries are invoked. In this case, in fact, neutrino mixing or mass\nrelations have been separately obtained in literature. In this paper we discuss\nan example of such comprehensive mixing-mass relation in a specific realization\nof SO(10) and, in particular, analyse its impact on the expected neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay effective mass parameter $\\langle m_{ee} \\rangle$, and on the\nneutrino mass scale. Remarkably a lower limit for the lightest neutrino mass is\nobtained ($m_{\\rm lightest} \\gtrsim 7.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ eV, at 3 $\\sigma$\nlevel).\n", "  The direct band gap character and large spin-orbit splitting of the valence\nband edges (at the K and K' valleys) in monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides have put these two-dimensional materials under the spot-light\nof intense experimental and theoretical studies. In particular, for Tungsten\ndichalcogenides it has been found that the sign of spin splitting of conduction\nband edges makes ground state excitons radiatively inactive (dark) due to spin\nand momentum mismatch between the constituent electron and hole. One might\nsimilarly assume that the ground states of charged excitons and biexcitons in\nthese monolayers are also dark. Here, we show that the intervalley\nK$\\leftrightarrows$K' electron-electron scattering mixes bright and dark states\nof these complexes, and estimate the radiative lifetimes in the ground states\nof these \"semi-dark\" trions and biexcitons to be ~ 10ps, and analyse how these\ncomplexes appear in the temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra of WS2\nand WSe2 monolayers.\n", "  Despite the wealth of $Planck$ results, there are difficulties in\ndisentangling the primordial non-Gaussianity of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) from the secondary and the foreground non-Gaussianity (NG). For each of\nthese forms of NG the lack of complete data introduces model-dependencies.\nAiming at detecting the NGs of the CMB temperature anisotropy $\\delta T$, while\npaying particular attention to a model-independent quantification of NGs, our\nanalysis is based upon statistical and morphological univariate descriptors,\nrespectively: the probability density function $P(\\delta T)$, related to\n${\\mathrm v}_{0}$, the first Minkowski Functional (MF), and the two other MFs,\n${\\mathrm v}_{1}$ and ${\\mathrm v}_{2}$. From their analytical Gaussian\npredictions we build the discrepancy functions $\\Delta_{k}$ ($k=P,0,1,2$) which\nare applied to an ensemble of $10^{5}$ CMB realization maps of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel and to the $Planck$ CMB maps. In our analysis we use general Hermite\nexpansions of the $\\Delta_{k}$ up to the $12^{th}$ order, where the\ncoefficients are explicitly given in terms of cumulants. Assuming hierarchical\nordering of the cumulants, we obtain the perturbative expansions generalizing\nthe $2^{nd}$ order expansions of Matsubara to arbitrary order in the standard\ndeviation $\\sigma_0$ for $P(\\delta T)$ and ${\\mathrm v}_0$, where the\nperturbative expansion coefficients are explicitly given in terms of complete\nBell polynomials. The comparison of the Hermite expansions and the perturbative\nexpansions is performed for the $\\Lambda$CDM map sample and the $Planck$ data.\nWe confirm the weak level of non-Gaussianity ($1$-$2$)$\\sigma$ of the\nforeground corrected masked $Planck$ $2015$ maps.\n", "  Strong nanoscale light-matter interaction is often accompanied by\nultra-confined photonic modes and large momentum polaritons existing far beyond\nthe light cone. A direct probe of such phenomena is difficult due to the\nmomentum mismatch of these modes with free space light however, fast electron\nprobes can reveal the fundamental quantum and spatially dispersive behavior of\nthese excitations. Here, we use momentum-resolved electron energy loss\nspectroscopy (q-EELS) in a transmission electron microscope to explore the\noptical response of plasmonic thin films including momentum transfer up to\nwavevectors (q) significantly exceeding the light line wave vector. We show\nclose agreement between experimental q-EELS maps, theoretical simulations of\nfast electrons passing through thin films and the momentum-resolved photonic\ndensity of states (q-PDOS) dispersion. Although a direct link between q-EELS\nand the q-PDOS exists for an infinite medium, here we show fundamental\ndifferences between q-EELS measurements and the q-PDOS that must be taken into\nconsideration for realistic finite structures with no translational invariance\nalong the direction of electron motion. Our work paves the way for using q-EELS\nas the preeminent tool for mapping the q-PDOS of exotic phenomena with large\nmomenta (high-q) such as hyperbolic polaritons and spatially-dispersive\nplasmons.\n", "  A thermal model, based on the Tsallis distribution and blast-wave model, is\nproposed to compute hadron double-differential spectra $d^{2}N/dp_{T}dy$ in\n$pp$ (also high energy $p\\overline{p}$) collisions. It successfully describes\nthe available experimental data on pion and quarkonia ($\\phi$, $J/\\psi$,\n$\\psi(2S)$, $\\Upsilon$ family) production at energies from $\\sqrt{s} = 5$ GeV\nto the LHC ones. Simple parametrizations for the $\\sqrt{s}$ dependence of the\nmodel parameters are provided allowing predictions for the yields of these\nparticles at new collision energies. The model can be used also for the pion\nBose-Einstein correlation studies.\n", "  Assuming a steady-state condition within a cell, metabolic fluxes satisfy an\nunder-determined linear system of stoichiometric equations. Characterizing the\nspace of fluxes that satisfy such equations along with given bounds (and\npossibly additional relevant constraints) is considered of utmost importance\nfor the understanding of cellular metabolism. Extreme values for each\nindividual flux can be computed with Linear Programming (as Flux Balance\nAnalysis), and their marginal distributions can be approximately computed with\nMonte-Carlo sampling. Here we present an approximate analytic method for the\nlatter task based on Expectation Propagation equations that does not involve\nsampling and can achieve much better predictions than other existing analytic\nmethods. The method is iterative, and its computation time is dominated by one\nmatrix inversion per iteration. With respect to sampling, we show through\nextensive simulation that it has some advantages including computation time,\nand the ability to efficiently fix empirically estimated distributions of\nfluxes.\n", "  The ratio of elastic to total proton cross sections is related to the\ndarkness of the spatial profile of inelastic interactions by a single parameter\nin the framework of a simple analytical model. Their critical values at LHC\nenergies are discussed. Two possible variants of their asymptotical behavior\nare described.\n", "  We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations showing the effect of\nkinetic and radiative AGN feedback on a model galaxy representing a massive\nquiescent low-redshift early-type galaxy of $M_* = 8.41\\times 10^{10} M_\\odot$,\nharbouring a $M_\\mathrm{BH} = 4\\times 10^8 M_\\odot $ black hole surrounded by a\ncooling gaseous halo. We show that, for a total baryon fraction of $\\sim 20\\%$\nof the cosmological value, feedback from the AGN can keep the galaxy quiescent\nfor about 4.35 Gyr and with properties consistent with black hole mass and\nX-ray luminosity scaling relations. However, this can only be achieved if the\nAGN feedback model includes both kinetic and radiative feedback modes. The\nsimulation with only kinetic feedback fails to keep the model galaxy fully\nquiescent, while one with only radiative feedback leads to excessive black-hole\ngrowth. For higher baryon fractions (e.g. 50\\% of the cosmological value), the\nX-ray luminosities exceed observed values by at least one order of magnitude,\nand rapid cooling results in a star-forming galaxy. The AGN plays a major role\nin keeping the circumgalactic gas at observed metallicities of $Z/Z_\\odot\n\\gtrsim 0.3 $ within the central $\\sim 30$ kpc by venting nuclear gas enriched\nwith metals from residual star formation activity. As indicated by previous\ncosmological simulations, our results are consistent with a model for which the\nblack hole mass and the total baryon fraction are set at higher redshifts $z >\n1$ and the AGN alone can keep the model galaxy on observed scaling relations.\nModels without AGN feedback violate both the quiescence criterion as well as\nCGM metallicity constraints.\n", "  A simple expression for calculating the classical potential concerning\n$D$-dimensional gravitational models is obtained through a method based on the\ngenerating functional. The prescription is then used as a mathematical tool to\nprobe the conjecture that renormalizable higher-order gravity models --- which\nare, of course, nonunitary --- are endowed with a classical potential that is\nnonsingular at the origin. It is also shown that the converse of this statement\nis not true, which implies that the finiteness of the classical potential at\nthe origin is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the\nrenormalizability of the model. The systems we have utilized to verify the\nconjecture were fourth- and sixth- order gravity models in $D$-dimensions. A\ndiscussion about the polemic question related to the renormalizability of new\nmassive gravity, which Oda claimed to be renormalizable in 2009 and three years\nlate was shown to be nonrenormalizable by Muneyuki and Ohta, is considered. We\nremark that the solution of this issue is straightforward if the aforementioned\nconjecture is employed. We point out that our analysis is restricted to local\nmodels in which the propagator has simple and real poles.\n", "  Properties of the cold interstellar medium of low-metallicity galaxies are\nnot well-known due to the faintness and extremely small scale on which emission\nis expected. We present deep ALMA band 6 (230GHz) observations of the nearby,\nlow-metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.25) blue compact dwarf galaxy SBS0335-052 at\nan unprecedented resolution of 0.2 arcsec (52 pc). The 12CO J=2-1 line is not\ndetected and we report a 3-sigma upper limit of LCO(2-1) = 3.6x10^4 K km/s\npc^2. Assuming that molecular gas is converted into stars with a given\ndepletion time, ranging from 0.02 to 2 Gyr, we find lower limits on the\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor alpha_CO in the range 10^2-10^4 Msun pc^-2 (K\nkm/s)^-1. The continuum emission is detected and resolved over the two main\nsuper star clusters. Re-analysis of the IR-radio spectral energy distribution\nsuggests that the mm-fluxes are not only free-free emission but are most likely\nalso associated with a cold dust component coincident with the position of the\nbrightest cluster. With standard dust properties, we estimate its mass to be as\nlarge as 10^5 Msun. Both line and continuum results suggest the presence of a\nlarge cold gas reservoir unseen in CO even with ALMA.\n", "  Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films are synthesized on Si using plasma enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition. The role of substrate bias and nitrogen doping on\nthe structural evolution and local elastic modulus of DLC films are\nsystematically investigated. Raman spectroscopic studies reveal that the amount\nof graphitic C=C sp2 bonding increases with substrate bias and nitrogen doping.\nThe density and hydrogen concentration in the films are found to vary from 0.7\nto 2.2 g/cm3 and 16 to 38 atomic %, respectively, depending upon the substrate\nbias and nitrogen concentration in the DLC films. Atomic force acoustic\nmicroscopic (AFAM) analysis shows a direct correlation between local elastic\nmodulus and structural properties estimated by Raman spectroscopy, Rutherford\nback scattering and elastic recoil detection analysis. AFAM analysis further\nconfirms the evolution of soft second phases at high substrate biases (> -150V)\nin undoped DLC films. Further, N doping leads to formation of such soft second\nphases in DLC films even at lower substrate bias of -100 V. The AFAM studies\nprovide a direct microscopic evidence for the \"sub-implantation growth model\"\nwhich predicts the formation of graphitic second phases in DLC matrix at high\nsubstrate biases.\n", "  We discuss the feasibility of detecting spin polarized electronic transitions\nwith a vortex filter. This approach does not rely on the principal condition of\nthe standard energy loss magnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) technique, the\nprecise alignment of the crystal, and thus paves the way for the application of\nEMCD to new classes of materials and problems. The dichroic signal strength in\nthe L$_{2,3}$-edge of ferromagnetic cobalt is estimated on theoretical grounds.\nIt is shown that magnetic dichroism can, in principle, be detected. However, as\nan experimental test shows, count rates are currently too low under standard\nconditions.\n", "  Hyperpolarisation at room temperature is one of the most important research\nfields in order to improve liquid, gas or nanoparticle tracer for Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) in medical applications. In this paper we utilize\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the hyperpolarisation effect of\nnegatively charged nitrogen vacancy (NV) centres on carbon-13 nuclei and their\nspin diffusion in a diamond single crystal close to the excited state level\nanti crossing (ESLAC) around 50 mT. Whereas the electron spins of the NV centre\ncan be easily polarized in its m = 0 ground state at room temperature just by\nirradiation with green light , the swop of the NV electron spin polarization to\na carbon-13 nuclei is a complex task. We found that the coupling between the\npolarized NV electron spin, the electron spin of a substitutional nitrogen\nimpurity (P1) as well as its nitrogen-14 nuclei and the carbon-13 nuclear spin\nhas to be considered. Here we show that through an optimization of this\nprocedure, in about two minutes a signal to noise ratio which corresponds to a\n23 hour standard measurement without hyperpolarisation and an accumulation of\n460 single scans can be obtained. Furthermore we were able to identify several\npolarisation peaks of different sign at different magnetic fields in a region\nof some tens of gauss. Most of the peaks can be attributed to a coupling of the\nNV centres to nearby P1 centres. We present a new theoretical model in a\nframework of cross polarisation of a four spin dynamic model in good agreement\nwith our experimental data. The results demonstrate the opportunities and power\nas well as limitations of hyperpolarisation in diamond via NV centres. We\nexpect that the current work may have a significant impact on future\napplications.\n", "  An active line of research has used on-line data to study the ways in which\ndiscrete units of information---including messages, photos, product\nrecommendations, group invitations---spread through social networks. There is\nrelatively little understanding, however, of how on-line data might help in\nstudying the diffusion of more complex {\\em practices}---roughly, routines or\nstyles of work that are generally handed down from one person to another\nthrough collaboration or mentorship. In this work, we propose a framework\ntogether with a novel type of data analysis that seeks to study the spread of\nsuch practices by tracking their syntactic signatures in large document\ncollections. Central to this framework is the notion of an \"inheritance graph\"\nthat represents how people pass the practice on to others through\ncollaboration. Our analysis of these inheritance graphs demonstrates that we\ncan trace a significant number of practices over long time-spans, and we show\nthat the structure of these graphs can help in predicting the longevity of\ncollaborations within a field, as well as the fitness of the practices\nthemselves.\n", "  In this work, we study the crystalline nuclei growth in glassy systems\nfocusing primarily on the early stages of the process, at which the size of a\ngrowing nucleus is still comparable with the critical size. On the basis of\nmolecular dynamics simulation results for two crystallizing glassy systems, we\nevaluate the growth laws of the crystalline nuclei and the parameters of the\ngrowth kinetics at the temperatures corresponding to deep supercoolings;\nherein, the statistical treatment of the simulation results is done within the\nmean-first-passage-time method. It is found for the considered systems at\ndifferent temperatures that the crystal growth laws rescaled onto the waiting\ntimes of the critically-sized nucleus follow the unified dependence, that can\nsimplify significantly theoretical description of the post-nucleation growth of\ncrystalline nuclei. The evaluated size-dependent growth rates are characterized\nby transition to the steady-state growth regime, which depends on the\ntemperature and occurs in the glassy systems when the size of a growing nucleus\nbecomes two-three times larger than a critical size. It is suggested to\nconsider the temperature dependencies of the crystal growth rate\ncharacteristics by using the reduced temperature scale $\\widetilde{T}$. Thus,\nit is revealed that the scaled values of the crystal growth rate\ncharacteristics (namely, the steady-state growth rate and the attachment rate\nfor the critically-sized nucleus) as functions of the reduced temperature\n$\\widetilde{T}$ for glassy systems follow the unified power-law dependencies.\nThis finding is supported by available simulation results; the correspondence\nwith the experimental data for the crystal growth rate in glassy systems at the\ntemperatures near the glass transition is also discussed.\n", "  For spherically symmetric repulsive Hamiltonians we prove Rellich's theorem,\nor identify the largest weighted space of Agmon-H\\\"ormander type where the\ngeneralized eigenfunctions are absent. The proof is intensively dependent on\ncommutator arguments. Our novelty here is a use of conjugate operator\nassociated with some radial flow, not with dilations and translations. Our\nmethod is simple and elementary, and does not employ any advanced tools such as\nthe operational calculus or the Fourier analysis.\n", "  We investigate the coupling between interstitial medium and granular\nparticles by studying the hopper flow of dry and submerged system\nexperimentally and numerically. In accordance with earlier studies, we find,\nthat the dry hopper empties at a constant rate. However, in the submerged\nsystem we observe the surging of the flow rate. We model both systems using the\ndiscrete element method, which we couple with computational fluid dynamics in\nthe case of a submerged hopper. We are able to match the simulations and the\nexperiments with good accuracy. To do that, we fit the particle-particle\ncontact friction for each system separately, finding that submerging the hopper\nchanges the particle-particle contact friction from $\\mu_{vacuum}=0.15$ to\n$\\mu_{sub}=0.13$, while all the other simulation parameters remain the same.\nFurthermore, our experiments find a particle size dependence to the flow rate,\nwhich is comprehended based on arguments on the terminal velocity and drag.\nThese results jointly allow us to conclude that at the large particle limit,\nthe interstitial medium does not matter, in contrast to small particles. The\nparticle size limit, where this occurs depends on the viscosity of the\ninterstitial fluid.\n", "  Many link prediction algorithms require the computation of a similarity\nmetric on each vertex pair, which is quadratic in the number of vertices and\ninfeasible for large networks. We develop a class of link prediction algorithms\nbased on a spectral embedding and the k closest pairs algorithm that are\nscalable to very large networks. We compare the prediction accuracy and runtime\nof these methods to existing algorithms on several large link prediction tasks.\nOur methods achieve comparable accuracy to standard algorithms but are\nsignificantly faster.\n", "  Quantum information science addresses how the processing and transmission of\ninformation are affected by uniquely quantum mechanical phenomena. Combination\nof two-qubit gates has been used to realize quantum circuits, however,\nscalability is becoming a critical problem. The use of three-qubit gates may\nsimplify the structure of quantum circuits dramatically. Among them, the\ncontrolled-SWAP (Fredkin) gates are essential since they can be directly\napplied to important protocols, e.g., error correction, fingerprinting, and\noptimal cloning. Here we report a realization of the Fredkin gate for photonic\nqubits. We achieve a fidelity of 0.85 in the computational basis and an output\nstate fidelity of 0.81 for a 3-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. The\nestimated process fidelity of 0.77 indicates that our Fredkin gate can be\napplied to various quantum tasks.\n", "  We explain why the isotropic metric is quite appropriate to put the physical\nmeaning of spacial variables in the theory of general relativity. Using the\nisotropic metric, we conclude that i)g_{00} does not become positive even\ninside the black hole, ii) there exists the center of the Universe if the\ncurvature of the Universe k \\ne 0, iii)the Universe is spacially finite but not\ncolsed for k>0.\n", "  The recent analytical of multi-layer analyses proposed by Sajjadi, Hunt and\nDrullion (2014) (SHD14) is solved numerically for atmospheric turbulent shear\nfows blowing over unsteady Stokes water waves, of low to moderate steepness. It\nis demonstrated that as the wave steepens further the inner layer exceeds the\ncritical layer and beneath the cat's-eye there is a strong reverse flow which\nwill then affect the surface drag, but at the surface the flow adjusts itself\nto the orbital velocity of the wave. We show that in the limit as c_r=U_* is\nvery small, namely slow moving waves the energy-transfer rate to the waves,\n\\beta, computed here using an eddy-viscosity model, agrees with the asymptotic\nsteady state analysis of Belcher and Hunt (1993) and the earlier model of\nTownsend (1980). Computations for the cases when the waves are traveling faster\nand growing significantly show a critical shear layer forms outside the inner\nsurface shear layer for steeper waves. We show that the critical layer produces\na significant but not the dominant effect; a weak lee-side jet is formed by the\ninertial dynamics in the critical layer, which adds to the drag produced by the\nsheltering effect. Over peaked waves, the inner layer flow on the lee-side\ntends to slow and separate, which over a growing fast wave defects the\nstreamlines and the critical layer upwards on the lee side. Hence, it is\nproposed, using an earlier study SHD14, that the mechanisms identified here for\nwave-induced motion contributes to a larger net growth of wind driven water\nwaves when the waves are non-linear compared with growth rates for\nmonochromatic waves. This is because in non- linear waves individual harmonics\nhave stronger positive and weaker negative growth rates.\n", "  A system of two coupled cavities with $N-1$ photons is shown to be\ndynamically equivalent to an array of $N$ coupled cavities containing one\nphoton. Every transition in the two cavity system has a dual phenomenon in\nterms of photon transport in the cavity array. This duality is employed to\narrive at the required coupling strengths and nonlinearities in the cavity\narray so that controlled photon transfer is possible between any two cavities.\nThis transfer of photons between two of the cavities in the array is effected\nwithout populating the other cavities. The condition for perfect transport\nenables perfect state transfer between any two cavities in the array. Further,\npossibility of high fidelity generation of generalized NOON states in two\ncoupled cavities, which are dual to the Bell states of the photon in the cavity\narray, is established.\n", "  Here we develop two quantum-computational models for supervised and\nunsupervised classification tasks in quantum world. Presuming that the states\nof a set of given quantum systems (or objects) belong to one of two known\nclasses, the objective here is to decide to which of these classes each system\nbelongs---without knowing its state. The supervised binary classification\nalgorithm is based on having a training sample of quantum systems whose class\nmemberships are already known. The unsupervised binary classification\nalgorithm, however, uses a quantum oracle which knows the class memberships of\nthe states of the computational basis. Both algorithms require the ability to\nevaluate the fidelity between states of the quantum systems with unknown\nstates, for which here we also develop a general scheme.\n", "  We report the direct observation of the in-situ temperature-dependent surface\nsegregation of Ni adatoms on single crystalline Pd surfaces using Positron\nannihilation induced Auger Electron Spectroscopy (PAES). For this study, a\nsingle atomic layer of Ni was grown on Pd with the crystallographic\norientations Pd(111), Pd(110) and Pd(100). The sample temperature was increased\nfrom room temperature to 350$^\\circ$C and the intensity of the Ni and Pd signal\nwas evaluated from the recorded PAES spectra. Due to the outstanding surface\nsensitivity of PAES a clear tendency for Pd segregation was observed for all\nsamples. Moreover the activation temperature T$_0$ for surface segregation was\nfound to depend strongly on the surface orientation: We determined T$_0$ to\n172$\\pm$4$^\\circ$C, 261$\\pm$12$^\\circ$C and 326$\\pm$11$^\\circ$C for Pd(111),\nPd(100) and Pd(110), respectively.\n", "  In this work, we initially discuss some physical properties of effective\n${\\rm SU}(N) \\to {\\rm Z}(N)$ YMH models, emphasizing the important role of\nvalence gluons. Next, we review how adjoint fields are naturally generated as\nan effective description of \"adjoint\" loops in $4D$. Finally, we discuss the\nconsequences that can be learnt from this point of view, and briefly comment on\nsome improvements.\n", "  We exploit the equality of Bergman analytic content and torsional rigidity of\na simply connected domain to develop a new method for calculating these\nquantities. This method is particularly suitable for the case when the region\nin question is a polygon. A large number of examples are computed in explicit\ndetail to demonstrate the utility of our ideas.\n", "  Many of the baryons in our Galaxy probably lie outside the well known disk\nand bulge components. Despite a wealth of evidence for the presence of some gas\nin galactic halos, including absorption line systems in the spectra of quasars,\nhigh velocity neutral hydrogen clouds in our Galaxy halo, line emitting ionised\nhydrogen originating from galactic winds in nearby starburst galaxies, and the\nX-ray coronas surrounding the most massive galaxies, accounting for the gas in\nthe halo of any galaxy has been observationally challenging primarily because\nof its low density in the expansive halo. The most sensitive measurements come\nfrom detecting absorption by the intervening gas in the spectra of distant\nobjects such as quasars or distant halo stars, but these have typically been\nlimited to a few lines of sight to sufficiently bright objects. Massive\nspectroscopic surveys of millions of objects provide an alternative approach to\nthe problem. Here, we present the first evidence for a widely distributed,\nneutral, excited hydrogen component of the Galaxy's halo. It is observed as the\nslight, (0.779 $\\pm$ 0.006)\\%, absorption of flux near the rest wavelength of\nH$\\alpha$ in the combined spectra of hundreds of thousands of galaxy spectra\nand is ubiquitous in high latitude lines of sight. This observation provides an\navenue to tracing, both spatially and kinematically, the majority of the gas in\nthe halo of our Galaxy.\n", "  Gaussian unitaries are specified by a second order polynomial in the bosonic\noperators, that is, by a quadratic polynomial and a linear term. From the\nHamiltonian other equivalent representations of the Gaussian unitaries are\nobtained, such as Bogoliubov and real symplectic transformations. The paper\ndevelops an alternative representation, called complex symplectic\ntransformation, which is more compact and is comprehensive of both Bogoliubov\nand real symplectic transformations. Moreover, it has other advantages. One of\nthe main results of the theory, not available in the literature, is that the\nfinal displacement is not simply given by the linear part of the Hamiltonian,\nbut depends also on the quadratic part. In particular, it is shown that by\ncombining squeezing and rotation, it is possible to achieve a final\ndisplacement with an arbitrary amount.\n", "  An alternative multipole expansion of the correlation term is derived.\nModified spherical Bessel type functions which simplify as a summation of\nmultiple orders of basic trigonometric functions are generated from this new\nmethod. We use this new expansion to obtain useful insights into the\nelectron-electron interaction. An analytic expression for the electronic\ncorrelation term is suggested. Also, a pseudopotential for helium-like system\nis derived from this alternative expansion, and some reasonable eigenvalues for\nthe ground state and two autoionizing levels of helium atom, is provided as a\ntest of efficiency of this solution approach. With some additional corrections\nbeyond the non-relativistic limit, a helium atom groundstate energy of -2.9036\nis obtained using the analytical form derived from this method and the Slater\ndeterminant expansion of the wavefunction.\n", "  A frequency-diverse computational imaging system synthesized using\nthree-dimensional (3D) printed frequency-diverse metasurface antennas is\ndemonstrated. The 3D fabrication of the antennas is achieved using a\ncombination of PolyLactic Acid (PLA) polymer material and conductive polymer\nmaterial (Electrifi), circumventing the requirement for expensive and\ntime-consuming conventional fabrication techniques, such as machine milling,\nphotolithography and laser-etching. Using the 3D printed frequency- diverse\nmetasurface antennas, a composite aperture is designed and simulated for\nimaging in the K-band frequency regime (17.5-26.5 GHz). The frequency-diverse\nsystem is capable of imaging by means of a simple frequency-sweep in an-all\nelectronic manner, avoiding mechanical scanning and active circuit components.\nUsing the synthesized system, microwave imaging of objects is achieved at the\ndiffraction limit. It is also demonstrated that the conductivity of the\nElectrifi polymer material significantly affects the performance of the 3D\nprinted antennas and therefore is a critical factor governing the fidelity of\nthe reconstructed images.\n", "  In this paper, we study the dynamics of a Bianchi Type I potential in the\npresence of a concave potential of the form $V(\\phi) = V_0 \\left[1- \\left(\n\\frac{\\phi}{\\mu}\\right)^n\\right]$, where $V_0$ is a constant, and $\\mu$ is a\nmass scale. We show that there are two classes of equilibrium points. The first\nclass corresponds to $\\phi \\neq 0$, $\\mu \\neq 0$, $n = 0$, and $\\dot{\\phi} =\n0$, which describe expanding and contracting de Sitter universes, for which the\nshear anisotropy is zero. We show that the expanding de Sitter universe is a\nlocal sink of the system, and therefore has associated to it a stable manifold.\nThus, orbits will approach this point at late times. In other words, such a\nmodel is found to inflate and isotropize at late times as long as $n = 0$. The\nsecond class of equilibrium points corresponds to an expanding and contracting\nanisotropic universe. However, these points are found to emerge only when $n >\n1$, $\\phi = \\dot{\\phi} = 0$, which importantly implies that $V = V_0 < 0$ at\nthis point in order to ensure that the square of the shear scalar, $\\sigma^2$\nis real. Therefore, such equilibrium points correspond to the ekpyrotic\ncosmological models. Further, we show that for $n = 2$, by Lyapunov's stability\ntheorem, the expanding equilibrium point is asymptotically stable, while for $n\n> 2$, a two-dimensional stable manifold exists corresponding to the fact that\nfor $n > 2$, such an equilibrium point represents a local sink of the system.\nFinally, we give a general condition for inflation to occur in this model in\nterms of the deceleration parameter, and show that the expanding ekpyrotic\nequilibrium point undergoes the phenomenon of anisotropic inflation if\n$-3\\Lambda/5 < V_0 < 0$, where $\\Lambda > 0$ is the cosmological constant.\n", "  We electrically detect charge current induced spin polarization on the\nsurface of molecular beam epitaxy grown Bi$_2$Te$_3$ thin film in a\ntwo-terminal device with a ferromagnetic MgO/Fe and a nonmagnetic Ti/Au\ncontact. The two-point resistance, measured in an applied magnetic field, shows\na hysteresis tracking the magnetization of the Fe. A theoretical estimate is\nobtained for the change in resistance on reversing the magnetization direction\nof Fe from coupled spin-charge transport equations based on quantum kinetic\ntheory. The order of magnitude and the sign of the hysteresis is consistent\nwith spin-polarized surface state of Bi$_2$Te$_3$.\n", "  Plasmonic and Mie resonances in subwavelength nanostructures provide an\nefficient way to manipulate light below the diffraction limit that has fostered\nthe growth of plasmonics and nanophotonics. Plasmonic resonances have been\nmainly related with the excitation of free charge carriers, initially in\nmetals, and Mie resonances have been identified in Si nanostructures.\nRemarkably, although much less studied, semi-metals, semiconductors and\ntopological insulators of the p-block enable plasmonic resonances without free\ncharge carriers and Mie resonances with enhanced properties compared with Si.\nIn this review, we explain how interband transitions in these materials show a\nmajor role in this duality. We evaluate the plasmonic and Mie performance of\nnanostructures made of relevant p-block elements and compounds, especially Bi,\nand discuss their promising potential for applications ranging from switchable\nplasmonics and nanophotonics to energy conversion, especially photocatalysis.\n", "  A stochastic orbital approach to the resolution of identity (RI)\napproximation for 4-index 2-electron electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) is\npresented. The stochastic RI-ERIs are then applied to M\\o ller-Plesset\nperturbation theory (MP2) utilizing a \\textit{multiple stochastic orbital\napproach}. The introduction of multiple stochastic orbitals results in an $N^3$\nscaling for both the stochastic RI-ERIs and stochastic RI-MP2. We demonstrate\nthat this method exhibits a small prefactor and an observed scaling of\n$N^{2.4}$ for a range of water clusters, already outperforming MP2 for clusters\nwith as few as 21 water molecules.\n", "  We generate hierarchies of derivative nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger-type equations\nand their nonlocal extensions from Lie algebra splittings and automorphisms.\nThis provides an algebraic explanation of some known reductions and newly\nestablished nonlocal reductions in integrable systems.\n", "  Using first-principles calculation methods, we study the possibility of\nrealizing quantum anomalous Hall effect in graphene from stable\n3\\textit{d}-atomic adsorption via charge-compensated \\textit{n}-\\textit{p}\ncodoping scheme. As concrete examples, we show that long-range ferromagnetism\ncan be established by codoping 3\\textit{d} transition metal and boron atoms,\nbut only the Ni codopants can open up a global bulk gap to harbour the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect. Our estimated ferromagnetic Curie transition temperature\ncan reach over 10 Kelvin for various codoping concentrations.\n", "  Study of astrophysics of black holes and neutron stars has taken a new turn\nin the present decade with the realization that sub-Keplerian flows and the\nassociated centrifugal barrier near the horizon or the surface of a neutron\nstar play a major role in deciding the nature of the emitted spectra and the\nformation of outflows from the accreting matter. This region may remain steady\nor oscillate depending on the accretion rate, specific angular momentum and\nspecific energy of the flow. Intricacies of oscillation may depend on the\ndegree of feedback the inflow receives from the outflow. This region may emit\nhard or soft X-rays depending on relative numbers of hot elections and soft\nphotons intercepted by this region. We discuss how these properties come about\nand how they explain the observational results of black hole candidates.\n", "  The paper addresses a method for spreading messages in social networks\nthrough an initial acceleration by Spreading Groups. These groups start the\nspread which eventually reaches a larger portion of the network. The use of\nspreading groups creates a final flow which resembles the spread through the\nnodes with the highest level of influence (opinion leaders). While harnessing\nopinion leaders to spread messages is generally costly, the formation of\nspreading groups is merely a technical issue, and can be done by computerized\nbots. The paper presents an information flow model and inspects the model\nthrough a dataset of Nasdaq-related tweets.\n", "  We study the formation of domain structures due to spontaneous breakdown of\ncenter symmetry at high temperatures in quenched QCD. We develop a\nphenomenological model for the explicit propagation of the Polyakov loop as the\nrelevant order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition. The surface\ntension in the equation of motion is fit in comparison with lattice QCD data.\nResults give insight into the dynamical formation of center domains as well as\nthe formation of energy bands along domain walls and let us estimate the\nrequired time to form such structures above the critical temperature.\n", "  Integrated micro-nanochannel networks in fluidic devices are desirable in a\nnumber of applications ranging from self-healing/cooling materials to\nbioengineering. The conventional micro-manufacturing techniques are capable of\neither producing microchannel or nanochannel networks for a fluidic application\nbut lack proficiency in the production of an integrated micro-nanochannel\nnetwork with a smooth transition from micro-to-nano scale dimension. In\naddition, these techniques possess limitations such as heavy initial\ninvestment, sophistication in operation and scale-up capabilities. Therefore,\nthe current paper demonstrates the combination of micro/nanotechnologies to\ndesign and develop a biomimetic 3-D integrated micro-nanochannel network in\nPDMS device for solute exchange. We have used 3-D printer, a scalable\ntechnology, to design and manufacture micro-mold having fractal-shaped\nfeatures. Further, electrospinning was used to deposit nanofibrous network on\nthe fractal mold. Subsequent micro-molding with PDMS was used to obtain\nfractal-shaped microchannels integrated with embedded nanofibers. Henceforth,\nsolvent etching of nanofibers followed by bonding of thin PDMS membrane\ngenerated by spin coating to open end of channels leads to the formation of\nfunctional microdevices. These PDMS devices mimic the natural vasculature of a\nliving system, where fractal-shaped microchannels will assist in efficient\nfluid flow and the site of nanovascular network participates in heat/mass\ntransport operations. Further, dye flow propounds the functionality of such\ndevices. Our study hence proposes a simple and scalable hybrid microtechnolgy\nto fabricate fluidic devices having multiscale architecture. This will also\nfacilitate the rapid fabrication of microfluidic devices for biomedical,\ndiagnostics, sensors and micro-TAS applications.\n", "  We consider the quantum dynamics of gravitational collapse in a model in\nwhich the wave function spreads out over a large ensemble of geometries as\nenvisioned in the fuzzball proposal. We show that the probabilities of\ncoarse-grained observables are highly peaked around the classical black hole\nvalues. By contrast, probabilities for finer-grained observables probing the\nneighbourhood of collapsed objects are more broadly distributed and no notion\nof `averaging' applies to them. This implies that the formation of fuzzballs\ngives rise to distinct observational signatures that are more significant than\nhas hitherto been thought and may be tested against observations in the near\nfuture. We also predict a novel kind of gravitational wave burst associated\nwith the spreading of the wave function in gravitational collapse.\n", "  iGVPT2 is a program for computing anharmonic corrections to vibration\nfrequencies, based on force field expansion of the potential energy surface in\nnormal mode coordinates. It includes second order vibrational perturbation\ntheory (VPT2) algorithm and its derived methods (VPT2+K, DCPT2, HDCPT2). iGVPT2\nis interfaced with several computation chemistry packages to compute the\npotential energies and dipoles derivatives. The second, third and quartic\nderivatives can be computed at the same level of theory but they can be also\ncomputed using different methods via one or two computational packages. iGPVT2\nincludes also a very fast hybrid QM//MM approach for biomolecules. It is\nprovided free-of-charge for non-commercial research (see\n\\url{https://sites.google.com/site/allouchear/igvpt2}).\n", "  Quantum machine learning witnesses an increasing amount of quantum algorithms\nfor data-driven decision making, a problem with potential applications ranging\nfrom automated image recognition to medical diagnosis. Many of those algorithms\nare implementations of quantum classifiers, or models for the classification of\ndata inputs with a quantum computer. Following the success of collective\ndecision making with ensembles in classical machine learning, this paper\nintroduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers. Creating\nthe ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine, after which the\nquantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is\naccessed by a single-qubit measurement. This framework naturally allows for\nexponentially large ensembles in which -- similar to Bayesian learning -- the\nindividual classifiers do not have to be trained. As an example, we analyse an\nexponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed\naccording to its performance in classifying the training data, leading to new\nresults for quantum as well as classical machine learning.\n", "  Nanographitic structures (NGSs) with multitude of morphological features are\ngrown on SiO2/Si substrates by electron cyclotron resonance - plasma enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition (ECR-PECVD). CH4 is used as source gas with Ar and H2\nas dilutants. Field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution\ntransmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy are used to\nstudy the structural and morphological features of the grown films. Herein, we\ndemonstrate, how the morphology can be tuned from planar to vertical structure\nusing single control parameter namely, dilution of CH4 with Ar and/or H2. Our\nresults show that the competitive growth and etching processes dictate the\nmorphology of the NGSs. While Ar-rich composition favors vertically oriented\ngraphene nanosheets, H2-rich composition aids growth of planar films. Raman\nanalysis reveals dilution of CH4 with either Ar or H2 or in combination helps\nto improve the structural quality of the films. Line shape analysis of Raman 2D\nband shows nearly symmetric Lorentzian profile which confirms the turbostratic\nnature of the grown NGSs. Further, this aspect is elucidated by HRTEM studies\nby observing elliptical diffraction pattern. Based on these experiments, a\ncomprehensive understanding is obtained on the growth and structural properties\nof NGSs grown over a wide range of feedstock compositions.\n", "  Vaidman's analysis of the photon's past is based on incorrect interpretation\nof quantum probability amplitudes. The confusion stems from his original work\n[{\\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} \\textbf{60}, 1351 (1988)], which missed the connection\nbetween the amplitudes and the \"weak values\" introduced therein.\n", "  In this text we describe the role of optical chirality in the context of\nplasmonics. We clearly distinguish between 2D an 3D optical chirality and\nconnect the problem with reciprocity and time symmetry. We compare our analysis\nwith recent experimental results in nano-plasmonics and photonics.\n", "  In contrast to well studied multiferroic manganites with a spiral structure,\nthe electric polarization in multiferroic borates is induced within collinear\nantiferromagnetic structure and can easily be switched by small static fields.\nBecause of specific symmetry conditions, static and dynamic properties in\nborates are directly connected, which leads to giant magnetoelectric and\nmagnetodielectric effects. Here we prove experimentally that the giant\nmagnetodielectric effect in samarium ferroborate SmFe3(BO3)4 is of intrinsic\norigin and is caused by an unusually large electromagnon situated in the\nmicrowave range. This electromagnon reveals strong optical activity exceeding\n120 degrees of polarization rotation in a millimeter thick sample.\n", "  Dynamic magnetic properties of magnetoelectric TmAl3(BO3)4 borate have been\ninvestigated by terahertz spectroscopy. Crystal field (CF) transitions within\nthe ground multiplet 3H6 of Tm3+ ions are observed and they are identified as\nmagnetic-dipole transitions from the ground singlet A1 to the next excited\ndoublet E of Tm3+ ions. Unexpected fine structure of the transitions is\ndetected at low temperatures. The new modes are assigned to local distortions\nof the sites with D3 symmetry by Bi3+ impurities, which resulted in the\nsplitting of A1 -> E transition. Two types of locally distorted sites are\nidentified and investigated. The main contribution to the static magnetic\nsusceptibility is shown to be determined by the matrix elements of the observed\nmagnetic transitions. We demonstrate that even in case of local distortions the\nsymmetry of the undistorted crystal is recovered for magnetic and for quadratic\nmagnetoelectric susceptibilities.\n", "  We propose a scheme to generate Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state for N\nsuperconducting qubits in a circuit QED system. By sinusoidally modulating the\nqubit-qubit coupling, a synthetic magnetic field has been made which broken the\ntime-reversal symmetry of the system. Directional rotation of qubit excitation\ncan be realized in a three-qubit loop under the artificial magnetic field.\nBased on the special quality that the rotation of qubit excitation has\ndifferent direction for single- and double-excitation loops, we can generate\nthree-qubit GHZ state and extend this preparation method to arbitrary\nmultiqubit GHZ state. Our analysis also shows that the scheme is robust to\nvarious operation errors and environmental noise.\n", "  In this paper, a feasibility of semi-classical electromagnetic description\ntogether with experimental data, T-K-H topological and dynamic models and\ntheory of vortex considered to justify the relation between superconductivity\nphenomena and magnetic monopole. We find that the electromagnetic energy of\nmagnetic monopole is in agreement with vortex energy in topological theory and\nit can get close to thermal energy at room temperature. Indeed, these models\nsuggest that the origin of the hot superconductivity may be magnetic monopoles\nwith QM-Cl = 137 e (magnetic charge in classical approach) or QM-Q =137/2 e\n(magnetic charge in quantum approach), and the electrical conductivity is\nrelated to the mobile monopole or vortices. This research shows that the\nelectrical permittivity ({\\epsilon}) and magnetic permeability ({\\mu}) of\nmatter have a key role in the superconductive properties. We propose that this\nmodel may justify the hot superconductivity properties.\n", "  BaZrO3 exhibits excellent proton conductivity and good high-temperature\nstability. It is therefore a promising electrolyte material for solid oxide\nfuel cells. The stability of BaZrO3 at high temperatures is generally explained\nby the low diffusivity of the O vacancy. Present first-principle\nDensity-Functional-Theory calculations show that the slow migration of the\ndoubly positively charged O vacancy at high temperature cannot be solely caused\nby the ground-state migration energy but by the contribution of phonon\nexcitations to the free migration energy. With increasing temperature, the\neffective barrier for oxygen vacancy migration increases. At about 1000K, which\nis the operating temperature of fuel cells, the calculated O vacancy\ndiffusivity is more than one order of magnitude lower than that determined\nusing solely the ground-state migration barrier. The calculated diffusivity\ndata agree well with experimental results from literature. The present work\nreveals that the high-temperature stability of BaZrO3 is mainly due to the\nphonon contribution to the free migration energy of the O vacancy.\n", "  In this paper, we study coherence-induced state ordering with Tsallis\nrelative entropy of coherence, relative entropy of coherence and $l_{1}$ norm\nof coherence. Firstly, we show that these measures give the same ordering for\nsingle-qubit states with a fixed mixedness or a fixed length along the\ndirection $\\sigma_{z}$. Secondly, we consider some special cases of high\ndimensional states, we show that these measures generate the same ordering for\nthe set of high dimensional pure states if any two states of the set satisfy\nmajorization relation. Moreover, these three measures generate the same\nordering for all $X$ states with a fixed mixedness. Finally, we discuss\ndynamics of coherence-induced state ordering under Markovian channels. We find\nphase damping channel don't change the coherence-induced state ordering for\nsome single-qubit states with fixed mixedness, instead amplitude damping\nchannel change the coherence-induced ordering even though for single-qubit\nstates with fixed mixedness.\n", "  Exfoliation of lamellar materials into their corresponding layers represented\na breakthrough, due to the outstanding properties arising from the nanometric\nthickness confinement. Among the cleavage techniques, liquid-phase exfoliation\nis now on the rise because it is scalable and leads to easy-to-manipulate\ncolloids. However, all appropriate exfoliating solvents exhibit strong\npolarity, which restrains a lot the scope of feasible functionalization or\nprocessing of the resulting flakes. Here we propose to extend this scope,\ndemonstrating that nanosheets exfoliated in a polar medium can be properly\ndispersed in a non-polar solvent. To that purpose, we prepared suspensions of\nmolybdenum disulfide flakes in isopropanol/water and developed a phase transfer\nof the nanosheets to chloroform via precipitation and\nredispersion/centrifugation sequences, without any assisting surfactant. The\ncolloidal stability of the nanosheets in chloroform was found to be governed by\ntheir lateral dimensions and, although lower than in polar media, proved to be\nhigh enough to open the way to subsequent functionalization or processing of\nthe flakes in non-polar medium.\n", "  Our recent paper (arXiv:1701.04298 [quant-ph]) discussed the occurrence of a\ncoupling of centre of mass and internal degrees of freedom for complex quantum\nsystems in non-inertial frames. There, we pointed out that an external force\nsupporting the system against gravity plays a crucial role for the coupling\nbetween center of mass position to the internal degrees of freedom. In a\ncomment (arXiv:1702.06670 [quant-ph]) to our paper, Pikovski et al. question\nour conclusion and present the argument that the lack of the coupling term\nwould be in contradiction with the observation of gravitational time dilation\nusing atomic clocks. Here, we elaborate on our results in reply to their\ncriticism and clarify why our arguments remain valid.\n", "  Helmholtz decomposition theorem for vector fields is usually presented with\ntoo strong restrictions on the fields and only for time independent fields.\nBlumenthal showed in 1905 that decomposition is possible for any asymptotically\nweakly decreasing vector field. He used a regularization method in his proof\nwhich can be extended to prove the theorem even for vector fields\nasymptotically increasing sublinearly. Blumenthal's result is then applied to\nthe time-dependent fields of the dipole radiation and an artificial sublinearly\nincreasing field.\n", "  The entropy principle in the formulation of M\\\"{u}ller and Liu is a common\ntool used in constitutive modelling for the development of restrictions on the\nunknown constitutive functions describing material properties of various\nphysical continua. In the current work, a symbolic software implementation of\nthe Liu algorithm, based on \\verb|Maple| software and the \\verb|GeM| package,\nis presented. The computational framework is used to algorithmically perform\ntechnically demanding symbolic computations related to the entropy principle,\nto simplify and reduce Liu's identities, and ultimately to derive explicit\nformulas describing classes of constitutive functions that do not violate the\nentropy principle. Detailed physical examples are presented and discussed.\n", "  The Kuramoto model is a system of nonlinear differential equations that\nmodels networks of coupled oscillators and is often used to study\nsynchronization among the oscillators. In this paper we study steady state\nsolutions of the Kuramoto model by assigning to each steady state a tuple of\nintegers which records how the state twists around the cycles in the network.\nWe then use this new classification of steady states to obtain a \"Weyl\" type of\nasymptotic estimate for the number of steady states as the number of\noscillators becomes arbitrarily large while preserving the cycle structure. We\nfurther show how this asymptotic estimate can be maximized, and as a special\ncase we obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the number of stable steady states\nof the model.\n", "  We investigate a quantum dot (Anderson impurity) coupled to metallic leads,\nwith a time-periodic voltage bias across the device. Using a time-dependent\nSchrieffer-Wolff transformation, we show that the Floquet Hamiltonian of the\nmodel can be mapped onto a two-channel Kondo model, in which the impurity is\nscreened by separate conduction bands corresponding to parity-even and odd\nsuperpositions of the metallic leads. By changing the frequency and amplitude\nof the perturbation, one can tune the system to a quantum critical point with\nsymmetric coupling of the impurity to both channels. For the understanding of\nthe driven state, energy absorption from the drive must be considered: Although\nthe absorption at the impurity is balanced by the energy flow into the\nconduction band, locally it leads to non-thermal distribution functions which\ncan have a detrimental effect on the Kondo physics. However, a numerical\nsimulation demonstrates that the absorption can be systematically suppressed at\na fixed value of the induced couplings by increasing the frequency, so that the\ntime-averaged dynamics in the driven one-channel Anderson model can be used to\nstudy the critical behavior of the two-channel model.\n", "  Density operators are one of the key ingredients of quantum theory. They can\nbe constructed in two ways: via a convex sum of `doubled kets' (i.e. mixing),\nand by tracing out part of a `doubled' two-system ket (i.e. dilation). Both\nconstructions can be iterated, yielding new mathematical species that have\nalready found applications outside physics. However, as we show in this paper,\nthe iterated constructions no longer yield the same mathematical species.\nHence, the constructions `mixing' and `dilation' themselves are by no means\nequivalent. Concretely, when applying the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism to the\nsecond iteration, dilation produces arbitrary symmetric bipartite states, while\nmixing only yields the disentangled ones. All results are proven using\ndiagrams, and hence they hold not only for quantum theory, but also for a much\nmore general class of process theories.\n"]}
