However there exist astrophysical foregrounds and among them,\ngravitational waves from neutron star (NS) binaries are the solid and strong\ncomponent that must be identified and subtracted. In this paper, we discuss the\ngeometry of detector configurations preferable for identifying the NS/NS binary\nsignals. As a first step, we analytically estimate the minimum signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) of the binaries for several static detector configurations that\nare characterized by adjustable geometrical parameters, and determine the\noptimal values for these parameters. Next we perform numerical simulations to\ntake into account the effect of detector motions, and find reasonable\nagreements with the analytical results. We show that, with the standard network\nformed by 4 units of triangle detectors, the proposed BBO sensitivity would be\nsufficient in receiving gravitational waves from all the NS/NS binaries at\n$z\\le 5$ with SNRs higher than 25. We also discuss the minimum sensitivity of\nDECIGO required for the foreground identification.\n", "  We consider the Dirichlet Laplacian in a waveguide of uniform width and\ninfinite length which is ideally divided into three parts: a \"vertex region\",\ncompactly supported and with non zero curvature, and two \"edge regions\" which\nare semi-infinite straight strips. We make the waveguide collapse onto a graph\nby squeezing the edge regions to half-lines and the vertex region to a point.\nIn a setting in which the ratio between the width of the waveguide and the\nlongitudinal extension of the vertex region goes to zero, we prove the\nconvergence of the operator to a selfadjoint realization of the Laplacian on a\ntwo edged graph. In the limit operator, the boundary conditions in the vertex\ndepend on the spectral properties of an effective one dimensional Hamiltonian\nassociated to the vertex region.\n", "  The ALICE experiment has measured the inclusive J/$\\psi$ production in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}} } = 2.76$ TeV down to zero transverse\nmomentum in the rapidity range $2.5 < y < 4$. A suppression of the inclusive\nJ/$\\psi$ yield in Pb-Pb is observed with respect to the one measured in pp\ncollisions scaled by the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions. The\nnuclear modification factor, integrated over the 0-80% most central collisions,\nis $0.545 \\pm 0.032 \\rm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.083 \\rm{(syst.)}$ and does not exhibit a\nsignificant dependence on the collision centrality. These features appear\nsignificantly different from measurements at lower collision energies. Models\nincluding J/$\\psi$ production from charm quarks in a deconfined partonic phase\ncan describe our data.\n", "  Measurements of the sphericity of primary charged particles in minimum bias\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=0.9$, 2.76 and 7 TeV with the ALICE\ndetector at the LHC are presented. The observable is linearized to be collinear\nsafe and is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction using\nprimary charged tracks with $p_{\\rm T}\\geq0.5$ GeV/c in $|\\eta|\\leq0.8$. The\nmean sphericity as a function of the charged particle multiplicity at\nmid-rapidity ($N_{\\rm ch}$) is reported for events with different $p_{\\rm T}$\nscales (\"soft\" and \"hard\") defined by the transverse momentum of the leading\nparticle. In addition, the mean charged particle transverse momentum versus\nmultiplicity is presented for the different event classes, and the sphericity\ndistributions in bins of multiplicity are presented. The data are compared with\ncalculations of standard Monte Carlo event generators. The transverse\nsphericity is found to grow with multiplicity at all collision energies, with a\nsteeper rise at low $N_{\\rm ch}$, whereas the event generators show the\nopposite tendency. The combined study of the sphericity and the mean $p_{\\rm\nT}$ with multiplicity indicates that most of the tested event generators\nproduce events with higher multiplicity by generating more back-to-back jets\nresulting in decreased sphericity (and isotropy). The PYTHIA6 generator with\ntune PERUGIA-2011 exhibits a noticeable improvement in describing the data,\ncompared to the other tested generators.\n", "  The $p_{\\rm T}$-differential production cross sections of the prompt (B\nfeed-down subtracted) charmed mesons D$^0$, D$^+$, and D$^{*+}$ in the rapidity\nrange $|y|<0.5$, and for transverse momentum $1< p_{\\rm T} <12$ GeV/$c$, were\nmeasured in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV with the ALICE\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis exploited the hadronic\ndecays D$^0 \\rightarrow $K$\\pi$, D$^+ \\rightarrow $K$\\pi\\pi$, D$^{*+}\n\\rightarrow $D$^0\\pi$, and their charge conjugates, and was performed on a\n$L_{\\rm int} = 1.1$ nb$^{-1}$ event sample collected in 2011 with a\nminimum-bias trigger. The total charm production cross section at $\\sqrt{s} =\n2.76$ TeV and at 7 TeV was evaluated by extrapolating to the full phase space\nthe $p_{\\rm T}$-differential production cross sections at $\\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV\nand our previous measurements at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. The results were compared\nto existing measurements and to perturbative-QCD calculations. The fraction of\ncdbar D mesons produced in a vector state was also determined.\n", "  To estimate influence of the \"dark energy\" on the Keplerian orbits, we solve\nthe general relativistic equations of motion of a test particle in the field of\na point-like mass embedded in the cosmological background formed by the\nLambda-term with realistic cosmological Robertson-Walker asymptotics at\ninfinity. It is found that under certain relations between three crucial\nparameters of the problem--the initial radius of the orbit, Schwarzschild and\nde Sitter radii--the specific secular perturbation caused by the Lambda-term\nbecomes significant, i.e. can reach the rate of the standard Hubble flow. This\nfact is interesting both by itself and may have important consequences for the\nlong-term dynamics of planets and stellar binary systems.\n", "  The distinction between a theory's kinematics and its dynamics, that is,\nbetween the space of physical states it posits and its law of evolution, is\ncentral to the conceptual framework of many physicists. A change to the\nkinematics of a theory, however, can be compensated by a change to its dynamics\nwithout empirical consequence, which strongly suggests that these features of\nthe theory, considered separately, cannot have physical significance. It must\ntherefore be concluded (with apologies to Minkowski) that henceforth kinematics\nby itself, and dynamics by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows,\nand only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality. The\nnotion of causal structure seems to provide a good characterization of this\nunion.\n", "  We study the impact of finite mass effects due to top and bottom loops in the\njet-veto distribution for Higgs production. We discuss the appearance of\nnon-factorizing logarithms in the region pt > m_b. We study their numerical\nimpact and argue that these terms can be treated as a finite remainder. We\ntherefore detail our prescription for resumming the jet-vetoed cross section\nand for assessing its uncertainty in the presence of finite mass effects.\nResummation for the jet-veto, including mass effects, has been implemented in\nthe public code JetVHeto.\n", "  In the framework of standard electrodynamics with linear local response, we\nconstruct a model that provides spontaneously broken transparency. The\nfunctional dependence of the medium parameter turns out to be of the Higgs\ntype.\n", "  The study of random graphs and networks had an explosive development in the\nlast couple of decades. Meanwhile, techniques for the statistical analysis of\nsequences of networks were less developed. In this paper we focus on networks\nsequences with a fixed number of labeled nodes and study some statistical\nproblems in a nonparametric framework. We introduce natural notions of center\nand a depth function for networks that evolve in time. We develop several\nstatistical techniques including testing, supervised and unsupervised\nclassification, and some notions of principal component sets in the space of\nnetworks. Some examples and asymptotic results are given, as well as two real\ndata examples.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations and non-equilibrium Green's function\nmethod, we investigate the ballistic thermal transport in single-layer\nphosphorene. A significant crystallographic orientation dependence of thermal\nconductance is observed, with room temperature thermal conductance along zigzag\ndirection being 40 percent higher than that along armchair direction.\nFurthermore, we find that the thermal conductance anisotropy with the\norientation can be tuned by applying strain. In particular, the zigzag-oriented\nthermal conductance is enhanced when a zigzag-oriented strain is applied but\ndecreases when an armchair-oriented strain is applied; whereas the\narmchair-oriented thermal conductance always decreases when either a zigzag- or\nan armchair-oriented strain is applied. The present work suggests that the\nremarkable thermal transport anisotropy and its strain-modulated effect in\nsingle-layer phosphorene may be used for thermal management in\nphosphorene-based electronics and optoelectronic devices.\n", "  In this note we analyse the excess in the $W^+W^-$ inclusive cross section\nrecently measured by the LHC experiments. We point out that in fact for the\nATLAS fiducial cross sections there is no excess in the measurements compared\nto the NLO QCD predictions. We also argue that higher order effects to the\nfiducial cross section are small, and tend to cancel each other, hence the\ninclusion of NNLO and NNLL corrections will not modify this agreement\nsignificantly. We find that at 8 TeV a substantial part of the disagreement\nwith the NLO prediction for the total cross section observed by ATLAS is due to\nthe extrapolation carried out with POWHEG.\n", "  We study properties of the fourth rank elasticity tensor C within linear\nelasticity theory. First C is irreducibly decomposed under the linear group\ninto a \"Cauchy piece\" S (with 15 independent components) and a \"non-Cauchy\npiece\" A (with 6 independent components). Subsequently, we turn to the\nphysically relevant orthogonal group, thereby using the metric. We find the\nfiner decomposition of S into pieces with 9+5+1 and of A into those with 5+1\nindependent components. Some reducible decompositions, discussed earlier by\nnumerous authors, are shown to be inconsistent. --- Several physical\nconsequences are discussed. The Cauchy relations are shown to correspond to\nA=0. Longitudinal and transverse sound waves are basically related by S and A,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present a novel method for resummation of event shapes to\nnext-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy. We discuss the technique\nand describe its implementation in a numerical program in the case of e^+e^-\ncollisions where the resummed prediction is matched to NNLO. We reproduce all\nthe existing predictions and present new results for oblateness and thrust\nmajor.\n", "  Objective: To figure out the underlying physics of QFTs by following the\nFeynman heuristics lore: I think equation guessing might be the best method to\nproceed to obtain the laws for the part of physics which is presently unknown.\nApplication: Collider Physics: Usage of the present high energy facilities for\ngathering quantitative information about the underlying physics of QFTs by the\nexperimental values of regularization parameters We propose no new kinds of\nexperiments, only the in-depth evaluation of the high precision, collider\ndata!. Keywords: Collider Physics; Underlying physics of QFTs: short-distance\nphenomena, extra dimensions, faster than light effects, hierarchy problem;\nUniverse: Boltzmann field equations, Unparticles.\n", "  We derive an equality for non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in\nfinite-dimensional quantum systems. The equality concerns the worst-case work\noutput of a time-dependent Hamiltonian protocol in the presence of a Markovian\nheat bath. It has has the form \"worst-case work = penalty - optimum\". The\nequality holds for all rates of changing the Hamiltonian and can be used to\nderive the optimum by setting the penalty to 0. The optimum term contains the\nmax entropy of the initial state, rather than the von Neumann entropy, thus\nrecovering recent results from single-shot statistical mechanics. Energy\ncoherences can arise during the protocol but are assumed not to be present\ninitially. We apply the equality to an electron box.\n", "  Interaction of very low-frequency primordial(relic) gravitational waves(GWs)\nto cosmic microwave background(CMB) can generate B-mode polarization. Here, for\nthe first time we point out that the electromagnetic(EM) response to\nhigh-frequency GWs(HFGWs) would produce quasi-B-mode distribution of the\nperturbative photon fluxes, and study the duality and high complementarity\nbetween such two B-modes. Based on this quasi-B-mode in HFGWs, it is shown that\nthe distinguishing and observing of HFGWs from the braneworld would be quite\npossible due to their large amplitude, higher frequency and very different\nphysical behaviors between the perturbative photon fluxes and background\nphotons, and the measurement of relic HFGWs may also be possible though face to\nenormous challenge.\n", "  The formation of agents' opinions in a social system is the result of an\nintricate equilibrium among several driving forces. On the one hand, the social\npressure exerted by peers favours the emergence of local consensus. On the\nother hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different\ntopics induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the\ntopics in which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external\nstimuli, such as mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific\nconfiguration of opinions on different topics. Here we propose a model in which\nagents with interrelated opinions, interacting on several layers representing\ndifferent topics, tend to spread their own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive\nto maintain internal coherence, due to the fact that each agent identifies\nmeaningful relationships among its opinions on the different topics, and are at\nthe same time subject to external fields, resembling the pressure of mass\nmedia. We show that the presence of heterogeneity in the internal coupling\nassigned by agents to their different opinions allows to obtain states with\nmixed levels of consensus, still ensuring that all the agents attain a coherent\nset of opinions. Furthermore, we show that all the observed features of the\nmodel are preserved in the presence of thermal noise up to a critical\ntemperature, after which global consensus is no longer attainable. This\nsuggests the relevance of our results for real social systems, where noise is\ninevitably present in the form of information uncertainty and\nmisunderstandings. The model also demonstrates how mass media can be\neffectively used to favour the propagation of a chosen set of opinions, thus\npolarising the consensus of an entire population.\n", "  We adapt modulus of continuity estimates to the study of spectra of\ncombinatorial graph Laplacians, as well as the Dirichlet spectra of certain\nweighted Laplacians. The latter case is equivalent to stoquastic Hamiltonians\nand is of current interest in both condensed matter physics and quantum\ncomputing. In particular, we introduce a new technique which bounds the\nspectral gap of such Laplacians (Hamiltonians) by studying the limiting\nbehavior of the oscillations of their eigenvectors when introduced into the\nheat equation. Our approach is based on recent advances in the PDE literature,\nwhich include a proof of the fundamental gap theorem by Andrews and\nClutterbuck.\n", "  Symmetry breaking across phase transitions often causes changes in selection\nrules and emergence of optical modes which can be detected via spectroscopic\ntechniques or generated coherently in pump-probe experiments. In second-order\nor weakly first-order transitions, fluctuations of the order parameter are\npresent above the ordering temperature, giving rise to intriguing precursor\nphenomena, such as critical opalescence. Here, we demonstrate that in magnetite\n(Fe$_3$O$_4$) light excitation couples to the critical fluctuations of the\ncharge order and coherently generates structural modes of the ordered phase\nabove the critical temperature of the Verwey transition. Our findings are\nobtained by detecting coherent oscillations of the optical constants through\nultrafast broadband spectroscopy and analyzing their dependence on temperature.\nTo unveil the coupling between the structural modes and the electronic\nexcitations, at the origin of the Verwey transition, we combine our results\nfrom pump-probe experiments with spontaneous Raman scattering data and\ntheoretical calculations of both the phonon dispersion curves and the optical\nconstants. Our methodology represents an effective tool to study the real-time\ndynamics of critical fluctuations across phase transitions.\n", "  The results of new experimental measurements of p16O elastic scattering in\nthe energy range of 0.6-1.0 MeV at angles of 40-160 deg. are given. Phase shift\nanalysis of p16O elastic scattering was made using these and other experimental\ndata on differential cross sections in excitation functions and angular\ndistributions at energies of up to 2.5 MeV.\n", "  We study the quadratic invariants of the elasticity tensor in the framework\nof its unique irreducible decomposition. The key point is that this\ndecomposition generates the direct sum reduction of the elasticity tensor\nspace. The corresponding subspaces are completely independent and even\northogonal relative to the Euclidean (Frobenius) scalar product. We construct a\nbasis set of seven quadratic invariants that emerge in a natural and systematic\nway. Moreover, the completeness of this basis and the independence of the basis\ntensors follow immediately from the direct sum representation of the elasticity\ntensor space. We define the Cauchy factor of an anisotropic material as a\ndimensionless measure of a closeness to a pure Cauchy material and a similar\nisotropic factor is as a measure for a closeness of an anisotropic material to\nits isotropic prototype. For cubic crystals, these factors are explicitly\ndisplayed and cubic crystal average of an arbitrary elastic material is\nderived.\n", "  Quantum coherence is a basic feature of quantum physics. Combined with tensor\nproduct structure of state space, it gives rise to the novel concepts such as\nentanglement and quantum correlations, which play a crucial role in quantum\ninformation processing tasks. However, quantum correlations, especially\nentanglement, are fragile under decoherence. In this context, very few\ninvestigations have touched on the production of quantum coherence by quantum\noperations. In this paper, we study cohering power -- the ability of quantum\noperations to produce coherence. First, we provide an operational\ninterpretation of cohering power. Then, we decompose a generic quantum\noperation into three basic operations, namely, unitary, appending and dismissal\noperations, and show that the cohering power of any quantum operation is upper\nbounded by the corresponding unitary operation. Furthermore, we compare\ncohering power and generalized cohering power of quantum operations for\ndifferent measures of coherence.\n", "  Electrodynamics with a local and linear constitutive law is used as a\nframework for models violating Lorentz covariance. The constitutive tensor of\nsuch a construction is irreducibly decomposed into three independent pieces.\nThe principal part is the anisotropic generalisation of the standard\nelectrodynamics. The two other parts, axion and skewon, represent non-classical\nmodifications of electrodynamics. We derive the expression for the photon\npropagator in the Minkowski spacetime endowed with a skewon field. For a\nrelatively small (antisymmetric) skewon field, a modified Coulom law is\nexhibited.\n", "  The factorization technique for superintegrable Hamiltonian systems is\nrevisited and applied in order to obtain additional (higher-order) constants of\nthe motion. In particular, the factorization approach to the classical\nanisotropic oscillator on the Euclidean plane is reviewed, and new classical\n(super)integrable anisotropic oscillators on the sphere are constructed. The\nTremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz system on the Euclidean plane is also studied from\nthis viewpoint.\n", "  In this short review I present my personal reflections on Zeilinger-Brukner\ninformation interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM). In general, this\ninterpretation is very attractive for me. However, its rigid coupling to the\nnotion of irreducible quantum randomness is a very complicated issue which I\nplan to address in more detail. This note may be useful for general public\ninterested in quantum foundations, especially because I try to analyze\nessentials of the information interpretation critically (i.e., not just\nemphasizing its advantages as it is commonly done). This review is written in\nnon-physicist friendly manner. Experts actively exploring this interpretation\nmay be interested in the paper as well, as in the comments of \"an external\nobserver\" who have been monitoring the development of this approach to QM\nduring the last 18 years. The last part of this review is devoted to the\ngeneral methodology of science with references to views of de Finetti, Wigner,\nand Peres.\n", "  Recently, it is realized that non-perturbative instanton effects can be\ngenerated to all orders by perturbation theory around a degenerate minima via\nDunne-Unsal relation in several quantum mechanical systems. In this work we\nverify the Dunne-Unsal relation for resonance energy levels of one-dimensional\npolynomial anharmonic oscillators. We show that the relation is applicable to\ncubic and quartic anharmonic oscillators which are genus one potentials.\nHowever for higher order (higher genus) anharmonic potentials the relation is\nnot satisfied and is subject to a certain extension.\n", "  We study the problem of predictability, or \"nature vs. nurture\", in several\ndisordered Ising spin systems evolving at zero temperature from a random\ninitial state: how much does the final state depend on the information\ncontained in the initial state, and how much depends on the detailed history of\nthe system? Our numerical studies of the \"dynamical order parameter\" in\nEdwards-Anderson Ising spin glasses and random ferromagnets indicate that the\ninfluence of the initial state decays as dimension increases. Similarly, this\nsame order parameter for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick infinite-range spin glass\nindicates that this information decays as the number of spins increases. Based\non these results, we conjecture that the influence of the initial state on the\nfinal state decays to zero in finite-dimensional random-bond spin systems as\ndimension goes to infinity, regardless of the presence of frustration. We also\nstudy the rate at which spins \"freeze out\" to a final state as a function of\ndimensionality and number of spins; here the results indicate that the number\nof \"active\" spins at long times increases with dimension (for short-range\nsystems) or number of spins (for infinite-range systems). We provide\ntheoretical arguments to support these conjectures, and also study analytically\nseveral mean-field models: the random energy model, the uniform Curie-Weiss\nferromagnet, and the disordered Curie-Weiss ferromagnet. We find that for these\nmodels, the information contained in the initial state does not decay in the\nthermodynamic limit-- in fact, it fully determines the final state. Unlike in\nshort-range models, the presence of frustration in mean-field models\ndramatically alters the dynamical behavior with respect to the issue of\npredictability.\n", "  We perform a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the forced, incompressible\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation coupled with the FENE-P equations for\nthe polymer-conformation tensor. The forcing is such that, without polymers and\nat low Reynolds numbers $\\mbox{Re}$, the film attains a steady state that is a\nsquare lattice of vortices and anti-vortices. We find that, as we increase the\nWeissenberg number $\\mbox{Wi}$, a sequence of nonequilibrium phase transitions\ntransforms this lattice, first to spatially distorted, but temporally steady,\ncrystals and then to a sequence of crystals that oscillate in time,\nperiodically, at low $\\mbox{Wi}$, and quasiperiodically, for slightly larger\n$\\mbox{Wi}$. Finally, the system becomes disordered and displays spatiotemporal\nchaos and elastic turbulence. We then obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram\nfor this system, in the $\\mbox{Wi} - \\Omega$ plane, where $\\Omega \\propto\n{\\mbox{Re}}$, and show that (a) the boundary between the crystalline and\nturbulent phases has a complicated, fractal-type character and (b) the\nOkubo-Weiss parameter $\\Lambda$ provides us with a natural measure for\ncharacterizing the phases and transitions in this diagram.\n", "  Given the recent direct measurement of gravitational waves (GWs) by the\nLIGO-VIRGO collab- oration, the coupling between electromagnetic fields and\ngravity have a special relevance since it opens new perspectives for future GW\ndetectors and also potentially provides information on the physics of highly\nenergetic GW sources. We explore such couplings using the field equations of\nelectrodynamics on (pseudo) Riemann manifolds and apply it to the background of\na GW, seen as a linear perturbation of Minkowski geometry. Electric and\nmagnetic oscillations are induced that propagate as electromagnetic waves and\ncontain information about the GW which generates them. The most relevant\nresults are the presence of longitudinal modes and dynamical polarization\npatterns of electromagnetic radiation induced by GWs. These effects might be\namplified using appropriate resonators, effectively improving the signal to\nnoise ratio around a specific frequency. We also briefly address the generation\nof charge density fluctuations induced by GWs and the implications for\nastrophysics.\n", "  The structural, elastic, and electronic properties of newly synthesized\nZr2(Al0.58Bi0.42)C, Zr2(Al0.2Sn0.8)C, and Zr2(Al0.3Sb0.7)C MAX nanolaminates\nhave been studied using first-principles density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations for the first time. Theoretical Vickers hardness has also been\nestimated for these compounds. All the calculated results are compared with\nexperimental data and also with that of recently discovered Zr2AlC phase, where\navailable. Zr2(Al0.58Bi0.42)C and Zr2(Al0.2Sn0.8)C are the two first Bi and Sn\ncontaining MAX compounds. The calculated structural parameters are found to be\nin good agreement with the experimental data. The single crystal elastic\nconstants Cij and other polycrystalline elastic coefficients have been\ncalculated and the mechanical stabilities of these compounds have been\ntheoretically confirmed. The bulk modulus increases and the shear modulus\ndecreases due to partial Bi/Sn/Sb substitution for Al in Zr2AlC. The calculated\nelastic moduli show that these Bi/Sn/Sb containing MAX phases are more\nanisotropic than Zr2AlC, and have a tendency towards ductility. The Vickers\nhardness decreases in the Bi/Sn/Sb containing compounds. Further, the\nelectronic band structures and electronic density of states (EDOS) are\ncalculated and the effects of different elemental substitution on these\nproperties are investigated. The electronic band structures show metallic\ncharacteristics with contribution predominantly coming from the Zr 4d orbitals.\nPartial presence of Bi/Sn/Sb atoms increases the EDOS at the Fermi level to\nsome extent. Possible implications of the theoretical results for these\nrecently discovered MAX nanolaminates have been discussed in detail in this\npaper.\n", "  In order to understand the performance of the PARIS (Photon Array for the\nstudies with Radioactive Ion and Stable beams) detector, detailed\ncharacterization of two individual phoswich (LaBr$_3$(Ce)-NaI(Tl)) elements has\nbeen carried out. The detector response is investigated over a wide range of\n$E_{\\gamma}$ = 0.6 to 22.6 MeV using radioactive sources and employing\n$^{11}B(p,\\gamma)$ reaction at $E_p$ = 163 keV and $E_p$ = 7.2 MeV. The\nlinearity of energy response of the LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector is tested upto 22.6\nMeV using three different voltage dividers. The data acquisition system using\nCAEN digitizers is set up and optimized to get the best energy and time\nresolution. The energy resolution of $\\sim$ 2.1% at $E_\\gamma$ = 22.6~MeV is\nmeasured for the configuration giving best linearity upto high energy. Time\nresolution of the phoswich detector is measured with a $^{60}$Co source after\nimplementing CFD algorithm for the digitized pulses and is found to be\nexcellent (FWHM $\\sim$ 315~ps). In order to study the effect of count rate on\ndetectors, the centroid position and width of the $E_{\\gamma}$ = 835~keV peak\nwere measured upto 220 kHz count rate. The measured efficiency data with\nradioactive sources are in good agreement with GEANT4 based simulations. The\ntotal energy spectrum after the add-back of energy signals in phoswich\ncomponents is also presented.\n", "  Recently, Zhu classified all the SIC-POVMs whose symmetry groups act doubly\ntransitively. Lattices of integers in the complex numbers, the quaternions and\nthe octonions yield the key parts of these symmetry groups.\n", "  A free choice of the integration sense would lead to the paradox that the\nnumber of possible equations (thus of solutions for a given model) can vary\nunder a mere change of the variables. This is shown by a specific change which\nneutralizes the sense (by establishing a constant coupling with the noise). Its\ninverse singles out the Stratonovich sense, by means of the Ito formula.\n", "  The chiral magnetic effect is a phenomenon where an electromagnetic current\nis generated along a magnetic field. Recently, in nonequilibrium systems,\nnegative longitudinal magnetoresistance has been observed experimentally in\nDirac/Weyl semimetals, which provides evidence for the chiral magnetic effect\nas a nonequilibrium current. On the other hand, the emergence of the chiral\nmagnetic effect as an equilibrium current is still controversial. We propose a\npossible realization of the chiral magnetic effect as an equilibrium current\nusing inhomogeneous magnetic fields. By employing tight-binding calculations\nand linear response theory, we demonstrate that a finite current density is\ngenerated by inhomogeneous magnetic fields, while the spatial integration of\nthe current is equal to zero, which is consistent with the so-called \"no-go\ntheorem\" of the chiral magnetic effect in real lattice systems. Moreover, we\npropose an experimental setup to detect the effect in Weyl semimetal materials.\n", "  In this work we aim to analyze the role of noise in the spatial Public Goods\nGame, one of the most famous games in Evolutionary Game Theory. The dynamics of\nthis game is affected by a number of parameters and processes, namely the\ntopology of interactions among the agents, the synergy factor, and the strategy\nrevision phase. The latter is a process that allows agents to change their\nstrategy. Notably, rational agents tend to imitate richer neighbors, in order\nto increase the probability to maximize their payoff. By implementing a\nstochastic revision process, it is possible to control the level of noise in\nthe system, so that even irrational updates may occur. In particular, in this\nwork we study the effect of noise on the macroscopic behavior of a finite\nstructured population playing the Public Goods Game. We consider both the case\nof a homogeneous population, where the noise in the system is controlled by\ntuning a parameter representing the level of stochasticity in the strategy\nrevision phase, and a heterogeneous population composed of a variable\nproportion of rational and irrational agents. In both cases numerical\ninvestigations show that the Public Goods Game has a very rich behavior which\nstrongly depends on the amount of noise in the system and on the value of the\nsynergy factor. To conclude, our study sheds a new light on the relations\nbetween the microscopic dynamics of the Public Goods Game and its macroscopic\nbehavior, strengthening the link between the field of Evolutionary Game Theory\nand statistical physics.\n", "  In natural and social science, many events happened at different space-times\nmay be closely correlated. Two events, $A$ (Alice) and $B$ (Bob) are defined\ncorrelated if one event is determined by another, say, $B=\\hat{f}A$ for\nsuitable $\\hat{f}$ operators. Taking KdV and coupled KdV systems as examples,\nwe can find some types of models (AB-KdV systems) to exhibit the existence on\nthe correlated solutions linked with two events. The idea of this report is\nvalid not only for physical problems related to KdV systems but also for\nproblems described by arbitrary continuous or discrete models. The parity and\ntime reversal symmetries are extended to shifted parity and delayed time\nreversal. The new symmetries are found to be useful not only to establish\nAB-systems but also to find group invariant solutions of numerous AB-systems. A\nnew elegant form of the $N$-soliton solutions of the KdV equation and then the\nAB-KdV systems is obtained. A concrete AB-KdV system derived from the nonlinear\ninviscid dissipative and barotropic vorticity equation in a $\\beta$-plane\nchannel is applied to the two correlated monople blocking events which is\nresponsible for the snow disaster in the winter of 2007/2008 happened in\nSouthern China.\n", "  Why is our society multicultural? Based on the two mechanisms of homophily\nand social influence, the classical model for the dissemination of cultures\nproposed by Axelrod predicts the existence of a fragmented regime where\ndifferent cultures can coexist in a social network. However, in such model the\nmulticultural regime is achievable only when a high number of cultural traits\nis present, and is not robust against cultural drift, i.e. the spontaneous\nmutations of agents' traits. In real systems, social influence is inherently\norganised in layers, meaning that individuals tend to diversify their\nconnections according to the topic on which they interact. In this work we show\nthat the observed persistence of multiculturality in real-world social systems\nis a natural consequence of the layered organisation of social influence. We\nfind that the critical number of cultural traits that separates the\nmonocultural and the multicultural regimes depends on the redundancy of\npairwise connections across layers. Surprisingly, for low values of structural\nredundancy the system is always in a multicultural state, independently on the\nnumber of traits, and is robust to the presence of cultural drift. Moreover, we\nshow that layered social influence allows the coexistence of different levels\nof consensus on different topics. The insight obtained from simulations on\nsynthetic graphs are confirmed by the analysis of two real-world social\nnetworks, where the multicultural regime persists even for a very small number\nof cultural traits, suggesting that the layered organisation of social\ninteractions might indeed be at the heart of multicultural societies.\n", "  In the last decade, network science has shed new light both on the structural\n(anatomical) and on the functional (correlations in the activity) connectivity\namong the different areas of the human brain. The analysis of brain networks\nhas made possible to detect the central areas of a neural system, and to\nidentify its building blocks by looking at overabundant small subgraphs, known\nas motifs. However, network analysis of the brain has so far mainly focused on\nanatomical and functional networks as separate entities. The recently developed\nmathematical framework of multi-layer networks allows to perform an analysis of\nthe human brain where the structural and functional layers are considered\ntogether. In this work we describe how to classify the subgraphs of a multiplex\nnetwork, and we extend motif analysis to networks with an arbitrary number of\nlayers. We then extract multi-layer motifs in brain networks of healthy\nsubjects by considering networks with two layers, anatomical and functional,\nrespectively obtained from diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging.\nResults indicate that subgraphs in which the presence of a physical connection\nbetween brain areas (links at the structural layer) coexists with a non-trivial\npositive correlation in their activities are statistically overabundant.\nFinally, we investigate the existence of a reinforcement mechanism between the\ntwo layers by looking at how the probability to find a link in one layer\ndepends on the intensity of the connection in the other one. Showing that\nfunctional connectivity is non-trivially constrained by the underlying\nanatomical network, our work contributes to a better understanding of the\ninterplay between structure and function in the human brain.\n", "  Interaction effects have been a subject of contemporary interest in\ntopological phases of matter. But in the presence of interactions, the accurate\ndetermination of topological invariants in their general form is difficult due\nto their dependence on multiple integrals containing Green's functions and\ntheir derivatives. Here we employ the recently proposed \"effective topological\nHamiltonian\" approach to explore interaction-induced topological phases in the\ntime-reversal-invariant Hofstadter-Hubbard model. Within this approach, the\nzero-frequency part of the self-energy is sufficient to determine the correct\ntopological invariant. We combine the topological Hamiltonian approach with the\nlocal self-energy approximation, both for the static and the full dynamical\nself-energy evaluated using dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), and present the\nresulting phase diagram in the presence of many-body interactions. We\ninvestigate the emergence of quantum spin Hall (QSH) states for different\ninteraction strengths by calculating the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant. The\ninterplay of strong correlations and a staggered potential also induces\nmagnetic long-range order with an associated first order transition. We present\nresults for the staggered magnetization ( $m_s$ ), staggered occupancy ( $n_s$\n), and double occupancy across the transition.\n", "  What do societies, the Internet, and the human brain have in common? They are\nall examples of complex relational systems, whose emerging behaviours are\nlargely determined by the non-trivial networks of interactions among their\nconstituents, namely individuals, computers, or neurons, rather than the\nproperties of the units themselves. In the last two decades, network scientists\nhave proposed models of increasing complexity to better understand real-world\nsystems. Only recently we have realised that multiplexity, i.e. the coexistence\nof several types of interactions among the constituents of a complex system, is\nresponsible for substantial qualitative and quantitative differences in the\ntype and variety of behaviours that a complex system can exhibit. As a\nconsequence, multilayer and multiplex networks have become a hot topic in\ncomplexity science. Here we provide an overview of some of the measures\nproposed so far to characterise the structure of multiplex networks, and a\nselection of models aiming at reproducing those structural properties and\nquantifying their statistical significance. Focusing on a subset of relevant\ntopics, this brief review is a quite comprehensive introduction to the most\nbasic tools for the analysis of multiplex networks observed in the real-world.\nThe wide applicability of multiplex networks as a framework to model complex\nsystems in different fields, from biology to social sciences, and the\ncolloquial tone of the paper will make it an interesting read for researchers\nworking on both theoretical and experimental analysis of networked systems.\n", "  Low-energy single-electron dynamics in graphene monolayers and similar\nnanostructures is described by the Dirac model, being a 2+1 dimensional version\nof massless QED with the speed of light replaced by the Fermi velocity\nv_{F}=c/300. Methods of strong-field QFT are relevant for the Dirac model,\nsince any low-frequency electric field requires a nonperturbative treatment of\nmassless carriers in case it remains unchanged for a sufficiently long time\ninterval. In this case, the effects of creation and annihilation of\nelectron-hole pairs produced from vacuum by a slowly varying and small-gradient\nelectric field are relevant, thereby substantially affecting the radiation\npattern. For this reason, the standard QED text-book theory of photon emission\ncannot be of help. We construct the Fock-space representation of the Dirac\nmodel, which takes exact accounts of the effects of vacuum instability caused\nby external electric fields, and in which the interaction between electrons and\nphotons is taken into account perturbatively, following the general theory (the\ngeneralized Furry representation). We consider the effective theory of photon\nemission in the first-order approximation and construct the corresponding total\nprobabilities, taking into account the unitarity relation.\n", "  Inflation has by-far set itself as one of the prime ideas in the current\ncosmological models that seemingly has an answer for every observed phenomenon\nin cosmology. More importantly, it serves as a bridge between the early quantum\nfluctuations and the present-day classical structures. Although the transition\nfrom quantum to classical is still not completely understood till date, there\nare two assumptions made in the inflationary paradigm in this regard:\n  (i) the modes (metric perturbations or fluctuations) behave classically once\nthey are well outside the Hubble radius and,\n  (ii) once they become classical they stay classical and hence can be\ndescribed by standard perturbation theory after they re-enter the Hubble\nradius.\n  We critically examine these assumptions for the tensor modes of (linear)\nmetric perturbations in a toy three stage universe with (i) inflation, (ii)\nradiation-dominated and (iii) late-time accelerated phases. The\nquantum-to-classical transition for these modes is evident from the evolution\nof Wigner function in phase space and its peaking on the classical trajectory.\nHowever, a better approach to quantify the degree of classicality and study its\nevolution was given by Mahajan and Padmanabhan [1] using a classicality\nparameter constructed from the parameters of the Wigner function. We study the\nevolution of the classicality parameter across the three phases and it turns\nout that the first assumption holds true, there is emergence of classicality on\nHubble exit, however the latter assumption of \"once classical, always\nclassical\" seems to lie on a shaky ground.\n", "  We present the first next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation for the\ntwo-jet rate in $e^+e^-$ annihilation in the Durham and Cambridge algorithms.\nThe results are obtained by extending the ARES method to observables involving\nany global, recursively infrared and collinear safe jet algorithm in e^+e^-\ncollisions. As opposed to other methods, this approach does not require a\nfactorization theorem for the observables. We present predictions matched to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order, and a comparison to LEP data.\n", "  We describe two procedures which, given access to one copy of a quantum state\nand a sequence of two-outcome measurements, can distinguish between the case\nthat at least one of the measurements accepts the state with high probability,\nand the case that all of the measurements have low probability of acceptance.\nThe measurements cannot simply be tried in sequence, because early measurements\nmay disturb the state being tested. One procedure is based on a variant of\nMarriott-Watrous amplification. The other procedure is based on the use of a\ntest for this disturbance, which is applied with low probability. We find a\nnumber of applications. First, quantum query complexity separations in the\nproperty testing model for testing isomorphism of functions under group\nactions. We give quantum algorithms for testing isomorphism, linear isomorphism\nand affine isomorphism of boolean functions which use exponentially fewer\nqueries than is possible classically, and a quantum algorithm for testing graph\nisomorphism which uses polynomially fewer queries than the best algorithm\nknown. Second, testing properties of quantum states and operations. We show\nthat any finite property of quantum states can be tested using a number of\ncopies of the state which is logarithmic in the size of the property, and give\na test for genuine multipartite entanglement of states of n qubits that uses\nO(n) copies of the state. Third, correcting an error in a result of Aaronson on\nde-Merlinizing quantum protocols. This result claimed that, in any one-way\nquantum communication protocol where two parties are assisted by an\nall-powerful but untrusted third party, the third party can be removed with\nonly a modest increase in the communication cost. We give a corrected proof of\na key technical lemma required for Aaronson's result.\n", "  Ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) have been a significant source of study at\nRHIC and the LHC. In these collisions, the two colliding nuclei interact\nelectromagnetically, via two-photon or photonuclear interactions, but not\nhadronically; they effectively miss each other. Photonuclear interactions\nproduce vector meson states or more general photonuclear final states, while\ntwo-photon interactions can produce lepton or meson pairs, or single mesons. In\nthese interactions, the collision geometry plays a major role. We present a\nprogram, STARlight, that calculates the cross-sections for a variety of UPC\nfinal states and also creates, via Monte Carlo simulation, events for use in\ndetermining detector efficiency.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the ionization and thermal structure of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM) around a high-redshift QSO using a large suite of\ncosmological, multi-frequency radiative transfer (RT) simulations, exploring\nthe contribution from galaxies as well as the QSO, and the effect of X-rays and\nsecondary ionization. We show that in high-z QSO environments both the central\nQSO and the surrounding galaxies concertedly control the reionization\nmorphology of hydrogen and helium and have a non-linear impact on the thermal\nstructure of the IGM. A QSO imprints a distinctive morphology on H II regions\nif its total ionizing photon budget exceeds that of the surrounding galaxies\nsince the onset of hydrogen reionization; otherwise, the morphology shows\nlittle difference from that of H II regions produced only by galaxies. In\naddition, the spectral shape of the collective radiation field from galaxies\nand QSOs controls the thickness of the I-fronts. While a UV-obscured QSO can\nbroaden the I-front, the contribution from other UV sources, either galaxies or\nunobscured QSO, is sufficient to maintain a sharp I-front. X-rays photons from\nthe QSO are responsible for a prominent extended tail of partial ionization\nahead of the I-front. QSOs leave a unique imprint on the morphology of He II /\nHe III regions. We suggest that, while the physical state of the IGM is\nmodified by QSOs, the most direct test to understand the role of galaxies and\nQSOs during reionization is to perform galaxy surveys in a region of sky imaged\nby 21 cm tomography.\n", "  Mark Kac introduced what is now called 'the Kac Walk' with the aim of\ninvestigating the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation by probabilistic\nmeans. Much recent work, discussed below, on Kac's program has run in the other\ndirection: using recent results on the Boltzmann equation, or its\none-dimensional analog, the non-linear Kac-Boltzmann equation, to prove results\nfor the Kac Walk. Here we investigate new functional inequalities for the Kac\nWalk pertaining to entropy production, and introduce a new form of\n`chaoticity'. We then show how these entropy production inequalities imply\nentropy production inequalities for the Kac-Boltzmann equation. This results\nvalidate Kac's program for proving results on the non-linear Boltzmann equation\nvia analysis of the Kac Walk, and they constitute a partial solution to the\n`Almost' Cercignani Conjecture on the sphere.\n", "  We use observations related to the variation of fundamental constants, in\norder to impose constraints on the viable and most used $f(T)$ gravity models.\nIn particular, for the fine-structure constant we use direct measurements\nobtained by different spectrographic methods, while for the effective Newton's\nconstant we use a model-dependent reconstruction, using direct observational\nHubble parameter data, in order to investigate its temporal evolution. We\nconsider two $f(T)$ models and we quantify their deviation from $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology through a sole parameter. Our analysis reveals that this parameter\ncan be slightly different from its $\\Lambda$CDM value, however the best-fit\nvalue is very close to the $\\Lambda$CDM one. Hence, $f(T)$ gravity is\nconsistent with observations, nevertheless, as every modified gravity, it may\nexhibit only small deviations from $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, a feature that must\nbe taken into account in any $f(T)$ model-building.\n", "  We extend a result on renormalized oscillation theory, originally derived for\nSturm-Liouville and Dirac-type operators on arbitrary intervals in the context\nof scalar coefficients, to the case of general Hamiltonian systems with block\nmatrix coefficients. In particular, this contains the cases of general\nSturm-Liouville and Dirac-type operators with block matrix-valued coefficients\nas special cases.\n  The principal feature of these renormalized oscillation theory results\nconsists in the fact that by replacing solutions by appropriate Wronskians of\nsolutions, oscillation theory now applies to intervals in essential spectral\ngaps where traditional oscillation theory typically fails.\n", "  We investigate how an equation of state for matter is affected when a gravity\nis present. For this purpose, we consider a box of ideal gas in the presence of\nNewtonian gravity. In addition to the ordinary thermodynamic quantities, a\ncharacteristic variable that represents a weight per unit area relative to the\naverage pressure is required in order to describe a macroscopic state of the\ngas. Although the density and the pressure are not uniform due to the presence\nof gravity, the ideal gas law itself is satisfied for the thermodynamic\nquantities when averaged over the system. Assuming that the system follows an\nadiabatic process further, we obtain a {\\it new} relation between the averaged\npressure and density, which differs from the conventional equation of state for\nthe ideal gas in the absence of gravity. Applying our results to a small volume\nin a Newtonian star, however, we find that the conventional one is reliable for\nmost astrophysical situations when the characteristic scale is small. On the\nother hand, gravity effects become significant near the surface of a Newtonian\nstar.\n", "  We present a collision model for phase-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations\nof sediment transport that couple the fluid and particles by the Immersed\nBoundary Method. Typically, a contact model for these types of simulations\ncomprises a lubrication force for particles in close proximity to another solid\nobject, a normal contact force to prevent particles from overlapping, and a\ntangential contact force to account for friction. Our model extends the work of\nprevious authors to improve upon the time integration scheme to obtain\nconsistent results for particle-wall collisions. Furthermore, we account for\npolydisperse spherical particles and introduce new criteria to account for\nenduring contact, which occurs in many sediment transport situations. This is\ndone without using arbitrary values for physically-defined parameters and by\nmaintaining the full momentum balance of a particle in enduring contact. We\nvalidate our model against several test cases for binary particle-wall\ncollisions as well as the collective motion of a sediment bed sheared by a\nviscous flow, yielding satisfactory agreement with experimental data by various\nauthors.\n", "  We discuss gauge coupling unification of the SM descending directly from\nSO(10) while providing solutions to the three outstanding problems: neutrino\nmasses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the universe. Conservation of\nmatter parity as gauged discrete symmetry in the model calls for high-scale\nspontaneous symmetry breaking through ${126}_H$ Higgs representation. This\nnaturally leads to the hybrid seesaw formula for neutrino masses mediated by\nheavy scalar triplet and right-handed neutrinos. The seesaw formula predicts\ntwo distinct patterns of RH$\\nu$ masses, one hierarchical and another not so\nhierarchical (or compact) when fitted with the neutrino oscillation data.\nPredictions of the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis are investigated through\nthe decays of both the patterns of RH$\\nu$ masses. A complete flavor analysis\nhas been carried out to compute CP-asymmetries and solutions to Boltzmann\nequations have been utilized to predict the baryon asymmetry. The additional\ncontribution to vertex correction mediated by the heavy left-handed triplet\nscalar is noted to contribute as dominantly as other Feynman diagrams. We have\nfound successful predictions of the baryon asymmetry for both the patterns of\nRH$\\nu$ masses. The triplet fermionic dark matter at the TeV scale carrying\neven matter parity is naturally embedded into the non-standard fermionic\nrepresentation ${45}_F$ of SO(10). In addition to the triplet scalar and the\ntriplet fermion, the model needs a nonstandard color octet fermion of mass\n$\\sim 10^7$ GeV to achieve precision gauge coupling unification. Threshold\ncorrections due to superheavy components of ${126}_H$ and other representations\nare estimated and found to be substantial. It is noted that the proton life\ntime predicted by the model is accessible to the ongoing and planned\nexperiments over a wide range of parameter space.\n", "  In this work we explicitly show resurgence relations between perturbative and\none instanton sectors of the resonance energy levels for cubic and quartic\nanharmonic potentials in one-dimensional quantum mechanics. Both systems\nsatisfy the Dunne-Unsal relation and hence we are able to derive one-instanton\nnon-perturbative contributions with the fluctuation terms to the energy merely\nfrom the perturbative data. We confirm our results with previous results\nobtained by Zinn-Justin et al.\n", "  The authors state that results recently published by Carlsson and Toivanen\n\"seem to contradict\" the conclusions of some of our work. We show that this\nstatement is based on a misinterpretation of the results of Carlsson and\nToivanen.\n", "  We continue the investigation of kinetic models of a system in contact via\nstochastic interactions with several spatially homogeneous thermal reservoirs\nat different temperatures. Considering models different from those investigated\nin earlier work, we explicitly compute the unique spatially uniform\nnon-equilibrium steady state (NESS) and prove that it is approached\nexponentially fast from any uniform initial state. This leaves open the\nquestion of whether there exist NESS that are not spatially uniform. Making a\nfurther simplification of our models, we then prove non-existence of such NESS\nand exponential approach to the unique spatially uniform NESS (with a\ncomputably boundable rate). The method of proof relies on refined Doeblin\nestimates and other probabilisitic techniques, and is quite different form the\nanalysis in earlier work that was based on contraction mapping methods.\n", "  We searched for the $CP$-violating rare decay of neutral kaon, $K_{L} \\to\n\\pi^0 \\nu \\overline{\\nu}$, in data from the first 100 hours of physics running\nin 2013 of the J-PARC KOTO experiment. One candidate event was observed while\n$0.34\\pm0.16$ background events were expected. We set an upper limit of\n$5.1\\times10^{-8}$ for the branching fraction at the 90\\% confidence level\n(C.L.). An upper limit of $3.7\\times10^{-8}$ at the 90\\% C.L. for the $K_{L}\n\\to \\pi^{0} X^{0}$decay was also set for the first time, where $X^{0}$ is an\ninvisible particle with a mass of 135 MeV/$c^{2}$.\n", "  The potential of the $B$ meson and the pseudoscalar meson is constructed up\nto the next-to-leading order Lagrangian, and then the $B \\bar{K}$ and $B_s \\pi$\ninteraction is studied in the unitary coupled-channel approximation, and a\nresonant state with a mass about $5568MeV$ and $J^P=0^+$ is generated\ndynamically, which can be associated with the $X(5568)$ state announced by D0\nCollaboration recently. The mass and the decay width of this resonant state\ndepend on the regularization scale in the dimensional regularization scheme, or\nthe maximum momentum in the momentum cutoff regularization scheme. The\nscattering amplitude of the vector $B$ meson and the pseudoscalar meson is\ncalculated, and an axial-vector state with a mass near $5620MeV$ and $J^P=1^+$\nis produced. Moreover, their partners in the charm sector are also discussed.\n", "  Numerical inversion is a general detector calibration technique that is\nindependent of the underlying spectrum. This procedure is formalized and\nimportant statistical properties are presented, using high energy jets at the\nLarge Hadron Collider as an example setting. In particular, numerical inversion\nis inherently biased and common approximations to the calibrated jet energy\ntend to over-estimate the resolution. Analytic approximations to the closure\nand calibrated resolutions are demonstrated to effectively predict the full\nforms under realistic conditions. Finally, extensions of numerical inversion\nare presented which can reduce the inherent biases. These methods will be\nincreasingly important to consider with degraded resolution at low jet energies\ndue to a much higher instantaneous luminosity in the near future.\n", "  The jump-walking Monte-Carlo algorithm is revisited and updated to study the\nequilibrium properties of systems exhibiting quasi-ergodicity. It is designed\nfor a single processing thread as opposed to currently predominant algorithms\nfor large parallel processing systems. The updated algorithm is tested on the\nIsing model and applied to the lattice-gas model for sorption in aerogel at low\ntemperatures, when dynamics of the system is critically slowed down. It is\ndemonstrated that the updated jump-walking simulations are able to produce\nequilibrium isotherms which are typically hidden by the hysteresis effect\ncharacteristic of the standard single-flip simulations.\n", "  The thermal-photon emission from strongly coupled gauge theories at finite\ntemperature is calculated using holographic models for QCD in the Veneziano\nlimit (V-QCD). The emission rates are then embedded in hydrodynamic simulations\ncombined with prompt photons from hard scattering and the thermal photons from\nhadron gas to analyze the spectra and anisotropic flow of direct photons at\nRHIC and LHC. The results from different sources responsible for the thermal\nphotons in QGP including the weakly coupled QGP (wQGP) from perturbative\ncalculations, strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma\n(as a benchmark for reference), and Gubser's phenomenological holographic model\nare then compared. It is found that the direct-photon spectra are enhanced in\nthe strongly coupled scenario compared with the ones in the wQGP, especially at\nhigh momenta. Moreover, both the elliptic flow and triangular flow of direct\nphotons are amplified at high momenta for V-QCD and the SYM plasma. The results\nare further compared with experimental observations.\n", "  We present a new algorithm for spectral clustering based on a column-pivoted\nQR factorization that may be directly used for cluster assignment or to provide\nan initial guess for k-means. Our algorithm is simple to implement, direct, and\nrequires no initial guess. Furthermore, it scales linearly in the number of\nnodes of the graph and a randomized variant provides significant computational\ngains. Provided the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors used for clustering\ncontains a basis that resembles the set of indicator vectors on the clusters,\nwe prove that both our deterministic and randomized algorithms recover a basis\nclose to the indicators in Frobenius norm. We also experimentally demonstrate\nthat the performance of our algorithm tracks recent information theoretic\nbounds for exact recovery in the stochastic block model. Finally, we explore\nthe performance of our algorithm when applied to a real world graph.\n", "  We study the CP-violating phase of the quark sector in the $U(8)$ flavor\nmodel on $T^2/Z_N \\, (N=2,3,4,6)$ with non-vanishing magnetic fluxes, where\nproperties of possible origins of the CP violation are investigated minutely.\nIn this system, a non-vanishing value is mandatory in the real part of the\ncomplex modulus parameter $\\tau$ of the two-dimensional torus. On $T^2$ without\norbifolding, underlying discrete flavor symmetries severely restrict the form\nof Yukawa couplings and it is very difficult to reproduce the observed pattern\nin the quark sector including the CP-violating phase $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$. In\ncases of multiple Higgs doublets emerging on $T^2/Z_2$, the mass matrices of\nthe zero-mode fermions can be written in the Gaussian textures by choosing\nappropriate configurations of vacuum expectation values of the Higgs fields.\nWhen such Gaussian textures of mass matrices are realized, we show that all of\nthe quark profiles, which are mass hierarchies among the quarks, quark mixing\nangles, and $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ can be simultaneously realized.\n", "  The cuprates and iron-based high-temperature superconductors share many\ncommon features: layered strongly anisotropic crystal structure, strong\nelectronic correlations, interplay between different types of electronic\nordering, the intrinsic spatial inhomogeneity due to doping. The understanding\nof complex interplay between these factors is crucial for a directed search of\nnew high-temperature superconductors. Here we show the appearance of\ninhomogeneous gossamer superconductivity in bulk FeSe compound at ambient\npressure and at temperature 5 times higher than its zero-resistance $T_c$. This\ndiscovery helps to understand numerous remarkable superconducting properties of\nFeSe. We also find and prove a general property: if inhomogeneous\nsuperconductivity in a anisotropic conductor first appears in the form of\nisolated superconducting islands, it reduces electric resistivity\nanisotropically with maximal effect along the least conducting axis. This gives\na simple and very general tool to detect inhomogeneous superconductivity in\nanisotropic compounds, which is critically important to study the onset of\nhigh-temperature superconductivity.\n", "  We analyze the ordered phases of Bernal stacked multilayer graphene in the\npresence of interaction induced band gaps due to sublattice symmetry breaking\npotentials, whose solutions can be analyzed in terms of light-mass and\nheavy-mass pseudospin doublets which have the same Chern numbers but opposite\ncharge polarization directions. The application of a perpendicular external\nelectric field reveals an effective Hund's rule for the ordering of the\nsublattice pseudospin doublets in a tetralayer, while a similar but more\ncomplex phase diagram develops with increasing layer number.\n", "  It was shown [New J. Phys. 17, 103037 (2015)] that large and robust\nentanglement between two different mechanical resonators could be achieved,\neither dynamically or in the steady state, in an optomechanical system in which\nthe two mechanical resonators are coupled to a single cavity mode driven by a\nsuitably chosen two-tone field. An important limitation of the scheme is that\nthe cavity decay rate must be much smaller than the two mechanical frequencies\nand their difference. Here we show that the entanglement can be remarkably\nenhanced, and the validity of the scheme can be largely extended, by adding a\ncoherent feedback loop that effectively reduces the cavity decay rate.\n", "  The spatial variations of the velocity field of local stars provide direct\nevidence of Galactic differential rotation. The local divergence, shear, and\nvorticity of the velocity field---the traditional Oort constants---can be\nmeasured based purely on astrometric measurements and in particular depend\nlinearly on proper motion and parallax. I use data for 304,267 main-sequence\nstars from the Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution to perform a local,\nprecise measurement of the Oort constants at a typical heliocentric distance of\n230 pc. The pattern of proper motions for these stars clearly displays the\nexpected effects from differential rotation. I measure the Oort constants to\nbe: A = 15.3+/-0.4 km/s/kpc, B = -11.9+/-0.4 km/s/kpc, C = -3.2+/-0.4 km/s/kpc\nand K = -3.3+/-0.6 km/s/kpc, with no color trend over a wide range of stellar\npopulations. These first confident measurements of C and K clearly demonstrate\nthe importance of non-axisymmetry for the velocity field of local stars and\nthey provide strong constraints on non-axisymmetric models of the Milky Way.\n", "  We investigate the effects of cell division and apopotosis on collective\ndynamics in two-dimensional epithelial tissues. Our model includes three key\ningredients observed across many epithelia, namely cell-cell adhesion, cell\ndeath and a cell division process that depends on the surrounding environment.\nWe show a rich non-equilibrium phase diagram depending on the ratio of cell\ndeath to cell division and on the adhesion strength. For large apopotosis\nrates, cells die out and the tissue disintegrates. As the death rate decreases,\nhowever, we show, consecutively, the existence of a gas-like phase, a gel-like\nphase, and a dense confluent (tissue) phase. Most striking is the observation\nthat the tissue is self-melting through its own internal activity, ruling out\nthe existence of any glassy phase.\n", "  Eliminating disagreement in a group is usually beneficial to the social\nstability. In this paper, using the well-known Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, we\ndesign a quite simple strategy that could resolve the opinion difference of the\nsystem in finite time and induce the opinions synchronized to a targeted value.\nTo be specific, we intentionally introduce weak random noise to only one agent\nto affect its opinion in the evolution and also a leader agent with fixed\nopinion in a divisive group, then strictly prove that the disagreement is\nfinally eliminated and the opinions get synchronized to the leader's opinion in\nfinite time. Other than that, we calculate the finite stopping time when the\nopinions synchronously reach the objective opinion value, which could provide\nfurther guide for designing more efficient noise intervention strategy.\n", "  The recent net-proton fluctuation results of the STAR (Solenoidal Tracker At\nRHIC) experiment from beam energy scan (BES) program at the BNL Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider (RHIC) have drawn much attention to exploring the QCD\ncritical point and the nature of deconfinement phase transition. There has been\nmuch speculation that the non-monotonic behavior of $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ of the\nproduced protons around $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 19.6 GeV in the STAR results may\nbe due to the existence of QCD critical point. However, the experimentally\nmeasured proton distributions contain protons from heavy resonance decays, from\nbaryon stopping and from direct production processes. These proton\ndistributions are used to estimate the net-proton number fluctuation. Because\nit is difficult to disentangle the protons from the above-mentioned sources, it\nis better to devise a method which will account for the directly produced\nbaryons (protons) to study the dynamical fluctuation at different\ncenter-of-mass energies. This is because, it is assumed that any associated\ncriticality in the system could affect the particle production mechanism and\nhence the dynamical fluctuation in various conserved numbers. In the present\nwork, we demonstrate a method to estimate the number of stopped protons at RHIC\nBES energies for central $0-5\\%$ \\auau collisions within STAR acceptance and\ndiscuss its implications on the net-proton fluctuation results.\n", "  Mechanical signaling plays a key role in biological processes like embryo\ndevelopment and cancer growth. One prominent way to probe mechanical properties\nof tissues is to study their response to externally applied forces. Using a\nparticle-based model featuring random apoptosis and environment-dependent\ndivision rates, we evidence a crossover from linear flow to a shear-thinning\nregime with increasing shear rate. To rationalize this non-linear flow we\nderive a theoretical mean-field scenario that accounts for the interplay of\nmechanical and active noise in local stresses. These noises are respectively\ngenerated by the elastic response of the cell matrix to cell rearrangements and\nby the internal activity.\n", "  We consider Chern-Simons theory for gauge group $G$ at level $k$ on\n3-manifolds $M_n$ with boundary consisting of $n$ topologically linked tori.\nThe Euclidean path integral on $M_n$ defines a quantum state on the boundary,\nin the $n$-fold tensor product of the torus Hilbert space. We focus on the case\nwhere $M_n$ is the link-complement of some $n$-component link inside the\nthree-sphere $S^3$. The entanglement entropies of the resulting states define\nframing-independent link invariants which are sensitive to the topology of the\nchosen link. For the Abelian theory at level $k$ ($G= U(1)_k$) we give a\ngeneral formula for the entanglement entropy associated to an arbitrary\n$(m|n-m)$ partition of a generic $n$-component link into sub-links. The formula\ninvolves the number of solutions to certain Diophantine equations with\ncoefficients related to the Gauss linking numbers (mod $k$) between the two\nsublinks. This formula connects simple concepts in quantum information theory,\nknot theory, and number theory, and shows that entanglement entropy between\nsublinks vanishes if and only if they have zero Gauss linking (mod $k$). For $G\n= SU(2)_k$, we study various two and three component links. We show that the\n2-component Hopf link is maximally entangled, and hence analogous to a Bell\npair, and that the Whitehead link, which has zero Gauss linking, nevertheless\nhas entanglement entropy. Finally, we show that the Borromean rings have a\n\"W-like\" entanglement structure (i.e., tracing out one torus does not lead to a\nseparable state), and give examples of other 3-component links which have\n\"GHZ-like\" entanglement (i.e., tracing out one torus does lead to a separable\nstate).\n", "  Based on the full BaBar data sample of 466.5 million BBbar pairs, we present\nmeasurements of the electron spectrum from semileptonic B meson decays. We fit\nthe inclusive electron spectrum to distinguish Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)\nsuppressed B -> Xu e nu decays from the CKM-favored B -> Xc e nu decays, and\nfrom various other backgrounds, and determine the total semileptonic branching\nfraction BR(B -> X e nu) = (10.34 +- 0.04_stat +- 0.26_syst)%, averaged over\nB+- and B0 mesons. We determine the spectrum and branching fraction for\ncharmless B -> Xu e nu decays and extract the CKM element |Vub|, by relying on\nfour different QCD calculations based on the heavy quark expansion. While\nexperimentally, the electron momentum region above 2.1GeV/c is favored, because\nthe background is relatively low, the uncertainties for the theoretical\npredictions are largest in the region near the kinematic endpoint. Detailed\nstudies to assess the impact of these four predictions on the measurements of\nthe electron spectrum, the branching fraction, and the extraction of the CKM\nmatrix element |Vub| are presented, with the lower limit on the electron\nmomentum varied from 0.8GeV/c to the kinematic endpoint. We determine |Vub|\nusing each of these different calculations and find, |Vub| = (3.794 +-\n0.107_exp +0.292-0.219_SF +0.078-0.068_theory)*10^{-3} (De Fazio and Neubert),\n(4.563 +- 0.126_exp +0.230-0.208_SF +0.162-0.163_theory)*10^{-3} (Bosh, Lange,\nNeubert, and Paz), (3.959 +- 0.104_exp +0.164-0.154_SF\n+0.042-0.079_theory)*10^{-3} (Gambino, Giordano, Ossola, and Uraltsev), (3.848\n+- 0.108_exp +0.084-0.070_theory)*10^{-3} (dressed gluon exponentiation), where\nthe stated uncertainties refer to the experimental uncertainties of the partial\nbranching fraction measurement, the shape function parameters, and the\ntheoretical calculations.\n", "  In general relativity (GR), the metric tensor of spacetime is essential since\nit represents the gravitational potential. In other gauge theories (such as\nelectromagnetism), the so-called premetric approach succeeds in separating the\npurely topological field equation from the metric-dependent constitutive law.\nWe show here that GR allows for a premetric formulation, too. For this purpose,\nwe apply the teleparallel approach of gravity, which represents GR as a gauge\ntheory based on the translation group. We formulate the metric-free topological\nfield equation and a general linear constitutive law between the basic field\nvariables. The requirement of local Lorentz invariance turns the model into a\nfull equivalent of GR. Our approach opens a way for a natural extension of GR\nto diverse geometrical structures of spacetime.\n", "  The double copy relates scattering amplitudes in gauge and gravity theories.\nIn this paper, we expand the scope of the double copy to construct spacetime\nmetrics through a systematic perturbative expansion. The perturbative procedure\nis based on direct calculation in Yang-Mills theory, followed by squaring the\nnumerator of certain perturbative diagrams as specified by the double-copy\nalgorithm. The simplest spherically symmetric, stationary spacetime from the\npoint of view of this procedure is a particular member of the\nJanis-Newman-Winicour family of naked singularities. Our work paves the way for\napplications of the double copy to physically interesting problems such as\nperturbative black-hole scattering.\n", "  This work proposes CoMET, a fast and energy-efficient spintronics device for\nlogic applications. An input voltage is applied to a ferroelectric (FE)\nmaterial, in contact with a composite structure - a ferromagnet (FM) with\nin-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) placed on top of an intra-gate FM\ninterconnect with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through the\nmagnetoelectric (ME) effect, the input voltage nucleates a domain wall (DW) at\nthe input end of the PMA-FM interconnect. An applied current then rapidly\npropagates the DW towards the output FE structure, where the inverse-ME effect\ngenerates an output voltage. This voltage is propagated to the input of the\nnext CoMET device using a novel circuit structure that enables efficient device\ncascading. The material parameters for CoMET are optimized by systematically\nexploring the impact of parameter choices on device performance. Simulations on\na 7nm CoMET device show fast, low-energy operation, with a delay/energy of\n98ps/68aJ for INV and 135ps/85aJ for MAJ3.\n", "  The anisotropies of cosmic far-infrared background (CFIRB) probe the star\nformation rate (SFR) of dusty star-forming galaxies as a function of dark\nmatter halo mass and redshift. We explore how future CFIRB experiments can\noptimally improve the SFR constraints beyond the current measurements of\nPlanck. We introduce a model-independent, piecewise parametrization for SFR as\na function of halo mass and redshift, and we calculate the Fisher matrix and\nprincipal components of these parameters to estimate the SFR constraints of\nfuture experiments. We investigate how the SFR constraints depend on angular\nresolution, number and range of frequency bands, survey coverage, and\ninstrumental sensitivity. We find that the angular resolution and the\ninstrumental sensitivity play the key roles. Improving the angular resolution\nfrom 20 to 4 arcmin can improve the SFR constraints by 1.5 - 2.5 orders of\nmagnitude. With the angular resolution of Planck, improving the sensitivity by\n10 or 100 times can improve the SFR constraints by one or two orders of\nmagnitude, and doubling the number of frequency bands can also improve the SFR\nconstraints by an order of magnitude. We find that survey designs like the\nCosmic Origins Explorer (CORE) are very close to the optimal design for\nimproving the SFR constraints at all redshifts, while survey designs like\nLiteBIRD and CMB-S4 can significantly improve the SFR constraints at z>3.\n", "  The structural, electronic, optical and thermodynamic properties of Mo2Ga2C\nare investigated using density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA). The optimized crystal structure is obtained and\nthe lattice parameters are compared with available experimental data. The\nelectronic density of states (DOS) is calculated and analyzed. The metallic\nbehavior for the compound is confirmed and the value of DOS at Fermi level is\n4.2 states per unit cell per eV. Technologically important optical parameters\n(e.g., dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, photo\nconductivity, reflectivity, and loss function) have been calculated for the\nfirst time. The study of dielectric constant (e1) indicates the Drude-like\nbehavior. The absorption and conductivity spectra suggest that the compound is\nmetallic. The reflectance spectrum shows that this compound has the potential\nto be used as a solar reflector. The thermodynamic properties such as the\ntemperature and pressure dependent bulk modulus, Debye temperature, specific\nheats, and thermal expansion coefficient of Mo2Ga2C MAX phase are derived from\nthe quasi-harmonic Debye model with phononic effect also for the first time.\nAnalysis of Tc expression using available parameter values (DOS, Debye\ntemperature, atomic mass etc.) suggests that the compound is less likely to be\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Adler had shown in 1979 that the Toda system can be given a coad- joint orbit\ndescription. We quantize the Toda system by viewing it as a single orbit of a\nmultiplicative group of lower triangular matrices of determinant one with pos-\nitive diagonal entries. We get a unitary representation of the group with\nsquare integrable polarized sections of the quantization as the module . We\nfind the Rawnsley coherent states after a completion of the above space of\nsections. We also find non-unitary finite dimensional quantum Hilbert spaces\nfor the system.\n", "  The Nagaoka ($U=\\infty$) limit of the Hubbard model on a square lattice is\nmapped onto the itinerant-localized Kondo model at infinitely strong coupling.\nSuch a model is well suited to perform quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to\ncompute spin correlation functions. This model is shown to exhibit no\nshort-range ferromagnetic (FM) spin correlations at any doping $\\delta\\ge 0.01$\nand finite temperature, $T=0.1t$. Our simulations give no indication that there\nis a tendency towards ferromagnetic ordering in the ground state.\n", "  We investigate the spectrum of the partial transpose (negativity spectrum) of\ntwo adjacent regions in gapped one-dimensional models. We show that, in the\nlimit of large regions, the negativity spectrum is entirely reconstructed from\nthe entanglement spectrum of the bipartite system. We exploit this result in\nthe XXZ spin chain, for which the entanglement spectrum is known by means of\nthe corner transfer matrix. We find that the negativity spectrum levels are\nequally spaced, the spacing being half that in the entanglement spectrum.\nMoreover, the degeneracy of the spectrum is described by elegant combinatorial\nformulas, which are related to the counting of integer partitions. We also\nderive the asymptotic distribution of the negativity spectrum. We provide exact\nresults for the logarithmic negativity and for the moments of the partial\ntranspose. They exhibit unusual scaling corrections in the limit $\\Delta\\to1^+$\nwith a corrections exponent which is the same as that for the R\\'enyi\nentropies.\n", "  Let $g$ be a metric on the $2$-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ with positive Gaussian\ncurvature and $H$ be a positive constant. Under suitable conditions on $(g,\nH)$, we construct smooth, asymptotically flat $3$-manifolds $M$ with\nnon-negative scalar curvature, with outer-minimizing boundary isometric to\n$(\\mathbb{S}^2, g)$ and having mean curvature $H$, such that near infinity $M$\nis isometric to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold whose mass $m$ can be made\narbitrarily close to a constant multiple of the Hawking mass of\n$(\\mathbb{S}^2,g,H)$. Moreover, this constant multiplicative factor depends\nonly on $(g, H)$ and tends to $1$ as $H$ tends to $0$. The result provides a\nnew upper bound of the Bartnik mass associated to such boundary data.\n", "  Nanomechanical sensors and quantum nanosensors are two rapidly developing\ntechnologies that have diverse interdisciplinary applications in biological and\nchemical analysis and microscopy. For example, nanomechanical sensors based\nupon nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) have demonstrated chip-scale mass\nspectrometry capable of detecting single macromolecules, such as proteins.\nQuantum nanosensors based upon electron spins of negatively-charged\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have demonstrated diverse modes of\nnanometrology, including single molecule magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Here,\nwe report the first step towards combining these two complementary technologies\nin the form of diamond nanomechanical structures containing NV centers. We\nestablish the principles for nanomechanical sensing using such\nnano-spin-mechanical sensors (NSMS) and assess their potential for mass\nspectrometry and force microscopy. We predict that NSMS are able to provide\nunprecedented AC force images of cellular biomechanics and to, not only detect\nthe mass of a single macromolecule, but also image its distribution. When\ncombined with the other nanometrology modes of the NV center, NSMS potentially\noffer unparalleled analytical power at the nanoscale.\n", "  We find a simple modification of the longitudinal mode in General Relativity\nwhich incorporates the idea of limiting curvature. In this case the\nsingularities in contracting Friedmann and Kasner universes are avoided, and\ninstead, the universe has a regular bounce which takes place during the time\ninversely proportional to the square root of the limiting curvature. Away from\nthe bounce, corrections to General Relativity are negligible. In addition the\nnon-singluar modification of General Relativity delivers for free a realistic\ncandidate for Dark Matter.\n", "  We consider the Schwarzschild black hole and show how, in a theory with\nlimiting curvature, the physical singularity \"inside it\" is removed. The\nresulting spacetime is geodesically complete. The internal structure of this\nnonsingular black hole is analogus to Russian nesting dolls. Namely, after\nfalling into the black hole of radius $r_{g}$, an observer, instead of being\ndestroyed at the singularity, gets for a short time into the region with\nlimiting curvature. After that he re-emerges in the near horizon region of a\nspacetime described by the Schwarzschild metric of a gravitational radius\nproportional to $r_{g}^{1/3}$. In the next cycle, after passing the limiting\ncurvature, the observer finds himself within a black hole of even smaller\nradius proportional to $r_{g}^{1/9}$, and so on. Finally after few cycles he\nwill end up in the spacetime where he remains forever at limiting curvature.\n", "  Boson sampling is considered as a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum\ncomputational supremacy over classical computers. However, previous\nproof-of-principle experiments suffered from small photon number and low\nsampling rates owing to the inefficiencies of the single-photon sources and\nmulti-port optical interferometers. Here, we develop two central components for\nhigh-performance boson sampling: robust multi-photon interferometers with 0.99\ntransmission rate, and actively demultiplexed single-photon sources from a\nquantum-dot-micropillar with simultaneously high efficiency, purity and\nindistinguishability. We implement and validate 3-, 4-, and 5-photon boson\nsampling, and achieve sampling rates of 4.96 kHz, 151 Hz, and 4 Hz,\nrespectively, which are over 24,000 times faster than the previous experiments,\nand over 220 times faster than obtaining one sample through calculating the\nmatrices permanent using the first electronic computer (ENIAC) and\ntransistorized computer (TRADIC) in the human history. Our architecture is\nfeasible to be scaled up to larger number of photons and with higher rate to\nrace against classical computers, and might provide experimental evidence\nagainst the Extended Church-Turing Thesis.\n", "  Bound secret information is classical information that contains secrecy but\nfrom which secrecy cannot be extracted. The existence of bound secrecy has been\nconjectured but is currently unproven, and in this work we provide analytical\nand numerical evidence for its existence. Specifically, we consider two-way\npost-processing protocols in prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution based\non the well-known six-state signal states. In terms of the quantum bit-error\nrate $Q$ of the classical data, such protocols currently exist for\n$Q<\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\approx 27.6\\%$. On the other hand, for\n$Q\\geq\\frac{1}{3}$ no such protocol can exist as the observed data is\ncompatible with an intercept-resend attack. This leaves the interesting\nquestion of whether successful protocols exist in the interval\n$\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\leq Q<\\frac{1}{3}$.\n  Previous work has shown that a necessary condition for the existence of\ntwo-way post-processing protocols for distilling secret key is breaking the\nsymmetric extendability of the underlying quantum state shared by Alice and\nBob. Using this result, it has been proven that symmetric extendability can be\nbroken up to the $27.6\\%$ lower bound using the advantage distillation\nprotocol. In this work, we first show that to break symmetric extendability it\nis sufficient to consider a generalized form of advantage distillation\nconsisting of one round of post-selection by Bob on a block of his data. We\nthen provide evidence that such generalized protocols cannot break symmetric\nextendability beyond $27.6\\%$. We thus have evidence to believe that $27.6\\%$\nis an upper bound on two-way post-processing and that the interval\n$\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}\\leq Q<\\frac{1}{3}$ is a domain of bound secrecy.\n", "  Samples of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (anatase, $0.2 \\leq N \\leq\n1.0~wt\\%$) prepared by the sol-gel method were investigated using X-band EPR\nspectroscopy, photoconductivity and photocatalysis measurements. $N\\bullet$ and\n$NO\\bullet$ paramagnetic defects in N-TiO2 have been observed; their\nconcentrations and spin-Hamiltonian parameters were calculated. An increase\nboth in the rate of the generation of free charge carriers and in the rate of\nphotocatalysis was found in N-TiO2 in contrast with non-doped titania under\nvisible light. The correlation of the density of the observed radicals with the\nphotoconductivity and photocatalysis data is discussed.\n", "  We work out the Standard Model (SM) mass spectrum during inflation with\nquantum corrections, and explore its observable consequences in the squeezed\nlimit of non-Gaussianity. Both non-Higgs and Higgs inflation models are studied\nin detail. We also illustrate how some inflationary loop diagrams can be\ncomputed neatly by Wick-rotating the inflation background to Euclidean\nsignature and by dimensional regularization.\n", "  A high performance triple-heterojunction (3HJ) design has been previously\nproposed for tunneling FETs (TFETs). Compared with single heterojunction (HJ)\nTFETs, the 3HJ TFETs have both shorter tunneling distance and two transmission\nresonances that significantly improve the ON-state current ($I_{\\rm{ON}}$).\nCoherent quantum transport simulation predicts, that $I_{\\rm{ON}}=460\\rm{\\mu\nA/\\mu m}$ can be achieved at gate length $Lg=15\\rm{nm}$, supply voltage\n$V_{\\rm{DD}}=0.3\\rm{V}$, and OFF-state current $I_{\\rm{OFF}}=1\\rm{nA/\\mu m}$.\nHowever, strong electron-phonon and electron-electron scattering in the heavily\ndoped leads implies, that the 3HJ devices operate far from the ideal coherent\nlimit. In this study, such scattering effects are assessed by a newly developed\nmultiscale transport model, which combines the ballistic non-equilibrium\nGreen's function method for the channel and the drift-diffusion scattering\nmethod for the leads. Simulation results show that the thermalizing scattering\nin the leads both degrades the 3HJ TFET's subthreshold swing through scattering\ninduced leakage and reduces the turn-on current through the access resistance.\nAssuming bulk scattering rates and carrier mobilities, the $I_{\\rm{ON}}$ is\ndropped from $460\\rm{\\mu A/\\mu m}$ down to $254\\rm{\\mu A/\\mu m}$, which is\nstill much larger than the single HJ TFET case.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory of Raman scattering by a two-dimensional\nFermi liquid (FL) with Rashba and Dresselhaus types of spin-orbit coupling, and\nsubject to an in-plane magnetic field (B). In the long-wavelength limit, the\nRaman spectrum probes the collective modes of such a FL: the chiral spin waves.\nThe characteristic features of these modes are a linear-in-q term in the\ndispersion and the dependence of the mode frequency on the directions of both q\nand B. All of these features have been observed in recent Raman experiments on\nCdTe quantum wells.\n", "  Based on a quasi-one-dimensional limit of quantum Hall states on a thin\ntorus, we construct a model of interaction-induced topological pumping which\nmimics the Hall response of the bosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) state. The\nquasi-one-dimensional counterpart of the BIQH state is identified as the\nHaldane phase composed of two-component bosons which form effective spin-$1$\ndegrees of freedom. An adiabatic change between the Haldane phase and trivial\nMott insulators constitute {\\it off-diagonal} topological pumping in which the\ntranslation of the lattice potential for one component induces a current in the\nother. The mechanism of this pumping is interpreted in terms of changes in\npolarizations between symmetry-protected quantized values.\n", "  Using 106~million $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector, we\nmeasure multipole amplitudes for the decay\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c1,2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma J/\\psi$ beyond the\ndominant electric-dipole amplitudes. The normalized magnetic-quadrupole\namplitude for $\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c1,2}\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma\nJ/\\psi$ and the normalized electric-octupole amplitudes for\n$\\psi(3686)rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c2}$,~$\\chi_{c2}\\rightarrow\\gamma J/\\psi$ are\ndetermined. The M2 amplitudes for $\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c1}$ and\n$\\chi_{c1,2}\\rightarrow\\gamma J/\\psi$ are found to differ significantly from\nzero and are consistent with theoretical predictions. We also obtain the ratios\nof M2 contributions of $\\psi(3686)$ and $J/\\psi$ decays to $\\chi_{c1,2}$,\n$b_{2}^{1}/b_{2}^{2} = 1.35\\pm0.72$ and $a_{2}^{1}/a_{2}^{2} = 0.617\\pm0.083$,\nwhich agree well with theoretical expectations. By considering the multipole\ncontributions of $\\chi_{c1,2}$, we measure the product branching fractions for\nthe cascade decays $\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c0,1,2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma\nJ/\\psi$ and search for the process $\\eta_{c}(2S)\\to\\gamma J/\\psi$ through\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta_{c}(2S)$. The product branching fraction for\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c0}\\to\\gamma\\gamma J/\\psi$ is 3$\\sigma$\nlarger than published measurements, while those of\n$\\psi(3686)rightarrow\\gamma\\chi_{c1,2}\\to\\gamma\\gamma J/\\psi$ are consistent.\nNo significant signal for the decay $\\psi(3686)\\to\\gamma \\eta_c(2S)\\to\\gamma\n\\gamma J/\\psi$ is observed, and the upper limit of the product branching\nfraction at the 90\\% confidence level is determined.\n", "  In the present work a generalization of the BTZ black hole is studied, for\nthe case of scale dependent couplings. One starts by using the effective action\nfor scale dependence couplings to get a generalization of the Einstein field\nequations. Self consistent solutions for lapse function, cosmological coupling\nand Newtons coupling are found. The effect of scale dependent couplings with\nrespect to the classical solution is shown. Moreover, asymptotic behavior as\nwell as thermodynamic properties were investigated. Finally, an alternative way\nto get the scale dependent Newton coupling, from the so-called \"Null Energy\nCondition\" is presented.\n", "  Recently a repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102 has been confirmed to be\nan extragalactic event and a persistent radio counterpart has been identified.\nWhile other possibilities are not ruled out, the emission properties are\nbroadly consistent with Murase et al. (2016) that theoretically proposed\nquasi-steady radio emission as a counterpart of both FRBs and pulsar-driven\nsupernovae. Here we constrain the model parameters of such a young neutron star\nscenario for FRB 121102. If the associated supernova has a conventional ejecta\nmass of $M_{\\rm ej}\\gtrsim{\\rm a \\ few}\\ M_\\odot$, a neutron star with an age\nof $t_{\\rm age} \\sim 10-100 \\ \\rm yrs$, an initial spin period of $P_{i}\n\\lesssim$ a few ms, and a dipole magnetic field of $B_{\\rm dip} \\lesssim {\\rm a\n\\ few} \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm G$ can be compatible with the observations.\nHowever, in this case, the magnetically-powered scenario may be favored as an\nFRB energy source because of the efficiency problem in the rotation-powered\nscenario. On the other hand, if the associated supernova is an ultra-stripped\none or the neutron star is born by the accretion-induced collapse with $M_{\\rm\nej} \\sim 0.1 \\ M_\\odot$, a younger neutron star with $t_{\\rm age} \\sim 1-10$\nyrs can be the persistent radio source and might produce FRBs with the\nspin-down power. These possibilities can be distinguished by the decline rate\nof the quasi-steady radio counterpart.\n", "  We compute quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the metric and gauge field\nperturbations about black branes electrically and magnetically charged in the\nEinstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. By the gauge/gravity correspondence, this\ntheory is dual to a particular class of field theories with a chiral anomaly,\nin a thermal charged plasma state subjected to a constant external magnetic\nfield, $B$. The QNMs are dual to the poles of the two-point functions of the\nenergy-momentum and axial current operators, and they encode information about\nthe dissipation and transport of charges in the plasma. Complementary to the\ngravity calculation, we work out the hydrodynamic description of the dual field\ntheory in the presence of a chiral anomaly, and a constant external $B$. We\nfind good agreement with the weak field hydrodynamics, which can extend beyond\nthe weak $B$ regime into intermediate regimes. Furthermore, we provide results\nthat can be tested against thermodynamics and hydrodynamics in the strong $B$\nregime. We find QNMs exhibiting Landau level behavior, which become long-lived\nat large $B$ if the anomaly coefficient exceeds a critical magnitude. Chiral\ntransport is analyzed beyond the hydrodynamic approximation for the five\n(formerly) hydrodynamic modes, including a chiral magnetic wave.\n", "  This Letter reports new results on muon neutrino disappearance from NOvA,\nusing a 14 kton detector equivalent exposure of $6.05\\times10^{20}$\nprotons-on-target from the NuMI beam at the Fermi National Accelerator\nLaboratory. The measurement probes the muon-tau symmetry hypothesis that\nrequires maximal mixing ($\\theta_{23} = \\pi/4$). Assuming the normal mass\nhierarchy, we find $\\Delta m^2 = (2.67 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-3}$ eV$^2$ and\n$\\sin^2 \\theta_{23}$ at the two statistically degenerate values\n$0.404^{+0.030}_{-0.022}$ and $0.624^{+0.022}_{-0.030}$, both at the 68%\nconfidence level. Our data disfavor the maximal mixing scenario with 2.6\n$\\sigma$ significance.\n", "  We introduce new measures of multipartite quantum correlations based on\nclassical correlations in mutually unbiased bases. These classical correlations\nare measured in terms of the classical mutual information, which has a clear\noperational meaning. We present sufficient conditions under which these\nmeasures are maximized. States that have previously been shown to be\nparticularily important in the context of LOCC transformations fulfill these\nconditions and therefore maximize the correlation measures. In addition, we\nshow how the new measures can be used to detect high-dimensional tripartite\nentanglement by using only a few local measurements.\n", "  We theoretically study the unique applications of optomechanics based on\ntraveling-wave microresonators, where the optomechanical coupling of degenerate\nmodes can be enhanced selectively by optically pumping in different directions.\nWe show that the unique features of degenerate optical modes can be applied to\nthe entangled photon generation of clockwise and counter-clockwise optical\nmodes, and the nonclassicality of entangled photon pair is discussed. The\ncoherent coupling between the clockwise and counter-clockwise optical mods and\ntwo acoustic modes is also studied, in which the relative phase of the\noptomechanical couplings plays a key role in the optical non-reciprocity. The\nparity-time symmetry of acoustic modes can be observed in the slightly deformed\nmicroresonator with the interaction of forward and backward stimulated\nBrillouin Scattering in the triple-resonance system. In addition, the\ndegenerate modes are in the decoherence-free subspace, which is robust against\nenvironmental noises. Based on parameters realized in recent experiments, these\noptomechanical devices should be readily achievable.\n", "  We determine the end point of the axisymmetric ultraspinning instability of\nasymptotically flat Myers-Perry black holes in D = 6 spacetime dimensions. In\nthe non-linear regime, this instability gives rise to a sequence of concentric\nrings connected by segments of black membrane on the rotation plane. The latter\nbecome thinner over time, resulting in the formation of a naked singularity in\nfinite asymptotic time and hence a violation of the weak cosmic censorship\nconjecture in asymptotically flat higher-dimensional spaces.\n", "  We describe designs for the realization of topological Majorana qubits in\nterms of proximitized topological insulator nanoribbons pierced by a uniform\naxial magnetic field. This platform holds promise for particularly robust\nMajorana bound states, with easily manipulable inter-state couplings. We\npropose proof-of-principle experiments for initializing, manipulating, and\nreading out Majorana box qubits defined in floating devices dominated by\ncharging effects. We argue that the platform offers design advantages which\nmake it particularly suitable for extension to qubit network structures\nrealizing a Majorana surface code.\n", "  New resonance $\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$, reported by LHCb, is a key to establish\n\\emph{D}-wave charmed and charmed-strange baryon families. In this work, we\nfirst carry out an analysis of mass spectra of the $\\lambda$-mode excited\ncharmed and charmed-strange baryon states, which may reveal the relation of\n$\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$, $\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$, $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)^+$,\n$i.e.$, $\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$ and $\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ can form a \\emph{D}-wave\ndoublet $[3/2^+,5/2^+]$ while $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)^+$ are the\nstrange partners of $\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$ and $\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$, respectively.\nFurther study of their two-body Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-allowed decays supports\n$\\Lambda_c(2860)^+$ and $\\Xi_c(3055)^+$ as the \\emph{D}-wave charmed and\ncharmed-strange baryons, respectively, with $J^P=3/2^+$. For\n$\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)^+$, however, there exist some difficulties\nunder the \\emph{D}-wave assignment with $J^P=5/2^+$ since the experimental\nwidths and some ratios of partial width of $\\Lambda_c(2880)^+$ and\n$\\Xi_c(3080)^+$ cannot be reproduced in our calculation.\n", "  We derive the exact gravitational wave solutions in a general class of\nquadratic Poincar\\'e gauge gravity models. The Lagrangian includes all possible\nlinear and quadratic invariants constructed from the torsion and the curvature,\nincluding the parity odd terms. The ansatz for the gravitational wave\nconfiguration and the properties of the wave solutions are patterned following\nthe corresponding ansatz and the properties of the plane-fronted\nelectromagnetic wave.\n", "  We continue to explore the scaling transformation in the reduced action\nformalism of gravity models. As an extension of our construction, we consider\nthe extended forms of the Smarr relation for various black holes, adopting the\ncosmological constant as the bulk pressure as in some literatures on black\nholes. Firstly, by using the quasi-local formalism for charges, we show that,\nin a general theory of gravity, the volume in the black hole thermodynamics\ncould be defined as the thermodynamic conjugate variable to the bulk pressure\nin such a way that the first law can be extended consistently. This, so called,\nthermodynamic volume can be expressed explicitly in terms of the metric and\nfield variables. Then, by using the scaling transformation allowed in the\nreduced action formulation, we obtain the extended Smarr relation involving the\nbulk pressure and the thermodynamic volume. In our approach, we do not resort\nto Euler's homogeneous scaling of charges while incorporating the would-be\nhairy contribution without any difficulty.\n", "  We consider cosmological evolution from the perspective of quantum\ninformation. We present a quantum circuit model for the expansion of a comoving\nregion of space, in which initially-unentangled ancilla qubits become entangled\nas expansion proceeds. We apply this model to the comoving region that now\ncoincides with our Hubble volume, taking the number of entangled degrees of\nfreedom in this region to be proportional to the de Sitter entropy. The quantum\ncircuit model is applicable for at most 140 $e$-folds of inflationary and\npost-inflationary expansion: we argue that no geometric description was\npossible before the time $t_1$ when our comoving region was one Planck length\nacross, and contained one pair of entangled degrees of freedom. This approach\ncould provide a framework for modeling the initial state of inflationary\nperturbations.\n", "  How can we approach the truth in a society? It may depend on various factors.\nIn this paper, using a well-established truth seeking model, we show that the\npersistent free information flow will bring us to the truth. Here the free\ninformation flow is modeled as the environmental random noise that could alter\none's cognition. Without the random noise, the model predicts that the truth\ncan only be captured by the truth seekers who own active perceptive ability of\nthe truth and their believers, while the other individuals may stick to\nfalsehood. But under the influence of the random noise, we strictly prove that\neven there is only one truth seeker in the group, all individuals will finally\napproach the truth.\n", "  A near perfect, storage time-extended photon echo-based quantum memory\nprotocol has been analyzed by solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations for a\nbackward scheme in a three-level system. The backward photon echo scheme is\ncombined with a controlled coherence conversion process via control Rabi\nflopping to a third state, where the control Rabi flopping collectively shifts\nthe phase of the ensemble coherence. The propagation direction of photon echoes\nis coherently determined by the phase matching condition between the data\n(quantum) and the control (classical) pulses. Herein we discuss the classical\ncontrollability of a quantum state for both phase and propagation direction by\nmanipulating the control pulses in both single and double rephasing photon echo\nschemes of a three-level system. Compared with their well-understood use for\ntwo-level photon echoes, the Maxwell-Bloch equations to a three-level system\nhave a critical limitation regarding the phase change when interacted with an\narbitrary control pulse area.\n", "  The development of needle-free injection systems utilizing high-speed\nmicrojets is of great importance to world healthcare. It is thus crucial to\ncontrol the microjets, which are often induced by underwater shock waves. In\nthis contribution from fluid-mechanics point of view, we experimentally\ninvestigate the effect of a shock wave on the velocity of a free surface\n(microjet) and underwater cavitation onset in a microchannel, focusing on the\npressure impulse and peak pressure of the shock wave. The shock wave used had a\nnon-spherically-symmetric peak pressure distribution and a spherically\nsymmetric pressure impulse distribution [Tagawa et al., J. Fluid Mech., 2016,\n808, 5-18]. First, we investigate the effect of the shock wave on the jet\nvelocity by installing a narrow tube and a hydrophone in different\nconfigurations in a large water tank, and measuring the shock wave pressure and\nthe jet velocity simultaneously. The results suggest that the jet velocity\ndepends only on the pressure impulse of the shock wave. We then investigate the\neffect of the shock wave on the cavitation onset by taking measurements in an\nL-shaped microchannel. The results suggest that the probability of cavitation\nonset depends only on the peak pressure of the shock wave. In addition, the jet\nvelocity varies according to the presence or absence of cavitation. The above\nfindings provide new insights for advancing a control method for high-speed\nmicrojets.\n", "  Starting from IP-Glasma initial conditions, we investigate the effects of\nbulk pressure on thermal dilepton production at the Relativistic Heavy Ion\nCollider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) energies. Though results of\nthe thermal dilepton $v_2$ under the influence of both bulk and shear viscosity\nis presented for top RHIC energy, more emphasis is put on LHC energy where such\na calculation is computed for the first time. The effects of the bulk pressure\non thermal dilepton $v_2$ at the LHC are explored through bulk-induced\nmodifications on the dilepton yield.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of a continuous opinion model, driven by\nkinetic exchanges in a fully-connected population. Opinions range in the real\ninterval $[-1,1]$, representing the different shades of opinions against and\nfor an issue under debate. Individual's opinions evolve through pairwise\ninteractions, with couplings that are typically positive, but a fraction $p$ of\nnegative ones is allowed. Moreover, a social temperature parameter $T$ controls\nthe tendency of the individual responses towards neutrality. Depending on $p$\nand $T$, different collective states emerge: symmetry broken (one side wins),\nsymmetric (tie of opposite sides) and absorbing neutral (indecision wins). We\nfind the critical points and exponents that characterize the phase transitions\nbetween them. The symmetry breaking transition belongs to the usual Ising\nmean-field universality class, but the absorbing-phase transitions, with\n$\\beta=0.5$, are out of the paradigmatic directed percolation class. Moreover,\nordered phases can emerge by increasing social temperature.\n", "  Mesons as bound states of quark and anti-quark in the framework of a\nrelativistic potential model are studied. Interaction of constituents in bound\nstate is described by the Lorentz-scalar QCD inspired funnel-type potential\nwith the coordinate dependent strong coupling, {\\alpha}S(r). Lagrangian\nrelativistic mechanics is used to derive the main dynamic two particle equation\nof motion. On this basis, relativistic two body wave equation is derived.\nSolution of the equation for the system in the form of a standing wave is\nobtained. Two exact asymptotic expressions for the meson squared mass are\nobtained and used to derive the meson universal mass formula. Light and heavy\nmeson mass spectra are calculated.\n", "  We discuss a novel microscopic model for collective decision-making\ninteracting multi-agent systems. In particular we are interested in modeling a\nwell known phenomena in the experimental literature called equality bias, where\nagents tend to behave in the same way as if they were as good, or as bad, as\ntheir partner. We analyze the introduced problem and we prove the suboptimality\nof the collective decision-making in the presence of equality bias. Numerical\nexperiments are addressed in the last section.\n", "  Transcription of the genetic message encoded chemically in the sequence of\nthe DNA template is carried out by a molecular machine called RNA polymerase\n(RNAP). Backward or forward slippage of the nascent RNA with respect to the DNA\ntemplate strand give rise to a transcript that is, respectively, longer or\nshorter than the corresponding template. We model a RNAP as a \"Tape-copying\nTuring machine\" (TCTM) where the DNA template is the input tape while the\nnascent RNA strand is the output tape. Although the TCTM always steps forward\nthe process is assumed to be stochastic that has a probability of occurrence\nper unit time. The time taken by a TCTM for each single successful forward\nstepping on the input tape, during which the output tape suffers lengthening or\nshortening by $n$ units because of backward or forward slippage, is a random\nvariable; we report some of the statistical characteristics of this time by\nusing the formalism for calculation of the distributions of {\\it first-passage\ntime}. The results are likely to find applications in the analysis of\nexperimental data on \"programmed\" transcriptional error caused by\ntranscriptional slippage which is a mode of \"recoding\" of genetic information.\n", "  We present a uniform framework for the treatment of a large class of toy\nmodels of quantum theory. Specifically, we will be interested in theories of\nwavefunctions valued in commutative involutive semirings, and which give rise\nto some semiring-based notion of classical non-determinism via the Born rule.\nThe models obtained with our construction possess many of the familiar\nstructures used in Categorical Quantum Mechanics. We also provide a bestiary of\nincreasingly exotic examples: some well known, such as real quantum theory and\nrelational quantum theory; some less known, such as hyperbolic quantum theory,\np-adic quantum theory and \"parity quantum theory\"; and some entirely new, such\nas \"finite-field quantum theory\" and \"tropical quantum theory\". As a further\nbonus, the measurement scenarios arising within these theories can be studied\nusing the sheaf-theoretic framework for non-locality and contextuality. Their\ncomputational complexity can similarly be studied within existing frameworks\nfor affine and unitary circuits over commutative semirings.\n", "  Composite and janus type metallo-dielectric nanoparticles are increasingly\nconsidered as a means to control the spatial and temporal behavior of\nelectromagnetic fields in diverse applications such as coupling to quantum\nemitters, achieve invisibility cloaks, and obtain quantum correlations between\nqubits. We investigate the surface modes of a toroidal nano-structure and\nobtain the canonical plasmon dispersion relations and resonance modes for\narbitrarily layered nanorings. Unlike particle plasmon eigenmodes in other\ngeometries, the amplitudes of the eigenmodes of tori exhibit a distinct forward\nand backward coupling. We present the plasmon dispersion relations for several\nrelevant toroidal configurations in the quasistatic limit and obtain the\ndominant retarded dispersion relations of a single ring for comparison, discuss\nmode complementarity and hybridization, and introduce two new types of toroidal\nparticles in the form of janus nanorings. The resonance frequencies for the\nfirst few dominant modes of a ring composed of plasmon supporting materials\nsuch as gold, silver, and aluminum are provided and compared to those for a\nsilicon ring. A generalized Green's function is obtained for multilayer tori\nallowing for calculation of the scattering response to interacting fields.\nEmploying the Green's function, the scalar electric potential distribution\ncorresponding to individual poloidal and toroidal modes in response to an\narbitrarily polarized external field and the field of electrons is obtained.\nThe results are applied to obtain the local density of states and decay rate of\na dipole near the center of the torus.\n", "  Various models of quantum gravity imply the Planck-scale modifications of\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principle into a so-called generalized uncertainty\nprinciple (GUP). The GUP effects on high-energy physics, cosmology, and\nastrophysics have been extensively studied. Here, we focus on the\nweak-equivalence-principle (WEP) violation induced by the GUP. Results from the\nWEP test with the $^{85}$Rb-$^{87}$Rb dual-species atom interferometer are used\nto set upper bounds on parameters in two GUP proposals. A $10^{45}$-level bound\non the Kempf-Mangano-Mann proposal, and a $10^{27}$-level bound on Maggiore's\nproposal, which are consistent with bounds from other experiments, are\nobtained. All these bounds have huge room for improvement in the future.\n", "  Here we investigate the evolution of a Milky Way (MW) -like galaxy with the\naim of predicting the properties of its progenitors all the way from $z \\sim\n20$ to $z = 0$. We apply GAMESH (Graziani et al. 2015) to a high resolution\nN-Body simulation following the formation of a MW-type halo and we investigate\nits properties at $z \\sim 0$ and its progenitors in $0 < z < 4$. Our model\npredicts the observed galaxy main sequence, the mass-metallicity and the\nfundamental plane of metallicity relations in $0 < z < 4$. It also reproduces\nthe stellar mass evolution of candidate MW progenitors in $0 \\lesssim z\n\\lesssim 2.5$, although the star formation rate and gas fraction of the\nsimulated galaxies follow a shallower redshift dependence. We find that while\nthe MW star formation and chemical enrichment are dominated by the contribution\nof galaxies hosted in Lyman $\\alpha$-cooling halos, at z > 6 the contribution\nof star forming mini-halos is comparable to the star formation rate along the\nMW merger tree. These systems might then provide an important contribution in\nthe early phases of reionization. A large number of mini-halos with old stellar\npopulations, possibly Population~III stars, are dragged into the MW or survive\nin the Local Group. At low redshift dynamical effects, such as halo mergers,\ntidal stripping and halo disruption redistribute the baryonic properties among\nhalo families. These results are critically discussed in light of future\nimprovements including a more sophisticated treatment of radiative feedback and\ninhomogeneous metal enrichment.\n", "  We analyze the symmetry properties of the dipolar Hamiltonian as the main\nrelaxation mechanism responsible for the observed NMR spectra of long lived\nstates in methyl groups. Long lived states exhibit relaxation times that are\nconsiderably longer than the spin-lattice relaxation time, T1. The analysis\nbrings clarity to the key components of the relaxation mechanism of long lived\nstates by focusing exclusively on the symmetry of the spin Hamiltonian. Our\nstudy shows that the dipole-dipole coupling between protons of a methyl group\nand between the protons and an external spin are both symmetry breaking\ninteractions that can lead to relaxation pathways that transform the\npolarization from symmetry order to Zeeman order, but the net contribution of\nthe internal dipolar interaction to the NMR observation of long lived states is\nzero. Our calculation is in agreement with the reported features of the\nobserved spectra.\n", "  We theoretically study the proximity effect in the thin-film layered\nferromagnet (F) - superconductor (S) heterostructures in F$_1$F$_2$S design. We\nconsider the boundary value problem for the Usadel-like equations in the case\nof so-called \"dirty\" limit. The \"latent\" superconducting pairing interaction in\nF layers taken into account. The focus is on the recipe of experimental\npreparation the state with so-called solitary superconductivity. We also\npropose and discuss the model of the superconducting spin valve based on\nF$_1$F$_2$S trilayers in solitary superconductivity regime.\n", "  This talk addresses two topics related to CP asymmetries in $D$ meson decays\nto two pseudoscalar mesons. First I discuss how new physics can be\ndistinguished from the Standard Model through two sum rules relating three\ndirect CP asymmetries each, using the sum rule correlating $D^0\\to K^+K^-$,\n$D^0\\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, and $D^0\\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ for illustration. The other sum\nrule involves $a_{CP}^{\\mathrm{dir}}(D^+\\rightarrow \\bar{K}^0K^+)$,\n$a_{CP}^{\\mathrm{dir}}(D_s^+\\rightarrow K^0\\pi^+)$, and\n$a_{CP}^{\\mathrm{dir}}(D_s^+\\to K^+ \\pi^0)$. The second topic is the direct CP\nasymmetry in the decay $D^0 \\to K_S K_S$, which is expected to be large in the\nStandard Model for two reasons: Flavor-SU(3) symmetry suppresses the tree\namplitude which enhances the crucial \"penguin-to-tree\" ratio and the \"penguin\"\namplitude is dominated by the tree-level $W$ boson exchange between $c$ and $u$\nquarks. We find that $|a_{CP}^{\\mathrm{dir}} (D^0 \\to K_S K_S)|$ can be as\nlarge as $1.1 \\%$ in the Standard Model. We advocate $D^0 \\to K_S K_S$ as a\ndiscovery channel for charm CP violation.\n", "  The mixing-induced CP asymmetries in $B_d \\to J/\\psi K_S$ and $B_s \\to J/\\psi\n\\phi$ are essential to detect or constrain new physics in the $B_d\\! -\n\\overline{\\!B}{}_d$ and $B_s\\! - \\overline{\\!B}{}_s$ mixing amplitudes,\nrespectively. To this end one must control the penguin contributions to the\ndecay amplitudes, which affect the extraction of fundamental CP phases from the\nmeasured CP asymmetries. Although the \"penguin pollution\" is doubly\nCabibbo-suppressed, it could compete in size with current experimental errors.\nIn this talk I present a calculation of the penguin contributions treating QCD\neffects with soft-collinear factorisation and compare method and results with\nthe alternative approach employing flavour-SU(3) symmetry. As a novel feature,\nI present results for the penguin pollution in $b\\to c\\overline c d$ modes.\n", "  We present a protocol for measuring the quadrature of a harmonic oscillator\n(HO). The HO is coupled to a qubit, with an interaction modulated by the qubit\ncontrol and effectively proportional to the HO quadrature $I$. Repeated\nmeasurement of the qubit leads to gradually increasing information on the\nquadrature $I$, leading to squeezing. We derive an analytical formula for the\nquadrature variance, $(\\Delta I)^2 = 1/(1+4\\phi^2 s)$, with $\\phi$ the product\nof interaction strength and interaction time and $s$ the number of repetitions\nof the measurement. We discuss the robustness of this scheme against\ndecoherence. We find that this protocol could lead to significant squeezing in\na realistic setup formed of a superconducting flux qubit used to measure an\nelectrical or mechanical resonator.\n", "  To develop a better understanding of energy transfer between wind and\ndifferent types of waves a model was created to determine growth factors and\nenergy transfers on breaking waves and the resulting velocity vectors. This\nmodel was used to build on the research of Sajjadi et al. (1996) on the growth\nof waves by sheared flow and takes models of wave velocities developed by Weber\nand Melsom (1993) and end energy transfer by Sajjadi, Hunt and Drullion (2014).\n", "  Coherent energy exchange between plasmons and excitons is a phenomenon that\narises in the strong coupling regime resulting in distinct hybrid states. The\nDNA-origami technique provides an ideal framework to custom-tune\nplasmon-exciton nanostructures. By employing this well controlled self-assembly\nprocess, we realized hybrid states by precisely positioning metallic\nnanoparticles in a defined spatial arrangement with fixed nanometer-sized\ninterparticle spacing. Varying the nanoparticle diameter between 30 nm and 60\nnm while keeping their separation distance constant allowed us to precisely\nadjust the plasmon resonance of the structure to accurately match the energy\nfrequency of a J-aggregate exciton. With this system we obtained strong\nplasmon-exciton coupling and studied far-field scattering at the\nsingle-structure level. The individual structures displayed normal mode\nsplitting up to 170 meV. The plasmon tunability and the strong field\nconfinement attained with nanodimers on DNA-origami renders an ideal tool to\nbottom-up assembly plasmon-exciton systems operating at room temperature.\n", "  Spin-dependent exchange-correlation energy functionals in use today depend on\nthe charge density and the magnetization density: $E_{\\rm xc}[\\rho,{\\bf m}]$.\nHowever, it is also correct to define the functional in terms of the curl of\n${\\bf m}$ for physical external fields: $E_{\\rm xc}[\\rho,\\nabla\\times{\\bf m}]$.\nThe exchange-correlation magnetic field, ${\\bf B}_{\\rm xc}$, then becomes\nsource-free. We study this variation of the theory by uniquely removing the\nsource term from local and generalized gradient approximations to the\nfunctional. By doing so, the total Kohn-Sham moments are improved for a wide\nrange of materials for both functionals. Significantly, the moments for the\npnictides are now in good agreement with experiment. We also predict dramatic\ndifferences in the spatial geometry of ${\\bf B}_{\\rm xc}$ for the pnictides.\nOur source-free method is simple to implement in all existing density\nfunctional theory codes.\n", "  This article presents general procedures for constructing, estimating, and\ntesting Hilbert space multi-dimensional (HSM) models, which are based on\nquantum probability theory. HSM models can be applied to collections of K\ndifferent contingency tables obtained from a set of p variables that are\nmeasured under different contexts. A context is defined by the measurement of a\nsubset of the p variables that are used to form a table. HSM models provide a\nrepresentation of the collection of K tables in a low dimensional vector space,\neven when no single joint probability distribution across the p variables\nexists. HSM models produce parameter estimates that provide a simple and\ninformative interpretation of the complex collection of tables. Comparisons of\nHSM model fits with Bayes net model fits are reported for a new large\nexperiment, demonstrating the viability of this new model. We conclude that the\nmodel is broadly applicable to social and behavioral science data sets.\n", "  Efficient complex systems have a modular structure, but modularity does not\nguarantee robustness, because efficiency also requires an ingenious interplay\nof the interacting modular components. The human brain is the elemental\nparadigm of an efficient robust modular system interconnected as a network of\nnetworks (NoN). Understanding the emergence of robustness in such modular\narchitectures from the interconnections of its parts is a long-standing\nchallenge that has concerned many scientists. Current models of dependencies in\nNoN inspired by the power grid express interactions among modules with fragile\ncouplings that amplify even small shocks, thus preventing functionality.\nTherefore, we introduce a model of NoN to shape the pattern of brain\nactivations to form a modular environment that is robust. The model predicts\nthe map of neural collective influencers (NCIs) in the brain, through the\noptimization of the influence of the minimal set of essential nodes responsible\nfor broadcasting information to the whole-brain NoN. Our results suggest new\nintervention protocols to control brain activity by targeting influential\nneural nodes predicted by network theory.\n", "  In 1934, Max Born and Leopold Infeld suggested and developed a nonlinear\nmodification of Maxwell electrodynamics, in which the electrostatic self-energy\nof an electron was a finite value. In this paper, after a brief introduction to\nLagrangian formulation of Born-Infeld electrodynamics with an external source,\nthe explicit forms of Gauss's law and the electrostatic energy density in\nBorn-Infeld theory are obtained. The capacitance and the stored electrostatic\nenergy for a parallel-plate and spherical capacitors are computed in the\nframework of Born-Infeld electrostatics. We show that the usual relations\n$U=\\frac{1}{2}C_{_{\\textrm{Maxwell}}}(\\triangle \\phi)^{2}$ and\n$U=\\frac{q^{2}}{2C_{_{\\textrm{Maxwell}}}}$ are not valid for a capacitor in\nBorn-Infeld electrostatics. Numerical estimations in this research show that\nthe nonlinear corrections to the capacitance and the stored electrostatic\nenergy for a capacitor in Born-Infeld electrostatics are considerable when the\npotential difference between the plates of a capacitor is very large.\n", "  Astrophysics and cosmology are rich with data. The advent of wide-area\ndigital cameras on large aperture telescopes has led to ever more ambitious\nsurveys of the sky. Data volumes of entire surveys a decade ago can now be\nacquired in a single night and real-time analysis is often desired. Thus,\nmodern astronomy requires big data know-how, in particular it demands highly\nefficient machine learning and image analysis algorithms. But scalability is\nnot the only challenge: Astronomy applications touch several current machine\nlearning research questions, such as learning from biased data and dealing with\nlabel and measurement noise. We argue that this makes astronomy a great domain\nfor computer science research, as it pushes the boundaries of data analysis. In\nthe following, we will present this exciting application area for data\nscientists. We will focus on exemplary results, discuss main challenges, and\nhighlight some recent methodological advancements in machine learning and image\nanalysis triggered by astronomical applications.\n", "  Generally displacement fields in the vicinity of voids were determined by the\nequations of theory of elasticity. Such a description has its disadvantages as\nit does not take into account the discrete atomic structure of materials and it\nshould be expected that atom displacements in the vicinity of nanovoids should\nsignificantly differ from the predictions of mentioned theory. In our recent\nworks a new variant of Molecular Static method was developed. In particular in\nthis model an iterative procedure is used in which the atomic structure in the\nvicinity of defect and constant, determining the displacement of atoms embedded\ninto an elastic continuum, are obtained in a self-consistent manner. In this\nwork we use our model for investigation of the atomic structure in the vicinity\nof nanovoids of different sizes. Results show that the displacements are\nsignificantly different for variant crystallographic directions and these\ndifferences are particularly large in bcc metals.\n", "  Quantum Key Recycling (QKR) is a quantum-cryptographic primitive that allows\none to re-use keys in an unconditionally secure way. By removing the need to\nrepeatedly generate new keys it improves communication efficiency. Skoric and\nde Vries recently proposed a QKR scheme based on 8-state encoding (four bases).\nIt does not require quantum computers for encryption/decryption but only\nsingle-qubit operations.\n  We provide a missing ingredient in the security analysis of this scheme in\nthe case of noisy channels: accurate bounds on the privacy amplification. We\ndetermine optimal attacks against the message and against the key, for 8-state\nencoding as well as 4-state and 6-state conjugate coding. We show that the\nShannon entropy analysis for 8-state encoding reduces to the analysis of\nQuantum Key Distribution, whereas 4-state and 6-state suffer from additional\nleaks that make them less effective. We also provide results in terms of the\nmin-entropy. Overall, 8-state encoding yields the highest capacity.\n", "  The terahertz FEL ferromagnetic undulator has been created. The length of the\nundulator period is 9cm, number of the periods is 27. By means of selection and\nredistribution of magnetic elements the spread of amplitudes of the magnetic\nfield was reduced to 7%. Additional windings of magnetic elements were used to\ncompensate for residual spread. Required focusing gradient of magnetic field\nwas obtained as a result of relative displacement of alternating poles with\nopposite charge of magnetic field along the x axis. Parameters of undulator\nincluding focusing properties in the horizontal plane were investigated.\n", "  In this paper is presented the reliability test the numerical generalization\nof Bethe-Weizsacker mass formula which describes the values of measured 2654\nnuclei masses in AME2012 nuclear database: https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/, with\naccuracy in the interval (-1.90,1.80) MeV, for the nulear with mass number\nA=2(1,1) to 294(117,177). In the analyzed generalization of the\nBethe-Weizsacker formula the little correction of proton and neutron magic\nnumbers and boundaries of their influence was derived as a solution of\nnonlinear inverce problem (Ivanenko shell model!). There was confirmed the\nexistence of ten proton (2,8,14,20,28,50,82,96,108,126) and eleven neutron\n(2,8,14,20,28,50,82,126,142,152,184) magic numbers. The test was performed\nanalyzing the new data from Nuclide ground states:\nhttps://www-nds.iaea.org/relnsd/NdsEnsdf/QueryForm.html, containing 3182 data\nfor A=2(1,1) to 294(118,176) and confirmed the above values of proton and\nneutron magic numbers. The accuracy of masses description is in the interval\n(-2.80,1.80) MeV. Only fourteen nuclear masses have bigger than 1.90 MeV\nresidual.\n", "  Water and hydroxyl, once thought to be found only in the primitive airless\nbodies that formed beyond roughly 2.5-3 AU, have recently been detected on the\nMoon and Vesta, which both have surfaces dominated by evolved, non-primitive\ncompositions. In both these cases, the water/OH is thought to be exogenic,\neither brought in via impacts with comets or hydrated asteroids or created via\nsolar wind interactions with silicates in the regolith or both. Such exogenic\nprocesses should also be occurring on other airless body surfaces. To test this\nhypothesis, we used the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) to measure\nreflectance spectra (2.0 to 4.1 {\\mu}m) of two large near-Earth asteroids\n(NEAs) with compositions generally interpreted as anhydrous: 433 Eros and 1036\nGanymed. OH is detected on both of these bodies in the form of absorption\nfeatures near 3 {\\mu}m. The spectra contain a component of thermal emission at\nlonger wavelengths, from which we estimate thermal of 167+/- 98 J m-2s-1/2K-1\nfor Eros (consistent with previous estimates) and 214+/- 80 J m-2s-1/2K-1 for\nGanymed, the first reported measurement of thermal inertia for this object.\nThese observations demonstrate that processes responsible for water/OH creation\non large airless bodies also act on much smaller bodies.\n", "  The most complete list of visual binary systems with known orbital elements\nis compiled. It is based on OARMAC and ORB6 data and contains 3139 orbits for\n2278 pairs. A refined subset of high quality orbits with available distance was\nalso compiled. Relations between and distributions along different\nobservational parameters are constructed, and an analysis of selection effects\nis made. Dynamical, photometric and spectral masses of systems are estimated,\nand reasons for discrepancies between them are discussed.\n", "  The structure of mirror $^{14}$C and $^{14}$O nuclei has been studied in the\nframework of the five-particle model (three $\\alpha$-particles and two\nnucleons). Interaction potentials are proposed, which allowed the energy and\nradius of $^{14}$C nucleus, as well as the energy of $^{14}$O one, to agree\nwith experimental data. On the basis of the variational approach with the use\nof Gaussian bases, the energies and wave functions for five-particle systems\nunder consideration are calculated. The charge radius of $^{14}$O nucleus, as\nwell as the charge density distributions and the form factors for both nuclei,\nare predicted.\n", "  Regularization methods are commonly used in X-ray CT image reconstruction.\nDifferent regularization methods reflect the characterization of different\nprior knowledge of images. In a recent work, a new regularization method called\na low-dimensional manifold model (LDMM) is investigated to characterize the\nlow-dimensional patch manifold structure of natural images, where the manifold\ndimensionality characterizes structural information of an image. In this paper,\nwe propose a CT image reconstruction method based on the prior knowledge of the\nlow-dimensional manifold of CT image. Using the clinical raw projection data\nfrom GE clinic, we conduct comparisons for the CT image reconstruction among\nthe proposed method, the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART)\nwith the total variation (TV) regularization, and the filtered back projection\n(FBP) method. Results show that the proposed method can successfully recover\nstructural details of an imaging object, and achieve higher spatial and\ncontrast resolution of the reconstructed image than counterparts of FBP and\nSART with TV.\n", "  In the last couple of decades, the world has seen several stunning instances\nof quantum algorithms that provably outperform the best classical algorithms.\nFor most problems, however, it is currently unknown whether quantum algorithms\ncan provide an advantage, and if so by how much, or how to design quantum\nalgorithms that realize such advantages. Many of the most challenging\ncomputational problems arising in the practical world are tackled today by\nheuristic algorithms that have not been mathematically proven to outperform\nother approaches but have been shown to be effective empirically. While quantum\nheuristic algorithms have been proposed, empirical testing becomes possible\nonly as quantum computation hardware is built. The next few years will be\nexciting as empirical testing of quantum heuristic algorithms becomes more and\nmore feasible. While large-scale universal quantum computers are likely decades\naway, special-purpose quantum computational hardware has begun to emerge that\nwill become more powerful over time, as well as some small-scale universal\nquantum computers.\n", "  The effects of copper doping on the structural and superconducting phase\ntransitions of Ba(Ni$_{1-x}$Cu$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ were studied by examining\nthe resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat. We found an abrupt\nincrease in the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\\rm c}$ from 0.6 K\nin the triclinic phase with less copper ($x$ $\\leq$ 0.16) to 2.5-3.2 K in the\ntetragonal phase with more copper ($x$ $>$ 0.16). The specific-heat data\nsuggested that doping-induced phonon softening was responsible for the enhanced\nsuperconductivity in the tetragonal phase. All of these observations exhibited\nstriking similarities to those observed in the phosphorus doping of\nBaNi$_{2}$(As$_{1-x}$P$_{x}$)$_{2}$ [K. Kudo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 109,\n097002 (2012).], which markedly contrast the behavior of phosphorus and copper\ndoping of the iron-based superconductor BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of reconstructing a small\nobject from far field measurements. The inverse problem is severally ill-posed\nbecause of the diffraction limit and low signal to noise ratio. We propose a\nnovel methodology to solve this type of inverse problems based on an idea from\nplasmonic sensing. By using the field interaction with a known plasmonic\nparticle, the fine detail information of the small object can be encoded into\nthe shift of the resonant frequencies of the two particle system in the far\nfield. In the intermediate interaction regime, we show that this information is\nexactly the generalized polarization tensors associated with the small object,\nfrom which one can perform the reconstruction. Our theoretical findings are\nsupplemented by a variety of numerical results. The results in the paper also\nprovide a mathematical foundation for plasmonic sensing.\n", "  We discuss several geometric features of a Kummer surface associated with a\n(1,2)-polarized abelian surface defined over the field of complex numbers. In\nparticular, we show that any such Kummer surface can be modeled as the double\ncover of the projective plane branched along six lines, three of which meet a\ncommon point. The proof uses certain explicit pencils of plane quartic\nbielliptic genus-three curves whose associated Prym varieties are naturally\n(1,2)-polarized abelian surfaces.\n", "  In this paper we propose an analytical method to calculate the band\nstructures of graphene-like nanoribbons of the armchair type with arbitrary\nline defects or uniaxial strains. The model is based on the tight-binding model\nand the standing wave assumption for the armchair nanoribbons. It gives\naccurate band results for large supercell systems. Within this method, we\nanalyze different local states near the line defect in the graphene and\nboron-nitride nanoribbons. We also derive the analytical expression for the\nlocal states in a semi-infinite graphene nanoribbon by this method and the\ntransfer matrix technique. The criteria condition for the local states in the\nsemi-infinite nanoribbons is also given.\n", "  In this paper, we review the discrete Hamilton--Jacobi theory from a\ngeometric point of view. In the discrete realm, the usual geometric\ninterpretation of the Hamilton--Jacobi theory in terms of vector fields is not\nstraightforward.\n  Here, we propose two alternative interpretations: one is the interpretation\nin terms of projective flows, the second is the temptative of constructing a\ndiscrete Hamiltonian vector field renacting the usual continuous\ninterpretation.\n  Both interpretations are proven to be equivalent and applied in optimal\ncontrol theory. The solutions achieved through both approaches are sorted out\nand compared by numerical computation.\n", "  We investigate the generation of optical frequency combs through a cascade of\nfour-wave mixing processes in nonlinear fibres with optimised parameters. The\ninitial optical field consists of two continuous-wave lasers with frequency\nseparation larger than 40 GHz (312.7 pm at 1531 nm). It propagates through\nthree nonlinear fibres. The first fibre serves to pulse shape the initial\nsinusoidal-square pulse, while a strong pulse compression down to sub-100 fs\ntakes place in the second fibre which is an amplifying erbium-doped fibre. The\nlast stage is a low-dispersion highly nonlinear fibre where the frequency comb\nbandwidth is increased and the line intensity is equalised. We model this\nsystem using the generalised nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and investigate\nit in terms of fibre lengths, fibre dispersion, laser frequency separation and\ninput powers with the aim to minimise the frequency comb noise. With the\nsupport of the numerical results, a frequency comb is experimentally generated,\nfirst in the near infra-red and then it is frequency-doubled into the visible\nspectral range. Using a MUSE-type spectrograph, we evaluate the comb\nperformance for astronomical wavelength calibration in terms of equidistancy of\nthe comb lines and their stability.\n", "  We propose a fibre-based approach for generation of optical frequency combs\n(OFCs) with the aim of calibration of astronomical spectrographs in the low and\nmedium-resolution range. This approach includes two steps: in the first step,\nan appropriate state of optical pulses is generated and subsequently moulded in\nthe second step delivering the desired OFC. More precisely, the first step is\nrealised by injection of two continuous-wave (CW) lasers into a conventional\nsingle-mode fibre, whereas the second step generates a broad OFC by using the\noptical solitons generated in step one as initial condition. We investigate the\nconversion of a bichromatic input wave produced by two initial CW lasers into a\ntrain of optical solitons, which happens in the fibre used as step one.\nEspecially, we are interested in the soliton content of the pulses created in\nthis fibre. For that, we study different initial conditions (a single\ncosine-hump, an Akhmediev breather, and a deeply modulated bichromatic wave) by\nmeans of soliton radiation beat analysis and compare the results to draw\nconclusion about the soliton content of the state generated in the first step.\nIn case of a deeply modulated bichromatic wave, we observed the formation of a\ncollective soliton crystal for low input powers and the appearance of separated\nsolitons for high input powers. An intermediate state showing the features of\nboth, the soliton crystal and the separated solitons, turned out to be most\nsuitable for the generation of OFC for the purpose of calibration of\nastronomical spectrographs.\n", "  One of the main goals in the study of quantum nonlocality is to determine the\nmaximum violation achieved by quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. However,\ngiven a Bell inequality, there is no general algorithm to perform this task. As\nan intermediate step, the development of efficiently computable bounds has\nplayed an important role for the advance of the field. In this thesis we phrase\nthe problem of determining the quantum value of a Bell expression in the\nframework of computational complexity. Then we present our contributions\nexploring efficiently computable bounds (based on the spectral norm of some\nmatrices) to the quantum value of a particular class of Bell inequalities: the\nlinear games. We derive several results for the bipartite and the multipartite\nscenarios.\n", "  The four-layered F/S/F$'$/S$'$ nanostructure consisting of rather dirty\nsuperconducting (S) and ferromagnetic (F) metals is studied within the theory\nof the proximity effect taking detailed account of the boundary conditions. The\nF/S structures with four F and S layers are shown to have considerably richer\nphysics than the F/S/F trilayer (due to the interplay between the 0 and $\\pi$\nphase superconductivity and the 0 and $\\pi$ phase magnetism) and even the F/S\nsuperlattices. The extra $\\pi $ phase superconducting states obtained for the\nfour-layered F/S/F$^{\\prime }$/S$^{\\prime }$ system are found to be different\nfrom the known \"superlattice\" states. The dependence of the critical\ntemperatures versus the F layers thicknesses is investigated. An optimal set of\nparameters is determined, for which the difference between the critical\ntemperatures for different states becomes significant, and the corresponding\nphase diagrams are plotted. It is proven that this system can have different\ncritical temperatures for different S and S$'$ layers. A conceptual scheme of a\ncontrol device with superconducting and magnetic recording channels that can be\ncontrolled separately using a weak external magnetic field is proposed on the\nbasis of the F/S/F$'$/S$'$ nanostructure. The devices with four, five, six, and\nseven different states are explored.\n", "  We obtain analytic solutions of a generalised Grad-Shafranov equation\ndescribing steady states with incompressible plasma flow of arbitrary\ndirection, toroidal current reversal and either nested or non-nested magnetic\nsurfaces. It turns out that the component of the flow velocity non parallel to\nthe magnetic field can result in normal equilibria with central\ncurrent-reversal, i.e. equilibria with nested magnetic surfaces and\nmonotonically varying pressure profiles.\n", "  High quality Au/hBN/Au tunnel devices are fabricated using transferred\natomically thin hexagonal boron nitride as the tunneling barrier. All tunnel\njunctions show tunneling resistance on the order of several\nk$\\Omega$/$\\mu$m$^{2}$. Ohmic I-V curves at small bias with no signs of\nresonances indicate the sparsity of defects. Tunneling current shot noise is\nmeasured in these devices, and the excess shot noise shows consistency with\ntheoretical expectations. These results show that atomically thin hBN is an\nexcellent tunnel barrier, especially for the study of shot noise properties,\nand this can enable the study of tunneling density of states and shot noise\nspectroscopy in more complex systems.\n"]}
