The design of an\nexperimentally feasible quantum processor must draw upon results in multiple\nfields; from experimental efforts in system control and fabrication through to\nfar more abstract areas such as quantum algorithms and error correction.\nRecently, the adaptation of topological coding models to physical systems in\noptics has illustrated a possible long term pathway to truly large scale QIP.\nAs the topological model has well defined protocols for Quantum Error\nCorrection (QEC) built in as part of its construction, a more grounded analysis\nof the {\\em classical} processing requirements is possible. In this paper we\nanalyze the requirements for a classical processing system, designed\nspecifically for the topological cluster state model. We demonstrate that via\nextensive parallelization, the construction of a classical \"front-end\" system\ncapable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is\npossible today.\n", "  Noise of stochastic processes whose power spectrum scales at low frequencies,\n$f$, as $1/f$ appears in such diverse systems that it is considered universal.\nHowever, there have been a small number of instances from completely unrelated\nfields, e.g., the fluctuations of the human heartbeat or vortices in\nsuperconductors, in which power spectra have been observed to cross over from a\n$1/f$ to a non-$1/f$ behavior at even lower frequencies. Here, we show that\nsuch crossover must be universal, and can be accounted for by the memory of\ninitial conditions and the relaxation processes present in any physical system.\nWhen the smallest frequency allowed by the experimental observation time,\n$\\omega_{obs}$, is larger than the smallest relaxation frequency,\n$\\Omega_{min}$, a $1/f$ power spectral density is obtained. Conversely, when\n$\\omega_{obs}<\\Omega_{min}$ we predict that the power spectrum of any\nstochastic process should exhibit a crossover from $1/f$ to a different,\nintegrable functional form provided there is enough time for experimental\nobservations. This crossover also provides a convenient tool to measure the\nlowest relaxation frequency of a physical system.\n", "  The skill of seasonal precipitation forecasts is assessed worldwide -grid\npoint by grid point- for the forty-years period 1961-2000. To this aim, the\nENSEMBLES multi-model hindcast is considered. Although predictability varies\nwith region, season and lead-time, results indicate that 1) significant skill\nis mainly located in the tropics -20 to 40% of the total land areas-, 2)\noverall, SON (MAM) is the most (less) skillful season and 3) predictability\ndoes not decrease noticeably from one to four months lead-time -this is so\nespecially in northern south America and the Malay archipelago, which seem to\nbe the most skillful regions of the world-. An analysis of teleconnections\nrevealed that most of the skillful zones exhibit significant teleconnections\nwith El Ni\\~no. Furthermore, models are shown to reproduce similar\nteleconnection patterns to those observed, especially in SON -with spatial\ncorrelations of around 0.6 in the tropics-. Moreover, these correlations are\nsystematically higher for the skillful areas. Our results indicate that the\nskill found might be determined to a great extent by the models' ability to\nproperly reproduce the observed El Ni\\~no teleconnections, i.e., the better a\nmodel simulates the El Ni\\~no teleconnections, the higher its performance is.\n", "  This is an extended and corrected version of lecture notes originally written\nfor a one semester course at Leibniz University Hannover. The main aim of the\nnotes is to give an introduction to the mathematical methods used in describing\ndiscrete quantum systems consisting of infinitely many sites. Such systems can\nbe used, for example, to model the materials in condensed matter physics. The\nnotes provide the necessary background material to access recent literature in\nthe field. Some of these recent results are also discussed.\n  The contents are roughly as follows: (1) quick recap of essentials from\nfunctional analysis, (2) introduction to operator algebra, (3) algebraic\nquantum mechanics, (4) infinite systems (quasilocal algebra), (5) KMS and\nground states, (6) Lieb-Robinson bounds, (7) algebraic quantum field theory,\n(8) superselection sectors of the toric code, (9) Haag-Ruelle scattering theory\nin spin systems, (10) applications to gapped phases.\n  The level is aimed at students who have at least had some exposure to\n(functional) analysis and have a certain mathematical \"maturity\".\n", "  In this paper, we discuss two simple parametrization methods for calculating\nAdomian polynomials for several nonlinear operators, which utilize the\northogonality of functions einx, where n is an integer. Some important\nproperties of Adomian polynomials are also discussed and illustrated with\nexamples. These methods require minimum computation, are easy to implement, and\nare extended to multivariable case also. Examples of different forms of\nnonlinearity, which includes the one involved in the Navier Stokes equation, is\nconsidered. Explicit expression for the n-th order Adomian polynomials are\nobtained in most of the examples.\n", "  In this paper, we identify a radically new viewpoint on the collective\nbehaviour of groups of intelligent agents. We first develop a highly general\nabstract model for the possible future lives that these agents may encounter as\na result of their decisions. In the context of these possible futures, we show\nthat the causal entropic principle, whereby agents follow behavioural rules\nthat maximise their entropy over all paths through the future, predicts many of\nthe observed features of social interactions between individuals in both human\nand animal groups. Our results indicate that agents are often able to maximise\ntheir future path entropy by remaining cohesive as a group, and that this\ncohesion leads to collectively intelligent outcomes that depend strongly on the\ndistribution of the number of future paths that are possible. We derive social\ninteraction rules that are consistent with maximum-entropy group behaviour for\nboth discrete and continuous decision spaces. Our analysis further predicts\nthat social interactions are likely to be fundamentally based on Weber's law of\nresponse to proportional stimuli, supporting many studies that find a\nneurological basis for this stimulus-response mechanism, and providing a novel\nbasis for the common assumption of linearly additive 'social forces' in\nsimulation studies of collective behaviour.\n", "  We consider the scattering of lightlike matter in the presence of a heavy\nscalar object (such as the Sun or a Schwarzschild black hole). By treating\ngeneral relativity as an effective field theory we directly compute the\nnonanalytic components of the one-loop gravitational amplitude for the\nscattering of massless scalars or photons from an external massive scalar\nfield. These results allow a semiclassical computation of the bending angle for\nlight rays grazing the Sun, including long-range $\\hbar$ contributions. We\ndiscuss implications of this computation, in particular the violation of some\nclassical formulations of the equivalence principle.\n", "  The study of neutron rich matter, present in neutron star, proto-neutron\nstars and core-collapse supernovae, can lead to further understanding of the\nbehavior of nuclear matter in highly asymmetric nuclei. Heterogeneous\nstructures are expected to exist in these systems, often referred to as nuclear\npasta. We have carried out a systematic study of neutrino opacity for different\nthermodynamic conditions in order to assess the impact that the structure has\non it. We studied the dynamics of the neutrino opacity of the heterogeneous\nmatter at different thermodynamic conditions with semiclassical molecular\ndynamics model already used to study nuclear multifragmentation. For different\ndensities, proton fractions and temperature, we calculate the very long range\nopacity and the cluster distribution. The neutrino opacity is of crucial\nimportance for the evolution of the core-collapse supernovae and the neutrino\nscattering.\n", "  We demonstrated a large enhancement of Kerr electro-optic nonlinearity\nthrough cascaded Pockels effects in a domain inversion ferroelectric crystal.\nWe designed a structure that can implement the cascaded Pockels effects and\nsecond-harmonic generation simultaneously. The energy coupling between the\nfundamental lights of different polarizations led to a large nonlinear phase\nshift, and thus an effective electro-optic nonlinear refractive index. The\neffective nonlinearity can be either positive or negative, causing the\nsecond-harmonic spectra to move towards the coupling center, which in turn,\noffered us a way to measure the effective electro-optic nonlinear refractive\nindex. The corresponding enhanced Kerr electro-optic nonlinearity is more than\nthree orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic value. These results open a\ndoor to manipulate the nonlinear phase by applying external electric field\ninstead of light intensity in noncentrosymmetric crystals.\n", "  Characterizing quantum correlations in terms of information-theoretic\nprinciples is a popular chapter of quantum foundations. Traditionally, the\nprinciples adopted for this scope have been expressed in terms of conditional\nprobability distributions, specifying the probability that a black box produces\na certain output upon receiving a certain input. This framework is known as\n\"device-independent\". Another major chapter of quantum foundations is the\ninformation-theoretic characterization of quantum theory, with its sets of\nstates and measurements, and with its allowed dynamics. The different\nframeworks adopted for this scope are known under the umbrella term \"general\nprobabilistic theories\". With only a few exceptions, the two programmes on\ncharacterizing quantum correlations and characterizing quantum theory have so\nfar proceeded on separate tracks, each one developing its own methods and its\nown agenda. This paper aims at bridging the gap, by comparing the two\nframeworks and illustrating how the two programmes can benefit each other.\n", "  The equations of secular evolution for dust grains in mean motion resonances\nwith a planet are solved for stationary points. This is done including both\nPoynting-Robertson effect and stellar wind. The solutions are stationary in\nsemimajor axis, eccentricity, and resonant angle, but allow the pericentre to\nadvance. The semimajor axis of stationary solutions can be slightly shifted\nfrom the exact resonant value. The periodicity of the stationary solutions in a\nreference frame orbiting with the planet is analytically proved. The existence\nof periodic solutions in mean motion resonances means that analytical theory\nenables for dust particles also infinitely long capture times. The stationary\nsolutions are periodic motions to which the eccentricity asymptotically\napproaches and around which the libration occurs.\n  Using numerical integration of equation of motion are successfully found\ninitial conditions corresponding to the stationary solutions. Numerically and\nanalytically determined shifts of the semimajor axis form the exact resonance\nfor the stationary solutions are in excellent agreement.\n  The stationary solutions can be plotted by locations of pericenters in the\nreference frame orbiting with the planet. The pericenters are distributed in\nthe space according to properties of dust particles.\n", "  We demonstrated a tunable temporal gap based on simultaneous fast and slow\nlight in electro-optic photonic crystals. The light experiences an anomalous\ndispersion near the transmission center and a normal dispersion away from the\ncenter, where it can be accelerated and slowed down, respectively. We also\nobtained the switch between fast and slow light by adjusting the external\nelectric filed. The observed largest temporal gap is 541 ps, which is crucial\nin practical event operation inside the gap. The results offer a new solution\nfor temporal cloak.\n", "  A thin anisotropic elastic plate clamped along its lateral side and also\nsupported at a small area $\\theta_{h}$ of one base is considered; the diameter\nof $\\theta_{h}$ is of the same order as the plate relative thickness $h\\ll1$.\nIn addition to the standard Kirchhoff model with the Sobolev point condition, a\nthree-dimensional boundary layer is investigated in the vicinity of the support\n$\\theta_{h}$, which with the help of the derived weighted inequality of Korn's\ntype, will provide an error estimate with the bound $ch^{1/2}|\\ln h|$. Ignoring\nthis boundary layer effect reduces the precision order down to $|\\ln\nh|^{-1/2}$.\n", "  From the expression for the electromagnetic field in the neighborhood of a\npoint charge we determine the rate of electromagnetic momentum flow, calculated\nusing the Maxwell stress tensor, across a surface surrounding the charge. From\nthat we derive for a `point charge' the radiation reaction formula, which turns\nout to be proportional to the first time-derivative of the acceleration of the\ncharge, identical to the expression for the self-force, hitherto obtained in\nthe literature from the detailed mutual interaction between constituents of a\nsmall charged sphere. We then use relativistic transformations to arrive at a\ngeneralized formula for radiation reaction for a point charge undergoing a\nrelativistic motion.\n", "  It was recently observed in \\cite{Park:2014tia} that the holographic nature\nof gravity may hold a key to quantization of gravity. The so-called\n\"holographic quantization\" has been carried out in\n\\cite{Park:2014noa,Park:2015ota} for Einstein gravity in a flat background.\nGeneralizing the procedure to a curved background is the main goal of the\npresent work. In particular, we consider the Einstein action expanded around a\nSchwarzschild background\n", "  We study the effect of noise on the renormalizability of a specific\nreaction-diffusion system of equations describing a cubic autocatalytic\nchemical reaction. The noise we are using is gaussian with power-law\ncorrelations in space, characterized by an amplitude $A$ and a noise exponent\n$y$. We show that changing the noise exponent is equivalent to the substitution\n$d_{s} \\rightarrow d_{\\rm eff} = d_{s} - y$ and thus modifies the divergence\nstructure of loop integrals ($d_{s}$ is the dimension of space). The model is\nrenormalizable at one-loop for $d_{\\rm eff} < 6$ and nonrenormalizable for\n$d_{\\rm eff} \\geq 6$. The effects of noise-generated higher order interactions\nare discussed. In particular, we show how noise induces new interaction terms\nthat can be interpreted as a manifestation of some (internal) \"chemical\nmechanism\". We also show how ideas of effective field theory can be applied to\nconstruct a more fundamental chemical model for this system.\n", "  An algorithm to compute efficiently the first two derivatives of (very) large\nmultideterminant wavefunctions for quantum Monte Carlo calculations is\npresented. The calculation of determinants and their derivatives is performed\nusing the Sherman-Morrison formula for updating the inverse Slater matrix. An\nimproved implementation based on the reduction of the number of column\nsubstitutions and on a very efficient implementation of the calculation of the\nscalar products involved is presented. It is emphasized that multideterminant\nexpansions contain in general a large number of identical spin-specific\ndeterminants: for typical configuration interaction-type wavefunctions the\nnumber of unique spin-specific determinants $N_{\\rm det}^\\sigma$\n($\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow$) with a non-negligible weight in the expansion is\nof order ${\\cal O}(\\sqrt{N_{\\rm det}})$. We show that a careful implementation\nof the calculation of the $N_{\\rm det}$-dependent contributions can make this\nstep negligible enough so that in practice the algorithm scales as the total\nnumber of unique spin-specific determinants, $\\; N_{\\rm det}^\\uparrow + N_{\\rm\ndet}^\\downarrow$, over a wide range of total number of determinants (here,\n$N_{\\rm det}$ up to about one million), thus greatly reducing the total\ncomputational cost. Finally, a new truncation scheme for the multideterminant\nexpansion is proposed so that larger expansions can be considered without\nincreasing the computational time. The algorithm is illustrated with\nall-electron Fixed-Node Diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the total energy\nof the chlorine atom. Calculations using a trial wavefunction including about\n750 000 determinants with a computational increase of $\\sim$ 400 compared to a\nsingle-determinant calculation are shown to be feasible.\n", "  The position of a colloidal particle trapped in an external field thermally\nfluctuates at equilibrium. As is well known, the ambient fluid is not a simple\nheat bath and the particle mass appears to increase, which influences the mean\nsquare velocity of the particle. In this study, we suppose that the particle is\nsurrounded by a binary fluid mixture in the homogeneous phase near, but not too\nclose to, the critical point. Usually, one component is preferably attracted by\nthe particle surface, and the resultant adsorption layer becomes significant\nbecause of the near-criticality. When the particle fluctuates in this\nsituation, its mean square displacement should also be influenced by the\nambient fluid because the adsorption layer does not follow the particle motion\ntotally. We calculate the influence in a simple case, where a rigid spherical\nparticle fluctuates with a small amplitude and its surface attracts one\ncomponent weakly. We utilize the hydrodynamics in the limit of no dissipation\nto examine the contribution from the ambient mixture to the equal-time\ncorrelation, which is shown to be reduced by an additional stress, including\nosmotic pressure.\n", "  We discuss the approximate inclusion of three-nucleon interactions into ab\ninitio nuclear structure calculations using a multi-reference formulation of\nnormal ordering and Wick's theorem. Following the successful application of\nsingle-reference normal ordering for the study of ground states of closed-shell\nnuclei, e.g., in coupled-cluster theory, multi-reference normal ordering opens\na path to open-shell nuclei and excited states. Based on different\nmulti-determinantal reference states we benchmark the truncation of the\nnormal-ordered Hamiltonian at the two-body level in no-core shell-model\ncalculations for p-shell nuclei, including 6-Li, 12-C, and 10-B. We find that\nthis multi-reference normal-ordered two-body approximation is able to capture\nthe effects of the 3N interaction with sufficient accuracy, both, for\nground-state and excitation energies, at the computational cost of a two-body\nHamiltonian. It is robust with respect to the choice of reference states and\nhas a multitude of applications in ab initio nuclear structure calculations of\nopen-shell nuclei and their excitations as well as in nuclear reaction studies.\n", "  We study the matter bispectrum of large-scale structure by comparing the\npredictions of different perturbative and phenomenological models with the full\nthree-dimensional bispectrum from $N$-body simulations estimated using modal\nmethods. We show that among the perturbative approaches, effective field theory\nsucceeds in extending the range of validity furthest on intermediate scales, at\nthe cost of free additional parameters. By studying the halo model, we show\nthat although it is satisfactory in the deeply non-linear regime, it predicts a\ndeficit of power on intermediate scales, worsening at redshifts $z>0$. By\ncomparison with the $N$-body bispectrum on those scales, we show that there is\na significant squeezed component underestimated in the halo model. On the basis\nof these results, we propose a new three-shape model, based on the tree-level,\nsqueezed and constant bispectrum shapes we identified in the halo model; after\ncalibration this fits the simulations on all scales and redshifts of interest.\nWe extend this model further to primordial non-Gaussianity of the local and\nequilateral types by showing that the same shapes can be used to describe the\nadditional non-Gaussian component in the matter bispectrum. This method\nprovides a HALOFIT-like prototype of the bispectrum that could be used to\ndescribe and test parameter dependencies and should be relevant for the\nbispectrum of weak gravitational lensing and wider applications.\n", "  The phenomenological relativistic quark model (RQM) has been employed to\nobtain the masses of ground state pseudo scalar and vector $c\\bar{b}$ states.\nIn the frame work of RQM a study of M1 radiative decays of $c\\bar{b}$ has been\nmade. The Hamiltonian used in the investigation has confinement potential and\nconfined one gluon exchange potential (COGEP). An overall agreement is obtained\nwith the experimental masses and decay widths. Calculated values are compared\nwith other theoretical models.\n", "  We study the geometry of infinite random Boltzmann planar maps with vertices\nof high degree. These correspond to the duals of the Boltzmann maps associated\nto a critical weight sequence $(q_{k})_{ k \\geq 0}$ for the faces with\npolynomial decay $k^{-a}$ with $a \\in ( 3/2, 5/2)$ which have been studied by\nLe Gall & Miermont as well as by Borot, Bouttier & Guitter. We show the\nexistence of a phase transition for the geometry of these maps at $a = 2$. In\nthe dilute phase corresponding to $a \\in (2, 5/2)$ we prove that the volume of\nthe ball of radius $r$ (for the graph distance) is of order $r^{\\mathsf{d}}$\nwith $\\mathsf{d}= (a-1/2)/(a-2)$, and we provide distributional scaling limits\nfor the volume and perimeter process. In the dense phase corresponding to $a\n\\in (3/2,2)$ the volume of the ball of radius $r$ is exponential in $r$. We\nalso study the first-passage percolation (FPP) distance with exponential edge\nweights and show in particular that in the dense phase the FPP distance between\nthe origin and infinity is finite. The latter implies in addition that the\nrandom lattices in the dense phase are transient. The proofs rely on the recent\npeeling process introduced in arXiv:1506.01590 and use ideas of arXiv:1412.5509\nin the dilute phase.\n", "  We study the logarithmic negativity and the moments of the partial transpose\nin the ground state of a two dimensional massless harmonic square lattice with\nnearest neighbour interactions for various configurations of adjacent domains.\nAt leading order for large domains, the logarithmic negativity and the\nlogarithm of the ratio between the generic moment of the partial transpose and\nthe moment of the reduced density matrix at the same order satisfy an area law\nin terms of the length of the curve shared by the adjacent regions. We give\nnumerical evidences that the coefficient of the area law term in these\nquantities is related to the coefficient of the area law term in the R\\'enyi\nentropies. Whenever the curve shared by the adjacent domains contains vertices,\na subleading logarithmic term occurs in these quantities and the numerical\nvalues of the corner function for some pairs of angles are obtained. In the\nspecial case of vertices corresponding to explementary angles, we provide\nnumerical evidence that the corner function of the logarithmic negativity is\ngiven by the corner function of the R\\'enyi entropy of order 1/2.\n", "  We compute the production of thermal photons in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions by gluon fusion in the presence of an intense magnetic field, and\nduring the early stages of the reaction. This photon yield is an excess over\ncalculations that do not consider magnetic field effects. We add this excess to\nrecent hydrodynamic calculations that are close to describing the experimental\ntransverse momentum distribution in RHIC and LHC. We then show that with\nreasonable values for the temperature, magnetic field strength, and strong\ncoupling constant, our results provide a very good description of such excess.\nThese results support the idea that the origin of at least some of the photon\nexcess observed in heavy-ion experiments may arise from magnetic field induced\nprocesses.\n", "  It is well known that inversion symmetry in one-dimensional (1D) systems\nleads to the quantization of the geometric Zak phase to values of either 0 or\n{\\pi}. When the system has particle-hole symmetry, this topological property\nensures the existence of zero-energy interface states at the interface of two\nbulk systems carrying different Zak phases. In the absence of inversion\nsymmetry, the Zak phase can take any value and the existence of interface\nstates is not ensured. We show here that the situation is different when the\nunit cell contains multiple degrees of freedom and a hidden inversion symmetry\nexists in a subspace of the system. As an example, we consider a system of two\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains coupled by a coupler chain. Although the\nintroduction of coupler chain breaks the inversion symmetry of the system, a\ncertain hidden inversion symmetry ensures the existence of a decoupled\n$2\\times2$ SSH Hamiltonian in the subspace of the entire system and the two\nbands associated with this subspace have quantized Zak phases. These\n\"quantized\" bands in turn can provide topological boundary or interface states\nin such systems. Since the entire system has no inversion symmetry, the\nbulk-boundary correspondence may not hold exactly. The above is also true when\nnext-nearest-neighbor hoppings are included. Our systems can be realized\nstraightforwardly in systems such as coupled single-mode optical waveguides or\ncoupled acoustic cavities.\n", "  Despite decades of work, gaining a first-principle understanding of amorphous\nmaterials remains an extremely challenging problem. However, recent theoretical\nbreakthroughs have led to the formulation of an exact solution in the\nmean-field limit of infinite spatial dimension, and numerical simulations have\nremarkably confirmed the dimensional robustness of some of the predictions.\nThis review describes these latest advances. More specifically, we consider the\ndynamical and thermodynamic descriptions of hard spheres around the dynamical,\nGardner and jamming transitions. Comparing mean-field predictions with the\nfinite-dimensional simulations, we identify robust aspects of the description\nand uncover its more sensitive features. We conclude with a brief overview of\nongoing research.\n", "  Black Phosphorus (BP) has gained renewed attention due to its singular\nanisotropic electronic and optical properties that might be exploited for a\nwide range of technological applications. In this respect, the thermal\nproperties are particularly important both to predict its room temperature\noperation and to determine its thermoelectric potential. From this point of\nview, one of the most spectacular and poorly understood phenomena is, indeed,\nthe BP temperature-induced band-gap opening: when temperature is increased the\nfundamental band-gap increases instead of decreasing. This anomalous thermal\ndependence has also been observed, recently, in its monolayer counterpart. In\nthis work, based on \\textit{ab-initio} calculations, we present an explanation\nfor this long known, and yet not fully explained, effect. We show that it\narises from a combination of harmonic and lattice thermal expansion\ncontributions, which are, in fact, highly interwined. We clearly narrow down\nthe mechanisms that cause this gap opening by identifying the peculiar atomic\nvibrations that drive the anomaly. The final picture we give explains both the\nBP anomalous band-gap opening and the frequency increase with increasing volume\n(tension effect).\n", "  Cloud imaging using ground-based whole sky imagers is essential for a\nfine-grained understanding of the effects of cloud formations, which can be\nuseful in many applications. Some such imagers are available commercially, but\ntheir cost is relatively high, and their flexibility is limited. Therefore, we\nbuilt a new daytime Whole Sky Imager (WSI) called Wide Angle High-Resolution\nSky Imaging System. The strengths of our new design are its simplicity, low\nmanufacturing cost and high resolution. Our imager captures the entire\nhemisphere in a single high-resolution picture via a digital camera using a\nfish-eye lens. The camera was modified to capture light across the visible as\nwell as the near-infrared spectral ranges. This paper describes the design of\nthe device as well as the geometric and radiometric calibration of the imaging\nsystem.\n", "  We propose to reformulate the payoff matrix structure of Prisoner's Dilemma\nGame, by introducing threat and greed factors, and show their effect on the\nco-evolution of memory and cooperation. Our findings are as follows. (i) Memory\nprotects cooperation. (ii) To our surprise, greater memory size is unfavorable\nto evolutionary success when there is no threat. In the absence of threat,\nsubsequent generations lose their memory and are consequently invaded by\ndefectors. (iii) In contrast, the presence of an appropriate level of threat\ntriggers the emergence of a self-protection mechanism for cooperation, which\nmanifests itself as an increase in memory size within subsequent generations.\nOn the evolutionary level, memory size acts like an immune response of the\ngenerations against aggressive defection. (iv) Even more extreme threat results\nagain in defection. Our findings boil down to the following: The dose of the\nthreat makes the resistance for cooperation.\n", "  The existence of localized electromagnetic structures is discussed in the\nframework of the 1-dimensional relativistic Maxwell-fluid model for a cold\nplasma with immobile ions. New partially localized solutions are found with a\nfinite-difference algorithm designed to locate numerically exact solutions of\nthe Maxwell-fluid system. These solutions are called quasi-solitons and consist\nof a localized electromagnetic wave trapped in a spatially extended electron\nplasma wave. They are organized in families characterized by the number of\nnodes $p$ of the vector potential and exist in a continuous range of parameters\nin the $\\omega-V$ plane, where $V$ is the velocity of propagation and $\\omega$\nis the vector potential angular frequency. A parametric study shows that the\nfamiliar fully localized relativistic solitons are special members of the\nfamilies of partially localized quasi-solitons. Soliton solution branches with\n$p>1$ are therefore parametrically embedded in the continuum of quasi-solitons.\nOn the other hand, geometric arguments and numerical simulations indicate that\n$p=0$ solitons exist only in the limit of either small amplitude or vanishing\nvelocity. Direct numerical simulations of the Maxwell-fluid model indicate that\nthe $p>0$ quasi-solitons (and embedded solitons) are unstable and lead to wake\nexcitation, while $p=0$ quasi-solitons appear stable. This helps explain the\nubiquitous observation of structures that resemble $p=0$ solitons in numerical\nsimulations of laser-plasma interaction.\n", "  We calculate all major differential distributions with stable top-quarks at\nthe LHC. The calculation covers the multi-TeV range that will be explored\nduring LHC Run II and beyond. Our results are in the form of high-quality\nbinned distributions. We offer predictions based on three different parton\ndistribution function (pdf) sets. In the near future we will make our results\navailable also in the more flexible fastNLO format that allows fast\nre-computation with any other pdf set. In order to be able to extend our\ncalculation into the multi-TeV range we have had to derive a set of dynamic\nscales. Such scales are selected based on the principle of fastest perturbative\nconvergence applied to the differential and inclusive cross-section. Many\nobservations from our study are likely to be applicable and useful to other\nprecision processes at the LHC. With scale uncertainty now under good control,\npdfs arise as the leading source of uncertainty for TeV top production. Based\non our findings, true precision in the boosted regime will likely only be\npossible after new and improved pdf sets appear. We expect that LHC top-quark\ndata will play an important role in this process.\n", "  Statistical mechanics of infinite avalanches is studied in the framework of\nnonequilibrium random-field Ising model. Critical behavior of the model on a\nrandom graph (dilute Bethe lattice) is analyzed in detail. We show that sites\nwith a minimum coordination number 4 play a key role in the occurrence of\ninfinite avalanches. Earlier results which did not seem to fit together very\nwell are explained.\n", "  A measurement of the number of $J/\\psi$ events collected with the BESIII\ndetector in 2009 and 2012 is performed using inclusive decays of the $J/\\psi$ .\nThe number of $J/\\psi$ events taken in 2009 is recalculated to be\n$(223.7\\pm1.4)\\times 10^6$, which is in good agreement with the previous\nmeasurement, but with significantly improved precision due to improvements in\nthe BESIII software. The number of $J/\\psi$ events taken in 2012 is determined\nto be $(1086.9\\pm 6.0)\\times 10^6$. In total, the number of $J/\\psi$ events\ncollected with the BESIII detector is measured to be $(1310.6\\pm 7.0)\\times\n10^6$, where the uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects and the\nstatistical uncertainty is negligible.\n", "  Should we expect most habitable planets to share the Earth's marbled\nappearance? For a planetary surface to boast extensive areas of both land and\nwater, a delicate balance must be struck between the volume of water it retains\nand the capacity of its perturbations. These two quantities may show\nsubstantial variability across the full spectrum of water-bearing worlds. This\nwould suggest that, barring strong feedback effects, most surfaces are heavily\ndominated by either water or land. Why is the Earth so finely poised? To\naddress this question we construct a simple model for the selection bias that\nwould arise within an ensemble of surface conditions. Based on the Earth's\nocean coverage of 71%, we find substantial evidence (Bayes factor K ~ 6)\nsupporting the hypothesis that anthropic selection effects are at work.\nFurthermore, due to the Earth's proximity to the waterworld limit, this model\npredicts that most habitable planets are dominated by oceans spanning over 90%\nof their surface area (95% credible interval). This scenario, in which the\nEarth has a much greater land area than most habitable planets, is consistent\nwith results from numerical simulations and could help explain the apparently\nlow-mass transition in the mass-radius relation.\n", "  A quantitative characterization of the relationship between molecular\nsequence and structure is essential to improve our understanding of how\nfunction emerges. This particular genotype-phenotype map has been often studied\nin the context of RNA sequences, with the folded configurations standing as a\nproxy for the phenotype. Here, we count the secondary structures of circular\nRNAs of length $n$ and calculate the asymptotic distributions of different\nstructural moieties, such as stems or hairpin loops, by means of symbolic\ncombinatorics. Circular RNAs differ in essential ways from their linear\ncounterparts. From the mathematical viewpoint, the enumeration of the\ncorresponding secondary structures demands the use of combinatorial techniques\nadditional to those used for linear RNAs. The asymptotic number of secondary\nstructures for circular RNAs grows as $a^nn^{-5/2}$, with a depending on\nparticular constraints applied to the secondary structure. The abundance of any\nstructural moiety is normally distributed in the limit $n\\to\\infty$, with a\nmean and a variance that increase linearly with $n$.\n", "  Several aspects of the recently proposed DMC-CIPSI approach consisting in\nusing selected Configuration Interaction (SCI) approaches such as CIPSI\n(Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection done Iteratively) to\nbuild accurate nodes for diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations are presented\nand discussed. The main ideas are illustrated with a number of calculations for\ndiatomics molecules and for the benchmark G1 set.\n", "  We consider the generalizations of the free U(N) and O(N) scalar conformal\nfield theories to actions with higher powers of the Laplacian box^k, in general\ndimension d. We study the spectra, Verma modules, anomalies and OPE of these\ntheories. We argue that in certain d and k, the spectrum contains zero norm\noperators which are both primary and descendant, as well as extension operators\nwhich are neither primary nor descendant. In addition, we argue that in even\ndimensions d <= 2k, there are well-defined operator algebras which are related\nto the box^k theories and are novel in that they have a finite number of\nsingle-trace states.\n", "  Semiconductor compounds are widely used for water splitting applications,\nwhere photo-generated electron-hole pairs are exploited to induce catalysis.\nRecently, powders of a metallic oxide (Sr$_{1-x}$NbO$_3$, 0.03 < x < 0.20) have\nshown competitive photocatalytic efficiency, opening up the material space\navailable for finding optimizing performance in water-splitting applications.\nThe origin of the visible light absorption in these powders was reported to be\ndue to an interband transition and the charge carrier separation was proposed\nto be due to the high carrier mobility of this material. In the current work we\nhave prepared epitaxial thin films of Sr$_{0.94}$NbO$_{3+{\\delta}}$ and found\nthat the bandgap of this material is ~4.1 eV, which is very large. Surprisingly\nthe carrier density of the conducting phase reaches 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$, which\nis only one order smaller than that of elemental metals and the carrier\nmobility is only 2.47 cm$^2$/(V$\\cdot$s). Contrary to earlier reports, the\nvisible light absorption at 1.8 eV (~688 nm) is due to the bulk plasmon\nresonance, arising from the large carrier density, instead of an interband\ntransition. Excitation of the plasmonic resonance results in a multifold\nenhancement of the lifetime of charge carriers. Thus we propose that the hot\ncharge carriers generated from decay of plasmons produced by optical absorption\nis responsible for the water splitting efficiency of this material under\nvisible light irradiation.\n", "  A hydroelastic problem of flexural--gravity waves scattering by a demarcation\nbetween two floating elastic plates is investigated within the frame of linear\npotential-flow theory, where the method of matched eigenfunction expansions is\nemployed for analysis. A generalized extension is subsequently derived to\npromote the formulae to the case of multiple elastic plates on a stratified\nfluid with multiple layers, which is helpful to study the hydrodynamic\nbehaviors of inhomogeneous floating covers as well as the effects of density\nstratification in seawater. The eigenfunction expansions are numerically\ncalculated by an inner product technique, in which an orthogonal definition\ninvolving an explicit differential term exhibits the effectiveness in dealing\nwith the multi-layer matching relations between adjacent regions covered by\ndifferent elastic plates. By use of Green's theorem, an energy conversation\nrelation is deduced to assure the convergence of the calculation to the\nphysical reality, and the high converging rates are exhibited afterwards. The\ncorrectness of numerical results are also verified by comparing with a previous\nanalytical method. The details of the hydrodynamic responses of the generalized\nextension, especially the impact of the fluid stratification on the inner\nforces of the elastic plates, are discussed under different situations.\n", "  We investigate the dramatic switch of resistance in ordered correlated\ninsulators, when driven out of equilibrium by a strong voltage bias.\nMicroscopic calculations on a driven-dissipative lattice of interacting\nelectrons explain the main experimental features of resistive switching (RS),\nsuch as the hysteretic $I$-$V$ curves and the formation of hot conductive\nfilaments. The energy-resolved electron distribution at the RS reveals the\nunderlying nonequilibrium electronic mechanism, namely Landau-Zener tunneling,\nand also justifies a thermal description where the hot-electron temperature,\nestimated from the first moment of the distribution, matches the equilibrium\nphase transition temperature. We discuss the tangled relationship between\nfilament growth and negative differential resistance, and the influence of\ncrystallographic structure and disorder in the RS.\n", "  The electrical performance of two dimensional transitional metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) is strongly influenced by the amount of structural\ndefects inside. In this work, we provide an optical spectroscopic\ncharacterization approach to correlate the amount of structural defects and the\nelectrical performance of WSe2 devices. Low temperature photoluminescence (PL)\nspectra of electron beam lithography (EBL) processed WSe2 presents a clear\ndefect-induced PL emission due to excitons bound to defects, which would\nstrongly degrade the electrical performance. By adopting an e-beam-free\ntransfer-electrode technique, we are able to prepare backgated WSe2 device with\nlimited amount of defects. A maximum hole-mobility of about 200 cm2/Vs was\nachieved due to reduced scattering sources, which is the highest reported value\namong its type. This work would not only provide a versatile and nondestructive\nmethod to monitor the defects in TMDs, but also a new route to approach the\nroom temperature phonon-limited mobility in high performance TMDs devices.\n", "  We address here the question of interference of radio signals from\nastronomical sources like distant quasars, in a very long baseline\ninterferometer (VLBI), where two (or more) distantly located radio telescopes\n(apertures), receive simultaneous signal from the sky. In an equivalent optical\ntwo-slit experiment, it is generally argued that for the photons involved in\nthe interference pattern on the screen, it is not possible, even in principle,\nto know which of the two slits a particular photon went through and that any\nprocedure to ascertain this destroys the interference pattern. But in the case\nof the modern radio VLBI, it is a routine matter to record the phase and\namplitude of the voltage outputs from the two radio antennas on a recording\nmedia separately and then do the correlation between the two recorded signals\nlater in an offline manner. Does this not violate the quantum interference\nprinciple? We provide a resolution of this problem here.\n", "  Plasmonics, the science and technology of the interaction of light with\nmetallic objects, is fundamentally changing the way we can detect, generate and\nmanipulate light. Although the field is progressing swiftly, thanks to the\navailability of nanoscale manufacturing and analysis methods, fundamental\nproperties such as the plasmonic excitations' symmetries cannot be accessed\ndirectly, leading to a partial, sometimes incorrect, understanding of their\nproperties. Here we overcome this limitation by deliberately shaping the wave\nfunction of an electron beam to match a plasmonic excitations' symmetry in a\nmodified transmission electron microscope. We show experimentally and\ntheoretically that this offers selective detection of specific plasmon modes\nwithin metallic nanoparticles, while excluding modes with other symmetries.\nThis method resembles the widespread use of polarized light for the selective\nexcitation of plasmon modes with the advantage of locally probing the response\nof individual plasmonic objects and a far wider range of symmetry selection\ncriteria.\n", "  Hund's coupling is shown to generally favor, in a doped half-filled Mott\ninsulator, an increase in the compressibility culminating in a Fermi-liquid\ninstability towards phase separation. The largest effect is found about the\nfrontier between an ordinary and an orbitally-decoupled (\"Hund's\") metal. The\nincreased compressibility implies an enhancement of quasiparticle scattering,\nthus favoring other possible symmetry breakings. This physics is shown to\nhappen in simulations of the 122 Fe-based superconductors, possibly implying\nthe relevance of this mechanism in the enhancement of the the critical\ntemperature for superconductivity.\n", "  Spin chains can realise perfect quantum state transfer between the two ends\nvia judicious choice of coupling strengths. In this paper, we study what other\nstates can be created by engineering a spin chain. We conclude that, up to\nlocal phases, all single excitation quantum states with support on every site\nof the chain can be created. We pay particular attention to the generation of\nW-states that are superposed over every site of the chain.\n", "  Dirichlet boundary conditions have been widely used in general relativity.\nThey seem at odds with the holographic property of gravity simply because a\nboundary configuration can be varying and dynamic instead of dying out as\nrequired by the conditions. In this work we report what should be a tension\nbetween the Dirichlet boundary conditions and quantum gravitational effects,\nand show that a quantum-corrected black hole solution of the 1PI action no\nlonger obeys, in the naive manner one may expect, the Dirichlet boundary\nconditions imposed at the classical level. We attribute the `violation' of the\nDirichlet boundary conditions to a certain mechanism of the information storage\non the boundary.\n", "  We construct a non-linear theory of interacting spin-2 fields that is\ninvariant under the partially massless (PM) symmetry to all orders. This theory\nis based on the SO(1,5) group, in analogy with the SO(2,4) formulation of\nconformal gravity, but has a quadratic spectrum free of ghost instabilities.\nThe action contains a vector field associated to a local SO(2) symmetry which\nis manifest in the vielbein formulation of the theory. We show that, in a\nperturbative expansion, the SO(2) symmetry transmutes into the PM\ntransformations of a massive spin-2 field. In this context, the vector field is\ncrucial to circumvent earlier obstructions to an order-by-order construction of\nPM symmetry. Although the non-linear theory lacks enough first class\nconstraints to remove all helicity-0 modes from the spectrum, the PM\ntransformations survive to all orders. The absence of ghosts and strong\ncoupling effects at the non-linear level are not addressed here.\n", "  Neural networks have proven effective for solving many difficult\ncomputational problems. Implementing complex neural networks in software is\nvery computationally expensive. To explore the limits of information\nprocessing, it will be necessary to implement new hardware platforms with large\nnumbers of neurons, each with a large number of connections to other neurons.\nHere we propose a hybrid semiconductor-superconductor hardware platform for the\nimplementation of neural networks and large-scale neuromorphic computing. The\nplatform combines semiconducting few-photon light-emitting diodes with\nsuperconducting-nanowire single-photon detectors to behave as spiking neurons.\nThese processing units are connected via a network of optical waveguides, and\nvariable weights of connection can be implemented using several approaches. The\nuse of light as a signaling mechanism overcomes fanout and parasitic\nconstraints on electrical signals while simultaneously introducing physical\ndegrees of freedom which can be employed for computation. The use of\nsupercurrents achieves the low power density necessary to scale to systems with\nenormous entropy. The proposed processing units can operate at speeds of at\nleast $20$ MHz with fully asynchronous activity, light-speed-limited latency,\nand power densities on the order of 1 mW/cm$^2$ for neurons with 700\nconnections operating at full speed at 2 K. The processing units achieve an\nenergy efficiency of $\\approx 20$ aJ per synapse event. By leveraging\nmultilayer photonics with deposited waveguides and superconductors with feature\nsizes $>$ 100 nm, this approach could scale to systems with massive\ninterconnectivity and complexity for advanced computing as well as explorations\nof information processing capacity in systems with an enormous number of\ninformation-bearing microstates.\n", "  We merge two successful ab initio nuclear-structure methods, the no-core\nshell model (NCSM) and the multi-reference in-medium similarity renormalization\ngroup (IM-SRG) to define a new many-body approach for the comprehensive\ndescription of ground and excited states of closed and open-shell nuclei.\nBuilding on the key advantages of the two methods---the decoupling of\nexcitations at the many-body level in the IM-SRG and the access to arbitrary\nnuclei, eigenstates, and observables in the NCSM---their combination enables\nfully converged no-core calculations for an unprecedented range of nuclei and\nobservables at moderate computational cost. We present applications in the\ncarbon and oxygen isotopic chains, where conventional NCSM calculations are\nstill feasible and provide an important benchmark. The efficiency and rapid\nconvergence of the new approach make it ideally suited for ab initio studies of\nthe complete spectroscopy of nuclei up into the medium-mass regime.\n", "  We compute the longitudinal electrical conductivity in the presence of strong\nbackground magnetic field in complete leading order of perturbative QCD, based\non the assumed hierarchy of scales $\\alpha_s eB\\ll (m_q^2,T^2)\\ll eB$. We\nformulate an effective kinetic theory of lowest Landau level quarks with the\nleading order QCD collision term arising from 1-to-2 processes that become\npossible due to 1+1 dimensional Landau level kinematics. In small $m_q/T\\ll 1$\nregime, the longitudinal conductivity behaves as $\\sigma_{zz}\\sim\ne^2(eB)T/(\\alpha_s m_q^2\\log(m_q/T))$, where the quark mass dependence can be\nunderstood from the chiral anomaly with the axial charge relaxation provided by\na finite quark mass $m_q$. We also present parametric estimates for the\nlongitudinal and transverse \"color conductivities\" in the presence of strong\nmagnetic field, by computing dominant damping rates for quarks and gluons that\nare responsible for color charge transportation. We observe that the\nlongitudinal color conductivity is enhanced by strong magnetic field, which\nimplies that the sphaleron transition rate in perturbative QCD is suppressed by\nstrong magnetic field due to the enhanced Lenz's law in color field dynamics.\n", "  Obtaining high-sensitivity measurements of degree-scale cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) polarization is the most direct path to detecting primordial\ngravitational waves. Robustly recovering any primordial signal from the\ndominant foreground emission will require high-fidelity observations at\nmultiple frequencies, with excellent control of systematics. We explore the\npotential for a new platform for CMB observations, the Airlander 10 hybrid air\nvehicle, to perform this task. We show that the Airlander 10 platform,\noperating at commercial airline altitudes, is well-suited to mapping\nfrequencies above 220 GHz, which are critical for cleaning CMB maps of dust\nemission. Optimizing the distribution of detectors across frequencies, we\nforecast the ability of Airlander 10 to clean foregrounds of varying complexity\nas a function of altitude, demonstrating its complementarity with both existing\n(Planck) and ongoing (C-BASS) foreground observations. This novel platform\ncould play a key role in defining our ultimate view of the polarized microwave\nsky.\n", "  We study a generalization of the D-dimensional Vasiliev theory to include a\ntower of partially massless fields. This theory is obtained by replacing the\nusual higher-spin algebra of Killing tensors on (A)dS with a generalization\nthat includes \"third-order\" Killing tensors. Gauging this algebra with the\nVasiliev formalism leads to a fully non-linear theory which is expected to be\nUV complete, includes gravity, and can live on dS as well as AdS. The\nlinearized spectrum includes three massive particles and an infinite tower of\npartially massless particles, in addition to the usual spectrum of particles\npresent in the Vasiliev theory, in agreement with predictions from a putative\ndual CFT with the same symmetry algebra. We compute the masses of the particles\nwhich are not fixed by the massless or partially massless gauge symmetry,\nfinding precise agreement with the CFT predictions. This involves computing\nseveral dozen of the lowest-lying terms in the expansion of the trilinear form\nof the enlarged higher-spin algebra. We also discuss nuances in the theory that\noccur in specific dimensions; in particular, the theory dramatically truncates\nin bulk dimensions D=3,5 and has non-diagonalizable mixings which occur in\nD=4,7.\n", "  We continue our study of a generalization of the D-dimensional linearized\nVasiliev higher-spin equations to include a tower of partially massless (PM)\nfields. We compute one-loop effective actions by evaluating zeta functions for\nboth the \"minimal\" and \"non-minimal\" parity-even versions of the theory.\nSpecifically, we compute the log-divergent part of the effective action in\nodd-dimensional Euclidean AdS spaces for D=7 through 19 (dual to the a-type\nconformal anomaly of the dual boundary theory), and the finite part of the\neffective action in even-dimensional Euclidean AdS spaces for D=4 through 8\n(dual to the free energy on a sphere of the dual boundary theory). We pay\nspecial attention to the case D=4, where module mixings occur in the dual field\ntheory and subtlety arises in the one-loop computation. The results provide\nevidence that the theory is UV complete and one-loop exact, and we conjecture\nand provide evidence for a map between the inverse Newton's constant of the\npartially massless higher-spin theory and the number of colors in the dual CFT.\n", "  An algorithm for sequential calculation of non-isotropic matrix elements of\nthe collision integral which are necessary for the solution of the non-linear\nBoltzmann equation by moment method is proposed. Isotropic matrix elements that\nwe believe are known, are starting ones. The procedure is valid for any\ninteraction law and any mass ratio of the colliding particles.\n", "  Chimera-like states are manifested through the coexistence of synchronous and\nasynchronous dynamics and have been observed in various systems. To analyze the\nrole of network topology in giving rise to chimera-like states we study a\nheterogeneous network model comprising two group of nodes, of high and low\ndegrees of connectivity. The architecture facilitates the analysis of the\nsystem, which separates into a densely-connected coherent group of nodes,\nperturbed by their sparsely-connected drifting neighbors. It describes a\nsynchronous behavior of the densely-connected group and scaling properties of\nthe induced perturbations.\n", "  Two dimensional (2D) materials, e.g. graphene, transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), have demonstrated fascinating\nelectrical and optical characteristics and exhibited great potential in\noptoelectronic applications. High performance and multifunctional devices were\nachieved by employing diverse designs of architectures, such as hybrid systems\nwith nanostructured materials, bulk semiconductors and organics, forming 2D\nheterostructures. In this review, we mainly discuss the recent progresses of 2D\nmaterials in high responsive photodetectors, light-emitting devices and single\nphoton emitters. Hybrid systems and van der Waals heterostructures based\ndevices are emphasized, which exhibit great potential in state-of-the-art\napplications.\n", "  An isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model with a source of dark energy\nis studied. That source is simulated with a viscous relativistic fluid with\nminimal causal correction. In this model the restrictions on the parameters\ncoming from the following conditions are analized: a) energy density without\nsingularities along time, b) scale factor increasing with time, c) universe\naccelerated at present time, d) state equation for dark energy with \"w\" bounded\nand close to -1. It is found that those conditions are satified for the\nfollowing two cases. i) When the transport coefficient ({\\tau}_{{\\Pi}}),\nassociated to the causal correction, is negative, with the aditional\nrestriction {\\zeta}|{\\tau}_{{\\Pi}}|>2/3, where {\\zeta} is the relativistic bulk\nviscosity coefficient. The state equation is in the \"phantom\" energy sector.\nii) For {\\tau}_{{\\Pi}} positive, in the \"k-essence\" sector. It is performed an\nexact calculation for the case where the equation of state is constant, finding\nthat option (ii) is favored in relation to (i), because in (ii) the entropy is\nalways increasing, while this does no happen in (i).\n", "  We report on a new, single-step and scalable method to fabricate highly\nordered, multi-directional and complex surface structures that mimic the unique\nmorphological features of certain species found in nature. Biomimetic surface\nstructuring was realized by exploiting the unique and versatile angular profile\nand the electric field symmetry of cylindrical vector (CV) femtosecond (fs)\nlaser beams. It is shown that, highly controllable, periodic structures\nexhibiting sizes at nano-, micro- and dual-scale micro and nano scales can be\ndirectly written on Ni upon line and large area scanning with radial and\nazimuthal polarization beams. Depending on the irradiation conditions, new\ncomplex multi-directional nanostructures, inspired by the Shark skin\nmorphology, as well as superhydrophobic dual-scale structures mimicking the\nLotus leaf water repellent properties can be attained. It is concluded that the\nversatility and features variations of structures formed upon scanning with CV\nbeams is by far superior to those obtained via laser processing with linearly\npolarized beams. More important, by exploiting the capabilities offered by fs\nCV optical fields, the present technique can be further extended to fabricate\neven more complex and unconventional structures. We believe that our approach\nprovides a new concept in laser processing of materials, which can be further\nexploited for expanding the breadth and novelty of potential applications.\n", "  Producing high-brightness and high-charge (>100 pC) electron bunches at\nblowout regime requires ultrashort laser pulses with high fluence. The effects\nof laser pulse heating of the copper photocathode are analyzed in this paper.\nThe electron and lattice temperature is calculated using an improved\ntwo-temperature model, and an extended Dowell-Schmerge model is employed to\ncalculate the thermal emittance and quantum efficiency. A time-dependent growth\nof the thermal emittance and the quantum efficiency is observed. For a fixed\namount of charge, the projected thermal emittance increases with decreasing\nlaser radius, and this effect should be taken into account in laser\noptimization at blowout regime. Moreover, laser damage threshold fluence is\nsimulated, showing that the maximum local fluence should be less than 40\nmJ/cm^2 to prevent damage to the cathode.\n", "  We present a general method to construct translation-invariant and SU(2)\nsymmetric antiferromagnetic parent Hamiltonians of valence bond crystals (VBC).\nThe method is based on a canonical mapping transforming S=1/2 spin operators\ninto a bilinear form of a new set of dimer fermion operators. We construct\nparent Hamltonians of the columnar- and the staggered-VBC on the square\nlattice, for which the VBC is an eigenstate in all regimes and the exact ground\nstate in some region of the phase diagram. We study the depart from the exact\nVBC regime upon tuning the anisotropy by means of the hierarchical mean field\ntheory and exact diagonalization on finite clusters. In both Hamiltonians, the\nVBC phase extends over the exact regime and transits to a columnar\nantiferromagnet (CAFM) through a window of intermediate phases, revealing an\nintriguing competition of correlation lengths at the VBC-CAFM transition. The\nmethod can be readily applied to construct other VBC parent Hamiltonians in\ndifferent lattices and dimensions.\n", "  Markov logic networks (MLNs) reconcile two opposing schools in machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence: causal networks, which account for\nuncertainty extremely well, and first-order logic, which allows for formal\ndeduction. An MLN is essentially a first-order logic template to generate\nMarkov networks. Inference in MLNs is probabilistic and it is often performed\nby approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Gibbs sampling.\nAn MLN has many regular, symmetric structures that can be exploited at both\nfirst-order level and in the generated Markov network. We analyze the graph\nstructures that are produced by various lifting methods and investigate the\nextent to which quantum protocols can be used to speed up Gibbs sampling with\nstate preparation and measurement schemes. We review different such approaches,\ndiscuss their advantages, theoretical limitations, and their appeal to\nimplementations. We find that a straightforward application of a recent result\nyields exponential speedup compared to classical heuristics in approximate\nprobabilistic inference, thereby demonstrating another example where advanced\nquantum resources can potentially prove useful in machine learning.\n", "  A new one-dimensional fluid model for ions in weakly-ionized plasma is\nproposed. The model differs from the existing ones in two aspects. First, a\nmore accurate approximation of the collision terms in the fluid equations is\nsuggested. For this purpose, the results obtained using the Monte-Carlo kinetic\nmodel of the ion swarm experiments are considered. Second, the ion energy\nequation is taken into account. The fluid equations are closed using a simple\nmodel of the ion velocity distribution function. The accuracy of the fluid\nmodel is examined by comparing with the results of particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo\nsimulations. In particular, several test problems are considered using a\nparallel plate model of the capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharge. It\nis shown that the results obtained using the proposed fluid model are in good\nagreement with those obtained from the simulations over a wide range of\ndischarge conditions. An approximation of the ion velocity distribution\nfunction for the problem under consideration is also discussed.\n", "  We discovered novel Anderson localization behaviors of pseudospin systems in\na 1D disordered potential. For a pseudospin-1 system, due to the absence of\nbackscattering under normal incidence and the presence of a conical band\nstructure, the wave localization behaviors are entirely different from those of\nnormal disordered systems. We show both numerically and analytically that there\nexists a critical strength of random potential ($W_c$), which is equal to the\nincident energy ($E$), below which the localization length $\\xi$ decreases with\nthe random strength $W$ for a fixed incident angle $\\theta$. But the\nlocalization length drops abruptly to a minimum at $W=W_c$ and rises\nimmediately afterwards, which has never been observed in ordinary materials.\nThe incidence angle dependence of the localization length has different\nasymptotic behaviors in two regions of random strength, with $\\xi \\propto\n\\sin^{-4}\\theta$ when $W<W_c$ and $\\xi \\propto \\sin^{-2}\\theta$ when $W>W_c$.\nExperimentally, for a given disordered sample with a fixed randomness strength\n$W$, the incident wave with incident energy $E$ will experience two different\ntypes of localization, depending on whether $E>W$ or $E<W$. The existence of a\nsharp transition at $E=W$ is due to the emergence of evanescent waves in the\nsystems when $E<W$. Such localization behavior is unique to pseudospin-1\nsystems. For pseudospin-1/2 systems, there is a minimum localization length as\nrandomness increases, but the transition from decreasing to increasing\nlocalization length at the minimum is smooth rather than abrupt. In both\ndecreasing and increasing regions, the $\\theta$ -dependence of the localization\nlength has the same asymptotic behavior $\\xi \\propto \\sin^{-2}\\theta$.\n", "  We study plasmon modes of the two-dimensional electron gas residing at the\ninterface of band insulators $\\rm{LaAlO_3}$ and $\\rm{SrTiO_3}$ (LAO/STO) and\nthe plasmon excitations of graphene-LAO/STO double layer as well. Considering\nthe electron-electron interaction within random phase approximation, we\ncalculate the plasmon dispersions of both systems numerically and in the long\nwavelength limit analytical expressions for collective modes are found. One\noptical mode and two (three) acoustic modes are predicted for the LAO/STO\n(graphene-LAO/STO) system where only the uppermost acoustic mode of both\nsystems can emerge above the electron-hole continuum depending on the\ncharacteristics of each system. In the case of LAO/STO interface, thanks to the\nspatial separation between $\\rm{t_{2g}}$ orbitals, the upper acoustic mode\nmight be undamped at the long wavelength limit depending on the exact value of\nthe dielectric constant of $\\rm{SrTiO_3}$. Same as other double layer systems,\nthe interlayer distance for the graphene-LAO/STO system plays a crucial role in\ndamping the upper acoustic mode. Faster damping of all plasmon modes of the\npresent double layer system in comparison with the ones with conventional 2DEG\ninstead of $\\rm{t_{2g}}$ electron gas is also found due to heavier effective\nmasses of the gas and also stronger interlayer Coulomb interaction.\n", "  We derive the relativistic Hamiltonian of hydrogen atom in dynamical\nnoncommutative spaces (DNCS or {\\tau}-space). Using this Hamiltonian we\ncalculate the energy shift of the ground state and as well the [2P]_(1/2),\n[2S]_(1/2) levels. In all cases the energy shift depend on the dynamical\nnoncommutative parameter {\\tau}. Using the accuracy of the energy measurement\nwe obtain an upper bound for {\\tau}. We also study the lamb shift in DNCS. Both\nthe levels [2P]_(1/2) and [2S]_(1/2) receive corrections due to dynamical\nnoncommutativity of space which is in contrast to the non-dynamical\nnoncommutative spaces (NDNCS or {\\theta}-space) in which the level [2S]_(1/2)\nreceives no correction.\n", "  A search for a neutrino signal from WIMP pair annihilations in the centre of\nthe Earth has been performed with the data collected with the ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope from 2007 to 2012. The event selection criteria have been developed\nand tuned to maximise the sensitivity of the experiment to such a neutrino\nsignal. No significant excess of neutrinos over the expected background has\nbeen observed. Upper limits at $90\\%$ C.L. on the WIMP annihilation rate in the\nEarth and the spin independent scattering cross-section of WIMPs to nucleons\n$\\sigma^{SI}_p$ were calculated for WIMP pair annihilations into either\n$\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}$, $W^+W^-$, $b\\overline{b}$ or the non-SUSY\n$\\nu_{\\mu}\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$ as a function of the WIMP mass (between\n$25\\,\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$ and $1000\\,\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$) and as a function of the\nthermally averaged annihilation cross section times velocity $\\langle\\sigma_{A}\nv\\rangle_{Earth}$ of the WIMPs in the centre of the Earth. For masses of the\nWIMP close to the mass of iron nuclei ($50\\,\\mathrm{GeV/c^2}$), the obtained\nlimits on $\\sigma^{SI}_p$ are more stringent than those obtained by other\nindirect searches.\n", "  We study the relation between quantum fluctuations and the significant\nenhancement of the performance of quantum annealing in a mean-field\nHamiltonian. First-order quantum phase transitions were shown to be reduced to\nsecond order by antiferromagnetic transverse interactions in a mean-field-type\nmany-body-interacting Ising spin system in a transverse field, which means an\nexponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic quantum computation. We\ninvestigate if and how quantum effects manifest themselves around these first-\nand second-order phase transitions to understand if the antiferromagnetic\ntransverse interactions appended to the conventional transverse-field Ising\nmodel induce notable quantum effects. By measuring the proximity of the\nsemiclassical spin-coherent state to the true ground state as well as the\nmagnitude of the concurrence representing entanglement, we conclude that\nsignificant quantum fluctuations exist around second-order transitions, whereas\nquantum effects are much less prominent at first-order transitions. Although\nthe location of the transition point can be predicted by the classical picture,\nsystem properties near the transition need quantum-mechanical descriptions for\na second-order transition but not necessarily for first order. It is also found\nthat quantum fluctuations are large within the ferromagnetic phase after a\nsecond-order transition from the paramagnetic phase. These results suggest that\nthe antiferromagnetic transverse interactions induce marked quantum effects,\nand this fact would be related to closely to the significant enhancement of the\nperformance of quantum annealing.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to provide geoscientists with the most accurate set\nof the Earth's astro-climatic parameters and daily insolation quantities, able\nto describe the Short-Term Orbital Forcing (STOF) as represented by the\never-changing incoming solar radiation. We provide an updated review and a\npragmatic tool/database using the latest astronomical models and orbital\nephemeris, for the entire Holocene and 1 kyr into the future. Our results are\ncompared with the most important database produced for studying long-term\norbital forcing showing no systematic discrepancies over the full thirteen\nthousand years period studied.\n  Our detailed analysis of the periods present in STOF, as perturbed by Solar\nSystem bodies, yields a very rich dynamical modulation on annual-to-decadal\ntimescales when compared to previous results.\n  In addition, we addressed, for the first time, the error committed\nconsidering daily insolation as a continuous function of orbital longitudes\nwith respect to the nominal values, i.e., calculating the corresponding daily\ninsolation with orbital longitudes tabulated {\\it at noon}.\n  We found important relative differences up to $\\pm$ 5\\%, which correspond to\nerrors of 2.5 W m$^{-2}$ in the daily mean insolation, for exactly the same\ncalendar day and set of astro-climatic parameters. This previously unrecognized\nerror could have a significant impact in both the initial and boundary\nconditions for any climate modeling experiment.\n", "  In the recent past there have been many attempts to associate the generation\nof primordial magnetic seed fields with the inflationary era, but with limited\nsuccess. We thus take a different approach by using a model for nonsingular\nbouncing cosmology. A coupling of the electromagnetic Lagrangian\n$F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$ with a non background scalar field has been considered\nfor the breaking of conformal invariance. We have shown that non singular\nbouncing cosmology supports magnetogenesis evading the long standing back\nreaction and strong coupling problems which have plagued inflationary\nmagnetogenesis. In this model, we have achieved a scale invariant power\nspectrum for the parameter range compatible with observed CMB anisotropies. The\ndesired strength of the magnetic field has also been obtained that goes in\naccordance with present observations. It is also important to note that no BKL\ninstability arises within this parameter range. The energy scales for different\nstages of evolution of the bouncing model are so chosen that they solve the\nproblems of Standard Big Bang cosmology as well.\n", "  The Type IIn supernova (SN) 1978K in the nearby galaxy NGC 1313 has remained\nbright in multiwavelengths for more than $\\sim 25$ yr. The archival data of SN\n1978K collected with ROSAT, ASCA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra from 1990 to 2006\nshow no significant variation of the soft X-ray emission but a hint of flux\ndecrease in hard X-rays. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis using\nmore than 15 yr of XMM-Newton observations. Both the 0.5-2 keV and 2-10 keV\nlight-curves decline as $t^{-1}$ from 2000 to 2015. The transition of light\ncurve profiles can be explained in a way that the reverse shock was radiative\nat an early phase and then became adiabatic at late times. Such a scenario is\nalso supported by the spectral analysis results. We also found a decrease in\nthe absorption column density, which indicates the presence of a cool shell\nduring the radiative phase.\n", "  The on-chip integration of quantum light sources and nonlinear elements poses\na serious challenge to the development of a scalable photonic platform for\nquantum information and communication. In this work we demonstrate the\npotential of a novel hybrid technology which combines single organic molecules\nas quantum emitters and dielectric chips, consisting of ridge waveguides and\ngrating far-field couplers. Dibenzoterrylene molecules in thin anthracene\ncrystals exhibit long-term photostability, easy fabrication methods, almost\nunitary quantum yield and life-time limited emission at cryogenic temperatures.\nWe couple such single emitters to silicon nitride ridge waveguide with a\ncoupling efficiency of up to 42+/-2 %, considering both propagation directions.\nThe platform is devised to support both on-chip and free-space single photon\nprocessing.\n", "  We devote this work to the study of the mean-field phase diagram of the\n$\\nu=0$ quantum Hall state in bilayer graphene and the computation of the\ncorresponding neutral collective modes, extending the results of recent works\nin the literature. Specifically, we provide a detailed classification of the\ncomplete orbital-valley-spin structure of the collective modes and show that\nphase transitions are characterized by singlet modes in orbital pseudospin,\nwhich are independent of the Coulomb strength and suffer strong many-body\ncorrections from short-range interactions at low momentum. We describe the\nsymmetry breaking mechanism for phase transitions in terms of the valley-spin\nstructure of the Goldstone modes. For the remaining phase boundaries, we prove\nthat the associated exact $SO(5)$ symmetry existing at zero Zeeman energy and\ninterlayer voltage survives as a weaker mean-field symmetry of the Hartree-Fock\nequations. We extend the previous results for bilayer graphene to the monolayer\nscenario. Finally, we show that taking into account Landau level mixing through\nscreening does not modify the physical picture explained above.\n", "  A central difficulty of state-specific Multi-Reference Coupled Cluster\n(MR-CC) formalisms concerns the definition of the amplitudes of the single and\ndouble excitation operators appearing in the exponential wave operator. If the\nreference space is a complete active space (CAS) the number of these amplitudes\nis larger than the number of singly and doubly excited determinants on which\none may project the eigenequation, and one must impose additional conditions.\nThe present work first defines a state-specific reference-independent operator\n$\\hat{\\tilde{T}}^m$ which acting on the CAS component of the wave function\n$|\\Psi_0^m \\rangle$ maximizes the overlap between\n$(1+\\hat{\\tilde{T}}^m)|\\Psi_0^m \\rangle$ and the eigenvector of the CAS-SD CI\nmatrix $|\\Psi_{\\rm CAS-SD}^m \\rangle$. This operator may be used to generate\napproximate coefficients of the Triples and Quadruples, and a dressing of the\nCAS-SD CI matrix, according to the intermediate Hamiltonian formalism. The\nprocess may be iterated to convergence. As a refinement towards a strict\nCoupled Cluster formalism, one may exploit reference-independent amplitudes\nprovided by $(1+\\hat{\\tilde{T}}^m)|\\Psi_0^m \\rangle$ to define a\nreference-dependent operator $\\hat{T}^m$ by fitting the eigenvector of the\n(dressed) CAS-SD CI matrix. The two variants, which are internally\nuncontracted, give rather similar results. The new MR-CC version has been\ntested on the ground state potential energy curves of 6 molecules (up to\ntriple-bond breaking) and a two excited states. The non-parallelism error with\nrespect to the Full-CI curves is of the order of 1 m$E_{\\rm h}$.\n", "  We describe the basic properties and consequences of introducing active\nstresses, with principal direction along the local director, in cholesteric\nliquid crystals. The helical ground state is found to be linearly unstable to\nextensile stresses, without threshold in the limit of infinite system size,\nwhereas contractile stresses are hydrodynamically screened by the cholesteric\nelasticity to give a finite threshold. This is confirmed numerically and the\nnon-linear consequences of instability, in both extensile and contractile\ncases, are studied. We also consider the stresses associated to defects in the\ncholesteric pitch ($\\lambda$ lines) and show how the geometry near to the\ndefect generates threshold-less flows reminiscent of those for defects in\nactive nematics. At large extensile activity $\\lambda$ lines are spontaneously\ncreated and can form steady state patterns sustained by constant active flows.\n", "  Axisymmetric free-boundary equilibrium reconstructions of tokamak plasmas in\nthe Lithium Tokamak eXperiment (LTX) are performed using the PSI-Tri\nequilibrium code. Reconstructions in LTX are complicated by the presence of\nlong-lived non-axisymmetric eddy currents generated by vacuum vessel and first\nwall structures. To account for this effect, reconstructions are performed with\nadditional toroidal current sources in these conducting regions. The source\ndistributions are fixed poloidally, but their scale is adjusted as part of the\nfull reconstruction. Eddy distributions are computed by toroidally averaging\ncurrents, generated by coupling to vacuum field coils, from a simplified 3D\nfilament model of important conducting structures. The full 3D eddy current\nfields are also used to enable the inclusion of local magnetic field\nmeasurements, which have strong 3D eddy current pick-up, as reconstruction\nconstraints. Using this method, equilibrium reconstruction yields good\nagreement with all available diagnostic signals. An accompanying field\nperturbation produced by 3D eddy currents on the plasma surface with primarily\nn=2, m=1 character is also predicted for these equilibria.\n", "  We propose a hybrid device consisting of a graphene/silicon (Gr/Si) Schottky\ndiode in parallel with a Gr/SiO2/Si capacitor for high-performance\nphotodetection. The device, fabricated by transfer of commercial graphene on\nlow-doped n-type Si substrate, achieves a photoresponse as high as 3 AW^(-1)\nand a normalized detectivity higher than 3.5 10^12 cmHz^(1/2) W^(-1) in the\nvisible range. The device exhibits a photocurrent exceeding the forward\ncurrent, because photo-generated minority carriers, accumulated at Si/SiO2\ninterface of the Gr/SiO2/Si capacitor, diffuse to the Gr/Si junction. We show\nthat the same mechanism, when due to thermally generated carriers, although\nusually neglected or disregarded, causes the increased leakage often measured\nin Gr/Si heterojunctions. At room temperature, we measure a zero-bias Schottky\nbarrier height of 0.52 eV, as well as an effective Richardson constant A**=4\n10^(-5) Acm^(-2) K^(-2) and an ideality factor n=3.6, explained by a thin (<\n1nm) oxide layer at the Gr/Si interface.\n", "  We have performed the calculations for the nonleptonic $\\Xi_b^- \\rightarrow\n\\pi^- \\ \\Xi_c^0 (2790) \\left(J=\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ and $\\Xi_b^- \\rightarrow\n\\pi^- \\ \\Xi_c^0 (2815) \\left(J=\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$ and the same reactions\nreplacing the $\\pi^-$ by a $D_s^-$. At the same time we evaluate the\nsemileptonic rates for $\\Xi_b^- \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_l l \\ \\Xi_c^0 (2790)$ and\n$\\Xi_b^- \\rightarrow \\bar{\\nu}_l l \\ \\Xi_c^0 (2815)$. We look at the reactions\nfrom the perspective that the $\\Xi_c^0 (2790)$ and $\\Xi_c^0 (2815)$ resonances\nare dynamically generated from the pseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon\ninteractions. We evaluate ratios of the rates of these reactions and make\npredictions that can be tested in future experiments. We also find that the\nresults are rather sensitive to the coupling of the $\\Xi_c^*$ resonances to the\n$D^* \\Sigma$ and $D^* \\Lambda$ components.\n", "  We discuss the emergence of p-wave superfluidity of identical atomic fermions\nin a two-dimensional optical lattice. The optical lattice potential manifests\nitself in an interplay between an increase in the density of states on the\nFermi surface and the modification of the fermion-fermion interaction\n(scattering) amplitude. The density of states is enhanced due to an increase of\nthe effective mass of atoms. In deep lattices the scattering amplitude is\nstrongly reduced compared to free space due to a small overlap of wavefunctions\nof fermion sitting in the neighboring lattice sites, which suppresses the\np-wave superfluidity. However, for moderate lattice depths the enhancement of\nthe density of states can compensate the decrease of the scattering amplitude.\nMoreover, the lattice setup significantly reduces inelastic collisional losses,\nwhich allows one to get closer to a p-wave Feshbach resonance. This opens\npossibilities to obtain the topological $p_x+ip_y$ superfluid phase, especially\nin the recently proposed subwavelength lattices. We demonstrate this for the\ntwo-dimensional version of the Kronig-Penney model allowing a transparent\nphysical analysis.\n", "  An essential quantity to ensure evolvability of populations is the\nnavigability of the genotype space. Navigability relies on the existence of\nsufficiently large genotype networks, that is ensembles of sequences with the\nsame phenotype that guarantee an efficient random drift through sequence space.\nThe number of sequences compatible with a given structure (e.g. the number of\nRNA sequences folding into a particular secondary structure, or the number of\nDNA sequences coding for the same protein structure) is astronomically large in\nall functional molecules investigated. However, an exhaustive experimental or\ncomputational study of all RNA folds or all protein structures becomes\nimpossible even for moderately long sequences. Here, we analytically derive the\ndistribution of phenotype sizes for a hierarchy of models which successively\nincorporate features of increasingly realistic sequence-to-structure\ngenotype-phenotype maps. The main feature of these models relies on the\ncharacterization of each phenotype through a prototypical sequence whose sites\nadmit a variable fraction of letters of the alphabet. Our models interpolate\nbetween two limit distributions: a powerlaw distribution, when the ordering of\nsites in the prototypical sequence is strongly constrained, and a lognormal\ndistribution, as suggested for RNA, when different orderings of the same set of\nsites yield different phenotypes. Our main result is the qualitative and\nquantitative identification of those features of the sequence-to-structure map\nthat lead to different distributions of phenotype sizes.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of second-order phase transitions in a\nsimplified Ginzburg-Landau model using the Fokker-Planck formalism. In\nparticular, we focus on deriving the Kibble-Zurek scaling laws that dictate the\ndependence of spatial correlations on the quench rate. In the limiting cases of\noverdamped and underdamped dynamics, the Fokker-Planck method confirms the\ntheoretical predictions of the Kibble-Zurek scaling theory. The developed\nframework is computationally efficient, enables the prediction of finite-size\nscaling functions and is applicable to microscopic models as well as their\nhydrodynamic approximations. We demonstrate this extended range of\napplicability by analyzing the non-equilibrium linear to zigzag structural\nphase transition in ion Coulomb crystals confined in a trap with periodic\nboundary conditions.\n", "  Magnetic frustration and low dimensionality can prevent long range magnetic\norder and lead to exotic correlated ground states. SrDy$_2$O$_4$ consists of\nmagnetic Dy$^{3+}$ ions forming magnetically frustrated zig-zag chains along\nthe c-axis and shows no long range order to temperatures as low as $T=60$ mK.\nWe carried out neutron scattering and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements\nusing powder and single crystals of SrDy$_2$O$_4$. Diffuse neutron scattering\nindicates strong one-dimensional (1D) magnetic correlations along the chain\ndirection that can be qualitatively accounted for by the axial next-nearest\nneighbour Ising (ANNNI) model with nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor\nexchange $J_1=0.3$ meV and $J_2=0.2$ meV, respectively. Three-dimensional (3D)\ncorrelations become important below $T^*\\approx0.7$ K. At $T=60$ mK, the short\nrange correlations are characterized by a putative propagation vector\n$\\textbf{k}_{1/2}=(0,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$. We argue that the absence of\nlong range order arises from the presence of slowly decaying 1D domain walls\nthat are trapped due to 3D correlations. This stabilizes a low-temperature\nphase without long range magnetic order, but with well-ordered chain segments\nseparated by slowly-moving domain walls.\n", "  Topological superconductivity is a state of matter that can host Majorana\nmodes, the building blocks of a topological quantum computer. Many experimental\nplatforms predicted to show such a topological state rely on proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity. However, accessing the topological properties requires an\ninduced hard superconducting gap, which is challenging to achieve for most\nmaterial systems. We have systematically studied how the interface between an\nInSb semiconductor nanowire and a NbTiN superconductor affects the induced\nsuperconducting properties. Step by step, we improve the homogeneity of the\ninterface while ensuring a barrier-free electrical contact to the\nsuperconductor, and obtain a hard gap in the InSb nanowire. The magnetic field\nstability of NbTiN allows the InSb nanowire to maintain a hard gap and a\nsupercurrent in the presence of magnetic fields (~ 0.5 Tesla), a requirement\nfor topological superconductivity in one-dimensional systems. Our study\nprovides a guideline to induce superconductivity in various experimental\nplatforms such as semiconductor nanowires, two dimensional electron gases and\ntopological insulators, and holds relevance for topological superconductivity\nand quantum computation.\n", "  The mass spectrum of $b\\bar{b}$ states has been obtained using the\nphenomenological relativistic quark model (RQM). The Hamiltonian used in the\ninvestigation has confinement potential and confined one gluon exchange\npotential (COGEP). In the frame work of RQM a study of M1 and E1 radiative\ndecays of $b\\bar{b}$ states have been made. The weak decay widths in the\nspectator quark approximation have been estimated. An overall agreement is\nobtained with the experimental masses and decay widths.\n", "  We study a mixture of s-bosons and like-nucleon pairs with the standard\npairing interaction outside a inert core. Competition between the nucleon-pairs\nand s-bosons is investigated in this scenario. The robustness of the BCS-BEC\ncoexistence and crossover phenomena is examined through an analysis of pf-shell\nnuclei with realistic single-particle energies in which two configurations with\nPauli blocking of nucleon-pair orbits due to the formation of the s-bosons is\ntaken into account. When the nucleon-pair orbits are considered to be\nindependent of the s-bosons, the BCS-BEC crossover becomes smooth with the\nnumber of the s-bosons noticeably more than that of the nucleonpairs near the\nhalf-shell point, a feature that is demonstrated in the pf-shell for several\nvalues of the standard pairing interaction strength. As a further test of the\nrobustness of the BCS-BEC coexistence and crossover phenomena in nuclei,\nresults are given for B(E2; 0^{+}_{g}->2^{+}_1) values of even-even 102-130Sn\nwith 100Sn taken as a core and valence neutron pairs confined within the 1d5/2,\n0g7/2, 1d3/2, 2s1/2, 1h11/2 orbits in the nucleon-pair orbit and the s-boson\nindependent approximation. The results indicate that the B(E2) values are well\nreproduced.\n", "  Tensor-optimized antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (TOAMD) is the basis of\nthe successive variational method for nuclear many-body problem. We apply TOAMD\nto finite nuclei to be described by the central interaction with strong\nshort-range repulsion, and compare the results with the unitary correlation\noperator method (UCOM). In TOAMD, the pair-type correlation functions and their\nmultiple products are operated to the AMD wave function. We show the results of\nTOAMD using the Malfliet-Tjon central potential containing the strong\nshort-range repulsion. Adding the double products of the correlation functions\nin TOAMD, the binding energies are converged quickly to the exact values of the\nfew-body calculations for s-shell nuclei. This indicates the high efficiency of\nTOAMD for treating the short-range repulsion in nuclei. We also employ the\ns-wave configurations of nuclei with the central part of UCOM, which reduces\nthe short-range relative amplitudes of nucleon pair in nuclei to avoid the\nshort-range repulsion. In UCOM, we further perform the superposition of the\ns-wave configurations with various size parameters, which provides a\nsatisfactory solution of energies close to the exact and TOAMD values.\n", "  Homodyne and heterodyne detection represent \"twin-pillars\" of quantum\ndisplacement sensing using optical cavities, having permitted major\nbreakthroughs including detection of gravitational waves and of the motion of\nquantum ground-state cooled mechanical oscillators. Both can suffer\ndisadvantages as diagnostics in quantum optomechanics, either through\nsymmetrisation (homodyne), or loss of correlations (heterodyne). We show that,\nfor modest heterodyne beat frequencies ($\\Omega \\sim \\omega_M/10 \\gg \\Gamma$),\njudicious construction of the autocorrelation of the measured current can\neither recover (i) a spectrum with strong sidebands but without an imprecision\nnoise floor (ii) a spectrum which is a hybrid, combining both homodyne and\nheterodyne sideband features. We simulate an experimental realisation with\nstochastic numerics and find excellent agreement with analytical quantum noise\nspectra. We term such retrospective recovery of lost heterodyne correlations\n\"r-heterodyning\": as the method simply involves post-processing of a normal\nheterodyne time signal, there is no additional experimental constraint other\nthan on the magnitude of $\\Omega$.\n", "  Optimization of the fidelity of control operations is of critical importance\nin the pursuit of fault-tolerant quantum computation. We apply optimal control\ntechniques to demonstrate that a single drive via the cavity in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics can implement a high-fidelity two-qubit all-microwave gate that\ndirectly entangles the qubits via the mutual qubit-cavity couplings. This is\nperformed by driving at one of the qubits' frequencies which generates a\nconditional two-qubit gate, but will also generate other spurious interactions.\nThese optimal control techniques are used to find pulse shapes that can perform\nthis two-qubit gate with high fidelity, robust against errors in the system\nparameters. The simulations were all performed using experimentally relevant\nparameters and constraints.\n", "  Drift-diffusion model is an indispensable modeling tool to understand the\ncarrier dynamics (transport, recombination, and collection) and simulate\npractical-efficiency of solar cells (SCs) through taking into account various\ncarrier recombination losses existing in multilayered device structures.\nExploring the way to predict and approach the SC efficiency limit by using the\ndrift-diffusion model will enable us to gain more physical insights and design\nguidelines for emerging photovoltaics, particularly perovskite solar cells. Our\nwork finds out that two procedures are the prerequisites for predicting and\napproaching the SC efficiency limit. Firstly, the intrinsic radiative\nrecombination needs to be corrected after adopting optical designs which will\nsignificantly affect the open-circuit voltage at its Shockley-Queisser limit.\nThrough considering a detailed balance between emission and absorption of\nsemiconductor materials at the thermal equilibrium, and the Boltzmann\nstatistics at the non-equilibrium, we offer a different approach to derive the\naccurate expression of intrinsic radiative recombination with the optical\ncorrections for semiconductor materials. The new expression captures light\ntrapping of the absorbed photons and angular restriction of the emitted photons\nsimultaneously, which are ignored in the traditional Roosbroeck-Shockley\nexpression. Secondly, the contact characteristics of the electrodes need to be\ncarefully engineered to eliminate the charge accumulation and surface\nrecombination at the electrodes. The selective contact or blocking layer\nincorporated nonselective contact that inhibits the surface recombination at\nthe electrode is another important prerequisite. With the two procedures, the\naccurate prediction of efficiency limit and precise evaluation of efficiency\ndegradation for perovskite solar cells are attainable by the drift-diffusion\nmodel.\n", "  We report the preparation of the interface between graphene and the strong\nRashba-split BiAg$_2$ surface alloy and investigatigation of its structure as\nwell as the electronic properties by means of scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Upon\nevaluation of the quasiparticle interference patterns the unpertrubated linear\ndispersion for the $\\pi$ band of $n$-doped graphene is observed. Our results\nalso reveal the intact nature of the giant Rashba-split surface states of the\nBiAg$_2$ alloy, which demonstrate only a moderate downward energy shift upon\nthe presence of graphene. This effect is explained in the framework of density\nfunctional theory by an inward relaxation of the Bi atoms at the interface and\nsubsequent delocalisation of the wave function of the surface states. Our\nfindings demonstrate a realistic pathway to prepare a graphene protected giant\nRashba-split BiAg$_2$ for possible spintronic applications.\n", "  The fate of exotic spin liquid states with fractionalized excitations at\nfinite temperature ($T$) is of great interest, since signatures of\nfractionalization manifest in finite-temperature ($T$) dynamics in real\nsystems, above the tiny magnetic ordering scales. Here, we study a\nJordan-Wigner fermionized Kitaev spin liquid at finite $T$ employing combined\nExact diagonalization and Monte Carlo simulation methods. We uncover $(i)$\ncheckerboard or stripy-ordered flux crystals depending on density of flux, and\n$(ii)$ establish, surprisingly, that: $(a)$ the finite-$T$ version of the $T=0$\ntransition from a gapless to gapped phases in the Kitaev model is a Mott\ntransition of the fermions, belonging to the two-dimensional Ising universality\nclass. These transitions correspond to a topological transition between a\nstring condensate and a dilute closed string state $(b)$ the Mott \"insulator\"\nphase is a precise realization of Laughlin's gossamer (here, p-wave)\nsuperconductor (g-SC), and $(c)$ the Kitaev Toric Code phase (TC) is a {\\it\nfully} Gutzwiller-projected p-wave SC. These findings establish the finite-$T$\nQSL phases in the $d = 2$ to be {\\it hidden} Fermi liquid(s) of neutral\nfermions.\n", "  We investigate the superconducting-gap anisotropy in one of the recently\ndiscovered BiS$_2$-based superconductors, NdO$_{0.71}$F$_{0.29}$BiS$_2$ ($T_c$\n$\\sim$ 5 K), using laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.\nWhereas the previously discovered high-$T_c$ superconductors such as copper\noxides and iron-based superconductors, which are believed to have\nunconventional superconducting mechanisms, have $3d$ electrons in their\nconduction bands, the conduction band of BiS$_2$-based superconductors mainly\nconsists of Bi 6$p$ electrons, and hence the conventional superconducting\nmechanism might be expected. Contrary to this expectation, we observe a\nstrongly anisotropic superconducting gap. This result strongly suggests that\nthe pairing mechanism for NdO$_{0.71}$F$_{0.29}$BiS$_2$ is unconventional one\nand we attribute the observed anisotropy to competitive or cooperative multiple\nparing interactions.\n", "  The height of an $n$th-order fundamental rogue wave $q_{\\rm rw}^{[n]}$ for\nthe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation, namely $(2n+1)c$, is proved directly by a\nseries of row operations on matrices appeared in the $n$-fold Darboux\ntransformation. Here the positive constant $c$ denotes the height of the\nasymptotical plane of the rogue wave.\n", "  We have used effective reaction rates (ERR) for the helium burning reactions\nto predict the yield of the gamma-emitting nuclei 26Al, 44Ti, and 60Fe in core\ncol- lapse supernovae. The variations in the predicted yields for values of the\nreaction rates allowed by the ERR are much smaller than obtained previously,\nand smaller than other uncertainties. A \"filter\" for supernova nucleosynthesis\nyields based on pre-supernova structure was used to estimate the effect of\nfailed supernovae on the initial mass function-averaged yields; this\nsubstantially reduced the yields of all these isotopes, but the predicted yield\nratio 60Fe/26Al was little affected. The robustness of this ratio is promising\nfor comparison with data, but it is larger than observed in nature; possible\ncauses for this discrepancy are discussed.\n", "  DEAP-3600 uses liquid argon contained in a spherical acrylic vessel as a\ntarget medium to perform a sensitive spin-independent dark matter search. Argon\nscintillates in the vacuum ultraviolet spectrum, which requires wavelength\nshifting to convert the VUV photons to visible so they can be transmitted\nthrough the acrylic light guides and detected by the surrounding\nphotomultiplier tubes. The wavelength shifter 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene\nwas evaporatively deposited to the inner surface of the acrylic vessel under\nvacuum. Two evaporations were performed on the DEAP-3600 acrylic vessel with an\nestimated coating thickness of 3.00 $\\pm$ 0.02 $\\mu$m which is successfully\nwavelength shifting with liquid argon in the detector. Details on the\nwavelength shifter coating requirements, deposition source, testing, and final\nperformance are presented.\n", "  Recently first principles microscopic calculations, using the generalized\ngradient approximation, appeared for the solid mixed system $AgCl{_x}Br_{1-x}$\nat various compositions. Here, we suggest a model that can estimate the\ncompressibility of the mixed crystals in terms of the compressibilities of the\nend members alone. This model makes use of a single parameter, i.e., the\ncompressibility of a defect volume, when considering the volume variation\nproduced by the addition of a \"foreign molecule\" to a host crystal as a defect\nvolume.\n", "  Fragmentation cross section of $^{28}$Si + $^{9}$Be reaction at 75.8 MeV/u\nwas analyzed for studying the decay mode of single-proton emission in $^{21}$Al\n(the proton-rich nucleus with neutron closed-shell of $N = 8$ and $T_z =\n-5/2$). With the comparison between the measured fragmentation cross section\nand the theoretical cross section produced by EPAX3.1a for the observed nuclei\n(i.e. $^{20}$Mg, $^{21}$Al and $^{22}$Si), the expected yield for a particle\nstable $^{21}$Al was estimated. With the exponential decay law, an upper limit\nof half-life of $13$ ns was determined. Using the single-proton penetration\nmodel, the upper limit of single-proton separation energy of $-105$ keV was\ndeduced. This deduced mass limit agrees with the microscopic calculation based\non nucleon-nucleon (NN) + three-nucleon (3N) forces in $sdf_{7/2}p_{3/2}$\nvalence space, which indicates the importance of 3N forces in $^{21}$Al.\n", "  These lecture notes provide an introduction to the theoretical concepts of\nflavour physics and CP violation, based on a series of lectures given at the\nESHEP 2016 summer school. In the first lecture we review the basics of flavour\nand CP violation in the Standard Model. The second lecture is dedicated to the\nphenomenology of K and B meson decays, where we focus on a few representative\nobservables. In the third lecture we give an introduction to flavour physics\nbeyond the Standard Model, both within the framework of Minimal Flavour\nViolation and beyond.\n", "  We present a new model-independent strategy for testing the\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker metric and constraining cosmic\ncurvature, based on future time delay measurements of strongly lensed\nquasar-elliptical galaxy systems from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and\nsupernova observations from the Dark Energy Survey. The test only relies on\ngeometric optics. It is independent of the energy contents of the universe and\nthe validity of the Einstein equation on cosmological scales. The study\ncomprises two levels: testing the FLRW metric through the Distance Sum Rule and\ndetermining/constraining cosmic curvature. We propose an effective and\nefficient (redshift) evolution model for performing the former test, which\nallows us to concretely specify the violation criterion for the FLRW Distance\nSum Rule. If the FLRW metric is consistent with the observations, then, on the\nsecond level, the cosmic curvature parameter will be constrained to $\\sim0.057$\nor $\\sim0.041$ ($1\\sigma$), depending on the availability of high-redshift\nsupernovae, much more stringent than current model-independent techniques. We\nalso show that the bias in the time delay method might be well controlled,\nleading to robust results. The proposed method is a new independent tool for\nboth testing the fundamental assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy in\ncosmology and for determining cosmic curvature. It is complementary to cosmic\nmicrowave background plus baryon acoustic oscillation analyses, which normally\nassume a cosmological model with dark energy domination in the late-time\nuniverse.\n", "  In this paper we investigate how so-called quorum-sensing networks can be\nde-synchronized. Such networks, which arise in many important application\nfields such as systems biology, are characterized by the fact that direct\ncommunication between network nodes is superimposed to communication with a\nshared, environmental, variable. In particular, we provide a new sufficient\ncondition ensuring that the trajectories of these quorum-sensing networks\ndiverge from their synchronous evolution. Then, we apply our result to study\ntwo applications.\n", "  The diffusive shock acceleration scenario is usually invoked to explain radio\nrelics, although the detailed driving mechanism is still a matter of debate.\nOur aim is to constrain models for the origin of radio relics by comparing\nobserved relic samples with simulated ones. Here we present a framework to\nhomogeneously extract the whole sample of known radio relics from NVSS so that\nit can be used for comparison with cosmological simulations. In this way, we\ncan better handle intrinsic biases in the analysis of the radio relic\npopulation. In addition, we show some properties of the resulting NVSS sample\nrelics such as the correlation between relic shape and orientation with respect\nto the cluster. Also, we briefly discuss the typical relic surface brightness\nand its relation to projected cluster distance and relic angular sizes.\n", "  We review the most general scalar-tensor cosmological models with up to\nsecond-order derivatives in the field equations that have a fixed spatially\nflat de Sitter critical point independent of the material content or vacuum\nenergy. This subclass of the Horndeski Lagrangian is capable of dynamically\nadjusting any value of the vacuum energy of the matter fields at the critical\npoint. We present the cosmological evolution of the linear models and the\nnon-linear models with shift symmetry. We come to the conclusion that the shift\nsymmetric non-linear models can deliver a viable background compatible with\ncurrent observations.\n", "  Mechanisms controlling excitation energy transport (EET) in light-harvesting\ncomplexes remain controversial. Following the observation of long-lived beats\nin two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the\ndelocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant\nvibration, has been proposed to enable direct down-conversion from the\nhighest-energy states to the lowest-energy pigments. Here, we instead show that\nfor phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at\nplay. We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio\nQM/MM nuclear dynamics. Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental\nobservations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales\nand selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption\nmeasurements. We demonstrate that bilin solvation controls EET pathways and\nthat direct down-conversion proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large\nreorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations. We\nthus suggest that engineering local solvation dynamics represents a potential\ndesign principle for nanoscale control of EET.\n", "  The present work deals with the study of structural, ferroelectric,\ndielectric and electro-caloric effects in lead free ferroelectric\npolycrystalline Ba1-xCaxTi0.95Sn0.05O3 (x= 2, 5 and 10 %) i.e., Ca, Sn co-doped\nBaTiO3 (BTO). Phase purity of the samples is confirmed from X-ray data by using\nRietveld refinement. 119Sn M\\\"ossbauer reveals homogenous phase as well as\niso-valent substitution of Sn at Ti site. Enhancements in ferroelectric and\ndielectric properties have been observed. Indirect method which is based on\nMaxwell equation has been used to determine the electro-caloric (EC) effect in\nthe studied ferroelectric ceramics and maximum EC coefficient is observed for\nBa0.95Ca0.05Ti0.95Sn0.05O3.\n", "  Low dimensional material systems provide a unique set of properties useful\nfor solid-state devices. The building block of these devices is the PN\njunction. In this work, we present a dramatic difference in the electrostatics\nof PN junctions in lower dimensional systems, as against the well understood\nthree dimensional systems. Reducing the dimensionality increases the depletion\nwidth significantly. We propose a novel method to derive analytic equations in\n2D and 1D that considers the impact of neutral regions. The analytical results\nshow an excellent match with both the experimental measurements and numerical\nsimulations. The square root dependence of the depletion width on the ratio of\ndielectric constant and doping in 3D changes to a linear and exponential\ndependence for 2D and 1D respectively. This higher sensitivity of 1D PN\njunctions to its control parameters can be used towards new sensors.\n", "  Segmented aperture telescopes require an alignment procedure with successive\nsteps from coarse alignment to monitoring process in order to provide very high\noptical quality images for stringent science operations such as exoplanet\nimaging. The final step, referred to as fine phasing, calls for a high\nsensitivity wavefront sensing and control system in a diffraction-limited\nregime to achieve segment alignment with nanometric accuracy. In this context,\nZernike wavefront sensors represent promising options for such a calibration. A\nconcept called the Zernike unit for segment phasing (ZEUS) was previously\ndeveloped for ground-based applications to operate under seeing-limited images.\nSuch a concept is, however, not suitable for fine cophasing with\ndiffraction-limited images. We revisit ZELDA, a Zernike sensor that was\ndeveloped for the measurement of residual aberrations in exoplanet direct\nimagers, to measure segment piston, tip, and tilt in the diffraction-limited\nregime. We introduce a novel analysis scheme of the sensor signal that relies\non piston, tip, and tilt estimators for each segment, and provide probabilistic\ninsights to predict the success of a closed-loop correction as a function of\nthe initial wavefront error. The sensor unambiguously and simultaneously\nretrieves segment piston and tip-tilt misalignment. Our scheme allows for\ncorrection of these errors in closed-loop operation down to nearly zero\nresiduals in a few iterations. This sensor also shows low sensitivity to\nmisalignment of its parts and high ability for operation with a relatively\nbright natural guide star. Our cophasing sensor relies on existing mask\ntechnologies that make the concept already available for segmented apertures in\nfuture space missions.\n", "  We present here a model of carrier distribution and transport in\nsemiconductor alloys accounting for quantum localization effects in disordered\nmaterials. This model is based on the recent development of a mathematical\ntheory of quantum localization which introduces for each type of carrier a\nspatial function called \\emph{localization landscape}. These landscapes allow\nus to predict the localization regions of electron and hole quantum states,\ntheir corresponding energies, and the local densities of states. We show how\nthe various outputs of these landscapes can be directly implemented into a\ndrift-diffusion model of carrier transport and into the calculation of\nabsorption/emission transitions. This creates a new computational model which\naccounts for disorder localization effects while also capturing two major\neffects of quantum mechanics, namely the reduction of barrier height (tunneling\neffect), and the raising of energy ground states (quantum confinement effect),\nwithout having to solve the Schr\\\"odinger equation. Finally, this model is\napplied to several one-dimensional structures such as single quantum wells,\nordered and disordered superlattices, or multi-quantum wells, where comparisons\nwith exact Schr\\\"odinger calculations demonstrate the excellent accuracy of the\napproximation provided by the landscape theory.\n", "  We investigate the effect of annealing temperature on the crystalline\nstructure and physical properties of tantalum-pentoxide films grown by radio\nfrequency magnetron sputtering. For this purpose, several tantalum films were\ndeposited and the Ta$_2$O$_5$ crystalline phase was induced by exposing the\nsamples to heat treatments in air in the temperature range from (575 to\n1000)$^\\circ$C. Coating characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction,\nscanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and UV-VIS spectroscopy. By\nX-ray diffraction analysis we found that a hexagonal Ta$_2$O$_5$ phase\ngenerates at temperatures above $675^\\circ$C. As the annealing temperature\nraises, we observe peak sharpening and new peaks in the corresponding\ndiffraction patterns indicating a possible structural transition from hexagonal\nto orthorhombic. The microstructure of the films starts with flake-like\nstructures formed on the surface and evolves, as the temperature is further\nincreased, to round grains. We found out that, according to the features\nexhibited in the corresponding spectra, Raman spectroscopy can be sensitive\nenough to discriminate between the orthorhombic and hexagonal phases of\nTa$_2$O$_5$. Finally, as the films crystallize the magnitude of the optical\nband gap increases from 2.4 eV to the typical reported value of 3.8 eV.\n", "  In a Low Energy Beam Transport line (LEBT), the emittance growth due to the\nbeam's own space charge is typically suppressed by way of neutralization from\neither electrons or ions, which originate from ionization of the background\ngas. In cases where the beam is chopped, the neutralization pattern changes\nthroughout the beginning of the pulse, causing the Twiss parameters to differ\nsignificantly from their steady state values, which, in turn, may result in\nbeam losses downstream. For a modest beam perveance, there is an alternative\nsolution, in which the beam is kept un-neutralized in the portion of the LEBT\nthat contains the chopper. The emittance can be nearly preserved if the\ntransition to the un-neutralized section occurs where the beam exhibits low\ntransverse tails. This report discusses the experimental realization of such a\nscheme at Fermilab's PXIE, where low beam emittance dilution was demonstrated.\n", "  Urbach tails in semiconductors are often associated to effects of\ncompositional disorder. The Urbach tail observed in InGaN alloy quantum wells\nof solar cells and LEDs by biased photocurrent spectroscopy is shown to be\ncharacteristic of the ternary alloy disorder. The broadening of the absorption\nedge observed for quantum wells emitting from violet to green (indium content\nranging from 0 to 28\\%) corresponds to a typical Urbach energy of 20~meV. A 3D\nabsorption model is developed based on a recent theory of disorder-induced\nlocalization which provides the effective potential seen by the localized\ncarriers without having to resort to the solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nin a disordered potential. This model incorporating compositional disorder\naccounts well for the experimental broadening of the Urbach tail of the\nabsorption edge. For energies below the Urbach tail of the InGaN quantum wells,\ntype-II well-to-barrier transitions are observed and modeled. This contribution\nto the below bandgap absorption is particularly efficient in near-UV emitting\nquantum wells. When reverse biasing the device, the well-to-barrier below\nbandgap absorption exhibits a red shift, while the Urbach tail corresponding to\nthe absorption within the quantum wells is blue shifted, due to the partial\ncompensation of the internal piezoelectric fields by the external bias. The\ngood agreement between the measured Urbach tail and its modeling by the new\nlocalization theory demonstrates the applicability of the latter to\ncompositional disorder effects in nitride semiconductors.\n", "  The intricate interplay of interactions and Fermiology can give rise to a\nclose competition between nodeless (e.g. s-wave) and nodal (e.g. d-wave) order\nin electronically driven unconventional superconductors. We analyze how such a\nscenario is affected by a Zeeman magnetic field $H_{\\text{Z}}$ and temperature\n$T$. In the neighborhood of a zero temperature first order critical point\nseparating a nodal from a nodeless phase, the phase boundary at low\n$H_{\\text{Z}}$ and/or low $T$ has a universal line shape cubic in\n$H_{\\text{Z}}$ or $T$, such that the nodal state is stabilized at the expense\nof the nodeless. We calculate this line shape for a model of competing\ns_\\pm-wave and d-wave pairing in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  In the last decades, mobility planning has been a fundamental issue for the\ndevelopment of cities. A full knowledge of the way a mobility system influences\nthe traffic behavior of a whole city is needed in order to propose plans\naligned with the municipalities' goals. In particular, a tool to compare\ndifferent plans and the respective costs and benefits is necessary to forecast\nthe consequences of the changes in mobility plans. The aim of this research is\nto show how two different mobility models can be compared, based on different\nplans, and how to use this comparison strategy to develop or review a mobility\nplan. As a case study we analyzed the city of Barcelona, where in the last 10\nyears the municipality applied a new urban mobility plan, reviewed every 5\nyears (PMU 2007 and 2012). By using MATSim simulation tools, we realized two\nmodels of the infrastructure network: in both we built metro, train, tram and\ncar networks. The main differences between the two models are the speed limit\nof the car network and the presence or absence of the bicycle network. The\nresults show that if we set low speed limits and increase bike infrastructures,\nthe average travel time decreases and the number of users of the bicycle\nnetwork increases to the detriment of public and private transport. In\nparticular, we show that the number of users of public transport decreases more\nthan the private transport users. This behavior is related to the lack of the\nbus network, not simulated in these models, suggesting that the metro network\nworks properly only when it is integrated with a bus network.\n", "  This paper introduces a novel method to account for quantum disorder effects\ninto the classical drift-diffusion model of semiconductor transport through the\nlocalization landscape theory. Quantum confinement and quantum tunneling in the\ndisordered system change dramatically the energy barriers acting on the\nperpendicular transport of heterostructures. In addition they lead to\npercolative transport through paths of minimal energy in the 2D landscape of\ndisordered energies of multiple 2D quantum wells. This model solves the carrier\ndynamics with quantum effects self-consistently and provides a computationally\nmuch faster solver when compared with the Schr\\\"odinger equation resolution.\nThe theory also provides a good approximation to the density of states for the\ndisordered system over the full range of energies required to account for\ntransport at room-temperature. The current-voltage characteristics modeled by\n3-D simulation of a full nitride-based light-emitting diode (LED) structure\nwith compositional material fluctuations closely match the experimental\nbehavior of high quality blue LEDs. The model allows also a fine analysis of\nthe quantum effects involved in carrier transport through such complex\nheterostructures. Finally, details of carrier population and recombination in\nthe different quantum wells are given.\n", "  We review the methods to combine several measurements, in the form of\nparameter values or $p$-values.\n", "  M dwarf stars, which have masses less than 60 per cent that of the Sun, make\nup 75 per cent of the population of the stars in the Galaxy [1]. The\natmospheres of orbiting Earth-sized planets are observationally accessible via\ntransmission spectroscopy when the planets pass in front of these stars [2,3].\nStatistical results suggest that the nearest transiting Earth-sized planet in\nthe liquid-water, habitable zone of an M dwarf star is probably around 10.5\nparsecs away [4]. A temperate planet has been discovered orbiting Proxima\nCentauri, the closest M dwarf [5], but it probably does not transit and its\ntrue mass is unknown. Seven Earth-sized planets transit the very low-mass star\nTRAPPIST-1, which is 12 parsecs away [6,7], but their masses and, particularly,\ntheir densities are poorly constrained. Here we report observations of LHS\n1140b, a planet with a radius of 1.4 Earth radii transiting a small, cool star\n(LHS 1140) 12 parsecs away. We measure the mass of the planet to be 6.6 times\nthat of Earth, consistent with a rocky bulk composition. LHS 1140b receives an\ninsolation of 0.46 times that of Earth, placing it within the liquid-water,\nhabitable zone [8]. With 90 per cent confidence, we place an upper limit on the\norbital eccentricity of 0.29. The circular orbit is unlikely to be the result\nof tides and therefore was probably present at formation. Given its large\nsurface gravity and cool insolation, the planet may have retained its\natmosphere despite the greater luminosity (compared to the present-day) of its\nhost star in its youth [9,10]. Because LHS 1140 is nearby, telescopes currently\nunder construction might be able to search for specific atmospheric gases in\nthe future [2,3].\n", "  Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of $T$- and $Y$-systems, arising in\nthe thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Zamolodchikov integrability was recently\nconsidered as its affine analog in our joint work with P. Pylyavskyy. Here we\nprove periodicity and integrability for similar discrete dynamical systems\nbased on the cube recurrence, also known as the discrete BKP equation. The\nperiodicity part was conjectured by Henriques in 2007.\n", "  We study inverse boundary problems for the advection diffusion equation on an\nadmissible manifold, i.e. a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary of\ndimension $\\ge 3$, which is conformally embedded in a product of the Euclidean\nreal line and a simple manifold. We prove the unique identifiability of the\nadvection term of class $H^1\\cap L^\\infty$ and of class $H^{2/3}\\cap C^{0,1/3}$\nfrom the knowledge of the associated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on the boundary\nof the manifold. This seems to be the first global identifiability result for\npossibly discontinuous advection terms.\n", "  Biochemical reaction networks frequently consist of species evolving on\nmultiple timescales. Stochastic simulations of such networks are often\ncomputationally challenging and therefore various methods have been developed\nto obtain sensible stochastic approximations on the timescale of interest. One\nof the rigorous and popular approaches is the multiscale approximation method\nfor continuous time Markov processes. In this approach, by scaling species\nabundances and reaction rates, a family of processes parameterized by a scaling\nparameter is defined. The limiting process of this family is then used to\napproximate the original process. However, we find that such approximations\nbecome inaccurate when combinations of species with disparate abundances either\nconstitute conservation laws or form virtual slow auxiliary species. To obtain\nmore accurate approximation in such cases, we propose here an appropriate\nmodification of the original method.\n", "  The behavior of Fano resonance and the reversal of near field optical binding\nforce of dimers over different substrates have not been studied so far. In this\nwork, we observe that if the closely located plasmonic cube homodimers over\nglass or high permittivity dielectric substrate are illuminated with plane wave\npolarized parallel to dimer axis, no reversal of optical binding force occurs.\nBut if we apply the same set-up over a plasmonic substrate, stable Fano\nresonance occurs along with the reversal of near field binding force. It is\nobserved that during such Fano resonance stronger coupling occurs between the\ndimers and plasmonic substrate along with the strong enhancement of the\nsubstrate current. Such near field binding force reversals of plasmonic cube\ndimers have been explained based on the observed unusual behavior of optical\nLorentz force during the induced stronger Fano resonance and the dipole-dipole\nresonance. Although previously reported reversals of near field optical binding\nforces were highly sensitive to particle size/shape (i.e. for heterodimers) and\ninter-particle distance, our configuration provides much relaxation of those\nparameters and hence should be verified experimentally with simpler\nexperimental set-ups.\n", "  The viscoelastic behavior of composites consisting of spindle-shaped hematite\nparticles in poly-N-isopropylacrylamide hydrogels is investigated both, by\nmeans of rheological oscillatory shear experiments, and the field-induced\nalignment of these mesoscale, anisotropic particles in external magnetic\nfields. Due to their magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy hematite spindles\nalign with their long axis perpendicular to the direction of an external\nmagnetic field. The field induced torque acting on the magnetic particles leads\nto an elastic deformation of the hydrogel matrix. Thus, the field-dependent\norientational distribution functions of anisotropic particles acting as\nmicrorheological probes depend on the elastic modulus of the hydrogel matrix.\nThe orientational distribution functions are determined by means of Small Angle\nX-ray Scattering experiments in presence of external magnetic fields. With\nincreasing elasticity of the hydrogels, tuned via the polymer volume fraction\nand the crosslinking density, the field-induced alignment of these anisotropic,\nmagnetic particles is progressively hindered. The microrheological results are\nin accordance to macrorheological experiments indicating increasing elasticity\nwith increasing flux density of an external field.\n", "  In the late 1620s the Neapolitan telescope maker Francesco Fontana was the\nfirst to observe the sky using a telescope with two convex lenses, which he had\nmanufactured himself. Fontana succeeded in drawing the most accurate maps of\nthe Moon's surface of his time, which were to become popular through a number\nof publications spread all over Europe but without acknowledging the author. At\nthe end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to\ndefend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observational campaign,\nwhose results he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque\nrerum Observationis (1646), the only book he left to posterity. Fontana\nobserved the Moon's main craters, as the crater Tycho which he named Fons\nMajor, their radial patterns and the change in their positions due to the\nMoon's motions. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together\nwith the Jesuit G.B. Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana\nobserved the two - and occasionally three - major bands of Jupiter, and\ninferred the rotation movement of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn,\narguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close\nto revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of\nadditional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that\nlasted more than a hundred years. In several places of his book Fontana\nrepeatedly claimed to have conceived the first positive eyepiece in 1608,\nproviding a declaration by Zupus to have used his telescope since 1614. This\ndeclaration is still the oldest record mentioning such a device. We finally\nsuggest that the telescopes depicted in the two Allegory of Sight by J.\nBrueghel the Elder belonging to Albert VII might have been made by Fontana, and\nthat he might have inspired the Sight by Jusepe Ribera (c. 1616).\n", "  We introduce a multimodel approach to the simulation of the optical\nproperties of molecular dyes in solution, whereby the effects of thermal\nfluctuations and of dielectric screening on the absorption spectra are\naccounted for by explicit and implicit solvation models, respectively. Thermal\neffects are treated by averaging the spectra of molecular configurations\ngenerated by an ab initio molecular-dynamics simulation where solvent molecules\nare treated explicitly. Dielectric effects are then dealt with implicitly by\ncomputing the spectra upon removal of the solvent molecules and their\nreplacement with an effective medium, in the spirit of a continuum solvation\nmodel. Our multimodel approach is validated by comparing its predictions with\nthose of a fully explicit-solvation simulation for cyanidin-3-glucoside\n(cyanin) chromophore in water. While multimodel and fully explicit-solvent\nspectra may differ considerably for individual configurations along the\ntrajectory, their time averages are remarkably similar, thus providing a solid\nbenchmark of the former and allowing us to save considerably on the computer\nresources needed to predict accurate absorption spectra. The power of the\nproposed methodology is finally demonstrated by the excellent agreement between\nits predictions and the absorption spectra of cyanin measured at strong and\nintermediate acidity conditions.\n", "  The atmospheric pressure fluctuations on Mars induce an elastic response in\nthe ground that creates a ground tilt, detectable as a seismic signal on the\nInSight seismometer SEIS. The seismic pressure noise is modeled using Large\nEddy Simulations of the wind and surface pressure at the InSight landing site\nand a Green's function ground deformation approach that is subsequently\nvalidated via a detailed comparison with two other methods based on Sorrells'\ntheory (Sorrels 1971; Sorrels et al. 1971). The horizontal acceleration as a\nresult of the ground tilt due to the LES turbulence-induced pressure\nfluctuations are found to be typically ~2 - 40 nm/s^2 in amplitude, whereas the\ndirect horizontal acceleration is two orders of magnitude smaller and is thus\nnegligible in comparison. The vertical accelerations are found to be ~0.1 - 6\nnm/s^2 in amplitude.\n  We show that under calm conditions, a single-pressure measurement is\nrepresentative of the large-scale pressure field (to a distance of several\nkilometers), particularly in the prevailing wind direction. However, during\nwindy conditions, small-scale turbulence results in a reduced correlation\nbetween the pressure signals, and the single-pressure measurement becomes less\nrepresentative of the pressure field. Nonetheless, the correlation between the\nseismic signal and the pressure signal is found to be higher for the windiest\nperiod because the seismic pressure noise reflects the atmospheric structure\nclose to the seismometer. In the same way that we reduce the atmospheric\nseismic signal by making use of a pressure sensor that is part of the InSight\nAPSS (Auxiliary Payload Sensor Suite), we also the use the synthetic noise data\nobtained from the LES pressure field to demonstrate a decorrelation strategy.\n", "  We have compiled a new multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) for\nthe closest obscured low-ionization emission-line region active galactic\nnucleus (AGN), NGC 4736, also known as M94. The SED comprises mainly\nhigh-resolution (mostly sub-arcsecond, or, at the distance to M94, <23 pc from\nthe nucleus) observations from the literature, archival data, as well as\npreviously unpublished sub-millimetre data from the Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer (PdBI) and the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave\nAstronomy, in conjunction with new electronic MultiElement Radio\nInterferometric Network (e-MERLIN) L-band (1.5 GHz) observations. Thanks to the\ne-MERLIN resolution and sensitivity, we resolve for the first time a double\nstructure composed of two radio sources separated by ~1 arcsec, previously\nobserved only at higher frequency. We explore this data set, which further\nincludes non-simultaneous data from the Very Large Array, the Gemini telescope,\nthe Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray observatory, in terms of an\noutflow-dominated model. We compare our results with previous trends found for\nother AGN using the same model (NGC 4051, M81*, M87 and Sgr A*), as well as\nhard- and quiescent-state X-ray binaries. We find that the nuclear broad-band\nspectrum of M94 is consistent with a relativistic outflow of low inclination.\nThe findings in this work add to the growing body of evidence that the physics\nof weakly accreting black holes scales with mass in a rather straightforward\nfashion.\n", "  Methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite solar cell is a gem in\nthe list of photovoltaic semiconductors. Although there are numerous\nfundamental and technological questions yet to be addressed covering various\naspects of this system for its commercialization, this study has employed\nfirst-principles DFT to model the [PbI6(CH3NH3)n]m zero-dimensional\nnanoclusters. Using the calculated binding energy landscapes, it has answered\nthe question: why the corner-sharing PbI6 octahedron is surrounded by eight\nunits of the organic cation in the large-scale supramolecular structures of the\nCH3NH3PbI3 system in 3D? The synergistic effect of the methylammonium, as well\nas the consequence of positive and negative cooperative effects associated with\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding on the supramolecular evolution of the\nCH3NH3PbI3 crystals is briefly outlined.\n", "  Background: For newborn infants in critical care, continuous monitoring of\nbrain function can help identify infants at-risk of brain injury. Quantitative\nfeatures allow a consistent and reproducible approach to EEG analysis, but only\nwhen all implementation aspects are clearly defined.\n  Methods: We detail quantitative features frequently used in neonatal EEG\nanalysis and present a Matlab software package together with exact\nimplementation details for all features. The feature set includes stationary\nfeatures that capture amplitude and frequency characteristics and features of\ninter-hemispheric connectivity. The software, a Neonatal Eeg featURe set in\nmAtLab (NEURAL), is open source and freely available. The software also\nincludes a pre-processing stage with a basic artefact removal procedure.\n  Conclusions: NEURAL provides a common platform for quantitative analysis of\nneonatal EEG. This will support reproducible research and enable comparisons\nacross independent studies. These features present summary measures of the EEG\nthat can also be used in automated methods to determine brain development and\nhealth of the newborn in critical care.\n", "  Accurate delineation of the left ventricle (LV) is an important step in\nevaluation of cardiac function. In this paper, we present an automatic method\nfor segmentation of the LV in cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) scans. Segmentation\nis performed in two stages. First, a bounding box around the LV is detected\nusing a combination of three convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nSubsequently, to obtain the segmentation of the LV, voxel classification is\nperformed within the defined bounding box using a CNN. The study included CCTA\nscans of sixty patients, fifty scans were used to train the CNNs for the LV\nlocalization, five scans were used to train LV segmentation and the remaining\nfive scans were used for testing the method. Automatic segmentation resulted in\nthe average Dice coefficient of 0.85 and mean absolute surface distance of 1.1\nmm. The results demonstrate that automatic segmentation of the LV in CCTA scans\nusing voxel classification with convolutional neural networks is feasible.\n", "  The properties of curl and gradient of divergence operators in the domain $G$\nof three-dimensional space are described. The self-conjugacy of these operators\nin the subspaces $\\mathbf{L}_{2}(G) $ and the basis property of the system of\neigenfunctions are discussed. Exact formulas are founded for solving boundary\nvalue problems in a ball and the conditions for the decomposition of vector\nfunctions into Fourier series in eigenfunctions of the curl and the gradient of\ndivergence operators.\n", "  We propose a scheme to enhance the effective photonic bandwidth exploiting\nbandgap overlapping of same order or different orders through judiciously\nchosen aperiodic geometries is spatial dimension. To implement the scheme, we\ndesign a specialty optical fiber with hybrid chirped-cladding. Our designed\nfiber provides an ultra-wide photonic bandwidth of ~ 3 micron. The less\ndispersive behavior of the structure carries the signature of zero dispersion\nat ~2.7micron. The proposed two material all-solid fiber geometry is based on\nthermally compatible chalcogenide glasses, GeAsSe and AsSe as low and high\nindex respectively. The efficient delivery of short pulses with less\ndistortion, and enhanced frequency broadening of specific pulses at certain\nconditions are demonstrated through these specialty fibers.\n", "  We show that applying the Lorentz-Lorenz transformation to the refractive\nindex of metals, semiconductors and insulators allows for a less empirical\nmodeling of this refractive index.\n", "  The WC9-Type Wolf-Rayet star WR 76 is one of the most prolific dust makers\nidentified from its infrared emission. WR 76 experienced a deep fading eclipse\nin 2016. The ~3.1 magnitude depth of the eclipse exceeds fadings in similar\neclipses observed in WR stars thus far. Conclusions from recent and earlier\nanalyses of eclipses observed suggests that WR 76 may be a prolific eclipser.\n", "  Let $L$ be a periodic self-adjoint linear elliptic operator in $\\R^n$ with\ncoefficients periodic with respect to a lattice $\\G$, e.g. Schr\\\"{o}dinger\noperator $(i^{-1}\\partial/\\partial_x-A(x))^2+V(x)$ with periodic magnetic and\nelectric potentials $A,V$, or a Maxwell operator $\\nabla\\times\\varepsilon\n(x)^{-1}\\nabla\\times$ in a periodic medium. Let also $S$ be a finite part of\nits spectrum separated by gaps from the rest of the spectrum. We address here\nthe question of existence of a finite set of exponentially decaying Wannier\nfunctions $w_j(x)$ such that their $\\G$-shifts $w_{j,\\g}(x)=w_j(x-\\g)$ for\n$\\g\\in\\G$ span the whole spectral subspace corresponding to $S$. It was shown\nby D.~Thouless in 1984 that a topological obstruction sometimes exists to\nfinding exponentially decaying $w_{j,\\g}$ that form an orthonormal (or any)\nbasis of the spectral subspace. This obstruction has the form of non-triviality\nof certain finite dimensional (with the dimension equal to the number of\nspectral bands in $S$) analytic vector bundle (Bloch bundle). It was shown in\n2009 by one of the authors that it is always possible to find a finite number\n$l$ of exponentially decaying Wannier functions $w_j$ such that their\n$\\G$-shifts form a tight (Parseval) frame in the spectral subspace. This\nappears to be the best one can do when the topological obstruction is present.\nHere we significantly improve the estimate on the number of extra Wannier\nfunctions needed, showing that in physical dimensions the number $l$ can be\nchosen equal to $m+1$, i.e. only one extra family of Wannier functions is\nrequired. This is the lowest number possible in the presence of the topological\nobstacle. The result for dimension four is also stated (without a proof), in\nwhich case $m+2$ functions are needed.\n  The main result of the paper was announced without a proof in Bull. AMS, July\n2016.\n", "  Network embedding which encodes all vertices in a network as a set of\nnumerical vectors in accordance with it's local and global structures, has\ndrawn widespread attention. Network embedding not only learns significant\nfeatures of a network, such as the clustering and linking prediction but also\nlearns the latent vector representation of the nodes which provides theoretical\nsupport for a variety of applications, such as visualization, node\nclassification, and recommendation. As the latest progress of the research,\nseveral algorithms based on random walks have been devised. Although their high\nscores for learning efficiency and accuracy have drawn much attention, there is\nstill a lack of theoretical explanation, and the transparency of the algorithms\nhas been doubted. Here, we propose an approach based on the open-flow network\nmodel to reveal the underlying flow structure and its hidden metric space of\ndifferent random walk strategies on networks. We show that the essence of\nembedding based on random walks is the latent metric structure defined on the\nopen-flow network. This not only deepens our understanding of random walk based\nembedding algorithms but also helps in finding new potential applications in\nembedding.\n", "  Heterointerfaces of SrTiO$_{3}$ with other transition metal oxides make up an\nintriguing family of systems with a bounty of coexisting and competing physical\norders. Some examples, such as LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$, support a high carrier\ndensity electron gas at the interface whose electronic properties are\ndetermined by a combination of lattice distortions, spin-orbit coupling,\ndefects, and various regimes of magnetic and charge ordering. Here, we study\nelectronic transport in mesoscale devices made with heterostructures of\nSrTiO$_{3}$ sandwiched between layers of SmTiO$_{3}$, in which the transport\nproperties can be tuned from a regime of Fermi-liquid like resistivity ($\\rho\n\\sim T^{2}$) to a non-Fermi liquid ($\\rho \\sim T^{5/3}$) by controlling the\nSrTiO$_{3}$ thickness. In mesoscale devices at low temperatures, we find\nunexpected voltage fluctuations that grow in magnitude as $T$ is decreased\nbelow 20 K, are suppressed with increasing contact electrode size, and are\nindependent of the drive current and contact spacing distance.\nMagnetoresistance fluctuations are also observed, which are reminiscent of\nuniversal conductance fluctuations but not entirely consistent with their\nconventional properties. Candidate explanations are considered, and a mechanism\nis suggested based on mesoscopic temporal fluctuations of the Seebeck\ncoefficient. An improved understanding of charge transport in these model\nsystems, especially their quantum coherent properties, may lead to insights\ninto the nature of transport in strongly correlated materials that deviate from\nFermi liquid theory.\n", "  Single magnetic skyrmions are localized whirls in the magnetization with an\ninteger winding number. They have been observed on nano-meter scales up to room\ntemperature in multilayer structures. Due to their small size, topological\nwinding number, and their ability to be manipulated by extremely tiny forces,\nthey are often called interesting candidates for future memory devices. The\ntwo-lane racetrack has to exhibit two lanes that are separated by an energy\nbarrier. The information is then encoded in the position of a skyrmion which is\nlocated in one of these close-by lanes. The artificial barrier between the\nlanes can be created by an additional nanostrip on top of the track. Here we\nstudy the dependence of the potential barrier on the shape of the additional\nnanostrip, calculating the potentials for a rectangular, triangular, and\nparabolic cross section, as well as interpolations between the first two. We\nfind that a narrow barrier is always repulsive and that the height of the\npotential strongly depends on the shape of the nanostrip, whereas the shape of\nthe potential is more universal. We finally show that the shape-dependence is\nredundant for possible applications.\n", "  The crucial but undocumented Dolan-McCrea variational method is richly\napplied. Using the said method, we analytically derived a field equation\ncomprising entirely of geometric structures and we investigate how effectively\nit describes gravitational and electromagnetic phenomena. The procedure we\nadopted involved constructing a scalar invariant as was the case for Einstein's\nGeneral Relativity (GR) except that the scalar of parameterized Absolute\nParallelism geometey consists of the Ricci scalar plus an additional term,\nwhich is essentially the contortion. %Based on earlier discourse, a good\nstarting point for this section would be the connections of the PAP-space.\n", "  The introduction of electromagnetic fields into the Boltzmann equation\nfollowing a 5D general relativistic approach is considered in order to\nestablish the transport equations for dilute charged fluids in the presence of\na weak electromagnetic field. The conserved 5D stress-energy tensor is\nevaluated using the J\\\"uttner function for non-degenerate relativistic gases in\nlocal equilibrium, and the evolution equations for the local thermodynamic\nvariables are established by means of relativistic kinetic theory. An outline\nof the possibilities offered by the Kaluza-type approach to MHD is also\nincluded.\n", "  Group-VI monochalcogenides are attracting a great deal of attention due to\ntheir peculiar anisotropic properties. Very recently, it has been suggested\nthat GeS could act as a promissory absorbing material with high input-output\nratios, relevant features for designing prospective optoelectronic devices. In\nthis work, we use the \\emph{ab-initio} many body perturbation theory to study\nthe role of the electron-phonon coupling on orthorhombic GeS. We identify the\nvibrational modes that efficiently couple with the electronic states\nresponsible for giving rise to the first and second excitonic state. We also\nstudy the finite-temperature optical absorption and show that even at $T\\to0K$,\nthe role of the electron-phonon interaction is crucial to properly describe the\nmain experimental excitation peaks position and width. Our results suggest that\nthe electron-phonon coupling is essential to properly describe the optical\nproperties of the monochalcogenides family.\n", "  We analyze a dataset providing the complete information on the effective\nplays of thousands of music listeners during several months. Our analysis\nconfirms a number of properties previously highlighted by research based on\ninterviews and questionnaires, but also uncover new statistical patterns, both\nat the individual and collective levels. In particular, we show that\nindividuals follow common listening rhythms characterized by the same\nfluctuations, alternating heavy and light listening periods, and can be\nclassified in four groups of similar sizes according to their temporal habits\n--- 'early birds', 'working hours listeners', 'evening listeners' and 'night\nowls'. We provide a detailed radioscopy of the listeners' interplay between\nrepeated listening and discovery of new content. We show that different genres\nencourage different listening habits, from Classical or Jazz music with a more\nbalanced listening among different songs, to Hip Hop and Dance with a more\nheterogeneous distribution of plays. Finally, we provide measures of how\ndistant people are from each other in terms of common songs. In particular, we\nshow that the number of songs $S$ a DJ should play to a random audience of size\n$N$ such that everyone hears at least one song he/she currently listens to, is\nof the form $S\\sim N^\\alpha$ where the exponent depends on the music genre and\nis in the range $[0.5,0.8]$. More generally, our results show that the recent\naccess to virtually infinite catalogs of songs does not promote exploration for\nnovelty, but that most users favor repetition of the same songs.\n", "  The Model Coupling Executable Library (MCEL), developed at the University of\nSouthern Mississippi's Center of Higher Learning, has been successfully used to\ncouple the Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and\nthe ocean wave model WAVEWATCH. An example of its application is shown for\nHurricane Gordon, showing that two-way coupling results affects boundary layer\nphysics differently than one-way coupling --- in this case, resulting in larger\nz_o and, consequently, larger surface fluxes and a more intense hurricane.\nHowever, since analyzing MCEL is difficult because the wave physics is\ninaccurate, improvements to the wave algorithms are also part of the\ndeliverables. A new analytical expression for the wind/wave growth factor has\nbeen derived based on normal modes analysis and rapid distortion theory valid\nfor all wave regimes except for tropical cyclone conditions. This new algorithm\nis validated against a numerical simulation of the Reynolds-stress transport\nequations and matches well. In contrast, other wave growth expression used in\nocean models like the WAve Model (WAM) and WAVEWATCH do not produce the same\nresults, with larger wave growth values peaking at smaller wave age values.\nThese differences are attributed to the application of curve fitting by the\nother algorithms, while the new formulation is an analytical expression derived\nfrom first principles and includes factors missing in previous schemes such as\nturbulent interaction. If the Reynolds-stress transport equations solutions are\nreasonably accurate, it indicates that all the previous wave growth schemes,\nincluding WAVEWATCH, have serious deficiencies. Another unique result from this\nwork includes a second analytical wave growth formulation valid for tropical\ncyclone conditions.\n"]}
