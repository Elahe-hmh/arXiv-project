Both circularly and linearly\npolarized pulses led to spin precessions; these phenomena are interpreted as\nthe inverse Faraday effect and the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect, respectively.\nFor both cases, the same mode of spin precession was excited; the precession\nfrequencies and polarization were the same, but the phases of oscillations were\ndifferent. We have shown theoretically and experimentally that the analysis of\nphases can distinguish between these two mechanisms. We have demonstrated\nexperimentally that in the visible region, the inverse Faraday effect was\ndominant, whereas the inverse Cotton-Mouton effect became relatively prominent\nin the near-infrared region.\n", "  We investigate the variational structure of discrete Laplace-type equations\nthat are motivated by discrete integrable quad-equations. In particular, we\nexplain why the reality conditions we consider should be all that are\nreasonable, and we derive sufficient conditions (that are often necessary) on\nthe labeling of the edges under which the corresponding generalized discrete\naction functional is convex. Convexity is an essential tool to discuss\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions to Dirichlet boundary value problems.\nFurthermore, we study which combinatorial data allow convex action functionals\nof discrete Laplace-type equations that are actually induced by discrete\nintegrable quad-equations, and we present how the equations and functionals\ncorresponding to (Q3) are related to circle patterns.\n", "  This paper concerns a fast, one-step iterative technique of imaging extended\nperfectly conducting cracks with Dirichlet boundary condition. In order to\nreconstruct the shape of cracks from scattered field data measured at the\nboundary, we introduce a topological derivative-based electromagnetic imaging\nfunction operated at several nonzero frequencies. The properties of the imaging\nfunction are carefully analyzed for the configurations of both symmetric and\nnon-symmetric incident field directions. This analysis explains why the\napplication of incident fields with symmetric direction operated at multiple\nfrequencies guarantees a successful reconstruction. Various numerical\nsimulations with noise-corrupted data are conducted to assess the performance,\neffectiveness, robustness, and limitations of the proposed technique.\n", "  Azimuthally anisotropic distributions of D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$ mesons\nwere studied in the central rapidity region ($|y|<0.8$) in Pb-Pb collisions at\na centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV per nucleon-nucleon\ncollision, with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The second Fourier coefficient\n$v_2$ (commonly denoted elliptic flow) was measured in the centrality class\n30-50% as a function of the D meson transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}$, in the\nrange 2-16 GeV/$c$. The measured $v_2$ of D mesons is comparable in magnitude\nto that of light-flavour hadrons. It is positive in the range $2 < p_{\\rm T} <\n6$ GeV/$c$ with $5.7\\sigma$ significance, based on the combination of\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties.\n", "  The inclusive $J/\\psi$ nuclear modification factor $R_{\\rm AA}$ in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$=2.76 TeV has been measured by ALICE as a\nfunction of centrality in the e$^+$e$^-$ decay channel at mid-rapidity\n$|y|<0.8$ and as a function of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity in\nthe $\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay channel at forward-rapidity $2.5<y<4$.The $J/\\psi$\nyields measured in Pb-Pb are suppressed compared to those in pp collisions\nscaled by the number of binary collisions. The $R_{\\rm AA}$ integrated over a\ncentrality range corresponding to 90% of the inelastic Pb-Pb cross section is\n$0.72\\pm0.06$ (stat.) $\\pm0.10$ (syst.) at mid-rapidity and $0.57 \\pm 0.01$\n(stat.) $\\pm0.09$ (syst.) at forward-rapidity. At low transverse momentum,\nsignificantly larger values of $R_{\\rm AA}$ are measured at forward-rapidity\ncompared to measurements at lower energy. These features suggest that a\ncontribution to the $J/\\psi$ yield originates from charm quarks (re)combination\nin the deconfined partonic medium.\n", "  In this manuscript we investigate quantum uncertainties in a Tsallis' non\nadditive scenario. To such an end we appeal to q-exponentials, that are the\ncornerstone of Tsallis' theory. In this respect, it is found that some new\nmathematics is needed and we are led to construct a set of novel special states\nthat are the q-exponential equivalents of the ordinary coherent states of the\nharmonic oscillator. We then characterize these new Tsallis' special states by\nobtaining the associated i) probability distributions for a state of momentum\n$k$, ii) mean values for some functions of space an momenta, and iii)\nconcomitant quantum uncertainties. The latter are then compared to the usual\nones.\n", "  We have measured the total kinetic energy (TKE) release for the\n$^{235}$U(n,f) reaction for $E_{n}$=2-100 MeV using the 2E method with an array\nof Si PIN diode detectors. The neutron energies were determined by time of\nflight measurements using the white spectrum neutron beam at the LANSCE\nfacility. (To calibrate the apparatus, the TKE release for\n$^{235}$U(n$_{th}$,f) was also measured using a thermal neutron beam from the\nOSU TRIGA reactor). The TKE decreases non-linearly from 169.0 MeV to 161.4 MeV\nfor $E_{n}$=2-90 MeV. The standard deviation of the TKE distribution is\nconstant from $E_{n}$=20-90 MeV. Comparison of the data with the multi-modal\nfission model of Brosa indicates the TKE decrease is a consequence of the\ngrowth of symmetric fission and the corresponding decrease of asymmetric\nfission with increasing neutron energy. The average TKE associated with the\nBrosa superlong, standard I and standard II modes for a given mass is\nindependent of neutron energy.\n", "  We report the results of a computational investigation of two blow-up\ncriteria for the 3D incompressible Euler equations. One criterion was proven in\na previous work, and a related criterion is proved here. These criteria are\nbased on an inviscid regularization of the Euler equations known as the 3D\nEuler-Voigt equations, which are known to be globally well-posed. Moreover,\nsimulations of the 3D Euler-Voigt equations also require less resolution than\nsimulations of the 3D Euler equations for fixed values of the regularization\nparameter $\\alpha>0$. Therefore, the new blow-up criteria allow one to gain\ninformation about possible singularity formation in the 3D Euler equations\nindirectly; namely, by simulating the better-behaved 3D Euler-Voigt equations.\nThe new criteria are only known to be sufficient for blow-up. Therefore, to\ntest the robustness of the inviscid-regularization approach, we also\ninvestigate analogous criteria for blow-up of the 1D Burgers equation, where\nblow-up is well-known to occur.\n", "  We study properties of particles with zero or negative energy and a nonzero\norbital angular momentum in the ergosphere of a rotating black hole. We show\nthat the sign of the particle energy is uniquely determined by the angular\nvelocity of its rotation in the ergosphere. We give a simple proof of the fact\nthat extreme black holes cannot exist. We investigate the question of the\npossibility of an unlimited energy increase in the center-of-mass system of two\ncolliding particles, one or both of which have negative or zero energy.\n", "  The Josephson effect is a fundamental quantum phenomenon consisting in the\nappearance of a dissipationless supercurrent in a weak link between two\nsuperconducting (S) electrodes. While the mechanism leading to the Josephson\neffect is quite general, i.e., Andreev reflections at the interface between the\nS electrodes and the weak link, the precise physical details and topology of\nthe junction drastically modify the properties of the supercurrent.\nSpecifically, a strong enhancement of the critical supercurrent $I_C$ is\nexpected to occur when the topology of the junction allows the emergence of\nMajorana bound states. Here we report charge transport measurements in\nmesoscopic Josephson junctions formed by InAs nanowires and Ti/Al\nsuperconducting leads. Our main observation is a colossal enhancement of the\ncritical supercurrent induced by an external magnetic field applied\nperpendicular to the substrate. This striking and anomalous supercurrent\nenhancement cannot be ascribed to any known conventional phenomenon existing in\nJosephson junctions including, for instance, Fraunhofer-like diffraction or a\n$\\pi$-state behavior. We also investigate an unconventional model related to\ninhomogenous Zeeman field caused by magnetic focusing, and note that it can not\naccount for the observed behaviour. Finally, we consider these results in the\ncontext of topological superconductivity, and show that the observed $I_C$\nenhancement is compatible with a magnetic field-induced topological transition\nof the junction.\n", "  We study the CP violation in the Higgs boson and toponia production process\nat the ILC where the toponia are produced near the threshold. With the\napproximation that the production vertex of the Higgs boson and toponia is\ncontact, and neglecting the P-wave toponia, we analytically calculated the\ndensity matrix for the production and decay of the toponia. Under these\nassumptions, the production spectrum of the toponia is solely determined by the\nspin quantum number, therefore the toponia can be either singlet or triplet. We\nfind that the production rate of the singlet toponium is highly suppressed, and\nbehaves just like the production of a P-wave toponia. In the case of the\ntriplet toponium, three completely independent CP observables, namely azimuthal\nangles of lepton and anti-lepton in the toponium rest-frame as well as their\nsum, are predicted based on our analytical results, and checked by using the\ntree-level event generator. The non-trivial correlations come from the\nlongitudinal-transverse interferences for the azimuthal angles of leptons, and\nthe transverse-transverse interference for their sum. These three observables\nare well defined at the ILC, where the rest frame of the toponium can be\nreconstructed directly. Furthermore, the QCD-strong corrections, which are\nimportant near the threshold region, are also studied with the approximation of\nspin-independent QCD-Coulomb potential. While the total cross section is\nenhanced, the spin correlations predicted in this paper are not affected.\n", "  We demonstrate that through localised Rydberg excitation in a\nthree-dimensional cold atom cloud atomic motion can be rendered directed and\nnearly confined to a plane, without spatial constraints for the motion of\nindividual atoms. This enables creation and observation of non-adiabatic\nelectronic Rydberg dynamics in atoms accelerated by dipole-dipole interactions\nunder natural conditions. Using the full $l=0,1$ $m=0,\\pm1$ angular momentum\nstate space, our simulations show that conical intersection crossings are\nclearly evident, both in atomic position information and excited state spectra\nof the Rydberg system. Hence, flexible Rydberg aggregates suggest themselves\nfor probing quantum chemical effects in experiments on length scales much\ninflated as compared to a standard molecular situation.\n", "  We develop an analytic perturbative expansion to study the propagation of\nentanglement entropy for small subsystems after a global quench, in the context\nof the AdS/CFT correspondence. Opposite to the large interval limit, in this\ncase the evolution of the system takes place at timescales that are shorter in\ncomparison to the local equilibration scale and thus, different physical\nmechanisms govern the dynamics and subsequent thermalization. In particular, we\nshow that the heuristic picture in terms of a \"entanglement tsunami\" does not\napply in this regime. We find two crucial differences. First, that the\ninstantaneous rate of growth of the entanglement is not constrained by\ncausality, but rather its time average. And second, that the approach to\nsaturation is always continuous, regardless the shape of the entangling\nsurface. Our analytic expansion also enables us to verify some previous\nnumerical results, namely, that the saturation time is non-monotonic with\nrespect to the chemical potential. All of our results are pertinent to CFTs\nwith a classical gravity dual formulation.\n", "  We show that universality near a critical end point implies a characteristic\nrelation between third- and fourth-order baryon susceptibilities $\\chi_3$ and\n$\\chi_4$, resulting in a banana-shaped loop when $\\chi_4$ is plotted as a\nfunction of $\\chi_3$ along a freeze-out line. Including the individual\nenhancements of $\\chi_3$ and $\\chi_4$ near a critical point, these features may\nbe a consistent set of observations supporting the interpretation of baryon\nfluctuations data as arising from criticality.\n", "  Atomically thin two-dimensional materials such as graphene and hexagonal\nboron nitride have recently been found to exhibit appreciable permeability to\nthermal protons, making these materials emerging candidates for separation\ntechnologies [S. Hu et al., Nature 516, 227 (2014); M. Lozada-Hidalgo et al.,\nScience 351, 68 (2016).]. These remarkable findings remain unexplained by\ndensity-functional electronic structure calculations, which instead yield\nbarriers that exceed by 1.0 eV those found in experiments. Here we resolve this\npuzzle by demonstrating that the proton transfer through pristine graphene is\ndriven by quantum nuclear effects, which substantially reduce the transport\nbarrier by up to 1.4 eV compared to the results of classical molecular dynamics\n(MD). Our Feynman-Kac path-integral MD simulations unambiguously reveal the\nquantum tunneling mechanism of strongly interacting hydrogen ions through\ntwo-dimensional materials. In addition, we predict a strong isotope effect of 1\neV on the transport barrier for graphene in vacuum and at room temperature.\nThese findings not only shed light on the graphene permeability to protons and\ndeuterons, but also offer new insights for controlling the underlying quantum\nion transport mechanisms in nanostructured separation membranes.\n", "  We study robust $H_\\infty$ coherent-classical estimation for a class of\nphysically realizable linear quantum systems with parameter uncertainties. Such\na robust coherent-classical estimator, with or without coherent feedback, can\nyield better disturbance-to-error performance than the corresponding robust\npurely-classical estimator for an uncertain plant. Moreover, coherent feedback\nallows for such a robust coherent-classical estimator to be more robust to\nuncertainty in comparison to the robust classical-only estimator.\n", "  Theoretically it has been known that breaking spin-degeneracy and effectively\nrealizing 'spinless fermions' is a promising path to topological\nsuperconductors. Yet, topological superconductors are rare to date. Here, we\npropose to realize spinless fermions by splitting the spin-degeneracy in\nmomentum space. Specifically, we identify monolayer hole-doped transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD)s as candidates for topological superconductors out of such\nmomentum-space-split spinless fermions. Although electron-doped TMDs have\nrecently been found superconducting, the observed superconductivity is unlikely\ntopological due to the near spin-degeneracy. Meanwhile, hole-doped TMDs with\nmomentum-space-split spinless fermions remain unexplored. Employing a\nrenormalization group analysis, we propose that the unusual spin-valley locking\nin hole-doped TMDs together with repulsive interactions selectively favors two\ntopological superconducting states: inter-pocket paired state with Chern number\n2 and intra-pocket paired state with finite pair-momentum. A confirmation of\nour predictions will open up possibilities for manipulating topological\nsuperconductors on the device friendly platform of monolayer TMDs.\n", "  We study spatially indirect excitons of GaAs quantum wells, confined in a 10\nmicrons electrostatic trap. Below a critical temperature of about 1 Kelvin, we\ndetect macroscopic spatial coherence and quantised vortices in the weak\nphotoluminescence emitted from the trap. These quantum signatures are\nrestricted to a narrow range of density, in a dilute regime. They manifest the\nformation of a four-component superfluid, made by a low population of optically\nbright excitons coherently coupled to a dominant fraction of optically dark\nexcitons.\n", "  In the present paper, using the first-order approximation of the $n$-body\nLagrangian (derived on the basis of the post-Newtonian gravitational theory of\nEinstein, Infeld, and Hoffman), we explicitly write down the equations of\nmotion for the planar circular restricted three-body problem. Additionally,\nwith some simplified assumptions, we obtain two formulas for estimating the\nvalues of the mass/distance and velocity/speed of light ratios appropriate for\na given post-Newtonian approximation. We show that the formulas derived in the\npresent study, lead to a good numerical conservation of the Jacobi constant and\nallow for an approximate equivalence between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian\napproaches at the same post-Newtonian order. Accordingly, the dynamics of the\nsystem is analyzed in terms of the Poincar\\'e sections method and Lyapunov\nexponents, finding that for specific values of the Jacobi constant the dynamics\ncan be either chaotic or regular. Our results suggest that the chaoticity of\nthe post-Newtonian system is slightly in- creased in comparison with its\nNewtonian counterpart.\n", "  We investigate real-space localization in the few-particle regime of the XXZ\nspin-$1/2$ chain with a random magnetic field. Our investigation focuses on the\ntime evolution of the spatial variance of non-equilibrium densities, as\nresulting for a specific class of initial states, namely, pure product states\nof densely packed particles. Varying the strength of both particle-particle\ninteractions and disorder, we numerically calculate the long-time evolution of\nthe spatial variance $\\sigma(t)$. For the two-particle case, the saturation of\nthis variance yields an increased but finite localization length, with a\nparameter scaling different to known results for bosons. We find that this\ninteraction-induced increase is the stronger the more particles are taken into\naccount in the initial condition. We further find that our non-equilibrium\ndynamics are clearly inconsistent with normal diffusion and instead point to\nsubdiffusive dynamics with $\\sigma(t) \\propto t^{1/4}$.\n", "  Adiabatic evolutions find widespread utility in applications to quantum state\nengineering, geometric quantum computation, and quantum simulation. Although\noffering robustness to experimental imperfections, adiabatic processes are\nsusceptible to decoherence due to their long evolution time. A general strategy\ntermed \"shortcuts to adiabaticity\" (STA) aims to remedy this vulnerability by\ndesigning fast dynamics to reproduce the results of slow, adiabatic evolutions.\nHere, we implement a novel STA technique known as \"superadiabatic\ntransitionless driving\" (SATD) to speed up stimulated Raman adiabatic passage\n(STIRAP) in a solid-state lambda ({\\Lambda}) system. Utilizing optical\ntransitions to a dissipative excited state in the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center\nin diamond, we demonstrate the accelerated performance of different shortcut\ntrajectories for population transfer and for the initialization and transfer of\ncoherent superpositions. We reveal that SATD protocols exhibit robustness to\ndissipation and experimental uncertainty, and can be optimized when these\neffects are present. These results motivate STA as a promising tool for\ncontrolling open quantum systems comprising individual or hybrid\nnanomechanical, superconducting, and photonic elements in the solid state.\n", "  We explore the possibility that fermionic dark matter undergoes a BCS\ntransition to form a superfluid. This requires an attractive interaction\nbetween fermions and we describe a possible source of this interaction induced\nby torsion. We describe the gravitating fermion system with the Bogoliubov-de\nGennes formalism in the local density approximation. We solve the Poisson\nequation along with the equations for the density and gap energy of the\nfermions to find a self-gravitating, superfluid solution for dark matter halos.\nIn order to produce halos the size of dwarf galaxies, we require a particle\nmass of $\\sim 200\\mathrm{eV}$. We find a maximum attractive coupling strength\nbefore the halo becomes unstable. If dark matter halos do have a superfluid\ncomponent, this raises the possibility that they contain vortex lines.\n", "  We report the discovery of two new candidate stellar systems in the\nconstellation of Cetus using the data from the first two years of the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES). The objects, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+0304, are\nlocated at a heliocentric distance of ~ 25 kpc and appear to have old and\nmetal-poor populations. Their distances to the Sagittarius orbital plane, ~\n1.73 kpc (DES J0111-1341) and ~ 0.50 kpc (DES J0225+0304), indicate that they\nare possibly associated with the Sagittarius dwarf stream. The half-light\nradius (r_h ~ 4.55 pc) and luminosity (M_V ~ +0.3) of DES J0111-1341 are\nconsistent with it being an ultrafaint stellar cluster, while the half-light\nradius (r_h ~ 18.55 pc) and luminosity (M_V ~ -1.1) of DES J0225+0304 place it\nin an ambiguous region of size-luminosity space between stellar clusters and\ndwarf galaxies. Determinations of the characteristic parameters of the\nSagittarius stream, metallicity spread (-2.18 < [Fe/H] < -0.95) and distance\ngradient (23 kpc < D_sun < 29 kpc), within the DES footprint in the Southern\nhemisphere, using the same DES data, also indicate a possible association\nbetween these systems. If these objects are confirmed through spectroscopic\nfollow-up to be gravitationally bound systems and to share a Galactic\ntrajectory with the Sagittarius stream, DES J0111-1341 and DES J0225+0304 would\nbe the first ultrafaint stellar systems associated with the Sagittarius stream.\nFurthermore, DES J0225+0304 would also be the first confirmed case of an\nultrafaint satellite of a satellite.\n", "  We consider a semi-infinite one-dimensional phase-change material with two\nunknown constant thermal coefficients among the latent heat per unit mass, the\nspecific heat, the mass density and the thermal conductivity. Aiming at the\ndetermination of them, we consider an inverse one-phase Stefan problem with an\nover-specified condition at the fixed boundary and a known evolution for the\nmoving boundary. We assume that the phase-change process presents latent-heat\nmemory effects by considering a fractional time derivative of order $\\alpha$\n($0<\\alpha<1$) in the Caputo sense and a sharp front model for the interface.\nAccording to the choice of the unknown thermal coefficients, six inverse\nfractional Stefan problems arise. For each of them, we determine necessary and\nsufficient conditions on data to obtain the existence and uniqueness of a\nsolution of similarity type. Moreover, we present explicit expressions for the\ntemperature and the unknown thermal coefficients. Finally, we show that the\nresults for the classical statement of this problem, associated with\n$\\alpha=1$, are obtained through the fractional model when $\\alpha\\to 1^-$.\n", "  A distinct thermal Hall signal is observed in a quantum spin liquid candidate\nBa$_3$CuSb$_2$O$_9$. The transverse thermal conduction shows a power-law\ntemperature dependence below 40 K where a spin gap opens. We suggest that,\nthrough the very low longitudinal thermal conductivity and the thermal Hall\nsignals, a phonon Hall effect is induced by strong phonon scatterings by orphan\nCu$^{2+}$ spins formed in random domains of Cu$^{2+}$-Sb$^{5+}$ dumbbells.\n", "  Recently [Cavalcanti \\textit{et al.} Nat Commun \\textbf{6}, 7941 (2015)]\nproposed a method to certify the presence of entanglement in asymmetric\nnetworks, where some users do not have control over the measurements they are\nperforming. Such asymmetry naturally emerges in realistic situtations, such as\nin cryptographic protocols over quantum networks. Here we implement such\n\"semi-device independent\" techniques to experimentally witness all types of\nentanglement on a three-qubit photonic W state. Furthermore we analise the\namount of genuine randomness that can be certified in this scenario from any\nbipartition of the three-qubit W state.\n", "  We have formulated the scattering theory on Majorana fermions emerging in the\nsurface bound state of the superfluid $^3$He B-phase ($^3$He-B) by an impurity.\nBy applying the theory to the electron bubble, which is regarded as the\nimpurity, trapped below a free surface of $^3$He-B, the observed mobility of\nthe electron bubble [Ikegami et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 82, 124607 (2013)] is\nquantitatively reproduced. The mobility is suppressed in low temperatures from\nthe expected value in the bulk $^3$He-B by the contribution from the surface\nMajorana fermions. By contrast, the mobility does not depend on trapped depth\nof the electron bubble in spite of the spatial variation of the wave function\nof the surface Majorana fermions. Our formulated theory demonstrates the depth\nindependent mobility by considering intermediate states in the scattering\nprocess. Therefore, we conclude that the experiment has succeeded in observing\nMajorana fermions in the surface bound state.\n", "  We study a topological phase transition between a normal insulator and a\nquantum spin Hall insulator in two-dimensional (2D) systems with time-reversal\nand two-fold rotation symmetries. Contrary to the case of ordinary\ntime-reversal invariant systems where a direct transition between two\ninsulators is generally predicted, we find that the topological phase\ntransition in systems with an additional two-fold rotation symmetry is mediated\nby an emergent stable two-dimensional Weyl semimetal phase between two\ninsulators. Here the central role is played by the so-called space-time\ninversion symmetry, the combination of time-reversal and two-fold rotation\nsymmetries, which guarantees the quantization of the Berry phase around a 2D\nWeyl point even in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.\nPair-creation/pair-annihilation of Weyl points accompanying partner exchange\nbetween different pairs induces a jump of a 2D $Z_{2}$ topological invariant\nleading to a topological phase transition. According to our theory, the\ntopological phase transition in HgTe/CdTe quantum well structure is mediated by\na stable 2D Weyl semimetal phase since the quantum well, lacking inversion\nsymmetry intrinsically, has two-fold rotation about the growth direction.\nNamely, the HgTe/CdTe quantum well can show 2D Weyl semimetallic behavior\nwithin a small but finite interval in the thickness of HgTe layers between a\nnormal insulator and a quantum spin Hall insulator. We also propose that\nfew-layer black phosphorus under perpendicular electric field is another\ncandidate system to observe the unconventional topological phase transition\nmechanism accompanied by emerging 2D Weyl semimetal phase protected by\nspace-time inversion symmetry.\n", "  Every evolution of a fluid is uniquely described by an energy tensor. But the\nconverse is not true: an energy tensor may describe the evolution of different\nfluids. The problem of determining them is called here the {\\em inverse\nproblem}. This problem may admit unphysical or non-deterministic solutions.\nThis paper is devoted to solve the inverse problem for perfect energy tensors\nin the class of perfect fluids evolving in local thermal equilibrium (l.t.e.).\nThe starting point is a previous result (Coll and Ferrando in J Math Phys 30:\n2918-2922, 1989) showing that thermodynamic fluids evolving in l.t.e. admit a\npurely hydrodynamic characterization. This characterization allows solving this\ninverse problem in a very compact form. The paradigmatic case of perfect energy\ntensors representing the evolution of ideal gases is studied in detail and some\napplications and examples are outlined.\n", "  We investigate the prompt emission of few intermediate-mass fragments in\nspallation reactions induced by protons and deuterons in the 1 GeV range. Such\nemission has a minor contribution to the total reaction cross section, but it\nmay overcome evaporation and fission channels in the formation of light\nnuclides. The role of mean-field dynamics and phase-space fluctuations in these\nreactions is investigated through the Boltzmann-Langevin transport equation. We\nfound that a process of frustrated fragmentation and re-aggregation is a\nprominent mechanism of production of IMFs which can not be assimilated to the\nstatistical decay of a compound nucleus. Very interestingly, this process may\nyield a small number of IMF in the exit channel, which may even reduce to two,\nand be wrongly confused with ordinary asymmetric fission. This interpretation,\ninspired by nuclear-spallation experiments, can be generalised to heavy-ion\ncollisions approaching the fragmentation threshold.\n", "  Various theories, such as MOND, MOG, Emergent Gravity and $f(R)$ theories\navoid dark matter by assuming a change in General Relativity and/or in Newton's\nlaw. Galactic rotation curves are typically described well. Here the\napplication to galaxy clusters is considered, focussed on the good lensing and\nX-ray data for A1689. As a start, the no-dark-matter case is confirmed to work\nbadly: the need for dark matter starts near the cluster centre, where Newton's\nlaw is still supposed to be valid. This leads to the conundrum discovered by\nZwicky, which is likely only solvable in his way, namely by assuming additional\n(dark) matter. Neutrinos with eV masses serve well without altering the\nsuccesses in (dwarf) galaxies.\n", "  In this paper, we study the physical significance of the thermodynamic\nvolumes of AdS black holes using the Noether charge formalism of Iyer and Wald.\nAfter applying this formalism to study the extended thermodynamics of a few\nexamples, we discuss how the extended thermodynamics interacts with the recent\ncomplexity = action proposal of Brown et al. (CA-duality). We, in particular,\ndiscover that their proposal for the late time rate of change of complexity has\na nice decomposition in terms of thermodynamic quantities reminiscent of the\nSmarr relation. This decomposition strongly suggests a geometric, and via\nCA-duality holographic, interpretation for the thermodynamic volume of an AdS\nblack hole. We go on to discuss the role of thermodynamics in complexity =\naction for a number of black hole solutions, and then point out the possibility\nof an alternate proposal, which we dub \"complexity = volume 2.0\". In this\nalternate proposal, the complexity would be thought of as the spacetime volume\nof the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. Finally, we provide evidence that, in certain\ncases, our proposal for complexity is consistent with the Lloyd bound whereas\nCA-duality is not.\n", "  Although SU(1,1) interferometry achieves Heisenberg-limited sensitivities, it\nsuffers from one major drawback: only those particles outcoupled from the pump\nmode contribute to the phase measurement. Since the number of particles\noutcoupled to these `side modes' is typically small, this limits the\ninterferometer's absolute sensitivity. We propose an alternative `pumped-up'\napproach where all the input particles participate in the phase measurement,\nand show how this can be implemented in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates and\nhybrid atom-light systems - both of which have experimentally realized SU(1,1)\ninterferometry. We demonstrate that pumped-up schemes are capable of surpassing\nthe shot-noise limit with respect to the total number of input particles and\nare never worse than conventional SU(1,1) interferometry. Finally, we show that\npumped-up schemes continue to excel - both absolutely and in comparison to\nconventional SU(1,1) interferometry - in the presence of particle losses, poor\nparticle-resolution detection, and noise on the relative phase difference\nbetween the two side modes. Pumped-up SU(1,1) interferometry therefore pushes\nthe advantages of conventional SU(1,1) interferometry into the regime of high\nabsolute sensitivity, which is a necessary condition for useful\nquantum-enhanced devices.\n", "  Plasmonic nanoantennas have been recently proposed to boost nonlinear optical\nprocesses. In a metal dipole nanoantenna with a dielectric nanoparticle placed\nin the gap, the linear field enhancement can be exploited to enhance third\nharmonic emission. Since both metals and dielectrics exhibit nonlinearity, the\nnonlinear far-field contains contributions from each, and the impossibility of\nmeasuring these contributions separately has led to seemingly contradictory\ninterpretations about the origin of the nonlinear emission. We determine that\nthe origin of the third harmonic from metal-dielectric dipole nanoantennas\ndepends on nanoantenna design, and in particular, the width. We find that the\nemission from gold dominates in thin threadlike nanoantennas, whereas the\nemission from the gap material dominates in wider nanoantennas. We also find\nthat monopole nanoantennas perform better than dipoles having the same width,\nand due to their simplicity should be preferred in many applications.\n", "  We study the geometry of 4d N=1 SCFT's arising from compactification of 6d\n(1,0) SCFT's on a Riemann surface. We show that the conformal manifold of the\nresulting theory is characterized, in addition to moduli of complex structure\nof the Riemann surface, by the choice of a connection for a vector bundle on\nthe surface arising from flavor symmetries in 6d. We exemplify this by\nconsidering the case of 4d N=1 SCFT's arising from M5 branes probing Z_k\nsingularity compactified on a Riemann surface. In particular, we study in\ndetail the four dimensional theories arising in the case of two M5 branes on\nZ_2 singularity. We compute the conformal anomalies and indices of such\ntheories in 4d and find that they are consistent with expectations based on\nanomaly and the moduli structure derived from the 6 dimensional perspective.\n", "  We report on the realization of an ultracold (<25~muK) mixture of rubidium\n({87}Rb) and metastable triplet helium ({4}He) in an optical dipole trap. Our\nscheme involves laser cooling in a dual-species magneto-optical trap,\nsimultaneous MW- and RF-induced forced evaporative cooling in a quadrupole\nmagnetic trap, and transfer to a single-beam optical dipole trap. We observe\nlong trapping lifetimes for the doubly spin-stretched spin-state mixture and\nmeasure much shorter lifetimes for other spin-state combinations. We discuss\nprospects for realizing quantum degenerate mixtures of alkali-metal and\nmetastable helium atoms.\n", "  The spectra of charged particles produced within the pseudorapidity window\nabs(eta) < 1 at sqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV are measured using 404 inverse\nmicrobarns of PbPb and 27.4 inverse picobarns of pp data collected by the CMS\ndetector at the LHC in 2015. The spectra are presented over the transverse\nmomentum ranges spanning 0.5 < pt < 400 GeV in pp and 0.7 < pt < 400 GeV in\nPbPb collisions. The corresponding nuclear modification factor, R[AA], is\nmeasured in bins of collision centrality. The R[AA] in the 5% most central\ncollisions shows a maximal suppression by a factor of 7-8 in the pt region of\n6-9 GeV. This dip is followed by an increase, which continues up to the highest\npt measured, and approaches unity in the vicinity of pt = 200 GeV. The R[AA] is\ncompared to theoretical predictions and earlier experimental results at lower\ncollision energies. The newly measured pp spectrum is combined with the pPb\nspectrum previously published by the CMS Collaboration to construct the pPb\nnuclear modification factor, R[pA], up to 120 GeV. For pt > 20 GeV, R[pA]\nexhibits weak momentum dependence and shows a moderate enhancement above unity.\n", "  We present a review of recent theoretical results concerning the many-body\nlocalization (MBL) phenomenon, with the emphasis on dynamical density\ncorrelations and transport quantities. They are shown to be closely related,\nproviding a comprehensive description of the ergodic-to-nonergodic transition,\nconsistent with experimental findings. While the focus is set mostly on the\none-dimensional model of interacting spinless fermions, we also present\nevidence for the absence of full MBL in the one-dimensional Hubbard model and\nfor the density-wave decay induced by the inter-chain coupling.\n", "  We present a simple and versatile method for deriving (an)isotropic local\nlaws for general random matrices constructed from independent random variables.\nOur method is applicable to mean-field random matrices, where all independent\nvariables have comparable variances. It is entirely insensitive to the\nexpectation of the matrix. In this paper we focus on the probabilistic part of\nthe proof -- the derivation of the self-consistent equations. As a concrete\napplication, we settle in complete generality the local law for Wigner matrices\nwith arbitrary expectation.\n", "  It has recently been shown that a suitably interconnected network of tunable\ntelegraphic noise generators or \"p-bits\" can be used to perform even precise\narithmetic functions like a 32-bit adder. In this paper we use simulations\nbased on the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (sLLG) equation to demonstrate\nthat similar impressive functions can be performed using unstable nanomagnets\nwith energy barriers as low as a fraction of a kT. This is surprising since the\nmagnetization of low barrier nanomagnets is not telegraphic with discrete\nvalues of +1 and -1. Rather it fluctuates randomly among all values between -1\nand +1, and the output magnets are read with a thresholding device that\ntranslates all positive values to 1 and all negative values to zero. We present\nsLLG-based simulations demonstrating the operation of a 32-bit adder with a\nnetwork of several hundred nanomagnets, exhibiting a remarkably precise\ncorrelation: The input magnets {A} and {B} as well as the output magnets {S}\nall fluctuate randomly and yet the quantity A+B-S is sharply peaked around\nzero! If we fix {A} and {B}, the sum magnets {S} rapidly converge to a unique\nstate with S=A+B so that the system acts as an adder. But unlike standard\nadders, the operation is invertible. If we fix {S} and {B}, the remaining\nmagnets {A} converge to the difference A=S-B. These examples suggest a new\ndirection for the field of nanomagnetics away from stable high barrier magnets\ntowards stochastic low barrier magnets which not only operate with lower\ncurrents, but are also more promising for continued downscaling.\n", "  Graph states are quantum states that can be described by a stabilizer\nformalism and play an important role in quantum information processing. We\nconsider the action of local unitary operations on graph states and hypergraph\nstates. We focus on non-Clifford operations and find for certain\ntransformations a graphical description in terms of weighted hypergraphs. This\nleads to the indentification of hypergraph states that are locally equivalent\nto graph states. Moreover, we present a systematic way to construct pairs of\ngraph states which are equivalent under local unitary operations, but not\nequivalent under local Clifford operations. This generates counterexamples to a\nconjecture known as LU-LC conjecture. So far, the only counterexamples to this\nconjecture were found by random search. Our method reproduces the smallest\nknown counterexample as a special case and provides a physical interpretation.\n", "  A model with $L_{\\mu} -L_{\\tau}$ gauge symmetry is the least constrained\nmodel as a resolution to the disagreement of the muon anomalous magnetic moment\nbetween the theoretical predictions and the experimental results. In this\npaper, we discuss how well the $L_{\\mu} - L_{\\tau}$ model can be constrained by\nlooking for decays of the charged kaon associated with a $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$\ngauge boson. More concretely, we consider searches for single muon tracks from\nthe decays of stopped charged kaon as in the E949 experiment. In our\nconservative estimation, we find that the favored parameter region for the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment can be tested by using a $10$ times larger number of\nthe stopped charged kaons and about a $100$ times better photon rejection rate\nthan the E949 experiment.\n", "  We built a 1-watt cw singly resonant optical parametric oscillator operating\nat an idler wavelength of 1.65~$\\mu$m for application to quantum interfaces.\nThe non resonant idler is frequency stabilized by side-fringe locking on a\nrelatively high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity, and the influence of intensity\nnoise is carefully analyzed. A relative linewidth down to the sub-kHz level\n(about 30 Hz over 2 s) is achieved. A very good long term stability is obtained\nfor both frequency and intensity.\n", "  The dark matter (DM) blind spots in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) refer to the parameter regions where the couplings of the DM particles\nto the $Z$-boson or the Higgs boson are almost zero, leading to vanishingly\nsmall signals for the DM direct detections. In this paper, we carry out\ncomprehensive analyses for the DM searches under the blind-spot scenarios in\nMSSM. Guided by the requirement of acceptable DM relic abundance, we explore\nthe complementary coverage for the theory parameters at the LHC, the projection\nfor the future underground DM direct searches, and the indirect searches from\nthe relic DM annihilation into photons and neutrinos. We find that (i) the\nspin-independent (SI) blind spots may be rescued by the spin-dependent (SD)\ndirect detection in the future underground experiments, and possibly by the\nindirect DM detections from IceCube and SuperK neutrino experiments; (ii) the\ndetection of gamma rays from Fermi-LAT may not reach the desirable sensitivity\nfor searching for the DM blind-spot regions; (iii) the SUSY searches at the LHC\nwill substantially extend the discovery region for the blind-spot parameters.\nThe dark matter blind spots thus may be unblinded with the collective efforts\nin future DM searches.\n", "  Nowadays, the magnetic and radiation fields are very important to understand\nthe matter accretion into compact objects, the dynamics of binary systems, the\nequilibrium configurations of neutron stars, the photon diffusion, etc. The\nenergy and the momentum associated to these fields, along with the matter one,\nneed to satisfy some conditions that guarantee an appropriate physical behavior\nof the source and its gravitational field. Based on this fact, we present the\nenergy conditions for a perfect fluid with magnetic and radiation field, in\nwhich the radiation part of the energy-momentum tensor is assumed to be\napproximately isotropic, in accordance with the optically thick regime. In\norder to find these conditions, the stress tensor of the system is written in\nan orthonormal basis in which it becomes diagonal, and the energy conditions\nare computed through contractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the four\nvelocity vector of an arbitrary observer. Finally, the conditions for a\nmagnetized fluid are presented as a particular case in which the radiation\ncontribution is zero.\n", "  We continue to investigate the dynamics of collisionless systems of particles\ninteracting via additive $r^{-\\alpha}$ interparticle forces. Here we focus on\nthe dependence of the radial-orbit instability on the force exponent $\\alpha$.\nBy means of direct $N$-body simulations we study the stability of equilibrium\nradially anisotropic Osipkov-Merritt spherical models with Hernquist density\nprofile and with $1\\leq\\alpha<3$. We determine, as a function of $\\alpha$, the\nminimum value for stability of the anisotropy radius $r_{as}$ and of the\nmaximum value of the associated stability indicator $\\xi_s$. We find that, for\ndecreasing $\\alpha$, $r_{as}$ decreases and $\\xi_s$ increases, i.e.\nlonger-range forces are more robust against radial-orbit instability. The\nisotropic systems are found to be stable for all the explored values of\n$\\alpha$. The end products of unstable systems are all markedly triaxial with\nminor-to-major axial ratio $>0.3$, so they are never flatter than an E7 system.\n", "  Gray molasses is a powerful tool for sub-Doppler laser cooling of atoms to\nlow temperatures. For alkaline atoms, this technique is commonly implemented\nwith cooling lasers which are blue-detuned from either the D1 or D2 line. Here\nwe show that efficient gray molasses can be implemented on the D2 line of 40K\nwith red-detuned lasers. We obtained temperatures of 48(2) microKelvin, which\nenables direct loading of 9.2(3)*10^6 atoms from a magneto-optical trap into an\noptical dipole trap. We support our findings by a one-dimensional model and\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations of the optical Bloch equations which\nqualitatively reproduce the experimentally observed cooling effects.\n", "  Recently the CERN ALICE experiment, in its dedicated cosmic ray run, observed\nmuon bundles of very high multiplicities, thereby confirming similar findings\nfrom the LEP era at CERN (in the CosmoLEP project). Originally it was argued\nthat they apparently stem from the primary cosmic rays with a heavy masses. We\npropose an alternative possibility arguing that muonic bundles of highest\nmultiplicity are produced by strangelets, hypothetical stable lumps of strange\nquark matter infiltrating our Universe. We also address the possibility of\nadditionally deducing their directionality which could be of astrophysical\ninterest. Significant evidence for anisotropy of arrival directions of the\nobserved high multiplicity muonic bundles is found. Estimated directionality\nsuggests their possible extragalactic provenance.\n", "  Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the participation\n(Shannon-R\\'enyi) entropies for groundstate wave functions of Heisenberg\nantiferromagnets for one-dimensional (line) subsystems of length $L$ embedded\nin two-dimensional ($L\\times L$) square lattices. We also study the line\nentropy at finite temperature, i.e. of the diagonal elements of the density\nmatrix, for three-dimensional ($L\\times L\\times L$) cubic lattices. The\nbreaking of SU(2) symmetry is clearly captured by a universal logarithmic\nscaling term $l_q\\ln L$ in the R\\'enyi entropies, in good agreement with the\nrecent field-theory results of Misguish, Pasquier and Oshikawa\n[arXiv:1607.02465]. We also study the dependence of the log prefactor $l_q$ on\nthe R\\'enyi index $q$ for which a transition is detected at $q_c\\simeq 1$.\n", "  We report the first empirical demonstration that resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering (RIXS) is sensitive to \\emph{collective} magnetic excitations in\n$S=1$ systems by probing the Ni $L_3$-edge of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$ ($x = 0,\n0.33, 0.45$). The magnetic excitation peak is asymmetric, indicating the\npresence of single and multi spin-flip excitations. As the hole doping level is\nincreased, the zone boundary magnon energy is suppressed at a much larger rate\nthan that in hole doped cuprates. Based on the analysis of the orbital and\ncharge excitations observed by RIXS, we argue that this difference is related\nto the orbital character of the doped holes in these two families. This work\nestablishes RIXS as a probe of fundamental magnetic interactions in nickelates\nopening the way towards studies of heterostructures and ultra-fast pump-probe\nexperiments.\n", "  This paper provides a systematic study of supergravity contributions relevant\nfor inflationary model building in Jordan frame supergravity. In this\nframework, canonical kinetic terms in the Jordan frame result in the separation\nof the Jordan frame scalar potential into a tree-level term and a supergravity\ncontribution, which is potentially dangerous for sustaining inflation. We show\nthat if the vacuum energy necessary for driving inflation originates dominantly\nfrom the F-term of an auxiliary field (i.e. not the inflaton), the supergravity\ncorrections to the Jordan frame scalar potential are generically suppressed.\nMoreover, these supergravity contributions identically vanish if the\nsuperpotential $W$ vanishes along the inflationary trajectory. On the other\nhand, if the F-term associated with the inflaton dominates the vacuum energy,\nthe supergravity contributions are generically comparable to the globally\nsupersymmetric contributions. In addition, the non-minimal coupling to gravity\ninherent to Jordan frame supergravity significantly impacts the inflationary\nmodel depending on the size and sign of this coupling. We discuss the\nphenomenology of some representative inflationary models, and point out the\nrelation to the recently much discussed cosmological `attractor' models.\n", "  A search is presented for new massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ or ZZ\nbosons in l nu quark anti-quark and quark anti-quark quark anti-quark final\nstates. Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n2.3-2.7 inverse femtobarns recorded in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13\nTeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Decays of spin-1 and spin-2 resonances\ninto two vector bosons are sought in the mass range 0.6-4.0 TeV. No significant\nexcess over the standard model background is observed. Combining the results of\nthe l nu quark anti-quark and quark anti-quark quark anti-quark final states,\ncross section and mass exclusion limits are set for models that predict heavy\nspin-1 and spin-2 resonances. This is the first search for a narrow-width\nspin-2 resonance at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV.\n", "  The existence and ballooning-stability of low aspect ratio stellarator\nequilibria is predicted for CNT with the aid of 3D numerical tools. In addition\nto having a low aspect ratio, CNT is characterized by a low magnetic field and\nsmall plasma volume. Also, highly overdense plasmas were recently heated in CNT\nby means of microwaves. These characteristics suggest that CNT might attain\nrelatively high values of plasma $\\beta$ and thus be of use in the experimental\nstudy of stellarator stability to high-$\\beta$ instabilities such as ballooning\nmodes. As a first step in that direction, here the ballooning stability limit\nis found numerically. Depending on the particular magnetic configuration we\nexpect volume-averaged $\\beta$ limits in the range 0.9-3.0%, and possibly\nhigher, and observe indications of a second region of ballooning stability. As\nthe aspect ratio is reduced, stability is found to increase in some\nconfigurations and decrease in others. Energy-balance estimates using\nstellarator scaling laws indicate that the lower $\\beta$ limit may be\nattainable with overdense heating at powers of of 40 to 100 kW. The present\nstudy serves the additional purpose of testing VMEC and other stellarator codes\nat high values of $\\beta$ and at low aspect ratios. For this reason, the study\nwas carried out both for free boundary, for maximum fidelity to experiment, as\nwell as with a fixed boundary, as a numerical test.\n", "  We obtain analytical expressions, both in terms of parametric integrals and\nPassarino-Veltman scalar functions, for the one-loop contributions to the\nanomalous weak magnetic dipole moment (AWMDM) of a charged lepton in the\nframework of the simplest little Higgs model (SLHM). Our results are general\nand can be useful to compute the weak properties of a charged lepton in other\nextensions of the standard model (SM). As a by-product we obtain generic\ncontributions to the anomalous magnetic dipole moment (AMDM), which agree with\nprevious results. We then study numerically the potential contributions from\nthis model to the $\\tau$ lepton AMDM and AWMDM for values of the parameter\nspace consistent with current experimental data. It is found that they depend\nmainly on the energy scale $f$ at which the global symmetry is broken and the\n$t_\\beta$ parameter, whereas there is little sensitivity to a mild change in\nthe values of other parameters of the model. While the $\\tau$ AMDM is of the\norder of $10^{-9}$, the real (imaginary) part of its AWMDM is of the order of\n$10^{-9}$ ($10^{-10}$). These values seem to be out of the reach of the\nexpected experimental sensitivity of future experiments.\n", "  The tidal Love numbers (TLNs) encode the deformability of a self-gravitating\nobject immersed in a tidal environment and depend significantly both on the\nobject's internal structure and on the dynamics of the gravitational field. An\nintriguing result in classical general relativity is the vanishing of the TLNs\nof black holes. We extend this result in three ways, aiming at testing the\nnature of compact objects: (i) we compute the TLNs of exotic compact objects,\nincluding different families of boson stars, gravastars, wormholes, and other\ntoy models for quantum corrections at the horizon scale. In the black-hole\nlimit, we find a universal logarithmic dependence of the TLNs on the location\nof the surface; (ii) we compute the TLNs of black holes beyond vacuum general\nrelativity, including Einstein-Maxwell, Brans-Dicke and Chern-Simons gravity;\n(iii) We assess the ability of present and future gravitational-wave detectors\nto measure the TLNs of these objects, including the first analysis of TLNs with\nLISA. Both LIGO, ET and LISA can impose interesting constraints on boson stars,\nwhile LISA is able to probe even extremely compact objects. We argue that the\nTLNs provide a smoking gun of new physics at the horizon scale, and that future\ngravitational-wave measurements of the TLNs in a binary inspiral provide a\nnovel way to test black holes and general relativity in the strong-field\nregime.\n", "  Electromagnetic fields which solve the vacuum Maxwell equations in one\nspacetime are well-known to also be solutions in all spacetimes with\nconformally-related metrics. This provides a sense in which electromagnetism\nalone cannot be used to measure certain aspects of geometry. We show that there\nis actually much more which cannot be so measured; relatively little of a\nspacetime's geometry is in fact imprinted in any particular electromagnetic\nfield. This is demonstrated by finding a much larger class of metric\ntransformations---involving five free functions---which preserve Maxwell\nsolutions both in vacuum, without local currents, and also for the force-free\nelectrodynamics associated with a tenuous plasma. One consequence of this is\nthat many of the exact force-free fields which have previously been found\naround Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes are also solutions in\nappropriately-identified flat backgrounds. As a more direct application, we use\nour metric transformations to write down a large class of electromagnetic waves\nwhich remain unchanged by a large class of gravitational waves propagating \"in\nthe same direction.\"\n", "  The Green function plays an essential role in the Kohn-Korringa-Rostocker\n(KKR) multiple scattering method. In practice, it is constructed from the\nregular and irregular solutions of the local Kohn-Sham equation and robust\nmethods exist for spherical potentials. However, when applied to a\nnon-spherical potential, numerical errors from the irregular solutions give\nrise to pathological behaviors of the charge density at small radius. Here we\npresent a full-potential implementation of the relativistic KKR method to\nperform \\textit{ab initio} self-consistent calculation by directly solving the\nDirac differential equations. The pathology around the origin is completely\neliminated with the help of an efficient pole-searching technique. This method\nis utilized to investigate the crystal structures of polonium and their bulk\nproperties. The noble metals are also calculated, both as a test of our method\nand to study the relativistic effects.\n", "  In this article, we study the plasmonic resonance of infinite photonic\ncrystal mounted by the double negative nanoparticles in two dimensions. The\ncorresponding physical model is described by the Helmholz equation with so\ncalled Bloch wave condition in a periodic domain. By using the quasi-periodic\nlayer potential techniques and the spectral theorem of quasi-periodic\nNeumann-Poincar{\\'e} operator, the quasi-static expansion of the near field in\nthe presence of nanoparticles is derived. Furthermore, when the magnetic\npermeability of nanoparticles satisfies the Drude model, we give the conditions\nunder which the plasmonic resonance occurs, and the rate of blow up of near\nfield energy with respect to nanoparticle's bulk electron relaxation rate and\nfilling factor are also obtained. It indicates that one can appropriately\ncontrol the bulk electron relaxation rate or filling factor of nanoparticle in\nphotonic crystal structure such that the near field energy attains its maximum,\nand enhancing the efficiency of energy utilization.\n", "  We experimentally study the magnon-photon coupling in a system consitsing of\nthe compensating ferrimagnet gadolinium iron garnet (GdIG) and a\nthree-dimensional microwave cavity. The temperature is varied in order to tune\nthe GdIG magnetization and to observe the transition from the weak coupling\nregime to the strong coupling regime. By measuring and modelling the complex\nreflection parameter of the system the effective coupling rate g eff and the\nmagnetization M eff of the sample are extracted. Comparing g eff with the\nmagnon and the cavity decay rate we conclude that the strong coupling regime is\neasily accessible using GdIG. We show that the effective coupling strength\nfollows the predicted square root dependence on the magnetization.\n", "  In this letter we establish Yangian symmetry of planar N=4 super-Yang-Mills\ntheory. We prove that the classical equations of motion of the model close onto\nthemselves under the action of Yangian generators. Moreover we propose an\noff-shell extension of our statement which is equivalent to the invariance of\nthe action and prove that it is exactly satisfied. We assert that our\nrelationship serves as a criterion for integrability in planar gauge theories\nby explicitly checking that it applies to integrable ABJM theory but not to\nnon-integrable N=1 super-Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  The differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol\nwas proposed aiming at simple implementation, but it can tolerate only a small\ndisturbance in a quantum channel. The round-robin DPS (RRDPS) protocol could be\na good solution for this problem, which in fact can tolerate even up to $50\\%$\nof a bit error rate. Unfortunately, however, such a high tolerance can be\nachieved only when we compromise the simplicity, i.e., Bob's measurement must\ninvolve a large number of random delays ($|\\mathcal{R}|$ denotes its number),\nand in a practical regime of $|\\mathcal{R}|$ being small, the tolerance is low.\nIn this paper, we propose a new DPS protocol to achieve a higher tolerance than\nthe one in the original DPS protocol, in which the measurement setup is less\ndemanding than the one of the RRDPS protocol for the high tolerance regime. We\ncall the new protocol the small-number-random DPS (SNRDPS) protocol, and in\nthis protocol, we add only a small amount of randomness to the original DPS\nprotocol, i.e., $2\\leq|\\mathcal{R}|\\leq10$. In fact, we found that the\nperformance of the SNRDPS protocol is significantly enhanced over the original\nDPS protocol only by employing a few additional delays such as\n$|\\mathcal{R}|=2$. Also, we found that the key generation rate of the SNRDPS\nprotocol outperforms the RRDPS protocol without monitoring the bit error rate\nwhen it is less than $5\\%$ and $|\\mathcal{R}|\\leq10$. Our protocol is an\nintermediate protocol between the original DPS protocol and the RRDPS protocol,\nand it increases the variety of the DPS-type protocols with quantified\nsecurity.\n", "  Information on the existence and properties of diffuse interstellar bands\n(DIBs) outside the optical domain is still limited. Additional infra-red (IR)\nmeasurements and IR-optical correlative studies are needed to constrain DIB\ncarriers and locate various absorbers in 3D maps of the interstellar matter. We\nextended our study of H-band DIBs in Apache Point Observatory Galactic\nEvolution Experiment (APOGEE) Telluric Standard Star (TSS) spectra. We used the\nstrong 15273A band to select the most and least absorbed targets. We used\nindividual spectra of the former subsample to extract weaker DIBs, and we\nsearched the two stacked series for differences that could indicate additional\nbands. High-resolution NARVAL and SOPHIE optical spectra for a subsample of 55\nTSS targets were additionally recorded for NIR/optical correlative studies.\nFrom the TSS spectra we extract a catalog of measurements of the poorly studied\n15617, 15653, and 15673A DIBs in about 300 sightlines, we obtain a first\naccurate determination of their rest wavelength and constrained their intrinsic\nwidth and shape. In addition, we studied the relationship between these weak\nbands and the strong 15273A DIB. We provide a first or second confirmation of\nseveral other weak DIBs that have been proposed based on different instruments,\nand we add new constraints on their widths and locations. We finally propose\ntwo new DIB candidates. We compared the strength of the 15273A absorptions with\ntheir optical counterparts 5780, 5797, 6196, 6283, and 6614A. Using the\n5797-5780 ratio as a tracer of shielding against the radiation field, we showed\nthat the 15273A DIB carrier is significantly more abundant in unshielded\n(sigma-type) clouds, and it responds even more strongly than the 5780A band\ncarrier to the local ionizing field.\n", "  Mechanical oscillators are at the heart of many sensor applications. Recently\nseveral groups have developed oscillators that are probed optically, fabricated\nfrom high-stress silicon nitride films. They exhibit outstanding force\nsensitivities of a few aN/Hz$^{1/2}$ and can also be made highly reflective,\nfor efficient detection. The optical read-out usually requires complex\nexperimental setups, including positioning stages and bulky cavities, making\nthem impractical for real applications. In this paper we propose a novel way of\nbuilding fully integrated all-optical force sensors based on low-loss silicon\nnitride mechanical resonators with a photonic crystal reflector. We can\ncircumvent previous limitations in stability and complexity by simulating a\nsuspended focusing photonic crystal, purely made of silicon nitride. Our design\nallows for an all integrated sensor, built out of a single block that\nintegrates a full Fabry-P\\'{e}rot cavity, without the need for assembly or\nalignment. The presented simulations will allow for a radical simplification of\nsensors based on high-Q silicon nitride membranes. Our results comprise, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the first simulations of a focusing mirror made from a\nmechanically suspended flat membrane with subwavelength thickness. Cavity\nlengths between a few hundred $\\mu$m and mm should be directly realizable.\n", "  In models with universal extra dimensions (UED), the lightest Kaluza-Klein\nexcitation of neutral electroweak gauge bosons is a stable, weakly interacting\nmassive particle and thus is a candidate for dark matter thanks to Kaluza-Klein\nparity. We examine concrete model realizations of such dark matter in the\ncontext of non-minimal UED extensions. The boundary localized kinetic terms for\nthe electroweak gauge bosons lead to a non-trivial mixing among the first\nKaluza-Klein excitations of the ${\\rm SU}(2)_W$ and ${\\rm U}(1)_Y$ gauge bosons\nand the resultant low energy phenomenology is rich. We investigate implications\nof various experiments including low energy electroweak precision measurements,\ndirect and indirect detection of dark matter particles and direct collider\nsearches at the LHC. Notably, we show that the electroweak Kaluza-Klein dark\nmatter can be as heavy as 2.4 TeV, which is significantly higher than $1.3$ TeV\nas is indicated as an upper bound in the minimal UED model.\n", "  We present the results of a pilot near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic campaign\nof five very massive galaxies ($\\log(\\text{M}_\\star/\\text{M}_\\odot)>11.45$) in\nthe range of $1.7<z<2.7$. We measure an absorption feature redshift for one\ngalaxy at $z_\\text{spec}=2.000\\pm0.006$. For the remaining galaxies, we combine\nthe photometry with the continuum from the spectra to estimate continuum\nredshifts and stellar population properties. We define a continuum redshift\n($z_{\\rm cont}$ ) as one in which the redshift is estimated probabilistically\nusing EAZY from the combination of catalog photometry and the observed\nspectrum. We derive the uncertainties on the stellar population synthesis\nproperties using a Monte Carlo simulation and examine the correlations between\nthe parameters with and without the use of the spectrum in the modeling of the\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs). The spectroscopic constraints confirm the\nextreme stellar masses of the galaxies in our sample. We find that three out of\nfive galaxies are quiescent (star formation rate of $\\lesssim 1\nM_\\odot~yr^{-1}$) with low levels of dust obscuration ($A_{\\rm V} < 1$) , that\none galaxy displays both high levels of star formation and dust obscuration\n(${\\rm SFR} \\approx 300 M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, $A_{\\rm V} \\approx 1.7$~mag),\nand that the remaining galaxy has properties that are intermediate between the\nquiescent and star-forming populations.\n", "  Color filters have important applications in the area of Nano-spectroscopy\nand ccd imaging applications. Metallic nanostructures provide an efficient way\nto design and engineer ultrathin color filters. These nanostructures have\ncapability to split the white light into fundamental colors and enable color\nfilters with ultrahigh resolution but their efficiency can be restricted due to\nhigh losses in metals especially at the visible wavelengths. In this work, we\ndemonstrate Si nanoantennas based all-dielectric color filters, which are\nsensitive to incident-wave polarization and, thus, tunable with the aid of\npolarization angle variation. Two different information can be encoded in two\ndifferent polarization states in a single physical nanostructure. The\nnanoantenna based pixels are highly efficient and can provide high quality of\ncolors due to low losses in dielectric at optical frequencies. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that a variety of colors can be achieved by changing\nthe physical size of the nonsymmetric cross-shaped nanoantennas. The proposed\ndevices cover an extended gamut of colors on CIE-1931 chromaticity diagram due\nto the existence of high quality resonance in Si nanoantennas. The device shows\nsignificant tunability of color while operating this color filter device in\ntransmission as well as in reflection mode.\n", "  We report the magnetotransport properties of ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet\n(AFM) Fe$_2$CrSi/Ru$_2$MnGe epitaxial bilayers using current-in-plane\nconfigurations. Above the critical thickness of the Ru$_2$MnGe layer to induce\nexchange bias, symmetric and asymmetric curves were observed in response to the\ndirection of FM magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Because each magnetoresistance\ncurve showed full and partial AFM rotation, the magnetoresistance curves imply\nthe impact of the Fe$_2$CrSi magnetocrystalline anisotropy to govern the AFM\nrotation. The maximum magnitude of the angular-dependent resistance-change\nratio of the bilayers is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of\nsingle-layer Fe$_2$CrSi films, resulting from the reorientation of AFM spins\nvia the FM rotation. These results highlight the essential role of controlling\nthe AFM rotation and reveal a facile approach to detect the AFM moment even in\ncurrent-in-plane configurations in FM/AFM bilayers.\n", "  The contraction method is a procedure that allows to establish non-trivial\nrelations between Lie algebras and has had succesful applications in both\nmathematics and theoretical physics. This work deals with generalizations of\nthe contraction procedure with a main focus in the so called S-expansion method\nas it includes most of the other generalized contractions. Basically, the\nS-exansion combines a Lie algebra $\\mathcal{G}$ with a finite abelian semigroup\n$S$ in order to define new S-expanded algebras. After giving a description of\nthe main ingredients used in this paper, we present a Java library that\nautomatizes the S-expansion procedure. With this computational tool we are able\nto represent Lie algebras and semigroups, so we can perform S-expansions of Lie\nalgebras using arbitrary semigroups. We explain how the library methods has\nbeen constructed and how they work; then we give a set of example programs\naimed to solve different problems. They are presented so that any user can\neasily modify them to perform his own calculations, without being necessarily\nan expert in Java. Finally, some comments about further developements and\npossible new applications are made.\n", "  The Bayreuth Festspielhaus is well known for its architecture because its\ndesign is heavily influenced by composer Richard Wagner. Due to the special\nacoustic design, the reverberation time (i.e., time scale for the sound\npressure level to decay $60$~dB) is larger than usual opera houses. Using\nhand-claps and smart phone recordings, I measured the impulse response of the\nBayreuth Festspielhaus in the auditorium, on the stage, as well as in the\norchestra pit. The measured reverberation time shows quantitative agreement\nwith the literature values within a certain frequency range, demonstrating the\npossibility of using this approach to monitor room acoustics.\n", "  We employ first-principles calculations to study the mechanical, geometrical,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of Fe atom embedded s-triazine\n($\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$) system under the influence of\nexternal environment. Our results show that the binding energy of\n$\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ can be modulated by an applied\ntensile deformation and perpendicular electric field. The non-magnetic\nsemiconducting property of pure s-triazine sheet (${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$)\nis found to change upon embedding of Fe atom in the porous site of the sheet.\nIt is revealed that the $\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ system\nexhibits half-metallic electronic character with a magnetic moment in the the\norder similar to that of an isolated Fe atom. Furthermore, electronic and\nmagnetic properties of the $\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ systems\nare preserved up to a maximum value of 10 V/nm in electric field strength and\n6\\% tensile strain. Interestingly, we find that the half-metallic electronic\ncharacter of $\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ system can be tuned\ninto a semiconductor via adsorption of atoms and molecules into the\n$\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ system. The magnetic moment of\n$\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ with adsorbed atoms/molecules is\nalso modified. Our findings may serve as a guide for future applications of\n$\\mathrm{Fe}$@${\\mathrm C_6}{\\mathrm N_6}$ structures in spintronics devices.\n", "  By means of a recently-proposed metric or structural derivative, called\nscale-q-derivative approach, we formulate differential equation that models the\ncell death by a radiation exposure in tumor treatments. The considered\nindependent variable here is the absorbed radiation dose D instead of usual\ntime. The survival factor, Fs, for radiation damaged cell obtained here is in\nagreement with the literature on the maximum entropy principle, as it was\nrecently shown and also exhibits an excellent agreement with the experimental\ndata. Moreover, the well-known linear and quadratic models are obtained. With\nthis approach, we give a step forward and suggest other expressions for\nsurvival factors that are dependent on the complex tumor structure.\n", "  We treat the stationary nonlinear Schroodinger equation on two-dimensional\nbranched domains, so-called fat graphs. The shrinking limit when the domain\nbecomes one-dimensional metric graph is studied by using analytical estimate of\nthe convergence of fat graph boundary conditions into those for metric graph.\nDetailed analysis of such convergence on the basis of numerical solution of\nstationary nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a fat graph is provided.\nPossibility for reproducing different metric graph boundary conditions studied\nin earlier works is shown. Practical applications of the proposed model for\nsuch problems as Bose-Einstein condensation in networks, branched optical\nmedia, DNA, conducting polymers and wave dynamics in branched capillary\nnetworks are discussed.\n", "  We study the magnetic field effects on the diluted spin-ice materials using\nthe replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulation. We observe five plateaus in the\nmagnetization curve of the diluted nearest-neighbor spin-ice model on the\npyrochlore lattice when a magnetic field is applied in the [111] direction.\nThis is in contrast to the case of the pure model with two plateaus. The origin\nof five plateaus is investigated from the spin configuration of two\ncorner-sharing tetrahedra in the case of the diluted model.\n", "  The basic principles of self-organization of one-component charged particles,\nconfined in disk and circular parabolic potentials, are proposed. A system of\nequations is derived, that allows us to determine equilibrium configurations\nfor an arbitrary, but finite, number of charged particles that are distributed\nover several rings. Our approach reduces significantly the computational effort\nin minimizing the energy of equilibrium configurations and demonstrates a\nremarkable agreement with the values provided by molecular dynamics\ncalculations. With the increase of particle number n>180 we find a steady\nformation of a centered hexagonal lattice that smoothly transforms to valence\ncircular rings in the ground state configurations for both potentials.\n", "  We study a two-dimensional fermionic cloud of repulsive alkali-metal atoms\ncharacterized by two hyperfine states which are Rabi coupled. Within a\nvariational Hartree-Fock scheme, we calculate analytically the ground-state\nenergy of the system. Then we determine the conditions under which there is a\nquantum phase transition with spontaneous symmetry breaking from a\nspin-balanced configuration to a spin-polarized one, an effect known as\nitinerant ferromagnetism. Interestingly, we find that the transition appears\nwhen the interaction energy per particle exceedes both the kinetic energy per\nparticle and the Rabi coupling energy. The itinerant ferromagnetism of the\npolarized phase is analyzed, obtaining the population imbalance as a function\nof interaction strength, Rabi coupling, and number density. Finally, the\ninclusion of a external harmonic confinement is investigated by adopting the\nlocal density approximation. We predict that a single atomic cloud can display\npopulation imbalance near the center of the trap and a fully balanced\nconfiguration at the periphery.\n", "  Band gap tuning in two-dimensional transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nis crucial in fabricating new optoelectronic devices. High resolution\nphotoluminescence (PL) microscopy is needed for accurate band gap\ncharacterization. We performed tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL)\nmeasurements of monolayer MoSe2 with nanoscale spatial resolution, providing an\nimproved characterization of the band gap correlated with the topography\ncompared with the conventional far field spectroscopy. We also observed PL\nshifts at the edges and investigated the spatial dependence of the TEPL\nenhancement factors.\n", "  We investigate the criterion for the acoustic mechanism to work successfully\nin core-collapse supernovae. The acoustic mechanism is an alternative to the\nneutrino-heating mechanism. It was proposed by Burrows et al., who claimed that\nacoustic waves emitted by $g$-mode oscillations in proto-neutron stars (PNS)\nenergize a stalled shock wave and eventually induce an explosion. Previous\nworks mainly studied to which extent the $g$-modes are excited in the PNS. In\nthis paper, on the other hand, we investigate how strong the acoustic wave\nneeds to be if it were to revive a stalled shock wave. By adding the acoustic\npower as a new axis, we draw a critical surface, an extension of the critical\ncurve commonly employed in the context of neutrino heating. We perform both 1D\nand 2D parametrized simulations, in which we inject acoustic waves from the\ninner boundary. In order to quantify the power of acoustic waves, we use the\nextended Myers theory to take neutrino reactions into proper account. We find\nfor the 1D simulations that rather large acoustic powers are required to\nrelaunch the shock wave, since the additional heating provided by the secondary\nshocks developed from acoustic waves is partially canceled by the neutrino\ncooling that is also enhanced. In 2D, the required acoustic powers are\nconsistent with those of Burrows et al. Our results seem to imply, however,\nthat it is the sum of neutrino heating and acoustic powers that matters for\nshock revival.\n", "  In this paper, we present a method for computing the marginal likelihood,\nalso known as the model likelihood or Bayesian evidence, from Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC), or other sampled posterior distributions. In order to do\nthis, one needs to be able to estimate the density of points in parameter\nspace, and this can be challenging in high numbers of dimensions. Here we\npresent a Bayesian analysis, where we obtain the posterior for the marginal\nlikelihood, using $k$th nearest-neighbour distances in parameter space, using\nthe Mahalanobis distance metric, under the assumption that the points in the\nchain (thinned if required) are independent. We generalise the algorithm to\napply to importance-sampled chains, where each point is assigned a weight. We\nillustrate this with an idealised posterior of known form with an analytic\nmarginal likelihood, and show that for chains of length $\\sim 10^5$ points, the\ntechnique is effective for parameter spaces with up to $\\sim 20$ dimensions. We\nalso argue that $k=1$ is the optimal choice, and discuss failure modes for the\nalgorithm. In a companion paper (Heavens et al. 2017) we apply the technique to\nthe main MCMC chains from the 2015 Planck analysis of cosmic background\nradiation data, to infer that quantitatively the simplest 6-parameter flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM standard model of cosmology is preferred over all extensions\nconsidered.\n", "  We design a deterministic polynomial time $c^n$ approximation algorithm for\nthe permanent of positive semidefinite matrices where $c=e^{\\gamma+1}\\simeq\n4.84$. We write a natural convex relaxation and show that its optimum solution\ngives a $c^n$ approximation of the permanent. We further show that this factor\nis asymptotically tight by constructing a family of positive semidefinite\nmatrices.\n", "  In the present paper, new classes of wavelet functions are presented in the\nframework of Clifford analysis. Firstly, some classes of orthogonal polynomials\nare provided based on 2-parameters weight functions. Such classes englobe the\nwell known ones of Jacobi and Gegenbauer polynomials when relaxing one of the\nparameters. The discovered polynomial sets are next applied to introduce new\nwavelet functions. Reconstruction formula as well as Fourier-Plancherel rules\nhave been proved.\n", "  In the present paper, by extending some fractional calculus to the framework\nof Cliffors analysis, new classes of wavelet functions are presented. Firstly,\nsome classes of monogenic polynomials are provided based on 2-parameters weight\nfunctions which extend the classical Jacobi ones in the context of Clifford\nanalysis. The discovered polynomial sets are next applied to introduce new\nwavelet functions. Reconstruction formula as well as Fourier-Plancherel rules\nhave been proved. The main tool reposes on the extension of fractional\nderivatives, fractional integrals and fractional Fourier transforms to Clifford\nanalysis.\n", "  In this paper, we apply F-calculus on fractal Koch and Ces\\`aro curves with\ndifferent dimensions. Generalized Newton's second law on the fractal Koch and\nCes\\`aro curves is suggested. Density of moving particles which absorbed on\nfractal Ces\\`aro are derived. More, illustrative examples are given to present\nthe details of F-integrals and F-derivatives.\n", "  Results of analysis of 23 events of the 2014-2015 mutual event series from\nthe Vainu Bappu Observatory are presented. Our intensity distribution model for\nthe eclipsed/occulted satellite is based on the criterion that it simulates a\nrotational light curve that matches the ground based light curve. Dichotomy in\nthe scattering characteristics of the leading and trailing sides explain the\nbasic shape of the rotational light curves of Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In\ncase of Io the albedo map from USGS along with global values of scattering\nparameters work well. Mean values of residuals in $(O-C)$ along and\nperpendicular to the track are found to be -3.3 and -3.4 mas respectively\ncompared to \"L2\" theory for the seven 2E1/2O1 events. The corresponding R.M.S\nvalues are 8.7 and 7.8 mas respectively. For the five 1E3/1O3 events, the along\nand perpendicular to the track mean residuals are 5.6 and 3.2 mas respectively.\nThe corresponding R.M.S. residuals are 6.8 and 10.5 mas respectively. We\ncompare the results using the chosen model (Model 1) with a uniform but limb\ndarkened disk (Model 2). The residuals with Model 2 of the 2E1/2O1 and 1E3/1O3\nevents indicate a bias along the satellite track. The extent and direction of\nbias is consistent with the shift of the light center from the geometric\ncenter. Results using Model 1, which intrinsically takes into account the\nintensity distribution show no such bias.\n", "  The rich-club concept has been introduced in order to characterize the\npresence of a cohort of nodes with a large number of links (rich nodes) that\ntend to be well connected between each other, creating a tight group (club).\nRich-clubness defines the extent to which a network displays a topological\norganization characterized by the presence of a node rich-club. It is crucial\nfor the investigation of internal organization and function of networks arising\nin systems of disparate fields such as transportation, social, communication\nand neuroscience. Different methods have been proposed for assessing the\nrich-clubness and various null-models have been adopted for performing\nstatistical tests. However, a procedure that assigns a unique value of\nrich-clubness significance to a given network is still missing. Our solution to\nthis problem grows on the basis of three new pillars. We introduce: i) a\nnull-model characterized by a lower rich-club coefficient; ii) a fair strategy\nto normalize the level of rich-clubness of a network in respect to the\nnull-model; iii) a statistical test that, exploiting the maximum deviation of\nthe normalized rich-club coefficient attributes a unique p-value of\nrich-clubness to a given network. In conclusion, this study proposes the first\nattempt to quantify, using a unique measure, whether a network presents a\nsignificant rich-club topological organization. The general impact of our study\non engineering and science is that simulations investigating how the functional\nperformance of a network is changing in relation to rich-clubness might be more\neasily tuned controlling one unique value: the proposed rich-clubness measure.\n", "  Squeezed states of light have been successfully employed in interferometric\ngravitational-wave detectors to reduce quantum noise, thus becoming one of the\nmost promising options for extending the astrophysical reach of the generation\nof detectors currently under construction worldwide. In these advanced\ninstruments, quantum noise will limit sensitivity over the entire detection\nband. Therefore, to obtain the greatest benefit from squeezing, the injected\nsqueezed state must be filtered using a long-storage-time optical resonator, or\n\"filter cavity\", so as to realise a frequency dependent rotation of the\nsqueezed quadrature. Whilst the ultimate performance of a filter cavity is\ndetermined by its storage time, several practical decoherence and degradation\nmechanisms limit the experimentally achievable quantum noise reduction. In this\npaper we develop an analytical model to explore these mechanisms in detail. As\nan example, we apply our results to the 16 m filter cavity design currently\nunder consideration for the Advanced LIGO interferometers.\n", "  In this talk we present results obtained when fluid dynamical fluctuations\nare included in relativistic $3+1$ dimensional viscous fluid dynamics. We\ndiscuss effects of the interactions of fluctuations due to nonlinearities and\nthe cutoff dependence.\n", "  Phase-contrast X-ray imaging can improve the visibility of weakly absorbing\nobjects (e.g. soft tissues) by an order of magnitude or more compared to\nconventional radiographs. Previously, it has been shown that combining phase\nretrieval with computed tomography (CT) can increase the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) by up to two orders of magnitude over conventional CT at the same\nradiation dose, without loss of image quality. Our experiments reveal that as\nradiation dose decreases, the relative improvement in SNR increases. We\ndiscovered this enhancement can be traded for a reduction in dose greater than\nthe square of the gain in SNR. Upon reducing the dose 300 fold, the\nphase-retrieved SNR was still almost 10 times larger than the absorption\ncontrast data. This reveals the potential for dose reduction factors in the\ntens of thousands without loss in image quality, which would have a profound\nimpact on medical and industrial imaging applications.\n", "  We present the first demonstration of real-time closed-loop control and\ndeterministic tuning of an independently suspended Fabry-Perot optical cavity\nusing digitally-enhanced heterodyne interferometry, realising a peak\nsensitivity of $\\sim$10 pm$/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ over the 10-1000 Hz frequency\nband. The methods presented are readily extensible to multiple coupled\ncavities. As such, we anticipate that refinements of this technique may find\napplication in future interferometric gravitational-wave detectors.\n", "  It has been suggested that the next generation of interferometric\ngravitational wave detectors may observe spontaneously excited parametric\noscillatory instabilities. We present a method of actively suppressing any such\ninstability through application of electrostatic forces to the interferometers'\ntest masses. Using numerical methods we quantify the actuation force required\nto damp candidate instabilities and find that such forces are readily\nachievable. Our predictions are subsequently verified experimentally using\nprototype Advanced LIGO hardware, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness\nof our approach.\n", "  Thermal effects are already important in currently operating interferometric\ngravitational wave detectors. Planned upgrades of these detectors involve\nincreasing optical power to combat quantum shot noise. We consider the\nramifications of this increased power for one particular class of laser\nbeams--wide, flat-topped, mesa beams. In particular we model a single mesa beam\nFabry-Perot cavity having thermoelastically deformed mirrors. We calculate the\nintensity profile of the fundamental cavity eigenmode in the presence of\nthermal perturbations, and the associated changes in thermal noise. We also\noutline an idealized method of correcting for such effects. At each stage we\ncontrast our results with those of a comparable Gaussian beam cavity. Although\nwe focus on mesa beams the techniques described are applicable to any\nazimuthally symmetric system.\n", "  This article provides an overview of the modeling of the effective\nthermomechanical properties of the multifunctional carbon nanotube (CNT)\nreinforced hybrid composites for advanced structural applications. The novel\nconstructional feature of such multifunctional CNT-reinforced hybrid composite\nis that CNTs are radially grown on the circumferential surfaces of the carbon\nfiber reinforcements. Several micromechanical models have been developed to\npredict the effective thermomechanical properties of these multifunctional\nCNT-reinforced hybrid composites. The waviness of CNTs is intrinsic to many\nmanufacturing processes and influences the thermomechanical behavior of\nCNT-reinforced composites. An endeavor has also been made to investigate the\neffect of wavy CNTs on the thermomechanical properties of the multifunctional\nCNT-reinforced hybrid composites. Radially aligned CNTs grown on the\ncircumferential surfaces of the carbon fibers assure that the CNT-reinforced\nhybrid composites are truly multifunctional and may be a promising advanced\nnext generation composite for structural applications.\n", "  We have calculated the Orbital Angular Momentum of quarks and gluons in the\nnucleon. The calculations are carried out in the next to leading order\nutilizing the so-called valon model. It is found that the average quark orbital\nangular momentum is positive, but small, and the average gluon orbital angular\nmomentum is negative and large. We also report on some regularities about the\ntotal angular momentum of the quarks and the gluon, as well as on the orbital\nangular momentum of the separate partons. We have also provided partonic\nangular momentum, $L^{q,g}$ as a function of $Q^2$.\n", "  Coupled modified nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger(CMNLS) equations describe the\npulse propagation in the picosecond or femtosecond regime of the birefringent\noptical fibers. In this paper, we use the Fokas method to analyze the\ninitial-boundary value problem for the CMNLS equations on the half-line. Assume\nthat the solution u(x,t) and v(x,t) of CMNLS equations are exists, and we show\nthat it can be expressed in terms of the unique solution of a matrix\nRiemann-Hilbert problem formulated in the plane of the complex spectral\nparameter {\\lambda}.\n", "  Governing equations for two-dimensional inviscid free-surface flows with\nconstant vorticity over arbitrary non-uniform bottom profile are presented in\nexact and compact form using conformal variables. An efficient and very\naccurate numerical method for this problem is developed.\n", "  We study the expansion coefficients of the tau function of the KP hierarchy.\nIf the tau function does not vanish at the origin, it is known that the\ncoefficients are given by Giambelli formula and that it characterizes solutions\nof the KP hierarchy. In this paper, we find a generalization of Giambelli\nformula to the case when the tau function vanishes at the origin. Again it\ncharacterizes solutions of the KP hierarchy.\n", "  We study the capacity of a quantum channel where channel acts like controlled\nphase gate with the control being provided by a one-dimensional quantum spin\nchain environment. Due to the correlations in the spin chain, we get a quantum\nchannel with memory. We derive formulas for the quantum capacity of this\nchannel when the spin state is a matrix product state. Particularly, we derive\nexact formulas for the capacity of the quantum memory channel when the\nenvironment state is the ground state of the AKLT model and the Majumdar-Ghosh\nmodel. We find that the behavior of the capacity for the range of the\nparameters is analytic.\n", "  The $D$-dimensional harmonic system (i.e., a particle moving under the action\nof a quadratic potential) is, together with the hydrogenic system, the main\nprototype of the physics of multidimensional quantum systems. In this work we\nrigorously determine the leading term of the Heisenberg-like and entropy-like\nuncertainty measures of this system as given by the radial expectation values\nand the R\\'enyi entropies, respectively, at the limit of large $D$. The\nassociated multidimensional position-momentum uncertainty relations are\ndiscussed, showing that they saturate the corresponding general ones. A\nconjecture about the Shannon-like uncertainty relation is given and an\ninteresting phenomenon is observed: the Heisenberg-like and\nR\\'enyi-entropy-based equality-type uncertainty relations for all the\n$D$-dimensional harmonic oscillator states in the pseudoclassical ($D \\to\n\\infty$) limit are the same as the corresponding ones for the hydrogenic\nsystems, despite the so different character of the oscillator and Coulomb\npotentials.\n", "  We image vortex creep at very low temperatures using Scanning Tunneling\nMicroscopy (STM) in the superconductor Rh$_9$In$_4$S$_4$ ($T_c$=2.25 K). We\nmeasure the superconducting gap of Rh$_9$In$_4$S$_4$, finding $\\Delta\\approx\n0.33$meV and image a hexagonal vortex lattice up to close to H$_{c2}$,\nobserving slow vortex creep at temperatures as low as 150 mK. We estimate\nthermal and quantum barriers for vortex motion and show that thermal\nfluctuations likely cause vortex creep, in spite of being at temperatures\n$T/T_c<0.1$. We study creeping vortex lattices by making images during long\ntimes and show that the vortex lattice remains hexagonal during creep with\nvortices moving along one of the high symmetry axis of the vortex lattice.\nFurthermore, the creep velocity changes with the scanning window suggesting\nthat creep depends on the local arrangements of pinning centers. Vortices\nfluctuate on small scale erratic paths, indicating that the vortex lattice\nmakes jumps trying different arrangements during its travel along the main\ndirection for creep. The images provide a visual account of how vortex lattice\nmotion maintains hexagonal order, while showing dynamic properties\ncharacteristic of a glass.\n", "  This paper extends the $T$-$\\Omega$ formulation for eddy currents based on\nhigher order hierarchical basis functions so that it can deal with conductors\nof arbitrary topology. To this aim we supplement the classical hierarchical\nbasis functions with non-local basis functions spanning the first de Rham\ncohomology group of the insulating region. Such non-local basis functions may\nbe efficiently found in negligible time with the recently introduced\nD{\\l}otko--Specogna (DS) algorithm.\n", "  New photometric follow-up observations of exoplanet transits of 'hot\nJupiters' TrES-3b and Qatar-1b are presented. Weighted mean values of the\nsolutions of light curves in R-fiter for both planetary systems are reported\nand compared with the previous results. The transit light curves were analysed\nusing the WINFITTER code. The physical properties of the planets were\nestimated. The planet radii are found to be $R_p = 1.381 \\pm 0.033 R_J$ for\nTrES-3b and $R_p = 1.142 \\pm 0.025 R_J$ for Qatar-1b. Transit times and their\nuncertainties were also determined and a new linear ephemeris was computed for\nboth systems. Analysis of transit times showed that a significant signal could\nnot be determined for TrES-3b, while weak evidence was found for Qatar-1b,\nwhich might be tested using more precise future transit times.\n", "  There have been many speculations about the character of the dusty object\nmoving fast in the vicinity of the Galactic centre black hole. The recent\ndetection of polarized continuum emission provides new constraints for the\nmodels. The fact that the object is intrinsically polarized implies that it is\nnon-spherical. The authors propose that a young star developing a bow shock can\nexplain the main characteristics. However, more observations in the future are\nneeded for the final confirmation of the nature of the source.\n", "  We study Bianchi type-I space time with cosmological constant lambda using\nsome conditions.\n", "  A spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type V cosmological model of\nthe universe for perfect fluid within the framework of Scale covariant theory\nof gravitation proposed by Canuto et al., is studied in view of a variable\ndeceleration parameter which yields the average scale factor\n$a=sinh^{(1/n)}(\\beta t)$ where $\\beta$ and $n$ are constants. The solution\nrepresents a singular model of the universe. All physical and geometrical\nproperties of the model are thoroughly studied. The time dependent deceleration\nparameter supports the recent observation. The model represents an accelerating\nphase for $0<n<1$ and for $n>1$, there is a phase transition from early\ndeceleration to a present accelerating phase.\n", "  The nonlinear fluid theory developed by Schamel suggests a modified KdV\nequation to describe the temporal evolution of ion acoustic (IA) solitons in\nthe presence of trapped electrons. The validity of this theory is studied here\nby verifying solitons main characteristic, i.e., stability against successive\nmutual collisions. We have employed a kinetic model as a more comprehensive\ntheory than the fluid one, and utilized a fully kinetic simulation approach\n(both ions and electrons are treated based on the Vlasov equation). In the\nsimulation approach, these solitons are excited self-consistently by employing\nthe nonlinear process of IA solitons formation from an initial density\nperturbation (IDP). The effect of the size of IDPs on the chain formation is\nproved by the simulation code as a benchmark test. It is shown that the IA\nsolitons, in presence of trapped electrons, can retain their features (both in\nspatial and velocity direction) after successive mutual collisions. The\ncollisions here include encounters of IA solitons with the same trapping\nparameter, while differing in size. Kinetic simulation results reveal a\ncomplicated behavior during a collision between IA solitons in contrast to the\nfluid theory predictions and simulations. In the range of parameters considered\nhere two oppositely propagating solitons rotate around their collective center\nin the phase space during a collision, independent of their trapping\nparameters. Furthermore, they exchange some portions of their trapped\npopulations.\n", "  In the present note we show that the recently established connections between\nsoft theorems, large gauge transformations and memories are persistant in the\ninfrared safe formulation of quantum field theory. They take a different and\nsimplified form and can all be derived from the non-trivial asymptotic dynamics\nthat is proper to any theory with massless fields. Several results in this\npaper had already been presented in one form or another with varying\ninterpretations. The new parts here are an improved derivation of charges for\nlarge gauge transformations in the framework of non-trivial asymptotic\ndynamics, the connection to the classical memory effect and an overall more\nunified and accessible treatment of the topic. Since the formulation of QFT\nwithout infrared divergences is physically more appealing, the infrared safe\nversion of the above connections should be so as well.\n", "  Experimental studies were carried out on the motions and transformations of\nliquid metal in ionic liquid under applied electric field. The induced vortex\nrings and flows of ionic liquid were determined via the photographs taken\nsequentially over the experiments. The polarization of electric double layer of\nliquid metals was employed to explain the flow of ionic liquid with the\npresence of liquid metal. Unlike former observation of liquid metal machine in\nconventional solution, no gas bubble was generated throughout the whole\nexperiments, which makes it possible to encapsulate the liquid system for\nfabricating soft robots.\n", "  Current induced magnetization manipulation is a key issue for spintronic\napplication. Therefore, deterministic switching of the magnetization at the\npicoseconds timescale with a single electronic pulse represents a major step\ntowards the future developments of ultrafast spintronic. Here, we have studied\nthe ultrafast magnetization dynamics in engineered Gdx[FeCo]1-x based structure\nto compare the effect of femtosecond laser and hot-electrons pulses. We\ndemonstrate that a single femtosecond hot-electrons pulse allows a\ndeterministic magnetization reversal in either Gd-rich and FeCo-rich alloys\nsimilarly to a femtosecond laser pulse. In addition, we show that the limiting\nfactor of such manipulation for perpendicular magnetized films arises from the\nmulti-domain formation due to dipolar interaction. By performing time resolved\nmeasurements under various field, we demonstrate that the same magnetization\ndynamics is observed for both light and hot-electrons excitation and that the\nfull magnetization reversal take place within 5 ps. The energy efficiency of\nthe ultra-fast current induced magnetization manipulation is optimized thanks\nto the ballistic transport of hot-electrons before reaching the GdFeCo magnetic\nlayer.\n", "  Two-dimension (2D) semiconductor materials have attracted much attention and\nresearch interest for their novel properties suitable for electronic and\noptoelectronic applications. In this paper, we have proposed an idea in new 2D\nmaterials design by using adjacent group elements to substitute half of the\natoms in the primitive configurations to form isoelectronic compounds. We have\nsuccessfully taken this idea on group V monolayers and have obtained many\nunexplored Group IV-V-VI monolayer compounds: P2SiS, As2SiS, As2GeSe, Sb2GeSe,\nSb2SnTe, and Bi2SnTe. Relative formation energy calculations, phonon spectrum\ncalculations, as well as finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations\nconfirm their stability and DFT calculations indicate that they are all\nsemiconductors. This idea broadens the scope of group V semiconductors and we\nbelieve it can be extended to other type of 2D materials to obtain new\nsemiconductors with better properties for optoelectronic and electronic\napplications.\n", "  In ideal compressible hydrodynamics there is an isomorphism between spatially\none-dimensional unstea- dy and two-dimensional steady supersonic flow called\npiston analogy [7]. This notice shows that this is also true for\nnon-equilibrium magnetosonic flow under alignment of undisturbed flow and\nmagnetic field in case of steady flow. An example for two generic problems,\ni.e. the signal problem of radiation into a half space and steady flow along a\nkinked wall bounding a half space, is given.\n", "  In photovoltaics (PVs) and artificial photosynthetic systems based on\nexcitons, the question of how energy must be lost in overcoming the Coulomb\nbarrier, converting excitons to free charges, is fundamental, as it determines\nthe achievable open-circuit voltage or over-potential1-3. Here, using transient\nand steady-state optical spectroscopy we study a model system, pentacene/C60,\nwhere pentacene triplet excitons are dissociated to form charge transfer\nstates, which we show to be degenerate in energy with the triplet excitons. We\ndirectly track these charge transfer states undergoing efficient long-range\nseparation to free charges within 50 ps, despite a significant Coulomb barrier\nthat we measure to be 220 meV. We model this endothermic charge separation to\nbe driven by entropic gain. Our results demonstrate that endothermic charge\nseparation can proceed rapidly with near unity efficiency, overcoming Coulomb\nbarriers greater than 200meV via a gain in entropy, thus minimising loss of\nopen-circuit voltage or over-potential. In the pentacene/C60 system this leads\nhere to an effective VOC loss of only 400meV with respect to the energy of the\ntriplet exciton. This suggests that excitonic photoconversion systems have no\nfundamental disadvantage compared to systems which generate free changes\ndirectly upon photoexcitation.\n", "  This paper presents a new method to model X-ray scattering on random rough\nsurfaces. It combines the approaches we presented in two previous papers --\n\\zs\\cite{zhao03} \\& \\pz\\cite{zhao15}. An actual rough surface is (incompletely)\ndescribed by its Power Spectral Density (PSD). For a given PSD, model surfaces\nwith the same roughness as the actual surface are constructed by preserving the\nPSD amplitudes and assigning a random phase to each spectral component. Rays\nrepresenting the incident wave are reflected from the model surface and\nprojected onto a flat plane, which is the first order approximation of the\nmodel surface, as outgoing rays and corrected for phase delays. The projected\noutgoing rays are then corrected for wave densities and redistributed onto an\nuniform grid where the model surface is constructed. The scattering is then\ncalculated using the Fourier Transform of the resulting distribution. This\nmethod provides the exact solutions for scattering in all directions, without\nsmall angle approximation. It is generally applicable to any wave scatterings\non random rough surfaces and is not limited to small scattering angles.\nExamples are given for the Chandra X-ray Observatory optics. This method is\nalso useful for the future generation X-ray astronomy missions.\n", "  We derive an effective Hamiltonian at low energies for bilayer graphene when\nFermi velocity manufactured on each layer is different of the velocity measured\nin pristine graphene. Based on the effective Hamiltonian, we investigate the\ninfluence of Fermi velocity asymmetry on the band structure of trigonally\nwarped bilayer graphene in the presence of interlayer applied bias. In this\ncase, the Fermi line at low energies is still preserved its threefold\nrotational symmetry appearing as the three pockets. Furthermore, the interlayer\nasymmetry in Fermi velocities leads to an indirect band gap which its value is\ntunable by the velocity ratio of the top to bottom layer. It is also found that\none of the origins for emerging the electron-hole asymmetry in the band\nstructure, is the velocity asymmetry which is large around the trigonal\npockets.\n", "  In the framework of semiclassical resonances, we make more precise the link\nbetween polynomial estimates of the extension of the resolvent and propagation\nof the singularities through the trapped set. This approach makes it possible\nto eliminate infinity and to concentrate the study near the trapped set. It has\nallowed us in previous papers to obtain the asymptotic of resonances in various\ngeometric situations.\n", "  This paper is devoted to the problem of choosing the most suitable model of a\ngeometrical system for describing the real crystallographic space. It has been\nshown that all 230 crystallographic groups used to describe the crystalline\nstructures in a Euclidean space can be presented by elliptic motions in the\nclosed space $V^3$. Based on these results, it is stated that a special\ngeometric system---the crystallographic space of interpretation $R_E$,\ndetermined by a form of an interpretant (the surface of a torus $T^2$ can serve\nas this interpretant)---can serve as a geometrical model of the real\ncrystallographic space. The compact model of the closed structure of a crystal\nhas been proposed and ways of its treatment for visualizing the constructions\nof elements of symmetry of a crystalline lattice in the Euclidean space $E^3$\nhave been determined. As a modeling space for describing the internal structure\nof a crystal, the closed space $V^3$ with the elliptic metrics and constant\npositive Gaussian curvature ($K=1$) has been offered. The properties of the\ninternal space of a real crystal are naturally deduced from the properties of\nthe modeling space.\n", "  The article describes a new approach to obtaining the energy-momentum tensor\nof electromagnetic field in medium without the use of Maxwell's equations and\nPoynting theorem. The energy-momentum tensor has new qualities and\nconsequences. Its linear invariant is Lagrange density of the electromagnetic\nfield. From the tensor follows the equation of conservation of energy density,\nthe equation of flux energy density and wave equations for these energy values.\nWave equation for momentum density describes simultaneous transfer of momentum\nand angular momentum regardless of radiation polarization. From the tensor\nfollow the balance equations of the electromagnetic forces for the momentum\ndensity in the forms of the Minkowski and Abraham, which proves their equality\nand mutual supplementation. Equation for Abraham force is obtained as well. It\nis shown that its divergence is equal to zero. Tensor and the balance equations\nof electromagnetic forces in a continuous medium are derived.\n", "  We report about the experimental observation and characterization of\nnonlinear optical properties of individual silicon nanowires of different\ndimensions. Our results show that the nonlinear light has different components,\none of them corresponding to the second harmonic generation (SHG). The SHG\nstrongly depends on the polarization of the optical excitation and nanowire\ndiameter, and gives access to the local electromagnetic field intensity\ndistribution. Furthermore, we show that the second harmonic, when observed, is\nenhanced compared to bulk silicon and is sensitive to optical resonances\nsupported by the nanowires. This offers different perspectives on the\ndefinition of silicon-based nonlinear photonic devices.\n", "  We formulate a simple condition for reconstructibility of a certain class of\nHamiltonians with real potentials from the knowledge of their complex-valued\neigenfunctions. This may be relevant to the question of preparability of\nquantum states raised by W. Lamb in his 1969 paper on operational\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. Of particular interest to engineering\napplications are: (a) an exotic case of an upside-down harmonic-oscillator-type\npotential (a variation of the inverted \"Mexican hat\" potential) whose\nsquare-integrable complex eigenfunction describes a localized scattering state\nsimilar to the \"bound state in the continuum\" of von Neumann and Wigner, and\n(b) a spatially confined scattering state of a particle moving in an infinite\nwell with the properly shaped potential bottom.\n", "  Using the Dirac and the Yang monopole in spinor condensates as examples, we\nshow that interactions can stretch the point singularity of a monopole into an\nextended manifold, whose shape is strongly influenced by the sign of\ninteraction. The singular manifold will cause the first and second Chern number\nto assume non-integer values when it intersects the surface on which the Chern\nnumbers are calculated. This leads to a gradual decrease of the Chern numbers\nas the monopole moves away from the surface of integration, instead of the\nsudden jump characteristic of a point monopole. A gradual change in $C_2$ has\nin fact been observed in the recent experiment by Spielman's group at NIST. By\nmeasuring the range of non-integer values of the Chern numbers as the monopole\nmoves away from the surface of integration along different directions, one can\nmap out the shape of the singular manifold in the parameter space.\n", "  Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) has been widely used as\nmonochromators, analyzers and filters at neutron and X-ray scattering\nfacilities. In this Letter we report the first observation of an anomalous\nneutron Halo scattering of HOPG. The scattering projects a ring onto the\ndetector with half cone angle of 12.4 degree that surprisingly persists to\nincident neutron wavelengths far beyond the Bragg cutoff for graphite (6.71 A).\nAt longer wavelengths the ring is clearly a doublet with a splitting roughly\nproportional to wavelength. While the ring centers at the beam position if the\nbeam is normal to the basal planes of HOPG, sample tilting results in the shift\nof the ring towards the same direction. The angle of ring shift is observed to\nbe less than the sample tilts, which is wavelength dependent with longer\nwavelengths providing larger shifts. Additionally, upon tilting, the ring\nbroadens and splits into a doublet at the low angle side with short wavelength\nneutrons whereas only subtle broadening is observed at longer wavelengths. The\nring broadens and weakens with decreasing HOPG quality. We also notice that the\nintensity at the ring positions scales with the sample thickness. The ring\nvanishes as the sample is cooled down to 30 K, suggesting that the lattice\ndynamics of graphite is one of the factors that cause the scattering ring. A\npossible interpretation by combining inelastic scattering and Yoneda scattering\nis proposed.\n", "  We investigate the stability of a statistically stationary conductive state\nfor Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection between stress-free plates that arises due to\na bulk stochastic internal heating. This setup may be seen as a generalization\nto a stochastic setting of the seminal 1916 study of Lord Rayleigh. Our results\nindicate that stochastic forcing at small magnitude has a stabilizing effect,\nwhile strong stochastic forcing has a destabilizing effect. The methodology put\nforth in this article, which combines rigorous analysis with careful\ncomputation, also provides an approach to hydrodynamic stability for a variety\nof systems subject to a large scale stochastic forcing.\n", "  We investigate the elastic wave propagation in various hyperelastic materials\nwhich subjected to simple-shear deformation. Two compressible types of three\nconventional hyperelastic models are considered. We found pure elastic wave\nmodes can be obtained in compressible neo-Hookean materials constructed by\nadding a bulk strain energy term to the incompressible strain energy function.\nWhereas for the compressible hyperelastic models which are reformulate into\ndeviatoric and hydrostatic parts, only quasi modes can propagate, with abnormal\nray directions can be observed for longitudinal waves. Moreover, the influences\nof material constants, material compressibility and external deformations on\nthe propagation and refraction for elastic waves in these hyperelastic models\nare systematically studied. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate\nthe theoretical results. This investigation may open a promising route for the\nrealization of next generation metamaterials and novel wave manipulation\ndevices.\n", "  We report thickness dependent metal insulator transition in Ga doped ZnO\n(Ga:ZnO) thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition technique. From the\nelectrical transport measurements, we find that while the thinnest film\nexhibits a resistivity of 0.05 $\\Omega$-cm, lying in the insulating regime, the\nthickest has resistivity of $6.6\\times10^{-4}\\Omega$-cm which shows metallic\ntype of conduction. Our analysis reveals that the Mott's variable range hopping\n(VRH) model governs the insulating behavior in the thinner Ga:ZnO whereas the\n2D weak localization phenomena is appropriate to explain the electron transport\nin the thicker Ga:ZnO. Magnetoresistance study further confirms the presence of\nstrong localization in 6 nm film while weak localization is observed in 20 nm\nand above thicker films. From the density functional calculations, it is found\nthat due to surface reconstruction and Ga doping, strong crystalline disorder\nsets in very thin films to introduce localized states and thereby, restricts\nthe donor electron mobility.\n", "  A conformally invariant generalization of the Willmore energy for compact\nimmersed submanifolds of even dimension in a Riemannian manifold is derived and\nstudied. The energy arises as the coefficient of the log term in the\nrenormalized area expansion of a minimal submanifold in a Poincare-Einstein\nspace with prescribed boundary at infinity. Its first variation is identified\nas the obstruction to smoothness of the minimal submanifold. The energy is\nexplicitly identified for the case of submanifolds of dimension four.\nVariational properties of this four-dimensional energy are studied in detail\nwhen the background is a Euclidean space or a sphere, including identifications\nof critical embeddings, questions of boundedness above and below for various\ntopologies, and second variation.\n", "  In this paper we review the semiclassical extended Thomas-Fermi theory for\ndescribing the ground-state properties of nuclei. The binding energies\ncalculated in this approach do not contain shell effects and, in this sense,\nthey are analogous to those obtained from the mass formula. We discuss some\ntechniques for incorporating the shell effects which are missing in the\nsemiclassical calculation, such as the so-called expectation value method and\nthe Kohn-Sham scheme. We present numerical applications for effective\nzero-range Skyrme forces and finite-range Gogny forces.\n", "  In this paper, we present an infinitesimal version of the Stone-von Neumann\nTheorem. This work was motivated by the need to formulate the uniqueness\nproperty of the Heisenberg Commutation Relation purely in terms of unbounded\noperators.\n", "  Deformed and spherical even-even nuclei are studied using a finite range\nsimple effective interaction within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean field\napproach. Different parameter sets of the interaction, corresponding to\ndifferent incompressibility, are constructed by varying the exponent gamma of\nthe density in the traditional density-dependent term. Ten of the twelve\nparameters of these interactions are determined from properties of asymmetric\nnuclear matter and spin polarized pure neutron matter. The two remaining\nparameters are fitted to reproduce the experimental binding energies known in\n620 even-even nuclei using several variants of the rotational energy\ncorrection. The rms deviations for the binding energy depend on the value of\ngamma and the way the rotational energy correction is treated but they can be\nas low as 1.56 MeV, a value competitive with other renowned effective\ninteractions of Skyrme and Gogny type. Charge radii are compared to the\nexperimental values of 313 even-even nuclei and the rms deviation is again\ncomparable and even superior to the one of popular Skyrme and Gogny forces.\nEmphasis is given to the deformation properties predicted with these\ninteractions by analyzing the Potential Energy Surfaces for several well\ndeformed nuclei and the fission barriers of some nuclei. Comparison of the\nresults with the experimental information, where available, as well as with the\nresults of the Gogny D1S force shows satisfactory agreement.\n", "  Studies of rare decays of charmed mesons into the final states containing\nleptons is an important vehicle in low-energy searches for new physics. I\nreview theoretical implications of those studies involving transitions with and\nwithout lepton flavor conservation. I argue that lepton-flavor violation (LFV)\ncould be successfully studied in heavy quarkonium transitions yielding more\nsensitive results than similar searches involving $D$ mesons.\n"]}
