binaries such as LS 5039 a large number of electron-positron\npairs are created by the annihilation of primary very high energy (VHE)\ngamma-rays with photons from the massive star. The radiation from these\nparticles contributes to the total high energy gamma-ray flux and can initiate\na cascade, decreasing the effective gamma-ray opacity in the system. The aim of\nthis paper is to model the cascade emission and investigate if it can account\nfor the VHE gamma-ray flux detected by HESS from LS 5039 at superior\nconjunction, where the primary gamma-rays are expected to be fully absorbed. A\none-dimensional cascade develops along the line-of-sight if the deflections of\npairs induced by the surrounding magnetic field can be neglected. A\nsemi-analytical approach can then be adopted, including the effects of the\nanisotropic seed radiation field from the companion star. Cascade equations are\nnumerically solved, yielding the density of pairs and photons. In LS 5039, the\ncascade contribution to the total flux is large and anti-correlated with the\norbital modulation of the primary VHE gamma-rays. The cascade emission\ndominates close to superior conjunction but is too strong to be compatible with\nHESS measurements. Positron annihilation does not produce detectable 511 keV\nemission. This study provides an upper limit to cascade emission in gamma-ray\nbinaries at orbital phases where absorption is strong. The pairs are likely to\nbe deflected or isotropized by the ambient magnetic field, which will reduce\nthe resulting emission seen by the observer. Cascade emission remains a viable\nexplanation for the detected gamma-rays at superior conjunction in LS 5039.\n", "  It is shown in this work that time course change in noninertial reference\nframes, which were discovered by Einstein, leads to alteration of the formulas\nfor the relativistic mass and the relativistic energy.\n", "  Actin cables are linear cytoskeletal structures that serve as tracks for\nmyosin-based intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles in both yeast\nand mammalian cells. In a yeast cell undergoing budding, cables are in constant\ndynamic turnover yet some cables grow from the bud neck toward the back of the\nmother cell until their length roughly equals the diameter of the mother cell.\nThis raises the question: how is the length of these cables controlled? Here we\ndescribe a novel molecular mechanism for cable length control inspired by\nrecent experimental observations in cells. This antenna mechanism involves\nthree key proteins: formins, which polymerize actin, Smy1 proteins, which bind\nformins and inhibit actin polymerization, and myosin motors, which deliver Smy1\nto formins, leading to a length-dependent actin polymerization rate. We compute\nthe probability distribution of cable lengths as a function of several\nexperimentally tuneable parameters such as the formin-binding affinity of Smy1\nand the concentration of myosin motors delivering Smy1. These results provide\ntestable predictions of the antenna mechanism of actin-cable length control.\n", "  Quorum sensing is the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in\ncell density. To measure their cell density, bacterial populations produce and\ndetect diffusible molecules called autoinducers. Individual bacteria internally\nrepresent the external concentration of autoinducers via the level of monitor\nproteins. In turn, these monitor proteins typically regulate both their own\nproduction and the production of autoinducers, thereby establishing internal\nand external feedbacks. Here, we ask whether feedbacks can increase the\ninformation available to cells about their local density. We quantify available\ninformation as the mutual information between the abundance of a monitor\nprotein and the local cell density for biologically relevant models of quorum\nsensing. Using variational methods, we demonstrate that feedbacks can increase\ninformation transmission, allowing bacteria to resolve up to two additional\nranges of cell density when compared with bistable quorum-sensing systems. Our\nanalysis is relevant to multi-agent systems that track an external driver\nimplicitly via an endogenously generated signal.\n", "  Irreversibility is one of the most intriguing concepts in physics. While\nmicroscopic physical laws are perfectly reversible, macroscopic average\nbehavior has a preferred direction of time. According to the second law of\nthermodynamics, this arrow of time is associated with a positive mean entropy\nproduction. Using a nuclear magnetic resonance setup, we measure the\nnonequilibrium entropy produced in an isolated spin-1/2 system following fast\nquenches of an external magnetic field and experimentally demonstrate that it\nis equal to the entropic distance, expressed by the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence, between a microscopic process and its time-reverse. Our result\naddresses the concept of irreversibility from a microscopic quantum standpoint.\n", "  Living cells use readout molecules to record the state of receptor proteins,\nsimilar to measurements or copies in typical computational devices. But is this\nanalogy rigorous? Can cells be optimally efficient, and if not, why? We show\nthat, as in computation, a canonical biochemical readout network generates\ncorrelations; extracting no work from these correlations sets a lower bound on\ndissipation. For general input, the biochemical network cannot reach this\nbound, even with arbitrarily slow reactions or weak thermodynamic driving. It\nfaces an accuracy-dissipation trade-off that is qualitatively distinct from and\nworse than implied by the bound, and more complex steady-state copy processes\ncannot perform better. Nonetheless, the cost remains close to the thermodynamic\nbound unless accuracy is extremely high. Additionally, we show that\nbiomolecular reactions could be used in thermodynamically optimal devices under\nexogenous manipulation of chemical fuels, suggesting an experimental system for\ntesting computational thermodynamics.\n", "  Phys and Math are two colleagues at the University of Sa{\\c c}enbon (Crefan\nKingdom), dialoguing about the remarkable efficiency of mathematics for\nphysics. They talk about the notches on the Ishango bone, the various uses of\npsi in maths and physics, they arrive at dessins d'enfants, moonshine concepts,\nRademacher sums and their significance in the quantum world. You should not\nmiss their eccentric proposal of relating Bell's theorem to the Baby Monster\ngroup. Their hyperbolic polygons show a considerable singularity/cusp structure\nthat our modern age of computers is able to capture. Henri Poincar{\\'e} would\nhave been happy to see it.\n", "  Quantum simulation is of great importance in quantum information science.\nHere, we report an experimental quantum channel simulator imbued with an\nalgorithm for imitating the behavior of a general class of quantum systems. The\nreported quantum channel simulator consists of four single-qubit gates and one\ncontrolled-NOT gate. All types of quantum channels can be decomposed by the\nalgorithm and implemented on this device. We deploy our system to simulate\nvarious quantum channels, such as quantum-noise channels and weak quantum\nmeasurement. Our results advance experimental quantum channel simulation, which\nis integral to the goal of quantum information processing.\n", "  We consider classical estimators for a class of physically realizable linear\nquantum systems. Optimal estimation using a complex Kalman filter for this\nproblem has been previously explored. Here, we study robust $H_\\infty$\nestimation for uncertain linear quantum systems. The estimation problem is\nsolved by converting it to a suitably scaled $H_\\infty$ control problem. The\nsolution is obtained in the form of two algebraic Riccati equations. Relevant\nexamples involving dynamic squeezers are presented to illustrate the efficacy\nof our method.\n", "  We consider a fermionic dark matter candidate interacting via a scalar\nmediator coupled with the Standard Model through a Higgs portal. We consider\ngeneral setting including both scalar and pseudoscalar interactions between the\nscalar and fermion, and illustrate the relevant features for dark matter\nabundance, direct search limits and collider constraints. The case where dark\nmatter has a self-interaction strength $\\left\\langle \\sigma_V\n\\right\\rangle/m_\\psi \\sim 0.1-1 \\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$ is strongly\nconstrained, in particular by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We show that these\nconstraints can be alleviated by introducing a new light sterile neutrino $N$.\nThe allowed region for the extended model consists of a triangle at $10 (\\sin\n\\theta)^{-2/5} \\,{\\rm MeV} \\lesssim m_N \\lesssim 1\\,{\\rm GeV}$.\n", "  Large-scale interacting human activities underlie all social and economic\nphenomena, but quantitative understanding of regular patterns and mechanism is\nvery challenging and still rare. Self-organized online collaborative activities\nwith precise record of event timing provide unprecedented opportunity. Our\nempirical analysis of the history of millions of updates in Wikipedia shows a\nuniversal double power-law distribution of time intervals between consecutive\nupdates of an article. We then propose a generic model to unfold collaborative\nhuman activities into three modules: (i) individual behavior characterized by\nPoissonian initiation of an action, (ii) human interaction captured by a\ncascading response to others with a power-law waiting time, and (iii)\npopulation growth due to increasing number of interacting individuals. This\nunfolding allows us to obtain analytical formula that is fully supported by the\nuniversal patterns in empirical data. Our modeling approaches reveal\n\"simplicity\" beyond complex interacting human activities.\n", "  We propose a set of three simple photonic platforms capable of emulating\nquantum topologically insulating phases corresponding to Hall, spin-Hall, and\nvalley-Hall effects. It is shown that an interface between any two of these\nheterogeneous photonic topological insulators supports scattering-free surface\nstates. Spin and valley degrees of freedom characterizing such topologically\nprotected surface waves determine their unique pathways through complex\nphotonic circuits comprised of multiple heterogeneous interfaces.\n", "  A power-law density model, i.e., $\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-\\gamma'}$ has been\ncommonly employed in strong gravitational lensing studies, including the\nso-called time-delay technique used to infer the Hubble constant $H_0$.\nHowever, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed\ncorresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark\nmatter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in\ndensity. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet\ndegeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing\nwhich affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore\ncause a bias in the determination of $H_0$ from the time-delay technique. In\nthis paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the\namplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational\nproperties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that\nhave velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{SIE}$>160 km/s at redshifts below $z=1$, we\nfind that the bias on $H_0$ introduced by the power-law assumption can reach\n20%-50%, with a scatter of $10\\%-30\\%$ (rms). However, we find that by\nselecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal,\nit is possible to reduce the bias on $H_0$ to <5%, and the scatter to <10%.\nThis could potentially be used to form less biased statistical samples for\n$H_0$ measurements in the upcoming large survey era.\n", "  The dynamics of many glassy systems are known to exhibit string-like hopping\nmotions each consisting of a line of particles displacing one and other. By\nusing molecular dynamics simulations of glassy polymers, we show that these\nmotions become highly repetitive back-and-forth motions as temperature\ndecreases and do not necessarily contribute to net displacements. Particle hops\nwhich constitute string-like motions are reversed with a high probability,\nreaching 73% and beyond at low temperature. Structural relaxation rate is then\ndictated not by a simple particle hopping rate but instead by the rate at which\nparticles break away from hopping repetitions. We propose that disruption of\nstring repetitions and hence also structural relaxations are brought about by\npair-interactions between strings.\n", "  Axions and axion like particles are very attractive dark matter candidates.\nIn this review, we briefly investigate how the cosmological observations reveal\nthe existence of dark matter and some unique properties of axions/axion like\nparticles which make them more interesting.\n", "  Generation of antimatter via the multiphoton Breit-Wheeler process in an\nall-optical scheme will be made possible on forthcoming high-power laser\nfacilities through the collision of wakefield-accelerated GeV electrons with a\ncounter-propagating laser pulse with $10^{22}$-$10^{23}$ $\\mathrm{Wcm}^{-2}$\npeak intensity. By means of integrated 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we show\nthat the production of positron beams with 0.1-1 nC total charge, 100-400 MeV\nmean energy and 0.01-0.1 rad divergence is within the reach of\nsoon-to-be-available laser systems. The variations of the positron beam's\nproperties with respect to the laser parameters are also examined.\n", "  Reliable quantum information processing requires high-fidelity universal\nmanipulation of quantum systems within the characteristic coherence times.\nNon-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation offers a promising approach to\nimplement fast, universal, and robust quantum logic gates particularly useful\nin nano-fabricated solid-state architectures, which typically have short\ncoherence times. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to realize\nhigh-speed universal geometric quantum gates in nano-engineered pseudo-spin\ncharge qubits. We use a system of three coupled quantum dots containing a\nsingle electron, where two computational states of a double quantum dot charge\nqubit interact through an intermediate quantum dot. The additional degree of\nfreedom introduced into the qubit makes it possible to create a geometric model\nsystem, which allows robust and efficient single-qubit rotations through\ncareful control of the inter-dot tunneling parameters. We demonstrate that a\ncapacitive coupling between two charge qubits permits a family of non-adiabatic\nholonomic controlled two-qubit entangling gates, and thus provides a promising\nprocedure to maintain entanglement in charge qubits and a pathway toward\nfault-tolerant universal quantum computation. We estimate the feasibility of\nthe proposed structure by analyzing the gate fidelities to some extent.\n", "  Using different configurations of applied strong driving and weak probe\nfields, we find that only a single three-level superconducting quantum circuit\n(SQC) is enough to realize amplification, attenuation and frequency conversion\nof microwave fields. Such a three-level SQC has to possess $\\Delta$-type cyclic\ntransitions. Different from the parametric amplification (attenuation) and\nfrequency conversion in nonlinear optical media, the real energy levels of the\nthree-level SQC are involved in the energy exchange when these processes are\ncompleted. We quantitatively discuss the effects of amplification (attenuation)\nand the frequency conversion for different types of driving fields. The optimal\npoints are obtained for achieving the maximum amplification (attenuation) and\nconversion efficiency. Our study provides a new method to amplify (attenuate)\nmicrowave, realize frequency conversion, and also lay a foundation for\ngenerating single or entangled microwave photon states using a single\nthree-level SQC.\n", "  We present a new calculation of neutrino emissivities and energy spectra from\na massive star going through the advanced stages of nuclear burning\n(presupernova) in the months before becoming a supernova. The contributions\nfrom beta decay and electron capture, pair annihilation, plasmon decay, and the\nphotoneutrino process are modeled in detail, using updated tabulated nuclear\nrates. We also use realistic conditions of temperature, density, electron\nfraction and nuclear isotopic composition of the star from the state of the art\nstellar evolution code MESA. Results are presented for a set of progenitor\nstars with mass between 15 $M_\\odot$ and 30 $M_\\odot$. It is found that beta\nprocesses contribute substantially to the neutrino emissivity above realistic\ndetection thresholds of few MeV, at selected positions and times in the\nevolution of the star.\n", "  The linear equations of motion of a uniformly rotating, elastic and\nself-gravitating earth model are analyzed under minimal regularity assumptions.\nWe present existence and uniqueness results for the system, energy estimates,\nconvergence of Galerkin approximations, and propose a method based on a\nVolterra equation to deal with the nonlocal self-gravitation.\n", "  Citation networks have been widely used to study the evolution of science\nthrough the lenses of the underlying patterns of knowledge flows among academic\npapers, authors, research sub-fields, and scientific journals. Here we focus on\ncitation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the\nprinciple that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between\npapers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur\nbetween papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research\nproblems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of\nthe American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method\nfor measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical\nvalidation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that\nthe probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an\nincreasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also\nenables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related\narticles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By\nquantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative\nassessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their\nability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings\nindicate that knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by\njournals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by\nlower-impact ones. Our study has important implications for authors, editors\nand reviewers of scientific journals, as well as public preprint repositories,\nas it provides a procedure for recommending relevant yet missing references and\nproperly integrating bibliographies of papers.\n", "  A model universe is analyzed with $N$ protons and electrons where there are\nelectromagnetic and spin interactions in the Hamiltonian is investigated in the\ncontext of quantum shape kinematics. We have found that quantum shape space\nexists for $N\\geq 4$ particles and has $2N-7$ functional degrees of freedom in\nthe case of spin-1/2 particles. The emergence of space is associated with\nnon-vanishing expectation value $\\langle L^2 \\rangle$. We have shown that for\nodd $N$ space always emerges, and for large even $N$ space almost always\nemerges because $\\langle L^2 \\rangle \\neq 0$ for almost all states. In the\nlimit $N\\to\\infty$ the density of states that yields $\\langle L^2 \\rangle=0$\nvanishes. Therefore we conclude that the space is almost always emergent in\nquantum shape kinematics.\n", "  A macroscopic spintronic qubit based on spin superfluidity and spin Hall\nphenomena is proposed. This magnetic quantum information processing device\nrealizes the spin-supercurrent analog of the superconducting phase qubit and\nallows for full electrical control and readout. We also show that an array of\ninteracting magnetic phase qubits can realize a quantum annealer. These devices\ncan be built through standard solid-state fabrication technology, allowing for\nscalability. However, the upper bound for the operational temperature can, in\nprinciple, be higher than the superconducting counterpart, as it is ultimately\ngoverned by the magnetic ordering temperatures, which could be much higher than\nthe critical temperatures of the conventional superconducting devices.\n", "  Antiproton--proton annihilation into light mesons is revisited in the few GeV\nenergy domain, in view of a global description of the existing data. An\neffective meson model is developed, with mesonic and baryonic degrees od\nfreedom in $s$, $t$, and $u$ channels. Regge factors are added to reproduce the\nproper energy behavior and the forward and backward peaked behavior. A\ncomparison with existing data and predictions for angular distributions and\nenergy dependence are done for charged and neutral pion pair production.\n", "  We study the modular graph functions introduced by Green, Russo, Vanhove in\nthe context of type II superstring scattering amplitudes of 4 gravitons on a\ntorus. In particular we describe a method to algorithmically compute the\ncoefficients in their expansion at the cusp in terms of conical sums. We\nperform explicit computations for 3-graviton functions, which naturally suggest\nto conjecture that only single-valued multiple zeta values appear.\n", "  The bulk viscosity ($\\zeta$) of the hadronic medium has been estimated within\nthe ambit of the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model including the Hagedorn\ndensity of states. The HRG thermodynamics within a grand canonical ensemble\nprovides the mean hadron number as well as its fluctuation. The fluctuation in\nthe chemical composition of the hadronic medium in the grand canonical ensemble\ncan result in non-zero divergence of the hadronic fluid flow velocity, allowing\nus to estimate the $\\zeta$ of the hadronic matter upto a relaxation time. We\nstudy the influence of the hadronic spectrum on $\\zeta$ and find its\ncorrelation with the conformal symmetry breaking (CSB) measure, $\\epsilon-3P$.\nWe estimate $\\zeta$ along the contours with constant, $S/N_B$ (total\nentropy/net baryon number) in the $T-\\mu$ plane (temperature-baryonic chemical\npotential) for $S/N_B=30, 45$ and 300. We also assess the value of $\\zeta$ on\nthe chemical freezeout curve for various centre of mass energy\n($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$) and find that the bulk viscosity to entropy density ratio,\n$\\zeta/s$ is larger at FAIR than LHC energies.\n", "  The Heisenberg's error-disturbance relation is a cornerstone of quantum\nphysics. It was recently shown to be not universally valid and two different\napproaches to reformulate it were proposed.The first one focuses on how error\nand disturbance of two observables, A and B, depend on a particular quantum\nstate. The second one asks how a joint measurement of A and B affects their\neigenstates. Previous experiments focused on the first approach. Here, we focus\non the second one. Firstly, we propose and implement an extendible method for\nquantum walk-based joint measurements of noisy Pauli operators to test the\nerror-disturbance relation for qubits. Then, we formulate and experimentally\ntest a new universally valid relation for the three mutually unbiased\nobservables. We therefore establish a fundamentally new method of testing\nerror-disturbance relations.\n", "  The first phase of the Advanced Mo-based Rare Process Experiment (AMoRE-I),\nan experimental search for neutrinoless double beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$) of\n$^{100}$Mo in calcium molybdate (CMO) crystal using cryogenic techniques, is in\npreparation at the YangYang underground laboratory (Y2L) in South Korea. A\nGEANT4 based Monte Carlo simulation was performed for background estimation in\nthe first-phase the AMoRE-I detector and shield configuration. Background\nsources such as $^{238}$U, $^{232}$Th, $^{40}$K, $^{235}$U, and $^{210}$Pb were\nsimulated from inside the crystals, surrounding materials, outer shielding\nwalls of the Y2L cavity. The estimated background rate in the region of\ninterest was found to be $< 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ counts/keV/kg/yr (ckky). The\neffects of random coincidences between background and two-neutrino double beta\ndecay of $^{100}$Mo were estimated as a potential background source and its\nestimated rate was $< 2.3 \\times 10^{-4}$ ckky.\n", "  Individual addressing of qubits is essential for scalable quantum\ncomputation. Spatial addressing allows unlimited numbers of qubits to share the\nsame frequency, whilst enabling arbitrary parallel operations. We demonstrate\naddressing of long-lived $^{43}\\text{Ca}^+$ \"atomic clock\" qubits held in\nseparate zones ($960\\mu$m apart) of a microfabricated surface trap with\nintegrated microwave electrodes. Such zones could form part of a \"quantum CCD\"\narchitecture for a large-scale quantum information processor. By coherently\ncancelling the microwave field in one zone we measure a ratio of Rabi\nfrequencies between addressed and non-addressed qubits of up to 1400, from\nwhich we calculate a spin-flip probability on the qubit transition of the\nnon-addressed ion of $1.3\\times 10^{-6}$. Off-resonant excitation then becomes\nthe dominant error process, at around $5 \\times 10^{-3}$. It can be prevented\neither by working at higher magnetic field, or by polarization control of the\nmicrowave field. We implement polarization control with error $2 \\times\n10^{-5}$, which would suffice to suppress off-resonant excitation to the $\\sim\n10^{-9}$ level if combined with spatial addressing. Such polarization control\ncould also enable fast microwave operations.\n", "  Every finite simple group P can be generated by two of its elements. Pairs of\ngenerators for P are available in the Atlas of finite group representations as\n(not neccessarily minimal) permutation representations P. It is unusual but\nsignificant to recognize that a P is a Grothendieck's dessin d'enfant D and\nthat most standard graphs and finite geometries G-such as near polygons and\ntheir generalizations-are stabilized by a D. In our paper, tripods P -- D -- G\nof rank larger than two, corresponding to simple groups, are organized into\nclasses, e.g. symplectic, unitary, sporadic, etc (as in the Atlas). An\nexhaustive search and characterization of non-trivial point-line configurations\ndefined from small index representations of simple groups is performed, with\nthe goal to recognize their quantum physical significance. All the defined\ngeometries G' s have a contextuality parameter close to its maximal value 1.\n", "  Matter near a gravitational lens galaxy or projected along the line of sight\n(LOS) can affect strong lensing observables by more than contemporary\nmeasurement errors. We simulate lens fields with realistic three-dimensional\nmass configurations (self-consistently including voids), and then fit mock\nlensing observables with increasingly complex lens models to quantify biases\nand uncertainties associated with different ways of treating the lens\nenvironment (ENV) and LOS. We identify the combination of mass, projected\noffset, and redshift that determines the importance of a perturbing galaxy for\nlensing. Foreground structures have a stronger effect on the lens potential\nthan background structures, due to nonlinear effects in the foreground and\ndownweighting in the background. There is dramatic variation in the net\nstrength of ENV/LOS effects across different lens fields; modeling fields\nindividually yields stronger priors for $H_0$ than ray tracing through $N$-body\nsimulations. Models that ignore mass outside the lens yield poor fits and\nbiased results. Adding external shear can account for tidal stretching from\ngalaxies at redshifts $z \\ge z_{\\rm lens}$, but it requires corrections for\nexternal convergence and cannot reproduce nonlinear effects from foreground\ngalaxies. Using the tidal approximation is reasonable for most perturbers as\nlong as nonlinear redshift effects are included. Even then, the scatter in\n$H_0$ is limited by the lens profile degeneracy. Asymmetric image\nconfigurations produced by highly elliptical lens galaxies are less sensitive\nto the lens profile degeneracy, so they offer appealing targets for precision\nlensing analyses in future surveys like LSST and Euclid.\n", "  We consider a qubit governed by a sequence of weak measurements, with the\nmeasurement strength modified in a time- and state-dependent manner. The\nresulting trajectory of the qubit in the phase space can be weakly controlled\nwithout any direct action on the qubit (control-free control), even only one\nfixed observable is measured. Here we show a possibility of a weak form of a\nstochastic ratchet, allowing to create an additional \"force\" without changing\nthe corresponding effective average potential. Furthermore, if the weak\nmeasurement strength is significantly reduced in a way conditioned to some\nparticular state, a dynamical localization near this state takes place. If the\nmeasurement strength is reduced to zero, a singularity appears, which behaves\nlike an artificial basis state.\n", "  We demonstrate that silicon carbide (SiC) with natural isotope abundance can\npreserve a coherent spin superposition in silicon vacancies over unexpectedly\nlong time approaching 0.1 seconds. The spin-locked subspace with drastically\nreduced decoherence rate is attained through the suppression of heteronuclear\nspin cross-talking by applying a moderate magnetic field in combination with\ndynamic decoupling from the nuclear spin baths. We identify several\nphonon-assisted mechanisms of spin-lattice relaxation, ultimately limiting\nquantum coherence, and find that it can be extremely long at cryogenic\ntemperature, equal or even longer than 8 seconds. Our approach may be extended\nto other polyatomic compounds and open a path towards improved qubit memory for\nwafer-scale quantum techmologies.\n", "  The presence of an exchange field in topological insulators reveals novel\nspin related phenomena derived from the combination of topology and magnetism.\nIn the present work we show the controlled occurrence of either metallic or\ngapped topological Dirac states at the interface between ultrathin Cr films and\nthe Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface. The opening and closing of the gap at the Dirac point\nis caused by the spin reorientation transitions arising in the Cr films. We\nfind that atom thin layers of Cr adhered to Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surfaces present a\nmagnetic ground state with ferromagnetic planes coupled antiferromagnetically.\nAs the thickness of the Cr film increases stepwise from one to three atomic\nlayers, the direction of the magnetization changes twice from out-of-plane to\nin-plane and to out-of-plane again. The out of plane magnetization drives the\ngap opening and the topological surface states acquire a circular meron spin\nstructure. Therefore, the Cr spin reorientation leads to the metal/insulator\ntransition in the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ surface and to the correlated modification of\nthe surface state spin texture. Consequently, the thickness of the Cr film\nprovides an effective and controllable mechanism to modify the metallic or\ngapped nature, as well as the spin texture of the topological Dirac states.\n", "  The superconducting ground state of the newly discovered superconductor\nCs$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ with a quasi-one-dimensional crystal structure ($T_{\\bf\nc}\\sim$ 2.1(1) K) has been investigated using magnetization and muon-spin\nrelaxation or rotation ($\\mu$SR), both zero-field (ZF) and transverse-field\n(TF), measurements. Our ZF $\\mu$SR measurements reveal the presence of spin\nfluctuations below 4 K and the ZF relaxation rate ($\\lambda$) shows enhancement\nbelow $T_{\\bf c}\\sim$ 2.1 K, which might indicate that the superconducting\nstate is unconventional. This observation suggests that the electrons are\npaired via unconventional channels such as spin fluctuations, as proposed on\nthe basis of theoretical models. Our analysis of the TF $\\mu$SR results shows\nthat the temperature dependence of the superfluid density is fitted better with\na nodal gap structure than an isotropic s-wave model for the superconducting\ngap. The observation of a nodal gap in Cs$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ is consistent with\nthat observed in the isostructural K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ compound through TF\n$\\mu$SR measurements. Furthermore, from our TF $\\mu$SR study we have estimated\nthe magnetic penetration depth $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{L}}$$(0)$ = 954 nm,\nsuperconducting carrier density $n_s = 4.98 \\times 10^{26}~ $m$^{-3}$, and\ncarrier's effective-mass enhancement $m^*$ = 1.61m$_{e}$.\n", "  We discuss the existence of Killing tensors for certain (physically\nmotivated) stationary and axially symmetric vacuum space-times. We show\nnonexistence of a nontrivial Killing tensor for a Tomimatsu-Sato metric (up to\nvalence 7), for a C-metric (up to valence 9) and for a Zipoy-Voorhees metric\n(up to valence 11). The results are obtained by mathematically completely\nrigorous, nontrivial computer algebra computations with a huge number of\nequations involved in the problem.\n", "  We establish exact, dimension-dependent, spatio-temporal, uniform and local\nmoduli of continuity for (1) the fourth order L-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (L-KS)\nSPDEs and for (2) the time-fractional stochastic partial integro-differential\nequations (SPIDEs), driven by space-time white noise in one-to-three\ndimensional space. Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform. He proved existence, uniqueness, and sharp spatio-temporal H\\\"older\nregularity for the above two classes of equations in $d=1,2,3$. We show that\nboth classes are $(1/2)^-$ H\\\"older continuously differentiable in space when\n$d=1$, and we give the exact uniform and local moduli of continuity for the\ngradient in both cases. This is unprecedented for SPDEs driven by space-time\nwhite noise. Our results on exact moduli show that the half-derivative SPIDE is\na critical case. It signals the onset of rougher modulus regularity in space\nthan both time-fractional SPIDEs with time-derivatives of order $<1/2$ and L-KS\nSPDEs. This is despite the fact that they all have identical spatial H\\\"older\nregularity, as shown earlier by Allouba. Moreover, we show that the temporal\nlaws governing (1) and (2) are fundamentally different. We relate L-KS SPDEs to\nthe Houdr\\'e-Villa bifractional Brownian motion, yielding a Chung-type law of\nthe iterated logarithm for these SPDEs. We use the underlying explicit kernels\nand spectral/harmonic analysis to prove our results. On one hand, this work\nbuilds on the recent works on delicate sample path properties of Gaussian\nrandom fields. On the other hand, it builds on and complements Allouba's\nearlier works on (1) and (2). Similar regularity results hold for Allen-Cahn\nnonlinear versions of (1) and (2) on compacts via change of measure.\n", "  Current models of the spectrum of X-rays reflected from accretion disks\naround black holes and other compact objects are commonly calculated assuming\nthat the density of the disk atmosphere is constant within several Thomson\ndepths from the irradiated surface. An important simplifying assumption of\nthese models is that the ionization structure of the gas is completely\nspecified by a single, fixed value of the ionization parameter $\\xi$, which is\nthe ratio of the incident flux to the gas density. The density is typically\nfixed at $n_e=10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Motivated by observations, we consider higher\ndensities in the calculation of the reflected spectrum. We show by computing\nmodel spectra for $n_e \\gtrsim 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ that high-density effects\nsignificantly modify reflection spectra. The main effect is to boost the\nthermal continuum at energies $\\lesssim 2$ keV. We discuss the implications of\nthese results for interpreting observations of both AGN and black hole\nbinaries. We also discuss the limitations of our models imposed by the quality\nof the atomic data currently available.\n", "  Using quantum devices supported by classical computational resources is a\npromising approach to quantum-enabled computation. One example of such a hybrid\nquantum-classical approach is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) built\nto utilize quantum resources for the solution of eigenvalue problems and\noptimizations with minimal coherence time requirements by leveraging classical\ncomputational resources. These algorithms have been placed among the candidates\nfor first to achieve supremacy over classical computation. Here, we provide\nevidence for the conjecture that variational approaches can automatically\nsuppress even non-systematic decoherence errors by introducing an exactly\nsolvable channel model of variational state preparation. Moreover, we show how\nvariational quantum-classical approaches fit in a more general hierarchy of\nmeasurement and classical computation that allows one to obtain increasingly\naccurate solutions with additional classical resources. We demonstrate\nnumerically on a sample electronic system that this method both allows for the\naccurate determination of excited electronic states as well as reduces the\nimpact of decoherence, without using any additional quantum coherence time or\nformal error correction codes.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental results on glassy polymer nanoparticles, we\ndevelop a minimal theoretical framework for the glass transition in spherical\nconfinement. This is accomplished using our cooperative-string model for\nsupercooled dynamics, that was successful at recovering the bulk phenomenology\nand describing the thin-film anomalies. In particular, we obtain predictions\nfor the mobile-layer thickness as a function of temperature, and for the\neffective glass-transition temperature as a function of the radius of the\nspherical nanoparticle - including the existence of a critical particle radius\nbelow which vitrification never occurs. Finally, we compare the theoretical\nresults to experimental data on polystyrene from the recent literature, and we\ndiscuss the latter.\n", "  Vertical graphene nanosheets (VGN) grown as controlled porous network are\nstudied and demonstrated as a promising electrode material for supercapacitors.\nThe VGN synthesized by microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition\nusing CH4/Ar gas mixture as precursor are considered for electrochemical\nperformance in Na2SO4, KOH, and H2SO4 to delineate the electrolyte effect.\nAmong the electrolytes, H2SO4 exhibited excellent specific areal capacitance\n(188 microfarad/cm2) and good capacitance retention (96.8%). No significant\nchange is observed in impedance spectra even after 200 cycles. An electric\nequivalent circuit for the system is simulated from Nyquist plot to elucidate\nthe behavior of electrode/electrolyte interface. This potential supercapacitor\nelectrode material is well characterized by scanning electron microscopy,\ntransmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle\nmeasurement. Utilization of aqueous electrolytes for potential supercapacitors\nis also discussed in relation to improved performance observed in H2SO4 medium.\n", "  We report the observation of a Pt layer thickness dependence on the induced\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in ultra-thin\nPt($d_{\\text{Pt}}$)/CoFeB films. Taking advantage of the large spin-orbit\ncoupling of the heavy metal, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\nis quantified by Brillouin light scattering measurements of the frequency\nnon-reciprocity of spin-waves in the ferromagnet. The magnitude of the induced\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling is found to saturate to a value $0.45$\nmJ$/$m${}^2$ for Pt thicknesses larger than $\\sim 2$ nm. The experimental\nresults are explained by analytical calculations based on the 3-site indirect\nexchange mechanism that predicts a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the\ninterface between a ferromagnetic thin layer and a heavy metal. Our findings\nopen up a way to control and optimize chiral effects in ferromagnetic thin\nfilms through the thickness of the heavy metal layer.\n", "  This paper examines the mechanism of internal shocks in opaque relativistic\noutflows, in particular in cosmological gamma-ray bursts. The shocks produce\nneutrino emission and affect the observed photospheric radiation from the\nexplosion. They develop from internal compressive waves and can be of different\ntypes depending on the composition of the outflow: (1) Shocks in \"photon gas,\"\nwith negligible plasma inertia, have a unique structure determined by the\nforce-free condition---zero radiation flux in the plasma rest frame. Radiation\ndominance over plasma inertia suppresses formation of collisionless shocks\nmediated by collective electromagnetic fields. (2) If the outflow is\nsufficiently magnetized, a strong collisionless subshock develops, which is\nembedded in a thicker radiation-mediated structure. (3) Waves in outflows with\na free neutron component lead to dissipation through nuclear collisions. At\nlarge optical depths, shocks have a thickness comparable to the neutron free\npath, with an embedded radiation-mediated and collisionless subshocks. The\npaper also presents first-principle simulations of magnetized flows filled with\nphotons, demonstrating formation of shocks and their structure. Simple\nestimates show that magnetized sub-photospheric shocks are efficient producers\nof photons and have a great impact on the observed photospheric radiation. The\nshock structure changes as the outflow expands toward its photosphere. The\ndissipation is accompanied by strong $e^\\pm$ pair creation, and the\n$e^\\pm$-dressed shock carries the photosphere with it up to two decades in\nradius, emitting a strong pulse of nonthermal radiation.\n", "  In presence of impurities, ferromagnetic and ferroelectric domain walls slide\nonly above a finite external field. Close to this depinning threshold, they\nproceed by large and abrupt jumps, called avalanches, while, at much smaller\nfield, these interfaces creep by thermal activation. In this work we develop a\nnovel numerical technique that captures the ultra-slow creep regime over huge\ntime scales. We point out the existence of activated events that involve\ncollective reorganizations similar to avalanches, but, at variance with them,\ndisplay correlated spatio-temporal patterns that resemble the complex sequence\nof aftershocks observed after a large earthquake. Remarkably, we show that\nevents assembly in independent clusters that display at large scales the same\nstatistics as critical depinning avalanches. We foresee this correlated\ndynamics being experimentally accessible by magneto-optical imaging of\nferromagnetic films.\n", "  The self-consistent quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) approach\nis formulated in the canonical single-nucleon basis of the relativistic\nHatree-Fock-Bogoliubov (RHFB) theory. This approach is applied to study the\nisobaric analog states (IAS) and Gamov-Teller resonances (GTR) by taking Sn\nisotopes as examples. It is found that self-consistent treatment of the\nparticle-particle residual interaction is essential to concentrate the IAS in a\nsingle peak for open-shell nuclei and the Coulomb exchange term is very\nimportant to predict the IAS energies. For the GTR, the isovector pairing can\nincrease the calculated GTR energy, while the isoscalar pairing has an\nimportant influence on the low-lying tail of the GT transition. Furthermore,\nthe QRPA approach is employed to predict nuclear $\\beta$-decay half-lives. With\nan isospin-dependent pairing interaction in the isoscalar channel, the\nRHFB+QRPA approach almost completely reproduces the experimental $\\beta$-decay\nhalf-lives for nuclei up to the Sn isotopes with half-lives smaller than one\nsecond. Large discrepancies are found for the Ni, Zn, and Ge isotopes with\nneutron number smaller than $50$, as well as the Sn isotopes with neutron\nnumber smaller than $82$. The potential reasons for these discrepancies are\ndiscussed in detail.\n", "  A popular class of theories attributes the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the\nUniverse to CP-violating decays of super-heavy BSM particles in the Early\nUniverse. Recently, we discovered a new source of leptogenesis in these models,\nnamely that the same Yukawa phases which provide the CP violation for decays,\ncombined with curved-spacetime loop effects, lead to an entirely new\ngravitational mechanism for generating an asymmetry, driven by the expansion of\nthe Universe and independent of the departure of the heavy particles from\nequilibrium. In this Letter, we build on previous work by analysing the full\nBoltzmann equation, exploring the full parameter space of the theory and\nstudying the time-evolution of the asymmetry. Remarkably, we find regions of\nparameter space where decays play no part at all, and where the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe is determined solely by gravitational effects.\n", "  The multi-TeV $\\gamma$-rays from the Galactic Center (GC) have a cutoff at\ntens of TeV, whereas the diffuse emission has no such cutoff, which is regarded\nas an indication of PeV proton acceleration by the HESS experiment. It is\nimportant to understand the inconsistency and study the possibility that PeV\ncosmic-ray acceleration could account for the apparently contradictory point\nand diffuse $\\gamma$-ray spectra. In this work, we propose that the cosmic rays\nare accelerated up to $>$PeV in GC. The interaction between cosmic rays and\nmolecular clouds is responsible for the multi-TeV $\\gamma$-ray emissions from\nboth the point source and diffuse sources today. Enhanced by the small volume\nfilling factor (VFF) of the clumpy structure, the absorption of the\n$\\gamma$-rays leads to a sharp cutoff spectrum at tens of TeV produced in the\nGC. Away from galactic center, the VFF grows and the absorption enhancement\nbecomes negligible. As a result, the spectra of $\\gamma$-ray emissions for both\npoint source and diffuse sources can be successfully reproduced under such\nself-consistent picture. In addition, a \"surviving-tail\" at $\\sim$100 TeV is\nexpected from the point source, which can be observed by future projects CTA\nand LHAASO. Neutrinos are simultaneously produced during proton-proton (PP)\ncollision. With 5-10 years observations, the KM3Net experiment will be able to\ndetect the PeV source according to our calculation.\n", "  The fermion sign problem is often viewed as a sheer inconvenience that\nplagues numerical studies of strongly interacting electron systems. Only\nrecently, it has been suggested that fermion signs are fundamental for the\nuniversal behavior of critical metallic systems and crucially enhance their\ndegree of quantum entanglement. In this work we explore potential connections\nbetween emergent scale invariance of fermion sign structures and scaling\nproperties of bipartite entanglement entropies. Our analysis is based on a\nwavefunction ansatz that incorporates collective, long-range backflow\ncorrelations into fermionic Slater determinants. Such wavefunctions mimic the\ncollapse of a Fermi liquid at a quantum critical point. Their nodal surfaces --\na representation of the fermion sign structure in many-particle configurations\nspace -- show fractal behavior up to a length scale $\\xi$ that diverges at a\ncritical backflow strength. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the fractal\nnodal surface depends on $\\xi$, the number of fermions and the exponent of the\nbackflow. For the same wavefunctions we numerically calculate the second\nR\\'enyi entanglement entropy $S_2$. Our results show a cross-over from volume\nscaling, $S_2\\sim \\ell^\\theta$ ($\\theta=2$ in $d=2$ dimensions), to the\ncharacteristic Fermi-liquid behavior $S_2\\sim \\ell\\ln \\ell$ on scales larger\nthan $\\xi$. We find that volume scaling of the entanglement entropy is a robust\nfeature of critical backflow fermions, independent of the backflow exponent and\nhence the fractal dimension of the scale invariant sign structure.\n", "  Cross helicity is not conserved in non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\n(as opposed to barotropic or incompressible MHD). Here we show that variational\nanalysis suggests a new kind of cross helicity which is conserved in the non\nbarotropic case. The non barotropic cross helicity reduces to the standard\ncross helicity under barotropic assumptions. The new cross helicity is\nconserved even for topologies for which the variational principle does not\napply.\n", "  Many organisms navigate gradients by alternating straight motions (runs) with\nrandom reorientations (tumbles), transiently suppressing tumbles whenever\nattractant signal increases. This induces a functional coupling between\nmovement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the\ninternal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal\nlevels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state\nclose to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the\ngradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient.\nImportantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the\ninternal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on\nwhat happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we\nshow here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter\nspace where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are\nrelatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of\nnon-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point)\ninherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental\nnonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this\namplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and\nabbreviating others. The result is a \"ratchet-like\" gradient climbing behavior\nwith drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism.\nOur results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation\n--- wasteful runs in the wrong direction --- can be mitigated by exploiting the\nnon-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.\n", "  Maxwell's demon explores the role of information in physical processes.\nEmploying information about microscopic degrees of freedom, this \"intelligent\nobserver\" is capable of compensating entropy production (or extracting work),\napparently challenging the second law of thermodynamics. In a modern\nstandpoint, it is regarded as a feedback control mechanism and the limits of\nthermodynamics are recast incorporating information-to-energy conversion. We\nderive a trade-off relation between information-theoretic quantities empowering\nthe design of an efficient Maxwell's demon in a quantum system. The demon is\nexperimentally implemented as a spin-1/2 quantum memory that acquires\ninformation, and employs it to control the dynamics of another spin-1/2 system,\nthrough a natural interaction. Noise and imperfections in this protocol are\ninvestigated by the assessment of its effectiveness. This realization provides\nexperimental evidence that the irreversibility on a non-equilibrium dynamics\ncan be mitigated by assessing microscopic information and applying a\nfeed-forward strategy at the quantum scale.\n", "  We show that a temporal soliton can induce resonant radiation by three-wave\nmixing nonlinearities. This constitutes a new class of resonant radiation whose\nspectral positions are parametrically tunable. The experimental verification is\ndone in a periodically poled lithium niobate crystal, where a femtosecond\nnear-IR soliton is excited and resonant radiation waves are observed exactly at\nthe calculated soliton phase-matching wavelengths via the sum- and\ndifference-frequency generation nonlinearities. This extends the supercontinuum\nbandwidth well into the mid-IR to span 550-5000 nm and the mid-IR edge is\nparametrically tunable over 1000 nm by changing the three-wave mixing\nphase-matching condition. The results are important for bright and broadband\nsupercontinuum generation and for frequency comb generation in quadratic\nnonlinear microresonators.\n", "  The melting transition of two-dimensional (2D) systems is a fundamental\nproblem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced\nsignificantly through the application of computational resources and\nalgorithms. 2D systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase\ntransition scenarios not observed in 3D systems, but these phases depend\nsensitively on the system and thus predicting how any given 2D system will\nbehave remains a challenge. Here we report a comprehensive simulation study of\nthe phase behavior near the melting transition of all hard regular polygons\nwith $3\\leq n\\leq 14$ vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations\nof up to one million particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show\nthat the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry\nconsiderations, which together can predict which of three different melting\nscenarios will occur for a given $n$. We show that systems of polygons with as\nfew as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid\nto a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic\nphase to the fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all\n$7\\leq n\\leq 14$, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong\ndirectional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and\nimpose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the\ndiscontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order\nin the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result,\nsystems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a KTHNY-type continuous\ntransition between fluid and hexatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases,\nrespectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate \"x\"-atic to the\nsolid. [abstract truncated due to arxiv length limitations].\n", "  For charged black holes in Horava-Lifshitz gravity, a second order phase\ntransition takes place in extended phase space where the cosmological constant\nis taken as thermodynamic pressure. We relate the second order nature of phase\ntransition to the fact that the phase transition occurs at a sharp temperature\nand not over a temperature interval. Once we know the continuity of the first\nderivatives of the Gibbs free energy, we show that all the Ehrenfest equations\nare readily satisfied. We study the effect of the perturbation of the\ncosmological constant as well as the perturbation of the electric charge on\nthermodynamic stability of Horava-Lifshitz black hole. We also use\nthermodynamic geometry to study phase transition in extended phase space. We\ninvestigate the behavior of scalar curvature of Weinhold, Ruppeiner, and\nQuevedo metric in extended phase space of charged Horava-Lifshitz black holes.\nIt is checked if these curvatures could reproduce the result of specific heat\nfor the phase transition.\n", "  There are five well-known zero modes among the fluctuations of the metric of\nde~Sitter (dS) spacetime. For Euclidean signature, they can be associated with\ncertain spherical harmonics on the $S^4$ sphere, viz., the vector\nrepresentation $\\bf5$ of the global $SO(5)$ isometry. They appear, for example,\nin the perturbative calculation of the on-shell effective action of dS space,\nas well as in models containing matter fields. These modes are shown to be\nassociated with collective modes of $S^4$ corresponding to certain coherent\nfluctuations. When dS space is embedded in flat five dimensions $E^5,$ they may\nbe seen as a legacy of translation of the center of the $S^4$ sphere. Rigid\ntranslations of the $S^4$-sphere on $E^5$ leave the classical action invariant\nbut are unobservable displacements from the point of view of gravitational\ndynamics on $S^4.$ Thus, unlike similar moduli, the center of the sphere is not\npromoted to a dynamical degree of freedom. As a result, these zero modes do not\nsignify the possibility of physically realizable fluctuations or flat\ndirections for the metric of dS space. They are not associated with Killing\nvectors on $S^4$ but can be with certain non-isometric, conformal Killing forms\nthat locally correspond to a rescaling of the volume element $dV_4.$\n  For convenience, we frame our discussion in the context of renormalizable\ngravity, but the conclusions apply equally to the corresponding zero modes in\nEinstein gravity. We expect that these zero modes will be present to all orders\nin perturbation theory. They will occur for Lorentzian signature as well, so\nlong as the hyperboloid $H^4$ is locally stable, but there remain certain\ninfrared issues that need to be clarified. We conjecture that they will appear\nin any gravitational theory having dS background as a locally stable solution\nof the effective action, regardless of whether additional matter is included.\n", "  We present a new test of gravitational physics by comparing the growth rate\nof cosmic structure measured around voids with that measured around galaxies in\nthe same large-scale structure dataset, the low-redshift 6-degree Field Galaxy\nSurvey. By fitting a self-consistent Redshift Space Distortion model to the 2D\ngalaxy-galaxy and void-galaxy correlation functions, we recover growth rate\nvalues f\\sigma_8 = 0.42 \\pm 0.06 and 0.39 \\pm 0.11, respectively. The\nenvironmental-dependence of cosmological statistics can potentially\ndiscriminate between modified-gravity scenarios which modulate the growth rate\nas a function of scale or environment and test the underlying assumptions of\nhomogeneity and isotropy.\n", "  We study intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxy image shapes within the\nIllustris cosmic structure formation simulations. We investigate how IA\ncorrelations depend on observable galaxy properties such as stellar mass,\napparent magnitude, redshift, and photometric type, and on the employed shape\nmeasurement method. The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights. The expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the\nobserved ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be\nbelow one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the\ndetails of the shape measurement method. A comparison of our results to a tidal\nalignment model indicates that such a model is able to reproduce the IA\ncorrelations well on intermediate and large scales, provided the effect of\nvarying galaxy density is correctly taken into account. We also find that the\nGI contributions to the observed ellipticity correlations could be inferred\ndirectly from measurements of galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity\ncorrelations, except on small scales, where systematic differences between mI\nand dI correlations are large.\n", "  The band structures of single-layer MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ present a coupling\nbetween spin and valley degrees of freedom that suppresses spin-flip scattering\nand spin dephasing. Here we show that out-of-plane deformations, such as\ncorrugations or ripples, enhance spin-flip scattering in armchair MoS$_2$ and\nWS$_2$ nanoribbons. Spin transport in the presence of surface roughness is\nsystematically investigated, employing the non-equilibrium Green's function\nmethod along with the tight-binding approximation. Both transmission and\nconductance have been calculated as a function of surface roughness. Our\nresults indicate that the spin-flip rate, usually neglected in flat pristine\nsamples, increases significantly with the surface roughness amplitude. These\nresults are important for the design and fabrication of transition metal\ndichalcogenides based spintronic devices.\n", "  We suggest that nonminimally coupled scalar fields can lead to modifications\nof the microphysics in the interiors of relativistic stars. As a concrete\nexample, we consider the generation of a non-zero photon mass in such\nhigh-density environments. This is achieved by means of a light gravitational\nscalar, and the scalarization phase transition in scalar-tensor theories of\ngravitation. Two distinct models are presented, and phenomenological\nimplications are briefly discussed.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP), a layered van der Waals material, reportedly has a\nband gap sensitive to external perturbations and manifests a Dirac-semimetal\nphase when its band gap is closed. Previous studies were focused on effects of\neach perturbation, lacking a unified picture for the band-gap closing and the\nDirac-semimetal phase. Here, using pseudospins from the glide-reflection\nsymmetry, we study the electronic structures of mono- and bilayer BP and\nconstruct the phase diagram of the Dirac-semimetal phase in the parameter space\nrelated to pressure, strain, and electric field. We find that the\nDirac-semimetal phase in BP layers is singly connected in the phase diagram,\nindicating the phase is topologically identical regardless of the gap-closing\nmechanism. Our findings can be generalized to the Dirac semimetal phase in\nanisotropic layered materials and can play a guiding role in search for a new\nclass of topological materials and devices.\n", "  We present an exploratory study of the gluonic structure of the $\\phi$ meson\nusing lattice QCD (LQCD). This includes the first investigation of gluonic\ntransversity via the leading moment of the twist-two double-helicity-flip\ngluonic structure function $\\Delta(x,Q^2)$. This structure function only exists\nfor targets of spin $J\\ge1$ and does not mix with quark distributions at\nleading twist, thereby providing a particularly clean probe of gluonic degrees\nof freedom. We also explore the gluonic analogue of the Soffer bound which\nrelates the helicity flip and non-flip gluonic distributions, finding it to be\nsaturated at the level of 80%. This work sets the stage for more complex LQCD\nstudies of gluonic structure in the nucleon and in light nuclei where\n$\\Delta(x,Q^2)$ is an 'exotic glue' observable probing gluons in a nucleus not\nassociated with individual nucleons.\n", "  The solution of the large-N 't Hooft limit of QCD is universally believed to\nbe a String Theory of Closed Strings in the Glueball Sector and of Open Strings\nin the Meson Sector. Yet, we prove a no-go theorem, that the large-N limit of\nQCD with massless quarks, or more generally, that the large-N limit of a vast\nclass of confining, i.e. with a Mass Gap in the Glueball Sector,\nasymptotically-free Gauge Theories coupled to matter fields with no mass scale\nin perturbation theory cannot be a canonically-defined String Theory of Closed\nand Open Strings, i.e. admitting Open/Closed Duality. The no-go theorem occurs\nbecause Open/Closed Duality, implying that the ultraviolet divergences of\nannulus diagrams in the Open Sector arise from infrared divergences of tadpoles\nof massless particles in the Closed Sector, turns out to be incompatible with\nthe existence of the Mass Gap in the Glueball Sector of confining\nasymptotically-free theories with no mass scale in perturbation theory in\nwhich, as for example in QCD, the first coefficient of the beta function for 't\nHooft gauge coupling gets $1/N$ corrections due to the matter fields. Moreover,\nwe suggest a way-out to the no-go theorem on the basis of a new non-canonical\nconstruction of the String S-matrix for asymptotically-free Gauge Theories such\nas large-N QCD, involving Topological Strings on Non-Commutative Twistor Space.\n", "  An extended Higgs sector may allow for new scalar particles well below the\nweak scale. In this work, we present a detailed study of a light scalar $S$\nwith enhanced coupling to leptons, which could be responsible for the existing\ndiscrepancy between experimental and theoretical determinations of the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment. We present an ultraviolet completion of this model\nin terms of the lepton-specific two-Higgs doublet model and an additional\nscalar singlet. We then analyze a plethora of experimental constraints on the\nuniversal low energy model, and this UV completion, along with the sensitivity\nreach at future experiments. The most relevant constraints originate from muon\nand kaon decays, electron beam dump experiments, electroweak precision\nobservables, rare $B_d$ and $B_s$ decays and Higgs branching fractions. The\nproperties of the leptonic Higgs portal imply an enhanced couplings to heavy\nleptons, and we identify the most promising search mode for the high-luminosity\nelectron-positron colliders as $e^+{+}e^-\\to\\tau^+{+}\\tau^-{+}S \\to\n\\tau^+{+}\\tau^-{+}\\ell{+}\\bar \\ell$, where $\\ell =e,\\mu$. Future analyses of\nexisting data from BaBar and Belle, and from the upcoming Belle II experiment,\nwill enable tests of this model as a putative solution to the muon $g-2$\nproblem for $m_S < 3.5$ GeV.\n", "  We describe and test the pipeline used to measure the weak lensing shear\nsignal from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). It includes a novel method of\n`self-calibration' that partially corrects for the effect of noise bias. We\nalso discuss the `weight bias' that may arise in optimally-weighted\nmeasurements, and present a scheme to mitigate that bias. To study the residual\nbiases arising from both galaxy selection and shear measurement, and to derive\nan empirical correction to reduce the shear biases to $\\lesssim 1\\%$, we create\na suite of simulated images whose properties are close to those of the KiDS\nsurvey observations. We find that the use of `self-calibration' reduces the\nadditive and multiplicative shear biases significantly, although further\ncorrection via a calibration scheme is required, which also corrects for a\ndependence of the bias on galaxy properties. We find that the calibration\nrelation itself is biased by the use of noisy, measured galaxy properties,\nwhich may limit the final accuracy that can be achieved. We assess the accuracy\nof the calibration in the tomographic bins used for the KiDS cosmic shear\nanalysis, testing in particular the effect of possible variations in the\nuncertain distributions of galaxy size, magnitude and ellipticity, and conclude\nthat the calibration procedure is accurate at the level of multiplicative bias\n$\\lesssim 1\\%$ required for the KiDS cosmic shear analysis.\n", "  We derived and discussed new exact, monochromatic, finite-power, beam-like\nsolutions of Maxwells equations in vacuum. We derived energy density flux,\ntotal power of the solution, and compared its effective beam area with that of\nthe Gaussian beam solution.\n", "  The hadron-resonance gas (HRG) model with the mass-proportional eigenvolume\n(EV) corrections is employed to fit the hadron yield data of the NA49\ncollaboration for central Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}} = 6.3, 7.6,\n8.8, 12.3,$ and $17.3$ GeV, the hadron midrapidity yield data of the STAR\ncollaboration for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV, and the\nhadron midrapidity yield data of the ALICE collaboration for Pb+Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2760$ GeV. At given bombarding energy, for a given set\nof radii, the EV HRG model fits do not just yield a single $T-\\mu_B$ pair, but\na whole range of $T-\\mu_B$ pairs, each with similarly good fit quality. These\npairs form a valley in the $T-\\mu_B$ plane along a line of nearly constant\nentropy per baryon, $S/A$, which increases nearly linearly with bombarding\nenergy $E_{\\rm lab}$. The entropy per baryon values extracted from the data at\nthe different energies are a robust observable: it is almost independent of the\ndetails of the modeling of the eigenvolume interactions and of the specific\n$T-\\mu_B$ values obtained. These results show that the extraction of the\nchemical freeze-out temperature and chemical potential is extremely sensitive\nto the modeling of the short-range repulsion between the hadrons. This implies\nthat the ideal point-particle HRG values are not unique. The wide range of the\nextracted $T$ and $\\mu_B$ values suggested by the eigenvolume HRG fits, as well\nas the approximately constant $S/A$ at freeze-out, are consistent with a\nnon-equilibrium scenario of continuous freeze-out, where hadrons can be\nchemically frozen-out throughout the extended space-time regions during the\nevolution of the system. Even when the EV HRG fits are restricted to modest\ntemperatures suggested by lattice QCD, the strong systematic effects of EV\ninteractions are observed.\n", "  Galaxy comoving number density is commonly used to forge\nprogenitor/descendant links between observed galaxy populations at different\nepochs. However, this method breaks down in the presence of galaxy mergers, or\nwhen galaxies experience stochastic growth rates. We present a simple analytic\nframework to treat the physical processes that drive the evolution and\ndiffusion of galaxies within comoving number density space. The evolution in\nmass rank order of a galaxy population with time is influenced by the galaxy\ncoagulation rate and galaxy \"mass rank scatter\" rate. We quantify the relative\ncontribution of these two effects to the mass rank order evolution. We show\nthat galaxy coagulation is dominant at lower redshifts and stellar masses,\nwhile scattered growth rates dominate the mass rank evolution at higher\nredshifts and stellar masses. For a galaxy population at $10^{10} M_\\odot$,\ncoagulation has been the dominant effect since $z=2.2$, but a galaxy population\nat $10^{11} M_\\odot$ was dominated by mass rank scatter until $z=0.6$. We show\nthat although the forward and backward median number density evolution tracks\nare asymmetric, the backward median number density evolution can be obtained by\nconvolving the descendant distribution function with progenitor relative\nabundances. We tabulate fits for the median number density evolution and\nscatter which can be applied to improve the way galaxy populations are linked\nin multi-epoch observational datasets.\n", "  We give a construction of completely integrable 4-dimensional Hamiltonian\nsystems with cubic Hamilton functions. Applying to the corresponding pairs of\ncommuting quadratic Hamiltonian vector fields the so called Kahan-Hirota-Kimura\ndiscretization scheme, we arrive at pairs of birational 4-dimensional maps. We\nshow that these maps are symplectic with respect to a symplectic structure that\nis a perturbation of the standard symplectic structure on $\\mathbb R^4$, and\npossess two independent integrals of motion, which are perturbations of the\noriginal Hamilton functions. Thus, these maps are completely integrable in the\nLiouville-Arnold sense. Moreover, under a suitable normalization of the\noriginal pairs of vector fields, the pairs of maps commute and share the\ninvariant symplectic structure and the two integrals of motion.\n", "  Advanced potential solution of Maxwell equations isn't often accepted. We\nhave proven if without advanced potential, it is not possible to satisfy the\nMaxwell equations. We also shown that it is not the Poynting vector related\nenergy current transferring energy in the space and it is the mutual energy\nreally did that. A important result of the mutual energy theorem is that the\nadvanced potential can suck energy from the transmitter. This energy is equal\nto the energy received at the receiver. Hence a transmitter can not send any\nenergy out without the receiver. For two remote objects, the energy is\ntransferred only can by the mutual energy of a retarded potential from the\nsource together with an advanced potential from the sink. If the sucked energy\nis discrete, the summation of mutual energy current of the infinite background\natoms or currents, which can be seen as receivers, is a random process. This\nmeans that the photon energy sent by the transmitter is actually grabbed by the\nreceiver. Hence the photon from very beginning knows their destination. This\nreceiver send advanced potential to the transmitter. This explanation also\navoided the wave function collapse. The retarded potential first reached the\nreceiver, cause the current in the receiver, the current of receiver send a\nadvanced potential to the transmitter with a reversed time, in the same time, a\nphoton minus-time-instantly runs from receiver to transmitter. In our normal\nfeeling, the photon is still runs from the transmitter to the receiver with a\npositive time. How to transfer superluminal signal using advanced potential is\nalso discussed.Maxwell equations as principle of the theory of the\nelectromagnetic fields is replaced by the mutual energy principle.\n", "  The extended Bose-Hubbard model for a double-well potential with atom-pair\ntunneling is studied. Starting with a classical analysis we determine the\nexistence of three different quantum phases: self-trapping, phase-locking and\nJosephson states. From this analysis we built the parameter space of quantum\nphase transitions between degenerate and non-degenerate ground states driven by\nthe atom-pair tunneling. Considering only the repulsive case, we confirm the\nphase transition by the measure of the energy gap between the ground state and\nthe first excited state. We study the structure of the solutions of the Bethe\nansatz equations for a small number of particles. An inspection of the roots\nfor the ground state suggests a relationship to the physical properties of the\nsystem. By studying the energy gap we find that the profile of the roots of the\nBethe ansatz equations is related to a quantum phase transition.\n", "  Although still under debate, observations generally suggest that dwarf\nspheroidal (dSph) galaxies exhibit large constant-density cores in the centers,\nwhich can hardly be explained by dissipationless cold dark matter simulations\nwithout baryonic feedback. Wave dark matter (${\\psi {\\rm DM}}$), characterized\nby a single parameter, the dark matter particle mass $m_{\\psi}$, predicts a\ncentral soliton core in every galaxy arising from quantum pressure against\ngravity. Here we apply Jeans analysis assuming a soliton core profile to the\nkinematic data of eight classical dSphs so as to constrain $m_{\\psi}$, and\nobtain $m_{\\psi}=1.18_{-0.24}^{+0.28}\\times10^{-22}{\\,\\rm eV}$ and\n$m_{\\psi}=1.79_{-0.33}^{+0.35}\\times10^{-22}{\\,\\rm eV}~(2\\sigma)$ using the\nobservational data sets of Walker et al. (2007) and Walker et al. (2009b),\nrespectively. We show that the estimate of $m_{\\psi}$ is sensitive to the dSphs\nkinematic data sets and is robust to various models of stellar density profile.\nWe also consider multiple stellar subpopulations in dSphs and find consistent\nresults. This mass range of $m_{\\psi}$ is in good agreement with other\nindependent estimates, such as the high-redshift luminosity functions, the\nreionization history, and the Thomson optical depth to the cosmic microwave\nbackground.\n", "  To push commercial electronics beyond its current size limits, atomic-scale\ncommunication channels and logic units need to be designed, making the use of\nquantum entities an imperative. In this regime, quantum fluctuations naturally\nbecome prominent, and are generally considered to be detrimental. Here we show\nthat for spin-based information processing, these fluctuations can be uniquely\nexploited to gate the flow of classical binary information across a magnetic\nchain. Moreover, this information flow can be controlled with a modest external\nmagnetic field that drives the system through different many-body quantum\nphases in which the orientation of the final spin does or does not reflect the\norientation of the initial input. Our results are general for a wide class of\nanisotropic spin chains that act as magnetic cellular automata, and suggest\nthat quantum fluctuations may play a unique role in driving classical\ninformation flow at the atomic scale.\n", "  Aims: We present a custom support vector machine classification package for\nphotometric redshift estimation, including comparisons with other methods. We\nalso explore the efficacy of including galaxy shape information in redshift\nestimation. Support vector machines, a type of machine learning, utilize\noptimization theory and supervised learning algorithms to construct predictive\nmodels based on the information content of data in a way that can treat\ndifferent input features symmetrically.\n  Methods: The custom support vector machine package we have developed is\ndesignated SPIDERz and made available to the community. As test data for\nevaluating performance and comparison with other methods, we apply SPIDERz to\nfour distinct data sets: 1) the publicly available portion of the PHAT-1\ncatalog based on the GOODS-N field with spectroscopic redshifts in the range $z\n< 3.6$, 2) 14365 galaxies from the COSMOS bright survey with photometric band\nmagnitudes, morphology, and spectroscopic redshifts inside $z < 1.4$, 3) 3048\ngalaxies from the overlap of COSMOS photometry and morphology with 3D-HST\nspectroscopy extending to $z < 3.9$, and 4) 2612 galaxies with five-band\nphotometric magnitudes and morphology from the All-wavelength Extended Groth\nStrip International Survey and $z < 1.57$.\n  Results: We find that SPIDER-z achieves results competitive with other\nempirical packages on the PHAT-1 data, and performs quite well in estimating\nredshifts with the COSMOS and AEGIS data, including in the cases of a large\nredshift range ($0 < z < 3.9$). We also determine from analyses with both the\nCOSMOS and AEGIS data that the inclusion of morphological information does not\nhave a statistically significant benefit for photometric redshift estimation\nwith the techniques employed here.\n", "  We report the discovery of three moderately high-mass transiting hot Jupiters\nfrom the HATSouth survey: HATS-22b, HATS-23b and HATS-24b. These planets add to\nthe numbers of known planets in the ~2MJ regime. HATS-22b is a 2.74+/-0.11 MJ\nmass and 0.953+0.048/-0.029 RJ radius planet orbiting a V = 13.455 +/- 0.040\nsub-silar mass (M_star = 0.759+/-0.019 M_sun; R_star = 0.759+/-0.019 R_sun)\nK-dwarf host star on an eccentric (e = 0.079 +/- 0.026) orbit. This planet's\nhigh planet-to-stellar mass ratio is further evidence that migration mechanisms\nfor hot Jupiters may rely on exciting orbital eccentricities that bring planets\ncloser to their parent stars followed by tidal circularisation. HATS-23b is a\n1.478 +/- 0.080 MJ mass and 1.69 +/- 0.24 RJ radius planet on a grazing orbit\naround a V = 13.901 +/- 0.010 G-dwarf with properties very similar to those of\nthe Sun (M_star = 1.115 +/- 0.054 M_sun; R_star = 1.145 +/- 0.070 R_sun).\nHATS-24b orbits a moderately bright V = 12.830 +/- 0.010 F-dwarf star (M_star =\n1.218 +/- 0.036 M_sun; R_star = 1.194+0.066/-0.041 R_sun). This planet has a\nmass of 2.39 +0.21/-0.12 MJ and an inflated radius of 1.516 +0.085/-0.065 RJ.\n", "  The gravitational field of a laser pulse, although not detectable at the\nmoment, comes with a peculiar feature which continues to attract attention;\ncause and effect propagate with the same speed, that of light. A particular\nresult of this feature is that the gravitational field of an emitted laser\npulse and the gravitational effect of the emitter's energy-momentum change are\nintimately entangled. In this article, a specific example of an emission\nprocess is considered - an atom, modeled as a point mass, emits two\ncounter-propagating pulses. The corresponding curvature and the effect on\nmassive and massless test particles is discussed. A comparison is made with the\nmetric corresponding to a spherically symmetric massive object that\nisotropically emits radiation - the Vaidya metric.\n", "  The notion of a physical collapse of the wave function is embodied in\ndynamical collapse models. These involve a modification of the unitary\nevolution of the wave function such as to give a dynamical account of collapse.\nThe resulting dynamics is at first sight time asymmetric for the simple reason\nthat the wave function depends on those collapse events in the past but not\nthose in the future. Here we show that dynamical wave function collapse models\nadmit a general description that has no inbuilt direction of time. Given some\nsimple constraints, we show that there exist empirically equivalent pictures of\ncollapsing wave functions in both time directions, each satisfying the same\ndynamical rules. A preferred direction is singled out only by the asymmetric\ninitial and final time constraints on the state of the Universe.\n", "  Typical black hole binaries in outburst show spectral states and transitions,\ncharacterized by a clear connection between the inflow onto the black hole and\noutflow from its vicinity. The transient stellar mass black hole binary V404\nCyg apparently does not fit in this picture. Its outbursts are characterized by\nintense flares and intermittent low-flux states, with a dynamical range of\nseveral orders of magnitude on timescales of hours. During the 2015 June-July\nX-ray outburst a joint Swift and INTEGRAL observing campaign captured V404 Cyg\nin one of these low-flux states. The simultaneous Swift/XRT and\nINTEGRAL/JEM-X/ISGRI spectrum is reminiscent of that of obscured/absorbed AGN.\nIt can be modeled as a Comptonization spectrum, heavily absorbed by a partial\ncovering, high-column density material ($N_\\textrm{H} \\approx\n1.4\\times10^{24}\\,\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$), and a dominant reflection component,\nincluding a narrow Iron-K$\\alpha$ line. Such spectral distribution can be\nproduced by a geometrically thick accretion flow able to launch a clumpy mass\noutflow, likely responsible for both the high intrinsic absorption and the\nintense reflection emission observed. Similarly to what happens in certain\nobscured AGN, the low-flux states might not be solely related to a decrease in\nthe intrinsic luminosity, but could instead be caused by an almost complete\nobscuration of the inner accretion flow.\n", "  The hidden-charmed pentaquark $P_c(4450)$ and the charmonium-like state\n$Y(4274)$ are investigated as a $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c$ and a\n$D_s\\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ molecular state, respectively. The spin parities of\nthese two states cannot be well understood if only S-wave $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c$\nand $D_s\\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ interactions are considered. In this work, the\ninteractions are studied in a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach\nwith a partial wave decomposition on spin parity $J^P$, and the contributions\nof different partial waves are studied in a two-channel scattering model\nincluding a generating channel and an observation channel. Two poles at\n$4447\\pm4i$ and $4392\\pm46i$ MeV are produced from the $\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c$\ninteraction coupled with the $J/\\psi p$ channel in $3/2^-$ wave and $5/2^+$\nwave, respectively. The peak for the $5/2^+$ state has a comparable height as\nthat of the $3/2^-$ state in the $J/\\psi p$ invariant mass spectrum. The\n$D_s\\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ interaction coupled with the $J/\\psi\\phi$ channel is\nstudied and a pole at $4275\\pm11i$ MeV is produced in $J^{P}=1^{+}$ wave, which\ncorresponds to P-wave $D_s\\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ interaction. The pole from S-wave\n$D_s\\bar{D}_{s0}(2317)$ interaction is far below that from P-wave interaction\neven the $J/\\psi\\phi$ threshold, so cannot be observed in the $J/\\psi\\phi$\nchannel. The result suggests that in these cases a state carrying a spin parity\ncorresponding to P-wave interaction should be taken as seriously as these\ncarrying a spin parity corresponding to S-wave interaction in the hadronic\nmolecular state picture.\n", "  The early part of a supernova (SN) light-curve is dominated by radiation\nescaping from the expanding shock-heated progenitor envelope. For polytropic\nHydrogen envelopes, the properties of the emitted radiation are described by\nsimple analytic expressions and are nearly independent of the polytropic index,\n$n$. This analytic description holds at early time, $t<$~few days, during which\nradiation escapes from shells initially lying near the stellar surface. We use\nnumerical solutions to address two issues. First, we show that the analytic\ndescription holds at early time also for non-polytropic density profiles.\nSecond, we extend the solutions to later times, when the emission emerges from\ndeep within the envelope and depends on the progenitor's density profile.\nExamining the late time behavior of polytropic envelopes with a wide range of\ncore to envelope mass and radius ratios, $0.1\\le M_{\\rm c}/M_{\\rm env}\\le10$\nand $10^{-3}\\le R_{\\rm c}/R\\le10^{-1}$, we find that the effective temperature\nis well described by the analytic solution also at late time, while the\nluminosity $L$ is suppressed by a factor, which may be approximated to better\nthan $20[30]\\%$ accuracy up to $t=t_{\\rm tr}/a$ by $A\\exp[-(at/t_{\\rm\ntr})^\\alpha]$ with $t_{\\rm tr} = 15 (M_{\\rm env}/M_\\odot)^{3/4}(E/10^{51}{\\rm\nerg})^{-1/4}~\\rm d$, $A=0.9[0.8]$, $a=1.7[4.6]$ and $\\alpha=0.8[0.7]$ for\n$n=3/2[3]$. This description holds as long as the opacity is approximately that\nof a fully ionized gas, i.e. for $T>0.7~\\rm eV$, $t<14(R/10^{13.5}{\\rm\ncm})^{0.55}~\\rm d$. The suppression of $L$ at $t_{\\rm tr}/a$ obtained for\nstandard polytropic envelopes may account for the first optical peak of\ndouble-peaked SN light curves, with first peak at a few days for $M_{\\rm\nenv}<1M_\\odot$.\n", "  Stimulated by the exciting progress in the observation of new bottomonium\nstates, we study the bottomonium spectrum. To calculate the mass spectrum, we\nadopt a nonrelativistic screened potential model. The radial Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation is solved with the three-point difference central method, where the\nspin-dependent potentials are dealt with non-perturbatively. With this\ntreatment, the corrections of the spin-dependent potentials to the wave\nfunctions can be included successfully. Furthermore, we calculate the\nelectromagnetic transitions of the $nS$ ($n\\leq 4$), $nP$ ($n\\leq 3$), and $nD$\n($n\\leq 2$) bottomonium states with a nonrelativistic electromagnetic\ntransition operator widely applied to meson photoproduction reactions. Our\npredicted masses, hyperfine and fine splittings, electromagnetic transition\nwidths and branching ratios of the bottomonium states are in good agreement\nwith the available experimental data. Especially, the EM transitions of\n$\\Upsilon(3S)\\to \\chi_{b1,2}(1P)\\gamma$, which were not well understood in\nprevious studies, can be reasonably explained by considering the corrections of\nthe spin-dependent interactions to the wave functions. We also discuss the\nobservations of the missing bottomonium states by using radiative transitions.\nSome important radiative decay chains involving the missing bottomonium states\nare suggested to be observed. We hope our study can provide some useful\nreferences to observe and measure the properties of bottomonium mesons in\nforthcoming experiments.\n", "  The high energy events observed at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have\ntriggered many investigations interpreting the highly energetic neutrinos\ndetected as decay products of heavy unstable Dark Matter particles. However,\nwhile very detailed treatments of the IceCube phenomenology exist, only a few\nreferences focus on the (non-trivial) Dark Matter production part -- and all of\nthose rely on relatively complicated new models which are not always testable\ndirectly. We instead investigate two of the most minimal scenarios possible,\nwhere the operator responsible for the IceCube events is directly involved in\nDark Matter production. We show that the simplest (four-dimensional) operator\nis not powerful enough to accommodate all constraints. A more non-minimal\nsetting (at mass dimension six), however, can do both fitting all the data and\nalso allowing for a comparatively small parameter space only, parts of which\ncan be in reach of future observations. We conclude that minimalistic\napproaches can be enough to explain all data required, while complicated new\nphysics seems not to be required by IceCube.\n", "  We propose an efficient light-matter interface at optical frequencies between\na single photon and a superconducting qubit. The desired interface is based on\na hybrid architecture composed of an organic molecule embedded inside an\noptical waveguide and electrically coupled to a superconducting qubit placed\nnear the outside surface of the waveguide. We show that high fidelity,\nphoton-mediated, entanglement between distant superconducting qubits can be\nachieved with incident pulses at the single photon level. Such a low light\nlevel is highly desirable for achieving a coherent optical interface with\nsuperconducting qubit, since it minimizes decoherence arising from the\nabsorption of light.\n", "  We report the first direct spectroscopic measurement of the velocity\ndispersion function (VDF) for the high-mass red sequence (RS) galaxy population\nat redshift $z\\sim0.55$. We achieve high precision by using a sample of 600,000\nmassive galaxies with spectra from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS) of the third Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), covering stellar\nmasses $M_*\\gtrsim10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$. We determine the VDF by projecting the\njoint probability-density function (PDF) of luminosity $L$ and velocity\ndispersion $\\sigma$, i.e. $p(L,\\sigma)$, defined by our previous measurements\nof the RS luminosity function and $L-\\sigma$ relation for this sample. These\nmeasurements were corrected from red--blue galaxy population confusion,\nphotometric blurring, incompleteness and selection effects within a\nforward-modeling framework that furthermore correctly accommodates the low\nspectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio of individual BOSS spectra. Our $z\\sim0.55$\nRS VDF is in overall agreement with the $z\\sim0$ early-type galaxy (ETG) VDF at\n$\\log_{10}\\sigma\\gtrsim2.47$, however the number density of $z=0.55$ RS\ngalaxies that we report is larger than that of $z=0$ ETG galaxies at\n$2.35\\gtrsim\\log_{10}\\sigma\\gtrsim 2.47$. The extrapolation of an\nintermediate-mass L-$\\sigma$ relation towards the high-mass end in previous\nlow-z works may be responsible for this disagreement. Evolutionary\ninterpretation of this comparison is also subject to differences in the way the\nrespective samples are selected; these differences can be mitigated in future\nwork by analyzing $z=0$ SDSS data using the same framework presented in this\npaper. We also provide the sample PDF for the RS population (i.e. uncorrected\nfor incompleteness), which is a key ingredient for gravitational lensing\nanalyses using BOSS.\n", "  In this paper the role of gradient micro-inertia terms\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ and free micro-inertia terms\n$\\eta\\lVert p_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ is investigated to unveil their respective effect\non the dynamical behavior of band-gap metamaterials. We show that the term\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ alone is only able to disclose\nrelatively simplified dispersive behaviors. On the other hand, the term\n$\\eta\\lVert p_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ is in charge of the description of the full\ncomplex behavior of band-gap metamaterials. A suitable mixing of the two\nmicro-inertia terms allows to describe a new feature of the\nrelaxed-micromorphic model, i.e. the description of a second band-gap occurring\nfor higher frequencies. We also show that a split of the gradient micro-inertia\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$, in the sense of Cartan-Lie\ndecomposition of matrices, allows to flatten separately longitudinal and\ntransverse optic branches thus giving the possibility of a second band-gap.\nFinally, we investigate the effect of the gradient inertia\n$\\bar{\\eta}\\lVert\\nabla u_{,t}\\rVert^{2}$ on more classical enriched models as\nthe Mindlin-Eringen and the internal variable ones. We find that the addition\nof such gradient micro-inertia allows for the onset of one band-gap in the\nMindlin-Eringen model and of three band-gaps in the internal variable model. In\nthis last case, however, non-local effects cannot be accounted for which is a\ntoo drastic simplification for most metamaterials. We conclude that, even when\nadding gradient micro-inertia terms, the relaxed micromorphic model remains the\nmost performing one, among the considered enriched model, for the description\nof non-local band-gap metamaterials.\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators (TCI) are a new class of materials which\nhave metallic surface states on select surfaces due to point group crystalline\nsymmetries. In this letter, we consider a model for a three-dimensional (3D)\ntopological crystalline insulator with Dirac nodes occurring on a surface that\nare protected by the mirror and time reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that the\nelectromagnetic response for such a system is characterized by a $1$-form\n$b_{\\mu}$. $b_{\\mu}$ can be inferred from the locations of the surface Dirac\nnodes in energy-momentum space and couples to the surface Dirac nodes like a\nvalley gauge field. From both the effective action and analytical band\nstructure calculations, we show that the vortex core of $\\vec b$ or a domain\nwall of a component of $\\vec b$ can trap surface charges.\n", "  We study an intermediate quantum coherent-incoherent charge transport\nmechanism in metal-molecule-metal junctions using B\\\"uttiker's probe technique.\nThis tool allows us to include incoherent effects in a controlled manner, and\nthus to study situations in which partial decoherence affects charge transfer\ndynamics. Motivated by recent experiments on intermediate coherent-incoherent\ncharge conduction in DNA molecules [L. Xiang {\\it et al.}, Nature Chem. 7,\n221-226 (2015)], we focus on two representative structures: alternating\n(GC)$_n$ and stacked G$_n$C$_n$ sequences; the latter structure is argued to\nsupport charge delocalization within G segments, and thus an intermediate\ncoherent-incoherent conduction. We begin our analysis with a highly simplified\n1-dimensional tight-binding model, while introducing environmental effects\nthrough B\\\"uttiker's probes. This minimal model allows us to gain fundamental\nunderstanding of transport mechanisms and derive analytic results for molecular\nresistance in different limits. We then use a more detailed ladder-model\nHamiltonian to represent double-stranded DNA structures---with environmental\neffects captured by B\\\"uttiker's probes. We find that hopping conduction\ndominates in alternating sequences, while in stacked sequences charge\ndelocalization (visualized directly through the electronic density matrix)\nsupports significant resonant-ballistic charge dynamics reflected by an\neven-odd effect and a weak distance dependence for resistance. Our analysis\nillustrates that lessons learned from minimal models are helpful for\ninterpreting charge dynamics in DNA.\n", "  We study single spin asymmetries at one-loop accuracy in Drell-Yan processes\nin which one of the initial hadrons is transversely polarized. The\nspin-dependent part of differential cross-sections can be factorized with\nvarious hadronic matrix elements of twist-2 and twist-3 operators. These\noperators can be of even- and odd-chirality. In this work, the studied\nobservables of asymmetries are differential cross-sections with different\nweights. These weights are selected so that the observables are spin-dependent\nand their virtual corrections are completely determined by quark form factor.\nIn the calculations of one-loop corrections we meet collinear divergences in\nthe contributions involving chirality-odd and chirality-even operators. We find\nthat all of the divergences can be correctly subtracted. Therefore, our results\ngive an explicit example of QCD factorization with twist-3 operators,\nespecially, QCD factorization with chirality-odd twist-3 operators.\n", "  We refine the mass and environment dependent spherical collapse model of\nchameleon $f(R)$ gravity by calibrating a phenomenological correction inspired\nby the parameterized post-Friedmann framework against high-resolution $N$-body\nsimulations. We employ our method to predict the corresponding modified halo\nmass function, and provide fitting formulas to calculate the fractional\nenhancement of the $f(R)$ halo abundance with respect to that of General\nRelativity (GR) within a precision of $\\lesssim 5\\%$ from the results obtained\nin the simulations. Similar accuracy can be achieved for the full $f(R)$ mass\nfunction on the condition that the modeling of the reference GR abundance of\nhalos is accurate at the percent level. We use our fits to forecast constraints\non the additional scalar degree of freedom of the theory, finding that upper\nbounds competitive with current Solar System tests are within reach of cluster\nnumber count analyses from ongoing and upcoming surveys at much larger scales.\nImportantly, the flexibility of our method allows also for this to be applied\nto other scalar-tensor theories characterized by a mass and environment\ndependent spherical collapse.\n", "  A theoretical and computational investigation is carried out of a dissipative\nmodel of rate-independent strain-gradient plasticity and its regularization. It\nis shown that the flow relation, when expressed in terms of the Cauchy stress,\nis necessarily global. The most convenient approach to formulating the flow\nrelation is through the use of a dissipation function. It is shown, however,\nthat the task of obtaining the dual version, in the form of a normality\nrelation, is a complex one. A numerical investigation casts further light on\nthe response using the dissipative theory in situations of non-proportional\nloading. The elastic gap, a feature reported in recent investigations, is\nobserved in situations in which passivation has been imposed. It is shown\ncomputationally that the gap may be regarded as an efficient path between a\nload-deformation response corresponding to micro-free boundary conditions, and\nthat corresponding to micro-hard boundary conditions, in which plastic strains\nare set equal to zero.\n", "  Self-consistent approaches to superfluid many-fermion systems in 3-dimensions\n(and subsequent time-dependent approaches) require a large number of\ndiagonalizations of very large dimension hermitian matrices, which results in\nenormous computational costs. We present an approach based on the shifted\nconjugate-orthogonal conjugate-gradient (COCG) method for the evaluation of the\nGreen's function, from which we subsequently extract various densities\n(particle number, spin, current, kinetic energy, etc.) of a nuclear system\nneeded in self-consistent approaches. The approach eschews the construction of\nthe quasiparticle wavefunctions and their corresponding quasiparticle energies,\nwhich are never explicitly needed in any density functional approaches. As\nbenchmarks we present calculations for nuclei with axial symmetry, including\nthe ground state of spherical (magic or semi-magic) and axially deformed\nnuclei, the saddle-point in the $^{240}$Pu constrained fission path, and a\nvortex in the neutron star crust.\n", "  Starting from the classical action for a spin-zero particle in a\nD-dimensional anti-Sitter (AdS) spacetime, we recover the\nBreitenlohner-Freedman bound by quantization. For D=4,5,7, and using an Sl(2;K)\nspinor notation for K=R,C,H, we find a bi-twistor form of the action for which\nthe AdS isometry group is linearly realised, although only for zero mass when\nD=4,7, in agreement with previous constructions. For zero mass and D=4, the\nconformal isometry group is linearly realized. We extend these results to the\nsuperparticle in the maximally supersymmetric \"AdS x S\" string/M-theory vacua,\nshowing that quantization yields a 128+128 component supermultiplet. We also\nextend them to the null string.\n", "  We investigate thermodynamics of feedback processes driven by measurement.\nRegarding system and memory device as a composite system, mutual information as\na measure of correlation between the two constituents contributes to the\nentropy of the composite system, which makes the generalized total entropy of\nthe joint system and reservoir satisfy the second law of thermodynamics. We\ninvestigate the thermodynamics of the Szilard engine for an intermediate period\nbefore the completion of cycle. We show the second law to hold resolving the\nparadox of Maxwell's demon independent of the period taken into account. We\nalso investigate a feedback process to confine a particle excessively within a\ntrap, which is operated by repetitions of feedback in a finite time interval.\nWe derive the stability condition for multi-step feedback and find the\ncondition for confinement below thermal fluctuation in the absence of feedback.\nThe results are found to depend on interval between feedback steps and\nintensity of feedback protocol, which are expected to be important parameters\nin real experiments.\n", "  Using the event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics VISH2+1 with MC-Glauber,\nMC-KLN, and AMPT initial conditions, we investigate the correlations of flow\nharmonics, including the symmetric cumulants $SC^{v}(m, n)$, the normalized\nsymmetric cumulants $NSC(m, n)$, and the Pearson correlation coefficients\n$C(v_{m}^{2}, v_{n}^{2})$ in 2.76A TeV Pb--Pb collisions. We find $SC^{v}(m,\nn)$ is sensitive to both initial conditions and the specific shear viscosity\n$\\eta/s$. A comparison with the recent ALICE data show that our hydrodynamic\ncalculations can qualitatively describe the data of $SC^{v}(3, 2)$ and\n$SC^{v}(4, 2)$ for various initial conditions, which demonstrate that $v_2$,\n$v_4$ are correlated and $v_2$, $v_3$ are anti-correlated. Meanwhile, the\npredicted symmetric cumulants $SC^{v}(5, 2)$, $SC^{v}(5, 3)$, and $SC^{v}(4,\n3)$ reveal that $v_2$ and $v_5$, $v_3$ and $v_5$ are correlated, $v_3$ and\n$v_4$ are anti-correlated in most centrality classes. We also find $NSC^{v}(3,\n2)$ and $C(v_{3}^{2}, v_{2}^{2})$, which are insensitive to $\\eta/s$, are\nmainly determined by corresponding $NSC^{\\varepsilon}(3, 2)$ and\n$C(\\varepsilon_{3}^{2}, \\varepsilon_{2}^{2})$ correlators from the initial\nstate. In contrast, other $NSC^{v}(m, n)$ and $C(v_{m}^{2}, v_{n}^{2})$\ncorrelators are influenced by both initial conditions and $\\eta/s$, which\nillustrates the non-linear mode couplings in higher flow harmonics with $n \\geq\n4$.\n", "  The classical treatment of plasmonics is insufficient at the nanometer-scale\ndue to quantum mechanical surface phenomena. Here, an extension to the\nclassical paradigm is reported which rigorously remedies this deficiency\nthrough the incorporation of first-principles surface response functions - the\nFeibelman d-parameters - in general geometries. Several analytical results for\nthe leading-order plasmonic quantum corrections are obtained in a\nfirst-principles setting; particularly, a clear separation of the roles of\nshape, scale, and material is established. The utility of the formalism is\nillustrated by the derivation of a modified sum-rule for complementary\nstructures, a rigorous reformulation of Kreibig's phenomenological damping\nprescription, and an account of the small-scale resonance-shifting of simple\nand noble metal nanostructures. These insights open the technological design\nspace and deepen our fundamental understanding of nanoplasmonics beyond the\nclassical regime.\n", "  A great variety of models can describe the non-linear response of rubber to\nuni-axial tension. Yet an in-depth understanding of the successive stages of\nlarge extension is still lacking. We show that the response can be broken down\nin three steps, which we delineate by relying on a simple formatting of the\ndata, the so-called Mooney transform. First, the small-to-moderate regime,\nwhere the polymeric chains unfold easily and the Mooney plot is almost linear.\nSecond, the strain-hardening regime, where blobs of bundled chains unfold to\nstiffen the response in correspondence to the \"upturn\" of the Mooney plot.\nThird, the limiting-chain regime, with a sharp stiffening occurring as the\nchains extend towards their limit. We provide strain-energy functions with\nterms accounting for each stage, that (i) give an accurate local and then\nglobal fitting of the data; (ii) are consistent with weak non-linear elasticity\ntheory; and (iii) can be interpreted in the framework of statistical mechanics.\nWe apply our method to Treloar's classical experimental data and also to some\nmore recent data. Our method not only provides models that describe the\nexperimental data with a very low quantitative relative error, but also shows\nthat the theory of non-linear elasticity is much more robust that seemed at\nfirst sight.\n", "  Transient single-particle spectral function of BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$, a parent\ncompound of iron-based superconductors, has been studied by time- and\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an extreme-ultraviolet laser\ngenerated by higher harmonics from Ar gas, which enables us to investigate the\ndynamics in the entire Brillouin zone. We observed electronic modifications\nfrom the spin-density-wave (SDW) ordered state within $\\sim$ 1 ps after the\narrival of a 1.5 eV pump pulse. We observed optically excited electrons at the\nzone center above $E_{F}$ at 0.12 ps, and their rapid decay. After the fast\ndecay of the optically excited electrons, a thermalized state appears and\nsurvives for a relatively long time. From the comparison with the\ndensity-functional theory band structure for the paramagnetic and SDW states,\nwe interpret the experimental observations as the melting of the SDW.\nExponential decay constants for the thermalized state to recover back to the\nSDW ground state are $\\sim$ 0.60 ps both around the zone center and the zone\ncorner.\n", "  The hadro-quarkonium picture [S. Dubinskiy and M.B. Voloshin, Phys. Lett. B\n666, 344 (2008)] provides one possible interpretation for the pentaquark\ncandidates with hidden charm, recently reported by the LHCb Collaboration, as\nwell as for some of the charmonium-like \"X,Y,Z\" states. In this picture, a\nheavy quarkonium core resides within a light hadron giving rise to four- or\nfive-quark/antiquark bound states. We test this scenario in the heavy quark\nlimit by investigating the modification of the potential between a static\nquark-antiquark pair induced by the presence of a hadron. Our lattice QCD\nsimulations are performed on a Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS) ensemble\nwith $N_f = 2+1$ flavours of non-perturbatively improved Wilson quarks at a\npion mass of about 223 MeV and a lattice spacing of about 0.0854 fm. We study\nthe static potential in the presence of a variety of light mesons as well as of\noctet and decuplet baryons. In all these cases, the resulting configurations\nare favoured energetically. The associated binding energies between the\nquarkonium in the heavy quark limit and the light hadron are found to be\nsmaller than a few MeV, similar in strength to deuterium binding. It needs to\nbe seen if the small attraction survives in the infinite volume limit and\nsupports bound states or resonances.\n", "  NMR is a tool of choice for the measure of diffusion coefficients of species\nin solution. The DOSY experiment, a 2D implementation of this measure, has\nproven to be particularly useful for the study of complex mixtures, molecular\ninteractions, polymers, etc. However, DOSY data analysis requires to resort to\ninverse Laplace transform, in particular for polydisperse samples. This is a\nknown difficult numerical task, for which we present here a novel approach. A\nnew algorithm based on a splitting scheme and on the use of proximity operators\nis introduced. Used in conjunction with a Maximum Entropy and $\\ell_1$ hybrid\nregularisation, this algorithm converges rapidly and produces results robust\nagainst experimental noise. This method has been called PALMA. It is able to\nreproduce faithfully monodisperse as well as polydisperse systems, and numerous\nsimulated and experimental examples are presented. It has been implemented on\nthe server http://palma.labo.igbmc.fr where users can have their datasets\nprocessed automatically.\n", "  Lipid rafts are hypothesized to facilitate protein interaction, tension\nregulation, and trafficking in biological membranes, but the mechanisms\nresponsible for their formation and maintenance are not clear. Insights into\nmany other condensed matter phenomena have come from colloidal systems, whose\nmicron-scale particles mimic basic properties of atoms and molecules but permit\ndynamic visualization with single-particle resolution. Recently, experiments\nshowed that bidisperse mixtures of filamentous viruses can self-assemble into\ncolloidal monolayers with thermodynamically stable rafts exhibiting chiral\nstructure and repulsive interactions. We quantitatively explain these\nobservations by modeling the membrane particles as chiral liquid crystals.\nChiral twist promotes the formation of finite-sized rafts and mediates a\nrepulsion that distributes them evenly throughout the membrane. Although this\nsystem is composed of filamentous viruses whose aggregation is entropically\ndriven by dextran depletants instead of phospholipids and cholesterol with\nprominent electrostatic interactions, colloidal and biological membranes share\nmany of the same physical symmetries. Chiral twist can contribute to the\nbehavior of both systems and may account for certain stereospecific effects\nobserved in molecular membranes.\n", "  Exchange interactions with itinerant electrons are known to act as a\nrelaxation mechanism for individual local spins. The same exchange interactions\nare also known to induce the so called RKKY indirect exchange interaction\nbetween two otherwise decoupled local spins. Here we show that both the spin\nrelaxation and the RKKY coupling can be seen as the dissipative and reactive\nresponse to the coupling of the local spins with the itinerant electrons. We\nthereby predict that the spin relaxation rates of magnetic nanostructures of\nexchanged coupled local spins, such as as nanoengineered spin chains, have an\noscillatory dependence on $k_F d$ , where $k_F$ is the Fermi wave length and\n$d$ is the inter-spin distance, very much like the celebrated oscillations in\nthe RKKY interaction. We demonstrate that both $T_1$ and $T_2$ can be enhanced\nor suppressed, compared to the single spin limit, depending on the interplay\nbetween the Fermi surface and the nanostructure geometrical arrangement. Our\nresults open a route to engineer spin relaxation and decoherence in atomically\ndesigned spin structures.\n", "  Noble metals that currently dominate the fields of plasmonics and\nmetamaterials suffer from large ohmic losses. New plasmonic materials, such as\ndoped oxides and nitrides, have smaller material loss, and, using them in place\nof metals carries promise of reduced-loss plasmonic and metamaterial\nstructures, with sharper resonances and higher field concentration. This\npromise is put to a rigorous analytical test in this work which reveals that\nhaving low material loss is not sufficient to have a reduced modal loss in\nplasmonic structures. To reduce the modal loss it is absolutely necessary for\nthe plasma frequency to be significantly higher than the operational frequency.\nUsing examples of nanoparticle plasmons and gap plasmons one comes to the\nconclusion that even in the mid-infrared spectrum metals continue to hold\nadvantage over the alternative media. The new materials may still find\napplication niche where the high absorption loss is beneficial, e.g. in\nmedicine and thermal photovoltaics.\n", "  We study a periodically driven nanowire with Rashba-like conduction and\nvalence bands in the presence of a magnetic field. We identify topological\nregimes in which the system hosts zero-energy Majorana fermions. We further\ninvestigate the effect of strong electron-electron interactions that give rise\nto parafermion zero energy modes hosted at the nanowire ends. The first setup\nwe consider allows for topological phases by applying only static magnetic\nfields without the need of superconductivity. The second setup involves both\nsuperconductivity and time-dependent magnetic fields and allows one to generate\ntopological phases without fine-tuning of the chemical potential. Promising\ncandidate materials are graphene nanoribbons due to their intrinsic\nparticle-hole symmetry.\n", "  According to the classical theory of elasticity, a plate subjected to a\nbending moment always deflects with symmetric tensile and compressive strains\nin its two sides, without overall deformation perpendicular to the bending\nmoment. Here, we find by ab initio simulations that significant overall tensile\nstrain can be induced by pure bending in a wide range of two-dimensional\ncrystals perpendicular to the bending moment, just like an accordion being bent\nto open. This accordion effect is raised by asymmetric response of chemical\nbonds and electron density to the bending curvature, with the tensile strain\nbeing a power function of the curvature.\n", "  In this work we propose a series-expansion thermal tensor network (SETTN)\napproach for efficient simulations of quantum lattice models. This\ncontinuous-time SETTN method is based on the numerically exact Taylor series\nexpansion of equilibrium density operator $e^{-\\beta H}$ (with $H$ the total\nHamiltonian and $\\beta$ the imaginary time), and is thus Trotter-error free. We\ndiscover, through simulating XXZ spin chain and square-lattice quantum Ising\nmodels, that not only the Hamiltonian $H$, but also its powers $H^n$, can be\nefficiently expressed as matrix product operators, which enables us to\ncalculate with high precision the equilibrium and dynamical properties of\nquantum lattice models at finite temperatures. Our SETTN method provides an\nalternative to conventional Trotter-Suzuki renormalization group (RG)\napproaches, and achieves an unprecedented standard of thermal RG simulations in\nterms of accuracy and flexibility.\n", "  In this paper, we describe the dynamics of a Bianchi Type V vacuum universe\nwith an arbitrary cosmological constant. We begin by using an orthonormal frame\napproach to write Einstein's field equations as a coupled system of first-order\nordinary differential equations. The equilibrium points of the resulting\ndynamical system are found to be expanding and contracting de Sitter universe\nsolutions, a Minkowski spacetime solution, and static Anti-de Sitter universe\nsolutions, which are characterized by a negative cosmological constant in\naddition to constant negative spatial curvature. While the expanding de Sitter\nuniverse solution is found to be asymptotically stable for $\\Lambda > 0$, we\nalso found that the AdS solution is stable for $\\Lambda < 0$, as solutions form\nclosed trajectories around it. Further, we show that the different equilibrium\npoints are related to each other by a series of bifurcations of $\\Lambda$.\n", "  We show that the isotope effect leads to a completely different spectroscopic\nsignal in hydrogen-deuterium mixtures, compared to pure elements that have the\nsame crystal structure. This is particularly true for molecular vibrations,\nwhich are the main source of information about the structure of high-pressure\nhydrogen. Mass disorder breaks translational symmetry, meaning that vibrations\nare localized almost to single molecules, and are not zone-center phonons. In\nmixtures, each observable IR peak corresponds to a collection of many such\nmolecular vibrations, which have a distribution of frequencies depending on\nlocal environment. Furthermore discrete groups of environments cause the peaks\nto split. We illustrate this issue by considering the IR spectrum of the high\npressure Phase III structure of hydrogen, recently interpreted as showing novel\nphases in isotopic mixtures. We calculate the IR spectrum of hydrogen/deuterium\nmixtures in the $C2/c$ and $Cmca$-12 structures, showing that isotopic disorder\ngives rise to mode localization of the high frequency vibrons. The local\ncoordination of the molecules leads to discrete IR peaks. The spread of\nfrequencies is strongly enhanced with pressure, such that more peaks become\nresolvable at higher pressures, in agreement with the recent measurements.\n", "  We study the electrical conductance $G$ and the thermopower $S$ of\nsingle-molecule junctions, and reveal signatures of different transport\nmechanisms: off-resonant tunneling, on-resonant coherent (ballistic) motion,\nand multi-step hopping. These mechanisms are identified by studying the\nbehavior of $G$ and $S$ while varying molecular length and temperature. Based\non a simple one-dimensional model for molecular junctions, we derive\napproximate expressions for the thermopower in these different regimes.\nAnalytical results are compared to numerical simulations, performed using a\nvariant of B\\\"uttiker's probe technique, the so-called voltage-temperature\nprobe, which allows us to phenomenologically introduce environmentally-induced\nelastic and inelastic electron scattering effects, while applying both voltage\nand temperature biases across the junction. We further simulate the thermopower\nof GC-rich DNA molecules with mediating A:T blocks, and manifest the\ntunneling-to-hopping crossover in both the electrical conductance and the\nthermopower, in accord with measurements by Y. Li et al., Nature Comm. 7, 11294\n(2016).\n", "  We investigate the metric perturbations of the restricted f(R) theory of\ngravity in the cosmological context and explore the phenomenological\nimplications of this model. We show that it is possible to construct a\nrestricted model of gravity, in which the background equations are the same as\nthe equations of motion which are derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action with\nthe cosmological constant term. We argue that the deviation from the\nEinstein-Hilbert model emerges in the perturbed equations, for which we have a\nnon-vanishing anisotropic stress. Further, with the help of the results of\nPlanck data for the modified gravity we obtain constraints on the parameters of\nthe model.\n", "  Rayleigh-Benard convection and Taylor-Couette flow are two canonical flows\nthat have many properties in common. We here compare the two flows in detail\nfor parameter values where the Nusselt numbers, i.e. the thermal transport and\nthe angular momentum transport normalized by the corresponding laminar values,\ncoincide. We study turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in air at Rayleigh\nnumber Ra=1e7 and Taylor-Couette flow at shear Reynolds number Re_S=2e4 for two\ndifferent mean rotation rates but the same Nusselt numbers. For individual\npairwise related fields and convective currents, we compare the probability\ndensity functions normalized by the corresponding root mean square values and\ntaken at different distances from the wall. We find one rotation number for\nwhich there is very good agreement between the mean profiles of the two\ncorresponding quantities temperature and angular momentum. Similarly, there is\ngood agreement between the fluctuations in temperature and velocity components.\nFor the heat and angular momentum currents, there are differences in the\nfluctuations outside the boundary layers that increase with overall rotation\nand can be related to differences in the flow structures in the boundary layer\nand in the bulk. The study extends the similarities between the two flows from\nglobal quantities to local quantities and reveals the effects of rotation on\nthe transport.\n", "  $^{\\rm {180m}}$Ta is the rarest naturally occurring quasi-stable isotope and\nthe longest lived metastable state which is known. Its possible decay via the\n$\\beta^-$ or the electron capture channel has never been observed. This article\npresents a search for the decay of $^{\\rm {180m}}$Ta with an ultra low\nbackground Sandwich HPGe gamma spectrometry setup in the HADES underground\nlaboratory. No signal is observed and improved lower partial half-life limits\nare set with a Bayesian analysis to $5.8\\cdot10^{16}$ yr for the $\\beta^-$\nchannel and $2.0\\cdot10^{17}$ yr for the electron capture channel (90%\ncredibility). The total half-life of $^{\\rm {180m}}$Ta is longer than\n$4.5\\cdot10^{16}$ yr. This is more than a factor of two improvement compared to\nprevious searches.\n", "  Ellerman Bombs are signatures of magnetic reconnection, which is an important\nphysical process in the solar atmosphere. How and where they occur is a subject\nof debate. In this paper we analyse Sunrise/IMaX data together with 3D MHD\nsimulations that aim to reproduce the exact scenario proposed for the formation\nof these features. Although the observed event seems to be more dynamic and\nviolent than the simulated one, simulations clearly confirm the basic scenario\nfor the production of EBs. The simulations also reveal the full complexity of\nthe underlying process. The simulated observations show that the Fe I 525.02 nm\nline gives no information on the height where reconnection takes place. It can\nonly give clues about the heating in the aftermath of the reconnection. The\ninformation on the magnetic field vector and velocity at this spatial\nresolution is, however, extremely valuable because it shows what numerical\nmodels miss and how they can be improved.\n", "  In this work, we provide an overview of how well-established concepts in the\nfields of quantum chemistry and material sciences have to be adapted when the\nquantum nature of light becomes important in correlated matter-photon problems.\nTherefore, we analyze model systems in optical cavities, where the\nmatter-photon interaction is considered from the weak- to the strong coupling\nlimit and for individual photon modes as well as for the multi-mode case. We\nidentify fundamental changes in Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, spectroscopic\nquantities, conical intersections and efficiency for quantum control. We\nconclude by applying our novel recently developed quantum-electrodynamical\ndensity-functional theory to single-photon emission and show how a\nstraightforward approximation accurately describes the correlated\nelectron-photon dynamics. This paves the road to describe matter-photon\ninteractions from first-principles and addresses the emergence of new states of\nmatter in chemistry and material science.\n", "  We observe the nonlinearity of the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) ladder in the\nAutler-Townes spectroscopy of the hyperfine ground states for a Rydberg-dressed\ntwo-atom system. Here the role of the two-level system in the JC model is\nplayed by the presence or absence of a collective Rydberg excitation, and the\nbosonic mode manifests as the number $n$ of single atom spin flips,\nsymmetrically distributed between the atoms. We measure the normal-mode\nsplitting and $\\sqrt{n}$ nonlinearity as a function of detuning and Rabi\nfrequency, thereby experimentally establishing the isomorphism with the JC\nmodel.\n", "  Optical non-linearities, such as thermo-optic effects and\nfree-carrier-dispersion, are often considered as undesired effects in\nsilicon-based resonators and, more specifically, optomechanical (OM) cavities,\naffecting the relative detuning between an optical resonance and the excitation\nlaser. However, the interplay between such mechanisms could also enable\nunexpected physical phenomena to be used in new applications. In the present\nwork, we exploit those non-linearities and their intercoupling with the\nmechanical degrees of freedom of a silicon OM nanobeam to unveil a rich set of\nfundamentally different complex dynamics. By smoothly changing the parameters\nof the excitation laser, namely its power and wavelength, we demonstrate\naccurate control for activating bi-dimensional and tetra-dimensional\nlimit-cycles, a period doubling route and chaos. In addition, by scanning the\nlaser parameters in opposite senses we demonstrate bistability and hysteresis\nbetween bi-dimensional and tetra-dimensional limit-cycles, between different\ncoherent mechanical states and between tetra-dimensional limit-cycles and\nchaos. As a result of implementing the Rosenstein algorithm to the experimental\ntime series we have extracted a Largest Lyapunov Exponent of LLE=1.3x10^5 s-1,\nwhich is between one and two orders of magnitude lower than the typical\noscillating frequencies of the system. Most of the experimental features can be\nwell reproduced with a model of first-order non-linear differential equations\ncoupled through the number of intracavity photons. Our findings open several\nroutes towards exploiting silicon-based OM photonic crystals for systems with\nmemory and, more specifically, for chaos based applications such as secure\ninformation transfer or sensing.\n", "  The jet Trimming procedure has been demonstrated to greatly improve event\nreconstruction in hadron collisions, by mitigating contamination due initial\nstate radiation, multiple interactions, and event pileup. Meanwhile, Qjets -- a\nnondeterministic approach to tree-based jet substructure has been shown to be a\npowerful technique in decreasing random statistical fluctuations, yielding\nsignificant effective luminosity improvements. This manifests through an\nimprovement in the significance $S/\\delta B$, relative to conventional methods.\nQjets also provide novel observables in many cases, like mass-volatility, that\ncould be used to further discriminate between signal and background events. The\nstatistical robustness and volatility observables, for tagging, are obtained\nsimultaneously. We explore here a combination of the two techniques, and\ndemonstrate that significant enhancements in discovery potentials may be\nobtained in non-trivial ways. We will illustrate this by considering a diboson\nresonance analysis as a case study -- enabling us to interpolate between\nscenarios where the gains are purely due to statistical robustness and\nscenarios where the gains are also reinforced by volatility variable\ndiscriminants. The former, for instance, is applicable to digluon/diquark\nresonances, while the latter will be of relevance to di-$W^\\pm$/di-$Z^0$\nresonances, where the boosted vector bosons are decaying hadronically and have\nan intrinsic mass scale attached to them. We argue that one can enhance signal\nsignificance and discovery potentials markedly through stochastic grooming, and\nhelp augment studies at the Large Hadron Collider and future hadron colliders.\n", "  Event-by-event fluctuations caused by quantum mechanical fluctuations in the\nwave function of colliding nuclei in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions\nwere recently shown to be necessary for the simultaneous description of\n$R_{AA}$ as well as the elliptic and triangular flow harmonics at high $p_T$ in\nPbPb collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. In fact, the presence of a finite\ntriangular flow as well as cumulants of the flow harmonic distribution that\ndiffer from the mean are only possible when these event-by-event fluctuations\nare considered. In this paper we combine event-by-event viscous hydrodynamics\nand jet quenching to make predictions for high $p_T$ $R_{AA}$, $v_2\\{2\\}$,\n$v_3\\{2\\}$, and $v_2\\{4\\}$ in PbPb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. With\nan order of magnitude larger statistics we find that high $p_T$ elliptic flow\ndoes not scale linearly with the soft elliptical flow, as originally thought,\nbut has deviations from perfectly linear scaling. A new experimental\nobservable, which involves the difference between the ratio of harmonic flow\ncumulants at high and low $p_T$, is proposed to investigate the fluctuations of\nhigh $p_T$ flow harmonics and measure this nonlinear response. By varying the\npath length dependence of the energy loss and the viscosity of the evolving\nmedium we find that $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and $v_2\\{2\\}(p_T)$ strongly depend on the\nchoice for the path length dependence of the energy loss, which can be\nconstrained using the new LHC run 2 data.\n", "  It has been repeatedly stated that maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of\nexponents of power-law distributions can only be reliably obtained for\nexponents smaller than minus one. The main argument that power laws are\notherwise not normalizable, depends on the underlying sample space the data is\ndrawn from, and is true only for sample spaces that are unbounded from above.\nHere we show that power-laws obtained from bounded sample spaces (as is the\ncase for practically all data related problems) are always free of such\nlimitations and maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained for arbitrary\npowers without restrictions. Here we first derive the appropriate ML estimator\nfor arbitrary exponents of power-law distributions on bounded discrete sample\nspaces. We then show that an almost identical estimator also works perfectly\nfor continuous data. We implemented this ML estimator and discuss its\nperformance with previous attempts. We present a general recipe of how to use\nthese estimators and present the associated computer codes.\n", "  We study the evolution of the Kondo effect in heavy fermion compounds,\nYb(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$Zn$_{20}$ (0$\\leqslant$ x $\\leqslant$ 1), by means\nof temperature-dependent electric resistivity and specific heat. The ground\nstate of YbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ can be well described by a Kondo model with\ndegeneracy $N$ = 8 and a $T_K\\sim$30 K. In the presence of a very similar total\nCEF splitting with YbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$, the ground state of YbCo$_2$Zn$_{20}$ is\nclose to a Kondo state with degeneracy $N$ = 2 and a much lower $T_K\\sim$ 2 K.\nUpon Co substitution, the coherence temperature of YbFe$_2$Zn$_{20}$ is\nsuppressed, accompanied by an emerging Schottky-like feature in specific heat\nassociated with the thermal depopulation of CEF levels upon cooling. For\n0.4$\\lesssim$ x $\\lesssim$ 0.9, the ground state remains roughly the same which\ncan be qualitatively understood by Kondo effect in the presence of CEF\nsplitting. There is no clear indication of Kondo coherence observable in\nresistivity within this substitution range down to 500 mK. The coherence\nre-appears at around x$\\gtrsim$ 0.9 and the coherence temperature increases\nwith higher Co concentration levels.\n", "  We generalize the notion of Haldane pseudopotentials to anisotropic\nfractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems which are physically realized, e.g., in\ntilted magnetic field experiments or anisotropic band structures. This\nformalism allows us to expand any translation-invariant interaction over a\ncomplete basis, and directly reveals the intrinsic metric of incompressible FQH\nfluids. We show that purely anisotropic pseudopotentials give rise to new types\nof bound states for small particle clusters in the infinite plane, and can be\nused as a diagnostic of FQH nematic order. We also demonstrate that generalized\npseudopotentials quantify the anisotropic contribution to the effective\ninteraction potential, which can be particularly large in models of fractional\nChern insulators.\n", "  Previous work has established the usefulness of the resolvent operator that\nmaps the terms nonlinear in the turbulent fluctuations to the fluctuations\nthemselves. Further work has described the self-similarity of the resolvent\narising from that of the mean velocity profile. The orthogonal modes provided\nby the resolvent analysis describe the wall-normal coherence of the motions and\ninherit that self-similarity. In this contribution, we present the implications\nof this similarity for the nonlinear interaction between modes with different\nscales and wall-normal locations. By considering the nonlinear interactions\nbetween modes, it is shown that much of the turbulence scaling behaviour in the\nlogarithmic region can be determined from a single arbitrarily chosen reference\nplane. Thus, the geometric scaling of the modes is impressed upon the nonlinear\ninteraction between modes. Implications of these observations on the\nself-sustaining mechanisms of wall turbulence, modelling and simulation are\noutlined.\n", "  Topologically protected fermionic quasiparticles occur in metals with band\ndegeneracy as a consequence of band structure topology. Here we unveil\ntopological semimetal and metal phases in a variety of non-symmorphic collinear\nantiferromagnets with glide reflection symmetry, a combination of mirror and\nhalf-lattice translation. We find gapless phases with Dirac points having\nmultiple symmetry-protection as well as electronic structures with triple and\nquadruple band-crossing points. Glide semimetal is shown to be converted into a\ntopological phase with non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological charges at the\nDirac points due to inversion and time-inversion symmetry combination. More\nstriking is the emergence of a hidden non-unitary relation between the states\nin the glide sectors that provide a general mechanism to get multiple band\ntouching points. The split Fermi points uncover a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ protection\nthat drives the changeover of the multiple-degenerate gapless phase into a\ntopological metal built from their connection through distinct Fermi lines.\nBesides a new perspective of ordered states in complex materials, our findings\nindicate that novel topological gapless phases and edge states may occur in a\nwide class of magnetic systems.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the statistical properties of a wind-generated\nwave field and the spontaneous formation of rogue waves in an annular flume.\nUnlike many experiments on rogue waves, where waves are mechanically generated,\nhere the wave field is forced naturally by wind as it is in the ocean. What is\nunique about the present experiment is that the annular geometry of the tank\nmakes waves propagating circularly in an {\\it unlimited-fetch} condition.\nWithin this peculiar framework, we discuss the temporal evolution of the\nstatistical properties of the surface elevation. We show that rogue waves and\nheavy-tail statistics may develop naturally during the growth of the waves just\nbefore the wave height reaches a stationary condition. Our results shed new\nlight on the formation of rogue waves in a natural environment.\n", "  We account for dynamical spin effects in the holographic light-front\nwavefunction of the pion in order to predict its mean charge radius, decay\nconstant, spacelike electromagnetic form factor, twist-2 Distribution Amplitude\nand the photon-to-pion transition form factor. Using a universal fundamental\nAdS/QCD scale of 523 MeV and a constituent quark mass of 330 MeV, we find a\nremarkable improvement in describing all observables.\n", "  Complex physical dynamics can often be modeled as a Markov jump process\nbetween mesoscopic configurations. When jumps between mesoscopic states are\nmediated by thermodynamic reservoirs, the time-irreversibility of the jump\nprocess is a measure of the physical dissipation. We rederive a recently\nintroduced inequality relating the dissipation rate to current fluctuations in\njump processes. We then adapt these results to diffusion processes via a\nlimiting procedure, reaffirming that diffusions saturate the inequality.\nFinally, we study the impact of spatial coarse-graining in a two-dimensional\nmodel with driven diffusion. By observing fluctuations in coarse-grained\ncurrents, it is possible to infer a lower bound on the total dissipation rate,\nincluding the dissipation associated with hidden dynamics. The tightness of\nthis bound depends on how well the spatial coarse-graining detects dynamical\nevents that are driven by large thermodynamic forces.\n", "  We use 12 cosmological $N$-body simulations of Local Group systems (the\nApostle models) to inspect the relation between the virial mass of the main\nhaloes ($M_{\\rm vir,1}$ and $M_{\\rm vir,2}$), the mass derived from the\nrelative motion of the halo pair ($M_{\\rm tim}$), and that inferred from the\nlocal Hubble flow ($M_{\\rm lhf}$). We show that within the Spherical Collapse\nModel (SCM), the correspondence between the three mass estimates is exact, i.e.\n$M_{\\rm lhf}=M_{\\rm tim}=M_{\\rm vir,1}+M_{\\rm vir,2}$. However, comparison with\nApostle simulations reveals that, contrary to what the SCM states, a relatively\nlarge fraction of the mass that perturbs the local Hubble flow and drives the\nrelative trajectory of the main galaxies is not contained within $R_{\\rm vir}$,\nand that the amount of \"extra-virial\" mass tends to increase in galaxies with a\nslow accretion rate. In contrast, modelling the peculiar velocities around the\nLocal Group returns an unbiased constraint on the virial mass ratio of the main\ngalaxy pair. Adopting the outer halo profile found in $N$-body simulations,\nwhich scales as $\\rho\\sim R^{-4}$ at $R\\gtrsim R_{\\rm vir}$, indicates that the\ngalaxy masses perturbing the local Hubble flow roughly correspond to the\nasymptotically-convergent (total) masses of the individual haloes. We show that\nestimates of $M_{\\rm vir}$ based on the dynamics of tracers at $R\\gg R_{\\rm\nvir}$ require a priori information on the internal matter distribution and the\ngrowth rate of the main galaxies, both of which are typically difficult to\nquantify.\n", "  We use holography to compute spectral functions of certain fermionic\noperators in three different finite-density, zero-temperature states of ABJM\ntheory with a broken U(1) symmetry. In each of the three states, dual to\npreviously studied domain wall solutions of four-dimensional gauged\nsupergravity, we find that the fermionic operators have gapped spectra. In one\ncase the gap can be traced to the small charge of the fermions, while in the\nother cases it is due to a particular interaction that mixes particles and\nholes.\n", "  Thermal microwave states are omnipresent noise sources in superconducting\nquantum circuits covering all relevant frequency regimes. We use them as a\nprobe to identify three second-order decoherence mechanisms of a\nsuperconducting transmon. First, we quantify the efficiency of a resonator\nfilter in the dispersive Jaynes-Cummings regime and find evidence for parasitic\nloss channels. Second, we probe second-order noise in the low-frequency regime\nand demonstrate the expected $T^{3}$ temperature dependence of the qubit\ndephasing rate. Finally, we show that qubit parameter fluctuations due to\ntwo-level states are enhanced under the influence of thermal microwave states.\nIn particular, we experimentally confirm the $T^{2}$-dependence of the\nfluctuation spectrum expected for noninteracting two-level states.\n", "  The relativistic quantum Toda chain model is studied with the generalized\nalgebraic Bethe Ansatz method. By employing a set of local gauge\ntransformations, proper local vacuum states can be obtained for this model. The\nexact spectrum and eigenstates of the model are thus constructed\nsimultaneously.\n", "  In this work we have studied the singular behaviour of gravitational theories\nwith non symmetric connections. For this purpose we introduce a new criteria\nfor the appearance of singularities based on the existence of black/white hole\nregions of arbitrary codimension defined inside a spacetime of arbitrary\ndimension. We discuss this prescription by increasing the complexity of the\nparticular torsion theory under study. In this sense, we start with\nTeleparallel Gravity, then we analyse Einstein-Cartan theory, and finally\ndynamical torsion models.\n", "  We establish a general unified formulation which, using the optical theorem\nof electromagnetic helicity, shows that dichorism is a phenomenon arising in\nany scattering -or diffraction- process, elastic or not, of chiral\nelectromagnetic fields by objects either chiral or achiral. It is shown how\nthis approach paves the way to overcoming well-known limitations of standard\ncircular dichroism, like its weak signal or the difficulties of using it with\nmagnetodielectric particles.\n  Based on the angular spectrum representation of optical fields with only\nright circular or left circular plane waves, we introduce beams with transverse\nelliptic polarization and posessing a longitudinal component. Then our\nformulation for general optical fields shows how to enhance the extinction rate\nof incident helicity, (and therefore the dichroism signal), versus that of\nenergy of the light scattered or emitted by a particle, or viceversa.\n", "  We study the transmission of a disordered waveguide subjected to a finite\nbias field. The statisticaldistribution of transmission is analytically shown\nto take a universal form. It depends on a singleparameter, the system length\nexpressed in a rescaled metrics, which encapsulates all the microscopicfeatures\nof the medium and the bias field. Excellent agreement with numerics is found\nfor variousmodels of disorder and bias field. For white-noise disorder and a\nlinear bias field, we demonstratethe algebraic nature of the decay of the\ntransmission with distance, irrespective of the value ofthe bias field. It\ncontrasts with the expansion of a wave packet, which features a\ndelocalizationtransition for large bias field. The difference is attributed to\nthe different boundary conditionsfor the transmission and expansion schemes.\nThe observability of these effects in conductancemeasurements for electrons or\nultracold atoms is discussed, taking into account key features, suchas\nfinite-range disorder correlations, nonlinear bias fields, and finite\ntemperatures.\n", "  In this paper, we consider two case examples of Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI)\ngeneralizations of canonical large-field inflation models, characterized by a\nreduced sound speed, $c_{S} < 1$. The reduced speed of sound lowers the\ntensor-scalar ratio, improving the fit of the models to the data, but increases\nthe equilateral-mode non-Gaussianity, $f^\\mathrm{equil.}_\\mathrm{NL}$, which\nthe latest results from the Planck satellite constrain by a new upper bound. We\nexamine constraints on these models in light of the most recent Planck and\nBICEP/Keck results, and find that they have a greatly decreased window of\nviability. The upper bound on $f^\\mathrm{equil.}_\\mathrm{NL}$ corresponds to a\nlower bound on the sound speed and a corresponding lower bound on the\ntensor-scalar ratio of $r \\sim 0.01$, so that near-future Cosmic Microwave\nBackground observations may be capable of ruling out entire classes of DBI\ninflation models. The result is, however, not universal: infrared-type DBI\ninflation models, where the speed of sound increases with time, are not subject\nto the bound.\n", "  Using the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics, we derive a\nfour-component Wigner equation for a system composed of spin-1/2 fermions\n(typically, electrons) including the Zeeman effect and the spin-orbit coupling.\nThis Wigner equation is coupled to the appropriate Maxwell equations to form a\nself-consistent mean-field model. A set of semiclassical Vlasov equations with\nspin effects is obtained by expanding the full quantum model to first order in\nthe Planck constant. The corresponding hydrodynamic equations are derived by\ntaking velocity moments of the phase-space distribution function. A simple\nclosure relation is proposed to obtain a closed set of hydrodynamic equations.\n", "  The staggered quantum walk model on a graph is defined by an evolution\noperator that is the product of local operators related to two or more\nindependent graph tessellations. A graph tessellation is a partition of the set\nof nodes that respects the neighborhood relation. Flip-flop coined quantum\nwalks with the Hadamard or Grover coins can be expressed as staggered quantum\nwalks by converting the coin degree of freedom into extra nodes in the graph.\nWe propose an implementation of the staggered model with superconducting\nmicrowave resonators, where the required local operations are provided by the\nnearest neighbor interaction of the resonators coupled through superconducting\nquantum interference devices. The tunability of the interactions makes this\nsystem an excellent toolbox for this class of quantum walks. We focus on the\none-dimensional case and discuss its generalization to a more general class\nknown as triangle-free graphs.\n", "  SuperCDMS SNOLAB will be a next-generation experiment aimed at directly\ndetecting low-mass (< 10 GeV/c$^2$) particles that may constitute dark matter\nby using cryogenic detectors of two types (HV and iZIP) and two target\nmaterials (germanium and silicon). The experiment is being designed with an\ninitial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections ~ 1 x 10$^{-43}$ cm$^2$\nfor a dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV/c$^2$, and with capacity to continue\nexploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon\nsensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils\nfrom sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to\nlow energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV\ndetectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity\nshielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but\ncosmogenically produced $^{3}$H and naturally occurring $^{32}$Si will be\npresent in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are x10\nhigher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over three\norders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of 1\nGeV/c$^2$. The iZIP detectors are relatively insensitive to variations in\ndetector response and backgrounds, and will provide better sensitivity for dark\nmatter particle masses (> 5 GeV/c$^2$). The mix of detector types (HV and\niZIP), and targets (germanium and silicon), planned for the experiment, as well\nas flexibility in how the detectors are operated, will allow us to maximize the\nlow-mass reach, and understand the backgrounds that the experiment will\nencounter. Upgrades to the experiment, perhaps with a variety of\nultra-low-background cryogenic detectors, will extend dark matter sensitivity\ndown to the \"neutrino floor\", where coherent scatters of solar neutrinos become\na limiting background.\n", "  We present useful functions for the profiles of dark-matter (DM) haloes with\na free inner slope, from cusps to cores, where the profiles of density,\nmass-velocity and potential are simple analytic expressions. Analytic velocity\nis obtained by expressing the mean density as a simple functional form, and\nderiving the local density by differentiation. The function involves four shape\nparameters, with only two or three free: a concentration parameter $c$, inner\nand outer asymptotic slopes $\\alpha$ and $\\bar{\\gamma}$, and a middle shape\nparameter $\\beta$. Analytic expressions for the potential and velocity\ndispersion exist for $\\bar{\\gamma}=3$ and for $\\beta$ a natural number. We\nmatch the models to the DM haloes in cosmological simulations, with and without\nbaryons, ranging from steep cusps to flat cores. Excellent fits are obtained\nwith three free parameters ($c$, $\\alpha$, $\\bar{\\gamma}$) and $\\beta=2$. For\nan analytic potential, similar fits are obtained for $\\bar{\\gamma}=3$ and\n$\\beta=2$ with only two free parameters ($c$, $\\alpha$); this is our favorite\nmodel. A linear combination of two such profiles, with an additional free\nconcentration parameter, provides excellent fits also for $\\beta=1$, where the\nexpressions are simpler. The fit quality is comparable to non-analytic popular\nmodels. An analytic potential is useful for modeling the inner-halo evolution\ndue to gas inflows and outflows, studying environmental effects on the outer\nhalo, and generating halo potentials or initial conditions for simulations. The\nanalytic velocity can quantify simulated and observed rotation curves without\nnumerical integrations.\n", "  To measure the mass of foreground objects with weak gravitational lensing,\none needs to estimate the redshift distribution of lensed background sources.\nThis is commonly done in an empirical fashion, i.e. with a reference sample of\ngalaxies of known spectroscopic redshift, matched to the source population. In\nthis work, we develop a simple decision tree framework that, under the ideal\nconditions of a large, purely magnitude-limited reference sample, allows an\nunbiased recovery of the source redshift probability density function p(z), as\na function of magnitude and color. We use this framework to quantify biases in\nempirically estimated p(z) caused by selection effects present in realistic\nreference and weak lensing source catalogs, namely (1) complex selection of\nreference objects by the targeting strategy and success rate of existing\nspectroscopic surveys and (2) selection of background sources by the success of\nobject detection and shape measurement at low signal-to-noise. For\nintermediate-to-high redshift clusters, and for depths and filter combinations\nappropriate for ongoing lensing surveys, we find that (1) spectroscopic\nselection can cause biases above the 10 per cent level, which can be reduced to\n5 per cent by optimal lensing weighting, while (2) selection effects in the\nshape catalog bias mass estimates at or below the 2 per cent level. This\nillustrates the importance of completeness of the reference catalogs for\nempirical redshift estimation.\n", "  In this paper, we examine the cosmological dynamics of a slotheon field in a\nlinear potential. The slotheon correction term\n$\\frac{G^{\\mu\\nu}}{2M^2}\\pi_{;\\mu}\\pi_{;\\nu}$ respects the galileon symmetry in\ncurved space time. We demonstrate the future evolution of universe in this\nmodel. We show that in this scenario, the universe ends with the Big Crunch\nsingularity like the standard case. The difference being that the time at which\nthe singularity occurs is delayed in the slotheon gravity. The delay crucially\ndepends upon the strength of slotheon correction.\n", "  A precise description of neutrino-nucleus reactions will play a key role in\naddressing fundamental questions such as the leptonic CP violation and the\nneutrino mass hierarchy through analyzing data from next-generation neutrino\noscillation experiments. The neutrino energy relevant to the neutrino-nucleus\nreactions spans a broad range and, accordingly, the dominant reaction mechanism\nvaries across the energy region from quasi-elastic scattering through nucleon\nresonance excitations to deep inelastic scattering. This corresponds to\ntransitions of the effective degree of freedom for theoretical description from\nnucleons through meson-baryon to quarks. The main purpose of this review is to\nreport our recent efforts towards a unified description of the neutrino-nucleus\nreactions over the wide energy range; recent overall progress in the field is\nalso sketched. Starting with an overview of the current status of\nneutrino-nucleus scattering experiments, we formulate the cross section to be\ncommonly used for the reactions over all the energy regions. A description of\nthe neutrino-nucleon reactions follows and, in particular, a dynamical\ncoupled-channels model for meson productions in and beyond the $\\Delta$(1232)\nregion is discussed in detail. We then discuss the neutrino-nucleus reactions,\nputting emphasis on our theoretical approaches. We start the discussion with\nelectroweak processes in few-nucleon systems studied with the correlated\nGaussian method. Then we describe quasi-elastic scattering with nuclear\nspectral functions, and meson productions with a $\\Delta$-hole model. Nuclear\nmodifications of the parton distribution functions determined through a global\nanalysis are also discussed. Finally, we discuss issues to be addressed for\nfuture developments.\n", "  We describe and report the status of a neutrino-triggered program in IceCube\nthat generates real-time alerts for gamma-ray follow-up observations by\natmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes (MAGIC and VERITAS). While IceCube is capable\nof monitoring the whole sky continuously, high-energy gamma-ray telescopes have\nrestricted fields of view and in general are unlikely to be observing a\npotential neutrino-flaring source at the time such neutrinos are recorded. The\nuse of neutrino-triggered alerts thus aims at increasing the availability of\nsimultaneous multi-messenger data during potential neutrino flaring activity,\nwhich can increase the discovery potential and constrain the phenomenological\ninterpretation of the high-energy emission of selected source classes (e.g.\nblazars). The requirements of a fast and stable online analysis of potential\nneutrino signals and its operation are presented, along with first results of\nthe program operating between 14 March 2012 and 31 December 2015.\n", "  We expand the standard thermodynamic framework of a system coupled to a\nthermal reservoir by considering a stream of independently prepared units\nrepeatedly put into contact with the system. These units can be in any\nnonequilibrium state and interact with the system with an arbitrary strength\nand duration. We show that this stream constitutes an effective resource of\nnonequilibrium free energy and identify the conditions under which it behaves\nas a heat, work or information reservoir. We also show that this setup provides\na natural framework to analyze information erasure (\"Landauer's principle\") and\nfeedback controlled systems (\"Maxwell's demon\"). In the limit of a short\nsystem-unit interaction time, we further demonstrate that this setup can be\nused to provide a thermodynamically sound interpretation to many effective\nmaster equations. We discuss how non-autonomously driven systems, micromasers,\nlasing without inversion, and the electronic Maxwell demon, can be\nthermodynamically analyzed within our framework. While the present framework\naccounts for quantum features (e.g. squeezing, entanglement, coherence), we\nalso show that quantum resources do not offer any advantage compared to\nclassical ones in terms of the maximum extractable work.\n", "  We developed a six-band $k \\cdot p$ model that describes the electronic\nstates of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in $K$-valleys.\nThe set of parameters for the $k \\cdot p$ model is uniquely determined by\ndecomposing tight-binding (TB) models in the vicinity of $K^\\pm$-points. First,\nwe used TB models existing in literature to derive systematic parametrizations\nfor different materials, including MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$. Then,\nby using the derived six-band $k \\cdot p$ Hamiltonian we calculated effective\nmasses, Landau levels, and the effective exciton $g$-factor $g_{X^0}$ in\ndifferent TMDCs. We showed that TB parameterizations existing in literature\nresult in small absolute values of $g_{X^0}$, which are far from the\nexperimentally measured $g_{X^0} \\approx -4$. To further investigate this issue\nwe derived two additional sets of $k \\cdot p$ parameters by developing our own\nTB parameterizations based on simultaneous fitting of ab-initio calculated,\nwithin the density functional (DFT) and $GW$ approaches, energy dispersion and\nthe value of $g_{X^0}$. We showed that the change in TB parameters, which only\nslightly affects the dispersion of higher conduction and deep valence bands,\nmay result in a significant increase of $|g_{X^0}|$, yielding\nclose-to-experiment values of $g_{X^0}$. Such a high parameter sensitivity of\n$g_{X^0}$ opens a way to further improvement of DFT and TB models.\n", "  We introduce a probabilistic framework that represents stylized banking\nnetworks with the aim of predicting the size of contagion events. Most previous\nwork on random financial networks assumes independent connections between\nbanks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge\nprobabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We\nanalyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the\ncascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge\nprobabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition\nthat characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can\ngrow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number\n$R_0$ in epidemic modelling. The cascade condition provides an easily computed\nmeasure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.\nUsing the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic\nformula for the frequency of global cascades. Although the analytical methods\nare derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations\nthe applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. We show that\nedge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can\nhave a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade\ncondition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and\nwe propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the\ngraph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.\n", "  The capabilities of liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) to\nreconstruct the spatial and calorimetric information of neutrino events have\nmade them the detectors of choice in a number of experiments, specifically\nthose looking to observe electron neutrino ($\\nu_e$) appearance. The LArTPC\npromises excellent background rejection capabilities, especially in this\n\"golden\" channel for both short and long baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. We present the first experimental observation of electron\nneutrinos and anti-neutrinos in the ArgoNeut LArTPC, in the energy range\nrelevant to DUNE and the Fermilab Short Baseline Neutrino Program. We have\nselected 37 electron candidate events and 274 gamma candidate events, and\nmeasured an 80\\% purity of electrons based on a topological selection.\nAdditionally, we present a of separation of electrons from gammas using\ncalorimetric energy deposition, demonstrating further separation of electrons\nfrom background gammas.\n", "  A Lagrangian particle cloud model is proposed that accounts for the effects\nof Reynolds-averaged particle and turbulent stresses and the averaged\ncarrier-phase velocity of the sub-particle-cloud scale on the averaged motion\nand velocity of the cloud. The SPARSE (Subgrid Particle Average Reynolds Stress\nEquivalent) model is based on a combination of a truncated Taylor expansion of\na drag correction function and Reynolds averaging. It reduces the required\nnumber of computational parcels to trace a cloud of particles in\nEulerian-Lagrangian methods for the simulation of particle-laden flow. Closure\nis performed in an a priori manner using a reference simulation where all\nparticles in the cloud are traced individually with a point particle model.\nComparison of a first-order model and SPARSE with the reference simulation in\none-dimension shows that both the stress and the averaging of the carrier-phase\nvelocity on the cloud subscale affect the averaged motion of the particle. A\nthree-dimensional isotropic turbulence computation shows that only one\ncomputational parcel is sufficient to accurately trace a cloud of tens of\nthousand of particles.\n", "  We employ a recently developed mode-sum regularization method to compute the\nrenormalized stress-energy tensor of a quantum field in the Kerr background\nmetric (describing a stationary spinning black hole). More specifically, we\nconsider a minimally-coupled massless scalar field in the Unruh vacuum state,\nthe quantum state corresponding to an evaporating black hole. The computation\nis done here for the case $a=0.7M$, using two different variants of the method:\n$t$-splitting and $\\varphi$-splitting, yielding good agreement between the two\n(in the domain where both are applicable). We briefly discuss possible\nimplications of the results for computing semiclassical corrections to certain\nquantities, and also for simulating dynamical evaporation of a spinning black\nhole.\n", "  By means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we examine the\nquantum critical scaling of the magnetic excitation gap (the triplon gap) in a\nthree-dimensional dimerized quantum antiferromagnet, the bicubic lattice, and\nidentify characteristic multiplicative logarithmic scaling corrections atop the\nleading mean-field behavior. These findings are in accord with\nfield-theoretical predictions that are based on an effective description of the\nquantum critical system in terms of an asymptotically-free field theory, which\nexhibits a logarithmic decay of the renormalized interaction strength upon\napproaching the quantum critical point. Furthermore, using bond-based singlet\nspectroscopy, we identify the amplitude (Higgs) mode resonance within the\nantiferromagnetic region. We find a Higgs mass scaling in accord with\nfield-theoretical predictions that relate it by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ to the\ncorresponding triplon gap in the quantum disordered regime. In contrast to the\nsituation in lower-dimensional systems, we observe in this three-dimensional\ncoupled-dimer system a distinct signal from the amplitude mode also in the\ndynamical spin structure factor. The width of the Higgs mode resonance is\nobserved to scale linearly with the Higgs mass near criticality, indicative of\nthis critically well-defined excitation mode of the symmetry broken phase.\n", "  The amplitude (Higgs) mode is a ubiquitous collective excitation related to\nspontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry. We combine quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC) simulations with stochastic analytic continuation to investigate the\ndynamics of the amplitude mode in a three-dimensional dimerized quantum spin\nsystem. We characterize this mode by calculating the spin and dimer spectral\nfunctions near the quantum critical point, finding that both the energies and\nthe intrinsic widths satisfy field-theoretical scaling predictions. While the\nline width of the spin response is close to that observed in neutron scattering\nexperiments on TlCuCl$_3$, the dimer response is significantly broader. Our\nresults demonstrate that highly non-trivial dynamical properties are accessible\nby modern QMC and analytic continuation methods.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic study of 42\nBrightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) in two samples of galaxy clusters chosen for\na gravitational lensing study. The study's initial sample combines 25 BCGs from\nthe Cluster Lensing and Supernova Survey with Hubble (CLASH) sample and 37 BCGs\nfrom the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) with a total redshift range of 0.2 < z\n< 0.7. Using archival GALEX, Hubble Space Telescope, Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer, Herschel, and Very Large Array data we determine the BCGs' stellar\nmass, radio power, and star formation rates. The radio power is higher than\nexpected if due to star formation, consistent with the BCGs being active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN)-powered radio sources. This suggests that the AGN and\nstar formation are both fueled by cold gas in the host galaxy. The specific\nstar formation rate (sSFR) is low and constant with redshift. The mean sSFR is\n9.42 * 10^-12 yr^-1, which corresponds to a mass doubling time of 105 billion\nyears. These findings are consistent with models for hierarchical formation of\nBCGs, which suggest that star formation is no longer a significant channel for\ngalaxy growth for z < 1. Instead, stellar growth (of the order of a factor of\nat least two) during this period is expected to occur mainly via minor dry\nmergers\n", "  Spatially indirect excitons in semiconducting double quantum wells have been\nshown to exhibit rich collective many-body behavior that result from the nature\nof the extended dipole-dipole interactions between particles. For many\nspectroscopic studies of the emission from a system of such indirect excitons,\nit is crucial to separate the single particle properties of the excitons from\nthe many-body effects arising from their mutual interactions. In particular,\nknowledge of the relation between the emission energy of indirect excitons and\ntheir radiative lifetime could be highly beneficial for control, manipulation,\nand analysis of such systems. Here we study a simple analytic approximate\nrelation between the radiative lifetime of indirect excitons and their emission\nenergy. We show, both numerically and experimentally, the validity and the\nlimits of this approximate relation. This relation between the emission energy\nand the lifetime of indirect excitons can be used to tune and determine their\nlifetime and their resulting dynamics without the need of directly measuring\nit, and as a tool for design of indirect exciton based devices.\n", "  A powerful tool is developed for the characterization of chaotic signals. The\napproach is based on the symbolic encoding of time series (according to their\nordinal patterns) combined with the ensuing characterization of the\ncorresponding cylinder sets. Quantitative estimates of the Kolmogorov-Sinai\nentropy are obtained by introducing a modified permutation entropy which takes\ninto account the average width of the cylinder sets. The method works also in\nhyperchaotic systems and allows estimating the fractal dimension of the\nunderlying attractors.\n", "  We use a sample of 83 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations and a\nsemi-analytic model (SAM) to study the stochasticity of galaxy formation in\nhaloes ranging from dwarf to Milky Way masses. Our simulated galaxies reproduce\nthe observed inefficiency of galaxy formation as expressed through the stellar,\ngas and baryonic Tully-Fisher relations. For HI velocities in the range (70 < V\n< 220 km/s), the scatter is just 0.08 to 0.14 dex, consistent with the observed\nintrinsic scatter at these scales. At low velocities (20 < V < 70 km/s), the\nsimulated scatter is 0.2-0.25 dex, which could be tested with future\nobservations. The scatter in the stellar mass versus dark halo velocity\nrelation is constant for 30 < V < 180 km/s, and smaller (~0.17 dex) when using\nthe maximum circular velocity of the dark matter only simulation, Vmax,\ncompared to the virial velocity ($V_{200}$ or $V_{200}^{DMO}$). The scatter in\nstellar mass is correlated with halo concentration, and is minimized when using\na circular velocity at a fixed fraction of the virial radius $\\simeq 0.4\nR_{200}$ or with $V_{\\alpha}=V_{200}^{DMO} (V_{max}^{DMO} /\nV_{200}^{DMO})^\\alpha$ with \\alpha ~ 0.7, consistent with constraints from halo\nclustering. Using the SAM we show the correlation between halo formation time\nand concentration is essential in order to reproduce this result. This\nuniformity in galaxy formation efficiency we see in our hydrodynamical\nsimulations and a semi-analytic model proves the simplicity and self-regulating\nnature of galaxy formation in a \\Lambda Cold Dark Matter universe.\n", "  We studied the leading area term of the entanglement entropy of\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric $O(N)$ vector model in $2+1$ dimensions close to\nthe line of second order phase transition in the large $N$ limit. We found that\nthe area term is independent of the varying interaction coupling along the\ncritical line, unlike what is expected in a perturbative theory. Along the way,\nwe studied non-commuting limits $n-1\\to 0$ verses UV cutoff $r\\to 0$ when\nevaluating the gap equation and found a match only when appropriate counter\nterm is introduced and whose coupling is chosen to take its fixed point value.\nAs a bonus, we also studied Fermionic Green's functions in the conical\nbackground. We made the observation of a map between the problem and the\nrelativistic hydrogen atom.\n", "  We report the results of searches for solar axions and galactic dark matter\naxions or axion-like particles with CDEX-1 experiment at the China Jinping\nUnderground Laboratory, using 335.6 kg-days of data from a p-type point-contact\ngermanium detector. The data are compatible with the background model and no\nexcess signals are observed. Limits of solar axions on the model independent\ncoupling $g_{Ae}<2.5\\times10^{-11}$ from Compton, bremsstrahlung,\natomic-recombination and deexcitation channel and $g^{\\text{eff}}_{AN}\\times\ng_{Ae}<6.1\\times10^{-17}$ from $^{57}$Fe M1 transition at 90 % confidence level\nare derived. Within the framework of the DFSZ and KSVZ models, our results\nexclude the axion mass heavier than 0.9 eV/c$^{2}$ and 173 eV/c$^{2}$,\nrespectively. The derived constraints for dark matter axions below 1 keV\nimproves over the previous results.\n", "  Anisotropy in the speed of light that has been constrained by\nMichelson-Morley-type experiments also generates anisotropy in the Coulomb\ninteractions. This anisotropy can manifest itself as an energy anisotropy in\nnuclear and atomic experiments. Here the experimental limits on Lorentz\nviolation in 21Ne are used to improve the limits on the Lorentz symmetry in the\nphoton sector, namely the anisotropy of the speed of light and the Coulomb\ninteractions, by 7 orders of magnitude in comparison with previous experiments:\nthe speed of light is isotropic to a part in E-28.\n", "  By means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering at the Cu L$_3$ edge, we\nmeasured the spin wave dispersion along $\\langle$100$\\rangle$ and\n$\\langle$110$\\rangle$ in the undoped cuprate Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$. The data\nyields a reliable estimate of the superexchange parameter $J$ = 135 $\\pm$ 4 meV\nusing a classical spin-1/2 2D Heisenberg model with nearest-neighbor\ninteractions and including quantum fluctuations. Including further exchange\ninteractions increases the estimate to $J$ = 141 meV. The 40 meV dispersion\nbetween the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary points (1/2,\\,0) and (1/4,\\,1/4)\nindicates that next-nearest neighbor interactions in this compound are\nintermediate between the values found in La$_{2}$CuO$_4$ and\nSr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$. Owing to the low-$Z$ elements composing\nCa$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$, the present results may enable a reliable comparison with\nthe predictions of quantum many-body calculations, which would improve our\nunderstanding of the role of magnetic excitations and of electronic\ncorrelations in cuprates.\n", "  This paper presents a full-spectrum Green function methodology (which is\nvalid, in particular, at and around Wood-anomaly frequencies) for evaluation of\nscattering by periodic arrays of cylinders of arbitrary cross section-with\napplication to wire gratings, particle arrays and reflectarrays and, indeed,\ngeneral arrays of conducting or dielectric bounded obstacles under both TE and\nTM polarized illumination. The proposed method, which, for definiteness is\ndemonstrated here for arrays of perfectly conducting particles under TE\npolarization, is based on use of the shifted Green-function method introduced\nin the recent contribution (Bruno and Delourme, Jour. Computat. Phys. pp.\n262--290 (2014)). A certain infinite term arises at Wood anomalies for the\ncylinder-array problems considered here that is not present in the previous\nrough-surface case. As shown in this paper, these infinite terms can be treated\nvia an application of ideas related to the Woodbury-Sherman-Morrison formulae.\nThe resulting approach, which is applicable to general arrays of obstacles even\nat and around Wood-anomaly frequencies, exhibits fast convergence and high\naccuracies. For example, a few hundreds of milliseconds suffice for the\nproposed approach to evaluate solutions throughout the resonance region\n(wavelengths comparable to the period and cylinder sizes) with full\nsingle-precision accuracy.\n", "  Various classical models of electrons including their spin degrees of freedom\nare commonly applied to describe the electron dynamics in strong\nelectromagnetic fields. We demonstrate that different models can lead to\ndifferent or even contradicting predictions regarding how the spin degree of\nfreedom modifies the electron's orbital motion when the electron moves in\nstrong electromagnetic fields. This discrepancy is rooted in the model-specific\nenergy dependency of the spin-induced Stern-Gerlach force acting on the\nelectron. The Frenkel model and the classical Foldy-Wouthuysen model are\ncompared exemplarily in the nonrelativistic and the relativistic limits in\norder to identify parameter regimes where these classical models make different\npredictions. This allows for experimental tests of these models. In ultrastrong\nlaser setups in parameter regimes where effects of the Stern-Gerlach force\nbecome relevant, radiation-reaction effects are also expected to set in. We\nincorporate the radiation reaction classically via the Landau-Lifshitz equation\nand demonstrate that although radiation-reaction effects can have a significant\neffect on the electron trajectory, the Frenkel model and the classical\nFoldy-Wouthuysen model remain distinguishable also if radiation-reaction\neffects are taken into account. Our calculations are also suitable to verify\nthe Landau-Lifshitz equation for the radiation reaction of electrons and other\nspin-1/2 particles.\n", "  We identify six ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) outside clusters in three\nnearby isolated groups (z<0.026) using very deep imaging in three different\nSDSS filters (g, r and i bands) from the IAC Stripe82 Legacy Project. By\ncomparing with the abundance of UDGs in rich galaxy clusters, we find that the\ndensity of UDGs (i.e. their number per unit mass of the host structure where\nthey are located) decreases towards the most massive systems. This is\ncompatible with a scenario where UDGs are formed preferentially outside\nclusters. In the periphery (D>250 kpc) of our three groups, we identify a\npopulation of potential UDG progenitors (two of them confirmed\nspectroscopically). These progenitors have similar masses, shapes and sizes but\nare bluer, g-i~0.45, (and for this reason brighter, mu_g(0)<24 mag arcsec -2)\nthan traditional UDGs (g-i~0.76). A passive evolution of these progenitors will\ntransform them into regular (i.e. mu_g(0)>24 mag arcsec -2) UDGs after ~6 Gyr.\nIf confirmed, our observations support a scenario where UDGs are old, extended,\nlow surface brightness dwarfs (M*~10^8 Msun) galaxies born in the field, are\nlater on processed in groups and, ultimately, infall into galaxy clusters by\ngroup accretion.\n", "  We consider a vector-like gauge theory of fermions that confines at the\nmulti-TeV scale, and that realizes the Higgs particle as a composite Goldstone\nboson. The weak interactions are embedded in the unbroken subgroup $Sp(4)$ of a\nspontaneously broken $SU(4)$ flavour group. The meson resonances appear as\npoles in the two-point correlators of fermion bilinears, and include the\nGoldstone bosons plus a massive pseudoscalar $\\eta'$, as well as scalars,\nvectors and axial vectors. We compute the mass spectrum of these mesons, as\nwell as their decay constants, in the chiral limit, in the approximation where\nthe hypercolour $Sp(2N)$ dynamics is described by four-fermion operators, \\`a\nla Nambu-Jona Lasinio. By resumming the leading diagrams in the $1/N$\nexpansion, we find that the spin-one states lie beyond the LHC reach, while\nspin-zero electroweak-singlet states may be as light as the Goldstone-boson\ndecay constant, $f\\sim 1$ TeV. We also confront our results with a set of\navailable spectral sum rules. In order to supply composite top-quark partners,\nthe theory contains additional fermions carrying both hypercolour and ordinary\ncolour, with an associated flavour symmetry-breaking pattern $SU(6)/SO(6)$. We\nidentify and analyse several non-trivial features of the complete two-sector\ngauge theory: the 't~Hooft anomaly matching conditions; the higher-dimension\noperator which incorporates the effects of the hypercolour axial-singlet\nanomaly; the coupled mass-gap equations; the mixing between the singlet mesons\nof the two sectors, resulting in an extra Goldstone boson $\\eta_0$, and novel\nspectral sum rules. Assuming that the strength of the four-fermion interaction\nis the same in the two sectors, we find that the coloured vector and scalar\nmesons have masses $\\gtrsim 4 f$, while the masses of coloured pseudo-Goldstone\nbosons, induced by gluon loops, are $\\gtrsim 1.5f$.\n", "  We study the morphologies of core collapse supernova remnants (CCSNRs) and\nfind that about third of CCSNRs in our sample have two opposite `ears'\nprotruding from their main shell. We assume that the ears are formed by jets,\nand argue that these properties are compatible with the expectation from the\nexplosion jet feedback mechanism (JFM). Based on previous studies of ears in\nCCSNRs and the similarity of some ears to those found in planetary nebulae, we\nassume that the ears are inflated by jets that are launched during the\nexplosion, or a short time after it. Under simple geometrical assumptions we\nfind that the extra kinetic energy of the ears is in the range of 1 to 10\npercents of the explosion energy. As not all of the kinetic energy of the jets\nends in the ears, we estimate that the typical kinetic energy in the jets that\ninflated the ears, under our assumptions, is about 5 to 15 percents of the\nexplosion energy. This study supports a serious consideration of jet-driven\ncore-collapse supernova mechanisms.\n", "  We study the low-frequency polarization response of a surface-charged oblate\nspheroidal particle immersed in an electrolyte solution. Because the charged\nspheroid attracts counter-ions which form the electric double layer around the\nparticle, using usual boundary conditions at the interface between the particle\nand electrolyte can be quite complicated and challenging. Hence, we generalize\nFixman's boundary conditions, originally derived for spherical particles, to\nthe case of the charged oblate spheroid. Given two different counter-ion\ndistributions in the thin electric double layer limit, we obtain analytic\nexpressions for the polarization coefficients to the first non-trivial order in\nfrequency. We find that the polarization response normal to the symmetry axis\ndepends on the total amount of charge carried by the oblate spheroid while that\nparallel to the symmetry axis is suppressed when there is less charge on the\nedge of the spheroid. We further study the overall dielectric response for a\ndilute suspension of charged spheroids. We find that the dielectric enhancement\nat low frequency, which is driven by the presence of a large $\\zeta$-potential\n(surface charge), is suppressed by high ion concentrations in the electrolyte\nand depends on the size of the suspended particles. In addition, spheroids with\nhigher aspect ratios will also lead to a stronger dielectric enhancement due to\nthe combination of the electric double layer and textural effects. The\ncharacteristic frequency associated with the dielectric enhancement scales\ninversely with the square of the particle size, the major radius of the\nspheroid, and it has a weak dependence on the shape of spheroids.\n", "  We present a detailed discussion of how to obtain precise stellar photometry\nin crowded fields using images from multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO)\nsystems, with the intent of informing the scientific development of this key\ntechnology for the Extremely Large Telescopes. We use deep J and K_s exposures\nof NGC 1851 taken with the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS)\non Gemini South to quantify the performance of the instrument and to develop an\noptimal strategy for stellar photometry using PSF-fitting techniques. We judge\nthe success of the various methods we employ by using science-based metrics,\nparticularly the width of the main sequence turn-off region. We also compare\nthe GeMS photometry with the exquisite HST data in the visible of the same\ntarget. We show that the PSF produced by GeMS possesses significant spatial and\ntemporal variability that must be accounted for during the analysis. We show\nthat the majority of the variation of the PSF occurs within the \"control\nradius\" of the MCAO system and that the best photometry is obtained when the\nPSF radius is chosen to closely match this spatial scale. We identify\nphotometric calibration as a critical issue for next generation MCAO systems\nsuch as those on TMT and E-ELT. Our final CMDs reach K_s~22---below the main\nsequence knee---making it one of the deepest for a globular cluster available\nfrom the ground. Theoretical isochrones are in remarkable agreement with the\nstellar locus in our data from below the main sequence knee to the upper red\ngiant branch.\n", "  The gravitationally lensed quasar APM 08279+5255 has the fastest claimed wind\nfrom any AGN, with velocities of 0.6-0.7c, requiring magnetic acceleration as\nspecial relativisitic effects limit all radiatively driven winds to v<0.3-0.5c.\nHowever, this extreme velocity derives from interpreting both the narrow and\nbroad absorption features in the X-ray spectrum as iron absorption lines. The\nclassic ultrafast outflow source PDS 456 also shows similar absorption systems,\nbut here the higher energy, broader feature is generally interpreted as an\nabsorption edge. We reanalyse all the spectra from APM 08279+5255 using a full\n3-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer disc wind model for the ionised\nwind at 0.1-0.2c, together with complex absorption from lower ionisation\nmaterial, and find that this is a better description of the data. Thus there is\nno strong requirement for outflow velocities beyond 0.2c, which can be powered\nby radiation driving. We show that UV line driving is especially likely given\nthe spectral energy distribution of this source which is intrinsically UV\nbright and X-ray weak. While the peak of this emission is unobservable, it must\nbe luminous enough to power the observed hot dust, favouring at least moderate\nblack hole spin.\n", "  In this paper, we propose an improved model-independent method to constrain\nthe cosmic curvature by combining the most recent Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and\nsupernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data. Based on the $H(z)$ data, we first use the\nmodel-independent smoothing technique, Gaussian processes, to construct\ndistance modulus $\\mu_{H}(z)$, which is susceptible to the cosmic curvature\nparameter $\\Omega_{k}$. In contrary to previous studies, the light-curve\nfitting parameters, which account for distance estimation of SN\n($\\mu_{SN}(z)$), are set free to investigate whether $\\Omega_{k}$ has a\ndependence on them. By comparing $\\mu_{H}(z)$ to $\\mu_{SN}(z)$, we put limits\non $\\Omega_{k}$. Our results confirm that $\\Omega_{k}$ is independent of the SN\nlight-curve parameters. Moreover, we show that the measured $\\Omega_{k}$ is in\ngood agreement with zero cosmic curvature, implying that there is no\nsignificant deviation from a flat Universe at the current observational data\nlevel. We also test the influence of different $H(z)$ samples and different\nHubble constant $H_{0}$ values, finding that different $H(z)$ samples do not\npresent significant impact on the constraints. However, different $H_{0}$\npriors can affect the constraints of $\\Omega_{k}$ in some degree. The prior of\n$H_{0}=73.24\\pm1.74$ km $\\rm s^{-1}$ $\\rm Mpc^{-1}$ gives a value of\n$\\Omega_{k}$ a little bit above $1\\sigma$ confidence level away from 0, but\n$H_{0}=69.6\\pm0.7$ km $\\rm s^{-1}$ $\\rm Mpc^{-1}$ gives it below $1\\sigma$.\n", "  Communication complexity problems (CCPs) are tasks in which separated parties\nattempt to compute a function whose inputs are distributed among the parties.\nTheir communication is limited so that not all inputs can be sent. We show that\nbroad classes of Bell inequalities can be mapped to CCPs and that a quantum\nviolation of a Bell inequality is a necessary and sufficient condition for an\nenhancement of the related CCP beyond its classical limitation. However, one\ncan implement CCPs by transmitting a quantum system, encoding no more\ninformation than is allowed in the CCP, and extract information by performing\nmeasurements. We show that for a large class of Bell inequalities, the\nimprovement of the CCP associated to a quantum violation of a Bell inequality\ncan be no greater than the improvement obtained from quantum\nprepare-transmit-measure strategies.\n", "  We calculate the prominent perturbative contributions shaping the one-loop\nscalar spectrum of the minimal non-supersymmetric renormalizable $SO(10)$ Higgs\nmodel whose unified gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken by an adjoint\nscalar. Focusing on its potentially realistic $45\\oplus 126$ variant in which\nthe rank is reduced by a VEV of the 5-index self-dual antisymmetric tensor, we\nprovide a thorough analysis of the corresponding one-loop Coleman-Weinberg\npotential, paying particular attention to the masses of the potentially\ntachyonic pseudo-Goldstone bosons (PGBs) transforming as $(8,1,0)$ and\n$(1,3,0)$ under the Standard Model gauge group. The results confirm the assumed\nexistence of extended regions in the parameter space supporting a locally\nstable SM-like quantum vacuum inaccessible at the tree-level. The effective\npotential (EP) tedium is compared to that encountered in the previously studied\n$45\\oplus 16$ $SO(10)$ Higgs model where the polynomial corrections to the\nrelevant pseudo-Goldstone masses turn out to be easily calculable within a very\nsimplified purely diagrammatic approach.\n", "  5-Bromouracil is a nucleobase analogue that can replace thymine in DNA\nstrands and acts as a strong radiosensitizer, with potential applications in\nmolecular biology and cancer therapy. Here, the deactivation of 5-bromouracil\nafter UV irradiation is investigated in the singlet and triplet manifold by\naccurate quantum chemistry calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.\nIt is found that after irradiation to the bright 1pipi* state, three main\nrelaxation pathways are in principle possible: relaxation back to the ground\nstate, intersystem crossing, and C-Br photodissociation. Based on accurate\nMS-CASPT2 optimizations, we propose that ground state relaxation should be the\npredominant deactivation pathway in gas phase. We then employ different\nelectronic structure methods to assess their suitability to carry out\nexcited-state dynamics simulations. MRCIS was used in surface hopping\nsimulations to compute the ultrafast intersystem crossing dynamics, which\nmostly involves the 1nOpi* and 3pipi* states.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions of plasma from the\nSun that play an important role in space weather. Faraday rotation (FR) is the\nrotation of the plane of polarization that results when a linearly polarized\nsignal passes through a magnetized plasma such as a CME. FR observations of a\nsource near the Sun can provide information on the plasma structure of a CME\nshortly after launch.\n  We report on simultaneous white-light and radio observations made of three\nCMEs in August 2012. We made sensitive Very Large Array (VLA) full-polarization\nobservations using 1 - 2 GHz frequencies of a \"constellation\" of radio sources\nthrough the solar corona at heliocentric distances that ranged from 6 - 15\nsolar radii. Of the nine sources observed, three were occulted by CMEs: two\nsources (0842+1835 and 0900+1832) were occulted by a single CME and one source\n(0843+1547) was occulted by two CMEs. In addition to our radioastronomical\nobservations, which represent one of the first active hunts for CME Faraday\nrotation since Bird et al. (1985) and the first active hunt using the VLA, we\nobtained white-light coronagraph images from the LASCO/C3 instrument to\ndetermine the Thomson scattering brightness, BT, providing a means to\nindependently estimate the plasma density and determine its contribution to the\nobserved Faraday rotation.\n  A constant density force-free flux rope embedded in the background corona was\nused to model the effects of the CMEs on BT and FR. We demonstrate this model's\nability to successfully reproduce both BT and FR profiles. The plasma densities\n(6 - 22 x 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) and axial magnetic field strengths (2 - 12 mG)\ninferred from our models are consistent with the modeling work of Liu et al.\n(2007) and Jensen & Russell (2008), as well as previous CME FR observations by\nBird et al. (1985).\n", "  We consider a disk-shaped thin elastic sheet bonded to a compliant sphere.\n(Our sheet can slip along the sphere; the bonding controls only its normal\ndisplacement.) If the bonding is stiff (but not too stiff), the geometry of the\nsphere makes the sheet wrinkle to avoid azimuthal compression. The total energy\nof this system is the elastic energy of the sheet plus a (Winkler-type)\nsubstrate energy. Treating the thickness of the sheet $h$ as a small parameter,\nwe determine the leading-order behavior of the energy as $h$ tends to zero, and\ngive (almost matching) upper and lower bounds for the next-order correction.\nOur analysis of the leading-order behavior determines the macroscopic\ndeformation of the sheet; in particular it determines the extent of the\nwrinkled region, and predicts the (nontrivial) radial strain of the sheet. The\nleading-order behavior also provides insight about the length scale of the\nwrinkling, showing that it must be approximately independent of the distance\n$r$ from the center of the sheet (so that the number of wrinkles must increase\nwith $r$). Our results on the next-order correction provide insight about how\nthe wrinkling pattern should vary with $r$. Roughly speaking, they suggest that\nthe length scale of wrinkling should {\\it not} be exactly constant -- rather,\nit should vary a bit, so that the number of wrinkles at radius $r$ can be\napproximately piecewise constant in its dependence on $r$, taking values that\nare integer multiples of $h^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\approx 1/2$.\n", "  The topological Haldane model (THM) on a honeycomb lattice is a prototype of\nsystems hosting topological phases of matter without external fields. It is the\nsimplest model exhibiting the quantum Hall effect without Landau levels, which\nmotivated theoretical and experimental explorations of topological insulators\nand superconductors. Despite its simplicity, its realization in condensed\nmatter systems has been elusive due to a seemingly difficult condition of\nspinless fermions with sublattice-dependent magnetic flux terms. While there\nhave been theoretical proposals including elaborate atomic-scale engineering,\nidentifying candidate THM materials has not been successful, and the first\nexperimental realization was recently made in ultracold atoms. Here we suggest\nthat a series of Fe-based honeycomb ferromagnetic insulators, AFe2(PO4)2\n(A=Ba,Cs,K,La) possess Chern bands described by the THM. How to detect the\nquantum anomalous Hall effect is also discussed.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive study of the X-ray emission from 70 transient\nsources which have been classified as a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the\nliterature. We explore the properties of these candidates using nearly three\ndecades of X-ray observations to quantify the properties and characteristics of\nX-ray TDEs observationally. We find that the emission from X-ray TDEs increase\nby two to four orders of magnitude compared to pre-flare constraints, which\nevolves significantly with time and decays with powerlaw indices that are\ntypically shallower than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay law, implying that\nX-ray TDEs are viscously delayed. These events exhibit enhanced column\ndensities relative to Galactic and are quite soft in nature, with no strong\ncorrelation between the amount of detected soft and hard emission. At peak,\njetted events have an X-ray to optical ratio $\\gg$1, while non-jetted events\nhave a ratio $\\sim$1, which suggests that these events undergo reprocessing at\ndifferent rates. X-ray TDEs have long $T_{90}$ values consistent with that\nexpected from a viscously-driven accretion disk formed by the disruption of a\nmain-sequence star by a black hole with a mass $<$$10^{7}M_{\\odot}$. The\nisotropic luminosities of X-ray TDEs is bimodal such that jetted and non-jetted\nevents are separated by a \"reprocessing valley\" which we suggest is naturally\npopulated by optical/UV TDEs that most likely produce X-rays, but due to\nreprocessing this emission is \"veiled\" from observations. Our results suggest\nthat non-jetted X-ray TDEs likely originate from partial disruptions and/or\ndisruptions of low mass stars.\n", "  The recently proposed complexity-action conjecture allows one to calculate\nhow fast one can produce a quantum state from a reference state in terms of the\non-shell action of the dual AdS black hole at the Wheeler-DeWitt patch. We show\nthat the action growth rate is given by the difference of the generalized\nenthalpy between the two corresponding horizons. The proof relies on the second\nidentity that the surface-term contribution on a horizon is given by the\nproduct of the associated temperature and entropy.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of dark matter subhaloes\nin the cosmological Bolshoi simulation. We identify a complete set of 12 unique\nevolution channels by which subhaloes evolve in between simulation outputs, and\nstudy their relative importance and demographics. We show that instantaneous\nmasses and maximum circular velocities of individual subhaloes are extremely\nnoisy, despite the use of a sophisticated, phase-space-based halo finder. We\nalso show that subhaloes experience frequent penetrating encounters with other\nsubhaloes (on average about one per dynamical time), and that subhaloes whose\napo-center lies outside the virial radius of their host (the 'ejected' or\n'backsplash' haloes) experience tidal forces that modify their orbits. This\nresults in an average fractional subhalo exchange rate among host haloes of\nroughly 0.01 per Gyr (at the present time). In addition, we show that there are\nthree distinct disruption channels; one in which subhaloes drop below the mass\nresolution limit of the simulation, one in which subhaloes merge with their\nhost halo largely driven by dynamical friction, and one in which subhaloes\nabruptly disintegrate. We estimate that roughly 80 percent of all subhalo\ndisruption in the Bolshoi simulation is numerical, rather than physical. This\nover-merging is a serious road-block for the use of numerical simulations to\ninterpret small scale clustering, or for any other study that is sensitive to\nthe detailed demographics of dark matter substructure.\n", "  We study a holographic theory of general spacetimes that does not rely on the\nexistence of asymptotic regions. This theory is to be formulated in a\nholographic space. When a semiclassical description is applicable, the\nholographic space is assumed to be a holographic screen: a codimension-1\nsurface that is capable of encoding states of the gravitational spacetime. Our\nanalysis is guided by conjectured relationships between gravitational spacetime\nand quantum entanglement in the holographic description. To understand basic\nfeatures of this picture, we catalog predictions for the holographic\nentanglement structure of cosmological spacetimes. We find that qualitative\nfeatures of holographic entanglement entropies for such spacetimes differ from\nthose in AdS/CFT but that the former reduce to the latter in the appropriate\nlimit. The Hilbert space of the theory is analyzed, and two plausible\nstructures are found: a direct sum and \"spacetime equals entanglement\"\nstructure. The former preserves a naive relationship between linear operators\nand observable quantities, while the latter respects a more direct connection\nbetween holographic entanglement and spacetime. We also discuss the issue of\nselecting a state in quantum gravity, in particular how the state of the\nmultiverse may be selected in the landscape.\n", "  In the present letter we indicate an extension of the pure gravity inverse\nscattering integration technique to the case when fermions (introduced on the\nbase of supersymmetry) are present. In this way the integrability technique for\nsimple ($N=1$) supergravity in two space-time dimensions coupled to the matter\nfields taking values in the Lie algebra of $E_{8\\left( +8\\right) }$ group is\ndeveloped. This theory contains matter living only in one Weyl representation\nof $SO\\left( 16\\right) $ and represents the reduction to two dimensions of the\nthree-dimensional simple supergravity constructed in [1].\n  Our spectral linear problem use superspace and covers the complete set of\nprincipal bosonic and fermionic equations of motion. This linear system, as in\npure gravity, contains only the first order poles with respect to the spectral\nparameter. The procedure of constructing the exact super-solitonic solutions is\noutlined.\n", "  Stars on orbits with pericenters sufficiently close to the supermassive black\nhole at the center of their host galaxy can be ripped apart by tidal stresses.\nSome of the resulting stellar debris becomes more tightly bound to the hole and\ncan potentially produce an observable flare called a tidal-disruption event\n(TDE). We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning\n(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general\nrelativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the\nloss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates\ndecrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but\nthis effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the\nstronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure\nthat translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us\nto better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal\ndisruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce\nmore tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with\nthe same angular momentum. However, for deep encounters leading to full\ndisruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that\nthe star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is\ntherefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion\nrate. We also examine the capture of tidal debris by the horizon and the\nrelativistic pericenter precession of tidal debris, finding that black holes of\n$10^6$ solar masses and above generate tidal debris precessing by $10^\\circ$ or\nmore per orbit.\n", "  We present direct detection constraints on the absorption of hidden-photon\ndark matter with particle masses in the range 1.2-30 eV$c^{-2}$ with the DAMIC\nexperiment at SNOLAB. Under the assumption that the local dark matter is\nentirely constituted of hidden photons, the sensitivity to the kinetic mixing\nparameter $\\kappa$ is competitive with constraints from solar emission,\nreaching a minimum value of 2.2$\\times$$10^{-14}$ at 17 eV$c^{-2}$. These\nresults are the most stringent direct detection constraints on hidden-photon\ndark matter in the galactic halo with masses 3-12 eV$c^{-2}$ and the first\ndemonstration of direct experimental sensitivity to ionization signals $<$12 eV\nfrom dark matter interactions.\n", "  The electrochemical gating technique is a powerful tool to tune the\n\\textit{surface} electronic conduction properties of various materials by means\nof pure charge doping, but its efficiency is thought to be hampered in\nmaterials with a good electronic screening. We show that, if applied to a\nmetallic superconductor (NbN thin films), this approach allows observing\nreversible enhancements or suppressions of the \\emph{bulk} superconducting\ntransition temperature, which vary with the thickness of the films. These\nresults are interpreted in terms of proximity effect, and indicate that the\neffective screening length depends on the induced charge density, becoming much\nlarger than that predicted by standard screening theory at very high electric\nfields.\n", "  We use the coupled cluster method to study the zero-temperature quantum phase\ndiagram of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $J_{1}$--$J_{2}$--$J_{1}^{\\perp}$ model on\nthe honeycomb bilayer lattice. In each layer we include both nearest-neighbor\nand frustrating next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, of\nstrength $J_{1}>0$ and $J_{2} \\equiv \\kappa J_{1} > 0$, respectively. The two\nlayers are coupled by an interlayer nearest-neighbor exchange, with coupling\nconstant $J_{1}^{\\perp} \\equiv \\delta J_{1}>0$. We calculate directly in the\ninfinite-lattice limit both the ground-state energy per spin and the N\\'{e}el\nmagnetic order parameter, as well as the triplet spin gap. By implementing the\nmethod to very high orders of approximation we obtain an accurate estimate for\nthe full boundary of the N\\'{e}el phase in the $\\kappa\\delta$ plane. For each\nvalue $\\delta < \\delta_{c}^{>}(0) \\approx 1.70(5)$ we find an upper critical\nvalue $\\kappa_{c}(\\delta)$, such that N\\'{e}el order is present for $\\kappa <\n\\kappa_{c}(\\delta)$. Conversely, for each value $\\kappa < \\kappa_{c}(0) \\approx\n0.19(1)$ we find an upper critical value $\\delta_{c}^{>}(\\kappa)$, such that\nN\\'{e}el order persists for $0 < \\delta < \\delta_{c}^{>}(\\kappa)$. Most\ninterestingly, for values of $\\kappa$ in the range $\\kappa_{c}(0) < \\kappa <\n\\kappa^{>} \\approx 0.215(2)$ we find a reentrant behavior such that N\\'{e}el\norder exists only in the range $\\delta_{c}^{<}(\\kappa) < \\delta <\n\\delta_{c}^{>}(\\kappa)$, with $\\delta_{c}^{<}(\\kappa)>0$. These latter upper\nand lower critical values coalesce when $\\kappa = \\kappa^{>}$, such that\n$\\delta_{c}^{<}(\\kappa^{>}) = \\delta_{c}^{>}(\\kappa^{>}) \\approx 0.25(5)$.\n", "  The formalism of complex networks is extensively employed to describe the\ndynamics of interacting agents in several applications. The features of the\nconnections among the nodes in a network are not always provided beforehand,\nhence the problem of appropriately inferring them often arises. Here, we\npresent a method to reconstruct directed and weighted topologies (REDRAW) of\nnetworks of heterogeneous phase-locked nonlinear oscillators. We ultimately\nplan on using REDRAW to infer the interaction structure in human ensembles\nengaged in coordination tasks, and give insights into the overall behavior.\n", "  We introduce MINFLUX, a concept for localizing photon emitters in space. By\nprobing the emitter with a local intensity minimum of excitation light, MINFLUX\nminimizes the fluorescence photons needed for high localization precision. A\n22-fold reduction of photon detections over that required in popular\ncentroid-localization is demonstrated. In superresolution microscopy, MINFLUX\nattained ~1 nm precision, resolving molecules only 6 nm apart. Tracking single\nfluorescent proteins by MINFLUX increased the temporal resolution and the\nlocalizations per trace by 100-fold, as demonstrated with diffusing 30S\nribosomal subunits in living E. coli. Since conceptual limits have not been\nreached, we expect this localization modality to break new ground for observing\nthe dynamics, distribution, and structure of macromolecules in living cells and\nbeyond.\n", "  The relaxation properties of dielectric materials are described, in the\nfrequency domain, according to one of the several models proposed over the\nyears: Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts, Cole-Cole, Cole-Davidson, Havriliak-Negami\n(with its modified version) and Excess wing model are among the most famous.\nTheir description in the time domain involves some mathematical functions whose\nknowledge is of fundamental importance for a full understanding of the models.\nIn this work, we survey the main dielectric models and we illustrate the\ncorresponding time-domain functions. In particular, we stress the attention on\nthe completely monotone character of the relaxation and response functions. We\nalso provide a characterization of the models in terms of differential\noperators of fractional order.\n", "  We discuss a minimal holographic model for the description of heavy-light and\nlight mesons with chiral symmetry, defined in a slab of AdS space. The model\nconsists of a pair of chiral Yang-Mills and tachyon fields with specific\nboundary conditions that break spontaneously chiral symmetry in the infrared.\nThe heavy-light spectrum and decay constants are evaluated explicitly. In the\nheavy mass limit the model exhibits both heavy-quark and chiral symmetry and\nallows for the explicit derivation of the one-pion axial couplings to the\nheavy-light mesons.\n", "  In this work we outline a simple and numerically inexpensive approach to\ndescribe the spectral features of the single-impurity Anderson model. The\nmethod combines aspects of the density matrix embedding theory (DMET) approach\nwith a spectral broadening approach inspired by those used in numerical\nrenormalization group (NRG) methods. At zero temperature for a wide range of U\n, the spectral function produced by this approach is found to be in good\nagreement with general expectations as well as more advanced and complex\nnumerical methods such as DMRG-based schemes. The theory developed here is\nsimply transferable to more complex impurity problems.\n", "  We present an analysis of the relationship between the CO-H$_{2}$ conversion\nfactor ($\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$) and total mass surface density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm tot}$)\nin star-forming galaxies at $z < 1.5$. Our sample, which is drawn from the IRAM\nPlateau de Bure HIgh-$z$ Blue Sequence Survey (PHIBSS) and the CO Legacy\nDatabase for GASS (COLD GASS), includes 'normal,' massive star-forming galaxies\nthat dominate the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) at this\nepoch and probe the $\\Sigma_{\\rm tot}$ regime where the strongest variation in\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ is observed. We constrain $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ via existing CO\nobservations, measurements of the star formation rate, and an assumed molecular\ngas depletion time ($t_{\\rm dep}$=$M_{\\rm gas}$/SFR) --- the latter two of\nwhich establish the total molecular gas mass independent of the observed CO\nluminosity. For a broad range of adopted depletion times, we find that\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ is independent of total mass surface density, with little\ndeviation from the canonical Milky Way value. This runs contrary to a scenario\nin which $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ decreases as surface density increases within the\nextended clouds of molecular gas that potentially fuel clumps of star formation\nin $z\\sim1$ galaxies, similar to those observed in local ULIRGs. Instead, our\nresults suggest that molecular gas, both at $z\\sim0$ and $z\\sim1$, is primarily\nin the form of self-gravitating molecular clouds. While CO observations suggest\na factor of $\\sim3$ reduction in the average molecular gas depletion time\nbetween $z \\sim 0$ and $z\\sim1$, we find that, for typical galaxies, the\nstructure of molecular gas and the process of star formation at $z \\sim 1$ is\notherwise remarkably similar to that observed in local star-forming systems.\n", "  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a multiplexed fiber-fed\nspectrograph, is a Stage-IV ground-based dark energy experiment aiming to\nmeasure redshifts for 29 million Emission-Line Galaxies (ELG), 4 million\nLuminous Red Galaxies (LRG), and 2 million Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO). The\nsurvey design includes a pattern of tiling on the sky and the locations of the\nfiber positioners in the focal plane of the telescope, with the observation\nstrategy determined by a fiber assignment algorithm that optimizes the\nallocation of fibers to targets. This strategy allows a given region to be\ncovered on average five times for a five-year survey, but with coverage varying\nbetween zero and twelve, which imprints a spatially-dependent pattern on the\ngalaxy clustering. We investigate the systematic effects of the fiber\nassignment coverage on the anisotropic galaxy clustering of ELGs and show that,\nin the absence of any corrections, it leads to discrepancies of order ten\npercent on large scales for the power spectrum multipoles. We introduce a\nmethod where objects in a random catalog are assigned a coverage, and the mean\ndensity is separately computed for each coverage factor. We show that this\nmethod reduces, but does not eliminate the effect. We next investigate the\nangular dependence of the contaminated signal, arguing that it is mostly\nlocalized to purely transverse modes. We demonstrate that the cleanest way to\nremove the contaminating signal is to perform an analysis of the anisotropic\npower spectrum $P(k,\\mu)$ and remove the lowest $\\mu$ bin, leaving $\\mu>0$\nmodes accurate at the few-percent level. Here, $\\mu$ is the cosine of the angle\nbetween the line-of-sight and the direction of $\\vec{k}$. We also investigate\ntwo alternative definitions of the random catalog and show they are comparable\nbut less effective than the coverage randoms method.\n", "  We present a strong hint of a connection between high energy $\\gamma$-ray\nemitting blazars, very high energy neutrinos, and ultra high energy cosmic\nrays. We first identify potential hadronic sources by filtering $\\gamma$-ray\nemitters %from existing catalogs that are in spatial coincidence with the high\nenergy neutrinos detected by IceCube. The neutrino filtered $\\gamma$-ray\nemitters are then correlated with the ultra high energy cosmic rays from the\nPierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array by scanning in $\\gamma$-ray\nflux ($F_{\\gamma}$) and angular separation ($\\theta$) between sources and\ncosmic rays. A maximal excess of 80 cosmic rays (42.5 expected) is found at\n$\\theta\\leq10^{\\circ}$ from the neutrino filtered $\\gamma$-ray emitters\nselected from the second hard {\\it Fermi}-LAT catalogue (2FHL) and for\n$F_\\gamma\\left(>50\\:\\mathrm{GeV}\\right)\\geq1.8\\times10^{-11}\\:\\mathrm{ph}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe probability for this to happen is $2.4 \\times 10^{-5}$, which translates to\n$\\sim 2.4 \\times 10^{-3}$ after compensation for all the considered trials. No\nexcess of cosmic rays is instead observed for the complement sample of\n$\\gamma$-ray emitters (i.e. not in spatial connection with IceCube neutrinos).\nA likelihood ratio test comparing the connection between the neutrino filtered\nand the complement source samples with the cosmic rays favours a connection\nbetween neutrino filtered emitters and cosmic rays with a probability of\n$\\sim1.8\\times10^{-3}$ ($2.9\\sigma)$ after compensation for all the considered\ntrials. The neutrino filtered $\\gamma$-ray sources that make up the cosmic rays\nexcess are blazars of the high synchrotron peak type. More statistics is needed\nto further investigate these sources as candidate cosmic ray and neutrino\nemitters.\n", "  A growing number of biological, soft, and active matter systems are observed\nto exhibit normal diffusive dynamics with a linear growth of the mean squared\ndisplacement, yet with a non-Gaussian distribution of increments. Based on the\nChubinsky-Slater idea of a diffusing diffusivity we here establish and analyze\na minimal model framework of diffusion processes with fluctuating diffusivity.\nIn particular, we demonstrate the equivalence of the diffusing diffusivity\nprocess with a superstatistical approach with a distribution of diffusivities,\nat times shorter than the diffusivity correlation time. At longer times a\ncrossover to a Gaussian distribution with an effective diffusivity emerges.\nSpecifically, we establish a subordination picture of Brownian but non-Gaussian\ndiffusion processes, that can be used for a wide class of diffusivity\nfluctuation statistics. Our results are shown to be in excellent agreement with\nsimulations and numerical evaluations.\n", "  Context. Very low-mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) present a different\nrotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the\navailable observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in\nthe low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is\ndifferent from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.\n", "  In a recent work, we have derived simple Lindblad-based equations for the\nthermalization of systems in contact with a thermal reservoir. Here, we apply\nthese equations to the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model (LMG) in contact with a\nblackbody radiation and analyze the dipole matrix elements involved in the\nthermalization process. We find that the thermalization can be complete only if\nthe density is sufficiently high, while, in the limit of low density, the\nsystem thermalizes partially, namely, within the Hilbert subspaces where the\ntotal spin has a fixed value. In this regime, and in the isotropic case, we\nevaluate the characteristic thermalization time analytically, and show that it\ndiverges with the system size in correspondence of the critical points and\ninside the ferromagnetic region. Quite interestingly, at zero temperature the\nthermalization time diverges only quadratically with the system size, whereas\nquantum adiabatic algorithms, aimed at finding the ground state of same system,\nimply a cubic divergence of the required adiabatic time.\n", "  We implemented combination of DMFT and $GW$ in its fully self-consistent way,\none shot $GW$ approximation, and quasiparticle self-consistent scheme, and\nstudied how well these combined methods perform on H$_2$ molecule as compared\nto more established methods such as LDA+DMFT. We found that most flavors of\n$GW$+DMFT break down in strongly correlated regime due to causality violation.\nAmong $GW$+DMFT methods, only the self-consistent quasiparticle $GW$+DMFT with\nstatic double-counting, and a new method with causal double-counting, correctly\nrecover the atomic limit at large H-atom separation. While some flavors of\n$GW$+DMFT improve the single-electron spectra as compared to LDA+DMFT, the\ntotal energy is best predicted by LDA+DMFT, for which the exact double-counting\nis known, and is static.\n", "  Random numbers are indispensable for a variety of applications ranging from\ntesting physics foundation to information encryption. In particular,\nnonlocality tests provide a strong evidence to our current understanding of\nnature -- quantum mechanics. All the random number generators (RNG) used for\nthe existing tests are constructed locally, making the test results vulnerable\nto the freedom-of-choice loophole. We report an experimental realization of\nRNGs based on the arrival time of cosmic photons. The measurement outcomes (raw\ndata) pass the standard NIST statistical test suite. We present a realistic\ndesign to employ these RNGs in a Bell test experiment, which addresses the\nfreedom-of-choice loophole.\n", "  YbInCu$_4$ undergoes a first order structural phase transition near $T_v$=40\nK associated with an abrupt change of Yb valence state. We perform ultrafast\npump-probe measurement on YbInCu$_4$ and find that the expected heavy fermion\nproperties arising from the \\emph{c-f} hybridization exist only in a limited\ntemperature range above $T_v$. Below $T_v$, the compound behaves like a normal\nmetal though a prominent hybridization energy gap is still present in infrared\nmeasurement. We elaborate that those seemingly controversial phenomena could be\nwell explained by assuming that the Fermi level suddenly shifts up and becomes\nfar away from the flat \\emph{f}-electron band as well as the indirect\nhybridization energy gap in the mixed valence state below $T_v$.\n", "  We compare the morphology of the core collapse supernova remnant (CCSNR) W49B\nwith the morphology of many planetary nebulae (PNe), and deduce the orientation\nof the jets that shaped this CCSNR and estimate their energy. We find\nmorphological features that are shared by some PNe and by the CCSNR W49B. In\nPNe these features, such as a barrel-shaped main body, are thought to be shaped\nby jets. We use these morphological similarities to deduce that the jets that\nshaped SNR W49B were launched along the symmetry axis of the `barrel', and to\nspeculate that this CCSNR has two opposite lobes (or ears), that are too faint\nto be observed. We crudely estimate that the jets that shaped the CCSNR into a\nbarrel shape had a kinetic energy that amounts to about one quarter to one\nthird of the energy of the entire CCSNR. The morphological similarities\nstrengthen the suggestion that jets play a central role in the explosion of\nmassive stars.\n", "  To investigate finite-volume effects on the chiral symmetry restoration and\nthe deconfinement transition and some impacts of possible global topological\nbackground for a quantum chromodynamics (QCD) system with $N_f=2$ (two quark\nflavors), we apply the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model by\nintroducing a chiral chemical potential $\\mu_5$ artificially. The final\nnumerical results indicate that the introduced chiral chemical potential does\nnot change the critical exponents but shifts the location of critical end point\n(CEP) significantly; the ratios for the chiral chemical potentials and\ntemperatures at CEP, $\\mu_c/\\mu_{5c}$ and $T_c/T_{5c}$, are significantly\naffected by the system size $R$. The behavior is that $T_c$ increases slowly\nwith $\\mu_5$ when $R$ is large and $T_c$ decreases first and then increases\nwith $\\mu_5$ when $R$ is small. It is also found that for a fixed $\\mu_5$,\nthere is a $R_{\\text{min}}$, where the critical end point vanishes, and the\nwhole phase diagram becomes a crossover when $R<R_{\\text{min}}$. Therefore, we\nsuggest that for the heavy-ion collision experiments, which is to study the\npossible location of CEP, the finite-volume behavior should be taken into\naccount.\n", "  Very forward (VF) detectors in hadron colliders, having unique sensitivity to\ndiffractive processes, can be a powerful tool for studying diffractive\ndissociation by combining them with central detectors. Several Monte Carlo\nsimulation samples in $p$-$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt s = 13$ TeV were analyzed,\nand different nondiffractive and diffractive contributions were clarified\nthrough differential cross sections of forward neutral particles. Diffraction\nselection criteria in the VF-triggered-event samples were determined by using\nthe central track information. The corresponding selection applicable in real\nexperiments has $\\approx$100% purity and 30%-70% efficiency. Consequently, the\ncentral information enables classification of the forward productions into\ndiffraction and nondiffraction categories; in particular, most of the surviving\nevents from the selection belong to low-mass diffraction events at\n$\\log_{10}(\\xi_{x}) < -5.5$. Therefore, the combined method can uniquely access\nthe low-mass diffraction regime experimentally.\n", "  The partial transpose of density matrices in many-body quantum systems, in\nwhich one takes the transpose only for a subsystem of the full Hilbert space,\nhas been recognized as a useful tool to diagnose quantum entanglement. It can\nbe used, for example, to define the (logarithmic) negativity. For fermionic\nsystems, it has been known that the partial transpose of Gaussian fermionic\ndensity matrices is not Gaussian. In this work, we propose to use partial\ntime-reversal transformation to define (an analog of) the entanglement\nnegativity and related quantities. We demonstrate that for the\nsymmetry-protected topological phase realized in the Kitaev chain the\nconventional definition of the partial transpose (and hence the entanglement\nnegativity) fails to capture the formation of the edge Majorana fermions, while\nthe partial time-reversal computes the quantum dimension of the Majorana\nfermions. Furthermore, we show that the partial time-reversal of fermionic\ndensity matrices is Gaussian and can be computed efficiently. Various results\n(both numerical and analytical) for the entanglement negativity using the\npartial-time reversal are presented for (1+1)-dimensional conformal field\ntheories, and also for fermionic disordered systems (random single phases).\n", "  The importance of electron-hole interband interactions is widely acknowledged\nfor iron-pnictide superconductors with high transition temperatures (Tc).\nHowever, high-Tc superconductivity without hole carriers has been suggested in\nFeSe single-layer films and intercalated iron-selenides, raising a fundamental\nquestion whether iron pnictides and chalcogenides have different pairing\nmechanisms. Here, we study the properties of electronic structure in the\nhigh-Tc phase induced by pressure in bulk FeSe from magneto-transport\nmeasurements and first-principles calculations. With increasing pressure, the\nlow-Tc superconducting phase transforms into high-Tc phase, where we find the\nnormal-state Hall resistivity changes sign from negative to positive,\ndemonstrating dominant hole carriers in striking contrast to other FeSe-derived\nhigh-Tc systems. Moreover, the Hall coefficient is remarkably enlarged and the\nmagnetoresistance exhibits anomalous scaling behaviors, evidencing strongly\nenhanced interband spin fluctuations in the high-Tc phase. These results in\nFeSe highlight similarities with high-Tc phases of iron pnictides, constituting\na step toward a unified understanding of iron-based superconductivity.\n", "  We demonstrate 17.7(1)% extinction of a weak coherent field by a single atom.\nWe observe a shift of the resonance frequency and a decrease in interaction\nstrength with the external field when the atom, initially at 21(1) $\\mu$K, is\nheated by the recoil of the scattered photons. Comparing to a simple model, we\nconclude that the initial temperature reduces the interaction strength by less\nthan 10%.\n", "  A key for understanding the evolution of galaxies and in particular their\nstar formation history will be future ultra-deep radio surveys. While star\nformation rates (SFRs) are regularly estimated with phenomenological formulas\nbased on the local FIR-radio correlation, we present here a physically\nmotivated model to relate star formation with radio fluxes. Such a relation\nholds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron\nemission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova\nremnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies\nsynchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism. This\nsuppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas, more\nprecisely of the free electrons. We estimate the critical observing frequency\nbelow which radio emission is not tracing the SFR, and use the three\nwell-studied local galaxies M 51, M 82, and Arp 220 as test cases for our\nmodel. If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency\nmoves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing\nframe. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore\nexpect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high\nredshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas\ncolumn densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may\nerase the star formation signatures at low frequencies. At high radio\nfrequencies both, free-free emission and the thermal bump, can dominate the\nspectrum, also limiting the applicability of this method.\n", "  We present a new method to analyze upcoming results in the search for CP\nviolating neutrino oscillations. The CP violating amplitudes\n$\\mathcal{A}_{\\alpha\\beta}^{kj}$ provide parametrization independent\nobservables, which will be accessible by experiments soon. The strong\nprediction of a unique $\\mathcal{A}_{\\alpha\\beta}^{kj}$ (the Jarlskog\ninvariant) in case of the standard three neutrino model does not hold in models\nwith new physics beyond the Standard Model. Nevertheless there are still\ncorrelations among the amplitudes depending on the specific model. Due to these\ncorrelations it is possible to reject specific new physics models by\ndetermining only 3 of the CP violating amplitudes.\n", "  We investigate the clustering properties of 45441 radio-quiet quasars (RQQs)\nand 3493 radio-loud quasars (RLQs) drawn from a joint use of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at 20 cm (FIRST) surveys in\nthe range $0.3<z<2.3$. This large spectroscopic quasar sample allow us to\ninvestigate the clustering signal dependence on radio-loudness and black hole\n(BH) virial mass. We find that RLQs are clustered more strongly than RQQs in\nall the redshift bins considered. We find a real-space correlation length of\n$r_{0}=6.59_{-0.24}^{+0.33}\\,h^{-1}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}$ and\n$r_{0}=10.95_{-1.58}^{+1.22}\\,h^{-1}\\,\\textrm{Mpc}$ {\\normalsize{}for} RQQs and\nRLQs, respectively, for the full redshift range. This implies that RLQs are\nfound in more massive host haloes than RQQs in our samples, with mean host halo\nmasses of $\\sim4.9\\times10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and\n$\\sim1.9\\times10^{12}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Comparison with\nclustering studies of different radio source samples indicates that this mass\nscale of $\\gtrsim1\\times10^{13}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ is characteristic for the\nbright radio-population, which corresponds to the typical mass of galaxy groups\nand galaxy clusters. The similarity we find in correlation lengths and host\nhalo masses for RLQs, radio galaxies and flat-spectrum radio quasars agrees\nwith orientation-driven unification models. Additionally, the clustering signal\nshows a dependence on black hole (BH) mass, with the quasars powered by the\nmost massive BHs clustering more strongly than quasars having less massive BHs.\nWe suggest that the current virial BH mass estimates may be a valid BH proxies\nfor studying quasar clustering. We compare our results to a previous\ntheoretical model that assumes that quasar activity\n", "  Dynamical solutions are always of interest to people in gravity theories. We\nderive a series of generalized Vaidya solutions in the $n$-dimensional de\nRham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity with a singular reference metric.\nSimilar to the case of the Einstein gravity, the generalized Vaidya solution\ncan describe shining/absorbing stars. Moreover, we also find a more general\nVaidya-like solution by introducing a more generic matter field than the pure\nradiation in the original Vaidya spacetime. As a result, the above generalized\nVaidya solution is naturally included in this Vaidya-like solution as a special\ncase. We investigate the thermodynamics for this Vaidya-like spacetime by using\nthe unified first law, and present the generalized Misner-Sharp mass. Our\nresults show that the generalized Minser-Sharp mass does exist in this\nspacetime. In addition, the usual Clausius relation $\\delta Q= TdS$ holds on\nthe apparent horizon, which implicates that the massive gravity is in a\nthermodynamic equilibrium state. We find that the work density vanishes for the\ngeneralized Vaidya solution, while it appears in the more general Vaidya-like\nsolution. Furthermore, the covariant generalized Minser-Sharp mass in the\n$n$-dimensional de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley massive gravity is also derived by\ntaking a general metric ansatz into account.\n", "  In this work, we illustrate the recently introduced concept of the cavity\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation for correlated electron-nuclear-photon problems\nin detail. We demonstrate how an expansion in terms of conditional electronic\nand photon-nuclear wave functions accurately describes eigenstates of strongly\ncorrelated light-matter systems. For a GaAs quantum ring model in resonance\nwith a photon mode we highlight how the ground-state electronic\npotential-energy surface changes the usual harmonic potential of the free\nphoton mode to a dressed mode with a double-well structure. This change is\naccompanied by a splitting of the electronic ground-state density. For a model\nwhere the photon mode is in resonance with a vibrational transition, we observe\nin the excited-state electronic potential-energy surface a splitting from a\nsingle minimum to a double minimum. Furthermore, for a time-dependent setup, we\nshow how the dynamics in correlated light-matter systems can be understood in\nterms of population transfer between potential energy surfaces. This work at\nthe interface of quantum chemistry and quantum optics paves the way for the\nfull ab-initio description of matter-photon systems.\n", "  We use a model of the molecular gas distribution within ~100 pc from the\ncenter of the Milky Way (Kruijssen, Dale & Longmore) to simulate time evolution\nand polarization properties of the reflected X-ray emission, associated with\nthe past outbursts from Sgr A*. While this model is too simple to describe the\ncomplexity of the true gas distribution, it illustrates the importance and\npower of long-term observations of the reflected emission. We show that the\nvariable part of X-ray emission observed by Chandra and XMM from prominent\nmolecular clouds is well described by a pure reflection model, providing strong\nsupport of the reflection scenario. While the identification of Sgr A* as a\nprimary source for this reflected emission is already a very appealing\nhypothesis, a decisive test of this model can be provided by future X-ray\npolarimetric observations, that will allow placing constraints on the location\nof the primary source. In addition, X-ray polarimeters (like, e.g., XIPE) have\nsufficient sensitivity to constrain the line-of-sight positions of molecular\ncomplexes, removing major uncertainty in the model.\n", "  Bouncing solutions are obtained from a generally covariant action\ncharacterized by a potential which is a nonlocal functional of the dilaton\nfield at two separated space-time points. Gradient instabilities are shown to\narise in this context but they are argued to be nongeneric. After performing a\ngauge-invariant and frame-invariant derivation of the evolution equations of\nthe fluctuations, a heuristic criterion for the avoidance of pathological\ninstabilities is proposed and corroborated by a number of explicit examples\nthat turn out to be compatible with a quasi-flat spectrum of curvature\ninhomogeneities for typical wavelengths larger than the Hubble radius.\n", "  An insight into vortex reconnections in superfluids is presented making use\nof analytical results and numerical simulations of the Gross--Pitaevskii model.\nUniversal aspects of the reconnection process are investigated by considering\ndifferent initial vortex configurations and making use of a recently developed\ntracking algorithm to reconstruct the vortex filaments. We show that during a\nreconnection event the vortex lines approach and separate always accordingly to\nthe time scaling $ \\delta \\sim t^{1/2} $ with pre-factors that depend on the\nvortex configuration. We also investigate the behavior of curvature and torsion\nclose to the reconnection point, demonstrating analytically that the curvature\ncan exhibit a self-similar behavior that might be broken by the development of\nshock-like structures in the torsion.\n", "  Coupling dark matter to light new particles is an attractive way to combine\nthermal production with strong velocity-dependent self-interactions. Here we\npoint out that in such models the dark matter annihilation rate is generically\nenhanced by the Sommerfeld effect, and we derive the resulting constraints from\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background and other indirect detection probes. For the\nfrequently studied case of s-wave annihilation these constraints exclude the\nentire parameter space where the self-interactions are large enough to address\nthe small-scale problems of structure formation.\n", "  We close a gap in previous studies of nonsupersymmetric ${\\cal N}=0$ quiver\ngauge theories from a phenomenological point of view aimed at acquiring\nspecific proposals for models beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Because $SU(3)$\nis the gauge group of QCD we fix $N=3$ and vary only the $Z_p$ abelian\norbifold. The values $1 \\leq p \\leq 7$ have been previously fully discussed as\nwell as one special case, discovered by happenstance, of $p=12$. The values $p\n= 8$ and $p=9$ are discussed comprehensively in the present paper including the\nelectroweak mixing angle, gauge coupling unification, spontaneous symmetry\nbreakdown to the standard model, and the occurrence of three quark-lepton\nfamilies. Two promising quiver node identifications are discovered for $p=8$\nand three for $p=9$. All of these merit further study as BSM candidates.\n", "  The addition of a 28 m Cherenkov telescope (CT5) to the H.E.S.S. array\nextended the experiment's sensitivity to lower energies. The lowest energy\nthreshold is obtained using monoscopic analysis of data taken with CT5,\nproviding access to gamma-ray energies below 100 GeV. Such an extension of the\ninstrument's energy range is particularly beneficial for studies of Active\nGalactic Nuclei with soft spectra, as expected for those at a redshift > 0.5.\nThe high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects PKS 2155-304 (z = 0.116) and PG\n1553+113 (0.43 < z < 0.58) are among the brightest objects in the gamma-ray\nsky, both showing clear signatures of gamma-ray absorption at E > 100 GeV\ninterpreted as being due to interactions with the extragalactic background\nlight (EBL). Multiple observational campaigns of PKS 2155-304 and PG 1553+113\nwere conducted during 2013 and 2014 using the full H.E.S.S. II instrument. A\nmonoscopic analysis of the data taken with the new CT5 telescope was developed\nalong with an investigation into the systematic uncertainties on the spectral\nparameters. The energy spectra of PKS 2155-304 and PG 1553+113 were\nreconstructed down to energies of 80 GeV for PKS 2155-304, which transits near\nzenith, and 110 GeV for the more northern PG 1553+113. The measured spectra,\nwell fitted in both cases by a log-parabola spectral model (with a 5.0 sigma\nstatistical preference for non-zero curvature for PKS 2155-304 and 4.5 sigma\nfor PG 1553+113), were found consistent with spectra derived from\ncontemporaneous Fermi-LAT data, indicating a sharp break in the observed\nspectra of both sources at E ~ 100 GeV. When corrected for EBL absorption, the\nintrinsic H.E.S.S. II mono and Fermi-LAT spectrum of PKS 2155-304 was found to\nshow significant curvature. For PG 1553+113, however, no significant detection\nof curvature in the intrinsic spectrum could be found within statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties.\n", "  We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope's detection of extended gamma-ray\nemission towards the direction of the young massive star cluster NGC 3603. The\nemission shows a hard spectrum with a photon index of 2.3 from 1 GeV to 250\nGeV. The large size and high luminosity of this structure make it unlikely a\npulsar wind nebular. On the other hand the spatial correlation with the ionised\ngas indicate a hadronic origin. The total cosmic ray (CR) protons energy are\nestimated to be of the order $10^{50} ~\\rm erg$ assuming the gamma-ray are\nproduced in the interaction of CRs with ambient gas . The environment and\nspectral features show significant similarity with the Cygnus cocoon. It\nreveals that the young star clusters may be a gamma-ray source population and\nthey can potentially accelerate a significant fraction of the Galactic cosmic\nrays.\n", "  Andromeda is our nearest neighbouring disk galaxy and a prime target for\ndetailed modelling of the evolutionary processes that shape galaxies. We\nanalyse the nature of M31's triaxial bulge with an extensive set of N-body\nmodels, which include Box/Peanut (B/P) bulges as well as initial classical\nbulges (ICBs). Comparing with IRAC 3.6$\\mu m$ data, only one model matches\nsimultaneously all the morphological properties of M31's bulge, and requires an\nICB and a B/P bulge with 1/3 and 2/3 of the total bulge mass respectively. We\nfind that our pure B/P bulge models do not show concentrations high enough to\nmatch the S\\'ersic index ($n$) and the effective radius of M31's bulge.\nInstead, the best model requires an ICB component with mass $M^{\\rm\nICB}=1.1\\times10^{10}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and three-dimensional half-mass radius\n$r_{\\rm half}^{\\rm ICB}$=0.53 kpc (140 arcsec). The B/P bulge component has a\nmass of $M^{\\rm B/P}=2.2\\times10^{10}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ and a half-mass radius of\n$r_{\\rm half}^{\\rm B/P}$=1.3 kpc (340 arcsec). The model's B/P bulge extends to\n$r^{\\rm B/P}$=3.2 kpc (840 arcsec) in the plane of the disk, as does M31's\nbulge. In this composite bulge model, the ICB component explains the velocity\ndispersion drop observed in the centre within $R<$190 pc (50 arcsec), while the\nB/P bulge component reproduces the observed rapid rotation and the kinematic\ntwist of the observed zero velocity line. This model's pattern speed is\n$\\Omega_p$=38 km/s/kpc, placing corotation at $r_{\\rm cor}$=5.8 kpc (1500\narcsec). The outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) is then at $r_{\\rm OLR}$=10.4kpc,\nnear the 10kpc-ring of M31, suggesting that this structure may be related to\nthe bar's OLR. By comparison with an earlier snapshot, we estimate that M31's\nthin bar extends to $r_{\\rm bar}^{\\rm thin}\\sim$4.0 kpc (1000 arcsec) in the\ndisk plane, and in projection extends to $R_{\\rm bar}^{\\rm thin}\\sim$2.3 kpc\n(600 arcsec).\n", "  We discuss Onsager's thermodynamic formalism for transport coefficients and\napply it to the calculation of the shear modulus and shear viscosity of a\nmonodisperse system of repulsive particles. We focus on the concept of\nextensive \"distance\" and intensive \"field\" conjugated via a Fenchel-Legendre\ntransform involving a thermodynamic(-like) potential, which allows to switch\nensembles. Employing Brownian dynamics, we calculate both the shear modulus and\nthe shear viscosity from strain fluctuations and show that they agree with\ndirect calculations from strained and non-equilibrium simulations,\nrespectively. We find a dependence of the fluctuations on the coupling strength\nto the strain reservoir, which can be traced back to the discrete-time\nintegration. These results demonstrate the viability of exploiting fluctuations\nof extensive quantities for the numerical calculation of transport\ncoefficients.\n", "  Fault-tolerant quantum computers compose elements of a discrete gate set in\norder to approximate a target unitary. The problem of minimising the number of\ngates is known as gate-synthesis. The approximation error is a form of coherent\nnoise, which can be significantly more damaging than comparable incoherent\nnoise. We show how mixing over different gate sequences can convert this\ncoherent noise into an incoherent form. As measured by diamond distance, the\npost-mixing noise is quadratically smaller than before mixing, with no\nadditional resource cost. Equivalently, we can use a shorter gate sequence to\nachieve the same precision as unitary gate-synthesis, with a factor 1/2\nreduction for a broad class of problems.\n", "  The analysis of 176 gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow plateaus observed by\nSwift from GRBs with known redshifts revealed that the subsample of long GRBs\nassociated with supernovae (LONG-SNe) - 19 events - presents a very high\ncorrelation coefficient between the luminosity at the end of the plateau phase\nLa and the end time of the plateau T*a, hereafter Dainotti relation.\nFurthermore, these SNe Ib/c associated with GRBs also obey the peak-magnitude\nstretch relation, similar to that used to standardize the SNe Ia. We here\ninvestigate a category of GRBs with plateau and associated with SNe to compare\nthe Dainotti correlation for this sample with the correlation for long GRBs for\nwhich no associated SN has been observed (hereafter LONG-NO-SNe, 128 GRBs) and\nto check whether there is a difference among these sub-samples. We first\nadopted a non-parametric statistical method to take redshift evolution into\naccount and to check if and how this effect may steepen the slope for the\nLONG-NO-SNe sample. Therefore, removing selection bias is the first step before\nany comparison among samples observed at different redshifts could be properly\nperformed. Then, we applied the T-student test to evaluate a statistical\ndifference between the slopes of the two samples. We demonstrate that there is\nno evolution for the slope of the LONG-NO-SNe sample and no evolution is\nexpected for the LONG-SNe sample at small redshifts. The difference between the\nslope of the LONG-NO-SNe and the slope of LONG-SNe with firm spectral detection\nof SN components, is statistically significant. This possibly suggests that,\nunlike LONG-NO-SNe, LONG-SNe with firm spectroscopic features of the associated\nSNe might not require a standard energy reservoir in the plateau phase.\nTherefore, this analysis may open new perspectives in future theoretical\ninvestigations of the GRBs with plateau emission and that are associated with\nSNe.\n", "  This paper assesses the roles of the presence of warm H2, and the increased\nformation rate due to the ion-neutral drift. We performed ideal MHD simulations\nthat include the heating and cooling of the multiphase ISM, and where we treat\ndynamically the formation of H2. In a post-processing step we compute the\nabundances of species at chemical equilibrium. We show that CH+ is efficiently\nformed at the edge of clumps, in regions where the H2 fraction is low, but\nnevertheless higher than its equilibrium value, and where the gas temperature\nis high. We show that warm and out of equilibrium H2 increases the integrated\ncolumn densities of CH+ by one order of magnitude, up to values still 3-10\ntimes lower than those observed in the diffuse ISM. We balance the Lorentz\nforce with the ion-neutral drag to estimate the ion-drift velocities (vd). We\nfind that the vd distribution peaks around 0.04 km s-1, and that high vd are\ntoo rare to have a significant statistical impact on the abundances of CH+.\nCompared to previous works, our multiphase simulations reduce the spread in vd,\nand our self-consistent treatment of the ionisation leads to much reduced vd.\nNevertheless, our resolution study shows that this velocity distribution is not\nconverged: the ion-neutral drift has a higher impact on CH+ at higher\nresolution. On the other hand, our ideal MHD simulations do not include\nambipolar diffusion, which would yield lower drift velocities. Within these\nlimitations, we conclude that warm H2 is a key ingredient in the efficient\nformation of CH+ and that the ambipolar diffusion has very little influence on\nthe abundance of CH+, mainly due to the small drift velocities obtained.\nHowever, we point out that small-scale processes and other non-thermal\nprocesses not included in our MHD simulation may be of crucial importance, and\nhigher resolution studies with better controlled dissipation processes are\nneeded.\n", "  We present the results of deep 140 ks Suzaku X-ray observations of the\nnorth-east (NE) radio relic of the merging galaxy cluster Abell2255. The\ntemperature structure of Abell2255 is measured out to 0.9 times the virial\nradius (1.9 Mpc) in the NE direction for the first time. The Suzaku temperature\nmap of the central region suggests a complex temperature distribution, which\nagrees with previous work. Additionally, on a larger-scale, we confirm that the\ntemperature drops from 6 keV around the cluster center to 3 keV at the\noutskirts, with two discontinuities at {\\it r}$\\sim$5\\arcmin~(450 kpc) and\n$\\sim$12\\arcmin~(1100 kpc) from the cluster center. Their locations coincide\nwith surface brightness discontinuities marginally detected in the XMM-Newton\nimage, which indicates the presence of shock structures. From the temperature\ndrop, we estimate the Mach numbers to be ${\\cal M}_{\\rm inner}\\sim$1.2 and,\n${\\cal M}_{\\rm outer}\\sim$1.4. The first structure is most likely related to\nthe large cluster core region ($\\sim$350--430 kpc), and its Mach number is\nconsistent with the XMM-Newton observation (${\\cal M}\\sim$1.24: Sakelliou &\nPonman 2006). Our detection of the second temperature jump, based on the Suzaku\nkey project observation, shows the presence of a shock structure across the NE\nradio relic. This indicates a connection between the shock structure and the\nrelativistic electrons that generate radio emission. Across the NE radio relic,\nhowever, we find a significantly lower temperature ratio\n($T_1/T_2\\sim1.44\\pm0.16$ corresponds to~${\\cal M}_{\\rm X-ray}\\sim1.4$) than\nthe value expected from radio wavelengths, based on the standard diffusive\nshock acceleration mechanism ($T_1/T_2>$ 3.2 or ${\\cal M}_{\\rm Radio}>$ 2.8).\n", "  We study indirect detection signals from solar annihilation of dark matter\n(DM) particles into light right-handed (RH) neutrinos with a mass in a $1-5$\nGeV range. These RH neutrinos can have a sufficiently long lifetime to allow\nthem to decay outside the Sun and their delayed decays can result in a signal\nin gamma rays from the otherwise `dark' solar direction, and also a neutrino\nsignal that is not suppressed by the interactions with solar medium. We find\nthat the latest Fermi-LAT and IceCube results place limits on the gamma ray and\nneutrino signals, respectively. Combined photon and neutrino bounds can\nconstrain the spin-independent DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross section\nbetter than direct detection experiments for DM masses from 200 GeV up to\nseveral TeV. The bounds on spin-dependent scattering are also much tighter than\nthe strongest limits from direct detection experiments.\n", "  We report observation of strong and anisotropic third harmonic generation\n(THG) in monolayer and multilayer ReS$_2$. The third-order nonlinear optical\nsusceptibility of monolayer ReS$_2$, $\\left| \\chi^{(3)} \\right|$ is on the\norder of $10^{-18} $ m$^2$/V$^2$, which is about one order of magnitude higher\nthan reported results for hexagonal-lattice transition metal dichalcogenides\nsuch as MoS$_2$. A similar magnitude for the third-order nonlinear optical\nsusceptibility was also obtained for a multilayer sample. The intensity of the\nTHG field was found to be dependent on the direction of the incident light\npolarization for both monolayer and multilayer samples. A point group symmetry\nanalysis shows that such anisotropy is not expected from a perfect $1T$\nlattice, and must arise from the distortions in the ReS$_2$ lattice. Our\nresults show that THG measurements can be used to characterize lattice\ndistortions of two-dimensional materials, and that lattice distortions are\nimportant for the nonlinear optical properties of such materials.\n", "  Observations of the sun suggest that solar activities systematically create\nnorth-south hemispheric asymmetries. For instance, the hemisphere in which the\nsunspot activity is more active tends to switch after the early half of each\nsolar cycle. Svalgaard & Kamide (2013) recently pointed out that the time gaps\nof polar field reversal between the north and south hemispheres are simply\nconsequences of the asymmetry of sunspot activity. However, the mechanism\nunderlying the asymmetric feature in solar cycle activities is not yet well\nunderstood. In this paper, in order to explain the cause of the asymmetry from\nthe theoretical point of view, we investigate the relationship between the\ndipole- and quadrupole-type components of the magnetic field in the solar cycle\nusing the mean-field theory based on the flux transport dynamo model. As a\nresult, we found that there are two different attractors of the solar cycle, in\nwhich either the north or the south polar field is first reversed, and that the\nflux transport dynamo model well explains the phase-asymmetry of sunspot\nactivity and the polar field reversal without any ad hoc source of asymmetry.\n", "  Until 2013, only the giant planets were known to host ring systems. In June\n2013, a stellar occulation revealed the presence of narrow and dense rings\naround Chariklo, a small Centaur object that orbits between Saturn and Uranus.\nMeanwhile, the Cassini spacecraft revealed evidence for the possible past\npresence of rings around the Saturnian satellites Rhea and Iapetus. Mars and\nPluto are expected to have tenuous dusty rings, though they have so far evaded\ndetection. More remotely, transit events observed around a star in 2007 may\nhave revealed for the first time exoplanetary rings around a giant planet\norbiting that star. So, evidence is building to show that rings are more common\nfeatures in the universe than previously thought. Several interesting issues\narising from the discovery (or suspicion) of new ring systems are described in\nthis chapter.\n", "  We consider the problem of spin-triplet p-wave superfluid pairing with total\nspin projection $m_s=0$ in atomic Fermi gas across the Feshbach resonance. We\nallow for imbalanced populations and take into account the effects due to\npresence of a parabolic trapping potential. Within the mean-field approximation\nfor the one- and two-channel pairing models we show that depending on the\ndistance from the center of a trap at least two superfluid states will have the\nlowest energy. Superfluid shells which emerge in a trap may have two out of\nthree angular components of the p-wave superfluid order parameter equal to\nzero.\n", "  We present a new basis for scaling abundances with total metallicity in\nnebular photoionisation models, based on extensive Milky Way stellar abundance\ndata, to replace the uniform scaling normally used in the analysis of HII\nregions. Our goal is to provide a single scaling method and local abundance\nreference standard for use in nebular modelling and its key inputs, the stellar\natmosphere and evolutionary track models. We introduce a parametric enrichment\nfactor, zeta, to describe how atomic abundances scale with total abundance, and\nwhich allows for a simple conversion between scales based on different\nreference elements (usually oxygen or iron) . The models and parametric\ndescription provide a more physically realistic approach than simple uniform\nabundance scaling. With appropriate parameters, the methods described here may\nbe applied to HII regions in the Milky Way, large and dwarf galaxies in the\nlocal universe, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), and to star forming regions at\nhigh redshift.\n", "  The present work proposes a self-consistent reduced-order NLTE kinetic model\nfor radiating plasmas such as are found in the outer layers of stellar\natmospheres. Starting from the most up-to-date set of ab-initio and\nexperimental data, the highly complex collisional-radiative kinetic mechanism\nis simplified by lumping the bound energy states in groups. Different grouping\nstrategies are investigated, such as uniform and Maxwell-Boltzmann. The reduced\nset of governing equations for the material gas and the radiation field is\nobtained based on a moment method. Applications consider the steady flow across\na shock wave in partially ionized hydrogen. The results show that adopting a\nMaxwell-Boltzmann grouping allows, on the one hand, for a substantial reduction\nof the number of unknowns and, on the other, to maintain accuracy for both gas\nand radiation quantities. It is observed that, when neglecting line radiation,\nthe use of two groups already leads to a very accurate resolution of the\nphoto-ionization precursor, internal relaxation and radiative cooling regions.\nThe inclusion of line radiation requires adopting just one additional group to\naccount for optically thin losses in the alpha, beta and gamma lines of the\nBalmer and Paschen series. This trend has been observed for a wide range of\nshock wave velocities.\n", "  We prove the Doran-Harder-Thompson conjecture in the case of elliptic curves\nby using ideas from SYZ mirror symmetry. The conjecture claims that when a\nCalabi-Yau manifold $X$ degenerates to a union of two quasi-Fano manifolds\n(Tyurin degeneration), a mirror Calabi-Yau manifold of $X$ can be constructed\nby gluing the two mirror Landau-Ginzburg models of the quasi-Fano manifolds.\nThe two crucial ideas in our proof are to obtain a complex structure by gluing\nthe underlying affine manifolds and to construct the theta functions from the\nLandau-Ginzburg superpotentials.\n", "  We investigate a one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in a parametrically\ndriven global harmonic trap. The delicate interplay of both the local atom\ninteraction and the global driving allows to control the dynamical stability of\nthe trapped quantum many-body state. The mechanism is illustrated for weak\ninteraction by a discretized Gross-Pitaevskii equation within a Gaussian\nvariational ansatz, yielding to a Mathieu equation for the condensate width.\nThe parametric resonance condition can be tuned by the atom interaction\nstrength. For stronger interaction, this mechanism is confirmed by results of\nthe numerically exact time-evolving block decimation scheme. The global\nmodulation also induces an effective time-independent inhomogeneous hopping\nstrength for the atoms.\n", "  Information geometry can be used to understand and optimize Higgs\nmeasurements at the LHC. The Fisher information encodes the maximum sensitivity\nof observables to model parameters for a given experiment. Applied to\nhigher-dimensional operators, it defines the new physics reach of any LHC\nsignature. We calculate the Fisher information for Higgs production in weak\nboson fusion with decays into tau pairs and four leptons, and for Higgs\nproduction in association with a single top quark. In a next step we analyze\nhow the differential information is distributed over phase space, which defines\noptimal event selections. Conversely, we consider the information in the\ndistribution of a subset of the kinematic variables, showing which production\nand decay observables are the most powerful and how much information is lost in\ntraditional histogram-based analysis methods compared to fully multivariate\nones.\n", "  Recently, a new family of observables consisting of azimuthal-angle\ngeneralised ratios was proposed in a kinematical setup that resembles the usual\nMueller-Navelet jets but with an additional tagged jet in the central region of\nrapidity. Non-tagged minijet activity between the three jets can affect\nsignificantly the azimuthal angle orientation of the jets and is accounted for\nby the introduction of two BFKL gluon Green functions. Here, we calculate the,\npresumably, most relevant higher order corrections to the observables by now\nconvoluting the three leading-order jet vertices with two gluon Green functions\nat next-to-leading logarithmic approximation. The corrections appear to be\nmostly moderate giving us confidence that the recently proposed observables are\nactually an excellent way to probe the BFKL dynamics at the LHC. Furthermore,\nwe allow for the jets to take values in different rapidity bins in various\nconfigurations such that a comparison between our predictions and the\nexperimental data is a straightforward task.\n", "  Ga$_{0.51}$In$_{0.49}$P is a promising candidate for thermally tunable\nnanophotonic devices due to its low thermal conductivity. In this work we study\nits thermo-optical response. We obtain the linear thermo-optical coefficient\n$dn/dT=2.0\\pm0.3\\cdot 10^{-4}\\,\\rm{K}^{-1}$ by investigating the transmission\nproperties of a single mode-gap photonic crystal nanocavity.\n", "  We investigate the short-time universal behavior of the two dimensional\nAshkin-Teller model at the Baxter line by performing time-dependent Monte Carlo\nSimulations. First, as preparatory results, we obtain the critical parameters\nby searching the optimal power law decay of the magnetization. Thus, the\ndynamic critical exponents $\\theta _{m}$ and $\\theta _{p}$, related to the\nmagnetic and electric order parameters, as well as the persistence exponent\n$\\theta _{g}$, are estimated using heat-bath Monte Carlo simulations. In\naddition, we estimate the dynamic exponent $z$ and the static critical\nexponents $\\beta $ and $\\nu $ for both order parameters. We propose a refined\nmethod to estimate the static exponents that considers two different averages:\none that combines an internal average using several seeds with another which is\ntaken over geographic variations in the power laws. Moreover, we also performed\nthe bootstrapping method for a complementary analysis. Our results show that\nthe ratio $\\beta /\\nu $ exhibits universal behavior along the critical line\ncorroborating the conjecture for both magnetization and polarization.\n", "  Apart from thousands of `regular' exoplanet candidates, Kepler satellite has\ndiscovered a few stars exhibiting peculiar eclipse-like events. They are most\nprobably caused by disintegrating bodies transiting in front of the star.\nHowever, the nature of the bodies and obscuration events, such as those\nobserved in KIC8462852, remain mysterious. A swarm of comets or artificial\nalien mega-structures have been proposed as an explanation for the latter\nobject.\n  We explore the possibility that such eclipses are caused by the dust clouds\nassociated with massive parent bodies orbiting the host star.\n  We assumed a massive object and a simple model of the dust cloud surrounding\nthe object. Then, we used the numerical integration to simulate the evolution\nof the cloud, its parent body, and resulting light-curves as they orbit and\ntransit the star.\n  We found that it is possible to reproduce the basic features in the\nlight-curve of KIC8462852 with only four objects enshrouded in dust clouds. The\nfact that they are all on similar orbits and that such models require only a\nhandful of free parameters provides additional support for this hypothesis.\n  This model provides an alternative to the comet scenario. With such physical\nmodels at hand, at present, there is no need to invoke alien mega-structures\nfor an explanation of these light-curves.\n", "  The random-field Ising model is one of the few disordered systems where the\nperturbative renormalization group can be carried out to all orders of\nperturbation theory. This analysis predicts dimensional reduction, i.e., that\nthe critical properties of the random-field Ising model in $D$ dimensions are\nidentical to those of the pure Ising ferromagnet in $D-2$ dimensions. It is\nwell known that dimensional reduction is not true in three dimensions, thus\ninvalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report\nhigh-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero\ntemperature. We illustrate universality by comparing different probability\ndistributions for the random fields. We compute all the relevant critical\nexponents (including the critical slowing down exponent for the ground-state\nfinding algorithm), as well as several other renormalization-group invariants.\nThe estimated values of the critical exponents of the 5D random-field Ising\nmodel are statistically compatible to those of the pure 3D Ising ferromagnet.\nThese results support the restoration of dimensional reduction at $D = 5$. We\nthus conclude that the failure of the perturbative renormalization group is a\nlow-dimensional phenomenon. We close our contribution by comparing universal\nquantities for the random-field problem at dimensions $3 \\leq D < 6$ to their\nvalues in the pure Ising model at $D-2$ dimensions and we provide a clear\nverification of the Rushbrooke equality at all studied dimensions.\n", "  In this paper, using the holographic prescription, we study multispin bound\nstates and their dispersion relations over the $ \\kappa $-deformed $\nAdS_{3}\\times S^{3} $ background. In the first part of our analysis,\nconsidering the conformal gauge conditions (associated with the Polyakov\naction) we explore the dispersion relation associated with spin two bound\nstates at strong coupling. We solve corresponding world-sheet fluctuations and\ncompute all the conserved quantities associated with the stringy dynamics over\nthe deformed background. In the second part of our analysis, we perform similar\nanalysis for spin three configurations. In both cases, we observe the emergence\nof non trivial background deformation that vanishes in the limit, $ \\kappa\n\\rightarrow 0$.\n", "  Primordial non-Gaussianity encodes valuable information about the physics of\ninflation, including the spectrum of particles and interactions. Significant\nimprovements in our understanding of non-Gaussanity beyond Planck require\ninformation from large-scale structure. The most promising approach to utilize\nthis information comes from the scale-dependent bias of halos. For local\nnon-Gaussanity, the improvements available are well studied but the potential\nfor non-Gaussianity beyond the local type, including equilateral and\nquasi-single field inflation, is much less well understood. In this paper, we\nforecast the capabilities of large-scale structure surveys to detect general\nnon-Gaussianity through galaxy/halo power spectra. We study how non-Gaussanity\ncan be distinguished from a general biasing model and where the information is\nencoded. For quasi-single field inflation, significant improvements over Planck\nare possible in some regions of parameter space. We also show that the\nmulti-tracer technique can significantly improve the sensitivity for all\nnon-Gaussianity types, providing up to an order of magnitude improvement for\nequilateral non-Gaussianity over the single-tracer measurement.\n", "  Internal shocks occurring in blazars may accelerate both thermal and\nnon-thermal electrons. In this paper we examine the consequences that such a\nhybrid (thermal/non-thermal) EED has on the spectrum of blazars. Since the\nthermal component of the EED may extend to very low energies. We replace the\nstandard synchrotron process by the more general magneto-bremsstrahlung (MBS).\nSignificant differences in the energy flux appear at low radio frequencies when\nconsidering MBS instead of the standard synchrotron emission. A drop in the\nspectrum appears in the all the radio band and a prominent valley between the\ninfrared and soft X-rays bands when a hybrid EED is considered, instead of a\npower-law EED. In the $\\gamma$-ray band an EED of mostly thermal particles\ndisplays significant differences with respect to the one dominated by\nnon-thermal particles. A thermally-dominated EED produces a synchrotron\nself-Compton (SSC) peak extending only up to a few MeV, and the valley\nseparating the MBS and the SSC peaks is much deeper than if the EED is\ndominated by non-thermal particles. The combination of these effects modifies\nthe Compton dominance of a blazar, suggesting that the vertical scatter in the\ndistribution of FSRQs and BL Lac objects in the peak synchrotron frequency -\nCompton dominance parameter space could be attributed to different proportions\nof thermal/non-thermal particles in the EED of blazars. Finally, the\ntemperature of the electrons in the shocked plasma is shown to be a degenerated\nquantity for different magentizations of the ejected material.\n", "  Star forming galaxies have long been considered the dominant sources of the\ncosmic ultraviolet background radiation at early epochs. However, observing and\ncharacterizing the galaxy population with significant ionizing emission has\nproven to be challenging. In particular, the fraction of ionizing radiation\nthat escapes the local environment to the intergalactic medium is poorly known.\nWe investigate the relation between the escape fraction and galaxy luminosity.\nWe combine the deep ultraviolet observations of Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UVUDF)\nwith the deep Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of the same\nfield, collecting a sample of 165 faint star forming galaxies in the $3 < z <\n4$ redshift range with deep rest-frame observations of the Lyman continuum. In\nour sample, we do not find any galaxy with significant emission of LyC\nradiation. We bin the galaxies in various redshift and brightness intervals and\nstack their images. From stacked images we estimate the relative escape\nfraction upper limits as a function of the luminosity. Thanks to the depth of\nthe sample we measure meaningful 1$\\sigma$ upper limits of $f_{esc,rel} < 0.07,\n0.2$ and 0.6 at $L \\sim L_{\\rm z=3}^{*}, 0.5L_{\\rm z=3}^{*}$ and $0.1L_{\\rm\nz=3}^{*}$, respectively. We use our estimates and theoretical predictions from\nthe literature to study a possible dependence of the escape fraction on galaxy\nluminosity by modelling the ionizing background with different prescriptions of\n$f_{\\rm esc} (M_{\\rm UV})$. We show that the understanding of the luminosity\ndependence hinges on the ability to constrain the escape fraction down to\n$M_{\\rm UV} \\sim -18$ mag in the future.\n", "  We apply our recently developed, selfconsistent renormalization group (RG)\nmethod to STM spectra of a two-impurity Kondo system consisting of two cobalt\natoms connected by a one-dimensional Cu chain on a Cu surface. This RG method\nwas developed to describe local spin screening in multi-impurity Kondo systems\nin presence of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. Using the\nRKKY interaction of a one-dimensional chain, we explain the experimentally\nobserved suppression and oscillation of the Kondo temperature, $T_K(y)$, as a\nfunction of the length of the chain and the corresponding RKKY interaction\nparameter $y$, regardless of the RKKY coupling being ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic.\n", "  We consider the point-indentation of a pressurized elastic shell. It has\npreviously been shown that such a shell is subject to a wrinkling instability\nas the indentation depth is quasi-statically increased. Here we present\ndetailed analysis of this wrinkling instability using a combination of\nanalytical techniques and finite element simulations. In particular, we study\nhow the number of wrinkles observed at the onset of instability grows with\nincreasing pressurization. We also study how, for fixed pressurization, the\nnumber of wrinkles changes both spatially and with increasing indentation depth\nbeyond onset. This `Far from threshold' analysis exploits the largeness of the\nwrinkle wavenumber that is observed at high pressurization and leads to\nquantitative differences with the standard `Near threshold' stability analysis.\n", "  In current and future surveys, quasars play a key role. The new data will\nextend our knowledge of the Universe as it will be used to better constrain the\ncosmological model at redshift $z>1$ via baryon acoustic oscillation and\nredshift space distortion measurements. Here, we present the first clustering\nstudy of quasars observed by the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey. We measure the clustering of $\\sim 70,000$ quasars located in the\nredshift range $0.9<z<2.2$ that cover 1,168 deg$^2$. We model the clustering\nand produce high-fidelity quasar mock catalogues based on the BigMultiDark\nPlanck simulation. Thus, we use a modified (Sub)Halo Abundance Matching model\nto account for the specificities of the halo population hosting quasars. We\nfind that quasars are hosted by halos with masses $\\sim10^{12.7}M_\\odot$ and\ntheir bias evolves from 1.54 ($z=1.06$) to 3.15 ($z=1.98$). Using the current\neBOSS data, we cannot distinguish between models with different fractions of\nsatellites. The high-fidelity mock light-cones, including properties of halos\nhosting quasars, are made publicly available.\n", "  We generalize the semiclassical treatment of graviton radiation to\ngravitational scattering at very large energies $\\sqrt{s}\\gg m_P$ and finite\nscattering angles $\\Theta_s$, so as to approach the collapse regime of impact\nparameters $b \\simeq b_c \\sim R\\equiv 2G\\sqrt{s}$. Our basic tool is the\nextension of the recently proposed, unified form of radiation to the ACV\nreduced-action model and to its resummed-eikonal exchange. By superimposing\nthat radiation all-over eikonal scattering, we are able to derive the\ncorresponding (unitary) coherent-state operator. The resulting graviton\nspectrum, tuned on the gravitational radius $R$, fully agrees with previous\ncalculations for small angles $\\Theta_s\\ll 1$ but, for sizeable angles\n$\\Theta_s(b)\\leq \\Theta_c = O(1)$ acquires an exponential cutoff of the large\n$\\omega R$ region, due to energy conservation, so as to emit a finite fraction\nof the total energy. In the approach-to-collapse regime of $b\\to b_c^+$ we find\na radiation enhancement due to large tidal forces, so that the whole energy is\nradiated off, with a large multiplicity $\\langle N \\rangle\\sim Gs \\gg 1$ and a\nwell-defined frequency cutoff of order $R^{-1}$. The latter corresponds to the\nHawking temperature for a black hole of mass notably smaller than $\\sqrt{s}$.\n", "  Current observations of the atmospheres of close-in exoplanets are\npredominantly obtained with two techniques: low-resolution spectroscopy with\nspace telescopes and high-resolution spectroscopy from the ground. Although the\nobservables delivered by the two methods are in principle highly complementary,\nno attempt has ever been made to combine them, perhaps due to the different\nmodeling approaches that are typically used in their interpretation. Here we\npresent the first combined analysis of previously-published dayside spectra of\nthe exoplanet HD 209458b obtained at low resolution with HST/WFC3 and\nSpitzer/IRAC, and at high resolution with VLT/CRIRES. By utilizing a novel\nretrieval algorithm capable of computing the joint probability distribution of\nlow- and high-resolution spectra, we obtain tight constraints on the chemical\ncomposition of the planet's atmosphere. In contrast to the WFC3 data, we do not\nconfidently detect H2O at high spectral resolution. The retrieved water\nabundance from the combined analysis deviates by 1.9 sigma from the\nexpectations for a solar-composition atmosphere in chemical equilibrium.\nMeasured relative molecular abundances of CO and H2O strongly favor an\noxygen-rich atmosphere (C/O<1 at 3.5 sigma) for the planet when compared to\nequilibrium calculations including O rainout. From the abundances of the seven\nmolecular species included in this study we constrain the planet metallicity to\n0.1-1.0x the stellar value (1 sigma). This study opens the way to coordinated\nexoplanet surveys between the flagship ground- and space-based facilities,\nwhich ultimately will be crucial for characterizing potentially-habitable\nplanets.\n", "  The paper deals with using chaos to direct trajectories to targets and\nanalyzes ruggedness and fractality of the resulting fitness landscapes. The\ntargeting problem is formulated as a dynamic fitness landscape and four\ndifferent chaotic maps generating such a landscape are studied. By using a\ncomputational approach, we analyze properties of the landscapes and quantify\ntheir fractal and rugged characteristics. In particular, it is shown that\nruggedness measures such as correlation length and information content are\nscale-invariant and self-similar.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have recently attracted attention as materials for\nflexible thermoelectric devices. To provide theoretical guideline of how\ndefects influence the thermoelectric performance of CNTs, we theoretically\nstudied the effects of defects (vacancies and Stone-Wales defects) on its\nthermoelectric properties; thermal conductance, electrical conductance, and\nSeebeck coefficient. The results revealed that the defects mostly strongly\nsuppresses the electron conductance, and deteriorates the thermoelectric\nperformance of a CNT. By plugging in the results and the intertube-junction\nproperties into the network model, we further show that the defects with\nrealistic concentrations can significantly degrade the thermoelectric\nperformance of CNT-based networks. Our findings indicate the importance of the\npurification of CNTs for improving CNT-based thermoelectrics.\n", "  We present a scalable hybrid architecture for the 2D surface code combining\nsuperconducting resonators and hole-spin qubits in nanowires with tunable\ndirect Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The back-bone of this architecture is a\nsquare lattice of capacitively coupled coplanar waveguide resonators each of\nwhich hosts a nanowire hole-spin qubit. Both the frequency of the qubits and\ntheir coupling to the microwave field are tunable by a static electric field\napplied via the resonator center pin. In the dispersive regime, an entangling\ntwo-qubit gate can be realized via a third order process, whereby a virtual\nphoton in one resonator is created by a first qubit, coherently transferred to\na neighboring resonator, and absorbed by a second qubit in that resonator.\nNumerical simulations with state-of-the-art coherence times yield gate\nfidelities approaching the $99\\%$ fault tolerance threshold.\n", "  The Lorentz-invariance-violating Weyl and Dirac fermions have recently\nattracted intensive interests as new types of particles beyond high-energy\nphysics, and they demonstrate novel physical phenomena such as angle-dependent\nchiral anomaly and topological Lifshitz transition. Here we predict the\nexistence of Lorentz-invariance-violating Dirac fermions in the YPd$_2$Sn class\nof Heusler alloys that emerge at the boundary between the electron-like and\nhole-like pockets in the Brillouin zone, based on the first-principles\nelectronic structure calculations. In combination with the fact that this class\nof materials was all reported to be superconductors, the YPd$_2$Sn class\nprovides an appropriate platform for studying exotic physical properties\ndistinguished from conventional Dirac fermions, especially for realizing\npossible topological superconductivity.\n", "  This work is devoted to the study of photon trajectories around rotating\nboson stars. The basic properties of boson star models are given with a\nparticular emphasis on the high compactness those objects can have. Using an\neffective potential method, circular orbits of photons around rotating boson\nstars are then obtained, at least for relativistic enough configurations. A\nparticular class of light rings, in which the photons are at rest on a stable\norbit, is exhibited. By this one means that the associated worldline is\ncollinear to the Killing vector corresponding to the asymptotic time\ntranslation symmetry. It is proposed to call those orbits light points. Their\nexistence is very specific to boson stars and the link between light points and\nergoregions is investigated.\n", "  We demonstrate an instrument for time-resolved magnetic imaging that is\nhighly sensitive to the in-plane magnetization state and dynamics of thin-film\nbilayers of yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12,YIG)/Pt: the time-resolved\nlongitudinal spin Seebeck (TRLSSE) effect microscope. We detect the local,\nin-plane magnetic orientation within the YIG by focusing a picosecond laser to\ngenerate thermally-driven spin current from the YIG into the Pt by the spin\nSeebeck effect, and then use the inverse spin Hall effect in the Pt to\ntransduce this spin current to an output voltage. To establish the time\nresolution of TRLSSE, we show that pulsed optical heating of patterned YIG (20\nnm)/Pt(6 nm)/Ru (2 nm) wires generates a magnetization-dependent voltage pulse\nof less than 100 ps. We demonstrate TRLSSE microscopy to image both static\nmagnetic structure and gigahertz-frequency magnetic resonance dynamics with\nsub-micron spatial resolution and a sensitivity to magnetic orientation below\n0.3$^{\\circ}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ in ultrathin YIG.\n", "  Comparison analyses between the gas emission data (HI 21cm line and CO 2.6 mm\nline) and the Planck/IRAS dust emission data (optical depth at 353 GHz tau353\nand dust temperature Td) allow us to estimate the amount and distribution of\nthe hydrogen gas more accurately, and our previous studies revealed the\nexistence of a large amount of optically-thick HI gas in the solar\nneighborhood. Referring to this, we discuss the neutral hydrogen gas around the\nPerseus cloud in the present paper. By using the J-band extinction data, we\nfound that tau353 increases as a function of the 1.3-th power of column number\ndensity of the total hydrogen (NH), and this implies dust evolution in high\ndensity regions. This calibrated tau353-NH relationship shows that the amount\nof the HI gas can be underestimated to be ~60% if the optically-thin HI method\nis used. Based on this relationship, we calculated optical depth of the 21 cm\nline (tauHI), and found that <tauHI> ~ 0.92 around the molecular cloud. The\neffect of tauHI is still significant even if we take into account the dust\nevolution. We also estimated a spatial distribution of the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor (XCO), and we found its average value is <XCO> ~ 1.0x10^20 cm-2 K-1 km-1\ns. Although these results are inconsistent with some previous studies, these\ndiscrepancies can be well explained by the difference of the data and analyses\nmethods.\n", "  Time--distance inversions usually provide tomographic maps of the interesting\nplasma properties (we will focus on flows) at various depths. These maps\nhowever do not correspond directly to the flow field, but rather to the true\nflow field smoothed by the averaging kernels. We introduce a method to derive a\nregularly gridded estimate of the true velocity field from the set of\ntomographic maps. We aim mainly to reconstruct the flow on a uniform grid in\nthe vertical domain. We derive the algorithm, implement it and validate using\nsynthetic data. The use of the synthetic data allows us to investigate the\ninfluence of random noise and to develop the methodology to deal with it\nproperly.\n", "  Context. X-ray spectral variability analyses of active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nwith moderate luminosities and redshifts typically show a softer when brighter\nbehaviour. Such a trend has rarely been investigated for high-luminosity AGNs\n($ L_{bol}\\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg/s), nor for a wider redshift range (e.g.\n$0\\lesssim z\\lesssim 5$). Aims. We present an analysis of spectral variability\nbased on a large sample of 2,700 quasars, measured at several different epochs,\nextracted from the fifth release of the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source\nCatalogue. Methods. We quantified the spectral variability through the\nparameter $\\beta$ defined as the ratio between the change in the photon index\n$\\Gamma$ and the corresponding logarithmic flux variation,\n$\\beta=-\\Delta\\Gamma/\\Delta\\log F_X$. Results. Our analysis confirms a softer\nwhen brighter behaviour for our sample, extending the previously found general\ntrend to high luminosity and redshift. We estimate an ensemble value of the\nspectral variability parameter $\\beta=-0.69\\pm0.03$. We do not find dependence\nof $\\beta$ on redshift, X-ray luminosity, black hole mass or Eddington ratio. A\nsubsample of radio-loud sources shows a smaller spectral variability parameter.\nThere is also some change with the X-ray flux, with smaller $\\beta$ (in\nabsolute value) for brighter sources. We also find significant correlations for\na small number of individual sources, indicating more negative values for some\nsources.\n", "  We study the Casimir friction phenomenon in a system consisting of two flat,\ninfinite, and parallel graphene sheets, which are coupled to the vacuum\nelectromagnetic (EM) field. Those couplings are implemented, in the description\nwe use, by means of specific terms in the effective action for the EM field.\nThey incorporate the distinctive properties of graphene, as well as the\nrelative sliding motion of the sheets. Based on this description, we evaluate\ntwo observables due to the same physical effect: the probability of vacuum\ndecay and the frictional force. The system exhibits a threshold for frictional\neffects, namely, they only exist if the speed of the sliding motion is larger\nthan the Fermi velocity of the charge carriers in graphene.\n", "  The expansion of HII regions can trigger the formation of stars. An\noverdensity of young stellar objects (YSOs) is observed at the edges of HII\nregions but the mechanisms that give rise to this phenomenon are not clearly\nidentified. Moreover, it is difficult to establish a causal link between\nHII-region expansion and the star formation observed at the edges of these\nregions. A clear age gradient observed in the spatial distribution of young\nsources in the surrounding might be a strong argument in favor of triggering.\nWe have observed the Galactic HII region RCW120 with herschel PACS and SPIRE\nphotometers at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500$\\mu$m. We produced temperature\nand H$_2$ column density maps and use the getsources algorithm to detect\ncompact sources and measure their fluxes at herschel wavelengths. We have\ncomplemented these fluxes with existing infrared data. Fitting their spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) with a modified blackbody model, we derived their\nenvelope dust temperature and envelope mass. We computed their bolometric\nluminosities and discuss their evolutionary stages. The herschel data, with\ntheir unique sampling of the far infrared domain, have allowed us to\ncharacterize the properties of compact sources observed towards RCW120 for the\nfirst time. We have also been able to determine the envelope temperature,\nenvelope mass and evolutionary stage of these sources. Using these properties\nwe have shown that the density of the condensations that host star formation is\na key parameter of the star-formation history, irrespective of their projected\ndistance to the ionizing stars.\n", "  Different proposals for adiabatic quantum motors (AQMs) driven by DC currents\nhave recently attracted considerable interest. However, the systems studied are\noften based on simplified models with highly ideal conditions where the\nenvironment is neglected. Here, we investigate the performance (dynamics,\nefficiency, and output power) of a prototypical AQM, the Thouless motor. To\ninclude the effect of the surroundings on this type of AQMs, we extended our\nprevious theory of decoherence in current-induced forces (CIFs) to account for\nspatially distributed decoherent processes. We provide analytical expressions\nthat account for decoherence in CIFs, friction coefficients and the\nself-correlation functions of the CIFs. We prove that the model is\nthermodynamically consistent and we find that decoherence drastically reduces\nthe efficiency of the motor mainly due to the increase in conductance, while\nits effect on the output power is not much relevant. The effect of decoherence\non the current-induced friction depends on the length of the system, reducing\nthe friction for small systems while increasing it for long ones. Finally, we\nfind that reflections of the electrons at the boundary of the system induce\nadditional conservative forces that affect the dynamics of the motor. In\nparticular, this results in the hysteresis of the system and a voltage\ndependent switching.\n", "  We are using entanglement entropy approach to study how the entropy depends\nupon the location of degrees of freedom near and far from the horizon. We\nconsider quantum fields in the vicinity of black holes space-time, the entropy\nreceives log- arithmic and power law corrections in area law. The power law\ncorrections arises when the fields are in excited or mixed state (superposition\nof ground and excited state)a but logarithmic corrections are present in ground\nstate. In this paper, we try to understand physically the deviation from the\narea law for the excited and mixed state. We show that the degrees of freedom\nnear to the horizon contribute the total entropy, but when degrees of freedom\nfar away from the horizon are more significant for excited/mixed state instead\nof ground state.\n", "  A general field-theoretic framework for the treatment of liquid-gas phase\ntransitions is developed. Starting from a fundamental four-dimensional field\ntheory at nonzero temperature and density, an effective three-dimensional field\ntheory with a sign problem is derived. Although charge conjugation\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is broken at finite density, there remains a symmetry under\n$\\mathcal{CK}$, where $\\mathcal{K}$ is complex conjugation. We consider four\nmodels: relativistic fermions, nonrelativistic fermions, static fermions and\nclassical particles. The thermodynamic behavior is extracted from\n$\\mathcal{CK}$-symmetric complex saddle points of the effective field theory at\ntree level. The relativistic and static fermions show a liquid-gas transition,\nmanifesting as a first-order line at low temperature and high density,\nterminated by a critical end point. In the cases of nonrelativistic fermions\nand classical particles, we find no first-order liquid-gas transitions at tree\nlevel. The mass matrix controlling the behavior of correlation functions is\nobtained from fluctuations around the saddle points. Due to the $\\mathcal{CK}$\nsymmetry of the models, the eigenvalues of the mass matrix can be complex. This\nleads to the existence of disorder lines, which mark the boundaries where the\neigenvalues go from purely real to complex. The regions where the mass matrix\neigenvalues are complex are associated with the critical line. In the case of\nstatic fermions, a powerful duality between particles and holes allows for the\nanalytic determination of both the critical line and the disorder lines.\nDepending on the values of the parameters, either zero, one or two disorder\nlines are found. Numerical results for relativistic fermions give a very\nsimilar picture.\n", "  T2K reports its first results in the search for CP violation in neutrino\noscillations using appearance and disappearance channels for neutrino- and\nantineutrino-mode beam. The data include all runs from Jan 2010 to May 2016 and\ncomprise $7.482\\times10^{20}$,protons on target in neutrino mode, which yielded\nin the far detector 32 e-like and 135 $\\mu$-like events, and\n$7.471\\times10^{20}$,protons on target in antineutrino mode which yielded 4\ne-like and 66 $\\mu$-like events. Reactor measurements of $\\sin^{2}2\\theta_{13}$\nhave been used as an additional constraint. The one-dimensional confidence\ninterval at 90% for $\\delta_{CP}$ spans the range ($-3.13$, $-0.39$) for normal\nmass ordering. The CP conservation hypothesis ($\\delta_{CP}=0,\\pi$) is excluded\nat 90% C.L.\n", "  Context. The disc instability model (DIM) successfully explains why many\naccreting compact binary systems exhibit outbursts, during which their\nluminosity increases by orders of magnitude. The DIM correctly predicts which\nsystems should be transient and works regardless of whether the accretor is a\nblack hole, a neutron star or a white dwarf. However, it has been known for\nsome time that the outbursts of X-ray binaries (which contain neutron-star or\nblack-hole accretors) exhibit hysteresis in the X-ray hardness-intensity\ndiagram (HID). More recently, it has been shown that the outbursts of accreting\nwhite dwarfs also show hysteresis, but in a diagram combining optical, EUV and\nX-ray fluxes.\n  Aims. We examine here the nature of the hysteresis observed in cataclysmic\nvariables and low-mass X-ray binaries.\n  Methods. We use the Hameury et al. (1998) code for modelling dwarf nova\noutbursts, and construct the hardness intensity diagram as predicted by the\ndisc instability model.\n  Results. We show explicitly that the standard DIM - modified only to account\nfor disc truncation - can explain the hysteresis observed in accreting white\ndwarfs, but cannot explain that observed in X-ray binaries.\n  Conclusions. The spectral evidence for the existence of different accretion\nregimes / components (disc, corona, jets, etc.) should be based only on\nwavebands that are specific to the innermost parts of the discs, i.e. EUV and\nX-rays, which is a difficult task because of interstellar absorption. The\nexisting data, however, indicate that an EUV/X-ray hysteresis is present in SS\nCyg.\n", "  Background: Large $\\alpha$ yields have been reported over the years in\nreactions with $^{6}$Li and $^{7}$Li projectiles. Previous theoretical analyses\nhave shown that the elastic breakup (EBU) mechanism (i.e., projectile breakup\nleaving the target in its ground state) is able to account only for a small\nfraction of the total $\\alpha$ inclusive breakup cross sections, pointing\ntoward the dominance of non-elastic breakup (NEB) mechanisms.\n  Purpose: We aim to provide a systematic study of the $\\alpha$ inclusive cross\nsections observed in nuclear reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. In\naddition to estimating the total $\\alpha$ singles cross sections, it is our\ngoal to evaluate angular and energy distributions of these $\\alpha$ particles\nand compare with experimental data, when available.\n  Method: We compute separately the EBU and NEB components of the inclusive\nbreakup cross sections. For the former, we use the continuum-discretized\ncoupled-channels (CDCC) method, which treats this mechanism to all orders. For\nthe NEB part, we employ the the model proposed in the eighties by Ichimura,\nAustern and Vincent [Phys. Rev. C32, 432 (1982)], within the DWBA\napproximation.\n  Results: Overall, the sum of the computed EBU and NEB cross sections is found\nto reproduce very well the measured singles cross sections. In all cases\nanalyzed, we find that the inclusive breakup cross section is largely dominated\nby the NEB component.\n  Conclusions: The presented method provides a global and systematic\ndescription of inclusive breakup reactions induced by $^{6}$Li projectiles. It\nprovides also a natural explanation of the previously observed underestimation\nof the measured $\\alpha$ yields by CDCC calculations. The method used here can\nbe extended to other weakly-bound projectiles, including halo nuclei.\n", "  A very light boson of mass $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-22})$ eV may potentially be a\nviable dark matter (DM) candidate which can avoid phenomenological problems\nassociated with cold DM. Such \"fuzzy DM (FDM)\" may naturally be an axion with a\ndecay constant $f_a \\sim 10^{16} \\div 10^{18}$ GeV, and a mass $m_a \\sim\n\\mu^2/f_a$ with $\\mu\\sim 10^2$ eV. Here we propose a concrete model where $\\mu$\narises as a dynamical scale from infrared confining dynamics, analogous to QCD.\nOur model is an alternative to the usual approach of generating $\\mu$ through\nstring theoretic instanton effects. We outline the features of this scenario\nthat result from various cosmological constraints. We find that those\nconstraints are suggestive of a period of mild of inflation, perhaps from a\nstrong first order phase transition, that reheats the Standard Model (SM)\nsector only. A typical prediction of our scenario, broadly speaking, is a\nlarger effective number of neutrinos compared to the SM value $N_{\\text{eff}}\n\\approx 3$, as inferred from precision measurements of the cosmic microwave\nbackground. Some of the new degrees of freedom may be identified as \"sterile\nneutrinos,\" which may be required to explain certain neutrino oscillation\nanomalies. Hence, aspects of our scenario could be testable in terrestrial\nexperiments, which is a novelty of our FDM model.\n", "  Spontaneous emission of a two--level atom in free space is modified by other\natoms in its vicinity leading to super- and sub-radiance. In particular, for\natomic distances closer than the transition wavelength the maximally entangled\nantisymmetric superposition state of two individually excited atomic dipole\nmoments possesses no total dipole moment and will not decay spontaneously at\nall. Such a two-atom dark state does not exist, if the atoms possess\nalternative decay channels towards other atomic lower energy states. However,\nwe show here that for any atomic state with $N-1$ independent spontaneous decay\nchannels one can always find a $N$-particle highly entangled state, which\ncompletely decouples from the free radiation field and does not decay.\nMoreover, we show that this state is the unique state orthogonal to the\nsubspace spanned by the lower energy states with this property. Its sub-radiant\nproperty largely survives at finite atomic distances.\n", "  The surprising simplicity of Barvinsky-Nesterov or equivalently\nGelfand-Yaglom methods of calculation of quantum determinants permits to obtain\ncompact expressions for UV-finite difference of one-loop quantum energies for\ntwo arbitrary values of parameter of the double-trace asymptotic boundary\nconditions. This result generalizes Gubser and Mitra calculation for particular\ncase of difference of \"regular\" and \"irregular\" one-loop energies in one-brane\nRS-model. Approach developed in the paper also allows to get \"in one line\" the\none-loop quantum energies in two-brane RS-model. The relationship between\n\"one-loop\" expressions corresponding to mixed Robin and to double-trace\nasymptotic boundary conditions is traced.\n", "  The B-model approach of topological string theory leads to difference\nequations by quantizing algebraic mirror curves. It is known that these quantum\nmechanical systems are solved by the refined topological strings. Recently, it\nwas pointed out that the quantum eigenvalue problem for a particular\nCalabi--Yau manifold, known as local $\\mathbb{F}_0$, is closely related to the\nHofstadter problem for electrons on a two-dimensional square lattice. In this\npaper, we generalize this idea to a more complicated Calabi--Yau manifold. We\nfind that the local $\\mathcal{B}_3$ geometry, which is a three-point blow-up of\nlocal $\\mathbb{P}^2$, is associated with electrons on a triangular lattice.\nThis correspondence allows us to use known results in condensed matter physics\nto investigate the quantum geometry of the toric Calabi--Yau manifold.\n", "  We report the results of a study of neutrino-carbon interactions at beam\nenergies ranging between few hundreds MeV and few tens of GeV, carried out\nwithin the framework of the impulse approximation using a realistic spectral\nfunction. The contributions of quasi elastic scattering, resonance production\nand deep inelastic scattering---consistently obtained, for first time, from a\nmodel based on a realistic description of the nuclear ground state---are\ncompared and analyzed.\n", "  We study the exciton magnetic polaron (EMP) formation in (Cd,Mn)Se/(Cd,Mg)Se\ndiluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum wells using time-resolved\nphotoluminescence (PL). The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of this\ndynamics allow us to separate the non-magnetic and magnetic contributions to\nthe exciton localization. We deduce the EMP energy of 14 meV, which is in\nagreement with time-integrated measurements based on selective excitation and\nthe magnetic field dependence of the PL circular polarization degree. The\npolaron formation time of 500 ps is significantly longer than the corresponding\nvalues reported earlier. We propose that this behavior is related to strong\nself-localization of the EMP, accompanied with a squeezing of the heavy-hole\nenvelope wavefunction. This conclusion is also supported by the decrease of the\nexciton lifetime from 600 ps to 200 - 400 ps with increasing magnetic field and\ntemperature.\n", "  An unexpectedly slow evolution in the pre-optical-maximum phase was suggested\nin the very short recurrence period nova M31N 2008-12a. To obtain reasonable\nnova light curves we have improved our calculation method by consistently\ncombining optically thick wind solutions of hydrogen-rich envelopes with white\ndwarf (WD) structures calculated by a Henyey-type evolution code. The wind mass\nloss rate is properly determined with high accuracy. We have calculated light\ncurve models for 1.2 and 1.38 M_sun WDs with mass accretion rates corresponding\nto recurrence periods of 10 and 1 yr, respectively. The outburst lasts 590/29\ndays in which the pre-optical-maximum phase is 82/16 days, for 1.2/1.38 M_sun,\nrespectively. Optically thick winds start at the end of X-ray flash and cease\nat the beginning of supersoft X-ray phase. We also present supersoft X-ray\nlight curves including a prompt X-ray flash and later supersoft X-ray phase.\n", "  Magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonances are an indispensable tool for\nexperiments with atomic quantum gases. We report on twenty thus far unpublished\nFeshbach resonances and twenty one further probable Feshbach resonances in spin\nmixtures of ultracold fermionic 40 K with temperatures well below 100 nK. In\nparticular, we locate a broad resonance at B=389.6 G with a magnetic width of\n26.4 G. Here 1 G=10^-4 T. Furthermore, by exciting low-energy spin waves, we\ndemonstrate a novel means to precisely determine the zero crossing of the\nscattering length for this broad Feshbach resonance. Our findings allow for\nfurther tunability in experiments with ultracold 40 K quantum gases.\n", "  The structure and static magnetic properties - saturation magnetization,\nperpendicular anisotropy, spectroscopic g-factor, and orbital magnetization -\nof thin-film 3d transition metal alloys are determined over the full range of\nalloy compositions via X-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and ferromagnetic\nresonance measurements. We determine the interfacial perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy by use of samples sets with varying thickness for specific alloy\nconcentrations. The results agree with prior published data and theoretical\npredictions. They provide a comprehensive compilation of the magnetic\nproperties of thin-film Ni-Co, Ni-Fe and Co-Fe alloys that goes well beyond the\noften-cited Slater-Pauling dependence of magnetic moment on alloy\nconcentration.\n", "  Following numerous earlier studies, extensive simulations and analyses were\nmade on the continuous interaction distribution Gaussian model and the discrete\nbimodal interaction distribution Ising Spin Glass (ISG) models in dimension two\n(P.H. Lundow and I.A. Campbell, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 93}, 022119 (2016)). Here we\nfurther analyse the bimodal and Gaussian data together with data on two other\ncontinuous interaction distribution 2D ISG models, the uniform and the\nLaplacian models, and three other discrete interaction distribution models, a\ndiluted bimodal model, an \"anti-diluted\" model, and a more exotic symmetric\nPoisson model. Comparisons between the three continuous distribution models\nshow that not only do they share the same exponent $\\eta \\equiv 0$ but that to\nwithin the present numerical precision they share the same critical exponent\n$\\nu$ also, and so lie in a single universality class. On the other hand the\ncritical exponents of the four discrete distribution models are not the same as\nthose of the continuous distributions, and differ from one discrete\ndistribution model to another. Discrete distribution ISG models in dimension\ntwo have non-zero values of the critical exponent $\\eta$; they do not lie in a\nsingle universality class.\n", "  A method to compute the optimal success probability of discrimination of N\narbitrary quantum states is presented, based on the decomposition of any\nN-outcome measurement into sequences of nested two-outcome ones. In this way\nthe optimization of the measurement operators can be carried out in successive\nsteps, optimizing first the binary measurements at the deepest nesting level\nand then moving on to those at higher levels. We obtain an analytical\nexpression for the maximum success probability after the first optimization\nstep and examine its form for the specific case of N=3,4 states of a qubit. In\nthis case, at variance with previous proposals, we are able to provide a\ncompact expression for the success probability of any set of states, whose\nnumerical optimization is straightforward; the results thus obtained highlight\nsome lesser-known features of the discrimination problem.\n", "  We present an optical (gri) study during quiescence of the accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsar IGR J00291+5934 performed with the 10.4m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias (GTC) in August 2014. Despite the source being in\nquiescence at the time of our observations, it showed a strong optical flaring\nactivity, more pronounced at higher frequencies (i.e. the g band). Once the\nflares were subtracted, we tentatively recovered a sinusoidal modulation at the\nsystem orbital period in all bands, even if a significant phase shift with\nrespect to an irradiated star, typical of accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars\nis detected. We conclude that the observed flaring could be a manifestation of\nthe presence of an accretion disc in the system. The observed light curve\nvariability could be explained by the presence of a superhump, which might be\nanother proof of the formation of an accretion disc. In particular, the disc at\nthe time of our observations was probably preparing to the new outburst of the\nsource, that happened just a few months later, in 2015.\n", "  We use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the statistical challenges of\nconstraining the characteristic mass ($m_c$) and width ($\\sigma$) of a\nlognormal sub-solar initial mass function (IMF) in Local Group dwarf galaxies\nusing direct star counts. For a typical Milky Way (MW) satellite ($M_{V} =\n-8$), jointly constraining $m_c$ and $\\sigma$ to a precision of $\\lesssim 20\\%$\nrequires that observations be complete to $\\lesssim 0.2 M_{\\odot}$, if the IMF\nis similar to the MW IMF. A similar statistical precision can be obtained if\nobservations are only complete down to $0.4M_{\\odot}$, but this requires\nmeasurement of nearly 100$\\times$ more stars, and thus, a significantly more\nmassive satellite ($M_{V} \\sim -12$). In the absence of sufficiently deep data\nto constrain the low-mass turnover, it is common practice to fit a\nsingle-sloped power law to the low-mass IMF, or to fit $m_c$ for a lognormal\nwhile holding $\\sigma$ fixed. We show that the former approximation leads to\nbest-fit power law slopes that vary with the mass range observed and can\nlargely explain existing claims of low-mass IMF variations in MW satellites,\neven if satellite galaxies have the same IMF as the MW. In addition, fixing\n$\\sigma$ during fitting leads to substantially underestimated uncertainties in\nthe recovered value of $m_c$ (by a factor of $\\sim 4$ for typical\nobservations). If the IMFs of nearby dwarf galaxies are lognormal and do vary,\nobservations must reach down to $\\sim m_c$ in order to robustly detect these\nvariations. The high-sensitivity, near-infrared capabilities of JWST and WFIRST\nhave the potential to dramatically improve constraints on the low-mass IMF. We\npresent an efficient observational strategy for using these facilities to\nmeasure the IMFs of Local Group dwarf galaxies.\n", "  A systematic experimental study of Gilbert damping is performed via\nferromagnetic resonance for the disordered crystalline binary 3d transition\nmetal alloys Ni-Co, Ni-Fe and Co-Fe over the full range of alloy compositions.\nAfter accounting for inhomogeneous linewidth broadening, the damping shows\nclear evidence of both interfacial damping enhancement (by spin pumping) and\nradiative damping. We quantify these two extrinsic contributions and thereby\ndetermine the intrinsic damping. The comparison of the intrinsic damping to\nmultiple theoretical calculations yields good qualitative and quantitative\nagreement in most cases. Furthermore, the values of the damping obtained in\nthis study are in good agreement with a wide range of published experimental\nand theoretical values. Additionally, we find a compositional dependence of the\nspin mixing conductance.\n", "  This work reports new experimental radiative lifetimes and calculated\noscillator strengths for transitions from 3d8 4d levels of astrophysical\ninterest in singly ionized nickel. Radiative lifetimes of seven high-lying\nlevels of even parity in Ni II (98400 -100600 cm-1) have been measured using\nthe time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence method. Two-step photon excitation\nof ions produced by laser ablation has been utilized to populate the levels.\nTheoretical calculations of the radiative lifetimes of the measured levels and\ntransition probabilities from these levels are reported. The calculations have\nbeen performed using a pseudo-relativistic Hartree-Fock method, taking into\naccount core polarization effects. A new set of transition probabilities and\noscillator strengths has been deduced for 477 Ni II transitions of\nastrophysical interest in the spectral range 194 - 520 nm depopulating even\nparity 3d8 4d levels. The new calculated gf-values are, on the average, about\n20 % higher than a previous calculation by Kurucz (http://kurucz.harvard.edu)\nand yield lifetimes within 5 % of the experimental values.\n", "  We compute a subset of three, velocity-independent four-loop (and fourth\npost-Newtonian) contributions to the harmonic-coordinates effective action of a\ngravitationally interacting system of two point-masses. We find that, after\nsumming the three terms, the coefficient of the total contribution is rational,\ndue to a remarkable cancellation between the various occurrences of $\\pi^2$.\nThis result, obtained by a classical field-theory calculation, corrects the\nrecent effective-field-theory-based calculation by Foffa et al.\n[arXiv:1612.00482]. Besides showing the usefulness of the saddle-point approach\nto the evaluation of the effective action, and of x-space computations, our\nresult brings a further confirmation of the current knowledge of the fourth\npost-Newtonian effective action. We also show how the use of the generalized\nRiesz formula [Phys. Rev. D 57, 7274 (1998)] allows one to analytically compute\na certain four-loop scalar master integral (represented by a four-spoked wheel\ndiagram) which was, so far, only numerically computed.\n", "  We discuss scalar-tensor realizations of the Anamorphic cosmological scenario\nrecently proposed by Ijjas and Steinhardt. Through an analysis of the dynamics\nof cosmological perturbations we obtain constraints on the parameters of the\nmodel. We also study gravitational Parker particle production in the\ncontracting Anamorphic phase and we compute the fraction between the energy\ndensity of created particles at the end of the phase and the background energy\ndensity. We find that, as in the case of inflation, a new mechanism is required\nto reheat the universe.\n", "  We present results from a Near Infrared multi-epoch spectroscopic campaign to\ndetect a young low-mass companion to a T Tauri star. AS 205A is a late-type\ndwarf (~K5) of ~1 Msun that belongs to a triple system. Independent photometric\nsurveys discovered that AS 205A has two distinct periods (P1=6.78 and P2=24.78\ndays) detected in the light curve that persist over several years. Period P1\nseems to be linked to the axial-rotation of the star and is caused by the\npresence of cool surface spots. Period P2 is correlated with the modulation in\nAS 205A brightness (V) and red color (V-R), consistent with a gravitating\nobject within the accretion disk. We here derive precise Near Infrared radial\nvelocities to investigate the origin of period P2 which is predicted to\ncorrespond to a cool source in a Keplerian orbit with a semi-major axis of\n~0.17 AU positioned close to the inner disk radius of 0.14 AU. The radial\nvelocity variations of AS 205A were found to have a period of P ~ 24.84 days\nand a semi-amplitude of 1.529 kms-1. This result closely resembles the P2\nperiod in past photometric observations (P ~ 24.78 days). The analysis of the\ncross-correlation function bisector has shown no correlation with the radial\nvelocity modulations, strongly suggesting that the period is not controlled by\nstellar rotation. Additional activity indicators should however be explored in\nfuture surveys. Taking this into account we found that the presence of a\nsubstellar companion is the explanation that best fits the results. We derived\nan orbital solution for AS 205A and found evidence of a m2sini 19.25 MJup\nobject in an orbit with moderate eccentricity of e~0.34. If confirmed with\nfuture observations, preferably using a multiwavelength survey approach, this\ncompanion could provide interesting constraints on brown dwarf and planetary\nformation models.\n", "  Macronovae (kilonovae) that arise in binary neutron star mergers are powered\nby radioactive beta decay of hundreds of $r$-process nuclides. We derive, using\nFermi's theory of beta decay, an analytic estimate of the nuclear heating rate.\nWe show that the heating rate evolves as a power law ranging between $t^{-6/5}$\nto $t^{-4/3}$. The overall magnitude of the heating rate is determined by the\nmean values of nuclear quantities, e.g., the nuclear matrix elements of beta\ndecay. These values are specified by using nuclear experimental data. We\ndiscuss the role of higher order beta transitions and the robustness of the\npower law. The robust and simple form of the heating rate suggests that\nobservations of the late-time bolometric light curve $\\propto t^{-\\frac{4}{3}}$\nwould be a direct evidence of a $r$-process driven macronova. Such observations\ncould also enable us to estimate the total amount of $r$-process nuclei\nproduced in the merger.\n", "  We study the Majorana surface states of higher-spin topological\nsuperconductors (TSCs) that could be realized in ultracold atomic systems or\ndoped semimetals with spin-orbit coupling. As a paradigmatic example, we\nconsider a model with p-wave pairing of spin-3/2 fermions that generalizes\n${}^3\\text{He-}B$. This model has coexisting linear and cubic dispersing\nMajorana surface bands. We show that these are unstable to interactions, which\ncan generate a spontaneous surface thermal quantum Hall effect (TQHE). By\ncontrast, nonmagnetic quenched disorder induces a surface conformal field\ntheory (CFT) that is stable against weak interactions: topological protection\nis enhanced by disorder. Gapless surface states of higher-spin TSCs could\ntherefore be robustly realized in solid state systems, where disorder is\ninevitable. The surface CFT is characterized by universal signatures that\ndepend only on the bulk topological winding number, and include power-law\nscaling of the density of states, a universal multifractal spectrum of local\ndensity of states fluctuations, and a quantized ratio of the longitudinal\nthermal conductivity $\\kappa_{xx}$ divided by temperature $T$. By contrast,\n$\\kappa_{xx}/T$ for the clean surface without TQHE order would diverge as $T\n\\rightarrow 0$. Since disorder stabilizes the conducting Majorana surface fluid\nand quantizes thermal transport, our results suggest a close analogy between\nbulk TSCs and the integer quantum Hall effect.\n", "  The majority of hot subdwarf stars are low-mass core-helium-burning stars.\nTheir atmospheres are generally helium deficient; however a minority have\nextremely helium-rich surfaces. An additional fraction have an intermediate\nsurface-helium abundance, occasionally accompanied by peculiar abundances of\nother elements. We have identified a sample of 88 hot subdwarfs including 38\nhelium-deficient, 27 intermediate-helium and 23 extreme-helium stars for which\nradial-velocity and proper-motion measurements, together with distances, allow\na calculation of Galactic space velocities. We have investigated the kinematics\nof these three groups to determine whether they belong to similar or different\ngalactic populations. The majority of helium-deficient subdwarfs in our sample\nshow a kinematic distribution similar to that of thick disk stars. Helium-rich\nsdBs show a more diverse kinematic distribution. Although the majority are\nprobably disk stars, a minority show a much higher velocity dispersion\nconsistent with membership of a Galactic halo population. Several of the halo\nsubd- warfs are members of the class of \"heavy-metal\" subdwarfs discovered by\nNaslim et al. (2011, 2013).\n", "  We explore heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven winds from\nrapidly-rotating, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars for which the\nmagnetic dipole is aligned with the rotation axis, and the field is assumed to\nbe a static force-free configuration. We process the proto-magnetar wind\ntrajectories calculated by Vlasov et al 2014 through the r-process nuclear\nreaction network SkyNet using contemporary models for the evolution of the wind\nelectron fraction during the proto-neutron star cooling phase. Although we do\nnot find a successful second or third peak r-process for any rotation period P,\nwe show that proto-magnetars with P around 1-5 ms produce heavy element\nabundance distributions that extend to higher nuclear mass number than from\notherwise equivalent spherical winds (with the mass fractions of some elements\nenhanced by factors of 100-1000). The heaviest elements are synthesized by\noutflows emerging along flux tubes which graze the closed zone and pass near\nthe equatorial plane outside the light cylinder. Due to dependence of the\nnucleosynthesis pattern on the magnetic field strength and rotation rate of the\nproto-neutron star, natural variations in these quantities between core\ncollapse events could contribute to the observed diversity of the abundances of\nweak r-process nuclei in metal-poor stars. Further diversity, including\npossibly even a successful third-peak r-process, could be achieved for\nmisaligned rotators with non-zero magnetic inclination with respect to the\nrotation axis. If proto-magnetars are central engines for GRBs, their\nrelativistic jets should contain a high mass fraction of heavy nuclei of\ncharacteristic average mass number A of order 100, providing a possible source\nfor ultra-high energy cosmic rays comprised of heavy nuclei with an energy\nspectrum that extends beyond the nominal GZK cut-off for protons or iron\nnuclei.\n", "  Electromagnetic materials possessing parity-time symmetry have received\nsignificant attention since it was discovered that the eigenmodes of these\nmaterials possess either real-frequency eigenvalues or the eigenfrequencies\nappear in complex-conjugate pairs. Interestingly, some eigenstates of these\nsystems show thresholdless $\\mathcal{PT}$ transitions to the complex-conjugate\nregime, some exhibit a transition as a function of the degree of\nnon-Hermiticity and some show no $\\mathcal{PT}$ transition at all. While\nprevious work has provided some insight on the nature of $\\mathcal{PT}$\ntransitions, this work lays out a general and rigorous mathematical framework\nthat is able to predict, based on symmetry alone, whether an eigenmode will\nexhibit a thresholdless $\\mathcal{PT}$ transition or no $\\mathcal{PT}$\ntransition at all. Developed within the context of ferromagnetic solids,\nHeesh-Shubnikov group theory is an extension of classical group theory that is\napplicable to antiunitary operators. This work illustrates the Heesh-Shubnikov\napproach by categorizing the modes of a two-dimensionally periodic photonic\nlattice that possesses $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.\n", "  The new recurrent X-ray transient MAXI J1957+032 has had four X-ray outbursts\nwithin 16 months, all very briefly detected (lasting <5 days). During the most\nrecent event (Sep/Oct 2016), we obtained with SALT the first optical spectrum\nof the transient counterpart, showing the classic blue continuum of an X-ray\nirradiated disc in an LMXB and no other features. At high Galactic latitude\nbelow the plane (-13 deg) reddening is low but there is no quiescent\ncounterpart visible on any of the existing sky surveys, nor any other known\nX-ray source in the region. Swift monitoring of 3 of the 4 events is presented,\nshowing rapidly fading X-ray outbursts together with significant UVOT\ndetections in the UV (W1,M2,W2), U and B bands. The optical properties are most\nlike those of the short-period LMXBs, which, combined with the softening\nwitnessed during the decay to quiescence would place the system at d <13 kpc.\nThe short duration and short recurrence time of the outbursts are reminiscent\nof the AMXPs, which exhibit peak luminosities of 1 % L_Edd. Assuming this peak\nluminosity would place MAXI J1957+032 at a distance of d= 5-6 kpc.\n", "  A general theory of pseudomagnetic effects for the propagation of polarized\nneutrons through polarized target in multi resonance approach is presented.\nSome applications related to the proposed search for time reversal invariance\nviolation in neutron scattering are considered.\n", "  Beryllium (Be) is an important material with wide applications ranging from\naerospace components to X-ray equipments. Yet a precise understanding of its\nphase diagram remains elusive. We have investigated the phase stability of Be\nusing a recently developed hybrid free energy computation method that accounts\nfor anharmonic effects by invoking phonon quasiparticles. We find that the hcp\nto bcc transition occurs near the melting curve at 0<P<11 GPa with a positive\nClapeyron slope of 41 K/GPa. The bcc phase exists in a narrow temperature range\nthat shrinks with increasing pressure, explaining the difficulty in observing\nthis phase experimentally. This work also demonstrates the validity of this\ntheoretical framework based on phonon quasiparticle to study structural\nstability and phase transitions in strongly anharmonic materials.\n", "  We study the low-temperature behavior of antiferromagnets in two spatial\ndimensions that are subjected to a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the\nstaggered magnetization order parameter. The evaluation of the partition\nfunction is carried to two-loop order within the systematic effective\nLagrangian technique. Low-temperature series that are valid in weak magnetic\nand staggered fields are derived for the pressure, staggered magnetization, and\nmagnetization. Remarkably, at $T$=0, the staggered magnetization is enhanced by\nthe magnetic field, implying that the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis also\nemerges in antiferromagnetic films.\n", "  We consider a minimal renormalizable and gauge invariant dark matter (DM)\nmodel, in which the singlet fermion DM has only axial couplings to a new\npseudoscalar mediator. The mixing between the pseudoscalar mediator and the\nstandard model (SM) Higgs boson induces the interactions between the DM and SM\nparticles. The DM candidate in this model can provide the correct thermal relic\ndensity and evades all direct detections, while it can produce observable\nsignals in indirect detection experiments due to its large annihilation cross\nsection. A comparative study for DM phenomenology at the LHC is conducted for\nmodels with scalar mediators that have either scalar or pseudoscalar couplings\nto SM particles and the DM. We find that the three scenarios have\ndistinguishable features in scalar decay branching ratio, DM pair production\ncross section as well as the signal reaches at the LHC. The LHC searches for\nsome visible signals related to the scalar sector are also discussed.\n", "  Modeling stellar atmospheres is a complex, intriguing task in modern\nastronomy. A systematic comparison of models with multi-technique observations\nis the only efficient way to constrain them. Aims: We performed a\nself-consistent modeling of the atmospheres of six C-rich AGB stars: R Lep, R\nVol, Y Pav, AQ Sgr, U Hya and X TrA, with the aim of enlarging the knowledge of\nthe dynamic processes occurring in their atmospheres. Methods. We used\nVLTI/MIDI interferometric observations, in combination with spectro-photometric\ndata, and compared them with self-consistent dynamic models atmospheres.\nResults: The models can reproduce SED data well at wavelengths longwards of\n1{\\mu}m, and the interferometric observations between 8{\\mu}m and 10{\\mu}m.\nDiscrepancies could be due to a combination of data- and model-related effects.\nThe models best fitting the Miras are significantly extended, with a prominent\nshell-like structure, while the models best fitting the non-Miras are more\ncompact, showing lower average mass-loss. The mass loss is of episodic or\nmulti-periodic nature, but causes the visual amplitudes to be notably larger\nthan the observed ones. Stellar parameters were derived from the model fitting:\nT_eff, L_bol, M, C/O, $\\dot{\\text{M}}$. Our findings agree well with literature\nvalues within the uncertainties. T_eff and L_bol are also in good agreement\nwith the T derived from the angular diameter {\\theta}_{(V-K)} and L_bol from\nthe SED fitting, except for AQ Sgr. Finally, {\\theta}_Ross and {\\theta}_(V-K)\nagree with each other better for the Miras than for the non-Miras,which is\nprobably connected to the episodic nature of the latter models. We also located\nthe stars in the H-R diagram, comparing them with evolutionary tracks. We found\nthat the main derived properties from the model fitting are in good agreement\nwith TP-AGB evolutionary calculations for carbon stars (COLIBRI code).\n", "  Quantum resonant activation is investigated for the archetype setup of an\nexternally driven two-state (spin-boson) system subjected to strong dissipation\nby means of both analytical and extensive numerical calculations. The\nphenomenon of resonant activation emerges in the presence of either randomly\nfluctuating or deterministic periodically varying driving fields. Addressing\nthe incoherent regime, a characteristic minimum emerges in the mean first\npassage time to reach an absorbing neighboring state whenever the intrinsic\ntime scale of the modulation matches the characteristic time scale of the\nsystem dynamics. For the case of deterministic periodic driving, the first\npassage time probability density function (pdf) displays a complex,\nmulti-peaked behavior, which depends crucially on the details of initial phase,\nfrequency, and strength of the driving. As an interesting feature we find that\nthe mean first passage time enters the resonant activation regime at a critical\nfrequency $\\nu^*$ which depends very weakly on the strength of the driving.\nMoreover, we provide the relation between the first passage time pdf and the\nstatistics of residence times.\n", "  Increasing the collection efficiency from solid-state emitters is an\nimportant step towards achieving robust single photon sources, as well as\noptically connecting different nodes of quantum hardware. A metallic substrate\nmay be the most basic method of improving the collection of photons from\nquantum dots, with predicted collection efficiency increases of up to 50%. The\nestablished 'method-of-images' approach models the effects of a reflective\nsurface for atomic and molecular emitters by replacing the metal surface with a\nsecond fictitious emitter which ensures appropriate electromagnetic boundary\nconditions. Here, we extend the approach to the case of driven solid-state\nemitters, where exciton-phonon interactions play a key role in determining the\noptical properties of the system. We derive an intuitive polaron master\nequation and demonstrate its agreement with the complementary half-sided cavity\nformulation of the same problem. Our extended image approach offers a\nstraightforward route towards studying the dynamics of multiple solid-state\nemitters near a metallic surface.\n", "  Static and dynamic properties of vortices in a two-component Bose-Einstein\ncondensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling are investigated. The mass current\naround a vortex core in the plane-wave phase is found to be deformed by the\nspin-orbit coupling, and this makes the dynamics of the vortex pairs quite\ndifferent from those in a scalar Bose-Einstein condensate. The velocity of a\nvortex-antivortex pair is much smaller than that without spin-orbit coupling,\nand there exist stationary states. Two vortices with the same circulation move\naway from each other or unite to form a stationary state.\n", "  Quantum-limited amplifiers increase the amplitude of quantum signals at the\nprice of introducing additional noise. Quantum purification protocols operate\nin the reverse way, by reducing the noise while attenuating the signal. Here we\ninvestigate a scenario that interpolates between these two extremes. We search\nfor the optimal physical process that generates $M$ approximate copies of pure\nand amplified coherent state, starting from $N$ copies of a noisy coherent\nstate with Gaussian modulation. We prove that the optimal deterministic\nprocesses are always Gaussian, whereas non-Gaussianity powers up probabilistic\nadvantages in suitable parameter regimes. The optimal processes are\nexperimentally feasible, both in the deterministic and in the probabilistic\nscenario. In view of this fact, we provide benchmarks that can be used to\ncertify the experimental demonstration of the quantum-enhanced amplification\nand purification of coherent states.\n", "  Basaltic asteroids (V-types) are believed to be fragments of large\ndifferentiated bodies. The majority of them are found in the inner part of the\nasteroid belt, and are current or past members of the Vesta family. Recently,\nsome V-type asteroids have been discovered far from the Vesta family supporting\nthe hypothesis of the presence of multiple basaltic asteroids in the early\nsolar system. The discovery of basaltic asteroids in the outer belt challenged\nthe models of the radial extent and the variability of the temperature\ndistribution in the early solar system. We aim to identify new basaltic V-type\nasteroids using near-infrared colors of ~40000 asteroids observed by the\nVHS-VISTA survey and compiled in the MOVIS-C catalogue. We also want to study\ntheir near-infrared colors and to study the near-infrared color distribution of\nthe Vesta dynamical family. We performed a search in the MOVIS-C catalogue of\nall the asteroids with (Y-J) and (J-Ks) in the range (Y-J) > 0.5 and (J-Ks) <\n0.3, associated with V-type asteroids, and studied their color distribution. We\nhave also analyzed the near-infrared color distribution of 273 asteroid members\nof the Vesta family and compared them with the albedo and visible colors from\nWISE and SDSS data. We determined the fraction of V-type asteroids in the\nfamily. We found 477 V-type candidates in MOVIS-C, 244 of them outside the\nVesta dynamical family. We identified 19 V-type asteroids beyond the 3:1 mean\nmotion resonance, 6 of them in the outer main belt, and 16 V-types in the inner\nmain belt with proper inclination i_p < 3.0deg, well below the inclination of\nthe Vesta family. We computed that ~85% of the members of the Vesta dynamical\nfamily are V-type asteroids, and only 1-2% are primitive class asteroids and\nunlikely members of the family. This work almost doubles the sample of basaltic\nasteroid candidates in regions outside the Vesta family.\n", "  The projection factor (p-factor) is an essential component of the classical\nBaade-Wesselink (BW) technique, that is commonly used to determine the\ndistances to pulsating stars. It is a multiplicative parameter used to convert\nradial velocities into pulsational velocities. As the BW distances are linearly\nproportional to the p-factor, its accurate calibration for Cepheids is of\ncritical importance for the reliability of their distance scale. We focus on\nthe observational determination of the p-factor of the long-period Cepheid RS\nPup (P = 41.5 days). This star is particularly important as this is one of the\nbrightest Cepheids in the Galaxy and an analog of the Cepheids used to\ndetermine extragalactic distances. An accurate distance of 1910 +/- 80 pc (+/-\n4.2%) has recently been determined for RS Pup using the light echoes\npropagating in its circumstellar nebula. We combine this distance with new\nVLTI/PIONIER interferometric angular diameters, photometry and radial\nvelocities to derive the p-factor of RS Pup using the code\nSpectro-Photo-Interferometry of Pulsating Stars (SPIPS). We obtain p = 1.250\n+/- 0.064 (+/-5.1%), defined for cross-correlation radial velocities. Together\nwith measurements from the literature, the p-factor of RS Pup confirms the good\nagreement of a constant p = 1.293 +/- 0.039 (+/-3.0%) model with the\nobservations. We conclude that the p-factor of Cepheids is constant or mildly\nvariable over a broad range of periods (3.7 to 41.5 days).\n", "  We investigate multilayer systems of a normal insulator and a Weyl semimetal.\nWe calculate the bulk band structure and determine phase diagrams by changing\nthe thickness of the normal insulator and that of the Weyl semimetal layer\nusing two models; one is from the effective model for a Weyl semimetal, and the\nother is the lattice model. We compare the results between the two models, and\nfound that they agree well. As a result, we find that the multilayer system\nshows a qualitatively different behavior depending on the stacking direction\nrelative to the displacement vector connecting between two Weyl nodes. When the\nstacking direction is perpendicular to the displacement vector, the Weyl\nsemimetal and the normal insulator phases appear only. On the other hand, when\nit is parallel to the displacement vector, the phase diagram is rich,\ncontaining not only the Weyl semimetal phases but also the quantum anomalous\nHall phases with different Chern numbers. Furthermore, the phase transition can\nbe understood in terms of the trajectory of the Weyl nodes.\n", "  We consider the fragmentation of a parton into a jet with small radius $R$ in\nthe large $z$ limit, where $z$ is the ratio of the jet energy to the mother\nparton energy. In this region of phase space, large logarithms of both $R$ and\n$1-z$ can appear, requiring resummation in order to have a well defined\nperturbative expansion. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we study the\nfragmentation function to a jet (FFJ) in this endpoint region. We derive a\nfactorization theorem for this object, separating collinear and collinear-soft\nmodes. This allows for the resummation using renormalization group evolution of\nthe logarithms $\\ln R$ and $\\ln(1-z)$ simultaneously. We show results valid to\nnext-to-leading logarithmic order for the global Sudakov logarithms. We also\ndiscuss the possibility of non-global logarithms that should appear at\ntwo-loops and give an estimate of their size.\n", "  An interacting cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) inside a driven\noptical cavity exhibits an intrinsic cross-Kerr (CK) nonlinearity due to the\ninteraction with the optical mode of the cavity. Although the CK coupling is\nmuch weaker than those of the radiation pressure and the atom-atom\ninteractions, it can affect the bistability behavior of the system when the\nintensity of the laser pump is strong enough. On the other hand, there is a\ncompetition between the CK nonlinearity and the atom-atom interaction so that\nthe latter can neutralize the effect of the former. Furthermore, the CK\nnonlinearity causes the effective frequency of the Bogoliubov mode of the BEC\nas well as the quantum fluctuations of the system to be increased by increasing\nthe cavity driving rate. However, in the dispersive interaction regime the\neffect of the CK nonlinearity is negligible. In addition, we show that by\nincreasing the \\textit{s}-wave scattering frequency of atomic collisions one\ncan generate a strong stationary quadrature squeezing in the Bogoliubov mode of\nthe BEC.\n", "  We present a novel time- and phase-resolved, background-free scheme to study\nthe extreme ultraviolet dipole emission of a bound electronic wavepacket,\nwithout the use of any extreme ultraviolet exciting pulse. Using multiphoton\ntransitions, we populate a superposition of quantum states which coherently\nemit extreme ultraviolet radiation through free induction decay. This emission\nis probed and controlled, both in amplitude and phase, by a time-delayed\ninfrared femtosecond pulse. We directly measure the laser-induced dephasing of\nthe emission by using a simple heterodyne detection scheme based on two-source\ninterferometry. This technique provides rich information about the interplay\nbetween the laser field and the Coulombic potential on the excited electron\ndynamics. Its background-free nature enables us to use a large range of gas\npressures and to reveal the influence of collisions in the relaxation process.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of the regularity of the covariance matrix\nof a discretized field on the sphere. In a particular situation, the rank of\nthe matrix depends on the number of pixels, the number of spherical harmonics,\nthe symmetries of the pixelization scheme and the presence of a mask. Taking\ninto account the above mentioned components, we provide analytical expressions\nthat constrain the rank of the matrix. They are obtained by expanding the\ndeterminant of the covariance matrix as a sum of determinants of matrices made\nup of spherical harmonics. We investigate these constraints for five different\npixelizations that have been used in the context of Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) data analysis: Cube, Icosahedron, Igloo, GLESP and HEALPix, finding that,\nat least in the considered cases, the HEALPix pixelization tends to provide a\ncovariance matrix with a rank closer to the maximum expected theoretical value\nthan the other pixelizations. The effect of the propagation of numerical errors\nin the regularity of the covariance matrix is also studied for different\ncomputational precisions, as well as the effect of adding a certain level of\nnoise in order to regularize the matrix. In addition, we investigate the\napplication of the previous results to a particular example that requires the\ninversion of the covariance matrix: the estimation of the CMB temperature power\nspectrum through the Quadratic Maximum Likelihood algorithm. Finally, some\ngeneral considerations in order to achieve a regular covariance matrix are also\npresented.\n", "  For atomic frequency standards in which fluctuations of the local oscillator\n(LO) frequency are the dominant noise source, we examine the role of the servo\nalgorithm that predicts and corrects these frequency fluctuations. We derive\nthe optimal linear prediction algorithm, showing how to measure the relevant\nspectral properties of the noise and optimise servo parameters while the\nstandard is running, using only the atomic error signal. We find that, for\nrealistic LO noise spectra, a conventional integrating servo with a properly\nchosen gain performs nearly as well as the optimal linear predictor. Using\nsimple analytical models and numerical simulations, we establish optimum probe\ntimes as a function of clock atom number and of the dominant noise type in the\nlocal oscillator. We calculate the resulting LO-dependent scaling of achievable\nclock stability with atom number for product states as well as for\nmaximally-correlated states.\n", "  We investigate the predictions for lepton flavour number violating processes\nin the context of a simple left-right symmetric theory. In this context\nneutrinos are Majorana fermions and their masses are generated at the quantum\nlevel through the Zee mechanism using the simplest Higgs sector. We show that\nthe right handed neutrinos are generically light and can give rise to large\nlepton number violating contributions to rare processes. We discuss the\ncorrelation between the collider constrains and the predictions for lepton\nnumber violating processes. We find that using the predictions for mu to e\ngamma and mu to e conversion together with the collider signatures one could\ntest this theory in the near future.\n", "  We perform a set of general relativistic, radiative, magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations (GR-RMHD) to study the transition from radiatively inefficient to\nefficient state of accretion on a non-rotating black hole. We study ion to\nelectron temperature ratios ranging from $T_{\\rm i}/T_{\\rm e}=10$ to $100$, and\nsimulate flows corresponding to accretion rates as low as $10^{-6}\\dot M_{\\rm\nEdd}$, and as high as $10^{-2}\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$. We have found that the\nradiative output of accretion flows increases with accretion rate, and that the\ntransition occurs earlier for hotter electrons (lower $T_{\\rm i}/T_{\\rm e}$\nratio). At the same time, the mechanical efficiency hardly changes and accounts\nto ${\\approx}\\,3\\%$ of the accreted rest mass energy flux, even at the highest\nsimulated accretion rates. This is particularly important for the mechanical\nAGN feedback regulating massive galaxies, groups, and clusters. Comparison with\nrecent observations of radiative and mechanical AGN luminosities suggests that\nthe ion to electron temperature ratio in the inner, collisionless accretion\nflow should fall within $10<T_{\\rm i}/T_{\\rm e}<30$, i.e., the electron\ntemperature should be several percent of the ion temperature.\n", "  A wealth of data from the Herschel and Planck satellites and now from ALMA,\nrevealing cold dust thermal emission, is available for astronomical\nenvironments ranging from interstellar clouds, cold clumps, circumstellar\nenvelops, and protoplanetary disks. The interpretation of these observations\nrelies on the understanding and modeling of cold dust emission and on the\nknowledge of the dust optical properties. The aim of this work is to provide\nastronomers with a set of spectroscopic data of realistic interstellar dust\nanalogues that can be used to interpret the observations. Glassy silicates of\nmean composition (1-x)MgO - xSiO2 with x = 0.35, 0.40 and 0.50 were\nsynthesized. The mass absorption coefficient (MAC) of the samples was measured\nin the spectral domain 30 - 1000 $\\mu$m for grain temperature in the range 300\nK - 10 K and at room temperature in the 5 - 40 $\\mu$m domain. We find that the\nMAC of all samples varies with the grains temperature. In the FIR/submm, and\nabove 30K, the MAC value at a given wavelength increases with the temperature\nas thermally activated absorption processes appear. The studied materials\nexhibit different and complex behaviors at long wavelengths (lambda $\\geq$ 200\nto 700 $\\mu$m depending on the samples) and the MAC cannot be approximated by a\nsingle power law in ${\\lambda}^{-\\beta}$. These behaviors are attributed to the\namorphous nature of dust and to the amount and nature of the defects within\nthis amorphous structure. Above 20 $\\mu$m, the measured MAC are much higher\nthan the MAC calculated from interstellar silicate dust models indicating that\nthe analogues measured in this study are more emissive than the silicates in\ncosmic dust models. This has important astrophysical implications because\nmasses are overestimated by the models. Moreover, constraints on elemental\nabundance of heavy elements in cosmic dust models are relaxed\n", "  Context: Recent XMM-Newton observations have revealed that IRAS 17020+4544 is\na very unusual example of black hole wind-produced feedback by a moderately\nluminous AGN in a spiral galaxy. Aims: Since the source is known for being a\nradio emitter, we investigated about the presence and the properties of a\nnon-thermal component. Methods: We observed IRAS 17020+4544 with the Very Long\nBaseline Array at 5, 8, 15, and 24 GHz within a month of the 2014 XMM-Newton\nobservations. We further analysed archival data taken in 2000 and 2012.\nResults: We detect the source at 5 GHz and on short baselines at 8 GHz. At 15\nand 24 GHz, the source is below our baseline sensitivity for fringe fitting,\nindicating the lack of prominent compact features. The morphology is that of an\nasymmetric double, with significant diffuse emission. The spectrum between 5\nand 8 GHz is rather steep ($S(\\nu)\\sim\\nu^{-(1.0\\pm0.2)}$). Our re-analysis of\nthe archival data at 5 and 8 GHz provides results consistent with the new\nobservations, suggesting that flux density and structural variability are not\nimportant in this source. We put a limit on the separation speed between the\nmain components of $<0.06c$. Conclusions: IRAS 17020+4544 shows interesting\nfeatures of several classes of objects: its properties are typical of compact\nsteep spectrum sources, low power compact sources, radio-emitting narrow line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. However, it can not be classified in any of these\ncategories, remaining so far a one-of-a-kind object.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the ionization dynamics of a hydrogen atom\nexposed to attosecond laser pulses in the extreme ultra violet region at very\nhigh intensities. The pulses are such that the electron is expected to reach\nrelativistic velocities, thus necessitating a fully relativistic treatment. We\nsolve the time dependent Dirac equation and compare its predictions with those\nof the corresponding non-relativistic Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation. We find that as\nthe electron is expected to reach about 20% of the speed of light, relativistic\ncorrections introduces a finite yet small decrease in the probability of\nionizing the atom.\n", "  We present a MUSE and KMOS dynamical study 405 star-forming galaxies at\nredshift z=0.28-1.65 (median redshift z=0.84). Our sample are representative of\nstar-forming, main-sequence galaxies, with star-formation rates of\nSFR=0.1-30Mo/yr and stellar masses M=10^8-10^11Mo. For 49+/-4% of our sample,\nthe dynamics suggest rotational support, 24+/-3% are unresolved systems and\n5+/-2% appear to be early-stage major mergers with components on 8-30kpc\nscales. The remaining 22+/-5% appear to be dynamically complex, irregular (or\nface-on systems). For galaxies whose dynamics suggest rotational support, we\nderive inclination corrected rotational velocities and show these systems lie\non a similar scaling between stellar mass and specific angular momentum as\nlocal spirals with j*=J/M*\\propto M^(2/3) but with a redshift evolution that\nscales as j*\\propto M^{2/3}(1+z)^(-1). We identify a correlation between\nspecific angular momentum and disk stability such that galaxies with the\nhighest specific angular momentum, log(j*/M^(2/3))>2.5, are the most stable,\nwith Toomre Q=1.10+/-0.18, compared to Q=0.53+/-0.22 for galaxies with\nlog(j*/M^(2/3))<2.5. At a fixed mass, the HST morphologies of galaxies with the\nhighest specific angular momentum resemble spiral galaxies, whilst those with\nlow specific angular momentum are morphologically complex and dominated by\nseveral bright star-forming regions. This suggests that angular momentum plays\na major role in defining the stability of gas disks: at z~1, massive galaxies\nthat have disks with low specific angular momentum, appear to be globally\nunstable, clumpy and turbulent systems. In contrast, galaxies with high\nspecific angular have evolved in to stable disks with spiral structures.\n", "  There is evidence to suggest that clathrate hydrates have a significant\neffect on the surface geology of icy bodies in the Solar System. However the\naqueous environments believed to be present on these bodies are likely to be\nsaline rather than pure water. Laboratory work to underpin the properties of\nclathrates in such environments is lacking. We fill this gap by carrying out a\nlaboratory investigation of the physical properties of CO$_2$ clathrates\nproduced in weak aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We use synchrotron X-ray powder\ndiffraction to investigate clathrates formed at high CO$_2$ pressure in ice\nthat has formed from aqueous solutions of MgSO$_4$. We measure the thermal\nexpansion, density and dissociation properties of the clathrates under\ntemperature conditions similar to those on icy Solar System bodies. We find\nthat the sulphate solution inhibits the formation of clathrates by lowering\ntheir dissociation temperatures. Hysteresis is found in the thermal expansion\ncoefficients as clathrates are cooled and heated; we attribute this to the\npresence of the salt in solution. The density derived from X-ray powder\ndiffraction is temperature and pressure dependent. When comparing the density\nof CO$_2$ clathrates to that of the solution in which they formed, we conclude\nthat they sink in the oceans in which they form. We also find that the\npolymorph of ice present at low temperatures is Ih rather than Ic, which we\nattribute to the presence of the MgSO$_4$. We 1) conclude that the clathrate\ndensity has implications for their behaviour in satellite oceans as their\nsinking and floating capabilities are temperature and pressure dependent, 2)\nconclude that the presence of MgSO$_4$ inhibits the formation of clathrates and\nin some cases may even affect their structure and 3) report the dominance of Ih\nthroughout the experimental procedure despite Ic being the stable phase at low\ntemperature.\n", "  We consider capillary wave turbulence at scales larger than the forcing one.\nAt such scales, our measurements show that the surface waves dynamics is the\none of a thermal equilibrium state in which the effective temperature is\nrelated to the injected power. We characterize this evolution with a scaling\nlaw and report the statistical properties of the large-scale surface elevation\ndepending on this effective temperature.\n", "  The distribution of metals in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy\nclusters provides valuable information on their formation and evolution, on the\nconnection with the cosmic star formation and on the effects of different gas\nprocesses. By analyzing a sample of simulated galaxy clusters, we study the\nchemical enrichment of the ICM, its evolution, and its relation with the\nphysical processes included in the simulation and with the thermal properties\nof the core. These simulations, consisting of re-simulations of 29 Lagrangian\nregions performed with an upgraded version of the SPH GADGET-3 code, have been\nrun including two different sets of baryonic physics: one accounts for\nradiative cooling, star formation, metal enrichment and supernova (SN)\nfeedback, and the other one further includes the effects of feedback from\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN). In agreement with observations, we find an\nanti-correlation between entropy and metallicity in cluster cores, and similar\nradial distributions of heavy-element abundances and abundance ratios out to\nlarge cluster-centric distances (~R180). In the outskirts, namely outside of\n~0.2R180, we find a remarkably homogeneous metallicity distribution, with\nalmost flat profiles of the elements produced by either SNIa or SNII. We\ninvestigated the origin of this phenomenon and discovered that it is due to the\nwidespread displacement of metal-rich gas by early (z>2-3) AGN powerful bursts,\nacting on small high-redshift haloes. Our results also indicate that the\nintrinsic metallicity of the hot gas for this sample is on average consistent\nwith no evolution between z=2 and z=0, across the entire radial range.\n", "  The crystal and magnetic structures of stoichiometric ZnCr2Se4 have been\ninvestigated using synchrotron X-ray and neutron powder diffraction, muon spin\nrelaxation (muSR) and inelastic neutron scattering. Synchrotron X-ray\ndiffraction shows a spin-lattice distortion from the cubic spinel to a\ntetragonal I41/amd lattice below TN = 21 K, where powder neutron diffraction\nconfirms the formation of a helical magnetic structure with magnetic moment of\n3.04(3) {\\mu}B at 1.5 K; close to that expected for high-spin Cr3+. MuSR\nmeasurements show prominent local spin correlations that are established at\ntemperatures considerably higher (< 100 K) than the onset of long range\nmagnetic order. The stretched exponential nature of the relaxation in the local\nspin correlation regime suggests a wide distribution of depolarizing fields.\nBelow TN, unusually fast (> 100 {\\mu}s-1) muon relaxation rates are suggestive\nof rapid site hopping of the muons in static field. Inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements show a gapless mode at an incommensurate propagation\nvector of k = (0 0 0.4648(2)) in the low temperature magnetic ordered phase\nthat extends to 0.8 meV. The dispersion is modelled by a two parameter\nHamiltonian, containing ferromagnetic nearest neighbor and antiferromagnetic\nnext nearest neighbor interactions with a Jnnn/Jnn = -0.337.\n", "  The discrete Frenet equation entails a local framing of a discrete, piecewise\nlinear polygonal chain in terms of its bond and torsion angles. In particular,\nthe tangent vector of a segment is akin the classical O(3) spin variable. Thus\nthere is a relation to the lattice Heisenberg model, that can be used to model\nphysical properties of the chain. On the other hand, the Heisenberg model is\nclosely related to the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (DNLS) equation. Here\nwe apply these interrelations to develop a perspective on discrete chains\ndynamics: We employ the properties of a discrete chain in terms of a spinorial\nrepresentation of the discrete Frenet equation, to introduce a bi-hamiltonian\nstructure for the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (DNLSE), which we\nthen use to produce integrable chain dynamics.\n", "  A quantitative measure of quantum coherence was recently introduced, in the\ncontext of quantum information theory. This measure has also been propounded as\na good quantifier of the wave nature of quantum objects. However, actually\nmeasuring coherence in an experiment is still considered a challenge. A\nprocedure for measuring coherence in a multi-slit interference is proposed\nhere. It can be used for experimentally testing duality relations for\ninterference experiments involving more than two slits.\n", "  We study the parameter estimation of gravitational waves for aligned-spin\nbinary black hole (BBH) signals and assess the impact of bias that can be\nproduced by using nonspinning template waveforms. We employ simple methods to\ncalculate the statistical uncertainty from an overlap distribution. For the\nfiducial waveform model, we use a phenomenological model, which is designed to\ngenerate the gravitational waveforms emitted from merging BBH systems. We show\nthat the mass parameters recovered by nonspinning waveform templates can be\nsignificantly biased from the true values of aligned-spin signals. By comparing\nthe systematic bias with the statistical uncertainty, we examine the validity\nof nonspinning templates for the parameter estimation of aligned-spin BBHs.\n", "  The shot-noise limited peak sensitivity of cavity-enhanced interferometric\nmeasurement devices, such as gravitational-wave detectors, can be improved by\nincreasing the cavity finesse, even when comparing fixed intra-cavity light\npowers. For a fixed light power inside the detector, this comes at the price of\na proportional reduction in the detection bandwidth. High sensitivity over a\nlarge span of signal frequencies, however, is essential for astronomical\nobservations. It is possible to overcome this standard sensitivity-bandwidth\nlimit using non-classical correlations in the light field. Here, we investigate\nthe internal squeezing approach, where the parametric amplification process\ncreates a non-classical correlation directly inside the interferometer cavity.\nWe analyse the limits of the approach theoretically, and measure 36% increase\nin the sensitivity-bandwidth product compared to the classical case. To our\nknowledge this is the first experimental demonstration of an improvement in the\nsensitivity-bandwidth product using internal squeezing, opening the way for a\nnew class of optomechanical force sensing devices.\n", "  We obtained spectra of 26 bright stars in the southern sky, including Sirius,\nCanopus, Betelgeuse, Rigel, Bellatrix, and Procyon, using the 1.5-m telescope\nat Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory and its grating spectrograph RCSPEC.\nA 7.5 magnitude neutral density filter was used to keep from saturating the\nCCD. Our spectra are tied to a Kurucz model of Sirius with T = 9850 K, log g =\n4.30, and [Fe/H] =+0.4. Since Sirius is much less problematic than using Vega\nas a fundamental calibrator, the synthetic photometry of our stars constitutes\na Sirius-based system that could be used as a new anchor for stellar and\nextragalactic photometric measurements.\n", "  We present the results of a multi-wavelength study of a sample of\nhigh-redshift Radio Loud (RL) Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars. This way we\nextend to higher redshift previous studies on the radio properties, and\nbroadband optical colors of these objects. We have se- lected a sample of 22 RL\nBAL quasars with 3.6 z 4.8 cross-correlating the FIRST radio survey with the\nSDSS. Flux densities between 1.25 and 9.5 GHz have been collected with the JVLA\nand Effelsberg-100m telescopes for 15 BAL and 14 non-BAL quasars used as\ncompar- ison sample. We determine the synchrotron peak frequency, constraining\ntheir age. A large number of GigaHertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and High Frequency\nPeakers (HFP) sources has been found in both samples (80% for BAL and 71% for\nnon-BAL QSOs), not suggesting a younger age for BAL quasars. The spectral index\ndistribution provides information about the orientation of these sources, and\nwe find statistically similar distributions for the BAL and non-BAL quasars in\ncontrast to work done on lower redshift samples. Our sample may be too small to\nconvincingly find the same effect, or might represent a real evolutionary\neffect based on the large fraction of young sources. We also study the\nproperties of broadband colors in both optical (SDSS) and near- and\nmid-infrared (UKIDSS and WISE) bands, finding that also at high redshift BAL\nquasars tend to be optically redder than non-BAL quasars. However, these\ndifferences are no more evident at longer wavelength, when comparing colors of\nthe two samples by mean of the WISE survey.\n", "  SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 has previously been classified as an sdM9.5\nsubdwarf. However, its very blue $J-K$ colour ($-0.15 \\pm 0.17$) suggests a\nmuch lower metallicity compared to normal sdM9.5 subdwarfs. Here, we\nre-classify this object as a usdL1.5 subdwarf based on a new optical and\nnear-infrared spectrum obtained with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope.\nSpectral fitting with BT-Settl models leads to $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 2450 $\\pm$ 150\nK, [Fe/H] = $-$2.4 $\\pm$ 0.2 and log $g$ = 5.5 $\\pm$ 0.25. We estimate a mass\nfor SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 of 0.086 $\\pm$ 0.0015 M$_{\\odot}$ which is just\nbelow the hydrogen-burning minimum mass at [Fe/H] = $-$2.4 ($\\sim$0.088\nM$_{\\odot}$) according to evolutionary models. Our analysis thus shows SDSS\nJ0104+15 to be the most metal-poor and highest mass substellar object known\nto-date. We found that SDSS J010448.46+153501.8 is joined by another five known\nL subdwarfs (2MASS J05325346+8246465, 2MASS J06164006$-$6407194, SDSS\nJ125637.16$-$022452.2, ULAS J151913.03$-$000030.0 and 2MASS J16262034+3925190)\nin a 'halo brown dwarf transition zone' in the $T_{\\rm eff}-$[Fe/H] plane,\nwhich represents a narrow mass range in which unsteady nuclear fusion occurs.\nThis halo brown dwarf transition zone forms a 'substellar subdwarf gap' for mid\nL to early T types.\n", "  We consider a rather simple method for the description of the Big Bang - Big\nCrunch cosmological singularity crossing. For the flat Friedmann universe this\nmethod gives the same results as more complicated methods, using Weyl symmetry\nor the transitions between the Jordan and Einstein frames. It is then easily\ngeneralized for the case of a Bianchi-I anisotropic universe. We also present\nearly-time and late-time asymptotic solutions for a Bianchi-I universe, filled\nwith a conformally coupled massless scalar field.\n", "  UV absorption studies with FUSE have observed H2 molecular gas in translucent\nand diffuse clouds. Observations of the 158 micron [C II] fine structure line\nwith Herschel also trace the same H2 molecular gas in emission. We present [C\nII] observations along 27 lines of sight (LOSs) towards target stars of which\n25 have FUSE H2 UV absorption. We detect [C II] emission features in all but\none target LOS. For three Target LOSs, which are close to the Galactic plane,\nwe also present position-velocity maps of [C II] emission observed by HIFI in\non-the-fly spectral line mapping. We use the velocity resolved [C II] spectra\ntowards the target LOSs observed by FUSE to identify C II] velocity components\nassociated with the H2 clouds. We analyze the observed velocity integrated [C\nII] spectral line intensities in terms of the densities and thermal pressures\nin the H2 gas using the H2 column densities and temperatures measured by the UV\nabsorption data. We present the H2 gas densities and thermal pressures for 26\ntarget LOSs and from the [C II] intensities derive a mean thermal pressure in\nthe range 6100 to 7700 K cm^-3 in diffuse H2 clouds. We discuss the thermal\npressures and densities towards 14 targets, comparing them to results obtained\nusing the UV absorption data for two other tracers CI and CO.\n", "  Planetary nebulae (PNe) constitute an important tool to study the chemical\nevolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies, probing the nucleosynthesis\nprocesses, abundance gradients and the chemical enrichment of the interstellar\nmedium. In particular, Galactic bulge PNe (GBPNe) have been extensively used in\nthe literature to study the chemical properties of this Galactic structure.\nHowever, the presently available GBPNe chemical composition studies are\nstrongly biased, since they were focused on brighter objects, predominantly\nlocated in Galactic regions of low interstellar reddening. In this work, we\nreport physical parameters and abundances derived for a sample of 17 high\nextinction PNe located in the inner 2\\degr of the Galactic bulge, based on low\ndispersion spectroscopy secured at the SOAR telescope using the Goodman\nspectrograph. The new data allow us to extend our database including faint\nobjects, providing chemical compositions for PNe located in this region of the\nbulge and an estimation for the masses of their progenitors to explore the\nchemical enrichment history of the central region of the Galactic bulge. The\nresults show that there is an enhancement in the N/O abundance ratio in the\nGalactic centre PNe compared with PNe located in the outer regions of the\nGalactic bulge. This may indicate recent episodes of star formation occurring\nnear the Galactic centre.\n", "  We derived Potassium abundances in red giant branch stars in the Galactic\nglobular clusters NGC104 (144 stars), NGC6752 (134 stars) and NGC6809 (151\nstars) using high-resolution spectra collected with FLAMES at the ESO - Very\nLarge Telescope. In the considered samples we do not find significant intrinsic\nspreads in [K/Fe] (confirming the previous findings by Carretta et al.), at\nvariance with the cases of the massive clusters NGC2419 and NGC2808.\nAdditionally, marginally significant [K/Fe]-[O/Fe] anti-correlations are found\nin NGC104 and NGC6809, and [K/Fe]-[Na/Fe] correlations are found in NGC104 and\nNGC6752. No evidence of [K/Fe]-[Mg/Fe] anti-correlation are found. The results\nof our analysis are consistent with a scenario in which the process leading to\nthe multi-populations in globular clusters implies also enrichment in the K\nabundance, the amplitude of the associated [K/Fe] enhancement becoming\nmeasurable only in stars showing the most extreme effects of O and Mg\ndepletion. Stars enhanced in [K/Fe] have been found so far only in clusters\nharbouring some Mg-poor stars, while the other globulars, without a Mg-poor\nsub-population, show small or null [K/Fe] spreads.\n", "  Even as our measurements of cosmological parameters improve, the physical\nnature of the dark sector of the universe largely remains a mystery. Many\neffects of dark sector models are most prominent at very large scales and will\nrely on future galaxy surveys to elucidate. In this paper we compare the\ntopological properties of the large scale dark matter distribution in a number\nof cosmological models using hydrodynamical simulations and the cosmological\ngenus statistic. Genus curves are computed from z = 11 to z = 0 for\n{\\Lambda}CDM, Quintessence and Warm Dark Matter models, over a scale range of 1\nto 20 Mpc/h. The curves are analysed in terms of their Hermite spectra to\ndescribe the power contained in non-Gaussian deformations to the cosmological\ndensity field. We find that the {\\Lambda}CDM and {\\Lambda}WDM models produce\nnearly identical genus curves indicating no topological differences in\nstructure formation. The Quintessence model, which differs solely in its\nexpansion history, produces significant differences in the strength and\nredshift evolution of non-Gaussian modes associated with higher cluster\nabundances and lower void abundances. These effects are robust to cosmic\nvariance and are characteristically different from those produced by tweaking\nthe parameters of a {\\Lambda}CDM model. Given the simplicity and similarity of\nthe models, detecting these discrepancies represents a promising avenue for\nunderstanding the effect of non-standard cosmologies on large-scale structure.\n", "  A triple-GEM detector with two-dimensional readout is developed. The detector\nprovides high position resolution for powder diffraction experiments at\nsynchrotron radiation. Spatial resolution of the detector is measured in the\nlab using a 55Fe X-ray source. A resolution of about 110 um FWHM is achieved.\nThe energy resolution is better than 27% for 5.9 keV X-rays. The detector's\nvalidity under illumination of photons in particular energy range is verified\nusing a Cu X-ray tube. Imaging of the head of a wire stripper with X-ray tube\ndemonstrates its imaging ability. A diffraction imaging experiment using the\nsample of powder SiO2 is successfully carried out at 1W2B laboratory of Beijing\nSynchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF). Different diffraction rings are clearly\nseen under various X-ray energies.\n", "  We report on the spectral analysis and the local measurement of intensity\ncorrelations of microwave fields using ultra cold quantum gases. The\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce spin flips in a magnetically\ntrapped quantum gas and generate a multi-mode atomlaser. The output of the\natomlaser is measured with high temporal resolution on the single atom level,\nfrom which the spectrum and intensity correlations of the generating microwave\nfield are reconstructed. We give a theoretical description of the atomlaser\noutput and its correlations in response to resonant microwave fields and verify\nthe model with measurements on an atom chip. The measurement technique is\napplicable for the local analysis of classical and quantum noise of\nelectromagnetic fields, for example on chips, in the vicinity of quantum\nelectronic circuits.\n", "  When strained beyond the linear regime, soft colloidal glasses yield to\nsteady-state plastic flow in a way that is similar to the deformation of\nconventional amorphous solids. Due to the much larger size of the colloidal\nparticles with respect to the atoms comprising an amorphous solid, colloidal\nglasses allow to obtain microscopic insight into the nature of the yielding\ntransition, as we illustrate here combining experiments, atomistic simulations,\nand mesoscopic modeling. Our results unanimously show growing clusters of\nnon-affine deformation percolating at yielding. In agreement with percolation\ntheory, the spanning cluster is fractal with a fractal dimension d_f~2, and the\ncorrelation length diverges upon approaching the critical yield strain. These\nresults indicate that percolation of highly non-affine particles is the\nhallmark of the yielding transition in disordered glassy systems.\n", "  We present the first simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic investigation\nof a large set of RR Lyrae variables in a globular cluster. The radial-velocity\ndata presented comprise the largest sample of RVs of RR Lyrae stars ever\nobtained. The target is M3; $BVI_{\\mathrm{C}}$ time-series of 111 and $b$ flux\ndata of further 64 RRab stars, and RV data of 79 RR Lyrae stars are published.\nBlazhko modulation of the light curves of 47 percent of the RRab stars are\ndetected. The mean value of the center-of-mass velocities of RR Lyrae stars is\n$-146.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with 4.52 km s$^{-1}$ standard deviation, which is in good\nagreement with the results obtained for the red giants of the cluster. The\n${\\Phi_{21}}^{\\mathrm RV}$ phase difference of the RV curves of RRab stars is\nfound to be uniformly constant both for the M3 and for Galactic field RRab\nstars; no period or metallicity dependence of the ${\\Phi_{21}}^{\\mathrm RV}$ is\ndetected. The Baade-Wesselink distances of 26 non-Blazhko variables with the\nbest phase-coverage radial-velocity curves are determined; the corresponding\ndistance of the cluster, $10480\\pm210$ pc, agrees with the previous literature\ninformation. A quadratic formula for the $A_{\\mathrm{puls}}-A_V$ relation of\nRRab stars is given, which is valid for both OoI and OoII variables. We also\nshow that the $(V-I)_0$ of RRab stars measured at light minimum is period\ndependent, there is at least 0.1 mag difference between the colours at minimum\nlight of the shortest- and longest-period variables.\n", "  We present N-body simulations of star clusters that initially evolve within a\nstrong compressive tidal field and then transition into extensive tidal fields\nof varying strengths. While subject to compressive tides, clusters can undergo\nsignificant heating due to two-body interactions and mass loss due to stellar\nevolution. When the cluster transitions into an extensive tidal field it is\nsuper-virialized, which leads to a rapid expansion and significant mass loss\nbefore the cluster reaches virial equilibrium. After the transition, clusters\nare significantly less massive, more extended and therefore more tidally\nfilling than clusters which have spent their entire lifetime in a similar\nextensive tidal field.\n", "  Observations of the sungrazing comet C/2012 S1 (ISON) were carried out using\nthe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at a heliocentric\ndistance of 0.58-0.54 AU (pre-perihelion) on 2013 November 16-17. Temporally\nresolved measurements of the coma distributions of HNC, CH$_3$OH, H$_2$CO and\ndust were obtained over the course of about an hour on each day. During the\nperiod UT 10:10-11:00 on Nov. 16, the comet displayed a remarkable drop in\nactivity, manifested as a $>42$% decline in the molecular line and continuum\nfluxes. The H$_2$CO observations are consistent with an abrupt, $\\approx50$%\nreduction in the cometary gas production rate soon after the start of our\nobservations. On Nov. 17, the total observed fluxes remained relatively\nconstant during a similar period, but strong variations in the morphology of\nthe HNC distribution were detected as a function of time, indicative of a\nclumpy, intermittent outflow for this species. Our observations suggest that at\nleast part of the detected HNC originated from degradation of nitrogen-rich\norganic refractory material, released intermittently from confined regions of\nthe nucleus. By contrast, the distributions of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO during the\nNov. 17 observations were relatively uniform, consistent with isotropic outflow\nand stable activity levels for these species. These results highlight a large\ndegree of variability in the production of gas and dust from comet ISON during\nits pre-perihelion outburst, consistent with repeated disruption of the nucleus\ninterspersed with periods of relative quiescence.\n", "  We examine the relation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar\nmass---the MZ relation---as a function of the large scale galaxy environment\nparameterized by the local density. The dependence of the MZ relation on the\nenvironment is small. The metallicity where the MZ relation saturates and the\nslope of the MZ relation are both independent of the local density. The impact\nof the large scale environment is completely parameterized by the\nanti-correlation between local density and the turnover stellar mass where the\nMZ relation begins to saturate. Analytical modeling suggests that the\nanti-correlation between the local density and turnover stellar mass is a\nconsequence of a variation in the gas content of star-forming galaxies. Across\n$\\sim1$ order of magnitude in local density, the gas content at a fixed stellar\nmass varies by $\\sim5\\%$. Variation of the specific star formation rate with\nenvironment is consistent with this interpretation. At a fixed stellar mass,\ngalaxies in low density environments have lower metallicities because they are\nslightly more gas-rich than galaxies in high density environments. Modeling the\nshape of the mass-metallicity relation thus provides an indirect means to probe\nsubtle variations in the gas content of star-forming galaxies.\n", "  We report the discovery of four massive ($M > 0.8\\,M_\\odot$) ZZ Ceti white\ndwarfs, including an ultramassive $1.16\\,M_\\odot$ star. We obtained ground\nbased, time-series photometry for thirteen white dwarfs from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey Data Release 7 and Data Release 10 whose atmospheric parameters\nplace them within the ZZ Ceti instability strip. We detect mono-periodic\npulsations in three of our targets (J1053, J1554, and J2038) and identify three\nperiods of pulsation in J0840 (173, 327, and 797 s). Fourier analysis of the\nremaining nine objects do not indicate variability above the\n$4\\langle{A}\\rangle$ detection threshold. Our preliminary asteroseismic\nanalysis of J0840 yields a stellar mass $M=1.14\\pm 0.01\\,M_{\\odot}$, hydrogen\nand helium envelope masses of $M_H = 5.8 \\times 10^{-7}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and\n$M_{He}=4.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,M_{\\odot}$, and an expected core crystallized mass\nratio of 50-70\\%. J1053, J1554, and J2038 have masses in the range $0.84-0.91\nM_\\odot$ and are expected to have a CO core; however, the core of J0840 could\nconsist of highly crystallized CO or ONeMg given its high mass. These newly\ndiscovered massive pulsators represent a significant increase in the number of\nknown ZZ Ceti white dwarfs with mass $M > 0.85\\,M_\\odot$, and detailed\nasteroseismic modeling of J0840 will allow for significant tests of\ncrystallization theory in CO and ONeMg core white dwarfs.\n", "  Our aim is to derive a self-consistent age, distance and composition for the\nglobular cluster $47\\,$Tucanae ($47\\,$Tuc; NGC104). First, we reevaluate the\nreddening towards the cluster resulting in a nominal $E(B-V)=0.03\\pm0.01$ as\nthe best estimate. The $T_{\\rm eff}$ of the components of the eclipsing binary\nmember V69 is found to be $5900\\pm72$ K from both photometric and spectroscopic\nevidence. This yields a true distance modulus $(m-M)_0=13.21\\pm0.06$(random)$\n\\pm0.03 $(systematic) to $47\\,$Tuc when combined with existing measurements of\nV69 radii and luminosity ratio. We then present a new completely\nself-consistent isochrone fitting method to ground based and $\\textit{HST}$\ncluster colour-magnitude diagrams and the eclipsing binary member V69. The\nanalysis suggests that the composition of V69, and by extension one of the\npopulations of $47\\,$Tuc, is given by [Fe/H]$\\sim-0.70$, [O/Fe]$\\sim+0.60$, and\n$Y\\sim0.250$ on the solar abundance scale of Asplund, Grevesse & Sauval.\nHowever, this depends on the accuracy of the model $T_{\\rm eff}$ scale which is\n50-75 K cooler than our best estimate but within measurement uncertainties. Our\nbest estimate of the age of $47\\,$Tuc is 11.8 Gyr, with firm ($3 \\sigma$) lower\nand upper limits of 10.4 and 13.4 Gyr, respectively, in satisfactory agreement\nwith the age derived from the white dwarf cooling sequence if our determination\nof the distance modulus is adopted.\n", "  We present the most precise estimate to date of the clustering of quasars on\nvery small scales, based on a sample of 47 binary quasars with magnitudes of\n$g<20.85$ and proper transverse separations of $\\sim 25\\,h^{-1}$\\,kpc. Our\nsample of binary quasars, which is about 6 times larger than any previous\nspectroscopically confirmed sample on these scales, is targeted using a Kernel\nDensity Estimation technique (KDE) applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nimaging over most of the SDSS area. Our sample is \"complete\" in that all of the\nKDE target pairs with $17.0 \\lesssim R \\lesssim 36.2\\,h^{-1}$\\,kpc in our area\nof interest have been spectroscopically confirmed from a combination of\nprevious surveys and our own long-slit observational campaign. We catalogue 230\ncandidate quasar pairs with angular separations of $<8\\arcsec$, from which our\nbinary quasars were identified. We determine the projected correlation function\nof quasars ($\\bar W_{\\rm p}$) in four bins of proper transverse scale over the\nrange $17.0 \\lesssim R \\lesssim 36.2\\,h^{-1}$\\,kpc. The implied small-scale\nquasar clustering amplitude from the projected correlation function, integrated\nacross our entire redshift range, is $A=24.1\\pm3.6$ at $\\sim 26.6\n~h^{-1}$\\,kpc. Our sample is the first spectroscopically confirmed sample of\nquasar pairs that is sufficiently large to study how quasar clustering evolves\nwith redshift at $\\sim 25 ~h^{-1}$ kpc. We find that empirical descriptions of\nhow quasar clustering evolves with redshift at $\\sim 25 ~h^{-1}$ Mpc also\nadequately describe the evolution of quasar clustering at $\\sim 25 ~h^{-1}$\nkpc.\n", "  Radio-loud high-redshift quasars (HRQs), although only a few of them are\nknown to date, are crucial for the studies of the growth of supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs) and the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at early\ncosmological epochs. Radio jets offer direct evidence of SMBHs, and their radio\nstructures can be studied with the highest angular resolution using Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI). Here we report on the observations of three\nHRQs (J0131-0321, J0906+6930, J1026+2542) at z>5 using the Korean VLBI Network\nand VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry Arrays (together known as KaVA) with\nthe purpose of studying their pc-scale jet properties. The observations were\ncarried out at 22 and 43 GHz in 2016 January among the first-batch open-use\nexperiments of KaVA. The quasar J0906+6930 was detected at 22 GHz but not at 43\nGHz. The other two sources were not detected and upper limits to their compact\nradio emission are given. Archival VLBI imaging data and single-dish 15-GHz\nmonitoring light curve of J0906+6930 were also acquired as complementary\ninformation. J0906+6930 shows a moderate-level variability at 15 GHz. The radio\nimage is characterized by a core-jet structure with a total detectable size of\n~5 pc in projection. The brightness temperature, 1.9x10^{11} K, indicates\nrelativistic beaming of the jet. The radio properties of J0906+6930 are\nconsistent with a blazar. Follow-up VLBI observations will be helpful for\ndetermining its structural variation.\n", "  In the framework of the weak coupling renormalization group technique we\nexamine the possible instabilities of the extended quasi-one-dimensional\nelectron gas model with both intrachain and interchain electron-electron\ninteractions, including the influence of umklapp scattering and the coupling of\nspins to a magnetic field. In the limit of purely repulsive intrachain\ninteractions, we confirm the passage from singlet d-wave like superconductivity\nto an inhomogeneous FFLO state under magnetic field. The passage is accompanied\nby an anomalous increase of the upper critical field that scales with the\nantinesting distance from the quantum critical point joining superconductivity\nto antiferromagnetism in the phase diagram, as well as the strength of\ninteractions. Adding weak repulsive interchain interactions promotes the\npassage from singlet to triplet $f$-wave superconductivity which is expanded\nunder field by the development of a triplet FFLO state with zero angular\nmomentum projection for the Cooper pairs. The connection between theory and\nexperiments on the anomalous upper critical field in the Bechgaard salts is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper we exploit factorisation properties of Picard-Fuchs operators\nto decouple differential equations for multi-scale Feynman integrals. The\nalgorithm reduces the differential equations to blocks of the size of the order\nof the irreducible factors of the Picard-Fuchs operator. As a side product, our\nmethod can be used to easily convert the differential equations for Feynman\nintegrals which evaluate to multiple polylogarithms to $\\varepsilon$-form.\n", "  The XMM Cluster Archive Super Survey (X-CLASS) is a serendipitously-detected\nX-ray-selected sample of 845 galaxy clusters based on 2774 XMM archival\nobservations and covering approximately 90 deg$^2$ spread across the\nhigh-Galactic latitude ($|b|>20$ deg) sky. The primary goal of this survey is\nto produce a well-selected sample of galaxy clusters on which cosmological\nanalyses can be performed. This article presents the photometric redshift\nfollowup of a high signal-to-noise subset of 266 of these clusters with\ndeclination $\\delta<+20$ deg with GROND, a seven channel ($grizJHK$)\nsimultaneous imager on the MPG 2.2m telescope at the ESO La Silla Observatory.\nWe use a newly developed technique based on the red sequence colour-redshift\nrelation, enhanced with information coming from the X-ray detection to provide\nphotometric redshifts for this sample. We determine photometric redshifts for\n236 clusters, finding a median redshift of $z=0.39$ with an accuracy of $\\Delta\nz = 0.02 (1+z)$ when compared to a sample of 76 spectroscopically confirmed\nclusters. We also compute X-ray luminosities for the entire sample and find a\nmedian bolometric luminosity of $7.2\\times10^{43} \\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}}$ and a\nmedian temperature 2.9 keV. We compare our results to the XMM-XCS and XMM-XXL\nsurveys, finding good agreement in both samples. The X-CLASS catalogue is\navailable online at http://xmm-lss.in2p3.fr:8080/l4sdb/.\n", "  Two new crystalline compounds, pentazole (N_{5}H) and ammonium pentazolate\n(NH_{4})(N_{5}), both featuring cyclo-{\\rm N_{5}^{-}} are discovered using\nfirst principles evolutionary search of the nitrogen-rich portion of the\nhydro-nitrogen binary phase diagram (N_{x}H_{y}, x\\geqy) at high pressures.\nBoth crystals consist of the pentazolate N_{5}^{-} anion and ammonium\nNH_{4}^{+} or hydrogen H^{+} cations. These two crystals are predicted to be\nthermodynamically stable at pressures above 30 GPa for (NH_{4})(N_{5}) and 50\nGPa for pentazole N_{5}H. The chemical transformation of ammonium azide\n(NH_{4})(N_{3}) mixed with di-nitrogen (N_{2}) to ammonium pentazolate\n(NH_{4})(N_{5}) is predicted to become energetically favorable above 12.5 GPa.\nTo assist in identification of newly synthesized compounds in future\nexperiments, the Raman spectra of both crystals are calculated and mode\nassignments are made as a function of pressure up to 75 GPa.\n", "  In our grid of multiphase chemical evolution models (Moll\\'a & D\\'iaz, 2005),\nstar formation in the disk occurs in two steps: first, molecular gas forms, and\nthen stars are created by cloud-cloud collisions or interactions of massive\nstars with the surrounding molecular clouds. The formation of both molecular\nclouds and stars are treated through the use of free parameters we refer to as\nefficiencies. In this work we modify the formation of molecular clouds based on\nseveral new prescriptions existing in the literature, and we compare the\nresults obtained for a chemical evolution model of the Milky Way Galaxy\nregarding the evolution of the Solar region, the radial structure of the\nGalactic disk, and the ratio between the diffuse and molecular components,\nHI/H$_2$. Our results show that the six prescriptions we have tested reproduce\nfairly consistent most of the observed trends, differing mostly in their\npredictions for the (poorly-constrained) outskirts of the Milky Way and the\nevolution in time of its radial structure. Among them, the model proposed by\nAscasibar et al. (2017), where the conversion of diffuse gas into molecular\nclouds depends on the local stellar and gas densities as well as on the gas\nmetallicity, seems to provide the best overall match to the observed data.\n", "  The Taurus-Auriga association and its associated molecular cloud are a\nbenchmark population for studies of star and planet formation. The census of\nTaurus-Auriga has been assembled over seven decades and has inherited the\nbiases, incompleteness, and systematic uncertainties of the input studies. The\nnotably unusual shape of the inferred IMF and the existence of several isolated\ndisk-bearing stars suggest that additional (likely disk-free) members might\nremain to be discovered. We therefore have begun a global reassessment of the\nmembership of Taurus-Auriga that exploits new data and better definitions of\nyouth and kinematic membership. As a first step, we reconsider the membership\nof all disk-free candidate members from the literature with spectral type\n$\\ge$F0, $3^h50^m<\\alpha<5^h40^m$, and $14^{\\circ}<\\delta<34^{\\circ}$. We\ncombine data from the literature with Keck/HIRES and UH88/SNIFS spectra to test\nthe membership of these candidates using HR diagram positions, proper motions,\nRVs, H$\\alpha$, lithium, and surface gravity. We find 218 confirmed or likely\nTaurus members, 160 confirmed or likely interlopers, and only 18 that still\nlack sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions. A significant fraction of\nthese stars (81/218=37%) are not included in the most recent canonical member\nlists. Intriguingly, there are few additional members in the immediate vicinity\nof the molecular clouds, preserving the IMFs that have been deemed anomalous in\npast work. Many of the likely Taurus members are distributed broadly across the\nsearch area. When combined with known disk hosts, our updated census reveals\ntwo regimes: a high-density population with a high disk fraction (indicative of\nyouth) that broadly traces the molecular clouds, and a low-density population\nwith low disk fraction (hence likely older) that most likely represents\nprevious generations of star formation.\n", "  We introduce the Dense Basis method for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\nfitting. It accurately recovers traditional SED parameters, including M$_*$,\nSFR and dust attenuation, and reveals previously inaccessible information about\nthe number and duration of star formation episodes and the timing of stellar\nmass assembly, as well as uncertainties in these quantities. This is done using\nbasis Star Formation Histories (SFHs) chosen by comparing the goodness-of-fit\nof mock galaxy SEDs to the goodness-of-reconstruction of their SFHs. We train\nand validate the method using a sample of realistic SFHs at $z =1$ drawn from\nstochastic realisations, semi-analytic models, and a cosmological\nhydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation. The method is then applied to a\nsample of 1100 CANDELS GOODS-S galaxies at $1<z<1.5$ to illustrate its\ncapabilities at moderate S/N with 15 photometric bands. Of the six\nparametrizations of SFHs considered, we adopt linear-exponential,\nbessel-exponential, lognormal and gaussian SFHs and reject the traditional\nparametrizations of constant (Top-Hat) and exponential SFHs. We quantify the\nbias and scatter of each parametrization. $15\\%$ of galaxies in our CANDELS\nsample exhibit multiple episodes of star formation, with this fraction\ndecreasing above $M_*>10^{9.5}M_\\odot$. About $40\\%$ of the CANDELS galaxies\nhave SFHs whose maximum occurs at or near the epoch of observation. The Dense\nBasis method is scalable and offers a general approach to a broad class of\ndata-science problems.\n", "  We report on the detection of a remarkable new fast high-energy transient\nfound in the Chandra Deep Field-South, robustly associated with a faint\n($m_{\\rm R}=27.5$ mag, $z_{\\rm ph}$$\\sim$2.2) host in the CANDELS survey. The\nX-ray event is comprised of 115$^{+12}_{-11}$ net 0.3-7.0 keV counts, with a\nlight curve characterised by a $\\approx$100 s rise time, a peak 0.3-10 keV flux\nof $\\approx$5$\\times$10$^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, and a power-law decay\ntime slope of $-1.53\\pm0.27$. The average spectral slope is\n$\\Gamma=1.43^{+0.23}_{-0.13}$, with no clear spectral variations. The\n\\hbox{X-ray} and multi-wavelength properties effectively rule out the vast\nmajority of previously observed high-energy transients. A few theoretical\npossibilities remain: an \"orphan\" X-ray afterglow from an off-axis\nshort-duration Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) with weak optical emission; a\nlow-luminosity GRB at high redshift with no prompt emission below $\\sim$20 keV\nrest-frame; or a highly beamed Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) involving an\nintermediate-mass black hole and a white dwarf with little variability.\nHowever, none of the above scenarios can completely explain all observed\nproperties. Although large uncertainties exist, the implied rate of such events\nis comparable to those of orphan and low-luminosity GRBs as well as rare TDEs,\nimplying the discovery of an untapped regime for a known transient class, or a\nnew type of variable phenomena whose nature remains to be determined.\n", "  We report new multi-colour photometry and high-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations of the long-period variable V501 Aur, previously considered to be\na weak-lined T-Tauri star belonging to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region.\nThe spectroscopic observations reveal that V501 Aur is a single-lined\nspectroscopic binary system with a 68.8-day orbital period, a slightly\neccentric orbit (e ~ 0.03), and a systemic velocity discrepant from the mean of\nTaurus-Auriga. The photometry shows quasi-periodic variations on a different,\n~55-day timescale that we attribute to rotational modulation by spots. No\neclipses are seen. The visible object is a rapidly rotating (vsini ~ 25 km/s)\nearly K star, which along with the rotation period implies it must be large (R\n> 26.3 Rsun), as suggested also by spectroscopic estimates indicating a low\nsurface gravity. The parallax from the Gaia mission and other independent\nestimates imply a distance much greater than the Taurus-Auriga region,\nconsistent with the giant interpretation. Taken together, this evidence\ntogether with a re-evaluation of the LiI~$\\lambda$6707 and H$\\alpha$ lines\nshows that V501 Aur is not a T-Tauri star, but is instead a field binary with a\ngiant primary far behind the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. The large mass\nfunction from the spectroscopic orbit and a comparison with stellar evolution\nmodels suggest the secondary may be an early-type main-sequence star.\n", "  We present all the leading twist T-even TMDs in the light-front quark diquark\nmodel(LFQDM) and study the relations among them. The model contains both the\nscalar and vector diquarks with the light front wave functions modeled from the\nsoft-wall AdS/QCD prediction. The $x-p^2_\\perp$ factorization used in\nphenomenological extraction for TMDs is observed in this model. We present the\nresults for the quark densities and the transverse shape of proton. The shape\nof the transversely polarized proton is shown to be non-spherical for nonzero\ntransverse momentum. The scale evolution of both integrated and unintegrated\nTMDs are also presented in this paper.\n", "  We carry out numerical simulations of the collapse of a complex rotating\nscalar field of the form $\\Psi(t,r,\\theta)=e^{im\\theta}\\Phi(t,r)$, giving rise\nto an axisymmetric metric, in 2+1 spacetime dimensions with cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda<0$, for $m=0,1,2$, for four 1-parameter families of initial\ndata. We look for the familiar scaling of black hole mass and maximal Ricci\ncurvature as a power of $|p-p_*|$, where $p$ is the amplitude of our initial\ndata and $p_*$ some threshold. We find evidence of Ricci scaling for all\nfamilies, and tentative evidence of mass scaling for most families, but the\ncase $m>0$ is very different from the case $m=0$ we have considered before: the\nthresholds for mass scaling and Ricci scaling are significantly different (for\nthe same family), scaling stops well above the scale set by $\\Lambda$, and the\nexponents depend strongly on the family. Hence, in contrast to the $m=0$ case,\nand to many other self-gravitating systems, there is only weak evidence for the\ncollapse threshold being controlled by a self-similar critical solution and no\nevidence for it being universal.\n", "  IPCVs contain a magnetic, rotating white dwarf surrounded by a magnetically\ntruncated accretion disk. To explain their strong flickering X-ray emission,\naccretion has been successfully taken into account. Nevertheless, observations\nsuggest that accretion phenomena could not be the only process behind it. An\nintense flaring activity occurring on the surface of the disk may generate a\ncorona, contribute to the thermal X-ray emission and influence the system\nstability. Our purposes are: investigating the formation of an extended corona\nabove the accretion disk, due to an intense flaring activity occurring on the\ndisk surface; studying its effects on the disk and stellar magnetosphere;\nassessing its contribution to the observed X-ray flux. We have developed a 3D\nMHD model of a IPCV. The model takes into account gravity, disk viscosity,\nthermal conduction, radiative losses and coronal flare heating. To perform a\nparameter space exploration, several system conditions have been considered,\nwith different magnetic field intensity and disk density values. From the\nresults of the evolution of the model, we have synthesized the thermal X-ray\nemission. The simulations show the formation of an extended corona, linking\ndisk and star. The flaring activity is capable of strongly influencing the disk\nconfiguration and its stability, effectively deforming the magnetic field\nlines. Hot plasma evaporation phenomena occur in the layer immediately above\nthe disk. The flaring activity gives rise to a thermal X-ray emission in both\nthe [0.1-2.0] keV and the [2.0-10] keV bands. An intense coronal activity\noccurring on the disk surface of an IPCV can affect the structure of the disk\ndepending noticeably on the density of the disk and the magnetic field of the\ncentral object. Moreover, the synthesis of the thermal X-ray fluxes shows that\nthis flaring activity may contribute to the observed thermal X-ray emission.\n", "  We investigate the integrated properties of massive (>10 Msun), rotating,\nsingle-star stellar populations for a variety of initial rotation rates\n(v/vcrit=0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6). We couple the new MESA Isochrone and\nStellar Tracks (MIST) models to the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis\n(FSPS) package, extending the stellar population synthesis models to include\nthe contributions from very massive stars (>100 Msun), which can be significant\nin the first ~4 Myr after a starburst. These models predict ionizing\nluminosities that are consistent with recent observations of young nuclear star\nclusters. We also construct composite stellar populations assuming a\ndistribution of initial rotation rates. Even in low-metallicity environments\nwhere rotation has a significant effect on the evolution of massive stars, we\nfind that stellar population models require a significant contribution from\nfast-rotating (v/vcrit>0.4) stars in order to sustain the production of\nionizing photons beyond a few Myr following a starburst. These results have\npotentially important implications for cosmic reionization by massive stars and\nthe interpretation of nebular emission lines in high-redshift star-forming\ngalaxies.\n", "  In an effort to understand the cause of the apparent depletion in the number\ndensity of radio-loud AGNs at $z>3$, this work investigates the viability of\nthe so-called Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) quenching mechanism of\nintrinsically jetted, high-z AGNs, whereby Inverse Compton scattering of CMB\nphotons off electrons within the extended lobes results in a substantial\ndimming of the lobe synchrotron emission at GHz frequencies, while\nsimultaneously boosting their diffuse X-ray signal. We focus on five $z>3.5$\nradio galaxies that have sufficiently deep Chandra exposure (> 50 ks) to\nwarrant a meaningful investigation of any extended X-ray emission. For those\nobjects with evidence for statistically significant extended X-ray lobes (4C\n41.17 and 4C 03.24), we combine the Chandra measurements with literature data\nat lower frequencies to assemble the systems' Spectral Energy Distributions\n(SEDs), and utilize state-of-the-art SED modelling (Ghisellini et al. 2015) --\nincluding emission from the disk, torus, jet, hotspots, and lobes -- to infer\ntheir physical parameters. For both radio galaxies, the magnetic energy density\nin the hotspots is found to exceed the energy density in CMB photons, wheres\nthe opposite is true for the lobes. This implies that any extended synchrotron\nemission likely originates from the hotspots themselves, rather than the lobes.\nConversely, Inverse Compton scattering of CMB photons dominates the extended\nX-ray emission from the lobes, which are effectively \"radio-quenched\". As a\nresult, CMB quenching is effective in these systems in spite of the fact that\nthe observed X-ray to radio luminosity ratio does not bear the signature\n$(1+z)^4$ dependence of the CMB energy density.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength study into the nature of faint radio sources in\na deep radio image with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 612\\,MHz\ncovering 1.2 deg$^2$ of the ELAIS N1 region. We detect 2800 sources above\n50~$\\mu$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$. By matching to multi-wavelength data we obtain a\nredshift estimate for 63\\%, with 29\\% based on spectroscopy. For 1526 of the\nsources with redshifts we use radio and X-ray luminosity, optical spectroscopy,\nmid-infrared colors, and 24$\\mu$m and IR to radio flux ratios to search for the\npresence of an AGN. The analysis reveals a rapid change in the population as\nflux density decreases from $\\sim$500\\,$\\mu$Jy to $\\sim$100\\,$\\mu$Jy. We find\nthat 80.3\\% of the objects show no evidence of AGN and have multi-wavelength\nproperties consistent with radio emission from star forming galaxies (SFG). We\nclassify 11.4\\% as Radio Quiet (RQ) AGN and the remaining 8.3\\% as Radio Loud\n(RL) AGN.\n  The redshift of all populations extends to $z > 3$ with a median of $\\sim$1.\nThe median radio and far-IR luminosity increases systematically from SFG, to RQ\nAGN and RL AGN. The median $q_{\\rm 24 \\mu m}$ for SFG, $0.89\\pm0.01$ is\nslightly below that for RQ AGN, $1.05\\pm0.03$, and both differ substantially\nfrom the value for RL AGN of $-0.06\\pm0.07$. However, SFG and RQ AGN show no\nsignificant difference in far-IR/radio ratios and have statistically\nindistinguishable star formation rates inferred from radio and far-IR\nluminosities. We conclude that radio emission from host galaxies of RQ AGN in\nthis flux density regime result primarily from star formation activity.\n", "  We present a search for the synchrotron emission from the synchrotron cosmic\nweb by cross correlating 180MHz radio images from the Murchison Widefield Array\nwith tracers of large scale structure (LSS). We use two versions of the radio\nimage covering $21.76\\times 21.76$ degrees with point sources brighter than\n0.05 Jy subtracted, with and without filtering of Galactic emission. As tracers\nof the LSS we use the Two-Micron-All-Sky-Survey (2MASS) and the Widefield\nInfraRed Explorer (WISE) redshift catalogues to produce galaxy number density\nmaps. The cross correlation functions all show peak amplitudes at zero degrees,\ndecreasing with varying slopes towards zero correlation over a range of one\ndegree. The cross correlation signals include components from point source,\nGalactic, and extragalactic diffuse emission. We use models of the diffuse\nemission from smoothing the density maps with Gaussians of sizes 1-4 Mpc to\nfind limits on the cosmic web components. From these models we find surface\nbrightness 99.7 per cent upper limits in the range of 0.09-2.20 mJy beam$^{-1}$\n(average beam size of 2.6 arcmin), corresponding to 0.01-0.30 mJy\narcmin$^{-2}$. Assuming equipartition between energy densities of cosmic rays\nand the magnetic field, the flux density limits translate to magnetic field\nstrength limits of 0.03-1.98 $\\mu$G, depending heavily on the spectral index.\nWe conclude that for a 3$\\sigma$ detection of 0.1 $\\mu$G magnetic field\nstrengths via cross correlations, image depths of sub-mJy to sub-$\\mu$Jy are\nnecessary. We include discussion on the treatment and effect of extragalactic\npoint sources and Galactic emission, and next steps for building on this work.\n", "  Infrared excesses around metal polluted white dwarfs have been associated\nwith the accretion of dusty, planetary material. This work analyses the\navailable infrared data for an unbiased sample of white dwarfs and demonstrates\nthat no more than 3.3% can have a wide, flat, opaque dust disc, extending to\nthe Roche radius, with a temperature at the disc inner edge of $T_{in} =\n1,400$K, the standard model for the observed excesses. This is in stark\ncontrast to the incidence of pollution of about 30%. We present four potential\nreasons for the absence of an infrared excess in polluted white dwarfs,\ndepending on their stellar properties and inferred accretion rates: i) their\ndust discs are opaque, but narrow, thus evading detection if more than 85% of\npolluted white dwarfs have dust discs narrower than $\\delta r< 0.04r$, ii)\ntheir dust discs have been fully consumed, which only works for the oldest\nwhite dwarfs with sinking timescales longer than hundreds of years, iii) their\ndust is optically thin, which can supply low accretion rates of $<10^7\n$gs$^{-1}$ if dominated by PR-drag, and higher accretion rates, if inwards\ntransport of material is enhanced, for example due to the presence of gas, iv)\ntheir accretion is supplied by a pure gas disc, which could result from the\nsublimation of optically thin dust for T* > 20, 000K. Future observations\nsensitive to faint infrared excesses or the presence of gas, can test the\nscenarios presented here, thereby better constraining the nature of the\nmaterial fuelling accretion in polluted white dwarfs.\n", "  All X-ray light curves of nova V4743 Sgr (2002), taken during and after\noutburst, contain a 0.75 mHz periodic signal that can most plausibly be\ninterpreted as being excited by the rotation of the white dwarf in an\nintermediate polar system. This interpretation faces the challenge of an\napparent multi-frequency nature of this signal in the light curves taken days\n180 and 196 after outburst. We show that the multi-sine fit method, based on a\nsuperposition of two sine functions, yields two inherently indistinguishable\nsolutions, i.e. the presence of two close frequencies, or a single signal with\nconstant frequency but variable modulation amplitude. Using a power spectrum\ntime map, we show that on day 180, a reduction of the modulation amplitude of\nthe signal coincides with a substantial overall flux decline while on day 196,\nthe signal was only present during the first half of the observation. Supported\nby simulations, we show that such variations in amplitude can lead to false\nbeating that manifests itself as a multiple signal if computing a periodogram\nover the full light curve. Therefore, the previously proposed double frequency\nnature of both light curves was probably an artefact while we consider a single\nsignal with frequency equal to the white dwarf rotation as more plausible.\n", "  We report a high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (laser-ARPES) study of single crystals of FeSe, focusing on the\ntemperature-dependence of the hole-like bands around the ${\\rm \\Gamma}$ point.\nAs the system cools through the tetragonal-orthorhombic \"nematic\" structural\ntransition at 90~K, the splitting of the $d_{xz}$/$d_{yz}$ bands is observed to\nincrease by a magnitude of 13 meV. Moreover, the onset of a $\\sim$10 meV\ndownward shift of the $d_{xy}$ band is also at 90~K. These measurements provide\nclarity on the nature, magnitude and temperature-dependence of the band shifts\nat the ${\\rm \\Gamma}$ point in the nematic phase of FeSe.\n", "  We investigate how star formation is spatially organized in the grand-design\nspiral NGC 1566 from deep HST photometry with the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV\nSurvey (LEGUS). Our contour-based clustering analysis reveals 890 distinct\nstellar conglomerations at various levels of significance. These star-forming\ncomplexes are organized in a hierarchical fashion with the larger congregations\nconsisting of smaller structures, which themselves fragment into even smaller\nand more compact stellar groupings. Their size distribution, covering a wide\nrange in length-scales, shows a power-law as expected from scale-free\nprocesses. We explain this shape with a simple \"fragmentation and enrichment\"\nmodel. The hierarchical morphology of the complexes is confirmed by their\nmass--size relation which can be represented by a power-law with a fractional\nexponent, analogous to that determined for fractal molecular clouds. The\nsurface stellar density distribution of the complexes shows a log-normal shape\nsimilar to that for supersonic non-gravitating turbulent gas. Between 50 and 65\nper cent of the recently-formed stars, as well as about 90 per cent of the\nyoung star clusters, are found inside the stellar complexes, located along the\nspiral arms. We find an age-difference between young stars inside the complexes\nand those in their direct vicinity in the arms of at least 10 Myr. This\ntimescale may relate to the minimum time for stellar evaporation, although we\ncannot exclude the in situ formation of stars. As expected, star formation\npreferentially occurs in spiral arms. Our findings reveal turbulent-driven\nhierarchical star formation along the arms of a grand-design galaxy.\n", "  We analyze the evolution of Fe XII coronal plasma upflows from the edges of\nten active regions (ARs) as they cross the solar disk using the Hinode Extreme\nUltraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS). Confirming the results of Demoulin et\nal. (2013, Sol. Phys. 283, 341), we find that for each AR there is an observed\nlong term evolution of the upflows which is largely due to the solar rotation\nprogressively changing the viewpoint of dominantly stationary upflows. From\nthis projection effect, we estimate the unprojected upflow velocity and its\ninclination to the local vertical. AR upflows typically fan away from the AR\ncore by 40 deg. to near vertical for the following polarity. The span of\ninclination angles is more spread for the leading polarity with flows angled\nfrom -29 deg. (inclined towards the AR center) to 28 deg. (directed away from\nthe AR). In addition to the limb-to-limb apparent evolution, we identify an\nintrinsic evolution of the upflows due to coronal activity which is AR\ndependent. Further, line widths are correlated with Doppler velocities only for\nthe few ARs having the largest velocities. We conclude that for the line widths\nto be affected by the solar rotation, the spatial gradient of the upflow\nvelocities must be large enough such that the line broadening exceeds the\nthermal line width of Fe XII. Finally, we find that upflows occurring in pairs\nor multiple pairs is a common feature of ARs observed by Hinode/EIS, with up to\nfour pairs present in AR 11575. This is important for constraining the upflow\ndriving mechanism as it implies that the mechanism is not a local one occurring\nover a single polarity. AR upflows originating from reconnection along\nquasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) between over-pressure AR loops and neighboring\nunder-pressure loops is consistent with upflows occurring in pairs, unlike\nother proposed mechanisms acting locally in one polarity.\n", "  A large fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are \"invisible\" in extant\noptical surveys due to either distance or dust-obscuration. The existence of\nthis large population of dust-obscured, infrared-bright AGN is predicted by\nmodels of galaxy - supermassive black hole coevolution and is required to\nexplain the observed X-ray and infrared backgrounds. Recently, infrared\ncolour-cuts with WISE have identified a portion of this missing population.\nHowever, as the host galaxy brightness relative to that of the AGN increases,\nit becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between infrared emission\noriginating from the AGN and from its host galaxy. As a solution, we have\ndeveloped a new method to select obscured AGN using their 20 cm continuum\nemission to identify the objects as AGN. We created the resulting Invisible AGN\nCatalogue by selecting objects that are detected in AllWISE (mid-IR) and FIRST\n(20 cm), but are not detected in SDSS (optical) or 2MASS (near-IR), producing a\nfinal catalogue of 46,258 objects. 30 per cent of the objects are selected by\nexisting selection methods, while the remaining 70 per cent represent a\npotential previously-unidentified population of candidate AGN that are missed\nby mid-infrared colour cuts. Additionally, by relying on a radio continuum\ndetection, this technique is efficient at detecting radio-loud AGN at z > 0.29,\nregardless of their level of dust obscuration or their host galaxy's relative\nbrightness.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBH) could account for variety of phenomena like dark\nmatter, reionization of the Universe, early quasars, coalescence of black holes\nregistered through gravitational waves recently. Each phenomenon relates to PBH\nof a specific mass range. PBH mass spectra varies in a wide range depending on\nspecific model. Earlier we have shown that PBH with monochromatic mass\ndistribution around $5\\times 10^{16}$ g value allow to re-ionize the Universe\nmoderately. Here we show that reionization effect and contribution to dark\nmatter can be simultaneously enhanced with more natural extended mass\ndistribution in the range around the same mass value.\n", "  We combine current measurements of the local expansion rate, $H_0$, and Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) estimates of helium abundance with the latest cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration to discuss the\nobservational viability of the scale invariant Harrison-Zeldovch-Peebles (HZP)\nspectrum. We also analyze some of its extensions, namely, HZP + $Y_P$ and HZP +\n$N_{eff}$, where $Y_P$ is the primordial helium mass fraction and $N_{eff}$ is\nthe effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom. We perform a Bayesian\nanalysis and show that the latter model is favored with respect to the standard\ncosmology for values of $N_{eff}$ lying in the interval $3.70 \\pm 0.13$\n($1\\sigma$), which is currently allowed by some independent analyses.\n", "  We present optical spectroscopy of candidate AGN pinpointed by a Swift\nfollow-up campaign on unidentified transients in the XMM-Newton Slew Survey,\nincreasing the completeness of the identifications of AGN in the Survey. Our\nSwift follow-up campaign identified 17 XRT-detected candidate AGN, of which\nnine were selected for optical follow-up and a further two were confirmed as\nAGN elsewhere. Using data obtained at the William Herschel Telescope, Very\nLarge Telescope and New Technology Telescope, we find AGN features in seven of\nthe candidates. We classify six as Seyfert types 1.0 to 1.5, with broad-line\nregion velocities spanning 2000--12000 km s$^{-1}$, and identify one as a\npossible Type II AGN, consistent with the lack of a soft band X-ray detection\nin the Slew Survey. The Virial black hole mass estimates for the sample lie\nbetween 1$\\times$10$^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and 3$\\times$10$^9$ M$_{\\odot}$, with one\nsource likely emitting close to its Eddington rate, $L_{\\rm Bol}/L_{\\rm Edd}\n\\sim 0.9$. We find a wide redshift range of $0.08<z<0.9$ for the nine now\nconfirmed AGN drawn from the unidentified Slew Survey sample. One source\nremaining unclassified shows outbursts rarely seen before in AGN. We conclude\nthat AGN discovered in this way are consistent with the largely non-varying,\nSlew-selected, known AGN population. We also find parallels with XMM-Newton\nBright Serendipitous Survey AGN selected from pointed observations, and\npostulate that shallow X-ray surveys select AGN drawn from the same populations\nthat have been characterised in deeper X-ray selected samples.\n", "  The screened Coulomb interaction between a pair of infinite parallel planes\nwith spatially varying surface charge is considered in the limit of small\nelectrical potentials for arbitrary Debye lengths. A simple expression for the\ndisjoining pressure is derived in terms of a two dimensional integral in\nFourier space. The integral is evaluated for periodic and random charge\ndistributions and the disjoining pressure is expressed as a sum over\nFourier-Bloch reciprocal lattice vectors or in terms of an integral involving\nthe autocorrelation function respectively. The force between planes with a\nfinite area of uniform charge, a model for the DLVO interaction between finite\nsurfaces, is also calculated. It is shown that the overspill of the charge\ncloud beyond the region immediately between the charged areas results in a\nreduction of the disjoining pressure, as reported by us recently in the long\nDebye length limit for planes of finite width.\n", "  The Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) onboard the NASA Solar Maximum Mission\nwas part of the X-ray Polychromator, which observed numerous flares and bright\nactive regions from February to November 1980, when operation was suspended as\na result of the failure of the spacecraft fine pointing system. Observations\nresumed following the Space Shuttle SMM Repair Mission in April 1984 and\ncontinued until November 1989. BCS spectra have been widely used in the past to\nobtain temperatures, emission measures, and turbulent and bulk flows during\nflares, as well as element abundances. Instrumental details including\ncalibration factors not previously published are given here, and the in-orbit\nperformance of the BCS is evaluated. Some significant changes during the\nmission are described, and recommendations for future instrumentation are made.\nUsing improved estimates for the instrument parameters and operational limits,\nit is now possible to obtain de-convolved, calibrated spectra that show finer\ndetail than before, providing the means to improved interpretation of the\nphysics of the emitting plasmas. The results indicate how historical, archived\ndata can be re-used to obtain enhanced and new, scientifically valuable\nresults.\n", "  The X-ray source 2XMM J123103.2+110648 was previously found to show pure\nthermal X-ray spectra and a ~3.8 hr periodicity in three XMM-Newton X-ray\nobservations in 2003-2005, and the optical spectrum of the host galaxy\nsuggested it as a type 2 active galactic nucleus candidate. We have obtained\nnew X-ray observations of the source, with Swift and Chandra in 2013-2016, in\norder to shed new light on its nature based on its long-term evolution\nproperty. We found that the source could be in an X-ray outburst, with the\nX-ray flux decreasing by an order of magnitude in the Swift and Chandra\nobservations, compared with the XMM-Newton observations ten years ago. There\nseemed to be significant spectral softening associated with the drop of X-ray\nflux (disk temperature kT ~ 0.16-0.2 keV in XMM-Newton observations versus\nkT~0.09+-0.02 keV in the Chandra observation. Therefore the Swift and Chandra\nfollow-up observations support our previous suggestion that the source could be\na tidal disruption event (TDE), though it seems to evolve slower than most of\nthe other TDE candidates. The apparent long duration of this event could be due\nto the presence of a long super-Eddington accretion phase and/or slow\ncircularization.\n", "  We present K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) observations of 18 Red\nSupergiant (RSG) stars in the Sculptor Group galaxy NGC 55. Radial velocities\nare calculated and are shown to be in good agreement with previous estimates,\nconfirming the supergiant nature of the targets and providing the first\nspectroscopically confirmed RSGs in NGC 55. Stellar parameters are estimated\nfor 14 targets using the $J$-band analysis technique, making use of\nstate-of-the-art stellar model atmospheres. The metallicities estimated confirm\nthe low-metallicity nature of NGC 55, in good agreement with previous studies.\nThis study provides an independent estimate of the metallicity gradient of NGC\n55, in excellent agreement with recent results published using hot massive\nstars. In addition, we calculate luminosities of our targets and compare their\ndistribution of effective temperatures and luminosities to other RSGs, in\ndifferent environments, estimated using the same technique.\n", "  The third Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) $\\gamma$-ray source catalog (3FGL)\ncontains over 1000 objects for which there is no known counterpart at other\nwavelengths. The physical origin of the $\\gamma$-ray emission of those objects\nis unknown. Such objects are commonly referred to as unassociated and mostly do\nnot exhibit significant $\\gamma$-ray flux variability. We performed a survey of\nall unassociated $\\gamma$-ray sources found in 3FGL using the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array and Very Large Array in the range of 4.0-10.0 GHz. We\nfound 2097 radio candidates for association with $\\gamma$-ray sources. The\nfollow-up with very long baseline interferometry for a subset of those\ncandidates yielded 142 new AGN associations with $\\gamma$-ray sources, provided\nalternative associations for 7 objects, and improved positions for another 144\nknown associations to the milliarcsecond level of accuracy. In addition, for\n245 unassociated $\\gamma$-ray sources we did not find a single compact radio\nsource above 2 mJy within 3$\\sigma$ of their $\\gamma$-ray localization. A\nsignificant fraction of these empty fields, 39%, are located away from the\ngalactic plane. We also found 36 extended radio sources that are candidates for\nassociation with a corresponding $\\gamma$-ray object, 19 of which are most\nlikely supernova remnants or HII regions, whereas 17 could be radio galaxies.\n", "  We examine the H$\\beta$ Lick index in a sample of $\\sim 24000$ massive ($\\rm\nlog(M/M_{\\odot})>10.75$) and passive early-type galaxies extracted from SDSS at\nz<0.3, in order to assess the reliability of this index to constrain the epoch\nof formation and age evolution of these systems. We further investigate the\npossibility of exploiting this index as \"cosmic chronometer\", i.e. to derive\nthe Hubble parameter from its differential evolution with redshift, hence\nconstraining cosmological models independently of other probes. We find that\nthe H$\\beta$ strength increases with redshift as expected in passive evolution\nmodels, and shows at each redshift weaker values in more massive galaxies.\nHowever, a detailed comparison of the observed index with the predictions of\nstellar population synthesis models highlights a significant tension, with the\nobserved index being systematically lower than expected. By analyzing the\nstacked spectra, we find a weak [NII]$\\lambda6584$ emission line (not\ndetectable in the single spectra) which anti-correlates with the mass, that can\nbe interpreted as a hint of the presence of ionized gas. We estimated the\ncorrection of the H$\\beta$ index by the residual emission component exploiting\ndifferent approaches, but find it very uncertain and model-dependent. We\nconclude that, while the qualitative trends of the observed H$\\beta$-z\nrelations are consistent with the expected passive and downsizing scenario, the\npossible presence of ionized gas even in the most massive and passive galaxies\nprevents to use this index for a quantitative estimate of the age evolution and\nfor cosmological applications.\n", "  The low mass X-ray binary 2A 1822-371 is an eclipsing system with an\naccretion disc corona and with an orbital period of 5.57 hr. The primary is an\n0.59 s X-ray pulsar with a proposed strong magnetic field of 10^10-10^12 G. In\nthis paper we study the spin evolution of the pulsar and constrain the geometry\nof the system. We find that, contrary to previous claims, a thick corona is not\nrequired, and that the system characteristics could be best explained by a thin\naccretion outflow due to a super-Eddington mass transfer rate and a\ngeometrically thick inner accretion flow. The orbital, spectral and timing\nobservations can be reconciled in this scenario under the assumption that the\nmass transfer proceeds on a thermal timescale which would make 2A 1822-371, a\nmildly super-Eddington source viewed at high inclination angles. The timing\nanalysis on 13 years of RXTE data show a remarkably stable spin-up that implies\nthat 2A 1822-371, might quickly turn into a millisecond pulsar in the next few\nthousand years.\n", "  The rare decay $B\\to K^\\ast( \\to K\\pi) \\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ is expected to play an\nimportant role in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model at the near\nfuture $B$-physics experiments. We investigate resonant and non-resonant\nbackgrounds that arise beyond the narrow-width approximation for the $K^\\ast$.\nNon-resonant $B\\to K\\pi \\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decays are analyzed in the region of low\nhadronic recoil, where $B \\to K \\pi$ form factors from\nHeavy-Hadron-Chiral-Perturbation Theory are available. In a Breit-Wigner-type\nmodel interference-induced effects in the $K^*$ signal region are found to be\nsizable, as large as $20\\%$ in the branching ratio. Corresponding effects in\nthe longitudinal polarization fraction $F_L$ are smaller, at most around few\n\\%. Effects of the broad scalar states $K_0^\\ast$ and $\\kappa$ are at the level\nof percent in the branching fraction in the $K^\\ast$ signal region and\nnegligible in $F_L$. Since the backgrounds to $F_L$ are small this observable\nconstitutes a useful probe of form factors calculations, or alternatively, of\nright-handed currents in the entire $q^2$-region. The forward-backward\nasymmetry in the $K \\pi$-system, $A_{\\rm FB \\, L}^K$, with normalization to the\nlongitudinal decay rate probes predominantly S,P-wave interference free of\nshort-distance coefficients and can therefore be used to control the resonant\nand non-resonant backgrounds.\n", "  Past studies based on optical spectroscopy suggest that the five $\\omega$ Cen\npulsators form a rather homogeneous group of hydrogen-rich subdwarf O stars\nwith effective temperatures of around 50 000 K. This places the stars below the\nred edge of the theoretical instability strip in the log $g$ $-$ Teff diagram,\nwhere no pulsation modes are predicted to be excited. Our goal is to determine\nwhether this temperature discrepancy is real, or whether the stars' effective\ntemperatures were simply underestimated. We present a spectral analysis of two\nrapidly pulsating extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars found in $\\omega$ Cen.\nWe obtained Hubble Space Telescope/COS UV spectra of two $\\omega$ Cen\npulsators, V1 and V5, and used the ionisation equilibrium of UV metallic lines\nto better constrain their effective temperatures. As a by-product we also\nobtained FUV lightcurves of the two pulsators. Using the relative strength of\nthe N IV and N V lines as a temperature indicator yields Teff values close to\n60 000 K, significantly hotter than the temperatures previously derived. From\nthe FUV light curves we were able to confirm the main pulsation periods known\nfrom optical data. With the UV spectra indicating higher effective temperatures\nthan previously assumed, the sdO stars would now be found within the predicted\ninstability strip. Such higher temperatures also provide consistent\nspectroscopic masses for both the cool and hot EHB stars of our previously\nstudied sample.\n", "  We describe a versatile mechanism that provides tight-binding models with an\nenriched, topologically nontrivial bandstructure. The mechanism is algebraic in\nnature, and leads to tight-binding models that can be interpreted as a\nnon-trivial square root of a parent lattice Hamiltonian---in analogy to the\npassage from a Klein-Gordon equation to a Dirac equation. In the tight-binding\nsetting, the square-root operation admits to induce spectral symmetries at the\nexpense of broken crystal symmetries. As we illustrate in detail for a simple\none-dimensional example, the emergent and inherited spectral symmetries equip\nthe energy gaps with independent topological quantum numbers that control the\nformation of topologically protected states. We also describe an implementation\nof this system in silicon photonic structures, outline applications in higher\ndimensions, and provide a general argument for the origin and nature of the\nemergent symmetries, which are typically nonsymmorphic.\n", "  Motivated by the large number of compact extrasolar planetary systems\ndiscovered by the Kepler Mission, this paper considers perturbations due to\npossible additional outer planets. The discovered compact systems sometimes\ncontain multiple transiting planets, so that their orbital angular momentum\nvectors are tightly aligned. Since planetary orbits are susceptible to forced\noscillations of their inclination angles, the highly aligned nature of these\nsystems places constraints on possible additional (non-transiting) planets. If\nplanets in the outer regions of these solar systems have sufficiently large\nmass or sufficiently small semi-major axis, they will induce the compact inner\norbits to oscillate in and out of a transiting configuration. This paper\nconsiders the dynamics of the compact systems discovered to host five or more\nplanets. In order to not perturb these systems out of a continually, mutually\ntransiting state, additional planetary companions must generally have\nperiastron $p>10$ AU. Specific constraints are found for each of the 18\nplanetary systems considered, which are obtained by marginalising over other\norbital parameters using three different choices of priors for the companion\nproperties (a uniform prior, a transit-inspired prior, and an non-transiting\ndisk prior). A separate ensemble of numerical experiments shows that these\ncompact systems generally cannot contain Jupiter-analogs without disrupting the\nobserved orbits. We also consider how these constraints depend on system\nproperties and find that the surface density of the planetary system is one of\nthe most important variables. Finally, we provide specific results for two\nsystems, WASP-47 and Kepler-20, for which this analysis provides interesting\nconstraints.\n", "  We use simulated planetary systems to model the planet multiplicity of Kepler\nstars. Previous studies have underproduced single planet systems and invoked\nthe so called Kepler dichotomy, where the planet forming ability of a Kepler\nstar is dichotomous, producing either few or many transiting planets. In this\npaper we show that the Kepler dichotomy is only required when the inner part of\nplanetary disks are just assumed to be flared. When the inner part of planetary\ndisks are flat, we reproduce the observed planet multiplicity of Kepler stars\nwithout the need to invoke a dichotomy. We find that independent of the disk\nmodel assumed, the mean number of planets per star is approximately 2 for\norbital periods between 3 and 200 days, and for planetary radii between 1 and 5\nEarth radii. This contrasts with the Solar System where no planets occupy the\nsame parameter space.\n", "  We present spectral and timing analyses of simultaneous X-ray and UV\nobservations of the VY Scl system MV Lyr taken by XMM-Newton, containing the\nlongest continuous X-ray+UV light curve and highest signal-to-noise X-ray\n(EPIC) spectrum to date. The RGS spectrum displays emission lines plus\ncontinuum, confirming model approaches to be based on thermal plasma models. We\ntest the sandwiched model based on fast variability that predicts a\ngeometrically thick corona that surrounds an inner geometrically thin disc. The\nEPIC spectra are consistent with either a cooling flow model or a 2-T\ncollisional plasma plus Fe emission lines in which the hotter component may be\npartially absorbed which would then originate in a central corona or a\npartially obscured boundary layer, respectively. The cooling flow model yields\na lower mass accretion rate than expected during the bright state, suggesting\nan evaporated plasma with a low density, thus consistent with a corona. Timing\nanalysis confirms the presence of a dominant break frequency around log(f/Hz) =\n-3 in the X-ray Power Density Spectrum (PDS) as in the optical PDS. The complex\nsoft/hard X-ray light curve behaviour is consistent with a region close to the\nwhite dwarf where the hot component is generated. The soft component can be\nconnected to an extended region. We find another break frequency around\nlog(f/Hz) = -3.4 that is also detected by Kepler. We compared flares at\ndifferent wavelengths and found that the peaks are simultaneous but the rise to\nmaximum is delayed in X-rays with respect to UV.\n", "  Numerical models for the atmospheres of magnetic ApBp stars have in the past\ndealt only with centred dipole magnetic field geometries. These models include\natomic diffusion that stratifies the abundances of metals according to the\nlocal magnetic field strength and the direction with respect to the surface\nnormal. The magnetic variations with rotational phase of most well observed\nstars however reveal that this assumption is far too simplistic. In this work\nwe establish for the first time a three-dimensional (3D) model with abundance\nstratifications arising from atomic diffusion of 16 metals, adopting a\nnon-axisymmetric magnetic field geometry inspired by the configuration derived\nfor a real ApBp star. We find that the chemical elements are distributed in\ncomplex patterns in all three dimensions, far from the simple rings that have\nbeen proposed as the dominant abundance structures from calculations that\nassume a perfectly centred dipolar magnetic geometry\n", "  The honeycomb lattice iridates $A_2$IrO$_3$ ($A =$ Na, Li) are candidates for\nrealization of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model although their proximity to Kitaev's\nquantum Spin-Liquid (QSL) is still debated. We report on heat capacity $C$ and\nentropy $S_{mag}$ for $A_2$IrO$_3$ ($A =$ Na, Li) in the temperature range\n$0.075~{\\rm K}\\leq T \\leq 155$~K\\@. We find a well separated two-peak structure\nfor the magnetic heat capacity $C_{mag}$ for both materials and $S_{mag}$ for\nNa$_2$IrO$_3$ shows a shoulder between the peaks with a value close to ${1\\over\n2}$Rln$2$. These features signal the fractionalization of spins into Majornana\nFermions close to Kitaev's QSL [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 92}, 115122 (2015); Phys.\nRev. B {\\bf 93}, 174425 (2016).]. These results provide the first thermodynamic\nevidence that $A_2$IrO$_3$ are situated close to the Kitaev QSL. Additionally\nwe measure the high temperature $T\\leq 1000$~K magnetic susceptibility $\\chi$\nand estimate the Weiss temperature $\\theta$ in the true paramagnetic state. We\nfind $\\theta \\approx -127$~K and $-105$~K, for Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and Li$_2$IrO$_3$,\nrespectively.\n", "  Using N-body/gasdynamic simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy we analyse a\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation, $\\Sigma_{SFR} \\propto \\Sigma_{gas}^N$, at different\nspatial scales. We simulate synthetic observations in CO lines and UV band. We\nadopt the star formation rate defined in two ways: based on free fall collapse\nof a molecular cloud - $\\Sigma_{SFR, cl}$, and calculated by using a UV flux\ncalibration - $\\Sigma_{SFR, UV}$. We study a KS relation for spatially smoothed\nmaps with effective spatial resolution from molecular cloud scales to several\nhundred parsecs. We find that for spatially and kinematically resolved\nmolecular clouds the $\\Sigma_{SFR, cl} \\propto \\Sigma_{\\rm gas}^N$ relation\nfollows the power-law with index $N \\approx 1.4$. Using UV flux as SFR\ncalibrator we confirm a systematic offset between the $\\Sigma_{\\rm UV}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ distributions on scales compared to molecular cloud sizes.\nDegrading resolution of our simulated maps for surface densities of gas and\nstar formation rates we establish that there is no relation $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR,\nUV} - \\Sigma_{\\rm gas}$ below the resolution $\\sim 50$ pc. We find a transition\nrange around scales $\\sim 50-120$ pc, where the power-law index $N$ increases\nfrom 0 to 1-1.8 and saturates for scales larger $\\sim 120$ pc. A value of the\nindex saturated depends on a surface gas density threshold and it becomes\nsteeper for higher $\\Sigma_{gas}$ threshold. Averaging over scales with size of\n$>150$ pc the power-law index $N$ equals 1.3-1.4 for surface gas density\nthreshold $\\sim 5 M_\\odot$pc$^{-2}$. At scales $>120$ pc surface SFR densities\ndetermined by using CO data and UV flux, $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR, UV}/\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR,\ncl}$, demonstrate a discrepancy about a factor of 3. We argue that this may be\noriginated from overestimating (constant) values of conversion factor, star\nformation efficiency or UV calibration used in our analysis.\n", "  In this manuscript, we check the well-known correlation between \\oiii\nluminosity and continuum luminosity (\\loiiicon) for AGN by a large sample of\n1982 SDSS QSOs with $z<0.8$ and with high quality spectra. The strong\ncorrelation of \\loiiicon can be found, similar as previous results for AGN.\nMoreover, among the 1982 QSOs, there are 708 QSOs with the [O~{\\sc\niii}]$\\lambda$5007\\AA\\ described by two components: one core component plus one\nextended component. Based on the luminosity from the core components ($L_{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~narrow}$) and from the extended components ($L_{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~ext}$), we confirm that the correlation of $L_{{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~ext}}~-~L_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\AA}}}$ is more stronger and\ntighter than the correlations on the total \\oiii luminosity and on the\nluminosity of the core components of the \\oiii lines. Therefore, the luminosity\nof the extended components should be better applied to trace AGN intrinsic\nluminosity. Meanwhile, we have found strong line width correlation and line\nluminosity correlation between the core components and the extended components,\nindicating the extended components of the \\oiii lines should be not due to\ncommonly considered radial flows in the common \\oiii line clouds. And virial\neffects due to gravity of central black holes naturally lead to the wider\nextended components from regions more nearer to central black holes. Finally,\nwe can say that the reported correlation of $L_{{\\rm\n[O~\\textsc{iii}],~narrow}}~-~L_{{\\rm 5100\\textsc{\\AA}}}$ on the core components\nof the \\oiii lines should be more better to estimate AGN intrinsic luminosity\nin Type-2 narrow line AGN, because of totally/partly obscured extended\ncomponents.\n", "  The Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory obtains extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) spectra of the full-disk Sun at a\nspectral resolution of ~1 A and cadence of 10 s. Such a spectral resolution\nwould normally be considered to be too low for the reliable determination of\nelectron density (N_e) sensitive emission line intensity ratios, due to\nblending. However, previous work has shown that a limited number of Fe XXI\nfeatures in the 90-60 A wavelength region of EVE do provide useful\nN_e-diagnostics at relatively low flare densities (N_e ~ 10^11-10^12 cm^-3).\nHere we investigate if additional highly ionised Fe line ratios in the EVE\n90-160 A range may be reliably employed as N_e-diagnostics. In particular, the\npotential for such diagnostics to provide density estimates for high N_e\n(~10^13 cm^-3) flare plasmas is assessed. Our study employs EVE spectra for\nX-class flares, combined with observations of highly active late-type stars\nfrom the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) satellite plus experimental data\nfor well-diagnosed tokamak plasmas, both of which are similar in wavelength\ncoverage and spectral resolution to those from EVE. Several ratios are\nidentified in EVE data which yield consistent values of electron density,\nincluding Fe XX 113.35/121.85 and Fe XXII 114.41/135.79, with confidence in\ntheir reliability as N_e-diagnostics provided by the EUVE and tokamak results.\nThese ratios also allow the determination of density in solar flare plasmas up\nto values of ~10^13 cm^-3.\n", "  Spin-orbit misalignments have been detected in exoplanetary systems and\nbinary star systems. Tidal interactions may have played an important role in\nthe evolution of the spin-orbit angle. In this study, we investigate the tidal\ninteractions in spin-orbit misaligned systems. In particular, we focus on the\ntidal response of a rotating fluid body to the obliquity tide, which may be\nimportant for the evolution of the spin-orbit angle but hardly affects the\norbital evolution. The obliquity tide also provides a torque for the mutual\nprecession of the spin and orbital axes around the total angular momentum\nvector, which has not yet been considered in previous studies on the tidal\ninteractions. In this paper, we first formulate a set of linearized equations\ndescribing the tidal response in spin-orbit misaligned systems, taking into\naccount the precessional motion. Numerical solutions in a homogeneous fluid and\nin a polytrope of index 1 show that dissipative inertial waves can be excited\non top of precession by the obliquity tide in the presence of a rigid core. The\ntidal quality factor associated with the obliquity tide $Q'_{210}$ can be\nseveral orders of magnitude smaller than those associated with other tidal\ncomponents if their frequencies fall outside the frequency range of inertial\nwaves. Therefore, it is possible that the spin-orbit misalignment undergoes\nmuch more rapid decay than the orbital decay in hot Jupiter systems owing to\nthe enhanced dissipation of the obliquity tide.\n", "  Accurate and efficient methods to evaluate cosmological distances are an\nimportant tool in modern precision cosmology. In a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology,\nthe luminosity distance can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. We\nderive an alternative and simple expression for the luminosity distance in a\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM based on hypergeometric functions. Using a timing experiment\nwe compare the computation time for the numerical evaluation of the various\nexact formulae, as well as for two approximate fitting formulae available in\nthe literature. We find that our novel expression is the most efficient exact\nexpression in the redshift range $z\\gtrsim1$. Ideally, it can be combined with\nthe expression based on Carlson's elliptic integrals in the range $z\\lesssim1$\nfor high precision cosmology distance calculations over the entire redshift\nrange. On the other hand, for practical work where relative errors of about\n0.1% are acceptable, the analytical approximation proposed by Adachi & Kasai\n(2012) is a suitable alternative.\n", "  The 32 Orionis group was discovered almost a decade ago and despite the fact\nthat it represents the first northern, young (age ~ 25 Myr) stellar aggregate\nwithin 100 pc of the Sun ($d \\simeq 93$ pc), a comprehensive survey for members\nand detailed characterisation of the group has yet to be performed. We present\nthe first large-scale spectroscopic survey for new (predominantly M-type)\nmembers of the group after combining kinematic and photometric data to select\ncandidates with Galactic space motion and positions in colour-magnitude space\nconsistent with membership. We identify 30 new members, increasing the number\nof known 32 Ori group members by a factor of three and bringing the total\nnumber of identified members to 46, spanning spectral types B5 to L1. We also\nidentify the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) of the group, i.e. the luminosity\nat which lithium remains unburnt in a coeval population. We estimate the age of\nthe 32 Ori group independently using both isochronal fitting and LDB analyses\nand find it is essentially coeval with the {\\beta} Pictoris moving group, with\nan age of $24\\pm4$ Myr. Finally, we have also searched for circumstellar disc\nhosts utilising the AllWISE catalogue. Although we find no evidence for warm,\ndusty discs, we identify several stars with excess emission in the WISE W4-band\nat 22 {\\mu}m. Based on the limited number of W4 detections we estimate a debris\ndisc fraction of $32^{+12}_{-8}$ per cent for the 32 Ori group.\n", "  We present a catalog of hard X-ray sources in a square-degree region surveyed\nby NuSTAR in the direction of the Norma spiral arm. This survey has a total\nexposure time of 1.7 Ms, and typical and maximum exposure depths of 50 ks and 1\nMs, respectively. In the area of deepest coverage, sensitivity limits of\n$5\\times10^{-14}$ and $4\\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the 3-10 and\n10-20 keV bands, respectively, are reached. Twenty-eight sources are firmly\ndetected and ten are detected with low significance; eight of the 38 sources\nare expected to be active galactic nuclei. The three brightest sources were\npreviously identified as a low-mass X-ray binary, high-mass X-ray binary, and\npulsar wind nebula. Based on their X-ray properties and multi-wavelength\ncounterparts, we identify the likely nature of the other sources as two\ncolliding wind binaries, three pulsar wind nebulae, a black hole binary, and a\nplurality of cataclysmic variables (CVs). The CV candidates in the Norma region\nhave plasma temperatures of $\\approx$10-20 keV, consistent with the Galactic\nRidge X-ray emission spectrum but lower than temperatures of CVs near the\nGalactic Center. This temperature difference may indicate that the Norma region\nhas a lower fraction of intermediate polars relative to other types of CVs\ncompared to the Galactic Center. The NuSTAR log$N$-log$S$ distribution in the\n10-20 keV band is consistent with the distribution measured by Chandra at 2-10\nkeV if the average source spectrum is assumed to be a thermal model with\n$kT\\approx15$~keV, as observed for the CV candidates.\n", "  Many black hole (BH) candidates have been discovered in X-ray binaries and in\nthe nuclei of galaxies. The prediction of Einstein's general relativity is that\nBHs have an event horizon --- a one-way membrane through which particles fall\ninto the BH but cannot exit. However, except for the very few nearby\nsupermassive BH candidates, our telescopes are unable to resolve and provide a\ndirect proof of the event horizon. Here, we propose a novel observation that\nsupports the existence of event horizons around supermassive BH candidates\nheavier than 10^{7.5} solar masses. Instead of an event horizon, if the BH\ncandidate has a hard surface, when a star falls onto the surface, the shocked\nbaryonic gas will form a radiation pressure supported envelope that shines at\nthe Eddington luminosity for an extended period of time from months to years.\nWe show that such emission has already been ruled out by the Pan-STARRS1 3pi\nsurvey if supermassive BH candidates have a hard surface at radius larger than\n1 + 10^{-4.4} times the Schwarzschild radius. Future observations by LSST\nshould be able to improve the limit to 1 + 10^{-6}.\n", "  We present chemical abundances for 17 elements in a sample of 11 red giant\nbranch stars in NGC 6362 from UVES spectra. NGC 6362 is one of the least\nmassive globulars where multiple populations have been detected, yet its\ndetailed chemical composition has not been investigated so far. NGC 6362 turns\nout to be a metal-intermediate ([Fe/H]=-1.07\\pm0.01 dex) cluster, with its\n\\alpha- and Fe-peak elements content compatible with that observed in clusters\nwith similar metallicity. It also displays an enhancement in its s-process\nelement abundances. Among the light elements involved in the multiple\npopulations phenomenon, only [Na/Fe] shows star-to-star variations, while\n[Al/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] do not show any evidence for abundance spreads. A\ndifferential comparison with M4, a globular cluster with similar mass and\nmetallicity, reveals that the two clusters share the same chemical composition.\nThis finding suggests that NGC 6362 is indeed a regular cluster, formed from\ngas that has experienced the same chemical enrichment of other clusters with\nsimilar metallicity.\n", "  We have searched for HI 21-cm absorption in 11 strong MgII systems ($W_{\\rm\nr}$(MgII $\\lambda 2796$) $\\ge 1$ \\AA) at $0.3<z<0.5$ using the Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope. We have detected HI 21-cm absorption in two of these. From the\nintegrated optical depth ($\\int\\tau~dv$) we estimate $N$(HI) = $43 \\pm 2$ and\n$9 \\pm 2$ in units of $10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ for the absorbers towards J1428+2103\n($z_{abs} = 0.3940$) and J1551+0713 ($z_{abs} = 0.3289$), respectively,\nassuming spin temperature, $T_s = 100$ K, and gas covering factor, $C_f = 1$.\nThe velocity width of the HI absorption towards J1428+2103 and J1551+0713\nindicate that the gas temperature is $<1600$ K and $<350$ K, respectively. The\n$3\\sigma$ upper limits on $\\int\\tau~dv$ in case of the HI 21-cm non-detections\nindicate that these MgII absorbers are likely to arise from sub-damped\nLyman-$\\alpha$ systems, when we assume $T_s = 100$ K and $C_f = 1$. This is\nverified for one of the systems which has $N$(HI) measurement using\nLyman-$\\alpha$ absorption detected in the ultraviolet spectrum. We estimate the\ndetection rate of HI 21-cm absorption in strong MgII systems in our sample to\nbe $0.18^{+0.24}_{-0.12}$ at $z\\sim0.35$, for an integrated optical depth\nsensitivity of $\\le 0.3$ km s$^{-1}$. Comparing with the results of HI 21-cm\nabsorption surveys in strong MgII systems at higher redshifts from the\nliterature, we do not find any significant evolution in the incidence and\nnumber density per unit redshift of HI 21-cm absorbers in strong MgII systems\nover $0.3<z<1.5$.\n", "  In this letter we study the mean sizes of Halpha clumps in turbulent disk\ngalaxies relative to kinematics, gas fractions, and Toomre Q. We use 100~pc\nresolution HST images, IFU kinematics, and gas fractions of a sample of rare,\nnearby turbulent disks with properties closely matched to z~1.5-2 main-sequence\ngalaxies (the DYNAMO sample). We find linear correlations of normalized mean\nclump sizes with both the gas fraction and the velocity dispersion-to-rotation\nvelocity ratio of the host galaxy. We show that these correlations are\nconsistent with predictions derived from a model of instabilities in a\nself-gravitating disk (the so-called \"violent disk instability model\"). We also\nobserve, using a two-fluid model for Q, a correlation between the size of\nclumps and self-gravity driven unstable regions. These results are most\nconsistent with the hypothesis that massive star forming clumps in turbulent\ndisks are the result of instabilities in self-gravitating gas-rich disks, and\ntherefore provide a direct connection between resolved clump sizes and this in\nsitu mechanism.\n", "  The merging history of galaxies can be traced with studies of dynamically\nclose pairs. These consist of a massive primary galaxy and a less massive\nsecondary (or satellite) galaxy. The study of the stellar populations of\nsecondary (lower mass) galaxies in close pairs provides a way to understand\ngalaxy growth by mergers. Here we focus on systems involving at least one\nmassive galaxy - with stellar mass above $10^{11}M_\\odot$ in the highly\ncomplete GAMA survey. Our working sample comprises 2,692 satellite galaxy\nspectra (0.1<z<0.3). These spectra are combined into high S/N stacks, and\nbinned according to both an \"internal\" parameter, the stellar mass of the\nsatellite galaxy (i.e. the secondary), and an \"external\" parameter, selecting\neither the mass of the primary in the pair, or the mass of the corresponding\ndark matter halo. We find significant variations in the age of the populations\nwith respect to environment. At fixed mass, satellites around the most massive\ngalaxies are older and possibly more metal rich, with age differences ~1-2Gyr\nwithin the subset of lower mass satellites ($\\sim 10^{10}M_\\odot$). These\nvariations are similar when stacking with respect to the halo mass of the group\nwhere the pair is embedded. The population trends in the lower-mass satellites\nare consistent with the old stellar ages found in the outer regions of massive\ngalaxies.\n", "  We studied the emergence process of 42 active region (ARs) by analyzing the\ntime derivative, R(t), of the total unsigned flux. Line-of-sight magnetograms\nacquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) were used. A continuous piecewise linear fitting to\nthe R(t)-profile was applied to detect an interval, dt_2, of nearly-constant\nR(t) covering one or several local maxima. The averaged over dt_2 magnitude of\nR(t) was accepted as an estimate of the maximal value of the flux growth rate,\nR_MAX, which varies in a range of (0.5-5)x10^20 Mx hour^-1 for active regions\nwith the maximal total unsigned flux of (0.5-3)x10^22 Mx. The normalized flux\ngrowth rate, R_N, was defined under an assumption that the saturated total\nunsigned flux, F_MAX, equals unity. Out of 42 ARs in our initial list, 36 event\nwere successfully fitted and they form two subsets (with a small overlap of 8\nevents): the ARs with a short (<13 hours) interval dt_2 and a high (>0.024\nhour^-1) normalized flux emergence rate, R_N, form the \"rapid\" emergence event\nsubset. The second subset consists of \"gradual\" emergence events and it is\ncharacterized by a long (>13 hours) interval dt_2 and a low R_N (<0.024\nhour^-1). In diagrams of R_MAX plotted versus F_MAX, the events from different\nsubsets are not overlapped and each subset displays an individual power law.\nThe power law index derived from the entire ensemble of 36 events is\n0.69+-0.10. The \"rapid\" emergence is consistent with a \"two-step\" emergence\nprocess of a single twisted flux tube. The \"gradual\" emergence is possibly\nrelated to a consecutive rising of several flux tubes emerging at nearly the\nsame location in the photosphere.\n", "  Galaxies in clusters are strongly affected by their environment. They evolve\naccording to several physical mechanisms that are active in clusters. Their\nefficiency can strongly depend on the orbital configuration of the galaxies.\nOur aim is to analyse the orbits of the galaxies in the cluster Abell 85, based\non the study of the galaxy velocity anisotropy parameter. We have solved the\nJeans equation under the assumption that the galaxies in A85 are collisionless\nobjects, within the spherically symmetric gravitational potential of the\nvirialized cluster. The mass of the cluster was estimated with X-ray and\ncaustic analyses. We find that the anisotropy profile of the full galaxy\npopulation in A85 is an increasing monotonic function of the distance from the\ncluster centre: on average, galaxies in the central region (r/r200 < 0.3) are\non isotropic orbits, while galaxies in the outer regions are on radial orbits.\nWe also find that the orbital properties of the galaxies strongly depend on\ntheir stellar colour. In particular, blue galaxies are on less radial orbits\nthan red galaxies. The different families of cluster galaxies considered here\nhave the pseudo phase-space density profiles Q(r) and Qr(r) consistent with the\nprofiles expected in virialized dark matter halos in $N$-body simulations. This\nresult suggests that the galaxies in A85 have reached dynamical equilibrium\nwithin the cluster potential. Our results indicate that the origin of the blue\nand red colour of the different galaxy populations is the different orbital\nshape rather than the accretion time.\n", "  Both General Relativistic (GR) precession and the Lidov-Kozai mechanism,\nseparately, are known to play an important role in the orbital evolution of\nsolar system bodies. Previous works have studied these two mechanisms\nindependently in great detail. However, both these phenomena occurring at the\nsame time in real solar system bodies have rarely been explored. In this work,\nwe find a continuum connecting the GR precession dominant and Lidov-Kozai like\nmechanism dominant regimes, i.e. an intermediate regime where the competing\neffects of GR precession and Lidov-Kozai like oscillations co-exist\nsimultaneously. We find some real examples in the solar system in this\nintermediate regime. Moreover we identify a rare example amongst them, comet\n96P/Machholz 1, which shows significant changes in the rates of GR precession\n(an order of magnitude higher than Mercury's GR precession rate) due to\nsungrazing and sun colliding phases induced by Lidov-Kozai like oscillations.\nThis comet's combination of orbital elements and initial conditions (at the\npresent epoch) favour this measurable rapid change in GR precession (at some\npoints peaking up to 60 times Mercury's GR precession rate) along with\nprograde-retrograde inclination flip (due to Lidov-Kozai like oscillations).\nSimilar tests are performed for hundreds of bodies lying in the moderately low\nperihelion distance and moderately low semi-major axis phase space in the solar\nsystem, the present lowest perihelion distance asteroid 322P/SOHO 1, and\nfurther examples connected with 96P/Machholz 1 namely, the Marsden and Kracht\nfamilies of sungrazing comets plus low perihelion meteoroid streams like\nDaytime Arietids (ARI) and Southern Delta Aquariids (SDA).\n", "  Using high spatial and temporal resolution H$\\alpha$ data from the New Vacuum\nSolar Telescope (NVST) and simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO), we present a rare event on the interaction between two\nfilaments (F1 and F2) in AR 11967 on 2014 January 31. The adjacent two\nfilaments were almost perpendicular to each other. Their interaction was driven\nby the movement of F1 and started when the two filaments collided with each\nother. During the interaction, the threads of F1 continuously slipped from the\nnortheast to the southwest, accompanied by the brightenings at the junction of\ntwo filaments and the northeast footpoint of F2. Part of F1 and the main body\nof F2 became invisible in H$\\alpha$ wavelength due to the heating and the\nmotion of F2. At the same time, bright material initiated from the junction of\ntwo filaments were observed to move along F1. The magnetic connectivities of F1\nwere found to be changed after their interaction. These observations suggest\nthat magnetic reconnection was involved in the interaction of two filaments and\nresulted in the eruption of one filament.\n", "  The square Bi layers in $A$MnBi$_2$ ($A =$ Sr, Ca) host Dirac fermions which\ncoexist with antiferromagnetic order on the Mn sublattice below $T_\\mathrm{N} =\n290\\,$K (Sr) and $270\\,$K (Ca). We have measured the spin-wave dispersion in\nthese materials by triple-axis neutron spectroscopy. The spectra show\npronounced spin gaps of 10.2(2)$\\,$meV (Sr) and 8.3(8)$\\,$meV (Ca) and extend\nto a maximum energy transfer of 61 - 63$\\,$meV. The observed spectra can be\naccurately reproduced by linear spin-wave theory from an Heisenberg effective\nspin Hamiltonian. Detailed global fits of the full magnon dispersion are used\nto determine the in-plane and inter-layer exchange parameters as well as on the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy constant. To within experimental error we find no\nevidence that the magnetic dynamics are influenced by the Dirac fermions.\n", "  The recent Gaia Data Release 1 of stellar parallaxes provides ample\nopportunity to find metal-poor main-sequence stars with precise parallaxes. We\nselect 21 such stars with parallax uncertainties better than\n$\\sigma_\\pi/\\pi\\leq0.10$ and accurate abundance determinations suitable for\ntesting metal-poor stellar evolution models and determining the distance to\nGalactic globular clusters. A Monte Carlo analysis was used, taking into\naccount uncertainties in the model construction parameters, to generate stellar\nmodels and isochrones to fit to the calibration stars. The isochrones which fit\nthe calibration stars best were then used to determine the distances and ages\nof 22 globular clusters with metallicities ranging from -2.4 dex to -0.7 dex.\nWe find distances with an average uncertainty of 0.15 mag and absolute ages\nranging from 10.8 - 13.6 Gyr with an average uncertainty of 1.6 Gyr. Using\nliterature proper motion data we calculate orbits for the clusters finding six\nthat reside within the Galactic disk/bulge while the rest are considered halo\nclusters. We find no strong evidence for a relationship between age and\nGalactocentric distance, but we do find a decreasing age-[Fe/H] relation.\n", "  Density-functional theory calculations with spin-polarized generalized\ngradient approximation and Hubbard $U$ correction is carried out to investigate\nthe mechanical, structural, electronic and magnetic properties of graphitic\nheptazine with embedded $\\mathrm{Fe}$ atom under bi-axial tensile strain and\napplied perpendicular electric field. It was found that the binding energy of\nheptazine with embedded $\\mathrm{Fe}$ atom system decreases as more tensile\nstrain is applied and increases as more electric field strength is applied. Our\ncalculations also predict a band gap at a peak value of 5 tensile strain but at\nexpense of the structural stability of the system. The band gap opening at 5\ntensile strain is due to distortion in the structure caused by the repulsive\neffect in the cavity between the lone pairs of edge nitrogen atoms and\n$\\mathrm{d}_{{xy}}/\\mathrm{d}_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital of Fe atom, hence the\nunoccupied $\\mathrm{p}_z$-orbital is forced to shift towards higher energy. The\nelectronic and magnetic properties of the heptazine with embedded $\\mathrm{Fe}$\nsystem under perpendicular electric field up to a peak value of 10\n$\\mathrm{V/nm}$ is also well preserved despite obvious buckled structure. Such\nproperties may be desirable for diluted magnetic semiconductors, spintronics,\nand sensing devices.\n", "  The SCUBA-2 Ambitious Sky Survey (SASSy) is composed of shallow 850-$\\umu$m\nimaging using the Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) on the\nJames Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Here we describe the extraction of a catalogue\nof beam-sized sources from a roughly $120\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ region of the Galactic\nplane mapped uniformly (to an rms level of about 40\\,mJy), covering longitude\n120\\degr\\,$<$\\,\\textit{l}\\,$<$\\,140\\degr\\ and latitude\n$\\abs{\\textit{b}}$\\,$<$\\,2.9\\degr. We used a matched-filtering approach to\nincrease the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio in these noisy maps and tested the\nefficiency of our extraction procedure through estimates of the false discovery\nrate, as well as by adding artificial sources to the real images. The primary\ncatalogue contains a total of 189 sources at 850\\,$\\umu$m, down to a S/N\nthreshold of approximately 4.6. Additionally, we list 136 sources detected down\nto ${\\rm S/N}=4.3$, but recognise that as we go lower in S/N, the reliability\nof the catalogue rapidly diminishes. We perform follow-up observations of some\nof our lower significance sources through small targeted SCUBA-2 images, and\nlist 265 sources detected in these maps down to ${\\rm S/N}=5$. This illustrates\nthe real power of SASSy: inspecting the shallow maps for regions of 850-$\\umu$m\nemission and then using deeper targeted images to efficiently find fainter\nsources. We also perform a comparison of the SASSy sources with the Planck\nCatalogue of Compact Sources and the \\textit{IRAS} Point Source Catalogue, to\ndetermine which sources discovered in this field might be new, and hence\npotentially cold regions at an early stage of star formation.\n", "  We present a robust approach to incorporating models for the time-variable\nbroadening of the pulse profile due to scattering in the ionized interstellar\nmedium into profile-domain pulsar timing analysis. We use this approach to\nsimultaneously estimate temporal variations in both the dispersion measure (DM)\nand scattering, together with a model for the pulse profile that includes\nsmooth evolution as a function of frequency, and the pulsar's timing model. We\nshow that fixing the scattering timescales when forming time-of-arrival\nestimates, as has been suggested in the context of traditional pulsar timing\nanalysis, can significantly underestimate the uncertainties in both DM, and the\narrival time of the pulse, leading to bias in the timing parameters. We apply\nour method using a new, publicly available, GPU accelerated code, both to\nsimulations, and observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1643$-$1224. This\npulsar is known to exhibit significant scattering variability compared to\ntypical millisecond pulsars, and we find including low-frequency ($< 1$ GHz)\ndata without a model for these scattering variations leads to significant\nperiodic structure in the DM, and also biases the astrometric parameters at the\n$4\\sigma$ level, for example, changing proper motion in right ascension by\n$0.50 \\pm 0.12$. If low frequency observations are to be included when\nsignificant scattering variations are present, we conclude it is necessary to\nnot just model those variations, but also to sample the parameters that\ndescribe the variations simultaneously with all other parameters in the model,\na task for which profile domain pulsar timing is ideally suited.\n", "  Very few low-ionization broad absorption line (LoBAL) QSOs have been found at\nhigh redshifts to date. One high-redshift LoBAL QSO, J0122+1216, was recently\ndiscovered at the Lijiang 2.4-m Telescope with an initial redshift\ndetermination of 4.76. Aiming to investigate its physical properties, we\ncarried out follow-up observations in the optical and near-IR spectroscopy.\nNear-IR spectra from UKIRT and P200 confirms that it is a LoBAL, with a new\nredshift determination of $4.82\\pm0.01$ based on the \\mgii~ emission-line. The\nnew \\mgii~ redshift determination reveals strong blueshifts and asymmetry of\nthe high-ionization emission lines. We estimated a black hole mass of $\\sim\n2.3\\times 10^9 M_\\odot$ and Eddington ratio of $\\sim 1.0$ according to the\nempirical \\mgii-based single-epoch relation and bolometric correction factor.\nIt is possible that strong outflows are the result of an extreme quasar\nenvironment driven by the high Eddington ratio. A lower limit on the outflowing\nkinetic power ($>0.9\\% L_{Edd}$) was derived from both emission and absorption\nlines, indicating these outflows play a significant role in the feedback\nprocess to regulate the growth of its black hole as well as host galaxy\nevolution.\n", "  Recent studies have shown possible connections between highly magnetized\nneutron stars (\"magnetars\"), whose X-ray emission is too bright to be powered\nby rotational energy, and ordinary radio pulsars. In addition to the magnetar\nSGR J1745-2900, one of the radio pulsars in the Galactic centre (GC) region,\nPSR J1746-2850, had timing properties implying a large magnetic field strength\nand young age, as well as a flat spectrum. All characteristics are similar to\nthose of rare, transient, radio-loud magnetars. Using several deep\nnon-detections from the literature and two new detections, we show that this\npulsar is also transient in the radio. Both the flat spectrum and large\namplitude variability are inconsistent with the light curves and spectral\nindices of 3 radio pulsars with high magnetic field strengths. We further use\nfrequent, deep archival imaging observations of the GC in the past 15 years to\nrule out a possible X-ray outburst with a luminosity exceeding the rotational\nspin down rate. This source, either a transient magnetar without any detected\nX-ray counterpart or a young, strongly magnetized radio pulsar producing\nmagnetar-like radio emission, further blurs the line between the two\ncategories. We discuss the implications of this object for the radio emission\nmechanism in magnetars and for star and compact object formation in the GC.\n", "  In view of the ultrashort spatial and temporal scales involved, carrier\ncapture processes in nanostructures are genuine quantum phenomena. To describe\nsuch processes, methods with different levels of approximations have been\ndeveloped. By properly tailoring the Lindblad-based nonlinear single-particle\ndensity matrix equation provided by an alternative Markov approach, in this\nwork we present a Lindblad superoperator to describe how the phonon-induced\ncarrier capture affects the spatio-temporal quantum dynamics of a flying wave\npacket impinging on a quantum dot. We compare the results with non-Markovian\nquantum kinetics calculations and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the\ntwo approaches.\n", "  We report observations of dense molecular gas in the star-forming galaxy EGS\n13004291 (z=1.197) using the Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We tentatively\ndetect HCN and HNC (J=2-1) emission when stacked together at ~4sigma\nsignificance, yielding line luminosities of L_HCN (J=2-1) =(9 +/- 3) x 10^9 K\nkm s^-1 pc^2 and L_HNC (J=2-1)= (5 +/-2) x 10^9 K km s^-1 pc^2 respectively. We\nalso set 3sigma upper limits of < 7-8 x 10^9 K km s^-1 pc^2 on the HCO+, H2O\n(3_13-2_20) and HC3N (J=20-19) line luminosities. We serendipitously detect CO\nemission from two sources at z~1.8 and z~3.2 in the same field of view. We also\ndetect CO(J=2-1) emission in EGS 13004291, showing that the excitation in the\npreviously detected CO(J=3-2) line is subthermal (r_32=0.65 +/- 0.15). We find\na line luminosity ratio of L_HCN/L_CO=0.17 +/- 0.07 , as an indicator of the\ndense gas fraction. This is consistent with the median ratio observed in z>1\ngalaxies (L_HCN/L_CO=0.16 +/- 0.07) and nearby ULIRGs (L_HCN/L_CO=0.13 +/-\n0.03), but higher than in local spirals (L_HCN/L_CO=0.04 +/- 0.02). Although\nEGS 13004291 lies significantly above the galaxy main sequence at z~1, we do\nnot find an elevated star formation efficiency (traced by L_FIR/L_CO) as in\nlocal starbursts, but a value consistent with main-sequence galaxies. The\nenhanced dense gas fraction, the subthermal gas excitation, and the lower than\nexpected star formation efficiency of the dense molecular gas in EGS 13004291\nsuggest that different star formation properties may prevail in high-z\nstarbursts. Thus, using L_FIR/L_CO as a simple recipe to measure the star\nformation efficiency may be insufficient to describe the underlying mechanisms\nin dense star-forming environments inside the large gas reservoirs.\n", "  We use ALMA to detect and image CO (1-0) emission from Minkowski's Object, a\ndwarf galaxy that is interacting with a radio jet from a nearby elliptical\ngalaxy. These observations are the first to detect molecular gas in Minkowski's\nObject. We estimate the range in the mass of molecular gas in Minkowski's\nObject assuming two different values of the ratio of the molecular gas mass to\nthe CO luminosity, $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$. For the Milky Way value of $\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}=4.6~M_{\\odot}{\\rm (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$ we obtain a molecular gas mass\nof $M_{\\rm H_2} =3.0 \\times 10^7~M_{\\odot}$, 6% of the HI gas mass. We also use\nthe prescription of Narayanan et al. (2012) to estimate an $\\alpha_{\\rm\nCO}=27~M_{\\odot}{\\rm (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$, in which case we obtain $M_{\\rm\nH_2} =1.8 \\times 10^8~M_{\\odot}$, 36% of the HI mass. The observations are\nconsistent with previous claims of star formation being induced in Minkowski's\nObject via the passage of the radio jet, and it therefore being a rare local\nexample of positive feedback from an AGN. In particular, we find highly\nefficient star formation, with gas depletion timescales $\\sim 5\\times 10^7 -\n3\\times 10^8$yr (for assumed values of $\\alpha_{\\rm CO}=4.6$ and\n$27~M_{\\odot}{\\rm (K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2)^{-1}}$, respectively) in the upstream\nregions of Minkowski's Object that were struck first by the jet, and less\nefficient star formation downstream. We discuss the implications of this\nobservation for models of jet induced star formation and radio mode feedback in\nmassive galaxies.\n", "  The stiff equation of state (EoS) giving the neutron-star mass of\n$2M_{\\odot}$ suggests the existence of strongly repulsive many-body effect\n(MBE) not only in nucleon channels but also in hyperonic ones. As a specific\nmodel for MBE, the repulsive multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is added to\nthe two-body interaction together with the phenomenological three-body\nattraction. For various versions of the Nijmegen interaction models, the MBE\nparts are determined so as to reproduce the observed data of $B_\\Lambda$. The\nmass dependence of $B_\\Lambda$ values is shown to be reproduced well by adding\nMBE with the strong MPP repulsion assuring the stiff EoS of hyperon-mixed\nneutron-star matter, when $P$-state components of the adopted interaction model\nlead to almost vanishing contributions. The nuclear matter $\\Lambda\\!N$\n$G$-matrix interactions are derived and used in $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei on the\nbasis of the averaged-density approximation (ADA). The $B_\\Lambda$ values of\nhypernuclei with $9 \\le A \\le 59$ are analyzed in the framework of\nAntisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics with use of the two types of $\\Lambda\\!N$\n$G$-matrix interactions including strong and weak MPP repulsions. The\ncalculated values of $B_\\Lambda$ reproduce the experimental data finely within\na few hundred keV. The values of $B_\\Lambda$ in $p$-states also can be\nreproduced well, when ADA is modified to be suitable also to weakly-bound\n$\\Lambda$ states.\n", "  We study a possibility to detect signatures of brown dwarf companions in a\ncircumstellar disc based on spectral energy distributions (SED). We present the\nresults of SED simulations for a system with a 0.8 $M_{\\odot}$ central object\nand a companion with a mass of 30 $M_J$ embedded in a typical protoplanetary\ndisc. We use a solution to the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation to\ncalculate the protoplanetary disc flux density and assume, that the companion\nmoves along a circular orbit and clears a gap. The width of the gap is assumed\nto be the diameter of the brown dwarf Hill sphere. Our modelling shows that the\npresence of such a gap can initiate an additional minimum in the SED profile of\na protoplanetary disc at $\\lambda = 10 - 100$ $\\mu$m. We show that the depth of\nthis minimum and the wavelength of the maximum difference between the SEDs of\nthe system with and without a companion are related to the companion mass and\nits proximity to the star. We found that it is possible to detect signatures of\nthe companion when it is located within 10 AU, even when it is as small as 3\n$M_J$. We also analyse how the disc parameters (the inner radius and the\ntemperature profile) change the maximum difference between the SEDs for the\nsame systems with and without a companion. The SED of a protostellar disc with\na massive fragment might have a similar double peaked profile to the SED of a\nmore evolved disc that contains a gap. However, in this case, it will be caused\nby the presence of an additional maximum at shorter wavelengths and will be\nsimilar only when the massive fragment is relatively cold ($\\sim$400 K).\n", "  Galaxies that abruptly interrupt their star formation in < 1.5 Gyr present\nrecognizable features in their spectra (no emission and Hd in absorption) and\nare called post starburst (PSB) galaxies. By studying their stellar population\nproperties and their location within the clusters, we obtain valuable insights\non the physical processes responsible for star formation quenching. We present\nthe first complete characterization of PSB galaxies in clusters at 0.04 < z <\n0.07, based on WINGS and OmegaWINGS data, and contrast their properties to\nthose of passive (PAS) and emission line (EML) galaxies. For V < 20, PSBs\nrepresent 7.2 +/- 0.2% of cluster galaxies within 1.2 virial radii. Their\nincidence slightly increases from the outskirts toward the cluster center and\nfrom the least toward the most luminous and massive clusters, defined in terms\nof X-ray luminosity and velocity dispersion. The phase-space analysis and\nvelocity dispersion profile suggest that PSBs represent a combination of\ngalaxies with different accretion histories. Moreover, PSBs with the strongest\nHd are consistent with being recently accreted. PSBs have stellar masses,\nmagnitudes, colors and morphologies intermediate between PAS and EML galaxies,\ntypical of a population in transition from being star forming to passive.\nComparing the fraction of PSBs to the fraction of galaxies in transition on\nlonger timescales, we estimate that the short timescale star-formation\nquenching channel contributes two times more than the long timescale one to the\ngrowth of the passive population. Processes like ram-pressure stripping and\ngalaxy-galaxy interactions are more efficient than strangulation in affecting\nstar formation.\n", "  The early evolution of massive cluster progenitors is poorly understood. We\ninvestigate the fragmentation properties from 0.3 pc to 0.06 pc scales of a\nhomogenous sample of infrared-quiet massive clumps within 4.5 kpc selected from\nthe ATLASGAL survey. Using the ALMA 7m array we detect compact dust continuum\nemission towards all targets, and find that fragmentation, at these scales, is\nlimited. The mass distribution of the fragments uncovers a large fraction of\ncores above 40 $M_\\odot$, corresponding to massive dense cores (MDCs) with\nmasses up to ~400 $M_\\odot$. 77 % of the clumps contain at most 3 MDCs per\nclump, and we also reveal single clumps/MDCs. The most massive cores are formed\nwithin the more massive clumps, and a high concentration of mass on small\nscales reveals a high core formation efficiency. The mass of MDCs highly\nexceeds the local thermal Jeans-mass, and observational evidence is lacking for\na sufficiently high level of turbulence or strong enough magnetic fields to\nkeep the most massive MDCs in equilibrium. If already collapsing, the observed\nfragmentation properties with a high core formation efficiency are consistent\nwith the collapse setting in at parsec scales.\n", "  Using the two-temperature model for ultrafast matter (UFM), we compare the\nequation of state, pair-distribution functions $g(r)$, and phonons using the\nneutral pseudoatom (NPA) model with results from density-functional theory\n(DFT) codes and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations for Al, Li and Na. The NPA\napproach uses state-dependent first-principles pseudopotentials from an\n`all-electron' DFT calculation with finite-$T$ XCF. It provides pair\npotentials, structure factors, the\n  `bound' and `free' states, as well as a mean ionization $\\bar{Z}$\nunambiguously. These are not easily accessible {\\it via} DFT+MD calculations\nwhich become prohibitive for $T/T_F$ exceeding $\\sim 0.6$, where $T_F$ is the\nFermi temperature. Hence, both DFT+MD and NPA methods can be compared up to\n$\\sim 8$ eV, while higher $T$ can be addressed ${\\it via}$ the NPA. The\nhigh-$T_e$ phonon calculations raise the question of UFM lattice stability and\nsurface ablation in thin UFM samples. The ablation forces in a UFM slab are\nused to define an \"ablation time\" competing with phonon formation times in thin\nUFM samples. Excellent agreement for all properties is found between NPA and\nstandard DFT codes, even for Li where a strongly non-local pseudopotential is\nused in DFT codes. The need to use pseudopotentials appropriate to the\nionization state $\\bar{Z}$ is emphasized. The effect of finite-$T$\nexchange-correlation functional is illustrated via its effect on the pressure\nand the electron-density distribution at a nucleus.\n", "  When bosonic matter in the form of a complex scalar field is added to Ellis\nwormholes, the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking is observed.\nSymmetric solutions possess full reflection symmetry with respect to the radial\ncoordinate of the two asymptotically flat spacetime regions connected by the\nwormhole, whereas asymmetric solutions do not possess this symmetry. Depending\non the size of the throat, at bifurcation points pairs of asymmetric solutions\narise from or merge with the symmetric solutions. These asymmetric solutions\nare energetically favoured. When the backreaction of the boson field is taken\ninto account, this phenomenon is retained. Moreover, in a certain region of the\nsolution space both symmetric and asymmetric solutions exhibit a transition\nfrom single throat to double throat configurations.\n", "  We present quasar bolometric corrections using the [O III] $\\lambda5007$\nnarrow emission line luminosity based on the detailed spectral energy\ndistributions of 53 bright quasars at low to moderate redshift\n($0.0345<z<1.0002$). We adopted two functional forms to calculate\n$L_{\\textrm{iso}}$, the bolometric luminosity determined under the assumption\nof isotropy: $L_{\\textrm{iso}}=A\\,L_{[O\\,III]}$ for comparison with the\nliterature and log$(L_{iso})=B+C\\,$log$(L_{[O\\,III]})$, which better\ncharacterizes the data. We also explored whether \"Eigenvector 1\", which\ndescribes the range of quasar spectral properties and quantifies their\ndiversity, introduces scatter into the $L_{[O\\,III]}-L_{iso}$ relationship. We\nfound that the [O III] bolometric correction can be significantly improved by\nadding a term including the equivalent width ratio $R_{Fe\\,II}\\equiv\nEW_{Fe\\,II}/EW_{H\\beta}$, which is an Eigenvector 1 indicator. Inclusion of\n$R_{Fe\\,II}$ in predicting $L_{iso}$ is significant at nearly the $3\\sigma$\nlevel and reduces the scatter and systematic offset of the luminosity\nresiduals. Typically, [O III] bolometric corrections are adopted for Type 2\nsources where the quasar continuum is not observed and in these cases,\n$R_{Fe\\,II}$ cannot be measured. We searched for an alternative measure of\nEigenvector 1 that could be measured in the optical spectra of Type 2 sources\nbut were unable to identify one. Thus, the main contribution of this work is to\npresent an improved [O III] bolometric correction based on measured bolometric\nluminosities and highlight the Eigenvector 1 dependence of the correction in\nType 1 sources.\n", "  We present measurements of the singly ionized helium to hydrogen ratio\n($n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$) toward diffuse gas surrounding three Ultra-Compact HII\n(UCHII ) regions: G10.15-0.34, G23.46-0.20 \\& G29.96-0.02. We observe radio\nrecombination lines (RRLs) of hydrogen and helium near 5 GHz using the GBT to\nmeasure the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio. The measurements are motivated by the low\nhelium ionization observed in the warm ionized medium (WIM) and in the inner\nGalaxy diffuse ionized regions (DIR). Our data indicate that the helium is not\nuniformly ionized in the three observed sources. Helium lines are not detected\ntoward a few observed positions in sources G10.15-0.34 \\& G23.46-0.20 and the\nupper limits of the $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ ratio obtained are 0.03 and 0.05\nrespectively. The selected sources harbor stars of type O6 or hotter as\nindicated by helium line detection toward the bright radio continuum emission\nfrom the sources with mean $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ value 0.06$\\pm$0.02. Our data\nthus show that helium in diffuse gas located a few pc away from the young\nmassive stars embedded in the observed regions is not fully ionized.We\ninvestigate the origin of the non-uniform helium ionization and rule out the\npossibilities : (a) that the helium is doubly ionized in the observed regions\nand (b) that the low $n_{He^+}/n_{H^+}$ values are due to additional hydrogen\nionizing radiation produced by accreting low-mass stars (Smith 2014). We find\nthat selective absorption of ionizing photons by dust can result in low helium\nionization but needs further investigation to develop a self-consistent model\nfor dust in HII regions.\n", "  Young brown dwarfs share many properties with directly imaged giant\nextrasolar planets. They therefore provide unique laboratories for\ninvestigating the full range of temperature and mass encompasses by the growing\ncollection of planets discovered outside our Solar System. Furthermore, if they\ncan be tied to a particular group of coeval stars, they also provide vital\nanchor points for low-mass empirical isochrones. We have developed a novel\nprocedure for identifying such objects based on their unique 2MASS and AllWISE\ncolors. Using our search criteria, we have identified 50 new, late-type L dwarf\ncandidates, 47 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as L dwarfs with\nfollow-up near-infrared spectroscopy. We evaluate the potential membership of\nthese objects in nearby, young moving groups using their proper motions,\nphotometric distance estimates, and spectroscopic indicators of youth, and find\nseven likely L-type members belonging to the $\\beta$ Pictoris moving group, the\nAB Doradus moving group, the Tucana-Horologium association, or the Argus\nassociation, in addition to several lower probability members. Also found are\ntwo late-type (L5 and L6) potential members of the nearby Hyades cluster (WISEA\nJ043642.75$+$190134.8 and WISEA J044105.56$+$213001.5).\n", "  We introduce the Yale-Potsdam Stellar Isochrones (YaPSI), a new grid of\nstellar evolution tracks and isochrones of solar-scaled composition. In an\neffort to improve the Yonsei-Yale database, special emphasis is placed on the\nconstruction of accurate low-mass models (Mstar < 0.6 Msun), and in particular\nof their mass-luminosity and mass-radius relations, both crucial in\ncharacterizing exoplanet-host stars and, in turn, their planetary systems. The\nYaPSI models cover the mass range 0.15 to 5.0 Msun, densely enough to permit\ndetailed interpolation in mass, and the metallicity and helium abundance ranges\n[Fe/H] = -1.5 to +0.3, and Y = 0.25 to 0.37, specified independently of each\nother (i.e., no fixed Delta Y/Delta Z relation is assumed). The evolutionary\ntracks are calculated from the pre-main sequence up to the tip of the red giant\nbranch. The isochrones, with ages between 1 Myr and 20 Gyr, provide UBVRI\ncolors in the Johnson-Cousins system, and JHK colors in the homogeneized\nBessell & Brett system, derived from two different semi-empirical Teff-color\ncalibrations from the literature. We also provide utility codes, such as an\nisochrone interpolator in age, metallicity, and helium content, and an\ninterface of the tracks with an open-source Monte Carlo Markov-Chain tool for\nthe analysis of individual stars. Finally, we present comparisons of the YaPSI\nmodels with the best empirical mass- luminosity and mass-radius relations\navailable to date, as well as isochrone fitting of well-studied ste\n", "  The anisotropy of magnetic properties commonly is introduced in textbooks\nusing the case of an antiferromagnetic system with Ising type anisotropy. This\nmodel presents huge anisotropic magnetization and a pronounced metamagnetic\ntransition and is well-known and well-documented both, in experiments and\ntheory. In contrast, the case of an antiferromagnetic $X$-$Y$ system with weak\nin-plane anisotropy is only poorly documented. We studied the anisotropic\nmagnetization of the compound GdRh$_2$Si$_2$ and found that it is a perfect\nmodel system for such a weak-anisotropy setting because the Gd$^{3+}$ ions in\nGdRh$_2$Si$_2$ have a pure spin moment of S=7/2 which orders in a simple AFM\nstructure with ${\\bf Q} = (001)$. We observed experimentally in $M(B)$ a\ncontinuous spin-flop transition and domain effects for field applied along the\n$[100]$- and the $[110]$-direction, respectively. We applied a mean field model\nfor the free energy to describe our data and combine it with an Ising chain\nmodel to account for domain effects. Our calculations reproduce the\nexperimental data very well. In addition, we performed magnetic X-ray\nscattering and X-ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements, which confirm\nthe AFM propagation vector to be ${\\bf Q} = (001)$ and indicate the absence of\npolarization on the rhodium atoms.\n", "  We present broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and light curves of\nthe gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 measured in the X-ray and the\ngamma-ray bands. We find that the orbital modulation in the low-energy\ngamma-ray band is similar to that in the X-ray band, suggesting a common\nspectral component. However, above a GeV the orbital light curve changes\nsignificantly. We suggest that the GeV band contains significant flux from a\npulsar magnetosphere, while the X-ray to TeV light curves are dominated by\nsynchrotron and Compton emission from an intrabinary shock (IBS). We find that\na simple one-zone model is inadequate to explain the IBS emission, but that\nbeamed Synchrotron-self Compton radiation from adiabatically accelerated plasma\nin the shocked pulsar wind can reproduce the complex multiband light curves,\nincluding the variable X-ray spike coincident with the gamma-ray maximum. The\nmodel requires inclination $\\sim$50$^\\circ$ and orbital eccentricity\n$\\sim$0.35, consistent with the limited constraints from existing optical\nobservations. This picture motivates searches for pulsations from the energetic\nyoung pulsar powering the wind shock.\n", "  Because of the high fraction of refractory material present in comets, the\nheat produced by the radiogenic decay of elements such as aluminium and iron\ncan be high enough to induce the loss of ultravolatile species such as\nnitrogen, argon or carbon monoxide during their accretion phase in the\nprotosolar nebula. Here, we investigate how heat generated by the radioactive\ndecay of 26Al and 60Fe influences the formation of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, as a function of its accretion time and size of\nparent body. We use an existing thermal evolution model that includes various\nphase transitions, heat transfer in the ice-dust matrix, and gas diffusion\nthroughout the porous material, based on thermodynamic parameters derived from\nRosetta observations. Two possibilities are considered: either, to account for\nits bilobate shape, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was assembled from two primordial\n~2 kilometer-sized planetesimals, or it resulted from the disruption of a\nlarger parent body with a size corresponding to that of comet Hale-Bopp (~70\nkm). To fully preserve its volatile content, we find that either\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's formation was delayed between ~2.2 and 7.7 Myr\nafter that of Ca-Al-rich Inclusions in the protosolar nebula or the comet's\naccretion phase took place over the entire time interval, depending on the\nprimordial size of its parent body and the composition of the icy material\nconsidered. Our calculations suggest that the formation of\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is consistent with both its accretion from primordial\nbuilding blocks formed in the nebula or from debris issued from the disruption\nof a Hale-Bopp-like body.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between the Zeeman interaction and the\ninversion asymmetry induced spin orbit interactions (Rashba and Dresselhaus\nSOIs) in GaAs hole quantum point contacts. The presence of a strong SOI results\nin crossing and anti-crossing of adjacent spin-split hole subbands in a\nmagnetic field. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the\nanti-crossing energy gap depends on the interplay between the SOI terms and the\nhighly anisotropic hole g tensor, and that this interplay can be tuned by\nselecting the crystal axis along which the current and magnetic field are\naligned. Our results constitute independent detection and control of the\nDresselhaus and Rashba SOIs in hole systems, which could be of importance for\nspintronics and quantum information applications.\n", "  In this article, we present our global QCD analysis of leading neutron\nproduction in deep inelastic scattering at H1 and ZEUS collaborations. The\nanalysis is performed in the framework of a perturbative QCD description for\nsemi-inclusive processes which is based on the fracture functions approach.\nModeling the non-perturbative part of the fragmentation process at the input\nscale Q$_0^2$, we analyze the Q$^2$-dependence of the leading neutron structure\nfunctions and obtain the neutron fracture functions (neutron FFs) from\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) global QCD fit to data. We have also performed a\ncareful estimation of the uncertainties using the \"Hessian method\" for the\nneutron FFs and corresponding observables originating from experimental errors.\nThe predictions based on the obtained neutron FFs are in good agreement with\nall data analyzed, at small and large longitudinal momentum fraction $x_L$ as\nwell as the scaled fractional momentum variable $\\beta$.\n", "  We directly detect dust emission in an optically-detected, multiply-imaged\ngalaxy lensed by the Frontier Fields cluster MACSJ0717.5+3745. We detect two\nimages of the same galaxy at 1.1mm with the AzTEC camera on the Large\nMillimeter Telescope leaving no ambiguity in the counterpart identification.\nThis galaxy, MACS071_Az9, is at z>4 and the strong lensing model (mu=7.5)\nallows us to calculate an intrinsic IR luminosity of 9.7e10 Lsun and an\nobscured star formation rate of 14.6 +/- 4.5 Msun/yr. The unobscured star\nformation rate from the UV is only 4.1 +/- 0.3 Msun/yr which means the total\nstar formation rate (18.7 +/- 4.5 Msun/yr) is dominated (75-80%) by the\nobscured component. With an intrinsic stellar mass of only 6.9e9Msun,\nMACS0717_Az9 is one of only a handful of z>4 galaxies at these lower masses\nthat is detected in dust emission. This galaxy lies close to the estimated star\nformation sequence at this epoch. However, it does not lie on the dust\nobscuration relation (IRX-beta) for local starburst galaxies and is instead\nconsistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) attenuation law. This\nremarkable lower mass galaxy showing signs of both low metallicity and high\ndust content may challenge our picture of dust production in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  (Abridged) Low-luminosity, gas-rich blue compact galaxies (BCG) are ideal\nlaboratories to investigate many aspects of the star formation in galaxies. We\nstudy the morphology, stellar content, kinematics, and the nebular excitation\nand ionization mechanism in the BCG Haro 14 by means of integral field\nobservations with VIMOS in the VLT. From these data we build maps in continuum\nand in the brighter emission lines, produce line-ratio maps, and obtain the\nvelocity and velocity dispersion fields. We also generate the integrated\nspectrum of the major HII regions and young stellar clusters identified in the\nmaps to determine reliable physical parameters and oxygen abundances. We find\nas follows: i) the current star formation in Haro 14 is spatially extended with\nthe major HII regions placed along a linear structure, elongated in the\nnorth-south direction, and in a horseshoe-like curvilinear feature that extends\nabout 760 pc eastward; the continuum emission is more concentrated and peaks\nclose to the galaxy center; ii) two different episodes of star formation are\npresent: the recent starburst, with ages $\\leq$ 6 Myrs and the intermediate-age\nclusters, with ages between 10 and 30 Myrs; these stellar components rest on a\nseveral Gyr old underlying host galaxy; iii) the H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ pattern is\ninhomogeneous, with excess color values varying from E(B-V)=0.04 up to\nE(B-V)=1.09; iv) shocks play a significant role in the galaxy; and v) the\nvelocity field displays a complicated pattern with regions of material moving\ntoward us in the east and north galaxy areas. The morphology of Haro 14, its\nirregular velocity field, and the presence of shocks speak in favor of a\nscenario of triggered star formation. Ages of the knots are consistent with the\nongoing burst being triggered by the collective action of stellar winds and\nsupernovae originated in the central clusters.\n", "  Recently, two empirical correlations related to the minimum variability\ntimescale ($\\rm MTS$) of the lightcures are discovered in gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs). One is the anti-correlation between $\\rm MTS$ and Lorentz factor\n$\\Gamma$, the other is the anti-correlation between the $\\rm MTS$ and gamma-ray\nluminosity $L_\\gamma$. Both the two correlations might be used to explore the\nactivity of the central engine of GRBs. In this paper we try to understand\nthese empirical correlations by combining two popular black hole (BH) central\nengine models (namely, Blandford \\& Znajek mechanism and neutrino-dominated\naccretion flow). By taking the $\\rm MTS$ as the timescale of viscous\ninstability of the neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF), we find that these\ncorrelations favor the scenario in which the jet is driven by Blandford-Znajek\n(BZ) mechanism.\n", "  We revisit the proof of the perturbative QCD factorization for the exclusive\nprocesses $\\rho \\gamma^{\\star} \\to \\pi(\\rho)$ at the two-parton twist-3 level.\nIt is pointed out that the residual collinear divergences observed in the\nliterature, which break the factorization of the above processes at the\nconsidered accuracy, are attributed to the improper insertion of the Fierz\nidentity for factorizing the fermion flow. We show that the factorization\ntheorem indeed holds at the two-parton twist-3 level after the mishandling is\ncorrected.\n", "  We report the results of an XMM-Newton and NuSTAR coordinated observation of\nthe Supergiant Fast X-ray Transient (SFXT) IGRJ11215-5952, performed on\nFebruary 14, 2016, during the expected peak of its brief outburst, which\nrepeats every about 165 days. Timing and spectral analysis were performed\nsimultaneously in the energy band 0.4-78 keV. A spin period of 187.0 +/- 0.4 s\nwas measured, consistent with previous observations performed in 2007. The\nX-ray intensity shows a large variability (more than one order of magnitude) on\ntimescales longer than the spin period, with several luminous X-ray flares\nwhich repeat every 2-2.5 ks, some of which simultaneously observed by both\nsatellites. The broad-band (0.4-78 keV) time-averaged spectrum was well\ndeconvolved with a double-component model (a blackbody plus a power-law with a\nhigh energy cutoff) together with a weak iron line in emission at 6.4 keV\n(equivalent width, EW, of 40+/-10 eV). Alternatively, a partial covering model\nalso resulted in an adequate description of the data. The source time-averaged\nX-ray luminosity was 1E36 erg/s (0.1-100 keV; assuming 7 kpc). We discuss the\nresults of these observations in the framework of the different models proposed\nto explain SFXTs, supporting a quasi-spherical settling accretion regime,\nalthough alternative possibilities (e.g. centrifugal barrier) cannot be ruled\nout.\n", "  We report the virial measurements of the BH mass of a sample of 17 type 2\nAGN, drawn from the Swift/BAT 70-month 14-195 keV hard X-ray catalogue, where a\nfaint BLR component has been measured via deep NIR (0.8-2.5 $\\mu$m)\nspectroscopy. We compared the type 2 AGN with a control sample of 33 type 1\nAGN. We find that the type 2 AGN BH masses span the 5$<$ log(M$_{BH}$\n/M$_{\\odot}$) $< $7.5 range, with an average log(M$_{BH}$/M$_{\\odot}$) = 6.7,\nwhich is $\\sim$ 0.8 dex smaller than found for type 1 AGN. If type 1 and type 2\nAGN of the same X-ray luminosity log($L_{14-195}$/erg s$^{-1}$) $\\sim$ 43.5 are\ncompared, type 2 AGN have 0.5 dex smaller BH masses than type 1 AGN. Although\nbased on few tens of objects, this result disagrees with the standard AGN\nunification scenarios in which type 1 and type 2 AGN are the same objects\nobserved along different viewing angles with respect to a toroidal absorbing\nmaterial.\n", "  Neutron-star magnetospheres are structured by very intense magnetic fields\nextending from 100 to 10 5 km traveled by very energetic electrons and\npositrons with Lorentz factors up to $\\sim$ 10 7. In this context, particles\nare forced to travel almost along the magnetic field with very small\ngyro-motion, potentially reaching the quantified regime. We describe the state\nof Dirac particles in a locally uniform, constant and curved magnetic field in\nthe approximation that the Larmor radius is very small compared to the radius\nof curvature of the magnetic field lines. We obtain a result that admits the\nusual relativistic Landau states as a limit of null curvature. We will describe\nthe radiation of these states, that we call quantum curvature or\nsynchro-curvature radiation, in an upcoming paper.\n", "  In search of novel, improved materials for magnetic data storage and\nspintronic devices, compounds that allow a tailoring of magnetic domain shapes\nand sizes are essential. Good candidates are materials with intrinsic\nanisotropies or competing interactions, as they are prone to host various\ndomain phases that can be easily and precisely selected by external tuning\nparameters such as temperature and magnetic field. Here, we utilize vector\nmagnetic fields to visualize directly the magnetic anisotropy in the uniaxial\nferromagnet CeRu$_2$Ga$_2$B. We demonstrate a feasible control both globally\nand locally of domain shapes and sizes by the external field as well as a\nsmooth transition from single stripe to bubble domains, which opens the door to\nfuture applications based on magnetic domain tailoring.\n", "  Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is an important phenomenon observed in\nvarious fields including physics and biology. In this connection, we here show\nthat the trade-off between attractive and repulsive couplings can induce\nspontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous system of coupled oscillators.\nWith a simple model of a system of two coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators, we\ndemonstrate how the tendency of attractive coupling in inducing in-phase\nsynchronized (IPS) oscillations and the tendency of repulsive coupling in\ninducing out-of-phase synchronized (OPS) oscillations compete with each other\nand give rise to symmetry breaking oscillatory (SBO) states and interesting\nmultistabilities. Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and\nanti-synchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death\n(OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter\n(${\\lambda}$) is greater than the natural frequency ($\\omega$) of the system,\nthe attractive coupling favours the emergence of an anti-symmetric OD state via\na Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favours the emergence of a\nsimilar state through a saddle-node bifurcation. We show that an increase in\nthe repulsive coupling not only destabilizes the IPS state but also facilitates\nthe re-entrance of the IPS state.\n", "  The observed radial profiles of the X-ray emission from Pulsar Wind Nebulae\n(PWNe) have been claimed to conflict with the standard one-dimensional (1-D)\nsteady model. However, the 1-D model has not been tested to reproduce both the\nvolume-integrated spectrum and the radial profile of the surface brightness,\nsimultaneously. We revisit the 1-D steady model and apply it to PWNe 3C 58 and\nG21.5-0.9. We find that the parameters of the pulsar wind, the radius of the\ntermination shock $r_{\\rm s}$ and magnetization $\\sigma$, greatly affect both\nthe photon spectrum and radial profile of the emission. We have shown that the\nparameters constrained by the entire spectrum lead to a smaller X-ray nebula\nthan observed one. We have also tested the case that reproduces only the\nobservations in X and gamma-rays, ignoring the radio and optical components. In\nthis case, there are parameter sets that reproduce both the spectrum and\nemission profile, but the advection time to the edge of the nebula becomes much\nsmaller than the age. Our detailed discussion clarifies that the standard 1-D\nsteady model has severe difficulty to reproduce both the volume-integrated\nspectrum and the surface brightness simultaneously. This implies that the model\nshould be improved by taking into account extra physical processes such as\nspatial diffusion of particles. Additionally, we calculate the surface\nbrightness profile of the radio, optical and TeV gamma-rays. The future\nobservations in these wavelengths are also important to probe the spatial\ndistributions of the relativistic plasma and the magnetic field of PWNe.\n", "  We present a 0.4-8$\\mu$m multi-wavelength photometric catalog in the Extended\nGroth Strip (EGS) field. This catalog is built on the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) WFC3 and ACS data from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep\nExtragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), and it incorporates the existing HST\ndata from the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey (AEGIS)\nand the 3D-HST program. The catalog is based on detections in the F160W band\nreaching a depth of F160W=26.62 AB (90% completeness, point-sources). It\nincludes the photometry for 41457 objects over an area of $\\approx 206$\narcmin$^2$ in the following bands: HST ACS F606W and F814W; HST WFC3 F125W,\nF140W and F160W; CFHT/Megacam $u^*$, $g'$, $r'$, $i'$ and $z'$; CFHT/WIRCAM\n$J$, $H$ and $K_\\mathrm{S}$; Mayall/NEWFIRM $J1$, $J2$, $J3$, $H1$, $H2$, $K$;\nSpitzer IRAC $3.6\\mu$m, $4.5\\mu$m, $5.8\\mu$m and $8.0\\mu$m. We are also\nreleasing value-added catalogs that provide robust photometric redshifts and\nstellar mass measurements. The catalogs are publicly available through the\nCANDELS repository.\n", "  We show that the standard Skyrme model without pion mass term can be\nexpressed as a sum of two BPS submodels, i.e., of two models whose static field\nequations, independently, can be reduced to first order equations. Further,\nthese first order (BPS) equations have nontrivial solutions, at least locally.\nThese two submodels, however, cannot have common solutions. Our findings also\nshed some light on the rational map approximation. Finally, we consider certain\ngeneralisations of the BPS submodels.\n", "  Metal mixing plays critical roles in the enrichment of metals in galaxies.\nThe abundance of elements such as Mg, Fe, and Ba in metal-poor stars help us\nunderstand the metal mixing in galaxies. However, the efficiency of metal\nmixing in galaxies is not yet understood. Here we report a series of\n$N$-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of dwarf galaxies with\ndifferent efficiencies of metal mixing using turbulence-induced mixing model.\nWe show that metal mixing apparently occurs in dwarf galaxies from Mg and Ba\nabundance. We find that the scaling factor for metal diffusion larger than 0.01\nis necessary to reproduce the observation of Ba abundance in dwarf galaxies.\nThis value is consistent with the value expected from turbulence theory and\nexperiment. We also find that timescale of metal mixing is less than 40 Myr.\nThis timescale is shorter than that of typical dynamical times of dwarf\ngalaxies. We demonstrate that the determination of a degree of scatters of Ba\nabundance by the observation will help us to constrain the efficiency of metal\nmixing more precisely.\n", "  We analyze the single microlensing event OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 simultaneously\nobserved from two ground-based surveys and from \\textit{Spitzer}. The\n\\textit{Spitzer} data exhibit finite-source effects due to the passage of the\nlens close to or directly over the surface of the source star as seen from\n\\textit{Spitzer}. Such finite-source effects generally yield measurements of\nthe angular Einstein radius, which when combined with the microlens parallax\nderived from a comparison between the ground-based and the \\textit{Spitzer}\nlight curves, yields the lens mass and lens-source relative parallax. From this\nanalysis, we find that the lens of OGLE-2015-BLG-1482 is a very low-mass star\nwith the mass $0.10 \\pm 0.02 \\ M_\\odot$ or a brown dwarf with the mass $55\\pm 9\n\\ M_{J}$, which are respectively located at $D_{\\rm LS} = 0.80 \\pm 0.19\\\n\\textrm{kpc}$ and $ D_{\\rm LS} = 0.54 \\pm 0.08\\ \\textrm{kpc}$, and thus it is\nthe first isolated low-mass microlens that has been decisively located in the\nGalactic bulge. The fundamental reason for the degeneracy is that the\nfinite-source effect is seen only in a single data point from \\textit{Spitzer}\nand this single data point gives rise to two solutions for $\\rho$. Because the\n$\\rho$ degeneracy can be resolved only by relatively high cadence observations\naround the peak, while the \\textit{Spitzer} cadence is typically $\\sim 1\\,{\\rm\nday}^{-1}$, we expect that events for which the finite-source effect is seen\nonly in the \\textit{Spitzer} data may frequently exhibit this $\\rho$\ndegeneracy. For OGLE-2015-BLG-1482, the relative proper motion of the lens and\nsource for the low-mass star is $\\mu_{\\rm rel} = 9.0 \\pm 1.9\\ \\textrm{mas\nyr$^{-1}$}$, while for the brown dwarf it is $5.5 \\pm 0.5\\ \\textrm{mas\nyr$^{-1}$}$. Hence, the degeneracy can be resolved within $\\sim 10\\ \\rm yrs$\nfrom direct lens imaging by using next-generation instruments with high spatial\nresolution.\n", "  We study the temporal intensity profile, or pulse shape, of cosmic ray ground\nlevel enhancements (GLEs) by calculating the rise $(\\tau_\\mathrm{r})$ and decay\n$(\\tau_\\mathrm{d})$ times for a small subset of all available events. Although\nthese quantities show very large inter-event variability, a linear dependence\nof $\\tau_\\mathrm{d} \\approx 3.5 \\tau_\\mathrm{r}$ is found. We interpret these\nobservational findings in terms of an interplanetary transport model, thereby\nincluding the effects of scattering (in pitch-angle) as these particles\npropagate from (near) the Sun to Earth. It is shown that such a model can\naccount for the observed trends in the pulse shape, illustrating that\ninterplanetary transport must be taken into account when studying GLE events,\nespecially their temporal profiles. Furthermore, depending on the model\nparameters, the pulse shape of GLEs may be determined entirely by\ninterplanetary scattering, obscuring all information regarding the initial\nacceleration process, and hence making a classification between impulsive and\ngradual events, as is traditionally done, superfluous.\n", "  Galaxy mergers are likely to play a role in triggering active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), but the conditions under which this process occurs are poorly\nunderstood. In Paper I, we constructed a sample of spatially offset X-ray AGN\nthat represent galaxy mergers hosting a single AGN. In this paper, we use our\noffset AGN sample to constrain the parameters that affect AGN observability in\ngalaxy mergers. We also construct dual AGN samples with similar selection\nproperties for comparison. We find that the offset AGN fraction shows no\nevidence for a dependence on AGN luminosity, while the dual AGN fractions show\nstronger evidence for a positive dependence, suggesting that the merger events\nforming dual AGN are more efficient at instigating accretion onto supermassive\nblack holes than those forming offset AGN. We also find that the offset and\ndual AGN fractions both have a negative dependence on nuclear separation and\nare similar in value at small physical scales. This dependence may become\nstronger when restricted to high AGN luminosities, though a larger sample is\nneeded for confirmation. These results indicate that the probability of AGN\ntriggering increases at later merger stages. This study is the first to\nsystematically probe down to nuclear separations of <1 kpc (~0.8 kpc) and is\nconsistent with predictions from simulations that AGN observability peaks in\nthis regime. We also find that the offset AGN are not preferentially obscured\ncompared to the parent AGN sample, suggesting that our selection may be\ntargeting galaxy mergers with relatively dust-free nuclear regions.\n", "  I present a family of algorithms to reduce noise in astrophysical im- ages\nand image sequences, preserving more information from the original data than is\nretained by conventional techniques. The family uses locally adaptive filters\n(\"noise gates\") in the Fourier domain, to separate coherent image structure\nfrom background noise based on the statistics of local neighborhoods in the\nimage. Processing of solar data limited by simple shot noise or by additive\nnoise reveals image structure not easily visible in the originals, preserves\nphotometry of observable features, and reduces shot noise by a factor of 10 or\nmore with little to no apparent loss of resolution, revealing faint features\nthat were either not directly discernible or not sufficiently strongly detected\nfor quantitative analysis. The method works best on image sequences containing\nrelated subjects, for example movies of solar evolution, but is also applicable\nto single images provided that there are enough pixels. The adaptive filter\nuses the statistical properties of noise and of local neighborhoods in the\ndata, to discriminate between coherent features and incoherent noise without\nreference to the specific shape or evolution of the those features. The\ntechnique can potentially be modified in a straightforward way to exploit\nadditional a priori knowledge about the functional form of the noise.\n", "  We recently reported a population of protostellar candidates in the 20 km\ns$^{-1}$ cloud in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way, traced by H$_2$O\nmasers in gravitationally bound dense cores. In this paper, we report\nhigh-angular-resolution ($\\sim$3'') molecular line studies of the environment\nof star formation in this cloud. Maps of various molecular line transitions as\nwell as the continuum at 1.3 mm are obtained using the Submillimeter Array.\nFive NH$_3$ inversion lines and the 1.3 cm continuum are observed with the Karl\nG. Jansky Very Large Array. The interferometric observations are complemented\nwith single-dish data. We find that the CH$_3$OH, SO, and HNCO lines, which are\nusually shock tracers, are better correlated spatially with the compact dust\nemission from dense cores among the detected lines. These lines also show\nenhancement in intensities with respect to SiO intensities toward the compact\ndust emission, suggesting the presence of slow shocks or hot cores in these\nregions. We find gas temperatures of $\\gtrsim$100 K at 0.1-pc scales based on\nRADEX modelling of the H$_2$CO and NH$_3$ lines. Although no strong\ncorrelations between temperatures and linewidths/H$_2$O maser luminosities are\nfound, in high-angular-resolution maps we notice several candidate shock heated\nregions offset from any dense cores, as well as signatures of localized heating\nby protostars in several dense cores. Our findings suggest that at 0.1-pc\nscales in this cloud star formation and strong turbulence may together affect\nthe chemistry and temperature of the molecular gas.\n", "  In recent laboratory studies the robustness of a bouncing barrier in\nplanetesimal formation was studied with an ensemble of preformed compact\nmm-sized aggregates. Here we show that a bouncing barrier indeed evolves\nself-consistently by hit-and-stick from an ensemble of smaller dust aggregates.\nIn addition, we feed small aggregates to an ensemble of larger bouncing\naggregates. The stickiness temporarily increases, but the final number of\naggregates still bouncing remains the same. However, feeding on the small\nparticle supply, the size of the bouncing aggregates increases. This suggests\nthat in the presence of a dust reservoir aggregates grow into but also out of a\nbouncing barrier at larger size.\n", "  The relationship between a decaying strong turbulence and the mirror\ninstability in a slowly expanding plasma is investigated using two-dimensional\nhybrid expanding box simulations. We impose an initial ambient magnetic field\nperpendicular to the simulation box, and we start with a spectrum of\nlarge-scale, linearly-polarized, random-phase Alfvenic fluctuations which have\nenergy equipartition between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations and vanishing\ncorrelation between the two fields. A turbulent cascade rapidly develops,\nmagnetic field fluctuations exhibit a Kolmogorov-like power-law spectrum at\nlarge scales and a steeper spectrum at sub-ion scales. The imposed expansion\n(taking a strictly transverse ambient magnetic field) leads to generation of an\nimportant perpendicular proton temperature anisotropy that eventually drives\nthe mirror instability. This instability generates large-amplitude,\nnonpropagating, compressible, pressure-balanced magnetic structures in a form\nof magnetic enhancements/humps that reduce the perpendicular temperature\nanisotropy.\n", "  Gas surrounding high redshift galaxies has been studied through observations\nof absorption line systems toward background quasars for decades. However, it\nhas proven difficult to identify and characterize the galaxies associated with\nthese absorbers due to the intrinsic faintness of the galaxies compared to the\nquasars at optical wavelengths. Utilizing the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array, we report on detections of [CII] 158 micron\nline and dust continuum emission from two galaxies associated with two such\nabsorbers at a redshift of z~4. Our results indicate that the hosts of these\nhigh-metallicity absorbers have physical properties similar to massive\nstar-forming galaxies and are embedded in enriched neutral hydrogen gas\nreservoirs that extend well beyond the star-forming interstellar medium of\nthese galaxies.\n", "  Fringes often appear in a CCD frame, especially when a thin CCD chip and a R\nor I filter is used. 88 CCD frames of the two open clusters NGC 2324 and NGC\n1664 with a Johnson I filter taken from the 2.4-m telescope at Yunnan\nObservatory are used to study the fringes' impacts to the astrometry and\nphotometry of stars. A novel technique proposed by Snodgrass & Carry is applied\nto remove the fringes in each CCD frame. And an appraisal of this technique is\nperformed to estimate fringes' effects on astrometry and photometry of stars.\nOur results show that the astrometric and photometric precisions of stars can\nbe improved effectively after the removal of fringes, especially for faint\nstars.\n", "  We study a complex plasma under microgravity conditions that is first\nstabilized with an oscillating electric field. Once the stabilization is\nstopped, the so-called heartbeat instability develops. We study how the kinetic\nenergy spectrum changes during and after the onset of the instability and\ncompare with the double cascade predicted by Kraichnan and Leith for\ntwo-dimensional turbulence. The onset of the instability manifests clearly in\nthe ratio of the reduced rates of cascade of energy and enstrophy and in the\npower-law exponents of the energy spectra.\n", "  Many features near the Galactic Center have been called 3-kiloparsec arms. We\nreached a point of having too many divergent data, making it difficult to be\nconstrained by a single physical model. Their differing characteristics suggest\ndifferent physical and dynamical objects.\n  Radial velocity data on the so-called 3-kpc arms do not coincide with radial\nvelocities of major spiral arms near 3kpc, nor near 2 kpc, nor near 4 kpc from\nthe Galactic Center (Fig. 1 and 2).\n  Different 3-kpc arm features may require different models: turbulence around\na shock in a Galactic density wave between 2 and 4 kpc from the Galactic Center\n(Table 1), or nuclear rotation between 0 and 2 kpc from the Galactic Center\nregion (Table 2), or a putative radial expansion between 0 and 4 kpc from the\nGalactic Center.\n  Despite their naming as Near 3-kiloparsec arms or Far 3-kiloparsec arms,\nthese features are not major arms. Those 3-kpc arm features nearer the Galactic\nCenter (within 13o of Galactic longitude) may be different than those farther\nout (Table 2).\n  Here we show that the plethora of observed '3-kpc arm' features can be\nseparated in two: those with Galactic longitude of 13 degrees or more away from\nthe Galactic Center (Table 1 - some of which are possibly associated with the\nobserved major spiral arms), and those within 13 degrees from the Galactic\nCenter (Table 2 - some of which are possibly associated with the observed\ncentral bars; Fig.1 and Fig.2).\n", "  In MR elastography it is common to use an elastic model for the tissue's\nresponse in order to properly interpret the results. More complex models such\nas viscoelastic, fractional viscoelastic, poroelastic, or poroviscoelastic ones\nare also used. These models appear at first sight to be very different, but\nhere it is shown that they all may be expressed in terms of elementary\nviscoelastic models.\n  For a medium expressed with fractional models, many elementary spring-damper\ncombinations are added, each of them weighted according to a long-tailed\ndistribution, hinting at a fractional distribution of time constants or\nrelaxation frequencies. This may open up for a more physical interpretation of\nthe fractional models.\n  The shear wave component of the poroelastic model is shown to be modeled\nexactly by a three-component Zener model. The extended poroviscoelastic model\nis found to be equivalent to what is called a non-standard four-parameter\nmodel. Accordingly, the large number of parameters in the porous models can be\nreduced to the same number as in their viscoelastic equivalents. As long as the\nindividual displacements from the solid and fluid parts cannot be measured\nindividually the main use of the poro(visco)elastic models is therefore as a\nphysics based method for determining parameters in a viscoelastic model.\n", "  The discovery of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar M82 X-2 has stimulated lively\ndiscussion on the nature of the accreting neutron star. In most of the previous\nstudies the magnetic field of the neutron star was derived from the observed\nspin-up/down rates based on the standard thin, magnetized accretion disk model.\nHowever, under super-Eddington accretion the inner part of the accretion disk\nbecomes geometrically thick. In this work we consider both radiation feedback\nfrom the neutron star and the sub-Keplerian rotation in a thick disk, and\ncalculate the magnetic moment - mass accretion rate relations for the measured\nrates of spin change. We find that the derived neutron star's dipole magnetic\nfield depends the maximum accretion rate adopted, but is likely $\\lesssim\n10^{13}$ G. The predicted accretion rate change can be used to test the\nproposed models by comparison with observations.\n", "  Measurements of the lithium isotopic ratio in the diffuse interstellar medium\nfrom high-resolution spectra of the LiI {\\lambda}6708 resonance doublet have\nnow been reported for a number of lines of sight. The majority of the results\nfor the 7Li/6Li ratio are similar to the Solar System ratio of 12.2 but the\nline of sight toward o Per, a star near the star-forming region IC 348, gave a\nratio of about 2, the expected value for gas exposed to spallation and fusion\nreactions driven by cosmic rays. To examine the association of IC 348 with\ncosmic rays more closely, we measured the lithium isotopic ratio for lines of\nsight to three stars within a few parsecs of o Per. One star, HD 281159, has\n7Li/6Li ~ 2 confirming production by cosmic rays. The lithium isotopic ratio\ntoward o Per and HD 281159 together with published analyses of the chemistry of\ninterstellar diatomic molecules suggest that the superbubble surrounding IC 348\nis the source of the cosmic rays.\n", "  We review the use of graphene to develop reconfigurable, miniaturized, and\nefficient terahertz (THz) antennas and associated feeding networks, and attempt\nto identify current research trends and mid- and long-term challenges and\nprospects. We first discuss the state of the art in resonant, leaky-wave and\nreflectarray antennas, providing a critical assessment of their performance,\nlimitations, and main challenges that remain to be addressed. Next, we examine\ndifferent integrated feeding networks, including components such as switches,\nfilters, and phase shifters, and we clarify the impact that graphene's\nintrinsic spatial dispersion may have in their performance. Our outlook clearly\ndescribes how graphene can bring exotic functionalities to all these devices,\nincluding quasi real-time reconfiguration capabilities and magnet-less\nnon-reciprocal responses. Some exciting applications of THz antennas are then\npresented and discussed, including transceivers, biosensors, and first\nexperimental realizations of detectors and modulators. We conclude by outlining\nour vision for the promising future of graphene-based THz antennas.\n", "  We report on a timing and spectral analysis of the young, high magnetic field\nrotation-powered pulsar (RPP) B1509-58 using Chandra continuous-clocking mode\nobservation. The pulsar's X-ray light curve can be fit by the two Gaussian\ncomponents and the pulsed fraction shows moderate energy dependence over the\nChandra band. The pulsed X-ray spectrum is well described by a power law with a\nphoton index 1.16(4), which is harder than the values measured with RXTE PCA\nand NuSTAR. This result supports the log-parabolic model for the broadband\nX-ray spectrum. With the unprecedented angular resolution of Chandra, we\nclearly identified off-pulse X-ray emission from the pulsar, and its spectrum\nis best fit by a power law plus blackbody model. The latter component has a\ntemperature of ~0.14 keV with a bolometric luminosity comparable to the\nluminosities of other young and high magnetic field RPPs, and it lies between\nthe temperature of magnetars and typical RPPs. In addition, we found that the\nnonthermal X-ray emission of PSR B1509-58 is significantly softer in the\noff-pulse phase than in the pulsed phase, with the photon index varying between\n1.0 and 1.8 and anticorrelated with the flux. This is similar to the behavior\nof three other young pulsars. We interpreted it as different contributions of\npair-creation processes at different altitudes from the neutron star surface\naccording to the outer-gap model.\n", "  Photoproduction of $\\eta$ mesons from neutrons} \\abstract{Results from\nmeasurements of the photoproduction of $\\eta$ mesons from quasifree protons and\nneutrons are summarized. The experiments were performed with the CBELSA/TAPS\ndetector at the electron accelerator ELSA in Bonn using the\n$\\eta\\to3\\pi^{0}\\to6\\gamma$ decay. A liquid deuterium target was used for the\nmeasurement of total cross sections and angular distributions. The results\nconfirm earlier measurements from Bonn and the MAMI facility in Mainz about the\nexistence of a narrow structure in the excitation function of $\\gamma\nn\\rightarrow n\\eta$. The current angular distributions show a forward-backward\nasymmetry, which was previously not seen, but was predicted by model\ncalculations including an additional narrow $P_{11}$ state. Furthermore, data\nobtained with a longitudinally polarized, deuterated butanol target and a\ncircularly polarized photon beam were analyzed to determine the double\npolarization observable $E$. Both data sets together were also used to extract\nthe helicity dependent cross sections $\\sigma_{1/2}$ and $\\sigma_{3/2}$. The\nnarrow structure in the excitation function of $\\gamma n\\rightarrow n\\eta$\nappears associated with the helicity-1/2 component of the reaction.\n", "  We calculate an electron-phonon scattering and intrinsic transport properties\nof black phosphorus monolayer using tight-binding and Boltzmann treatments as a\nfunction of temperature, carrier density, and electric field. The low-field\nmobility shows weak dependence on density and, at room temperature, falls in\nthe range of 300 - 1000 cm^2/Vs in the armchair direction and 50 - 120 cm^2/Vs\nin the zig-zag direction with the anisotropy due to an effective mass\ndifference. At high fields, drift velocity is linear with electric field up to\n1 - 2 V/micron reaching values of 10^7 cm/s in the armchair direction, unless\nself-heating effects are included.\n", "  We take into account dynamical spin effects in the holographic light-front\npion wavefunction in order to predict the pion radius, decay constant, the pion\nelectromagnetic and photon-to-pion transition form factors. We report a\nstriking improvement in the description of all data.\n", "  During its first 4 months of taking data, Advanced LIGO has detected\ngravitational waves from two binary black hole mergers, GW150914 and GW151226,\nalong with the statistically less significant binary black hole merger\ncandidate LVT151012. We use our rapid binary population synthesis code COMPAS\nto show that all three events can be explained by a single evolutionary channel\n-- classical isolated binary evolution via mass transfer including a common\nenvelope phase. We show all three events could have formed in low-metallicity\nenvironments (Z = 0.001) from progenitor binaries with typical total masses\n$\\gtrsim 160 M_\\odot$, $\\gtrsim 60 M_\\odot$ and $\\gtrsim 90 M_\\odot$, for\nGW150914, GW151226, and LVT151012, respectively.\n", "  Magnetic oxyselenides have been the topic of research for several decades\nbeing first of interest in the context of photoconductivity and\nthermoelectricity owing to their intrinsic semiconducting properties and\nability to tune the energy gap through metal ion substitution. More recently,\ninterest in the oxyselenides has experienced a resurgence owing to the possible\nrelation to strongly correlated phenomena given the fact that many oxyslenides\nshare a similar structure to unconventional superconducting pnictides and\nchalcogenides. The two dimensional nature of many oxyselenide systems also\ndraws an analogy to cuprate physics where a strong interplay between\nunconventional electronic phases and localised magnetism has been studied for\nseveral decades. It is therefore timely to review the physics of the\noxyselenides in the context of the broader field of strongly correlated\nmagnetism and electronic phenomena. Here we review the current status and\nprogress in this area of research with the focus on the influence of\nlanthanides and transition metal ions on the intertwined magnetic and\nelectronic properties of oxyselenides. The emphasis of the review is on the\nmagnetic properties and comparisons are made with iron based pnictide and\nchalcogenide systems.\n", "  Over the last decades, there have been many proposals for quantum\ncomputation. One of the promising candidates is adiabatic quantum computation\n(AQC). The central idea of AQC is about finding the ground state of a system\nwith a problem Hamiltonian via particular adiabatic passages, starting from an\ninitialized ground state of a simple Hamiltonian. One disadvantage of AQC is\nthe significant growth of necessary runtime, in particular when there are\nquantum phase transitions during the AQC passages. Here we propose a\nnondeterministic ground state cooling quantum computation model based on\nselective projection measurements on an ancilla coupled to the system with the\nproblem Hamiltonian previously cooled by conventional techniques. We illustrate\nthe model by Grover search problem and show that our nondeterministic model\nrequires a constant or at most logarithmic runtime and can also get rid of\npossible difficulties in preparing the ground state of the simple Hamiltonian.\n", "  Energetic particle populations in nuclear fusion experiments can destabilize\nAlfv\\' en Eigenmodes through inverse Landau damping and couplings with gap\nmodes in the shear Alfv\\' en continua. We use the reduced MHD equations to\ndescribe the linear evolution of the poloidal flux and the toroidal component\nof the vorticity in a full 3D system, coupled with equations of density and\nparallel velocity moments for the energetic particles. We add the Landau\ndamping and resonant destabilization effects by a closure relation. We apply\nthe model to study the Alfv\\' en modes stability in Large Helical Device (LHD)\ninward-shifted configurations, performing a parametric analysis in a range of\nrealistic values of energetic particle $\\beta$ ($\\beta_{f}$), ratios of the\nenergetic particle thermal/Alfv\\' en velocities ($V_{th}/V_{A0}$), magnetic\nLundquist numbers ($S$) and toroidal modes ($n$). The $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ TAE\nare destabilized although $n = 3$ and $n = 4$ TAE are weakly perturbed. The\nmost unstable configurations are associated with density gradients of energetic\nparticles in the plasma core: TAE are destabilized even for small energetic\nparticle populations if their thermal velocity is lower than $0.4$ times the\nAlfv\\' en velocity. The frequency range of MHD bursts measured in LHD are\n$50-70$ kHz for $n=1$ and $60-80$ kHz for $n=2$ TAE, consistent with the model\npredictions.\n", "  Polarized emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) potentially\nprovides a new way to test basic physics of the alignment of ultrasmall grains.\nIn this paper, we present a new model of polarized PAH emission that takes into\naccount the effect of PAH alignment with the magnetic field. We first generate\na large sample of the grain angular momentum $\\bf J$ by simulating the\nalignment of PAHs due to resonance paramagnetic relaxation that accounts for\nvarious interaction processes. We then calculate the polarization level of PAH\nemission features, for the different phases of the ISM, including the cold\nneutral medium (CNM), reflection nebulae (RN), and photodissociation regions\n(PDRs). We find that a moderate degree of PAH alignment can significantly\nenhance the polarization degree of PAH emission compared to the previous\nresults obtained with randomly oriented $\\bf J$. In particular, we find that\nsmallest, negatively charged PAHs in RN can be excited to slightly suprathermal\nrotation due to enhanced ion collisional excitation, resulting in an increase\nof the polarization with the ionization fraction. Our results suggest that RN\nis the most favorable environment to observe polarized PAH emission and to test\nalignment physics of nanoparticles. Finally, we present an explicit\nrelationship between the polarization level of PAH emission and the degree of\nexternal alignment for the CNM and RN. The obtained relationship will be\nparticularly useful for testing alignment physics of PAHs by future\nobservations.\n", "  We numerically compute axisymmetric Taylor-Couette flow in the presence of\naxially periodic magnetic fields, with Hartmann numbers up to $Ha^2=10^7$. The\ngeometry of the field singles out special field lines on which Shercliff layers\nform. These are simple shear layers for insulating boundaries, versus\nsuper-rotating or counter-rotating layers for conducting boundaries. Some field\nconfigurations have previously studied spherical analogs, but fundamentally new\nconfigurations also exist, having no spherical analogs. Finally, we explore the\ninfluence of azimuthal fields $B_\\phi\\sim r^{-1}{\\bf\\hat e}_\\phi$ on these\nlayers, and show that the flow is suppressed for conducting boundaries but\nenhanced for insulating boundaries.\n", "  Electric field-induced magnetization switching in multiferroics holds\nprofound promise for ultra-low-energy computing in beyond Moore's law era.\nBistable nanomagnets in the multiferroics are usually deemed to be suitable for\nstoring a binary bit of information and switching between the two stable states\nallows us to process digital information. However, it requires to process\ncontinuous analog signals too for seamless integration of nanomagnetic devices\nin our future information processing systems. Here, we show that it is possible\nto harness the analog nature in the magnetostrictive nanomagnets, contrary to\nwriting a digital bit of information. By solving stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of magnetization dynamics at room-temperature,\nwe demonstrate such possibility and show that there exists a transistor-like\nhigh-gain region in the input-output characteristics of the magnetostrictive\nnanomagnets in strain-mediated multiferroic composites. This can be the basis\nof ultra-low-energy analog and mixed signal precessing in our future\ninformation processing systems and it eliminates the requirement of using\ncharge-based transistors.\n", "  This work concerns a study of the quantum mechanical extension of the work of\nHorwitz et al. [1] on the stability of classical Hamiltonian systems by\ngeometrical methods. Simulations are carried out for several important\nexamples, these show that the quantum mechanical extension of the classical\nmethod, for which trajectories are plotted as expectation values of the\ncorresponding quantum operators, appears to work well, providing results\nconsistent with the corresponding classical problems. The results appear to\nprovide a new contribution to the subject of quantum chaos.\n", "  In this thesis we study some theoretical and phenomenological aspects of\nclassical conformal symmetry in specific extensions of the SM. We consider both\nsupersymmetric and non supersymmetric cases. We discuss the perturbative\nstructure of the superconformal anomaly effective action. We show that the\nmanifestation of the anomaly is in the presence of massless intermediate states\nin correlators involving the Ferrara-Zumino supercurrent with two vector\nsupercurrents. This universal feature is typical both of chiral and conformal\nanomalies. These results are used in a study of a possible extension of the SM\nwith a dilaton, deriving some bounds on a possible conformal scale. Then we\nturn to investigate a specific superconformal theory, the TNMSSM, which extends\nthe MSSM with one extra triplet and a scalar singlet superfield. The\nmanifestation of the classical conformal symmetry in this model is in the\nexistence of a very light pseudoscalar in the physical spectrum. We study the\nmain proprieties of this state and its potential discovery at the LHC. In the\nlast part of this work we discuss an application of the graviton-photon-photon\nvertex to gravitational lensing for a Schwarzschild background. In particular,\nwe introduce the notion of a semiclassical lens equation for the deflection of\na photon nearing the horizon of a black hole.\n", "  The biophysical analysis of dynamically formed multi-protein complexes in\nsolution presents a formidable technical challenge. Sedimentation velocity (SV)\nanalytical ultracentrifugation achieves strongly size-dependent hydrodynamic\nresolution of different size species, and can be combined with multi-component\ndetection by exploiting different spectral properties or temporally modulated\nsignals from photoswitchable proteins. Coexisting complexes arising from self-\nor hetero-associations that can be distinguished in SV allow measurement of\ntheir stoichiometry, affinity, and cooperativity. However, assemblies that are\nshort-lived on the time-scale of sedimentation (t1/2 < 100 sec) will exhibit an\nas of yet unexplored pattern of sedimentation boundaries governed by coupled\nco-migration of the entire system. Here, we present a theory for\nmulti-component sedimentation of rapidly interacting systems, which reveals\nsimple underlying physical principles, offers a quantitative framework for\nanalysis, thereby extending the dynamic range of SV for studying\nmulti-component interactions\n", "  The correctness of the consistent histories analysis of weakly interacting\nprobes, related to the path of a particle, is maintained against the criticisms\nin the Comment, and against the alternative approach described there, which\nreceives no support from standard (textbook) quantum mechanics.\n", "  This essay discusses the relationship between science and religion,\nspecifically the controversy elicited by an article by the philosopher Thomas\nNagel, criticizing the scientific establishment for ruling out intelligent\ndesign as beyond discussion. He also criticizes the judge's decision in\nKitzmiller vs. Dover, ruling out discussion of intelligent design in science\nclassrooms in public schools. A defense of the thesis of Stephen J. Gould that\nscience and religion represent nonoverlapping magesteria (NOMA) is presented.\n", "  We use a magnetothermal resistance method to measure the lattice thermal\nconductivity of a single crystal of Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from 5 to 60 K. We apply a\nlarge transverse magnetic field to suppress the electronic thermal conduction\nwhile measuring thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity. The lattice\nthermal conductivity is then calculated by extrapolating the thermal\nconductivity versus electrical conductivity curve to a zero electrical\nconductivity value. Our results show that the measured phonon thermal\nconductivity follows the $e^{({\\Delta}_{min}/T)}$ temperature dependence and\nthe Lorenz ratio corresponds to the modified Sommerfeld value in the\nintermediate temperature range. Our low-temperature experimental data and\nanalysis on Bi$_2$Te$_3$ are an important compliment to previous measurements\nof Goldsmid [14] and theoretical calculations by Broido $\\textit{et al.}$ [21]\nat higher temperature 100 - 300 K.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a 2-dimensional copper-bismuth nano sheet from\n\\textit{ab initio} calculations, which we call cubine. According to our\npredictions, single layers of cubine can be isolated from the recently reported\nhigh-pressure CuBi bulk material (metastable at ambient conditions) at an\nenergetic cost of merely $\\approx 20$~meV/\\AA$^2$, comparable to separating\nsingle layers of graphene from graphite. Our calculations suggest that cubine\nhas remarkable electronic and electrochemical properties: It is a\nsuperconductor with a moderate electron-phonon coupling $\\lambda=0.5$, leading\nto a $T_c$ of $\\approx1$~K, and can be readily intercalated with lithium with a\nhigh diffusibility, rendering it a promising candidate material as an anode in\nlithium-ion batteries.\n", "  For sputter depth profiling often sample erosion by Ar+ ions is used. Only a\nhigh purity of the sputter gas and a low contamination level of the ion gun\navoids misleading depth profile measurements results. Here a new measurement\nprocedure is presented, which monitors these parameters. A Si sample is\nsputtered inside the instrument and then the surface concentration of the\nelements Ar, C, N and O is measured. Results of such measurements of an XPS\nmicroprobe PHI Quantum 2000, which were recorded over a period of 10 years, are\npresented.\n", "  In this paper we study the stationary horizons of the rotating black ring and\nthe supersymmetric black ring spacetimes in five dimensions. In the case of the\nrotating black ring we use Weyl aligned null directions to algebraically\nclassify the Weyl tensor, and utilize an adapted Cartan algorithm in order to\nproduce Cartan invariants. For the supersymmetric black ring we employ the\ndiscriminant approach and repeat the adapted Cartan algorithm. For both of\nthese metrics we are able to construct Cartan invariants that detect the\nhorizon alone, and which are easier to compute and analyse that scalar\npolynomial curvature invariants.\n", "  In this paper we introduce an algorithm to determine the equivalence of five\ndimensional spacetimes, which generalizes the Karlhede algorithm for four\ndimensional general relativity. As an alternative to the Petrov type\nclassification, we employ the alignment classification to algebraically\nclassify the Weyl tensor. To illustrate the algorithm we discuss three\nexamples: the singly rotating Myers-Perry solution, the Kerr (anti) de Sitter\nsolution, and the rotating black ring solution. We briefly discuss some\napplications of the Cartan algorithm in five dimensions.\n", "  Symplectic mappings are discrete-time analogs of Hamiltonian systems. They\nappear in many areas of physics, including, for example, accelerators, plasma,\nand fluids. Integrable mappings, a subclass of symplectic mappings, are\nequivalent to a Twist map, with a rotation number, constant along the phase\ntrajectory. In this letter, we propose a succinct expression to determine the\nrotation number and present two examples. Similar to the period of the bounded\nmotion in Hamiltonian systems, the rotation number is the most fundamental\nproperty of integrable maps and it provides a way to analyze the phase-space\ndynamics.\n", "  Synthetic driving force molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to\nsurvey grain boundary mobility in three classes of incoherent {\\Sigma}3 twin\nboundaries: <112>, <110>, and <111> tilt boundaries. These boundaries are\nfaceted on low energy planes, and step flow boundary motion occurs by glide of\nthe triplets of partial dislocations that comprise the mobile facets.\nSystematic trends with inclination angle are identified and characterized.\nObservations of thermally activated, anti-thermal, and athermal motion are\nexplained in terms of the orientation of the Shockley partial dislocations\nalong close-packed and non-close-packed directions. Thermally activated\nboundaries follow a compensation effect associated with a facet roughening\ntransition. As for all faceting boundaries, system size and driving force must\nbe chosen with care to prevent simulation artifacts.\n", "  In this paper, we explore realist models of quantum theory that does not fit\ninto the standard definitions of ontological models. The models here go beyond\nstandard definition of ontological models in the sense that quantum states do\nnot correspond to distributions over the ontic state space and a system\nprepared in a quantum state is not in an ontic state. Instead, a system in a\nquantum state is always in a process, i.e. moving around in the ontic state\nspace. Also, quantum measurement outcomes are not direct measurement of the\nontic state, but depend probabilistically on the entire path the system takes\nduring the measurement process. Consequently, we explain how, in our model,\nquantum states can neither be classified as ontic nor epistemic in the sense of\nknowledge about an underlying reality. In our model, quantum probabilities\ndescribes our (objective) knowledge about measurement outcomes. We also look at\ntwo hybrid models where either the preparation or measurement do follow the\ndefinitions in standard ontological models. Lastly, we propose a form of\ngeneralised ontological model that reduces to the standard PBR model when the\nunderlying process reduces to a point in ontic space.\n", "  Recently, a generalization of the standard optical multiport was proposed\n[Phys. Rev. A 93, 043845 (2016)]. These directionally unbiased multiports allow\nphotons to reverse direction and exit backwards from the input port, providing\na realistic linear optical scattering vertex for quantum walks on arbitrary\ngraph structures. Here, it is shown that arrays of these multiports allow the\nsimulation of a range of discrete-time Hamiltonian systems. Examples are\ndescribed, including a case where both spatial and internal degrees of freedom\nare simulated. Because input ports also double as output ports, there is\nsubstantial savings of resources compared to feed-forward networks carrying out\nthe same functions. The simulation is implemented in a scalable manner using\nonly linear optics, and can be generalized to higher dimensional systems in a\nstraightforward fashion, thus offering a concrete experimentally achievable\nimplementation of graphical models of discrete-time quantum systems.\n", "  Deformations of a Courant Algebroid E and its Dirac subbundle A have been\nwidely considered under the assumption that the pseudo-Euclidean metric is\nfixed. In this paper, we attack the same problem in a setting that allows the\npseudo-Euclidean metric to deform. Thanks to Roytenberg, a Courant algebroid is\nequivalent to a symplectic graded Q-manifold of degree 2. From this viewpoint,\nwe extend the notions of graded Q-manifold, DGLA and L_\\infty-algebra all to\n\"blended\" version so that Poisson manifold, Lie algebroid and Courant algebroid\nare unified as blended Q-manifolds; and define a submaniold A of \"coisotropic\ntype\" which naturally generalizes the concepts of coisotropic submanifolds, Lie\nsubalgebroids and Dirac subbundles. It turns out the deformations a blended\nhomological vector field Q is controlled by a blended DGLA, and the\ndeformations of A is controlled by a blended L_\\infty-algebra. The results\napply to the deformations of a Courant algebroid and its Dirac structures, the\ndeformations of a Poisson manifold and its coisotropic submanifold, the\ndeformations of a Lie algebroid and its Lie subalgebroid.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo is an efficient technique for finding the ground-state\nenergy and related properties of small molecules. A major challenge remains in\naccurate determination of a molecule's geometry, i.e. the optimal location of\nits individual nuclei and the frequencies of their vibration. The aim of this\narticle is to describe a simple technique to accurately establish such\nproperties. This is achieved by varying the trial function to accommodate\nchanging geometry, thereby removing a source of rather unpleasant singularities\nwhich arise when the trial function is fixed (the traditional approach).\n", "  Series of deformed Camassa-Holm-type equations are constructed using the\nLagrangian deformation and Loop algebra splittings. They are weakly integrable\nin the sense of modified Lax pairs.\n", "  We investigate the nature of the chiral phase transition in the massless\ntwo-flavor QCD using the renormalization group improved gauge action and the\nWilson quark action on $32^3\\times 16$, $24^3\\times 12$, and $16^3\\times 8$\nlattices. Based on the renormalization group equation, we derive the scaling\nrelation for the effective masses of mesons at the chiral phase transition\npoint. If the chiral phase transition is second order, the effective masses as\na function of the rescaled time/space do not depend on the lattice size and\nshow the universal behavior. We find that our numerical simulations on the\nthree sizes of lattices are excellently on the scaling curves, which is\nconsistent with the second order phase transition.\n", "  The Kepler mission has revealed that Earth-sized planets are common, and\ndozens have been discovered to orbit in or near their host star's habitable\nzone. A major focus in astronomy is to determine which of these exoplanets are\nlikely to have Earth-like properties that are amenable to follow-up with both\nground- and future space-based surveys, with an ultimate goal of probing their\natmospheres to look for signs of life. Venus-like atmospheres will be of\nparticular interest in these surveys. While Earth and Venus evolved to have\nsimilar sizes and densities, it remains unclear what factors led to the\ndramatic divergence of their atmospheres. Studying analogs to both Earth and\nVenus can thus shed light on the limits of habitability and the potential for\nlife on known exoplanets. Here we present the discovery and confirmation of\nKepler-1649b, an Earth-sized planet orbiting a nearby M5V star that receives\nincident flux at a level similar to that of Venus. We present our methods for\ncharacterizing the star, using a combination of PSF photometry, ground-based\nspectroscopy and imaging, to confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-1649b.\nPlanets like Kepler-1649b will be prime candidates for atmospheric and\nhabitability studies in the next generation of space missions.\n", "  In the present thesis, we have carried a thorough investigation of nuclear\nstructure properties. We start our investigation from the study of the magic\nproperty of nucleus in the super -heavy region. We know the magic combination\nof proton and neutron in the light and medium heavy region. But in the\nsuper-heavy region, it is still unclear. We applied SEI (simple effective\ninteraction ) and RMF (relativistic mean field ) formalism with a different\nparameter sets to predict the magic combinations and it turned out Z=114, 120,\n126 with N=184. We have also studied theisoscalar giant monopole resonance\nenergy of nucleus of Z=114, 120,126, with scaling and constrained method using\nRETF formalism. Isoscalar giant monopole resonance (ISGMR) is also known as the\nbreathing mode. We have a developed a new constrained type calculation for the\nISGMR and IVGDR. Effects of delta meson on the neutron system also discuses\nextensively.\n", "  The Dresden sodium facility for dynamo and thermohydraulic studies (DRESDYN)\nis a platform for large-scale liquid sodium experiments devoted to fundamental\ngeo- and astrophysical questions as well as to various applied problems related\nto the conversion and storage of energy. Its most ambitious part is a\nprecession driven dynamo experiment comprising 8 tons of liquid sodium supposed\nto rotate with up to 10 Hz and to precess with up to 1 Hz. Another large-scale\nset-up is a Tayler-Couette experiment with a gap width of 0.2 m and a height of\n2 m, whose inner cylinder rotates with up to 20 Hz. Equipped with a coil system\nfor the generation of an axial field of up to 120 mT and two different axial\ncurrents through the center and the liquid sodium, this experiment aims at\nstudying various versions of the magnetorotational instability and their\ncombinations with the Tayler instability. We discuss the physical background of\nthese two experiments and delineate the present status of their technical\nrealization. Other installations, such as a sodium loop and a test stand for\nIn-Service-Inspection experiments will also be sketched.\n", "  We study steady-state oscillations of an elastic Hele-Shaw cell excited by\ntraveling pressure waves over its upper surface. The fluid within the cell is\nbounded by two asymmetric elastic sheets which are connected to a rigid surface\nvia distributed springs and modeled by the linearized plate theory. Modal\nanalysis yields the frequency response of the configuration as a function of\nthree parameters: the fluidic Womersley number and two ratios of elastic stress\nto viscous pressure for each of the sheets. These ratios, analogous to the\nCapillary number, combine the effects of fluid viscosity and the sheets\ninertia, bending and tension. The resonance frequencies of the configuration\ninclude the resonance frequency of the upper sheet, and the resonance frequency\nof both sheets with a constraint of constant gap. Near the resonance frequency\nof the upper sheet, the fluid pressure is identical in amplitude and phase to\nthe external excitation. For configurations where both sheets are near\nresonance, small changes in frequency yield significant modification of the\nfluidic pressure. In addition, a new resonance frequency is observed, related\nto the interaction between motion of fluid parallel to the elastic sheets and\nrelative elastic displacements of the sheets. The ratio of the amplitude of the\nfluidic pressure to the external pressure is presented vs. frequency for\nseveral characteristic solid and fluid properties, yielding a bandpass filter\nbehaviour. For configurations with a rigid lower surface the pressure ratio is\nunity at the passband, while for two elastic sheets pressure amplification or\nreduction occurs near the resonance frequencies. The results presented here may\nallow to utilize elastic Hele-Shaw configurations as protective surfaces and\nmechanical filters.\n", "  We study the formation energies of native point defects in GaN through\ndensity-functional theory. In our first-principles scheme, the band edges are\npositioned in accord with hybrid density functional calculations, thus yielding\na band-gap in agreement with experiment. With respect to previous semilocal\ncalculations, the calculated formation energies and charge transition levels\nare found to be significantly different in quantitative terms, while the\noverall qualitative trend remains similar. In Ga-rich conditions, the nitrogen\nvacancy corresponds to the most stable defect for all Fermi energies in the\nband gap, but its formation energy is too high to account for autodoping. Our\ncalculations also indicate that the gallium vacancy does not play any\ncompensating role in n-type GaN.\n", "  We present a sample of $X$-ray selected candidate black holes in 51 low mass\ngalaxies with $z\\le 0.055$ {and mass up to $10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$} obtained by\ncross-correlating the NASA-SLOAN Atlas with the 3XMM catalogue. {We have also\nsearched in the available catalogues for radio counterparts of the black hole\ncandidates and find that 19 of the previously selected sources have also a\nradio counterpart.} Our results show that about $37\\%$ of the galaxies of our\nsample host { an $X$-ray source} (associated to a radio counterpart) spatially\ncoincident with the galaxy center, in agreement with { other recent works}. For\nthese {\\it nuclear} sources, the $X$-ray/radio fundamental plane relation\nallows one to estimate the mass of the (central) candidate black holes which\nresults to be in the range $10^{4}-2\\times10^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ (with median\nvalue of $\\simeq 3\\times 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ and eight candidates having mass\nbelow $10^{7}$ M$_{\\odot}$). This result, while suggesting that $X$-ray\nemitting black holes in low-mass galaxies may have had a key role in the\nevolution of such systems, makes even more urgent to explain how such massive\nobjects formed in galaxies. {Of course, dedicated follow-up observations both\nin the $X$-ray and radio bands, as well as in the optical, are necessary in\norder to confirm our results\n", "  Three properties of the dielectric relaxation in ultra-pure single\ncrystalline H$_{2}$O ice Ih were probed at temperatures between 80-250 K; the\nthermally stimulated depolarization current, static electrical conductivity,\nand dielectric relaxation time. The measurements were made with a guarded\nparallel-plate capacitor constructed of fused quartz with Au electrodes. The\ndata agree with relaxation-based models and provide for the determination of\nactivation energies, which suggest that relaxation in ice is dominated by\nBjerrum defects below 140 K. Furthermore, anisotropy in the dielectric\nrelaxation data reveals that molecular reorientations along the\ncrystallographic $c$-axis are energetically favored over those along the\n$a$-axis between 80-140 K. These results lend support for the postulate of a\nshared origin between the dielectric relaxation dynamics and the thermodynamic\npartial proton-ordering in ice near 100 K, and suggest a preference for\nordering along the $c$-axis.\n", "  In this short communication, we draw the readers' attention to the\ninconsistency in the derivation of the Thomson scattering spectrum in\ninhomogeneous plasma, which leads to violation of the Fluctuation-Dissipation\nTheorem and a substantial deviation from the results of the rigorous kinetic\ntheory. Moreover, the self-consistent kinetic theory predicts the asymmetry of\nthe spectral lines in inhomogeneous plasma.\n", "  We propose an efficient way to calculate the electronic structure of large\nsystems by combining a large-scale first-principles density functional theory\ncode, Conquest, and an efficient interior eigenproblem solver, the\nSakurai-Sugiura method. The electronic Hamiltonian and charge density of large\nsystems are obtained by \\conquest and the eigenstates of the Hamiltonians are\nthen obtained by the Sakurai-Sugiura method. Applications to a hydrated DNA\nsystem, and adsorbed P2 molecules and Ge hut clusters on large Si substrates\ndemonstrate the applicability of this combination on systems with 10,000+ atoms\nwith high accuracy and efficiency.\n", "  We argue that, in many situations, fits to elastic scattering data that were\nhistorically, and frequently still are, considered `good', are not justifiably\nso describable. Information about the dynamics of nucleon-nucleus and\nnucleus-nucleus scattering is lost when elastic scattering phenomenology is\ninsufficiently ambitious. It is argued that in many situations, an alternative\napproach is appropriate for the phenomenology of nuclear elastic scattering of\nnucleons and other light nuclei. The approach affords an appropriate means of\nevaluating folding models, one that fully exploits available empirical data. It\nis particularly applicable for nucleons and other light ions.\n", "  We introduce a new action $S_{standard}^{(\\rho,h; \\Phi,g,B,C)}$ for D-branes\nthat is to D-branes as the Polyakov action is to fundamental strings. This\n`standard action' is abstractly a non-Abelian gauged sigma model --- based on\nmaps $\\varphi: (X^{\\!A\\!z},E;\\nabla)\\rightarrow Y$ from an Azumaya/matrix\nmanifold $X^{\\!A\\!z}$ with a fundamental module $E$ with a connection $\\nabla$\nto $Y$ --- enhanced by the dilaton term, the gauge-theory term, and the\nChern-Simons/Wess-Zumino term that couples $(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ to Ramond-Ramond\nfield. In a special situation, this new theory merges the theory of harmonic\nmaps and a gauge theory, with a nilpotent type fuzzy extension. With the\nanalysis developed in D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529 [hep-th]) for such maps and an\nimproved understanding of the hierarchy of various admissible conditions on the\npairs $(\\varphi,\\nabla)$ beyond D(13.2.1) (arXiv:1611.09439 [hep-th]) and how\nthey resolve the built-in obstruction to pull-push of covariant tensors under a\nmap from a noncommutative manifold to a commutative manifold, we develop\nfurther in this note some covariant differential calculus needed and apply them\nto work out the first variation --- and hence the corresponding equations of\nmotion for D-branes --- of the standard action and the second variation of the\nkinetic term for maps and the dilaton term in this action. Compared with the\nnon-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action constructed in D(13.1) along the same\nline, the current note brings the Nambu-Goto-string-to-Polyakov-string analogue\nto D-branes. The current bosonic setting is the first step toward the dynamics\nof fermionic D-branes (cf. D(11.2): arXiv:1412.0771 [hep-th]) and their\nquantization as fundamental dynamical objects, in parallel to what happened to\nthe theory of fundamental strings during years 1976--1981.\n", "  S5 0716+714 is a well known BL Lac object, one of the brightest and most\nactive blazars. The discovery in the Very High Energy band (VHE, E > 100 GeV)\nby MAGIC happened in 2008. In January 2015 the source went through the\nbrightest optical state ever observed, triggering MAGIC follow-up and a VHE\ndetection with 13{\\sigma} significance (ATel 6999). Rich multiwavelength\ncoverage of the flare allowed us to construct the broad-band spectral energy\ndistribution of S5 0716+714 during its brightest outburst. In this work we will\npresent the preliminary analysis of MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data of the flaring\nactivity in January and February 2015 for the HE (0.1 < HE < 300 GeV) and VHE\nband, together with radio (Mets\\\"ahovi, OVRO, VLBA, Effelsberg), sub-millimeter\n(SMA), optical (Tuorla, Perkins, Steward, AZT-8+ST7, LX-200, Kanata), X-ray and\nUV (Swift-XRT and UVOT), in the same time-window and discuss the time\nvariability of the multiwavelength light curves during this impressive\noutburst.\n", "  In the present paper, we investigate the polarization properties of the\ncholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) with an isotropic/anisotropic defect inside\nthem. Possibilities of amplification of the polarization plane rotation and\nstabilization of the light polarization azimuth by these systems are\ninvestigated in details.\n", "  We present a study of the dynamics of small solute particles in a solvent\nmedium where the solute is much smaller in size, mimicking the diffusion of\nsmall particles in crowded environment. The solute exhibits Fickian diffusion\narising from non-Gaussian Van Hove correlation function. Our study shows that\nthere are at least two possible origins of this non-Gaussian behaviour: the\ndecoupling of the solute-solvent dynamics and the intermittency in the solute\nmotion, the latter playing a dominant role. In the former scenario when\naveraged over time long enough to explore different solvent environments, the\ndynamics recovers the Gaussian nature. In the case of intermittent dynamics the\nnon-Gaussianity remains even after long averaging and the Gaussian behaviour is\nobtained at a much longer time. Our study further shows that only for an\nintermediate attractive solute-solvent interaction the dynamics of the solute\nis intermittent. The intermittency disappears for weaker or stronger\nattractions.\n", "  We introduce a self-consistent multi-species kinetic theory based on the\nstructure of the narrow voltage-gated potassium channel. Transition rates\ndepend on a complete energy spectrum with contributions including the\ndehydration amongst species, interaction with the dipolar charge of the filter\nand, bulk solution properties. It displays high selectivity between species\ncoexisting with fast conductivity, and Coulomb blockade phenomena, and it fits\nwell to data.\n", "  When monitoring geophysical parameters, data from segments that are\ncontaminated by noise may have to be abandoned. This is the case, for example,\nin the geoelectrical field measurements at some sites in Japan, where high\nnoise -due mainly to leakage currents from DC driven trains- prevails almost\nduring 70\\% of the 24 hour operational time. We show that even in such a case,\nthe identification of seismic electric signals (SES), which are long-range\ncorrelated signals, may be possible, if the remaining noise free data are\nanalyzed in natural time along with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA).\n", "  Supersonic beams of hydrogen atoms, prepared selectively in Rydberg-Stark\nstates of principal quantum number $n$ in the range between 25 and 35, have\nbeen deflected by 90$^\\circ$, decelerated and loaded into off-axis electric\ntraps at initial densities of $\\approx 10^6$ atoms/cm$^{-3}$ and translational\ntemperatures of 150 mK. The ability to confine the atoms spatially was\nexploited to study their decay by radiative and collisional processes. The\nevolution of the population of trapped atoms was measured for several\nmilliseconds in dependence of the principal quantum number of the initially\nprepared states, the initial Rydberg-atom density in the trap, and the\ntemperature of the environment of the trap, which could be varied between 7.5 K\nand 300 K using a cryorefrigerator. At room temperature, the population of\ntrapped Rydberg atoms was found to decay faster than expected on the basis of\ntheir natural lifetimes, primarily because of absorption and emission\nstimulated by the thermal radiation field. At the lowest temperatures\ninvestigated experimentally, the decay was found to be multiexponential, with\nan initial rate scaling as $n^{-4}$ and corresponding closely to the natural\nlifetimes of the initially prepared Rydberg-Stark states. The decay rate was\nfound to continually decrease over time and to reach an almost $n$-independent\nrate of more than (1 ms)$^{-1}$ after 3 ms. To analyze the experimentally\nobserved decay of the populations of trapped atoms, numerical simulations were\nperformed which included all radiative processes, i.e., spontaneous emission as\nwell as absorption and emission stimulated by the thermal radiation. These\nsimulations, however, systematically underestimated the population of trapped\natoms observed after several milliseconds by almost two orders of magnitude,\nalthough they reliably predicted the decay rates of the remaining atoms in the\ntrap. The\n", "  The photoelectron spectrum of the $\\textrm{X}^{+}\\,{}^{2}\\Pi \\leftarrow\n\\textrm{X}\\,{}^{1}\\Sigma^{+}$ photoionising transition in iododiacetylene,\nHC$_4$I, has been recorded using pulsed-field-ionisation zero-kinetic-energy\n(PFI-ZEKE) photoelectron spectroscopy with partial resolution of the rotational\nstructure. The first adiabatic ionisation energy of HC$_4$I and the spin-orbit\nsplitting of the X$^{+}\\,{}^{2}\\Pi$ state of HC$_4$I$^+$ are determined as\n$E^{\\textrm{ad}}_{\\textrm{I}}/(hc) = 74470.7(2)$ cm$^{-1}$ and\n$\\Delta\\tilde{\\nu}_{\\textrm{so}} = 1916.7(4)$ cm$^{-1}$, respectively. Several\nvibrational levels of the X$^{+}\\,{}^{2}\\Pi$ electronic ground state of the\nHC$_4$I$^+$ cation have been observed. The experimental data are discussed in\nthe realm of a simple three-state charge-transfer model without adjustable\nparameters which allows for a qualitative description of the electronic\nstructure and spin-orbit coupling in HC$_4$I$^+$ and of the change in bond\nlengths upon ionisation of HC$_4$I.\n", "  Systems of dynamical elements exhibiting spontaneous rhythms are found in\nvarious fields of science and engineering, including physics, chemistry,\nbiology, physiology, and mechanical and electrical engineering. Such dynamical\nelements are often modeled as nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators. In this\narticle, we briefly review phase reduction theory, which is a simple and\npowerful method for analyzing the synchronization properties of limit-cycle\noscillators exhibiting rhythmic dynamics. Through phase reduction theory, we\ncan systematically simplify the nonlinear multi-dimensional differential\nequations describing a limit-cycle oscillator to a one-dimensional phase\nequation, which is much easier to analyze. Classical applications of this\ntheory, i.e., the phase locking of an oscillator to a periodic external forcing\nand the mutual synchronization of interacting oscillators, are explained.\nFurther, more recent applications of this theory to the synchronization of\nnon-interacting oscillators induced by common noise and the dynamics of coupled\noscillators on complex networks are discussed. We also comment on some recent\nadvances in phase reduction theory for noise-driven oscillators and rhythmic\nspatiotemporal patterns.\n", "  Perception, sensation and re-action are central questions both in Psychology,\nArts, Neurology and Physics. Some hundred years ago, believed to start with\nWertheimer, researchers and artists tried to classify our human being\n\"understanding\" of Nature, in terms of \\emph{Gestalt} principles. During same\nperiod \\emph{Quantum} mechanics were developed by Schroedinger, Heisenberg,\nDirac, Majorana and others. In this work we briefly summarize the basic\nconcepts of these two approaches and try to combine them at a simplistic level.\nWe show that, perception and sensation can be handled within electrical signal\nprocessing utilizing Fourier transformation, which finds its counter-part in\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  Reciprocity is a fundamental principle governing various physical systems,\nwhich ensures that the transfer function between any two points in space is\nidentical, regardless of geometrical or material asymmetries. Breaking this\ntransmission symmetry offers enhanced control over signal transport, isolation\nand source protection. So far, devices that break reciprocity have been mostly\nconsidered in dynamic systems, for electromagnetic, acoustic and mechanical\nwave propagation associated with spatio-temporal variations. Here we show that\nit is possible to strongly break reciprocity in static systems, realizing\nmechanical metamaterials that, by combining large nonlinearities with suitable\ngeometrical asymmetries, and possibly topological features, exhibit vastly\ndifferent output displacements under excitation from different sides, as well\nas one-way displacement amplification. In addition to extending non-reciprocity\nand isolation to statics, our work sheds new light on the understanding of\nenergy propagation in non-linear materials with asymmetric crystalline\nstructures and topological properties, opening avenues for energy absorption,\nconversion and harvesting, soft robotics, prosthetics and optomechanics.\n", "  We discuss some attempts for the construction of gravity duals of QCD-like\ntheories. It is analysed some properties of solutions of 10D Type IIB\nsupergravity theory that attempt to be dual to $\\mathcal{N}$=1 gauge theories,\nin particular the solutions that belong to Papadoulos-Tseytlin ansatz. We argue\nthat one could obtain 5D effective theories from 10d solutions and it motivates\nthe use of phenomenological AdS/QCD models.\n", "  In this work, we evaluate a multitude of metal-oxide bi-layers and\ndemonstrate the benefits from increased memory stability via multibit memory\noperation. We introduce a programming methodology that allows for operating\nmetal-oxide memristive devices as multibit memory elements with highly packed\nyet clearly discernible memory states. We finally demonstrate a 5.5-bit memory\ncell (47 resistive states) with excellent retention and power consumption\nperformance. This paves the way for neuromorphic and non-volatile memory\napplications.\n", "  The total magnetic energy of Lithium ferrite thin films was determined using\nthe classical Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The short range magnetic dipole\ninteractions between spins within one unit cell and the interactions between\nspins in two adjacent unit cells have been determined in order to find the\ntotal magnetic energy of lithium ferrite films. Only the spin pairs with\nseparation less than cell constant have been taken into account to calculate\ndipole interaction and spin exchange interaction. Theoretically several easy\nand hard directions of lithium ferrite film were found for one set of energy\nparameters included in our modified Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The dependence of\ntotal magnetic energy of a lithium ferrite film on number of unit cells, spin\nexchange interaction, dipole interaction, second order magnetic anisotropy,\nfourth order magnetic anisotropy, internal applied magnetic field and stress\ninduced magnetic anisotropy has been explained in this manuscript.\n", "  For the ideal Fermi gas that fills the space inside a cylindrical tube, there\nare calculated the thermodynamic characteristics in general form for arbitrary\ntemperatures, namely: the thermodynamic potential, energy, entropy, equations\nof state, heat capacities and compressibilities. All these quantities are\nexpressed through the introduced standard functions and their derivatives. The\nradius of the tube is considered as an additional thermodynamic variable. It is\nshown that at low temperatures in the quasi-one-dimensional case the\ntemperature dependencies of the entropy and heat capacities remain linear. The\ndependencies of the entropy and heat capacities on the chemical potential have\nsharp maximums at the points where the filling of a new discrete level begins.\nThe character of dependencies of thermodynamic quantities on the tube radius\nproves to be qualitatively different in the cases of fixed linear and fixed\ntotal density. At the fixed linear density these dependencies are monotonous\nand at the fixed total density they have an oscillating character. Key words:\nFermi particle, nanotube, thermodynamic functions, low-dimensional systems,\nequation of state, heat capacity, compressibility\n", "  In extending the analysis of the four secular resonances between close orbits\nin Li and Christou (Celest Mech Dyn Astron 125:133-160, 2016) (Paper I), we\ngeneralise the semianalytical model so that it applies to both prograde and\nretrograde orbits with a one to one map between the resonances in the two\nregimes. We propose the general form of the critical angle to be a linear\ncombination of apsidal and nodal differences between the two orbits $ b_1\n\\Delta \\varpi + b_2 \\Delta \\Omega $, forming a collection of secular resonances\nin which the ones studied in Paper I are among the strongest. Test of the model\nin the orbital vicinity of massive satellites with physical and orbital\nparameters similar to those of the irregular satellites Himalia at Jupiter and\nPhoebe at Saturn shows that $> 20\\%$ and $> 40\\%$ of phase space is affected by\nthese resonances, respectively. The survivability of the resonances is\nconfirmed using numerical integration of the full Newtonian equations of\nmotion. We observe that the lowest order resonances with $b_1+|b_2|\\le 3$\npersist, while even higher order resonances, up to $b_1+|b_2|\\ge 7$, survive.\nDepending on the mass, between $10\\%-60\\%$ of the integrated test particles are\ncaptured in these secular resonances, in agreement with the phase space\nanalysis in the semianalytical model.\n", "  The belief that three dimensional space is infinite and flat in the absence\nof matter is a canon of physics that has been in place since the time of\nNewton. The assumption that space is flat at infinity has guided several modern\nphysical theories. But what do we actually know to support this belief? A\nsimple argument, called the \"Telescope Principle\", asserts that all that we can\nknow about space is bounded by observations. Physical theories are best when\nthey can be verified by observations, and that should also apply to the\ngeometry of space. The Telescope Principle is simple to state, but it leads to\nvery interesting insights into relativity and Yang-Mills theory via projective\nequivalences of their respective spaces.\n", "  Symmetry plays an important role in understanding the nuclear structure\nproperties from the rotation of a nucleus to the spin, parity and isospin of\nnuclear states. This simplifies the complexity of the nuclear problems in one\nway or the other. Seniority is also a well known quantum number which arises\ndue to the symmetry in the pairing interaction of nuclei. We present empirical\nas well as theoretical evidences based on decay rates which support the\ngoodness of seniority at higher spins as well as in nrich or, n-deficient\nnuclei. We find that the generalized seniority governs the identical trends of\nhigh-spin isomers in different semi-magic chains, where different set of\nnucleon orbitals from different valence spaces are involved.\n", "  We study the presence of exact localized solutions in a quadratic-cubic\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with inhomogeneous nonlinearities. Using a\nspecific ansatz, we transform the nonautonomous nonlinear equation into an\nautonomous one, which engenders composed states corresponding to solutions\nlocalized in space, with an oscillating behavior in time. Direct numerical\nsimulations are employed to verify the stability of the modulated solutions\nagainst small random perturbations.\n", "  Matter exhibits phases and their transitions. These transitions are\nclassified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While\nthe latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the\nformer is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation,\nsince their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude.\nA theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group\ntheory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom. Here we\nshow first that classical nucleation and growth theories alone cannot explain\nthe FOPTs of the paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by linearly\nvarying an externally applied field. Then we offer compelling evidence that the\ntransitions agree well with the renormalization-group theory when logarithmic\ncorrections are properly considered. This unifies the theories for both classes\nof transitions and FOPTs can be studied using universality and scaling similar\nto their continuous counterpart.\n", "  This article is devoted to obtaining an equation for the Abraham force in a\ncontinuous non-conducting medium and methods of its measurement. The equation\nfor the Abraham force is obtained from the Minkowski tensor. The Abraham force\nappears when the vectors D and E, H and B are non-collinear. From the equation\nfor the Abraham force it follows that it is a vortex force, and its divergence\nis equal to zero. It shows the existence of the Abraham electric force and the\nmagnetic Abraham's force. Various measurement methods of the Abraham force,\nwhich follow from its equation, are given.\n", "  Proteins work only if folded in their native state, but changes in\ntemperature T and pressure P induce their unfolding. Therefore for each protein\nthere is a stability region (SR) in the T-P thermodynamic plane outside which\nthe biomolecule is denaturated. It is known that the extension and shape of the\nSR depend on i) the specific protein residue-residue interactions in the native\nstate of the amino acids sequence and ii) the water properties at the hydration\ninterface. Here we analyze by Monte Carlo simulations of different\ncoarse-grained protein models in explicit water how changes in i) and ii)\naffect the SR. We show that the solvent properties ii) are essential to\nrationalize the SR shape at low T and high P and that our finding are robust\nwith respect to parameter changes and with respect to different protein models.\nThese results can help in developing new strategies for the design of novel\nsynthetic biopolymers.\n", "  The process of wave propagation in an infinite linear chain is analyzed.\nEstablished, that dispersion relation between the angular frequency and the\nwave number for transverse waves differs from similar dependencies for\nlongitudinal.\n", "  In this paper we propose an ad-hoc construction of the Likelihood Function,\nin order to develop a data analysis procedure, to be applied in atomic and\nnuclear spectral analysis. The classical Likelihood Function was modified\ntaking into account the underlying statistics of the phenomena studied, by the\ninspection of the residues of the fitting, which should behave with specific\nstatistical properties. This new formulation was analytically developed, but\nthe sought parameter should be evaluated numerically, since it cannot be\nobtained as a function of each one of the independent variables. For this\nsimple numerical evaluation, along with the acquired data, we also should\nprocess many sets of external data, with specific properties - This new data\nshould be uncorrelated with the acquired signal. The developed statistical\nmethod was evaluated using computer simulated spectra. The numerical\nestimations of the calculated parameter applying this method, indicate an\nimprovement over accuracy and precision, being one order of magnitude better\nthan those produced by least squares approaches. We still have to evaluate the\nimprovement produced by this method over Detection and Quantitation Limits, in\nTXRF spectral analysis.\n", "  To solve the $\\mu$ problem of the MSSM, the $\\mu$ from $\\nu$ Supersymmetric\nStandard Model ($\\mu\\nu$SSM) introduces three singlet right-handed neutrino\nsuperfields $\\hat{\\nu}_i^c$, which lead to the mixing of the neutral components\nof the Higgs doublets with the sneutrinos, producing a relatively large CP-even\nneutral scalar mass matrix. In this work, we analytically diagonalize the\nCP-even neutral scalar mass matrix and analyze in detail how the mixing impacts\nthe lightest Higgs boson mass. We also give an approximate expression for the\nlightest Higgs boson mass. Simultaneously, we consider the radiative\ncorrections to the Higgs boson masses with effective potential methods.\n", "  Semilocal exchange-correlation functionals are the most accurate, realistic\nand widely used ones to describe the complex many-electron effects of\ntwo-dimensional quantum systems. Beyond local density approximation, the\ngeneralized gradient approximations(GGAs) are designed using reduced density\ngradient as main ingredient. An enhancement factor is constructed using the\ninhomogeneity parameter of GGAs by taking care of the low and high density\nbehaviors of it. Thus, the exchange energy functional proposed by making use of\nthe aforementioned enhancement factor, significantly reduces the error compare\nto the previously proposed gradient approximations. Another enhancement factor\nand corresponding energy functional is also constructed using the inhomogeneity\nparameter originally introduced by Becke [J. Chem. Phys. 109, 2092 (1998)].\nComprehensive testing and performance of both the functionals are demonstrated\nwith respect to the exact exchange formalism by considering two-dimensional\nparabolically confined quantum dots with varying particle number and\nconfinement strength as a test case.\n", "  Much effort has been devoted to device and materials engineering to realize\nnanoscale resistance random access memory (RRAM) for practical applications,\nbut there still lacks a rational physical basis to be relied on to design\nscalable devices spanning many length scales. In particular, the critical\nswitching criterion is not clear for RRAM devices in which resistance changes\nare limited to localized nanoscale filaments that experience concentrated heat,\nelectric current and field. Here, we demonstrate voltage-controlled resistance\nswitching for macro and nano devices in both filamentary RRAM and nanometallic\nRRAM, the latter switches uniformly and does not require forming. As a result,\nusing a constant current density as the compliance, we have achieved\narea-scalability for the low resistance state of the filamentary RRAM, and for\nboth the low and high resistance states of the nanometallic RRAM. This finding\nwill help design area-scalable RRAM at the nanoscale.\n", "  Lecture notes for 8 lectures on the `Physics of Lyman alpha Radiative\nTransfer', given at the 46th Saas-Fee winter school held in Les Diablerets,\nSwitzerland on March 13-19 2016. These lectures aimed at offering basic\ninsights into Lyman alpha (Lya) radiative processes including emission\nprocesses and Lya radiative transfer, and highlighting some of the physics\nassociated with these processes. The notes include derivations in greater\ndetail than what was discussed during the lectures.\n", "  Incident cosmic ray fluxes over flying aircrafts are compared with those in\nBucaramanga, Colombia and very significant differences are observed for proton\nand neutron fluxes. We also obtained that major contributions in the deposited\nenergy by Cherenkov photons on blood plasma is in the UV-C band.\n", "  The nonlinear capacitors are important devices in modern technologies and\napplied physics. The aim of this paper is to calculate exactly the capacitance\nand the electrostatic potential energy of a nonlinear parallel-plate capacitor\nby using a two-parameter modification of Born-Infeld electrodynamics. Our\ncalculations show that the capacitance and the electrostatic potential energy\nof a nonlinear parallel-plate capacitor in modified Born-Infeld theory have the\nweak field expansions $C=\\frac{\\epsilon_{0} A}{d}+{\\cal O}(q^{2})$ and\n$U=\\frac{q^{2}}{2(\\frac{\\epsilon_{0} A}{d})}+{\\cal O}(q^{4})$, where $q$ is the\namount of electric charge on each plate of the capacitor. It is demonstrated\nthat the results of this paper are in agreement with the results of Maxwell\nelectrodynamics for weak electric fields. Numerical evaluations show that the\nnonlinear electrodynamical effects in modified Born-Infeld theory are\nnegligible in the weak field regime.\n", "  We investigate quantum Hall stripes under in-plane magnetic field\n$B_\\parallel$ in a variable-density two-dimensional electron gas. At filling\nfactor $\\nu = 9/2$, we observe one, two, and zero $B_\\parallel$-induced\nreorientations at low, intermediate, and high densities, respectively. The\nappearance of these distinct regimes is due to a strong density dependence of\nthe $B_\\parallel$-induced orienting mechanism which triggers the second\nreorientation, rendering stripes \\emph{parallel} to $B_\\parallel$. In contrast,\nthe mechanism which reorients stripes perpendicular to $B_\\parallel$ showed no\nnoticeable dependence on density. Measurements at $\\nu = 9/2$ and $11/2$ at the\nsame, tilted magnetic field, allows us to rule out density dependence of the\nnative symmetry-breaking field as a dominant factor. Our findings further\nsuggest that screening might play an important role in determining stripe\norientation, providing guidance in developing theories aimed at identifying and\ndescribing native and $B_\\parallel$-induced symmetry-breaking fields.\n", "  Our magnetotransport measurements of quantum Hall stripes in a high-quality\nGaAs quantum well in a slightly tilted magnetic field reveal that the\norientation of stripes can be changed by temperature. Field-cooling and\nfield-warming measurements, as well as observation of hysteresis at\nintermediate temperatures allow us to conclude that the observed\ntemperature-induced reorientation of stripes is owing to the existence of two\ndistinct minima in the symmetry-breaking potential. We also find that the\nnative symmetry-breaking mechanism does not depend on temperature and that\nlow-temperature magnetotransport data should be treated with caution as they do\nnot necessarily reveal the true ground state, even in the absence of\nhysteresis.\n", "  We describe a tunable low-energy photon source consisting of a laser-driven\nxenon plasma lamp coupled to a Czerny-Turner monochromator. The combined\ntunability, brightness, and narrow spectral bandwidth make this light source\nuseful in laboratory-based high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy\nexperiments. The source supplies photons with energies up to ~7 eV, delivering\nunder typical conditions >10^12 ph/s within a 10 meV spectral bandwidth, which\nis comparable to helium plasma lamps and many synchrotron beamlines. We first\ndescribe the lamp and monochromator system and then characterize its output,\nwith attention to those parameters which are of interest for photoemission\nexperiments. Finally, we present angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data\nusing the light source and compare its performance to a conventional helium\nplasma lamp.\n", "  The ability of graphene to support long-lived, electrically tunable plasmons\nthat interact strongly with light, combined with its highly nonlinear optical\nresponse, has generated great expectations for application of the\natomically-thin material to nanophotonic devices. These expectations are mainly\nreinforced by classical analyses performed using the response derived from\nextended graphene, neglecting finite-size and nonlocal effects that become\nimportant when the carbon layer is structured on the nanometer scale in actual\ndevice designs. Here we show that finite-size effects produce large\ncontributions that increase the nonlinear response of nanostructured graphene\nto significantly higher levels than those predicted by classical theories. We\nbase our analysis on a quantum-mechanical description of graphene using\ntight-binding electronic states combined with the random-phase approximation.\nWhile classical and quantum descriptions agree well for the linear response\nwhen either the plasmon energy is below the Fermi energy or the size of the\nstructure exceeds a few tens of nanometers, this is not always the case for the\nnonlinear response, and in particular, third-order Kerr-type nonlinearities are\ngenerally underestimated by the classical theory. Our results reveal the\ncomplex quantum nature of the optical response in nanostructured graphene,\nwhile further supporting the exceptional potential of this material for\nnonlinear nanophotonic devices.\n", "  The problem of node-centric, or local, community detection in information\nnetworks refers to the identification of a community for a given input node,\nhaving limited information about the network topology. Existing methods for\nsolving this problem, however, are not conceived to work on complex networks.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework for local community detection based\non the multilayer network model. Our approach relies on the maximization of the\nratio between the community internal connection density and the external\nconnection density, according to multilayer similarity-based community\nrelations. We also define a biasing scheme that allows the discovery of local\ncommunities characterized by different degrees of layer-coverage\ndiversification. Experimental evaluation conducted on real-world multilayer\nnetworks has shown the significance of our approach.\n", "  We report on mid-infrared imaging of hot cores performed with SpectroCam-10\nand TIMMI2. The observations aimed at the detection of thermal emission\npresumably associated with the hot cores. Mid-infrared flux measurements are\nrequired to improve the luminosity and optical depth estimates for these\nsources. Results are presented for W3(H$_2$O), G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, and the\npossible hot core candidate G232.620+0.996. They illustrate that the morphology\nof these sources cannot be described by simple geometries. Therefore,\nline-of-sight effects and considerable extinction even at mid-infrared\nwavelengths must not be neglected.\n", "  We study the motion of gap solitons in two models of apodized nonlinear fiber\nBragg gratings (BGs), with the local reflectivity (LR) varying along the fiber.\nA single step of LR, and a periodic array of alternating steps with opposite\nsigns (a \"Bragg superstructure\") are considered. A challenging possibility is\nto slow down and eventually halt the soliton by passing it through the step of\nincreasing reflectivity, thus capturing a pulse of standing light. First, we\ndevelop an analytical approach, assuming adiabatic evolution of the soliton,\nand making use of the energy conservation and balance equation for the\nmomentum. Comparison with simulations shows that the analytical approximation\nis quite accurate (unless the inhomogeneity is too steep): the soliton is\neither transmitted across the step or bounces back. If the step is narrow,\nsystematic simulations demontrate that the soliton splits into transmitted and\nreflected pulses (splitting of a BG soliton which hits a chirped grating was\nobserved in experiments). Moving through the periodic \"superstructure\", the\nsoliton accummulates distortion and suffers radiation loss if the structure is\ncomposed of narrow steps. The soliton moves without any loss or irreversible\ndeformation through the array of sufficiently broad steps.\n"]}
