The first letters are usually the least\neasy to predict. This agrees with the intuitive notion that words are well\ndefined subunits in written languages, with much weaker correlations across\nthese units than within them. It implies that the average entropy of a letter\ndeep inside a word is roughly 4 times smaller than the entropy of the first\nletter.\n", "  Finite physical systems have only a finite amount of distinct state. This\nfiniteness is fundamental in statistical mechanics, where the maximum number of\ndistinct states compatible with macroscopic constraints defines entropy. Here\nwe show that finiteness of distinct state is similarly fundamental in ordinary\nmechanics: energy and momentum are defined by the maximum number of distinct\nstates possible in a given time or distance. More generally, any moment of\nenergy or momentum bounds distinct states in time or space. These results\ngeneralize both the Nyquist bandwidth-bound on distinct values in classical\nsignals, and quantum uncertainty bounds. The new certainty bounds are achieved\nby finite-bandwidth evolutions in which time and space are effectively\ndiscrete, including quantum evolutions that are effectively classical. Since\nenergy and momentum count distinct states, they are defined in finite-state\ndynamics, and they relate classical mechanics to finite-state evolution.\n", "  In this work we apply the density matrices approach to orbital ordering (OO)\nin order to study the OO of the spinel vanadates AV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (A $\\equiv$\nZn, Cd and Mg), which is normally believed to be responsible for the structural\ntransition from cubic to tetragonal phase observed in these compounds. The\ndensity matrices of vanadium atoms are obtained by using {\\it state-of-the-art}\nfull-potential linearized augmented plane wave method based GGA+U calculations.\nIn the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the present study shows the existence of\nanti-ferro OO in the global (local octahedral) coordinate system where $d_{xz}$\nand $d_{yz}$ ($d_{xz}$+$d_{yz}$ and $d_{xz}$-$d_{yz}$) orbitals are mainly\noccupied at the neighboring V sites for all the compounds.\n", "  I review the evolution of binary supermassive black holes and focus on the\nstellar-dynamical mechanisms that may help to overcome the final-parsec problem\n- the possible stalling of the binary at a separation much larger than is\nrequired for an efficient gravitational wave emission. Recent N-body\nsimulations have suggested that a departure from spherical symmetry in the\nnucleus of the galaxy may keep the rate of interaction of stars with the binary\nat a high enough level so that the binary continues to shrink rather rapidly.\nHowever, a major problem of all these simulations is that they do not probe the\nregime where collisionless effects are dominant - in other words, the number of\nparticles in the simulation is still not sufficient to reach the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the system. I present a novel Monte Carlo method for simulating\nboth collisional and collisionless evolution of non-spherical stellar systems,\nand apply it for the problem of binary supermassive black hole evolution. I\nshow that in triaxial galaxies the final-parsec problem is largely\nnon-existent, while in the axisymmetric case it seems to still exist in the\nlimit of purely collisionless regime relevant for real galaxies, but disappears\nin the N-body simulations where the feasible values of N are still too low to\nget rid of collisional effects.\n", "  In the present work, we investigate the applicability of the LSDA+$U$ method\nin understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of a geometrically\nfrustrated ZnV$_2$O$_4$ compound, where the delicate balance of electrons,\nlattice, orbital and spin interactions play an important role in deciding its\nphysical properties. In the ferromagnetic solution of the compound, only one\ntype of orbital solution is found to exist in all ranges of $U$ studied here.\nHowever, in antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase, two types of orbital solutions,\nAFM(OS1) and AFM(OS2), exist for $U >$3 eV. If the difference of the electronic\noccupancy of $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals is less than 0.25, then AFM(OS1)\nsolution is stabilized, whereas for higher values AFM(OS2) solution is\nstabilized. The use of unconstrained calculations within the fully localized\ndouble counting scheme is unable to predict the AFM ground state for $U\n\\leqslant$3 eV. Our results clearly suggest the importance of constrained\ncalculations in understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of a\ncompound, where various competing interactions are present. In the AFM\nsolution, the orbital ground state of the compound changes with varying $U$,\nwhere AFM(OS1) is found to be the ground state for $U \\leqslant$3 eV and for\nhigher values of $U$, AFM(OS2) is the ground state. The analysis of the band\ngap suggests that the AFM(OS2) is the real ground state of the compound.\n", "  This work is a follow-up to the paper, \"Numerical Relativity as a Tool for\nStudying the Early Universe\". In this article, we determine if cosmological\ngravitational waves can be accurately extracted from a dynamical spacetime\nusing an averaging process as opposed to conventional methods of gravitational\nwave extraction using a complex Weyl scalar. We calculate the normalized energy\ndensity, strain and degree of polarization of gravitational waves produced by a\nsimulated turbulent plasma similar to what was believed to have existed shortly\nafter the electroweak scale. This calculation is completed using two numerical\ncodes, one which utilizes full General Relativity calculations based on\nmodified BSSN equations while the other utilizes a linearized approximation of\nGeneral Relativity. Our results show that the spectrum of gravitational waves\ncalculated from the nonlinear code using an averaging process are nearly\nindistinguishable from those calculated from the linear code. This result\nvalidates the use of the averaging process for gravitational wave extraction of\ncosmological systems.\n", "  We consider the whole-plane SLE conformal map f from the unit disk to the\nslit plane, and show that its mixed moments, involving a power p of the\nderivative modulus |f'| and a power q of the map |f| itself, have closed forms\nalong some integrability curves in the (p,q) moment plane, which depend\ncontinuously on the SLE parameter kappa. The generalization of this\nintegrability property to the m-fold transform of f is also given. We define a\ngeneralized integral means spectrum corresponding to the singular behavior of\nthe mixed moments above. By inversion, it allows for a unified description of\nthe unbounded interior and bounded exterior versions of whole-plane SLE, and of\ntheir m-fold generalizations. The average generalized spectrum of whole-plane\nSLE takes four possible forms, separated by five phase transition lines in the\nmoment plane, whereas the average generalized spectrum of the m-fold\nwhole-plane SLE is directly obtained from a linear map acting in that plane. We\nalso conjecture the form of the universal generalized integral means spectrum.\n", "  The inconsistency about the degree of geometrical frustration has been a long\nissue in AV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (A $\\equiv$ Zn, Cd and Mg) compounds, which arises\nfrom the two experimental results: (i) frustration indices and (ii) magnetic\nmoments. In the present study, we try to understand such inconsistency by using\n{\\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations. The orbital degrees of\nfreedom are found to play an important role in understanding the geometrically\nfrustrated magnetic behaviour of these compounds. The inclusion of the orbital\nand spin angular momenta for calculating the frustration indices improves the\nunderstanding about the degree of geometrical frustration in these compounds.\nThe calculated values of the frustration indices ($f$$_{\\it J}$) are largest\nfor MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and smallest for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ for 3.3$\\leq$ $U\n\\leq$5.3 eV. In this range of $U$, the calculated values of\n$\\Delta$M$_{2}$=M$_{\\rm total}$-M$_{\\rm exp}$ are largest for MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$\nand smallest for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. Hence, the consistency about the degree of\ngeometrical frustration is achieved. The absolute values of the nearest\nneighbour exchange coupling constant ({\\it J$_{nn}$}) between V spins are found\nto be largest for MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and smallest for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, which\nindicate that the calculated absolute values of the Curie-Weiss temperature\n($\\varTheta$$_{CW}$)$_{\\it J}$ are highest for MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and smallest\nfor CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ for 3.3$\\leq$ $U \\leq$5.3 eV. In this range of $U$, the\nmagnetic transition temperature ($T$$_{N}$)$_{\\it J}$ is found to be $\\sim$150\nK, $\\sim$60 K and $\\sim$22 K for MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\nCdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, respectively, which shows that the order of ($T$$_{N}$)$_{\\it\nJ}$ is similar to that of ($T$$_{N}$)$_{\\rm exp}$ for these compounds.\n", "  We revisit the duality between ALE singularities in M-theory and 7-branes on\na circle in F-theory. We see that a frozen M-theory singularity maps to a\ncircle compactification involving a rotation of the plane transverse to the\n7-brane, showing an interesting correspondence between commuting triples in\nsimply-laced groups and Kodaira's classification of singular elliptic\nfibrations. Our analysis strongly suggests that the O7+ plane is the only\ncompletely frozen F-theory singularity.\n", "  Local realism in recent experiments is excluded on condition of freedom or\nrandomness of choice combined with no signaling between observers by\nimplementations of simple quantum models. Both no-signaling and the underlying\nquantum model can be directly checked by analysis of experimental data. For\nparticular tests performed on the data, it is shown that two of these\nexperiments give the probability of the data under no-signaling (or choice\nindependence in one of them) hypothesis at the level of 5%, accounting for the\nlook-elsewhere-effect, moderately suggesting that no-signaling is violated with\n95% confidence. On the other hand the data from the two other experiments\nviolate the assumption of the simple quantum model. Further experiments are\nnecessary to clarify these issues and freedom and randomness of choice.\n", "  We study the stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies in the range\n9.7<log_10(M_*/h^-2 M_sun)<11.7 and z<0.4, obtained from a combined analysis of\nthe Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey.\nWe use ~100 deg^2 of KiDS data to study the lensing signal around galaxies for\nwhich spectroscopic redshifts and stellar masses were determined by GAMA. We\nshow that lensing alone results in poor constraints on the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation due to a degeneracy between the satellite fraction and the halo mass,\nwhich is lifted when we simultaneously fit the stellar mass function. At\nM_sun>5x10^10 h^-2 M_sun, the stellar mass increases with halo mass as\n~M_h^0.25. The ratio of dark matter to stellar mass has a minimum at a halo\nmass of 8x10^11 h^-1 M_sun with a value of M_h/M_*=56_-10^+16 [h]. We also use\nthe GAMA group catalogue to select centrals and satellites in groups with five\nor more members, which trace regions in space where the local matter density is\nhigher than average, and determine for the first time the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation in these denser environments. We find no significant differences\ncompared to the relation from the full sample, which suggests that the\nstellar-to-halo mass relation does not vary strongly with local density.\nFurthermore, we find that the stellar-to-halo mass relation of central galaxies\ncan also be obtained by modelling the lensing signal and stellar mass function\nof satellite galaxies only, which shows that the assumptions to model the\nsatellite contribution in the halo model do not significantly bias the\nstellar-to-halo mass relation. Finally, we show that the combination of weak\nlensing with the stellar mass function can be used to test the purity of group\ncatalogues.\n", "  We present new tests to identify stationary position-dependent additive shear\nbiases in weak gravitational lensing data sets. These tests are important\ndiagnostics for currently ongoing and planned cosmic shear surveys, as such\nbiases induce coherent shear patterns that can mimic and potentially bias the\ncosmic shear signal. The central idea of these tests is to determine the\naverage ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the\npixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged\nellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to\nsystematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the\nspatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution\nfrom cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a\nposition-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the\npublicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence\nfor a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this\nresidual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at\nthose scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the\npublished cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS. In CFHTLenS, the amplitude of this\nsystematic signal is consistent with zero in fields where the number of stars\nused to model the PSF is higher than average, suggesting that the\nposition-dependent additive shear bias originates from undersampled PSF\nvariations across the image.\n", "  We complete the mathematical analysis of the fine structure of harmonic\nmeasure on SLE curves that was initiated by Beliaev and Smirnov, as described\nby the averaged integral means spectrum. For the unbounded version of\nwhole-plane SLE as studied by Duplantier, Nguyen, Nguyen and Zinsmeister, and\nLoutsenko and Yermolayeva, a phase transition has been shown to occur for high\nenough moments from the bulk spectrum towards a novel spectrum related to the\npoint at infinity. For the bounded version of whole-plane SLE studied here, a\nsimilar transition phenomenon, now associated with the SLE origin, is proved to\nexist for low enough moments, but we show that it is superseded by the earlier\noccurrence of the transition to the SLE tip spectrum.\n", "  Cubic to tetragonal distortion in spinel compounds have been a contentious\nissue for last two decades. Different groups have proposed different mechanisms\nto understand such a distortion in these spinels, which are: (i) spin lattice\ncoupling mechanism known as the spin driven Jahn-Teller (JT) effect, (ii) the\nstrong relativistic spin-orbit coupling, a moderate JT distortion and weak V-V\ninteractions and (iii) the JT effect. Now, in order to know the possible cause\nfor such a distortion, we have avoided these complexities (various interactions\namong spin, electronic, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom) by carrying out\nspin unpolarized calculations. The calculated values of bulk moduli for\nZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (ZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$), MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$) and\nCdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (CdCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$) are found to be $\\sim$289 ($\\sim$254),\n$\\sim$244 ($\\sim$243) and $\\sim$230 ($\\sim$233) GPa, respectively. For\nvanadates and chromates, the order of calculated values of lattice parameter\n$a$ are found to CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\nCdCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$ZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$, respectively and are\nconsistent with the experimental results. The calculated values of cubic to\ntetragonal distortion (c/a), with c/a$<$1 for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$\n(ZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$), MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$) and CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$\n(CdCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$) are $\\sim$0.996 ($\\sim$0.997), $\\sim$0.995 ($\\sim$0.994)\nand $\\sim$0.997 ($\\sim$0.998), respectively. These values are in good agreement\nwith the experimental data for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$,\nZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ compounds. The present study clearly\nshows the role of ionic sizes in inducing the cubic to tetragonal distortion in\nthese spinels. These mechanisms also appear to be responsible for deciding the\nother physical properties of these compounds.\n", "  We propose and implement a quantum procedure for enhancing the sensitivity\nwith which one can determine the phase shift experienced by a weak light beam\npossessing thermal statistics in passing through an interferometer. Our\nprocedure entails subtracting exactly one (which can be generalized to m)\nphotons from the light field exiting an interferometer containing a\nphase-shifting element in one of its arms. As a consequence of the process of\nphoton subtraction, and somewhat surprisingly, the mean photon number and\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the resulting light field are thereby increased,\nleading to enhanced interferometry. This method can be used to increase\nmeasurement sensitivity in a variety of practical applications, including that\nof forming the image of an object illuminated only by weak thermal light.\n", "  We study reachable sets of open n-qubit quantum systems, whose coherent parts\nare under full unitary control, by adding as a further degree of incoherent\ncontrol switchable Markovian noise on a single qubit. In particular, adding\nbang-bang control of amplitude damping noise (non-unital) allows the dynamic\nsystem to act transitively on the entire set of density operators. Thus one can\ntransform any initial quantum state into any desired target state. Adding\nswitchable bit-flip noise (unital) instead suffices to get all states majorised\nby the initial state. Our open-loop optimal control package DYNAMO is extended\nby incoherent control to exploit these unprecedented reachable sets in\nexperiments. We propose implementation by a GMon, a superconducting device with\nfast tunable coupling to an open transmission line, and illustrate how\nopen-loop control with noise switching achieves all state transfers without\nmeasurement-based closed-loop feedback and resettable ancilla.\n", "  Cat states of the microwave field stored in high-Q resonators show great\npromise for robust encoding and manipulation of quantum information. Here we\npropose an approach to efficiently prepare such cat states in a Kerr-nonlinear\nresonator by the use of a two-photon drive. We show that this preparation is\nrobust against single-photon loss. We moreover find that it is possible to\nremove undesirable phase evolution induced by a Kerr nonlinearity using a\ntwo-photon drive of appropriate amplitude and phase. Finally, we present a\nuniversal set of quantum logical gates that can be performed on the engineered\neigenspace of the two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonator.\n", "  Weak lensing statistics is typically measured as weighted sum of shear\nestimators or their products (shear-shear correlation). The weighting schemes\nare designed in the hope of minimizing the statistical error without\nintroducing systematic errors. It would be ideal to approach the Cramer-Rao\nbound (the lower bound of the statistical uncertainty) in shear statistics,\nthough it is generally difficult to do so in practice. The reasons may include:\ndifficulties in galaxy shape measurement, inaccurate knowledge of the\nprobability-distribution-function (PDF) of the shear estimator,\nmisidentification of point sources as galaxies, etc.. Using the shear\nestimators defined in Zhang et al. (2015), we show that one can overcome all\nthese problems, and allow shear measurement accuracy to approach the Cramer-Rao\nbound. This can be achieved by symmetrizing the PDF of the shear estimator, or\nthe joint PDF of shear estimator pairs (for shear-shear correlation), without\nany prior knowledge of the PDF. Using simulated galaxy images, we demonstrate\nthat under general observing conditions, this idea works as expected: it\nminimizes the statistical uncertainty without introducing systematic error.\n", "  The density of electron-hole pairs produced in a graphene sample immersed in\na homogeneous time-dependent electrical field is evaluated. Because low energy\ncharge carriers in graphene are described by relativistic quantum mechanics,\nthe calculation is performed within the strong field quantum electrodynamics\nformalism, requiring a solution of the Dirac equation in momentum space. The\nlatter is solved using a split-operator numerical scheme on parallel computers,\nallowing for the investigation of several field configurations. The strength of\nthe method is illustrated by computing the electron momentum density generated\nfrom a realistic laser pulse model. We observe quantum interference patterns\nreminiscent of Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg interferometry.\n", "  Matrix Product States (MPSs) provide a powerful framework to study and\nclassify gapped quantum phases --symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in\nparticular--defined in one dimensional lattices. On the other hand, it is\nnatural to expect that gapped quantum phases in the limit of zero correlation\nlength are described by topological quantum field theories (TFTs or TQFTs). In\nthis paper, for (1+1)-dimensional bosonic SPT phases protected by symmetry $G$,\nwe bridge their descriptions in terms of MPSs, and those in terms of\n$G$-equivariant TFTs. In particular, for various topological invariants (SPT\ninvariants) constructed previously using MPSs, we provide derivations from the\npoint of view of (1+1) TFTs. We also discuss the connection between boundary\ndegrees of freedom, which appear when one introduces a physical boundary in SPT\nphases, and \"open\" TFTs, which are TFTs defined on spacetimes with boundaries.\n", "  In this work, we try to understand the inconsistency reported by [Yaresko,\nPhys. Rev. B. {\\bf 77}, 115106 (2008)] in the theoretically estimated nature\nand the variation of magnitude of nearest neighbour exchange coupling constant\n($\\arrowvert${\\it J$_{1}$}$\\arrowvert$) with increasing $U$ in ACr$_{2}$O$_{4}$\n(A=Zn, Cd, Mg and Hg) compounds by using density functional theory. In\nunconstrained calculations, the nature and variation of $\\arrowvert${\\it\nJ$_{1}$}$\\arrowvert$ as a function of $U$ in the present study are not\nconsistent with the experimental data and not according to the relation, {\\it\nJ$_{1}$}$\\propto$$\\frac{t^{2}}{U}$ especially for CdCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\nHgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ for $U >$3 eV and U=2-6 eV, respectively. Such an\ninconsistent behavior of $\\arrowvert${\\it J$_{1}$}$\\arrowvert$ is almost\nsimilar to that of Yaresko for these two compounds for $U$=2-4 eV. For\nZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$, the nature and the variation of\n$\\arrowvert${\\it J$_{1}$}$\\arrowvert$ in the present work are in accordance\nwith the experimental data and above mentioned relation for $U$=2-6 eV and are\nsimilar to that of Yaresko for ZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$ for $U$=2-4 eV. However, in\nconstrained calculations the nature and variation of $\\arrowvert${\\it\nJ$_{1}$}$_{c}$$\\arrowvert$ in the present work are according to experimental\ndata and above above mentioned relation for all four compounds. Hence, the\npresent study shows the importance of constrained calculations in understanding\nthe magnetic behaviour of these spinels. The values of magnitude of Curie-Weiss\ntemperature [$\\arrowvert$($\\varTheta$$_{CW}$)$_{c}$$\\arrowvert$] for\nZnCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$MgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$CdCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$HgCr$_{2}$O$_{4}$\nfor $U$=2-5 eV, which are according to the order of experimentally observed\nvalues for these spinels.\n", "  The question whether quantum mechanics is complete and the nature of the\ntransition between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics have intrigued\nphysicists for decades. There have been many experimental breakthroughs in\ncreating larger and larger quantum superposition and entangled states since\nErwin Schr\\\"odinger proposed his famous thought experiment of putting a cat in\na superposition of both alive and dead states in 1935. Remarkably, recent\ndevelopments in quantum optomechanics and electromechanics may lead to the\nrealization of quantum superposition of living microbes soon. Recent evidence\nalso suggests that quantum coherence may play an important role in several\nbiological processes. In this review, we first give a brief introduction to\nbasic concepts in quantum mechanics and the Schr\\\"odinger's cat thought\nexperiment. We then review developments in creating quantum superposition and\nentangled states and the realization of quantum teleportation. Non-trivial\nquantum effects in photosynthetic light harvesting and avian magnetoreception\nare also discussed. At last, we review recent proposals to realize quantum\nsuperposition, entanglement and state teleportation of microorganisms, such as\nviruses and bacteria.\n", "  Unconventional metallic states which do not support well defined\nsingle-particle excitations can arise near quantum phase transitions as strong\nquantum fluctuations of incipient order parameters prevent electrons from\nforming coherent quasiparticles. Although antiferromagnetic phase transitions\noccur commonly in correlated metals, understanding the nature of the strange\nmetal realized at the critical point in layered systems has been hampered by a\nlack of reliable theoretical methods that take into account strong quantum\nfluctuations. We present a non-perturbative solution to the low-energy theory\nfor the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal in two spatial dimensions.\nBeing a strongly coupled theory, it can still be solved reliably in the\nlow-energy limit as quantum fluctuations are organized by a new control\nparameter that emerges dynamically. We predict the exact critical exponents\nthat govern the universal scaling of physical observables at low temperatures.\n", "  Under the assumption that a UV theory does not display superluminal behavior,\nwe ask what constraints on superluminality are satisfied in the effective field\ntheory (EFT). We study two examples of effective theories: quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) coupled to gravity after the electron is integrated out,\nand the flat-space galileon. The first is realized in nature, the second is\nmore speculative, but they both exhibit apparent superluminality around\nnon-trivial backgrounds. In the QED case, we attempt, and fail, to find\nbackgrounds for which the superluminal signal advance can be made larger than\nthe putative resolving power of the EFT. In contrast, in the galileon case it\nis easy to find such backgrounds, indicating that if the UV completion of the\ngalileon is (sub)luminal, quantum corrections must become important at distance\nscales of order the Vainshtein radius of the background configuration, much\nlarger than the naive EFT strong coupling distance scale. Such corrections\nwould be reminiscent of the non-perturbative Schwarzschild scale quantum\neffects that are expected to resolve the black hole information problem.\nFinally, a byproduct of our analysis is a calculation of how perturbative\nquantum effects alter charged Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.\n", "  In this work, we report the fabrication of experimental setup for high\ntemperature thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$) measurement. It can characterize\nsamples with various dimensions and shapes. Steady state based axial heat flow\ntechnique is used for $\\kappa$ measurement. Heat loss is measured using\nparallel thermal conductance technique. Simple design, lightweight and small\nsize sample holder is developed by using a thin heater and limited components.\nLow heat loss value is achieved by using very low thermal conductive insulator\nblock with small cross sectional area. Power delivered to the heater is\nmeasured accurately by using 4-wire technique and for this, heater is developed\nwith 4-wire. This setup is validated by using $Bi_{0.36}Sb_{1.45}Te_3$,\npolycrystalline bismuth, gadolinium, and alumina samples. The data obtained for\nthese samples are found to be in good agreement with the reported data. The\nmaximum deviation of 6 \\% in the value $\\kappa$ are observed. This maximum\ndeviation is observed with the gadolinium sample. We also report the thermal\nconductivity of polycrystalline tellurium from 320 K to 550 K and the non\nmonotonous behavior of $\\kappa$ with temperature is observed.\n", "  The Chiral Soliton Lattice (CSL) is a state with a periodic array of\ntopological solitons that spontaneously breaks parity and translational\nsymmetries. Such a state is known to appear in chiral magnets. We show that CSL\nalso appears as a ground state of quantum chromodynamics at nonzero chemical\npotential in a magnetic field. By analyzing the fluctuations of the CSL, we\nfurthermore demonstrate that in strong but achievable magnetic fields, charged\npions undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results, based on a systematic\nlow-energy effective theory, are model-independent and fully analytic.\n", "  We study general class of small-field axion inflations which are the mixture\nof polynomial and sinusoidal functions suggested by the natural and axion\nmonodromy inflations. The axion decay constants leading to the successful axion\ninflations are severely constrained in order not to spoil the Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis and overproduce the isocurvature perturbation originating from\nthe QCD axion. We in turn find that the cosmologically favorable axion decay\nconstants are typically of order the grand unification scale or the string\nscale which is consistent with the prediction of closed string axions.\n", "  The reconstruction and calibration algorithms used to calculate missing\ntransverse momentum ($E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$) with the ATLAS detector exploit\nenergy deposits in the calorimeter and tracks reconstructed in the inner\ndetector as well as the muon spectrometer. Various strategies are used to\nsuppress effects arising from additional proton-proton interactions, called\npileup, concurrent with the hard-scatter processes. Tracking information is\nused to distinguish contributions from the pileup interactions using their\nvertex separation along the beam axis. The performance of the $E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm\nmiss}$ reconstruction algorithms, especially with respect to the amount of\npileup, is evaluated using data collected in proton-proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV during 2012, and results are shown for a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. The results\nof simulation modelling of $E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm miss}$ in events containing a $Z$\nboson decaying to two charged leptons (electrons or muons) or a $W$ boson\ndecaying to a charged lepton and a neutrino is compared to data. The acceptance\nfor different event topologies, with and without high transverse momentum\nneutrinos, is shown for a range of threshold criteria for $E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm\nmiss}$, and estimates of the systematic uncertainties in the $E_{\\rm T}^{\\rm\nmiss}$ measurements are presented.\n", "  In this thesis we present a new formalism to study linear and non-linear\nresponse in extended systems. Our approach is based on real-time solution of an\neffective Schr\\\"odinger equation. The coupling between electrons and external\nfield is described by means of Modern Theory of Polarization. Correlation\neffects are derived from Green's function theory. We show that the inclusion of\nlocal-field effects and electron-hole interaction is crucial to predict and\nreproduce second and third harmonic generation in low dimensional structures,\nwhere strong bound excitons are present. Finally in the last part we introduce\na real-time density functional approach suitable for infinite periodic crystals\nin which we work within the so-called length gauge and calculate the\npolarisation as a dynamical Berry's phase. This approach, in addition to the\nelectron density considers also the macroscopic polarisation as a main variable\nto correctly treat periodic crystals in presence of electric fields within a\ndensity functional framework.\n", "  Charge transport in nanostructures and thin films is fundamental to many\nphenomena and processes in science and technology, ranging from quantum effects\nand electronic correlations in mesoscopic physics, to integrated charge- or\nspin-based electronic circuits, to photoactive layers in energy research.\nDirect visualization of the charge flow in such structures is challenging due\nto their nanometer size and the itinerant nature of currents. In this work, we\ndemonstrate non-invasive magnetic imaging of current density in two-dimensional\nconductor networks including metallic nanowires and carbon nanotubes. Our\nsensor is the electronic spin of a diamond nitrogen-vacancy center attached to\na scanning tip. Using a differential measurement technique, we detect DC\ncurrents down to a few uA above a baseline current density of 2e4 A/cm2.\nReconstructed images have a spatial resolution of typically 50 nm, with a\nbest-effort value of 22 nm. Current density imaging offers a new route for\nstudying electronic transport and conductance variations in two-dimensional\nmaterials and devices, with many exciting applications in condensed matter\nphysics.\n", "  The revised International System of Units (SI), expected to be approved late\nin 2018, has implications for physics pedagogy; the ampere definition which\ndates from 1948 will be replaced by a definition that fixes the numerical value\nof the elementary charge, e, in coulombs. The kilogram definition which dates\nfrom 1889 will be replaced by a definition that fixes the numerical value of\nthe Planck constant, h, in joule seconds. Existing SI equations are completely\nunaffected. However, there will be a largely-negligible, but nevertheless\nnecessary, change to published numerical factors relating SI electrical units\nto their corresponding units in the Gaussian and other CGS systems of units.\nThe implications of the revised SI for electrical metrology are neatly\nillustrated by considering the interpretation of results obtained from a\ncurrent balance in the present SI and in the revised SI.\n", "  We show that a family of quantum authentication protocols introduced in\n[Barnum et al., FOCS 2002] can be used to construct a secure quantum channel\nand additionally recycle all of the secret key if the message is successfully\nauthenticated, and recycle part of the key if tampering is detected. We give a\nfull security proof that constructs the secure channel given only insecure\nnoisy channels and a shared secret key. We also prove that the number of\nrecycled key bits is optimal for this family of protocols, i.e., there exists\nan adversarial strategy to obtain all non-recycled bits. Previous works\nrecycled less key and only gave partial security proofs, since they did not\nconsider all possible distinguishers (environments) that may be used to\ndistinguish the real setting from the ideal secure quantum channel and secret\nkey resource.\n", "  We constrain the average halo ellipticity of ~2 600 galaxy groups from the\nGalaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, using the weak gravitational lensing\nsignal measured from the overlapping Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal. In order to relate that\nto a halo ellipticity, we have to adopt a model density profile. We derive new\nexpressions for the quadrupole moments of the shear field given an elliptical\nmodel surface mass density profile. Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12. This agrees well with results from cold-dark-matter-only simulations,\nwhich typically report values of e_h ~ 0.3. On larger scales, the lensing\nsignal around the BCGs does not trace the dark matter distribution well, and\nthe distribution of group satellites provides a better proxy for the halo's\norientation instead, leading to a 3--4 sigma detection of a non-zero halo\nellipticity at scales between 250 kpc and 750 kpc. Our results suggest that the\ndistribution of stars enclosed within a certain radius forms a good proxy for\nthe orientation of the dark matter within that radius, which has also been\nobserved in hydrodynamical simulations.\n", "  The development of fluid-structure interaction (FSI) software involves\ntrade-offs between ease of use, generality, performance, and cost. Typically\nthere are large learning curves when using low-level software to model the\ninteraction of an elastic structure immersed in a uniform density fluid. Many\nexisting codes are not publicly available, and the commercial software that\nexists usually requires expensive licenses and may not be as robust or allow\nthe necessary flexibility that in house codes can provide. We present an open\nsource immersed boundary software package, IB2d, with full implementations in\nboth MATLAB and Python, that is capable of running a vast range of biomechanics\nmodels and is accessible to scientists who have experience in high-level\nprogramming environments. IB2d contains multiple options for constructing\nmaterial properties of the fiber structure, as well as the advection-diffusion\nof a chemical gradient, muscle mechanics models, and artificial forcing to\ndrive boundaries with a preferred motion.\n", "  Reconstruction of the point spread function (PSF) is a critical process in\nweak lensing measurement. We develop a real-data based and galaxy-oriented\npipeline to compare the performances of various PSF reconstruction schemes.\nMaking use of a large amount of the CFHTLenS data, the performances of three\nclasses of interpolating schemes - polynomial, Kriging, and Shepard - are\nevaluated. We find that polynomial interpolations with optimal orders and\ndomains perform the best. We quantify the effect of the residual PSF\nreconstruction error on shear recovery in terms of the multiplicative and\nadditive biases, and their spatial correlations using the shear measurement\nmethod of Zhang et al. (2015). We find that the impact of PSF reconstruction\nuncertainty on the shear-shear correlation can be significantly reduced by\ncross correlating the shear estimators from different exposures. It takes only\n0.2 stars (SNR > 100) per square arcmin on each exposure to reach the best\nperformance of PSF interpolation, a requirement that is generally satisfied in\nthe CFHTlenS data.\n", "  Two and three point functions of composite operators are analysed with regard\nto (logarithmically) divergent contact terms. Using the renormalisation group\nof dimensional regularisation it is established that the divergences are\ngoverned by the anomalous dimensions of the operators and the leading\nUV-behaviour of the $1/\\epsilon$-coefficient. Explicit examples are given by\nthe $<G^2G^2>$-, $<\\Theta \\Theta>$-trace of the energy momentum tensor) and\n$<\\bar q q \\bar q q>$- correlators in QCD-like theories. The former two are\nconvergent when all orders are taken into account but divergent at each order\nin perturbation theory implying that the latter and the the $\\epsilon \\to 0$\nlimit do not generally commute. Finite correlation functions obey unsubtracted\ndispersion relations which is of importance when they are directly related to\nphysical observables. As a byproduct the $R^2$-anomaly is extended to NNLO\n($O(\\alpha^5)$) using a recent $<G^2G^2>$-computation.\n", "  We calculate the cross-sections for the radiative formation of bound states\nby dark matter whose interactions are described in the non-relativistic regime\nby a Yukawa potential. These cross-sections are important for cosmological and\nphenomenological studies of dark matter with long-range interactions, residing\nin a hidden sector, as well as for TeV-scale WIMP dark matter. We provide the\nleading-order contributions to the cross-sections for the dominant capture\nprocesses occurring via emission of a vector or a scalar boson. We offer a\ndetailed inspection of their features, including their velocity dependence\nwithin and outside the Coulomb regime, and their resonance structure. For pairs\nof annihilating particles, we compare bound-state formation with annihilation.\n", "  In present work, we try to understand the importance of effective Coulomb\ninteraction ($U_{ef}$) between localized electrons of V atom to understand the\ncomparative electronic behaviour of AV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (A=Zn, Cd and Mg)\ncompounds. The suitable values of $d$-linearization energy ($E_{d}$) of\nimpurity V atom for calculating the $U_{ef}$ for these compounds are found to\nbe $\\geq$44.89 eV above the Fermi level. Corresponding to these values of\n$E_{d}$, the self-consistently calculated values of effective $U_{LSDA}$\n($U_{PBEsol}$) for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ are\n$\\sim$5.73 ($\\sim$5.92), $\\sim$6.06 ($\\sim$6.22) and $\\sim$5.59 ($\\sim$5.71)\neV, respectively. The calculated values of $\\frac{t}{U_{ef}}$ ($t$ is the\ntransfer integral between neighbouring sites) increases with decreasing V-V\ndistance from CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ to MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ to ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and are\nfound to be consistent with experimentally reported band gap. The values of\n$\\frac{t}{U_{ef}}$ for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$\nare found to be $\\sim$0.023, $\\sim$0.020 and $\\sim$0.018, respectively. Hence,\nCdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ with small (large) $\\frac{t}{U_{ef}}$ (experimental band gap)\nas compared to ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ is found to be in\nlocalized-electron regime, while ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ are\nintermediate between localized and an itinerant-electron regime. The calculated\nvalues of lattice parameters $a_{LSDS}$ ($a_{PBEsol}$) are found to be\n$\\sim$1.7\\%, $\\sim$2.0\\% and $\\sim$2.4\\% ($\\sim$0.6\\%, $\\sim$0.7\\% and\n$\\sim$0.7\\%) smaller than $a_{exp}$ for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\nZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, respectively, which indicates that the PBEsol functional\npredicts the lattice parameters in good agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  Recent LHC results on the appearance of sub-leading flow modes in PbPb\ncollisions at 2.76~TeV, related to initial-state fluctuations, are analyzed and\ninterpreted within the HYDJET++ model. Using the newly introduced Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA) method applied to two-particle azimuthal correlations\nextracted from the model calculations, the leading and the sub-leading flow\nmodes are studied as a function of the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) over a\nwide centrality range. The leading modes of the elliptic ($v^{(1)}_{2}$) and\ntriangular ($v^{(1)}_{3}$) flow calculated within the HYDJET++ model reproduce\nrather well the $v_{2}\\{2\\}$ and $v_{3}\\{2\\}$ coefficients experimentally\nmeasured using the two-particle correlations. Within the $p_{T} \\le $~3~GeV/c\nrange where hydrodynamics dominates, the sub-leading flow effects are greatest\nat the highest $p_{T}$ of around 3~GeV/c. The sub-leading elliptic flow mode\n($v^{(2)}_{2}$), which corresponds to $n = 2$ harmonic, has a small non-zero\nvalue and slowly increases from central to peripheral collisions, while the\nsub-leading triangular flow mode ($v^{(2)}_{3}$), which corresponds to $n = 3$\nharmonic, is even smaller and does not depend on centrality. For $n = $~2, the\nrelative magnitude of the effect measured with respect to the leading flow mode\nshows a shallow minimum for semi-central collisions and increases for very\ncentral and for peripheral collisions. For $n = $~3 case, there is no\ncentrality dependence. The sub-leading flow mode results obtained from the\nHYDJET++ model are in a rather good agreement with the experimental\nmeasurements of the CMS Collaboration.\n", "  Theoretically, various physical properties of AV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ (A=Zn, Cd and\nMg) spinels have been extensively studied for last 15 years. Besides of this,\nno systematic comparative study has been done for these compounds, where the\nmaterial specific parameters are used. Here, we report the comparative\nelectronic behaviour of these spinels by using a combination of density\nfunctional theory and dynamical mean-field theory, where the self-consistent\ncalculated Coulomb interaction $U$ and Hund's coupling $J$ (determined by\nYukawa screening $\\lambda$) are used. The main features, such as insulating\nband gaps ($E_{g}$), degree of itinerancy of V 3$d$ electrons and position of\nlower Hubbard band are observed for these parameters in these spinels. The\ncalculated values of $E_{g}$ for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and\nMgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ are found to be $\\sim$0.9 eV, $\\sim$0.95 eV and $\\sim$1.15 eV,\nrespectively, where the values of $E_{g}$ are close to experiment for\nZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. The position of lower Hubbard band are\nobserved around $\\sim$-1.05 eV, $\\sim$-1.25 eV and $\\sim$-1.15 eV for\nZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, respectively, which\nare also in good agreement with the experimental data for ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. The\norder of average impurity hybridization function of V site are found to be\nZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$MgV$_{2}$O$_{4}$$>$CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$. Hence, the degree of\nlocalization of V 3$d$ electrons is largest for CdV$_{2}$O$_{4}$ and smallest\nfor ZnV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, which is in accordance with our earlier results. Hence,\npresent work shows the importance of material specific parameters to understand\nthe comparative electronic behaviour of these compounds.\n", "  Can collective quantum effects make a difference in a meaningful\nthermodynamic operation? Focusing on energy storage and batteries, we\ndemonstrate that quantum mechanics can lead to an enhancement in the amount of\nwork deposited per unit time, i.e., the charging power, when $N$ batteries are\ncharged collectively. We first derive analytic upper bounds for the collective\n\\emph{quantum advantage} in charging power for two choices of constraints on\nthe charging Hamiltonian. We then highlight the importance of entanglement by\nproving that the quantum advantage vanishes when the collective state of the\nbatteries is restricted to be in the separable ball. Finally, we provide an\nupper bound to the achievable quantum advantage when the interaction order is\nrestricted, i.e., at most $k$ batteries are interacting. Our result is a\nfundamental limit on the advantage offered by quantum technologies over their\nclassical counterparts as far as energy deposition is concerned.\n", "  The ground state of a pair of ultrastrongly coupled bosonic modes is\npredicted to be a two-mode squeezed vacuum. However, the corresponding quantum\ncorrelations are currently unobservable in condensed matter where such a\ncoupling can be reached, since it cannot be extracted from these systems. Here,\nwe show that superconducting circuits can be used to perform an analog\nsimulation of a system of two bosonic modes in regimes ranging from strong to\nultrastrong coupling. More importantly, our quantum simulation setup enables us\nto detect output excitations that are related to the ground-state properties of\nthe bosonic modes. We compute the emission spectra of this physical system and\nshow that the produced state presents single- and two-mode squeezing\nsimultaneously.\n", "  The meaning of local observables is poorly understood in gauge theories, not\nto speak of quantum gravity. As a step towards a better understanding we study\nasymptotic (infrared) transformation in local quantum physics. Our observables\nare smeared by test functions, at first vanishing at infinity. In this context\nwe show that the equations of motion can be seen as constraints, which generate\na group, the group of space and time dependent gauge transformations.This is\none of the main points of the paper. Infrared nontrivial effects are captured\nallowing test functions which do not vanish at infinity. These extended\noperators generate a larger group. The quotient of the two groups generate\nsuperselection sectors, which differentiate different infrared sectors. The BMS\ngroup changes the superselection sector, a result long known for its Lorentz\nsubgroup. It is hence spontaneously broken. Ward identities implied by the\ngauge invariance of the S-matrix generalize the standard results and lead to\ncharge conservation and low energy theorems. Their validity does not require\nLorentz invariance.\n", "  Spacetime nonmetricity can be studied experimentally through its couplings to\nfermions and photons. We use recent high-precision searches for Lorentz\nviolation to deduce first constraints involving the 40 independent nonmetricity\ncomponents down to levels of order $10^{-43}$ GeV.\n", "  Low-Reynolds-number polymer solutions exhibit a chaotic behaviour known as\n'elastic turbulence' when the Weissenberg number exceeds a critical value. The\ntwo-dimensional Oldroyd-B model is the simplest constitutive model that\nreproduces this phenomenon. To make a practical estimate of the resolution\nscale of the dynamics requires an assumption that an attractor of the Oldroyd-B\nmodel exists : numerical simulations show that the quantities on which this\nassumption is based are bounded. We estimate the Lyapunov dimension of this\nassumed attractor as a function of the Weissenberg number by combining a\nmathematical analysis of the model with direct numerical simulations.\n", "  We introduce a corrective function to compensate errors in contact area\ncomputations coming from mesh discretization. The correction is based on\ngeometrical arguments and requires only one additional quantity to be computed:\nthe length of contact/non-contact interfaces. The new technique enables us to\nevaluate accurately the true contact area using a coarse mesh for which the\nshortest wavelength in the surface spectrum reaches the grid size. The validity\nof the approach is demonstrated for surfaces with different fractal dimensions\nand different spectral content using a properly designed mesh convergence test.\nIn addition, we use a topology preserving smoothing technique to adjust the\nmorphology of contact clusters obtained with a coarse grid.\n", "  We study a two-orbital $t$-$J_1$-$J_2$ model, originally developed to\ndescribe iron-based superconductors at low energies, in the presence of bond\ndisorder (via next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$-bond dilution). By using the\nBogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we self-consistently calculate the local\npairing amplitudes and the corresponding density of states, which demonstrate a\nchange of dominant pairing symmetry from $s_\\pm$ wave to $d$ wave when\nincreasing disorder strength as long as $J_1\\lesssim J_2$. Moreover, the\ncombined pairing interaction and strong bond disorder lead to the formation of\n$s_\\pm$ wave \"islands\" with length scale of the superconducting coherence\nlength embedded in a $d$ wave \"sea.\" This picture is further complemented by\nthe disorder-averaged pair-pair correlation functions, distinct from the case\nwith potential disorder, where the \"sea\" is insulating. Due to this inevitable\nformation of spatial inhomogeneity, the superconducting $T_c$ determined by the\nsuperfluid density $\\rho_s(T)$ obviously deviates from the value predicted by\nthe conventional Abrikosov-Gorkov theory, where the pairing amplitudes are\nviewed as uniformly suppressed as the disorder increases.\n", "  The mean-field theory for disordered electron systems without interaction is\nwidely and successfully used to describe equilibrium properties of materials\nover the whole range of disorder strengths. However, it fails to take into\naccount the effects of quantum coherence and information of localization.\nVertex corrections due to multiple back-scatterings may drive the electrical\nconductivity to zero and make expansions around the mean field in strong\ndisorder problematic. Here, we present a method for the calculation of\ntwo-particle quantities which enable us to characterize the metal-insulator\ntransitions (MIT) in disordered electron systems by using the Typical Medium\nDynamical Cluster Approximation (TMDCA). We show how to include vertex\ncorrections and the information about the mobility edge to the typical\nmean-field theory. We successfully demonstrate the application of the developed\nmethod by showing that the conductivity formulated in this way properly\ncharacterizes the MIT in disordered systems.\n", "  Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), a ZrO2-Y2O3 solid solution that contains a\nlarge population of oxygen vacancies, is widely used in energy and industrial\napplications. Past computational studies correctly predicted the anion\ndiffusivity but not the cation diffusivity, which is important for material\nprocessing and stability. One of the challenges lies in identifying a plausible\nconfiguration akin to the ground state in a glassy landscape. This is unlikely\nto come from random sampling of even a very large sample space, but the odds\nare much improved by incorporating packing preferences revealed by a modest\nsized configurational library established from empirical potential\ncalculations. Ab initio calculations corroborated these preferences, which\nprove remarkably robust extending to the fifth cation-oxygen shell about 8\n{\\AA} away. Yet because of frustration there are still rampant violations of\npacking preferences and charge neutrality in the ground state, and the approach\ntoward it bears a close analogy to glass relaxations. Fast relaxations proceed\nby fast oxygen movement around cations, while slow relaxations require slow\ncation diffusion. The latter is necessarily cooperative because of strong\ncoupling imposed by the long-range packing preferences.\n", "  Cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia is widely used in industrial electrochemical\ndevices. While its fast oxygen ion diffusion is well understood, why cation\ndiffusion is much slower-its activation energy (~5 eV) is 10 times that of\nanion diffusion-remains a mystery. Indeed, all previous computational studies\npredicted more than 5 eV is needed for forming a cation defect, and another 5\neV for moving one. In contrast, our ab initio calculations have correctly\npredicted the experimentally observed cation diffusivity. We found Schottky\npairs are the dominant defects that provide cation vacancies, and their local\nenvironments and migrating path are dictated by packing preferences. As a\ncation exchanges position with a neighboring vacancy, it passes by an empty\ninterstitial site and severely displaces two oxygen neighbors with shortened\nZr-O distances. This causes a short-range repulsion against the migrating\ncation and a long-range disturbance of the surrounding, which explains why\ncation diffusion is relatively difficult. In comparison, cubic zirconia's\nmigrating oxygen only minimally disturbs neighboring Zr, which explains why it\nis a fast oxygen conductor.\n", "  We consider fluid dynamics of relativistic double explosion - when a point\nexplosion with energy $E_1$ is followed by a second explosion with energy $E_2$\nafter time $t_d$ (the second explosion could be in a form of a long lasting\nwind). The primary explosion creates a self-similar relativistic blast wave\npropagating with \\Lf\\ $\\Gamma_1(t)$. A sufficiently strong second explosion,\nwith total energy $E_2 \\geq 10^{-2} E_1$, creates a fast second shock in the\nexternal fluid previously shocked by the primary shock. At times longer than\nthe interval between the explosions $t_d$, yet short compared with the time\nwhen the second shock catches up the primary shock at $\\sim t_d \\Gamma_1^2$,\nthe structure of the second shock is approximately self-similar. Self-similar\nstructure of the second shock exist for the case of constant external density\n(in this case $\\Gamma_2 \\propto t^{-7/3}$), but not for the wind environment.\n  At early times the \\Lf\\ of the second shock may exceed that of the primary\nshock and may boost the synchrotron emission of locally accelerated electrons\ninto the Fermi LAT range.\n", "  The standard design method for conventional straight dipole magnets is\nimproved in this paper. The good field region is not symmetric with respect to\nthe magnet mechanical center, and its width is not enlarged to include the beam\nsagitta. The integrated field quality is obtained by integrating the field\nalong nominal beam paths. 2D and 3D design procedures of the improved design\nmethod are introduced, and two application examples of straight dipole magnets\nare presented. It is shown that the differences in integrated field quality\nbetween different field integration paths cannot be neglected. Compared with\nthe traditional design method of straight dipole magnets, the advantage of the\nimproved method is that the integrated field quality is accurate; the pole\nwidth, magnet dimension and weight of a straight dipole magnet can be reduced.\n", "  We performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy studies on a series of\nFeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$ monolayer films grown on SrTiO$_{3}$. The\nsuperconductivity of the films is robust and rather insensitive to the\nvariations of the band position and effective mass caused by the substitution\nof Se by Te. However, the band gap between the electron- and hole-like bands at\nthe Brillouin zone center decreases towards band inversion and parity exchange,\nwhich drive the system to a nontrivial topological state predicted by\ntheoretical calculations. Our results provide a clear experimental indication\nthat the FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$ monolayer materials are high-temperature connate\ntopological superconductors in which band topology and superconductivity are\nintegrated intrinsically.\n", "  Using holographic renormalization coupled with the\nCaffarelli/Silvestre\\cite{caffarelli} extension theorem, we calculate the\nprecise form of the boundary operator dual to a bulk scalar field rather than\njust its average value. We show that even in the presence of interactions in\nthe bulk, the boundary operator dual to a bulk scalar field is an anti-local\noperator, namely the fractional Laplacian. The propagator associated with such\noperators is of the general power-law (fixed by the dimension of the scalar\nfield) type indicative of the absence of particle-like excitations at the\nWilson-Fisher fixed point or the phenomenological unparticle construction.\nHolographic renormalization also allows us to show how radial quantization can\nbe extended to such non-local conformal operators.\n", "  Various phenomenological models presented over the years have hinted at the\npossible presence of strangelets, which are nuggets of Strange Quark Matter\n(SQM), in cosmic rays. One way to search for such rare events is through the\ndeployment of large area Nuclear Track Detector (NTD) arrays at high mountain\naltitudes. Before the deployment of any such array can begin, a detailed study\nof the radiation background is essential. Also a proper understanding of the\nresponse of detectors exposed to extreme weather conditions is necessary. With\nthat aim, pilot studies were carried out at various high altitude locations in\nIndia such as Darjeeling (2200 m a.m.s.l), Ooty (2200 m a.m.s.l) and Hanle\n(4500 m a.m.s.l). Small arrays of CR-39 as well as high threshold Polyethylene\nTerephthalate (PET) detectors were given open air exposures for periods ranging\nfrom three months to two years. The findings of such studies are reported in\nthis paper.\n", "  It is well known that static spherically symmetric spacetimes can admit\nfoliations by flat spacelike hypersurfaces, which are best described in terms\nof the Painlev\\`{e}--Gullstrand coordinates. The uniqueness and existence of\nsuch foliations were addressed earlier. In this paper, we prove, purely\ngeometrically, that any possible foliation of a static spherically symmetric\nspacetime by an arbitrary codimension-one spherical spacelike geometry, up to\ntime translation and rotation, is unique, and we find the algebraic condition\nunder which it exists. This leads us to what can be considered as the most\nnatural generalization of the Painlev\\`{e}--Gullstrand coordinate system for\nstatic spherically symmetric metrics, which, in turn, makes it easy to derive\ngeneric conclusions on foliation and to study specific cases as well as to\neasily reproduce previously obtained generalizations as special cases. In\nparticular, we note that the existence of foliation by flat hypersurfaces\nguarantees the existence of foliation by hypersurfaces whose Ricci curvature\ntensor is everywhere non-positive (constant negative curvature is a special\ncase). The study of uniqueness and the existence concurrently solves the\nquestion of embeddability of a spherical spacelike geometry in one-dimensional\nhigher static spherically symmetric spacetimes, and this produces known and new\nresults geometrically, without having to go through the momentum and\nHamiltonian constraints.\n", "  In this short note we consider the finite-dimensional distributions of sets\nof states generated by dispersing billiards with a random initial condition. We\nestablish a functional correlation bound on the distance between the\nfinite-dimensional distributions and corresponding product distributions. We\ndemonstrate the usefulness of the bound by showing that it implies several\nlimit theorems. The purpose of this note is to provide a tool facilitating the\nstudy of more general functionals of the billiard process.\n", "  Image simulation for scanning transmission electron microscopy at atomic\nresolution for samples with realistic dimensions can require very large\ncomputation times using existing simulation algorithms. We present a new\nalgorithm named PRISM that combines features of the two most commonly used\nalgorithms, the Bloch wave and multislice methods. PRISM uses a Fourier\ninterpolation factor $f$ that has typical values of 4-20 for atomic resolution\nsimulations. We show that in many cases PRISM can provide a speedup that scales\nwith $f^4$ compared to multislice simulations, with a negligible loss of\naccuracy. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with large-scale\nscanning transmission electron microscopy image simulations of a crystalline\nnanoparticle on an amorphous carbon substrate.\n", "  We study the interface physics of bipartite magnetic materials deposited on a\ntopological insulator. This comprises antiferromagnets as well as ferrimagnets\nand ferromagnets with multiple magnetic moments per unit cell. If an energy gap\nis induced in the Dirac states on the topological surface, a topological\nmagnetoelectric effect has been predicted. Here, we show that this effect can\nact in opposite directions on the two components of the magnet in certain\nparameter regions. Consequently, an electric field will mainly generate a\nstaggered field rather than a net magnetization in the plane. This is relevant\nfor the current attempts to detect the magnetoelectric effect experimentally,\nas well as for possible applications. We take a field-theoretic approach that\nincludes the quantum fluctuations of both the Dirac fermions on the topological\nsurface as well as the fermions in the surface layer of the magnet in an\nanalytically solvable model. The effective Lagrangian and the Landau-Lifshitz\nequation describing the interfacial magnetization dynamics are derived.\n", "  A generic distinct mechanism for the emergence of spatially localized states\nembedded in an oscillatory background is demonstrated by using 2:1 frequency\nlocking oscillatory system. The localization is of Turing type and appears in\ntwo space dimensions as a comb-like state in either $\\pi$ phase shifted Hopf\noscillations or inside a spiral core. Specifically, the localized states appear\nin absence of the well known flip-flop dynamics (associated with collapsed\nhomoclinic snaking) that is known to arise in the vicinity of Hopf-Turing\nbifurcation in one space dimension. Derivation and analysis of three\nHopf-Turing amplitude equations in two space dimensions reveals a local\ndynamics pinning mechanism for Hopf fronts, which in turn allows the emergence\nof perpendicular (to the Hopf front) Turing states. The results are shown to\nagree well with the comb-like core size that forms inside spiral waves. In the\ncontext of 2:1 resonance, these localized states form outside the 2:1 resonance\nregion and thus extend the frequency locking domain for spatially extended\nmedia, such as periodically driven Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reactions.\nImplications to chlorite-iodide-malonic-acid and shaken granular media are also\naddressed.\n", "  In this article we provide the Henon-Heiles system defined on\nLie-algebraically deformed nonrelativistic space-time with the commutator of\ntwo spatial directions proportional to time. Particularly, we demonstrate that\nin such a model the total energy is not conserved and for this reason the role\nof control parameter is taken by the initial energy value $E_{0,{\\rm tot}} =\nE_{{\\rm tot}}(t=0)$. Besides, we show that in contrast with the commutative\ncase, for chosen values of deformation parameter $\\kappa$, there appears chaos\nin the system for initial total energies $E_{0,{\\rm tot}}$ below the threshold\n$E_{0,{\\rm th}} = 1/6$.\n", "  A measurement of the inclusive $pp\\to t\\bar{t}+X$ production cross section in\nthe $\\tau+{\\rm jets}$ final state using only the hadronic decays of the $\\tau$\nlepton is presented. The measurement is performed using 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton-proton collision data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The\ncross section is measured via a counting experiment by imposing a set of\nselection criteria on the identification and kinematic variables of the\nreconstructed particles and jets, and on event kinematic variables and\ncharacteristics. The production cross section is measured to be\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}= 239 \\pm 29$ pb, which is in agreement with the measurements\nin other final states and the theoretical predictions at this center-of-mass\nenergy.\n", "  The chiral optical Tamm state (COTS) is a special localized state at the\ninterface of a handedness-preserving mirror and a structurally chiral medium\nsuch as a cholesteric liquid crystal or a chiral sculptured thin film. The\nspectral behavior of COTS, observed as reflection resonances, is described by\nthe temporal coupled-mode theory. Mode coupling is different for two circular\nlight polarizations because COTS has a helix structure replicating that of the\ncholesteric. The mode coupling for co-handed circularly polarized light\nexponentially attenuates with the cholesteric layer thickness since the COTS\nfrequency falls into the stop band. Cross-handed circularly polarized light\nfreely goes through the cholesteric layer and can excite COTS when reflected\nfrom the handedness-preserving mirror. The coupling in this case is\nproportional to anisotropy of the cholesteric and theoretically it is only\nanisotropy of magnetic permittivity that can ultimately cancel this coupling.\nThese two couplings being equal results in a polarization crossover (the\nKopp--Genack effect) for which a linear polarization is optimal to excite COTS.\nThe corresponding cholesteric thickness and scattering matrix for COTS are\ngenerally described by simple expressions.\n", "  The erasure of a bit of information encoded in a physical system is an\nirreversible operation bound to dissipate an amount of energy $Q = k_\\text{B}\nT\\ln 2$. As a result, work $W \\geq Q$ has to be applied to the physical system\nto restore the erased information content. This limit, called Landauer limit,\nsets a minimal energy dissipation inherent to any classical computation. In the\npursuit of the fastest and most efficient means of computation, the ultimate\nchallenge is to produce a memory device executing an operation as close to this\nlimit in the shortest time possible. Here, we use a crystal of molecular\nnanomagnets as a spin-memory device and measure the work needed to carry out a\nstorage operation. Exploiting a form of quantum annealing, we border the\nLandauer limit while preserving fast operation. Owing to the tunable and fast\ndynamics of this process, the performance of our device in terms of energy-time\ncost is orders of magnitude better than existing memory devices to date. This\nresult suggests a way to enhance classical computations by using quantum\nprocesses.\n", "  Ionization of acetylene by linearly-polarized, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser\npulses is modelled using time-dependent density functional theory. Several\nlaser wavelengths are considered including one that produces direct ionization\nto the first excited cationic state while another excites the molecules to a\nRydberg series incorporating an autoionizing state. We show that for the\nwavelengths and intensities considered, ionization is greatest whenever the\nmolecule is aligned along the laser polarization direction. By considering high\nharmonic generation we show that populating excited states can lead to a large\nenhancement in the harmonic yield. Lastly, angularly-resolved photoelectron\nspectra are calculated which show how the energy profile of the emitted\nelectrons significantly changes in the presence of these excited states.\n", "  An optically levitated nonspherical nanoparticle can exhibit both librational\nand translational vibrations due to orientational and translational\nconfinements of the optical tweezer, respectively. Usually, the frequency of\nits librational mode in a linearly-polarized optical tweezer is much larger\nthan the frequency of its translational mode. Because of the frequency\nmismatch, the intrinsic coupling between librational and translational modes is\nvery weak in vacuum. Here we propose a scheme to couple its librational and\ncenter-of-mass modes with an optical cavity mode. By adiabatically eliminating\nthe cavity mode, the beam splitter Hamiltonian between librational and\ncenter-of-mass modes can be realized. We find that high-fidelity quantum state\ntransfer between the librational and translational modes can be achieved with\npractical parameters. Our work may find applications in sympathetic cooling of\nmultiple modes and quantum information processing.\n", "  The compact and, with 4.3+-0.3 million solar masses, very massive object\nlocated at the center of the Milky Way is currently the very best candidate for\na supermassive black hole (SMBH) in our immediate vicinity. The strongest\nevidence for this is provided by measurements of stellar orbits, variable X-ray\nemission, and strongly variable polarized near-infrared emission from the\nlocation of the radio source Sagittarius~A* (SgrA*) in the middle of the\ncentral stellar cluster. If SgrA* is indeed a SMBH it will, in projection onto\nthe sky, have the largest event horizon and will certainly be the first and\nmost important target of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Very Long Baseline\nInterferometry (VLBI) observations currently being prepared. These observations\nin combination with the infrared interferometry experiment GRAVITY at the Very\nLarge Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) and other experiments across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum might yield proof for the presence of a black hole at\nthe center of the Milky Way. It is, however, unclear when the ever mounting\nevidence for SgrA* being associated with a SMBH will suffice as a convincing\nproof. Additional compelling evidence may come from future gravitational wave\nobservatories. This manuscript reviews the observational facts, theoretical\ngrounds and conceptual aspects for the case of SgrA* being a black hole. We\ntreat theory and observations in the framework of the philosophical discussions\nabout \"(Anti)Realism and Underdetermination\", as this line of arguments allows\nus to describe the situation in observational astrophysics with respect to\nsupermassive black holes. Questions concerning the existence of supermassive\nblack holes and in particular SgrA* are discussed using causation as an\nindispensable element. We show that the results of our investigation are\nconvincingly mapped out by this combination of concepts.\n", "  Within the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) approach electrolytes in contact with\nplanar, spherical, and cylindrical electrodes are analyzed systematically. The\ndependences of their capacitance $C$ on the surface charge density $\\sigma$ and\nthe ionic strength $I$ are examined as function of the wall curvature. The\nsurface charge density has a strong effect on the capacitance for small\ncurvatures whereas for large curvatures the behavior becomes independent of\n$\\sigma$. An expansion for small curvatures gives rise to capacitance\ncoefficients which depend only on a single parameter, allowing for a convenient\nanalysis. The universal behavior at large curvatures can be captured by an\nanalytic expression.\n", "  Density functional theory is used to describe electrolyte solutions in\ncontact with electrodes of planar or spherical shape. For the electrolyte\nsolutions we consider the so-called civilized model, in which all species\npresent are treated on equal footing. This allows us to discuss the features of\nthe electric double layer in terms of the differential capacitance. The model\nprovides insight into the microscopic structure of the electric double layer,\nwhich goes beyond the mesoscopic approach studied in the accompanying paper.\nThis enables us to judge the relevance of microscopic details, such as the\nradii of the particles forming the electrolyte solutions or the dipolar\ncharacter of the solvent particles, and to compare the predictions of various\nmodels. Similar to the preceding paper, a general behavior is observed for\nsmall radii of the electrode in that in this limit the results become\nindependent of the surface charge density and of the particle radii. However,\nfor large electrode radii non-trivial behaviors are observed. Especially the\nparticle radii and the surface charge density strongly influence the\ncapacitance. From the comparison with the Poisson-Boltzmann approach it becomes\napparent that the shape of the electrode determines whether the microscopic\ndetails of the full civilized model have to be taken into account or whether\nalready simpler models yield acceptable predictions.\n", "  In this study, main parameters of Super proton-proton Collider (SppC) based\nlepton-proton colliders are estimated. For electron beam parameters, highest\nenergy International Linear Collider (ILC) and Plasma Wake Field\nAccelerator-Linear Collider (PWFA-LC) options are taken into account. For muon\nbeams, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV center of mass energy Muon Collider parameters are\nused. In addition, ultimate $\\mu$p collider which assumes construction of\nadditional 50 TeV muon ring in the SppC tunnel is considered as well. It is\nshown that $L_{ep}$ $\\sim$ $10^{32}$ $cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ can be achieved with\nmoderate upgrade of the SppC proton beam parameters. Physics search potential\nof proposed lepton-proton colliders is illustrated by considering small Bjorken\nx region as an example of SM physics and resonant production of color octet\nleptons as an example of BSM physics.\n", "  Understanding the composition of raw materials that formed the Earth is a\ncrucial step towards understanding the formation of terrestrial planets and\ntheir bulk composition. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in\nterrestrial planets and, therefore, is a key element with which to trace\nplanetary composition. However, in order to use Ca isotopes as a tracer of\nEarth's accretion history, it is first necessary to understand the isotopic\nbehavior of Ca during the earliest stages of planetary formation. Chondrites\nare some of the oldest materials of the Solar System, and the study of their\nisotopic composition enables understanding of how and in what conditions the\nSolar System formed. Here we present Ca isotope data for a suite of bulk\nchondrites as well as Allende (CV) chondrules. We show that most groups of\ncarbonaceous chondrites (CV, CI, CR and CM) are significantly enriched in the\nlighter Ca isotopes ($\\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +0.1 to +0.93 permill) compared with\nbulk silicate Earth ($\\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +1.05 $\\pm$ 0.04 permill, Huang et\nal., 2010) or Mars, while enstatite chondrites are indistinguishable from Earth\nin Ca isotope composition ($\\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +0.91 to +1.06 permill).\nChondrules from Allende are enriched in the heavier isotopes of Ca compared to\nthe bulk and the matrix of the meteorite ($\\delta^{44/40}Ca$ = +1.00 to +1.21\npermill). This implies that Earth and Mars have Ca isotope compositions that\nare distinct from most carbonaceous chondrites but that may be like chondrules.\nThis Ca isotopic similarity between Earth, Mars, and chondrules is permissive\nof recent dynamical models of planetary formation that propose a chondrule-rich\naccretion model for planetary embryos.\n", "  We argue that the phenomenologically inferred ratio of shear viscosity to\nentropy density of the quark-gluon plasma, $\\eta/\\s < 0.5$ near the\ndeconfinement temperature $T_c$, can be understood from perturbative QCD. To\nrebut the widespread, opposite view we first show that, and why, the existing\nleading order result in (fixed) coupling should not be further expanded in\nlogarithms. Emphasizing then that the resummation mandatory for screening also\nsettles the often neglected question of scale setting for the running coupling,\nwe establish a temperature dependence of $\\eta/\\s$ which agrees well with\nconstraints from hydrodynamics.\n", "  One of the main questions of research on quantum many-body systems following\nunitary out of equilibrium dynamics is to find out how local expectation values\nequilibrate in time. For non-interacting models, this question is rather well\nunderstood. However, the best known bounds for general quantum systems are\nvastly crude, scaling unfavorable with the system size. Nevertheless, empirical\nand numerical evidence suggests that for generic interacting many-body systems,\ngeneric local observables, and sufficiently well-behaved states, the\nequilibration time does not depend strongly on the system size, but only the\nprecision with which this occurs does. In this discussion paper, we aim at\ngiving very simple and plausible arguments for why this happens. While our\ndiscussion does not yield rigorous results about equilibration time scales, we\nbelieve that it helps to clarify the essential underlying mechanisms, the\nintuition and important figure of merits behind equilibration. We then connect\nour arguments to common assumptions and numerical results in the field of\nequilibration and thermalization of closed quantum systems, such as the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis as well as rigorous results on interacting\nquantum many-body systems. Finally, we complement our discussions with\nnumerical results - both in the case of examples and counter-examples of\nequilibrating systems.\n", "  We present three-dimensional simulations of a protoplanetary disk subject to\nthe effect of a nearby (0.3pc distant) supernova, using a time-dependent flow\nfrom a one dimensional numerical model of the supernova remnant (SNR), in\naddition to constant peak ram pressure simulations. Simulations are performed\nfor a variety of disk masses and inclination angles. We find disk mass-loss\nrates that are typically 1e-7 to 1e-6 Msol/yr (but peak near 1e-5 Msol/yr\nduring the \"instantaneous\" stripping phase) and are sustained for around 200\nyr. Inclination angle has little effect on the mass loss unless the disk is\nclose to edge-on. Inclined disks also strip asymmetrically with the trailing\nedge ablating more easily. Since the interaction lasts less than one outer\nrotation period, there is not enough time for the disk to restore its symmetry,\nleaving the disk asymmetrical after the flow has passed. Of the low-mass disks\nconsidered, only the edge-on disk is able to survive interaction with the SNR\n(with 50% of its initial mass remaining). At the end of the simulations, disks\nthat survive contain fractional masses of SN material up to 5e-6. This is too\nlow to explain the abundance of short-lived radionuclides in the early solar\nsystem, but a larger disk and the inclusion of radiative cooling might allow\nthe disk to capture a higher fraction of SN material.\n", "  We introduce a methodology to test models with spatial variations of the\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$, based on the calculation of the angular power\nspectrum of these measurements. This methodology enables comparisons of\nobservations and theoretical models through their predictions on the statistics\nof the $\\alpha$ variation. Here we apply it to the case of symmetron models. We\nfind no indications of deviations from the standard behavior, with current data\nproviding an upper limit to the strength of the symmetron coupling to gravity\n($\\log{\\beta^2}<-0.9$) when this is the only free parameter, and not able to\nconstrain the model when also the symmetry breaking scale factor $a_{SSB}$ is\nfree to vary.\n", "  The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has now operated in space for 7\nyears and returned nearly continuous observations that have led to scientific\ndiscoveries and reshaped our entire understanding of the outer heliosphere and\nits interaction with the local interstellar medium. Here we extend prior work,\nadding the 2014-2015 data for the first time, and examine, validate, initially\nanalyze, and provide a complete 7-year set of Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA)\nobservations from ~0.1 to 6 keV. The data, maps, and documentation provided\nhere represent the 10th major release of IBEX data and include improvements to\nvarious prior corrections to provide the citable reference for the current\nversion of IBEX data. We are now able to study time variations in the outer\nheliosphere and interstellar interaction over more than half a solar cycle. We\nfind that the Ribbon has evolved differently than the globally distributed flux\n(GDF), with a leveling off and partial recovery of ENAs from the GDF, owing to\nsolar wind output flattening and recovery. The Ribbon has now also lost its\nlatitudinal ordering, which reflects the breakdown of solar minimum solar wind\nconditions and exhibits a greater time delay than for the surrounding GDF.\nTogether, the IBEX observations strongly support a secondary ENA source for the\nRibbon, and we suggest that this be adopted as the nominal explanation of the\nRibbon going forward.\n", "  This paper discusses how to build a time scale with an\nintermittently-operated optical clock. In particular, it gives suggestions on\nhow long and how often to run an optical clock. It also explores the benefits\nof having an optical clock in a time scale, by comparing with the current\nUTC(NIST) performance and the time scale with a continuously-operated Cs\nfountain.\n", "  We review a new implementation of Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) in\nwhich the dissipation signal of frequency modulation atomic force microscopy\n(FM-AFM) is used for dc bias voltage feedback (D-KPFM). The dissipation arises\nfrom an oscillating electrostatic force that is coherent with the tip\noscillation, which is caused by applying the ac voltage between the tip and\nsample. The magnitude of the externally induced dissipation is found to be\nproportional to the effective dc bias voltage, which is the difference between\nthe applied dc voltage and the contact potential difference. Two different\nimplementations of D-KPFM are presented. In the first implementation, the\nfrequency of the applied ac voltage, $f_\\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be the same\nas the tip oscillation ($f_\\mathrm{el} = f_\\mathrm{m}$: $1\\omega$D-KPFM). In\nthe second one, the ac voltage frequency, $f_\\mathrm{el}$, is chosen to be\ntwice the tip oscillation frequency ($f_\\mathrm{el}= 2 f_\\mathrm{m}$:\n$2\\omega$D-KPFM). In $1\\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional to the\nelectrostatic force, which enables the use of a small ac voltage amplitude even\ndown to $\\approx 10$\\,mV. In $2\\omega$D-KPFM, the dissipation is proportional\nto the electrostatic force gradient, which results in the same potential\ncontrast as that obtained by FM-KPFM. D-KPFM features a simple implementation\nwith no lock-in amplifier and faster scanning as it requires no low frequency\nmodulation. The use of a small ac voltage amplitude in $1\\omega$D-KPFM is of\ngreat importance in characterizing of technically relevant materials in which\ntheir electrical properties can be disturbed by the applied electric field.\n$2\\omega$D-KPFM is useful when more accurate potential measurement is required.\nThe operations in $1\\omega$ and $2\\omega$D-KPFM can be switched easily to take\nadvantage of both features at the same location on a sample.\n", "  Enabled by the addition of a TOF detector system in 2010, the first phase of\nthe Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) at RHIC allows STAR to conduct an unprecedented\nenergy-dependent study of dielectron production within a homogeneous\nexperimental environment, and hence close the wide gap in the QCD phase diagram\nbetween SPS and top RHIC energies. This thesis concentrates on the\nunderstanding of the LMR enhancement regarding its $M_{ee}$, $p_{T}$ and energy\ndependence. It studies dielectron production in Au+Au collisions at beam\nenergies of 19.6, 27, 39, and 62.4 GeV with sufficient statistics. In\nconjunction with the published STAR results at top RHIC energy, this thesis\npresents results on the first comprehensive energy-dependent study of\ndielectron production.\n  The comparison of $M_{ee}$- and $p_{T}$-spectra with cocktail simulations of\nhadronic sources reveals a sizeable and steadily increasing excess yield in the\nLMR at all beam energies. The scenario of broadened in-medium $\\rho$ spectral\nfunctions proves to not only serve well as dominating underlying source but\nalso to be universal in nature since it quantitatively and qualitatively\nexplains the LMR enhancements from SPS to top RHIC energies. It shows that most\nof the enhancement is governed by interactions of the $\\rho$ meson with thermal\nresonance excitations in the late(r)-stage hot and dense hadronic phase. This\nconclusion is supported by the energy-dependent measurement of integrated LMR\nexcess yields and enhancement factors. The former do not exhibit a strong\ndependence on beam energy as expected from the approximately constant total\nbaryon density above 20 GeV, and the latter show agreement with the CERES\nmeasurement at SPS energy. The consistency in excess yields and agreement with\nmodel calculations over the wide RHIC energy regime makes a strong case for LMR\nenhancements on the order of a factor 2-3.\n", "  Feynman diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory have as their underlying structure\n4-regular graphs. In particular, any 4-point $\\phi^4$ graph can be uniquely\nderived from a 4-regular graph by deleting a vertex. The Feynman period is a\nsimplified version of the Feynman integral, and is of special interest, as it\nmaintains much of the important number theoretic information from the Feynman\nintegral. It is also of structural interest, as it is known to be preserved by\na number of graph theoretic operations. In particular, the vertex deleted in\nconstructing the 4-point graph does not affect the Feynman period, and it is\ninvariant under planar duality and the Schnetz twist, an operation that\nredirects edges incident to a 4-vertex cut. Further, a 4-regular graph may be\nproduced by a 3-sum operation on triangles in two 4-regular graphs. The Feynman\nperiod of this graph with a vertex deleted is equal to the product of the\nFeynman periods of the two smaller graphs with one vertex deleted each. These\noperations currently explain all known instances of non-isomorphic 4-point\n$\\phi^4$ graphs with equal periods.\n  With this in mind, other graph invariants that are preserved by these\noperations for 4-point $\\phi^4$ graphs are of interest, as they may provide\ninsight into the Feynman period. In this thesis the extended graph permanent is\nintroduced; an infinite sequence of residues from prime order finite fields. It\nis shown that this sequence is preserved by these three operations, and has a\nproduct property. Additionally, computational techniques will be established,\nand an alternate interpretation will be presented as the point count of a novel\ngraph polynomial.\n  Further, the previously existing $c_2$ invariant and Hepp bound are examined,\ntwo graph invariants that are conjectured to be preserved by these graph\noperations. A combinatorial approach to the $c_2$ invariant is introduced.\n", "  An overview of the most important progresses in charm physics since the last\nCKM Workshop (2014) is presented. Due emphasis is given to the experimental\nmeasurements directly related to the CKM matrix.\n", "  We have compiled a comprehensive library of all X-ray observations of\nMagellanic pulsars carried out by {\\it XMM-Newton}, {\\it Chandra}, and {\\it\nRXTE} in the period 1997-2014. In this work, we use the data from 53 high-mass\nBe/X-ray binaries in the Small Magellanic Cloud to demonstrate that the\ndistribution of spin-period derivatives vs. spin periods of spinning-down\npulsars is not at all different than that of the accreting spinning-up pulsars.\nThe inescapable conclusion is that the up and down samples were drawn from the\nsame continuous parent population, therefore Be/X-ray pulsars that are spinning\ndown over periods spanning 18 years are in fact accreting from retrograde\ndisks. The presence of prograde and retrograde disks in roughly equal numbers\nsupports a new evolutionary scenario for Be/X-ray pulsars in their spin\nperiod-period derivative diagram.\n", "  Even the quantum simulation of simple molecules such as Fe$_2$S$_2$ requires\nmore than 10$^6$ qubits. In order to assess such a multimillion scale of\nidentical qubits and control lines, the silicon platform seems to be one of the\nmost indicated routes as it provides the capability of nanometric, serial and\nindustrial quality fabrication. The maximum amount of quantum information per\nunit surface and the consequent space constraints on qubit operations are key\nparameters towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing (QIP) with Si\nqubits. Such maximum density of quantum information is expressed for the\ncompact exchange-only Si double quantum dot qubit architecture as a function of\nthe CMOS technology node. The size scale optimizing both physical qubit\noperation time and quantum error correction (QEC) requirements is assessed by\nreviewing the physical and technological constraints. We determine the workable\noperation frequency range of a Si-CMOS quantum processor to be within 1 and 100\nGHz, which limits its feasibility only to the most advanced nodes. The\ncompatibility with classical control circuitry is discussed, focusing on the\ncryogenic CMOS operation required to bring the classical controller as close as\npossible to the quantum processor and to enable interfacing thousands of qubits\non the same chip. The operation time range prospected for cryogenic control\nelectronics is found to be compatible with the qubit operation time. By\ncombining the forecast of technology development with operation time and\nclassical circuitry constraints, we derive a maximum quantum information\ndensity for logical qubits of 2.8 and 4 Mqb/cm$^2$ for the 10-nm and 7-nm\ntechnology nodes respectively for the Steane code. The density is one and two\norders of magnitude less for surface and concatenated codes respectively. Such\nvalues provide a benchmark for the development of Si-based fault tolerant QIP.\n", "  We consider q-deformations of Witt rings, based on geometric operations on\nzeta functions of motives over finite fields, and we use these deformations to\nconstruct q-analogs of the Bost-Connes quantum statistical mechanical system.\nWe show that the q-deformations obtained in this way can be related to Habiro\nring constructions of analytic functions over the field with one element and to\ncategorifications of Bost-Connes systems.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are emerging as promising\ntwo-dimensional (2d) semiconductors for optoelectronic and flexible devices.\nHowever, a microscopic explanation of their photophysics -- of pivotal\nimportance for the understanding and optimization of device operation -- is\nstill lacking. Here we use femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, with\npump pulse tunability and broadband probing, to monitor the relaxation dynamics\nof single-layer MoS2 over the entire visible range, upon photoexcitation of\ndifferent excitonic transitions. We find that, irrespective of excitation\nphoton energy, the transient absorption spectrum shows the simultaneous\nbleaching of all excitonic transitions and corresponding red-shifted\nphotoinduced absorption bands. First-principle modeling of the ultrafast\noptical response reveals that a transient bandgap renormalization, caused by\nthe presence of photo-excited carriers, is primarily responsible for the\nobserved features. Our results demonstrate the strong impact of many-body\neffects in the transient optical response of TMDs even in the\nlow-excitation-density regime.\n", "  Surface-assisted polymerization of molecular monomers into extended chains\ncan be used as the seed of graphene nanoribbon (GNR) formation, resulting from\na subsequent cyclo-dehydrogenation process. By means of valence-band\nphotoemission and ab-initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we\ninvestigate the evolution of molecular states from monomer\n10,10'-dibromo-9,9'bianthracene (DBBA) precursors to polyanthryl polymers, and\neventually to GNRs, as driven by the Au(110) surface. The molecular orbitals\nand the energy level alignment at the metal-organic interface are studied in\ndepth for the DBBA precursors deposited at room temperature. On this basis, we\ncan identify a spectral fingerprint of C-Au interaction in both DBBA\nsingle-layer and polymerized chains obtained upon heating. Furthermore, DFT\ncalculations help us evidencing that GNRs interact more strongly than DBBA and\npolyanthryl with the Au(110) substrate, as a result of their flatter\nconformation.\n", "  A novel crystal configuration of sandwiched S-Mo-Se structure (Janus SMoSe)\nat the monolayer limit has been synthesized and carefully characterized in this\nwork. By controlled sulfurization of monolayer MoSe2 the top layer of selenium\natoms are substituted by sulfur atoms while the bottom selenium layer remains\nintact. The peculiar structure of this new material is systematically\ninvestigated by Raman, photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\nand confirmed by transmission-electron microscopy and time-of-flight secondary\nion mass spectrometry. Density-functional theory calculations are performed to\nbetter understand the Raman vibration modes and electronic structures of the\nJanus SMoSe monolayer, which are found to correlate well with corresponding\nexperimental results. Finally, high basal plane hydrogen evolution reaction\n(HER) activity is discovered for the Janus monolayer and DFT calculation\nimplies that the activity originates from the synergistic effect of the\nintrinsic defects and structural strain inherent in the Janus structure.\n", "  We report a wavelength-tunable Q-switched mode-locked fiber laser based on a\ncompact optical tuning device, which is fabricated by coating single-layer\ngraphene on the surface of micro-fiber Bragg grating (MFBG). Based on\nthermal-optical effect through evanescent interaction between graphene and\nMFBG, the center wavelength of MFBG can be accurately controlled by adjusting\npower of an external laser. By inserting the fabricated device into a compact\nfiber laser cavity mode-locked by single-wall carbon nanotubes, stable\nQ-switched mode-locked pulse is generated. Experimental results show that the\nwavelength can be precisely optical-tuned from 1550.1 nm to 1551.9 nm with a\nlinear sensitivity of 6.3 pm/mW. Such an optical-controlled wavelength-tunable\nQ-switched mode-locked fiber laser may find potential applications in\nall-optical computing, all-optical logic gating and generation of microwave\nsource.\n", "  The nuclear symmetry energy is defined by the second derivative of the energy\nper nucleon with respect to the proton-neutron asymmetry, and is sometimes\napproximated by the energy difference between the neutron matter and the\nsymmetric matter. Accuracy of this approximation is assessed analytically and\nnumerically, within the Hartree-Fock theory using effective interactions. By\ndecomposing the nuclear-matter energy, the relative error of each term is\nexpressed analytically; it is constant or is a single-variable function\ndetermined by the function type. The full errors are evaluated for several\neffective interactions, by inserting values of the parameters. Although the\nerrors stay within $10\\%$ up to twice of the normal density irrespective of the\ninteractions, at higher densities accuracy of the approximation significantly\ndepends on the interactions.\n", "  Anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_{\\mu}=(g_{\\mu}-2)/2$, is one of the\nmost precisely measured quantities in particle physics and it provides a\nstringent test of the Standard Model. The planned improvements of the\nexperimental precision at Fermilab and at J-PARC propel further reduction of\nthe theoretical uncertainty of $a_{\\mu}$. The hope is that the efforts on both\nsides will help resolve the current discrepancy between the experimental\nmeasurement of $a_{\\mu}$ and its theoretical prediction, and potentially gain\ninsight into new physics. The dominant sources of the uncertainty in the\ntheoretical prediction of $a_{\\mu}$ are the errors of the hadronic\ncontributions. I will discuss recent progress on determination of hadronic\ncontributions to $a_{\\mu}$ from lattice calculations.\n", "  We investigate which three dimensional near-horizon metrics $g_{NH}$ admit a\ncompatible 1-form $X$ such that $(X, [g_{NH}])$ defines an Einstein-Weyl\nstructure. We find explicit examples and see that some of the solutions give\nrise to Einstein-Weyl structures of dispersionless KP type and dispersionless\nHirota (aka hyperCR) type.\n", "  We show that transparent dielectrics with strong optical anisotropy support a\nnew class of electromagnetic waves that combine the properties of propagating\nand evanescent fields. These \"ghost waves\" are created in tangent bifurcations\nthat \"annihilate\" pairs of positive- and negative-index modes, and represent\nthe optical analogue of the \"ghost orbits\" in the quantum theory of\nnon-integrable dynamical systems. Similarly to the regular evanescent fields,\nghost waves support high transverse wavenumbers, but in addition to the\nexponential decay show oscillatory behavior in the direction of propagation.\nGhost waves can be resonantly coupled to the incident evanescent waves, which\nthen grow exponentially through the anisotropic media - as in the case of\nnegative index materials.As ghost waves are supported by transparent dielectric\nmedia, they are free from the \"curse\" of material loss that is inherent to\nconventional negative index composites.\n", "  In this paper we use Morawetz estimates with geometric energy estimates -the\nso-called vector field method- to prove decay results for the Maxwell field in\nthe static exterior region of the Reissner-Nordstr{\\o}m-de Sitter black hole.\nWe prove two types of decay: The first is a uniform decay of the energy of the\nMaxwell field on achronal hypersurfaces as the hypersurfaces approach timelike\ninfinities. The second decay result is a pointwise decay in time with a rate of\n$t^{-1}$ which follows from local energy decay by Sobolev estimates. Both\nresults are consequences of bounds on the conformal energy defined by the\nMorawetz conformal vector field. These bounds are obtained through wave\nanalysis on the middle spin component of the field. The results hold for a more\ngeneral class of spherically symmetric spacetimes with the same arguments used\nin this paper.\n", "  To explore material dependence of layered cuprate superconductors, we examine\neffective two-particle interactions for Hg1201 and Tl1201, where Tl1201 having\na nearly half value of Tc of Hg1201 even at the optimal oxygen concentration.\nAlthough the 3dx_2-y_2 band, the Fermi surface, and its Wannier-orbitals are\nsimilar for these superconductors, there is an apparent difference in the\nunoccupied levels above EF. Based on a multi-reference\ndensity-functional-theory formulation, effective two-particle exchange\ninteractions are estimated to derive enhancement in intra-layer exchange\ninteractions for HgBa2CuO4, while it is weakened in TlBaLaCuO5 and furthermore\nit is weak in TlBa2CuO5. The characteristic difference in the band structure is\ncorrelated with oxygen contents in the buffer layer. We also comment on the\nsimilar feature in triple-layered compounds. Our spin-fluctuation enhancement\nmechanism in an electron-correlation regime is consistent with the experimental\nfact.\n", "  It has long been known that radiation biology plays an important role and it\nis necessary for radiotherapy treatments. The radiation effects on normal and\nmalignant tissues after exposure range from a femtosecond to months and years\nthereafter [1,2]. Therefore, to optimize treatment, it is crucial to explain\nand understand these mechanisms [3-5]. Providing a conceptual basis for\nradiotherapy and identifying the mechanisms and processes that underlie the\ntumor and normal tissue responses to irradiation can help to explain the\nobserved phenomena [6]. Examples include understanding hypoxia, reoxygenation,\ntumor cell repopulation, or the mechanisms of repair of DNA damage [3,7,8]. The\ndifferent biological effects of radiation should be divided into several\nphases: physical (interaction between charged particles and tissue atoms),\nchemical (the period during which the damaged atoms and molecules react with\nother cellular components in rapid chemical reactions), and biological (impact\nof the generated lesions on the biological tissue [4]). The following section\ndescribes the models most often used in radiotherapy. These are simplistic\nmodels that actual treatments are based, and that are validated and approved\n[9-12].\n", "  In this paper we propose a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory on a\nNambu--Jacobi manifold. The advantange of a geometric Hamilton--Jacobi theory\nis that if a Hamiltonian vector field $X_H$ can be projected into a\nconfiguration manifold by means of a one-form $dW$, then the integral curves of\nthe projected vector field $X_H^{dW}$ can be transformed into integral curves\nof the vector field $X_H$ provided that $W$ is a solution of the\nHamilton--Jacobi equation. This procedure allows us to reduce the dynamics to a\nlower dimensional manifold in which we integrate the motion. On the other hand,\nthe interest of a Nambu--Jacobi structure resides in its role in the\ndescription of dynamics in terms of several Hamiltonian functions. It appears\nin fluid dynamics, for instance. Here, we derive an explicit expression for a\ngeometric Hamilton--Jacobi equation on a Nambu--Jacobi manifold and apply it to\nthe third-order Riccati differential equation as an example.\n", "  We study the gap properties of nearest neighbors tight binding models on\nquasiperiodic chains. We argue that two kind of gaps should be distinguished:\nstable and transient. We show that stable gaps have a well defined\nquasiperiodic limit. We also show that there is a direct relation between the\ngap size and the gap label.\n", "  We demonstrate that a photon echo can be implemented by all-optical means\nusing an array of on-chip high-finesse ring cavities whose parameters are\nchirped in such a way as to support equidistant spectra of cavity modes. When\nlaunched into such a system, a classical or quantum optical signal -- even a\nsingle-photon field -- becomes distributed between individual cavities, giving\nrise to prominent coherence echo revivals at well-defined delay times,\ncontrolled by the chirp of cavity parameters. This effect enables long storage\ntimes for high-throughput broadband optical delay and quantum memory.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to provide a quantum counterpart of the well known\nminimum-distance classifier named Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC). In particular,\nwe refer to the following previous works: i) in Sergioli et al. 2016, we have\nintroduced a detailed quantum version of the NMC, named Quantum Nearest Mean\nClassifier (QNMC), for two-dimensional problems and we have proposed a\ngeneralization to abitrary dimensions; ii) in Sergioli et al. 2017, the\nn-dimensional problem was analyzed in detail and a particular encoding for\narbitrary n-feature vectors into density operators has been presented. In this\npaper, we introduce a new promizing encoding of arbitrary n-dimensional\npatterns into density operators, starting from the two-feature encoding\nprovided in the first work. Further, unlike the NMC, the QNMC shows to be not\ninvariant by rescaling the features of each pattern. This property allows us to\nintroduce a free parameter whose variation provides, in some case, an\nimprovement of the QNMC performance. We show experimental results where: i) the\nNMC and QNMC performances are compared on different datasets; ii) the effects\nof the non-invariance under uniform rescaling for the QNMC are investigated.\n", "  Earth system analysis is the study of the joint dynamics of biogeophysical,\nsocial and technological processes on our planet. To advance our understanding\nof possible future development pathways and identify management options for\nnavigating to safe operating spaces while avoiding undesirable domains,\ncomputer models of the Earth system are developed and applied. These models\nhardly represent dynamical properties of technological processes despite their\ngreat planetary-scale influence on the biogeophysical components of the Earth\nsystem and the associated risks for human societies posed, e.g., by climatic\nchange or novel entities. In this contribution, we reflect on the technosphere\nfrom the perspective of Earth system analysis with a threefold focus on agency,\nnetworks and complex coevolutionary dynamics. First, we argue that Haff's\nconception of the technosphere takes an extreme position in implying a strongly\nconstrained human agency in the Earth system. Assuming that the technosphere\ndevelops according to dynamics largely independently of human intentions,\nHaff's perspective appears incompatible with a humanistic view that underlies\nthe sustainability discourse at large and, more specifically, current\nframeworks such as UN sustainable development goals and the safe and just\noperating space for humanity. Second, as an alternative to Haff's static\nthree-stratum picture, we propose complex adaptive networks as a concept for\ndescribing the interplay of social agents and technospheric entities and their\nemergent dynamics for Earth system analysis. Third, we argue that following a\ncoevolutionary approach in conceptualising and modelling technospheric\ndynamics, also including the socio-cultural and biophysical spheres of the\nEarth system, could resolve the apparent conflict between the discourses on\nsustainability and the technosphere.\n", "  The framework under which decays $\\Lambda_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})\\rightarrow\nB(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})+M$ are analyzed is not applicable for the decays\n$\\Lambda_{b}(\\frac{1}{2}^{+})\\rightarrow B^{\\ast}(\\frac{3}{2} ^{+})+M$. These\ndecays occur through a baryon pole $\\Sigma^{0}_{c}$ which is generated by the\nW-exchange diagram in the process $b+u \\xrightarrow {W} c+d$. The effective\nHamiltonian which arises from the W-exchange diagram is expressed in the non\nrelativistic limit. Since $% \\Sigma^{0}_{c}$ belongs to representation $6$ of\nSU(3), it contributes to two sets of decays:\n$\\Lambda_{b}\\rightarrow\\Delta^{0}D^{0},\\Delta^{-}D^{+},% \\Sigma^{*-}D_s^{+}$\nand $\\Lambda_{b}\\rightarrow\\Sigma^{\\ast-}_{c}\\pi^{+},%\n  \\Sigma^{\\ast 0}_{c}\\pi^{0}\\;, \\Xi^{\\ast 0}_{c}K^{0}$. The branching ratios\nfor these decays are evaluated which can be compared with their experimental\nvalues when the data become available. Other prediction of the model is that\nasymmetry parameter $\\alpha = 0$, since baryon pole contributes to parity\nconserving (p-wave) amplitude and does not contribute to parity violating\n(d-wave) amplitude.\n", "  Taurids are an extensive stream of particles produced by comet 2P/Encke,\nwhich can be observed mainly in October and November as a series of meteor\nshowers rich in bright fireballs. Several near-Earth asteroids have also been\nlinked with the meteoroid complex, and recently the orbits of two carbonaceous\nmeteorites were proposed to be related to the stream, raising interesting\nquestions about the origin of the complex and the composition of 2P/Encke. Our\naim is to investigate the nature and diversity of Taurid meteoroids by studying\ntheir spectral, orbital, and physical properties determined from video meteor\nobservations. Here we analyze 33 Taurid meteor spectra captured during the\npredicted outburst in November 2015 by stations in Slovakia and Chile,\nincluding 14 multi-station observations for which the orbital elements,\nmaterial strength parameters, dynamic pressures, and mineralogical densities\nwere determined. It was found that while orbits of the 2015 Taurids show\nsimilarities with several associated asteroids, the obtained spectral and\nphysical characteristics point towards cometary origin with highly\nheterogeneous content. Observed spectra exhibited large dispersion of iron\ncontent and significant Na intensity in all cases. The determined material\nstrengths are typically cometary in the $K_B$ classification, while $P_E$\ncriterion is on average close to values characteristic for carbonaceous bodies.\nThe studied meteoroids were found to break up under low dynamic pressures of\n0.02 - 0.10 MPa, and were characterized by low mineralogical densities of 1.3 -\n2.5 g cm$^{-3}$. The widest spectral classification of Taurid meteors to date\nis presented.\n", "  The dynamic Stark shift results from the interaction of an atom with the\nelectromagnetic field. We show how a propagating single-photon wave packet can\ninduce a time-dependent dynamical Stark shift on a two-level system (TLS). A\nnon-perturbative fully-quantum treatment is employed, where the quantum\ndynamics of both the field and the TLS are analyzed. We also provide the means\nto experimentally access such time-dependent frequency by measuring the\ninterference pattern in the electromagnetic field inside a one-dimensional (1D)\nwaveguide. The effect we evidence here may find applications in the autonomous\nquantum control of quantum systems without classical external fields, that can\nbe useful for quantum information processing as well as for quantum\nthermodynamical tasks.\n", "  Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) need imaging optics with\nlarge apertures to map the faint Cherenkov light emitted in extensive air\nshowers onto their image sensors. Segmented reflectors fulfill these needs\nusing mass produced and light weight mirror facets. However, as the overall\nimage is the sum of the individual mirror facet images, alignment is important.\nHere we present a method to determine the mirror facet positions on a segmented\nreflector in a very direct way. Our method reconstructs the mirror facet\npositions from photographs and a laser distance meter measurement which goes\nfrom the center of the image sensor plane to the center of each mirror facet.\nWe use our method to both align the mirror facet positions and to feed the\nmeasured positions into our IACT simulation. We demonstrate our implementation\non the 4 m First Geiger-mode Avalanche Cherenkov Telescope (FACT).\n", "  Space solar cells radiation hardness is of fundamental importance in view of\nthe future missions towards harsh radiation environment (like e.g. missions to\nJupiter) and for the new spacecraft using electrical propulsion. In this paper\nwe report the radiation data for triple junction (TJ) solar cells and related\ncomponent cells. Triple junction solar cells, InGaP top cells and GaAs middle\ncells degrade after electron radiation as expected. With proton irradiation, a\nhigh spread in the remaining factors was observed, especially for the TJ and\nbottom cells. Very surprising was the germanium bottom junction that showed\nvery high degradation after protons whereas it is quite stable against\nelectrons. Radiation results have been analyzed by means of the Displacement\nDamage Dose method and DLTS spectroscopy.\n", "  Magnetic field (B) distribution of the magnetron was measured and discussed\nits effect on plasma parameters and deposition rate. Plasma parameters such as\nelectron temperature (Te), electron number density (ne) were estimated using\nelectron flux (EF) and electron energy distribution function (EEDF) methods as\nfunction of axial, radial distances from the cathode. Te and ne decreased with\nincreasing of axial, radial distances from the cathode. Dr was obtained for the\nsame positions where the above plasma parameters were measured, and found that\nsimilar profile with Te and ne. Magnetron configuration was simulated using\nCOMSOL Multiphysics software and compared with the experimentally measured\nprofile. Further, density distribution was simulated using measured B through\nparticle in cell - Monte Carlo collision and found simulation results are well\nsupported to the experimental results.\n", "  In this paper we analyse the profile of land use and population density with\nrespect to the distance to the city centre for the European city. In addition\nto providing the radial population density and soil-sealing profiles for a\nlarge set of cities, we demonstrate a remarkable constancy of the profiles\nacross city size.\n  Our analysis combines the GMES/Copernicus Urban Atlas 2006 land use database\nat 5m resolution for 300 European cities with more than 100.000 inhabitants and\nthe Geostat population grid at 1km resolution. Population is allocated\nproportionally to surface and weighted by soil sealing and density classes of\nthe Urban Atlas. We analyse the profile of each artificial land use and\npopulation with distance to the town hall.\n  In line with earlier literature, we confirm the strong monocentricity of the\nEuropean city and the negative exponential curve for population density.\nMoreover, we find that land use curves, in particular the share of housing and\nroads, scale along the two horizontal dimensions with the square root of city\npopulation, while population curves scale in three dimensions with the cubic\nroot of city population. In short, European cities of different sizes are\nhomothetic in terms of land use and population density. While earlier\nliterature documented the scaling of average densities (total surface and\npopulation) with city size, we document the scaling of the whole radial\ndistance profile with city size, thus liaising intra-urban radial analysis and\nsystems of cities. In addition to providing a new empirical view of the\nEuropean city, our scaling offers a set of practical and coherent definitions\nof a city, independent of its population, from which we can re-question urban\nscaling laws and Zipf's law for cities.\n", "  We investigate a role of the Hall-effect in the current sheet evolution and\nonset of the secondary tearing (plasmoid) instability in the framework of the\nincompressible resistive Hall-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The model under\nconsideration is a force-free modification of the Taylor's problem. Thus, the\nfirst part of the paper is devoted to a detailed analytical study of the\nHall-MHD forced magnetic reconnection in a tearing stable force-free magnetic\nconfiguration. Then, in the second part, these results are used to investigate\nwhen and how the plasmoid instability can develop in the course of this\nprocess.\n", "  Mechanical systems can display topological characteristics similar to that of\ntopological insulators. Here we report a large class of topological mechanical\nsystems related to the BDI symmetry class. These are self-assembled chains of\nrigid bodies with an inversion center and no reflection planes. The\nparticle-hole symmetry characteristic to the BDI symmetry class stems from the\ndistinct behavior of the translational and rotational degrees of freedom under\ninversion. This and other generic properties led us to the remarkable\nconclusion that, by adjusting the gyration radius of the bodies, one can always\nsimultaneously open a gap in the phonon spectrum, lock-in all the\ncharacteristic symmetries and generate a non-trivial topological invariant. The\nparticle-hole symmetry occurs around a finite frequency, hence we can witness a\ndynamical topological Majorana edge mode. Contrasting a floppy mode occurring\nat zero frequency, a dynamical edge mode can absorb and store mechanical\nenergy, potentially opening new applications of topological mechanics.\n", "  Molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe$_2$) has attracted considerable interest for\nnanoelectronic, optoelectronic, spintronic, and valleytronic applications\nbecause of its modest band gap, high field-effect mobility, large\nspin-orbit-coupling splitting, and tunable 1T'/2H phases. However, synthesizing\nlarge-area, high-quality MoTe$_2$ remains challenging. The complicated design\nof gas-phase reactant transport and reaction for chemical vapor deposition or\ntellurization is nontrivial because of the weak bonding energy between Mo and\nTe. Here, we report a new method for depositing MoTe$_2$ that entails using\nphysical vapor deposition followed by a post-annealing process in a Te-free\natmosphere. Both Mo and Te were physically deposited onto the substrate by\nsputtering a MoTe$_2$ target. A composite SiO$_2$ capping layer was designed to\nprevent Te sublimation during the post-annealing process. The post-annealing\nprocess facilitated 1T'-to-2H phase transition and solid-phase crystallization,\nleading to the formation of high-crystallinity few-layer 2H-MoTe$_2$ with a\nfield-effect mobility of ~10 cm$^2$/(V-s), the highest among all nonexfoliated\n2H-MoTe$_2$ currently reported. Furthermore, 2H-MoS$_2$ and Td-WTe$_2$ can be\ndeposited using similar methods. Requiring no transfer or chemical reaction of\nmetal and chalcogen reactants in the gas phase, the proposed method is\npotentially a general yet simple approach for depositing a wide variety of\nlarge-area, high-quality, two-dimensional layered structures.\n", "  We have studied the effect of free space nucleon radius on the nuclear matter\nand slowly rotating neutron star properties within a relativistic mean field\nmodel with the inclusion of omega-rho mixing nonlinear term. We use the same\ndensity dependent radius as in our previous work. However, in the present work\nwe utilize the parameter sets with more proper symmetric nuclear matter (SNM)\npredictions for a number of different nucleon radii. To this end, the isoscalar\nparameters in each parameter set and the cutoff parameter $\\beta$ are adjusted\nby fitting the corresponding SNM properties at sub-saturation density to the\nprediction of IUFSU parameter set. We have obtained that the assumption of\ncomposite nucleons with free space radius $r \\le 0.83$ fm is still compatible\nwith the currently acceptable nuclear matter (NM) properties beyond the\nsaturation density. We have also found that the effect of free space nucleon\nradius could be imprinted in the radius, moment of inertia, and crust\nproperties of the slowly rotating neutron star.\n", "  In light of the Gravitational Waves observation and the discrete structure of\nspacetime at high scales M_QG, we investigate the behavior of Gravitational\nWaves and the spacetime deformation patterns in terms of gravitons and derive\nthe effective results with respect to photons. Using the GW150914 data and\nrelated signals, we probe the underlying quantum scale M_QG 10_6 GeV.\n", "  The so-called holographic principle, originally addressed to high energy\nphysics, suggests more generally that the information contents of the system\n(measured by its entropy) scales as the event horizon surface. It has been\nformulated also a holographic super-string model for the anti de Sitter space,\nwhich allows for implementation of quantum gravity in the volume by only\nquantum boundary---hologram. The locally planar topology of the boundary of 3D\nspace leads, however, to more reach possibilities of quantization of many\nparticle systems according to representations of related braid groups (i.e.,\nfirst homotopy groups of the configuration space for multiparticle systems).\nThis level of freedom would be helpful in symmetry-term considerations of\nhypothetical locally 2D hologram properties corresponding to anyons. Specific\nproperties of anyons on a sphere are compared with fractional charge of quarks.\nThe confinement of quarks in hadrons is conjectured to be linked with the\ncollective behavior of anyons precluding their individual separation.\n", "  The aim of AMADEUS is to provide unprecedented experimental information on\nK$^-$ absorption in light nuclear targets, to face major open problems in\nhadron nuclear physics in the strangeness sector, namely the nature of the\n$\\Lambda$(1405), strongly related to the possible existence of kaonic nuclear\nclusters, kaons and hyperon scattering cross sections on nucleons and nuclei.\nThese issues are fundamental for a better understanding of the non-perturbative\nQCD in the strangeness sector.\n  AMADEUS step 0 deals with the analysis of the 2004-2005 KLOE collected data.\nThe interactions of the negative kaons produced by the DA$\\Phi$NE collider (a\nunique source of monochromatic low-momentum kaons) with the materials of the\nKLOE detector, used as active targets, provide samples of K$^-$ absorptions on\nH, ${}^4$He, ${}^{9}$Be and ${}^{12}$C, both at-rest and in-flight. A second\nstep deals with the data from the implementation in the central region of the\nKLOE detector of a pure graphite target, providing a high statistic sample of\nK$^- \\, {}^{12}$C nuclear captures at rest. For the future a new setup, with\nvarious dedicated gaseous and solid targets, is under preparation.\n", "  Slot antennas are very popular microwave antennas and slotted wave guides are\nused for high frequency radar systems. A thin slot in an infinite ground plane\nis the complement to a dipole in free space. This was described by H.G. Booker\n[2] who extended Babinet's principle from optics to show that the slot will\nhave the same radiation pattern as a dipole such that the E and H fields are\nswapped. As a result, the polarization is rotated, so that radiation from\nvertical slot is polarized horizontally. In this work we show how analytical\ntechniques can be used for optimization of THz slot antennas, the analysis is\nthen corroborated by using a numerical simulation which validates the\nperformance parameters predicted by the analytical technique.\n", "  Power generation in Germany is currently transitioning from a system based on\nlarge, central, thermal power plants to one that heavily relies on small,\ndecentral, mostly renewable power generators. This development poses the\nquestion how transmission grids' reactive power demand for voltage management,\ncovered by central power plants today, can be supplied in the future.\n  In this work, we estimate the future technical potential of such an approach\nfor the whole of Germany. For a 100% renewable electricity scenario we set the\npossible reactive power supply in comparison with the reactive power\nrequirements that are needed to realize the simulated future transmission grid\npower flows. Since an exact calculation of distribution grids' reactive power\npotential is difficult due to the unavailability of detailed grid models on\nsuch scale, we optimistically estimate the potential by assuming a scaled,\naveraged distribution grid model connected to each of the transmission grid\nnodes.\n  We find that for all except a few transmission grid nodes, the required\nreactive power can be fully supplied from the modeled distribution grids. This\nimplies that - even if our estimate is overly optimistic - distributed reactive\npower provisioning will be a technical solution for many future reactive power\nchallenges.\n", "  Ferrogels, i.e., hydrogels loaded with magnetic nanoparticles, have the\nability to deform in external magnetic fields. The precise shape of deformation\nand the alignment of the gel in the field, however, depend on the interplay of\nseveral factors. In this paper, we introduce a coarse-grained simulation model,\nwhich takes into account the configuration of magnetic particles in the gel,\nthe sample shape, and aspects of the polymer network topology. We use this\nmodel to show that in gels with an isotropic microstructure, an external\nmagnetic field reduces clustering, while this is not the case for uniaxial\ngels, in which the particle configuration is anisotropic due to the presence of\na magnetic field during cross-linking. For ellipsoidal gels, we find that a\nuniaxial microstructure additionally can override the deformation and alignment\nexpected as indicated the demagnetization energy. Finally, we examine to what\ndegree gels with different network topologies maintain the particle\nmicrostructure ``frozen in`` during the cross-linking process.\n", "  In this paper, the interaction and transmission time of quantum density\nsolitons waves representing particles passing through finite barrier potentials\nis investigated. Using the conservation of energy and of quantum density, it is\nfirst demonstrated that these waves have finite de Broglie wavelength and\nrepresent particles in quantum theory. The passage of the quantum density\nsolitons (particles) through barriers of finite energies is then shown to lead\nto the phenomena of resonant tunneling and, in Josephson-like configurations,\nto the quantization of magnetic flux. A precise general measure for barrier\ntunneling time is derived which is found to give a new interpretation of the\nquantum indeterminacy principles.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the often observed broadness of the molecular weight\ndistribution obtained from latex particles synthesized by means of\nsurfactant-free emulsion polymerization results from the multistage kinetics.\nThe initial stage of the polymerization, by which the primary particles are\nformed, is of the 01-kind which means that it can be assumed that the particles\nare so small that at any moment of time there is no more than one radical chain\nper particle. After the aggregation of primary particles into secondary\nparticles, the so called coagulative nucleation step, the polymerization\nkinetics in the subsequently coalesced secondary particles is of the\npseudo-bulk kind which means that there are so many radicals in the particles\nthat the polymerization process proceeds as in bulk. The important consequence\nis that the molecular weight of the 01-process is about one order of magnitude\nlarger than that of the pseudo-bulk process. Hence, each of these\npolymerization modes and the aggregation stage in-between leave their traces in\nthe molecular weight distribution as is shown by experiments aimed at\nprolonging the initial formation kinetics. Bimodal molecular weight\ndistributions are found both for ionic and non-ionic initiators.\n", "  The aim of this work is to study heat pump cycles, using CO 2 based mixtures\nas working fluids. Since adding other chemicals to CO 2 moves the critical\npoint and generally equilibrium lines, it is expected that lower operating\npressures as well as higher global efficiencies may be reached. A simple stage\npure CO 2 cycle is used as reference, with fixed external conditions. Two\nscenarios are considered: water is heated from 10 {\\textdegree}C to 65\n{\\textdegree}C for Domestic Hot Water scenario and from 30 {\\textdegree}C to 35\n{\\textdegree}C for Central Heating scenario. In both cases, water at the\nevaporator inlet is set at 7 {\\textdegree}C to account for such outdoor\ntemperature conditions. In order to understand the dynamic behaviour of\nthermodynamic cycles with mixtures, it is essential to measure the fluid\ncirculating composition. To this end, we have developed a non intrusive method.\nOnline optical flow cells allow the recording of infrared spectra by means of a\nFourier Transform Infra Red spectrometer. A careful calibration is performed by\nmeasuring a statistically significant number of spectra for samples of known\ncomposition. Then, a statistical model is constructed to relate spectra to\ncompositions. After calibration, compositions are obtained by recording the\nspectrum in few seconds, thus allowing for a dynamic analysis. This article\nwill describe the experimental setup and the composition measurement\ntechniques. Then a first account of results with pure CO 2 , and with the\naddition of propane or R-1234yf will be given.\n", "  As the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of nuclear system can provide\nmore confident bounds for the Best-estimate Prediction used to assess the\nperformance and safety of nuclear plant, the uncertainty and sensitivity\nanalysis has been a component of analysis of nuclear system. Both the cross\nsection uncertainty and the uncertainty of parameters of fuel/assembly\nmanufacturing are analyzed in this paper. All results of SUACL were found in\naccordance with the results of reference codes.238U and 235U play an important\nrole in determining the uncertainty of Keff in TMI-1 cell. The uncertainty of\nKeff in MOX is mainly affected by 239Pu and 238U. It is obvious that the\nuncertainty mostly depends on the covariance library and insensitivities to\ncross section library. The uncertainties based on the covariance library\nobtained from ENDF/B-VII.1 differ from the result of JENDL4.0, which verified\nthe relationship of covariance matrix and the uncertainty of cross section. And\nthe parameters of fuel/assembly manufacturing uncertainty are comparable to\nuncertainty of some cross section, especially the 235U concentration, clad\nthickness. The uncertainty analysis of these parameters is of great\nsignificance to evaluate the parameter of actual cell and help to improve the\nmodel simulated. More attentions need paid to improve the accuracy of the\nparameters analysis talked in the paper.\n", "  We report fabrication of an optically active, bio-electronic device based on\nthin film of purple membrane and single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT). Two\ndimensional (2D) crystals of photoactive bacteriorhodopsin forms the optical\ncenter of the purple membrane where as pure SWNTs provides the necessary\nelectronic support to the complex. Electro-optically functional and stable,\nhybrid complex was prepared using surface functionalization of SWNTs with\nindigenous, batch-process synthesized purple membrane. Raman spectra of the\nhybrid complex shows significant charge transfer and surface functionalization\nof SWNTs. Optically active, field effect transistor based on the prepared thin\nfilm of bio-nano hybrid complex is fabricated using direct laser lithography\nand conventional lift off technology. Significant optical doping is observed in\nthe fabricated field effect transistor. Fabricated devices show repeatable\nstable performance with well-controlled optical and electronic gating. Device\nshows essentially n-type FET characteristics and transistor is ON for positive\ngate voltages. However, same n-type FET shows complimentary p-type\ncharacteristics under visible light illumination, with transistor being ON for\nnegative gate voltages. Significant optical doping, photo-conductivity and\noptical switching were observed.\n", "  With excellent efficiencies being reported from multiple labs across the\nworld, device stability and the degradation mechanisms have emerged as the key\naspects that could determine the future prospects of perovskite solar cells.\nHowever, the related experimental efforts remain scattered due to the lack of\nany unifying theoretical framework. In this context, here we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of ion migration effects in perovskite solar cells.\nSpecifically, we show, for the first time, that (a) the effect of ionic charges\nis almost indistinguishable from that of dopant ions, (b) ion migration could\nlead to simultaneous improvement in Voc and degradation in Jsc - a unique\nobservation which is beyond the realm of mere parametric variation in carrier\nmobility and lifetime, (c) champion devices are more resilient towards the ill\neffects of ion migration, and finally (d) we propose unique characterization\nschemes to determine both magnitude and polarity of ionic species. Our results,\nsupported by detailed numerical simulations and direct comparison with\nexperimental data, are of broad interest and provide a much needed predictive\ncapability towards the research on performance degradation mechanisms in\nperovskite solar cells\n", "  Carrier selective (CS) silicon solar cells are increasingly explored using a\nvariety of different materials. However, the optimum properties of such CS\nmaterials are not well understood. In this context, through detailed analytical\nand numerical modeling, here we provide several interesting insights on the\nefficiency tradeoff with CS material properties. First, we show that perfect\nband alignment is a desirable feature only if the interface is devoid of any\ntrap states. Otherwise, a band offset of around 0.2eV-0.4eV provides sufficient\nband bending to reduce the effect of interface recombination, thus improving\nthe performance. Surprisingly, the interface passivation quality for the\nminority carrier extraction layer is found to be far less demanding than that\nfor the majority carrier extraction layer. Additionally, doping density and\ndielectric constant of CS layers have a similar effect as band offset on solar\ncell performance. Our results have obvious implications toward the selection of\nappropriate materials as carrier selective layers and hence are of broad\ninterest to the community.\n", "  An infinite family of exact solutions of the electrovacuum Einstein-Maxwell\nequations is presented. The family is static, axially symmetric and describe\nthin disks composed by electrically polarized material in a conformastatic\nspacetime. The form of the conformastatic metric allows us to write down the\nmetric functions and the electromagnetic potentials in terms of a solution of\nthe Laplace equation. We find a general expression for the surface energy\ndensity of the disk, the pressure, the polarization vector, the electromagnetic\nfields and the velocity rotation for circular orbits. As an example, we present\nthe first model of the family and show the behavior of the different physical\nvariables.\n", "  Many amorphous materials show spatially heterogenous dynamics, as different\nregions of the same system relax at different rates. Such a signature, known as\nDynamic Heterogeneity, has been crucial to understand the jamming transition in\nsimple model systems and, currently, is considered very promising to\ncharacterize more complex fluids of industrial and biological relevance.\nUnfortunately, measurements of dynamic heterogeneities typically require\nsophysticated experimental set-ups and are performed by few specialized groups.\nIt is now possible to quantitatively characterize the relaxation process and\nthe emergence of dynamic heterogeneities using a straightforward method, here\nvalidated on video microscopy data of hard-sphere colloidal glasses. We call\nthis method Differential Variance Analysis (DVA), since it focuses on the\nvariance of the differential frames, obtained subtracting images at different\nlag-times. Moreover, direct visualization of dynamic heterogeneities naturally\nappears in the differential frames, when the lag-time is set to the one\ncorresponding to the maximum dynamic susceptibility. This approach opens the\nway to effectively characterize and tailor a wide variety of soft materials,\nfrom complex formulated products to biological tissues.\n", "  The main physics goal of the SNO+ experiment is the search for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay (0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$), a rare process which if detected, will\nprove the Majorana nature of neutrinos and provide information on the absolute\nscale of the neutrino mass. Additional physics goals include the study of solar\nneutrinos, anti-neutrinos from nuclear reactors and the Earth's natural\nradioactivity as well as Supernovae neutrinos. Located in the SNOLAB (Canada)\ndeep underground laboratory, it will re-use the SNO detector. A short phase\nwith the detector completely filled with water has started at the beginning of\n2017, before running the detector with scintillator. This paper describes in\ndetails the SNO+ sensitivity to 0$\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays, as well as the other\nphysics goals. Crucial to these large volume liquid scintillator experiments,\nis the ability to constraint the low-energy background from radioactive decays.\nMethods to mitigate those are also presented.\n", "  We explain the construction of Forcer, a FORM program for the reduction of\nfour-loop massless propagator-type integrals to master integrals. The resulting\nprogram performs parametric IBP reductions similar to the three-loop Mincer\nprogram. We show how one can solve many systems of IBP identities\nparametrically in a computer-assisted manner. Next, we discuss the structure of\nthe Forcer program, which involves recognizing reduction actions for each\ntopology, applying symmetries, and transitioning between topologies after edges\nhave been removed. This part is entirely precomputed and automatically\ngenerated. We give examples of recent applications of Forcer, and study the\nperformance of the program. Finally we demonstrate how to use the Forcer\npackage and sketch how to prepare physical diagrams for evaluation by Forcer.\n", "  A simple analytical model for describing inner parts of dark matter halo is\nconsidered. It is assumed that dark matter density is power-law. The model\ndeals with dark matter distribution function in phase space of adiabatic\ninvariants (radial action and angular momentum). Two variants are considered\nfor the angular part of the distribution function: narrow and broad\ndistribution. The model allows to describe explicitly the process of adiabatic\ncontraction of halo due to change of gravitational potential caused by\ncondensation of baryonic matter in the centre. The modification of dark matter\ndensity in the centre is calculated, and is it shown that the standard\nalgorithm of adiabatic contraction calculation overestimates the compressed\nhalo density, especially in the case of strong radial anisotropy.\n", "  Entropy estimation of information sources is highly non trivial for symbol\nsequences with strong long-range correlations. The rabbit sequence, related to\nthe symbolic dynamics of the nonlinear circle map at the critical point as well\nas the logistic map at the Feigenbaum point have been argued to exhibit long\nmemory tails. For both dynamical systems the scaling behavior of the block\nentropy of order n has been shown to increase like as log(n). In contrast to\nprobabilistic concepts, we investigate the scaling behavior of certain\nnon-probabilistic entropy estimation schemes suggested by Lempel and Ziv in the\ncontext of algorithmic complexity and data compression. These are applied in a\nsequential manner with the scaling variable being the length N of the sequence.\nWe determine the scaling law for the Lempel-Ziv entropy estimate applied to the\ncase of the critical circle map and the logistic map at the Feigenbaum point in\na binary partition.\n", "  We discuss algorithms for estimating the Shannon entropy h of finite symbol\nsequences with long range correlations. In particular, we consider algorithms\nwhich estimate h from the code lengths produced by some compression algorithm.\nOur interest is in describing their convergence with sequence length, assuming\nno limits for the space and time complexities of the compression algorithms. A\nscaling law is proposed for extrapolation from finite sample lengths. This is\napplied to sequences of dynamical systems in non-trivial chaotic regimes, a 1-D\ncellular automaton, and to written English texts.\n"]}
