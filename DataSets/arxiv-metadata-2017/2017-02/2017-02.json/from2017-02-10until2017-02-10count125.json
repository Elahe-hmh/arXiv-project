Our study is focused on the\nperiodic orbits of the system given in a suitable rotating frame. The stability\nof periodic orbits characterize the evolution of any planetary system with\ninitial conditions in their vicinity. Stable periodic orbits are associated\nwith long term regular evolution, while unstable periodic orbits are surrounded\nby regions of chaotic motion. We compute many families of symmetric periodic\norbits by applying two schemes of analytical continuation. In the first scheme,\nwe start from the 2/1 (or 1/2) resonant periodic orbits of the restricted\nproblem and in the second scheme, we start from vertical critical periodic\norbits of the general planar problem. Most of the periodic orbits are unstable,\nbut many stable periodic orbits have been, also, found with mutual inclination\nup to $50^\\circ$ - $60^\\circ$, which may be related with the existence of real\nplanetary systems.\n", "  The planetary dynamics of $4/3$, $3/2$, $5/2$, $3/1$ and $4/1$ mean motion\nresonances is studied by using the model of the general three body problem in a\nrotating frame and by determining families of periodic orbits for each\nresonance. Both planar and spatial cases are examined. In the spatial problem,\nfamilies of periodic orbits are obtained after analytical continuation of\nvertical critical orbits. The linear stability of orbits is also examined.\nConcerning initial conditions nearby stable periodic orbits, we obtain\nlong-term planetary stability, while unstable orbits are associated with\nchaotic evolution that destabilizes the planetary system. Stable periodic\norbits are of particular importance in planetary dynamics, since they can host\nreal planetary systems. We found stable orbits up to $60^\\circ$ of mutual\nplanetary inclination, but in most families, the stability does not exceed\n$20^\\circ$-$30^\\circ$, depending on the planetary mass ratio. Most of these\norbits are very eccentric. Stable inclined circular orbits or orbits of low\neccentricity were found in the $4/3$ and $5/2$ resonance, respectively.\n", "  A Lagrangian formulation is given extending to N = 1 supersymmetry the motion\nof a charged point particle with spin in a non-abelian external field. The\nclassical formulation is constructed for any external static non-abelian SU(N)\ngauge potential. As an illustration, a specific gauge is fixed enabling\ncanonical quantization and the study of the supersymmetric non-abelian Landau\nproblem. The spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian operator follows in accordance\nwith the supersymmetric structure.\n", "  Quantum electrodynamics in three spacetime dimensions, with one massless\nfermion species, is studied using a non-perturbative variational approach.\nQuantization of the theory follows Dirac's Hamiltonian procedure, with a gauge\ninvariant factorization of the physical degrees of freedom. Due to pair\ncondensation in the vacuum state, the symmetry of parity is spontaneously\nbroken. As a consequence, fermionic quasi-particles propagating in the\ncondensate can be identified and are seen to possess a confining dynamical\nmass, while the propagating physical electromagnetic mode also acquires a\nnon-vanishing dynamical mass. The issues of gauge invariance and confinement of\nthe constituent fermions are carefully discussed.\n", "  We consider a two-planet system, which migrates under the influence of\ndissipative forces that mimic the effects of gas-driven (Type II) migration. It\nhas been shown that, in the planar case, migration leads to resonant capture\nafter an evolution that forces the system to follow families of periodic\norbits. Starting with planets that differ slightly from a coplanar\nconfiguration, capture can, also, occur and, additionally, excitation of\nplanetary inclinations has been observed in some cases. We show that excitation\nof inclinations occurs, when the planar families of periodic orbits, which are\nfollowed during the initial stages of planetary migration, become vertically\nunstable. At these points, {\\em vertical critical orbits} may give rise to\ngenerating stable families of $3D$ periodic orbits, which drive the evolution\nof the migrating planets to non-coplanar motion. We have computed and present\nhere the vertical critical orbits of the $2/1$ and $3/1$ resonances, for\nvarious values of the planetary mass ratio. Moreover, we determine the limiting\nvalues of eccentricity for which the \"inclination resonance\" occurs.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a two-planet system, which evolves being in a $1/1$\nmean motion resonance (co-orbital motion) with non-zero mutual inclination. In\nparticular, we examine the existence of bifurcations of periodic orbits from\nthe planar to the spatial case. We find that such bifurcations exist only for\nplanetary mass ratios $\\rho=\\frac{m_2}{m_1}<0.0205$. For $\\rho$ in the interval\n$0<\\rho<0.0205$, we compute the generated families of spatial periodic orbits\nand their linear stability. These spatial families form bridges, which start\nand end at the same planar family. Along them the mutual planetary inclination\nvaries. We construct maps of dynamical stability and show the existence of\nregions of regular orbits in phase space.\n", "  Proton transfer across single layer graphene is associated with large\ncomputed energy barriers and is therefore thought to be unfavorable at room\ntemperature unless nanoscale holes or dopants are introduced, or a potential\nbias is applied. Here, we subject single layer graphene supported on fused\nsilica to cycles of high and low pH and show that protons transfer reversibly\nfrom the aqueous phase through the graphene to the other side where they\nundergo acid-base chemistry with the silica hydroxyl groups. After ruling out\ndiffusion through macroscopic pinholes, the protons are found to transfer\nthrough rare, naturally occurring atomic defects. Computer simulations reveal\nlow energy barriers of 0.68 to 0.75 eV for aqueous proton transfer across\nhydroxyl-terminated atomic defects that participate in a Grotthuss-type relay,\nwhile pyrylium-like ether terminations shut down proton exchange. Unfavorable\nenergy barriers to helium and hydrogen transfer indicate the transfer process\nis selective for aqueous protons.\n", "  A new, conserved, symmetric tensor field for a source-free Maxwell test field\non a four-dimensional spacetime with a conformal Killing-Yano tensor,\nsatisfying a certain compatibility condition, is introduced. In particular,\nthis construction works for the Kerr spacetime.\n", "  In this paper we show that interaction-free measurements, which have been\nobject of much discussion in the last few decades, can be explained in a\nnatural and intuitive way in the framework of complex nonlinear quantum\nphysics, contrary to what is claimed by some orthodox authors that present them\nas incomprehensible, mind-boggling experiments.\n", "  We derive Griffith functionals in the framework of linearized elasticity from\nnonlinear and frame indifferent energies in brittle fracture via\nGamma-convergence. The convergence is given in terms of rescaled displacement\nfields measuring the distance of deformations from piecewise rigid motions. The\nconfigurations of the limiting model consist of partitions of the material,\ncorresponding piecewise rigid deformations and displacement fields which are\ndefined separately on each component of the cracked body. Apart from the\nlinearized Griffith energy the limiting functional comprises also the\nsegmentation energy which is necessary to disconnect the parts of the specimen.\n", "  Magnetic and crystallographic properties of the mineral langite\nCu$_4$(OH)$_6$SO$_4\\cdot 2$H$_2$O are reported. Its layered crystal structure\nfeatures a peculiar spatial arrangement of spin-$\\frac12$ Cu$^{2+}$ ions that\narises from a combination of corner- and edge-sharing chains. Experimentally,\nlangite orders antiferromagnetically at $T_N\\simeq 5.7$ K as revealed by\nmagnetization and specific heat measurements. Despite this very low energy\nscale of the magnetic transition, langite features significantly stronger\ncouplings on the order of 50-70 K. Half of the Cu$^{2+}$ spins are weakly\ncoupled and saturate around 12T, where the magnetization reaches 0.5$\\mu_B$/Cu.\nThese findings are rationalized by density-functional band-structure\ncalculations suggesting a complex interplay of frustrated exchange couplings in\nthe magnetic planes. A simplified model of coupled magnetic sublattices\nexplains the experimental features qualitatively. To start from reliable\nstructural data, the crystal structure of langite in the 100-280 K temperature\nrange has been determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, and the hydrogen\npositions were refined computationally.\n", "  We study the nonextensive parameter for the rotating astrophysical systems\nwith power-law distributions, including both the rotating self-gravitating\nsystem and the rotating space plasma. We extend the equation of nonextensive\nparameter to complex system with arbitrary force field, and derive a general\nequation of the q-parameter, most generally including both the rotating\nself-gravitating systems and the rotating space plasmas. At the same time, we\nreproduce the kappa-distribution in space plasmas and obtain equations of the\nkappa-parameter. We show that the q-parameter is related not only to the\ntemperature gradient, the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force,\nbut also to the inertial centrifugal force and Coriolis force. Thus the\nrotation introduces significant effect on nonextensivity in the systems.\nSeveral examples are given to illustrate the nonextensive effect introduced by\nthe rotation.\n", "  Quantum Stein's Lemma is a cornerstone of quantum statistics and concerns the\nproblem of correctly identifying a quantum state, given the knowledge that it\nis one of two specific states ($\\rho$ or $\\sigma$). It was originally derived\nin the asymptotic i.i.d. setting, in which arbitrarily many (say, $n$)\nidentical copies of the state ($\\rho^{\\otimes n}$ or $\\sigma^{\\otimes n}$) are\nconsidered to be available. In this setting, the lemma states that, for any\ngiven upper bound on the probability $\\alpha_n$ of erroneously inferring the\nstate to be $\\sigma$, the probability $\\beta_n$ of erroneously inferring the\nstate to be $\\rho$ decays exponentially in $n$, with the rate of decay\nconverging to the relative entropy of the two states. The second order\nasymptotics for quantum hypothesis testing, which establishes the speed of\nconvergence of this rate of decay to its limiting value, was derived in the\ni.i.d. setting independently by Tomamichel and Hayashi, and Li. We extend this\nresult to settings beyond i.i.d.. Examples of these include Gibbs states of\nquantum spin systems (with finite-range, translation-invariant interactions) at\nhigh temperatures.\n", "  The meson cloud distributions in $r$-space are extracted from the nucleon\nelectromagnetic and axial form factors which are derived in the perturbative\nchiral quark model. The theoretical results indicate that the electric charge\nand axial charge distributions of the three-quark core are the same, the\nmagnetic charge distributions of the meson cloud and three-quark core are more\nor less in the same region and peak at distances of around 2 $\\rm GeV^{-1}$,\nbut the axial charge meson cloud distributes mainly inside the three-quark\ncore.\n", "  We approach the topic of Classical group nilpotent orbits from the\nperspective of their moduli spaces, described in terms of Hilbert series and\ngenerating functions. We review the established Higgs and Coulomb branch quiver\ntheory constructions for A series nilpotent orbits. We present systematic\nconstructions for BCD series nilpotent orbits on the Higgs branches of quiver\ntheories defined by canonical partitions; this paper collects earlier work into\na systematic framework, filling in gaps and providing a complete treatment. We\nfind new Coulomb branch constructions for above minimal nilpotent orbits,\nincluding some based upon twisted affine Dynkin diagrams. We also discuss\naspects of 3d mirror symmetry between these Higgs and Coulomb branch\nconstructions and explore dualities and other relationships, such as\nHyperKahler quotients, between quivers. We analyse all Classical group\nnilpotent orbit moduli spaces up to rank 4 by giving their unrefined Hilbert\nseries and the Highest Weight Generating functions for their decompositions\ninto characters of irreducible representations and/or Hall Littlewood\npolynomials.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of keV-scale sterile neutrino Dark Matter,\ncollecting views and insights from all disciplines involved - cosmology,\nastrophysics, nuclear, and particle physics - in each case viewed from both\ntheoretical and experimental/observational perspectives. After reviewing the\nrole of active neutrinos in particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology, we\nfocus on sterile neutrinos in the context of the Dark Matter puzzle. Here, we\nfirst review the physics motivation for sterile neutrino Dark Matter, based on\nchallenges and tensions in purely cold Dark Matter scenarios. We then round out\nthe discussion by critically summarizing all known constraints on sterile\nneutrino Dark Matter arising from astrophysical observations, laboratory\nexperiments, and theoretical considerations. In this context, we provide a\nbalanced discourse on the possibly positive signal from X-ray observations.\nAnother focus of the paper concerns the construction of particle physics\nmodels, aiming to explain how sterile neutrinos of keV-scale masses could arise\nin concrete settings beyond the Standard Model of elementary particle physics.\nThe paper ends with an extensive review of current and future astrophysical and\nlaboratory searches, highlighting new ideas and their experimental challenges,\nas well as future perspectives for the discovery of sterile neutrinos.\n", "  The magnetic orders in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and $\\alpha-$RuCl$_3$, honeycomb systems\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling and correlations, have been recently described\nby models with the dominant Kitaev interactions. In this work we discuss how\nthe orientation of magnetic order parameter is selected in this class of\nmodels. We show that while the order-by-disorder mechanism in the models with\nsolely Kitaev anisotropies always select cubic axes as easy axes for magnetic\nordering, the additional effect of other small bond-dependent anisotropies,\nsuch as, e.g., $\\Gamma$-terms, lead to a deviation of the order parameter from\nthe cubic directions. We show that both the zigzag ground state and the\nface-diagonal orientation of magnetic moments in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ can be obtained\nwithin the $J_1-K_1-J_2-K_2-J_3$ model in the presence of perturbatively small\n$\\Gamma$-terms. We also show that the zigzag phase found in the nearest\nneighbor Kitaev-Heisenberg model, relevant for $\\alpha-$RuCl$_3$, has some\nstability against the $\\Gamma$-term.\n", "  The so-called chaotic states that emerge on the model of $XY$ interacting on\nregular critical range networks are analyzed. Typical time scales are extracted\nfrom the time series analysis of the global magnetization. The large spectrum\nconfirms the chaotic nature of the observable, anyhow different peaks in the\nspectrum allows for typical characteristic time-scales to emerge. We find that\nthese time scales $\\tau(N)$ display a critical slowing down, i.e they diverge\nas $N\\rightarrow\\infty$. The scaling law is analyzed for different energy\ndensities and the behavior $\\tau(N)\\sim\\sqrt{N}$ is exhibited. This behavior is\nfurthermore explained analytically using the formalism of\nthermodynamic-equations of the motion and analyzing the eigenvalues of the\nadjacency matrix.\n", "  Many of exoplanetary systems consist of more than one planet and the study of\nplanetary orbits with respect to their long-term stability is very interesting.\nFurthermore, many exoplanets seem to be locked in a mean-motion resonance\n(MMR), which offers a phase protection mechanism, so that, even highly\neccentric planets can avoid close encounters. However, the present estimation\nof their initial conditions, which may change significantly after obtaining\nadditional observational data in the future, locate most of the systems in\nchaotic regions and consequently, they are destabilized. Hence, dynamical\nanalysis is imperative for the derivation of proper planetary orbital elements.\nWe utilize the model of spatial general three body problem, in order to\nsimulate such resonant systems through the computation of families periodic\norbits. In this way, we can figure out regions in phase space, where the\nplanets in resonances should be ideally hosted in favour of long-term stability\nand therefore, survival. In this review, we summarize our methodology and\nshowcase the fact that stable resonant planetary systems evolve being exactly\ncentered at stable periodic orbits. We apply this process to co-orbital motion\nand systems HD 82943, HD 73526, HD 128311, HD 60532, HD 45364 and HD 108874.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate an angularly-multiplexed holographic memory\ncapable of intrinsic generation, storage and retrieval of multiple photons,\nbased on off-resonant Raman interaction in warm rubidium-87 vapors. The memory\ncapacity of up to 60 independent atomic spin-wave modes is evidenced by\nanalyzing angular distributions of coincidences between Stokes and time-delayed\nanti-Stokes light, observed down to the level of single spin-wave excitation\nduring several-$\\mu$s memory lifetime. We also propose how to practically\nenhance rates of single and multiple photons generation by combining our\nmultimode emissive memory with existing fast optical switches.\n", "  To investigate $pn$ pair correlations in $N=Z=\\textrm{odd}$ nuclei, we\ndevelop a new framework based on the generator coordinate method of the\n$\\beta\\gamma$ constraint antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. In the framework,\nthe isospin projection is performed before the energy variation to obtain the\nwave function optimized for each isospin. We apply the method to ${}^{10}\n\\textrm{B}$ and show that it works well to describe coexistence of $T=0$ and\n$T=1$ states in low-energy spectra. Structures of low-lying states and $pn$\ncorrelations are investigated. Strong $M1$($0^+_1\\rightarrow 1^+_1$) and\n$E2$($1^+_1\\rightarrow 1^+_2$) transitions are understood by the spin\nexcitation of the $pn$ pair and the rotation of a deformed core, respectively.\n", "  Information causality states that the information obtainable by a receiver\ncannot be greater than the communication bits from a sender, even if they\nutilize no-signaling resources. This physical principle successfully explains\nsome boundaries between quantum and post-quantum nonlocal correlations, where\nthe obtainable information reaches the maximum limit. We show that no-signaling\nresources of pure partially entangled states produce randomness (or noise) in\nthe communication bits, and achievement of the maximum limit is impossible,\ni.e., the information causality principle is insufficient for the full\nidentification of the quantum boundaries already for bipartite settings. The\nnonlocality inequalities such as so-called the Tsirelson inequality are\nextended to show how such randomness affects the strength of nonlocal\ncorrelations. As a result, a relation followed by most of quantum correlations\nin the simplest Bell scenario is revealed. The extended inequalities reflect\nthe cryptographic principle such that a completely scrambled message cannot\ncarry information.\n", "  We make a thorough study of the spreading of quantum coherence (QC), as\nquantified by the $l_{1}$-norm QC, when a qubit (a two-level quantum system) is\nsubjected to noise quantum channels commonly appearing in quantum information\nscience. We notice that QC is generally not conserved and that even incoherent\ninitial states can lead to transitory system-environment QC. We show that for\nthe amplitude damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of\nlocal and non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On\nthe other hand, for the phase damping channel (PDC) entanglement does not\naccount for all non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and\nalso on the qubit's initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and\nconditions for time invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase,\nand bit-phase flip channels. Here we reveal the qualitative dynamical\ninequivalence between these channels and the PDC and show that the creation of\nsystem-environment entanglement does not necessarily imply in the destruction\nof the qubit's QC. We also investigate the resources needed for non-local QC\ncreation, showing that while the PDC requires initial coherence of the qubit,\nfor some other channels non-zero population of the excited state (i.e., energy)\nis sufficient. Related to that, considering the depolarizing channel we notice\nthe qubit's ability to act as a catalyst for the creation of joint QC and\nentanglement, without need for nonzero initial QC or excited state population.\n", "  Ge$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$ (Ge:Fe) shows ferromagnetic behavior up to a relatively\nhigh temperature of 210 K, and hence is a promising material for spintronic\napplications compatible with Si technology. We have studied its electronic\nstructure by soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SX-ARPES)\nmeasurements in order to elucidate the mechanism of the ferromagnetism. We\nobserved finite Fe 3$d$ components in the states at the Fermi level ($E_{F}$)\nin a wide region in momentum space and $E_{F}$ was located above the\nvalence-band maximum (VBM). First-principles supercell calculation also\nsuggested that the $E_{F}$ is located above the VBM, within the narrow\nspin-down $d$($e$) band and within the spin-up impurity band of the deep\nacceptor-level origin derived from the strong $p$-$d$($t_{2}$) hybridization.\nWe conclude that the narrow $d$($e$) band is responsible for the ferromagnetic\ncoupling between Fe atoms while the acceptor-level-originated band is\nresponsible for the transport properties of Ge:Fe.\n", "  We present a detailed strong lensing (SL) mass reconstruction of the core of\nthe galaxy cluster MACSJ 2129.4-0741 ($\\rm z_{cl}=0.589$) obtained by combining\nhigh-resolution HST photometry from the CLASH survey with new spectroscopic\nobservations from the CLASH-VLT survey. A background bright red passive galaxy\nat $\\rm z_{sp}=1.36$, sextuply lensed in the cluster core, has four radial\nlensed images located over the three central cluster members. Further 19\nbackground lensed galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed by our VLT survey,\nincluding 3 additional multiple systems. A total of 31 multiple images are used\nin the lensing analysis. This allows us to trace with high precision the total\nmass profile of the cluster in its very inner region ($\\rm R<100$ kpc). Our\nfinal lensing mass model reproduces the multiple images systems identified in\nthe cluster core with high accuracy of $0.4\"$. This translates to an high\nprecision mass reconstruction of MACS 2129, which is constrained at level of\n2%. The cluster has Einstein parameter $\\Theta_E=(29\\pm4)\"$, and a projected\ntotal mass of $\\rm M_{tot}(<\\Theta_E)=(1.35\\pm0.03)\\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$\nwithin such radius. Together with the cluster mass profile, we provide here\nalso the complete spectroscopic dataset for the cluster members and lensed\nimages measured with VLT/VIMOS within the CLASH-VLT survey.\n", "  Stochastic surface growth models aid in studying properties of universality\nclasses like the Kardar--Paris--Zhang class. High precision results obtained\nfrom large scale computational studies can be transferred to many physical\nsystems. Many properties, such as roughening and some two-time functions can be\nstudied using stochastic cellular automaton (SCA) variants of stochastic\nmodels. Here we present a highly efficient SCA implementation of a surface\ngrowth model capable of simulating billions of lattice sites on a single GPU.\nWe also provide insight into cases requiring arbitrary random probabilities\nwhich are not accessible through bit-vectorization.\n", "  Using finite-temperature phonon calculations and machine-learning methods, we\ncalculate the mechanical stability of about 400 semiconducting oxides and\nfluorides with cubic perovskite structures at 0 K, 300 K and 1000 K. We find 92\nmechanically stable compounds at high temperatures -- including 36 not\nmentioned in the literature so far -- for which we calculate the thermal\nconductivity. We demonstrate that the thermal conductivity is generally smaller\nin fluorides than in oxides, largely due to a lower ionic charge, and describe\nsimple structural descriptors that are correlated with its magnitude.\nFurthermore, we show that the thermal conductivities of most cubic perovskites\ndecrease more slowly than the usual $T^{-1}$ behavior. Within this set, we also\nscreen for materials exhibiting negative thermal expansion. Finally, we\ndescribe a strategy to accelerate the discovery of mechanically stable\ncompounds at high temperatures.\n", "  Tidal streams in the Milky Way are sensitive probes of the population of\ndark-matter subhalos predicted in cold-dark-matter (CDM) simulations. We\npresent a new calculus for computing the effect of subhalo fly-bys on cold\ntidal streams based on the action-angle representation of streams. The heart of\nthis calculus is a line-of-parallel-angle approach that calculates the\nperturbed distribution function of a given stream segment by undoing the effect\nof all impacts. This approach allows one to compute the perturbed stream\ndensity and track in any coordinate system in minutes for realizations of the\nsubhalo distribution down to 10^5 Msun, accounting for the stream's internal\ndispersion and overlapping impacts. We study the properties of density and\ntrack fluctuations with suites of simulations. The one-dimensional density and\ntrack power spectra along the stream trace the subhalo mass function, with\nhigher-mass subhalos producing power only on large scales, while lower mass\nsubhalos cause structure on smaller scales. The time-dependence of impacts and\nof the evolution of the stream after an impact gives rise to bispectra. We\nfurther find that tidal streams are essentially corrugated sheets in the\npresence of subhalo perturbations: different projections of the track all\nreflect the same pattern of perturbations, facilitating their observational\nmeasurement. We apply this formalism to density data for the Pal 5 stream and\nmake a first rigorous determination of 10^{+11}_{-6} dark-matter subhalos with\nmasses between 3x10^6 and 10^9 Msun within 20 kpc from the Galactic center\n(corresponding to 1.4^{+1.6}_{-0.9} times the number predicted by CDM-only\nsimulations or to f_{sub}(r<20 kpc) ~ 0.2%). Improved data will allow\nmeasurements of the subhalo mass function down to 10^5 Msun, thus definitively\ntesting whether dark matter clumps on the smallest scales relevant for galaxy\nformation.\n", "  Communities in directed networks have often been characterized as regions\nwith a high density of links, or as sets of nodes with certain patterns of\nconnection. Our approach for community detection combines the optimization of a\nquality function and a spectral clustering of a deformation of the\ncombinatorial Laplacian, the so-called magnetic Laplacian. The eigenfunctions\nof the magnetic Laplacian, that we call magnetic eigenmaps, incorporate\nstructural information. Hence, using the magnetic eigenmaps, dense communities\nincluding directed cycles can be revealed as well as \"role\" communities in\nnetworks with a running flow, usually discovered thanks to mixture models.\nFurthermore, in the spirit of the Markov stability method, an approach for\nstudying communities at different energy levels in the network is put forward,\nbased on a quantum mechanical system at finite temperature.\n", "  The long-term stability of the evolution of two-planet systems is considered\nby using the general three body problem (GTBP). Our study is focused on the\nstability of systems with adjacent orbits when at least one of them is highly\neccentric. In these cases, in order for close encounters, which destabilize the\nplanetary systems, to be avoided, phase protection mechanisms should be\nconsidered. Additionally, since the GTBP is a non-integrable system, chaos may\nalso cause the destabilization of the system after a long time interval. By\ncomputing dynamical maps, based on Fast Lyapunov Indicator, we reveal regions\nin phase space with stable orbits even for very high eccentricities (e>0.5).\nSuch regions are present in mean motion resonances (MMR). We can determine the\nposition of the exact MMR through the computation of families of periodic\norbits in a rotating frame. Elliptic periodic orbits are associated with the\npresence of apsidal corotation resonances (ACR). When such solutions are\nstable, they are associated with neighbouring domains of initial conditions\nthat provide long-term stability. We apply our methodology so that the\nevolution of planetary systems of highly eccentric orbits is assigned to the\nexistence of such stable domains. Particularly, we study the orbital evolution\nof the extrasolar systems HD 82943, HD 3651, HD 7449, HD 89744 and HD 102272\nand discuss the consistency between the orbital elements provided by the\nobservations and the dynamical stability.\n", "  Probing the polarization of water molecules at charged interfaces by second\nharmonic generation spectroscopy has been heretofore limited to isotropic\nmaterials. Here, we report non-resonant nonlinear optical measurements at the\ninterface of anisotropic z-cut {\\alpha}-quartz and water under conditions of\ndynamically changing ionic strength and bulk solution pH. We find that the\nproduct of the third-order susceptibility and the interfacial potential,\n\\c{hi}(3). {\\Phi}(0), is given by ( \\c{hi}(3)-i\\c{hi}(3)). {\\Phi}(0), and that\nthe interference between this product and the second-order susceptibility of\nbulk quartz depends on the rotation angle of {\\alpha}-quartz around the z-axis.\nOur experiments show that this newly identified term, i\\c{hi}(3). {\\Phi}(0),\nwhich is out of phase from the surface terms, is of bulk origin. The\npossibility of internally phase referencing the interfacial response for the\ninterfacial orientation analysis of species or materials in contact with\n{\\alpha}-quartz is discussed along with the implications for conditions of\nresonance enhancement.\n", "  The discretization of the density matrix is proposed as a nonlinear positive\nmap for systems with continuous variables. This procedure is used to calculate\nthe entanglement between two modes through different criteria, such as Tsallis\nentropy, von Neumann entropy and linear entropy and the logarithmic negativity.\nAs an example, we study the dynamics of entanglement for the two-mode squeezed\nvacuum state in the parametric amplifier and show good agreement with the\nanalytic results. The loss of information on the system state due to the\ndiscretization of the density matrix is also addressed.\n", "  Slow light has been widely utilized to obtain enhanced nonlinearities,\nenhanced spontaneous emissions, and increased phase shifts owing to its ability\nto promote light-matter interactions. By incorporating a graphene microheater\non a slow-light silicon photonic crystal waveguide, we experimentally\ndemonstrated an energy-efficient graphene microheater with a tuning efficiency\nof 1.07 nm/mW and power consumption per free spectral range of 3.99 mW. The\nrise and decay times (10% to 90%) were only 750 ns and 525 ns, which, to the\nbest of our knowledge, are the fastest reported response times for microheaters\nin silicon photonics. The corresponding record-low figure of merit of the\ndevice was 2.543 nW.s, which is one order of magnitude lower than results\nreported in previous studies. The influences of the graphene-photonic crystal\nwaveguide interaction length and the shape of the graphene heater were also\ninvestigated, providing valuable guidelines for enhancing the graphene\nmicroheater tuning efficiency.\n", "  We demonstrate continuous measurement and coherent control of the collective\nspin of an atomic ensemble undergoing Larmor precession in a high-finesse\noptical cavity. The coupling of the precessing spin to the cavity field yields\nphenomena similar to those observed in cavity optomechanics, including cavity\namplification, damping, and optical spring shifts. These effects arise from\nautonomous optical feedback onto the atomic spin dynamics, conditioned by the\ncavity spectrum. We use this feedback to stabilize the spin in either its high-\nor low-energy state, where, in equilibrium with measurement back-action\nheating, it achieves a steady-state temperature, indicated by an asymmetry\nbetween the Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering rates. For sufficiently large\nLarmor frequency, such feedback stabilizes the spin ensemble in a nearly pure\nquantum state, in spite of continuous measurement by the cavity field.\n", "  Electroweak (EW) corrections can be enhanced at high energies due to the soft\nor collinear radiation of virtual and real $W$ and $Z$ bosons that result in\nSudakov-like corrections of the form $\\alpha_W^l\\log^n(Q^2/M_{W,Z}^2)$, where\n$\\alpha_W =\\alpha/(4\\pi\\sin^2\\theta_W)$ and $n\\le 2l-1$. The inclusion of EW\ncorrections in predictions for hadron colliders is therefore especially\nimportant when searching for signals of possible new physics in distributions\nprobing the kinematic regime $Q^2 \\gg M_V^2$. Next-to-leading order (NLO) EW\ncorrections should also be taken into account when their size\n($\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha)$) is comparable to that of QCD corrections at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) ($\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$). To this end\nwe have implemented the NLO weak corrections to the Neutral-Current Drell-Yan\nprocess, top-quark pair production and di-jet production in the parton-level\nMonte-Carlo program MCFM. This enables a combined study with the corresponding\nQCD corrections at NLO and NNLO. We provide both the full NLO weak corrections\nand their Sudakov approximation since the latter is often used for a fast\nevaluation of weak effects at high energies and can be extended to higher\norders. With both the exact and approximate results at hand, the validity of\nthe Sudakov approximation can be readily quantified\n", "  We report on electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements of phosphorus donors\nlocalized in a 200 square micron area below the inductive wire of a lumped\nelement superconducting resonator. By combining quantum limited parametric\namplification with a low impedance microwave resonator design we are able to\ndetect around 20000 spins with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 1 in a single\nshot. The 150 Hz coupling strength between the resonator field and individual\nspins is significantly larger than the 1 - 10 Hz coupling rates obtained with\ntypical coplanar waveguide resonator designs. Due to the larger coupling rate,\nwe find that spin relaxation is dominated by radiative decay into the resonator\nand dependent upon the spin-resonator detuning, as predicted by Purcell.\n", "  A geometric understanding of entanglement is proposed based on local\nmeasurements. Taking recourse to the general structure of density matrices in\nthe framework of Euclidean geometry, we first illustrate our approach for\nbipartite Werner states. It is demonstrated that separable states satisfy\ncertain geometric constraints that entangled states do not. A separability\ncriterion for multiparty Werner states of arbitrary dimension is derived. This\napproach can be used to determine separability across any bipartition of a\ngeneral density matrix and leads naturally to a computable measure of\nentanglement for multiparty pure states. It is known that all density matrices\nwithin a certain distance of the normalized identity are separable. This\ndistance is determined for a general setting of $n$ qudits, each of dimension\n$d$.\n", "  We describe how quantum dot semiconductor cavity systems can be engineered to\nrealize anisotropy-induced dipole-dipole coupling between orthogonal dipole\nstates in a single quantum dot. Quantum dots in single-mode cavity structures\nas well as photonic crystal waveguides coupled to spin states or linearly\npolarized excitons are considered. We demonstrate pronounced dipole-dipole\ncoupling to control the radiative decay rate of excitons and form pure\nentangled states in the long time limit. We investigate both field-free\nentanglement evolution and coherently pumped exciton regimes, and show how a\ndouble pumping scenario can completely eliminate the decay of coherent Rabi\noscillations and lead to population trapping. In the Mollow regime, we explore\nthe emitted spectra from the driven dipoles and show how a non-pumped dipole\ncan take on the form of a spectral triplet, quintuplet, or a singlet, which has\napplications for producing subnatural linewidth single photons and more easily\naccessing regimes of high-field quantum optics and cavity-QED.\n", "  Observation of Higgs pair production is an important long term objective of\nthe LHC physics program as it will shed light on the scalar potential of the\nHiggs field and the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. While numerous\nstudies have examined the impact of new physics on di-Higgs production, little\nattention has been given to the well-motivated possibility of exotic Higgs\ndecays in this channel. Here we investigate the consequences of exotic\ninvisible Higgs decays in di-Higgs production. We outline a search sensitive to\nsuch invisible decays in the $b\\bar b+{\\not \\!\\! E}_T$ channel. We demonstrate\nthat probing invisible branching ratios of order 10$\\%$ during the LHC's\nhigh-luminosity run will be challenging, but in resonance enhanced di-Higgs\nproduction, this final state can become crucial to establish the existence of\nphysics beyond the Standard Model at collider energies. We also briefly discuss\nthe outlook for other exotic Higgs decay modes and the potential to observe\nsuch exotic decays in the di-Higgs channel.\n", "  We constrain the shape of the Milky Way's halo by dynamical modeling of the\nobserved phase-space tracks of the Pal 5 and GD-1 tidal streams. We find that\nthe only information about the potential gleaned from the tracks of these\nstreams are precise measurements of the shape of the gravitational\npotential---the ratio of vertical to radial acceleration---at the location of\nthe streams, with weaker constraints on the radial and vertical accelerations\nseparately. The latter will improve significantly with precise proper-motion\nmeasurements from Gaia. We measure that the overall potential flattening is\n0.95 +/- 0.04 at the location of GD-1 ([R,z] ~ [12.5,6.7] kpc) and 0.94 +/-\n0.05 at the position of Pal 5 ([R,z] ~ [8.4,16.8] kpc). Combined with\nconstraints on the force field near the Galactic disk, we determine that the\naxis ratio of the dark-matter halo's density distribution is 1.05 +/- 0.14\nwithin the inner 20 kpc, with a hint that the halo becomes more flattened near\nthe edge of this volume. The halo mass within 20 kpc is 1.1 +/- 0.1 x 10^{11}\nM_sun. A dark-matter halo this close to spherical is in tension with the\npredictions from numerical simulations of the formation of dark-matter halos.\n", "  Mounting discoveries of debris discs orbiting newly-formed stars and white\ndwarfs (WDs) showcase the importance of modeling the long-term evolution of\nsmall bodies in exosystems. WD debris discs are in particular thought to form\nfrom very long-term (0.1-5.0 Gyr) instability between planets and asteroids.\nHowever, the time-consuming nature of $N$-body integrators which accurately\nsimulate motion over Gyrs necessitates a judicious choice of initial\nconditions. The analytical tools known as \\textit{periodic orbits} can\ncircumvent the guesswork. Here, we begin a comprehensive analysis directly\nlinking periodic orbits with $N$-body integration outcomes with an extensive\nexploration of the planar circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) with\nan outer planet and inner asteroid near or inside of the $2$:$1$ mean motion\nresonance. We run nearly 1000 focused simulations for the entire age of the\nUniverse (14 Gyr) with initial conditions mapped to the phase space locations\nsurrounding the unstable and stable periodic orbits for that commensurability.\nIn none of our simulations did the planar CRTBP architecture yield a\nlong-timescale ($\\gtrsim 0.25$% of the age of the Universe) asteroid-star\ncollision. The pericentre distance of asteroids which survived beyond this\ntimescale ($\\approx 35$ Myr) varied by at most about 60%. These results help\naffirm that collisions occur too quickly to explain WD pollution in the planar\nCRTBP $2$:$1$ regime, and highlight the need for further periodic orbit studies\nwith the eccentric and inclined TBP architectures and other significant orbital\nperiod commensurabilities.\n", "  We investigate the standard model (SM) with the extension of a charged scalar\nhaving fractional electromagnetic charge of $-1/3$ unit and with lepton and\nbaryon number violating couplings at tree level. Without directly taking part\nin the electro-weak (EW) symmetry breaking, this scalar can affect stability of\nthe EW vacuum via loop effects. The impact of such a scalar, i.e., a leptoquark\non the perturbativity of SM dimensionless couplings as well as on new physics\ncouplings has been studied at two-loop order. The vacuum stability of the Higgs\npotential is checked using one-loop renormalization group (RG) improved\neffective potential approach with two-loop beta function for all the couplings.\nFrom the stability analysis various bounds are drawn on parameter space by\nidentifying the region corresponding to metastability and stability of the EW\nvacuum. Later we also address the Higgs mass fine-tuning issue via Veltman\ncondition and the presence of such scalar increases the scale up to which the\ntheory can be considered as reasonably fine-tuned. All these constraints give a\nvery predictive parameter space for leptoquark couplings which can be tested at\npresent and future colliders. Especially, a leptoquark with mass\n$\\mathcal{O}\\,$(TeV) can give rise to lepton-quark flavor violating signatures\nvia decaying into the $t\\, \\tau$ channel at tree level, which can be tested at\nthe LHC or future colliders.\n", "  In classical hydrodynamics with uniform density, vortices move with the local\nfluid velocity. This description is rewritten in terms of forces arising from\nthe interaction with other vortices. Two such positive straight vortices\nexperience a repulsive interaction and precess in a positive (anticlockwise)\nsense around their common centroid. A similar picture applies to vortices in a\ntwo-component two-dimensional uniform Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) coherently\ncoupled through rf Rabi fields. Unlike the classical case, however, the rf Rabi\ncoupling induces an attractive interaction and two such vortices with positive\nsigns now rotate in the negative (clockwise) sense. Pairs of counter-rotating\nvortices are instead found to translate with uniform velocity perpendicular to\nthe line joining their cores. This picture is extended to a single vortex in a\ntwo-component trapped BEC. Although two uniform vortex-free components\nexperience familiar Rabi oscillations of particle-number difference, such\nbehavior is absent for a vortex in one component because of the nonuniform\nvortex phase. Instead the coherent Rabi coupling induces a periodic vorticity\ntransfer between the two components.\n", "  Several fast methods for computing stellarator coil shapes are compared,\nincluding the classical NESCOIL procedure [Merkel, Nucl. Fusion 27, 867\n(1987)], its generalization using truncated singular value decomposition, and a\nTikhonov regularization approach we call REGCOIL in which the squared current\ndensity is included in the objective function. Considering W7-X and NCSX\ngeometries, and for any desired level of regularization, we find the REGCOIL\napproach simultaneously achieves lower surface-averaged and maximum values of\nboth current density (on the coil winding surface) and normal magnetic field\n(on the desired plasma surface). This approach therefore can simultaneously\nimprove the free-boundary reconstruction of the target plasma shape while\nsubstantially increasing the minimum distances between coils, preventing\ncollisions between coils while improving access for ports and maintenance. The\nREGCOIL method also allows finer control over the level of regularization, it\npreserves convexity to ensure the local optimum found is the global optimum,\nand it eliminates two pathologies of NESCOIL: the resulting coil shapes become\nindependent of the arbitrary choice of angles used to parameterize the coil\nsurface, and the resulting coil shapes converge rather than diverge as Fourier\nresolution is increased. We therefore contend that REGCOIL should be used\ninstead of NESCOIL for applications in which a fast and robust method for coil\ncalculation is needed, such as when targeting coil complexity in fixed-boundary\nplasma optimization, or for scoping new stellarator geometries.\n", "  This paper reviews results from the study of wall-bounded turbulent flows\nusing statistical state dynamics (SSD) that demonstrate the benefits of\nadopting this perspective for understanding turbulence in wall-bounded shear\nflows. The SSD approach used in this work employs a second-order closure which\nisolates the interaction between the streamwise mean and the equivalent of the\nperturbation covariance. This closure restricts nonlinearity in the SSD to that\nexplicitly retained in the streamwise constant mean together with nonlinear\ninteractions between the mean and the perturbation covariance. This dynamical\nrestriction, in which explicit perturbation-perturbation nonlinearity is\nremoved from the perturbation equation, results in a simplified dynamics\nreferred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) dynamics. RNL systems in which an\nensemble of a finite number of realizations of the perturbation equation share\nthe same mean flow provide tractable approximations to the equivalently\ninfinite ensemble RNL system. The infinite ensemble system, referred to as the\nS3T, introduces new analysis tools for studying turbulence. The RNL with a\nsingle ensemble member can be alternatively viewed as a realization of RNL\ndynamics. RNL systems provide computationally efficient means to approximate\nthe SSD, producing self-sustaining turbulence exhibiting qualitative features\nsimilar to those observed in direct numerical simulations (DNS) despite its\ngreatly simplified dynamics. Finally, we show that RNL turbulence can be\nsupported by as few as a single streamwise varying component interacting with\nthe streamwise constant mean flow and that judicious selection of this\ntruncated support, or \"band-limiting\", can be used to improve quantitative\naccuracy of RNL turbulence. The results suggest that the SSD approach provides\nnew analytical and computational tools allowing new insights into\nwall-turbulence.\n", "  We present The-wiZZ, an open source and user-friendly software for estimating\nthe redshift distributions of photometric galaxies with unknown redshifts by\nspatially cross-correlating them against a reference sample with known\nredshifts. The main benefit of The-wiZZ is in separating the angular pair\nfinding and correlation estimation from the computation of the output\nclustering redshifts allowing anyone to create a clustering redshift for their\nsample without the intervention of an \"expert\". It allows the end user of a\ngiven survey to select any sub-sample of photometric galaxies with unknown\nredshifts, match this sample's catalog indices into a value-added data file,\nand produce a clustering redshift estimation for this sample in a fraction of\nthe time it would take to run all the angular correlations needed to produce a\nclustering redshift. We show results with this software using photometric data\nfrom the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and spectroscopic redshifts from the Galaxy\nand Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The\nresults we present for KiDS are consistent with the redshift distributions used\nin a recent cosmic shear analysis from the survey. We also present results\nusing a hybrid machine learning-clustering redshift analysis that enables the\nestimation of clustering redshifts for individual galaxies. The-wiZZ can be\ndownloaded at http://github.com/morriscb/The-wiZZ/.\n", "  We study the effects of Horndeski models of dark energy on the observables of\nthe large-scale structure in the late time universe. A novel classification\ninto {\\it Late dark energy}, {\\it Early dark energy} and {\\it Early modified\ngravity} scenarios is proposed, according to whether such models predict\ndeviations from the standard paradigm persistent at early time in the matter\ndomination epoch. We discuss the physical imprints left by each specific class\nof models on the effective Newton constant $\\mu$, the gravitational slip\nparameter $\\eta$, the light deflection parameter $\\Sigma$ and the growth\nfunction $f\\sigma_8$ and demonstrate that a convenient way to dress a complete\nportrait of the viability of the Horndeski accelerating mechanism is via two,\nredshift-dependent, diagnostics: the $\\mu(z)-\\Sigma(z)$ and the\n$f\\sigma_8(z)-\\Sigma(z)$ planes. If future, model-independent, measurements\npoint to either $\\Sigma-1<0$ at redshift zero or $\\mu-1<0$ with $\\Sigma-1>0$ at\nhigh redshifts or $\\mu-1>0$ with $\\Sigma-1<0$ at high redshifts, Horndeski\ntheories are effectively ruled out. If $f\\sigma_8$ is measured to be larger\nthan expected in a $\\Lambda$CDM model at $z>1.5$ then Early dark energy models\nare definitely ruled out. On the opposite case, Late dark energy models are\nrejected by data if $\\Sigma<1$, while, if $\\Sigma>1$, only Early modifications\nof gravity provide a viable framework to interpret data.\n", "  We report on the first results from a new microwave cavity search for dark\nmatter axions with masses above $20~\\mu\\text{eV}$. We exclude axion models with\ntwo-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma} \\gtrsim 2\\times10^{-14}~\\text{GeV}^{-1}$\nover the range $23.55~\\mu\\text{eV} < m_a < 24.0~\\mu\\text{eV}$. These results\nrepresent two important achievements. First, we have reached cosmologically\nrelevant sensitivity an order of magnitude higher in mass than any existing\nlimits. Second, by incorporating a dilution refrigerator and Josephson\nparametric amplifier, we have demonstrated total noise approaching the standard\nquantum limit for the first time in an axion search.\n", "  Charged particles with low kinetic energy move along magnetic field lines,\nbut so do not energetic particles. We investigate the topological structure\nchanges in the phase space of energetic particles with respect to the magnetic\none. For this study cylindrical magnetic fields with non-monotonic safety\nfactors that induce the magnetic internal transport barrier are considered. We\nshow that the topological structure of the magnetic field line and of the\nparticle trajectories can be quite different. We explain this difference using\nthe concept of effective particle $q$-profile. Using this notion we can\ninvestigate the location and existence of resonances for particle orbits that\nare different from the magnetic ones. These are examined both numerically by\nintegrating an equation of motion and theoretically by use of Alfv\\'en's\nguiding center theory and by use of the effective reduced Hamiltonian for the\nintegrable unperturbed system. It is clarified that, for the energetic\nparticles, the grad $B$ drift effect shifts the resonances and the drift\ninduced by curvature of the magnetic field line leads to the vanishing of the\nresonances. As a result, we give two different mechanisms that lead to the\ncreation of transport barriers for energetic particles in the region where the\nmagnetic field line is chaotic.\n", "  This manuscript presents information for all supernovae discovered by the\nAll-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) during 2015, its second full\nyear of operations. The same information is presented for bright ($m_V\\leq17$),\nspectroscopically confirmed supernovae discovered by other sources in 2015. As\nwith the first ASAS-SN bright supernova catalog, we also present redshifts and\nnear-UV through IR magnitudes for all supernova host galaxies in both samples.\nCombined with our previous catalog, this work comprises a complete catalog of\n455 supernovae from multiple professional and amateur sources, allowing for\npopulation studies that were previously impossible. This is the second of a\nseries of yearly papers on bright supernovae and their hosts from the ASAS-SN\nteam.\n", "  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of the high magnetic field (H) part of\nthe Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC) phase of the quasi-onedimensional (quasi-1D)\nantiferromagnetic quantum spin-chain compound NiCl2-4SC(NH2)2 (DTN) was\nperformed. We precisely determined the phase boundary, Tc(H), down to 40 mK;\nthe critical boson density, n_c(Tc); and the absolute value of the BEC order\nparameter S_perp at very low temperature (T = 0.12 K). All results are\naccurately reproduced by numerical quantum Monte Carlo simulations of a\nrealistic three-dimensional (3D) model Hamiltonian. Approximate analytical\npredictions based on the 1D Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid description are found to\nbe precise for Tc(H), but less so for S_perp(H), which is more sensitive to the\nstrength of 3D couplings, in particular close to the critical field. A\nmean-field treatment, based on the Hartree-Fock-Popov description, is found to\nbe valid only up to n_c = 4% (T < 0.3 K), while for higher n_c boson\ninteractions appear to modify the density of states.\n", "  An asymptotic analysis is used to derive a set of diffusion approximations to\nthe nonclassical transport equation with isotropic scattering. These\napproximations are shown to reduce to the simplified P$_N$ equations under the\nassumption of classical transport, and therefore are labeled nonclassical\nSP$_N$ equations. In addition, the nonclassical SP$_N$ equations can be\nmanipulated into a classical form with modified parameters, which can be\nimplemented in existing SP$_N$ codes. Numerical results are presented for an\none-dimensional random periodic system, validating the theoretical predictions.\n", "  We demonstrate a hybrid device architecture where the charge states in a\ndouble quantum dot (DQD) formed in a Si/SiGe heterostructure are read out using\nan on-chip superconducting microwave cavity. A quality factor Q = 5,400 is\nachieved by selectively etching away regions of the quantum well and by\nreducing photon losses through low-pass filtering of the gate bias lines.\nHomodyne measurements of the cavity transmission reveal DQD charge stability\ndiagrams and a charge-cavity coupling rate g_c/2pi = 23 MHz. These measurements\nindicate that electrons trapped in a Si DQD can be effectively coupled to\nmicrowave photons, potentially enabling coherent electron-photon interactions\nin silicon.\n", "  In this paper, we address the issue of linear stability of Schwarzschild\nspace- time subject to certain axisymmetric perturbations. In particular, we\nprove that associ- ated solutions to the linearized vacuum Einstein equations\ncentered at a Schwarzschild metric, with suitably regular initial data, decay\nto a linearized Kerr metric. Our method employs a complex line bundle\ninterpretation applied to a connection-level object, allow- ing for direct\nanalysis of this connection-level object by the linearized Einstein equations,\nin contrast with the recent breakthrough of Dafermos-Holzegel-Rodnianski.\n", "  Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology,\nespecially image, text and speech recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate\nhow a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT\ncalculations can learn an accurate and fully transferable potential for organic\nmolecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular\nEnergies) or ANI in short. ANI is a new method and procedure for training\nneural network potentials that utilizes a highly modified version of the Behler\nand Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment\nvectors as a molecular representation. We utilize ANI to build a potential\ncalled ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8\nheavy atoms to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four\natom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant\nsampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also propose a Normal Mode\nSampling (NMS) method for generating molecular configurations. Through a series\nof case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to\nreference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms)\nthan those included in the training data set, with root mean square errors as\nlow as 0.56 kcal/mol.\n", "  In this second paper of a two part series, we present extensive benchmark\nresults for two different inchworm Monte Carlo expansions for the spin-boson\nmodel. Our results are compared to previously developed numerically exact\napproaches for this problem. A detailed discussion of convergence and error\npropagation is presented. Our results and analysis allow for an understanding\nof the benefits and drawbacks of inchworm Monte Carlo compared to other\napproaches for exact real-time non-adiabatic quantum dynamics.\n", "  In this paper we provide a detailed description of the inchworm Monte Carlo\nformalism for the exact study of real-time non-adiabatic dynamics. This method\noptimally recycles Monte Carlo information from earlier times to greatly\nsuppress the dynamical sign problem. Using the example of the spin-boson model,\nwe formulate the inchworm expansion in two distinct ways: The first with\nrespect to an expansion in the system-bath coupling and the second as an\nexpansion in the diabatic coupling. The latter approach motivates the\ndevelopment of a cumulant version of the inchworm Monte Carlo method, which has\nthe benefit of improved scaling. This paper deals completely with methodology,\nwhile Paper II provides a comprehensive comparison of the performance of the\ninchworm Monte Carlo algorithms to other exact methodologies as well as a\ndiscussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.\n", "  In this joint experimental and theoretical work magnetic properties of the\nCu$^{2+}$ mineral szenicsite Cu$_3$(MoO$_4$)(OH)$_4$ are investigated. This\ncompound features isolated triple chains in its crystal structure, where the\ncentral chain involves an edge-sharing geometry of the CuO$_4$ plaquettes,\nwhile the two side chains feature a corner-sharing zig-zag geometry. The\nmagnetism of the side chains can be described in terms of antiferromagnetic\ndimers with a coupling larger than 200 K. The central chain was found to be a\nrealization of the frustrated antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ chain model with\n$J_1\\simeq 68$ K and a sizable second-neighbor coupling $J_2$. The central and\nside chains are nearly decoupled owing to interchain frustration. Therefore,\nthe low-temperature behavior of szenicsite should be entirely determined by the\nphysics of the central frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ chain. Our heat-capacity\nmeasurements reveal an accumulation of entropy at low temperatures and suggest\na proximity of the system to the Majumdar-Ghosh point of the antiferromagnetic\n$J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain, $J_2/J_1=0.5$.\n", "  Recently a new class of asymptotically AdS ultra-spinning black holes has\nbeen constructed with a noncompact horizon of finite area [1], in which the\nasymptotic rotation is effectively boosted to the speed of light. We employ\nthis technique for four-dimensional $U(1)^4$ and five-dimensional $U(1)^3$\ngauged supergravity black holes. The obtained new exact black hole solutions\nfor both cases possess a noncompact horizon; their topologies are a sphere with\ntwo punctures. We then demonstrate that the ultra-spinning limit commutes with\nthe extremality condition as well as the near horizon limit for both black\nholes. We also show that the near horizon extremal geometries of the resulting\nultra-spinning gauged supergravity black holes lead to the well-known result\nwhich contains an AdS$_2$ throat. We then obtain the $[(d-1)/2]$ central\ncharges of the dual CFTs. By assuming the Cardy formula, we show that despite\nthe noncompactness of the horizon, microscopic entropy of the dual CFT is\nprecisely equivalent to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  In this paper, we report the results of a high pressure study of the\nitinerant 5f-electron ferromagnet UCoGa. The work is focused on probing the\nexpected ferromagnet-to-paramagnet quantum phase transition induced by high\npressure and on the general features of the P-T(-H) phase diagram. Diamond\nanvil cells were employed to measure the magnetization and electrical\nresistivity under pressures up to ~ 10 GPa.At ambient pressure, UCoGa exhibits\ncollinear ferromagnetic ordering of uranium magnetic moments {\\mu}U ~ 0.74\n{\\mu}B (at 2 K) aligned along the c-axis of the hexagonal crystal structure\nbelow Curie temperature TC = 48K. With the application of pressure, gradual\ndecrease of both, TC and the saturated magnetic moment, has been observed up to\npressures ~ 6 GPa. This is followed by a sharp drop of magnetic moment and a\nsudden disappearance of the magnetic order at the pressure of 6.5 GPa,\nsuggesting a first-order phase transition, as expected for a clean system. The\nlow temperature power law dependence of the electrical resistivity shows\ndistinct anomalies around the ~ 6 GPa, consistent with the pressure evolution\nof the magnetic moment and the ordering temperature. The tricritical point of\nthe UCoGa phase diagram is located at approximately ~ 30 K and ~ 6 GPa.\n", "  We describe the kinematics of circumgalactic gas near the galactic plane,\ncombining new measurements of galaxy rotation curves and spectroscopy of\nbackground quasars. The sightlines pass within 19--93 kpc of the target galaxy\nand generally detect Mg II absorption. The Mg II Doppler shifts have the same\nsign as the galactic rotation, so the cold gas co-rotates with the galaxy.\nBecause the absorption spans a broader velocity range than disk rotation can\nexplain, we explore simple models for the circumgalactic kinematics. Gas\nspiraling inwards (near the disk plane) offers a successful description of the\nobservations. An Appendix describes the addition of tangential and radial gas\nflows and illustrates how the sign of the disk inclination produces testable\ndifferences in the projected line-of-sight velocity range. This inflow\ninterpretation implies that cold flow disks remain common down to redshift $z\n\\approx 0.2$ and prolong star formation by supplying gas to the disk.\n", "  We investigate the ground state nature of the transverse field Ising model on\nthe $J_1-J_2$ square lattice at the highly frustrated point $J_2/J_1=0.5$. At\nzero field, the model has an exponentially large degenerate classical ground\nstate, which can be affected by quantum fluctuations for non-zero field toward\na unique quantum ground state. We consider two types of quantum fluctuations,\nharmonic ones by using linear spin wave theory (LSWT) with single-spin flip\nexcitations above a long range magnetically ordered background and anharmonic\nfluctuations, by employing a cluster-operator approach (COA) with multi-spin\ncluster type fluctuations above a non-magnetic cluster ordered background. Our\nfindings reveal that the harmonic fluctuations of LSWT fail to lift the\nextensive degeneracy as well as signaling a violation of the Hellmann-Feynman\ntheorem. However, the string-type anharmonic fluctuations of COA are able to\nlift the degeneracy toward a string-valence bond solid (VBS) state, which is\nobtained from an effective theory consistent with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem\nas well. Our results are further confirmed by implementing numerical tree\ntensor network simulation. The emergent non-magnetic string-VBS phase is gapped\nand breaks lattice rotational symmetry with only two-fold degeneracy, which\nbears a continuous quantum phase transition at $\\Gamma/J_1 \\cong 0.50$ to the\nquantum paramagnet phase of high fields. The critical behavior is characterized\nby $\\nu \\cong 1.0$ and $\\gamma \\cong 0.33$ exponents.\n", "  The wetting properties of graphene have proven controversial and difficult to\nassess. The presence of a graphene layer on top of a substrate does not\nsignificantly change the wetting properties of the solid substrate, suggesting\nthat a single graphene layer does not affect the adhesion between the wetting\nphase and the substrate. However, wetting experiments of water on graphene show\ncontact angles that imply a large amount of adhesion. Here, we investigate the\nwetting of graphene by measuring the mass of water vapor adsorbing to graphene\nflakes of different thickness at different relative humidities. Our experiments\nunambiguously show that the thinnest of graphene flakes do not adsorb water,\nfrom which it follows that the contact angle of water on these flakes is ~180o.\nThicker flakes of graphene nanopowder, on the other hand, do adsorb water. A\ncalculation of the van der Waals (vdW) interactions that dominate the\nadsorption in this system confirms that the adhesive interactions between a\nsingle atomic layer of graphene and water are so weak that graphene is\nsuperhydrophobic. The observations are confirmed in an independent experiment\non graphene-coated water droplets that shows that it is impossible to make\nliquid 'marbles' with molecularly thin graphene.\n", "  In the calculation of quantum-mechanical singular-potential scattering, one\nencounters divergence. We suggest three renormalization schemes, dimensional\nrenormalization, analytic continuation approach, and minimal-subtraction scheme\nto remove the divergence.\n", "  Within nonlocal elastic interaction between an adsorbed atom and matrix atoms\nand in consideration of the mirror image forces, a dispersion law of elastic\nsurface acoustic waves is found to the long-wavelength approximation depending\non the concentration of adsorbed atoms and the deformation potential of the\nadatom. The energy width of the surface acoustic mode is calculated depending\non the concentration of adsorbed atoms.\n", "  Using magneto-infrared spectroscopy, we have explored the charge dynamics of\n(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films on InP substrates. From the magneto-transmission\ndata we extracted three distinct cyclotron resonance (CR) energies that are all\napparent in the broad band Faraday rotation (FR) spectra. This comprehensive\nFR-CR data set has allowed us to isolate the response of the bulk states from\nthe intrinsic surface states associated with both the top and bottom surfaces\nof the film. The FR data uncovered that electron- and hole-type Dirac fermions\nreside on opposite surfaces of our films, which paves the way for observing\nmany exotic quantum phenomena in topological insulators.\n", "  We measured electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of 14N- and\n15N-labeled perdeuterated TEMPONE radicals in normal and supercooled water at\nvarious radical concentrations. By fitting the EPR spectra to spectral shape\nfunctions based on the modified Bloch equations, we obtained concentration\ndependences of EPR parameters of radicals at each measured temperature. From\nconcentration dependences of the EPR parameters quantifying spin dephasing,\ncoherence transfer, and hyperfine splitting, we determined linear concentration\ncoefficients, whose values depend on the relative motion of radicals due to\nmodulation of the Heisenberg spin exchange (HSE) and dipole-dipole (DD)\ninteractions between them. We applied the continuous diffusion model for\nrelative motion of radicals and we evaluated the diffusion coefficients of\nradicals from the concentration coefficients using the standard relations and\nthe relations derived from kinetic equations for the spin evolution of\ninteracting radical pair. It was found that the latter equations lead to the\nbetter agreement between the diffusion coefficients calculated from different\nconcentration coefficients. The calculated diffusion coefficients of 14N- and\n15N-labeled radicals show similar values, which is an expected result that\nsupports the presented method. Upon lowering the temperature into the\nsupercooled state, the calculated diffusion coefficients decrease slower than\nis predicted by the Stokes-Einstein relation and slower than the rotational\ndiffusion coefficient. Similar effects were detected in NMR studies of the\nrotational and translational motion of water molecules in supercooled water.\n", "  Tunka-Rex is detector for radio emission produced by cosmic-ray air-showers\nlocated in Siberia, triggered by Tunka-133, a co-located air-Cherenkov detector\nduring night, and by a scintillator array Tunka-Grande during day. Tunka-Rex\ndemonstrates that the radio technique can provide a cost-effective extension of\nexisting air-shower arrays. Operating in the frequency range of 30-80 MHz,\nTunka-Rex is limited by the galactic background, and suffers from the local\nradio interferences. We investigate the possibilities of the improving of\nmeasured data using different approaches, particularly, the multivariate\nbackground suppression is considered, as well as improved likelihood fit of the\nlateral distribution of amplitudes.\n", "  Based on a Dirac-like Hamiltonian and coherent scattering formalism, we study\nspin-valley transport and Goos-H\\\"{a}nchen like (GHL) effect of transmitted and\nreflected electrons in a gated monolayer WS$_2$. Our results show that the\nlateral shift of spin-polarized electrons is strongly dependent on the width of\nthe gated region and can be positive or negative in both Klein tunneling and\nclassical motion regimes. The absolute values of the lateral displacements at\nresonance positions can be considerably enhanced when the incident angle of\nelectrons is close to the critical angle. In contrast to the time reversal\nsymmetry for the transmitted electrons, the GHL shift of the reflected beams is\nnot invariant under simultaneous interchange of spins and valleys, indicating\nthe lack of spin-valley symmetry induced by the tunable potential barrier on\nWS$_2$ monolayer. Our findings provide evidence for electrical control of\nvalley filtering and valley beam splitting by tuning the incident angle of\nelectrons in nanoelectronic devices based on monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides.\n", "  We theoretically study the competition among different electronic phases in\nmolecular conductors $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X. The ground-state properties of a\n3/4-filled extended Hubbard model with the $\\kappa$-type geometry are\ninvestigated by a variational Monte Carlo method. We find various competing\nphases: dimer-Mott insulator, polar charge-ordered insulator, 3-fold\ncharge-ordered metal, and superconductivity, whose pairing symmetry is an\n\"extended-$s$+$d_{x^2-y^2}$\"-wave type. Our results show that the\nsuperconducting phase is stabilized not on the verge of the Mott\nmetal-insulator transition but near charge order instabilities, clearly\nindicating the importance of the intradimer charge degree of freedom and the\nintermolecular Coulomb interactions, beyond the simple description of the\nhalf-filled Hubbard model.\n", "  Wheeled planetary rovers such as the Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs) and Mars\nScience Laboratory (MSL) have provided unprecedented, detailed images of the\nMars surface. However, these rovers are large and are of high-cost as they need\nto carry sophisticated instruments and science laboratories. We propose the\ndevelopment of low-cost planetary rovers that are the size and shape of\ncantaloupes and that can be deployed from a larger rover. The rover named\nSphereX is 2 kg in mass, is spherical, holonomic and contains a hopping\nmechanism to jump over rugged terrain. A small low-cost rover complements a\nlarger rover, particularly to traverse rugged terrain or roll down a canyon,\ncliff or crater to obtain images and science data. While it may be a one-way\njourney for these small robots, they could be used tactically to obtain\nhigh-reward science data. The robot is equipped with a pair of stereo cameras\nto perform visual navigation and has room for a science payload. In this paper,\nwe analyze the design and development of a laboratory prototype. The results\nshow a promising pathway towards development of a field system.\n", "  Monolayer semiconductors of group-VA elements (As, Sb, Bi) with graphenelike\nbuckled structure offer a potential to achieve nanoscale electronic,\noptoelectronic and thermoelectric devices. Motivated by recently-fabricated Sb\nmonolayer, we systematically investigate the thermoelectric properties of\n$\\beta$-As, Sb and Bi monolayers by combining the first-principles calculations\nand semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The generalized gradient\napproximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is adopted for the electron\npart, and GGA is employed for the phonon part. It is found that SOC has\nimportant influences on their electronic structures, especially for Bi\nmonolayer, which can induce observable SOC effects on electronic transport\ncoefficients. More specifically, SOC not only has detrimental influences on\nelectronic transport coefficients, but also produces enhanced effects. The\ncalculated lattice thermal conductivity decreases gradually from As to Bi\nmonolayer, and the corresponding room-temperature sheet thermal conductance is\n161.10 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$, 46.62 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ and 16.02 $\\mathrm{W\nK^{-1}}$, which can be converted into common lattice thermal conductivity by\ndividing by the thickness of 2D material. The sheet thermal conductance of Bi\nmonolayer is lower than one of other 2D materials, such as semiconducting\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers and orthorhombic group IV-VI\nmonolayers. A series of scattering time is employed to estimate the\nthermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$. It is found that the n-type doping has\nmore excellent thermoelectric properties than p-type doping for As and Bi\nmonolayer, while the comparative $ZT$ between n- and p-type doping is observed\nin Bi monolayer. These results can stimulate further experimental works to open\nthe new field for thermoelectric devices based on monolayer of group-VA\nelements.\n", "  We introduce a microstructure informatics dataset focusing on complex,\nhierarchical structures found in a single Ultrahigh carbon steel under a range\nof heat treatments. Applying image representations from contemporary computer\nvision research to these microstructures, we discuss how both supervised and\nunsupervised machine learning techniques can be used to yield insight into\nmicrostructural trends and their relationship to processing conditions. We\nevaluate and compare keypoint-based and convolutional neural network\nrepresentations by classifying microstructures according to their primary\nmicroconstituent, and by classifying a subset of the microstructures according\nto the annealing conditions that generated them. Using t-SNE, a nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction and visualization technique, we demonstrate graphical\nmethods of exploring microstructure and processing datasets, and for\nunderstanding and interpreting high-dimensional microstructure representations.\n", "  In the past years we have witnessed the emergence of the new discipline of\ncomputational social science, which promotes a new data-driven and\ncomputation-based approach to social sciences. In this article we discuss how\nthe availability of new technologies such as online social media and mobile\nsmartphones has allowed researchers to passively collect human behavioral data\nat a scale and a level of granularity that were just unthinkable some years\nago. We also discuss how these digital traces can then be used to prove (or\ndisprove) existing theories and develop new models of human behavior.\n", "  Since the discovery of nuclear gamma-rays, its imaging has been limited to\npseudo imaging, such as Compton Camera (CC) and coded mask. Pseudo imaging does\nnot keep physical information (intensity, or brightness in Optics) along a ray,\nand thus is capable of no more than qualitative imaging of bright objects. To\nattain quantitative imaging, cameras that realize geometrical optics is\nessential, which would be, for nuclear MeV gammas, only possible via complete\nreconstruction of the Compton process. Recently we have revealed that \"Electron\nTracking Compton Camera\" (ETCC) provides a well-defined Point Spread Function\n(PSF). The information of an incoming gamma is kept along a ray with the PSF\nand that is equivalent to geometrical optics. Here we present an\nimaging-spectroscopic measurement with the ETCC. Our results highlight the\nintrinsic difficulty with CCs in performing accurate imaging, and show that the\nETCC surmounts this problem. The imaging capability also helps the ETCC\nsuppress the noise level dramatically by ~3 orders of magnitude without a\nshielding structure. Furthermore, full reconstruction of Compton process with\nthe ETCC provides spectra free of Compton edges. These results mark the first\nproper imaging of nuclear gammas based on the genuine geometrical optics.\n", "  We have developed an Electron Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC), which provides\na well-defined Point Spread Function (PSF) by reconstructing a direction of\neach gamma as a point and realizes simultaneous measurement of brightness and\nspectrum of MeV gamma-rays for the first time. Here, we present the results of\nour on-site pilot gamma-imaging-spectroscopy with ETCC at three contaminated\nlocations in the vicinity of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants in\nJapan in 2014. The obtained distribution of brightness (or emissivity) with\nremote-sensing observations is unambiguously converted into the dose\ndistribution. We confirm that the dose distribution is consistent with the one\ntaken by conventional mapping measurements with a dosimeter physically placed\nat each grid point. Furthermore, its imaging spectroscopy, boosted by\nCompton-edge-free spectra, reveals complex radioactive features in a\nquantitative manner around each individual target point in the\nbackground-dominated environment. Notably, we successfully identify a \"micro\nhot spot\" of residual caesium contamination even in an already decontaminated\narea. These results show that the ETCC performs exactly as the geometrical\noptics predicts, demonstrates its versatility in the field radiation\nmeasurement, and reveals potentials for application in many fields, including\nthe nuclear industry, medical field, and astronomy.\n", "  Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark have famously speculated that the Level I\nMultiverse is the same as the Level III Multiverse. By this, they mean that the\nparallel universes of the Level III Multiverse can be regarded as similar or\nidentical copies of our own Hubble volume distributed throughout the whole of\nour (possibly infinite) bubble universe. However, we show that our bubble\nuniverse is in a single quantum eigenstate that extends to regions of space\nthat are receding from each other at superluminal velocities because of general\nrelativistic expansion. Such a bubble universe cannot accommodate Hubble\nvolumes in the different orthogonal eigenstates required by the Level III\nMultiverse. Instead, quantum uncertainty arises from large numbers of\nalternative bubble universes in Hilbert space, isolated from each other. The\nconclusion of the paper is that the Level I Multiverse is not the same as the\nLevel III Multiverse.\n", "  The mechanical response of solid particles dispersed in a Newtonian fluid\nexhibits a wide range of nonlinear phenomena including a dramatic increase in\nthe viscosity \\cite{1-3} with increasing stress. If the volume fraction of the\nsolid phase is moderately high, the suspension will undergo continuous shear\nthickening (CST), where the suspension viscosity increases smoothly with\napplied shear stress; at still higher volume fractions the suspension can\ndisplay discontinuous shear thickening (DST), where the viscosity changes\nabruptly over several orders of magnitude upon increasing applied stress.\nProposed models to explain this phenomenon are based in two distinct types of\nparticle interactions, hydrodynamic\\cite{2,4,5} and frictional\\cite{6-10}. In\nboth cases, the increase in the bulk viscosity is attributed to some form of\nlocalized clustering\\cite{11,12}. However, the physical properties and\ndynamical behavior of these heterogeneities remains unclear. Here we show that\ncontinuous shear thickening originates from dynamic localized well defined\nregions of particles with a high viscosity that increases rapidly with\nconcentration. Furthermore, we find that the spatial extent of these regions is\nlargely determined by the distance between the shearing surfaces. Our results\ndemonstrate that continuous shear thickening arises from increasingly frequent\nlocalized discontinuous transitions between coexisting low and high viscosity\nNewtonian fluid phases. Our results provide a critical physical link between\nthe microscopic dynamical processes that determine particle interactions and\nbulk rheological response of shear thickened fluids.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that there are discrepancies between observations\nand the theoretical predictions in some neutrino experiments at short\ndistances. In the so-called \"Reactor Antineutrino Anomaly\" and in the \"Gallium\nAnomaly\", these differences from the expectations are at the $\\sim$3 $\\sigma$\nlevel in both cases. Oscillations into a light sterile neutrino state ($\\Delta\nm^{2} \\sim 1eV^{2}$) could account for the deficits in observed rates. The\nSTEREO experiment has been conceived to confirm or reject the sterile neutrino\nhypothesis. It will search for an oscillation pattern at short baselines (9-11\nm) in the energy spectrum of the antineutrinos emitted by the research nuclear\nreactor of the Institut Laue Langevin. To this end, the detector is filled with\ntwo tons of Gd-loaded liquid scintillator read out by an array of PMTs and is\nsegmented into 6 cells in the direction of the antineutrino's propagation.\nSTEREO should be capable of excluding the best fit parameters region of a\ncandidate sterile neutrino at 5 $\\sigma$. Data taking will start at the end of\n2016 and the first physics results are expected by the first semester of 2017.\n", "  We propose that Borcherds' Fake Monster Lie algebra is a broken symmetry of\nheterotic string theory compactified on $T^7 \\times T^2$. As evidence, we study\nthe fully flavored counting function for BPS instantons contributing to a\ncertain loop amplitude. The result is controlled by $\\Phi_{12}$, an automorphic\nform for $O(2, 26, \\mathbb{Z})$. The degeneracies it encodes in its Fourier\ncoefficients are graded dimensions of a second-quantized Fock space for this\nlarge symmetry algebra. This construction provides a concrete realization of\nHarvey and Moore's proposed relationship between Generalized Kac-Moody\nsymmetries and supersymmetric string vacua.\n", "  Tidal disruption events (TDEs), in which stars are gravitationally disrupted\nas they pass close to the supermassive black holes in the centres of galaxies,\nare potentially important probes of strong gravity and accretion physics. Most\nTDEs have been discovered in large-area monitoring surveys of many 1000s of\ngalaxies, and the rate deduced for such events is relatively low: one event\nevery 10$^4$ - 10$^5$ years per galaxy. However, given the selection effects\ninherent in such surveys, considerable uncertainties remain about the\nconditions that favour TDEs. Here we report the detection of unusually strong\nand broad helium emission lines following a luminous optical flare (Mv < -20.1\nmag) in the nucleus of the nearby ultra-luminous infrared galaxy F01004-2237.\nThe particular combination of variability and post-flare emission line spectrum\nobserved in F01004-2237 is unlike any known supernova or active galactic\nnucleus. Therefore, the most plausible explanation for this phenomenon is a TDE\n-- the first detected in a galaxy with an ongoing massive starburst. The fact\nthat this event has been detected in repeat spectroscopic observations of a\nsample of 15 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies over a period of just 10 years\nsuggests that the rate of TDEs is much higher in such objects than in the\ngeneral galaxy population.\n", "  In this paper we estimate the fidelity of stabilizer and CSS codes. First, we\nderive a lower bound on the fidelity of a stabilizer code via its quantum\nenumerator. Next, we find the average quantum enumerators of the ensembles of\nfinite length stabilizer and CSS codes. We use the average quantum enumerators\nfor obtaining lower bounds on the average fidelity of these ensembles. We\nfurther improve the fidelity bounds by estimating the quantum enumerators of\nexpurgated ensembles of stabilizer and CSS codes. Finally, we derive fidelity\nbounds in the asymptotic regime when the code length tends to infinity.\n  These results tell us which code rate we can afford for achieving a target\nfidelity with codes of a given length. The results also show that in symmetric\ndepolarizing channel a typical stabilizer code has better performance, in terms\nof fidelity and code rate, compared with a typical CSS codes, and that balanced\nCSS codes significantly outperform other CSS codes. Asymptotic results\ndemonstrate that CSS codes have a fundamental performance loss compared to\nstabilizer codes.\n", "  One of the primary limiting sources of systematic uncertainty in forthcoming\nweak lensing measurements is systematic uncertainty in the quantitative\nrelationship between the distortions due to gravitational lensing and the\nmeasurable properties of galaxy images. We present a statistically principled,\ngeneral solution to this problem. Our technique infers multiplicative shear\ncalibration parameters by modifying the actual survey data to simulate the\neffects of a known shear. It can be applied to any shear estimation method\nbased on weighted averages of galaxy shape measurements, which includes all\nmethods used to date for shear estimation with real data. Use of the real\nimages mitigates uncertainty due to unknown galaxy morphology, which is a\nserious concern for calibration of shear estimates based on image simulations.\nWe test our results on simulated images from the GREAT3 challenge, and show\nthat the method eliminates calibration biases for several different shape\nmeasurement techniques at the level of precision measurable with the GREAT3\nsimulations (a few tenths of a percent).\n", "  The ab initio band structure of 2D graphene sheet is well reproduced by the\nthird nearest neighbor tight binding model proposed by Reich et al [Phys. Rev.\nB 66, 035412]. For ribbon structures, the existing sets of tight binding\nparameters can successfully explain semi-conducting behavior of all armchair\nribbon structures. However, they are still failing in describing accurately the\nslope of the bands while this feature is directly associated to the group\nvelocity and the effective mass of electrons. In this work, both density\nfunctional theory and tight binding calculations were performed and a new set\nof tight binding parameters up to the third nearest neighbors including overlap\nterms is introduced. The results obtained with this model offer excellent\nagreement with the predictions of the density functional theory in most cases\nof ribbon structures, even in the high-energy region. Moreover, this set can\ninduce electron-hole asymmetry as manifested in density functional theory.\nRelevant outcomes are also demonstrated for armchair ribbons of various widths\nas well as for zigzag structures, thus opening a route for multi-scale\nsimulations.\n", "  We present an integrated microsimulation framework to estimate the pedestrian\nmovement over time and space with limited data on directional counts. Using the\nactivity-based approach, simulation can compute the overall demand and\ntrajectory of each agent, which are in accordance with the available partial\nobservations and are in response to the initial and evolving supply conditions\nand schedules. This simulation contains a chain of processes including:\nactivities generation, decision point choices, and assignment. They are\nconsidered in an iteratively updating loop so that the simulation can\ndynamically correct its estimates of demand. A Markov chain is constructed for\nthis loop. These considerations transform the problem into a convergence\nproblem. A Metropolitan Hasting algorithm is then adapted to identify the\noptimal solution. This framework can be used to fill the lack of data or to\nmodel the reactions of demand to exogenous changes in the scenario. Finally, we\npresent a case study on Montreal Central Station, on which we tested the\ndeveloped framework and calibrated the models. We then applied it to a possible\nfuture scenario for the same station.\n", "  We present the study of the dark soliton dynamics in an inhomogenous fiber by\nmeans of a variable coefficient modified nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\n(Vc-MNLSE) with distributed dispersion, self-phase modulation, self-steepening\nand linear gain/loss. The ultrashort dark soliton pulse evolution and\ninteraction is studied by using the Hirota bilinear (HB) method. In particular,\nwe give much insight into the effect of self-steepening (SS) on the dark\nsoliton dynamics. The study reveals a shock wave formation, as a major effect\nof SS. Numerically, we study the dark soliton propagation in the continuous\nwave background, and the stability of the soliton solution is tested in the\npresence of photon noise. The elastic collision behaviors of the dark solitons\nare discussed by the asymptotic analysis. On the other hand, considering the\nnonlinear tunneling of dark soliton through barrier/well, we find that the\ntunneling of the dark soliton depends on the height of the barrier and the\namplitude of the soliton. The intensity of the tunneling soliton either forms a\npeak or valley and retains its shape after the tunneling. For the case of\nexponential background, the soliton tends to compress after tunneling through\nthe barrier/well.\n", "  We consider an inverse boundary value problem for the Maxwell equations with\nboundary data assumed known only in accessible part $\\Gamma$ of the boundary.\nWe aim to prove a uniqueness result using the Dirichlet to Neumann data with\nmeasurements limited to an open part of the boundary and we seek to reconstruct\nthe complex refractive index $n$ in the interior of a body. Further, using the\nimpedance map restricted to $\\Gamma$, we may identify locations of small volume\nfraction perturbations of the refractive index.\n", "  The synthetic actin network demands great interest as bio-material due to its\nsoft and wet nature that mimic many biological scaffolding structures. The\nstudy of these structures can contribute to a better understanding of this new\nmicro/nano technology and the cytoskeleton like structural building blocks.\nInside the cell the actin network is regulated by tens of actin-binding\nproteins (ABP's), which makes for a highly complex system with several emergent\nbehavior. In particular Calponin is an ABP that was identified as an actin\nstabiliser, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Recent experiments using an\nin vitro model system of cross-linked actin with Calponin and large deformation\nbulk rheology, found that networks with basic calponin exhibited a delayed\nonset and were able to withstand a higher maximal strain before softening.\n  In this work we propose a mathematical model into the framework of nonlinear\ncontinuum mechanics to explain the observation of Jansen, where we introduce\nthe hypothesis by which the difference between the two networks, with and\nwithout Calponin, is interpreted as a alterations in the pre-strain developed\nby the network entanglement and the regulation of the crosslinks adhesion\nenergy. The mechanics of the F-actin is modelled using the wormlike chain model\nfor semi-flexible filaments and the gelation process is described as mesoscale\ndynamics for the crosslinks. The model has been validated with reported\nexperimental results from literature, showing a good agreement between theory\nand experiments.\n", "  We show that in Lorentzian manifolds, sectional curvature bounds of the form\n$\\mathcal{R}\\le K\\,$, as defined by Andersson and Howard, are closely tied to\nspace-time convex and $\\lambda$-convex ($\\lambda>0$) functions, as defined by\nGibbons and Ishibashi. Among the consequences are a natural construction of\nsuch functions, and an analogue, that applies to domains of a new type, of a\ntheorem of Al\\'ias, Bessa and deLira ruling out trapped submanifolds.\n", "  The issue of the buckling mechanism in droplets stabilized by solid particles\n(armored droplets) is tackled at a mesoscopic level using dissipative particle\ndynamics simulations. We consider spherical water droplet in a decane solvent\ncoated with nanoparticle monolayers of two different types: Janus and\nhomogeneous. The chosen particles yield comparable initial three-phase contact\nangles, chosen to maximize the adsorption energy at the interface. We study the\ninterplay between the evolution of droplet shape, layering of the particles,\nand their distribution at the interface when the volume of the droplets is\nreduced. We show that Janus particles affect strongly the shape of the droplet\nwith the formation of a crater-like depression. This evolution is actively\ncontrolled by a close-packed particle monolayer at the curved interface. On the\ncontrary, homogeneous particles follow passively the volume reduction of the\ndroplet, whose shape does not deviate too much from spherical, even when a\nnanoparticle monolayer/bilayer transition is detected at the interface. We\ndiscuss how these buckled armored droplets might be of relevance in various\napplications including potential drug delivery systems and biomimetic design of\nfunctional surfaces.\n", "  Magnetic properties of AMoOPO$_4$Cl (A = K, Rb) with Mo$^{5+}$ ions in the\n4$d^1$ electronic configuration are investigated by magnetization, heat\ncapacity and NMR measurements on single crystals, combined with powder neutron\ndiffraction experiments. The magnetization measurements reveal that they are\ngood model compounds for the spin-1/2 $J_1-J_2$ square lattice magnet with the\nfirst and second nearest-neighbor interactions. Magnetic transitions are\nobserved at around 6 and 8 K in the K and Rb compounds, respectively. In\ncontrast to the normal N\\'eel-type antiferromagnetic order, the NMR and neutron\ndiffraction experiments find a columnar antiferromagnetic order for each\ncompound, which is stabilized by a dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$. Both\ncompounds realize the unusual case of two interpenetrating $J_2$ square\nlattices weakly coupled to each other by $J_1$.\n", "  Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies were performed for the Sb-doped\n112-type iron-based superconductor Ca1-xLaxFeAs2 with the superconducting\ntransition temperature Tc of 47 K. Doped Sb preferably substituted not for\nAs(1) in the FeAs layers but for As(2) in the layers of As zigzag chains.\nStructural reasons for Tc enhancement by Sb doping were discussed.\n", "  Using Monte Carlo simulations in the frame of stochastic series expansion\n(SSE), we study the three-state quantum Potts model. The cluster algorithm we\nused is a direct generalization of that for the quantum Ising model. The\nsimulations include the one dimensional and two dimensional ferromagnetic\nthree-state quantum Potts model and the two dimensional antiferromagnetic\nthree-state quantum Potts model. Our results show that the phase transition of\nthe one dimensional ferromagnetic quantum Potts model belongs to the same\nuniversality class of the two dimensional classical Potts model, the two\ndimensional ferromagnetic quantum Potts model undergoes a first order\ntransition, which is also in analogy to its classical correspondence. The phase\ntransition of the antiferromagnetic quantum Potts model is continuous, whose\nuniversality class belongs to the three-dimensional classical XY model, owing\nto an `emergent' O(2) symmetry at the critical point, although its ordered\nphase breaks the Z_6 symmetry.\n", "  The structural evolution and superconductivity of a 122-type solid solution\nSr1-xBaxNi2P2 were studied. We found that an orthorhombic-tetragonal structural\nphase transition takes place at x = 0.5, and is characterized by the P-P dimers\nbreaking. The superconducting transition temperature exhibited its highest\nvalue of 2.85 K at x = 0.4.\n", "  Anisotropy describes the directional dependence of a material's properties\nsuch as transport and optical response. In conventional bulk materials,\nanisotropy is intrinsically related to the crystal structure, and thus not\ntunable by the gating techniques used in modern electronics. Here we show that,\nin bilayer black phosphorus with an interlayer twist angle of 90{\\deg}, the\nanisotropy of its electronic structure and optical transitions is tunable by\ngating. Using first-principles calculations, we predict that a\nlaboratory-accessible gate voltage can induce a hole effective mass that is 30\ntimes larger along one Cartesian axis than along the other axis, and the two\naxes can be exchanged by flipping the sign of the gate voltage. This\ngate-controllable band structure also leads to a switchable optical linear\ndichroism, where the polarization of the lowest-energy optical transitions\n(absorption or luminescence) is tunable by gating. Thus, anisotropy is a\ntunable degree of freedom in twisted bilayer black phosphorus.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger equation is solved for the wave function of an electron\nmoving in a superposition of external constant and uniform electric and\nmagnetic fields at an arbitrary angle between the field directions. The\nchanging of the potential barrier under influence of the magnetic field\nparallel to the metal surface is shown.\n", "  Surface force apparatus (SFA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) can measure a\nforce curve between a substrate and a probe in liquid. However, the force curve\nhad not been transformed to the number density distribution of solvent\nmolecules (colloidal particles) on the substance due to the absence of such a\ntransform theory. Recently, we proposed and developed the transform theories\nfor SFA and AFM. In these theories, the force curve is transformed to the\npressure between two flat walls. Next, the pressure is transformed to number\ndensity distribution of solvent molecules (colloidal particles). However, pair\npotential between the solvent molecule (colloidal particle) and the wall is\nneeded as the input of the calculation and Kirkwood superposition approximation\nis used in the previous theories. In this letter, we propose a new theory that\ndoes not use both the pair potential and the approximation. Instead, it makes\nuse of a structure factor between solvent molecules (colloidal particles) which\ncan be obtained by X-ray or neutron scattering.\n", "  Diffusion MRI measurements using hyperpolarized gases are generally acquired\nduring patient breath hold, which yields a compromise between achievable image\nresolution, lung coverage and number of b-values. In this work, we propose a\nnovel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by\nundersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating\nknowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is\ncompared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on\nboth the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions\n(MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion\ndatasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n=8) for acceleration factors\nbetween x2 and x10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for acceleration\nfactors equal or larger than x5. SIDER improved TV, presenting lower errors and\nhistograms of MAD closer to those obtained from fully sampled data for\naccelerations factors up to x10. SIDER preserved image quality at all\nacceleration factors but images were slightly smoothed and some details were\nlost at x10. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel compressed\nsensing method for lung MRI imaging and achieved high acceleration factors,\nwhich can be used to increase the amount of data acquired during a breath-hold.\nThis methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of estimated lung\nmicrostructure dimensions and widen the possibilities of studying lung diseases\nwith MRI.\n", "  The annihilation operators on Bernoulli functionals (Bernoulli annihilators,\nfor short) and their adjoint operators satisfy a canonical anti-commutation\nrelation (CAR) in equal-time. As a mathematical structure, Dirichlet forms play\nan important role in many fields in mathematical physics. In this paper, we\napply the Bernoulli annihilators to constructing Dirichlet forms on Bernoulli\nfunctionals. Let $w$ be a nonnegative function on $\\mathbb{N}$. By using the\nBernoulli annihilators, we first define in a dense subspace of the $L^2$-space\nof Bernoulli functionals a positive, symmetric bilinear form $\\mathcal{E}_w$\nassociated with $w$. And then we prove that $\\mathcal{E}_w$ is closed and has\nthe contraction property, hence it is a Dirichlet form. Finally, we consider an\ninteresting semigroup of operators associated with $w$ on the $L^2$-space of\nBernoulli functionals, which we call the $w$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, and\nby using the Dirichlet form $\\mathcal{E}_w$ we show that the\n$w$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup is a Markov semigroup.\n", "  Odd-frequency triplet Cooper pairs are believed to be the carriers of\nlong-range superconducting correlations in ferromagnets. Such triplet pairs are\ngenerated by inhomogeneous magnetism at the interface between a superconductor\n(S) and a ferromagnet (F). So far, reproducible long-range effects were\nreported only in complex layered structures designed to provide the magnetic\ninhomogeneity. Here we show that spin triplet pair formation can be found in\nsimple unstructured Nb/Permalloy (Py = Ni_0.8Fe_0.2)/Nb trilayers and Nb/Py\nbilayers, but only when the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer ranges between\n140 and 250 nm. The effect is related to the emergence of an intrinsically\ninhomogeneous magnetic state, which is a precursor of the well-known stripe\nregime in Py that in our samples sets in at thickness larger than 300 nm.\n", "  As a fundamental property of the electron, the spin plays a decisive role in\nthe electronic structure of matter from solids to molecules and atoms, e.g.\ncausing magnetism. Yet, despite its importance, the spin dynamics of electrons\nreleased during the interaction of atoms with strong ultrashort laser pulses\nhas remained unexplored. Here we report on the experimental detection of\nelectron spin polarization by strong-field ionization of Xenon atoms and\nsupport our results by theoretical analysis. We found up to 30% spin\npolarization changing its sign with electron energy. This work opens the new\ndimension of spin to strong-field physics. It paves the way to production of\nsubfemtosecond spin polarized electron pulses with applications ranging from\nprobing magnetic properties of matter at ultrafast time scales to testing\nchiral molecular systems with subfemtosecond temporal and sub-{\\AA}ngstr\\\"om\nspatial resolution.\n", "  In this article non-abelian version of quantum Painlev\\'e II equation is\npresented with Its quasideterminant solutions has been derived by using the\nDarboux transformations. This non-abelian quantum Painlev\\'e II equation may be\nconsidered as a specific case of its purely noncommutatie analogue presented by\nV. Retakh and V. Rubtsov . In these computations the quantum Painlev\\'e II\nsymmetric form with commutation relations presented by H. Nagoya are applied to\nderive Nonabelian quantum Painlev\\'e II equation and a new commutation relation\nbetween variable $z$ and the solution $ f(z)$ such as $ z f - f z = \\frac{1}{2}\ni \\hbar f $ is presented. Finally, the Darboux solutions of that system are\ngeneralized to the $N$-th form in terms of quasideterminants.\n", "  We present a non-perturbative numerical technique for calculating strong\nlight shifts in atoms under the influence of multiple optical fields with\narbitrary polarization. We confirm our technique experimentally by performing\nspectroscopy of a cloud of cold $^{87}$Rb atoms subjected to $\\sim$ kW/cm$^2$\nintensities of light at 1560.492 nm simultaneous with 1529.269 nm or 1529.282\nnm. In these conditions the excited state resonances at 1529.26 nm and 1529.36\nnm induce strong level mixing and the shifts are highly nonlinear. By\nabsorption spectroscopy, we observe that the induced shifts of the 5P3/2\nhyperfine Zeeman sublevels agree well with our theoretical predictions.. We\npropose the application of our theory and experiment to accurate measurements\nof excited-state electric-dipole matrix elements.\n", "  By use of ultrasound studies we resolved magneto-acoustic quantum oscillation\ndeep into the mixed state of the multiband nonmagnetic superconductor YNi2B2C.\nBelow the upper critical field, only a very weak additional damping appears\nthat can be well explained by the field inhomogeneity caused by the flux-line\nlattice in the mixed state. This is clear evidence for no or a vanishingly\nsmall gap for one of the bands, namely, the spheroidal alpha band. This\ncontrasts de Haas--van Alphen data obtained by use of torque magnetometry for\nthe same sample, with a rapidly vanishing oscillation signal in the mixed\nstate. This points to a strongly distorted flux-line lattice in the latter case\nthat, in general, can hamper a reliable extraction of gap parameters by use of\nsuch techniques.\n", "  We use Pseudo Quantum Electrodynamics to study massive (2+1)D Dirac systems\ninteracting electromagnetically via a U(1) gauge field in (3+1)D. It was\nrecently found in Ref. [1], that an interaction-induced Quantum Hall Effect\n(QHE) and Quantum Valley Hall Effect (QVHE) occur in these systems, when\nconsidering a two-component fermion representation. Here, we study the\ncorrections to these effects when coupling the fermions to a (2+1)D massive\nscalar field via a quartic interaction. We find no correction to the QHE and a\nnon-universal correction to the QVHE, which depends on the ratio of the fermion\nand scalar-field masses.\n", "  De Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of the\norganic metal $\\theta$-(BETS) 4 CoBr 4 (C 6 H 4 Cl 2) are studied in magnetic\nfields of up to 55 T at liquid helium temperatures. In line with Fermi surfaces\n(FS) illustrating the linear chain of coupled orbits, the observed Fourier\ncomponents are linear combinations of the frequencies linked to the two basic\norbits $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which have small effective masses compared to\nother organic metals with the same FS topology. Analytical formulas based on a\nsecond order development of the free energy within the canonical ensemble, not\nonly account for the field and temperature dependence of the dHvA amplitudes\nbut also for their relative values. In addition, strongly non-Lifshitz-Kosevich\nbehaviours are quantitatively interpreted. In contrast, Shubnikov-de Haas\noscillations are not accounted for by this model. short title: Quantum\noscillations of $\\theta$-(BETS) 4 CoBr 4 (C 6 H 4 Cl 2)\n", "  A gradual solar energetic particle (SEP) event is thought to happen when\nparticles are accelerated at a shock due to a fast coronal mass ejection (CME).\nTo quantify what kind of solar eruptions can result in such SEP events, we have\nconducted detailed investigations on the characteristics of CMEs, solar flares\nand m-to-DH wavelength type II radio bursts (herein after m-to-DH type II\nbursts) for SEP-associated and non-SEP-associated events, observed during the\nperiod of 1997-2012. Interestingly, 65% of m-to-DH type II bursts associated\nwith CMEs and flares produced SEP events. The SEP-associated CMEs have higher\nsky-plane mean speed, projection corrected speed, and sky-plane peak speed than\nthose of non-SEP-associated CMEs respectively by 30%, 39%, and 25%, even though\nthe two sets of CMEs achieved their sky-plane peak speeds at nearly similar\nheights within LASCO field of view. We found Pearson's correlation coefficients\nbetween the speeds of CMEs speeds and logarithmic peak intensity of SEP events\nare cc = 0.62 and cc = 0.58, respectively. We also found that the\nSEP-associated CMEs are on average of three times more decelerated (-21.52\nm/s2) than the non-SEP-associated CMEs (-5.63 m/s2). The SEP-associated m type\nII bursts have higher frequency drift rate and associated shock speed than\nthose of the non-SEP-associated events by 70% and 25% respectively. The average\nformation heights of m and DH type II radio bursts for SEP-associated events\nare lower than for non-SEP-associated events. 93% of SEP-associated events\noriginate from the western hemisphere and 65% of SEP-associated events are\nassociated with interacting CMEs. The obtained results indicate that, at least\nfor the set of CMEs associated with m-to-DH type II bursts, SEP-associated CMEs\nare more energetic than those not associated with SEPs, thus suggesting that\nthey are effective particle accelerators.\n", "  Atmospheric conditions, such as the pressure (P), temperature (T) or air\ndensity ($\\rho \\propto P/T$), affect the development of extended air showers\ninitiated by energetic cosmic rays. We study the impact of the atmospheric\nvariations on the reconstruction of air showers with data from the arrays of\nsurface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory, considering separately the\none with detector spacings of 1500 m and the one with 750 m spacing. We observe\nmodulations in the event rates that are due to the influence of the air density\nand pressure variations on the measured signals, from which the energy\nestimators are obtained. We show how the energy assignment can be corrected to\naccount for such atmospheric effects.\n", "  In this work we demonstrate that a free-standing van der Waals\nheterostructure, usually regarded as a flat object, can exhibit an intrinsic\nbuckled atomic structure resulting from the interaction between two layers with\na small lattice mismatch. We studied a freely suspended membrane of well\naligned graphene on a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) monolayer by transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM). We developed a detection\nmethod in the STEM that is capable of recording the direction of the scattered\nelectron beam and that is extremely sensitive to the local stacking of atoms.\nComparison between experimental data and simulated models shows that the\nheterostructure effectively bends in the out-of-plane direction, producing an\nundulated structure having a periodicity that matches the moir\\'e wavelength.\nWe attribute this rippling to the interlayer interaction and also show how this\naffects the intralayer strain in each layer.\n", "  The Dirac equation in curved space is used to study the optical transmittance\nof deformed graphene along a given direction. Our theoretical analysis of the\navailable experimental data for the light transmittance suggests that the\nperiodic ripple associated with the out-of-plane deformation observed in\nunstrained graphene explains the observations. Furthermore, the experimental\nuniaxial strained graphene for light transmittance show two features, namely\nthe modification of the $\\cos^2\\theta$ law and the decrease of the amplitude of\nthe oscillations with the polarization angle $\\theta$, which can be well\naccommodated within the theoretical analysis used here and provide further\nevidence of the validity of using QFT in curved space to understand two\ndimensional materials.\n", "  We investigate the defect structures forming around two nanoparticles in a\nGay-Berne nematic liquid crystal using molecular simulations. For small\nseparations, disclinations entangle both particles forming the figure of eight,\nthe figure of omega and the figure of theta. These defect structures are\nsimilar in shape and occur with a comparable frequency to micron-sized\nparticles studied in experiments. The simulations reveal fast transitions from\none defect structure to another suggesting that particles of nanometre size\ncannot be bound together effectively. We identify the 'three-ring' structure\nobserved in previous molecular simulations as a superposition of the different\nentangled and non-entangled states over time and conclude that it is not itself\na stable defect structure.\n", "  We study a new nonlinear partial differential equation of the fifth order for\nthe description of perturbations in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam mass chain. This\nfifth-order equation is an expansion of the Gardner equation for the\ndescription of the Fermi--Pasta--Ulam model. We use the potential of\ninteraction between neighbouring masses with both quadratic and cubic terms.\nThe equation is derived using the continuous limit. Unlike the previous works,\nwe take into account higher order terms in the Taylor series expansions. We\ninvestigate the equation using the Painlev\\'e approach. We show that the\nequation does not pass the Painlev\\'e test and can not be integrated by the\ninverse scattering transform. We use the logistic function method and the\nLaurent expansion method to find travelling wave solutions of the fifth--order\nequation. We use the pseudospectral method for the numerical simulation of wave\nprocesses, described by the equation.\n", "  The complexity embedded in condensed matter fertilizes the discovery of new\nstates of matter, enriched by ingredients like frustration. Illustrating\nexamples in magnetic systems are Kitaev spin liquids, skyrmions phases, or spin\nices. These unconventional ground states support exotic excitations, for\nexample the magnetic charges in spin ices, also called monopoles. Beyond their\ndiscovery, an important challenge is to be able to control and manipulate them.\nHere, we propose a new mechanism to inject monopoles in a spin ice through a\nstaggered magnetic field. We show theoretically, and demonstrate experimentally\nin the Ho$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ pyrochlore iridate, that it results in the\nstabilization of a monopole crystal, which exhibits magnetic fragmentation. In\nthis new state of matter, the magnetic moment fragments into an ordered part\nand a persistently fluctuating one. Compared to conventional spin ices, the\ndifferent nature of the excitations in this fragmented state opens the way to\nnovel tunable field-induced and dynamical behaviors.\n", "  The Kuiper Belt of our solar system is a source of short-period comets that\nmay have delivered water and other volatiles to Earth and the other terrestrial\nplanets. However, the distribution of water and other volatiles in extrasolar\nplanetary systems is largely unknown. We report the discovery of an accretion\nof a Kuiper-Belt-Object analog onto the atmosphere of the white dwarf WD\n1425+540. The heavy elements C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, and Ni are detected,\nwith nitrogen observed for the first time in extrasolar planetary debris. The\nnitrogen mass fraction is $\\sim$ 2\\%, comparable to that in comet Halley and\nhigher than in any other known solar system object. The lower limit to the\naccreted mass is $\\sim$ 10$^{22}$ g, which is about one hundred thousand times\nthe typical mass of a short-period comet. In addition, WD 1425+540 has a wide\nbinary companion, which could facilitate perturbing a Kuiper-Belt-Object analog\ninto the white dwarf's tidal radius. This finding shows that analogs to objects\nin our Kuiper Belt exist around other stars and could be responsible for the\ndelivery of volatiles to terrestrial planets beyond\n", "  We consider the light cone (`retardation') equation (LCE) of an inertially\nmoving observer and a single worldline parameterized by arbitrary rational\nfunctions. Then a set of apparent copies, R- or C-particles, defined by the\n(real or complex conjugate) roots of the LCE will be detected by the observer.\nFor any rational worldline the collective R-C dynamics is manifestly\nLorentz-invariant and conservative; the latter property follows directly from\nthe structure of Vieta formulas for the LCE roots. In particular, two Lorentz\ninvariants, the square of total 4-momentum and total rest mass, are distinct\nand both integer-valued. Asymptotically, at large values of the observer's\nproper time, one distinguishes three types of the LCE roots and associated R-C\nparticles, with specific locations and evolutions; each of three kinds of\nparticles can assemble into compact large groups - clusters. Throughout the\npaper, we make no use of differential equations of motion, field equations,\netc.: the collective R-C dynamics is purely algebraic\n", "  The interactions of the neutrini and antineutrini amongst themselves, as well\nas the interactions of these particles with the electrons and the positrons,\nare of interest in simulations of the early Universe and in studies of the\nprocesses involving compact stars. The objective in this paper is to create a\nreliable source of information regarding the differential and total cross\nsections of these interactions; expressions for these observables will be\nobtained using standard methodology. A number of relevant discrepancies in the\nliterature will be addressed.\n", "  In this article, two novel numerical methods have been developed for\nsimulating fluid/porous particle interactions in three-dimensional (3D) Stokes\nflow. The Brinkman-Debye-Bueche model is adopted for the fluid flow inside the\nporous particle, being coupled with the Stokes equations for the fluid flow\noutside the particle. The rotating motion of a porous ball and the interaction\nof two porous balls in bounded shear flows have been studied by these two new\nmethods. The numerical results show that the porous particle permeability has a\nstrong effect on the interaction of two porous balls.\n", "  We consider one-dimensional long-range spin models (usually called Dyson\nmodels), consisting of Ising ferromagnets with slowly decaying long-range pair\npotentials of the form $\\frac{1}{|i-j|^{\\alpha}}$ mainly focusing on the range\nof slow decays $1 < \\alpha \\leq 2$. We describe two recent results, one about\nrenormalization and one about the effect of external fields at low temperature.\nThe first result states that a decimated long-range Gibbs measure in one\ndimension becomes non-Gibbsian, in the same vein as comparable results in\nhigher dimensions for short-range models. The second result addresses the\nbehaviour of such models under inhomogeneous fields, in particular external\nfields which decay to zero polynomially as $(|i|+1)^{- \\gamma}$. We study how\nthe critical decay power of the field, $\\gamma$, for which the phase transition\npersists and the decay power $\\alpha$ of the Dyson model compare, extending\nrecent results for short-range models on lattices and on trees. We also briefly\npoint out some analogies between these results.\n", "  We derive the specific baryonic angular momentum of five gas rich dwarf\ngalaxies from HI kinematics complemented by stellar mass profiles. Since the\ngas mass of these galaxies is much larger than the stellar mass, the angular\nmomentum can be determined with relatively little uncertainty arising from the\nuncertainties in the stellar mass to light ratio. We compare the relation\nbetween the specific baryonic angular momentum (j) and the total baryonic mass\n(M) for these galaxies with that found for spiral galaxies. Our combined sample\nexplores the j-M plane over 3 orders of magnitude in baryon mass. We find that\nour sample dwarf have significantly higher specific angular momentum than\nexpected from the relation found for spiral galaxies. The probability that\nthese gas rich dwarf galaxies follow the same relation as spirals is found to\nbe $<10^{-6}$. This implies a difference in the evolution of angular momentum\nin these galaxies compared to larger ones. We suggest that this difference\ncould arise due to one or more of the following: a lower baryon fraction in\ndwarf galaxies, particularly that arising from preferential outflows low\nangular momentum gas as found in high resolution simulations that include\nbaryonic feedback; \"cold mode\" anisotropic accretion from cosmic filaments. Our\nwork reinforces the importance of the j-M plane in understanding the evolution\nof galaxies.\n", "  Roche tomography is a technique designed for mapping the intensity\ndistribution over the surface of binary star components that fill (or nearly\nfill) their Roche lobes and so are both rotationally and tidally distorted. It\nbuilds on and develops the successful techniques used for mapping rapidly\nrotating single stars, which have revealed the presence of starspots. It has so\nfar been applied to only a small number of cataclysmic variables, and a few\nother related systems. This paper reviews the technique and presents maps of\nspots on most of these systems. The review has been written with the help of\ncontributions of material from Chris Watson and Colin Hill of Queen's\nUniversity, Belfast.\n", "  We study the Markov dynamics of an infinite birth-and-death system of point\nentities placed in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, in which the constituents disperse and die,\nalso due to competition. Assuming that the dispersal and competition kernels\nare just continuous and integrable we prove that the evolution of states of\nthis model preserves their sub-Poissonicity, and hence the local\nself-regulation (suppression of clustering) takes place. Upper bounds for the\ncorrelation functions of all orders are also obtained for both long and short\ndispersals, and for all values of the intrinsic mortality rate $m\\geq 0$.\n", "  We attempt to construct a gravitational coupling by pre-selecting an\nenergy-momentum tensor as the source for gravitational field. The\nenergy-momentum tensor we take is a recently derived new expression motivated\nby joint localization of energy and momentum in quantum measurement. This\nenergy-momentum tensor differs from the traditional canonical and symmetric\nones, and the theory we obtain is of an Einstein-Cartan type, but derived from\na minimal coupling of a Lagrangian with second-derivative, and leads to\nadditional interaction between torsion and matter, including the scalar field.\nFor the scalar field, the theory can also be derived in the Riemann space-time\nby a non-minimal coupling. Our study gives hint on more general tests of\ngeneral relativistic effects.\n", "  Precise studies on the Galactic bulge, halo, thick disk, and globular\nclusters require stellar models with alpha enhancement and various He contents.\nFor this purpose we complement existing PARSEC (PAdova-TRieste Stellar\nEvolution Code) models, which are based on the solar partition, with\nalpha-enhanced partitions. We collect detailed measurements on the metal\nmixture and He abundance for the two populations of 47Tuc from literature, and\ncalculate stellar tracks and isochrones with these chemical compositions\n([alpha/Fe]~0.4 and 0.2). By fitting precise CMD with HST data from low main\nsequence till horizontal branch, we calibrate free parameters that are\nimportant for the evolution of low mass stars. The new calibration and\nalpha-enhanced mixtures are applied to other metallicities. The new models\nreproduce the RGB bump observations much better than previous models.\n  PARSEC is able to predict any chemical pattern in stellar evolution. Li is\none of the most intriguing ones. Li abundance derived in POP II dwarfs is about\nthree times lower than the standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predicts. This\ndisagreement is referred as the cosmological lithium problem. We reconsider the\nstellar Li evolution from pre-main sequence to the end of main sequence by\nintroducing the effects of convective overshooting and residual accretion.\n$^7$Li could be significantly depleted by convective overshooting in the\npre-main sequence and then partially restored in the stellar atmosphere by a\ntail of matter accretion which could be regulated by EUV photo-evaporation. By\nconsidering the conventional nuclear burning and microscopic diffusion along\nthe main sequence, we reproduce the Spite plateau for $m_0=0.62-0.80M_{\\odot}$\nstars, and the Li declining branch for lower mass dwarfs, with a wide range of\nmetallicities (Z=0.00001 to Z=0.0005), starting from the primordial abundance\nA(Li)=2.72.\n", "  In the present paper we propose to update the standard calculation of Stark\nline profiles for autoionizing atomic states in dense plasmas, i.e. warm dense\nmatter and strongly coupled plasmas. This is motivated by the importance of\ntaking into account the effect of the electric microfield generated by the\nplasma charge constituents in the calculation of the atomic populations of\nautoionizing states which leads to the modification of the calculation of Stark\nline profiles in the frame of the standard theory. This is due to the\nproperties of the autoionizing atomic states that are far from Boltzmann\ndistribution even in dense plasmas bringing serious doubts on the statistical\napproach used in the standard theory of Stark profile calculations. We discuss\nthe importance of the present analysis in view of the radiation emission\noriginating from dense plasmas created by the interaction of the X-ray Free\nElectron Lasers (XFEL's) with solid density matter.\n", "  For simple mechanical systems, bifurcating branches of relative equilibria\nwith trivial symmetry from a given set of relative equilibria with toral\nsymmetry are found. Lyapunov stability conditions along these branches are\ngiven.\n"]}
