The detailed\nabundances confirm NGC~1718 to be a fairly metal-rich cluster, with an average\n[Fe/H] ~ -0.55+/-0.01. The two red giants appear to have primordial O, Na, Mg,\nand Al abundances, with no convincing signs of a composition difference between\nthe two stars---hence, based on these two stars, NGC~1718 shows no evidence for\nhosting multiple populations. The Mg abundance is lower than Milky Way field\nstars, but is similar to LMC field stars at the same metallicity. The previous\nclaims of very low [Mg/Fe] in NGC~1718 are therefore not supported in this\nstudy. Other abundances (Si, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Rb, Y, Zr, La, and Eu) all\nfollow the LMC field star trend, demonstrating yet again that (for most\nelements) globular clusters trace the abundances of their host galaxy's field\nstars. Similar to the field stars, NGC~1718 is found to be mildly deficient in\nexplosive $\\alpha$-elements, but moderately to strongly deficient in O, Na, Mg,\nAl, and Cu, elements which form during hydrostatic burning in massive stars.\nNGC~1718 is also enhanced in La, suggesting that it was enriched in ejecta from\nmetal-poor AGB stars.\n", "  This study investigates travel behavior determinants based on a multiday\ntravel survey conducted in the region of Ghent, Belgium. Due to the limited\ndata reliability of the data sample and the influence of outliers exerted on\nclassical principal component analysis, robust principal component analysis\n(ROBPCA) is employed in order to reveal the explanatory variables responsible\nfor most of the variability. Interpretation of the results is eased by\nutilizing ROSPCA. The application of ROSPCA reveals six distinct principal\ncomponents where each is determined by a few variables. Among others, our\nresults suggest a key role of variable categories such as journey\npurpose-related impedance and journey inherent constraints. Surprisingly, the\nvariables associated with journey timing turn out to be less important.\nFinally, our findings reveal the critical role of outliers in travel behavior\nanalysis. This suggests that a systematic understanding of how outliers\ncontribute to observed mobility behavior patterns, as derived from travel\nsurveys, is needed. In this regard, the proposed methods serve for processing\nraw data typically used in activity-based modelling.\n", "  I first review the early history of the ultrarelativistic heavy ion program,\nstarting with the 1974 Bear Mountain Workshop, and the 1983 Aurora meeting of\nthe U.S. Nuclear Science Committee, just one billion seconds ago, which laid\nout the initial science goals of an ultrarelativistic collider. The primary\ngoal, to discover the properties of nuclear matter at the highest energy\ndensities, included finding new states of matter -- the quark-gluon plasma\nprimarily -- and to use collisions to open a new window on related problems of\nmatter in cosmology, neutron stars, supernovae, and elsewhere. To bring out how\nthe study of heavy ions and hot, dense matter in QCD has been fulfilling these\ngoals. I concentrate on a few topics, the phase diagram of matter in QCD, and\nconnections of heavy ion physics to cold atoms, cosmology, and neutron stars.\n", "  The rapid expansion in the spectrum of two-dimensional (2D) materials has\ndriven the efforts of research on the fabrication of 2D composites and\nheterostructures. Highly ordered structure of 2D materials provides an\nexcellent platform for controlling the ultimate structure and properties of the\ncomposite material with precision. However, limited control over the structure\nof the adherent material and its interactions with highly ordered 2D materials\nresults in defective composites with inferior performance. Here, we demonstrate\nthe successful synthesis, integration, and characterization of hybrid 2D\nmaterial systems consisting of tandem repeat (TR) proteins inspired by squid\nring teeth and graphene oxide (GO). The TR protein layer acts as a unique\nprogrammable molecular spacer between GO layers. As an application, we further\ndemonstrate thermal actuation using bimorph molecular composite films. Bimorph\nactuators made of molecular composite films (GO/TR) can lead to energy\nefficiencies 18 times higher than regular bimorph actuators consisting of a GO\nlayer and a TR protein layer (i.e., conventional bulk composite of GO and TR).\nAdditionally, molecular composite bimorph actuators can reach curvature values\nas high as 1.2 cm-1 by using TR proteins with higher molecular weight, which is\n3 times higher than conventional GO and TR composites.\n", "  The possible $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic superfluidity is investigated in neutron\nstar matter, and the corresponding energy gap as a function of baryonic density\nis calculated on the basis of BCS gap equation. We have discussed particularly\nthe influence of hyperon degrees of freedom on $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic\nsuperfluidity. It is found that the appearance of hyperons leads to a slight\ndecrease of $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic pairing energy gap in most density range of\nexisting $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic superfluidity. However, when the baryonic density\n$\\rho_{B}>$0.377 (or 0.409) fm${^{-3}}$ for TM1 (or TMA) parameter set,\n$^{1}S_{0}$ protonic pairing energy gap is significantly larger than the\ncorresponding values without hyperons. And the baryonic density range of\nexisting $^{1}S_{0}$ protonic superfluidity is widen due to the appearance of\nhyperons. In our results, the hyperons not only change the EOS and bulk\nproperties but also change the size and baryon density range of $^{1}S_{0}$\nprotonic superfluidity in neutron star matter.\n", "  We use a laboratory facility to study the sputtering properties of\ncentimeter-thick porous water ice subjected to the bombardment of ions and\nelectrons to better understand the formation of exospheres of the icy moons of\nJupiter. Our ice samples are as similar as possible to the expected moon\nsurfaces but surface charging of the samples during ion irradiation may distort\nthe experimental results. We therefore monitor the time scales for charging and\ndis- charging of the samples when subjected to a beam of ions. These\nexperiments allow us to derive an electric conductivity of deep porous ice\nlayers. The results imply that electron irradiation and sputtering play a\nnon-negligible role for certain plasma conditions at the icy moons of Jupiter.\nThe observed ion sputtering yields from our ice samples are similar to previous\nexperiments where compact ice films were sputtered off a micro-balance.\n", "  Orbital experiment ARINA on the board of Russian satellite Resurs-DK1\nlaunched in 2006 developed to study charged particle flux (electrons E ~ 3 -\n30MeV , protons E ~ 30 - 100MeV ) in near-Earth space, especially high-energy\nelectron precipitation from the inner radiation belt caused by various\ngeophysical and solar-magnetospheric phenomena. Precipitated electrons under\ncertain conditions (energy, LB-coordinate) drifts around the Earth and can be\ndetected as fast increase in count rate of satellite spectrometer (so called\nbursts). High-energy electron bursts can be caused by local geophysical\nphenomena (like earthquakes or thunderstorms). Such bursts have distinct\nfeatures in their measured energy-time distribution. These features contains\ninformation about initial location of electron precipitation. Several methods\n(linear, robust regression) were used previously to find longitudinal distance\nbetween region of precipitation and burst registration location on the board of\nsatellite. In this report, the new ensemble method was developed, it uses the\ncombining results from several methods in dependence of burst registration\nconditions. Numerical simulation of local particles precipitations based on\nwell-known equations of relativistic particle movement in Earth magnetosphere.\nIn experimental data analysis, the results from ARINA experiment for 10 years\nwas used. Several results based on burst experimental data are shown. Ensemble\nmethod shows better results than any single method alone.\n", "  Given the huge impact that Online Social Networks (OSN) had in the way people\nget informed and form their opinion, they became an attractive playground for\nmalicious entities that want to spread misinformation, and leverage their\neffect. In fact, misinformation easily spreads on OSN and is a huge threat for\nmodern society, possibly influencing also the outcome of elections, or even\nputting people's life at risk (e.g., spreading \"anti-vaccines\" misinformation).\nTherefore, it is of paramount importance for our society to have some sort of\n\"validation\" on information spreading through OSN. The need for a wide-scale\nvalidation would greatly benefit from automatic tools.\n  In this paper, we show that it is difficult to carry out an automatic\nclassification of misinformation considering only structural properties of\ncontent propagation cascades. We focus on structural properties, because they\nwould be inherently difficult to be manipulated, with the the aim of\ncircumventing classification systems. To support our claim, we carry out an\nextensive evaluation on Facebook posts belonging to conspiracy theories (as\nrepresentative of misinformation), and scientific news (representative of\nfact-checked content). Our findings show that conspiracy content actually\nreverberates in a way which is hard to distinguish from the one scientific\ncontent does: for the classification mechanisms we investigated, classification\nF1-score never exceeds 0.65 during content propagation stages, and is still\nless than 0.7 even after propagation is complete.\n", "  We ascertain the modularity-like objective function whose optimization is\nequivalent to the maximum likelihood in annotated networks. We demonstrate that\nthe modularity-like objective function is a linear combination of modularity\nand conditional entropy. In contrast with statistical inference methods, in our\nmethod, the influence of the metadata is adjustable; when its influence is\nstrong enough, the metadata can be recovered. Conversely, when it is weak, the\ndetection may correspond to another partition. Between the two, there is a\ntransition. This paper provides a concept for expanding the scope of modularity\nmethods.\n", "  With the potential prospects of the ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ at high-luminosity\ndedicated heavy-flavor factories, the color-favored ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$\n$B_{c}{\\pi}$, $B_{c}K$ weak decays are studied with the pQCD approach. It is\nfound that branching ratios for the ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\pi}$ decay\nare as large as the order of ${\\cal O}(10^{-11})$, which might be measured\npromisingly by the future experiments.\n", "  The ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}D_{s}$, $B_{c}D_{d}$ weak decays are\nstudied with the pQCD approach firstly. It is found that branching ratios\n${\\cal B}r({\\Upsilon}(nS){\\to}B_{c}D_{s})$ ${\\sim}$ ${\\cal O}(10^{-10})$ and\n${\\cal B}r({\\Upsilon}(nS){\\to}B_{c}D_{d})$ ${\\sim}$ ${\\cal O}(10^{-11})$, which\nmight be measurable in the future experiments.\n", "  This article presents the first results of the combined measurements of\nTunka-Rex and Tunka-Grande as well as studies of the antenna alignment effect\nand an overview of the recent Tunka-Rex results.\n", "  Blazars are active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose relativistic jets point nearly\nto the line of sight. Their compact radio structure can be imaged with very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) on parsec scales. Blazars at extremely high\nredshifts provide a unique insight into the AGN phenomena in the early\nUniverse. We observed four radio sources at redshift $z>4$ with the European\nVLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 and 5 GHz. These objects were previously classified\nas blazar candidates based on X-ray observations. One of them, J2134$-$0419 is\nfirmly confirmed as a blazar with our VLBI observations, due to its\nrelativistically beamed radio emission. Its radio jet extended to $\\sim$10\nmilli-arcsec scale makes this source a promising target for follow-up VLBI\nobservations to reveal any apparent proper motion. Another target, J0839+5112\nshows a compact radio structure typical of quasars. There is evidence for flux\ndensity variability and its radio \"core\" has a flat spectrum. However, the EVN\ndata suggest that its emission is not Doppler-boosted. The remaining two blazar\ncandidates (J1420+1205 and J2220+0025) show radio properties totally unexpected\nfrom radio AGN with small-inclination jet. Their emission extends to arcsec\nscales and the Doppler factors of the central components are well below 1.\nTheir structures resemble that of double-lobed radio AGN with large inclination\nto the line of sight. This is in contrast with the blazar-type modeling of\ntheir multi-band spectral energy distributions. Our work underlines the\nimportance of high-resolution VLBI imaging in confirming the blazar nature of\nhigh-redshift radio sources.\n"]}
