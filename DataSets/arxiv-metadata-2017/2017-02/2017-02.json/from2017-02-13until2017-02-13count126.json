The fitting of stellar\nradial velocity time series data is attempted by constructing a model to\nquantify the orbital properties of a star-planetary system. This is achieved\nwith the Planetary Orbit Fitting Process (POFP). Though specific to the\ninvestigated problem, the POFP is founded on two separate, more general ideas.\nOne is a Solver producing the gravitational dynamics of a Three-Body system by\nintegrating its Newtonian equations of motion. The other is an independent\noptimisation scheme. Both have been devised using MATLAB. Applying the\noptimisation to the Solver results in a realistic Three-Body dynamics that best\ndescribes the radial velocity data under the model-specific\norbital-observational constraints. Combining these aspects also allows for the\nstudy of dynamical instability derived from interaction, which is reaffirmed as\na necessary criterion for evaluating the fit. The validity of POFP solutions\nwith respect to the observations and other models is discussed in this context.\nThe underlying generality and fundamental principles demonstrate a larger frame\nof operation where problems in Physics and Mathematics can be solved with a\nmultitude of techniques.\n", "  In this letter we report the possible existence of a second planet in the\ntransiting extrasolar planet system HD 17156 and its interactive dynamics with\nthe previously known planet. The analysis is achieved through the \\POFP\\\noptimization software which is based on a full integration of the system's\nmultiple-body Newtonian equations of motion. The two-planet solution yields a\nsignificantly improved fit to the previously published radial velocities. The\ntwo planets are strongly interacting and exchange angular momentum in a 5:1\nmean motion resonance, yet remain stable as they mutually excite orbital\neccentricities and periastron advances.\n", "  Using Ferromagnetic Fermi liquid theory, Bedell and Blagoev derived the\ncollective low-energy excitations of a weak ferromagnet. They obtained the\nwell-known magnon (Nambu-Goldstone) mode and found a new gapped mode that was\nnever studied in weak ferromagnetic metals. In this article we have identified\nthis mode as the Higgs boson (amplitude mode) of a ferromagnetic metal. This is\nidentified as the Higgs since it can be show that it corresponds to a\nfluctuation of the amplitude of the order parameter. We use this model to\ndescribe the itinerant-electron ferromagnetic material MnSi. By fitting the\nmodel with the existing experimental results, we calculate the dynamical\nstructure function and see well-defined peaks contributed from the magnon and\nthe Higgs. Our estimates of the relative intensity of the Higgs amplitude mode\nsuggest that it can be seen in neutron scattering experiments on MnSi.\n", "  In this paper we present a combinatorial generalization of the fact that the\nnumber of plane partitions that fit in a $2a\\times b\\times b$ box is equal to\nthe number of such plane partitions that are symmetric, times the number of\nsuch plane partitions for which the transpose is the same as the complement. We\nuse the equivalent phrasing of this identity in terms of symmetry classes of\nlozenge tilings of a hexagon on the triangular lattice. Our generalization\nconsists of allowing the hexagon have certain symmetrically placed holes along\nits horizontal symmetry axis. The special case when there are no holes can be\nviewed as a new, simpler proof of the enumeration of symmetric plane\npartitions.\n", "  The Misner space is a simplified $2$-dimensional model of the $4$-dimensional\nTaub-NUT space that reproduces some of its pathological behaviours. In this\npaper we provide an explicit base of the topology of the complete Misner space\n$\\mathbb{R}^{1,1}/boost$. Besides we prove that some parts of this space, that\nbehave like topological boundaries, are equivalent to the $g$-boundaries of the\nMisner space.\n", "  We consider a non-integrable model for interacting dimers on the\ntwo-dimensional square lattice. Configurations are perfect matchings of\n$\\mathbb Z^2$, i.e. subsets of edges such that each vertex is covered exactly\nonce (\"close-packing\" condition). Dimer configurations are in bijection with\ndiscrete height functions, defined on faces $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ of $\\mathbb\nZ^2$. The non-interacting model is \"integrable\" and solvable via Kasteleyn\ntheory; it is known that all the moments of the height difference\n$h_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}-h_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}$ converge to those of the massless\nGaussian Free Field (GFF), asymptotically as\n$|{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}-{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}|\\to \\infty$. We prove that the same\nholds for small non-zero interactions, as was conjectured in the theoretical\nphysics literature. Remarkably, dimer-dimer correlation functions are instead\nnot universal and decay with a critical exponent that depends on the\ninteraction strength. Our proof is based on an exact representation of the\nmodel in terms of lattice interacting fermions, which are studied by\nconstructive field theory methods. In the fermionic language, the height\ndifference $h_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi}}-h_{\\boldsymbol{\\eta}}$ takes the form of a\nnon-local operator, consisting of a sum of monomials along an {\\it arbitrary}\npath connecting $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$. As in the\nnon-interacting case, this path-independence plays a crucial role in the proof.\n", "  We propose an extended Hubbard model with three molecular orbitals on a\nhexagonal lattice with $D_{3h}$ symmetry to study recently discovered\nsuperconductivity in A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A=K,Rb,Cs). Effective pairing\ninteractions from paramagnon fluctuations are derived within the random phase\napproximation, and are found to be most attractive in spin triplet channels. At\nsmall Hubbard $U$ and moderate Hund's coupling, the pairing arises from\n3-dimensional (3D) $\\gamma$ band and has a spatial symmetry\n$f_{y(3x^{2}-y^{2})}$, which gives line nodes in the gap function. At large\n$U$, a fully gapped $p$-wave state, $p_{z}\\hat{z}$ dominates at the quasi-1D\n$\\alpha $-band.\n", "  The phase transition between a massive dense phase and a diluted\nsuperparamagnetic phase has been studied by means of a direct molecular\ndynamics simulation. The equilibrium structures of the ferrofluid aggregate\nnucleus are obtained for different values of a temperature and an external\nmagnetic field magnitude. An approximate match of experiment and simulation has\nbeen shown for the ferrofluid phase diagram coordinates \"field-temperature\".\nThe provided phase coexistence curve has an opposite trend comparing to some of\nknown theoretical results. This contradiction has been discussed. For given\nexperimental parameters, it has been concluded that the present results\ndescribe more precisely the transition from linear chains to a dense globes\nphase. The theoretical concepts which provide the opposite binodal curve\ndependency trend match other experimental conditions: a diluted ferrofluid, a\nhigh particle coating rate, a high temperature, and/or a less particles\ncoupling constant value.\n", "  Recently, the connection between Majorana fermions bound to defects in\narbitrary dimensions, and complex momentum roots of the vanishing determinant\nof the corresponding bulk Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, has been\nestablished (EPL, 2015, $\\textbf{110}$, 67005). Based on this understanding, a\nformula has been proposed to count the number ($n$) of the zero energy Majorana\nbound states, which is related to the topological phase of the system. In this\npaper, we provide a proof of the counting formula and we apply this formula to\na variety of 1d and 2d models belonging to the classes BDI, DIII and D. We show\nthat we can successfully chart out the topological phase diagrams. Studying\nthese examples also enables us to explicitly observe the correspondence between\nthese complex momentum solutions in the Fourier space, and the localized\nMajorana fermion wavefunctions in the position space. Finally, we corroborate\nthe fact that for systems with a chiral symmetry, these solutions are the\nso-called \"exceptional points\", where two or more eigenvalues of the\ncomplexified Hamiltonian coalesce.\n", "  We investigate adsorption of a gas on the flat surface of a solid deformable\nadsorbent taking into account thermal fluctuations and analyze in detail the\neffect of thermal fluctuations on the adsorbent deformation in adsorption. The\ncondition for coexistence of two states of a bistable system of adsorbed\nparticles is derived. We establish the specific properties of the\nadsorption-induced surface normal relaxation of an adsorbent caused by thermal\nfluctuations. The mean transition times between two stable states of the\nbistable system are derived in the parabolic approximation and in the general\ncase.\n", "  We develop a method for achieving scalable transmission stabilization and\nswitching of $N$ colliding soliton sequences in optical waveguides with\nbroadband delayed Raman response and narrowband nonlinear gain-loss. We show\nthat dynamics of soliton amplitudes in $N$-sequence transmission is described\nby a generalized $N$-dimensional predator-prey model. Stability and bifurcation\nanalysis for the predator-prey model are used to obtain simple conditions on\nthe physical parameters for robust transmission stabilization as well as on-off\nand off-on switching of $M$ out of $N$ soliton sequences. Numerical simulations\nfor single-waveguide transmission with a system of $N$ coupled nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations with $2 \\le N \\le 4$ show excellent agreement with the\npredator-prey model's predictions and stable propagation over significantly\nlarger distances compared with other broadband nonlinear single-waveguide\nsystems. Moreover, stable on-off and off-on switching of multiple soliton\nsequences and stable multiple transmission switching events are demonstrated by\nthe simulations. We discuss the reasons for the robustness and scalability of\ntransmission stabilization and switching in waveguides with broadband delayed\nRaman response and narrowband nonlinear gain-loss, and explain their advantages\ncompared with other broadband nonlinear waveguides.\n", "  We study the Hamiltonian formulation for a parametrized scalar field in a\nregular bounded spatial region subject to Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary\nconditions. We generalize the work carried out by a number of authors on\nparametrized field systems to the interesting case where spatial boundaries are\npresent. The configuration space of our models contains both smooth scalar\nfields defined on the spatial manifold and spacelike embeddings from the\nspatial manifold to a target spacetime endowed with a fixed Lorentzian\nbackground metric. We pay particular attention to the geometry of the infinite\ndimensional manifold of embeddings and the description of the relevant\ngeometric objects: the symplectic form on the primary constraint submanifold\nand the Hamiltonian vector fields defined on it.\n", "  This is the third paper in a series establishing a quantitative relation\nbetween inflationary scalar field potential landscapes and the relic\nperturbations left by the collision between bubbles produced during eternal\ninflation. We introduce a new method for computing cosmological observables\nfrom numerical relativity simulations of bubble collisions in one space and one\ntime dimension. This method tiles comoving hypersurfaces with locally-perturbed\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker coordinate patches. The method extends previous\nwork, which was limited to the spacetime region just inside the future light\ncone of the collision, and allows us to explore the full bubble-collision\nspacetime. We validate our new methods against previous work, and present a\nfull set of predictions for the comoving curvature perturbation and local\nnegative spatial curvature produced by identical and non-identical bubble\ncollisions, in single scalar field models of eternal inflation. In both\ncollision types, there is a non-zero contribution to the spatial curvature and\ncosmic microwave background quadrupole. Some collisions between non-identical\nbubbles excite wall modes, giving extra structure to the predicted temperature\nanisotropies. We comment on the implications of our results for future\nobservational searches. For non-identical bubble collisions, we also find that\nthe surfaces of constant field can readjust in the presence of a collision to\nproduce spatially infinite sections that become nearly homogeneous deep into\nthe region affected by the collision. Contrary to previous assumptions, this is\ntrue even in the bubble into which the domain wall is accelerating.\n", "  We present six epochs of spectropolarimetric observations and one epoch of\nspectroscopy of the Type Ib SN iPTF 13bvn. The epochs of these observations\ncorrespond to $-$10 to $+$61 days with respect to the {\\it r}-band light curve\nmaximum. The continuum is intrinsically polarised to the $0.2-0.4\\%$ level\nthroughout the observations, implying asphericities of $\\sim10\\%$ in the shape\nof the photosphere. We observe significant line polarisation associated with\nthe spectral features of Ca II IR3, He I/Na I D, He I {\\lambda}{\\lambda}6678,\n7065, Fe II {\\lambda}4924 and O I {\\lambda}7774. We propose that an absorption\nfeature at $\\sim 6200\\mathrm{\\AA}$, usually identified as Si II $\\lambda 6355$,\nis most likely to be high velocity $\\mathrm{H\\alpha}$ at $-16,400$ $\\mathrm{km\n\\; s^{-1}}$. Two distinctly polarised components, separated in velocity, are\ndetected for both He I/Na I D and Ca II IR3, indicating the presence of two\ndiscrete line forming regions in the ejecta in both radial velocity space and\nin the plane of the sky. We use the polarisation of He I $\\lambda 5876$ as a\ntracer of sources of non-thermal excitation in the ejecta; finding that the\nbulk of the radioactive nickel was constrained to lie interior to $\\sim\n50-65\\%$ of the ejecta radius. The observed polarisation is also discussed in\nthe context of the possible progenitor system of iPTF 13bvn, with our\nobservations favouring the explosion of a star with an extended, distorted\nenvelope rather than a compact Wolf-Rayet star.\n", "  We prove that energy minimizing Yang-Mills connections on a compact\n$G_{2}$-manifold has holonomy equal to $G_{2}$ are $G_{2}$-instantons, subject\nto an extra condition on the curvature. Furthermore, we show that energy\nminimizing connections on a compact Calabi-Yau $3$-fold has holonomy equal to\n$SU(3)$ subject to a similar condition are holomorphic.\n", "  The spectral relations for the four-time fermionic Green's functions are\nderived in the most general case. The terms which correspond to the\nzero-frequency anomalies, known before only for the bosonic Green's functions,\nare separated and their connection with the second cumulants of the Boltzmann\ndistribution function is elucidated. The high-frequency expansions of the\nfour-time fermionic Green's functions are provided for different directions in\nthe frequency space.\n", "  Life is dependent on the income of energy with low entropy and the disposal\nof energy with high entropy. On Earth, the low-entropy energy is provided by\nsolar radiation and the high-entropy energy is disposed as infrared radiation\nemitted into the cold space. Here we turn the situation around and assume\ncosmic background radiation as the low-entropy source of energy for a planet\norbiting a black hole into which the high-entropy energy is disposed. We\nestimate the power that can be produced by thermodynamic processes on such a\nplanet, with a particular interest in planets orbiting a fast rotating Kerr\nblack hole as in the science fiction movie {\\em Interstellar}. We also briefly\ndiscuss a reverse Dyson sphere absorbing cosmic background radiation from the\noutside and dumping waste energy to a black hole inside.\n", "  We prove that, for Poisson transmission and recovery processes, the classic\nSusceptible $\\to$ Infected $\\to$ Recovered (SIR) epidemic model of Kermack and\nMcKendrick provides, for any given time $t>0$, a strict lower bound on the\nexpected number of suscpetibles and a strict upper bound on the expected number\nof recoveries in the general stochastic SIR epidemic. The proof is based on the\nrecent message passing representation of SIR epidemics applied to a complete\ngraph.\n", "  Interaction-driven topological phase transitions in Dirac semimetals are\ninvestigated by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. The\ninteraction among Dirac fermions is introduced by coupling them to Ising spins\nthat realize the quantum dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising\nmodel. The ground state phase diagram, in which the tuning parameters are the\ntransverse field and the coupling between fermion and Ising spins, is\ndetermined. At weak and intermediate coupling, a second-order Ising quantum\nphase transition and a first-order topological phase transition between two\ntopologically distinct Dirac semimetals are observed. Interestingly, at the\nlatter, the Dirac points smear out to form nodal lines in the Brillouin zone,\nand collective bosonic fluctuations with SO(4) symmetry are strongly enhanced.\nAt strong coupling, these two phase boundaries merge into a first-order\ntransition.\n", "  When a phase singularity is suddenly imprinted on the axis of an ordinary\nGaussian beam, an optical vortex appears and starts to grow radially, by effect\nof diffraction. This radial growth and the subsequent evolution of the optical\nvortex under focusing or imaging can be well described in general within the\nrecently introduced theory of circular beams, which generalize the\nhypergeometric-Gaussian beams and which obey novel kinds of ABCD rules. Here,\nwe investigate experimentally these vortex propagation phenomena and test the\nvalidity of circular-beam theory. Moreover, we analyze the difference in radial\nstructure between the newly generated optical vortex and the vortex obtained in\nthe image plane, where perfect imaging would lead to complete closure of the\nvortex core.\n", "  The \"thermal operations\" framework developed in past works is used to model\nthe evolution of microscopic quantum systems in contact with thermal baths.\nHere we extend this model to bipartite devices with one part acting as a\ncontrol external to the system--bath setup. We define the operations of such\nhybrid devices as conditioned thermal operations. We examine the resource under\nthese operations, which we call conditional athermality. In the quasiclassical\nlimit, we quantify this resource and find the conditions for its conversion\nbetween different forms.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for spin determination of a heavy diboson\nresonance using angular observables. Focusing in particular on boosted fully\nhadronic final states, we detail both the differences in signal efficiencies\nand distortions of differential distributions resulting from various jet\nsubstructure techniques. We treat the 2 TeV diboson excess as a case study, but\nour results are generally applicable to any future discovery in the diboson\nchannel. Scrutinizing ATLAS and CMS analyses at 8 TeV and 13 TeV, we find that\nthe specific cuts employed in these analyses have a tremendous impact on the\ndiscrimination power between different signal hypotheses. We discuss modified\ncuts that can offer a significant boost to spin sensitivity in a post-discovery\nera. Even without altered cuts, we show that CMS, and partly also ATLAS, will\nbe able to distinguish between spin 0, 1, or 2 new physics diboson resonances\nat the $2\\sigma$ level with 30 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV data, for our 2 TeV case\nstudy.\n", "  The pristine graphene is strongly diamagnetic. However, graphene with single\ncarbon atom defects could exhibit paramagnetism with local magnetic moments ~\n1.5 per vacancy1-6. Theoretically, both the electrons and electrons of graphene\ncontribute to the magnetic moment of the defects, and the pi magnetism is\ncharacterizing of two spin-split DOS (density-of-states) peaks close to the\nDirac point1,6. Since its prediction, many experiments attempt to study this pi\nmagnetism in graphene, whereas, only a notable resonance peak has been observed\naround the atomic defects6-9, leaving the pi magnetism experimentally so\nelusive. Here, we report direct experimental evidence of the pi magnetism by\nusing scanning tunnelling microscope. We demonstrate that the localized state\nof the atomic defects is split into two DOS peaks with energy separations of\nseveral tens meV and the two spin-polarized states degenerate into a profound\npeak at positions with distance of ~ 1 nm away from the monovacancy. Strong\nmagnetic fields further increase the energy separations of the two\nspin-polarized peaks and lead to a Zeeman-like splitting. The effective\ng-factors geff around the atomic defect is measured to be about 40. Such a\ngiant enhancement of the g-factor is attributed to the strong spin polarization\nof electron density and large electron-electron interactions near the atomic\nvacancy.\n", "  At low enough temperatures and high densities, the equilibrium configuration\nof an ensemble of ultrasoft particles is a self-assembled, ordered,\ncluster-crystal. In the present work we explore the out-of-equilibrium dynamics\nfor a two-dimensional realization, which is relevant to superconducting\nmaterials with multi-scale intervortex forces. We find that for small\ntemperatures following a quench, the suppression of the thermally-activated\nparticle hopping hinders the ordering. This results in a glass transition for a\nmonodispersed ensemble, for which we derive a microscopic explanation in terms\nof an \"effective polydispersity\" induced by multi-scale interactions. This\ndemonstrates that a vortex glass can form in clean systems of thin films of\n\"type-1.5\" superconductors. An additional setup to study this physics can be\nlayered superconducting systems, where the shape of the effective vortex-vortex\ninteractions can be engineered.\n", "  We present strategies to search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons decaying to\ntop quark pairs, as often occurs at low $\\tan \\beta$ in type II two Higgs\ndoublet models such as the Higgs sector of the MSSM. The resonant production\nchannel is unsatisfactory due to interference with the SM background. We\ninstead propose to utilize same-sign dilepton signatures arising from the\nproduction of heavy Higgs bosons in association with one or two top quarks and\nsubsequent decay to a top pair. We find that for heavier neutral Higgs bosons\nthe production in association with one top quark provides greater sensitivity\nthan production in association with two top quarks. We obtain current limits at\nthe LHC using Run I data at 8 TeV and forecast the sensitivity of a dedicated\nanalysis during Run II at 14 TeV. Then we perform a detailed BDT study for the\n14 TeV LHC and a future 100 TeV collider.\n", "  The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates\nfrom the difficulty of describing the non-trivial correlations encoded in the\nexponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that\nsystematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to\na tractable computational form, for some notable cases of physical interest. We\nintroduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial\nneural networks with variable number of hidden neurons. A\nreinforcement-learning scheme is then demonstrated, capable of either finding\nthe ground-state or describing the unitary time evolution of complex\ninteracting quantum systems. We show that this approach achieves very high\naccuracy in the description of equilibrium and dynamical properties of\nprototypical interacting spins models in both one and two dimensions, thus\noffering a new powerful tool to solve the quantum many-body problem.\n", "  We present two methods for determining the significance of a stochastic\ngravitational-wave (GW) background affecting a pulsar-timing array, where\ndetection is based on evidence for quadrupolar spatial correlations between\npulsars. Rather than constructing noise simulations, we eliminate the GWB\nspatial correlations in the true datasets to assess detection significance with\nall real data features intact. In our first method, we perform random phase\nshifts in the signal-model basis functions. This phase shifting eliminates\nsignal phase coherence between pulsars, while keeping the statistical\nproperties of the pulsar timing residuals intact. We then explore a method to\nnull correlations between pulsars by using a \"scrambled\" overlap-reduction\nfunction in the signal model for the array. This scrambled function is\northogonal to what we expect of a real GW background signal. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of these methods using Bayesian model selection on a set of simulated\ndatasets that contain a stochastic GW signal, timing noise, undiagnosed\nglitches, and uncertainties in the Solar system ephemeris. Finally, we\nintroduce an overarching formalism under which these two techniques are\nnaturally linked. These methods are immediately applicable to all current\npulsar-timing array datasets, and should become standard tools for future\nanalyses.\n", "  By measuring the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 1/T_1 relaxation rate in\nthe Br (bond) doped DTN compound, Ni(Cl(1-x)Br_x)2-4SC(NH2)2 (DTNX), we show\nthat the low-energy spin dynamics of its high magnetic field \"Bose-glass\"\nregime is dominated by a strong peak of spin fluctuations found at the nearly\ndoping-independent position H* = 13.6 T. From its temperature and field\ndependence we conclude that this corresponds to a level crossing of the energy\nlevels related to the doping-induced impurity states. Observation of the local\nNMR signal from the spin adjacent to the doped Br allowed us to fully\ncharacterize this impurity state. We have thus quantified a microscopic\ntheoretical model that paves the way to better understanding of the Bose-glass\nphysics in DTNX, as revealed in the related theoretical study [M. Dupont, S.\nCapponi, and N. Laflorencie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 067204 (2017),\narXiv:1610.05136].\n", "  We perform a tomographic baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) analysis using\nthe monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of the redshift-space galaxy power\nspectrum measured from the pre-reconstructed combined galaxy sample of the\ncompleted Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS) Data Release (DR)12 covering the redshift range of $0.20<z<0.75$.\nBy allowing for overlap between neighbouring redshift slices, we successfully\nobtained the isotropic and anisotropic BAO distance measurements within nine\nredshift slices to a precision of $1.5\\%-3.4\\%$ for $D_V/r_d$, $1.8\\% -4.2\\%$\nfor $D_A/r_d$ and $3.7\\% - 7.5\\%$ for $H \\ r_d$, depending on effective\nredshifts. We provide our BAO measurement of $D_A/r_d$ and $H \\ r_d$ with the\nfull covariance matrix, which can be used for cosmological implications. Our\nmeasurements are consistent with those presented in \\citet{Acacia}, in which\nthe BAO distances are measured at three effective redshifts. We constrain dark\nenergy parameters using our measurements, and find an improvement of the\nFigure-of-Merit of dark energy in general due to the temporal BAO information\nresolved. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering\ndataset from BOSS.\n", "  Inelastic scattering processes such as Brillouin scattering can often\nfunction in cascaded regimes and this is likely to occur in certain integrated\nopto-acoustic devices. We develop a Hamiltonian formalism for cascaded\nBrillouin scattering valid for both quantum and classical regimes. By regarding\nBrillouin scattering as the interaction of a single acoustic envelope and a\nsingle optical envelope that covers all Stokes and anti-Stokes orders, we\nobtain a compact model that is well suited for numerical implementation,\nextension to include other optical nonlinearities or short pulses, and\napplication in the quantum-optics domain. We then theoretically analyze\nintra-mode forward Brillouin scattering (FBS) for arbitrary waveguides with and\nwithout optical dispersion. In the absence of optical dispersion, we find an\nexact analytical solution. With a perturbative approach, we furthermore solve\nthe case of weak optical dispersion. Our work leads to several key results on\nintra-mode FBS. For negligible dispersion, we show that cascaded intra-mode FBS\nresults in a pure phase modulation and discuss how this necessitates specific\nexperimental methods for the observation of fibre-based and integrated FBS.\nFurther, we discuss how the descriptions that have been established in these\ntwo classes of waveguides connect to each other and to the broader context of\ncavity opto-mechanics and Raman scattering. Finally, we draw an unexpected\nstriking similarity between FBS and discrete diffraction phenomena in waveguide\narrays, which makes FBS an interesting candidate for future research in\nquantum-optics.\n", "  By starting with a seed Newtonian potential-density pair we construct\nrelativistic thick spherical shell models for a Majumdar-Papapetrou type\nconformastatic spacetime. As a simple example, we consider a family of\nPlummer-Hernquist type relativistic spherical shells. As a second application,\nthese structures are then used to model a system composite by a dust disk and a\nhalo of matter. We study the equatorial circular motion of test particles\naround such configurations. Also the stability of the orbits is analyzed for\nradial perturbation using an extension of the Rayleigh criterion. The models\nconsidered satisfying all the energy conditions.\n", "  We create low-entropy states of neutral atoms by utilizing a conceptually new\noptical-lattice technique that relies on a high-precision, high-bandwidth\nsynthesis of light polarization. Polarization-synthesized optical lattices\nprovide two fully controllable optical lattice potentials, each of them\nconfining only atoms in either one of the two long-lived hyperfine states. By\nemploying one lattice as the storage register and the other one as the shift\nregister, we provide a proof of concept using four atoms that selected regions\nof the periodic potential can be filled with one particle per site. We expect\nthat our results can be scaled up to thousands of atoms by employing a\natom-sorting algorithm with logarithmic complexity, which is enabled by\npolarization-synthesized optical lattices. Vibrational entropy is subsequently\nremoved by sideband cooling methods. Our results pave the way for a bottom-up\napproach to creating ultralow-entropy states of a many-body system.\n", "  We relate the existence of Noether global conserved currents associated with\nlocally variational field equations to existence of global solutions for a\nlocal variational problem generating global equations. Both can be\ncharacterized as the vanishing of certain cohomology classes.\n  In the case of a 3-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory, the variationally\nfeatured cohomological obstruction to the existence of global solutions is\nsharp and equivalent to the usual obstruction in terms of the Chern\ncharacteristic class for the flatness of a principal connection.\n  We suggest a parallelism between the geometric interpretation of\ncharacteristic classes as obstruction to the existence of flat principal\nconnections and the interpretation of certain de Rham cohomology classes to be\nthe obstruction to the existence of global extremals for a local variational\nprinciple.\n", "  We consider localized qubits evolving around a black hole following a quantum\nadiabatic dynamics. We develop a geometric structure (based on fibre bundles)\npermitting to describe the quantum states of a qubit and the spacetime geometry\nin a single framework. The quantum decoherence induced by the black hole on the\nqubit is analysed in this framework (the role of the dynamical and geometric\nphases in this decoherence is treated), especially for the quantum\nteleportation protocol when one qubit falls to the event horizon. A simple\nformula to compute the fidelity of the teleportation is derived. The case of a\nSchwarzschild black hole is analysed.\n", "  This article describes a numerical procedure designed to tune the parameters\nof periodically-driven dynamical systems to a state in which they exhibit rich\ndynamical behavior. This is achieved by maximizing the diversity of subharmonic\nsolutions available to the system within a range of the parameters that define\nthe driving. The procedure is applied to a problem of interest in computational\nneuroscience: a circuit composed of two interacting populations of neurons\nunder external periodic forcing. Depending on the parameters that define the\ncircuit, such as the weights of the connections between the populations, the\nresponse of the circuit to the driving can be strikingly rich and diverse. The\nprocedure is employed to find circuits that, when driven by external input,\nexhibit multiple stable patterns of periodic activity organized in complex\ntuning diagrams and signatures of low dimensional chaos.\n", "  We investigate the role of lithographically-induced strain relaxation in a\nmicron-scaled device fabricated from epitaxial thin films of the\nmagnetostrictive alloy Fe81Ga19. The strain relaxation due to lithographic\npatterning induces a magnetic anisotropy that competes with the\nmagnetocrystalline and shape induced anisotropies to play a crucial role in\nstabilising a flux-closing domain pattern. We use magnetic imaging,\nmicromagnetic calculations and linear elastic modelling to investigate a region\nclose to the edges of an etched structure. This highly-strained edge region has\na significant influence on the magnetic domain configuration due to an induced\nmagnetic anisotropy resulting from the inverse magnetostriction effect. We\ninvestigate the competition between the strain-induced and shape-induced\nanisotropy energies, and the resultant stable domain configurations, as the\nwidth of the bar is reduced to the nanoscale range. Understanding this\nbehaviour will be important when designing hybrid magneto-electric spintronic\ndevices based on highly magnetostrictive materials.\n", "  The ice surface softening during friction is shown as a result of spontaneous\nappearance of shear strain caused by external supercritical heating. This\ntransformation is described by the Kelvin-Voigt equation for viscoelastic\nmedium, by the relaxation equations of Landau-Khalatnikov-type and for heat\nconductivity. The study reveals that the above-named equations formally\ncoincide with the synergetic Lorenz system, where the order parameter is\nreduced to shear strain, stress acts as the conjugate field, and temperature\nplays the role of a control parameter. Using the adiabatic approximation, the\nstationary values of these quantities are derived. The examination of\ndependence of the relaxed shear modulus on strain explains the ice surface\nsoftening according to the first-order transition mechanism. The critical\nheating rate is proportional to the relaxed value of the ice shear modulus and\ninversely proportional to its typical value.\n", "  The mixed spin-1/2 and spin-5/2 Ising model is investigated on the Bethe\nlattice in the presence of a magnetic field $h$ via the recursion relations\nmethod. A ground-state phase diagram is constructed which may be needful to\nexplore important regions of the temperature phase diagrams of a model. The\norder-parameters, the corresponding response functions and internal energy are\nthoroughly investigated in order to typify the nature of the phase transition\nand to get the corresponding temperatures. So, in the absence of the magnetic\nfield, the temperature phase diagrams are displayed in the case of an equal\ncrystal-field on the $(k_{\\textrm{B}}T/|J|, \\,D/|J|)$ plane when $q=3,4$, $5$\nand $6$. The model only exhibits the second-order phase transition for\nappropriate values of physical parameters of a model.\n", "  A few studies have been recently presented for the existence of oxygen in\ndiamond, for example, the N3 EPR centres have been theoretically and\nexperimentally assigned the model made up from complex of substitutional\nnitrogen and substitutional oxygen as nearest neighbours. We present ab initio\ncalculations of substitutional oxygen in diamond in terms of stability,\nelectronic structures, geometry and hyperfine interaction and show that\nsubstitutional oxygen with C$_{2v}\\,$, $S=1$ is the ground state configuration.\nWe find that oxygen produces either a donor or acceptor level depending on the\nposition of the Fermi level.\n", "  In this paper we have discussed theoretical concepts and presented numerical\nresults of local field enhancement at the core of different assemblages of\nmetal/dielectric cylindrical nanoinclusions embedded in a linear dielectric\nhost matrix. The obtained results show that for a composite with metal coated\ninclusions there exist two peak values of the enhancement factor at two\ndifferent resonant frequencies. The existence of the second maxima becomes more\nimportant for a larger volume fraction of the metal part of the inclusion. For\ndielectric coated metal core inclusions and pure metal inclusions there is only\none resonant frequency and one peak value of the enhancement factor. The\nenhancement of an electromagnetic wave is promising for the existence of\nnonlinear optical phenomena such as optical bistability which is important in\noptical communication and in optical computing such as optical switch and\nmemory elements.\n", "  Manipulating the self-assembly nanostructures with combined different control\nmeasures is emerging as a promising route for numerous applications to generate\ntemplates and scaffolds for nanostructured materials. Here, the two different\ncontrol measures are a cylindrical confinement and an oscillatory shear flow.\nWe study the phase behavior of diblock copolymer confined in nanopore under\noscillatory shear by considering different $D/L_0$ ($D$ is the diameter of the\ncylindrical nanopore, $L_0$ is the domain spacing) and different shears via\nCell Dynamics Simulation. Under different $D/L_0$, in the system occurs\ndifferent morphology evolution and phase transition with the changing of\namplitude and frequency. Meanwhile, it forms a series of novel morphologies.\nFor each $D/L_0$, we construct a phase diagram of different forms and analyze\nthe reason why the phase transition occurs. We find that although the\nmorphologies are different under different $D/L_0$, the reason of the phase\ntransition with the changing of amplitude and frequency is roughly the same,\nall caused by the interplay of the field effect and confinement effect. These\nresults can guide an experimentalist to an easy method of creating the ordered,\ndefect-free nanostructured materials using a combination of the cylindrical\nconfinement and oscillatory shear flow.\n", "  The first-order phase transitions in the lattice model of Janus-like\nparticles confined in slit-like pores are studied. We assume a cubic lattice\nwith molecules that can freely change their orientation on a lattice site.\nMoreover, the molecules can interact with the pore walls with\norientation-dependent forces. The performed calculations are limited to the\ncases of bilayers. Our emphasis is on the competition between the fluid-wall\nand fluid-fluid interactions. The oriented structures formed in the systems in\nwhich the fluid-wall interactions acting contrary to the fluid-fluid\ninteractions differ from those appearing in the systems with neutral walls or\nwith walls attracting the repulsive parts of fluid molecules.\n", "  In the presented report, the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect in layered\nconductors is investigated. Considering a Fermi surface (FS) consisting of a\nslightly corrugated cylinder and two corrugated planes distributed periodically\nin the momentum space, the thermoelectric effects are considered under general\nassumptions for the value of a magnetic breakdown probability. As a result of\nan external generalized force, the FS sheets in layered conductors with a\nmultisheet FS appear to be so close that the charge carriers (as a result of\nmagnetic breakdown) can move from one FS sheet to another. In addition, the\ndistribution functions of the charge carriers and the magnetic breakdown\noscillations of thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer, under\ndifferent values and orientations of the magnetic field, $B$, are calculated.\nIt is shown that if the magnetic field is deflected from the $xz$-plane at an\nangle $\\varphi$, the oscillation part of a thermoelectrical field along the\nnormal to the layer under condition $\\sin\\varphi\\tan\\vartheta \\gg 1$ is mainly\ndetermined with the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect.\n", "  In a previous work, we reported exact results of energies of the ground state\nin the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) regime for systems with up to\n$N_{\\text{e}} = 6$ electrons at the filling factor $\\nu = 1/3$ by using the\nmethod of complex polar coordinates. In this work, we display interesting\ncomputational details of the previous calculation and extend the calculation to\n$N_{\\text{e}} = 7$ electrons at $\\nu = 1/3$. Moreover, similar exact results\nare derived at the filling $\\nu = 1/5$ for systems with up to $N_{\\text{e}} =\n6$ electrons. The results that we obtained by analytical calculation are in\ngood agreement with their analogues ones derived by the method of Monte Carlo\nin a precedent work.\n", "  We study two-dimensional equilibrium configurations of nematic liquid crystal\n(NLC) director in a cell confined between two parallel surfaces: a planar\nsurface and a spatially modulated one. The relief of the modulated surface is\ndescribed by a smooth periodic sine-like function. The director easy axis\norientation is homeotropic at one of the bounding surfaces and is planar at the\nother one. Strong NLC anchoring with both surfaces is assumed. We consider the\ncase where disclination lines occur in the bulk of NLC strictly above local\nextrema of the modulated surface. These disclination lines run along the crests\nand troughs of the relief waves. In the approximation of planar director\ndeformations we obtain analytical expressions describing a director\ndistribution in the bulk of the cell. Equilibrium distances from disclination\nlines to the modulated surface are calculated and their dependences on the cell\nthickness and the period and depth of the surface relief are studied. It is\nshown that the distances from disclination lines to the modulated surface\ndecrease as the depth of the relief increases.\n", "  The paper develops a method for the numerical simulation of a free-surface\nflow of incompressible viscous fluid around a streamlined body. The body is a\nrigid stationary construction partially submerged in the fluid. The application\nwe are interested in the paper is a flow around a surface mounted offshore oil\nplatform. The numerical method builds on a hybrid finite volume / finite\ndifference discretization using adaptive octree cubic meshes. The mesh is\ndynamically refined towards the free surface and the construction. Special care\nis taken to devise a discretization for the case of curvilinear boundaries and\ninterfaces immersed in the octree Cartesian background computational mesh. To\ndemonstrate the accuracy of the method, we show the results for two benchmark\nproblems: the sloshing 3D container and the channel laminar flow passing the 3D\ncylinder of circular cross-section. Further, we simulate numerically a flow\nwith surface waves around an offshore oil platform for the realistic set of\ngeophysical data.\n", "  We numerically investigate local defectiveness control of self-assembled\ndiblock copolymer patterns through appropriate substrate design. We use a\nnonlocal Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation for the phase separation dynamics of\ndiblock copolymers. We discretize the nonlocal CH equation by an\nunconditionally stable finite difference scheme on a tapered trench design and,\nin particular, we use Dirichlet, Neumann, and periodic boundary conditions. The\nvalue at the Dirichlet boundary comes from an energy-minimizing equilibrium\nlamellar profile. We solve the resulting discrete equations using a\nGauss-Seidel iterative method. We perform various numerical experiments such as\neffects of channel width, channel length, and angle on the phase separation\ndynamics. The simulation results are consistent with the previous experimental\nobservations.\n", "  We build a theoretical model for the electronic properties of the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) electron gas that forms at the interface between\ninsulating SrTiO$_3$ and a number of polar cap layers, including LaTiO$_3$,\nLaAlO$_3$, and GdTiO$_3$. The model treats conduction electrons within a\ntight-binding approximation, and the dielectric polarization via a\nLandau-Devonshire free energy that incorporates strontium titanate's strongly\nnonlinear, nonlocal, and temperature-dependent dielectric response. The\nself-consistent band structure comprises a mix of quantum 2D states that are\ntightly bound to the interface, and quasi-three-dimensional (3D) states that\nextend hundreds of unit cells into the SrTiO$_3$ substrate. We find that there\nis a substantial shift of electrons away from the interface into the 3D tails\nas temperature is lowered from 300 K to 10 K. This shift is least important at\nhigh electron densities ($\\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$), but becomes substantial at\nlow densities; for example, the total electron density within 4~nm of the\ninterface changes by a factor of two for 2D electron densities $\\sim 10^{13}$\ncm$^{-2}$. We speculate that the quasi-3D tails form the low-density\nhigh-mobility component of the interfacial electron gas that is widely inferred\nfrom magnetoresistance measurements.\n", "  The possibility of investigating the dynamics of solids on timescales faster\nthan the thermalization of the internal degrees of freedom has disclosed novel\nnon-equilibrium phenomena that have no counterpart at equilibrium. Transition\nmetal oxides (TMOs) provide an interesting playground in which the correlations\namong the charges in the metal $d$-orbitals give rise to a wealth of intriguing\nelectronic and thermodynamic properties involving the spin, charge, lattice and\norbital orders. Furthermore, the physical properties of TMOs can be engineered\nat the atomic level, thus providing the platform to investigate the transport\nphenomena on timescales of the order of the intrinsic decoherence time of the\ncharge excitations.\n  Here, we review and discuss three paradigmatic examples of transient emerging\nproperties that are expected to open new fields of research: i) the creation of\nnon-thermal magnetic states in spin-orbit Mott insulators; ii) the possible\nexploitation of quantum paths for the transport and collection of charge\nexcitations in TMO-based few-monolayers devices; iii) the transient wave-like\nbehavior of the temperature field in strongly anisotropic TMOs.\n", "  Iron-pnictides are hotly studied since 2008 in the superconducting materials\nresearch area, due to their special properties and unclear mechanism. Big\nachievement has been made in the pnictide research during the past years. For\npractical uses, pnictide superconductor should be fabricated in a long wire\nform which can be used for different devices. In this work, 100 m class 7-core\nSr0.6K0.4Fe2As2 (Sr122) tapes have been made using the powder-in-tube\ntechnique, which is reported for the first time. Clearly, an average Jc of\n1.3x10^4 A/cm^2 at 10 T was reached over the 115 meter length, showing a high\nproperty and good uniformity of 100 meter level Sr122 tapes. Using the 10 m\nlong Sr122 tapes, two double-pancake coils were fabricated by a wind and\nreaction technique. No transport current could be measured for the coil made\nfrom the mono-filamentary tape. However, transport Ic was obtained in the coil\nmade from the 7-filamentary tape. The factors which affect the superconducting\nproperty of the coil were discussed in this work.\n", "  Self-testing allows classical referees to verify the quantum behaviour of\nsome untrusted devices. Recently we developed a framework for building large\nself-tests by repeating a smaller self-test many times in parallel. However,\nthe framework did not apply to the CHSH test, which tests a maximally entangled\npair of qubits. CHSH is the most well known and widely used test of this type.\nHere we extend the parallel self-testing framework to build parallel CHSH\nself-tests for any number of pairs of maximally entangled qubits. Our\nconstruction achieves an error bound which is polynomial in the number of\ntested qubit pairs.\n", "  We study a model SrTiO$_3$ interface in which conduction $t_{2g}$ electrons\ncouple to the ferroelectric (FE) phonon mode. We treat the FE mode within a\nself-consistent phonon theory that captures its quantum critical behavior, and\nshow that proximity to the quantum critical point leads to universal tails in\nthe electron density of the form $n(z) \\sim (\\lambda+z)^{-2}$, where $\\lambda\n\\sim T^{2-d/\\mathfrak{z}}$, with $d=3$ the dimensionality and $\\mathfrak{z}=1$\nthe dynamical critical exponent. Implications for the metal-insulator\ntransition at low electron density are discussed.\n", "  We investigate diagonal Bianchi-I spacetimes in the presence of viscous\nfluids by using the shear and the anisotropic pressure components as the basic\nvariables, where the viscosity is driven by the (second-order) causal\nthermodynamics. A few exact solutions are presented, among which we mention the\nanisotropic versions of de Sitter/anti-de Sitter geometries as well as an\nasymptotically isotropic spacetime presenting an effective constant cosmic\nacceleration without any cosmological constant. The qualitative analysis of the\nsolutions for barotropic fluids with linear equations of state suggests that\nthe behaviour is quite general.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the form and interaction of dipolar\nbright solitons across the full parameter space afforded by dipolar\nBose-Einstein condensates, revealing the rich behaviour introduced by the\nnon-local nonlinearity. Working within an effective one-dimensional\ndescription, we map out the existence of the soliton solutions and show three\ncollisional regimes: free collisions, bound state formation and soliton fusion.\nFinally, we examine the solitons in their full three-dimensional form through a\nvariational approach; along with regimes of instability to collapse and runaway\nexpansion, we identify regimes of stability which are accessible to current\nexperiments.\n", "  We theoretically study Coulomb drag between two helical edges with broken\nspin-rotational symmetry, such as would occur in two capacitively coupled\nquantum spin Hall insulators. For the helical edges, Coulomb drag is\nparticularly interesting because it specifically probes the inelastic\ninteractions that break the conductance quantization for a single edge. Using\nthe kinetic equation formalism, supplemented by bosonization, we find that the\ndrag resistivity $\\rho_D$ exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the temperature\n$T$. In the limit of low $T$, $\\rho_D$ vanishes with decreasing $T$ as a power\nlaw if intraedge interactions are not too strong. This is in stark contrast to\nCoulomb drag in conventional quantum wires, where $\\rho_D$ diverges at $T\\to 0$\nirrespective of the strength of repulsive interactions. Another unusual\nproperty of Coulomb drag between the helical edges concerns higher $T$ for\nwhich, unlike in the Luttinger liquid model, drag is mediated by plasmons. The\nspecial type of plasmon-mediated drag can be viewed as a distinguishing feature\nof the helical liquid---because it requires peculiar Umklapp scattering only\navailable in the presence of a Dirac point in the electron spectrum.\n", "  Exact solutions for local equilibrium and nonequilibrium out-of-time-ordered\ncorrelation (OTOC) functions are obtained for a lattice fermion model with\non-site interactions, namely the Falicov-Kimball (FK) model, in the large\ndimensional and thermodynamic limit. Our approach is based on the\nnonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory generalized to an extended\nKadanoff-Baym contour. We find that the density-density OTOC is most enhanced\nat intermediate coupling around the metal-insulator phase transition. In the\nhigh-temperature limit, the OTOC remains nontrivially finite and\ninteraction-dependent, even though dynamical charge correlations probed by an\nordinary response function are completely suppressed. We propose an experiment\nto measure OTOCs of fermionic lattice systems including the FK and Hubbard\nmodels in ultracold atomic systems.\n", "  We study quantum measurements of temporal equilibrium fluctuations in\nmacroscopic quantum systems. It is shown that the fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem, as a relation between observed quantities, is partially violated in\nquantum systems, even if measurements are made in an ideal way that emulates\nclassical ideal measurements as closely as possible. This is a genuine quantum\neffect that survives on a macroscopic scale. We also show that the state\nrealized during measurements of temporal equilibrium fluctuations is a\n`squeezed equilibrium state,' which is macroscopically identical to the\npre-measurement equilibrium state but is squeezed by the measurement. It is a\ntime-evolving state, in which macrovariables fluctuate and relax. We also\nexplain some of subtle but important points, careless treatments of which often\nlead to unphysical results, of the linear response theory.\n", "  The Naming Game is an agent-based model where individuals communicate to name\nan initially unnamed object. On a large class of networks continual pairwise\ninteractions lead the system to an ultimate consensus state, in which agents\nconverge on a globally shared name. Soon after the introduction of the model,\nit was observed in literature that on community-based networks the path to\nconsensus passes through metastable multi-language states. Subsequently, it was\nproposed to use this feature as a mean to discover communities in a given\nnetwork. In this paper we show that metastable states correspond to genuine\nmulti-language phases, emerging in the thermodynamic limit when the fraction of\nlinks connecting communities drops below critical thresholds. In particular, we\nstudy the transition to multi-language states in the stochastic block model and\non networks with community overlap. We also examine the scaling of critical\nthresholds under variations of topological properties of the network, such as\nthe number and relative size of communities and the structure of\nintra-/inter-community links. Our results provide a theoretical justification\nfor the proposed use of the model as a community-detection algorithm.\n", "  A novel experimental paradigm and a novel modelling approach are presented to\ninvestigate oscillatory human motor performance by means of a key concept from\ncondensed matter physics, namely, thermodynamic state variables. To this end,\nin the novel experimental paradigm participants performed pendulum swinging\nmovements at self-selected oscillation frequencies in contrast to earlier\nstudies in which pacing signals were used. Moreover, in the novel modelling\napproach, a canonical-dissipative limit cycle oscillator model was used with a\nconservative part that accounts for nonharmonic oscillator components in\ncontrast to earlier studies in which only harmonic components were considered.\nConsistent with the Landau theory of magnetic phase transitions, we found that\nthe oscillator model free energy decayed when participants performed\noscillations further and further away from the Hopf bifurcation point of the\ncanonical-dissipative limit cycle oscillator.\n", "  The quantization of optical fields in vacuum has been known for decades, but\nextending the field quantization to lossy and dispersive media in\nnonequilibrium conditions has proven to be complicated due to the\nposition-dependent electric and magnetic responses of the media. In fact,\nconsistent position-dependent quantum models for the photon number in resonant\nstructures have only been formulated very recently and only for dielectric\nmedia. Here we present a general position-dependent quantized fluctuational\nelectrodynamics (QFED) formalism that extends the consistent field quantization\nto describe the photon number also in the presence of magnetic field-matter\ninteractions. It is shown that the magnetic fluctuations provide an additional\ndegree of freedom in media where the magnetic coupling to the field is\nprominent. Therefore, the field quantization requires an additional independent\nnoise operator that is commuting with the conventional bosonic noise operator\ndescribing the polarization current fluctuations in dielectric media. In\naddition to allowing the detailed description of field fluctuations, our\nmethods provide practical tools for modeling optical energy transfer and the\nformation of thermal balance in general dielectric and magnetic nanodevices. We\nuse the QFED to investigate the magnetic properties of microcavity systems to\ndemonstrate an example geometry in which it is possible to probe fields arising\nfrom the electric and magnetic source terms. We show that, as a consequence of\nthe magnetic Purcell effect, the tuning of the position of an emitter layer\nplaced inside a vacuum cavity can make the emissivity of a magnetic emitter to\nexceed the emissivity of a corresponding electric emitter.\n", "  We use the framework of the p19MSSM to perform a fit to the mild excesses\nover the Standard Model background recently observed in three bins of the ATLAS\n1-lepton + (b-)jets + MET search. We find a few types of spectra that can fit\nthe emerging signal and at the same time are not excluded by other LHC\nsearches. They can be grouped roughly in two categories. The first class is\ncharacterized by the presence of one stop or stop and sbottoms with mass in the\nballpark of 700-800 GeV and a neutralino LSP of mass around 400 GeV, with or\nwithout the additional presence of an intermediate chargino. In the second type\nof scenarios the stop, lightest chargino, sbottom if present, and the\nneutralino are about or heavier than ~650 GeV and the signal originates from\ncascade decays of squarks of the 1st and 2nd generation, which should have a\nmass of 1.1-1.2 TeV. For the best-fit scenarios, we compare the global\nchi-squared with respect to several ATLAS and CMS searches with the\ncorresponding chi-squared of the Standard Model expectation, showing that the\nputative signal is also favored globally with respect to the background only\nhypothesis. We point out that if the observed excess persists in the next round\nof data, it should be accompanied by associated significant excesses in\nall-hadronic final state searches.\n", "  We propose a procedure to reconstruct characteristic features of an unknown\nstochastic system from the long-time full counting statistics of some of the\nsystem's transitions that are monitored by a detector. The full counting\nstatistics is conveniently parametrized by so-called generalized factorial\ncumulants. Taking only a few of them as input information is sufficient to\nreconstruct important features such as the lower bound of the system dimension\nand the full spectrum of relaxation rates. The use of generalized factorial\ncumulants reveals system dimensions and rates that are hidden for ordinary\ncumulants. We illustrate the inverse counting-statistics procedure for two\nmodel systems: a single-level quantum dot in a Zeeman field and a\nsingle-electron box subjected to sequential and Andreev tunneling.\n", "  Although Lorentz invariance forbids the presence of a term that tilts the\nenergy-momentum relation in the Weyl Hamiltonian, a tilted dispersion is not\nforbidden and, in fact, generic for condensed matter realizations of Weyl\nsemimetals. We here investigate the combined effect of such a tilted Weyl\ndispersion and the presence of potential disorder. In particular, we address\nthe influence of a tilt on the disorder-induced phase transition between a\nquasi-ballistic phase at weak disorder, in which the disorder is an irrelevant\nperturbation, and a diffusive phase at strong disorder. Our main result is that\nthe presence of a tilt leads to a reduction of the critical disorder strength\nfor this transition or, equivalently, that increasing the tilt at fixed\ndisorder strength drives the system through the phase transition to the\ndiffusive strong-disorder phase. Notably this obscures the tilt induced\nLifshitz transition to an over tilted type-II Weyl phase at any finite disorder\nstrength. Our results are supported by analytical calculations using the\nself-consistent Born approximation and numerical calculations of the density of\nstates and of transport properties.\n", "  Recently, the topics of many-body localization (MBL) and one-dimensional\nstrongly interacting few-body systems have received a lot of interest. These\ntwo topics have been largely developed separately. However, the generality of\nthe latter as far as external potentials are concerned -- including random and\nquasirandom potentials -- and their shared spatial dimensionality, makes it an\ninteresting way of dealing with MBL in the strongly interacting regime.\nUtilising tools developed for few-body systems we look to gain insight into the\nlocalization properties of the spin in a Fermi gas with strong interactions. We\nobserve a delocalized--localized transition over a range of fillings of a\nquasirandom lattice. We find this transition to be of a different nature for\nlow and high fillings, due to the diluteness of the system for low fillings.\n", "  The progress in building large quantum states and networks requires\nsophisticated detection techniques to verify the desired operation. To achieve\nthis aim, a cost- and resource-efficient detection method is the time\nmultiplexing of photonic states. This design is assumed to be efficiently\nscalable; however, it is restricted by inevitable losses and limited detection\nefficiencies. Here, we investigate the scalability of time-multiplexed\ndetectors under the effects of fiber dispersion and losses. We use the\ndistinguishability of Fock states up to $n=20$ after passing the\ntime-multiplexed detector as our figure of merit and find that, for realistic\nsetup efficiencies of $\\eta=0.85$, the optimal size for time-multiplexed\ndetectors is 256 bins.\n", "  In this experimental study, we investigate the interaction of\ngravity-capillary solitary waves generated by two surface pressure sources\nmoving side by side at constant speed. The nonlinear response of a water\nsurface to a single source moving at a speed just below the minimum phase speed\nof linear gravity-capillary waves in deep water ($c_{min}\\approx23$ cm\ns$^{-1}$) consists of periodic generation of pairs of three-dimensional\nsolitary waves (or lumps) in a V-shaped pattern downstream of the source. In\nthe reference frame of the laboratory, these unsteady lumps propagate in a\ndirection oblique to the motion of the source. In the present experiments, the\nstrengths of the two sources are adjusted to produce nearly identical responses\nand the free-surface deformations are visualized using photography-based\ntechniques. The first lumps generated by the two sources move in intersecting\ndirections that make a half angle of approximately 15 degrees and collide in\nthe centerplane between the sources. A steep depression is formed during the\ncollision, but this depression quickly decreases in amplitude while radiating\nsmall-amplitude radial waves. After the collision, a quasi-stable pattern is\nformed with several rows of localized depressions that are qualitatively\nsimilar to lumps but exhibit periodic amplitude oscillations, similar to a\nbreather. The shape of the wave pattern and the period of oscillations depend\nstrongly on the distance between the sources.\n", "  The repetition rate of a Kerr comb comprising a single soliton in an\nanomalous dispersion silicon nitride microcavity is measured as a function of\npump frequency tuning. The contributions from the Raman soliton self-frequency\nshift (SSFS) and from thermal effects are evaluated both experimentally and\ntheoretically; the SSFS is found to dominate the changes in repetition rate.\nThe relationship between the changes in repetition rate and pump frequency\ndetuning is found to be independent of the nonlinearity coefficient and\ndispersion of the cavity. Modeling of the repetition rate change by using the\ngeneralized Lugiato-Lefever equation is discussed; the Kerr shock is found to\nhave only a minor effect on repetition rate for cavity solitons with duration\ndown to ~50 fs.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations, we study the transient response of a\nbinary Lennard-Jones glass subjected to periodic shear deformation. The\namorphous solid is modelled as the three-dimensional Kob-Andersen binary\nmixture at a low temperature. The cyclic loading is applied to slowly annealed,\nquiescent samples, which induces irreversible particle rearrangements at large\nstrain amplitudes, leading to stress-strain hysteresis and a drift of the\npotential energy towards higher values. We find that the initial response to\ncyclic shear near the critical strain amplitude involves disconnected clusters\nof atoms with large nonaffine displacements. In contrast, the amplitude of\nshear stress oscillations decreases after a certain number of cycles, which is\naccompanied by the initiation and subsequent growth of a shear band.\n", "  Despite the emerging morphological evidence that luminous quasar-like AGN are\ntriggered in galaxy mergers, the natures of the triggering mergers and the\norder of events in the triggering sequence remain uncertain. In this work, we\npresent a detailed study of the stellar populations of the host galaxies of 21\ntype II quasars, with the aim of understanding the sequence of events between\nthe onset of the merger, the triggering of the associated starburst and the\ninitiation of the quasar activity. To this end, we model high quality, wide\nspectral coverage, intermediate resolution optical spectra of the type II\nquasars. We find that of the 21 objects, the higher-order Balmer absorption\nlines, characteristic of young stellar populations (YSP) , are directly\ndetected in ~62% of the sample. We also fit these spectra using a number of\ncombinations of stellar and/or power-law components, representative of viable\nformation histories, as well as including the possibility of scattered AGN\nlight. We find that 90 % of the type II quasar host galaxies require the\ninclusion of a YSP to adequately model their spectra, whilst 71 % of the sample\nrequire the inclusion of a YSP with age < 100 Myr. Since the ages of the YSP in\nmost type II quasar host galaxies are comparable with the expected lifetimes of\nthe AGN activity, these results provide strong evidence that the quasars are\ntriggered close to the peaks of the merger-induced starbursts.\n", "  Precise data on e^+e^- to hadrons have recently become available and are used\nto compute the lowest-order hadronic vacuum polarisation contribution to the\nmuon magnetic anomaly through dispersion relations. This is the case for the\ndominant pi+ pi- channel, but the most significant progress comes from the near\ncompletion of the BABAR program of measuring exclusive processes below 2 GeV\nwith the initial-state radiation method which allows an efficient coverage of a\nlarge range of energies.. In this paper we briefly review the data treatment,\nthe achieved improvements, and the result obtained for the full Standard Model\nprediction of the muon magnetic anomaly. The value obtained, a_mu\n(had~LO)=(692.6 +- 3.3)x 10^{-10} is 20% more precise than our last estimate in\n2010. It deviates from the direct experimental determination by (27.4 +- 7.6)x\n10^{-10} (3.6 sigma). Perpectives for further improvement are discussed.\n", "  Compressibility of boron subphosphide B12P2 has been studied under\nquasi-hydrostatic conditions up to 26 GPa and 2600 K using laser-heated diamond\nanvil cell and angle-dispersive synchrotron X-ray diffraction. 300-K data fit\nyields the values of bulk modulus B0 = 192(11) GPa and its first pressure\nderivative B0' = 5.5(12). At ambient pressure the thermal expansion is\nquasi-linear up to 1300 K with average volume expansion coefficient {\\alpha} =\n17.4(1) 10-6 K-1. The whole set of experimental p-V-T data is well described by\nthe Anderson-Gr\\\"uneisen model with {\\delta}T = 6.\n", "  We show that Minkowski higher-derivative quantum field theories are\ngenerically inconsistent, because they generate nonlocal, non-Hermitian\nultraviolet divergences, which cannot be removed by means of standard\nrenormalization procedures. By \"Minkowski theories\" we mean theories that are\ndefined directly in Minkowski spacetime. The problems occur when the\npropagators have complex poles, so that the correlation functions cannot be\nobtained as the analytic continuations of their Euclidean versions. The usual\npower counting rules fail and are replaced by much weaker ones. Self-energies\ngenerate complex divergences proportional to inverse powers of D'Alembertians.\nThree-point functions give more involved nonlocal divergences, which couple to\ninfrared effects. We illustrate the violations of the locality and Hermiticity\nof counterterms in scalar models and higher-derivative gravity.\n", "  The effect of thickness on the width of the percolation threshold in\nmetal-dielectric composite films was examined. The distribution of current\nintensities through cubic networks of metal and dielectric components was\ndetermined using Kirchhoff's equations. From the tail of current distribution,\nthe width of the percolation threshold was defined using L\\'evy statistics, and\ndetermined as a function of the film thickness for a system size 100. In the\n2D-3D crossover region, the percolation width decreases as a power-law with a\npower exponent of $ 0.36\\pm 0.01$.\n", "  Thermodynamic quantities of the hard-sphere system in the steady state with a\nsmall heat flux are calculated within the continuous media approach. Analytical\nexpressions for pressure, internal energy, and entropy are found in the\napproximation of the fourth order in temperature gradients. It is shown that\nthe gradient contributions to the internal energy depend on the volume, while\nthe entropy satisfies the second law of thermodynamics for nonequilibrium\nprocesses. The calculations are performed for dimensions 3D, 2D, and 1D.\n", "  Through first-principles calculation based on the density functional theory\n(DFT) within the pseudo potential-plane wave (PP-PW) approach, we studied the\nstructural, mechanical and thermal properties of Cu$_2$CdSnSe$_4$ and\nCu$_2$HgSnSe$_4$ adamantine materials. The calculated lattice parameters are in\ngood agreement with experimental and theoretical reported data. The elastic\nconstants are calculated for both compounds using the static finite strain\nscheme. The hydrostatic pressure action on the elastic constants predicts that\nboth materials are mechanically stable up to 10 GPa. The polycrystalline\nmechanical parameters, i.e., the anisotropy factor ($A$), bulk modulus ($B$),\nshear modulus ($G$), Young's modulus ($E$), Lame's coefficient ($\\lambda$) and\nPoisson's ratio ($\\nu$) have been estimated from the calculated single crystal\nelastic constants. The analysis of $B/G$ ratio shows that the two studied\ncompounds behave as ductile. Based on the calculated mechanical parameters, the\nDebye temperature and the thermal conductivity have been probed. In the\nframework of the quasi-harmonic approximation, the temperature dependence of\nthe lattice heat capacity of both crystals has been investigated.\n", "  We present a detailed numerical study on structure and local magnetic\nproperties of $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ symmetric tilt grain boundaries in\nbcc-iron. Particular attention is paid to connection between type of grain\nboundary relaxation and local magnetic properties. Results from first\nprinciples calculation showed that grain boundary reconstruction leads to\nnon-uniform distribution of local magnetic moments in grain boundary plane.\nThis is in contrast with the result obtained in grain boundary plane, where\nsimple relaxation is observed. Well optimized atomic configurations in the\nvicinity of the interface were achieved by simulated annealing optimization\ntechnique improved by combination with genetic algorithm.\n", "  Using the Feynman-Pines diagram technique, the energy spectrum of localized\nquasi-particles interacting with polarization phonons is calculated and\nanalyzed in the wide range of energies at the finite temperature of the system.\nIt is established that the general model of the system, besides the bound\nstates known from the simplified model with an additional condition for the\noperator of quasi-particles number, contains the new bound states even for the\nsystems with weak coupling. The contribution of multi-phonon processes into the\nformation of renormalized spectrum of the system is analyzed. The reasons of\nthe appearance, behaviour and disappearance of separate pairs of bound states\ndepending on the coupling constant and temperature are revealed.\n", "  Nature of extrinsic and intrinsic self-trapping (ST) of charge carriers in\ncuprates have been studied theoretically. The binding energies and radii of the\nextrinsic and intrinsic large polarons and bipolarons in cuprates are\ncalculated variationally using the continuum model and adiabatic approximation.\nWe have shown that the extrinsic and intrinsic three-dimensional (3D) large\nbipolarons exist in underdoped cuprates at\n$\\eta=\\varepsilon_{\\infty}/\\varepsilon_0<0.127$ and $\\eta<0.138$, respectively\n[where $\\varepsilon_{\\infty}$ ($\\varepsilon_0$) is the optic (static)\ndielectric constant].\n", "  The electronic energy band spectra, as well as partial and total density of\nelectronic states of the crystal argyrodite Ag$_{8}$SnSe$_{6}$ have been\nevaluated within the projector augmented waves (PAW) approach by means of the\nABINIT code. The one-electron energies have been evaluated using two\nfunctionals for exchange-correlation energy. The first one is the generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA) approach. The second one is the hybrid functional\nPBE0 composed of the semilocal GGA part and Hartree-Fock exact exchange\nnon-local energy for strongly correlated $4d$ electrons of Ag atom. The second\napproach eliminates the Coulomb self-interaction of the Ag $4d$ electrons. This\nleads to a significant restructuring of the energy bands in the filled valence\npart and to an improved location of the Ag $4d$-states on the energy scale, and\nthe resulting value of the band gap is well compared with experiment. The\neffects of strong correlation on the electronic structure of the crystal\nargyrodite are considered here for the first time.\n", "  Dynamic conductivity of the one-dimensional ion conductor is investigated at\ndifferent values of the interaction constant between particles and the\nmodulating field. The consideration is based on the hard-core boson lattice\nmodel. Calculations are performed for finite one-dimensional cluster using the\nexact diagonalization method. Frequency dependence of the dynamic conductivity\nand behaviour of its static component (Drude weight) in the charge-density-wave\n(CDW) and superfluid (SF) phases are studied. Frequency dispersion of impedance\nand loss tangent is calculated; the Nyquist diagrams are built and analyzed.\n", "  A chain of kinetic equations for non-equilibrium one-particle, two-particle\nand $ s $-particle distribution functions of particles which take into account\nnonlinear hydrodynamic fluctuations is proposed. The method of Zubarev\nnon-equilibrium statistical operator with projection is used. Nonlinear\nhydrodynamic fluctuations are described with non-equilibrium distribution\nfunction of collective variables that satisfies generalized Fokker-Planck\nequation. On the basis of the method of collective variables, a scheme of\ncalculation of non-equilibrium structural distribution function of collective\nvariables and their hydrodynamic speeds (above Gaussian approximation)\ncontained in the generalized Fokker-Planck equation for the non-equilibrium\ndistribution function of collective variables is proposed. Contributions of\nshort- and long-range interactions between particles are separated, so that the\nshort-range interactions (for example, the model of hard spheres) are described\nin the coordinate space, while the long-range interactions --- in the space of\ncollective variables. Short-ranged component is regarded as basic, and\ncorresponds to the BBGKY chain of equations for the model of hard spheres.\n", "  The deuterium enrichment of molecules is sensitive to their formation\nenvironment. Constraining patterns of deuterium chemistry in protoplanetary\ndisks is therefore useful for probing how material is inherited or reprocessed\nthroughout the stages of star and planet formation. We present ALMA\nobservations at $\\sim0.6\"$ resolution of DCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, DCN, and\nH$^{13}$CN in the full disks around T Tauri stars AS 209 and IM Lup, the\ntransition disks around T Tauri stars V4046 Sgr and LkCa 15, and the full disks\naround Herbig Ae stars MWC 480 and HD 163296. We also present ALMA observations\nof HCN in the IM Lup disk. DCN, DCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ are detected in all\ndisks, and H$^{13}$CN in all but the IM Lup disk. We find efficient deuterium\nfractionation for the sample, with estimates of disk-averaged DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$\nand DCN/HCN abundance ratios ranging from $\\sim0.02-0.06$ and $\\sim0.005-0.08$,\nrespectively, which is comparable to values reported for other ISM\nenvironments. The relative distributions of DCN and DCO$^+$ vary between disks,\nsuggesting that multiple formation pathways may be needed to explain the\ndiverse emission morphologies. In addition, gaps and rings observed in both\nH$^{13}$CO$^+$ and DCO$^+$ emission provide new evidence that DCO$^+$ bears a\ncomplex relationship with the location of the midplane CO snowline.\n", "  We introduce an entanglement-related quantity that we call the binegativity.\nBased on numerical evidence, we conjecture that the binegativity is an\nentanglement measure for two-qubit states. The binegativity is compared to the\nconcurrence and negativity, the only known entanglement measures that can be\ncomputed analytically for all two-qubit states. The ordering of entangled\ntwo-qubit mixed states induced by the binegativity is distinct from the\nordering determined by previously known measures, yielding possible new\ninsights into the structure of entangled two-qubit mixed states.\n", "  We present a global spectrophotometric characterization of the Ceres surface\nusing Dawn Framing Camera (FC) images. We identify the photometric model that\nyields the best results for photometrically correcting images. Corrected FC\nimages acquired on approach to Ceres were assembled into global maps of albedo\nand color. Generally, albedo and color variations on Ceres are muted. The\nalbedo map is dominated by a large, circular feature in Vendimia Planitia,\nknown from HST images (Li et al., 2006), and dotted by smaller bright features\nmostly associated with fresh-looking craters. The dominant color variation over\nthe surface is represented by the presence of \"blue\" material in and around\nsuch craters, which has a negative spectral slope over the visible wavelength\nrange when compared to average terrain. We also mapped variations of the phase\ncurve by employing an exponential photometric model, a technique previously\napplied to asteroid Vesta (Schr\\\"oder et al., 2013b). The surface of Ceres\nscatters light differently from Vesta in the sense that the ejecta of several\nfresh-looking craters may be physically smooth rather than rough. High albedo,\nblue color, and physical smoothness all appear to be indicators of youth. The\nblue color may result from the desiccation of ejected material that is similar\nto the phyllosilicates/water ice mixtures in the experiments of Poch et al.\n(2016). The physical smoothness of some blue terrains would be consistent with\nan initially liquid condition, perhaps as a consequence of impact melting of\nsubsurface water ice. We find red terrain (positive spectral slope) near\nErnutet crater, where De Sanctis et al. (2017) detected organic material. The\nspectrophotometric properties of the large Vendimia Planitia feature suggest it\nis a palimpsest, consistent with the Marchi et al. (2016) impact basin\nhypothesis. The central bright area in Occator crater, Cerealia...\n", "  The sum of squared epicyclic frequencies of nearly circular motion\n($\\omega_r^2+\\omega_\\theta^2$) in axially symmetric configurations of Newtonian\ngravity is known to depend both on the matter density and on the angular\nvelocity profile of circular orbits. It was recently found that this sum goes\nto zero at the photon orbits of Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes. However,\nthese are the only relativistic configurations for which such result exists in\nthe literature. Here, we extend the above formalism in order to describe the\nanalogous relation for geodesic motion in arbitrary static, axially symmetric,\nasymptotically flat solutions of general relativity. The sum of squared\nepicyclic frequencies is found to vanish at photon radii of vacuum solutions.\nIn the presence of matter, we obtain that $\\omega_r^2+\\omega_\\theta^2>0$ for\nperturbed timelike circular geodesics on the equatorial plane if the strong\nenergy condition holds for the matter-energy fluid of spacetime; in vacuum, the\nallowed region for timelike circular geodesic motion is characterized by the\ninequality above. The results presented here may be of use to shed light on\ngeneral issues concerning the stability of circular orbits once they approach\nphoton radii, mainly the ones corresponding to stable photon motion.\n", "  We study the coherent dynamics of two interacting particles in a quantum\ndouble-well and show that the Shannon entropy can be a definitive signature of\nentanglement as an alternative to concur- rence, a connection not reported\npreviously. This physical model, involving tunneling and contact interaction,\nis akin to the Hubbard model which explains the physics of interacting\nparticles in peri- odic potentials. We show that an interplay between tunneling\nand contact interaction produces Bell like eigenstates ensuring thereby that\nthe concurrence and the Shannon entropy, two quantities with vastly different\nphysical interpretations, develop the same time dependence. Our result, applied\nto three experimentally realized physical models works for both spatial and\nspin degrees of freedom and is significant as it provides a novel measure of\nentanglement applicable to many systems currently being explored for scalable\nquantum computation.\n", "  A novel Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) system is proposed\nusing intensity-modulated optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\nprobe signal and direct detection (IM-DD-OOFDM) without frequency sweep\noperation. The influence of peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of OFDM probe\nsignal on the recovery of Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) is analyzed in theory\nand experiment. The complex BGS is reconstructed by channel estimation\nalgorithm and Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) is located by curve fitting of\nintensity spectrum. The IM-DD-OOFDM BOTDA is demonstrated experimentally with\n25m spatial resolution over 2 km standard single mode fiber.\n", "  In this paper we address Lifshitz transition induced by applied external\nmagnetic field in a case of iron-based superconductors, in which a difference\nbetween the Fermi level and the edges of the bands is relatively small. We\nintroduce and investigate a two-band model with intra-band pairing in the\nrelevant parameters regime to address a generic behaviour of a system with\nhole-like and electron-like bands in external magnetic field. Our results show\nthat two Lifshitz transitions can develop in analysed systems and the first one\noccurs in the superconducting phase and takes place at approximately constant\nmagnetic field. The chosen sets of the model parameters can describe\ncharacteristic band structure of iron-based superconductors and thus the\nobtained results can explain the experimental observations in FeSe and Co-doped\nBaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ compounds.\n", "  Subject of research is complex networks and network systems. The network\nsystem is defined as a complex network in which flows are moved. Classification\nof flows in the network is carried out on the basis of ordering and continuity.\nIt is shown that complex networks with different types of flows generate\nvarious network systems. Flow analogues of the basic concepts of the theory of\ncomplex networks are introduced and the main problems of this theory in terms\nof flow characteristics are formulated. Local and global flow characteristics\nof networks bring closer the theory of complex networks to the systems theory\nand systems analysis. Concept of flow core of network system is introduced and\ndefined how it simplifies the process of its investigation. Concepts of kernel\nand flow core of multiplex are determined. Features of operation of multiplex\ntype systems are analyzed.\n", "  Electron-phonon interaction in superconducting transition metals (Ta, Mo, W)\nis investigated by the method of point-contact spectroscopy. The spectra\nobtained are compared with model densities of the phonon states $F(\\omega)$\ncomputed from experiments on neutron scattering, and with the tunnel\nelectron-phonon interaction function $g(\\omega)$ for Ta. Close agreement\nbetween the appropriate spectra is obtained for Ta and Mo, while a significant\ndiscrepancy is observed for W, which is the appearance of a blurred maximum\ninstead of the two expected separated peaks on the point-contact spectra. The\nabsolute intensities of a number of point-contact spectra $G(eV)$ and\nelectron-phonon coupling constants $\\lambda$ are calculated. For all three\nmetals the values obtained turned out to be considerably below those expected.\nThe possible reasons for this disagreement are discussed.\n", "  The nearby M dwarf binary GJ65AB, also known as BL Cet and UV Cet, is a\nunique benchmark for investigation of dynamo-driven activity of low-mass stars.\nMagnetic activity of GJ65 was repeatedly assessed by indirect means, such as\nstudies of flares, photometric variability, X-ray and radio emission. Here we\npresent a direct analysis of large-scale and local surface magnetic fields in\nboth components. Interpreting high-resolution circular polarisation spectra\n(sensitive to a large-scale field geometry) we uncovered a remarkable\ndifference of the global stellar field topologies. Despite nearly identical\nmasses and rotation rates, the secondary exhibits an axisymmetric, dipolar-like\nglobal field with an average strength of 1.3 kG while the primary has a much\nweaker, more complex and non-axisymmetric 0.3 kG field. On the other hand, an\nanalysis of the differential Zeeman intensification (sensitive to the total\nmagnetic flux) shows the two stars having similar magnetic fluxes of 5.2 and\n6.7 kG for GJ65A and B, respectively, although there is an evidence that the\nfield strength distribution in GJ65B is shifted towards a higher field strength\ncompared to GJ65A. Based on these complementary magnetic field diagnostic\nresults we suggest that the dissimilar radio and X-ray variability of GJ65A and\nB is linked to their different global magnetic field topologies. However, this\ndifference appears to be restricted to the upper atmospheric layers but does\nnot encompass the bulk of the stars and has no influence on the fundamental\nstellar properties.\n", "  We present mid-infrared (MIR, 7.5-13.5 $\\mu$m) imaging and spectroscopy\nobservations obtained with the CanariCam (CC) instrument on the 10.4m Gran\nTelescopio CANARIAS for a sample of 20 nearby, MIR bright and X-ray luminous\nQSOs. We find that for the majority of QSOs the MIR emission is unresolved at\nangular scales nearly 0.3 arcsec, corresponding to physical scales $<600$ pc.\nWe find that the higher-spatial resolution CC spectra have similar shapes to\nthose obtained with Spitzer/IRS, and hence we can assume that the spectra are\nnot heavily contaminated by extended emission in the host galaxy. We thus take\nadvantage of the higher signal to noise Spitzer/IRS spectra, as a fair\nrepresentation of the nuclear emission, to decompose it into a combination of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and stellar\ncomponents. In most cases the AGN is the dominant component, with a median\ncontribution of 85 per cent of the continuum light at MIR (5-15 $\\mu$m) within\nthe IRS slit. This IR AGN emission is well reproduced by clumpy torus models.\nWe find evidence for significant differences in the parameters that describe\nthe dusty tori of QSOs when compared with the same parameters of Seyfert 1 and\n2 nuclei. In particular, we find a lower number of clouds ($N_{0}<12$), steeper\nradial distribution of clouds ($q=1.5-3.0$), and clouds that are less optically\nthick ($\\tau_{V}<100$) than in Seyfert 1, which could be attributed to dusty\nstructures that have been partially evaporated and piled up by the higher\nradiation field in QSOs. We find that the combination of the angular width\n$\\sigma_{torus}$, viewing angle $i$, and number of clouds along the equatorial\nline $N_{0}$, produces large escape probabilities ($P_{esc} > 2$ per cent) and\nlow geometrical covering factors ($f_{2}<0.6$), as expected for AGN with broad\nlines in their optical spectra.\n", "  Gravitational wave observations need accompanying electromagnetic signals to\naccurately determine the sky positions of the sources. The ejecta of neutron\nstar mergers are expected to produce such electromagnetic transients, called\nmacronovae. Characteristics of the ejecta include large velocity gradients and\nthe presence of heavy $r$-process elements, which pose significant challenges\nto the accurate calculation of radiative opacities and radiation transport. For\nexample, these opacities include a dense forest of bound-bound features arising\nfrom near-neutral lanthanide and actinide elements. Here we investigate the use\nof fine-structure, line-smeared opacities that preserve the integral of the\nopacity over frequency, which is an alternative approach to the\nexpansion-opacity formalism. The use of area-preserving line profiles produces\nfrequency-dependent opacities that are one to two orders of magnitude greater\nthan those obtained with the use of expansion opacities in the Sobolev\napproximation. Opacities are calculated for four $r$-process elements (cerium,\nneodymium, samarium and uranium) using fully and semi-relativistic methods, as\nwell as different amounts of configuration interaction in the atomic structure,\nin order to test the sensitivity of the emission to the underlying atomic\nphysics. We determine the effect of these new opacities on simulated spectra\nand broad-band light curves by applying a multi-dimensional ray-trace method to\nthe ejecta predicted from 3-dimensional merger calculations. With our\nsubstantially larger opacities the simulations yield slightly lower\nluminosities that peak in the mid-IR. These results suggest that those\nradioactively powered transients that are related to the very heaviest\n$r$-process material are more difficult to observe than previously believed.\n", "  Hazes are common in known planet atmospheres, and geochemical evidence\nsuggests early Earth occasionally supported an organic haze with significant\nenvironmental and spectral consequences. The UV spectrum of the parent star\ndrives organic haze formation through methane photochemistry. We use a 1D\nphotochemical-climate model to examine production of fractal organic haze on\nArchean Earth-analogs in the habitable zonesof several stellar types: the\nmodern and early Sun, AD Leo (M3.5V), GJ 876 (M4V), $\\epsilon$ Eridani (K2V),\nand $\\sigma$ Bo\\\"otis (F2V). For Archean-like atmospheres, planets orbiting\nstars with the highest UV fluxes do not form haze due to the formation of\nphotochemical oxygen radicals that destroy haze precursors. Organic hazes\nimpact planetary habitability via UV shielding and surface cooling, but this\ncooling is minimized around M dwarfs whose energy is emitted at wavelengths\nwhere organic hazes are relatively transparent. We generate spectra to test the\ndetectability of haze. For 10 transits of a planet orbiting GJ 876 observed by\nthe James Webb Space Telescope, haze makes gaseous absorption features at\nwavelengths $<$ 2.5 $\\mu$m 2-10$\\sigma$ shallower compared to a haze-free\nplanet, and methane and carbon dioxide are detectable at $>$5$\\sigma$. A haze\nabsorption feature can be detected at 5$\\sigma$ near 6.3 $\\mu$m, but higher\nsignal-to-noise is needed to distinguish haze from adjacent absorbers. For\ndirect imaging of a planet at 10 parsecs using a coronagraphic 10-meter class\nultraviolet-visible-near infrared telescope, a UV-blue haze absorption feature\nwould be strongly detectable at $>$12$\\sigma$ in 200 hours.\n", "  Physical implementations of large-scale quantum processors based on\nsolid-state platforms benefit from realizations of quantum bits positioned in\nregular arrays. Self-assembled quantum dots are well-established as promising\ncandidates for quantum optics and quantum information processing, but they are\nrandomly positioned. Site-controlled quantum dots, on the other hand, are grown\nin pre-defined locations, but have not yet been sufficiently developed to be\nused as a platform for quantum information processing. In this letter we\ndemonstrate all-optical ultrafast complete coherent control of a qubit formed\nby the single-spin/trion states of a charged site-controlled nanowire quantum\ndot. Our results show that site-controlled quantum dots in nanowires are\npromising hosts of charged-exciton qubits, and that these qubits can be cleanly\nmanipulated in the same fashion as has been demonstrated in randomly-positioned\nquantum dot samples. Our findings suggest that many of the related excitonic\nqubit experiments that have been performed over the past 15 years may work well\nin the more scalable site-controlled systems, making them very promising for\nthe realization of quantum hardware.\n", "  TVID is a program for the numerical evaluation of general three-loop vacuum\nintegrals with arbitrary masses. It consists of two parts. An algebraic module,\nimplemented in Mathematica, performs the separation of the divergent pieces of\nthe master integrals and identifies special cases. The numerical module,\nimplemented in C, carries out the numerical integration of the finite pieces.\nIn this note, the structure of the program is explained and a few usage\nexamples are given.\n", "  The justification of the absolutely continuous spectrum eigenfunctions\nasymptotics in the problem of three one-Dimensional short-range quantum\nparticles with repulsion has been done.\n", "  Observational and theoretical arguments support the idea that violent events\nconnected with $AGN$ activity and/or intense star forming episodes have played\na significant role in the early phases of galaxy formation at high red shifts.\nBeing old stellar systems, globular clusters seem adequate candidates to search\nfor the eventual signatures that might have been left by those energetic\nphenomena. The analysis of the colour distributions of several thousands of\nglobular clusters in the Virgo and Fornax galaxy clusters reveals the existence\nof some interesting and previously undetected features. A simple pattern\nrecognition technique, indicates the presence of \"colour modulations\",\ndistinctive for each galaxy cluster. The results suggest that the globular\ncluster formation process has not been completely stochastic but, rather,\nincluded a significant fraction of globulars that formed in a synchronized way\nand over supra-galactic spatial scales.\n", "  The hydration of ions in nanoscale hydrated clusters is ubiquitous and\nessential in many physical and chemical processes. Here we show that the\nhydrolysis reaction is strongly affected by relative humidity. The hydrolysis\nof CO32- with n = 1-8 water molecules is investigated by ab initio method. For\nn = 1-5 water molecules, all the reactants follow a stepwise pathway to the\ntransition state. For n = 6-8 water molecules, all the reactants undergo a\ndirect proton transfer to the transition state with overall lower activation\nfree energy. The activation free energy of the reaction is dramatically reduced\nfrom 10.4 to 2.4 kcal/mol as the number of water molecules increases from 1 to\n6. Meanwhile, the degree of the hydrolysis of CO32- is significantly increased\ncompared to the bulk water solution scenario. The incomplete hydration shells\nfacilitate the hydrolysis of CO32- with few water molecules (especially for n =\n6) to be not only thermodynamically favorable but also kinetically favorable.\nThis discovery provides valuable insights for designing efficient sorbents\nincluding that for CO2 air capture.\n", "  The growth, atomic structure, and electronic property of trilayer graphene\n(TLG) on Ru(0001) were studied by low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy\nand spectroscopy in combined with tight-binding approximation (TBA)\ncalculations. TLG on Ru(0001) shows a flat surface with a hexagonal lattice due\nto the screening effect of the bottom two layers and the AB-stacking in the top\ntwo layers. The coexistence of AA- and AB-stacking in the bottom two layers\nleads to three different stacking orders of TLG, namely, ABA-, ABC-, and\nABB-stacking. STS measurements combined with TBA calculations reveal that the\ndensity of states of TLG with ABC- and ABB-stacking is characterized by one and\ntwo sharp peaks near to the Fermi level, respectively, in contrast to the\nV-shaped feature of TLG with ABA-stacking. Our work demonstrates that TLG on\nRu(0001) might be an ideal platform for exploring stacking-dependent electronic\nproperties of graphene.\n", "  We present the new developments in the physics of XYZ mesons and glueballs\nand discuss the connection between properties of the $XYZ$ mesons and\nglueballs, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. It is shown that the mixing\nbetween quark and gluon degree of freedoms induced by the nontrivial\ntopological structure of the QCD vacuum might affect strongly the properties of\nthe exotic hadrons. A new interpretation of the $XYZ$ mesons as the mixing\nbetween radial excitations of light quark-antiquark systems and states with\nheavy quark content is suggested. We introduce also a new mechanism of\nquarkonia production in hadron-hadron collisions coming from the mixing of\nlight and heavy quark sectors of QCD. This mechanism is based on the nontrivial\ntopological structure of the QCD vacuum and might explain the polarization\npuzzle in inclusive $J/\\Psi$ production in high energy reactions. The\npossibility of big changes of the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses in\nthe hot gluonic plasma is established and their consequences in the phase\nstructure of QCD analyzed.\n", "  In the present study we employed density functional theory calculations to\ninvestigate the mechanical behavior, bonding nature and defect processes of the\nnew ordered MAX phase Mo2ScAlC2. The mechanical stability of the compound is\nverified with its single crystal elastic constants. The new phase Mo2ScAlC2 is\nanticipated to be prone to shear along the crystallographic b and c axes, when\na rational force is applied to the crystallographic a axis. The compressibility\nalong the <001> direction under uniaxial stress is expected to be easier in\nMo2ScAlC2. Additionally, the volume deformation should be easier in Mo2ScAlC2\nthan in the isostructural Mo2TiAlC2. Mo2ScAlC2 is predicted to behave in a\nbrittle manner. Due to its higher Debye temperature, Mo2ScAlC2 is expected to\nbe thermally more conductive than Mo2TiAlC2. The cross-slip pinning procedure\nshould be significantly easier in Mo2ScAlC2 as compared to Mo2TiAlC2. The new\nordered MAX phase Mo2ScAlC2 has a mixed character of strong covalent and\nmetallic bonding with limited ionic nature. Both Mo-C and Mo-Al bonds are\nexpected to be more covalent in Mo2ScAlC2 than those of Mo2TiAlC2. the level of\ncovalency of Sc-C bond is somewhat low compared to a similar bond Ti-C in\nMo2TiAlC2. Due to its reduced hardness, Mo2ScAlC2 should be softer and more\neasily machinable compared to Mo2TiAlC2. Fermi surface topology of the new\ncompound is formed mainly due to the low-dispersive Mo 4d-like bands. The\nintrinsic defect processes reveal that the level of radiation tolerance in\nMo2ScAlC2 is not as high as in other MAX phases such as Ti3AlC2.\n", "  We tested a fifth force using cold atom experiments. The accelerated\nexpansion of the universe implies the possibility of the presence of a scalar\nfield throughout the universe driving the acceleration. This field would result\nin a detectable force between normal-matter objects. Theory of the chameleon\nfield states that the force should be strong in a thin shell near the surface\nof a source object but greatly suppressed inside and outside of the source\nobject. We used two atom clouds: one as the source and the other as the test\nmass; so the test mass can pass through the thin-shell region of the source\nmass. We detected the chameleon force and obtained the couple constant of about\n4.5E11 between matter and the field. The chameleon force is considerably larger\nthan Newtonian gravity at short distance; the interaction range is short enough\nto satisfy all experimental bounds on deviations from general relativity.\n", "  Due to their exceptional plasmonic properties, noble metals such as gold and\nsilver have been the materials of choice for the demonstration of various\nplasmonic and nanophotonic phenomena. However, noble metals' softness, lack of\ntailorability and low melting point along with challenges in thin film\nfabrication and device integration have prevented the realization of real-life\nplasmonic devices.In the recent years, titanium nitride (TiN) has emerged as a\npromising plasmonic material with good metallic and refractory (high\ntemperature stable) properties. The refractory nature of TiN could enable\npractical plasmonic devices operating at elevated temperatures for energy\nconversion and harsh-environment industries such as gas and oil. Here we report\non the temperature dependent dielectric functions of TiN thin films of varying\nthicknesses in the technologically relevant visible and near-infrared\nwavelength range from 330 nm to 2000 nm for temperatures up to 900 0C using\nin-situ high temperature ellipsometry. Our findings show that the complex\ndielectric function of TiN at elevated temperatures deviates from the optical\nparameters at room temperature, indicating degradation in plasmonic properties\nboth in the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant. However, quite\nstrikingly, the relative changes of the optical properties of TiN are\nsignificantly smaller compared to its noble metal counterparts. Using\nsimulations, we demonstrate that incorporating the temperature-induced\ndeviations into the numerical models leads to significant differences in the\noptical responses of high temperature nanophotonic systems. These studies hold\nthe key for accurate modeling of high temperature TiN based optical elements\nand nanophotonic systems for energy conversion, harsh-environment sensors and\nheat-assisted applications.\n", "  In a recent series of papers, we proposed a mathematical model for the\ndynamics of a group of interacting pedestrians. The model is based on a\nnon-Newtonian potential, that accounts for the need of pedestrians to keep both\ntheir interacting partner and their walking goal in their vision field, and to\nkeep a comfortable distance between them. These two behaviours account\nrespectively for the angular and radial part of the potential from which the\nforce providing the pedestrian acceleration is derived. The angular term is\nasymmetric, i.e. does not follow the third law of dynamics, with observable\neffects on group formation and velocity. We successfully compared the\npredictions of the model with observations of real world pedestrian behaviour.\nWe then studied the effect of crowd density on group dynamics. We verified that\nthe average effect of crowd density may be modelled by adding a harmonic term\nto the group potential. The model predictions, which include \"phase\ntransitions\" in the group configuration, are again confirmed, at least in the\nobserved density range, by a comparison with real world data. Until now we had\naveraged all pedestrian data collected in a given environmental setting without\ndifferentiating on group composition and social roles. In this work we study\nhow the group configuration and velocity is affected by inter-pedestrian\nrelation (family, couples, colleagues, friends), purpose (work, leisure) and\ngender. We also show results related to the effect of asymmetric interactions,\nthat confirm further the non-Newtonian nature of gaze-based angular interaction\nin our model.\n", "  The neutron lifetime is one of the basic parameters in the weak interaction,\nand is used for predicting the light element abundance in the early universe.\nOur group developed a new setup to measure the lifetime with the goal precision\nof 0.1% at the polarized beam branch BL05 of MLF, J-PARC. The commissioning\ndata was acquired in 2014 and 2015, and the first set of data to evaluate the\nlifetime in 2016, which is expected to yield a statistical uncertainty of\nO(1)%. This paper presents the current analysis results and the future plans to\nachieve our goal precision.\n", "  Vacancy mechanism plays a dominant role in the atomic migration when a\nclose-packed disordered alloy undergoes ordering transition. However, the\ncalculation of thermal vacancy formation energies (VFEs) of random solid\nsolutions is usually cumbersome due to the difficulty in considering various\nlocal atomic environments. Here, we propose a transparent way that combines\ncoherent potential approximation and supercell-local cluster expansion to\ninvestigate VFEs of random solid solutions. This method is used to study the\neffects of temperature, strain and magnetism on the VFEs of random A1-FePt\nalloy. The results show that the mean VFE increases with increasing\ntemperature, decreases under (001) in-plane tensile and compressive strains,\nand can be further reduced by the magnetic excitation. These effects are\nexplained by discussing the dependence of VFE on local atomic environments and\nthe overall bond strength within.\n", "  Many-body entanglement is often created through system evolution, aided by\nnon-linear interactions between the constituting particles. The very dynamics,\nhowever, can also lead to fluctuations and degradation of the entanglement if\nthe interactions cannot be controlled. Here, we demonstrate near-deterministic\ngeneration of an entangled twin-Fock condensate of $\\sim11000$ atoms by driving\na $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate undergoing spin mixing through two\nconsecutive quantum phase transitions (QPTs). We directly observe number\nsqueezing of $10.7\\pm0.6$ dB and normalized collective spin length of\n$0.99\\pm0.01$. Together, these observations allow us to infer an\nentanglement-enhanced phase sensitivity of $\\sim6$ dB beyond the standard\nquantum limit and an entanglement breadth of $\\sim910$ atoms. Our work\nhighlights the power of generating large-scale useful entanglement by taking\nadvantage of the different entanglement landscapes separated by QPTs.\n", "  In this study, we investigate pairwise non-classical correlations measured\nusing a one-way quantum deficit as well as quantum coherence in the $XY$\nspin-1/2 chain in a transverse magnetic field for both zero and finite\ntemperatures. The analytical and numerical results of our investigations are\npresented. In the case when the temperature is zero, it is shown that the\none-way quantum deficit can characterize quantum phase transitions as well as\nquantum coherence. We find that these measures have a clear critical point at\n$\\lambda=1$. When $\\lambda\\le1$, the one-way quantum deficit has an analytical\nexpression that coincides with the relative entropy of coherence. We also study\nan $XX$ model and an Ising chain at the finite temperatures.\n", "  The purpose of this note is to explain what is \"analytical history\", a\nmodular and testable analysis of historical events introduced in a book\npublished in 2002 (Roehner and Syme 2002). Broadly speaking, it is a\ncomparative methodology for the analysis of historical events. Comparison is\nthe keystone and hallmark of science. For instance, the extrasolar planets are\ncrucial for understanding our own solar system. Until their discovery,\nastronomers could observe only one instance. Single instances can be described\nbut they cannot be understood in a testable way. In other words, if one accepts\nthat, as many historians say, \"historical events are unique\", then no testable\nunderstanding can be developed.\n", "  Using x-ray magnetic circular and linear dichroism techniques, we demonstrate\na collinear exchange coupling between an epitaxial antiferromagnet, tetragonal\nCuMnAs, and an Fe surface layer. A small uncompensated Mn magnetic moment is\nobserved which is antiparallel to the Fe magnetization. The staggered\nmagnetization of the 5nm thick CuMnAs layer is rotatable under small magnetic\nfields, due to the interlayer exchange coupling. This allows us to obtain the\nx-ray magnetic linear dichroism spectra for different crystalline orientations\nof CuMnAs in the (001) plane.\n", "  Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) have emerged as one of the most promising\nfiller materials for improving the tribological performance of ceramic\ncomposites due to their outstanding solid lubricant properties as well as\nmechanical and thermal stability. Yet, the addition of GNPs has so far provided\nonly a very limited improvement in the tribological properties of ceramics,\nparticularly concerning the reduction of their friction coefficient. This is\nmost likely due to the challenges of achieving a lubricating and protecting\ntribo-film through a high GNP coverage of the exposed surfaces. Here we show\nthat this can be achieved by efficiently increasing the exfoliation degree of\nGNPs down to the few-layer (FL) range. By employing FL-GNPs as filler material,\nthe wear resistance of Si3N4 composites can be increased by about twenty times,\nthe friction coefficient reduced to nearly its half, while the other mechanical\nproperties are also preserved or improved. Using confocal Raman microscopy, we\nwere able to demonstrate the formation of a continuous FL- GNP tribo-film,\nalready at 5wt% FL-GNP content.\n", "  We consider the standard quantum logic ${\\mathcal L}(H)$ associated to a\ncomplex Hilbert space $H$, i.e. the lattice of closed subspaces of $H$ together\nwith the orthogonal complementation. The orthogonality and compatibility\nrelations are defined for any logic. In the standard quantum logic, they have a\nsimple interpretation in terms of operator theory. For example, two closed\nsubspaces (propositions in the logic ${\\mathcal L}(H)$) are compatible if and\nonly if the projections on these subspaces commute. We present both classical\nand more resent results on transformations of ${\\mathcal L}(H)$ and the\nassociated Grassmannians which preserve the orthogonality or compatibility\nrelation. The first result in this direction was classical Wigner's theorem.\n", "  Materials are central to our way of life and future. Energy and materials as\nresources are connected and the obvious connections between them are the energy\ncost of materials and the materials cost of energy. For both of these\nresilience of the materials is critical; thus a major goal of future chemistry\nshould be to find materials for energy that can last longer, i.e., design\nprinciples for self-repair in these.\n", "  A Moreton wave was detected in active region (AR) 12017 on 29 March 2014 with\nvery high cadence with the Halpha Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA) in\nassociation with an X1.0 flare (SOL2014-03-29T17:48). Several other phenomena\ntook place in connection with this event, such as low coronal waves and a\ncoronal mass ejection (CME). We analyze the association between the Moreton\nwave and the EUV signatures observed with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These include their low-coronal\nsurface-imprint, and the signatures of the full wave and shock dome propagating\noutward in the corona. We also study their relation to the white-light CME. We\nperform a kinematic analysis by tracking the wavefronts in several directions.\nThis analysis reveals a high-directional dependence of accelerations and speeds\ndetermined from data at various wavelengths. We speculate that a region of open\nmagnetic field lines northward of our defined radiant point sets favorable\nconditions for the propagation of a coronal magnetohydrodynamic shock in this\ndirection. The hypothesis that the Moreton wavefront is produced by a coronal\nshock-wave that pushes the chromosphere downward is supported by the high\ncompression ratio in that region. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geometrical\nmodel to explain the observed wavefronts as the chromospheric and low-coronal\ntraces of an expanding and outward-traveling bubble intersecting the Sun. The\nresults of the model are in agreement with the coronal shock-wave being\ngenerated by a 3D piston that expands at the speed of the associated rising\nfilament. The piston is attributed to the fast ejection of the filament-CME\nensemble, also consistent with the good match between the speed profiles of the\nlow-coronal and white-light shock-waves.\n", "  We recover in QCD an amazingly simple relationship between the anomalous\ndimensions, resummed through next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic order, in the\nDokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution equations for the first\nMellin moments $D_{q,g}(\\mu^2)$ of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions,\nwhich correspond to the average hadron multiplicities in jets initiated by\nquarks and gluons, respectively. This relationship, which is independent of the\nnumber of quark flavors, dramatically improves previous treatments by allowing\nfor an exact solution of the evolution equations. So far, such relationships\nhave only been known from supersymmetric QCD, where $C_F/C_A=1$. This also\nallows us to extend our knowledge of the ratio $D_g^-(\\mu^2)/D_q^-(\\mu^2)$ of\nthe minus components by one order in $\\sqrt{\\alpha_s}$. Exploiting available\nnext-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order information on the ratio\n$D_g^+(\\mu^2)/D_q^+(\\mu^2)$ of the dominant plus components, we fit the world\ndata of $D_{q,g}(\\mu^2)$ for charged hadrons measured in $e^+e^-$ annihilation\nto obtain $\\alpha_s^{(5)}(M_Z)=0.1205\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{+0.016}{-0.0020}$.\n", "  An extension to the standard electroweak model is presented that is different\nfrom previous models. This extension involves a three dimensional rotation of a\nplane defined by two charge-neutral current axes. In this model the plane also\ncontains the three algebraically coupled SU(2) groups quantization axes that\ncomprise the SU(3) group. This extension differentiates leptonic currents from\nbaryonic currents through hypercolor-charge channels and predicts additional\nsymmetries and currents due to different rotational orientations of the\ninteraction projecting onto the plane defining the SU(3) symmetry group and a\nU(1) symmetry axis.\n", "  We consider strongly spin-orbit coupled double perovskites A$_2$BB'O$_6$ with\nB' magnetic ions in either $d^1$ or $d^2$ electronic configuration and\nnon-magnetic B ions. We provide insights into several experimental puzzles,\nsuch as the predominance of ferromagnetism in $d^1$ versus antiferromagnetism\nin $d^2$ systems, the appearance of negative Curie-Weiss temperatures for\nferromagnetic materials, and the size of effective magnetic moments. We develop\nand solve a microscopic model with both spin and orbital degrees of freedom\nwithin the Mott insulating regime at finite temperature using mean field\ntheory. The interplay between anisotropic orbital degrees of freedom and\nspin-orbit coupling results in complex ground states in both $d^1$ and $d^2$\nsystems. We show that the ordering of orbital degrees of freedom in $d^1$\nsystems results in coplanar canted ferromagnetic and 4-sublattice\nantiferromagnetic structures. In $d^2$ systems we find additional colinear\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases not appearing in $d^1$ systems. At\nfinite temperatures, we find that orbital ordering driven by both superexchange\nand Coulomb interactions may occur at much higher temperatures compared to\nmagnetic order and leads to distinct deviations from Curie-Weiss law.\n", "  We recently introduced a quantized fluctuational electrodynamics (QFED)\nformalism that provides a physically insightful definition of an effective\nposition-dependent photon-number operator and the associated ladder operators.\nHowever, this far the formalism has been applicable only for the normal\nincidence of the electromagnetic field in planar structures. In this work, we\novercome the main limitation of the one-dimensional QFED formalism by extending\nthe model to three dimensions, allowing us to use the QFED method to study,\ne.g., plasmonic structures. To demonstrate the benefits of the developed\nformalism, we apply it to study the local steady-state photon numbers and field\ntemperatures in a light-emitting near-surface InGaN quantum-well structure with\na metallic coating supporting surface plasmons.\n", "  We propose a method for the detection of a dynamical Casimir effect. Assuming\nthat the Casimir photons are being generated in an electromagnetic cavity with\na vibrating wall (dynamical Casimir effect), we consider electrons passing\nthrough the cavity to be interacting with the intracavity field. We show that\nthe dynamical Casimir effect can be observed via the measurement of the change\nin the average or in the variance of the electron kinetic energy. We point out\nthat the enhancement of the effect due to finite temperatures makes it easier\nto detect the Casimir photons.\n", "  Monge gauge in differential geometry is generalized. The original Monge gauge\nis based on a surface defined as a height function $h(x,y)$ above a flat\nreference plane. The total curvature and the Gaussian curvature are found in\nterms of the height function. Getting benefits from our mathematical knowledge\nof general relativity, we shall extend the Monge gauge toward more complicated\nsurfaces. Here in this study we consider the height function above a curved\nsurface namely a sphere of radius $R$. The proposed height function is a\nfunction of $\\theta $ and $\\varphi $ on a closed interval. We find the first,\nsecond fundamental forms and the total and Gaussian curvatures in terms of the\nnew height function. Some specific limits are discussed and two illustrative\nexamples are given.\n", "  Social media are transforming global communication and coordination. The data\nderived from social media can reveal patterns of human behavior at all levels\nand scales of society. Using geolocated Twitter data, we have quantified\ncollective behaviors across multiple scales, ranging from the commutes of\nindividuals, to the daily pulse of 50 major urban areas and global patterns of\nhuman coordination. Human activity and mobility patterns manifest the synchrony\nrequired for contingency of actions between individuals. Urban areas show\nregular cycles of contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked\nprimarily to social rather than natural cycles. Business hours and circadian\nrhythms influence daily cycles of work, recreation, and sleep. Different urban\nareas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. The\ndifferences are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples\nbehavior in distant regions across the world. A globally synchronized peak that\nincludes exchange of ideas and information across Europe, Africa, Asia and\nAustralasia. We propose a dynamical model to explain the emergence of global\nsynchrony in the context of increasing global communication and reproduce the\nobserved behavior. The collective patterns we observe show how social\ninteractions lead to interdependence of behavior manifest in the\nsynchronization of communication. The creation and maintenance of temporally\nsensitive social relationships results in the emergence of complexity of the\nlarger scale behavior of the social system.\n", "  Bimorph films curl in response to temperature. The degree of curvature\ntypically varies linearly with temperature and in proportion to the difference\nin thermal expansion of the individual layers. In many applications, such as\ncontrolling a thermostat, this gentle linear behavior is acceptable. In other\ncases, such as opening or closing a valve or latching a deployable column into\nplace, an abrupt motion at a fixed temperature is preferred. To achieve this\nnon-linear motion, we describe the fabrication and performance of a new bilayer\nstructure we call 'Phase Change Composite Bimorph (PCBM)'. In a PCBM, one layer\nin the bimorph is a composite containing small inclusions of phase change\nmaterials. When the inclusions melt, their large (generally positive and >1%)\nexpansion coefficient induces a strong, reversible step function jump in\nbimorph curvature. The measured jump amplitude and thermal response is\nconsistent with theory.\n", "  We conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the delta phase of\nthe hydrous mineral AlOOH at ambient temperature and high pressure. Nuclear\nquantum effects were included through a Langevin dynamics in a bath of quantum\nharmonic oscillators.\n  We confirm that under increasing pressure delta-AlOOH undergoes a phase\ntransition from a $P2_1nm$ structure with asymmetric and disordered O-H bonds\nto a stiffer $Pnnm$ phase with symmetric hydrogen bonds, which should be stable\nwithin the pressure and temperature ranges typical for the Earth's mantle.\n  The transition is initially triggered by proton tunneling, which makes the\nmean proton position to coincide with the midpoint of the O-O distance, at\npressures as low as 10 GPa. However, only at much larger pressures, around 30\nGPa as previously found by other calculations, the Pnnm phase with symmetric\nhydrogen bonds is stable from the classical point of view.\n  The transition is also characterized through the analysis of the H-O\nstretching modes, which soften considerably and fade out around 10 GPa in the\nP2_1nm structure, when thermal and nuclear quantum effects are taken into\naccount in the simulations. At variance, the harmonic picture is not adequate\nto describe the highly anharmonic effective potential that is seen by the\nprotons at the transition.\n  Finally, we propose that the picture of a dynamical transition to the\nhigh-symmetry and proton-centered Pnnm phase, which is brought about by the\nonset of proton tunneling, could be confirmed by quasi-elastic neutron\nscattering and vibrational spectroscopy under pressure.\n", "  The development of a 3-dimensional simulation for Cherenkov photon emissions\nin Extensive Air Showers (EAS) is reported in this paper. CORSIKA is the most\nwidely used Monte-Carlo generator for the description of EAS, but it is not\nrecommended to calculate Cherenkov light emissions for EAS at ultra high\nenergies due to the enormous amount of data storage and running time required.\nThe presented BinTheSky is a framework to simulate the Cherenkov light\nemissions using the spatial information produced by Monte-Carlo generators. The\nlight is emitted in the shower, propagated and attenuated to the ground. The\nframework enables one to calculate the light spatial, timing and directional\ndistributions at the ground or at a given altitude, whereas the usual approach\nof Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray experiments relies on the simulation of the\nlongitudinal shower development and on parametrizations of the transverse\nshower distributions.\n", "  In this paper we describe how three qubit entanglement can be analyzed with\nlocal measurements. For this purpose we decompose entanglement witnesses into\noperators which can be measured locally. Our decompositions are optimized in\nthe number of measurement settings needed for the measurement of one witness.\nOur method allows to detect true threepartite entanglement and especially\nGHZ-states with only four measurement settings.\n"]}
