In other words we derive an equivalence of Hycomm-algebras and\nBV-algebras enhanced with a homotopy that trivializes the BV-operator.\n  These formulas are given in terms of the Givental graphs, and are proved in\ntwo different ways. One proof uses the Givental group action, and the other\nproof goes through a chain of explicit formulas on resolutions of Hycomm and\nBV. The second approach gives, in particular, a homological explanation of the\nGivental group action on Hycomm-algebras.\n", "  We demonstrate how the mixed dynamic form factor (MDFF) can be interpreted as\na quadratic form. This makes it possible to use matrix diagonalization methods\nto reduce the number of terms that need to be taken into account when\ncalculating the inelastic scattering of electrons in a crystal. It also leads\nin a natural way to a new basis that helps elucidate the underlying physics.\nThe new method is applied to several cases to show its versatility. In\nparticular, predictions are made for directly imaging atomic orbitals in\ncrystals.\n", "  We discuss the feasibility of detecting magnetic transitions with focused\nelectron vortex probes, suggested by selection rules for the magnetic quantum\nnumber. We theoretically estimate the dichroic signal strength in the L$_{2,3}$\nedge of the ferromagnetic d metals. It is shown that under realistic\nconditions, the dichroic signal is undetectable for nanoparticles larger than\n~1 nm. This is confirmed by a key experiment with nanometer sized vortices.\n", "  It was claimed (Lloyd et al., PRL 108 (2012) 074802) that energy loss\nmagnetic chiral dichroism (EMCD) with electron vortex beams is feasible, and\nhas even advantages over the standard setup with Bragg diffracted waves. In\nthis Comment, we show that Lloyd et al. ignored an important constraint on the\nproposed selection rule for the transfer of angular momentum in the\ninteraction, namely that it is only valid for an atom located in the very\ncenter of the vortex. As an experimental consequence, the EMCD signal will only\nbe strong for extremely small nanoparticles of 1 to 2 nm diameter.\n", "  The high-intensity version of multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) has\na potential for solving the phase problem in femtosecond crystallography with\nx-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). For MAD phasing, it is required to\ncalculate or measure the MAD coefficients involved in the key equation, which\ndepend on XFEL pulse parameters. In the present work, we revisit the\ngeneralized Karle-Hendrickson equation to clarify the importance of\nconfigurational fluctuations of heavy atoms induced by intense x-ray pulses,\nand investigate the high-intensity cases of transmission and fluorescence\nmeasurements of samples containing heavy atoms. Based on\ntransmission/fluorescence and diffraction experiments with crystalline samples\nof known structures, we propose an experimental procedure to determine all MAD\ncoefficients at high x-ray intensity, which can be used in \\emph{ab initio}\nphasing for unknown structures.\n", "  Parity violation in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation has been\nconfirmed by recent Planck observation. In this paper, we extend our previous\nwork [P. Naselsky et al. Astrophys. J. {\\bf 749}, 31 (2012)] on the directional\nproperties of CMB parity asymmetry by considering the Planck data of the CMB\ntemperature anisotropy. We define six kinds of the directional statistics and\nfind that they all indicate the odd-parity preference of CMB data. In addition,\nwe find the preferred axes of all these statistics strongly correlate with the\npreferred axes of the CMB kinematic dipole, quadrupole, and octopole. The\nalignment between them is confirmed at more than $3\\sigma$ confidence level,\nwhich implies that the CMB parity asymmetry, and the anomalies of the CMB\nquadrupole and octopole, may have the common physical, contaminated or\nsystematic origin. In addition, they all should be connected with the possible\ncontamination of the residual dipole component.\n", "  We consider the linear damped wave equation on finite metric graphs and\nanalyse its spectral properties with an emphasis on the asymptotic behaviour of\neigenvalues. In the case of equilateral graphs and standard coupling conditions\nwe show that there is only a finite number of high-frequency abscissas, whose\nlocation is solely determined by the averages of the damping terms on each\nedge. We further describe some of the possible behaviour when the edge lengths\nare no longer necessarily equal but remain commensurate.\n", "  We present a new scheme for performing optical spectroscopy on single\nmolecules. A glass capillary with a diameter of 600 nm filled with an organic\ncrystal tightly guides the excitation light and provides a maximum spontaneous\nemission coupling factor ($\\beta$) of 18% for the dye molecules doped in the\norganic crystal. Combination of extinction, fluorescence excitation and\nresonance fluorescence spectroscopy with microscopy provides high-resolution\nspatio-spectral access to a very large number of single molecules in a linear\ngeometry. We discuss strategies for exploring a range of quantum optical\nphenomena, including coherent cooperative interactions in a mesoscopic ensemble\nof molecules mediated by a single mode of propagating photons.\n", "  SN 2014J in M82 is the closest Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in decades. The\nproximity allows for detailed studies of supernova physics and provides\ninsights into the circumstellar and interstellar environment. In this work we\nanalyze Spitzer mid-IR data of SN 2014J in the 3.6 and 4.5 {\\mu}m wavelength\nrange, together with several other nearby and well-studied SNe Ia. We compile\nthe first composite mid-IR light-curve templates from our sample of SNe~Ia,\nspanning the range from before peak brightness well into the nebular phase. Our\nobservations indicate that SNe Ia form a very homogeneous class of objects at\nthese wavelengths. Using the low-reddening supernovae for comparison, we\nconstrain possible thermal emission from circumstellar dust around the highly\nreddened SN 2014J. We also study SNe 2006X and 2007le, where the presence of\nmatter in the circumstellar environment has been suggested. No significant\nmid-IR excess is detected, allowing us to place upper limits on the amount of\npre-existing dust in the circumstellar environment. For SN 2014J, $M_{dust} <\n10^{-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ within $r_{dust} \\sim 10^{17}$ cm, which is insufficient\nto account for the observed extinction. Similar limits are obtained for SNe\n2006X and 2007le.\n", "  In this paper, we will use a BIonic solution for analyzing the holographic\ncosmology. A BIonic solution is a configuration of a D3-brane and an\nanti-D3-brane connected by a wormhole, and holographic cosmology is a recent\nproposal to explain cosmic expansion by using the holographic principle. In our\nmodel, a BIonic configuration will be produced by the transition of fundamental\nblack strings. The formation of a BIonic configuration will cause inflation. As\nthe D3-brane moves away from the anti-D3-brane, The wormhole will get\nannihilated, and the inflation will end with the annihilation of this wormhole.\nHowever, it is possible for a D3-brane to collide with an anti-D3-brane. Such a\ncollision will occur if the distance between the D3-brane and the anti-D3-brane\nreduces, and this will create tachyonic states. We will demonstrate that these\ntachyonic states will lead to the formation of a new wormhole, and this will\ncause acceleration of the universe before such a collision.\n", "  Frequently, a set of objects has to be evaluated by a panel of assessors, but\nnot every object is assessed by every assessor. A problem facing such panels is\nhow to take into account different standards amongst panel members and varying\nlevels of confidence in their scores. Here, a mathematically-based algorithm is\ndeveloped to calibrate the scores of such assessors, addressing both of these\nissues. The algorithm is based on the connectivity of the graph of assessors\nand objects evaluated, incorporating declared confidences as weights on its\nedges. If the graph is sufficiently well connected, relative standards can be\ninferred by comparing how assessors rate objects they assess in common,\nweighted by the levels of confidence of each assessment. By removing these\nbiases, \"true\" values are inferred for all the objects. Reliability estimates\nfor the resulting values are obtained. The algorithm is tested in two case\nstudies, one by computer simulation and another based on realistic evaluation\ndata. The process is compared to the simple averaging procedure in widespread\nuse, and to Fisher's additive incomplete block analysis. It is anticipated that\nthe algorithm will prove useful in a wide variety of situations such as\nevaluation of the quality of research submitted to national assessment\nexercises; appraisal of grant proposals submitted to funding panels; ranking of\njob applicants; and judgement of performances on degree courses wherein\ncandidates can choose from lists of options.\n", "  To elucidate mechanisms of mesoscopic turbulence exhibited by active\nparticles, we experimentally study turbulent states of non-living\nself-propelled particles. We realize an experimental system with dense\nsuspensions of asymmetrical colloidal particles (Janus particles)\nself-propelling on a two-dimensional surface under an AC electric field.\nVelocity fields of the Janus particles in the crowded situation can be regarded\nas a sort of turbulence because it contains many vortices and their velocities\nchange abruptly. Correlation functions of their velocity field reveal the\ncoexistence of polar alignment and anti-parallel alignment interactions, which\nis considered to trigger mesoscopic turbulence. Probability distributions of\nlocal order parameters for polar and nematic orders indicate the formation of\nlocal clusters with particles moving in the same direction. A broad peak in the\nenergy spectrum of the velocity field appears at the spatial scales where the\npolar alignment and the cluster formation are observed. Energy is injected at\nthe particle scale and such conserved quantity as energy could be cascading\ntoward the larger clusters.\n", "  We demonstrate the trapping of cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms in a toroidal geometry\nusing a radio frequency (rf) dressed quadrupole magnetic trap formed by\nsuperposing a strong rf-field on a quadrupole trap. This rf-dressed quadrupole\ntrap has the minimum potential away from the quadrupole trap centre on a\ncircular path which facilitates trapping in toroidal geometry. In these\nexperiments, the laser cooled atoms were first trapped in a quadrupole trap,\nthen cooled evaporatively using a weak rf-field, and finally trapped in an\nrf-dressed quadrupole trap. The radius of the toroid could be varied by varying\nthe frequency of the dressing rf-field. It has also been demonstrated that a\nsingle rf source and an antenna can be used for the rf-evaporative cooling as\nwell as for the rf-dressing of atoms. The atoms trapped in the toroidal trap\nmay have applications in the realization of an atom gyroscope as well as in\nstudying the quantum gases in low dimensions.\n", "  The KOTO ($K^0$ at Tokai) experiment aims to observe the CP-violating rare\ndecay $K_L \\rightarrow \\pi^0 \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ by using a long-lived neutral-kaon\nbeam produced by the 30 GeV proton beam at the Japan Proton Accelerator\nResearch Complex. The $K_L$ flux is an essential parameter for the measurement\nof the branching fraction. Three $K_L$ neutral decay modes, $K_L \\rightarrow\n3\\pi^0$, $K_L \\rightarrow 2\\pi^0$, and $K_L \\rightarrow 2\\gamma$ were used to\nmeasure the $K_L$ flux in the beam line in the 2013 KOTO engineering run. A\nMonte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the detector acceptance for these\ndecays. Agreement was found between the simulation model and the experimental\ndata, and the remaining systematic uncertainty was estimated at the 1.4\\%\nlevel. The $K_L$ flux was measured as $(4.183 \\pm 0.017_{\\mathrm{stat.}} \\pm\n0.059_{\\mathrm{sys.}}) \\times 10^7$ $K_L$ per $2\\times 10^{14}$ protons on a\n66-mm-long Au target.\n", "  In this paper the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole, which is\npresented as a vacuum homogeneous and anisotropic Kantowski-Sachs\nminisuperspace cosmological model, is considered. Lagrangian of the model is\nreduced by a suitable coordinate transformation to Lagrangian of two decoupled\noscillators with the same frequencies and with zero energy in total (an\noscillator-ghost-oscillator system). The model will be presented in a\nclassical, a p-adic and a noncommutative case. Then, within the standard\nquantum approach Wheeler-DeWitt equation and its general solutions, i.e. a wave\nfunction of the model, will be written, and then an adelic wave function will\nbe constructed. Finally, thermodynamics of the model will be studied by using\nthe Feynman-Hibbs procedure.\n", "  We propose general relations between the conformal anomaly and the chiral\n(R-symmetry and gravitational) anomaly coefficients in 6d (1,0) superconformal\ntheories. The suggested expressions for the three type B conformal anomaly\nc-coefficients complement the expression for the type A anomaly a-coefficient\nfound in arXiv:1506.03807. We check them on several examples -- the standard\n(1,0) hyper and tensor multiplets as well as some higher derivative short\nmultiplets containing vector fields that generalize the superconformal 6d\nvector multiplet discussed in arXiv:1506.08727. We also consider a family of\nhigher derivative superconformal (2,0) 6d multiplets associated to 7d\nmultiplets in the KK spectrum of 11d supergravity compactified on S^4. In\nparticular, we prove that (2,0) 6d conformal supergravity coupled to 26 tensor\nmultiplets is free of all chiral and conformal anomalies. We discuss some\ninteracting (1,0) superconformal theories, predicting the c-coefficients for\nthe \"E-string\" theory on multiple M5-branes at E_8 9-brane and for the theory\ndescribing M5-branes at an orbifold singularity. Finally, we elaborate on\nholographic computation of subleading corrections to conformal anomaly\ncoefficients coming from R^2+R^3 terms in 7d effective action, revisiting, in\nparticular, the (2,0) theory case.\n", "  We present a new quantum secret sharing protocol based on recent advances in\nMermin-type contextuality scenarios, which has some security guarantees against\npostquantum nonsignaling attackers. It is a fundamental assumption of secret\nsharing protocols that not all players are trusted parties, and that some may\ncollude amongst themselves and with eavesdroppers to break confidentiality. To\nthis extent, quantum secret sharing introduces a new layer of security,\nenabling eavesdropping detection via entangled states and noncommuting\nobservables. A more thorough security analysis, however, becomes crucial if the\nprotocol relies on untrusted devices for its implementation: for example, it\ncannot be excluded that some players may collude with the device supplier. In\nthis paper, we put recent developments in Mermin-type contextuality to work in\na new quantum secret sharing protocol. The maximal contextuality (aka maximal\nnon-locality, or zero local fraction) demonstrated by the measurement scenarios\nresults in some device-independent security guarantees against nonsignaling\nattackers -- be they classical, quantum or postquantum.\n", "  Dissipation can be represented in Hamiltonian mechanics in an extended phase\nspace as a symplectic process. The method uses an auxiliary variable which\nrepresents the excitation of unresolved dynamics and a Hamiltonian for the\ninteraction between the resolved dynamics and the auxiliary variable. This\nmethod is applied to viscous dissipation (including hyper-viscosity) in a\ntwo-dimensional fluid, for which the dynamics is non-canonical. We derive a\nmetriplectic representation and suggest a measure for the entropy of the\nsystem.\n", "  We carried out spectroscopic observations with Subaru/HDS of 50 solar-type\nsuperflare stars found from Kepler data. More than half (34 stars) of the\ntarget stars show no evidence of the binary system, and we confirmed\natmospheric parameters of these stars are roughly in the range of solar-type\nstars. We then conducted the detailed analyses for these 34 stars. First, the\nvalue of the \"$v\\sin i$\" (projected rotational velocity) measured from\nspectroscopic results is consistent with the rotational velocity estimated from\nthe brightness variation. Second, there is a correlation between the amplitude\nof the brightness variation and the intensity of Ca II IR triplet line. All the\ntargets expected to have large starspots because of their large amplitude of\nthe brightness variation show high chromospheric activities compared with the\nSun. These results support that the brightness variation of superflare stars is\nexplained by the rotation of a star with large starspots.\n", "  In soft and condensed matter physics, effective interactions often emerge as\na result of the spatial confinement of a fluctuating field. For instance,\nmicroscopic particles in a binary liquid mixture are subject to critical\nCasimir forces whenever their surfaces confine the thermal fluctuations of the\norder parameter of this kind of solvent, the range of which diverges upon\napproaching the critical demixing point. Critical Casimir forces are predicted\nto be nonadditive on a particular large scale. However, a direct experimental\nevidence of this fact is still lacking. Here, we fill in this gap by reporting\nthe experimental measurement of the associated many-body effects. In\nparticular, we focus on three colloidal particles in optical traps and observe\nthat the critical Casimir force exerted on one of them by the other two\ncolloids differs from the sum of the forces they exert separately. The\nmagnitude and range of this three-body effect turn out to depend sensitively on\nthe distance from the critical point of the solvent and on the preferential\nadsorption at the surfaces of the colloids for the two components of the\nmixture.\n", "  We present a lattice study of a four fermion theory, known as Nambu\nJona-Lasinio (NJL) theory, via Wilson fermions. Four fermion interactions\nnaturally occur in several extensions of the Standard Model as a low energy\nparameterisation of a more fundamental theory. In models of dynamical\nelectroweak symmetry breaking these operators, at an effective level, are used\nto endow the Standard Model fermions with masses. Furthermore these operators,\nwhen sufficiently strong, can drastically modify the fundamental composite\ndynamics by, for example, turning a strongly coupled infrared conformal theory\ninto a (near) conformal one with desirable features for model building. As\nfirst step, we study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking for the lattice\nversion of the NJL model.\n", "  The BB84 quantum key distribution protocol is semi device independent in the\nsense that it can be shown to be secure if just one of the users' devices is\nrestricted to a qubit Hilbert space. Here, we derive an analytic lower bound on\nthe asymptotic secret key rate for the entanglement-based version of BB84\nassuming only that one of the users performs unknown qubit POVMs. The result\nholds against the class of collective attacks and reduces to the well known\nShor-Preskill key rate for correlations corresponding to the ideal BB84\ncorrelations mixed with any amount of random noise.\n", "  Under appropriate conditions for the initial configuration, the empirical\nmeasure of the $N$-particle Dyson model with parameter $\\beta \\geq 1$ converges\nto a unique measure-valued process as $N$ goes to infinity, which is\nindependent of $\\beta$. The limit process is characterized by its Stieltjes\ntransform called the Green's function. Since the Green's function satisfies the\ncomplex Burgers equation in the inviscid limit, this is called the hydrodynamic\nlimit of the Dyson model. We review the relations among the hydrodynamic\nequation of the Green's function, the continuity equation of the probability\ndensity function, and the functional equation of the Green's function. The\nbasic tools to prove the relations are the Hilbert transform, a special case of\nthe Sokhotski-Plemelj theorem, and the method of characteristics for solving\npartial differential equations. For two special initial configurations, we\ndemonstrate how to characterize the limit processes using these relations.\n", "  The decays $\\tau \\rightarrow (\\eta,\\eta') K^{-} \\nu_{\\tau}$ are described in\nthe framework of the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. Both full and\ndifferential widths of these decays are calculated. The vector and scalar\nchannels are considered. In the vector channels, the subprocesses with\nintermediate $K^{*}(892)$ and $K^{*}(1410)$ mesons play the main role. In the\nscalar channels, the subprocesses with intermediate $K_{0}^{*}(800)$ and\n$K_{0}^{*}(1430)$ mesons are taken into account. Scalar channels play a less\nimportant role in calculation of the full width of the decay $\\tau \\rightarrow\n(\\eta,\\eta') K^{-} \\nu_{\\tau}$. The obtained results are in satisfactory\nagreement with the experimental data.\n", "  In this work, we find an analytical flat-membrane solution to the saddle\npoint equations, derived by Guinea et al. [Phys. Rev. B 89, 125428 (2014)], for\nthe case of a suspended graphene membrane of circular shape. We also find how\ndifferent buckled membrane solutions bifurcate from the flat membrane at\ncritical temperatures and membrane radii. The saddle point equations take into\naccount electron-phonon coupling and this coupling provides a residual stress\neven for a flat graphene layer. Below a critical temperature (which is\nexceedingly high for an infinite layer) or above a critical size that depend on\nboundary conditions, different buckling modes that may be the germ of rippling\nappear. Our results provide the opportunity to develop new feasible experiments\ndealing with buckling in small suspended graphene membranes that could verify\nthem. These experiments may also be used to fit the phonon-electron coupling\nconstant or the bending energy.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental progress in the field of dipolar-Fermi\ngases, we investigate the quantum phases of dipolar fermions, on a triangular\nladder at half filling. Using density matrix renormalization group method, in\npresence of onsite repulsion and intersite attractive interaction, we find\nexotic spin-triplet superfluid phase in addition to the usual spin-density and\ncharge-density waves. We examine the stability of spin-triplet superfluid phase\nby varying hopping along the rungs of the triangle. Possibility of fermionic\nsupersolidity has also been discussed, by considering three- body interaction\nin the Hamiltonian. We also study the effect of spin-dependent hopping on the\nstability of spin-triplet superfluid phase.\n", "  We consider a family of linear viscoelastic shells with thickness\n$2\\varepsilon$ ( $\\varepsilon$ , small parameter), clamped along a portion of\ntheir lateral face, all having the same middle surface $S$. We formulate the\nthree-dimensional mechanical problem in curvilinear coordinates and provide\nexistence and uniqueness of (weak) solution of the corresponding\nthree-dimensional variational problem.\n  We are interested in studying the limit behavior of the three-dimensional\nproblems and their solutions (displacements $\\mathbf{u}^\\varepsilon$ of\ncomponents $u_i^\\varepsilon$) when $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero. To do that, we\nuse asymptotic analysis methods. First, we formulate the variational problem in\na fixed domain independent of $\\varepsilon$. Then we assume an asymptotic\nexpansion of the scaled displacements field\n$\\mathbf{u}(\\varepsilon)=(u_i(\\varepsilon))$. Identifying the terms of the\nproposed asymptotic expansion we characterize the zeroth order term as the\nsolution of a two-dimensional scaled limit problem. Moreover, on one hand, we\nfind that if the applied body force density is $O(1)$ with respect to\n$\\varepsilon$ and surface tractions density is $O(\\varepsilon)$, the limit of\nthe field $\\mathbf{u}(\\varepsilon)$ is the solution of a two-dimensional system\nof variational equations called viscoelastic membrane problem. On the other\nhand, if the applied body force density is $O(\\varepsilon^2)$ and surface\ntractions density is $O(\\varepsilon^3)$, the limit of the field\n$\\mathbf{u}(\\varepsilon)$ is the solution of a system of two-dimensional\nvariational equations called viscoelastic flexural problem.\n  In both cases, we find a model which presents a long-term memory that takes\ninto account the deformations at previous times. We comment on the existence\nand uniqueness of solution for the two-dimensional variational problems found\nand announce convergence results in forthcoming papers.\n", "  We report results of investigation of the current-carrying capacity of\nnanowires made from the quasi-1D van der Waals metal tantalum triselenide\ncapped with quasi-2D boron nitride. The chemical vapor transport method\nfollowed by chemical and mechanical exfoliation were used to fabricate mm-long\nTaSe3 wires with lateral dimensions in the 20 to 70 nm range. Electrical\nmeasurements establish that TaSe3/h-BN nanowire heterostructures have a\nbreakdown current density exceeding 10 MA/cm2 - an order-of-magnitude higher\nthan that in copper. Some devices exhibited an intriguing step-like breakdown,\nwhich can be explained by the atomic thread bundle structure of the nanowires.\nThe quasi-1D single crystal nature of TaSe3 results in low surface roughness\nand the absence of grain boundaries; these features potentially can enable the\ndownscaling of these wires to lateral dimensions in the few-nm range. These\nresults suggest that quasi-1D van der Waals metals have potential for\napplications in the ultimately downscaled local interconnects.\n", "  The recent results by the Fermilab Lattice and MILC collaborations on the\nhadronic matrix elements entering $B_{d,s}-\\bar B_{d,s}$ mixing show a\nsignificant tension of the measured values of the mass differences $\\Delta\nM_{d,s}$ with their SM predictions. We review the implications of these results\nin the context of Constrained Minimal Flavour Violation models. In these\nmodels, the CKM elements $\\gamma$ and $|V_{ub}|/|V_{cb}|$ can be determined\nfrom $B_{d,s}-\\bar B_{d,s}$ mixing observables, yielding a prediction for\n$\\gamma$ below its tree-level value. Determining subsequently $|V_{cb}|$ from\nthe measured value of either $\\Delta M_s$ or $\\varepsilon_K$ gives inconsistent\nresults, with the tension being smallest in the Standard Model limit. This\ntension can be resolved if the flavour universality of new contributions to\n$\\Delta F = 2$ observables is broken. We briefly discuss the case of $U(2)^3$\nflavour models as an illustrative example.\n", "  We have studied the physical and chemical properties of 18 southern Red\nMidcourse Space Experiment Sources (RMSs), using archival data taken from the\nAtacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy,\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array, and the Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team\nSurvey at 90 GHz. Most of our sources have simple cometary/unresolved radio\nemissions at 4.8 and/or 8.6GHz. The large number of Lyman continuum fluxes (NL)\nindicates they are probably massive O- or early B-type star formation regions.\nArchival IRAS infrared data are used to estimate the dust temperature, which is\nabout 30 K of our sources. Then, the H2 column densities and the\nvolume-averaged H2 number densities are estimated using the 0.87 mm dust\nemissions. Large-scale infall and ionized accretions may be occurring in\nG345.4881+00.3148. We also attempt to characterize the chemical properties of\nthese RMSs through molecular line (N2H+ (1-0) and HCO+ (1-0)) observations.\nMost of the detected N2H+ and HCO+ emissions match well with the dust emission,\nimplying a close link to their chemical evolution in the RMSs. We found that\nthe abundance of N2H+ is one order of magnitude lower than that in other\nsurveys of infrared dark clouds, and a positive correlation between the\nabundances of N2H+ and HCO+. The fractional abundance of N2H+ with respect to\nH2 seems to decrease as a function of NL. These observed trends could be\ninterpreted as an indication of enhanced destruction of N2H+, either by CO or\nthrough dissociative recombination with electrons produced by central UV\nphotons.\n", "  A discovery of the unusual thermal properties of graphene stimulated\nexperimental, theoretical and computational research directed at understanding\nphonon transport and thermal conduction in two-dimensional material systems. We\nprovide a critical review of recent results in the graphene thermal field\nfocusing on phonon dispersion, specific heat, thermal conductivity, and\ncomparison of different models and computational approaches. The correlation\nbetween the phonon spectrum in graphene-based materials and the heat conduction\nproperties is analyzed in details. The effects of the atomic plane rotations in\nbilayer graphene, isotope engineering, and relative contributions of different\nphonon dispersion branches are discussed. For readers' convenience, the\nsummaries of main experimental and theoretical results on thermal conductivity\nas well as phonon mode contributions to thermal transport are provided in the\nform of comprehensive annotated tables.\n", "  Within the framework of the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD)\ntransport model, pion dynamics in heavy-ion collisions near threshold energies\nand the emission of preequilibrium particles (nucleons and light complex\nfragments) have been investigated. A density, momentum and isospin dependent\npion-nucleon potential based on the $\\Delta$-hole model is implemented in the\ntransport approach, which slightly leads to the increase of the\n$\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio, but reduces the total pion yields. It is found that a\nbump structure of the $\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}$ ratio in the kinetic energy spectra\nappears at the pion energy close to the $\\Delta$(1232) resonance region. The\nyield ratios of neutrons to protons from the squeeze-out particles\nperpendicular to the reaction plane are sensitive to the stiffness of nuclear\nsymmetry energy, in particular at the high-momentum (kinetic energy) tails.\n", "  We theoretically study the conformations of a helical semi-flexible filament\nconfined to a flat surface. This squeezed helix exhibits a variety of\nunexpected shapes resembling circles, waves or spirals depending on the\nmaterial parameters. We explore the conformation space in detail and show that\nthe shapes can be understood as the mutual elastic interaction of\nconformational quasi-particles. Our theoretical results are potentially useful\nto determine the material parameters of such helical filaments in an\nexperimental setting.\n", "  Resource theory is a widely-applicable framework for analyzing the physical\nresources required for given tasks, such as computation, communication, and\nenergy extraction. In this paper, we propose a general scheme for analyzing\nresource theories based on resource destroying maps, which leave resource-free\nstates unchanged but erase the resource stored in all other states. We\nintroduce a group of general conditions that determine whether a quantum\noperation exhibits typical resource-free properties in relation to a given\nresource destroying map. Our theory reveals fundamental connections among basic\nelements of resource theories, in particular, free states, free operations, and\nresource measures. In particular, we define a class of simple resource measures\nthat can be calculated without optimization, and that are monotone\nnonincreasing under operations that commute with the resource destroying map.\nWe apply our theory to the resources of coherence and quantum correlations\n(e.g., discord), two prominent features of nonclassicality.\n", "  Using a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo technique, we have studied the time\nevolution of a cold atom cloud interacting with a time dependent radio\nfrequency (rf) dressed state potential. Exposure of a cloud of $^{87}Rb$ atoms,\ntrapped in a quadrupole magnetic trap, to a time dependent rf-field with\nincreasing amplitude and decreasing frequency, shows a variation in the number\nof trapped atoms and the overall shape of the atom cloud. It is shown by\nsimulations that, initially at lower rf-field strength, the rf-field results in\nejection of atoms from the trap, leading to evaporative cooling of the atom\ncloud. Later, at higher rf-field strength, the atoms undergo the non-adiabatic\nLandau-Zener (LZ) transitions, which leads to their trapping in an rf-dressed\nstate potential of toroidal shape. The results of simulations explain the\nexperimentally observed results. The simulations can be useful to predict the\natom cloud dynamics and trapping geometries with other forms of the potential.\n", "  We address the question about the reasons why the \"Wick-rotated\",\npositive-definite, space-time metric obeys the Pythagorean theorem. An answer\nis proposed based on the convexity and smoothness properties of the functional\nspaces purporting to provide the kinematic framework of approaches to quantum\ngravity. We employ moduli of convexity and smoothness which are eventually\nextremized by Hilbert spaces. We point out the potential physical significance\nthat functional analytical dualities play in this framework. Following the\nspirit of the variational principles employed in classical and quantum Physics,\nsuch Hilbert spaces dominate in a generalized functional integral approach. The\nmetric of space-time is induced by the inner product of such Hilbert spaces.\n", "  We report synthesis, crystal structure and physical properties of a novel\nquinary compound RbGd$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$O$_2$. The new iron oxyarsenide is\nisostructural to the fluo-arsenide KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$, both of which\ncontain separate double Fe$_2$As$_2$ layers that are self hole-doped in the\nstoichiometric composition. Bulk superconductivity at $T_\\mathrm{c}$ = 35 K is\ndemonstrated by the measurements of electrical resistivity, dc magnetic\nsusceptibility and heat capacity. An exceptionally high value of the initial\nslope of the upper critical field\n($\\mu_0$d$H_{\\mathrm{c2}}$/d$T|_{T_\\mathrm{c}}$ = 16.5 T/K) is measured for the\npolycrystalline sample.\n", "  We establish a quantum version of the classical isoperimetric inequality\nrelating the Fisher information and the entropy power of a quantum state. The\nkey tool is a Fisher information inequality for a state which results from a\ncertain convolution operation: the latter maps a classical probability\ndistribution on phase space and a quantum state to a quantum state. We show\nthat this inequality also gives rise to several related inequalities whose\ncounterparts are well-known in the classical setting: in particular, it implies\nan entropy power inequality for the mentioned convolution operation as well as\nthe isoperimetric inequality, and establishes concavity of the entropy power\nalong trajectories of the quantum heat diffusion semigroup. As an application,\nwe derive a Log-Sobolev inequality for the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nsemigroup, and argue that it implies fast convergence towards the fixed point\nfor a large class of initial states.\n", "  The nonequilibrium short-time critical behaviors of driven and undriven\nlattice gases are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations in two spatial\ndimensions starting from a fully disordered initial configuration. In\nparticular, we study the time evolution of suitably defined order parameters,\nwhich account for the strong anisotropy introduced by the homogeneous drive. We\ndemonstrate that, at short times, the dynamics of all these models is\nunexpectedly described by an effective continuum theory in which transverse\nfluctuations, i.e., fluctuations averaged along the drive, are Gaussian,\nirrespective of this being actually the case in the stationary state. Strong\nnumerical evidence is provided, in remarkable agreement with that theory, both\nfor the driven and undriven lattice gases, which therefore turn out to display\nthe same short-time dynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the relationship of quantum teleportation in\nquantum information science and the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl (BMW) algebra in\nlow-dimensional topology. For simplicity, we focus on the two spin-1/2\nrepresentation of the BMW algebra, which is generated by both the\nTemperley-Lieb projector and the Yang-Baxter gate. We describe quantum\nteleportation using the Temperley-Lieb projector and the Yang-Baxter gate,\nrespectively, and study teleportation-based quantum computation using the\nYang-Baxter gate. On the other hand, we exploit the extended Temperley-Lieb\ndiagrammatical approach to clearly show that the tangle relations of the BMW\nalgebra have a natural interpretation of quantum teleportation. Inspired by\nthis interpretation, we construct a general representation of the tangle\nrelations of the BMW algebra and obtain interesting representations of the BMW\nalgebra. Therefore our research sheds a light on a link between quantum\ninformation science and low-dimensional topology.\n", "  We study the quench dynamics in continuous relativistic quantum field theory,\nmore specifically the locality properties of the large time stationary state.\nAfter a quantum quench in a one-dimensional integrable model, the expectation\nvalues of local observables are expected to relax to a Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble (GGE), constructed out of the conserved charges of the model.\nQuenching to a free bosonic theory, it has been shown that the system indeed\nrelaxes to a GGE described by the momentum mode occupation numbers. We first\naddress the question whether the latter can be written directly in terms of\nlocal charges and we find that, in contrast to the lattice case, this is not\npossible in continuous field theories. We then investigate the less stringent\nrequirement of the existence of a sequence of truncated local GGEs that\nconverges to the correct steady state, in the sense of the expectation values\nof the local observables. While we show that such a sequence indeed exists, in\norder to unequivocally determine the so-defined GGE, we find that information\nabout the expectation value of the recently discovered quasi-local charges is\nin the end necessary, the latter being the suitable generalization of the local\ncharges while passing from the lattice to the continuum. Lastly, we study the\nlocality properties of the GGE and show that the latter is completely\ndetermined by the knowledge of the expectation value of a countable set of\nsuitably defined quasi-local charges.\n", "  The soliton solutions of the Degasperis-Procesi equations are constructed by\nthe implementation of the dressing method. The form of the one and two soliton\nsolutions coincides with the form obtained by Hirota's method.\n", "  We discuss the experimental engineering of model systems for the description\nof QED in one spatial dimension via a mixture of bosonic $^{23}$Na and\nfermionic $^6$Li atoms. The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical\nsuperlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions\nwhich preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large\nnumber of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate\non each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of\nlattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the\nrange of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon\nexperiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples\nof bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the\ndescription of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and\nstring breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic\nsystem and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results\ndemonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with\nultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental\nsetup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for\nwhich classical computational methods are no longer applicable.\n", "  Since the technological breakthrough prompted by the inception of light\nemitting diodes based on III-nitrides, these material systems have emerged as\nstrategic semiconductors not only for the lighting of the future, but also for\nthe new generation of high-power electronic and spintronic devices. While\nIII-nitride optoelectronics in the visible and ultraviolet spectral range is\nwidely established, all-nitride and In-free efficient devices in the\nnear-infrared (NIR) are still wanted. Here, through a comprehensive protocol of\ndesign, modeling, epitaxial growth and in-depth characterization, we develop\nAl$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N:Mn/GaN NIR distributed Bragg reflectors and we show their\nefficiency in combination with GaN:(Mn,Mg) layers containing Mn-Mg$_{k}$\ncomplexes optically active in the telecommunication range of wavelengths.\n", "  Similar to electron waves, the phonon states in semiconductors can undergo\nchanges induced by external boundaries. Modification of acoustic phonon\nspectrum in structures with periodically modulated elastic constant or mass\ndensity - referred to as phononic crystals - has been proven experimentally and\nutilized in practical applications. A possibility of modifying acoustic phonon\nspectrum in individual nanostructures via spatial confinement would bring\ntremendous benefits for controlling phonon-electron interaction and thermal\nconduction at nanoscale. However, despite strong scientific and practical\nimportance, conclusive experimental evidence of acoustic phonon confinement in\nindividual free-standing nanostructures, e.g. nanowires, is still missing. The\nlength scale, at which phonon dispersion undergoes changes and a possibility of\nthe phonon group velocity reduction, are debated. Here, we utilize specially\ndesigned high-quality GaAs nanowires (NWs) with different diameters, D, and\nlarge inter-nanowire distances to directly demonstrate acoustic phonon\nconfinement. The measurements conducted with Brillouin - Mandelstam\nspectroscopy reveal confined phonon polarization branches with frequencies from\n4 GHz to 40 GHz in NWs with D as large as ~128 nm, i.e. at length scale, which\nexceeds the \"grey\" phonon mean-free path in GaAs by an almost an order of\nmagnitude. The phonon dispersion modification and phonon energy scaling with D\nin individual nanowires are in excellent agreement with theory. The obtained\nresults can lead to more efficient nanoscale control of acoustic phonons, with\nbenefits for nanoelectronics, thermoelectric energy conversion, thermal\nmanagement, and novel spintronic technologies.\n", "  It has been recently pointed out that neutrino fluxes from a supernova can\nshow substantial flavor conversions almost immediately above the core. Using\nlinear stability analyses and numerical solutions of the fully nonlinear\nequations of motion, we perform a detailed study of these fast conversions,\nfocussing on the region just above the supernova core. We carefully specify the\ninstabilities for evolution in space or time, andfind that neutrinos travelling\ntowards the core make fast conversions more generic, i.e., possible for a wider\nrange of flux ratios and angular asymmetries that produce a crossing between\nthe zenith-angle spectra of $\\nu_e$ and ${\\bar\\nu_e}$. Using fluxes and angular\ndistributions predicted by supernova simulations, we find that fast conversions\ncan occur within tens of nanoseconds, only a few meters away from the putative\nneutrinospheres. If these fast flavor conversions indeed take place, they would\nhave important implications for the supernova explosion mechanism and\nnucleosynthesis.\n", "  We reformulate the scattering amplitudes of 4D flat space gauge theory and\ngravity in the language of a 2D CFT on the celestial sphere. The resulting CFT\nstructure exhibits an OPE constructed from 4D collinear singularities, as well\nas infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras encoding the asymptotic\nsymmetries of 4D flat space. We derive these results by recasting 4D dynamics\nin terms of a convenient foliation of flat space into 3D Euclidean AdS and\nLorentzian dS geometries. Tree-level scattering amplitudes take the form of\nWitten diagrams for a continuum of (A)dS modes, which are in turn equivalent to\nCFT correlators via the (A)dS/CFT dictionary. The Ward identities for the 2D\nconserved currents are dual to 4D soft theorems, while the bulk-boundary\npropagators of massless (A)dS modes are superpositions of the leading and\nsubleading Weinberg soft factors of gauge theory and gravity. In general, the\nmassless (A)dS modes are 3D Chern-Simons gauge fields describing the soft,\nsingle helicity sectors of 4D gauge theory and gravity. Consistent with the\ntopological nature of Chern-Simons theory, Aharonov-Bohm effects record the\n\"tracks\" of hard particles in the soft radiation, leading to a simple\ncharacterization of gauge and gravitational memories. Soft particle exchanges\nbetween hard processes define the Kac-Moody level and Virasoro central charge,\nwhich are thereby related to the 4D gauge coupling and gravitational strength\nin units of an infrared cutoff. Finally, we discuss a toy model for black hole\nhorizons via a restriction to the Rindler region.\n", "  Spacetime and internal symmetries can be used to severely restrict the form\nof the equations for the fundamental laws of physics. The success of this\napproach in the context of general relativity and particle physics motivates\nthe conjecture that symmetries may help us to one day uncover the ultimate\ntheory that provides a unique, unified description of all observed physical\nphenomena. We examine some of the strengths and weaknesses of this conjecture.\n", "  This work rectifies the hydrodynamic equations commonly used to describe the\nsuperfluid velocity field in such a way that vortex dynamics are also taken\ninto account. In the field of quantum turbulence, it is of fundamental\nimportance to know the correct form of the equations which play similar roles\nto the Navier-Stokes equation in classical turbulence. Here, such equations are\nobtained by carefully taking into account the frequently overlooked multivalued\nnature of the $U(1)$ phase field. Such an approach provides exact analytical\nexplanations to some numerically observed features involving the dynamics of\nquantum vortices in Bose-Einstein condensates, such as the universal $t^{1/2}$\nbehavior of reconnecting vortex lines. It also expands these results beyond the\nGross-Pitaevskii theory so that some features can be generalized to other\nsystems such as superfluid $^{4}$He, dipolar condensates, and mixtures of\ndifferent superfluid systems.\n", "  The first-order differential L\\'evy-Leblond equations (LLE's) are the\nnon-relativistic analogs of the Dirac equation, being square roots of\n($1+d$)-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger or heat equations. Just like the Dirac\nequation, the LLE's possess a natural supersymmetry. In previous works it was\nshown that non supersymmetric PDE's (notably, the Schr\\\"odinger equations for\nfree particles or in the presence of a harmonic potential), admit a natural\n${\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetry. In this paper we show that, for a certain\nclass of supersymmetric PDE's, a natural ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb\nZ}_2$-graded Lie symmetry appears. In particular, we exhaustively investigate\nthe symmetries of the $(1+1)$-dimensional L\\'evy-Leblond Equations, both in the\nfree case and for the harmonic potential. In the free case a ${\\mathbb\nZ}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie superalgebra, realized by first and\nsecond-order differential symmetry operators, is found. In the presence of a\nnon-vanishing quadratic potential, the Schr\\\"odinger invariance is maintained,\nwhile the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$- and ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$- graded\nextensions are no longer allowed. The construction of the ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times\n{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie symmetry of the ($1+2$)-dimensional free heat LLE\nintroduces a new feature, explaining the existence of first-order differential\nsymmetry operators not entering the super Schr\\\"odinger algebra.\n", "  The prospects of future galaxy surveys for non-Gaussianity measurements call\nfor the development of robust techniques for computing the bispectrum of\nprimordial cosmological perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel\napproach to the calculation of the squeezed bispectrum in multiple-field\ninflation. With use of the $\\delta N$ formalism, our framework sheds new light\non the recently pointed out difference between the squeezed bispectrum for\nglobal observers and that for local observers, while allowing one to calculate\nboth. For local observers in particular, the squeezed bispectrum is found to\nvanish in single-field inflation. Furthermore, our framework allows one to go\nbeyond the near-equilateral (\"small hierarchy\") limit, and to automatically\ninclude intrinsic non-Gaussianities that do not need to be calculated\nseparately. The explicit computational programme of our method is given and\nillustrated with a few examples.\n", "  $A_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) are the unique Cr-based ambient-pressure\nsuperconductors to date discovered by serendipity in 2015. The new\nsuperconducting family are structurally characterized by quasi one-dimensional\n[(Cr$_3$As$_3$)$^{2-}$]$_{\\infty}$ double-walled subnanotubes, which exhibit\npeculiar properties that mostly point to unconventional superconductivity. In\nthis conference paper, we first describe how the superconductors were\ndiscovered. Then we overview the recent progresses on crystal structure,\nelectronic structures, theoretical models, and various physical properties in\n$A_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$. Some new experimental results are included. Finally we\nconclude by addressing the related open questions in this emerging subfield of\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We construct a holographic model with Weyl corrections in five dimensional\nspacetime. In particular, we introduce a coupling term between the axion fields\nand the Maxwell field such that the momentum is relaxed even in the probe limit\nin this model. We investigate the Drude behavior of the optical conductivity in\nlow frequency region. It is interesting to find that the incoherent part of the\nconductivity is suppressed with the increase of the axion parameter $k/T$,\nwhich is in contrast to other holographic axionic models at finite density.\nFurthermore, we study the superconductivity associated with the condensation of\na complex scalar field and evaluate the critical temperature for condensation\nin both analytical and numerical manner. It turns out that the critical\ntemperature decreases with $\\tilde{k}$,indicating that the condensation becomes\nharder in the presence of the axions, while it increases with Weyl parameter\n$\\gamma$. We also discuss the change of the gap in optical conductivity with\ncoupling parameters. Finally, we evaluate the charge density of the superfluid\nin zero temperature limit, and find that it exhibits a linear relation with\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_{DC}(\\tilde{T_c})\\tilde{T_c}$, such that a modified version of\nHomes' law is testified.\n", "  A cavity quantum electrodynamical scenario is proposed for implementing a\nSchr\\\"odinger microscope capable of amplifying differences between non\northogonal atomic quantum states. The scheme involves an ensemble of\nidentically prepared two-level atoms interacting pairwise with a single mode of\nthe radiation field as described by the Tavis-Cummings model. By repeated\nmeasurements of the cavity field and of one atom within each pair a\nmeasurement-induced nonlinear quantum transformation of the relevant atomic\nstates can be realized. The intricate dynamical properties of this nonlinear\nquantum transformation, which exhibits measurement-induced chaos, allows\napproximate orthogonalization of atomic states by purification after a few\niterations of the protocol, and thus the application of the scheme for quantum\nstate discrimination.\n", "  Classifying phases of matter is a central problem in physics. For quantum\nmechanical systems, this task can be daunting owing to the exponentially large\nHilbert space. Thanks to the available computing power and access to ever\nlarger data sets, classification problems are now routinely solved using\nmachine learning techniques. Here, we propose to use a neural network based\napproach to find phase transitions depending on the performance of the neural\nnetwork after training it with deliberately incorrectly labelled data. We\ndemonstrate the success of this method on the topological phase transition in\nthe Kitaev chain, the thermal phase transition in the classical Ising model,\nand the many-body-localization transition in a disordered quantum spin chain.\nOur method does not depend on order parameters, knowledge of the topological\ncontent of the phases, or any other specifics of the transition at hand. It\ntherefore paves the way to a generic tool to identify unexplored phase\ntransitions.\n", "  We present the performances of two 92% enriched $^{130}$TeO$_2$ crystals\noperated as thermal bolometers in view of a next generation experiment to\nsearch for neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{130}$Te. The crystals, 435 g\neach, show an energy resolution, evaluated at the 2615 keV $\\gamma$-line of\n$^{208}$Tl, of 6.5 and 4.3 keV FWHM. The only observable internal radioactive\ncontamination arises from $^{238}$U (15 and 8 $\\mu$Bq/kg, respectively). The\ninternal activity of the most problematic nuclei for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay, $^{226}$Ra and $^{228}$Th, are both evaluated as $<$3.1 $\\mu$Bq/kg for\none crystal and $<$2.3 $\\mu$Bq/kg for the second. Thanks to the readout of the\nweak Cherenkov light emitted by $\\beta/\\gamma$ particles by means of\nNeganov-Luke bolometric light detectors we were able to perform an\nevent-by-event identification of $\\beta/\\gamma$ events with a 95% acceptance\nlevel, while establishing a rejection factor of 98.21% and 99.99% for $\\alpha$\nparticles.\n", "  Recent analysis \\citep{McGaugh2016} of the SPARC galaxy sample found a\nsurprisingly tight relation between the radial acceleration inferred from the\nrotation curves, and the acceleration due to the baryonic components of the\ndisc. It has been suggested that this relation may be evidence for new physics,\nbeyond $\\Lambda CDM$. In this letter we show that 32 galaxies from the MUGS2\nmatch the SPARC acceleration relation. These cosmological simulations of star\nforming, rotationally supported discs were simulated with a {\\sc WMAP3}\n$\\Lambda CDM$ cosmology, and match the SPARC acceleration relation with less\nscatter than the observational data. These results show that this acceleration\nrelation is a consequence of dissipative collapse of baryons, rather than being\nevidence for exotic dark-sector physics or new dynamical laws.\n", "  We construct and study a version of the Berry-Keating operator with a\nbuilt-in truncation of the phase space, which we choose to be a two-dimensional\ntorus. The operator is a Weyl quantisation of the classical Hamiltonian for an\ninverted harmonic oscillator, producing a difference operator on a finite,\nperiodic lattice. We investigate the continuum and the infinite-volume limit of\nour model in conjunction with the semiclassical limit. Using semiclassical\nmethods, we show that a specific combination of the limits leads to a\nlogarithmic mean spectral density as it was anticipated by Berry and Keating.\n", "  We construct charged black hole solutions with hyperscaling violation in the\ninfrared(IR) region in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory and investigate\nthe temperature behavior of the ratio of holographic shear viscosity to the\nentropy density. When translational symmetry breaking is relevant in the IR,\nthe power law of the ratio is testified numerically at low temperature $T$,\nnamely, $\\eta/s\\sim T^\\kappa$, where the values of exponent $\\kappa$ coincide\nwith the analytical results. We also find that the exponent $\\kappa$ is not\naffected by irrelevant current, but is reduced by the relevant current.\n", "  A new gauge singlet scalar field can undergo a strongly first-order phase\ntransition (PT) leading to gravitational waves (GW) potentially observable at\naLIGO and simultaneously stabilize the electroweak vacuum. aLIGO (O5) is\npotentially sensitive to cosmological PTs at $10^7$-$10^8$ GeV, which coincides\nwith the requirement that the singlet scale is less than the Standard Model\n(SM) vacuum instability scale, which is between $10^8$ GeV and $10^{14}$ GeV.\nAfter sampling its parameter space, we identify three benchmark points with a\nPT at about $T\\approx 10^7$ GeV in a gauge singlet extension of the SM. We\ncalculate the nucleation temperature, order parameter, characteristic\ntimescale, and peak amplitude and frequency of GW from bubble collisions during\nthe PT for the benchmarks and find that, in an optimistic scenario, GW from\nsuch a PT may be in reach of aLIGO (O5). We confirm that the singlet stabilizes\nthe electroweak vacuum whilst remaining consistent with zero-temperature\nphenomenology as well. Thus, this scenario presents an intriguing possibility\nthat aLIGO may detect traces of fundamental physics motivated by vacuum\nstability at an energy scale that is well above the reach of any other\nexperiment.\n", "  A three-terminal Josephson junction consists of three superconductors coupled\ncoherently to a small nonsuperconducting island, such as a diffusive metal, a\nsingle or double quantum dot. A specific resonant single quantum dot\nthree-terminal Josephson junction $(S_a,S_b,S_c)$ biased with voltages\n$(V,-V,0)$ is considered, but the conclusions hold more generally for resonant\nsemi-conducting quantum wire set-ups. A simple physical picture of the steady\nstate is developed, using Floquet theory. It is shown that the equilibrium\nAndreev bound states (for $V=0$) evolve into nonequilibrium\nFloquet-Wannier-Stark-Andreev (FWS-Andreev) ladders of resonances (for $V\\ne\n0$). These resonances acquire a finite width due to multiple Andreev reflection\n(MAR) processes. We also consider the effect of an extrinsic line-width\nbroadening on the quantum dot, introduced through a Dynes phenomenological\nparameter. The DC-quartet current manifests a cross-over between the extrinsic\nrelaxation dominated regime at low voltage to an intrinsic relaxation due to\nMAR processes at higher voltage. Finally, we study the coupling between the two\nFWS-Andreev ladders due to Landau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg transitions, and its\neffect on the cross-over in the relaxation mechanism. Three important\nlow-energy scales are identified, and a perspective is to relate those\nlow-energy scales to a recent noise cross-correlation experiment [Y. Cohen {\\it\net al.}, arXiv:1606.08436].\n", "  We investigated r-process nucleosynthesis in magneto-rotational supernovae,\nbased on a new explosion mechanism induced by the magneto-rotational\ninstability. A series of axisymmetric magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with\ndetailed microphysics including neutrino heating is performed, numerically\nresolving the magneto-rotational instability. Neutrino-heating dominated\nexplosions, enhanced by magnetic fields, showed mildly neutron-rich ejecta\nproducing nuclei up to $A \\sim 130$ (i.e. the weak r-process), while explosion\nmodels with stronger magnetic fields reproduce a solar-like r-process pattern.\nMore commonly seen abundance patterns in our models are in between the weak and\nregular r-process, producing lighter and intermediate mass nuclei. These {\\it\nintermediate r-processes} exhibit a variety of abundance distributions,\ncompatible with several abundance patterns in r-process-enhanced metal-poor\nstars. The amount of Eu ejecta $\\sim 10^{-5} M_\\odot$ in magnetically-driven\njets agrees with predicted values in the chemical evolution of early galaxies.\nIn contrast, neutrino-heating dominated explosions have a significant amount of\nFe ($^{56}{\\rm Ni}$) and Zn, comparable to regular supernovae and hypernovae,\nrespectively. These results indicate magneto-rotational supernovae can produce\na wide range of heavy nuclei from iron-group to r-process elements, depending\non the explosion dynamics.\n", "  New constraints are presented on the spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interaction\nfrom the PandaX-II experiment, using a data set corresponding to a total\nexposure of 3.3$\\times10^4$ kg-days. Assuming a standard axial-vector\nspin-dependent WIMP interaction with $^{129}$Xe and $^{131}$Xe nuclei, the most\nstringent upper limits on WIMP-neutron cross sections for WIMPs with masses\nabove 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ are set in all dark matter direct detection experiments.\nThe minimum upper limit of $4.1\\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ at 90\\% confidence level\nis obtained for a WIMP mass of 40 GeV/c$^{2}$. This represents more than a\nfactor of two improvement on the best available limits at this and higher\nmasses. These improved cross-section limits provide more stringent constraints\non the effective WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron couplings.\n", "  We propose a {\\em model-independent} method to test CP-violation in the\nscalar sector through measuring the inclusive cross sections of\n$e^+e^-\\rightarrow Zh_1,Zh_2,h_1h_2$ processes with the recoil mass technique,\nwhere $h_1, h_2$ stand for the 125 GeV standard model (SM) like Higgs boson and\na new lighter scalar respectively. This method effectively measures a quantity\n$K$ proportional to the product of the three couplings of $h_1ZZ,h_2ZZ,h_1h_2Z$\nvertices. The value of $K$ encodes a part of information about CP-violation in\nthe scalar sector. We simulate the signal and backgrounds for the processes\nmentioned above with $m_{2}=40\\textrm{GeV}$ at the Circular Electron-Positron\nCollider (CEPC) with the integrated luminosity $5\\textrm{ab}^{-1}$. We find\nthat the discovery of both $Zh_2$ and $h_1h_2$ processes at $5\\sigma$ level\nwill indicate an $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ $K$ value which can be measured to\n$16\\%$ precision. The method is applied to the weakly-coupled Lee model in\nwhich CP-violation can be tested either before or after utilizing a \"$p_T$\nbalance\" cut (see \\autoref{simu} for the definition). Lastly we point out that\n$K\\neq 0$ is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for the existence of\nCP-violation in the scalar sector, namely $K = 0$ does not imply CP\nconservation in the scalar sector.\n", "  We present the Palomar Transient Factory discoveries and the photometric and\nspectroscopic observations of PTF11kmb and PTF12bho. We show that both\ntransients have properties consistent with the class of calcium-rich gap\ntransients, specifically lower peak luminosities and rapid evolution compared\nto ordinary supernovae, and a nebular spectrum dominated by [Ca II] emission. A\nstriking feature of both transients is their host environments: PTF12bho is an\nintra-cluster transient in the Coma Cluster, while PTF11kmb is located in a\nloose galaxy group, at a physical offset ~150 kpc from the most likely host\ngalaxy. Deep Subaru imaging of PTF12bho rules out an underlying host system to\na limit of $M_R > -8.0$ mag, while Hubble Space Telescope imaging of PTF11kmb\nreveals a marginal counterpart that, if real, could be either a background\ngalaxy or a globular cluster. We show that the offset distribution of Ca-rich\ngap transients is significantly more extreme than that seen for Type Ia\nsupernovae or even short-hard gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Thus, if the offsets\nare caused by a kick, they require larger kick velocities and/or longer merger\ntimes than sGRBs. We also show that almost all Ca-rich gap transients found to\ndate are in group and cluster environments with elliptical host galaxies,\nindicating a very old progenitor population; the remote locations could\npartially be explained by these environments having the largest fraction of\nstars in the intra-group/intra-cluster light following galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions.\n", "  Heat capacities of model systems with finite numbers of effective degrees of\nfreedom are evaluated using canonical and microcanonical thermodynamics.\nDiscrepancies between both approaches, which are observed even in the\ninfinite-size limit, are particularly large in systems that exhibit an\nexcited-state quantum phase transition. The corresponding irregularity of the\nspectrum generates a singularity in the microcanonical heat capacity and\naffects smoothly the canonical heat capacity.\n", "  Porous mesophases, where well-defined particle-depleted 'void' spaces are\npresent within a particle-rich background fluid, can be self-assembled from\ncolloidal particles interacting via isotropic pair interactions with competing\nattractions and repulsions. While such structures could be of wide interest for\ntechnological applications (e.g., filtration, catalysis, absorption, etc.),\nrelatively few studies have investigated the interactions that lead to these\nmorphologies and how they compare to those that produce other\nmicro-phase-separated structures, such as clusters. In this work, we use\ninverse methods of statistical mechanics to design model isotropic pair\npotentials that form porous mesophases. We characterize the resulting porous\nstructures, correlating features of the pair potential with the targeted pore\nsize and the particle packing fraction. The former is primarily encoded by the\namplitude and range of the repulsive barrier of the designed pair potential and\nthe latter by the attractive well depth. We observe a trade-off with respect to\nthe packing fraction of the targeted morphology: greater values support more\nspherical and monodisperse pores that themselves organize into periodic\nstructures, while lower values yield more mobile pores that do not assemble\ninto ordered structures but remain stable over a larger range of packing\nfraction. We conclude by commenting on the limitations of targeting a specific\npore diameter within the present inverse design approach as well as by\ndescribing future directions to overcome these limitations.\n", "  The dynamics of the electrons for a molecule in solution is coupled to the\ndynamics of its polarizable environment, i.e., the solvent. To theoretically\ninvestigate such electronic dynamics, we have recently developed equations of\nmotion (EOM) for the apparent solvent polarization charges that generate the\nreaction field in the Polarizable Continuum Model (PCM) for solvation and we\nhave coupled them to a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT\nTDDFT) description of the solute [Corni et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 119, 5405\n(2014)]. Here we present an extension of the EOM-PCM approach to a\nTime-Dependent Configuration Interaction (TD CI) description of the solute\ndynamics, which is free from the qualitative artifacts of RT TDDFT in the\nadiabatic approximation. As tests of the developed approach, we investigate the\nsolvent Debye relaxation after an electronic excitation of the solute obtained\neither by a $\\pi$ pulse of light or by assuming the idealized sudden promotion\nto the excited state. Moreover, we present EOM for the Onsager solvation model\nand we compare the results with PCM. The developed approach provides\nqualitatively correct real-time evolutions and is promising as a general tool\nto investigate the electron dynamics elicited by external electromagnetic\nfields for molecules in solution.\n", "  The results for binding energies of $^6$Li He$_2$ and $^7$Li He$_2$ systems\nare presented. They are obtained by solving Faddeev equations in configuration\nspace. It is shown that the excited states in both systems are of the\nEfimov-type.\n", "  In the present communication we describe the Island-Mainland transition,\noccurring in a square lattice, when black squares are randomly dropped on a\nwhite background. Initially clusters of black squares are observed on the\nconnected white background. But as concentration of black sites increases, at\nsome point the black squares join to form a single continuous black background\nwith white clusters randomly scattered in it. We show that the minimum in the\nEuler number, defined as the difference between number of white clusters and\nnumber of black clusters, reaches a minimum at this point.\n  This occurs at a concentration higher than the well-known percolation phase\ntransition and we show that the phenomenon can be related to experimental\nobservations in several physical systems.\n", "  The recently measured 3.5 keV line in a number of galaxy clusters, the\nAndromeda galaxy (M31) and the Milky Way (MW) center can be well accounted for\nby a scenario in which dark matter decays to axion-like particles (ALPs) and\nsubsequently convert to 3.5 keV photons in magnetic fields of galaxy clusters\nor galaxies. We propose to test this hypothesis by performing X-ray\npolarization measurements. Since ALPs can only couple to photons with\npolarization orientation parallel to magnetic field, we can confirm or reject\nthis model by measuring the polarization of 3.5 keV line and comparing it to\nthe orientation of magnetic field. We discuss luminosity and polarization\nmeasurements for both galaxy cluster and spiral galaxy, and provide a general\nrelation between polarization and galaxy inclination angle. This effect is\nmarginally detectable with X-ray polarimetry detectors currently under\ndevelopment, such as the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP), the\nImaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry\nExplorer (XIPE). The sensitivity can be further improved in the future with\ndetectors of larger effective area or better energy resolutions.\n", "  Charge transfer in a tunnel junction is studied under dc and ac voltage bias\nusing quantum shot noise. Under dc voltage bias $V$, spectral density of noise\nmeasured within a very large bandwidth enables to deduce the current-current\ncorrelator in the time domain by Fourier transform. This correlator exhibits\nregular oscillations proving that electrons try to cross the junction\nregularly, every $h/eV$. Using harmonic and bi-harmonic ac voltage bias, we\nthen show that quasiparticles excitations can be transferred through the\njunction in a controlled way. By measuring the reduction of the excess shot\nnoise, we are able to determine the number of electron-hole pairs surrounding\nthe injected electrons and demonstrate that bi-harmonic voltage pulses realize\nan on-demand electron source with a very small admixture of electron-hole\npairs.\n", "  The paper discusses the optimal conguration of one or more ring lasers to be\nused for measuring the general relativistic effects of the rotation of the\nearth, as manifested on the surface of the planet. The analysis is focused on\ndevices having their normal vector lying in the meridian plane. The crucial\nrole of the evaluation of the angles is evidenced. Special attention is paid to\nthe orientation at the maximum signal, minimizing the sensitivity to the\norientation uncertainty. The use of rings at different latitudes is mentioned\nand the problem of the non-sfericity of the earth is commented.\n", "  We explore the dynamics of a graphene nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a\nreference oscillator. Circular graphene drums are forced into self-oscillation,\nat a frequency fosc, by means of photothermal feedback induced by illuminating\nthe drum with a continuous-wave red laser beam. Synchronization to a reference\nsignal, at a frequency fsync, is achieved by shining a power-modulated blue\nlaser onto the structure. We investigate two regimes of synchronization as a\nfunction of both detuning and signal strength for direct (fsync = fosc) and\nparametric locking (fsync = 2fosc). We detect a regime of phase resonance,\nwhere the phase of the oscillator behaves as an underdamped second-order\nsystem, with the natural frequency of the phase resonance showing a clear\npower-law dependence on the locking signal strength. The phase resonance is\nqualitatively reproduced using a forced van der Pol-Duffing-Mathieu equation.\n", "  Reverse Monte Carlo modeling of liquid water, based on one neutron and one\nX-ray diffraction data set, applying also the most popular interatomic\npotential for water, SPC/E, has been performed. The strictly rigid geometry of\nSPC/E water molecules had to be loosened somewhat, in order to be able to\nproduce a good fit to both sets of experimental data. In the final particle\nconfigurations, regularly shaped water molecules and straight hydrogen bonding\nangles were found to be consistent with diffraction results. It has been\ndemonstrated that explicit use of interatomic potentials in RMC has a role to\nplay in future structural modeling of water and aqueous solutions.\n", "  Given a semi-Riemannian manifold, we give necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor a Riemannian submanifold of arbitrary co-dimension to be umbilical along\nnormal directions. We do that by using the so-called \\emph{total shear tensor},\ni.e., the trace-free part of the second fundamental form. We define the\n\\emph{shear space} and the \\emph{umbilical space} as the spaces generated by\nthe total shear tensor and by the umbilical vector fields, respectively. We\nshow that the sum of their dimensions must equal the co-dimension.\n", "  We study three distinct types of planar, spherically symmetric and localized\nstructures, one of them having non-topological behavior and the two others\nbeing of topological nature. The non-topological structures have energy density\nlocalized in a compact region in the plane, but are unstable against\nspherically symmetric fluctuations. The topological structures are stable and\nbehave as vortices and skyrmions at larger distances, but they engender\ninteresting compact behavior as one approaches their inner cores. They are\nsemi-compact skyrmion-like spin textures generated from models that allow to\ncontrol the internal behavior of such topological structures.\n", "  We adapt the Coupled Cluster Method to solid state strongly correlated\nlattice Hamiltonians extending the Coupled Cluster linear response method to\nthe calculation of electronic spectra and obtaining the space-time Fourier\ntransforms of generic Green's functions. We apply our method to the $MnO_2$\nplane with orbital and magnetic ordering, to interpret electron energy loss\nexperimental data, and to the Hubbard model, where we get insight into a\npossible pairing mechanism.\n", "  A key aim in space weather research is to be able to use remote-sensing\nobservations of the solar atmosphere to extend the lead time of predicting the\ngeoeffectiveness of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In order to achieve this,\nthe magnetic structure of the CME as it leaves the Sun must be known. In this\narticle we address this issue by developing a method to determine the intrinsic\nflux rope type of a CME solely from solar disk observations. We use several\nwell known proxies for the magnetic helicity sign, the axis orientation, and\nthe axial magnetic field direction to predict the magnetic structure of the\ninterplanetary flux rope. We present two case studies: the 2 June 2011 and the\n14 June 2012 CMEs. Both of these events erupted from an active region and,\ndespite having clear in situ counterparts, their eruption characteristics were\nrelatively complex. The first event was associated with an active region\nfilament that erupted in two stages, while for the other event the eruption\noriginated from a relatively high coronal altitude and the source region did\nnot feature the presence of a filament. Our magnetic helicity sign proxies\ninclude the analysis of magnetic tongues, soft X-ray and/or EUV sigmoids,\ncoronal arcade skew, filament emission and absorption threads, and filament\nrotation. Since the inclination of the post-eruption arcades was not clear, we\nuse the tilt of the polarity inversion line to determine the flux rope axis\norientation, and coronal dimmings to determine the flux rope footpoints and,\ntherefore, the direction of the axial magnetic field. The comparison of the\nestimated intrinsic flux rope structure to in situ observations at the\nLagrangian point L1 indicated a good agreement with the predictions. Our\nresults highlight the flux rope type determination techniques that are\nparticularly useful for active region eruptions, where most geoeffective CMEs\noriginate.\n", "  Using a simple model of self-propelled particle, the effective shear\nviscosity of a dilute, spatially homogeneous suspension of active particles is\nstudied. We use formulation of non-linear Fokker-Planck equation to drive a\nkinetic description, including the effect of external flow field, rotary\ndiffusion, and particle-particle hydrodynamic interactions in two dimensions.\nAnalytical expressions are obtained for the stress tensor at small Peclet\nnumbers, in a simple shear flow, up to second order of volume fraction of the\nswimmers, which shows the explicit dependence of shear viscosity on the details\nof the swimming mechanism.\n", "  The diffusion equation is a universal and standard textbook model for partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs). In this work, we revisit its solutions, seeking,\nin particular, self-similar profiles. This problem connects to the classical\ntheory of special functions and, more specifically, to the Hermite as well as\nthe Kummer hypergeometric functions. Reconstructing the solution of the\noriginal diffusion model from novel self-similar solutions of the associated\nself-similar PDE, we infer that the $t^{-1/2}$ decay law of the diffusion\namplitude is {\\it not necessary}. In particular, it is possible to engineer\nsetups of {\\it both} the Cauchy problem and the initial-boundary value problem\nin which the solution decays at a {\\it different rate}. Nevertheless, we\nobserve that the $t^{-1/2}$ rate corresponds to the dominant decay mode among\nintegrable initial data, i.e., ones corresponding to finite mass. Hence, unless\nthe projection to such a mode is eliminated, generically this decay will be the\nslowest one observed. In initial-boundary value problems, an additional issue\nthat arises is whether the boundary data are \\textit{consonant} with the\ninitial data; namely, whether the boundary data agree at all times with the\nsolution of the Cauchy problem associated with the same initial data, when this\nsolution is evaluated at the boundary of the domain. In that case, the power\nlaw dictated by the solution of the Cauchy problem will be selected. On the\nother hand, in the non-consonant cases a decomposition of the problem into a\nself-similar and a non-self-similar one is seen to be beneficial in obtaining a\nsystematic understanding of the resulting solution.\n", "  Polystyrene-based phosphorene nanocomposites were prepared by a solvent\nblending procedure allowing the embedding of black phosphorus (BP) nanoflakes\nin the polymer matrix. Raman spectroscopy, X Ray Diffraction and TEM microscopy\nwere employed to characterize the structural and the morphological\ncharacteristics of the achieved hybrids, with the aim to evaluate the\ndispersion level of black phosphorus layers. TGA, DSC analysis as well as\nthermal oxidation and photo-degradation techniques were employed to investigate\nthe thermal- and the photo-stability of the samples. The collected results\nevidenced better thermal and photostability of both polymer matrix and\ndispersed layered phosphorus, suggesting really interesting polymer-nanofiller\nsynergic effects ascribable to the presence and the good dispersion of the\n2D-nanomaterial.\n", "  An electrified visco-capillary jet shows different dynamic behavior, such as\ncone forming, breakage into droplets, whipping and coiling, depending on the\nconsidered parameter regime. The whipping instability that is of fundamental\nimportance for electrospinning has been approached by means of stability\nanalysis in previous papers. In this work we alternatively propose a model\nframework in which the instability can be computed straightforwardly as the\nstable stationary solution of an asymptotic Cosserat rod description. For this\npurpose, we adopt a procedure by Ribe (Proc. Roy. Soc. Lond. A, 2004)\ndescribing the jet dynamics with respect to a frame rotating with the a priori\nunknown whipping frequency that itself becomes part of the solution. The rod\nmodel allows for stretching, bending and torsion, taking into account inertia,\nviscosity, surface tension, electric field and air drag. For the resulting\nparametric boundary value problem of ordinary differential equations we present\na continuation-collocation method. On top of an implicit Runge-Kutta scheme of\nfifth order, our developed continuation procedure makes the efficient and\nrobust simulation and navigation through a high-dimensional parameter space\npossible. Despite the simplicity of the employed electric force model the\nnumerical results are convincing, the whipping effect is qualitatively well\ncharacterized.\n", "  Chitosan, a natural, cationic polysaccharide, may be a hydrocolloid strategic\nto formulate acidic food products, as it can act as both bio-functional and\ntechnofunctional constituent. Typically, acetic acid is used to disperse\nchitosan in aqueous media, but the use of this acid is limited in food\nformulations due to its flavor. In this study, chitosan was firstly dispersed\n(0.1% m/V) in lactic acid aqueous solutions (pH 3.0, 3.5 or 4.0), and then\nevaluated regarding its thickener and emulsion stabilizer properties. O/W\nemulsions were prepared and characterized in terms of rheological properties,\ndroplets average diameters and droplets $\\zeta$-potential. Emulsions containing\nchitosan were 3 times more viscous than controls without chitosan, and\npresented storage modulus ($G'$) higher than loss modulus ($G''$). Furthermore,\nthey displayed two different populations of droplets (average diameters of 44\nand 365 nm) and positive $\\zeta$-potential values (+50 mV). Droplets average\ndiameters and $\\zeta$-potential did not present significant changes ($p$ >\n0.05) after storage at 25 $^{\\circ}$C during 7 days. This study showed that i)\nfood organic acids other than acetic acid can be used to disperse chitosan for\ntechnological purposes, and ii) chitosan dispersed at very low concentrations\n(0.1% m/V) had relevant effects on rheological and physicochemical aspects of\nfood-grade emulsions.\n", "  The Leidenfrost effect describes liquid drops under gravity levitating on a\nvapour cushion, which is sourced at the liquid-vapour interface from\nevaporation caused by the hot substrate below. It has been experimentally\nobserved that when two or more Leidenfrost drops approach one another, there is\na short-range repulsion that can prevent coalescence. In the present work, we\ninvestigate the coalescence process of initially momentum-less Leidenfrost\ndrops. This is carried out by numerically simulating two-dimensional systems of\nliquid and vapour using the recently developed dynamic van der Waals theory, in\nwhich the two-phase hydrodynamics is coupled with liquid-vapour transition. It\nis confirmed that Leidenfrost drops experience a remarkably strong short-range\nrepulsion, due to a build-up of vapour in the common space under both drops.\nThis resistive force scales in a similar manner to the pressure-sourced force\nfrom the vapour layer under a single drop, in concurrence with intuition, with\ngood agreement seen in the simulation results. A threshold drop size therefore\nexists in order for an applied horizontal acceleration to overcome the\nrepulsion, while only very small drops are predicted to experience significant\nviscous effects.\n", "  Hidden photon and axion-like dark matter may be detected using spherical\nreflective surfaces such as dish antenna setups converting some of the dark\nmatter particles into photons and concentrating them on a detector. These\nsetups may be used to perform directional searches measuring the dark matter\nmomentum distribution. We briefly review the photon distribution one expects to\ndetect with such an antenna and directional resolution in ray approximation.\nFurthermore we consider the regime $m_{DM} \\lesssim (R_{sp}\\,v_{DM})^{-1}$\nwhere this approximation does not hold anymore due to the photon wavelength\nexceeding the expected distribution widths. We discuss how this affects the\nexpected distributions and experimental implications.\n", "  We report a lattice calculation of nucleon forward matrix elements on a $48^3\n\\times 96$ lattice at the physical pion mass and a spatial size of 5.5 fm. The\n$2+1$ flavor dynamical fermion configurations are generated with domain-wall\nfermions (DWF) and the overlap fermions are adopted for the valence quarks. The\nisovector $g_A^3$ and $g_S^3$, and the connected insertion part of $g_S^0$ are\nreported for three source-sink separations. With local current, we obtain\n$g_A^3 = 1.18(4)$ from a two-state fit. For the quark momentum fraction\n$\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d}$, we have included smaller lattices (i.e. $24^3 \\times\n64$ and $32^3 \\times 64$ lattice with pion mass at 330 and 290 MeV\nrespectively) for a fit which includes partially quenched cases as well as\nfinite volume and continuum corrections. A global fit with perturbative\nrenormalization gives $\\langle x \\rangle_{u-d} (\\overline{MS},\\, \\mu = 2\\, {\\rm\nGeV}) = 0.170(14)$.\n  We made a cost comparison of calculating the nucleon matrix elements with\nthose from the twisted mass fermion on similar sized lattice at the physical\npion point and the domain-wall fermion calculation on the same DWF lattice. We\nalso compare cost with the clover fermion calculation on similar sized lattice\nat about the same quark mass. The comparison shows that with several\nimprovements, such as many-to-all correlator with grid source and low-mode\nsubstitution in the connected insertion and low-mode average in the quark loop\ncan make the overlap as efficient as the twisted-mass and clover fermions in\ncalculating the three-point functions. It is more efficient than the DWF. When\nthe multi-mass feature is invoked, the overlap can be more efficient in\nreaching the same precision than the single mass comparison made so far.\n", "  Saturn's rings are rock-poor, containing 90%-95% ice by mass. As a group,\nSaturn's moons interior to and including Tethys are also about 90% ice. Tethys\nitself contains <6% rock by mass, in contrast to its similar-mass outer\nneighbor Dione, which contains >40% rock. Here we simulate the evolution of a\nmassive primordial ice-rich ring and the production of satellites as ring\nmaterial spreads beyond the Roche limit. We describe the Roche-interior ring\nwith an analytic model, and use an N-body code to describe material beyond the\nRoche limit. We track the accretion and interactions of spawned satellites,\nincluding tidal interaction with the planet, assuming a tidal dissipation\nfactor for Saturn of $Q~10^4$. We find that ring torques and capture of moons\ninto mutual resonances produce a system of ice-rich inner moons that extends\noutward to approximately Tethys's orbit in $10^9$ years, even with relatively\nslow orbital expansion due to tides. The resulting mass and semimajor axis\ndistribution of spawned moons resembles that of Mimas, Enceladus, and Tethys.\nWe estimate the mass of rock delivered to the moons by external cometary\nimpactors during a late heavy bombardment. We find that the inner moons receive\na mass in rock comparable to their current total rock content, while Dione and\nRhea receive an order-of-magnitude less rock than their current rock content.\nThis suggests that external ontamination may have been the primary source of\nrock in the inner moons, and that Dione and Rhea formed from much more\nrock-rich source material. Reproducing the distribution of rock among the\ncurrent inner moons is challenging, and appears to require large impactors\nstochasticity and/or the presence of some rock in the initial ring.\n", "  Inspired by the synchronized beating of cilia, we show that the collective\ndynamics of hair-like fibers in a meniscus during fast drainage enables their\nself-organization into multiple topologies including complex shape inversions.\nBy draining liquid from triangular-base hair bundles, we demonstrate their\ntransformations into concave hexagons, rounded triangles, circles and inverted\ntriangles. These topologically distinct shapes are quenched collective mode\nshapes of the beating hair each corresponding to specific drainage rates of the\nliquid, and cyclic shape re-transformations can be simply stimulated by\nrepeated immersion and drainage. The various topologies correspond to multiple\nelastocapillary equilibria. Complex cellular materials with varying pore size\nand density can be obtained by changing the drain rates from hair assemblies.\nDue to its simple implementation and energy efficiency, these shape\ntransformations can have applications ranging from three-dimensional\nlithography to smart multi-functional surfaces.\n", "  By combining 5d transition-metal oxides showing pronounced spin-orbit\ninteractions and oxide-based heterostructures, we propose rutile-based\nIrO2/TiO2 superlattices as promising candidates for unconventional electronic\nproperties. By means of density-functional-theory simulations complemented with\nHubbard-like corrections, we focus on the evolution of the electronic structure\nas a function of the IrO2 layer thickness and predict the heterostructures to\nexhibit a thickness-controlled metal-to-insulator transition, crucially related\nto the connectivity among IrO6 octahedra. The subtle interplay between electron\ncorrelation and spin-orbit coupling leads to an almost pure Jeff = 1/2\nspin-orbit insulating state at the level of atomically-thin IrO2 monolayer with\nalmost isolated IrO6 octahedra, leading to a predicted emerging state awaiting\nfor experimental confirmation.\n", "  We extend the Nakajima-Zwanzig projection operator technique to the\ndetermination of multitime correlation functions of open quantum systems. The\ncorrelation functions are expressed in terms of certain multitime homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous memory kernels for which suitable equations of motion are\nderived. We show that under the condition of finite memory times these\nequations can be used to determine the memory kernels by employing an exact\nstochastic unraveling of the full system-environment dynamics. The approach\nthus allows to combine exact stochastic methods, feasible for short times, with\nlong-time master equation simulations. The applicability of the method is\ndemonstrated by numerical simulations of 2D-spectra for a donor-acceptor model,\nand by comparison of the results with those obtained from the reduced hierarchy\nequations of motion. We further show that the formalism is also applicable to\nthe time evolution of a periodically driven two-level system initially in\nequilibrium with its environment.\n", "  We present observational signatures of solar cycle 25 onset. Those signatures\nare visibly following a migratory path from high to low latitudes. They had\nstarting points that are asymmetrically offset in each hemisphere at times that\nare 21-22 years after the corresponding, same polarity, activity bands of solar\ncycle 23 started their migration. Those bands define the so-called \"extended\nsolar cycle.\" The four magnetic bands currently present in the system are\napproaching a mutually cancelling configuration, and solar minimum conditions\nare imminent. Further, using a tuned analysis of the daily band latitude-time\ndiagnostics, we are able to utilize the longitudinal wave number (m=1)\nvariation in the data to more clearly reveal the presence of the solar cycle 25\nbands. This clarification illustrates that prevalently active longitudes\n(different in each hemisphere) exist at mid-latitudes presently, lasting many\nsolar rotations, that can be used for detailed study over the next several\nyears with instruments like the Spectrograph on IRIS, the Spectropolarimeter on\nHinode, and, when they come online, similar instruments on the Daniel K. Inouye\nSolar Telescope (DKIST) as we watch those bands evolve following the\ncancellation of the solar cycle 24 activity bands at the equator late in 2019.\n", "  Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is universally regarded as one of the most\nimportant tools in chemical and bio-medical research. However, sensitivity\nlimitations typically restrict imaging resolution to length scales greater than\n10 \\mu m. Here we bring quantum control to the detection of chemical systems to\ndemonstrate high resolution electron spin imaging using the quantum properties\nof an array of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond. Our quantum magnetic\nresonance microscope selectively images electronic spin species by precisely\ntuning a magnetic field to bring the quantum probes into resonance with the\nexternal target spins. This provides diffraction limited spatial resolution of\nthe target spin species over a field of view of ~50x50 \\mu m^2. We demonstrate\nimaging and spectroscopy on aqueous Cu2+ ions over microscopic volumes (0.025\n\\mu m^3), with detection sensitivity at resonance of 104 spins/voxel, ~100\nzeptomol (10^-19 mol). The ability to image, perform spectroscopy and\ndynamically monitor spin-dependent redox reactions and transition metal\nbiochemistry at these scales opens up a new realm of nanoscopic electron spin\nresonance and zepto-chemistry in the physical and life sciences.\n", "  Data analytics (such as association rule mining and decision tree mining) can\ndiscover useful statistical knowledge from a big data set. But protecting the\nprivacy of the data provider and the data user in the process of analytics is a\nserious issue. Usually, the privacy of both parties cannot be fully protected\nsimultaneously by a classical algorithm. In this paper, we present a quantum\nprotocol for data mining that can much better protect privacy than the known\nclassical algorithms: (1) if both the data provider and the data user are\nhonest, the data user can know nothing about the database except the\nstatistical results, and the data provider can get nearly no information about\nthe results mined by the data user; (2) if the data user is dishonest and tries\nto disclose private information of the other, she/he will be detected with a\nhigh probability; (3) if the data provider tries to disclose the privacy of the\ndata user, she/he cannot get any useful information since the data user hides\nhis privacy among noises.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) crystals, such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and\ntransitional metal dichalcogenides, have attracted tremendous amount of\nattention over the past decade due to their extraordinary thermal, electrical\nand optical properties, making them promising nano-materials for the\nnext-generation electronic systems. A large number of heterostructures have\nbeen fabricated by stacking of various 2D materials to achieve different\nfunctionalities. In this work, we simulate the electron transport properties of\na three-terminal multilayer heterostructure made from graphene nanoribbons\nvertically sandwiching a boron nitride tunneling barrier. To investigate the\neffects of the unavoidable misalignment in experiments, we introduce a tunable\nangular misorientation between 2D layers to the modeled system. Current-Voltage\n(I-V) characteristics of the device exhibit multiple NDR peaks originating from\ndistinct mechanisms. A unique NDR mechanism arising from the lattice mismatch\nis captured and it depends on both the twisting angle and voltage bias.\nAnalytical expressions for the positions of the resonant peaks observed in I-V\ncharacteristic are developed. To capture the slight degradation of PVR ratios\nobserved in experiments when temperature increases from 2K to 300K,\nelectron-photon scattering decoherence has been added to the simulation,\nindicating a good agreement with experiment works as well as a robust\npreservation of resonant tunneling feature.\n", "  We identify the \"organization\" of a human social group as the communication\nnetwork(s) within that group. We then introduce three theoretical approaches to\nanalyzing what determines the structures of human organizations. All three\napproaches adopt a group-selection perspective, so that the group's network\nstructure is (approximately) optimal, given the information-processing\nlimitations of agents within the social group, and the exogenous welfare\nfunction of the overall group. In the first approach we use a new sub-field of\ntelecommunications theory called network coding, and focus on a welfare\nfunction that involves the ability of the organization to convey information\namong the agents. In the second approach we focus on a scenario where agents\nwithin the organization must allocate their future communication resources when\nthe state of the future environment is uncertain. We show how this formulation\ncan be solved with a linear program. In the third approach, we introduce an\ninformation synthesis problem in which agents within an organization receive\ninformation from various sources and must decide how to transform such\ninformation and transmit the results to other agents in the organization. We\npropose leveraging the computational power of neural networks to solve such\nproblems. These three approaches formalize and synthesize work in fields\nincluding anthropology, archeology, economics and psychology that deal with\norganization structure, theory of the firm, span of control and cognitive\nlimits on communication.\n", "  The effect of the quantum feedback on the tightness of the variance-based\nuncertainty, the possibility of using quantum feedback to prepare the state\nwith a better tightness, and the relationship between the tightness of the\nuncertainty and the mixedness of the system are studied. It is found that the\ntightness of Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty (SUR) relation has a strict\nliner relationship with the mixedness of the system. As for the Robertson\nuncertainty relation (RUR), we find that the tightness can be enhanced by\ntuning the feedback at the beginning of the evolution. In addition, we deduce\nthat the tightness of RUR has an inverse relationship with the mixedness and\nthe relationship turns into a strict linear one when the system reach the\nsteady state.\n", "  The effects of nuclear field and spin-orbit interaction on dense coding and\nswap operation are studied in detail for both the antiferromagnetic (AFM) and\nferromagnetic (FM) coupling cases. The conditions for a valid dense coding and\nunder which swap operation is feasible are given.\n", "  By using the effective non-Markovian measure [H.P. Breuer, E.M. Laine, J.\nPiilo, Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 210401 (2009)], we investigate non-Markovian\ndynamics of a pair of two-level atoms (TLAs) system, each of which interacting\nwith a local reservoir. We show that subsystem dynamics can be controlled by\nmanipulating the coupling between TLAs, temperature and relaxation rate of the\natoms. Moreover, the correlation between non-Markovianity of subsystem and\nentanglement between the subsystem and the structured bath is investigated, the\nresults show that the emergence of non-Markovianity has a negative effect on\nthe entanglement.\n", "  We analyze the left-tail asymptotics of deformed Tracy-Widom distribution\nfunctions describing the fluctuations of the largest eigenvalue in invariant\nrandom matrix ensembles after removing each soft edge eigenvalue independently\nwith probability $1-\\gamma\\in[0,1]$. As $\\gamma$ varies, a transition from\nTracy-Widom statistics ($\\gamma=1$) to classical Weibull statistics\n($\\gamma=0$) was observed in the physics literature by Bohigas, de Carvalho,\nand Pato \\cite{BohigasCP:2009}. We provide a description of this transition by\nrigorously computing the leading-order left-tail asymptotics of the thinned\nGOE, GUE and GSE Tracy-Widom distributions. In this paper, we obtain the\nasymptotic behavior in the non-oscillatory region with $\\gamma\\in[0,1)$ fixed\n(for the GOE, GUE, and GSE distributions) and $\\gamma\\uparrow 1$ at a\ncontrolled rate (for the GUE distribution). This is the first step in an\nongoing program to completely describe the transition between Tracy-Widom and\nWeibull statistics. As a corollary to our results, we obtain a new\ntotal-integral formula involving the Ablowitz-Segur solution to the second\nPainlev\\'e equation.\n", "  Spin-singlet orders are studied for the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model\nwith spin $S$>1/2 on a breathing pyrochlore lattice, where tetrahedron units\nare weakly coupled and exchange constants have two values $0<J' \\ll J$. The\nground state has a thermodynamic degeneracy at $J'$=0, and I have studied\nlattice symmetry breaking associated to lifting this degeneracy. Third-order\nperturbation in $J'$ for general spin $S$ shows that the effective Hamiltonian\nhas a form of three-tetrahedron interactions of pseudospins $\\tau$, which is\nidentical to that previously derived for $S$=1/2, and I have calculated their\nmatrix elements for general $S$. For this effective Hamiltonian, I have\nobtained its mean-field ground state and investigated the possibility of\nlattice symmetry breaking for the cases of $S$=3/2 and $1$. In contrast to the\n$S$=1/2 case,$\\tau$'s response to conjugate field has a $Z_3$ anisotropy in its\ninternal space, and this stabilizes the mean-field ground state. The mean-field\nground state has a characteristic spatial pattern of spin correlations related\nto the lattice symmetry breaking. Spin structure factor $S(q)$ is calculated\nand found to have symmetry broken parts with amplitudes of the same order as\nthe isotropic part.\n", "  This paper describes a lattice Boltzmann-based binary fluid model for inkjet\nprinting. In this model, a time-dependent driving force is applied to actuate\nthe droplet ejection. As a result, the actuation can be accurately controlled\nby adjusting the intensity and duration of the positive and negative forces, as\nwell as the idle time. The present model was verified by reproducing the actual\nsingle droplet ejection process captured by fast imaging. This model was\nsubsequently used to investigate droplet formation in piezoelectric inkjet\nprinting. It was determined that wettability of the nozzle inner wall and the\nsurface tension of the ink are vital factors controlling the print quality and\nspeed. Increasing the contact angle of the nozzle inner delays the droplet\nbreakup time and reduces the droplet velocity. In contrast, higher surface\ntension values promote earlier droplet breakup and faster drop velocity. These\nresults indicate that the hydrophilic modification of the nozzle inner wall and\nthe choice of inks with high surface tensions will improve printing quality.\n", "  Now creation of big catalogs of galaxies for measurement of baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) is actively conducted. Existing and planned in the near\nfuture surveys are directed on the range of red shifts of z.2. However, some\npopular models of dark energy (DE) give the maximum deviation from \\Lambda CDM\nat z>2 therefore we investigated sensitivity of hypothetical high redshift\nsurveys to the model of DE. We have found that with the increase of the number\ndensity of detected galaxies at z>2 high redshift observations may give better\nconstraints of DE parameters.\n", "  Nonlocality is a key feature of many physical systems since it prevents a\ncatastrophic collapse and a symmetry-breaking azimuthal instability of intense\nwave beams in a bulk self-focusing nonlinear media. This opens up an intriguing\nperspective for stabilization of complex topological structures such as\nhigher-order solitons, vortex rings and vortex ring-on-line complexes. Using\ndirect numerical simulations, we find a class of cylindrically-symmetric $n$-th\norder spatial solitons having the intensity distribution with a central bright\nspot surrounded by $n$ bright rings of varying size. We investigate dynamical\nproperties of these higher-order solitons in a media with thermal nonlocal\nnonlinear response. We show theoretically that a vortex complex of vortex ring\nand vortex line, carrying two independent winding numbers, can be created by\nperturbation of the stable optical vortex soliton in nonlocal nonlinear media.\n", "  The best p-type skutterudites so far are didymium filled, Fe/Co substituted,\nSb-based skutterudites. Substitution at the Sb-sites influences the electronic\nstructure, deforms the Sb4-rings, enhances the scattering of phonons on\nelectrons and impurities and this way reduces the lattice thermal conductivity.\nIn this paper we study structural and transport properties of p-type\nskutterudites with the nominal composition DD0.7Fe2.7Co1.3Sb11.7{Ge/Sn}0.3,\nwhich were prepared by a rather fast reaction-annealing-melting technique. The\nGe-doped sample showed impurities, which did not anneal out completely and even\nwith ZT > 1 the result was not satisfying. However, the single-phase Sn-doped\nsample, DD0.7Fe2.7Co1.3Sb11.8Sn0.2, showed a lower thermal and lattice thermal\nconductivity than the undoped skutterudite leading to a higher ZT=1.3, hitherto\nthe highest ZT for a p-type skutterudite. Annealing at 570 K for 3 days proved\nthe stability of the microstructure. After severe plastic deformation (SPD),\ndue to additionally introduced defects, an enhancement of the electrical\nresistivity was compensated by a significantly lower thermal conductivity and\nthe net effect led to a record high figure of merit: ZT = 1.45 at 850 K for\nDD0.7Fe2.7Co1.3Sb11.8Sn0.2.\n", "  We present a study by computer simulations of a class of complex-valued\nsolutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space,\nwhich, according to Li and Sinai, present a blow-up (singularity) at a finite\ntime. The computer results allow a detailed study of the blow-up mechanism, and\nshow interesting features of the behavior of the solutions near the blow-up\ntime, such as the concentration of energy and enstrophy in a small region\naround a few points of physical space, while outside this region the \"fluid\"\nremains \"quiet\".\n", "  The Markov dynamics is studied of an infinite system of point entities placed\nin $\\mathds{R}^d$, in which the constituents disperse and die, also due to\ncompetition. Assuming that the dispersal and competition kernels are continuous\nand integrable we show that the evolution of states of this model preserves\ntheir sub-Poissonicity, and hence the local self-regulation (suppression of\nclustering) takes place. Upper bounds for the correlation functions of all\norders are also obtained for both long and short dispersals, and for all values\nof the intrinsic mortality rate.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional topology of the galactic distribution when\nprojected onto two-dimensional spherical shells. Using the latest Horizon Run 4\nsimulation data, we construct the genus of the two-dimensional field and\nconsider how this statistic is affected by late-time nonlinear effects --\nprincipally gravitational collapse and redshift space distortion (RSD). We also\nconsider systematic and numerical artifacts such as shot noise, galaxy bias,\nand finite pixel effects. We model the systematics using a Hermite polynomial\nexpansion and perform a comprehensive analysis of known effects on the\ntwo-dimensional genus, with a view toward using the statistic for cosmological\nparameter estimation. We find that the finite pixel effect is dominated by an\namplitude drop and can be made less than $1\\%$ by adopting pixels smaller than\n$1/3$ of the angular smoothing length. Nonlinear gravitational evolution\nintroduces time-dependent coefficients of the zeroth, first, and second Hermite\npolynomials, but the genus amplitude changes by less than $1\\%$ between $z=1$\nand $z=0$ for smoothing scales $R_{\\rm G} > 9 {\\rm Mpc/h}$. Non-zero terms are\nmeasured up to third order in the Hermite polynomial expansion when studying\nRSD. Differences in shapes of the genus curves in real and redshift space are\nsmall when we adopt thick redshift shells, but the amplitude change remains a\nsignificant $\\sim {\\cal O}(10\\%)$ effect. The combined effects of galaxy\nbiasing and shot noise produce systematic effects up to the second Hermite\npolynomial. It is shown that, when sampling, the use of galaxy mass cuts\nsignificantly reduces the effect of shot noise relative to random sampling.\n", "  Gradient reconstruction is a key process for the spatial accuracy and\nrobustness of finite volume method, especially in industrial aerodynamic\napplications in which grid quality affects reconstruction methods\nsignificantly. A novel gradient reconstruction method for cell-centered finite\nvolume scheme is introduced. This method is composed of two successive steps.\nFirst, a vertex-based weighted-least-squares procedure is implemented to\ncalculate vertex gradients, and then the cell-centered gradients are calculated\nby an arithmetic averaging procedure. By using these two procedures, extended\nstencils are implemented in the calculations, and the accuracy of gradient\nreconstruction is improved by the weighting procedure. In the given test cases,\nthe proposed method is showing improvement on both the accuracy and\nconvergence. Furthermore, the method could be extended to the calculation of\nviscous fluxes.\n", "  This work reports on accurate, high-resolution measurements of the\n$^{25}$Mg($n, \\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg and $^{25}$Mg($n, tot$) cross sections in the\nneutron energy range from thermal to about 300 keV, leading to a significantly\nimproved $^{25}$Mg($n, \\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg parametrization. The relevant\nresonances for $n+^{25}$Mg were characterized from a combined R-matrix analysis\nof the experimental data. This resulted in an unambiguous spin/parity\nassignment of the corresponding excited states in $^{26}$Mg. With this\ninformation experimental upper limits of the reaction rates for\n$^{22}$Ne($\\alpha, n$)$^{25}$Mg and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha, \\gamma$)$^{26}$Mg were\nestablished, potentially leading to a significantly higher ($\\alpha,\nn$)/($\\alpha, \\gamma$) ratio than previously evaluated. The impact of these\nresults have been studied for stellar models in the mass range 2 to 25\n$M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  The relationship between discontinuous and continuous stochastic processes in\nHilbert space is investigated. It is shown that for any continuos process there\nis a parent discontinuous process, that becomes the continuous one in the\nproper infinite frequency limit. From the point of view of solving the quantum\nmeasurement problem, what really matters is the choice of the set of operators\nwhose value distributions are made sharp. In particular, the key role of\nposition sharping is emphasized.\n", "  A data center (DC) is one of the main building blocks of modern information\ntechnology. Any intra DC network should strive to achieve high throughput,\nwhile continuing to be flexible in responding to changing traffic patterns.\nOptical wireless communication links on top of the fiber/wire infrastructure\ncould offer flexible and dynamic reconfiguration of the network. In this paper\nwe present the design of an optical wireless communication orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) receiver with detector array. The proposed receiver is described\nin detail, a numerical example is given, and alternate options for its\nconstruction are explored. For a given set of parameters we found that a three\nring detector with optimized ring area is comparable to seven ring evenly\nspaced detector.\n", "  We have examined the origin of the electronic structure changes as a function\nof the number of layers in transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$, where\nM=Mo,W and X=S,Se and Te). The belief has been that both geometric confinement\neffects as well as interlayer interactions play an important role in\ndetermining the electronic structure of transition metal dichalcogenide layers\nas the thickness is varied. By carrying out a mapping onto a tight binding\nmodel, we show that the evolution in the electronic structure with thickness is\ndetermined by interlayer interactions with geometric confinement effects\nplaying almost no role.\n", "  The variational principle for stars with a phase transition has been\ninvestigated. The term outside the integral in the expression for the second\nvariation of the total energy of a star is shown to be obtained by passage to\nthe limit from the integration over the region of mixed states in the star. The\nform of the trial functions ensuring this passage has been found. All of the\nresults have been generalized to the case where general relativity is\napplicable. The known criteria for the dynamical stability of a star when a new\nphase appears at its center are shown to follow automatically from the\nvariational principle. Numerical calculations of hydrostatically equilibrium\nmodels for hybrid stars with a phase transition have been performed. The form\nof the trial functions for the second variation of the total energy of a star\nthat describes almost exactly the stability boundaries of such stellar models\nis proposed.\n", "  An exact calculation of CaI $\\lambda 6439.075$A absorption profiles in the\nspectra of optical stars in low-mass X-ray binary systems with black holes (BH\nLMXBs) is carried out. We show that the approximation of a real Roche lobe\nfilling star as disk with uniform local line profile and linear limb darkening\nlaw leads to overestimation of projected equatorial rotational velocity\n$V_{rot} \\sin i$ and accordingly, underestimation of mass ratio $q=M_x/M_v$.\nRefined value of $q$ does not affect the mass of a black hole, but the mass of\nan optical star has shrunk $\\sim 1.5$ times. We present refined components\nmasses in low-mass X-ray binaries with black holes. Companion masses in BH\nLMXBs are found in the mass range 0.1 - 1.6 $M_{\\odot}$ with the peak at $M_v\n\\simeq 0.35 M_{\\odot}$. This finding poses additional problem for the standard\nevolutionary scenarios of BH LMXBs formation with a common envelope phase (CE).\nWe also discuss the implications of these masses into the evolutionary history\nof the binary.\n", "  The interaction of solidification fronts with objects such as particles,\ndroplets, cells, or bubbles is a phenomenon with many natural and technological\noccurrences. For an object facing the front, it may yield various fates, from\ntrapping to rejection, with large implications regarding the solidification\npattern. However, whereas most situations involve multiple particles\ninteracting with each other and the front, attention has focused almost\nexclusively on the interaction of a single, isolated object with the front.\nHere we address experimentally the interaction of multiple particles with a\nsolidification front by performing solidification experiments of a monodisperse\nparticle suspension in a Hele-Shaw cell, with precise control of growth\nconditions and real-time visualization. We evidence the growth of a particle\nlayer ahead of the front at a close-packing volume fraction and we document its\nsteady state value at various solidification velocities. We then extend single\nparticle models to the situation of multiple particles by taking into account\nthe additional force induced on an entering particle by viscous friction in the\ncompacted particle layer. By a force balance model, this provides an indirect\nmeasure of the repelling mean thermomolecular pressure over a particle entering\nthe front. The presence of multiple particles is found to increase it following\na reduction of the thickness of the thin liquid film that separates particles\nand front. We anticipate the findings reported here to provide a relevant basis\nto understand many complex solidification situations in geophysics,\nengineering, biology, or food engineering, where multiple objects interact with\nthe front and control the resulting solidification patterns.\n", "  In the present paper we introduce a full and closed system of atomic kinetic\nequations on fractions of atomic energy levels taking into account the effect\nof the plasma ions electric microfield mixing dynamics. The system of equations\nthat we present is deduced from a full quantum multi-atomic states density\nmatrix master equation. The analytical derivation of this atomic kinetic system\nof equations is based on the introduction of a new hierarchy chain of equations\ninvolving a new set of statistical atomic variables. The final system of atomic\nkinetic equations is obtained by introducing relation de fermeture to truncate\nthe hierarchy chain of equations. We show that the final system of equations\ncontains a new plasma ions electric microfield dependent atomic rates related\nto the process of mixing dynamics of atomic energy states. The analytical\nexpression of this rate is given in this paper. We discuss the importance of\nthe present analysis in view of the radiation emission originating from dense\nplasmas created by the interaction of the X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) with\nsolid density matter.\n", "  This mini review aims to outline the main experimental and theoretical\nresults related with the search for a new light vector boson proposed as a\nsolution of the muon $g-2$ anomaly. Additionally, I consider a model with\ninfinite number of light vector bosons which can explain the anomaly, while\nstill remaining consistent with current experimental bounds.\n", "  A summary of the prospects for top-quark physics at the High Luminosity LHC.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the localized nonlinear matter wave in spin-1\nBose-Einstein condensates with trapping potentials and nonlinearities dependent\non time and space. We solve the three coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equation by\nsimilarity transformation and obtain two families of exact matter wave\nsolutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and Mathieu equation. The\nlocalized states of the spinor matter wave describe the dynamics of vector\nbreathing solitons, moving breathing solitons, quasibreathing solitons and\nresonant solitons. The results of stability show that one order vector\nbreathing solitons, quasibreathing solitons, resonant solitons, and the moving\nbreathing solitons \\psi_{\\pm1} are all stable but the moving breathing solitons\n\\psi_0 is unstable. We also present the experimental parameters to realize\nthese phenomena in the future experiments.\n", "  We study cosmology in scalar-tensor (Bergmann Wagoner) gravity, restricting\nthe coupling function, ${\\omega}({\\phi})$ to be constant. Rather than specify\nthe form of the cosmological function, ${\\lambda}({\\phi})$, the scalar field is\nmodelled as a function which decays to its present value ${\\phi}=1$. Solutions\nof the field equations are found for which ${\\lambda}({\\phi})$ evolves from a\nlarge value (approximately 1) near the singularity to a small, non-zero value\nat later times, avoiding the problem of pre-inflationary collapse in standard\ngeneral relativistic cosmology. Interpreting the model within the framework of\nBrans-Dicke theory with a scalar potential, we find that for suitable initial\nconditions, the reconstructed potential at late times for flat, open and closed\nuniverses is well described by a Higgs-like Mexican hat potential, quartic in\n${\\phi}$, though this was not built in to the initial assumptions.\n", "  Compton scattering is the nonresonant inelastic scattering of an x-ray photon\nby an electron and has been used to probe the electron momentum distribution in\ngas-phase and condensed-matter samples. In the low x-ray intensity regime,\nCompton scattering from atoms dominantly comes from bound electrons in neutral\natoms, neglecting contributions from bound electrons in ions and free (ionized)\nelectrons. In contrast, in the high x-ray intensity regime, the sample\nexperiences severe ionization via x-ray multiphoton multiple ionization\ndynamics. Thus, it becomes necessary to take into account all the contributions\nto the Compton scattering signal when atoms are exposed to high-intensity x-ray\npulses provided by x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). In this paper, we\ninvestigate the Compton spectra of atoms at high x-ray intensity, using an\nextension of the integrated x-ray atomic physics toolkit, \\textsc{xatom}. As\nthe x-ray fluence increases, there is a significant contribution from ionized\nelectrons to the Compton spectra, which gives rise to strong deviations from\nthe Compton spectra of neutral atoms. The present study provides not only\nunderstanding of the fundamental XFEL--matter interaction but also crucial\ninformation for single-particle imaging experiments, where Compton scattering\nis no longer negligible.\n", "  The curvature and twisting of spacetime rotate the angle of polarization and\nimprint orbital angular momentum to photons emitted by the accretion disk near\nrotating black holes. Considering polarization and orbital angular momentum as\ntwo degrees of freedom of single-photons that can encode quantum information,\nwe emphasize that the particular shape of spacetime around rotating black holes\nimplements quantum gates and simple quantum circuits. Consequently, we\ndemonstrate the implementation of some elementary quantum gates, like Hadamard\nor C-NOT, and simple quantum circuits, like Bell states, with photons in the\npresence of spinning black holes. Detection and measurement of quantum\ninformation encoded in photons emitted in the accretion disk around rotating\nblack holes may be performed by actual quantum information technology.\n", "  We present the results of a study of different statistical methods currently\nused in the literature to analyse the (micro)variability of active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) from ground-based optical observations. In particular, we focus\non the comparison between the results obtained by applying the so-called C and\nF statistics, which are based on the ratio of standard deviations and\nvariances, respectively. The motivation for this is that the implementation of\nthese methods leads to different and contradictory results, making the\nvariability classification of the light curves of a certain source dependent on\nthe statistics implemented.\n  For this purpose, we re-analyse the results on an AGN sample observed along\nseveral sessions with the 2.15m \"Jorge Sahade\" telescope (CASLEO), San Juan,\nArgentina. For each AGN we constructed the nightly differential light curves.\nWe thus obtained a total of 78 light curves for 39 AGNs, and we then applied\nthe statistical tests mentioned above, in order to re-classify the variability\nstate of these light curves and in an attempt to find the suitable statistical\nmethodology to study photometric (micro)variations. We conclude that, although\nthe $C$ criterion is not proper a statistical test, it could still be a\nsuitable parameter to detect variability and that its application allows us to\nget more reliable variability results, in contrast with the F test.\n", "  Novel filled skutterudites EpyNi4Sb12-xSnx (Ep = Ba and La) have been\nprepared by arc melting followed by annealing at 250C, 350C and 450C up to 30\ndays in sealed quartz vials. A maximum filling level of y = 0.93 and y = 0.65\nwas achieved for the Ba and La filled skutterudite, respectively. Single-phase\nsamples with the composition Ni4Sb8.2Sn3.8, Ba0.42Ni4Sb8.2Sn3.8 and\nBa0.92Ni4Sb6.7Sn5.3 were employed for measurements of the physical properties\ni.e. temperature dependent electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and\nthermal conductivity.\n  Resistivity data showed a crossover from metallic to semiconducting\nbehaviour. The corresponding gap width was extracted from maxima in the Seebeck\ncoefficient data as a function of temperature. Temperature dependent single\ncrystal X-ray structure analyses (at 100 K, 200 K and 300 K) revealed the\nthermal expansion coefficients, Einstein and Debye temperatures for two\nselected samples Ba0.73Ni4Sb8.1Sn3.9 and Ba0.95Ni4Sb6.1Sn5.9. These data\ncompare well with Debye temperatures from measurements of specific heat (4.4 K\n< T < 200 K).\n  Several mechanical properties were measured and evaluated. Thermal expansion\ncoefficients are 11.8.10-6 K-1 for Ni4Sb8.2Sn3.8 to 13.8.10-6 K-1 for\nBa0.92Ni4Sb6.7Sn5.3. Room temperature Vicker's hardness values (up to a load of\n24.5 mN) vary within the range of 2.6 GPa to 4.7 GPa. Severe plastic\ndeformation (SPD) via high-pressure torsion (HPT) was used to introduce\nnanostructuring. Physical properties before and after HPT were compared,\nshowing no significant effect on the material's thermoelectric behaviour.\n", "  We analyze the locus, together with multiplicities, of \"bad\" conformal field\ntheories in the compactified moduli space of N=(2,2) superconformal field\ntheories in the context of the generalization of the Batyrev mirror\nconstruction using the gauged linear sigma-model. We find this discriminant of\nsingular theories is described beautifully by the GKZ \"A-determinant\" but only\nif we use a noncompact toric Calabi-Yau variety on the A-model side and\nlogarithmic coordinates on the B-model side. The two are related by \"local\"\nmirror symmetry. The corresponding statement for the compact case requires\nchanging multiplicities in the GKZ determinant. We then describe a natural\nstructure for monodromies around components of this discriminant in terms of\nspherical functors. This can be considered a categorification of the GKZ\nA-determinant. Each component of the discriminant is naturally associated with\na category of massless D-branes.\n", "  Gas diffusion electrodes are commonly used in high energy density metal-air\nbatteries for the supply of oxygen. Hydrophobic binder materials ensure the\ncoexistence of gas and liquid phase in the pore network. The phase distribution\nhas a strong influence on transport processes and electrochemical reactions. In\nthis article we present 2D and 3D Rothman-Keller type multiphase\nLattice-Boltzmann models which take into account the heterogeneous wetting\nbehavior of gas diffusion electrodes. The simulations are performed on FIB-SEM\n3D reconstructions of an Ag model electrode for predefined saturation of the\npore space with the liquid phase. The resulting pressure-saturation\ncharacteristics and transport correlations are important input parameters for\nmodeling approaches on the continuum scale and allow for an efficient\ndevelopment of improved gas diffusion electrodes.\n", "  In the ternary system Sr-Cu-Ge, a clathrate type-I phase, Sr8Cu5.3Ge40.7 (a =\n1.06311(3), exists close to the Zintl limit in a small temperature interval.\nSr8Cu5.3Ge40.7 decomposes eutectoidally on cooling at 730{\\deg}C into (Ge),\nSrGe2 and tau1-SrCu2-xGe2+x. Phase equilibria at 700{\\deg}C have been\nestablished for the Ge rich part and are characterized by the appearance of\nonly one ternary compound, tau1-SrCu2-xGe2+x, which crystallizes with the\nThCr2Si2 structure type and forms a homogeneity range up to x=0.4 (a =\n0.42850(4), c = 1.0370(1) nm). Additionally, the extent of the clathrate type-I\nsolid solution Ba8-xSrxCuyGe46-y (5.2 < y < 5.4) has been studied at various\ntemperatures. The clathrate type-I crystal structure (space group ) has been\nproven by X-ray single crystal diffraction on two single crystals with\ncomposition Sr8Cu5.3Ge40.7 (a = 1.06368(2) nm) and Ba4.9Sr3.1Cu5.3Ge40.7 (a =\n1.06748(2) nm) measured at 300, 200 and 100 K. From the temperature dependency\nof the lattice parameters and the atomic displacement parameters, the thermal\nexpansion coefficients, the Debye- and Einstein-temperatures and the speed of\nsound have been determined. From heat capacity measurements of Sr8Cu5.3Ge40.7\nat low temperatures, the Sommerfeld coefficient and the Debye temperature have\nbeen extracted, whereas from a detailed analysis of these data at higher\ntemperatures, Einstein branches of the phonon dispersion relation have been\nderived and compared with those obtained from the atomic displacement\nparameters. Electrical resistivity measurements of Sr8Cu5.3Ge40.7 reveal a\nrather metallic behaviour in the low temperature range (< 300 K).\n", "  In this paper, the problem of compressible flow over a thin airfoil located\nnear the ground is studied. A singular integral equation, also known as Possio\nequation, that relates the pressure jump along the airfoil to its downwash is\nderived. The derivation of the equation utilizes Laplace transform, Fourier\ntransform, method of images, and theory of Mikhlin multipliers. The existence\nand uniqueness of solution to the Possio equation is verified for the steady\nstate case and an approximate solution is obtained. The aerodynamic loads are\nthen calculated based on the approximate solution. Moreover, the divergence\nspeed of a continuum wing structure located near the ground is obtained based\non the derived expressions for the aerodynamic loads.\n", "  We provide a minimal model for an active nematic film in contact with both a\nsolid substrate and a passive isotropic fluid, and explore its dynamics in one\nand two dimensions using a combination of hybrid Lattice Boltzmann simulations\nand analytical calculations. By imposing nematic anchoring at the substrate\nwhile active flows induce a preferred alignment at the interface (\"active\nanchoring\"), we demonstrate that directed fluid flow spontaneously emerges in\ncases where the two anchoring types are opposing. In one dimension, our model\nreduces to an analogue of a loaded elastic column. Here, the transition from a\nstationary to a motile state is akin to the buckling bifurcation, but offers\nthe possilibity to reverse the flow direction for a given set of parameters and\nboundary conditions solely by changing initial conditions. The two-dimensional\nvariant of our model allows for additional tangential instabilities, leading to\nself-assembled propagating surface waves for intermediate activity and for a\ncontinously deforming irregular surface at high activity. Our results might be\nrelevant for designing active microfluidic geometries, but also for\ncurvature-guided self-assembly or switchable diffraction gratings.\n", "  The current manuscript employs the parity and time reversal symmetry in the\nHanbury Brown-Twiss experiment. For this purpose, we develop a general\nscattering matrix framework founded on the concatenation of many individual\ncompounded scattering processes on the setup. In this way, we derive the\ngeneral scattering matrix of a parity and time reversal symmetric Hanbury\nBrown-Twiss experiment (HBT-PT). Within such scattering formulation, we propose\na theoretical framework which provides how to measure the symmetry of the\nsystem through the correlation function of a pair of particles transmitted\nthrough the leads. The correlation function naturally reveal the quantum\nstatistics of both bosons and fermions and demonstrate a very preponderant role\nof PT symmetry on the HBT experiment. We indicate the formation of both quantum\nand classical universal Turing machine depending on controllable parameters of\nthe apparatus.\n", "  A simple backreaction problem in quantum mechanics, the full quantum\nanharmonic oscillator, and quantum parametric resonance are studied using\nRenormalization Group techniques for global asymptotic analysis. In this short\nnote this technique is adapted for the first time to operator problems.\n", "  Due to the space and time dependence of the wave function in the time\ndependent Schroedinger equation, different boundary conditions are possible.\nThe equation is usually solved as an ``initial value problem'', by fixing the\nvalue of the wave function in all space at a given instant. We compare this\nstandard approach to \"source boundary conditions'' that fix the wave at all\ntimes in a given region, in particular at a point in one dimension. In contrast\nto the well-known physical interpretation of the initial-value-problem\napproach, the interpretation of the source approach has remained unclear, since\nit introduces negative energy components, even for ``free motion'', and a\ntime-dependent norm. This work provides physical meaning to the source method\nby finding the link with equivalent initial value problems.\n", "  The analysis of the model quantum clocks proposed by Aharonov et al. [Phys.\nRev. A 57 (1998) 4130 - quant-ph/9709031] requires considering evanescent\ncomponents, previously ignored. We also clarify the meaning of the operational\ntime of arrival distribution which had been investigated.\n", "  Several proposals for a time-of-arrival distribution of ensembles of\nindependent quantum particles subject to an external interaction potential are\ncompared making use of the ``crossing state'' concept. It is shown that only\none of them has the properties expected for a classical distribution in the\nclassical limit. The comparison is illustrated numerically with a collision of\na Gaussian wave packet with an opaque square barrier.\n", "  The Moller operators and the asociated Lippman-Schwinger equations obtained\nfrom different partitionings of the Hamiltonian for a step-like potential\nbarrier are worked out, compared and related.\n", "  Using the concept of crossing state and the formalism of second quantization,\nwe propose a prescription for computing the density of arrivals of particles\nfor multiparticle states, both in the free and the interacting case. The\ndensities thus computed are positive, covariant in time for time independent\nhamiltonians, normalized to the total number of arrivals, and related to the\nflux. We investigate the behaviour of this prescriptions for bosons and\nfermions, finding boson enhancement and fermion depletion of arrivals.\n"]}
