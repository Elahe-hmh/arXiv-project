The driver discussion traditionally separates Malthusian\n(technology driven) from Boserupian (population driven) theories. I present a\nnumerical model of the transitions to agriculture and discuss this model in the\nlight of the population versus technology debate and in Boserup's analytical\nframework in development theory. Although my model is based on ecological\n-Neomalthusian- principles, the coevolutionary positive feedback relationship\nbetween technology and population results in a seemingly Boserupian response:\ninnovation is greatest when population pressure is highest. This outcome is not\nonly visible in the theory-driven reduced model, but is also present in a\ncorresponding \"real world\" simulator which was tested against archaeological\ndata, demonstrating the relevance and validity of the coevolutionary model. The\nlesson to be learned is that not all that acts Boserupian needs Boserup at its\ncore.\n", "  Asymptotic iteration method (AIM) is used to find the exact analytical\nsolutions of the one dimensional Klein-Gordon equation for the q-deformed\nManning-Rosen potential with equal Lorentz vector and scalar potential. The\nbound state eigenfunctions are obtained in terms of the hypergeometric\nfunctions. Using the present results energy eigenvalues and corresponding\neigenfunctions of the special cases like P\u007foschl-Teller potential, Rosen-Morse\npotential and Eckart type potential are derived before concluding the work.\n", "  In this article we review the basics of the phasor formalism in a rigorous\nway, highlighting the physical motivation behind it and presenting a hyperbolic\ncounterpart of the phasor addition formula.\n", "  The result presented by the BOSS-SDSS Collaboration measuring the baryon\nacoustic oscillations of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest from high-redshift quasars\nindicates a $2.5\\sigma$ departure from the standard $\\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter\nmodel. This is the first time that the evolution of dark energy at high\nredshifts has been measured, and the current results cannot be explained by\nsimple generalizations of the cosmological constant. We show here that a simple\nphenomenological interaction in the dark sector provides a good explanation for\nthis deviation, naturally accommodating the Hubble parameter obtained by BOSS,\n$H(z=2.34)=222 \\pm 7 ~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. By performing a global fit\nof the parameters with the inclusion of this new data set together with the\nPlanck data for the interacting model, we are able to show that some\ninteracting models have constraints for $H(2.34)$ and $D_\\mathrm{A}(2.34)$ that\nare compatible with the ones obtained by the BOSS Collaboration, showing a\nbetter concordance than $\\Lambda$CDM. We also show that the interacting models\nthat have a small positive coupling constant, which helps alleviate the\ncoincidence problem, are compatible with the cosmological observations. Adding\nthe likelihood of these new baryon acoustic oscillations data shows an\nimprovement in the global fit, although it is not statistically significant.\nThe coupling constant could not be fully constrained by the data sets used, but\nthe dark energy equation of state shows a slight preference for a value\ndifferent from a cosmological constant.\n", "  We consider the the van der Waals force involving excited atoms in general\nenvironments, constituted by magnetodielectric bodies. We develop a dynamical\napproach studying the dynamics of the atoms and the field, mutually coupled.\nWhen only one atom is excited, our dynamical theory suggests that for large\ndistances the van der Waals force acting on the ground-state atom is monotonic,\nwhile the force acting in the excited atom is spatially oscillating. We show\nhow this latter force can be related to the known oscillating Casimir--Polder\nforce on an excited atom near a (ground-state) body. Our force also reveals a\npopulation-induced dynamics: for times much larger that the atomic lifetime the\natoms will decay to their ground-states leading to the van der Waals\ninteraction between ground-state atoms.\n", "  A cylindrical plasmonic structure with a concentric core exhibits an\nanomalous localized resonance which results in cloaking effects. Here we show\nthat, if the structure has an eccentric core, a new kind of shielding effect\ncan happen. In contrast to the conventional shielding device, our proposed\nstructure can block the effect of external electrical sources even on a region\nwhich is not enclosed by any conducting materials. In fact, the shielded region\nis located at a distance from the device. We analytically investigate this\nphenomenon by using the m\\\"{o}bius transformation via which an eccentric\nannulus is transformed into a concentric one. We also present several numerical\nexamples.\n", "  The possible emergence of a spin liquid phase in the half-filled Hubbard\nmodel on the honeycomb lattice; a simple model of graphene, is studied using\nthe variational cluster approximation. We found that the critical interaction\nstrength of a magnetic transition is slightly lower than that of the\nnon-magnetic metal-to-insulator transition. Thus a semi-metallic state becomes\na magnetic insulator as the interaction strength increases and a non-magnetic\ninsulating state does not occur. Therefore a spin liquid state characterized by\nan insulating state without long range order, is not realized in this system.\n", "  The goal of is to study how increased variability in the degree distribution\nimpacts the global connectivity properties of a large network. We approach this\nquestion by modeling the network as a uniform random graph with a given degree\nsequence. We analyze the effect of the degree variability on the approximate\nsize of the largest connected component using stochastic ordering techniques. A\ncounterexample shows that a higher degree variability may lead to a larger\nconnected component, contrary to basic intuition about branching processes.\nWhen certain extremal cases are ruled out, the higher degree variability is\nshown to decrease the limiting approximate size of the largest connected\ncomponent.\n", "  The COMPASS collaboration has collected the currently largest data set on\ndiffractively produced $\\pi^-\\pi^-\\pi^+$ final states using a negative pion\nbeam of 190 GeV/c momentum impinging on a stationary proton target. This data\nset allows for a systematic partial-wave analysis in 100 bins of three-pion\nmass, $0.5 < m_{3\\pi} < 2.5$ GeV/c$^2$ , and in 11 bins of the reduced\nfour-momentum transfer squared, $0.1 < t < 1.0$ (GeV/c)$^2$ . This\ntwo-dimensional analysis offers sensitivity to genuine one-step resonance\nproduction, i.e. the production of a state followed by its decay, as well as to\nmore complex dynamical effects in nonresonant $3\\pi$ production. In this paper,\nwe present detailed studies on selected $3\\pi$ partial waves with $J^{PC} =\n0^{-+}$, $1^{++}$, $2^{-+}$, $2^{++}$, and $4^{++}$. In these waves, we observe\nthe well-known ground-state mesons as well as a new narrow axial-vector meson\n$a_1(1420)$ decaying into $f_0(980) \\pi$. In addition, we present the results\nof a novel method to extract the amplitude of the $\\pi^-\\pi^+$ subsystem with\n$I^{G}J^{PC} = 0^+ 0^{++}$ in various partial waves from the $\\pi^-\\pi^-\\pi^+$\ndata. Evidence is found for correlation of the $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1500)$\nappearing as intermediate $\\pi^- \\pi^+$ isobars in the decay of the known\n$\\pi(1800)$ and $\\pi_2(1880)$.\n", "  In this study, a standing wave in an optical nanocavity with Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) constitutes a one-dimensional optical lattice potential in the\npresence of a finite two bodies atomic interaction. We report that the\ninteraction of a BEC with a standing field in an optical cavity coherently\nevolves to exhibit Fano resonances in the output field at the probe frequency.\nThe behavior of the reported resonance shows an excellent compatibility with\nthe original formulation of asymmetric resonance as discovered by Fano [U.\nFano, Phys. Rev. 124, 1866 (1961)]. Based on our analytical and numerical\nresults, we find that the Fano resonances and subsequently electromagnetically\ninduced transparency of the probe pulse can be controlled through the intensity\nof the cavity standing wave field and the strength of the atom-atom interaction\nin the BEC. In addition, enhancement of the slow light effect by the strength\nof the atom-atom interaction and its robustness against the condensate\nfluctuations are realizable using presently available technology.\n", "  Large graphs can be found in a wide array of scientific fields ranging from\nsociology and biology to scientometrics and computer science. Their analysis is\nby no means a trivial task due to their sheer size and complex structure. Such\nstructure encompasses features so diverse as diameter shrinking, power law\ndegree distribution and self similarity, edge interdependence, and communities.\nWhen the adjacency matrix of a graph is considered, then new, spectral\nproperties arise such as primary eigenvalue component decay function,\neigenvalue decay function, eigenvalue sign alternation around zero, and\nspectral gap. Graph mining is the scientific field which attempts to extract\ninformation and knowledge from graphs through their structural and spectral\nproperties. Graph modeling is the associated field of generating synthetic\ngraphs with properties similar to those of real graphs in order to simulate the\nlatter. Such simulations may be desirable because of privacy concerns, cost, or\nlack of access to real data. Pivotal to simulation are low- and high-level\nsoftware packages offering graph analysis and visualization capabilities. This\nsurvey outlines the most important structural and spectral graph properties, a\nconsiderable number of graph models, as well the most common graph mining and\ngraph learning tools.\n", "  In this paper, we study early-time inflation and late-time acceleration of\nthe universe by non-minimally coupling the Dirac field with torsion in the\nspatially flat Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model background.\nThe results obtained by the Noether symmetry approach with and without a gauge\nterm are compared. Additionally, we compare these results with that of the 3+1\ndimensional teleparallel gravity under Noether symmetry approach. And we see\nthat the study explains early-time inflation and late-time acceleration of the\nuniverse.\n", "  By interacting ghost dark energy (ghost DE) in the framework of Brans-Dicke\ntheory, a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic Bianchi type I Universe has\nbeen studied. For this purpose, we use the squared sound speed $c_s^2$ whose\nsign determines the stability of the model. As well as we probe observational\nconstraints on the ghost dark energy models as the unification of dark matter\nand dark energy by using the latest observational data. In order to do so, we\nfocus on observational determinations of the Hubble expansion rate (namely, the\nexpansion history) $H(z)$. After that we evaluate the evolution of the growth\nof perturbations in the linear regime for both ghost DE and Brans-Dicke theory\nand compare the results with standard FRW and $\\Lambda$CDM models. We display\nthe effects of the anisotropy on the evolutionary behavior the ghost DE models\nwhere the growth rate is higher in this models. Eventually the growth factor\nfor the $\\Lambda$CDM Universe will always fall behind the ghost DE models in an\nanisotropic Universe\n", "  We study physics concerning the cosmological constant problem in the\nframework of effective field theory and suggest that a dominant part of dark\nenergy can originate from gravitational corrections of vacuum energy, under the\nassumption that the classical gravitational fields do not couple to a large\nportion of the vacuum energy effectively, in spite of the coupling between\ngraviton and matters at a microscopic level. Our speculation is excellent with\nterascale supersymmetry.\n", "  Self-assembled nanowire (NW) crystals can be grown into nearly defect-free\nnanomechanical resonators with exceptional properties, including small motional\nmass, high resonant frequency, and low dissipation. Furthermore, by virtue of\nslight asymmetries in geometry, a NW's flexural modes are split into doublets\noscillating along orthogonal axes. These characteristics make bottom-up grown\nNWs extremely sensitive vectorial force sensors. Here, taking advantage of its\nadaptability as a scanning probe, we use a single NW to image a sample surface.\nBy monitoring the frequency shift and direction of oscillation of both modes as\nwe scan above the surface, we construct a map of all spatial tip-sample force\nderivatives in the plane. Finally, we use the NW to image electric force fields\ndistinguishing between forces arising from the NW charge and polarizability.\nThis universally applicable technique enables a form of atomic force microscopy\nparticularly suited to mapping the size and direction of weak tip-sample\nforces.\n", "  We construct high-precision models of the Universe that contain radiation, a\ncosmological constant, and periodically distributed inhomogeneous matter. The\ndensity contrasts in these models are allowed to be highly non-linear, and the\ncosmological expansion is treated as an emergent phenomenon. This is achieved\nby employing a generalised version of the post-Newtonian formalism, and by\njoining together inhomogeneous regions of space-time at reflection symmetric\njunctions. Using these models, we find general expressions that precisely and\nunambiguously quantify the effect of small-scale inhomogeneity on the\nlarge-scale expansion of space (an effect referred to as \"back-reaction\", in\nthe literature). We then proceed to specialize our models to the case where the\nmatter fields are given by a regular array of point-like particles. This allows\nus to derive extremely simple expressions for the emergent Friedmann-like\nequations that govern the large-scale expansion of space. It is found that the\npresence of radiation tends to reduce the magnitude of back-reaction effects,\nwhile the existence of a cosmological constant has only a negligible effect.\n", "  The dynamical formulation of time-independent scattering theory that is\ndeveloped in [Ann. Phys. (NY) 341, 77-85 (2014)] offers simple formulas for the\nreflection and transmission amplitudes of finite-range potentials in terms of\nthe solution of an initial-value differential equation. We prove a theorem that\nsimplifies the application of this result and use it to give a complete\ncharacterization of the invisible configurations of the truncated\n$\\mathfrak{z}\\,e^{-2ik_0 x}$ potential to a closed interval, $[0,L]$, with\n$k_0$ being a positive integer multiple of $\\pi/L$. This reveals a large class\nof exact unidirectionally and bidirectionally invisible configurations of this\npotential. The former arise for particular values of $\\mathfrak{z}$ that are\ngiven by certain zeros of Bessel functions. The latter occur when the\nwavenumber $k$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi/L$ but not of $k_0$. We discuss\nthe optical realizations of these configurations and explore spectral\nsingularities of this potential.\n", "  Among the interesting outcomes of the study of the physical applications of\nspectral singularities in PT-symmetric optical systems is the discovery of\nCPA-lasers. These are devices that act both as a threshold laser and a coherent\nperfect absorber (CPA) for the same values of their physical parameters. Unlike\na homogeneous slab that is made to act as a CPA, a slab CPA-laser would absorb\nthe incident waves coming from the left and right of the device provided that\nthey have appropriate intensity and phase contrasts. We provide a comprehensive\nstudy of one of the simplest experimentally accessible examples of a CPA-laser,\nnamely a PT-symmetric optical slab system consisting of a balanced pair of\nadjacent or separated gain and loss components. In particular, we give a closed\nform expression describing the spectral singularities of the system which\ncorrespond to its CPA-laser configurations. We determine the intensity and\nphase contrasts for the TE and TM waves that are emitted (absorbed) whenever\nthe slab acts as a laser (CPA). We also investigate the behavior of the\ntime-averaged energy density and Poynting vector for these waves. This is\nnecessary for determining the optimal values of the physical parameters of the\nsystem that make it act as a CPA-laser. These turn out to correspond to\nsituations where the separation distance $s$ between the gain and loss layers\nis an odd multiple of a characteristic length scale $s_0$. A curious by-product\nof our study is that, except for the cases where $s$ is an even integer\nmultiple of $s_0$, there is a critical angle of polarization beyond which the\nenergy of the waves emitted from the lossy layer can be larger than the energy\nof those emitted from the gain layer.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra with a\nnon-degenerate supersymmetric even invariant bilinear form, $f$ a nilpotent\nelement in the even part of $\\mathfrak{g}$, $\\Gamma$ a good grading of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$ for $f$ and $\\mathcal{W}^{k}(\\mathfrak{g},f;\\Gamma)$ the\n$\\mathcal{W}$-algebra associated with $\\mathfrak{g},f,k,\\Gamma$ defined by the\ngeneralized Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction. In this paper, we present each\n$\\mathcal{W}$-algebra as the intersection of kernels of the screening\noperators, acting on the tensor vertex superalgebra of an affine vertex\nsuperalgebra and a neutral free superfermion vertex superalgebra. As\napplications, we prove that the $\\mathcal{W}$-algebra associated with a regular\nnilpotent element in $\\mathfrak{osp}(1,2n)$ is isomorphic to the\n$\\mathcal{W}B_{n}$-algebra introduced by Fateev and Lukyanov, and that the\n$\\mathcal{W}$-algebra associated with a subregular nilpotent element in\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_{n}$ is isomorphic to the $\\mathcal{W}^{(2)}_{n}$-algebra\nintroduced by Feigin and Semikhatov.\n", "  We study the minimal excitations of fractional quantum Hall edges, extending\nthe notion of levitons to interacting systems. Using both perturbative and\nexact calculations, we show that they arise in response to a Lorentzian\npotential with quantized flux. They carry an integer charge, thus involving\nseveral Laughlin quasiparticles, and leave a Poissonian signature in a\nHanbury-Brown and Twiss partition noise measurement at low transparency. This\nmakes them readily accessible experimentally, ultimately offering the\nopportunity to study real-time transport of Abelian and non-Abelian\nexcitations.\n", "  We study the thick brane world system constructed in the recently proposed\n$f(R,T)$ theories of gravity, with $R$ the Ricci scalar and $T$ the trace of\nthe energy-momentum tensor. We try to get the analytic background solutions and\ndiscuss the full linear perturbations, especially the scalar perturbations. We\ncompare how the brane world model is modified with that of general relativity\ncoupled to a canonical scalar field. It is found that some more interesting\nbackground solutions are allowed, and only the scalar perturbation mode is\nmodified. There is no tachyon state exists in this model and only the massless\ntensor mode can be localized on the brane, which recovers the effective\nfour-dimensional gravity. These conclusions hold provided that two constraints\non the original formalism of the action are satisfied.\n", "  We consider the problem to determine the optimal rotations $R \\in {\\rm\nSO}(n)$ which minimize\n  $$W: {\\rm SO}(n) \\to \\mathbb{R}^+_0,\\quad W(R\\,;D) := ||{\\rm sym}(RD -\n1)||^2$$ for a given diagonal matrix $D := {\\rm diag}(d_1, ..., d_n) \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. The function $W$ subject to minimization is the\nreduced form of the Cosserat shear-stretch energy, which, in its general form,\nis a contribution in any geometrically nonlinear, isotropic and quadratic\nCosserat micropolar (extended) continuum model. We characterize the critical\npoints of the energy $W(R\\,;D)$, determine the global minimizers and the global\nminimum. This proves the correctness of previously obtained formulae for the\noptimal Cosserat rotations in dimensions two and three. The key to the proof is\na characterization of the entire set of (possibly non-symmetric) real matrix\nsquare roots of (possibly non-positive definite) real symmetric matrices which\ndoes not seem to be known in the literature.\n", "  We present results from IROCKS (Intermediate Redshift OSIRIS Chemo-Kinematic\nSurvey) for sixteen z~1 and one z~1.4 star-forming galaxies. All galaxies were\nobserved with OSIRIS with the laser guide star adaptive optics system at Keck\nObservatory. We use rest-frame nebular Ha emission lines to trace morphologies\nand kinematics of ionized gas in star-forming galaxies on sub-kiloparsec\nphysical scales. We observe elevated velocity dispersions (sigma > 50 km/s)\nseen in z > 1.5 galaxies persist at z~1 in the integrated galaxies. Using an\ninclined disk model and the ratio of v/sigma, we find that 1/3 of the z~1\nsample are disk candidates while the other 2/3 of the sample are dominated by\nmerger-like and irregular sources. We find that including extra attenuation\ntowards HII regions derived from stellar population synthesis modeling brings\nstar formation rates (SFR) using Ha and stellar population fit into a better\nagreement. We explore properties of compact Ha sub-component, or \"clump,\" at\nz~1 and find that they follow a similar size-luminosity relation as local HII\nregions but are scaled-up by an order of magnitude with higher luminosities and\nsizes. Comparing the z~1 clumps to other high-redshift clump studies, we\ndetermine that the clump SFR surface density evolves as a function of redshift.\nThis may imply clump formation is directly related to the gas fraction in these\nsystems and support disk fragmentation as their formation mechanism since gas\nfraction scales with redshift.\n", "  In this paper, we establish the analysis of noncommutative Yukawa theory,\nencompassing neutral and charged scalar fields. We approach the analysis by\nconsidering carefully the derivation of the respective effective actions.\nHence, based on the obtained results, we compute the one-loop contributions to\nthe neutral and charged scalar field self-energy, as well as to the\nChern-Simons polarization tensor. In order to properly define the behaviour of\nthe quantum fields, the known UV/IR mixing due to radiative corrections is\nanalysed in the one-loop physical dispersion relation of the scalar and gauge\nfields.\n", "  We consider the internal structure and the physical properties of specific\nclasses of neutron, quark and Bose-Einstein Condensate stars in the hybrid\nmetric-Palatini gravity theory, which is a combination of the metric and\nPalatini $f(R)$ formalisms. The theory is very successful in accounting for the\nobserved phenomenology, since it unifies local constraints at the Solar System\nlevel and the late-time cosmic acceleration, even if the scalar field is very\nlight. We derive the equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetric\nconfiguration (mass continuity and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) in the framework\nof hybrid metric-Palatini theory, and we investigate their solutions\nnumerically for different equations of state of neutron and quark matter, by\nadopting for the scalar field potential a Higgs-type form. Stellar models,\ndescribed by the stiff fluid, radiation-like, the bag model and the\nBose-Einstein Condensate equations of state are explicitly constructed in both\nGeneral Relativity and hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, thus allowing an in\ndepth comparison between the predictions of these two gravitational theories.\nAs a general result it turns out that for all the considered equations of\nstate, hybrid metric-Palatini gravity stars are more massive than their general\nrelativistic counterparts. Furthermore, two classes of stellar models\ncorresponding to fixed forms of the scalar field are also investigated.\nInterestingly enough, in the case of a constant scalar field the equation of\nstate of the matter takes the form of the bag model equation of state\ndescribing quark matter. As a possible astrophysical application of the\nobtained results we suggest that stellar mass black holes, with masses in the\nrange of $3.8M_{\\odot}$ and $6M_{\\odot}$, respectively, could be in fact hybrid\nmetric-Palatini gravity neutron or quark stars.\n", "  Chemically active colloids move by creating gradients in the composition of\nthe surrounding solution and by exploiting the differences in their\ninteractions with the various molecular species in solution. If such particles\nmove near boundaries, e.g., the walls of the container confining the\nsuspension, gradients in the composition of the solution are also created along\nthe wall. This give rise to chemi-osmosis (via the interactions of the wall\nwith the molecular species forming the solution), which drives flows coupling\nback to the colloid and thus influences its motility. Employing an approximate\n\"point-particle\" analysis, we show analytically that -- owing to this kind of\ninduced active response (chemi-osmosis) of the wall -- such chemically active\ncolloids can align with, and follow, gradients in the surface chemistry of the\nwall. In this sense, these artificial \"swimmers\" exhibit a primitive form of\nthigmotaxis with the meaning of sensing the proximity of a (not necessarily\ndiscontinuous) physical change in the environment. We show that the alignment\nwith the surface-chemistry gradient is generic for chemically active colloids\nas long as they exhibit motility in an unbounded fluid, i.e., this phenomenon\ndoes not depend on the exact details of the propulsion mechanism. The results\nare discussed in the context of simple models of chemical activity,\ncorresponding to Janus particles with \"source\" chemical reactions on one half\nof the surface and either \"inert\" or \"sink\" reactions over the other half.\n", "  Higher-order mode (HOM) based intra-cavity beam diagnostics has been proved\neffectively and conveniently in superconducting radio-frequency (SRF)\naccelerators. Our recent research shows that the beam harmonics in the bunch\ntrain excited HOM spectrum, which have much higher signal-to-noise ratio than\nthe intrinsic HOM peaks, may also be useful for beam diagnostics. In this\npaper, we will present our study on bunch train excited HOMs, including the\ntheoretic model and recent experiments carried out based on the DC-SRF\nphotoinjector and SRF linac at Peking University.\n", "  According to Dyson's three fold way, from the viewpoint of global time\nreversal symmetry there are three circular ensembles of unitary random matrices\nrelevant to the study of chaotic spectra in quantum mechanics. These are the\ncircular orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles, denoted COE, CUE and CSE\nrespectively. For each of these three ensembles and their thinned versions,\nwhereby each eigenvalue is deleted independently with probability $1-\\xi$, we\ntake up the problem of calculating the first two terms in the scaled large $N$\nexpansion of the spacing distributions. It is well known that the leading term\nadmits a characterisation in terms of both Fredholm determinants and Painlev\\'e\ntranscendents. We show that modifications of these characterisations also\nremain valid for the next to leading term, and that they provide schemes for\nhigh precision numerical computations. In the case of the CUE there is an\napplication to the analysis of Odlyzko's data set for the Riemann zeros, and in\nthat case some further statistics are similarly analysed.\n", "  Purpose\n  The proposed reconstruction framework addresses the reconstruction accuracy,\nnoise propagation and computation time for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting\n(MRF).\n  Methods\n  Based on a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the signal evolution, MRF is\nformulated as a low rank inverse problem in which one image is reconstructed\nfor each singular value under consideration. This low rank approximation of the\nsignal evolution reduces the computational burden by reducing the number of\nFourier transformations. Also, the low rank approximation improves the\nconditioning of the problem, which is further improved by extending the low\nrank inverse problem to an augmented Lagrangian that is solved by the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The root mean square error\nand the noise propagation are analyzed in simulations. For verification, in\nvivo examples are provided.\n  Results\n  The proposed low rank ADMM approach shows a reduced root mean square error\ncompared to the original fingerprinting reconstruction, to a low rank\napproximation alone and to an ADMM approach without a low rank approximation.\nIncorporating sensitivity encoding allows for further artifact reduction.\n  Conclusion\n  The proposed reconstruction provides robust convergence, reduced\ncomputational burden and improved image quality compared to other MRF\nreconstruction approaches evaluated in this study.\n", "  We report on the measurement of the two-neutrino double beta decay half-life\nof $^{130}$Te with the CUORE-0 detector. From an exposure of 33.4 kg$\\cdot$y of\nTeO$_2$, the half-life is determined to be $T_{1/2}^{2\\nu}$ = [8.2 $\\pm$ 0.2\n(stat.) $\\pm$ 0.6 (syst.)] $\\times$ 10$^{20}$y. This result is obtained after a\ndetailed reconstruction of the sources responsible for the CUORE-0 counting\nrate, with a specific study of those contributing to the $^{130}$Te\nneutrinoless double beta decay region of interest.\n", "  We investigate the effect of introducing nearest-neighbor $p$-wave\nsuperconducting pairing to both the static and kicked extended Harper model\nwith two periodic phase parameters acting as artificial dimensions to simulate\nthree-dimensional systems. It is found that in both the static model and the\nkicked model, by varying the $p$-wave pairing order parameter, the system can\nswitch between a fully gapped phase and a gapless phase with point nodes or\nline nodes. The topological property of both the static and kicked model is\nrevealed by calculating corresponding topological invariants defined in the\none-dimensional lattice dimension. Under open boundary conditions along the\nphysical dimension, Majorana flat bands at energy zero (quasienergy zero and\n$\\pi$) emerge in the static (kicked) model at the two-dimensional surface\nBrillouin zone. For certain values of pairing order parameter, (Floquet)\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger-like edge modes appear in the form of arcs connecting\ndifferent (Floquet) Majorana flat bands. Finally, we find that in the kicked\nmodel, it is possible to generate two controllable Floquet Majorana modes, one\nat quasienergy zero and the other at quasienergy $\\pi$, at the same parameter\nvalues.\n", "  We derive the expression for the observed redshift in the weak field limit in\nthe observer's past light cone, including all relativistic terms up to second\norder in velocity. We then apply it to compute the cluster-galaxy\ncross-correlation functions (CGCF) using N-body simulations. The CGCF is\nasymmetric along the line of sight (LOS) owing to the presence of the small\nsecond order terms such as the gravitational redshift (GRedshift). We identify\ntwo systematics in the modelling of the GRedshift signal in stacked clusters.\nFirst, it is affected by the morphology of dark matter haloes and the\nlarge-scale cosmic-web. The non-spherical distribution of galaxies around the\ncentral halo and the presence of neighbouring clusters systematically reduce\nthe GRedshift signal. This bias is approximately 20% for $M_{\\rm min}\\simeq\n10^{14} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}/h$, and is more than 50% for haloes with $M_{\\rm\nmin}\\simeq 2\\times 10^{13} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}/h$ at $r>$4 Mpc/$h$. Second, the\nbest-fit gravitational redshift profiles as well as the profiles of all other\nrelativistic terms are found to be significantly different in velocity space\ncompared to their real space versions. We discuss some subtleties relating to\nthese effects in velocity space. We also find that the S/N of the GRedshift\nsignal increases with decreasing halo mass.\n", "  We show that under an a.c. magnetic field excitation the vortex lattice in a\nsuperconductor with periodic array of holes can undergo a transition from a\nMott-like state where each vortex is localized in a hole, to a metal-like state\nwhere the vortices get delocalized. The vortex dynamics is studied through the\nmagnetic shielding response which is measured using a low frequency two-coil\nmutual inductance technique on a disordered superconducting NbN film having\nperiodic array of holes. We observe that the shielding response of the vortex\nstate is strongly dependent on the amplitude of the a.c. magnetic excitation.\nAt low amplitude the shielding response varies smoothly with excitation\namplitude, corresponding to elastic deformation of the vortex lattice. However,\nabove a threshold value of excitation the response shows a series of sharp\njumps, signaling the onset of the Mott to metal transition. Quantitative\nanalysis reveals that this is a collective phenomenon which depends on the\nfilling fraction of vortices in the antidot lattice.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an initially thermalized spin chain in the quantum\nXY-model, after sudden coupling to a heat bath of lower temperature at one end\nof the chain. In the semi-classical limit we see an exponential decay of the\nsystem-bath heatflux by exact solution of the reduced dynamics. In the full\nquantum description however, we numerically find the heatflux to reach\nintermediate plateaus where it is approximately constant -- a phenomenon that\nwe attribute to the finite speed of heat transport via spin waves.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is one of the most prominent features of quantum\nmechanics and forms the basis of quantum information technologies. Here we\npresent a novel method for the creation of quantum entanglement in multipartite\nand high-dimensional systems. The two ingredients are 1) superposition of\nphoton pairs with different origins and 2) aligning photons such that their\npaths are identical. We explain the experimentally feasible creation of various\nclasses of multiphoton entanglement encoded in polarization as well as in\nhigh-dimensional Hilbert spaces -- starting only from non-entangled photon\npairs. For two photons, arbitrary high-dimensional entanglement can be created.\nThe idea of generating entanglement by path identity could also apply to other\nquantum entities than photons. We discovered the technique by analyzing the\noutput of a computer algorithm. This shows that computer designed quantum\nexperiments can be inspirations for new techniques.\n", "  On the basis of the transport features and experimental phenomena observed in\nstudies of molecular motors, we proposea double-temperature ratchet model of\ncoupled motors to reveal the dynamical mechanism of cooperative transport of\nmotors with two heads, where the interactions and asynchrony between two motor\nheads are taken into account. We investigate the collective unidirectional\ntransport of coupled system and find that the direction of motion can be\nreversed under certain conditions. Reverse motion can be achieved by modulating\nthe coupling strength, coupling free length, and asymmetric coefficient of the\nperiodic potential, which is understood in terms of the effective potential\ntheory. The dependence of the directed current on various parameters is studied\nsystematically. Directed transport of coupled Brownian motors can be\nmanipulated and optimized by adjusting the pulsation period or the phase shift\nof the pulsation temperature.\n", "  Utilizing a second-order hydrodynamics formalism, the dispersion relations\nfor the frequencies and damping rates of collective oscillations as well as\nspatial structure of these modes up to the decapole oscillation in both two-\nand three- dimensional gas geometries are calculated. In addition to\nhigher-order modes, the formalism also gives rise to purely damped\n\"non-hydrodynamic\" modes. We calculate the amplitude of the various modes for\nboth symmetric and asymmetric trap quenches, finding excellent agreement with\nan exact quantum mechanical calculation. We find that higher-order hydrodynamic\nmodes are more sensitive to the value of shear viscosity, which may be of\ninterest for the precision extraction of transport coefficients in Fermi gas\nsystems.\n", "  Using the Clifford and the Spin-Clifford formalisms we prove that the\nclassical relativistic Hamilton Jacobi equation for a charged massive (and\nspinning) particle interacting with an external electromagnetic field is\nequivalent to a Dirac-Hestenes equation satisfied by a class of spinor fields\nthat we call classical spinor fields, characterized for having the Takabayashi\nangle function constant (equal to 0 or {\\pi}). We also investigate a nonlinear\nDirac-Hestenes like equation that comes from some class of generalized\nclassical spinor fields. Finally we show that the general Dirac-Hestenes\nequation (which is a representative in the Clifford bundle of the usual Dirac\nequation) gives a generalized Hamilton-Jacobi equation where the quantum\npotential satisfy a severe constraint and the \"mass of the particle\" becomes a\nvariable. Our results can then explain the experimental discrepancies found\nbetween prediction of the de Broglie-Bohm theory and recent experiments. We\nbriefly discuss also the de Broglie's double solution theory in view of our\nresults showing that it can be realized, at least in the case of spinning free\nparticles..The paper contains several Appendices where notation and proofs of\nsome results of the text are presented.\n", "  Hyperuniform many particle systems in d-dimensional space, which includes\ncrystals, quasicrystals, and some exotic disordered systems, are characterized\nby an anomalous suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales such\nthat the local number variance within a \"spherical\" observation window grows\nslower than the window volume. In usual circumstances, this direct space\ncondition is equivalent to the Fourier space hyperuniformity condition that the\nstructure factor vanishes as the wavenumber goes to zero. In this paper, we\ncomprehensively study the effect of aspherical window shapes with\ncharacteristic size $L$ on the direct space condition for hyperuniform systems.\nFor lattices, we demonstrate that the variance growth rate can depend on the\nshape as well as the orientation of the windows, and in some cases, the growth\nrate can be faster than the window volume ($L^d$), which may lead one to\nfalsely conclude that the system is non-hyperuniform solely according to the\ndirect space condition. We analyze the effect of window orientation on the\ngrowth rate, especially for two-dimensional lattices using square windows.\nBased on this analysis, we explain the reason why the variance can grow faster\nthan the window area ($L^2$) or even slower than the window perimeter ($L$).\nThis analysis demonstrates an example of physical systems exhibiting\ncommensurate-incommensurate transitions and is closely related to problems in\nnumber theory (e.g., Diophantine approximation and Gauss' circle problem) and\ndiscrepancy theory. We prove that for a hyperuniform system its\norientationally-averaged variance, instead of the conventional one using\nwindows with a fixed orientation, has a common large-$L$ asymptotic behavior\nregardless of the window shape (for convex windows), thus it can be used to\nresolve the window-shape dependence of the growth rate of the variance on the\nspherical-window condition.\n", "  We establish a correspondence between ultraviolet singularities of soft\nfactors for multiparticle production and rapidity singularities of soft factors\nfor multiparton scattering. This correspondence is a consequence of the\nconformal mapping between scattering geometries. The correspondence is valid to\nall orders of perturbation theory and in this way provides one with a proof of\nrapidity renormalization procedure for multiparton scattering (including the\ntransverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization as a special case). As a\nby-product, we obtain an exact relation between the rapidity anomalous\ndimension and the well-known soft anomalous dimension. The three-loop\nexpressions for TMD and a general multiparton scattering rapidity anomalous\ndimension are derived.\n", "  We have annealed two dimensional lattice model of Coulomb glass using Monte\nCarlo simulations to obtain the ground state. We have shown that the energy\nrequired to create a domain of linear size L in d dimensions is proportional to\n$L^{d-1}$. Using Imry-Ma arguments given for RFIM, one gets $d_{c}\\geq 2$ for\nCoulomb glass. The investigations in the transition region shows that the\ndomain wall of the metastable state in the charge-ordered phase shifts as\ndisorder is increased to give disordered ground state at higher disorder\nstrength indicating phase coexistence. This coupled with discontinuity in\nmagnetization is an indication of first-order type transition from\ncharge-ordered phase to disordered phase. The structure and nature of Random\nfield fluctuations of the domain in Coulomb glass are inconsistent with the\nassumptions of Imry and Ma as was also reported for RFIM.\n", "  We demonstrate Josephson junction based double-balanced mixer and phase\nshifter circuits operating at 6-10 GHz, and integrate these components to\nimplement both a monolithic amplitude/phase vector modulator and a quadrature\nmixer. The devices are actuated by flux signals, dissipate no power on chip,\nexhibit input saturation powers in excess of 1 nW, and provide cryogenic\nmicrowave modulation solutions for integrated control of superconducting\nqubits.\n", "  Einstein's theory of gravity has been extensively tested on solar system\nscales, and for isolated astrophysical systems, using the perturbative\nframework known as the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. This\nframework is designed for use in the weak-field and slow-motion limit of\ngravity, and can be used to constrain a large class of metric theories of\ngravity with data collected from the aforementioned systems. Given the\npotential of future surveys to probe cosmological scales to high precision, it\nis a topic of much contemporary interest to construct a similar framework to\nlink Einstein's theory of gravity and its alternatives to observations on\ncosmological scales. Our approach to this problem is to adapt and extend the\nexisting PPN formalism for use in cosmology. We derive a set of equations that\nuse the same parameters to consistently model both weak fields and cosmology.\nThis allows us to parameterize a large class of modified theories of gravity\nand dark energy models on cosmological scales, using just four functions of\ntime. These four functions can be directly linked to the background expansion\nof the universe, first-order cosmological perturbations, and the weak-field\nlimit of the theory. They also reduce to the standard PPN parameters on solar\nsystem scales. We illustrate how dark energy models and scalar-tensor and\nvector-tensor theories of gravity fit into this framework, which we refer to as\n\"parameterized post-Newtonian cosmology\" (PPNC).\n", "  Nambu-Goldstone theorem provides gapless modes to both relativistic and\nnonrelativistic systems. The Nambu-Goldstone bosons in insulating magnets are\ncalled magnons or spin-waves and play a key role in magnetization transport. We\nreview here our past works on magnetization transport in insulating magnets and\nalso add new insights, with a particular focus on magnon transport. We\nsummarize in detail the magnon counterparts of electron transport, such as the\nWiedemann-Franz law, the Onsager reciprocal relation between the Seebeck and\nPeltier coefficients, the Hall effects, the superconducting state, the\nJosephson effects, and the persistent quantized current in a ring to list a\nfew. Focusing on the electromagnetism of moving magnons, i.e., magnetic\ndipoles, we theoretically propose a way to directly measure magnon currents. As\na consequence of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem, spin transport is\ndrastically altered in one-dimensional antiferromagnetic (AF) spin-1/2 chains;\nwhere the N\\'eel order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations and a quasiparticle\nmagnon-like picture breaks down. Instead, the low-energy collective excitations\nof the AF spin chain are described by a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) which\nprovides the spin transport properties in such antiferromagnets some universal\nfeatures at low enough temperature. Finally, we enumerate open issues and\nprovide a platform to discuss the future directions of magnonics.\n", "  The intense theoretical and experimental interest in topological insulators\nand semimetals has established band structure topology as a fundamental\nmaterial property. Consequently, identifying band topologies has become an\nimportant, but often challenging problem, with no exhaustive solution at the\npresent time. In this work we compile a series of techniques, some previously\nknown, that allow for a solution to this problem for a large set of the\npossible band topologies. The method is based on tracking hybrid Wannier charge\ncenters computed for relevant Bloch states, and it works at all levels of\nmaterials modeling: continuous k.p models, tight-binding models and ab initio\ncalculations. We apply the method to compute and identify Chern, Z2 and\ncrystalline topological insulators, as well as topological semimetal phases,\nusing real material examples. Moreover, we provide a numerical implementation\nof this technique (the Z2Pack software package) that is ideally suited for\nhigh-throughput screening of materials databases for compounds with non-trivial\ntopologies. We expect that our work will allow researchers to: (a) identify\ntopological materials optimal for experimental probes, (b) classify existing\ncompounds and (c) reveal materials that host novel, not yet described,\ntopological states.\n", "  Scorpius X-1 (Sco X-1) and X-ray transient (XTE) J1751-305 are Low-Mass X-ray\nBinaries (LMXBs) that may emit continuous gravitational waves detectable in the\nband of ground-based interferometric observatories. Neutron stars in LMXBs\ncould reach a torque-balance steady-state equilibrium in which angular momentum\naddition from infalling matter from the binary companion is balanced by angular\nmomentum loss, conceivably due to gravitational-wave emission. Torque-balance\npredicts a scale for detectable gravitational-wave strain based on observed\nX-ray flux. This paper describes a search for Sco X-1 and XTE J1751-305 in LIGO\nScience Run 6 data using the TwoSpect algorithm, based on searching for orbital\nmodulations in the frequency domain. While no detections are claimed, upper\nlimits on continuous gravitational-wave emission from Sco X-1 are obtained,\nspanning gravitational-wave frequencies from 40 to 2040 Hz and projected\nsemi-major axes from 0.90 to 1.98 light-seconds. These upper limits are\ninjection validated, equal any previous set in initial LIGO data, and extend\nover a broader parameter range. At optimal strain sensitivity, achieved at 165\nHz, the 95% confidence level random-polarization upper limit on dimensionless\nstrain $h_0$ is approximately $1.8 \\times 10^{-24}$. Closest approach to the\ntorque-balance limit, within a factor of 27, is also at 165 Hz. These are the\nfirst upper limits known to date on $r$-mode emission from this XTE source.\nUpper limits are set in particular narrow frequency bands of interest for\nJ1751-305. The TwoSpect method will be used in upcoming searches of Advanced\nLIGO and Virgo data.\n", "  On the background of the Born-Oppenheimer (adiabatic) approximation, we\ninvestigate the geometrical and topological structure in the theory of quantum\ngravity by using the path integral method and halfclassical approximation. As\nwe know, Berry curvature can be extracted from the linear response of a driven\ntwo-level system to nonadiabatic manipulations of its Hamiltonian. In parameter\nspace of the Hamiltonian, magnetic monopoles can be artificially simulated.\nRipples occur in Hilbert space when the monopole travels from inside to outside\nthe surface of energy manifold spanned by system parameters. From this point of\nview, we set up the connection between the ripples characterized by the\nfidelity of quantum states in Hilbert space and gravitational-like waves in\nminisuperspace. This might open a window for the study of geometrical and\ntopological properties of quantum gravity with the help of quantum physical\nsystems.\n", "  In spite of their relatively high lattice thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa_{\\ell}$, the XNiSn (X=Ti, Zr or Hf) half-Heusler compounds are good\nthermoelectric materials. Previous studies have shown that $\\kappa_{\\ell}$ can\nbe reduced by sublattice-alloying on the X-site. To cast light on how the alloy\ncomposition affects $\\kappa_\\ell$, we study this system using the phonon\nBoltzmann-transport equation within the relaxation time approximation in\nconjunction with density functional theory.The effect of alloying through\nmass-disorder scattering is explored using the virtual crystal approximation to\nscreen the entire ternary Ti$_x$Zr$_{y}$Hf$_{1-x-y}$NiSn phase diagram. The\nlowest lattice thermal conductivity is found for the Ti$_x$Hf$_{1-x}$NiSn\ncompositions; in particular, there is a shallow minimum centered at\nTi$_{0.5}$Hf$_{0.5}$NiSn with $\\kappa_l$ taking values between 3.2 and 4.1 W/mK\nwhen the Ti content varies between 20 and 80\\%. Interestingly, the overall\nbehavior of mass-disorder scattering in this system can only be understood from\na combination of the nature of the phonon modes and the magnitude of the mass\nvariance. Mass-disorder scattering is not effective at scattering acoustic\nphonons of low energy. By using a simple model of grain boundary scattering, we\nfind that nanostructuring these compounds can scatter such phonons effectively\nand thus further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity; for instance,\nTi$_{0.5}$Hf$_{0.5}$NiSn with a grain size of $L= 100$ nm experiences a 42\\%\nreduction of $\\kappa_{\\ell}$ compared to that of the single crystal.\n", "  Entanglement pre-thermalization (EP) is a quasi-stationary nonequilibrium\nstate of a composite system in which each individual subsystem looks thermal\nbut the entire system remains nonthermal due to quantum entanglement between\nsubsystems. We theoretically study the dynamics of EP following a coherent\nsplit of a one-dimensional harmonic potential in which two interacting bosons\nare confined. This problem is equivalent to that of an interaction quench\nbetween two harmonic oscillators. We show that this simple model captures the\nbare essentials of EP; that is, each subsystem relaxes to an approximate\nthermal equilibrium, whereas the total system remains entangled. We find that a\ngeneralized Gibbs ensemble, which incorporates nonlocal conserved quantities,\nexactly describes the total system. In the presence of a symmetry-breaking\nperturbation, EP is quasi-stationary and eventually reaches thermal\nequilibrium. We analytically show that the lifetime of EP is inversely\nproportional to the magnitude of the perturbation.\n", "  We investigated the ground state symmetry of the cubic hidden order compound\nCeB$_6$ by means of core level non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NIXS).\nThe information is obtained from the directional dependence of the scattering\nfunction that arises from higher than dipole transitions. Our new method\nconfirms that the ground state is well described using a localized\ncrystal-field model assuming a $\\Gamma_8$ quartet ground state.\n", "  We describe the construction of an apparatus designed to realize a hybrid\nquantum system comprised of a cryogenically cooled mechanical oscillator and\nultra-cold $^{87}$Rb atoms coupled via light. The outstanding feature of our\ninstrument is an in-situ adjustable asymmetric all-fiber membrane-in-the-middle\ncavity located inside an ultra-high vacuum dilution refrigerator based\ncryostat. We show that Bose-Einstein condensates of $N=2\\times10^6$ atoms can\nbe produced in less than 20 s and demonstrate a single photon optomechanical\ncoupling strength of $g_0=2\\pi\\times9$ kHz employing a high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$\nmembrane with a mechanical quality factor $Q_{\\rm m}>10^7$ at a cavity set-up\ntemperature of $T_{\\rm MiM}=480$ mK.\n", "  We study the algebraic structure of the configuration space of the\nKodaira-Spencer gravity theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. We then investigate\nthe deformation problem of the Kodaira-Spencer gravity at the classical level\nusing the algebraic tools obtained here.\n", "  Assessing the stability of economic systems is a fundamental research focus\nin economics, that has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the currently\ntroubled economic situation. In particular, much attention has been devoted to\nthe interbank lending market as an important diffusion channel for financial\ndistress during the recent crisis. In this work we study the stability of the\ninterbank market to exogenous shocks using an agent-based network framework.\nOur model encompasses several ingredients that have been recognized in the\nliterature as pro-cyclical triggers of financial distress in the banking\nsystem: credit and liquidity shocks through bilateral exposures, liquidity\nhoarding due to counterparty creditworthiness deterioration, target leveraging\npolicies and fire-sales spillovers. But we exclude the possibility of central\nauthorities intervention. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183\nEuropean banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013. We document the\nextreme fragility of the interbank lending market up to 2008, when a systemic\ncrisis leads to total depletion of market equity with an increasing speed of\nmarket collapse. After the crisis instead the system is more resilient to\nsystemic events in terms of residual market equity. However, the speed at which\nthe crisis breaks out reaches a new maximum in 2011, and never goes back to\nvalues observed before 2007. Our analysis points to the key role of the crisis\noutbreak speed, which sets the maximum delay for central authorities\nintervention to be effective.\n", "  Building on the striking similarity between the structure of the spindle\nduring mitosis in living cells and nematic textures in confined liquid\ncrystals, we use a continuum model of two-dimensional nematic liquid crystal\ndroplets, to examine the physical aspects of cell division. The model\ninvestigates the interplay between bulk elasticity of the microtubule assembly,\ndescribed as a nematic liquid crystal, and surface elasticity of the cell\ncortex, modelled as a bounding flexible membrane, in controlling cell shape and\ndivision. The centrosomes at the spindle poles correspond to the cores of the\ntopological defects required to accommodate nematic order in a closed geometry.\nWe map out the progression of both healthy bipolar and faulty multi-polar\ndivision as a function of an effective parameter that incorporates active\nprocesses and controls centrosome separation. A robust prediction, independent\nof energetic considerations, is that the transition from a single cell to\ndaughters cells occurs at critical value of this parameter. Our model\nadditionally suggests that microtubule anchoring at the cell cortex may play an\nimportant role for successful bipolar division. This can be tested\nexperimentally by regulating microtubule anchoring.\n", "  In recent years, Planck-scale modifications to particles' dispersion relation\nhave been deeply studied for the possibility to formulate some phenomenology of\nPlanckian effects in astrophysical and cosmological frameworks. There are some\nindications [arXiv:gr-qc/0611024] that Finsler geometry can provide some\ngeneralization of Riemannian geometry which may allow to account for\nnon-trivial (Planckian) structure of relativistic particles' configuration\nspace. We investigate the possibility to formalize Planck-scale deformations to\nrelativistic models in curved spacetime, within the framework of Finsler\ngeometry. We take into account the general strategy of analysis of\nmodifications of dispersion relations in curved spacetimes proposed in\n[arXiv:1507.02056], generalizing to the de Sitter case the results obtained in\n[arXiv:1407.8143], for deformed relativistic particle kinematics in flat\nspacetime using Finsler formalism.\n", "  Complex networks have been used intensively to investigate the flow and\ndynamics of many natural systems including the climate system. Here, we develop\na percolation based measure, the order parameter, to study and quantify climate\nnetworks. We find that abrupt transitions of the order parameter usually occur\n$\\sim$1 year before El Ni\\~{n}o ~ events, suggesting that they can be used as\nearly warning precursors of El Ni\\~{n}o. Using this method we analyze several\nreanalysis datasets and show the potential for good forecasting of El Ni\\~{n}o.\nThe percolation based order parameter exhibits discontinuous features,\nindicating possible relation to the first order phase transition mechanism.\n", "  We describe a dark matter axion detector designed, constructed, and operated\nboth as an innovation platform for new cavity and amplifier technologies and as\na data pathfinder in the $5 - 25$ GHz range ($\\sim20-100\\: \\mu$eV). The\nplatform is small but flexible to facilitate the development of new microwave\ncavity and amplifier concepts in an operational environment. The experiment has\nrecently completed its first data production; it is the first microwave cavity\naxion search to deploy a Josephson parametric amplifier and a dilution\nrefrigerator to achieve near-quantum limited performance.\n", "  Differential spectra in observables that resolve additional soft or collinear\nQCD emissions exhibit Sudakov double logarithms in the form of logarithmic plus\ndistributions. Important examples are the total transverse momentum $q_T$ in\ncolor-singlet production, N-jettiness (with thrust or beam thrust as special\ncases), but also jet mass and more complicated jet substructure observables.\nThe all-order logarithmic structure of such distributions is often fully\nencoded in differential equations, so-called (renormalization group) evolution\nequations. We introduce a well-defined technique of distributional scale\nsetting, which allows one to treat logarithmic plus distributions like ordinary\nlogarithms when solving these differential equations. In particular, this\nallows one (through canonical scale choices) to minimize logarithmic\ncontributions in the boundary terms of the solution, and to obtain the full\ndistributional logarithmic structure from the solution's evolution kernel\ndirectly in distribution space. We apply this technique to the $q_T$\ndistribution, where the two-dimensional nature of convolutions leads to\nadditional difficulties (compared to one-dimensional cases like thrust), and\nfor which the resummation in distribution (or momentum) space has been a\nlong-standing open question. For the first time, we show how to perform the RG\nevolution fully in momentum space, thereby directly resumming the logarithms\n$[\\ln^n(q_T^2/Q^2)/q_T^2]_+$ appearing in the physical $q_T$ distribution. The\nresummation accuracy is then solely determined by the perturbative expansion of\nthe associated anomalous dimensions.\n", "  The first lattice QCD calculation of the form factors governing $\\Lambda_c\n\\to \\Lambda \\ell^+ \\nu_\\ell$ decays is reported. The calculation was performed\nwith two different lattice spacings and includes one ensemble with a pion mass\nof 139(2) MeV. The resulting predictions for the $\\Lambda_c \\to \\Lambda e^+\n\\nu_e$ and $\\Lambda_c \\to \\Lambda \\mu^+ \\nu_\\mu$ decay rates divided by\n$|V_{cs}|^2$ are $0.2007(71)(74)\\:{\\rm ps}^{-1}$ and $0.1945(69)(72)\\:{\\rm\nps}^{-1}$, respectively, where the two uncertainties are statistical and\nsystematic. Taking the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ from\na global fit and the $\\Lambda_c$ lifetime from experiments, this translates to\nbranching fractions of $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c\\to\\Lambda\ne^+\\nu_e)=0.0380(19)_{\\rm LQCD\\:\\:}(11)_{\\tau_{\\Lambda_c}}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_c\\to\\Lambda \\mu^+\\nu_\\mu)=0.0369(19)_{\\rm\nLQCD\\:\\:}(11)_{\\tau_{\\Lambda_c}}$. These results are consistent with, and two\ntimes more precise than, the measurements performed recently by the BESIII\nCollaboration. Using instead the measured branching fractions together with the\nlattice calculation to determine the CKM matrix element gives $|V_{cs}|=\n0.949(24)_{\\rm LQCD\\:\\:}(14)_{\\tau_{\\Lambda_c}}(49)_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n", "  We propose a model for radiatively generating the hierarchy of the Standard\nModel (SM) fermion masses: tree-level top quark mass; 1-loop bottom, charm, tau\nand muon masses; 2-loop masses for the light up, down and strange quarks as\nwell as for the electron; and 4-loop masses for the light active neutrinos. Our\nmodel is based on a softly-broken $S_{3}\\times Z_{2}$ discrete symmetry. Its\nscalar sector consists only of one SM Higgs doublet and three electrically\nneutral SM-singlet scalars. We do not need to invoke either electrically\ncharged scalar fields, or an extra $SU_{2L}$ scalar doublet, or the spontaneous\nbreaking of the discrete group, which are typical for other radiative models in\nthe literature. The model features a viable scalar dark matter candidate.\n", "  We study the thermal phase transitions of charged black holes in\ndimensionally continued gravity in anti-de Sitter space. We find the van der\nWaals-like phase transition in the temperature-entropy plane of the black holes\nwith spherical horizons in even dimensions, and there is no such phase\ntransition of the black holes with flat and hyperbolic geometries. Near the\ncritical inflection point, the critical exponent is computed and its value does\nnot depend on the dimension. The Maxwell equal area law is checked to be\nfulfilled in the temperature-entropy diagram for the first order phase\ntransition. In odd dimensions, there are no thermal phase transitions for the\nblack hole with any geometry of the horizon.\n", "  Two-dimensional Weyl superconductor is the most elusive member of a group of\nmaterials with Weyl fermions as low-energy excitations. Here, we propose to\nrealize this state in a heterostructure consisting of thin films of half-metal\nand spin-singlet superconductor. In particular, for the $d$-wave case, a very\nrobust two-dimensional Weyl superconductor (dWSC) is realized independent of\nthe orientation of the spontaneous magnetization of the half-metal. The\nquasiparticle spectra of the dWSC show interesting evolution with the direction\nof the magnetization, featured by a series of Lifshitz transitions in the\nzero-energy contour of the quasiparticle spectrum. For a general magnetization\norientation of the half-metal, the state is a combination of a superconducting\ncomponent and a normal fluid component and is different from all known forms of\npairings. In addition, we find a transition between type-I and type-II Weyl\nnodes. This is also the first example of a type-II Weyl node in the presence of\nsuperconducting correlation. The symmetries and topological properties of the\nsystem are analyzed. We also study the phases in the heterostructure with the\nhalf-metal replaced by a ferromagnetic metal with a partially spin-polarized\nFermi surface.\n", "  We discuss the uniqueness of the static black hole in the Einstein gravity\nwith a conformally coupled scalar field. In particular, we prove the uniqueness\nof the region outside of the photon surface, not event horizon.\n", "  It is a common knowledge that an effective interaction of a quantum impurity\nwith an electromagnetic field can be screened by surrounding charge carriers,\nwhether mobile or static. Here we demonstrate that very strong, `anomalous'\nscreening can take place in the presence of a neutral, weakly-polarizable\nenvironment, due to an exchange of orbital angular momentum between the\nimpurity and the bath. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to generalize\nall phenomena related to isolated impurities in an external field to the case\nwhen a many-body environment is present, by casting the problem in terms of the\nangulon quasiparticle. As a result, the relevant observables such as the\neffective Rabi frequency, geometric phase, and impurity spatial alignment are\nstraightforward to evaluate in terms of a single parameter: the\nangular-momentum-dependent screening factor.\n", "  A non-relativistic system such as an ultracold trapped ion may perform a\nquantum simulation of a Dirac equation dynamics under specific conditions. The\nresulting Hamiltonian and dynamics are highly controllable, but the coupling\nbetween momentum and internal levels poses some difficulties to manipulate the\ninternal states accurately in wave packets. We use invariants of motion to\ninverse engineer robust population inversion processes with a homogeneous,\ntime-dependent simulated electric field. This exemplifies the usefulness of\ninverse-engineering techniques to improve the performance of quantum simulation\nprotocols.\n", "  We calculate the Josephson current density j(phi) for a Weyl\nsuperconductor--normal-metal--superconductor junction for which the outer\nterminals are superconducting Weyl metals and the normal layer is a Weyl\n(semi)metal. We describe the Weyl (semi)metal using a simple model with two\nWeyl points. The model has broken time-reveresal symmetry, but inversion\nsymmetry is present. We calculate the Josephson current for both zero and\nfinite temperature for the two pairing mechanisms inside the superconductors\nthat have been proposed in the literature, zero-momentum BCS-like pairing and\nfinite-momentum FFLO-like pairing, and assuming the short-junction limit. For\nboth pairing types we find that the current is proportional to the normal-state\njunction conductivity, with a proportionality coefficient that shows\nquantitative differences between the two pairing mechanisms. The current for\nthe BCS-like pairing is found to be independent of the chemical potential,\nwhereas the current for the FFLO-like pairing is not.\n", "  Controlling the nonlinear optical (NLO) response properties at the molecular\nlevel is a key to develop strong NLO active materials for technological\napplications. In this paper, we report quantum chemical investigation of NLO\nresponse properties of select aryl-substituted Boron-Dipyrromethene (BODIPY)\ndyes, a class of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) probes. Density\nfunctional theory (DFT) with long-range corrected CAM-B3LYP functional and\ncc-pVTZ, 6-31G(d,p) and 6-31+G(d,p) basis sets are employed to compute the\nelectronic structures and NLO response of the aforesaid molecules. Calculations\nat the second order M{\\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) level of theory are\nperformed for comparison. The results suggest that the charge transfer process\nin these molecules is mostly unidirectional and the total first\nhyperpolarizability (\\b{eta}total) values of these molecules are dominantly\ndictated by the response in the direction of charge transfer. Alteration of\nconjugation strength through donor/acceptor substitution as well as twisting of\nthe phenyl ring obtained through incorporation of methyl groups affect the NLO\nresponse of thesemolecules. The vector components of first hyperpolarizability\n(\\b{eta}vec) of the probe molecules are also studied to analyze the angle\nbetween the vector components of \\b{eta}vec and the dipole moment vector. The\nresults presented here are expected to shed light on the origin of NLO response\nof several aryl-substituted BODIPY dyes and provide means to optimizing it for\nfuture technological applications.\n", "  Many-body systems with chiral fermions can exhibit novel transport phenomena\nthat violate parity and time reversal symmetries, such as the chiral magnetic\neffect, the anomalous Hall effect, and the anomalous generation of charge.\nBased on the Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics, we examine some\nelectromagnetic and optical properties of such systems including the\nelectrostatics, the magnetostatics, the propagation of electromagnetic waves,\nthe novel optical effects, etc.\n", "  In this paper using the Clifford bundle formalism we show how starting from\nthe photon concept and its relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE) we\nimmediately get (with a simple hypothesis concerning the form of the photon\ncanonical momentum) Maxwell equation (ME) satisfied by a null $2$-form field\n$\\boldsymbol{F}$ which is a plane wave solution (PWS) of ME. Moreover, we show\nhow introducing a potential $1$-form $\\boldsymbol{A}$ such that\n$\\boldsymbol{F}=d\\boldsymbol{A}$ we can see how a duality rotation changed in a\n\\ spatial rotation transformation besides showing how $\\mathrm{i}=\\sqrt{-1}$\nenters Maxwell theory thus permitting the writing of a representative of ME as\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger like equation which plays a key role in answering one of the\nmain questions addressed in this paper, namely: is there any sense in talking\nabout photon trajectories in de Broglie-Bohm like theories? To this end we\ninvestigate first the nature of the energy-momentum \\emph{extensor} field of\nthe Maxwell field $\\mathbf{T}(n)$ in some special situations showing that for\nsome of those cases $\\mathbf{T}_{0}=\\mathbf{T}(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{0})$ even\ncannot describe the flow of energy. A proposed solution is offered. We also\nprove that there exists a pulse reshaping phenomenon even in vacuum. Finally we\ndiscuss the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation for a photon that follows from quantum\nfield theory and investigate solutions that some authors think imply in photon\nlocalization. We discuss if such an idea is meaningful. Moreover, we show that\nfor such solutions it is possible (once we accept that photon wave functions\nare extended in the space and also in the time domains) to derive a generalized\nHJE containing a quantum potential and which may lead to non lightlike photon\ntrajectories in free space. We briefly discuss our findings in relation to a\nrecent experiment.\n", "  Thermal batteries based on a reversible adsorption-desorption of a working\nfluid rather than the conventional vapor compression is a promising alternative\nto exploit waste thermal energy for heat reallocation. In this context, there\nis an increasing interest to find novel porous solids able to adsorb a high\nenergy density of working fluid under low relative vapor pressure condition\ncombined with an easy ability of regeneration (desorption) at low temperature,\nwhich are the major requirements for adsorption driven heat pumps and chillers.\nThe porous crystalline hybrid materials named Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF)\nrepresent a great source of inspiration for sorption based-applications owing\nto their tunable chemical and topological features associated with a large\nvariability of pore sizes. Recently, we have designed a new MOF (named\nMIL-160), isostructural do CAU-10, built from the assembly of corner sharing\naluminum chains octahedra AlO4(OH)2 with the 2,5-furandicarboxylic linker\nsubstituting the pristine organic linker, 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate. This ligand\nreplacement strategy proved to enhance both the hydrophilicity of the MOF and\nits amount of water adsorbed at low p-p0. This designed solid was synthesized\nand its chemical stability/adsorption performances verified. Here, we have\nextended this study by incorporating other polar heterocyclic linkers and a\ncomparative computational study of the water adsorption performances of these\nnovel structures has been performed. To that purpose, the cell and geometry\noptimizations of all hypothetical frameworks were first performed at the\ndensity functional theory level and their water adsorption isotherms were\nfurther predicted by using force-field based Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo\nsimulations. This study reveals the ease tunable water affinity of MOF for the\ndesired application.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of the stellar\npopulation and the present-day mass function (PDMF) of the Westerlund 2 (Wd2)\nregion using the data from our high resolution multi-band survey with the\nHubble Space Telescope. We used state-of-the-art artificial star tests to\ndetermine spatially resolved completeness maps for each of the broad-band\nfilters. We reach a level of completeness of 50 % down to F555W=24.8 mag (0.7\n$M_\\odot$) and F814W=23.3 mag (0.2 $M_\\odot$) in the optical and F125W=20.2 mag\nand F160W=19.4 mag (both 0.12 $M_\\odot$) in the infrared throughout the field\nof view. We had previously reported that the core of Wd2 consists of two\nclumps: namely the main cluster (MC) and the northern clump (NC). From the\nspatial distribution of the completeness corrected population, we find that\ntheir stellar surface densities are 1114 stars pc$^{-2}$ and 555 stars\npc$^{-2}$, respectively, down to F814W=21.8 mag. We find that the present-day\nmass function (PDMF) of Wd2 has a slope of $\\Gamma=-1.46 \\pm 0.06$, which\ntranslates to a total stellar cluster mass of $(3.6 \\pm 0.3) \\cdot 10^4\nM_\\odot$. The spatial analysis of the PDMF reveals that the cluster population\nis mass-segregated, most likely primordial. In addition, we report the\ndetection of a stellar population of spatially uniformly distributed low-mass\n(<0.15 $M_\\odot$) stars, extending into the gas ridges of the surrounding gas\nand dust cloud, as well as a confined region of reddened stars, likely caused\nby a foreground CO cloud. We find hints that a cloud-cloud collision might be\nthe origin of the formation of Wd2.\n", "  We propose an explicit mathematical construction and plausibility arguments\nfor how spacetime chirality and Lorentz generators emerge for minimal,\noff-shell 4D, $\\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets by use of a 4.4.4.4 tesselation of\nRiemann surfaces based on plaquettes originating from Coxeter Group BC${}_4$\nadinkras.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of a general contagion model where nodes are\neither active (e.g. with opinion A, or functioning) or inactive (e.g. with\nopinion B, or damaged). The transitions between these two states are determined\nby (i) spontaneous transitions independent of the neighborhood, (ii)\ntransitions induced by neighboring nodes and (iii) spontaneous reverse\ntransitions. The resulting dynamics is extremely rich including limit cycles\nand random phase switching. We derive a unifying mean-field theory.\nSpecifically, we analytically show that the critical behavior of systems whose\ndynamics is governed by processes (i-iii) can only exhibit three distinct\nregimes: (a) uncorrelated spontaneous transition dynamics (b) contact process\ndynamics and (c) cusp catastrophes. This ends a long-standing debate on the\nuniversality classes of complex contagion dynamics in mean-field and\nsubstantially deepens its mathematical understanding.\n", "  Following the selection of The Gravitational Universe by ESA, and the\nsuccessful flight of LISA Pathfinder, the LISA Consortium now proposes a 4 year\nmission in response to ESA's call for missions for L3. The observatory will be\nbased on three arms with six active laser links, between three identical\nspacecraft in a triangular formation separated by 2.5 million km.\n  LISA is an all-sky monitor and will offer a wide view of a dynamic cosmos\nusing Gravitational Waves as new and unique messengers to unveil The\nGravitational Universe. It provides the closest ever view of the infant\nUniverse at TeV energy scales, has known sources in the form of verification\nbinaries in the Milky Way, and can probe the entire Universe, from its smallest\nscales near the horizons of black holes, all the way to cosmological scales.\nThe LISA mission will scan the entire sky as it follows behind the Earth in its\norbit, obtaining both polarisations of the Gravitational Waves simultaneously,\nand will measure source parameters with astrophysically relevant sensitivity in\na band from below $10^{-4}\\,$Hz to above $10^{-1}\\,$Hz.\n", "  In order to carry out research in the field of possible existence of a\nsterile neutrino the laboratory based on SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia)\nwas created to search for oscillations of reactor antineutrino. A moveable\ndetector, protected with passive shielding from outer radiation, can be set at\ndistance range 6 to 12 meters from the reactor core. Measurements of\nantineutrino flux at such short distances from the reactor core are carried out\nwith moveable detector for the first time. The main difficulties of the\nmeasurements caused by cosmic background and it heavily decreases the precision\nof measurements. We present the analysis of measurements at small distances\ntogether with the data obtained in measurements at long distances in order to\nobtain parameters of sterile neutrino.\n", "  We present the crystal structure and magnetic properties of\nY$_{3}$Cu$_{9}$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_{8}$, a stoichiometric frustrated quantum spin\nsystem with slightly distorted kagome layers. Single crystals of\nY$_{3}$Cu$_{9}$(OH)$_{19}$Cl$_{8}$ were grown under hydrothermal conditions.\nThe structure was determined from single crystal X-ray diffraction and\nconfirmed by neutron powder diffraction. The observed structure reveals two\ndifferent Cu-positions leading to a slightly distored kagome layer in contrast\nto the closely related YCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{3}$. Curie-Weiss behavior at\nhigh-temperatures with a Weiss-temperature $\\theta_{W}$ of the order of $-100$\nK, shows a large dominant antiferromagnetic coupling within the kagome planes.\nSpecific-heat and magnetization measurements on single crystals reveal an\nantiferromagnetic transition at T$_{N}=2.2$ K indicating a pronounced\nfrustration parameter of $\\theta_{W}/T_{N}\\approx50$. Optical transmission\nexperiments on powder samples and single crystals confirm the structural\nfindings. Specific-heat measurements on YCu$_{3}$(OH)$_{6}$Cl$_{3}$ down to 0.4\nK confirm the proposed quantum spin-liquid state of that system. Therefore, the\ntwo Y-Cu-OH-Cl compounds present a unique setting to investigate closely\nrelated structures with a spin-liquid state and a strongly frustrated AFM\nordered state, by slightly releasing the frustration in a kagome lattice.\n", "  We investigate both analytically and by numerical simulation the relaxation\nof an overdamped Brownian particle in a 1D multiwell potential. We show that\nthe mean relaxation time from an injection point inside the well down to its\nbottom is dominated by statistically rare trajectories that sample the\npotential profile outside the well. As a consequence, also the hopping time\nbetween two degenerate wells can depend on the detailed multiwell structure of\nthe entire potential. The nonlocal nature of the transitions between two states\nof a disordered landscape is important for the correct interpretation of the\nrelaxation rates in complex chemical-physical systems, measured either through\nnumerical simulations or experimental techniques.\n", "  In this work, a many-body potential of Nb for radiation damage simulation was\ndeveloped based on EAM, and most of the point defects of Nb can be predicted\nproperly by this potential. By using the constructed potential, the\ndirection-specific threshold displacement energies (TDE) and displacement\ncascades up to 20 keV of Nb were performed through molecular dynamics\nsimulations. The calculated results of TDE are in good agreement with previous\nwork for V, Mo and experimental measurements. Lowest TDE was found in <100>\ndirection, and local minas of TDE were found in three low-index directions,\nwhich has relation: Ed[100]<Ed[111]<Ed[110]. The evolution of displacement\ncascades, number of the created point defects, the cascade efficiency the\nclustering of point defects, and temperature role of these parameters at\ndifferent PKA energies were systematic investigated. It is found that the\ncascade efficiency is low and it is can be fitted by a power function as many\npublished work did. The fraction of clustered point defects obtained in this\nwork is low, and only some small clusters were formed at the end of thermal\nspike. As the temperature increases, the productions of point defects and\ncascade efficiency were somewhat decreases, however, the fraction of clustered\npoint defects decreases more obvious.\n", "  The modification of hard jets in the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) is studied\nusing the MATTER event generator. Based on the higher twist formalism of energy\nloss, the MATTER event generator simulates the evolution of highly virtual\npartons through a medium. These partons sampled from an underlying PYTHIA\nkernel undergo splitting through a combination of vacuum and medium induced\nemission. The momentum exchange with the medium is simulated via the jet\ntransport coefficient $\\hat{q}$, which is assumed to scale with the entropy\ndensity at a given location in the medium. The entropy density is obtained from\na relativistic viscous fluid dynamics simulation (VISH2+1D) in 2+1 space time\ndimensions. Results for jet and hadron observables are presented using an\nindependent fragmentation model. These proceedings will focus on the physics\ninput and simulation details of the MATTER event generator as compared to a\nvariety of test observables.\n", "  We propose an optical parallel computation similar to quantum computation\nthat can be realized by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into classical\noptical fields with two orthogonal modes. Based on the pseudorandom phase\nsequences, we first propose a theoretical framework of \"phase ensemble model\"\nreferring from the concept of quantum ensemble. Using the ensemble model, we\nfurther demonstrate the inseparability of the fields similar to quantum\nentanglement. It is interesting that a N2^N dimensional Hilbert space spanned\nby N optical fields is larger than that spanned by N quantum particles. This\nleads a problem for our scheme that is not the lack of resources but the\nredundancy of resources. In order to reduce the redundancy, we propose a\nspecial sequence permutation mechanism to efficiently imitate certain quantum\nstates, including the product state, Bell states, GHZ state and W state. For\nbetter fault tolerance, we further devise each orthogonal mode of optical\nfields is measured to assign discrete values. Finally, we propose a generalized\ngate array model to imitate some quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm,\nGrover's algorithm and quantum Fourier algorithm. The research on the optical\nparallel computation might be important, for it not only has the potential\nbeyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into fundamental\nconcepts of quantum mechanics.\n", "  This note discusses methods of particle reconstruction in the forward region\ndetectors of future e+e- linear colliders such as ILC or CLIC. At the nominal\nluminosity the innermost electromagnetic calorimeters undergo high particle\nfluxes from the beam-induced background. In this prospect, different methods of\nthe background simulation and signal electron reconstruction are described.\n", "  The scintillation properties of a $\\mathrm{CdMoO_4}$ crystal have been\ninvestigated experimentally. The fluorescence yields and decay times measured\nfrom 22 K to 300 K demonstrate that $\\mathrm{CdMoO_4}$ crystal is a good\ncandidate for an absorber for a bolometer readout, for both heat and\nscintillation signals. The results from Monte Carlo studies taking the\nbackgrounds from $\\mathrm{2\\nu2\\beta}$ of $\\mathrm{{}_{42}^{100}Mo}$\n($\\mathrm{{}_{48}^{116}Cd}$) and internal trace nuclides $\\mathrm{{}^{214}Bi}$\nand $\\mathrm{{}^{208}Tl}$ into account show that the expected sensitivity of\n$\\mathrm{CdMoO_4}$ bolometer for neutrinoless double beta decay experiment with\nan exposure of 100 $\\mathrm{{kg}\\cdot{years}}$ is one order of magnitude higher\nthan those of the current sets of the $\\mathrm{\\lim{T^{0\\nu\\beta\\beta}_{1/2}}}$\nof $\\mathrm{{}_{42}^{100}Mo}$ and $\\mathrm{{}_{48}^{116}Cd}$.\n", "  We estimate the mass of the compact object in the gamma-ray binaries\nLSI+61303 and MWC 148, using the latest data for the inclination, orbital\nmotion and assuming that the orbital plane coincides with the equatorial plane\nof the Be star. For LSI+61303 we find the mass of the compact object to be most\nlikely in the range 1.3 M_sun < M_2 < 2.0 M_sun, which means that it is\nprobably a neutron star. For MWC 148, we find the mass of the compact object in\na higher range, 2.1 M_sum < M_2 < 7.3 M_sun, which increases the chances for\nthis system to host a black hole companion.\n", "  We analyze the V-band photometry data of the Be star omega CMa, observed\nduring the last four decades. The data is fitted by hydrodynamic models based\non the viscous decretion disk (VDD) theory, in which a disk around a\nfast-spinning Be star is formed by material ejected by the central star and\ndriven to progressively wider orbits by means of viscous torques. For the first\ntime, we apply the model for both the disk build up and the dissipation phases.\nOur simulations offer a good description of the photometric variability in both\nphases, which suggests that the VDD model adequately describes the disk\nstructural evolution. Furthermore, our analysis allowed us to determine the\nviscosity parameter (alpha) of the gas, as well as the net mass loss rate. We\nfind that alpha is variable, ranging from 0.1 to 1.0, and that build up phases\nhave larger values of alpha than the dissipation phases. Additionally, we find\nthat, contrary to what is generally assumed, even during quiescence the outward\nmass flux is never zero, suggesting that the star alternates between a high\nmass-loss phase (outburst) and a low mass-loss phase (quiescence).\n", "  The particular type of four-kink multi-solitons (or quadrons) adiabatic\ndynamics of the sine-Gordon equation in a model with two identical point\nattracting impurities has been studied. This model can be used for describing\nmagnetization localized waves in multilayer ferromagnet. The quadrons structure\nand properties has been numerically investigated. The cases of both large and\nsmall distances between impurities has been viewed. The dependence of the\nlocalized in impurity region nonlinear high-amplitude waves frequencies on the\ndistance between the impurities has been found. For an analytical description\nof two bound localized on impurities nonlinear waves dynamics, using\nperturbation theory, the system of differential equations for harmonic\noscillators with elastic link has been found. The analytical model\nqualitatively describes the results of the sine-Gordon equation numerical\nsimulation.\n", "  Many proposals for fault-tolerant quantum computation require injection of\n'magic states' to achieve a universal set of operations. Some qubit states are\nabove a threshold fidelity, allowing them to be converted into magic states via\n'magic state distillation', a process based on stabilizer codes from quantum\nerror correction.\n  We define quantum weight enumerators that take into account the sign of the\nstabilizer operators. These enumerators completely describe the magic state\ndistillation behavior when distilling T-type magic states. While it is\nstraightforward to calculate them directly by counting exponentially many\noperator weights, it is also an NP-hard problem to compute them in general.\nThis suggests that finding a family of distillation schemes with desired\nthreshold properties is at least as hard as finding the weight distributions of\na family of classical codes.\n  Additionally, we develop search algorithms fast enough to analyze all useful\n5 qubit codes and some 7 qubit codes, finding no codes that surpass the best\nknown threshold.\n", "  The paper deals with Hawking radiation from both a general static black hole\nand a nonstatic spherically symmetric black hole. In case of static black hole,\ntunnelling of nonzero mass particles is considered and due to complicated\ncalculations, quantum corrections are calculated only up to the first order.\nThe results are compared with those for massless particles near the horizon. On\nthe other hand, for dynamical black hole, quantum corrections are incorporated\nusing the Hamilton-Jacobi method beyond semiclassical approximation. It is\nfound that different order correction terms satisfy identical differential\nequation and are solved by a typical technique. Finally, using the law of black\nhole mechanics, a general modified form of the black hole entropy is obtained\nconsidering modified Hawking temperature.\n", "  Process-related and stress-induced changes in threshold voltage are major\nvariability concerns in ultra-scaled CMOS transistors. The device designers\nconsider this variability as an irreducible part of the design problem and use\ndifferent circuit level optimization schemes to handle these variations. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate how an increase in the negative steepness of the\nuniversal mobility relationship improves both the process-related (e.g., oxide\nthickness fluctuation, gate work-function fluctuation), as well as\nstress-induced or reliability-related (e.g., Bias Temperature Instability or\nBTI) parametric variation in CMOS technology. Therefore, we calibrate the\nuniversal mobility parameters to reflect the measured variation of negative\nsteepness in uniaxially strained CMOS transistor. This allows us to study the\nextent of (process-related and stress-induced parametric) variation resilience\nin uniaxial strain technology by increasing the negative steepness of the\nmobility characteristics. Thus, we show that variability analysis in strained\nCMOS technology must consider the presence of self-compensation between\nmobility variation and threshold voltage variation, which leads to considerable\namount of variation resilience. Finally, we use detailed circuit simulation to\nstress the importance of accurate mobility variation modeling in SPICE analysis\nand explain why the variability concerns in strained technology may be less\nsevere than those in unstrained technology.\n", "  We describe nonlinear Bessel vortex beams as localized and stationary\nsolutions with embedded vorticity to the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with\na dissipative term that accounts for the multi-photon absorption processes\ntaking place at high enough powers in common optical media. In these beams,\npower and orbital angular momentum are permanently transferred to matter in the\ninner, nonlinear rings, at the same time that they are refueled by spiral\ninward currents of energy and angular momentum coming from the outer linear\nrings, acting as an intrinsic reservoir. Unlike vortex solitons and dissipative\nvortex solitons, the existence of these vortex beams does not critically depend\non the precise form of the dispersive nonlinearities, as Kerr self-focusing or\nself-defocusing, and do not require a balancing gain. They have been shown to\nplay a prominent role in \"tubular\" filamentation experiments with powerful,\nvortex-carrying Bessel beams, where they act as attractors in the beam\npropagation dynamics. Nonlinear Bessel vortex beams provide indeed a new\nsolution to the problem of the stable propagation of ring-shaped vortex light\nbeams in homogeneous self-focusing Kerr media. A stability analysis\ndemonstrates that there exist nonlinear Bessel vortex beams with single or\nmultiple vorticity that are stable against azimuthal breakup and collapse, and\nthat the mechanism that renders these vortexes stable is dissipation. The\nstability properties of nonlinear Bessel vortex beams explain the experimental\nobservations in the tubular filamentation experiments.\n", "  We study pretty good quantum state transfer (i.e., state transfer that\nbecomes arbitrarily close to perfect) between vertices of graphs with an\ninvolution in the presence of an energy potential. In particular, we show that\nif a graph has an involution that fixes at least one vertex or at least one\nedge, then there exists a choice of potential on the vertex set of the graph\nfor which we get pretty good state transfer between symmetric vertices of the\ngraph. We show further that in many cases, the potential can be chosen so that\nit is only non-zero at the vertices between which we want pretty good state\ntransfer. As a special case of this, we show that such a potential can be\nchosen on the endpoints of a path to induce pretty good state transfer in paths\nof any length. This is in contrast to the result of [6], in which the authors\nshow that there cannot be perfect state transfer in paths of length 4 or more,\nno matter what potential is chosen.\n", "  The TRAPPIST-1 system offers the opportunity to characterize terrestrial,\npotentially habitable planets orbiting a nearby ultracool dwarf star. We\nperformed a four-orbit reconnaissance with the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to study the stellar emission\nat Lyman-$\\alpha$, to assess the presence of hydrogen exospheres around the two\ninner planets, and to determine their UV irradiation. We detect the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ line of TRAPPIST-1, making it the coldest exoplanet host star\nfor which this line has been measured. We reconstruct the intrinsic line\nprofile, showing that it lacks broad wings and is much fainter than expected\nfrom the stellar X-ray emission. TRAPPIST-1 has a similar X-ray emission as\nProxima Cen but a much lower Ly-$\\alpha$ emission. This suggests that\nTRAPPIST-1 chromosphere is only moderately active compared to its transition\nregion and corona. We estimated the atmospheric mass loss rates for all\nplanets, and found that despite a moderate extreme UV emission the total XUV\nirradiation could be strong enough to strip the atmospheres of the inner\nplanets in a few billions years. We detect marginal flux decreases at the times\nof TRAPPIST-1b and c transits, which might originate from stellar activity, but\ncould also hint at the presence of extended hydrogen exospheres. Understanding\nthe origin of these Lyman-$\\alpha$ variations will be crucial in assessing the\natmospheric stability and potential habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.\n", "  This work establishes the Anderson localization in both the spectral\nexponential and the strong dynamical localization for the multi-particle\nAnderson tight-binding model with correlated but strongly mixing random\nexternal potential. The results are obtained near the lower edge of the\nspectrum of the multi-particle Hamiltonian. In particular, the exponential\ndecay of the eigenfunctions is proved in the max-norm and the dynamical\nlocalization in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. The proofs need the conditional\nprobability distribution function of the random external stochastic processes\nto obey the uniform log-H\\\"older continuity condition.\n", "  We present a simple layout of a fast cooling system for liquids in sealed\ncontainers utilizing the large temperature gradients of cold nitrogen gas. Our\nsystem is optimized for about 20 cylindrical containers of 500 cm3 but the\nsetup allows for simple up- and downscaling as well as the use of arbitrary\ncontainers. We have characterized the cooling performance of our system\nexperimentally for liquid temperatures in the range from room temperature down\nto the freezing point at ~ -2 {\\deg}C. With our system we achieve container\ncooling times as low as 3 min, a significant reduction if compared to cooling\ntimes with common methods in the range of 8 to 40 min. Modeling of the cooling\nprocess proves that convection within the liquid is crucial for quick heat\ntransfer and that the most important factor limiting the cooling rate is the\nthermal conductivity of the container material.\n", "  The present works deals with gravitational collapse of cylindrical viscous\nheat conducting anisotropic fluid following the work of Misner and Sharp. Using\nDarmois matching conditions, the dynamical equations are derived and the effect\nof charge and dissipative quantities over the cylindrical collapse are\nanalyzed. Finally, using the Miller-Israel-Steward causal thermodynamic theory,\nthe transport equation for heat flux are derived and its influence on\ncollapsing system has been studied.\n", "  The discovery of gravitational waves by the international collaboration LIGO\n(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory)/Virgo on the one hand is\na triumphant confirmation of the general theory of relativity, and on the other\nconfirms the general fundamental ideas on the nuclear evolution of baryon\nmatter in the Universe concentrated in binary stars. LIGO/Virgo may turn out to\nbe the first experiment in the history of physics to detect two physical\nentities, gravitational waves and black holes\n", "  The purpose of this short contribution is to report on the development of a\nSpectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP) for tungsten. We have focused on\nthe characterization of elastic and defect properties of the pure material in\norder to support molecular dynamics simulations of plasma-facing materials in\nfusion reactors. A parallel genetic algorithm approach was used to efficiently\nsearch for fitting parameters optimized against a large number of objective\nfunctions. In addition, we have shown that this many-body tungsten potential\ncan be used in conjunction with a simple helium pair potential to produce\naccurate defect formation energies for the W-He binary system.\n", "  There is an ongoing debate in the literature about whether the present global\nwarming is increasing local and global temperature variability. The central\nmethodological issues of this debate relate to the proper treatment of\nnormalised temperature anomalies and trends in the studied time series which\nmay be difficult to separate from time-evolving fluctuations. Some argue that\ntemperature variability is indeed increasing globally, whereas others conclude\nit is decreasing or remains practically unchanged. Meanwhile, a consensus\nappears to emerge that local variability in certain regions (e.g. Western\nEurope and North America) has indeed been increasing in the past 40 years. Here\nwe investigate the nature of connections between external forcing and climate\nvariability conceptually by using a laboratory-scale minimal model of\nmid-latitude atmospheric thermal convection subject to continuously decreasing\n`equator-to-pole' temperature contrast, mimicking climate change. The analysis\nof temperature records from an ensemble of experimental runs (`realisations')\nall driven by identical time-dependent external forcing reveals that the\ncollective variability of the ensemble and that of individual realisations may\nbe markedly different -- a property to be considered when interpreting climate\nrecords.\n", "  Accurate modeling of light scattering from nanometer scale defects on Silicon\nwafers is critical for enabling increasingly shrinking semiconductor technology\nnodes of the future. Yet, such modeling of defect scattering remains unsolved\nsince existing modeling techniques fail to account for complex defect and wafer\ngeometries. Here, we present results of laser beam scattering from spherical\nand ellipsoidal particles located on the surface of a silicon wafer. A\ncommercially available electromagnetic field solver (HFSS) was deployed on a\nmultiprocessor cluster to obtain results with previously unknown accuracy down\nto light scattering intensity of -170 dB. We compute three dimensional\nscattering patterns of silicon nanospheres located on a semiconductor wafer for\nboth perpendicular and parallel polarization and show the effect of sphere size\non scattering. We further computer scattering patterns of nanometer scale\nellipsoidal particles having different orientation angles and unveil the\neffects of ellipsoidal orientation on scattering.\n", "  Properties of planetary atmospheres, ionospheres, and magnetospheres are\ndifficult to measure from Earth. Radio occultations are a common method for\nmeasuring these properties, but they traditionally rely on radio transmissions\nfrom a spacecraft near the planet. Here we explore whether occultations of\nradio emissions from a distant astrophysical radio source can be used to\nmeasure magnetic field strength, plasma density, and neutral density around\nplanets. In a theoretical case study of Jupiter, we find that significant\nchanges in polarization angle due to Faraday rotation occur for radio signals\nthat pass within 10 Jupiter radii of the planet and that significant changes in\nfrequency and power occur from radio signals that pass through the neutral\natmosphere. There are sufficient candidate radio sources, such as pulsars,\nactive galactic nuclei, and masers, that occultations are likely to occur at\nleast once per year. For pulsars, time delays in the arrival of their emitted\npulses can be used to measure plasma density. Exoplanets, whose physical\nproperties are very challenging to observe, may also occult distant\nastrophysical radio sources, such as their parent stars.\n", "  Morphology and its stability are essential features to address\nphysicochemical properties of metallic nanoparticles. By means of Molecular\nDynamics based simulations we show a complex dependence on the size and\nmaterial of common structural mechanisms taking place in mono-metallic\nnanoparticles at icosahedral magic sizes. We show that the well known Lipscomb\ns Diamond Square Diamond mechanisms, single step screw dislocation motions of\nthe whole cluster, take place only below a given size which is material\ndependent. Above that size, layer by layer dislocations and/or surface peeling\nare likely to happen, leading to low symmetry defected motifs. The material\ndependence of this critical size is similar to the crossover sizes among\nstructural motifs, based on the ration between the bulk modulus and atomic\ncohesive energy.\n", "  Optical detection back-action in cantilever resonant or static detection\npresents a challenge when striving for state-of-the-art performance. The origin\nand possible routes for minimizing optical back-action have received little\nattention in literature. Here, we investigate the position and mode dependent\noptical back-action on cantilever beam resonators. A high power heating laser\n(100 {\\mu}W) is scanned across a silicon nitride cantilever while its effect on\nthe first three resonance modes is detected via a low-power readout laser (1\n{\\mu}W) positioned at the cantilever tip. We find that the measured effect of\nback-action is not only dependent on position but also the shape of the\nresonance mode. Relevant silicon nitride material parameters are extracted by\nfitting the temperature-dependent frequency response of the first three modes\nto finite element (FE) simulations. In a second round of simulations, using the\nextracted parameters, we successfully fit the FEM results with the measured\nmode and position dependent back-action. Finally, different routes for\nminimizing the effect of this optical detection back-action are described,\nallowing further improvements of cantilever-based sensing in general.\n", "  We derive a new time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation(TDSE) for quantum\nmodels with non-hermitian Hamiltonian. Within our theory, the TDSE is symmetric\nin the two Hilbert spaces spanned by the left and the right eigenstates,\nrespectively. The physical quantities are also identical in these two spaces.\nBased on this TDSE, we show that exchanging two quasi-particles in a\nnon-hermitian model can generate arbitrary geometric phase. The system can also\nviolate the Lieb-Robinson bound in non-relativistic quantum mechanics so that\nan action in one place will immediately cause a change in the distance. We show\nthat the above two surprising behaviors can also appear in anyonic model, which\nmakes us propose that the non-hermitian single particle model may possess many\ncommon features with anyonic model.\n", "  The studying of anomalous diffusion by pulsed field gradient (PFG) diffusion\ntechnique still faces challenges. Two different research groups have proposed\nmodified Bloch equation for anomalous diffusion. However, these equations have\ndifferent forms and, therefore, yield inconsistent results. The discrepancy in\nthese reported modified Bloch equations may arise from different ways of\ncombining the fractional diffusion equation with the precession equation where\nthe time derivatives have different derivative orders and forms. Moreover, to\nthe best of my knowledge, the general PFG signal attenuation expression\nincluding finite gradient pulse width (FGPW) effect for time-space fractional\ndiffusion based on the fractional derivative has yet to be reported by other\nmethods. Here, based on different combination strategy, two new modified Bloch\nequations are proposed, which belong to two significantly different types: a\ndifferential type based on the fractal derivative and an integral type based on\nthe fractional derivative. The merit of the integral type modified Bloch\nequation is that the original properties of the contributions from linear or\nnonlinear processes remain unchanged at the instant of the combination. The\ngeneral solutions including the FGPW effect were derived from these two\nequations as well as from two other methods: a method observing the signal\nintensity at the origin and the recently reported effective phase shift\ndiffusion equation method. The relaxation effect was also considered. It is\nfound that the relaxation behavior influenced by fractional diffusion based on\nthe fractional derivative deviates from that of normal diffusion. The general\nsolution agrees perfectly with continuous-time random walk (CTRW) simulations\nas well as reported literature results. The new modified Bloch equations is a\nvaluable tool to describe PFG anomalous diffusion in NMR and MRI.\n", "  We present a mean-photon-number dependent variational method, which works\nwell in whole coupling regime if the photon energy is dominant over the\nspin-flipping, to evaluate the properties of the Rabi model for both the ground\nstate and the excited states. For the ground state, it is shown that the\nprevious approximate methods, the generalized rotating-wave approximation (only\nworking well in the strong coupling limit) and the generalized variational\nmethod (only working well in the weak coupling limit), can be recovered in the\ncorresponding coupling limits. The key point of our method is to tailor the\nmerits of these two existing methods by introducing a mean-photon-number\ndependent variational parameter. For the excited states,our method yields\nconsiderable improvements over the generalized rotating-wave approximation. The\nvariational method proposed could be readily applied to the more complex\nmodels, for which an analytic formula is difficult to be formulated.\n", "  In the early sixties Leonard Parker discovered that the expansion of the\nuniverse can create particles out of the vacuum, opening a new and fruitfull\nfield in physics. We give a historical review in the form of an interview that\ntook place during the Conference ERE2014 (Valencia 1-5, September, 2014).\n", "  We consider some complex-valued solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations in\n$R^{3}$ for which Li and Sinai proved a finite time blow-up. We show that there\nare two types of solutions, with different divergence rates, and report results\nof computer simulations, which give a detailed picture of the blow-up for both\ntypes. They reveal in particular important features not, as yet, predicted by\nthe theory, such as a concentration of the energy and the enstrophy around a\nfew singular points, while elsewhere the \"fluid\" remains quiet.\n", "  Strong magnetic field pulses associated with a relativistic electron bunch\ncan imprint switching patterns in magnetic thin films that have uniaxial\nin-plane anisotropy. In experiments with Fe and FeCo alloy films the pattern\nshape reveals an additional torque acting on magnetization during the short (in\nthe 100fs time scale) magnetic field pulse. The magnitude of the torque is as\nhigh as 15% of the torque from the magnetic field. The torque symmetry is that\nof a uniaxial anisotropy along the direction of the eddy current screening the\nmagnetic field. Spin-orbit interaction acting on the conduction electrons can\nproduce such a torque with the required symmetry and magnitude. The same\ninteraction causes the anomalous Hall current to be spin-polarized, exerting a\nback reaction on magnetization direction. Such a mechanism may be at work in\nall-optical laser switching of magnetic materials.\n", "  Landauer's principle introduces a symmetry between computational and physical\nprocesses: erasure of information, a logically irreversible operation, must be\nunderlain by an irreversible transformation dissipating energy. Monitoring\nmicro- and nano-systems needs to enter into the energetic balance of their\ncontrol; hence, finding the ultimate limits is instrumental to the development\nof future thermal machines operating at the quantum level. We report on the\nexperimental investigation of a bound to the irreversible entropy associated to\ngeneralized quantum measurements on a quantum bit. We adopted a quantum\nphotonics gate to implement a device interpolating from the weakly disturbing\nto the fully invasive and maximally informative regime. Our experiment prompted\nus to introduce a bound taking into account both the classical result of the\nmeasurement and the outcoming quantum state; unlike previous investigation, our\nnew entropic bound is based uniquely on measurable quantities. Our results\nhighlight what insights the information-theoretic approach can provide on\nbuilding blocks of quantum information processors.\n", "  In a recently published article [1], Ranga P. Dias & Isaac F. Silvera have\nreported the visual evidence of metallic hydrogen concomitantly with its\ncharacterization at a pressure of 495 GPa and low temperatures. We have\nexpressed serious doubts of such a conclusion when interviewed to comment on\nthis publication [2,3]. In the following comment, we would like to detail the\nreasons, based on experimental evidences obtained by us and by other groups\nworldwide that sustain our skepticism. We have identified two main flaws in\nthis paper, as discussed in details below: the pressure is largely\noverestimated; the origin of the sample reflectivity and the analysis of the\nreflectance can be seriously questioned.\n", "  We have computationally investigated absorption spectra of a specifically\nconfigured set of graphene-based molecules involving (1) a sp2 bare graphene\nsheet; (2) framed graphene sheets containing different chemical addends\nterminating dangling bonds of edge atoms but keeping sp2 configured basal\nplane; and (3) bulk sp3 graphene sheets resulted from the chemical modification\noccurred at not only the bare sheet circumference but at its basal plane as\nwell. Framed molecules, open-shell by nature, present different kinds of\nreduced graphene oxides and present the main building blocks of graphene\nquantum dots. Closed-shell bulk molecules present models of nanosize graphene\noxide. UHF ground states and ZINDO/S excited states of the molecules were\nanalyzed. The UHF-ZINDO/S combination is well coherent in the case of bulk\nmolecules for which UHF and RHF ground state results are identical. In the case\nof framed molecules, the incoherence of the UHF and close-shell ZINDO/S\napproaches is revealed in a considerable decreasing of the HOMO-LUMO energy\ngap, which provides unreal drastic red shift of absorption spectra of\nopen-shell molecules into IR region. The conclusion is justified by a\ncomparative analysis of calculated and experimental data on absorption and\nfluorescence spectra of graphene quantum dots and graphene oxides.\n", "  We investigate free hydromagnetic eigenmodes of an incompressible, inviscid\nand ideal electrically conducting fluid in rotating triaxial ellipsoids. The\ncontainer rotates with an angular velocity tilted from its figure. The magnetic\nbase state is a uniform current density also tilted. Three-dimensional\nperturbations upon the base state are expanded onto a finite-dimensional\npolynomial basis. By combining symbolic and numerical computations, we are able\nto get the eigenmodes of high spatial complexity. Hydromagnetic modes of the\nsphere still exist in triaxial geometry. A plane-wave analysis is also carried\non, explaining the dispersion relation observed in our model. Without magnetic\nfield, the modes reduce to the inertial modes of the ellipsoids, which form a\ncomplete basis. We propose to use these modes to study the weakly nonlinear\nsaturation of inertial instabilities, especially the elliptical one.\n", "  Thanks to the space-based photometry missions CoRoT and Kepler, we now\nbenefit from a wealth of seismic data for stars other than the sun. In the\nfuture, K2, Tess and Plato will provide further observations. The quality of\nthis data may allow kernel-based linear structural inversion techniques to be\nused for stars other than the sun. To understand the limitations of this\napproach, we analyse the validity of the linear assumption used in these\ninversion techniques. We inspect various structural pairs and see how they are\naffected by structural changes. We show that uncertainties in radius strongly\naffect structural pairs of nondimensional variables, and that various other\neffects might come into play. Amongst these, the importance of micro-physics\ngive the most striking example of how uncertainties in stellar models impact\nthe verification of the linear relations. We also point out that including\nseismic constraints in the forward modelling fit helps with satisfying the\nlinear relations.\n", "  Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are particles, likely protons and/or\nnuclei, with energies up to $10^{20}$ eV that are observed through the giant\nair showers they produce in the atmosphere. These particles carry the\ninformation on the most extreme phenomena in the Universe. At these energies,\neven charged particles could be magnetically rigid enough to keep track of, or\neven point directly to, the original positions of their sources on the sky. The\ndiscovery of anisotropy of UHECRs would thus signify opening of an entirely new\nwindow onto the Universe. With the construction and operation of the new\ngeneration of cosmic ray experiments -- the Pierre Auger Observatory in the\nSouthern hemisphere and the Telescope Array in the Northern one -- the study of\nthese particles, the most energetic ever detected, has experienced a jump in\nstatistics as well as in the data quality, allowing for a much better\nsensitivity in searching for their sources. In this review, we summarize the\nsearches for anisotropies and the efforts to identify the sources of UHECRs\nwhich have been carried out using these new data.\n", "  Anisotropic exponential cosmological solutions for a space of arbitrary\ndimension filled with ordinary matter in the 4th and 5th orders of Lovelock\ngravity are obtained. Also we have supposed a generalization of such solutions\non an arbitrary order. All the solutions are represented as a set of conditions\non Hubble parameters.\n", "  The partition function of the Penner matrix model for both positive and\nnegative values of the coupling constant can be explicitly written in terms of\nthe Barnes G function. In this paper we show that for negative values of the\ncoupling constant this partition function can also be represented as the\nproduct of an holomorphic matrix integral by a nontrivial oscillatory function\nof n. We show that the planar limit of the free energy with 't Hooft sequences\ndoes not exist. Therefore we use a certain modification that uses\nKuijlaars-McLaughlin sequences instead of 't Hooft sequences and leads to a\nwell-defined planar free energy and to an associated two-dimensional phase\nspace. We describe the different configurations of complex saddle points of the\nholomorphic matrix integral both to the left and to the right of the critical\npoint, and interpret the phase transitions in terms of processes of gap\nclosing, eigenvalue tunneling, and Bose condensation.\n", "  The first collisions of lead nuclei, delivered by the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at the end of 2010, at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, marked the beginning of a new era in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion physics. The study of the properties of the\nproduced hot and dense strongly-interacting matter at these unprecedented\nenergies is currently experimentally pursued by all four big LHC experiments,\nALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb. The more than a factor 10 increase of collision\nenergy at LHC, relative to the previously achieved maximal energy at other\ncollider facilities, results in an increase of production rates of hard probes.\nThis review presents selected experimental results focusing on observables\nprobing hard processes in heavy-ion collisions delivered during the first three\nyears of the LHC operation. It also presents the first results from Run 2\nheavy-ion data at the highest energy, as well as from the studies of the\nreference pp and pPb systems, which are an integral part of the heavy-ion\nprogramme.\n", "  The first collisions of lead nuclei, delivered by the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at the end of 2010, at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV, marked the beginning of a new era in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion physics. Following the Run 1 period, LHC also\nsuccessfully delivered PbPb collisions at the collision energy $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$\n= 5.02 TeV at the end of 2015. The study of the properties of the produced hot\nand dense strongly-interacting matter at these unprecedented energies is\nexperimentally pursued by all four big LHC experiments, ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and\nLHCb. This review presents selected experimental results from heavy-ion\ncollisions delivered during the first three years of the LHC operation focusing\non the bulk matter properties and the dynamical evolution of the created\nsystem. It also presents the first results from Run 2 heavy-ion data at the\nhighest energy, as well as from the studies of the reference pp and pPb\nsystems, which are an integral part of the heavy-ion programme.\n", "  A physical model is developed, which suggests a pathway to determining the\noptimal release conditions for a basketball free throw. Theoretical framework\nis supported by Monte Carlo simulations and a series of free throws performed\nand analysed at Southbank International School. The model defines a\nsmile-shaped success region in angle-velocity space where a free throw will\nscore. A formula for the minimum throwing angle is derived analytically. The\noptimal throwing conditions are determined numerically by maximising the\nexpected number of successful shots given the error pattern inherent to the\nplayer. This approach is fully quantified by the model presented and suggests a\nreliable way for individual free throw improvement. The model also explains\nrecent NBA data showing that some of the most successful free throwers bear\ncompletely different conditions to the average player.\n", "  We review the near-field radiative heat flux between hyperbolic materials\nfocusing on multilayer hyperbolic meta-materials. We discuss the formation of\nthe hyperbolic bands, the impact of ordering of the multilayer slabs, as well\nas the impact of the first single layer on the heat transfer. Furthermore, we\ncompare the contribution of surface modes to that of hyperbolic modes. Finally,\nwe also compare the exact results with predictions from effective medium\ntheory.\n", "  In this present work, the scattering state solutions of the Spinless Salpeter\nequation with the Varshni potential model were investigated. The approximate\nscattering phase shift, normalization constant, bound state energy, wave number\nand wave function in the asymptotic region were obtained. The behaviour of the\nphase shift with the two-body mass index {\\eta} were discussed and presented.\n", "  The planar equilateral restricted four-body problem where two of the\nprimaries have equal masses is used in order to determine the Newton-Raphson\nbasins of convergence associated with the equilibrium points. The parametric\nvariation of the position of the libration points is monitored when the value\nof the mass parameter $m_3$ varies in predefined intervals. The regions on the\nconfiguration $(x,y)$ plane occupied by the basins of attraction are revealed\nusing the multivariate version of the Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The\ncorrelations between the attracting domains of the equilibrium points and the\ncorresponding number of iterations needed for obtaining the desired accuracy\nare also illustrated. We perform a thorough and systematic numerical\ninvestigation by demonstrating how the dynamical parameter $m_3$ influences the\nshape, the geometry and the degree of fractality of the converging regions. Our\nnumerical outcomes strongly indicate that the mass parameter is indeed one of\nthe most influential factors in this dynamical system.\n", "  Results of broadband dielectric spectroscopy and rheological studies of\npoly(propylene glycol) + SiO${_2}$ nanocomposites are presented. They show that\nthe dynamics in high-concentrated composite is determined by confinement and\nadsorption effects, resulting from interactions of confined polymers correspond\nwith the host system at the interface between PPG and solid nanoparticles. The\nevolution of relaxation times follows the clear Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann pattern,\nwhat is proved by the supplementary activation energy temperature index\nanalysis. The strong influence of nanoparticles on the transitional dynamics\nand the fragility in the ultraviscous domain was noted.\n", "  The escape mechanism of orbits in a star cluster rotating around its parent\ngalaxy in a circular orbit is investigated. A three degrees of freedom model is\nused for describing the dynamical properties of the Hamiltonian system. The\ngravitational field of the star cluster is represented by a smooth and\nspherically symmetric Plummer potential. We distinguish between ordered and\nchaotic orbits as well as between trapped and escaping orbits, considering only\nunbounded motion for several energy levels. The Smaller Alignment Index (SALI)\nmethod is used for determining the regular or chaotic nature of the orbits. The\nbasins of escape are located and they are also correlated with the\ncorresponding escape time of the orbits. Areas of bounded regular or chaotic\nmotion and basins of escape were found to coexist in the $(x,z)$ plane. The\nproperties of the normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs), located in\nthe vicinity of the index-1 Lagrange points $L_1$ and $L_2$, are also explored.\nThese manifolds are of paramount importance as they control the flow of stars\nover the saddle points, while they also trigger the formation of tidal tails\nobserved in star clusters. Bifurcation diagrams of the Lyapunov periodic orbits\nas well as restrictions of the Poincar\\'e map to the NHIMs are deployed for\nelucidating the dynamics in the neighbourhood of the saddle points. The\nextended tidal tails, or tidal arms, formed by stars with low velocity which\nescape through the Lagrange points are monitored. The numerical results of this\nwork are also compared with previous related work.\n", "  This paper deals with the three-dimensional narrow escape problem in\ndendritic spine shaped domain, which is composed of a relatively big head and a\nthin neck. The narrow escape problem is to compute the mean first passage time\nof Brownian particles traveling from inside the head to the end of the neck.\nThe original model is to solve a mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary value problem\nfor the Poisson equation in the composite domain, and is computationally\nchallenging. In this paper we seek to transfer the original problem to a mixed\nRobin-Neumann boundary value problem by dropping the thin neck part, and\nrigorously derive the asymptotic expansion of the mean first passage time with\nhigh order terms. This study is a nontrivial generalization of the work in\n\\cite{Li}, where a two-dimensional analogue domain is considered.\n", "  Weyl semimetals are conductors whose low-energy bulk excitations are Weyl\nfermions, whereas their surfaces possess metallic Fermi arc surface states.\nThese Fermi arc surface states are protected by a topological invariant\nassociated with the bulk electronic wavefunctions of the material. Recently, it\nhas been shown that the TaAs and NbAs classes of materials harbor such a state\nof topological matter. We review the basic phenomena and experimental history\nof the discovery of the first Weyl semimetals, starting with the observation of\ntopological Fermi arcs and Weyl nodes in TaAs and NbAs by angle and\nspin-resolved surface and bulk sensitive photoemission spectroscopy and\ncontinuing through magnetotransport measurements reporting the\nAdler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly. We hope that this article provides a useful\nintroduction to the theory of Weyl semimetals, a summary of recent experimental\ndiscoveries, and a guideline to future directions.\n", "  There exists a positive correlation between orbital eccentricity and the\naverage stellar flux that planets receive from their parent star. Often,\nthough, it is assumed that the average equilibrium temperature would\ncorrespondingly increase with eccentricity. Here we test this assumption by\ncalculating and comparing analytic solutions for both the spatial and temporal\naverages of orbital distance, stellar flux, and equilibrium temperature. Our\nsolutions show that the average equilibrium temperature of a planet, with a\nconstant albedo, slowly decreases with eccentricity until converging to a value\n90% that of a circular orbit. This might be the case for many types of planets\n(e.g., hot-jupiters); however, the actual equilibrium and surface temperature\nof planets also depend on orbital variations of albedo and greenhouse. Our\nresults also have implications in understanding the climate, habitability and\nthe occurrence of potential Earth-like planets. For instance, it helps explain\nwhy the limits of the habitable zone for planets in highly elliptical orbits\nare wider than expected from the mean flux approximation, as shown by climate\nmodels.\n", "  In this review a first comprehensive study of azimuthal asymmetries in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic muoproduction of hadron pairs off longitudinally\npolarized protons at COMPASS is presented. The study is based on data taken in\n2007 and 2011, obtained by impinging a high-energetic $\\mu^+$ beam of $160$\nGeV/$\\it{c}$, respectively $200$ GeV/$\\it{c}$, momentum on a solid ammonia\ntarget. The discussion is focused on both leading and subleading longitudinal\ntarget-spin-dependent asymmetries arising in the di-hadron SIDIS cross section,\naddressing the role of spin-orbit couplings and quark-gluon correlations in the\nframework of collinear or transverse momentum dependent factorization.\n", "  We investigate the structure of a dilute mixture of amphiphilic dimers and\nspherical particles, a model relevant to the problem of encapsulating globular\n\"guest\" molecules in a dispersion. Dimers and spheres are taken to be hard\nparticles, with an additional attraction between spheres and the smaller\nmonomers in a dimer. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we document the\nlow-temperature formation of aggregates of guests (clusters) held together by\ndimers, whose typical size and shape depend on the guest concentration $\\chi$.\nFor low $\\chi$ (less than $10\\%$), most guests are isolated and coated with a\nlayer of dimers. As $\\chi$ progressively increases, clusters grow in size\nbecoming more and more elongated and polydisperse; after reaching a shallow\nmaximum for $\\chi\\approx 50\\%$, the size of clusters again reduces upon\nincreasing $\\chi$ further. In one case only ($\\chi=50\\%$ and moderately low\ntemperature) the mixture relaxed to a fluid of lamellae, suggesting that in\nthis case clusters are metastable with respect to crystal-vapor separation. On\nheating, clusters shrink until eventually the system becomes homogeneous on all\nscales. On the other hand, as the mixture is made denser and denser at low\ntemperature, clusters get increasingly larger until a percolating network is\nformed.\n", "  We calculate the chiral string amplitude in pure spinor formalism and take\nfour point amplitude as an example. The method could be easily generalized to\n$N$ point amplitude by complicated calculations. By doing the usual\ncalculations of string theory first and using a special singular gauge limit,\nwe produce the amplitude with the integral over Dirac $\\delta$-functions. The\nBosonic part of the amplitude matches the CHY amplitude and the Fermionic part\ngives us the supersymmetric generalization of CHY amplitude. Finally, we also\ncheck the dependence on boundary condition for heterotic chiral string\namplitudes.\n"]}
