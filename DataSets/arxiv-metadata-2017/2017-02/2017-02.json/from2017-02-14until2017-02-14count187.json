We prove\nextensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur (MA) and\nQuantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur (QCMA). Our results have implications on the\ncomplexity of approximating the ground state energy of a quantum local\nHamiltonian with a unique ground state and an inverse polynomial spectral gap.\nWe show that the estimation, to within polynomial accuracy, of the ground state\nenergy of poly-gapped 1-D local Hamiltonians is QCMA-hard, under randomized\nreductions. This is in strong contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D\nHamiltonians, which is in NP. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be\nreduced to NP by randomized reductions, there is no classical description of\nthe ground state of every poly-gapped local Hamiltonian which allows the\ncalculation of expectation values efficiently.\n  Finally, we discuss a few obstacles towards establishing an analogous result\nto the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA). In particular, we show that random\nprojections fail to provide a polynomial gap between two witnesses.\n", "  We present a modified stratified jet model to interpret the observed spectral\nenergy distributions of knots in 3C 273 jet. Based on the hypothesis of the\nsingle index of the particle energy spectrum at injection and identical\nemission processes among all the knots, the observed difference of spectral\nshape among different 3C273 knots can be understood as a manifestation of\ndeviation of the equivalent Doppler factor of stratified emission regions in\nindividual knot from a characteristic one. The summed spectral energy\ndistribution of all the ten knots in 3C 273 jet can be well fitted by two\ncomponents, low-energy (radio to optical) component dominated by the\nsynchrotron radiation and high-energy component (UV, X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray)\ndominated by the inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background.\nThis gives a consistent spectral index of $\\alpha=0.88$ ($S_\\nu \\propto\n\\nu^{-\\alpha}$) and a characteristic Doppler factor of 7.4. Assuming the\naverage of the summed spectrum as the characteristic spectrum of each knot in\nthe 3C273 jet, we further get a distribution of Doppler factor. We discuss the\npossible implications of these results for the physical properties in 3C 273\njet. Future GeV observations with $\\it GLAST$ could separate the $\\gamma$-ray\nemission of 3C 273 from the large scale jet and the small scale jet (i.e. the\ncore) through measuring the GeV spectrum.\n", "  Design Theory, a branch of mathematics, was born out of the experimental\nstatistics research of the population geneticist R. A. Fisher and of Indian\nmathematical statisticians in the 1930s. The field combines elements of\ncombinatorics, finite projective geometries, Latin squares, and a variety of\nfurther mathematical structures, brought together in surprising ways. This\nessay will present these structures and ideas as well as how the field came\ntogether, in itself an interesting story.\n", "  In this paper, we study variants of the canonical Local-Hamiltonian problem\nwhere, in addition, the witness is promised to be separable. We define two\nvariants of the Local-Hamiltonian problem. The input for the\nSeparable-Local-Hamiltonian problem is the same as the Local-Hamiltonian\nproblem, i.e. a local Hamiltonian and two energies a and b, but the question is\nsomewhat different: the answer is YES if there is a separable quantum state\nwith energy at most a, and the answer is NO if all separable quantum states\nhave energy at least b. The Separable-Sparse-Hamiltonian problem is defined\nsimilarly, but the Hamiltonian is not necessarily local, but rather sparse. We\nshow that the Separable-Sparse-Hamiltonian problem is QMA(2)-Complete, while\nSeparable-Local-Hamiltonian is in QMA. This should be compared to the\nLocal-Hamiltonian problem, and the Sparse-Hamiltonian problem which are both\nQMA-Complete. To the best of our knowledge, Separable-SPARSE-Hamiltonian is the\nfirst non-trivial problem shown to be QMA(2)-Complete.\n", "  The evolution of a universe modelled as a mixture of generalised Chaplygin\ngas and ordinary matter field is studied for a Robertson Walker type of\nspacetime. This model could interpolate periods of a radiation dominated,\nmatter dominated and a cosmological constant dominated universe. Depending on\nthe arbitrary constants appearing in our theory the instant of flip changes.\nInterestingly we also get a bouncing model when the signature of one of the\nconstants changes. The velocity of sound may become imaginary under certain\nsituations pointing to a perturbative state and consequently the possibility of\nstructure formation. We also discuss the whole situation in the backdrop of\nwellknown Raychaudhury equation and a comparison is made with the previous\nresults.\n", "  We identify the fundamental factors determining the microstructural (MS)\nstatistics of granular systems, using numerical experiments on 2D assemblies of\npolydisperse frictional discs and studying the emergent properties of quadrons\n(Qs), the basic structural elements of granular solids, whose statistics are\nuniversal-like[1]. The dependence of the structures and of the packing fraction\non friction and initial state are analysed and we report the following. 1.\nDerivation of an analytical formula for the mean Q volume in terms of: the mean\ncoordination number, the packing fraction and the rattlers fraction. 2.\nDerivation of a unique, initial-state-independent, relation between the mean\ncoordination number and the rattler-free packing fraction. We support the\nrelation with data for a range of different systems. 3. Collapse of the Q\nvolume distributions of all systems onto one curve, having an exponential tail.\n4. Decomposition of the Q volumes distribution into conditional distributions,\neach of these also collapsing onto a single curve. 5. The mean Q volume\ndecreases with increasing inter-granular friction coefficients, an effect\nprominent in high order cells. We argue that this phenomenon is due to an\nincreased probability of stable irregularly-shaped cells and test this by a\nherewith developed free cell analytical model. We conclude that, in principle,\nthe MS characteristics are governed mainly by the packing procedure, while\neffects of friction and initial states can be scaled away. Yet, mechanical\nconstraints limit slightly occurrence of small Q volumes in large cells, which\ndoes depend on friction. We quantify this deviation from exact collapse for\nthese cells. 6. We argue that our results support the view that ensemble\ngranular statistical mechanics does not satisfy the uniform measure assumption\nof conventional statistical mechanics.\n", "  Chiral anomalies have profound impact on the transport properties of\nrelativistic fluids. In four dimensions there are different types of anomalies,\npure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies. They give rise to two new\nnon-dissipative transport coefficients, the chiral magnetic conductivity and\nthe chiral vortical conductivity. They can be calculated from the microscopic\ndegrees of freedom with the help of Kubo formulae. We review the calculation of\nthe anomalous transport coefficients via Kubo formulae with a particular\nemphasis on the contribution of the mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly.\n", "  The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox displays how the use of a p-value (or number of\nstandard deviations z) in a frequentist hypothesis test can lead to an\ninference that is radically different from that of a Bayesian hypothesis test\nin the form advocated by Harold Jeffreys in the 1930s and common today. The\nsetting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard\nModel of elementary particle physics, possibly with \"nuisance parameters\")\nversus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of\nnature of unknown strength). The p-value, as well as the ratio of the\nlikelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the\nalternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian\nposterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The\nacademic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this\nparadox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific\ncommunication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to\nfrontier research in high energy physics. This paper is an attempt to explain\nthe situation to both physicists and statisticians, in the hope that further\nprogress can be made.\n", "  We propose that nonequilibrium quantum criticality in open systems at both\nzero and finite temperatures can be described by a master equation of the\nLindblad form. We derive this equation from a system coupling microscopic to a\nheat bath. It is suggested to be valid generally for studying dynamical quantum\ncriticality and is thus designated as Model Q upon generalizing Hohenberg and\nHalperin's classification of classical critical dynamics. We find that the\ndissipation rate in the equation must be included in the scaling forms as an\nindispensable additional scaling variable in order to correctly describe the\nnonequilibrium quantum critical behavior. Yet, the equilibrium fixed point\ndetermines the nonequilibrium critical behavior in the weak coupling limit.\nThrough numerically solving the Lindblad equation for the quantum Ising chain,\nwe attest these propositions by finite-time scaling forms with the dissipation\nrate. Nonequilibrium dynamic critical behavior of spontaneous emissions in\ndissipative open systems at zero temperature near their quantum critical points\nis found and is also described well by the scaling forms. Model Q thus provides\na general approach to study quantum critical behavior of a system itself\nthrough its weak coupling to the environment.\n", "  The Quantum Satisfiability problem generalizes the Boolean satisfiability\nproblem to the quantum setting by replacing classical clauses with local\nprojectors. The Quantum Lov\\'asz Local Lemma gives a sufficient condition for a\nQuantum Satisfiability problem to be satisfiable [AKS12], by generalizing the\nclassical Lov\\'asz Local Lemma.\n  The next natural question that arises is: can a satisfying quantum state be\nefficiently found, when these conditions hold? In this work we present such an\nalgorithm, with the additional requirement that all the projectors commute. The\nproof follows the information theoretic proof given by Moser's breakthrough\nresult in the classical setting [Mos09].\n  Similar results were independently published in [CS11,CSV13].\n", "  We propose a scaling theory for the universal imaginary-time quantum critical\ndynamics for both short times and long times. We discover that there exists a\nuniversal critical initial slip related to a small initial order parameter\n$M_0$. In this stage, the order parameter $M$ increases with the imaginary time\n$\\tau$ as $M\\propto M_0\\tau^\\theta$ with a universal initial slip exponent\n$\\theta$. For the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, we estimate\n$\\theta$ to be $0.373$, which is markedly distinct from its classical\ncounterpart. Apart from the local order parameter, we also show that the\nentanglement entropy exhibits universal behavior in the short-time region. As\nthe critical exponents in the early stage and in equilibrium are identical, we\napply the short-time dynamics method to determine quantum critical properties.\nThe method is generally applicable in both the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm\nand topological phase transitions.\n", "  This paper introduces the concept of choreography with respect to\ninter-organizational innovation networks, as they constitute an attractive\nenvironment to create innovation in different sectors. We argue that\nchoreography governs behaviours by shaping the level of connectivity and\ncohesion among network members. It represents a valid organizational system\nable to sustain some activities and to reach effects generating innovation\noutcomes. This issue is tackled introducing a new framework in which we propose\na network model as prerequisite for our hypothesis. The analysis is focused on\ninter-organizational innovation networks characterized by the presence of hubs,\nsemi-peripheral and peripheral members lacking hierarchical authority. We\nsustain that the features of a network, bringing to synchronization phenomena,\nare extremely similar to those existing in innovation network characterized by\nthe emergence of choreography. The effectiveness of our model is verified by\nproviding a real case study that gives preliminary empirical hints on the\nnetwork aptitude to perform choreography. Indeed, the innovation network\nanalysed in the case study reveals characteristics causing synchronization and\nconsequently the establishment of choreography.\n", "  Unlike classical money, which is hard to forge for practical reasons (e.g.\nproducing paper with a certain property), quantum money is attractive because\nits security might be based on the no-cloning theorem. The first quantum money\nscheme was introduced by Wiesner circa 1970. Although more sophisticated\nquantum money schemes were proposed, Wiesner's scheme remained appealing\nbecause it is both conceptually clean and relatively easy to implement.\n  We show efficient adaptive attacks on Wiesner's quantum money scheme [Wie83]\n(and its variant by Bennett et al. [BBBW83]), when valid money is accepted and\npassed on, while invalid money is destroyed. We propose two attacks, the first\nis inspired by the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb testing problem [EV93, KWH+95], while\nthe second is based on the idea of protective measurements [AAV93]. It allows\nus to break Wiesner's scheme with 4 possible states per qubit, and\ngeneralizations which use more than 4 states per qubit.\n", "  The thermodynamical behaviour of the Variable Chaplygin gas (VCG) model is\nstudied, using an equation of state like $P = - \\frac{B}{\\rho}$, where $B =\nB_{0}V^{-\\frac{n}{3}}$. Here $B_{0}$ is a positive universal constant, $n$ is\nalso a constant and $V$ is the volume of the fluid. From the consideration of\nthermodynamic stability, it is seen that only if the values of $n$ are allowed\nto be negative, then $(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V})_{S} <0$ throughout the\nevolution. Again thermal capacity at constant volume $c_{V}$ shows positive\nexpression. Using the best fit value of $ n = -3.4$ as previously found by Guo\n\\emph{et al} \\cite{guo1} gives that the fluid is thermodynamically stable\nthrough out the evolution. The effective equation of state for the special case\nof, $n = 0$ goes to $\\Lambda$CDM model. Again for $n <0$ it favours\nphantom-like cosmology which is in agreement with the current SNe Ia\nconstraints like VCG model. The deceleration parameter is also studied in the\ncontext of thermodynamics and the analysis shows that the \\emph{flip} occurs\nfor the value of $ n < 4$. Finally the thermal equation of state is discussed\nwhich is an explicit function of temperature only. It is also observed that the\nthird law of thermodynamics is satisfied in this model. As expected the volume\nincreases as temperature falls during adiabatic expansions. In this case, for $\nT \\rightarrow 0$, the thermal equation of state reduces to $(- 1 +\n\\frac{n}{6})$ which is identical with the equation of state for the case of\nlarge volume.\n", "  The effects of gold nanoparticles in 125I brachytherapy dose enhancement on\nchoroidal Melanoma are examined using the Monte Carlo simulation technique.\nUsually, Monte Carlo ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry is performed in a water\nphantom. However, here, the compositions of human eye have been considered\ninstead of water. Both human eye and water phantoms have been simulated with\nMCNP5 code. These simulations were performed for a fully-loaded 16 mm COMS eye\nplaque containing 13 125I seeds. The dose delivered to the tumor and healthy\ntissues have been calculated in both phantoms, with and without GNPs. The\nresults indicates that the dose to the tumor in an eye-ball implanted with COMS\nplaque increases with increasing GNPs concentration inside the target.\nTherefore, the required irradiation time for the tumors in the eye is decreased\nby adding the GNPs prior to treatment. As a result, the dose to healthy tissues\ndecreases when the irradiation time is reduced. Furthermore, a comparison\nbetween the simulated data in an eye phantom made of water and eye phantom made\nof human-eye composition, in the presence of GNPs shows the significance of\nutilizing the composition of eye in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.\nNormally, the radiation therapy of cancer patients is designed to deliver a\nrequired dose to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. The\nresults demonstrated that the use of GNPs enable us to overcome this challenge.\nAlso, defining the eye composition instead of water will leads to more accurate\ncalculations of GNPs radiation effects in ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry.\n", "  We study the imaginary-time relaxation critical dynamics of a quantum system\nwith a vanishing initial correlation length and an arbitrary initial order\nparameter $M_0$. We find that in quantum critical dynamics, the behavior of\n$M_0$ under scale transformations deviates from a simple power-law, which was\nproposed for very small $M_0$ previously. A universal characteristic function\nis then suggested to describe the rescaled initial magnetization, similar to\nclassical critical dynamics. This characteristic function is shown to be able\nto describe the quantum critical dynamics in both short- and long-time stages\nof the evolution. The one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model is employed\nto numerically determine the specific form of the characteristic function. We\ndemonstrate that it is applicable as long as the system is in the vicinity of\nthe quantum critical point. The universality of the characteristic function is\nconfirmed by numerical simulations of models belonging to the same universality\nclass.\n", "  This is the second lecture of `RAGtime' series on electrodynamical effects\nnear black holes. We will summarize the basic equations of relativistic\nelectrodynamics in terms of spin-coefficient (Newman-Penrose) formalism. The\naim of the lecture is to present important relations that hold for exact\nelectro-vacuum solutions and to exhibit, in a pedagogical manner, some\nillustrative solutions and useful approximation approaches. First, we\nconcentrate on weak electromagnetic fields and we illustrate their structure by\nconstructing the magnetic and electric lines of force. Gravitational field of\nthe black hole assumes axial symmetry, whereas the electromagnetic field may or\nmay not share the same symmetry. With these solutions we can investigate the\nframe-dragging effects acting on electromagnetic fields near a rotating black\nhole. These fields develop magnetic null points and current sheets. Their\nstructure suggests that magnetic reconnection takes place near the rotating\nblack hole horizon. Finally, the last section will be devoted to the transition\nfrom test-field solution to exact solutions of coupled Einstein-Maxwell\nequations. New effects emerge within the framework of exact solutions: the\nexpulsion of the magnetic flux out of the black-hole horizon depends on the\nintensity of the imposed magnetic field.\n", "  We consider an infinite system of Brownian motions which interact through a\ngiven Brownian motion being reflected from its left neighbor. Earlier we\nstudied this system for deterministic periodic initial configurations. In this\ncontribution we consider initial configurations distributed according to a\nPoisson point process with constant intensity, which makes the process\nspace-time stationary. We prove convergence to the Airy process for stationary\nthe case. As a byproduct we obtain a novel representation of the\nfinite-dimensional distributions of this process. Our method differs from the\none used for the TASEP and the KPZ equation by removing the initial step only\nafter the limit $t\\to\\infty$. This leads to a new universal cross-over process.\n", "  Stability of the Einstein static universe versus the linear scalar, vector\nand tensor perturbations is investigated in the context of deformed\nHo\\v{r}ava-Lifshitz cosmology inspired by entropic force scenario. A general\nstability condition against the linear scalar perturbations is obtained. Using\nthis general condition, it is shown that there is no stable Einstein static\nuniverse for the case of flat universe, $k=0$. For the the special case of\nlarge values of running parameter of HL gravity $\\omega$, in a positively\ncurved universe $k>0$, the domination of the quintessence and phantom matter\nfields with barotropic equation of state parameter $\\beta<-\\frac{1}{3}$ is\nnecessary while for a negatively curved universe $k<0$, the matter fields with\n$\\beta> -\\frac{1}{3}$ are needed to be the dominant fields of the universe.\nAlso, a neutral stability against the vector perturbations is obtained.\nFinally, an inequality including the cosmological parameters of the Einstein\nstatic universe is obtained for the stability against the tensor perturbations.\nIt turns out that for large $\\omega$ values, there is a stability against the\ntensor perturbations.\n", "  Searches for faint signals in counting experiments are often encountered in\nparticle physics and astrophysics, as well as in other fields. Many problems\ncan be reduced to the case of a model with independent and Poisson-distributed\nsignal and background. Often several background contributions are present at\nthe same time, possibly correlated. We provide the analytic solution of the\nstatistical inference problem of estimating the signal in the presence of\nmultiple backgrounds, in the framework of objective Bayes statistics. The model\ncan be written in the form of a product of a single Poisson distribution with a\nmultinomial distribution. The first is related to the total number of events,\nwhereas the latter describes the fraction of events coming from each individual\nsource. Correlations among different backgrounds can be included in the\ninference problem by a suitable choice of the priors.\n", "  The standard variational derivation of stellar matter structure in the\nWigner-Seitz approximation is generalized to the finite temperature situation\nwhere a wide distribution of different nuclear species can coexist in the same\ndensity and proton fraction condition, possibly out of $\\beta$-equilibrium. The\nsame theoretical formalism is shown to describe on one side the single-nucleus\napproximation (SNA), currently used in most core collapse supernova\nsimulations, and on the other side the nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE)\napproach, routinely employed in r- and p-process explosive nucleosynthesis\nproblems. In particular we show that in-medium effects have to be accounted for\nin NSE to have a theoretical consistency between the zero and finite\ntemperature modeling. The bulk part of these in-medium effects is analytically\ncalculated and shown to be different from a van der Waals excluded volume term.\nThis unified formalism allows controlling quantitatively the deviations from\nthe SNA in the different thermodynamic conditions, as well as having a NSE\nmodel which is reliable at any arbitrarily low value of the temperature, with\npotential applications for neutron star cooling and accretion problems. We\npresent different illustrative results with several mass models and effective\ninteractions, showing the importance of accounting for the nuclear species\ndistribution even at temperatures lower than 1 MeV.\n", "  The aim of the present Monte Carlo study is to evaluate the variation of\nenergy deposition in healthy tissues in the human eye which is irradiated by\nbrachytherapy sources in comparison with the resultant dose increase in the\ngold nanoparticle(GNP)-loaded choroidal melanoma. The effects of these\nnanoparticles on normal tissues are compared between 103Pd and 125I as two\nophthalmic brachytherapy sources. Dose distribution in the tumor and healthy\ntissues have been taken into account for both mentioned brachytherapy sources.\nAlso, in a certain point of the eye, the ratio of the absorbed dose by the\nnormal tissue in the presence of GNPs to the absorbed dose by the same point in\nthe absence of GNPs has been calculated. In addition, differences observed in\nthe comparison of simple water phantom and actual simulated human eye in\npresence of GNPs are also a matter of interest that have been considered in the\npresent work. The results show that the calculated dose enhancement factor in\nthe tumor for 125I is higher than that of the 103Pd. The difference between the\neye globe and the water phantom is more obvious for 125I than that of the 103Pd\nwhen the ophthalmic dosimetry is done in the presence of GNPs. Whenever these\nnanoparticles are utilized in enhancing the absorbed dose by the eye tumor, the\nuse of 125I brachytherapy source will greatly amplify the amount of dose\nenhancement factor (DEF) in the tumor site without inflicting much damage to\nhealthy organs, when compared to the 103Pd source. Furthermore in Monte-Carlo\nstudies of eye brachytherapy, more precise definition of the eye phantom\ninstead of a water phantom will become increasingly important when we use 125I\nas opposed to when 103Pd is considered.\n", "  In this paper, using a black hole with scalar hair, we construct a scalar\nthin-shell wormhole (TSW) in 2+1 dimensions by applying the Visser's famous cut\nand paste technique. The surface stress, which is concentrated at the wormhole\nthroat is determined by using the Darmois-Israel formalism. By employing the\nvarious gas models, we study the stability analysis of the TSW. The region of\nstability is changed by tuning the parameters of \"l\" and \"u\". It is observed\nthat the obtained particular TSW originated from the black hole with scalar\nhair could be more stable with particular $l$ parameter, however it still needs\nexotic matter.\n", "  In this paper, we obtain general conditions under which the wave equation is\nwell-posed in spacetimes with metrics of Lipschitz regularity. In particular,\nthe results can be applied to spacetimes where there is a loss of regularity on\na hypersurface such as shell-crossing singularities, thin shells of matter and\nsurface layers. This provides a framework for regarding gravitational\nsingularities, not as obstructions to the world lines of point-particles, but\nrather as an obstruction to the dynamics of test fields.\n", "  The effect of concentration-dependent switching of the non-equilibrium\ndepletion interaction between obstacles in a gas flow of interacting Brownian\nparticles is presented. When increasing bath fraction exceeds half-filling, the\nwake-mediated interaction between obstacles switches from effective attraction\nto repulsion or vice-versa, depending on the mutual alignment of obstacles with\nrespect to the gas flow. It is shown that for an ensemble of small and widely\nseparated obstacles the dissipative interaction takes the form of induced\ndipole-dipole interaction governed by an anisotropic screened Coulomb-like\npotential. This allows one to give a qualitative picture of the interaction\nbetween obstacles and explain switching effect as a result of changes of\nanisotropy direction. The non-linear blockade effect is shown to be essential\nnear closely located obstacles, that manifests itself in additional screening\nof the gas flow and generation of a pronounced step-like profile of gas density\ndistribution. It is established that behavior of the magnitude of dissipative\neffective interaction is, generally, non-monotonic in relation to both the bath\nfraction and the external driving field. It has characteristic peaks\ncorresponding to the situation when the common density \"coat\" formed around the\nobstacles is most pronounced. The possibility of the dissipative pairing effect\nis briefly discussed. All the results are obtained within the classical\nlattice-gas model.\n", "  We consider the minimal U(1)$_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM)\nwith the classically conformal invariance, where an anomaly free U(1)$_{B-L}$\ngauge symmetry is introduced along with three generations of right-handed\nneutrinos and a U(1)$_{B-L}$ Higgs field. Because of the classically conformal\nsymmetry, all dimensional parameters are forbidden. The $B-L$ gauge symmetry is\nradiatively broken through the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, generating the mass\nfor the $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson ($Z^\\prime$ boson) and the right-handed\nneutrinos. Through a small negative coupling between the SM Higgs doublet and\nthe $B-L$ Higgs field, the negative mass term for the SM Higgs doublet is\ngenerated and the electroweak symmetry is broken. In this model context, we\ninvestigate the electroweak vacuum instability problem in the SM. It is known\nthat in the classically conformal U(1)$_{B-L}$ extension of the SM, the\nelectroweak vacuum remains unstable in the renormalization group analysis at\nthe one-loop level. In this paper, we extend the analysis to the two-loop\nlevel, and perform parameter scans. We identify a parameter region which not\nonly solve the vacuum instability problem, but also satisfy the recent ATLAS\nand CMS bounds from search for $Z^\\prime$ boson resonance at the LHC Run-2.\nConsidering self-energy corrections to the SM Higgs doublet through the\nright-handed neutrinos and the $Z^\\prime$ boson, we derive the naturalness\nbound on the model parameters to realize the electroweak scale without\nfine-tunings.\n", "  The Tunka observatory is located close to Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia. Its\nmain detector, Tunka-133, is an array of photomultipliers measuring Cherenkov\nlight of air showers initiated by cosmic rays in the energy range of\napproximately $10^{16}-10^{18}\\,$eV. In the last years, several extensions have\nbeen built at the Tunka site, e.g., a scintillator array named Tunka-Grande, a\nsophisticated air-Cherenkov-detector prototype named HiSCORE, and the radio\nextension Tunka-Rex. Tunka-Rex started operation in October 2012 and currently\nfeatures 44 antennas distributed over an area of about $3\\,$km$^2$, which\nmeasure the radio emission of the same air showers detected by Tunka-133 and\nTunka-Grande. Tunka-Rex is a technological demonstrator that the radio\ntechnique can provide an economic extension of existing air-shower arrays. The\nmain scientific goal is the cross-calibration with the air-Cherenkov\nmeasurements. By this cross-calibration, the precision for the reconstruction\nof the energy and mass of the primary cosmic-ray particles can be determined.\nFinally, Tunka-Rex can be used for cosmic-ray physics at energies close to\n$1\\,$EeV, where the standard Tunka-133 analysis is limited by statistics. In\ncontrast to the air-Cherenkov measurements, radio measurements are not limited\nto dark, clear nights and can provide an order of magnitude larger exposure.\n", "  We present a novel approach for computing reduced density matrices for\nsuperpositions of eigenstates of a Bethe-ansatz solvable model by direct\nintegration of the wave function in coordinate representation. A diagrammatic\napproach is developed to keep track of relevant terms and identify symmetries,\nwhich helps to reduce the number of terms that have to be evaluated\nnumerically. As a first application we compute with modest numerical resources\nthe single-particle density matrix and its eigenvalues including the condensate\nfraction for a quantum bright soliton with up to $N=10$ bosons. The latter are\nconstructed as superpositions of string-type Bethe-ansatz eigenstates of\nnonrelativistic bosons in one spatial dimension with attractive contact\ninteraction. Upon delocalising the superposition in momentum space we find that\nthe condensate fraction reaches maximum values larger than 97\\% in the range of\nparticles studied. The presented approach is suitable for studying\ntime-dependent problems and generalises to higher-order correlation functions.\n", "  The technological world is in the midst of a quantum computing and quantum\ninformation revolution. Since Richard Feynman's famous \"plenty of room at the\nbottom\" lecture, hinting at the notion of novel devices employing quantum\nmechanics, the quantum information community has taken gigantic strides in\nunderstanding the potential applications of a quantum computer and laid the\nfoundational requirements for building one. We believe that the next\nsignificant step will be to demonstrate a quantum memory, in which a system of\ninteracting qubits stores an encoded logical qubit state longer than the\nincorporated parts. Here, we describe the important route towards a logical\nmemory with superconducting qubits, employing a rotated version of the surface\ncode. The current status of technology with regards to interconnected\nsuperconducting-qubit networks will be described and near-term areas of focus\nto improve devices will be identified. Overall, the progress in this exciting\nfield has been astounding, but we are at an important turning point where it\nwill be critical to incorporate engineering solutions with quantum\narchitectural considerations, laying the foundation towards scalable\nfault-tolerant quantum computers in the near future.\n", "  The importance of microphysical inputs from laboratory nuclear experiments\nand theoretical nuclear structure calculations in the understanding of the core\ncollapse dynamics, and the subsequent supernova explosion, is largely\nrecognized in the recent literature. In this work, we analyze the impact of the\nmasses of very neutron rich nuclei on the matter composition during collapse,\nand the corresponding electron capture rate. To this aim, we introduce an\nempirical modification of the popular Duflo-Zuker mass model to account for\npossible shell quenching far from stability, and study the effect of the\nquenching on the average electron capture rate. We show that the preeminence of\nthe $N=50$ and $N=82$ closed shells in the collapse dynamics is considerably\ndecreased if the shell gaps are reduced in the region of $^{78}$Ni and beyond.\nAs a consequence, local modifications of the overall electron capture rate up\nto 30\\% can be expected, with integrated values strongly dependent on the\nstiffness of magicity quenching and progenitor mass and potential important\nconsequences on the entropy generation, the neutrino emissivity, and the mass\nof the core at bounce. Our work underlines the importance of new experimental\nmeasurements in this region of the nuclear chart, the most crucial information\nbeing the nuclear mass and the Gamow-Teller strength. Reliable microscopic\ncalculations of the associated elementary rate, in a wide range of temperatures\nand electron densities, optimized on these new empirical information, will be\nadditionally needed to get quantitative predictions of the collapse dynamics.\n", "  Ultracold neutrons confined in the Earth's gravitational field display\nquantized energy levels that have been observed for over a decade. In recent\nresonance spectroscopy experiments [T. Jenke et al., Nature Phys. 7, 468\n(2011)], the transition between two such gravitational quantum states was\ndriven by the mechanical oscillation of the plates that confine the neutrons.\nHere we show that, by applying a sinusoidal modulation with slowly varying\nfrequency (chirp), the neutrons can be brought to higher excited states by\nclimbing the energy levels one by one. The proposed experiment should make it\npossible to observe the quantum-classical transition that occurs at high\nneutron energies. Furthermore, it provides a technique to realize\nsuperpositions of gravitational quantum states, to be used for precision tests\nof gravity at short distances.\n", "  Controlling the internal degrees of freedom is a key challenge for\napplications of cold and ultracold molecules. Here, we demonstrate\nrotational-state cooling of trapped methyl fluoride molecules (CH3F) by\noptically pumping the population of 16 M-sublevels in the rotational states\nJ=3,4,5, and 6 into a single level. By combining rotational-state cooling with\nmotional cooling, we increase the relative number of molecules in the state\nJ=4, K=3, M=4 from a few percent to over 70%, thereby generating a\ntranslationally cold (~30mK) and nearly pure state ensemble of about 10^6\nmolecules. Our scheme is extendable to larger sets of initial states, other\nfinal states and a variety of molecule species, thus paving the way for\ninternal-state control of ever larger molecules.\n", "  In this work, a simple and fundamental numeric scheme dubbed as ab-initio\noptimization principle (AOP) is proposed for the ground states of translational\ninvariant strongly-correlated quantum lattice models. The idea is to transform\na nondeterministic-polynomial-hard ground state simulation with infinite\ndegrees of freedom into a single optimization problem of a local function with\nfinite number of physical and ancillary degrees of freedom. This work\ncontributes mainly in the following aspects: 1) AOP provides a simple and\nefficient scheme to simulate the ground state by solving a local optimization\nproblem. Its solution contains two kinds of boundary states, one of which play\nthe role of the entanglement bath that mimic the interactions between a\nsupercell and the infinite environment, and the other give the ground state in\na tensor network (TN) form. 2) In the sense of TN, a novel decomposition named\nas tensor ring decomposition (TRD) is proposed to implement AOP. Instead of\nfollowing the contraction-truncation scheme used by many existing TN-based\nalgorithms, TRD solves the contraction of a uniform TN in an opposite clue by\nencoding the contraction in a set of self-consistent equations that\nautomatically reconstruct the whole TN, making the simulation simple and\nunified; 3) AOP inherits and develops the ideas of different well-established\nmethods, including the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), infinite\ntime-evolving block decimation (iTEBD), network contractor dynamics, density\nmatrix embedding theory, and etc., providing a unified perspective that is\npreviously missing in this fields; 4) AOP as well as TRD gives novel\nimplications to existing TN-based algorithms: a modified iTEBD is suggested and\nthe 2D AOP is argued to be an intrinsic 2D extension of DMRG that is based on\ninfinite projected entangled pair state.\n", "  Time-delays in the photoionization of molecules are investigated. As compared\nto atomic ionization, the time-delays expected from molecular ionization\npresent a much richer phenomenon, with a strong spatial dependence due to the\nanisotropic nature of the molecular scattering potential. We investigate this\nfrom a scattering theory perspective, and make use of molecular photoionization\ncalculations to examine this effect in representative homonuclear and\nhetronuclear diatomic molecules, nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We present\nenergy and angle-resolved maps of the Wigner delay time for single-photon\nvalence ionization, and discuss the possibilities for experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  All natural things process and transform information. They receive\nenvironmental information as input, and transform it into appropriate output\nresponses. Much of science is dedicated to building models of such systems --\nalgorithmic abstractions of their input-output behavior that allow us to\nsimulate how such systems can behave in the future, conditioned on what has\ntranspired in the past. Here, we show that classical models cannot avoid\ninefficiency -- storing past information that is unnecessary for correct future\nsimulation. We construct quantum models that mitigate this waste, whenever it\nis physically possible to do so. This suggests that the complexity of general\ninput-output processes depends fundamentally on what sort of information theory\nwe use to describe them.\n", "  We study both analytically and numerically the edge of two-dimensional\nferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, considering both\nchiral magnets and magnets with interface-induced DM interactions. We show that\nin the field-polarized ferromagnetic phase magnon states exist which are bound\nto the edge, and we calculate their spectra within a continuum field theory.\nUpon lowering an external magnetic field, these bound magnons condense at a\nfinite momentum and the edge becomes locally unstable. Micromagnetic\nsimulations demonstrate that this edge instability triggers the creation of a\nhelical phase which penetrates the field-polarized state within the bulk. A\nsubsequent increase of the magnetic field allows to create skyrmions close to\nthe edge in a controlled manner.\n", "  We explore the intimate connection between spacetime geometry and\nelectrodynamics. This link is already implicit in the constitutive relations\nbetween the field strengths and excitations, which are an essential part of the\naxiomatic structure of electromagnetism, clearly formulated via integration\ntheory and differential forms. We briefly review the foundations of\nelectromagnetism based on charge and magnetic flux conservation, the Lorentz\nforce and the constitutive relations which introduce the spacetime metric. We\nthen proceed with the tensor formulation by assuming local, linear, homogeneous\nand isotropic constitutive relations, and explore the physical, observable\nconsequences of Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime. The field equations,\ncharge conservation and the Lorentz force are explicitly expressed in general\n(pseudo) Riemanian manifolds. The generalized Gauss and Maxwell-Amp\\`{e}re\nlaws, as well as the wave equations, reveal potentially interesting\nastrophysical applications. In all cases new electromagnetic couplings and\nrelated phenomena are induced by spacetime curvature. The implications and\npossible applications for gravity waves detection are briefly addressed. At the\nfoundational level, we discuss the possibility of generalizing the vacuum\nconstitutive relations, by relaxing the fixed conditions of homogeneity and\nisotropy, and by assuming that the symmetry properties of the electro-vacuum\nfollow the spacetime isometries. The implications of this extension are briefly\ndiscussed in the context of the intimate connection between electromagnetism\nand the geometry (and causal structure) of spacetime.\n", "  We prove the orthogonality of the Bethe Ansatz eigenfunctions for the\nLaplacian on a hyperoctahedral Weyl alcove with repulsive homogeneous Robin\nboundary conditions at the walls. To this end these eigenfunctions are\nretrieved as the continuum limit of an orthogonal basis of algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz eigenfunctions for a finite $q$-boson system endowed with diagonal\nopen-end boundary interactions.\n", "  We show spin lifetimes of 12.6 ns and spin diffusion lengths as long as 30.5\n\\mu m in single layer graphene non-local spin transport devices at room\ntemperature. This is accomplished by the fabrication of Co/MgO-electrodes on a\nSi/SiO$_2$ substrate and the subsequent dry transfer of a graphene-hBN-stack on\ntop of this electrode structure where a large hBN flake is needed in order to\ndiminish the ingress of solvents along the hBN-to-substrate interface.\nInterestingly, long spin lifetimes are observed despite the fact that both\nconductive scanning force microscopy and contact resistance measurements reveal\nthe existence of conducting pinholes throughout the MgO spin\ninjection/detection barriers. The observed enhancement of the spin lifetime in\nsingle layer graphene by a factor of 6 compared to previous devices exceeds\ncurrent models of contact-induced spin relaxation which paves the way towards\nprobing intrinsic spin properties of graphene.\n", "  Turbulence is ubiquitous in plasmas, leading to rich dynamics characterized\nby irregularity, irreversibility, energy fluctuations across many scales, and\nenergy transfer across many scales. Another fundamental and generic feature of\nturbulence, although sometimes overlooked, is the inhomogeneous dissipation of\nenergy in space and in time. This is a consequence of intermittency, the\nscale-dependent inhomogeneity of dynamics caused by fluctuations in the\nturbulent cascade. Intermittency causes turbulent plasmas to self-organize into\ncoherent dissipative structures, which may govern heating, diffusion, particle\nacceleration, and radiation emissions. In this paper, we present recent\nprogress on understanding intermittency in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence with a strong guide field. We focus on the statistical analysis of\nintermittent dissipative structures, which occupy a small fraction of the\nvolume but arguably account for the majority of energy dissipation. We show\nthat, in our numerical simulations, intermittent structures in the current\ndensity, vorticity, and Els\\\"{a}sser vorticities all have nearly identical\nstatistical properties. We propose phenomenological explanations for the\nscalings based on general considerations of Els\\\"{a}sser vorticity structures.\nFinally, we examine the broader implications of intermittency for astrophysical\nsystems.\n", "  The observable epsilon_K is sensitive to flavor violation at some of the\nhighest scales. While its experimental uncertainty is at the half percent\nlevel, the theoretical one is in the ballpark of 15%. We explore the nontrivial\ndependence of the theory prediction and uncertainty on various conventions,\nlike the phase of the kaon fields. In particular, we show how such a rephasing\nallows to make the short-distance contribution of the box diagram with two\ncharm quarks, eta_cc, purely real. Our results allow to slightly reduce the\ntotal theoretical uncertainty of epsilon_K, while increasing the relative\nimpact of the imaginary part of the long distance contribution, underlining the\nneed to compute it reliably. We also give updated bounds on the new physics\noperators that contribute to epsilon_K.\n", "  We study spectral properties of convolution operators $\\mathcal L$ and their\nperturbations $H=\\mathcal L+v(x)$ by compactly supported potentials. Results\nare applied to determine the front propagation of a population density governed\nby operator $H$ with a compactly supported initial density provided that $H$\nhas positive eigenvalues. If there is no positive spectrum, then the\nstabilization of the population density is proved.\n", "  We re-investigate the question of whether there is a significant population\nof Dim (Low Surface Brightness) and/or Dark Galaxies (DDGs). We argue that if\nthey are clustered with bright ones then a physical resolution of ~10 kpc. will\nbe needed to to distinguish their 21-cm. and QSO Absorption Line(QSOAL)\ncounterparts from their brighter neighbours, leading to a real possibility of\nconfusion. But until now such a resolution has not been available in this\ncontext. New Very Large Array (VLA) observations reveal that the\nidentifications with bright optical objects claimed in previous single-dish\nblind HI surveys are often unreliable. For instance 14/36 of our\nhigh-resolution (5 arc sec, 13kpc.) sample have no optical counterparts in the\nDigital Sky Survey. This suggests that DDGs might be commonplace after all, and\nwe go on to re-examine the main arguments that have been used against them.. We\nfind that the QSOAL argument founders on the aforementioned clustering while\ndeep CCD surveys have so far covered too small an area to set set strong\nconstraints on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs). A cosmos filled with\nlow surface brightness galaxies, dark galaxies and intergalactic gas clouds is\ntherefore possible.\n", "  The Nachtmann boosting method is completed with gauge transformations in\norder to be applied to the study of the relative geodesic motion on the de\nSitter spacetimes, finding how the conserved quantities transform under\nisometries and defining the rest frames of massive mobiles.\n", "  We study the complex formation between one long polyanion chain and many\nshort oligocation chains by computer simulations. We employ a coarse-grained\nbead-spring model for the polyelectrolyte chains, and model explicitly the\nsmall salt ions. We systematically vary the concentration and the length of the\noligocation, and examine how the oligocations affects the chain conformation,\nthe static structure factor, the radial and axial distribution of various\ncharged species, and the number of bound ions in the complex. At low\noligocation concentration, the polyanion has an extended structure. Upon\nincreasing the oligocation concentration, the polyanion chain collapses and\nforms a compact globule, but the complex still carries a net negative charge.\nOnce the total charge of the oligocations is equal to that of the polyanion,\nthe collapse stops and is replaced by a slow expansion. In this regime, the net\ncharge on the complexes is positive or neutral, depending on the microion\nconcentration in solution. The expansion can be explained by the reduction of\nthe oligocation bridging. We find that the behavior and the structure of the\ncomplex are largely independent of the length of oligocations, and very similar\nto that observed when replacing the oligocations by multivalent salt cations,\nand conclude that the main driving force keeping the complex together is the\nrelease of monovalent counterions and coions. We speculate on the implications\nof this finding for the problem of controlled oligolyte release and oligolyte\nsubstitution.\n", "  In this work we introduce the concept of quantum geo-encryption - a protocol\nthat invokes direct quantum encryption of messages coupled to quantum location\nmonitoring of the intended receiver. By obfuscating the quantum information\nrequired by both the decrypting process and the location verification process,\na communication channel is created in which the encrypted data can only be\ndecrypted at a specific geographic locale. Classical wireless communications\ncan be invoked to unlock the quantum encryption process thereby allowing for\nany deployment scenario regardless of the channel conditions. Quantum\ngeo-encryption can also be used to realize quantum-computing instructions that\ncan only be implemented at a specific location, and allow for a specified\ngeographical data-route through a distributed network. Here we consider the\noperational aspects of quantum geo-encryption in generic Rician channels,\ndemonstrating that the likelihood of a successful spoofing attack approaches\nzero as the adversary moves away from the allowed decrypting location. The work\nintroduced here resolves a long-standing quest to directly deliver information\nwhich can only be decrypted at a given location free of assumptions on the\nphysical security of a receiver.\n", "  Witten's proof for the positivity of the ADM mass gives a definition of\nenergy in terms of three-surface spinors. In this paper, we give a\ngeneralisation for the remaining six Poincar\\'e charges at spacelike infinity,\nwhich are the angular momentum and centre of mass. The construction improves on\ncertain three-surface spinor equations introduced by Shaw. We solve these\nequations asymptotically obtaining the ten Poincar\\'e charges as integrals over\nthe Nester--Witten two-form. We point out that the defining differential\nequations can be extended to three-surfaces of arbitrary signature and we study\nthem on the entire boundary of a compact four-dimensional region of spacetime.\nThe resulting quasi-local expressions for energy and angular momentum are\nintegrals over a two-dimensional cross-section of the boundary. For any two\nconsecutive such cross-sections, conservation laws are derived that determine\nthe influx (outflow) of matter and gravitational radiation.\n", "  In this paper we selected a sample of massive star forming regions from the\nRed MSX Source (RMS) survey, to study star formation activities (mainly outflow\nand inflow signatures).\n", "  The existence of anyons, \\textit{i.e.} quantum states with an arbitrary spin,\nis a generic feature of standard quantum mechanics in $(2+1)-$dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime. Here it is shown that relativistic anyons may exist also\nin quantum theories where a minimal length is present. The interplay between\nminimal length and arbitrary spin effects are discussed.\n", "  We present a molecular line study towards 31 extended green object (EGO)\nclumps in the southern sky using data from MALT90 (Millimetre Astronomy Legacy\nTeam 90 GHz). According to previous multiwavelength observations, we divide our\nsample into two groups: massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) and HII regions.\nOur results seem to support that N2H+ and C2H emissions mainly come from the\ngas inside quiescent clumps. In addition, we also find that the [N2H+]/[H13CO+]\nand [C2H]/[H13CO+] relative abundance ratios decrease from MYSOs to HII\nregions. These results suggest depletion of N2H+ and C2H in the late stages of\nmassive-star formation, probably caused by the formation of HII regions inside.\nN2H+ and C2H might be used as chemical clocks for massive-star formation by\ncomparing with other molecules such as H13CO+ and HC3N.\n", "  To investigate the environment of HII region Sh2-163 and search for evidence\nof triggered star formation in this region, we performed a multi-wavelength\nstudy of this HII region. Most of our data were taken from large-scale surveys:\n2MASS, CGPS, MSX and SCUBA. We also made CO molecular line observations, using\nthe 13.7-m telescope. The ionized region of Sh2-163 is detected by both the\noptical and radio continuum observations. Sh2-163 is partially bordered by an\narc-like photodissociation region (PDR), which is coincident with the strongest\noptical and radio emissions, indicating interactions between the HII region and\nthe surrounding interstellar medium. Two molecular clouds were discovered on\nthe border of the PDR. The morphology of these two clouds suggests they are\ncompressed by the expansion of Sh2-163. In cloud A, we found two molecular\nclumps. And it seems star formation in clump A2 is much more active than in\nclump A1. In cloud B, we found new outflow activities and massive star(s) are\nforming inside. Using 2MASS photometry, we tried to search for embedded young\nstellar object (YSO) candidates in this region. The very good agreement between\nCO emission, infrared shell and YSOs suggest that it is probably a star\nformation region triggered by the expansion of Sh2-163.We also found the most\nlikely massive protostar related to IRAS 23314+6033.\n", "  Topographical and diffuse interface reconfigurations occur with a change in\nthe solidification rate. In this article we pursue the hypothesis that the\ninterface configuration during solidification is determined by the rate of\nentropy production in the region between a rigorous solid and rigorous liquid\nphase. We posit that when an interface begins to migrate, there are several\nstable configurations that are possible. These include atomistically-planar,\ndiffuse-planar, facet non-planar and cellular non-planar. The configuration and\ntopographical condition that affords the maximum entropy production rate (MEPR)\nyields the most stable interface configuration. The principle of MEPR is\napplied to (1) describe atomistically smooth and diffuse interfaces, (2)\nprovide quantitative results for the diffuse interface thickness and the number\nof pseudo-atomic layers in the interface region, and (3) predict the transition\nfrom planar to a non-planar facet or non-facet cellular morphology as a\nfunction of solidification velocity or temperature gradient. Numerous\nexperimental investigations spanning over sixty years have failed to\ncomprehensively validate any of the existing solid-liquid interface (SLI)\ngrowth instability models. With the MEPR model, for the first time, breakdown\nconditions are predicted with a fair degree of accuracy for a number of binary\nalloys where no previous theoretical model had predictability. The model\nconsiders steady state solidification at close-to and far-from equilibrium\nconditions.\n", "  A mixture of two kinds of identical bosons held in a harmonic potential and\ninteracting by harmonic particle-particle interactions is discussed. This is an\nexactly-solvable model of a mixture of two trapped Bose-Einstein condensates\nwhich allows us to examine analytically various properties. Generalizing the\ntreatment in [Cohen and Lee, J. Math. Phys. {\\bf 26}, 3105 (1985)], closed form\nexpressions for the ground-state energy, wave-function, and lowest-order\ndensities are obtained and analyzed for attractive and repulsive intra-species\nand inter-species particle-particle interactions. A particular mean-field\nsolution of the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii theory is also found\nanalytically. This allows us to compare properties of the mixture at the exact,\nmany-body and mean-field levels, both for finite systems and at the limit of an\ninfinite number of particles. We hereby prove that the exact ground-state\nenergy and lowest-order intra-species and inter-species densities converge at\nthe infinite-particle limit (when the products of the number of particles times\nthe intra-species and inter-species interaction strengths are held fixed) to\nthe results of the Gross-Pitaevskii theory for the mixture. Finally and on the\nother end, the separability of the mixture's center-of-mass coordinate is used\nto show that the Gross-Pitaevskii theory for mixtures is unable to describe the\nvariance of many-particle operators in the mixture, even in the\ninfinite-particle limit. Our analytical results show that many-body\ncorrelations exist in a mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates made of any number\nof particles. Implications are briefly discussed.\n", "  Superconducting qubits are sensitive to a variety of loss mechanisms\nincluding dielectric loss from interfaces. By changing the physical footprint\nof the qubit it is possible to modulate sensitivity to surface loss. Here we\nshow a systematic study of planar superconducting transmons of differing\nphysical footprints to optimize the qubit design for maximum coherence. We find\nthat qubits with small footprints are limited by surface loss and that qubits\nwith large footprints are limited by other loss mechanisms which are currently\nnot understood.\n", "  Inspired by the recent CMS $h \\to \\mu\\tau$ excess, we calculate the lepton\nflavor violating Higgs decay $h \\to \\mu\\tau$ in the littlest Higgs model with\nT-parity (LHT). Under the constraints of $\\ell_i \\to \\ell_j \\gamma$, $Z \\to\n\\ell_i \\bar{\\ell}_j$ and Higgs data, we find that the branching ratio of $h \\to\n\\mu\\tau$ can maximally reach $\\mathcal O(10^{-4})$. We also investigate the\ncorrelation between $h \\to \\mu\\tau $, $\\tau \\to \\mu \\gamma$ and $Z \\to\n\\mu\\tau$, which can be used to test LHT model at future $e^+e^-$ colliders.\n", "  A first search for pair production of dark matter candidates through vector\nboson fusion in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV is performed with\nthe CMS detector. The vector boson fusion topology enhances missing transverse\nmomentum, providing a way to probe supersymmetry also in the case of a\ncompressed mass spectrum. The data sample corresponds to an integrated\nluminosity of 18.5 inverse femtobarns recorded by the CMS experiment. The\nobserved dijet mass spectrum is consistent with the standard model expectation.\nIn an effective field theory, dark matter masses are explored as a function of\ncontact interaction strength. The most stringent limit on bottom squark\nproduction with mass below 315 GeV is also reported, assuming a 5 GeV mass\ndifference with respect to the lightest neutralino.\n", "  Practical implementations of quantum technology are limited by unavoidable\neffects of decoherence and dissipation. With achieved experimental control for\nindividual atoms and photons, more complex platforms composed by several units\ncan be assembled enabling distinctive forms of dissipation and decoherence, in\nindependent heat baths or collectively into a common bath, with dramatic\nconsequences for the preservation of quantum coherence. The cross-over between\nthese two regimes has been widely attributed in the literature to the system\nunits being farther apart than the bath's correlation length. Starting from a\nmicroscopic model of a structured environment (a crystal) sensed by two bosonic\nprobes, here we show the failure of such conceptual relation, and identify the\nexact physical mechanism underlying this cross-over, displaying a sharp\ncontrast between dephasing and dissipative baths. Depending on the frequency of\nthe system and, crucially, on its orientation with respect to the crystal axes,\ncollective dissipation becomes possible for very large distances between\nprobes, opening new avenues to deal with decoherence in phononic baths.\n", "  Yes. Future CMB experiments such as Advanced ACTPol and CMB-S4 should achieve\nmeasurements with S/N of $> 0.1$ for the typical galaxies in redshift surveys.\nThese measurements will provide complementary measurements of the growth rate\nof large scale structure $f$ and the expansion rate of the Universe $H$ to\ngalaxy clustering measurements. This paper emphasizes that there is significant\ninformation in the anisotropy of the relative pairwise kSZ measurements. We\nexpand the relative pairwise kSZ power spectrum in Legendre polynomials and\nconsider up to its octopole. Assuming that the noise in the filtered maps is\nuncorrelated between the positions of galaxies in the survey, we derive a\nsimple analytic form for the power spectrum covariance of the relative pairwise\nkSZ temperature in redshift space. While many previous studies have assumed\noptimistically that the optical depth of the galaxies $\\tau_{\\rm T}$ in the\nsurvey is known, we marginalize over $\\tau_{\\rm T}$, to compute constraints on\nthe growth rate $f$ and the expansion rate $H$. For realistic sure parameters,\nwe find that combining kSZ and galaxy redshift survey data reduces the\nmarginalized $1$-$\\sigma$ errors on $H$ and $f$ by $\\sim50$-$70\\%$ compared to\nthe galaxy-only analysis.\n", "  We analyse the general solutions for the stress field in planar annuli of\nisostatic media, a model often used for marginally rigid granular materials in\nCouette cells. We demonstrate that these solutions are much richer than in\nrectangular symmetries. Even for uniform media, stress chains are found to\ncurve, broaden away from the stress source, attenuate and leak stress into a\ncone of influence. Most spectacularly, stress chains may bend back and transmit\nforces oppositely to the original direction. None of these phenomena arises in\nsolutions for uniform media in Cartesian coordinates. We further analyse\nnon-uniform media, which exhibit chain branching and stress leakage from the\nchains. These results are directly relevant to the many experiments on granular\nmaterials, carried out in Couette cells. They also shed light on, and are\nsupported by, hitherto unexplained experimental observations of curved and\nback-bending chains, which we point out. In particular, we use our results to\nprovide a new interpretation for the pattern of slip lines observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  We present results of our spectroscopic observations of nine detached\neclipsing binaries (DEBs), selected from the $Kepler$ Eclipsing Binary Catalog,\nthat only show one set of spectral lines. Radial velocities (RVs) were\ncalculated from the high resolution spectra obtained with the HIDES instrument,\nattached to the 1.88-m telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, and\nfrom the public APOGEE archive. In our sample we found five single-lined\nbinaries, with one component dominating the spectrum. The orbital and light\ncurve solutions were found for four of them, and compared with isochrones, in\norder to estimate absolute physical parameters and evolutionary status of the\ncomponents. For the fifth case we only update the orbital parameters, and\nestimate the properties of the unseen star. Two other systems show orbital\nmotion with a period known from the eclipse timing variations (ETVs). For these\nwe obtained parameters of outer orbits, by translating the ETVs to RVs of the\ncentre of mass of the eclipsing binary, and combining with the RVs of the outer\nstar. Of the two remaining ones, one is most likely a blend of a faint\nbackground DEB with a bright foreground star, which lines we see in the\nspectra, and the last case is possibly a quadruple bearing a sub-stellar mass\nobject. Where possible, we compare our results with literature, especially with\nresults from asteroseismology. We also report possible detections of solar-like\noscillations in our RVs.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like textures in the magnetization,\ncharacterized by a topological winding number. Nanometer-scale skyrmions have\nbeen observed at room temperature in magnetic multilayer structures. The\ncombination of small size, topological quantization, and their efficient\nelectric manipulation makes them interesting candidates for information\ncarriers in high-performance memory devices. A skyrmion racetrack memory has\nbeen suggested where information is encoded in the distance between skyrmions\nmoving in a one-dimensional nanostrip. Here, we propose an alternative design\nwhere skyrmions move in two (or more) parallel lanes and the information is\nstored in the lane number of each skyrmion. Such a multilane track can be\nconstructed by controlling the height profile of the nanostrip. Repulsive\nskyrmion-skyrmion interactions in narrow nanostrips guarantee that skyrmions on\ndifferent lanes cannot pass each other. Current pulses can be used to induce a\nlane change. Combining these elements provides a robust, efficient design of\nskyrmion-based storage devices.\n", "  Coupling fermions to gravity necessarily leads to a non-renormalizable,\ngravitational four-fermion contact interaction. In this essay, we argue that\naugmenting the Einstein-Cartan Lagrangian with suitable kinetic terms quadratic\nin the gravitational gauge field strengths (torsion and curvature) gives rise\nto new, massive propagating gravitational degrees of freedom. This is to be\nseen in close analogy to Fermi's effective four-fermion interaction and its\nemergent W and Z bosons.\n", "  In this set of lectures we give a pedagogical introduction to the way in\nwhich the nilpotency of a super-de Rham operator can be exploited for the\nconstruction of gauge theories in superspace. We begin with a discussion of how\nthe super-geometric closure conditions can be solved by simply computing the\ncocycles of the super-algebra. The next couple lectures are then devoted to\napplying this idea to extensions of the standard super-de Rham complex. This\neventually results in a geometric \"trivialization\" of the consistency\nconditions required for non-abelian tensor hierarchies. Although this is a\ngeneral conclusion, we focus specifically on the hierarchy obtained by\ncompactifying the 3-form gauge field of 11D supergravity to 4D, $N = 1$\nsuperspace. In the final lecture, we use the cohomological arguments developed\nherein to provide a geometric construction of the non-trivial Chern-Simons-type\ninvariant in that tensor hierarchy and comment on generalizations. These\nlectures are based on a series of talks given at Texas A&M University from\nMarch 21-25.\n", "  Chromatic dispersion is one of the main limitations to the security of\nquantum communication protocols that rely on the transmission of single photons\nin single mode fibers. This phenomenon forces the trusted parties to define\nlonger detection windows to avoid losing signal photons and increases the\namount of detection noise that is being registered. In this work, we analyze\nthe effects of chromatic dispersion on a photon pair generated via spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion and propagating in standard telecommunication\nfibers. We also present the possibility of reducing the detection noise by\nmanipulating the spectral correlation of the pair. As an example, we show that\nour results can be used to increase the maximal security distance of a\ndiscrete-variable quantum key distribution scheme in which the photon source is\nlocated between the legitimate participants of the protocol.\n", "  First results of multi-wavelength measurements of the twilight sky background\nusing all-sky camera with RGB-color CCD conducted in spring and summer of 2016\nin central Russia (55.2 deg N, 37.5 deg E) are discussed. They show the effect\nof aerosol scattering at altitudes up to 35 km which significantly increases to\nthe long-wave range (624 nm, R channel). Analysis of sky color behavior during\nthe light period of twilight with account of ozone Chappuis absorption allows\nretrieving the angle dependencies of scattering on the stratospheric aerosol\nparticles. This is used to find the parameters of lognormal size distribution:\nmedian radius about 0.08 microns and width 1.5-1.6 for stratospheric altitude\nrange.\n", "  The effects of the quantized electromagnetic fields on the spectral\nstatistics of two-level atoms are considered. We have used the Berry- Robnik\ndistribution and Maximum Likelihood estimation technique to analyze the effect\nof mean photon and two level atoms numbers and also the quantum number of\nconsidered states. Results suggest the intensity of electromagnetic fields as\ncontrol parameter which the spectral statistics change due to its variation in\nthe 0-1200 region. Also, we observed the universality in the spectral\nstatistics of considered systems when the number of two level atoms is\napproached to unrealistic limits and there are some suggestions about the\neffect of the quantum number of selected levels and the atom-field coupling\nconstant on level statistics.\n", "  It is proposed that the new generation of spintronics should be ideally\nmassless and dissipationless for the realization of ultra-fast and\nultra-low-power spintronic devices. We demonstrate that the spin-gapless\nmaterials with linear energy dispersion are unique materials that can realize\nthese massless and dissipationless states. Furthermore, we propose four new\ntypes of spin Hall effects which consist of spin accumulation of equal numbers\nof electrons and holes having the same or opposite spin polarization at the\nsample edge in Hall effect measurements, but with vanishing Hall voltage. These\nnew Hall effects can be classified as (quantum) anomalous spin Hall effects.\nThe physics for massless and dissipationless spintronics and the new spin Hall\neffects are presented for spin-gapless semiconductors with either linear or\nparabolic dispersion. New possible candidates for Dirac-type or parabolic type\nspin-gapless semiconductors are demonstrated in ferromagnetic monolayers of\nsimple oxides with either honeycomb or square lattices.\n", "  According to the separate universe conjecture, spherically symmetric\nsub-regions in an isotropic universe behave like mini-universes with their own\ncosmological parameters. This is an excellent approximation in both Newtonian\nand general relativistic theories. We estimate local expansion rates for a\nlarge number of such regions, and use a scale parameter calculated from the\nvolume-averaged increments of local scale parameters at each time step in an\notherwise standard cosmological $N$-body simulation. The particle mass,\ncorresponding to a coarse graining scale, is an adjustable parameter. This mean\nfield approximation neglects tidal forces and boundary effects, but it is the\nfirst step towards a non-perturbative statistical estimation of the effect of\nnon-linear evolution of structure on the expansion rate. Using our algorithm, a\nsimulation with an initial $\\Omega_m=1$ Einstein--de~Sitter setting closely\ntracks the expansion and structure growth history of the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. Due to small but characteristic differences, our model can be\ndistinguished from the $\\Lambda$CDM model by future precision observations.\nMoreover, our model can resolve the emerging tension between local Hubble\nconstant measurements and the Planck best-fitting cosmology. Further\nimprovements to the simulation are necessary to investigate light propagation\nand confirm full consistency with cosmic microwave background observations.\n", "  We investigate a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm (AB) ring system with a quantum\ndot (QD) embedded in each of its two arms. The energy levels of the QDs are\ncomplex in order to take into account the physical gain or loss of the ring\nsystem during its interacting processes with the environment. When there is\nmagnetic flux threading through the ring, by allocating the flux phase factor\ninto the tunneling amplitudes between the QDs and the leads in different ways,\nthe Hamiltonian of the system can be written into different formalisms. We\ncalculate the transmission through the ring by using these different\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians and prove that it is not dependent on the way we\ntreat the phase factor, as in the Hermitian case. In addition, with appropriate\nparameters, the asymmetric Fano profile will show up in the conductance\nspectrum just by tuning the physical gain and loss of the system. The Fano\neffect originates from the interferences of electrons traversing different\nchannels which are broadened or narrowed down due to the interaction between\nthe QDs and the environment. The proof we provide and the transport properties\nrevealed in this paper demonstrate the influences of the environment on an\notherwise isolated system and pave the way for the further studies on\nnon-Hermitian AB ring systems.\n", "  High energy Astroparticles include Cosmic Ray, gamma ray and neutrinos, all\nof them coming from the universe. The origin and production, acceleration and\npropagation mechanisms of ultrahigh-energy CR (up to $10^{20}$ eV) are still\nunknown. Knowledge on particle interactions taking place at those energies,\nuseful for studying current theories on particle physics, can be obtained only\nfrom measurements of high energy astroparticles. In the present document some\ntechniques on data analysis of mass composition of UHECR with the Pierre Auger\nObservatory are described. The relevance of the muon component of air showers\nproduced by the primary CR, as well as some low energy simulations of that\ncomponent, are explained.\n", "  An electric charge near the surface of a topological insulator induces an\nimage magnetic monopole. Here, we show that if the topological insulator\nsurface has a negative curvature, namely in the case of a semispherical cavity,\nthe induced Hall current reverses its rotation as the electric charge crosses\nthe semisphere geometric focus. Such a reversion is shown to be equivalent of\ninverting the charge of the image magnetic monopole. We also discuss upon the\ncase of a semicylindrical cavity, where Hall current reversion appears to be\nfeasible of probing in realistic experiments.\n", "  A common feature of many string-motivated particle physics models is\nadditional strongly coupled U(1)'s. In such sectors, electric and magnetic\nstates have comparable mass, and integrating out modes also charged under U(1)\nhypercharge generically yields CP preserving electric kinetic mixing and CP\nviolating magnetic kinetic mixing terms. Even though these extra sectors are\nstrongly coupled, we show that in the limit where the extra sector has\napproximate N = 2 supersymmetry, we can use formal methods from Seiberg-Witten\ntheory to compute these couplings. We also calculate various quantities of\nphenomenological interest such as the cross section for scattering between\nvisible sector states and heavy extra sector states, as well as the effects of\nsupersymmetry breaking induced from coupling to the MSSM.\n", "  The electronic structure of FeSe, the simplest iron based superconductor\n(Fe-SC), conceals a potential of dramatic increase of Tc that realizes under\npressure or in a single layer film. This is also the system where nematicity,\nthe phenomenon of a keen current interest, is most easy to study since it is\nnot accompanied by the antiferomagnetic transition like in all other Fe-SC's.\nHere we overview recent experimental data on electronic structure of FeSe-based\nsuperconductors: isovalently doped crystals, intercalates, and single layer\nfilms, trying to clarify its topology and possible relation of this topology to\nsuperconductivity. We argue that the marked differences between the\nexperimental and calculated band structures for all FeSe compounds can be\ndescribed by a hoping selective renormalization model for a spin/orbital\ncorrelated state that may naturally explain both the evolution of the band\nstructure with temperature and nematicity.\n", "  We study some thermodynamics quantities for the Klein-Gordon equation with a\nlinear plus inverse-linear, scalar potential. We obtain the energy eigenvalues\nwith the help of the quantization rule coming from the biconfluent Heun's\nequation. We use a method based on the Euler-MacLaurin formula to compute the\nthermal functions analytically by considering only the contribution of positive\npart of spectrum to the partition function.\n", "  Hadronic transport approaches based on an effective solution of the\nrelativistic Boltzmann equation are widely applied for the dynamical\ndescription of heavy ion reactions at low beam energies. At high densities, the\nassumption of binary interactions often used in hadronic transport approaches\nmay not be applicable anymore. Therefore, we effectively simulate the\nhigh-density regime using the local forced canonical thermalization. This\nframework provides the opportunity to interpolate in a dynamical way between\ntwo different limits of kinetic theory: the dilute gas approximation and the\nideal fluid case. This approach will be important for studies of the dynamical\nevolution of heavy ion collisions at low and intermediate energies as\nexperimentally investigated at the beam energy scan program at RHIC, and in the\nfuture at FAIR and NICA. On the other hand, this new way of modelling hot and\ndense strongly-interacting matter might be relevant for small systems at high\nenergies (LHC and RHIC) as well.\n", "  We review the problem of spin decoherence of magnetic atoms deposited on a\nsurface. Recent breakthroughs in scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) make it\npossible to probe the spin dynamics of individual atoms, either isolated or\nintegrated in nanoengineered spin structures. Transport pump and probe\ntechniques with spin polarized tips permit measuring the spin relaxation time\n$T_1$, while novel demonstration of electrically driven STM single spin\nresonance has provided a direct measurement of the spin decoherence time $T_2$\nof an individual magnetic adatom. Here we address the problem of spin\ndecoherence from the theoretical point of view. First we provide a short\ngeneral overview of decoherence in open quantum systems and we discuss with\nsome detail ambiguities that arise in the case of degenerate spectra, relevant\nfor magnetic atoms. Second, we address the physical mechanisms that allows\nprobing the spin coherence of magnetic atoms on surfaces. Third, we discuss the\nmain spin decoherence mechanisms at work on a surface, most notably, Kondo\ninteraction, but also spin-phonon coupling and dephasing by Johnson noise.\nFinally, we propose some schemes to engineer spin decoherence.\n", "  We present results from particle-in-cell simulations of driven turbulence in\nmagnetized, collisionless, and relativistic pair plasma. We find that\nfluctuations are consistent with the classical $k_\\perp^{-5/3}$ magnetic energy\nspectrum at fluid scales and a steeper $k_\\perp^{-4}$ spectrum at sub-Larmor\nscales, where $k_\\perp$ is the wavevector perpendicular to the mean field. We\ndemonstrate the development of a non-thermal, power-law particle energy\ndistribution, $f(E) \\sim E^{-\\alpha}$, with index $\\alpha$ that decreases with\nincreasing magnetization and increases with increasing system size (relative to\nthe characteristic Larmor radius). Our simulations indicate that turbulence can\nbe a viable source of energetic particles in high-energy astrophysical systems,\nsuch as pulsar wind nebulae, if scalings asymptotically become insensitive to\nthe system size.\n", "  ZnO/GaN alloys exhibit exceptional photocatalyst applications owing to the\nflexibly tunable band gaps that cover a wide range of the solar spectrum, and\nthus have attracted extensive attentions over the past few years. In this\nstudy, first-principles calculations were employed to investigate structural\nstabilities and electronic properties of (1-100) and (11-20) ZnO/GaN\nheterostructured nanofilms. The effects of nanofilm thickness and GaN ratio\nwere explored. It was found that all studied heterostructured nanofilms were\nless stable than the corresponding pure ZnO film but more stable than pure GaN\none, exhibiting a much thicker film with better stability. Electronic band\nstructures displayed that both two types of (1-100) and (11-20)\nheterostructured nanofilms were semiconductors with band gaps strongly\ndepending on the GaN ratios as well as the thicknesses. Of particular\ninteresting is that the band gaps decreased firstly, and then increased with\nthe increasing GaN ratio. Furthermore, electronic contribution to the valence\nband maximum and the conduction band minimum, and optical absorption were\ndiscussed. Our results of ZnO/GaN heterostructured nanofilms with spatial\nseparation of electrons and holes, and flexibly tunable band gaps hold great\npromise for applications in visible-photovoltaic field.\n", "  We consider a quantum system dynamics caused by successive selective and\nnon-selective measurements of the probe coupled to the system. For the finite\nmeasurement rate $\\tau^{-1}$ and the system-probe interaction strength $\\gamma$\nwe derive analytical evolution equations in the stroboscopic limit $\\tau\n\\rightarrow 0$ and $\\gamma^2 \\tau = {\\rm const}$, which can be considered as a\ndeviation from the Zeno subspace dynamics on a longer timescale $T \\sim\n(\\gamma^2 \\tau)^{-1} \\gg \\gamma^{-1}$. Non-linear quantum dynamics is analyzed\nfor selective stroboscopic projective measurements of an arbitrary rank.\nNon-selective measurements are shown to induce the semigroup dynamics of the\nsystem-probe aggregate. Both non-linear and decoherent effects become\nsignificant at the timescale $T \\sim (\\gamma^2 \\tau)^{-1}$, which is\nillustrated by a number of examples.\n", "  We study mechanisms for wavenumber selection in a minimal model for\nrun-and-tumble dynamics. We show that nonlinearity in tumbling rates induces\nthe existence of a plethora of traveling- and standing-wave patterns, as well\nas a subtle selection mechanism for the wavenumbers of spatio-temporally\nperiodic waves. We comment on possible implications for rippling patterns\nobserved in colonies of myxobacteria.\n", "  We study the driven dynamics across the critical points of the Yang-Lee edge\nsingularities (YLESes) in a finite-size quantum Ising chain with an imaginary\nsymmetry-breaking field. In contrast to the conventional classical or quantum\nphase transitions, these phase transitions are induced by tuning the strength\nof the dissipation in a non-Hermitian system and can occur even at finite size.\nFor conventional phase transitions, universal behaviors in driven dynamics\nacross critical points are usually described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism,\nwhich states that the scaling in dynamics is dictated by the critical exponents\nassociated with one critical point and topological defects will emerge after\nthe quench. While the mechanism leading to topological defects breaks down in\nthe YLES, we find that for small lattice size, the driven dynamics can still be\ndescribed by the Kibble-Zurek scaling with the exponents determined by the\n$(0+1)$-dimensional YLES. For medium finite size, however, the driven dynamics\ncan be described by the Kibble-Zurek scaling with two sets of critical\nexponents determined by both the $(0+1)$-dimensional and the\n$(1+1)$-dimensional YLESes.\n", "  We have monitored the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 1RXS\nJ180408.9-342058 in quiescence after its ~4.5 month outburst in 2015. The\nsource has been observed using Swift and XMM-Newton. Its X-ray spectra were\ndominated by a thermal component. The thermal evolution showed a gradual X-ray\nluminosity decay from ~18 x 10^32 to ~4 x 10^32 (D/5.8 kpc)^2 erg s^{-1}\nbetween ~8 and ~379 d in quiescence, and the inferred neutron star surface\ntemperature (for an observer at infinity; using a neutron star atmosphere\nmodel) decreased from ~100 to ~71 eV. This can be interpreted as cooling of an\naccretion-heated neutron star crust. Modelling the observed temperature curve\n(using NSCOOL) indicated that the source required ~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon\nof shallow heating in addition to the standard deep crustal heating to explain\nits thermal evolution. Alternatively, the decay could also be modelled without\nthe presence of deep crustal heating, only having a shallow heat source (again\n~1.9 MeV per accreted nucleon was required). However, the XMM-Newton data\nstatistically required an additional power-law component. This component\ncontributed ~30 per cent of the total unabsorbed flux in 0.5-10 keV energy\nrange. The physical origin of this component is unknown. One possibility is\nthat it arises from low-level accretion. The presence of this component in the\nspectrum complicates our cooling crust interpretation because it might indicate\nthat the smooth luminosity and temperature decay curves we observed may not be\ndue to crust cooling but due to some other process.\n", "  We develop a simple technique to accurately measure frequency differences\nbetween far lying resonances in a spectroscopy signal using a single laser.\nThis technique was used to measure the isotope shift of the cooling transition\nof metastable neon for the result of $1626.264(79)$ MHz. The most accurate\ndetermination of this value to date.\n", "  Results from the RHIC and LHC experiments show, that in relativistic heavy\nion collisions, a new state of matter, a strongly interacting perfect fluid is\ncreated. Accelerating, exact and explicit solutions of relativistic\nhydrodynamics allow for a simple and natural description of this medium. A\nfinite rapidity distribution arises from these solutions, leading to an\nadvanced estimate of the initial energy density of high energy collisions.\nThese solutions can be utilized to describe various aspects of proton-proton\ncollisions, as originally suggested by Landau. We show that an advanced\nestimate based on hydrodynamics yields an initial energy density in\n$\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV p+p collisions at LHC on the same order as the critical\nenergy density from lattice QCD, and a corresponding initial temperature around\nthe critical temperature from QCD and the Hagedorn temperature. The\nmultiplicity dependence of the estimated initial energy density suggests that\nin high multiplicity pp collisions at the LHC, there is large enough initial\nenergy density to create a non-hadronic perfect fluid.\n", "  In this work, we discuss and numerically validate a strategy to attain\nreversible macroscopic changes in the wave propagation characteristics of\ncellular metamaterials with soft microstructures. The proposed cellular\narchitecture is characterized by unit cells featuring auxiliary populations of\nsymmetrically-distributed smart cantilevers stemming from the nodal locations.\nThrough an external stimulus (the application of an electric field), we induce\nextreme, localized, reversible curling deformation of the cantilevers---a shape\nmodification which does not affect the overall shape, stiffness and load\nbearing capability of the structure. By carefully engineering the spatial\npattern of straight (non activated) and curled (activated) cantilevers, we can\ninduce several profound modifications of the phononic characteristics of the\nstructure: generation and/or shifting of total and partial bandgaps, cell\nsymmetry relaxation (which implies reconfigurable wave beaming), and chirality\nswitching. While in this work we discuss the specific case of composite\ncantilevers with a PDMS core and active layers of electrostrictive terpolymer\nP(VDF-TrFE-CTFE), the strategy can be extended to other smart materials (such\nas dielectric elastomers or shape-memory polymers).\n", "  Neurons transmit active potentials through axons, which are essential for the\nbrain to function. In this study, the axonal networks of the murine brain were\nvisualized with X-ray tomographic microscopy, also known as X-ray\nmicrotomography or micro-CT. Murine brain samples were freeze-dried to\nreconstitute the intrinsic contrast of tissue constituents and subjected to\nX-ray visualization. A whole brain hemisphere visualized by absorption contrast\nillustrated three-dimensional structures including those of the striatum,\ncorpus callosum, and anterior commissure. Axonal tracts observed in the\nstriatum start from the basal surface of the cerebral cortex and end at various\npositions in the basal ganglia. The distribution of X-ray attenuation\ncoefficients indicated that differences in water and phospholipid content\nbetween the myelin sheath and surrounding tissue constituents account for the\nobserved contrast. A rod-shaped cutout of brain tissue was also analyzed with a\nphase retrieval method, wherein tissue microstructures could be resolved with\nup to 2.7 {\\mu}m resolution. Structures of axonal networks of the striatum were\nreconstructed by tracing axonal tracts. Such an analysis should be able to\ndelineate the functional relationships of the brain regions involved in the\nobserved network.\n", "  We calculate the temperature of the atoms in the field of counter-propagating\nstochastic light waves (the chaotic-field model). We show that the temperature\nof the atomic ensemble depends on the autocorrelation time of the waves, their\nintensity and the detuning of the carrier frequency of the waves from the\natomic transition frequency. The field can form a one-dimensional trap for\natoms, as is readily seen from our previous investigation of light-pressure\nforce on an atom in counter-propagating stochastic light waves [V. I.\nRomanenko, B. W. Shore, L. P. Yatsenko, Opt. Commun. 268 (2006) 121-132]. We\ncarry out a numerical simulation of the atomic ensemble using parameters\nappropriate for sodium atoms. Analyzing the known investigation of the\nlight-pressure force on atoms and their motion in the counter-propagating\npolychromatic waves, we suggest an hypothesis that any polychromatic\ncounter-propagating waves that have a discrete spectrum, or waves described by\na stationary stochastic process, one of which repeats the other, can form a\ntrap for atoms.\n", "  This paper presents a novel explanation of the cause of quantum probabilities\nand the Born rule based on the intuitionistic interpretation of quantum\nmechanics where propositions obey constructive (intuitionistic) logic. The use\nof constructive logic makes it possible (through a replacement of the concept\nof truth with the concept of constructive probability) to abandon the law of\nexcluded middle in the intuitionistic interpretation.\n", "  Single top quark events produced in the t channel are used to set limits on\nanomalous Wtb couplings and to search for top quark flavour-changing neutral\ncurrent (FCNC) interactions. The data taken with the CMS detector at the LHC in\nproton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 and 8 TeV correspond to integrated\nluminosities of 5.0 and 19.7 inverse femtobarns, respectively. The analysis is\nperformed using events with one muon and two or three jets. A Bayesian neural\nnetwork technique is used to discriminate between the signal and backgrounds,\nwhich are observed to be consistent with the standard model prediction. The 95%\nconfidence level (CL) exclusion limits on anomalous right-handed vector, and\nleft- and right-handed tensor Wtb couplings are measured to be |f[V]^R| < 0.16,\n|f[T]^L| < 0.057, and -0.049 < f[T]^R < 0.048, respectively. For the FCNC\ncouplings kappa[tug] and kappa[tcg], the 95% CL upper limits on coupling\nstrengths are |kappa[tug]|/Lambda < 4.1E-3 TeV-1 and |kappa[tcg]|/Lambda <\n1.8E-2 TeV-1, where Lambda is the scale for new physics, and correspond to\nupper limits on the branching fractions of 2.0E-5 and 4.1E-4 for the decays t\nto ug and t to cg, respectively.\n", "  Long-range interacting many-body systems exhibit a number of peculiar and\nintriguing properties. One of those is the scaling of relaxation times with the\nnumber $N$ of particles in a system. In this paper I give a survey of results\non long-range quantum spin models that illustrate this scaling behaviour, and\nprovide indications for its common occurrence by making use of Lieb-Robinson\nbounds. I argue that these findings may help in understanding the\nextraordinarily short equilibration timescales predicted by typicality\ntechniques.\n", "  Transport in collisionless plasmas is usually called anomalous, being due to\nthe interaction between the particles and the self-generated turbulence by\ntheir collective interactions. Because of its relevance for astrophysical and\nspace plasmas, we explore the excitation of turbulence in current sheets prone\nto component- or guide-field reconnection, a process not well understood, yet.\nWe analyze the anomalous transport properties by using 2.5D Particle-in-Cell\n(PiC) code simulations. We split off the mean, slow variation (in contrast to\nthe fast turbulent fluctuations) of the macroscopic observables and determine\nthe main transport terms of the generalized Ohm's law. We verify our findings\nby comparing with the independently determined slowing-down rate of the\nmacroscopic currents and with the transport terms obtained by the first order\ncorrelations of the turbulent fluctuations. We find that the turbulence is most\nintense in the \"low density\" separatrix region of guide-field reconnection. It\nis excited by streaming instabilities, it is mainly electrostatic, \"patchy\" in\nspace and so is the associated quasi-periodic anomalous transport. The\nremaining irreversible anomalous resistivity can be parametrized by an\neffective collision frequency ranging from the local ion-cyclotron to the\nlower-hybrid frequency. The contributions to the parallel and the perpendicular\n(to the magnetic field) components of the slowly varying, DC-electric fields,\nbalanced by the turbulence, are similar. This anomalous electric field is,\nhowever, smaller than the contributions of the off-diagonal pressure and\nelectron inertia terms of the Ohm's law. This result can now be verified by\nin-situ measurements of the turbulence, in and around the magnetic reconnection\nregions of the Earth's magnetosphere by the multi-spacecraft mission MMS and in\nlaboratory experiments like MRX and VINETA-II.\n", "  The stability and other properties of a staggered flux (SF) state or a\ncorrelated d-density wave state are studied for the Hubbard (t-t'-U) model on\nextended square lattices, as a low-lying state that competes with the\nd(x2-y2)-wave superconductivity (d-SC) and possibly causes the pseudogap\nphenomena in underdoped high-Tc cuprates and organic kappa-BEDT-TTF salts. In\ncalculations, a variational Monte Carlo method is used. In the trial wave\nfunction, a configuration-dependent phase factor, which is vital to treat a\ncurrent-carrying state for a large U/t, is introduced in addition to ordinary\ncorrelation factors. Varying U/t, t'/t, and the doping rate (delta)\nsystematically, we show that the SF state becomes more stable than the normal\nstate (projected Fermi sea) for a strongly correlated (U/t\\gtrsim 5) and\nunderdoped (delta\\lesssim 0.16) area. The decrease in energy is sizable,\nparticularly in the area where Mott physics prevails and the circular current\n(order parameter) is strongly suppressed. These features are consistent with\nthose for the t-J model. The effect of the frustration t'/t plays a crucial\nrole in preserving charge homogeneity and appropriately describing the behavior\nof hole- and electron-doped cuprates and kappa-BEDT-TTF salts. We argue that\nthe SF state does not coexist with d-SC and is not a `normal state' from which\nd-SC arises. We also show that a spin current (flux or nematic) state is never\nstabilized in the same regime.\n", "  Matrix quantum mechanics offers an attractive environment for discussing\ngravitational holography, in which both sides of the holographic duality are\nwell-defined. Similarly to higher-dimensional implementations of holography,\ncollapsing shell solutions in the gravitational bulk correspond in this setting\nto thermalization processes in the dual quantum mechanical theory. We construct\nan explicit, fully nonlinear supergravity solution describing a generic\ncollapsing dilaton shell, specify the holographic renormalization prescriptions\nnecessary for computing the relevant boundary observables, and apply them to\nevaluating thermalizing two-point correlation functions in the dual matrix\ntheory.\n", "  The two-dimensional harmonic XY (HXY) model is a spin model in which the\nclassical spins interact via a piecewise parabolic potential. We argue that the\nHXY model should be regarded as the canonical classical lattice spin model of\nphase fluctuations in two-dimensional condensates, as it is the simplest model\nthat guarantees the modular symmetry of the experimental systems. Here we\nformulate a lattice electric-field representation of the HXY model and contrast\nthis with an analogous representation of the Villain model and the\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb gas with a purely rotational auxiliary field. We find\nthat the HXY model is a spin-model analogue of a lattice electric-field model\nof the Coulomb gas with an auxiliary field, but with a temperature-dependent\nvacuum (electric) permittivity that encodes the coupling of the spin vortices\nto their background spin-wave medium. The spin vortices map to the Coulomb\ncharges, while the spin-wave fluctuations correspond to auxiliary-field\nfluctuations. The coupling explains the striking differences in the\nhigh-temperature asymptotes of the specific heats of the HXY model and the\nCoulomb gas with an auxiliary field. Our results elucidate the propagation of\neffective long-range interactions throughout the HXY model (whose interactions\nare purely local) by the lattice electric fields. They also imply that global\nspin-twist excitations (topological-sector fluctuations) generated by local\nspin dynamics are ergodically excluded in the low-temperature phase. We discuss\nthe relevance of these results to condensate physics.\n", "  A simple integral relation between a complex weight and the corresponding\npositive distribution is derived by introducing a second complex variable.\nTogether with the positivity and normalizability conditions, this sum rule\nallows to construct explicitly equivalent pairs of distributions in simple\ncases. In particular the well known solution for a complex gaussian\ndistribution is generalized to an arbitrary complex slope. This opens a\npossibility of positive representation of Feynman path integrals directly in\nthe Minkowski time. Such construction is then explicitly carried through in the\nsecond part of this presentation. The continuum limit of the new representation\nexists only if some of the additional couplings tend to infinity and are tuned\nin a specific way. The approach is then successfully applied to three quantum\nmechanical examples including a particle in a constant magnetic field -- a\nsimplest prototype of a Wilson line. Further generalizations are shortly\ndiscussed and an amusing interpretation of new variables is briefly mentioned.\n", "  The computational modelling of reactions is simple in theory but can be quite\ntricky in practice. This article aims at the purpose of providing an assistance\nto a proper way of describing reactions theoretically and provides rough\nguidelines to the computational methods involved.\n  Reactions in liquid phase chemical equilibrium can be described theoretically\nin terms of the Gibbs free energy of reaction. This property can be divided\ninto a sum of three disjunct terms, namely the gas phase reaction energy, the\nfinite temperature contribution to the Gibbs free energy, and the Gibbs free\nenergy of solvation. The three contributions to the Gibbs free energy of\nreaction can be computed separately, using different theoretico--chemical\ncalculation methods. While some of these terms can be obtained reliably by\ncomputationally cheap methods, for others a high level of theory is required to\nobtain predictions of quantitative quality.\n  In order to propose workflows which can strike the balance between accuracy\nand computational cost, a number of benchmarks assessing the precision of\ndifferent levels of theory is given.\n  As an illustrative example, the low-temperature hydrogenation reaction of\nacetaldehyde to ethanol in solvent toluene is shown.\n", "  Organic semiconductors have the remarkable property that their optical\nexcitation not only generates charge-neutral electron-hole pairs (excitons) but\nalso charge-separated polaron pairs with high yield. The microscopic mechanisms\nunderlying this charge separation have been debated for many years. Here we use\nultrafast two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to study the dynamics of\npolaron pair formation in a prototypical polymer thin film on a sub-20-fs time\nscale. We observe multi-period peak oscillations persisting for up to about 1\nps as distinct signatures of vibronic quantum coherence at room temperature.\nThe measured two-dimensional spectra show pronounced peak splittings revealing\nthat the elementary optical excitations of this polymer are hybridized\nexciton-polaron-pairs, strongly coupled to a dominant underdamped vibrational\nmode. Coherent vibronic coupling induces ultrafast polaron pair formation,\naccelerates the charge separation dynamics and makes it insensitive to\ndisorder. These findings open up new perspectives for tailoring\nlight-to-current conversion in organic materials.\n", "  The radio technique is a promising method for detection of cosmic-ray air\nshowers of energies around $100\\,$PeV and higher with an array of radio\nantennas. Since the amplitude of the radio signal can be measured absolutely\nand increases with the shower energy, radio measurements can be used to\ndetermine the air-shower energy on an absolute scale. We show that calibrated\nmeasurements of radio detectors operated in coincidence with host experiments\nmeasuring air showers based on other techniques can be used for comparing the\nenergy scales of these host experiments. Using two approaches, first via direct\namplitude measurements, and second via comparison of measurements with air\nshower simulations, we compare the energy scales of the air-shower experiments\nTunka-133 and KASCADE-Grande, using their radio extensions, Tunka-Rex and\nLOPES, respectively. Due to the consistent amplitude calibration for Tunka-Rex\nand LOPES achieved by using the same reference source, this comparison reaches\nan accuracy of approximately $10\\,\\%$ - limited by some shortcomings of LOPES,\nwhich was a prototype experiment for the digital radio technique for air\nshowers. In particular we show that the energy scales of cosmic-ray\nmeasurements by the independently calibrated experiments KASCADE-Grande and\nTunka-133 are consistent with each other on this level.\n", "  A pair of resonant laser fields can drive a three-level system into a dark\nstate where it seizes to absorb and emit radiation due to destructive\ninterference. We propose a scheme to search for this resonance by randomly\nchanging the frequency of one of the fields each time a fluorescence photon is\ndetected. The longer the system is probed, the more likely the frequency is\nclose to resonance and the system populates the dark state. Due to the\ncorrespondingly long waiting times between detection events, the evolution is\nnon-ergodic and the precision of the frequency estimate does not follow from\nthe conventional Cram\\'er-Rao bound of parameter estimation. Instead, a\nL\\'{e}vy statistical analysis yields the scaling of the estimation error with\ntime for precision probing of this kind.\n", "  Many marine invertebrates have larval stages covered in linear arrays of\nbeating cilia, which propel the animal while simultaneously entraining\nplanktonic prey. These bands are strongly conserved across taxa spanning four\nmajor superphyla, and they are responsible for the unusual morphologies of many\ninvertebrate larvae. However, few studies have investigated their underlying\nhydrodynamics. Here, we study the ciliary bands of starfish larvae, and\ndiscover a beautiful pattern of slowly-evolving vortices that surrounds the\nswimming animals. Closer inspection of the bands reveals unusual ciliary\n\"tangles\" analogous to topological defects that break up and re-form as the\nanimal adjusts its swimming stroke. Quantitative experiments and modeling\ndemonstrate that these vortices create a physical tradeoff between feeding and\nswimming in heterogenous environments, which manifests as distinct flow\npatterns or \"eigen-strokes\" representing each behavior---potentially\nimplicating neuronal control of cilia. This quantitative interplay between\nlarval form and hydrodynamic function may generalize to other invertebrates\nwith ciliary bands, and illustrates the potential effects of active boundary\nconditions in other biological and synthetic systems.\n", "  We review a time-dependent version of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\nthat accounts for real-time control of system parameters, soon to be rendered\npossible on a broad basis due to technical progress. The dispersive regime of\n$N$ multilevel systems coupled to a cavity via a Jaynes-Cummings interaction is\nextended to the most general case. As a concrete example we rigorously apply\nthe technique to dispersive two-qubit gates in a superconducting architecture,\nshowing that fidelities based on previous models are off by up to $10^{-2}$,\nwhich is certainly relevant for high-fidelity gates compatible with\nfault-tolerant quantum information devices. A closed analytic form for the\nerror depending on the target evolution closes our work.\n", "  The Thermal Boundary Resistance at the interface between a nanosized Al film\nand an Al_{2}O_{3} substrate is investigated at an atomistic level. A room\ntemperature value of 1.4 m^{2}K/GW is found. The thermal dynamics occurring in\ntime-resolved thermo-reflectance experiments is then modelled via macro-physics\nequations upon insertion of the materials parameters obtained from atomistic\nsimulations. Electrons and phonons non-equilibrium and spatio-temporal\ntemperatures inhomo- geneities are found to persist up to the nanosecond time\nscale. These results question the validity of the commonly adopted lumped\nthermal capacitance model in interpreting transient nanocalorimetry\nexperiments. The strategy adopted in the literature to extract the Thermal\nBoundary Resistance from transient reflectivity traces is revised at the light\nof the present findings. The results are of relevance beyond the specific\nsystem, the physical picture being general and readily extendable to other\nheterojunctions.\n", "  We report the discovery and characterization of a novel 112-type iron\npnictide EuFeAs2, with La-doping induced superconductivity in a series of\nEu1-xLaxFeAs2. The polycrystalline samples were synthesized through solid state\nreaction method only within a very narrow temperature window around 1073 K.\nSmall single crystals were also grown from a flux method with the size about\n100 um. The crystal structure was identified by single crystal X-ray\ndiffraction analysis as a monoclinic structure with space group of P21/m. From\nresistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements, we found that the parent\ncompound EuFeAs2 shows a Fe2+ related antiferromagnetic/structural phase\ntransition near 110 K and a Eu2+ related antiferromagnetic phase transition\nnear 40 K. La doping suppressed the both phase transitions and induced\nsuperconducting transition with a Tc ~ 11 K for Eu0.85La0.15FeAs2.\n", "  Bell's theorem states that some predictions of quantum mechanics cannot be\nreproduced by a local-realist theory. That conflict is expressed by Bell's\ninequality, which is usually derived under the assumption that there are no\nstatistical correlations between the choices of measurement settings and\nanything else that can causally affect the measurement outcomes. In previous\nexperiments, this \"freedom of choice\" was addressed by ensuring that selection\nof measurement settings via conventional \"quantum random number generators\" was\nspace-like separated from the entangled particle creation. This, however, left\nopen the possibility that an unknown cause affected both the setting choices\nand measurement outcomes as recently as mere microseconds before each\nexperimental trial. Here we report on a new experimental test of Bell's\ninequality that, for the first time, uses distant astronomical sources as\n\"cosmic setting generators.\" In our tests with polarization-entangled photons,\nmeasurement settings were chosen using real-time observations of Milky Way\nstars while simultaneously ensuring locality. Assuming fair sampling for all\ndetected photons, and that each stellar photon's color was set at emission, we\nobserve statistically significant $\\gtrsim 7.31 \\sigma$ and $\\gtrsim 11.93\n\\sigma$ violations of Bell's inequality with estimated $p$-values of $ \\lesssim\n1.8 \\times 10^{-13}$ and $\\lesssim 4.0 \\times 10^{-33}$, respectively, thereby\npushing back by $\\sim$600 years the most recent time by which any local-realist\ninfluences could have engineered the observed Bell violation.\n", "  In this work, experimental and data analysis procedures were developed and\napplied for studying amino acid crystals by means of X-ray phase measurements.\nIt clearly demonstrated the sensitivity of invariant triplet phases to\nelectronic charge distribution in D-alanine crystal, providing useful\ninformation on intermolecular forces for molecular dynamics calculations.\nFeasibility of phase measurements to investigate radiation damage mechanisms is\nalso discussed on experimental and theoretical grounds.\n", "  A study on cosmic muons has been performed for the two identical near and far\nneutrino detectors of the Double Chooz experiment, placed at $\\sim$120 and\n$\\sim$300 m.w.e. underground respectively, including the corresponding\nsimulations using the MUSIC simulation package. This characterization has\nallowed to measure the muon flux reaching both detectors to be (3.64 $\\pm$\n0.04) $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the near detector and (7.00\n$\\pm$ 0.05) $\\times$ 10$^{-5}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ for the far one. The seasonal\nmodulation of the signal has also been studied observing a positive correlation\nwith the atmospheric temperature, leading to an effective temperature\ncoefficient of $\\alpha_{T}$ = 0.212 $\\pm$ 0.024 and 0.355 $\\pm$ 0.019 for the\nnear and far detectors respectively. These measurements, in good agreement with\nexpectations based on theoretical models, represent one of the first\nmeasurements of this coefficient in shallow depth installations.\n", "  The affiliation with various social groups can be a critical factor when it\ncomes to quality of life of each individual, making such groups an essential\nelement of every society. The group dynamics, longevity and effectiveness\nstrongly depend on group's ability to attract new members and keep them engaged\nin group activities. It was shown that high heterogeneity of scientist's\nengagement in conference activities of the specific scientific community\ndepends on the balance between the numbers of previous attendances and\nnon-attendances and is directly related to scientist's association with that\ncommunity. Here we show that the same holds for leisure groups of the Meetup\nwebsite and further quantify individual members' association with the group. We\nexamine how structure of personal social networks is evolving with the event\nattendance. Our results show that member's increasing engagement in the group\nactivities is primarily associated with the strengthening of already existing\nties and increase in the bonding social capital. We also show that Meetup\nsocial networks mostly grow trough big events, while small events contribute to\nthe groups cohesiveness.\n", "  We prove an explicit formula for the genus-one Fan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten\ninvariants associated to the quintic threefold, verifying the genus-one mirror\nconjecture of Huang, Klemm, and Quackenbush. The proof involves two steps. The\nfirst step uses localization on auxiliary moduli spaces to compare the usual\nFan-Jarvis-Ruan-Witten invariants with a semisimple theory of twisted\ninvariants. The second step uses the genus-one formula for semisimple\ncohomological field theories to compute the twisted invariants explicitly.\n", "  Comprehensive characterization of nanomaterials for medical applications is a\nchallenging and complex task due to the multitude of parameters which need to\nbe taken into consideration in a broad range of conditions. Routine methods\nsuch as dynamic light scattering or nanoparticle tracking analysis provide some\ninsight into the physicochemical properties of particle dispersions. For\nnanomedicine applications the information they supply can be of limited use.\nFor this reason, there is a need for new methodologies and instruments that can\nprovide additional data on nanoparticle properties such as their interactions\nwith surfaces. Nanophotonic force microscopy has been shown as a viable method\nfor measuring the force between surfaces and individual particles in the\nnano-size range. Here we outline a further application of this technique to\nmeasure the size of single particles and based on these measurement build the\ndistribution of a sample. We demonstrate its efficacy by comparing the size\ndistribution obtained with nanophotonic force microscopy to established\ninstruments, such as dynamic light scattering and differential centrifugal\nsedimentation. Our results were in good agreement to those observed with all\nother instruments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the methodology developed\nin this work can be used to study complex particle mixtures and the surface\nalteration of materials. For all cases studied, we were able to obtain both the\nsize and the interaction potential of the particles with a surface in a single\nmeasurement.\n", "  We revisit the results of one loop string amplitude calculations for the\nHeterotic string theory compactified on a torus with or without Wilson lines.\nWe give the complete elliptic genus and the harmonic part of the CP-even\namplitude for the gauge groups $SO(32)$, $E_8 \\times E_8$, $SO(16)^2$ and\n$SO(8)^4$.\n", "  We compute a new generation of standard solar models (SSMs) that includes\nrecent updates on some important nuclear reaction rates and a more consistent\ntreatment of the equation of state. Models also include a novel and flexible\ntreatment of opacity uncertainties based on opacity kernels, required in the\nlight of recent theoretical and experimental works on radiative opacity. Two\nlarge sets of SSMs, each based on a different canonical set of solar abundances\nwith high and low metallicity (Z), are computed to determine model\nuncertainties and correlations among different observables. We present detailed\ncomparisons of high- and low-Z models against different ensembles of solar\nobservables including solar neutrinos, surface helium abundance, depth of\nconvective envelope and sound speed profile. A global comparison, including all\nobservables, yields a p-value of 2.7$\\sigma$ for the high-Z model and\n4.7$\\sigma$ for the low-Z one. When the sound-speed differences in the narrow\nregion of $0.65 < r/R_{sun} < 0.70$ are excluded from the analysis, results are\n0.9$\\sigma$ and 3.0$\\sigma$ for high- and low-Z models respectively. These\nresults show that: high-Z models agree well with solar data but have a\nsystematic problem right below the bottom of the convective envelope linked to\nsteepness of molecular weight and temperature gradients, and that low-Z models\nlead to a much more general disagreement with solar data. We also show that,\nwhile simple parametrizations of opacity uncertainties can strongly alleviate\nthe solar abundance problem, they are insufficient to substantially improve the\nagreement of SSMs with helioseismic data beyond that obtained for high-Z models\ndue to the intrinsic correlations of theoretical predictions. All the detailed\ninformation of the new solar models, can be found online:\nhttp://www.ice.cat/personal/aldos/Solar_Data.html\n", "  We demonstrate the transfer of the superconducting properties of NbTi---a\nlarge-gap high-critical-field superconductor---into an InAs heterostructure via\na thin intermediate layer of epitaxial Al. Two device geometries, a Josephson\njunction and a gate-defined quantum point contact, are used to characterize\ninterface transparency and the two-step proximity effect. In the Josephson\njunction, multiple Andreev reflection reveal near-unity transparency, with an\ninduced gap $\\Delta^*=0.50~\\mathrm{meV}$ and a critical temperature of\n$7.8~\\mathrm{K}$. Tunneling spectroscopy yields a hard induced gap in the InAs\nadjacent to the superconductor of $\\Delta^*=0.43~\\mathrm{meV}$ with\nsubstructure characteristic of both Al and NbTi.\n", "  In a comment on our article Time delays in molecular photoionization [1],\nBaykusheva & W\\\"orner reproduce canonical scattering theory, and assert that\nour results are inconsistent with this well-established theory [2]. We\nabsolutely refute this assertion and the spirit of the comment, although we do\nagree with Baykusheva & W\\\"orner that the textbook theory is correct. In a\nshort response, Response to Comment on \"Time delays in molecular\nphotoionization\" [3], we have already provided a clear rebuttal of the comment,\nbut gave no technical details. In this fuller response we extend those brief\ncomments in the spirit of completeness and clarity, and provide three clear\nrebuttals to Baykusheva & W\\\"orner based on (1) logical fallacy (category\nerror), (2) theoretical details of the original article, (3) textural content\nof the original article. In particular, rebuttal (1) clearly and trivially\npoints to the fact that there is no issue here whatsoever, with recourse to\ntheoretical details barely required to demonstrate this, as outlined in the\nshort version of our response. Our numerical results are correct and reproduce\nknown physical phenomena, as discussed in the original article hence, as\ncareful readers will recognise, the formalism used is canonical scattering\ntheory, and cannot be anything other. In fact, there is no new fundamental\nphysics here to dispute whatsoever, and nor was this the raison d'etre of the\noriginal article. Additionally, rebuttal (2) provides the opportunity to\ndiscuss, at length, some of these textbook aspects of photoionization theory,\nand we hope this discussion might be of service to new researchers entering\nthis challenging field.\n", "  We study the relative entanglement entropies of one interval between excited\nstates of a 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). To compute the\nrelative entropy $S(\\rho_1 \\| \\rho_0)$ between two given reduced density\nmatrices $\\rho_1$ and $\\rho_0$ of a quantum field theory, we employ the replica\ntrick which relies on the path integral representation of ${\\rm Tr} ( \\rho_1\n\\rho_0^{n-1} )$ and define a set of R\\'enyi relative entropies $S_n(\\rho_1 \\|\n\\rho_0)$. We compute these quantities for integer values of the parameter $n$\nand derive via the replica limit, the relative entropy between excited states\ngenerated by primary fields of a free massless bosonic field. In particular, we\nprovide the relative entanglement entropy of the state described by the primary\noperator $i \\partial\\phi$, both with respect to the ground state and to the\nstate generated by chiral vertex operators. These predictions are tested\nagainst exact numerical calculations in the XX spin-chain finding perfect\nagreement.\n", "  We aim to evaluate the possibility of improving the ICRS realization starting\nfrom the ICRF2 catalogue by investigating the coordinate time series of radio\nsources observed by VLBI between 1979 and 2016. Sources with long observational\nhistory are selected as the candidates and the least squares fits with special\nhandling of the weights are performed to derive the linear drifts of the source\ncoordinates. Then the sources are sorted based on the normalized linear drift\n(i) over the whole sky and (ii) in four homolographic areas divided by\ndeclinations. The axial stability of the reference system and sky distribution\ndefined by the selected sources are evaluated, which are acted as the criterion\nfor the final source lists. With our improved source selection scheme, two\ngroups of sources are proposed and considered suitable for defining a more\nstable and homogeneous celestial reference system compared to the current\nICRF2. The number of sources in the final lists are 323 and 294, respectively,\nand the global rotation of the axes derived from apparent motion of the sources\nare about two times better than the ICRF2.\n", "  Weak interlayer van der Waals interactions in bulk crystals facilitate their\nmechanical exfoliation to monolayer and few-layer two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials, which exhibit striking physical phenomena absent in their bulk form.\nHere we study a 2D form of a mineral franckeite and show that phase segregation\ninto discrete layers at the sub-nanometre scale facilitates its layered\nstructure and basal cleavage. This behaviour is likely to be common in a wider\nfamily of complex crystals and could be exploited for a single-step synthesis\nof van der Waals heterostructures, as an alternative to stacking of 2D\nmaterials. Mechanical exfoliation allowed us to produce crystals down to a\nsingle unit cell thickness and rationalise its basal cleavage by\natomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). We\ndemonstrate p-type electrical conductivity and remarkable electrochemical\nproperties in exfoliated crystals, which shows promise for energy storage\napplications.\n", "  We have studied the phase transition of the contact process near a multiple\njunction of $M$ semi-infinite chains by Monte Carlo simulations. As opposed to\nthe continuous transitions of the translationally invariant ($M=2$) and\nsemi-infinite ($M=1$) system, the local order parameter is found to be\ndiscontinuous for $M>2$. Furthermore, the temporal correlation length diverges\nalgebraically as the critical point is approached, but with different exponents\non the two sides of the transition. In the active phase, the estimate is\ncompatible with the bulk value, while in the inactive phase it exceeds the bulk\nvalue and increases with $M$. The unusual local critical behavior is explained\nby a scaling theory with an irrelevant variable, which becomes dangerous in the\ninactive phase. Quenched spatial disorder is found to make the transition\ncontinuous in agreement with earlier renormalization group results.\n", "  We report optical positioning single quantum dots (QDs) in planar cavity with\nan average position uncertainty $<$20 nm using an optimized two-color\nphotoluminescence imaging technique. We create single-photon sources based on\nthese QDs in determined micropillar cavities. The brightness of the QD\nfluorescence is greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the\ncavity, leading to an high extraction efficiency of 68%$\\pm$6% into a lens with\nnumerical aperture of 0.65, and simultaneously exhibiting low multi-photon\nprobability ($g^{2}(0)$=0.144$\\pm$0.012) at this collection efficiency.\n", "  We report on the energetics of molecular outflows in 14 local Ultraluminous\nInfrared Galaxies (ULIRGs) that show unambiguous outflow signatures (P-Cygni\nprofiles or high-velocity absorption wings) in the far-infrared lines of OH\nmeasured with the Herschel/PACS spectrometer. Detection of both ground-state\n(at 119 and 79 um) and one or more radiatively-excited (at 65 and 84 um) lines\nallows us to model the nuclear gas (<~300 pc) as well as the more extended\ncomponents using spherically symmetric radiative transfer models. The highest\nmolecular outflow velocities are found in buried sources, in which slower but\nmassive expansion of the nuclear gas is also observed. With the exception of a\nfew outliers, the outflows have momentum fluxes of (2-5)xL_IR/c and mechanical\nluminosities of (0.1-0.3)% of L_IR. The moderate momentum boosts in these\nsources (<~3) suggest that the outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the\ncombined effects of AGN and nuclear starbursts, as a result of radiation\npressure, winds, and supernovae remnants. In some sources (~20%), however,\npowerful (10^{10.5-11} Lsun) AGN feedback and (partially) energy-conserving\nphases are required, with momentum boosts in the range 3-20. These outflows\nappear to be stochastic strong-AGN feedback events that occur throughout the\nmerging process. In a few sources, the outflow activity in the innermost\nregions has subsided in the last ~1 Myr. While OH traces the molecular outflows\nat sub-kpc scales, comparison of the masses traced by OH with those previously\ninferred from tracers of more extended outflowing gas suggests that most mass\nis loaded (with loading factors of Mdot/SFR=1-10) from the central galactic\ncores (a few x 100 pc). Outflow depletion timescales are <10^8 yr, shorter than\nthe gas consumption timescales by factors of 1.1-15, and are anti-correlated\nwith the AGN luminosity.\n", "  Under the weak interaction regime, we prove the one and the two volumes\nWegner type bounds for one dimensional multi-particle models on the lattice and\nfor very singular probability distribution functions such as the Bernoulli\nmeasures. The results imply the Anderson loclalization in both the spectral\nexponential and the strong dynamical localization for the one dimensional\nmulti-particle Bernoulli-Anderson model with weak interaction.\n", "  A new method to solve the Dirac equation on a 3D lattice is proposed, in\nwhich the variational collapse problem is avoided by the inverse Hamiltonian\nmethod and the fermion doubling problem is avoided by performing spatial\nderivatives in momentum space with the help of the discrete Fourier transform,\ni.e., the spectral method. This method is demonstrated in solving the Dirac\nequation for a given spherical potential in 3D lattice space. In comparison\nwith the results obtained by the shooting method, the differences in single\nparticle energy are smaller than $10^{-4}$~MeV, and the densities are almost\nidentical, which demonstrates the high accuracy of the present method. The\nresults obtained by applying this method without any modification to solve the\nDirac equations for an axial deformed, non-axial deformed, and octupole\ndeformed potential are provided and discussed.\n", "  We fabricate high-mobility p-type few-layer WSe2 field-effect transistors and\nsurprisingly observe a series of quantum Hall (QH) states following an\nunconventional sequence predominated by odd-integer states under a moderate\nstrength magnetic field. By tilting the magnetic field, we discover Landau\nlevel (LL) crossing effects at ultra-low coincident angles, revealing that the\nZeeman energy is about three times as large as the cyclotron energy near the\nvalence band top at {\\Gamma} valley. This result implies the significant roles\nplayed by the exchange interactions in p-type few-layer WSe2, in which\nitinerant or QH ferromagnetism likely occurs. Evidently, the {\\Gamma} valley of\nfew-layer WSe2 offers a unique platform with unusually heavy hole-carriers and\na substantially enhanced g-factor for exploring strongly correlated phenomena.\n", "  Robustness of any statistics depends upon the number of assumptions it makes\nabout the measured data. We point out the advantages of median statistics using\ntoy numerical experiments and demonstrate its robustness, when the number of\nassumptions we can make about the data are limited. We then apply the median\nstatistics technique to obtain estimates of two constants of nature, Hubble\nConstant ($H_0$) and Newton's Gravitational Constant($G$), both of which show\nsignificant differences between different measurements. For $H_0$, we update\nthe analysis done by Chen and Ratra (2011) and Gott et al. (2001) using $576$\nmeasurements. We find after grouping the different results according to their\nprimary type of measurement, the median estimates are given by\n$H_0=72.5^{+2.5}_{-8}$ km/sec/Mpc with errors corresponding to 95% c.l.\n(2$\\sigma$) and $G=6.674702^{+0.0014}_{-0.0009} \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{N\nm^{2}kg^{-2}}$ corresponding to 68% c.l. (1$\\sigma$).\n", "  We report on the development of a microfabricated atomic magnetic gradiometer\nbased on optical spectroscopy of alkali atoms in the vapor phase. The\ngradiometer, which operates in the spin-exchange relaxation free regime, has a\nlength of 60 mm and cross sectional diameter of 12 mm, and consists of two\nchip-scale atomic magnetometers which are interrogated by a common laser light.\nThe sensor can measure differences in magnetic fields, over a 20 mm baseline,\nof 10 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ at frequencies above 20 Hz. The maximum rejection of\nmagnetic field noise is 1000 at 10 Hz. By use of a set of compensation coils\nwrapped around the sensor, we also measure the sensor sensitivity at several\nexternal bias field strengths up to 150 mG. This device is useful for\napplications that require both sensitive gradient field information and high\ncommon-mode noise cancellation.\n", "  Study of the combined effects of strong electronic correlations with\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) represents a central issue in quantum materials\nresearch. Predicting emergent properties represents a huge theoretical problem\nsince the presence of SOC implies that the spin is not a good quantum number.\nExisting theories propose the emergence of a multitude of exotic quantum\nphases, distinguishable by either local point symmetry breaking or local spin\nexpectation values, even in materials with simple cubic crystal structure such\nas Ba$_2$NaOsO$_6$. Experimental tests of such theories by local probes are\nhighly sought for. Here, we report on local measurements designed to\nconcurrently probe spin and orbital/lattice degrees of freedom of\nBa$_2$NaOsO$_6$. We find that a novel canted ferromagnetic phase which is\npreceded by local point symmetry breaking is stabilized at low temperatures, as\npredicted by quantum theories involving multipolar spin interactions.\n", "  Three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TIs) represent novel states of\nquantum matters in which surface states are protected by time-reversal symmetry\nand an inversion occurs between bulk conduction- and valence-bands. However,\nthe bulk-band inversion which is intimately tied to the topologically\nnontrivial nature of 3D TIs has rarely been investigated by experiments.\nBesides, 3D massive Dirac fermions with nearly near band dispersions were\nseldom observed in TIs. Recently, a van der Waals crystal, ZrTe5, was\ntheoretically predicted to be a TI. Here, we report an infrared transmission\nstudy of a high-mobility (~33,000 cm$^2$/(Vs)) multilayer ZrTe5 flake at\nmagnetic fields ($B$) up to 35 T. Our observation of a linear relationship\nbetween the zero-magnetic-field optical absorption and the photon energy, a\nbandgap of ~10 meV and a $\\sqrt{B}$ dependence of the Landau level (LL)\ntransition energies at low magnetic fields demonstrates 3D massive Dirac\nfermions with nearly linear band dispersions in this system. More importantly,\nthe reemergence of the intra-LL transitions at magnetic fields higher than 17 T\nreveals the energy cross between the two zeroth LLs, which reflects the\ninversion between the bulk conduction- and valence-bands. Our results not only\nprovide spectroscopic evidence for the TI state in ZrTe5 but also open up a new\navenue for fundamental studies of Dirac fermions in van der Waals materials.\n", "  We investigate the local electronic structure of a Sinai-like, quadrilateral\ngraphene quantum billiard with zigzag and armchair edges using scanning\ntunneling microscopy at room temperature. It is revealed that besides the\n$(\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3})R30${\\deg} superstructure, which is caused by the\nintervalley scattering, its overtones also appear in the STM measurements,\nwhich are attributed to the Umklapp processes. We point out that these results\ncan be well understood by taking into account the Coulomb interaction in the\nquantum billiard, accounting for both the measured density of state values and\nthe experimentally observed topography patterns. The analysis of the\nlevel-spacing distribution substantiates the experimental findings as well. We\nalso reveal the magnetic properties of our system which should be relevant in\nfuture graphene based electronic and spintronic applications.\n", "  Quantum curves were introduced in the physics literature. We develop a\nmathematical framework for the case associated with Hitchin spectral curves. In\nthis context, a quantum curve is a Rees $\\mathcal{D}$-module on a smooth\nprojective algebraic curve, whose semi-classical limit produces the Hitchin\nspectral curve of a Higgs bundle. We give a method of quantization of Hitchin\nspectral curves by concretely constructing one-parameter deformation families\nof opers.\n  We propose a generalization of the topological recursion of Eynard-Orantin\nand Mirzakhani for the context of singular Hitchin spectral curves. We show a\nsurprising result that a PDE version of the topological recursion provides\nall-order WKB analysis for the Rees $\\mathcal{D}$-modules, defined as the\nquantization of Hitchin spectral curves associated with meromorphic\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles. Topological recursion is thus identified as a\nprocess of quantization of Hitchin spectral curves. We prove that these two\nquantizations, one via the construction of families of opers, and the other via\nthe PDE topological recursion, agree for holomorphic and meromorphic\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$-Higgs bundles.\n  Classical differential equations such as the Airy differential equation\nprovides a typical example. Through these classical examples, we see that\nquantum curves relate Higgs bundles, opers, a conjecture of Gaiotto, and\nquantum invariants, such as Gromov-Witten invariants.\n", "  Analysis of single-molecule micromanipulation experiments of DNA unzipping\nprocess shows some features of the force-distance curve, namely two consequent\nplateaus in the area of ${\\sim}12-14pN$ dependent on nucleotide sequence\nstructure, as well as peaks appearance in the plateau area, to which it was not\npaid essential attention earlier. Using atom-atom potential function method the\nestimations of Watson-Crick base pairs opening energies are made. On the basis\nof this results two possible scenarios of the DNA double helix unzipping\nprocess are proposed. According to the first scenario DNA unzipping takes place\nslowly and as equilibrium process, with small difference between two plateaus\non the unzipping curve. In this case firstly base pairs transit into the\n'pre-opened' metastable state along the 'opening' pathway and then open along\nthe 'stretch' pathway. Our estimations show that an important factor for the\nrealization of this scenario is the existence of double-stranded DNA coil in\nthe unopened part of DNA. The second scenario is characterized by higher\nopening force. In this scenario base pairs open directly along the 'stretch'\npathway as non-equilibrium process. The conditions of the first scenario\nrealization show that it can play a key role in the understanding of the DNA\nunzipping in vivo during transcription and genetic information transfer\nprocesses.\n", "  We study the location of the transmission eigenvalues in the isotropic case\nwhen the restrictions of the refraction indices on the boundary coincide. Under\nsome natural conditions we show that there exist parabolic transmission\neigenvalue-free regions.\n", "  If a magnetic polarization excess is locally injected in a crystal of\ninteracting spins, this \"excitation\" would spread as consequence of spin-spin\ninteractions. Such an apparently irreversible process is known as spin\ndiffusion and it can lead the system back to \"equilibrium\". Even so, a unitary\nquantum dynamics would ensure a precise memory of the non-equilibrium initial\ncondition. Then, if at certain time, say $t/2$, an experimental protocol\nreverses the many-body dynamics, it would drive the system back to the initial\nnon-equilibrium state at time $t$. As a matter of fact, the reversal is always\nperturbed by small experimental imperfections and/or uncontrolled internal or\nenvironmental degrees of freedom. This limits the amount of signal $M(t)$\nrecovered locally at time $t$. The degradation of $M(t)$ accounts for these\nperturbations, which can also be seen as the sources of decoherence. This idea\ndefines the Loschmidt echo (LE), which embodies the various time-reversal\nprocedures implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance. Here, we present an\ninvitation to the study of the LE following the pathway induced by the\nexperiments. With such a purpose, we provide a historical and conceptual\noverview that briefly revisits selected phenomena that underlie the LE\ndynamics, ultimately leading to the discussion of irreversibility as an\nemergent phenomenon. In addition, we introduce the LE formalism by means of\nspin-spin correlation functions and we present new results that could trigger\nnew experiments and theoretical ideas. In particular, we propose to transform\nan initially localized excitation into a more complex initial state, enabling a\ndynamically prepared LE. This induces a global definition of the LE in terms of\nthe raw overlap between many-body wave functions. Our results show that as the\ncomplexity of the prepared state increases, it becomes more fragile towards\nsmall perturbations.\n", "  The recent study on the the 6-year up-going muon neutrinos by the IceCube\nCollaboration and the multi-messenger analyses support the hypothesis of a\ntwo-component scenario explaining the diffuse TeV-PeV neutrino flux. Depending\non the steepness of the astrophysical power-law, an excess in the IceCube data\nis shown in the energy range 10-100 TeV (low-energy excess) or at PeV\n(high-energy excess). In both cases, we characterize a two-component neutrino\nflux where decaying Dark Matter particles provide a contribution to the IceCube\nobservations.\n", "  This work presents a systematic review of the feature-rich essential\nproperties in graphene-related systems using the first-principles method. The\ngeometric and electronic properties are greatly diversified by the number of\nlayers, the stacking configurations, the sliding-created configuration\ntransformation, the rippled structures, and the distinct adatom adsorptions.\nThe top-site adsorptions can induce the significantly buckled structures,\nespecially for hydrogen and fluorine adatoms. The electronic structures consist\nof the carbon-, adatom- and (carbon, adatom)-dominated energy bands. There\nexist the linear, parabolic, partially flat, sombrero-shaped and oscillatory\nband, accompanied with various kinds of critical points. The semi-metallic or\nsemiconducting behaviors of graphene systems are dramatically changed by the\nmulti- or single-orbital chemical bondings between carbons and adatoms.\nGraphene oxides and hydrogenated graphenes possess the tunable energy gaps.\nFluorinated graphenes might be semiconductors or hole-doped metals, while other\nhalogenated systems belong to the latter. Alkali- and Al-doped graphenes\nexhibit the high-density free electrons in the preserved Dirac cones. The\nferromagnetic spin configuration is revealed in hydrogenated and halogenated\ngraphenes under certain distributions. Specifically, Bi nano-structures are\nformed by the interactions between monolayer graphene and buffer layer.\nStructure and adatom-enriched essential properties are compared with the\nmeasured results, and potential applications are also discussed.\n", "  Recent progresses in lattice studies of heavy quark and quarkonium at\nnon-zero temperature are discussed. Formulating a tail of spectral functions as\na transport coefficient allows lattice determination of momentum diffusion\ncoefficient ($\\kappa$) for charm quark in the heavy quark mass limit and\nlattice determination of heavy quark/heavy anti-quark chemical equilibration\nrate in NRQCD. Quenched lattice study on a large volume gives $\\kappa/T^3 = 1.8\n\\cdots 3.4$ in the continuum limit. A recent study with $N_f = 2+1$\nconfigurations estimates the charmonium chemical equilibration rate\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm chem}$. At $T = 400$ MeV with $M \\sim 1.5$ GeV, $\\Gamma_{\\rm\nchem}^{-1} \\sim 150$ fm/c. Earlier results from the two studies (with different\nlattice setups and with different Bayesian priors) which calculate bottomonium\ncorrelators using NRQCD and employ Bayesian method to calculate spectral\nfunctions are summarized: $\\Upsilon (1S)$ survives upto $T \\sim 1.9 T_c$ and\nexcited states of $\\Upsilon$ are sequentially suppressed. The spectral\nfunctions of $\\chi_{b1}$ channel shows a Bayesian prior dependence of its\nthermal behavior: the $\\chi_{b1}$ spectral function with MEM prior shows\nmelting above $T_c$ but that with a new Bayesian prior hints survival of\n$\\chi_{b1}$ upto $\\sim 1.6 T_c$. Preliminary results from the efforts to\nunderstand the difference in the behavior of $\\chi_{b1}$ spectral function is\ngiven.\n", "  Recently, we have a confidence that neutrino has a tiny mass and mixing does\nexist among neutrino flovors as one can see from experimental data that\nreported by many collaborations. Based on experimental data that flavor mixing\ndoes exist in neutrino sector which imply that all three mixing angles are\nnonzero, we derive the neutrino mass matrix from a cobimaximal neutrino mixing\nmatrix. We also evaluate the prediction of neutrino mass matrix with texture\nzero from a cobimaximal neutrino mixing matrix on neutrino masses and effective\nMajorana mass. By using the advantages of experimental data, the obtained\nneutrino masses are $m_{1}=0.028188$ eV, $m_{2}=0.029488$ eV, and\n$m_{3}=0.057676$ eV, and the effective Majorana mass is\n$\\left<m_{\\beta\\beta}\\right>=0.09896$ eV that can be tested in future\nneutrinoless double beta decay experiments\n", "  The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for more than one\nbillion sources brighter than G=20.7 mag. Gaia offers the unprecedented\nopportunity to study variability phenomena in the Universe thanks to\nmulti-epoch G-magnitude photometry in addition to astrometry, blue and red\nspectro-photometry, and spectroscopy. Within the Gaia Consortium, Coordination\nUnit 7 has the responsibility to detect variable objects, classify them, derive\ncharacteristic parameters for specific variability classes, and provide global\ndescriptions of variable phenomena.\n  We describe the variability processing and analysis that we plan to apply to\nthe successive data releases, and we present its application to the G-band\nphotometry results of the first 14 months of Gaia operations that comprises 28\ndays of Ecliptic Pole Scanning Law and 13 months of Nominal Scanning Law.\n  Out of the 694 million, all-sky, sources that have calibrated G-band\nphotometry in this first stage of the mission, about 2.3 million sources that\nhave at least 20 observations are located within 38 degrees from the South\nEcliptic Pole. We detect about 14% of them as variable candidates, among which\nthe automated classification identified 9347 Cepheid and RR Lyrae candidates.\nAdditional visual inspections and selection criteria led to the publication of\n3194 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, described in Clementini et al. (2016). Under\nthe restrictive conditions for DR1, the completenesses of Cepheids and RR Lyrae\nstars are estimated at 67% and 58%, respectively, numbers that will\nsignificantly increase with subsequent Gaia data releases.\n  Data processing within the Gaia Consortium is iterative, the quality of the\ndata and the results being improved at each iteration. The results presented in\nthis article show a glimpse of the exceptional harvest that is to be expected\nfrom the Gaia mission for variability phenomena. [abridged]\n", "  Arctic sea ice extent has declined continuously for the past decade, owing\npartially to light absorption by black carbon (BC) and other impurities\ndeposited on snow and the underlying pack. We present simulations for the\ncontemporary period showing that the optical depth contributed by Arctic ice\nalgal chlorophyll may be comparable during Boreal Spring to the corresponding\nvalues attributable to BC. The largest chlorophyll attenuation is obtained in\nthe bottom layer, which supports pigment concentrations of about 300 to 1000\nmg/m3 in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. However, chlorophyll concentrations\nfor the ice interior in regions north of 75{\\deg} N and across the Canadian\nArchipelago are less than 0.1 micro g/m3. Freeboard and infiltration\ncommunities lead to intermediate levels of light removal. Since BC works its\nway downward from the atmospheric interface, there will be regions where it\nappropriates photosynthetic capability. Where ice thicknesses permit\nsignificant penetration through the pack column the ice algae may be crucial\nabsorbers. We propose a continuous increase in relative chlorophyll activity\nand attenuation in the future, as biological activity becomes stronger in thin\nice toward the center of the Arctic basin. A shift in relative importance of\nthe two absorber types could occur as total BC mixing ratios are reduced\nbecause of environmental advocacy.\n", "  Recent observations of changes in radioactive decay rates associated with the\nannual variation of the Earth-Sun distance, with solar rotation, and\nparticularly with solar storms, suggest that radioactive decay rates may be\nresponding to small changes in ambient neutrino/antineutrino flux. We propose\nto build a network of detectors (NU-SETI), based on monitoring radioactive\ndecays, to search for pulsed signals from an extra-terrestrial source carried\nby neutrinos or antineutrinos.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors have attracted great attention in recent\nyears due to the possibility of new phenomena in lower dimensions. With many\nbulk transition metal carbides being well-known conventional superconductors,\nhere we perform first-principles calculations to evaluate the possible\nsuperconductivity in a 2D monolayer Mo$_2$C. Three candidate structures\n(monolayer alpha-Mo$_2$C, 1T MXene-Mo$_2$C, and 2H MXene-Mo$_2$C) are\nconsidered and the most stable form is found to be the 2H MXene-Mo$_2$C.\nElectronic structure calculations indicate that both unpassivated and\npassivated 2H forms exhibit metallic properties. We obtain the phonon\nfrequencies and electron-phonon couplings using density-functional perturbation\ntheory, and based on the BCS theory and McMillan equation, estimate the\ncritical temperatures to be in the ~0-13 K range, depending on the species of\nthe surface termination (O, H and OH). The most interesting termination group\nis H, which can increase the electron-phonon coupling and bring the critical\ntemperature to 13 K. This shows a rather high critical temperature, tunable by\nsurface termination, making this 2D carbide an interesting test bed for\nlow-dimensional superconductivity.\n", "  We review experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at a detailed\nunderstanding of the recombination of electrons with highly-charged tungsten\nions characterised by an open 4f sub-shell. Highly-charged tungsten occurs as a\nplasma contaminant in ITER-like tokamak experiments, where it acts as an\nunwanted cooling agent. Modelling of the charge state populations in a plasma\nrequires reliable thermal rate coefficients for charge-changing electron\ncollisions. The electron recombination of medium-charged tungsten species with\nopen 4f sub-shells is especially challenging to compute reliably. Storage-ring\nexperiments have been conducted that yielded recombination rate coefficients at\nhigh energy resolution and well-understood systematics. Significant deviations\ncompared to simplified, but prevalent, computational models have been found. A\nnew class of ab-initio numerical calculations has been developed that provides\nreliable predictions of the total plasma recombination rate coefficients for\nthese ions.\n", "  In this paper, the quasinormal modes of gravitational perturbation around\nsome well-known regular black holes were evaluated by using the WKB\napproximation as well as the asymptotic iteration method. Through numerical\ncalculation, we make a detailed analysis of the gravitational QNM frequencies\nby varying the characteristic parameters of the gravitational perturbation and\nthe spacetime charge parameters of the regular black holes. It is found that\nthe imaginary part of quasinormal modes as a function of the charge parameter\nhas different monotonic behaviors for different black hole spacetimes.\nMoreover, the asymptotic expressions of gravitational QNMs for $l \\gg 1$ are\nobtained by using the eikonal limit method. We demonstrate that the\ngravitational perturbation is stable in all these spacetimes.\n", "  The distribution of the geometric distances of connected neurons is a\npractical factor underlying neural networks in the brain. It can affect the\nbrain\\'s dynamic properties at the ground level. Karbowski derived a power-law\ndecay distribution that has not yet been verified by experiment. In this work,\nwe check its validity using simulations with a phenomenological model. Based on\nthe in vitro two-dimensional development of neural networks in culture vessels\nby Ito, we match the synapse number saturation time to obtain suitable\nparameters for the development process, then determine the distribution of\ndistances between connected neurons under such conditions. Our simulations\nobtain a clear exponential distribution instead of a power-law one, which\nindicates that Karbowski's conclusion is invalid, at least for the case of in\nvitro neural network development in two-dimensional culture vessels.\n", "  We give a new proof of Ciocan-Fontanine and Kim's wall-crossing formula\nrelating the virtual classes of the moduli spaces of $\\epsilon$-stable\nquasimaps for different $\\epsilon$ in any genus, whenever the target is a\ncomplete intersection in projective space and there is at least one marked\npoint.\n  Our techniques involve a twisted graph space, which we expect to generalize\nto yield wall-crossing formulas for general gauged linear sigma models.\n", "  I report on the status of the studies of top-quark properties carried out by\nthe Tevatron experiments CDF and D0.\n", "  Gapless boundary modes at the interface between topologically distinct\nregions are one of the most salient manifestations of topology in physics.\nMetallic boundary states of time-reversal-invariant topological insulators\n(TIs), a realization of topological order in condensed matter, have been of\nmuch interest not only due to such a fundamental nature, but also due to their\npractical significance. These boundary states are immune to backscattering and\nlocalization owing to their topological origin, thereby opening up the\npossibility to tailor them for potential uses in spintronics and quantum\ncomputing. The heterojunction between a TI and a normal insulator (NI) is a\nrepresentative playground for exploring such a topologically protected metallic\nboundary state and expected to constitute a building block for future\nelectronic and spintronic solid-state devices based on TIs. Here, we report a\nfirst-principles study of two experimentally realized lattice-matched\nheterojunctions between TIs and NIs, Bi$_2$Se$_3$(0001)/InP(111) and\nBi$_2$Te$_3$(0001)/BaF$_2$(111). We evaluate the band offsets at these\ninterfaces from many-body perturbation theory within the $GW$ approximation as\nwell as density-functional theory. Furthermore, we investigate the topological\ninterface states, demonstrating that at these lattice-matched heterointerfaces\nthey are strictly localized and their helical spin textures are as well\npreserved as those at the vacuum-facing surfaces. These results taken together\nmay help in designing devices relying on spin-helical metallic boundary states\nof TIs.\n", "  Metallic nanocrystals (NCs) are useful instruments for light manipulation\naround the visible spectrum. As their plasmonic resonances depend heavily on\nthe NC geometry, modern fabrication techniques afford a great degree of control\nover their optical responses. We take advantage of this fact to create optical\nfilters in the visible-near IR. Our systems show an extinction spectrum that\ncovers a wide range of wavelengths (UV to mid-IR), while featuring a narrow\ntransparency band around a wavelength of choice. We achieve this by carefully\nselecting the geometries of a collection of NCs with narrow resonances that\ncover densely the spectrum from UV to mid-IR except for the frequencies\ntargeted for transmission. This fundamental design can be executed in different\nkinds of systems, including a solution of colloidal metal NCs (metafluids), a\nstructured planar metasurface or a combination of both. Along with the theory,\nwe report experimental results, showing metasurface realizations of the system,\nand we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these different approaches,\npaying particular attention to particle-particle interaction and to what extent\nit hinders the intended objective by shifting and modifying the profile of the\nplanned resonances through the hybridization of their plasmonic modes. We have\nfound that the Beer-Lambert law is very robust overall and is violated only\nupon aggregation or in configurations with nearly-touching NCs. This striking\nproperty favors the creation of metafluids with a narrow transparency window,\nwhich are investigated here.\n", "  In this paper we briefly review the most general form of GUP motivated from\nnonlocal quantum mechanics discussed in detail by S. Masood, {\\em et al}. We\napply the special limit of this GUP form to the one-dimension linear potential\nto calculate the energy correction and the modified wave function. We also\ndiscuss the deformation effect on one dimensional delta potential well and one\ndimensional delta potential barrier. Moreover, we pay attention to the\ndeformation effect on one dimensional hydrogen atom and investigate the Stark\neffect on the atom separately. Finally, we make a short conclusion.\n", "  The attainability of modification of the apparent magnetic anisotropy in\n(III,Mn)V ferromagnetic semiconductors is probed by means of the\nfinite-elements-based modelling. The most representative case of (Ga,Mn)As and\nits in-plane uniaxial anisotropy is investigated. The hysteresis loops of the\ncontinuous films of a ferromagnetic semiconductor as well as films structured\nwith the elliptic antidots are modelled for various eccentricity, orientation,\nand separation of the anti dots. The effect of anti-dots on the magnetic\nanisotropy is confirmed but overall is found to be very weak. The subsequent\nmodelling for (Ga,Mn)As film with the elliptic dots comprising of metallic NiFe\nshows much stronger effect, revealing switching of the magnetic moment in the\nferromagnetic semiconductor governed by the switching behavior of the metallic\ninclusions.\n", "  This note is meant to invite the reader to consider interaction nets, a\nrelatively recently discovered model of computation, as a possible alternative\nfor cellular automata which are often employed as the basis for digital\nphysics. Defined as graph-like structures (in contrast to the grids for\ncellular automata), interaction nets possess a set of interesting properties,\nsuch as locality, linearity, and strong confluence, which together result in\nso-called clockless computation in the sense that they do not require any\nglobal clock in order to operate. We believe that an attempt of using\ninteraction nets as a replacement for cellular automata may lead to a new view\nin digital physics.\n", "  We report on reversible electric-field-driven magnetic domain wall motion in\na Cu/Ni multilayer on a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ substrate. In our\nheterostructure, strain-coupling to ferroelastic domains with in-plane and\nperpendicular polarization in the BaTiO$_3$ substrate causes the formation of\ndomains with perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, respectively, in\nthe Cu/Ni multilayer. Walls that separate magnetic domains are elastically\npinned onto ferroelectric domain walls. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect\nmicroscopy, we demonstrate that out-of-plane electric field pulses across the\nBaTiO$_3$ substrate move the magnetic and ferroelectric domain walls in unison.\nOur experiments indicate an exponential increase of domain wall velocity with\nelectric field strength and opposite domain wall motion for positive and\nnegative field pulses. Magnetic fields do not affect the velocity of magnetic\ndomain walls, but independently tailor their internal spin structure, causing a\nchange in domain wall dynamics at high velocities.\n", "  We demonstrate parallel composite quantum logic gates with phases implemented\nlocally through nanoscale movement of ions within a global laser beam of fixed\npulse duration. We show that a simple four-pulse sequence suffices for\nconstructing ideal arbitrary single-qubit rotations in the presence of large\nintensity inhomogeneities across the ion trap due to laser beam-pointing or\nbeam-focusing. Using such sequences, we perform parallel arbitrary rotations on\nions in two trapping zones separated by 700 $\\mu$m with fidelities comparable\nto those of our standard laser-controlled gates. Our scheme improves on current\ntransport or zone-dependent quantum gates to include phase modulation with\nlocal control of the ion's confinement potential. This enables a scalable\nimplementation of an arbitrary number of parallel operations on densely packed\nqubits with a single laser modulator and beam path.\n", "  Hot line lists for two isotopologues of water, \\octo\\ and \\heto, are\npresented. The calculations employ newly constructed potential energy surfaces\n(PES) which take advantage of a novel method for using the large set of\nexperimental energy levels for \\hato\\ to give high quality predictions for\n\\octo\\ and \\heto. This procedure greatly extends the energy range for which a\nPES can be accurately determined, allowing accurate prediction of higher-lying\nenergy levels than are currently known from direct laboratory measurements.\nThis PES is combined with a high-accuracy, {\\it ab initio} dipole moment\nsurface of water in the computation of all energy levels, transition\nfrequencies and associated Einstein A coefficients for states with rotational\nexcitation up to $J=50$ and energies up to 30~000 \\cm. The resulting HotWat78\nline lists complement the well-used BT2 \\hato\\ line list (Barber et.al, 2006,\nMNRAS, {\\bf 368}, 1087). Full line lists are made available in the electronic\nform as supplementary data to this article and at \\url{www.exomol.com}.\n", "  The uniformly hyperbolic Anosov C-systems defined on a torus have exponential\ninstability of their trajectories, and as such C-systems have mixing of all\norders and nonzero Kolmogorov entropy. The mixing property of all orders means\nthat all its correlation functions tend to zero and the question of a\nfundamental interest is a speed at which they tend to zero. It was proven that\nthe speed of decay in the C-systems is exponential, that is, the observables on\nthe phase space become independent and uncorrelated exponentially fast. It is\nimportant to specify the properties of the C-system which quantify the\nexponential decay of correlations. We have found that the upper bound on the\nexponential decay of the correlation functions universally depends on the value\nof a system entropy. A quintessence of the analyses is that local and\nhomogeneous instability of the C-system phase space trajectories translated\ninto the exponential decay of the correlation functions at the rate which is\nproportional to the Kolmogorov entropy, one of the fundamental characteristics\nof the Anosov automorphisms. This result allows to define the decorrrelation\nand relaxation times of a C-system in terms of its entropy and characterise the\nstatistical properties of a broad class of dynamical systems, including\npseudorandom number generators and gravitational systems.\n", "  Potassium (K) intercalated manganese phthalocyanine (MnPc) reveals vast\nchanges of its electronic states close to the Fermi level. However, theoretical\nstudies are controversial regarding the electronic configuration. Here, MnPc\ndoped with K was studied by ultraviolet, X-ray, and inverse photoemission, as\nwell as near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. Upon K\nintercalation the Fermi level shifts toward the lowest unoccupied molecular\norbital filling it up with donated electrons with the appearance of an\nadditional feature in the energy region of the occupied states. The electronic\nbands are pinned 0.5 eV above and 0.4 eV below the Fermi level. The branching\nratio of the Mn L3 and L2 edges indicate an increase of the spin state.\nMoreover, the evolution of the Mn L and N K edges reveals strong hybridization\nbetween Mn 3d and N 2p states of MnPc and sheds light on the electron\noccupation in the ground and n-doped configurations.\n", "  A possible form of the Lipkin model obeying the su(6)-algebra is presented.\nIt is a natural generalization from the idea for the su(4)-algebra recently\nproposed by the present authors. All the relation appearing in the present form\ncan be expressed in terms of the spherical tensors in the su(2)-algebras. For\nspecifying the linearly independent basis completely, twenty parameters are\nintroduced. It is concluded that, in these parameters, the ten denote the\nquantum numbers coming from the eigenvalues of some hermitian operators. The\nfive in these ten determine the minimum weight state.\n", "  This work presents a collapsed generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (CGARZ) model,\nwhich fits into a generic second order model (GSOM) framework. GSOMs augment\nthe evolution of the traffic density by a second state variable characterizing\na property of vehicles or drivers. A cell transmission model for the numerical\nsolution of GSOMs is derived, which is based on analyzing the sending and\nreceiving functions of the traffic density and total property. The predictive\naccuracy of the CGARZ model is then compared to the classical first-order LWR\nand four second-order models. To that end, a systematic approach to calibrate\nmodel parameters from sensor flow-density data is introduced and applied to all\nmodels studied. The comparative model validation is conducted using two types\nof field data: vehicle trajectory data, and loop detector data. It is shown\nthat the CGARZ model provides an intriguing combination of simple model\ndynamics in the free-flow regime and a representation of the spread of\nflow-density data in the congested regime, while possessing a competitive\nprediction accuracy.\n", "  We report on a compact, simple and robust high brightness entangled photon\nsource at room temperature. Based on a 30 mm long periodically poled potassium\ntitanyl phosphate (PPKTP), the source produces non-collinear, type0 phase\nmatched, degenerate photons at 810 nm with pair production rate as high 39.13\nMHz per mW at room temperature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nhighest photon pair rate generated using bulk crystals pump with\ncontinuous-wave laser. Combined with the inherently stable polarization Sagnac\ninterferometer, the source produces entangled state violating the Bells\ninequality by nearly 10 standard deviations and a Bell state fidelity of 0.96.\nThe compact footprint, simple and robust experimental design and room\ntemperature operation, make our source ideal for various quantum communication\nexperiments including long distance free space and satellite communications.\n", "  Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential tool for characterizing an\nunknown quantum state. Recently, QST has been performed for entangled qudits\nbased on orbital angular momentum, time-energy uncertainty, and frequency bins.\nHere, we propose a QST for time-bin qudits, with which the number of\nmeasurement settings scales linearly with dimension $d$. Using the proposed\nscheme, we performed QST for a four-dimensional time-bin maximally entangled\nstate with 16 measurement settings. We successfully reconstructed the density\nmatrix of the entangled qudits, with which the average fidelity of the state\nwas calculated to be 0.950.\n", "  There's presently a growing demand for cw high current proton and deuteron\nlinear accelerators based on superconducting technology to better support\nvarious fields of science. Up to now, high order modes (HOMs) studies induced\nby ion beams with current higher than 10 mA and even 100 mA accelerated by low\nbeta non-elliptical Superconducting rf (SRF) cavities are very few. Peking\nUniversity has recently designed and fabricated a beta=0.09 162.5 MHz HWR\ncavity to study the key physics problems in accelerating beam with current of\nabout 100mA. This paper focuses on the study of the HOM-induced power in this\ncavity. The incoherent beam energy loss induced by 100 mA beam through the HWR\nSRF cavity were obtained from both time domain solver and frequency domain\neigenmodes spectrum method. We also analysed the possibility of coherent\nexcitation of this cavity considering of manufacture errors.\n", "  In this work, we study the exciton-polariton condensate phase transition in a\nmicrocavity matter-light system in which electron-hole Coulomb interaction and\nmatter-light coupling effects are treated on an equal footing. In the framework\nof the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation applying the two-dimensional\nexciton-polariton model, we derive the self-consistent equations determining\nsimultaneously the excitonic and the photonic condenstate order parameters. In\nthe thermal equilibrium limit, we find a condensed state of the\nexciton-polariton systems and phase diagrams are then constructed. At a given\nlow temperature, the condensate by its nature shows a crossover from an\nexcitonic to a polaritonic and finally photonic condensed state as the\nexcitation density increases at large detuning. Without the detuning, the\nexcitonic condensed state disappears whereas the polaritonic or photonic phases\ndominate. The crossover is also found by lowering the Coulomb interaction at a\nfinite matter-light coupling. Lowering the Coulomb interaction or increasing\nthe temperature, the excitonic Mott transition occurs, at which the\nexciton-polariton condensates dissociate to free electron-hole/photon.\nDepending on temperature and excitation density, the phase transition of the\nexciton-polariton condensates is also addressed in signatures of\nphotoluminescence mapping to the photonic momentum distribution.\n", "  Search of life elsewhere in the galaxy is very fascinating area for planetary\nscientists and astrobiologists. Earth Similarity Index (ESI) is defined as\ngeometrical mean of four physical parameters (Such as radius, density, escape\nvelocity and surface temperature), which is ranging from 1 (identical to Earth)\nto 0 (dissimilar to Earth). In this work, ESI is re-defined as six parameters\nby introducing the two new physical parameters like revolution and surface\ngravity and is called as New Earth Similarity Index (NESI). The main focus of\nthis paper is to search Tardigrade water-life on exoplanets by varying the\ntemperature parameter in NESI, which is called as Tardigrade Similarity Index\n(TSI), which is ranging from 1 (Tardigrade can survive) to 0 (Tardigrade Cannot\nsurvive). Here the NESI and TSI is cataloged and analyzed for almost 3370\nconfirmed exoplanets.\n", "  Superconducting properties change in confined geometries. Here we study the\neffects of strong confinement in nanosized Pb-islands on Si(111) 7x7. Small\nhexagonal islands with diameters less than 50 nm and a uniform height of 7\natomic layers are formed by depositing Pb at low temperature and annealing at\n300 K. We measure the tunneling spectra of individual Pb-nanoislands using a\nlow-temperature scanning tunneling microscope operated at 0.6 K, and follow the\nnarrowing of the superconducting gap as a function of magnetic field. We find\nthe critical magnetic field, at which the superconducting gap vanishes, reaches\nseveral Tesla, which represents a greater than 50-fold enhancement compared to\nthe bulk value. By independently measuring the size of the superconducting gap,\nand the critical magnetic field that quenches superconductivity for a range of\nnanoislands we can correlate these two fundamental parameters and estimate the\nmaximal achievable critical field for 7 ML Pb-nanoislands to 7 T.\n", "  Extrapolating physical error rates to logical error rates requires many\nassumptions and thus can radically under- or overestimate the performance of an\nerror correction implementation. We introduce logical randomized benchmarking,\na characterization procedure that directly assesses the performance of a\nquantum error correction implementation at the logical level, and is motivated\nby a reduction to the well-studied case of physical randomized benchmarking. We\nshow that our method reliably reports logical performance and can estimate the\naverage probability of correctable and uncorrectable errors for a given code\nand physical channel.\n", "  We consider the resonant generation of an electron-positron pair by two\npolarized photons to arbitrarily low Landau levels. The resonance occurs when\nthe energy of one photon exceeds the one-photon generation threshold, and the\nenergy of the other photon is multiple to the spacing between the levels. The\ncross section of the process is determined taking into account the spins of\nparticles. The order of magnitude of the cross section is the highest when the\nmagnetic moments of the particles are oriented along the magnetic field.\n", "  These notes are based on two lectures given at the Twelfth Modave Summer\nSchool in Mathematical Physics 2016. The Fronsdal equation and action for both\nMinkowski and (A)dS backgrounds are discussed in detail.\n", "  The resonant process of electron-positron pairproduction by an electron in a\nsubcritical magnetic field has been studied when the pair is produced to exited\nLandau levels. The spin dependency of the process rate has been analyzed. In\nthe spin state with the greatest rate the virtual photon is emitted with a flip\nof electron spin. This behavior is not suppressed for radiative transitions\nfrom a relativistic initial state to low energy levels.\n", "  The process of electron-positron pair production by a photon with subsequent\nannihilation to a single photon in a strong magnetic field has been studied.\nThe general amplitude has been calculated and the process rate have been found\nin the low Landau levels approximation (resonant and nonresonant cases). The\ncomparison of resonant and nonresonant cases shows a significant excess of the\nresonant rate. The polarization of the final photon in a strong magnetic field\nhas also been found. It has been shown that polarizations of the initial and\nthe final photons are independent except for the case of normal linear\npolarization of the initial photon.\n", "  In the present work one- and two-photon pair production in a subcritical\nmagnetic field have been considered. Two-photon production has been studied in\nthe resonant case, when the cross section considerably increases compared to\nthe nonresonant case. While one-photon pair production is considered to be the\nmain mechanism of plasma generation in a pulsar magnetosphere, we suggest the\nexistence of another one, which is resonant two-photon production process.\n", "  Photoionized nebulae, comprising HII regions and planetary nebulae, are\nexcellent laboratories to investigate the nucleosynthesis and chemical\nevolution of several elements in the Galaxy and other galaxies of the Local\nGroup. Our purpose in this investigation is threefold: (i) compare the\nabundances of HII regions and planetary nebulae in each system in order to\ninvestigate the differences derived from the age and origin of these objects,\n(ii) compare the chemical evolution in different systems, such as the Milky\nWay, the Magellanic Clouds, and other galaxies of the Local Group, and (iii)\ninvestigate to what extent the nucleosynthesis contributions from the\nprogenitor stars affect the observed abundances in planetary nebulae, which\nconstrains the nucleosynthesis of intermediate mass stars. We show that all\nobjects in the samples present similar trends concerning distance-independent\ncorrelations, and some constraints can be defined on the production of He and N\nby the PN progenitor stars.\n", "  Voltage control of magnetism (VCM) is attracting increasing interest and\nexciting significant research activity driven by its profound physics and\nenormous potential for application. This review article aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of recent progress in VCM in different thin films. We\nfirst present a brief summary of the modulation of magnetism by electric fields\nand describe its discovery, development, classification, mechanism, and\npotential applications. In the second part, we focus on the classification of\nVCM from the viewpoint of materials, where both the magnetic medium and\ndielectric gating materials, and their influences on magnetic modulation\nefficiency are systematically described. In the third part, the nature of VCM\nis discussed in detail, including the conventional mechanisms of charge,\nstrain, and exchange coupling at the interfaces of heterostructures, as well as\nthe emergent models of orbital reconstruction and electrochemical effect. The\nfourth part mainly illustrates the typical performance characteristics of VCM,\nand discusses, in particular, its promising application for reducing power\nconsumption and realizing high-density memory in several device configurations.\nThe present review concludes with a discussion of the challenges and future\nprospects of VCM, which will inspire more in-depth research and advance the\npractical applications of this field.\n", "  Given a distribution of defects on a structured surface, such as those\nrepresented by 2-dimensional crystalline materials, liquid crystalline\nsurfaces, and thin sandwiched shells, what is the resulting stress field and\nthe deformed shape? Motivated by this concern, we first classify, and quantify,\nthe translational, rotational, and metrical defects allowable over a broad\nclass of structured surfaces. With an appropriate notion of strain, the defect\ndensities are then shown to appear as sources of strain incompatibility. The\nstrain incompatibility relations, with appropriate kinematical assumptions on\nthe decomposition of strain into elastic and plastic parts, and the stress\nequilibrium relations, with a suitable choice of material response, provide the\nnecessary equations for determining both the internal stress field and the\ndeformed shape. We demonstrate this by applying our theory to Kirchhoff-Love\nshells with a kinematics which allows for small in-surface strains but\nmoderately large rotations.\n", "  We provide experimental results to show that self-propulsion of Janus\nparticles made by coating platinum on the hemisphere of dielectric particles in\nhydrogen peroxide solution is similar to selfelectrophoresis. By different\nsurface treatments and measuring the motion of particles and their\n{\\zeta}-potentials, we find that the speed and direction of motion are\ndetermined by the {\\zeta}-potential in a given concentration of hydrogen\nperoxide solution. When sign of {\\zeta}-potential is changed from negative to\npositive, the direction of motion reverses from toward non-catalytic side to\ncatalytic side. We also find that the angular distribution of Janus particle is\nmore polarized with increasing of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, which\nsupport the self-electrophoresis mechanism.\n", "  We introduce a framework to navigate agents in buildings, inspired by the\nconcept of \"the cognitive map\". It allows to route agents depending on their\nspacial knowledge. With help of an event-driven mechanism, agents acquire new\ninformation about their surroundings, which expands their individual cognitive\nmap.\n", "  Bimetallic Co/Au (core/shell) nanoparticle system exhibiting transition form\nsuperparamagnetic (SPM) to superspin glass state (SSG) at low temperatures has\nbeen investigated with respect to its magnetocaloric properties. Peaks of\nmagnetic entropy change vs. temperature dependences ($\\Delta S_M(T)$) have been\nobserved at a temperature in the vicinity of SPM to SSG transition. Despite of\nsignificant thermal hysteresis of magnetization at low applied fields a master\ncurve has been constructed from the $\\Delta S_M(T)$ dependences employing\nscaling analysis. That confirms the investigated transition is of the second\norder type. Different values of critical exponents calculated from field\ndependence of relevant magnetocaloric response parameters in the proximity of\ncritical temperature have been found for low and high applied fields. Moreover,\nthe exponents exhibited significant disagreement with theoretical values\ncharacteristic of mean field theory as well as Ising models indicating distinct\nbehavior of the SSG system at critical temperature.\n", "  Here, the general design and properties of new multiple network elastomers\nwith an exceptional combination of stiffness, toughness, and elasticity are\nreported. In this paper, it is reported in more detail how the increase in\nstrain at break resulting from the toughening can be used to provide great\ninsight in the large strain properties of otherwise brittle acrylic well\ncrosslinked networks. The networks have been prepared by sequences of\npolymerization and swelling with monomers. The parameters that have been varied\nare the nature of the base monomers and the degree of crosslinking of the first\nnetwork. Here, the small strain properties, equilibrium swelling, and large\nstrain properties in uniaxial tension are characterized. It is shown here that\nthe large strain properties of the multiple networks are quantitatively\ncontrolled by the large strain properties of the stretched first network which\nacts as a percolating filler, while the small and intermediate properties are\ncontrolled by the entanglement density which can be largely superior to that of\nhomogeneous networks. Different brittle and prestretched elastomer networks are\nembedded at a low volume fraction in a soft extensible matrix. The increase in\ntoughness of the final material is directly controlled by the nonlinear elastic\nproperties of the prestretched network and its volume fraction, providing a\ngeneral design rule for tough soft materials\n", "  The next major project of particle physics will be the International Linear\nCollider: a linear accelerator in which electrons and positrons will collide\nwith energies of 500 to around 1000 billion electronvolts. The LPSC-Grenoble is\ninvolved in the R\\&D activities for the International Large Detector (ILD) and\nin particular in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal): i.e. design of the\nfastening and cooling systems, design of the mechanics of the end-caps, test of\nEM prototypes, tooling and integration of the end-caps.\n", "  Within the linearized three-dimensional theory of polymer gels, we consider a\nsequence of problems formulated on a family of cylindrical domains whose height\ntends to zero. We assume that the fluid pressure is controlled at the top and\nbottom faces of the cylinder, and we consider two different scaling regimes for\nthe diffusivity tensor. Through asymptotic-analysis techniques we obtain two\nplate models where the transverse displacement is governed by a plate equation\nwith an extra contribution from the fluid pressure. In the limit obtained\nwithin the first scaling regime the fluid pressure is affine across the\nthickness and hence it is determined by its instantaneous trace on the top and\nbottom faces. In the second model, instead, the value of the fluid pressure is\ngoverned by a three-dimensional diffusion equation.\n", "  Extrasolar planets on eccentric short-period orbits provide a laboratory in\nwhich to study radiative and tidal interactions between a planet and its host\nstar under extreme forcing conditions. Studying such systems probes how the\nplanet's atmosphere redistributes the time-varying heat flux from its host and\nhow the host star responds to transient tidal distortion. Here, we report the\ninsights into the planet-star interactions in HAT-P-2's eccentric planetary\nsystem gained from the analysis of 350 hr of 4.5 micron observations with the\nSpitzer Space Telescope. The observations show no sign of orbit-to-orbit\nvariability nor of orbital evolution of the eccentric planetary companion,\nHAT-P-2 b. The extensive coverage allows us to better differentiate\ninstrumental systematics from the transient heating of HAT-P-2 b's 4.5 micron\nphotosphere and yields the detection of stellar pulsations with an amplitude of\napproximately 40 ppm. These pulsation modes correspond to exact harmonics of\nthe planet's orbital frequency, indicative of a tidal origin. Transient tidal\neffects can excite pulsation modes in the envelope of a star, but, to date,\nsuch pulsations had only been detected in highly eccentric stellar binaries.\nCurrent stellar models are unable to reproduce HAT-P-2's pulsations, suggesting\nthat our understanding of the interactions at play in this system is\nincomplete.\n", "  We consider a system of equations for the description of nonlinear waves in a\nliquid with gas bubbles. Taking into account high order terms with respect to a\nsmall parameter, we derive a new nonlinear partial differential equation for\nthe description of density perturbations of mixture in the two-dimensional\ncase. We investigate integrability of this equation using the Painlev\\'e\napproach. We show that travelling wave reduction of the equation is integrable\nunder some conditions on parameters. Some exact solutions of the equation\nderived are constructed. We also perform numerical investigation of the\nnonlinear waves described by the derived equation.\n", "  Using density functional theory, we study proton permeation through graphene\nand hexagonal boron nitride. We consider several factors influencing the\nbarriers for permeation, including structural optimization, the role of the\nsolvent, surface curvature and proton transport through hydrogenated samples.\nFurthermore, we discuss the ground state charge transfer from the membrane to\nthe proton and the strong tendency for bond formation. If the process is\nassumed to be slow we find that none of these effects lead to a satisfactory\nanswer to the observed discrepancies between theory and experiment.\n", "  The size-effect of Kondo-scattering in nanometer-sized metallic point\ncontacts is measured with the simplified, mechanically-controlled\nbreak-junction technique for CuMn alloy of different Mn concentrations: 0.017;\n0.035; and 0.18 ($\\pm$0.017) at.\\%. The results are compared with our previous\npublication on nominally 0.1 at.\\% CuMn alloy \\cite{1,2}. The increase of width\nof the Kondo resonance and enhanced ratio of Kondo-peak intensity to\nelectron-phonon scattering intensity is observed for contacts with sizes\nsmaller than 10 $nm$. From the comparison of electron-phonon scattering\nintensity for the pressure-type contacts, which correspond to the clean orifice\nmodel, we conclude that the size effect is observed in \\emph{clean} contacts\nwith the shape of a \\emph{channel} (nanowire).\n", "  We present the Wigner-Lohe model for quantum synchronization which can be\nderived from the Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Lohe model using the Wigner formalism. For\nidentical one-body potentials, we provide a priori sufficient framework leading\nthe complete synchronization, in which $L^2$-distances between all wave\nfunctions tend to zero asymptotically.\n", "  By analytically continuing the coupling constant $g$ of a coupled quantum\ntheory, one can, at least in principle, arrive at a state whose energy is lower\nthan the ground state of the theory. The idea is to begin with the uncoupled\n$g=0$ theory in its ground state, to analytically continue around an\nexceptional point (square-root singularity) in the complex-coupling-constant\nplane, and finally to return to the point $g=0$. In the course of this analytic\ncontinuation, the uncoupled theory ends up in an unconventional state whose\nenergy is lower than the original ground state energy. However, it is unclear\nwhether one can use this analytic continuation to extract energy from the\nconventional vacuum state; this process appears to be exothermic but one must\ndo work to vary the coupling constant $g$.\n", "  The electronic structure and magnetism of a new magnetic intercalation\ncompound (Li0.8Fe0.2)OHFeSe are investigated theoretically. The electronic\nstructure calculations predict that the Fe in the (Li,Fe)OH intercalated layer\nis in +2 valence state, i.e. there is electron doping to the FeSe layer,\nresulting in the shrinking of the Fermi surface (FS) pocket around Gamma and a\nstrong suppression of dynamical spin susceptibility at M in comparison with the\nbulk FeSe compound. The ground state of the FeSe layer is a striped\nantiferromagnetic (SAFM) metal, while the (Li,Fe)OH layer displays a very weak\nlocalized magnetism, with an interlayer ferromagnetic (FM) coupling between the\nFeSe and intercalated (Li,Fe)OH layers. Moreover, the (Li,Fe)OH is more than a\nblock layer; it is responsible for enhancing the antiferromagnetic (AFM)\ncorrelation in the FeSe layer through interlayer magnetic coupling. We propose\nthat the magnetic spacer layer introduces a tuning mechanism for spin\nfluctuations associated with superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.\n", "  We propose classical interferometry with low-intensity thermal radiation for\nthe estimation of nonclassical independent Gaussian processes in material\nsamples. We generally determine the mean square error of the phase-independent\nparameters of an unknown Gaussian process, considering a noisy source of\nradiation the phase of which is not locked to the pump of the process. We\nverify the sufficiency of passive optical elements in the interferometer,\nactive optical elements do not improve the quality of the estimation. We also\nprove the robustness of the method against the noise and loss in both\ninterferometric channels and the sample. The proposed method is suitable even\nfor the case when a source of radiation sufficient for homodyne detection is\nnot available.\n", "  This article proposes a numerical scheme for computing the evolution of\nvehicular traffic on a road network over a finite time horizon. The traffic\ndynamics on each link is modeled by the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial\ndifferential equation (PDE), which is an equivalent form of the\nLighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE. The main contribution of this article is the\nconstruction of a single convex optimization program which computes the traffic\nflow at a junction over a finite time horizon and decouples the PDEs on\nconnecting links. Compared to discretization schemes which require the\ncomputation of all traffic states on a time-space grid, the proposed convex\noptimization approach computes the boundary flows at the junction using only\nthe initial condition on links and the boundary conditions of the network. The\ncomputed boundary flows at the junction specify the boundary condition for the\nHJ PDE on connecting links, which then can be separately solved using an\nexisting semi-explicit scheme for single link HJ PDE. As demonstrated in a\nnumerical example of ramp metering control, the proposed convex optimization\napproach also provides a natural framework for optimal traffic control\napplications.\n", "  This book presents a detailed study of a system of interacting Brownian\nmotions in one dimension. The interaction is point-like such that the $n$-th\nBrownian motion is reflected from the Brownian motion with label $n-1$. This\nmodel belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In fact,\nbecause of the singular interaction, many universal properties can be\nestablished with rigor. They depend on the choice of initial conditions.\nDiscussion addresses packed and periodic initial conditions, stationary initial\nconditions, and mixtures thereof. The suitably scaled spatial process will be\nproven to converge to an Airy process in the long time limit. A chapter on\ndeterminantal random fields and another one on Airy processes are added to have\nthe notes self-contained. This book serves as an introduction to the KPZ\nuniversality class, illustrating the main concepts by means of a single model\nonly. It will be of interest to readers from interacting diffusion processes\nand non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.\n"]}
