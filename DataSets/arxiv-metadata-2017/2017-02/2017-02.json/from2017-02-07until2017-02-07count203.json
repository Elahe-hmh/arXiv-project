At\nthermal energies we predict a sticking probability that is substantially less\nthan unity, with the repelled molecules exhibiting characteristic kinetic,\nvibrational and rotational signatures arising from the non-adiabatic spin\ntransition.\n", "  We address the problem of diversification in religions by studying selection\non cultural memes that colonize humans hosts. In analogy to studying the\nevolution of pathogens or symbionts colonizing animal hosts, we use models for\nhost-pathogen dynamics known from theoretical epidemiology. In these models,\nreligious memes colonize individual humans. Rates of transmission of memes\nbetween humans, i.e., transmission of cultural content, and rates of loss of\nmemes (loss of faith) are determined by the phenotype of the cultural memes,\nand by interactions between hosts carrying different memes. In particular,\nbased on the notion that religion can lead to oppression of lower classes once\na religious society has reached a certain size, we assume that the rate of loss\nincreases as the number of humans colonized by a particular meme phenotype\nincreases. This generates frequency-dependent selection on cultural memes, and\nwe use evolutionary theory to show that this frequency dependence can generate\nthe emergence of coexisting clusters of different meme types. The different\nclusters correspond to different religions, and hence our model describes the\nemergence of distinct descendent religions from single ancestral religions.\n", "  Recently, spin selection rules have been invoked to explain the discrepancy\nbetween measured and calculated adsorption probabilities of molecular oxygen\nreacting with Al(111). In this work, we inspect the impact of nonadiabatic spin\ntransitions on the dynamics of this system from first principles. For this\npurpose the motion on two distinct potential-energy surfaces associated to\ndifferent spin configurations and possible transitions between them are\ninspected by means of the Fewest Switches algorithm. Within this framework we\nespecially focus on the influence of such spin transitions on observables\naccessible to molecular beam experiments. On this basis we suggest experimental\nsetups that can validate the occurrence of such transitions and discuss their\nfeasibility.\n", "  We recast into histories-based form a quantum field theory defined earlier in\noperator language for a free scalar field on a background causal set. The\nresulting decoherence-functional resembles that of the continuum theory. The\ncounterpart of the d'Alembertian operator is nonlocal and is a generalized\ninverse of the discrete retarded Green function. We comment on the significance\nof this and we also suggest how to include interactions.\n", "  Understanding the emergence and evolution of multicellularity and cellular\ndifferentiation is a core problem in biology. We develop a quantitative model\nthat shows that a multicellular form emerges from genetically identical\nunicellular ancestors when the compartmentalization of poorly compatible\nphysiological processes into component cells of an aggregate produces a fitness\nadvantage. This division of labour between the cells in the aggregate occurs\nspontaneously at the regulatory level due to mechanisms present in unicellular\nancestors and does not require any genetic pre-disposition for a particular\nrole in the aggregate or any orchestrated cooperative behaviour of aggregate\ncells. Mathematically, aggregation implies an increase in the dimensionality of\nphenotype space that generates a fitness landscape with new fitness maxima, and\nin which the unicellular states of optimized metabolism become fitness saddle\npoints. Evolution of multicellularity is modeled as evolution of a hereditary\nparameter, the propensity of cells to stick together, which determines the\nfraction of time a cell spends in the aggregate form. Stickiness can increase\nevolutionarily due to the fitness advantage generated by the division of labour\nbetween cells in an aggregate.\n", "  Adaptive dynamics is a widely used framework for modeling long-term evolution\nof continuous phenotypes. It is based on invasion fitness functions, which\ndetermine selection gradients and the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics.\nEven though the derivation of the adaptive dynamics from a given invasion\nfitness function is general and model-independent, the derivation of the\ninvasion fitness function itself requires specification of an underlying\necological model. Therefore, evolutionary insights gained from adaptive\ndynamics models are generally model-dependent. Logistic models for symmetric,\nfrequency-dependent competition are widely used in this context. Such models\nhave the property that the selection gradients derived from them are gradients\nof scalar functions, which reflects a certain gradient property of the\ncorresponding invasion fitness function. We show that any adaptive dynamics\nmodel that is based on an invasion fitness functions with this gradient\nproperty can be transformed into a generalized symmetric competition model.\nThis provides a precise delineation of the generality of results derived from\ncompetition models. Roughly speaking, to understand the adaptive dynamics of\nthe class of models satisfying a certain gradient condition, one only needs a\ncomplete understanding of the adaptive dynamics of symmetric,\nfrequency-dependent competition. We show how this result can be applied to\nnumber of basic issues in evolutionary theory.\n", "  Entanglement of a quantum system depends upon relative phase in complicated\nways, which no single measurement can reflect. Because of this, entanglement\nwitnesses are necessarily limited in applicability and/or utility. We propose\nhere a solution to the problem using quantum neural networks. A quantum system\ncontains the information of its entanglement; thus, if we are clever, we can\nextract that information efficiently. As proof of concept, we show how this can\nbe done for the case of pure states of a two-qubit system, using an\nentanglement indicator corrected for the anomalous phase oscillation. Both the\nentanglement indicator and the phase correction are calculated by the quantum\nsystem itself acting as a neural network.\n", "  The generation of two non-identical membrane compartments via exchange of\nvesicles is considered to require two types of vesicles specified by distinct\ncytosolic coats that selectively recruit cargo and two membrane-bound SNARE\npairs that specify fusion and differ in their affinities for each type of\nvesicles. The mammalian Golgi complex is composed of 6-8 non-identical\ncisternae that undergo gradual maturation and replacement yet features only two\nSNARE pairs. We present a model that explains how the distinct composition of\nGolgi cisternae can be generated with two and even a single SNARE pair and one\nvesicle coat. A decay of active SNARE concentration in aging cisternae provides\nthe seed for a cis > trans SNARE gradient that generates the predominantly\nretrograde vesicle flux which further enhances the gradient. This flux in turn\nyields the observed inhomogeneous steady-state distribution of Golgi enzymes,\nwhich compete with each other and with the SNAREs for incorporation into\ntransport vesicles. We show analytically that the steady state SNARE\nconcentration decays exponentially with the cisterna number. Numerical\nsolutions of rate equations reproduce the experimentally observed SNARE\ngradients, overlapping enzyme peaks in cis, medial and trans and the reported\nchange in vesicle nature across Golgi: Vesicles originating from younger\ncisternae mostly contain Golgi enzymes and SNAREs enriched in these cisternae\nand extensively recycle through the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), while the other\nsubpopulation of vesicles contains Golgi proteins prevalent in older cisternae\nand hardly reaches the ER.\n", "  The possibility of complicated dynamic behaviour driven by non-linear\nfeedbacks in dynamical systems has revolutionized science in the latter part of\nthe last century. Yet despite examples of complicated frequency dynamics, the\npossibility of long-term evolutionary chaos is rarely considered. The concept\nof \"survival of the fittest\" is central to much evolutionary thinking and\nembodies a perspective of evolution as a directional optimization process\nexhibiting simple, predictable dynamics. This perspective is adequate for\nsimple scenarios, when frequency-independent selection acts on scalar\nphenotypes. However, in most organisms many phenotypic properties combine in\ncomplicated ways to determine ecological interactions, and hence\nfrequency-dependent selection. Therefore, it is natural to consider models for\nthe evolutionary dynamics generated by frequency-dependent selection acting\nsimultaneously on many different phenotypes. Here we show that complicated,\nchaotic dynamics of long-term evolutionary trajectories in phenotype space is\nvery common in a large class of such models when the dimension of phenotype\nspace is large, and when there are epistatic interactions between the\nphenotypic components. Our results suggest that the perspective of evolution as\na process with simple, predictable dynamics covers only a small fragment of\nlong-term evolution. Our analysis may also be the first systematic study of the\noccurrence of chaos in multidimensional and generally dissipative systems as a\nfunction of the dimensionality of phase space.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the unitary inequivalentness in quantum physics.\nThen based on some of the current outstanding problems in theoretical physics,\nwe will show the important role of this concept to better understand the\nphysical theories.\n", "  We present a solution of the quantum mechanics problem of the allowable\nenergy levels of a bound particle in a one-dimensional finite square well. The\nmethod is a geometric-analytic technique utilizing the conformal mapping $w \\to\nz = w e^w$ between two complex domains. The solution of the finite square well\nproblem can be seen to be described by the images of simple geometric shapes,\nlines and circles, under this map and its inverse image. The technique can also\nbe described using the Lambert W function. One can work in either of the\ncomplex domains, thereby obtaining additional insight into the finite square\nwell problem and its bound energy states. There are many opportunities to\nfollow up, and we present the method in a pedagogical manner to stimulate\nfurther research in this and related avenues.\n", "  We study a class of meromorphic connections $\\nabla(Z)$ on $\\mathbb{P}^1$,\nparametrised by the central charge $Z$ of a stability condition, with values in\na Lie algebra of formal vector fields on a torus. Their definition is motivated\nby the work of Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke on wall-crossing and\nthree-dimensional field theories. Our main results concern two limits of the\nfamilies $\\nabla(Z)$ as we rescale the central charge $Z \\mapsto RZ$. In the $R\n\\to 0$ \"conformal limit\" we recover a version of the connections introduced by\nBridgeland and Toledano Laredo (and so the Joyce holomorphic generating\nfunctions for enumerative invariants), although with a different construction\nyielding new explicit formulae. In the $R \\to \\infty$ \"large complex structure\"\nlimit the connections $\\nabla(Z)$ make contact with the\nGross-Pandharipande-Siebert approach to wall-crossing based on tropical\ngeometry. Their flat sections display tropical behaviour, and also encode\ncertain tropical/relative Gromov-Witten invariants.\n", "  KA1858+4850 is a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy at redshift 0.078 and is among\nthe brightest active galaxies monitored by the Kepler mission. We have carried\nout a reverberation mapping campaign designed to measure the broad-line region\nsize and estimate the mass of the black hole in this galaxy. We obtained 74\nepochs of spectroscopic data using the Kast Spectrograph at the Lick 3-m\ntelescope from February to November of 2012, and obtained complementary V-band\nimages from five other ground-based telescopes. We measured the H-beta light\ncurve lag with respect to the V-band continuum light curve using both\ncross-correlation techniques (CCF) and continuum light curve variability\nmodeling with the JAVELIN method, and found rest-frame lags of lag_CCF = 13.53\n(+2.03, -2.32) days and lag_JAVELIN = 13.15 (+1.08, -1.00) days. The H-beta\nroot-mean-square line profile has a width of sigma_line = 770 +/- 49 km/s.\nCombining these two results and assuming a virial scale factor of f = 5.13, we\nobtained a virial estimate of M_BH = 8.06 (+1.59, -1.72) x 10^6 M_sun for the\nmass of the central black hole and an Eddington ratio of L/L_Edd ~ 0.2. We also\nobtained consistent but slightly shorter emission-line lags with respect to the\nKepler light curve. Thanks to the Kepler mission, the light curve of\nKA1858+4850 has among the highest cadences and signal-to-noise ratios ever\nmeasured for an active galactic nucleus; thus, our black hole mass measurement\nwill serve as a reference point for relations between black hole mass and\ncontinuum variability characteristics in active galactic nuclei.\n", "  Darboux's theorem guarantees the existence of local canonical coordinates on\nsymplectic manifolds under certain conditions. We demonstrate a general method\nto construct such Darboux coordinates in the vicinity of a fixed point of a\nnoncanonical Hamiltonian system via normal form expansions. The procedure\nserves as a tool to naturally extract canonical coordinates and at the same\ntime to transform the Hamiltonian into its Poincare-Birkhoff normal form. The\nmethod is general in the sense that it is applicable for arbitrary degrees of\nfreedom, in arbitrary orders of the local expansion, and it is independent of\nthe precise form of the Hamiltonian. The method presented allows for the\ngeneral and systematic investigation of noncanonical Hamiltonian systems in the\nvicinity of fixed points, which e.g. correspond to ground, excited or\ntransition states. As an exemplary field of application, we discuss a\nvariational approach to quantum systems which defines a noncanonical\nHamiltonian system for the variational parameters and which directly allows to\napply transition state theory to quantum mechanical wave packets.\n", "  For general dissipative dynamical systems we study what fraction of solutions\nexhibit chaotic behavior depending on the dimensionality $d$ of the phase\nspace. We find that a system of $d$ globally coupled ODE's with quadratic and\ncubic non-linearities with random coefficients and initial conditions, the\nprobability of a trajectory to be chaotic increases universally from $\\sim\n10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ for $d=3$ to essentially one for $d\\sim 50$. In the limit of\nlarge $d$, the invariant measure of the dynamical systems exhibits universal\nscaling that depends on the degree of non-linearity but does not depend on the\nchoice of coefficients, and the largest Lyapunov exponent converges to a\nuniversal scaling limit. Using statistical arguments, we provide analytical\nexplanations for the observed scaling and for the probability of chaos.\n", "  We report a search for $B$ decays to selected final states with the $\\eta_c$\nmeson: $B^{\\pm}\\to K^{\\pm}\\eta_c\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $B^{\\pm}\\to K^{\\pm}\\eta_c\\omega$,\n$B^{\\pm}\\to K^{\\pm}\\eta_c\\eta$ and $B^{\\pm}\\to K^{\\pm}\\eta_c\\pi^0$. The\nanalysis is based on $772\\times 10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+e^-$ collider. We set 90\\% confidence level upper limits on the branching\nfractions of the studied $B$ decay modes, independent of intermediate\nresonances, in the range $(0.6-5.3)\\times 10^{-4}$. We also search for\nmolecular-state candidates in the $D^0\\bar{D}^{*0}-\\bar{D}^0D^{*0}$,\n$D^0\\bar{D}^0+\\bar{D}^0D^0$ and $D^{*0}\\bar{D}^{*0}+\\bar{D}^{*0}D^{*0}$\ncombinations, neutral partners of the $Z(3900)^{\\pm}$ and $Z(4020)^{\\pm}$, and\na poorly understood state $X(3915)$ as possible intermediate states in the\ndecay chain, and set 90\\% confidence level upper limits on the product of\nbranching fractions to the mentioned intermediate states and decay branching\nfractions of these states in the range $(0.6-6.9)\\times 10^{-5}$.\n", "  While it is empirically accepted that the fixed-node diffusion Monte-Carlo\n(FN-DMC) depends only weakly on the size of the one-particle basis sets used to\nexpand its guiding functions, limits of this observation are not settled yet.\nOur recent work indicates that under the FN error cancellation conditions,\naugmented triple zeta basis sets are sufficient to achieve a benchmark level of\n0.1 kcal/mol in a number of small noncovalent complexes. Here we report on a\npossibility of truncation of the one-particle basis sets used in FN-DMC guiding\nfunctions that has no visible effect on the accuracy of the production FN-DMC\nenergy differences. The proposed scheme leads to no significant increase in the\nlocal energy variance, indicating that the total CPU cost of large-scale\nbenchmark noncovalent interaction energy FN-DMC calculations may be reduced.\n", "  In this paper we will first look at a particular quantum eraser setup to show\nthat this type of experiments can be understood in an intuitive manner if we\nare willing to take a complex nonlinear approach, without the need to invoke\nNiels Bohr's complementarity or quantum entanglement between two particles. We\nwill then discuss a recent experiment of the same type that does not erase the\ninterference pattern when which-path information is available, and argue that\nthis result is in clear contradiction with the orthodox interpretation of\nquantum mechanics but perfectly understandable in the framework of nonlinear\nquantum physics.\n", "  We developed an efficient numerical algorithm for computing the spectrum of\nanomalous dimensions of the planar ${\\cal N}=4$ Super-Yang--Mills at finite\ncoupling. The method is based on the Quantum Spectral Curve formalism. In\ncontrast to Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, worked out only for some very special\noperators, this method is applicable for generic states/operators and is much\nfaster and precise due to its Q-quadratic convergence rate.\n  To demonstrate the method we evaluate the dimensions $\\Delta$ of twist\noperators in $sl(2)$ sector directly for any value of the spin $S$ including\nnon-integer values. In particular, we compute the BFKL pomeron intercept in a\nwide range of the 't Hooft coupling constant with up to $20$ significant\nfigures precision, confirming two previously known from the perturbation theory\norders and giving prediction for several new coefficients. Furthermore, we\nexplore numerically a rich branch cut structure for complexified spin $S$.\n", "  A cosmological model with a new variant of Chaplygin gas obeying an equation\nof state(EoS), $P = A\\rho - \\frac{B}{\\rho^{\\alpha}}$ where $B= B_{0}a^{n}$ is\ninvestigated in the context of its thermodynamical behaviour. Here $B_{0}$ and\n$n$ are constants and $a$ is the scale factor. We show that the equation of\nstate of this `Variable Modified Chaplygin gas' (VMCG) can describe the current\naccelerated expansion of the universe. Following standard thermodynamical\ncriteria we mainly discuss the classical thermodynamical stability of the model\nand find that the new parameter, $n$ introduced in VMCG plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the stability considerations and should always be \\emph{negative.}\nWe further observe that although the earlier model of Lu explains many of the\ncurrent observational findings of different probes it fails the desirable tests\nof thermodynamical stability. We also note that for $n < 0$ our model points to\na phantom type of expansion which, however, is found to be compatible with\ncurrent SNe Ia observations and CMB anisotropy measurements. Further the third\nlaw of thermodynamics is obeyed in our case. Our model is very general in the\nsense that many of earlier works in this field may be obtained as a special\ncase of our solution. An interesting point to note is that the model also\napparently suggests a smooth transition from the big bang to the big rip in its\nwhole evaluation process.\n", "  We construct a cofibrantly generated model structure on the category of\ndifferential non-negatively graded quasi-coherent commutative $D_X$-algebras,\nwhere $D_X$ is the sheaf of differential operators of a smooth afine algebraic\nvariety X. The paper contains an extensive appendix on D-modules, sheaves\nversus global sections, some more technical model categorical issues, as well\nas on relative Sullivan algebras. This article is the first of a series of\nworks -located at the interface of homotopical algebra, algebraic geometry, and\nmathematical physics - on a derived D-geometric approach to the BV-formalism.\n", "  In this work we analyze a system consisting in two-dimensional\nposition-dependent massive particles in the presence of a Morse-like potential\nin two spatial dimensions. We obtain the exact wavefunctions and energies for a\ncomplete set of eigenstates for a given dependence of the mass with the spatial\nvariables.\n", "  Derived D-Geometry is considered as a convenient language for a\ncoordinate-free investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations up to\nsymmetries. One of the first issues one meets in the functor of points approach\nto derived D-Geometry, is the question of a model structure on the category C\nof differential non-negatively graded quasi-coherent commutative algebras over\nthe sheaf D of differential operators of an appropriate underlying variety. In\n[BPP15a], we described a cofibrantly generated model structure on C via the\ndefinition of its weak equivalences and its fibrations. In the present article\n- the second of a series of works on the BV-formalism - we characterize the\nclass of cofibrations, give explicit functorial cofibration-fibration\nfactorizations, as well as explicit functorial fibrant and cofibrant\nreplacement functors. We then use the latter to build a model categorical\nKoszul-Tate resolution for D-algebraic on-shell function algebras.\n", "  Most theories of evolutionary diversification are based on equilibrium\nassumptions: they are either based on optimality arguments involving static\nfitness landscapes, or they assume that populations first evolve to an\nequilibrium state before diversification occurs, as exemplified by the concept\nof evolutionary branching points in adaptive dynamics theory. Recent results\nindicate that adaptive dynamics may often not converge to equilibrium points\nand instead generate complicated trajectories if evolution takes place in\nhigh-dimensional phenotype spaces. Even though some analytical results on\ndiversification in complex phenotype spaces are available, to study this\nproblem in general we need to reconstruct individual-based models from the\nadaptive dynamics generating the non-equilibrium dynamics. Here we first\nprovide a method to construct individual-based models such that they faithfully\nreproduce the given adaptive dynamics attractor without diversification. We\nthen show that a propensity to diversify can by introduced by adding Gaussian\ncompetition terms that generate frequency dependence while still preserving the\nsame adaptive dynamics. For sufficiently strong competition, the disruptive\nselection generated by frequency-dependence overcomes the directional evolution\nalong the selection gradient and leads to diversification in phenotypic\ndirections that are orthogonal to the selection gradient.\n", "  We shall prove that the celebrated R\\'enyi entropy is the first example of a\nnew family of infinitely many multi-parametric entropies. We shall call them\nthe $Z$-entropies. Each of them, under suitable hypotheses, generalizes the\ncelebrated entropies of Boltzmann and R\\'enyi.\n  A crucial aspect is that every $Z$-entropy is composable [1]. This property\nmeans that the entropy of a system which is composed of two or more independent\nsystems depends, in all the associated probability space, on the choice of the\ntwo systems only. Further properties are also required, to describe the\ncomposition process in terms of a group law.\n  The composability axiom, introduced as a generalization of the fourth\nShannon-Khinchin axiom (postulating additivity), is a highly non-trivial\nrequirement. Indeed, in the trace-form class, the Boltzmann entropy and Tsallis\nentropy are the only known composable cases. However, in the non-trace form\nclass, the $Z$-entropies arise as new entropic functions possessing the\nmathematical properties necessary for information-theoretical applications, in\nboth classical and quantum contexts.\n  From a mathematical point of view, composability is intimately related to\nformal group theory of algebraic topology. The underlying group-theoretical\nstructure determines crucially the statistical properties of the corresponding\nentropies.\n", "  Real-world networks in technology, engineering and biology often exhibit\ndynamics that cannot be adequately reproduced using network models given by\nsmooth dynamical systems and a fixed network topology. Asynchronous networks\ngive a theoretical and conceptual framework for the study of network dynamics\nwhere nodes can evolve independently of one another, be constrained, stop, and\nlater restart, and where the interaction between different components of the\nnetwork may depend on time, state, and stochastic effects. This framework is\nsufficiently general to encompass a wide range of applications ranging from\nengineering to neuroscience. Typically, dynamics is piecewise smooth and there\nare relationships with Filippov systems. In the first part of the paper, we\ngive examples of asynchronous networks, and describe the basic formalism and\nstructure. In the second part, we make the notion of a functional asynchronous\nnetwork rigorous, discuss the phenomenon of dynamical locks, and present a\nfoundational result on the spatiotemporal factorization of the dynamics for a\nlarge class of functional asynchronous networks.\n", "  We identify the ballistically and diffusively rescaled limit distribution of\nthe second class particle position in a wide range of asymmetric and symmetric\ninteracting particle systems with established hydrodynamic behavior,\nrespectively (including zero-range, misanthrope and many other models). The\ninitial condition is a step profile which, in some classical cases of\nasymmetric models, gives rise to a rarefaction fan scenario. We also point out\na model with non-concave, non-convex hydrodynamics, where the rescaled second\nclass particle distribution has both continuous and discrete counterparts. The\nresults follow from a substantial generalization of P.A. Ferrari and C. Kipnis'\narguments (\"Second class particles in the rarefaction fan\", Ann. Inst. H.\nPoincar\\'e, 31, 1995) for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process. The\nmain novelty is the introduction of a signed coupling measure as initial data,\nwhich nevertheless results in a proper probability initial distribution for the\nsite of the second class particle and makes the extension possible. We also\nreveal in full generality a very interesting invariance property of the\none-site marginal distribution of the process underneath the second class\nparticle which in particular proves the intrinsicality of our choice for the\ninitial distribution. Finally, we give a lower estimate on the probability of\nsurvival of a second class particle-antiparticle pair.\n", "  In previous work, we have proposed an entanglement indicator for a general\nmultiqubit state, which can be \"learned\" by a quantum system, acting as a\nneural network. The indicator can be used for a pure or a mixed state, and it\nneed not be \"close\" to any particular state; moreover, as the size of the\nsystem grows, the amount of additional training necessary diminishes. Here, we\nshow that the indicator is stable to noise and decoherence.\n", "  We show that complex Langevin simulation converges to a wrong result, by\nrelating it to the Lefschetz-thimble path integral, when the path-integral\nweight has different phases among dominant complex saddle points. Equilibrium\nsolution of the complex Langevin equation forms local distributions around\ncomplex saddle points. Its ensemble average approximately becomes a direct sum\nof the average in each local distribution, where relative phases among them are\ndropped. We propose that by taking these phases into account through\nreweighting, we can solve the wrong convergence problem. However, this\nprescription may lead to a recurrence of the sign problem in the complex\nLangevin method for quantum many-body systems.\n", "  This paper maps the large-scale variation of the Spanish language by\nemploying a corpus based on geographically tagged Twitter messages. Lexical\ndialects are extracted from an analysis of variants of tens of concepts. The\nresulting maps show linguistic variation on an unprecedented scale across the\nglobe. We discuss the properties of the main dialects within a machine learning\napproach and find that varieties spoken in urban areas have an international\ncharacter in contrast to country areas where dialects show a more regional\nuniformity.\n", "  The so-called $\\chi^{2}$-superstatistics of Beck and Cohen (BC) is employed\nto investigate the infinite-range Blume-Capel model, a well-known\nrepresentative system displaying inequivalence of canonical and microcanonical\nphase diagrams. While not being restricted to any of those particular\nthermodynamic limits, our analytical result can smoothly recover both canonical\nand microcanonical ensemble solutions as its nonextensive parameter $q$ is\nproperly tuned. Additionally, we compare our findings to ones previously\nobtained from a generalized canonical framework named Extended Gaussian\nensemble (EGE). Finally, we show that both EGE and BC solutions are equivalent\nat the thermodynamic level.\n", "  We report the first electronic structure calculation performed on a quantum\ncomputer without exponentially costly precompilation. We use a programmable\narray of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of molecular\nhydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we experimentally\nexecute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum\neigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissociation\nenergy to within chemical accuracy of the numerically exact result. Second, we\nexperimentally demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chemistry, which\nconsists of Trotterization and quantum phase estimation. We compare the\nexperimental performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the\nvariational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors. This error\ntolerance inspires hope that variational quantum simulations of classically\nintractable molecules may be viable in the near future.\n", "  We consider a concise dark matter scenario in the minimal gauged $B-L$\nextension of the Standard Model (SM), where the global $B-L$ (baryon number\nminus lepton number) symmetry in the SM is gauged, and three generations of\nright-handed neutrinos and a $B-L$ Higgs field are introduced. Associated with\nthe $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking by a VEV of the $B-L$ Higgs field, the seesaw\nmechanism for generating the neutrino mass is automatically implemented after\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM. In this model context, we\nintroduce a $Z_2$-parity and assign an odd parity for one right-handed neutrino\nwhile even parities for the other fields. Therefore, the dark matter candidate\nis identified as the right-handed Majorana neutrino with odd $Z_2$ parity,\nkeeping the minimality of the particle content intact. When the dark matter\nparticle communicates with the SM particles mainly through the $B-L$ gauge\nboson ($Z^\\prime_{BL}$ boson), its relic abundance is determined by only three\nfree parameters, the $B-L$ gauge coupling ($\\alpha_{BL}$), the $Z^\\prime_{BL}$\nboson mass ($m_{Z^\\prime}$) and the dark matter mass ($m_{DM}$). With the\ncosmological upper bound on the dark matter relic abundance we find a lower\nbound on $\\alpha_{BL}$ as a function of $m_{Z^\\prime}$. On the other hand, we\ninterpret the recent LHC Run-2 results on search for $Z^\\prime$ boson resonance\nto an upper bound on $\\alpha_{BL}$ as a function of $m_{Z^\\prime}$. Combining\nthe two results we identify an allowed parameter region for this\n\"$Z^\\prime_{BL}$ portal\" dark matter scenario, which turns out to be a narrow\nwindow with the lower mass bound of $m_{Z^\\prime} > 2.5$ TeV.\n", "  A periodically driven rotor is a prototypical model that exhibits a\ntransition to chaos in the classical regime and dynamical localization (related\nto Anderson localization) in the quantum regime. In a recent work [Phys. Rev. B\n94, 085120 (2016)], A. C. Keser et al. considered a many-body generalization of\ncoupled quantum kicked rotors, and showed that in the special integrable linear\ncase, dynamical localization survives interactions. By analogy with many-body\nlocalization, the phenomenon was dubbed dynamical many-body localization. In\nthe present work, we study nonintegrable models of single and coupled quantum\nrelativistic kicked rotors (QRKRs) that bridge the gap between the conventional\nquadratic rotors and the integrable linear models. For a single QRKR, we\nsupplement the recent analysis of the angular-momentum-space dynamics with a\nstudy of the spin dynamics. Our analysis of two and three coupled QRKRs along\nwith the proved localization in the many-body linear model indicate that\ndynamical localization exists in few-body systems. Moreover, the relation\nbetween QRKR and linear rotor models implies that dynamical many-body\nlocalization can exist in generic, nonintegrable many-body systems. And\nlocalization can generally result from a complicated interplay between Anderson\nmechanism and limiting integrability, since the many-body linear model is a\nhigh-angular-momentum limit of many-body QRKRs. We also analyze the dynamics of\ntwo coupled QRKRs in the highly unusual superballistic regime and find that the\nresonance conditions are relaxed due to interactions. Finally, we propose\nexperimental realizations of the QRKR model in cold atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  The scattering of weak dispersive waves (DW) on several equally spaced\ntemporal solitons is studied. It is shown by systematic numerical simulations\nthat the reflection of the DWs from the soliton trains strongly depends on the\ndistance between the solitons. The dependence of the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients on the inter-soliton distance and the frequency of\nthe incident waves is studied in detail, revealing fascinating quasi-periodic\nbehavior. The analogy between the observed nonlinear phenomena in temporal\ndomain and usual Fabry-Perot and Bragg resonators is discussed.\n", "  A surprising phenomenon is presented: a bubble, produced from water\nelectrolysis, is immobilized in the liquid (as if the Archimedes' buoyant force\nwere annihilated). This is achieved using a nanoelectrode (1 nm to 1 $\\mu$m of\ncurvature radius at the apex) and an alternating electric potential with\nadapted values of amplitude and frequency. A simple model based on\n\"nanoelectrolysis\" (i.e., nanolocalization of the production of H2 and O2\nmolecules at the apex of the nanoelectrode) and an \"open bubble\" (i.e.,\nexchanging H2 and O2 molecules with the solution) explains most of the\nobservations.\n", "  The deformation quantization by Kontsevich [arXiv:q-alg/9709040] is a way to\nconstruct an associative noncommutative star-product $\\star=\\times+\\hbar \\{\\ ,\\\n\\}_{P}+\\bar{o}(\\hbar)$ in the algebra of formal power series in $\\hbar$ on a\ngiven finite-dimensional affine Poisson manifold: here $\\times$ is the usual\nmultiplication, $\\{\\ ,\\ \\}_{P}\\neq0$ is the Poisson bracket, and $\\hbar$ is the\ndeformation parameter. The product $\\star$ is assembled at all powers\n$\\hbar^{k\\geq0}$ via summation over a certain set of weighted graphs with $k+2$\nvertices; for each $k>0$, every such graph connects the two co-multiples of\n$\\star$ using $k$ copies of $\\{\\ ,\\ \\}_{P}$. Cattaneo and Felder [\narXiv:math/9902090 [math.QA] ] interpreted these topological portraits as the\ngenuine Feynman diagrams in the Ikeda-Izawa model [arXiv:hep-th/9312059] for\nquantum gravity.\n  By expanding the star-product up to $\\bar{o}(\\hbar^3)$, i.e., with respect to\ngraphs with at most five vertices but possibly containing loops, we illustrate\nthe mechanism Assoc = Operator(Poisson) that converts the Jacobi identity for\nthe bracket $\\{\\ ,\\ \\}_{P}$ into the associativity of $\\star$.\n  Key words: Deformation quantization, associative algebra, Poisson bracket,\ngraph complex, star-product\n  PACS: 02.40.Sf, 02.10.Ox, 02.40.Gh, also 04.60.-m\n", "  We perform the spectral analysis of a family of Jacobi operators $J(\\alpha)$\ndepending on a complex parameter $\\alpha$. If $|\\alpha|\\neq1$ the spectrum of\n$J(\\alpha)$ is discrete and formulas for eigenvalues and eigenvectors are\nestablished in terms of elliptic integrals and Jacobian elliptic functions. If\n$|\\alpha|=1$, $\\alpha \\neq \\pm 1$, the essential spectrum of $J(\\alpha)$ covers\nthe entire complex plane. In addition, a formula for the Weyl $m$-function as\nwell as the asymptotic expansions of solutions of the difference equation\ncorresponding to $J(\\alpha)$ are obtained. Finally, the completeness of\neigenvectors and Rodriguez-like formulas for orthogonal polynomials, studied\npreviously by Carlitz, are proved.\n", "  The vacuum state of a relativistic quantum field contains entanglement\nbetween regions separated by spacelike intervals. Such spatial entanglement can\nbe revealed using an operational method introduced in Ann. Phys. 351, 112\n(2014), Phys. Rev. D 91, 016005 (2014). In this approach, a cavity is\ninstantaneously divided into halves by an introduction of an extra perfect\nmirror. Causal separation of the two regions of the cavity reveals nonlocal\nspatial correlations present in the field, which can be quantified by measuring\nparticles generated in the process. We use this method to study spatial\nentanglement properties of nonvacuum Gaussian field states. In particular we\nshow how to enhance the amount of harvested spatial entanglement by an\nappropriate choice of the initial state of the field in the cavity. We find a\ncounterintuitive influence of the initial entanglement between cavity modes on\nthe spatial entanglement which is revealed by dividing the cavity in half.\n", "  A new Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for simulating the dynamics of\nmolecular systems characterized by hard-core interactions is introduced. In\ncontrast to traditional Kinetic Monte Carlo approaches, where the state of the\nsystem is associated with minima in the energy landscape, in the proposed\nmethod, the state of the system is associated with the set of paths traveled by\nthe atoms and the transition probabilities for an atom to be displaced are\nproportional to the corresponding velocities. In this way, the number of\npossible state-to-state transitions is reduced to a discrete set, and a direct\nlink between the Monte Carlo time step and true physical time is naturally\nestablished. The resulting rejection-free algorithm is validated against\nevent-driven molecular dynamics: the equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics\nof hard disks converge to the exact results with decreasing displacement size.\n", "  We have developed a quantum noise approach to study the phonon transport\nthrough nanostructures. The nanostructures acting as phonon channels are\nattached to two phonon reservoirs. And the temperature drop between the two\nreservoirs drives the phonon transport through the channels. We have derived a\nquantum Langevin equation(QLE) to describe the phonon transport with the\nquantum noise originated from the thermal fluctuation of the reservoirs. Within\nthe Markov approximation, the QLE is used to get the thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa$ of the nanostructures and the finite size effect of the $\\kappa$ then\nis studied. In this study, the advantage of the quantum noise approach lays on\nthe fact that no any local temperature needs to be defined for the\nnanostructures in its non-equilibrium state.\n", "  In a quantum electrodynamics theory that is realized by critical scaling and\nanomalous dimensions, the action is not chiral invariant and there are no\ndynamical Goldstone or Higgs boson bound states. In the mean-field\napproximation to a chiral invariant four-fermion theory the associated\nmean-field sector action is not chiral invariant either and it also possesses\nno dynamical bound states, with Goldstone and Higgs bosons instead being\ngenerated by an accompanying four-fermion residual interaction. In this paper\nwe show that if a critical scaling electrodynamics in which the dimension\n$d_{\\theta}$ of $\\bar{\\psi}\\psi$ is reduced from three to two is augmented with\na four-fermion interaction, precisely because it possesses no dynamical bound\nstates the electrodynamic sector can be reinterpreted as a mean-field\napproximation to a larger theory that is chiral symmetric. And with\n$d_{\\theta}=2$ we show in this larger theory there is a residual interaction\nthat then does generate dynamical Goldstone and Higgs bosons in scattering\namplitudes that are completely finite. While the dynamically generated\nGoldstone boson is massless, the dynamically induced Higgs boson is found to be\na narrow resonance just above threshold, with its width being a diagnostic that\ncould potentially enable one to distinguish between a dynamical Higgs boson and\nan elementary one.\n", "  We propose the on-shell superfield description for tree amplitudes of D=11\nsupergravity and the BCFW (Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten)-type recurrent relations\nfor these superamplitudes.\n", "  Indirect reciprocity is a major mechanism in the maintenance of cooperation\namong unrelated individuals. Indirect reciprocity leads to conditional\ncooperation according to social norms that discriminate the good (those who\ndeserve to be rewarded with help) and the bad (those who should be punished by\nrefusal of help). Despite intensive research, however, there is no definitive\nconsensus on what social norms best promote cooperation through indirect\nreciprocity, and it remains unclear even how those who refuse to help the bad\nshould be assessed. Here, we propose a new simple norm called \"Staying\" that\nprescribes abstaining from assessment. Under the Staying norm, the image of the\nperson who makes the decision to give help stays the same as in the last\nassessment if the person on the receiving end has a bad image. In this case,\nthe choice about whether or not to give help to the potential receiver does not\naffect the image of the potential giver. We analyze the Staying norm in terms\nof evolutionary game theory and demonstrate that Staying is most effective in\nestablishing cooperation compared to the prevailing social norms, which rely on\nconstant monitoring and unconditional assessment. The application of Staying\nsuggests that the strict application of moral judgment is limited.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the coefficient of performance (COP) of a\nmesoscopic thermoelectric refrigerator realized by using a tunnel junction. We\nanalyze the influence of particle and heat current fluctuations on the COP out\nof the equilibrium regime. We calculate the average COP by using full counting\nstatistics and find that it depends on the measurement time $\\tau$. The\ndeviation from the macroscopic COP value can be expressed with the Skellam\ndistribution at all times. This result enables us to improve the Gaussian\napproximation valid within the linear response regime, which cannot predict the\naverage COP in the limit of $\\tau \\to 0$. We illustrate the time dependence of\nthe average COP and find that in the short-time regime, the average COP\npossesses a minimum. In order to confirm the physical consistency far from\nequilibrium, we propose checking the correlation coefficient between the\nparticle and the heat currents in addition to the positivity of the entropy\nproduction rate.\n", "  Spirals and helices are common motifs of long-range order in magnetic solids,\nand they may also be organized into more complex emergent structures such as\nmagnetic skyrmions and vortices. A new type of spiral state, the spiral\nspin-liquid, in which spins fluctuate collectively as spirals, has recently\nbeen predicted to exist. Here, using neutron scattering techniques, we\nexperimentally prove the existence of a spiral spin-liquid in MnSc$_2$S$_4$ by\ndirectly observing the 'spiral surface' - a continuous surface of spiral\npropagation vectors in reciprocal space. We elucidate the multi-step ordering\nbehavior of the spiral spin-liquid, and discover a vortex-like triple-q phase\non application of a magnetic field. Our results prove the effectiveness of the\n$J_1$-$J_2$ Hamiltonian on the diamond lattice as a model for the spiral\nspin-liquid state in MnSc$_2$S$_4$, and also demonstrate a new way to realize a\nmagnetic vortex lattice.\n", "  We show how to find families of infima and suprema for the entanglement\nnegativity using only a few, low-order moments of the partially transposed\ndensity matrix $\\rho^{T_2}.$ These moments can be measured using the multi-copy\nquantum circuits previously given by the author, which define a set of\nmulti-copy expectation values and thus can be used with the replica trick. As\nsuch, these bounds are suitable for use with Quantum Monte Carlo methods, and\nthe lower order versions of the estimates may be experimentally accessible for\nsome systems. Using more moments for higher-order versions of these methods\nwill produce tighter estimates, unless and until statistical noise causes the\nmeasurement of the highest order moment to fail. Should this happen, the data\nfrom lower order moments can still be used for lower-order estimates.\n", "  The small angle approximation often fails to explain experimental data, does\nnot even predict if a plane pendulum's period increases or decreases with\nincreasing amplitude. We make a perturbation ansatz for the Conserved Energy\nSurfaces of a one-dimensional, parity-symmetric, anharmonic oscillator. A\nsimple, novel algorithm produces the equations of motion and the period of\noscillation to arbitrary precision. The Jacobian elliptic functions appear as a\nspecial case. Thrift experiment combined with recursive data analysis provides\nexperimental verification of well-known predictions. Development of the\nquantum/classical analogy enables comparison of time-independent perturbation\ntheories. Many of the useful notions herein generalize to integrable and\nnon-integrable systems in higher dimensions.\n", "  We propose a new method to create two-photon states in a controllable way\nusing interaction between the Rydberg atoms during the storage and retrieval of\nslow light. A distinctive feature of the suggested procedure is that the slow\nlight is stored into a superposition of two atomic coherences under conditions\nof electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Interaction between the\natoms during the storage period creates entangled pairs of atoms in a\nsuperposition state that is orthogonal to the initially stored state. Restoring\nthe slow light from this new atomic state one can produce a two photon state\nwith a second-order correlation function determined by the atom-atom\ninteraction and the storage time. Therefore the measurement of the restored\nlight allows one to probe the atom-atom coupling by optical means with a\nsensitivity that can be increased by extending the storage time. As a\nrealization of this idea we consider a many-body Ramsey-type technique which\ninvolves pi/2 pulses creating a superposition of Rydberg states at the\nbeginning and the end of the storage period. In that case the regenerated light\nis due to the resonance dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms in the\nRydberg states.\n", "  We propose the implementation of a switch of particle statistics with an\nembedding quantum simulator. By encoding both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics into an enlarged Hilbert space, the statistics of quantum particles\nmay be changed in situ during the time evolution, from bosons to fermions and\nfrom fermions to bosons, as many times as desired. We illustrate our proposal\nwith few-qubit examples, although the protocol is straightforwardly extendable\nto larger numbers of particles. This proposal can be implemented on different\nquantum platforms such as trapped ions, quantum photonics, and superconducting\ncircuits, among others. The possibility to implement permutation symmetrization\nand antisymmetrization of quantum particles enhances the toolbox of quantum\nsimulations, for unphysical operations as well as for symmetry transformations.\n", "  We derive the thermodynamic products particularly area (or entropy) products\nof ${\\cal H}^{\\pm}$ for certain class of black holes in AdS space. We show by\nexplicit and exact calculations that more complicated function of event horizon\narea and Cauchy horizon area is indeed mass-independent. This mass-independent\nquantities indicate that they \\emph{could turn out to be an \"universal\"\nquantity} provided that they depends only on the quantized angular momentum,\nquantized charges, and cosmological constant respectively. Furthermore, these\narea (or entropy) product relations for several class of black holes in AdS\nspace gives us strong indication to understanding the nature of non-extremal\nblack hole entropy (both inner and outer) at the microscopic level. Moreover,\nwe compute the Penrose's famous \\emph{Cosmic Censorship Inequality} (which\nrequires Cosmic-Censorship hypothesis) for these class of black holes in AdS\nspace . Local thermodynamic stability has been discussed for these black holes\nand under certain condition certain black holes displayed second order phase\ntransition.\n", "  Lasing at the nanometre scale promises strong light-matter interactions and\nultrafast operation. Plasmonic resonances supported by metallic nanoparticles\nhave extremely small mode volumes and high field enhancements, making them an\nideal platform for studying nanoscale lasing. At visible frequencies, however,\nthe applicability of plasmon resonances is limited due to strong ohmic and\nradiative losses. Intriguingly, plasmonic nanoparticle arrays support\nnon-radiative dark modes that offer longer life-times but are inaccessible to\nfar-field radiation. Here, we show lasing both in dark and bright modes of an\narray of silver nanoparticles combined with optically pumped dye molecules.\nLinewidths of 0.2 nanometers at visible wavelengths and room temperature are\nobserved. Access to the dark modes is provided by a coherent out-coupling\nmechanism based on the finite size of the array. The results open a route to\nutilize all modes of plasmonic lattices, also the high-Q ones, for studies of\nstrong light-matter interactions, condensation and photon fluids.\n", "  The Raman spectrum and particularly the Raman scattering intensities of\nmonoclinic $\\beta\\text{-Ga}_2\\text{O}_3$ are investigated by experiment and\ntheory. The low symmetry of $\\beta\\text{-Ga}_2\\text{O}_3$ results in a complex\ndependence of the Raman intensity for the individual phonon modes on the\nscattering geometry which is additionally affected by birefringence. We\nmeasured the Raman spectra in dependence on the polarization direction for\nbackscattering on three crystallographic planes of\n$\\beta\\text{-Ga}_2\\text{O}_3$ and modeled these dependencies using a modified\nRaman tensor formalism which takes birefringence into account. The spectral\nposition of all 15 Raman-active phonon modes and the Raman tensor elements of\n13 modes were determined and are compared to results from ab-initio\ncalculations.\n", "  We discuss the problem of finding the best measurement strategy for\nestimating the value of a quantum system parameter. In general the optimum\nquantum measurement, in the sense that it maximizes the quantum Fisher\ninformation and hence allows one to minimize the estimation error, can only be\ndetermined if the value of the parameter is already known. A modification of\nthe quantum Van Trees inequality, which gives a lower bound on the error in the\nestimation of a random parameter, is proposed. The suggested inequality allows\nus to assert if a particular quantum measurement, together with an appropriate\nestimator, is optimal. An adaptive strategy to estimate the value of a\nparameter, based on our modified inequality, is proposed.\n", "  We investigate how inflation model selection is affected by the presence of\nadditional free-streaming relativistic degrees of freedom, i.e. dark radiation.\nWe perform a full Bayesian analysis of both inflation parameters and\ncosmological parameters taking reheating into account self-consistently. We\ncompute the Bayesian evidence for a few representative inflation scenarios in\nboth the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model and an extension including dark radiation\nparametrised by its effective number of relativistic species $N_\\mathrm{eff}$.\nUsing a minimal dataset (Planck low-$\\ell$ polarisation, temperature power\nspectrum and lensing reconstruction), we find that the observational status of\nmost inflationary models is unchanged. The exceptions are potentials such as\npower-law inflation that predict large values for the scalar spectral index\nthat can only be realised when $N_\\mathrm{eff}$ is allowed to vary. Adding\nbaryon acoustic oscillations data and the B-mode data from BICEP2/Keck makes\npower-law inflation disfavoured, while adding local measurements of the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ makes power-law inflation slightly favoured compared to the best\nsingle-field plateau potentials. This illustrates how the dark radiation\nsolution to the $H_0$ tension would have deep consequences for inflation model\nselection.\n", "  This thesis is an exploration of the power of photonic resources, as viewed\nfrom several different but related perspectives. They range from quantum\ncomputation, precision parameter estimation to the thermodynamics of\nrelativistic quantum systems, as applied to cosmology in particular.\n  In chapter 1, we propose a new quantum computational model, called the `power\nof one qumode', that relies mainly on a single-mode photonic squeezed state. In\nparticular, we show the amount of squeezing can quantitatively relate the\nresource requirements of factoring to the problem of finding the trace of large\nunitary matrices, a result with consequences for understanding how powerful\nquantum computation really is. Furthermore, we can connect squeezing to other\nknown resources like precision, energy, qudit dimensionality and qubit number,\nwhich is a useful stepping stone to finding the resources that enable quantum\ncomputation.\n  In chapter 2, we exploit the quantum mechanical properties of photonic states\nfor use in precision parameter estimation of general linear optical processes,\nwhich is useful for a diverse number of applications, from characterising an\nunknown process in a photonic quantum computer to biological imaging. We\nintroduce a formalism that quantifies this improvement in precision. We also\nprovide conditions under which one can easily check for photonic states that\nare optimal to use in this context, which is a potentially important result for\nfuture experimental efforts.\n  In chapter 3, we explore the connection between two-mode squeezed states,\ncommonly used in quantum optics, and relativistic quantum processes, in\nparticular in cosmology. Using this connection, we apply recently developed\ntools from the thermodynamics of quantum systems perturbed far from equilibrium\nto address an old question of entropy production in cosmology from a surprising\nnew angle.\n", "  We propose a scheme to dynamically generate optical flux lattices with\nnontrivial band topology using amplitude-modulated Raman lasers and\nradio-frequency (rf) magnetic fields. By tuning the strength of Raman and rf\nfields, three distinct phases are realized at unit filling for a unit cell.\nRespectively, these three phases correspond to normal insulator, topological\nChern insulator, and semimetal. Nearly nondispersive bands are found to appear\nin the topological phase, which promises opportunities for investigating\nstrongly correlated quantum states within a simple cold-atom setup. The\nvalidity of our proposal is confirmed by comparing the Floquet quasienergies\nfrom the evolution operator with the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of decaying hydrodynamic and\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We classify our time-dependent solutions by\ntheir evolutionary tracks in parametric plots between instantaneous scaling\nexponents. We find distinct classes of solutions evolving along specific\ntrajectories toward points on a line of self-similar solutions. These\ntrajectories are determined by the underlying physics governing individual\ncases, while the infrared slope of the initial conditions plays only a limited\nrole. In the helical case, even for a scale-invariant initial spectrum\n(inversely proportional to wavenumber k), the solution evolves along the same\ntrajectory as for a Batchelor spectrum (proportional to k^4.\n", "  The field and temperature dependencies of the longitudinal and Hall\nresistivity have been measured for FeSe${}_{1-x}$S${}_{x}$ (x=0.04, 0.09 and\n0.19) single crystals. The sample FeSe${}_{0.81}$S${}_{0.19}$ does not show a\ntransition to an orthorhombic phase and exhibits at low temperatures the\ntransport properties quite different from those of orthorhombic samples. The\nbehavior of FeSe${}_{0.81}$S${}_{0.19}$ is well described by the simple two\nband model with comparable values of hole and electron mobility. In particular,\nat low temperatures the transverse resistance shows a linear field dependence,\nthe magnetoresistance follow a quadratic field dependence and obeys to Kohler's\nrule. In contrast, Kohler's rule is strongly violated for samples having an\northorhombic low temperature structure. However, the transport properties of\nthe orthorhombic samples can be satisfactory described by the three band model\nwith the pair of almost equivalent to the tetragonal sample hole and electron\nbands, supplemented with the highly mobile electron band which has two order\nsmaller carrier number. Therefore, the peculiarity of the low temperature\ntransport properties of the orthorhombic Fe(SeS) samples, as probably of many\nother orthorhombic iron superconductors, is due to the presence of a small\nnumber of highly mobile carriers which originate from the local regions of the\nFermi surface, presumably, nearby the Van Hove singularity points.\n", "  We investigate direct energy and heat transfer between two distant sites of a\ntriple quantum dot connected to reservoirs, where one of the edge dots is\ndriven by an ac-gate voltage. We theoretically propose how to implement heat\nand cooling engines mediated by long range photoassisted transport.\nAdditionally we propose a simple set up to heat up coherently the two\nreservoirs symmetrically and a mechanism to store energy in the closed system.\nThe present proposals can be experimentally implemented and easily controlled\nby tunning the external parameters.\n", "  The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is to be built at\nDaocheng, Sichuan Province, China. As one of the major components of the LHAASO\nproject, a Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA), with an area of 78,000~$\\rm\nm^{2}$, contains 350,000~tons of purified water. The water transparency and its\nstability are critical for successful long-term operation of this project. To\ngain full knowledge of the water Cherenkov technique and investigate the\nengineering issues, a 9-cell detector array has been built at the Yangbajing\nsite, Tibet, China. With the help of the distribution of single cosmic muon\nsignals, the monitoring and measurement of water transparency are studied. The\nresults show that a precision of several percent can be obtained for the\nattenuation length measurement, which satisfies the requirements of the\nexperiment. In the near future, this method could be applied to the LHAASO-WCDA\nproject.\n", "  Black phosphorus is an infrared layered material. Its bandgap complements\nother widely studied two-dimensional materials: zero-gap graphene and\nvisible/near-infrared gap transition metal dichalcogenides. Though highly\ndesirable, a comprehensive infrared characterization is still lacking. Here we\nreport a systematic infrared study of mechanically exfoliated few-layer black\nphosphorus, with thickness ranging from 2 to 15 layers and photon energy\nspanning from 0.25 to 1.36 eV. Each few-layer black phosphorus exhibits a\nthickness-dependent unique infrared spectrum with a series of absorption\nresonances, which reveals the underlying electronic structure evolution and\nserves as its IR fingerprints. Surprisingly, unexpected absorption features,\nwhich are associated with the forbidden optical transitions, have been\nobserved. Furthermore, we unambiguously demonstrate that controllable uniaxial\nstrain can be used as a convenient and effective approach to tune the\nelectronic structure of few-layer black phosphorus. Our study paves the way for\nblack phosphorus applications in infrared photonics and optoelectronics.\n", "  Through a systematic symmetry and topology analysis we establish that\nthree-dimensional chiral superconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling and\nodd-parity pairing generically host low-energy nodal quasiparticles that are\nspin-non-degenerate and realize Majorana fermions in three dimensions. By\nexamining all types of chiral Cooper pairs with total angular momentum $J$\nformed by Bloch electrons with angular momentum $j$ in crystals, we obtain a\ncomprehensive classification of gapless Majorana quasiparticles in terms of\nenergy-momentum relation and location on the Fermi surface. We show that the\nexistence of bulk Majorana fermions in the vicinity of spin-selective point\nnodes is rooted in the non-unitary nature of chiral pairing in\nspin-orbit-coupled superconductors. We address experimental signatures of\nMajorana fermions, and find that the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spin\nrelaxation rate is significantly suppressed for nuclear spins polarized along\nthe nodal direction as a consequence of the spin-selective Majorana nature of\nnodal quasiparticles. Furthermore, Majorana nodes in the bulk have nontrivial\ntopology and imply the presence of Majorana bound states on the surface that\nform arcs in momentum space. We conclude by proposing the heavy fermion\nsuperconductor PrOs$_4$Sb$_{12}$ and related materials as promising candidates\nfor non-unitary chiral superconductors hosting three-dimensional Majorana\nfermions.\n", "  We report time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements of the\nlongitudinal spin Seebeck effect driven by an interfacial temperature\ndifference between itinerant electrons and magnons. The measured time-evolution\nof spin accumulation induced by laser-excitation indicates transfer of angular\nmomentum across Au/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ and Cu/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ interfaces on\na picosecond time-scale. The product of spin-mixing conductance and interfacial\nspin Seebeck coefficient determined is of the order of $10^8$ A m$^{-2}$\nK$^{-1}$.\n", "  We discover a pair of spin-polarized surface bands on the (111) face of grey\narsenic by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the\noccupied side, the pair resembles typical nearly-free-electron Shockley states\nobserved on noble-metal surfaces. However, pump-probe ARPES reveals that the\nspin-polarized pair traverses the bulk band gap and that the crossing of the\npair at $\\bar\\Gamma$ is topologically unavoidable. First-principles\ncalculations well reproduce the bands and their non-trivial topology; the\ncalculations also support that the surface states are of Shockley type because\nthey arise from a band inversion caused by crystal field. The results provide\ncompelling evidence that topological Shockley states are realized on As(111).\n", "  The theory of quantum quenches in near-critical one-dimensional systems\nformulated in [J. Phys. A 47 (2014) 402001] yields analytic predictions for the\ndynamics, unveils a qualitative difference between non-interacting and\ninteracting systems, with undamped oscillations of one-point functions\noccurring only in the latter case, and explains the presence and role of\ndifferent time scales. Here we examine additional aspects, determining in\nparticular the relaxation value of one-point functions for small quenches. For\na class of quenches we relate this value to the scaling dimensions of the\noperators. We argue that the $E_8$ spectrum of the Ising chain can be more\naccessible through a quench than at equilibrium, while for a quench of the\nplane anisotropy in the XYZ chain we obtain that the one-point function of the\nquench operator switches from damped to undamped oscillations at $\\Delta=1/2$.\n", "  In order to look for large super-fast rotators, five dedicated surveys\ncovering ~ 188 square degree in the ecliptic plane have been carried out in\nR-band with ~10 min cadence using the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory in\nlate 2014 and early 2015. Among 1029 reliable rotation periods obtained from\nthe surveys, we discovered one new large super-fast rotator, (40511) 1999 RE88,\nand other 18 candidates. (40511) 1999 RE88 is an S-type inner main-belt\nasteroid with a diameter of D = 1.9 +- 0.3 km, which has a rotation period of P\n= 1.96 +- 0.01 hr and a lightcurve amplitude of ~0.1 mag. To maintain such fast\nrotation, an internal cohesive strength of ~780 Pa is required. Combining all\nknown large super-fast rotators, their cohesive strengths all fall in the range\nof 100 to 1000 Pa of lunar regolith. However, the number of large super-fast\nrotators seems to be far less than the whole asteroid population. This might\nindicate a peculiar asteroid group for them. Although the detection efficiency\nfor a long rotation period is greatly reduced due to our two-day observation\ntime span, the spin-rate distributions of this work show consistent results\nwith Chang et al. (2015) after considering the possible observational bias in\nour surveys. It shows a number decrease with increase of spin rate for\nasteroids with diameter of 3 < D < 15 km, and a number drop at spin-rate of f =\n5 rev/day for asteroids with D < 3 km.\n", "  A measurement of the $t\\bar{t}Z$ and $t\\bar{t}W$ production cross sections in\nfinal states with either two same-charge muons, or three or four leptons\n(electrons or muons) is presented. The analysis uses a data sample of\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015, corresponding to a total\nintegrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The inclusive cross sections are\nextracted using likelihood fits to signal and control regions, resulting in\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}Z} = 0.9 \\pm 0.3$ pb and $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}W} = 1.5 \\pm 0.8$\npb, in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.\n", "  Fixed-point quantum search algorithms succeed at finding one of $M$ target\nitems among $N$ total items even when the run time of the algorithm is longer\nthan necessary. While the famous Grover's algorithm can search quadratically\nfaster than a classical computer, it lacks the fixed-point property --- the\nfraction of target items must be known precisely to know when to terminate the\nalgorithm. Recently, Yoder, Low, and Chuang gave an optimal gate-model search\nalgorithm with the fixed-point property. Meanwhile, it is known that an\nadiabatic quantum algorithm, operating by continuously varying a Hamiltonian,\ncan reproduce the quadratic speedup of gate-model Grover search. We ask, can an\nadiabatic algorithm also reproduce the fixed-point property? We show that the\nanswer depends on what interpolation schedule is used, so as in the gate model,\nthere are both fixed-point and non-fixed-point versions of adiabatic search,\nonly some of which attain the quadratic quantum speedup. Guided by geometric\nintuition on the Bloch sphere, we rigorously justify our claims with an\nexplicit upper bound on the error in the adiabatic approximation. We also show\nthat the fixed-point adiabatic search algorithm can be simulated in the gate\nmodel with neither loss of the quadratic Grover speedup nor of the fixed-point\nproperty. Finally, we discuss natural uses of fixed-point algorithms such as\npreparation of a relatively prime state and oblivious amplitude amplification.\n", "  As part of the quest to uncover universal features of quantum dynamics, we\nstudy catastrophes that form in simple many-body wave functions after a quench,\nfocusing on two-mode systems that include the two-site Bose Hubbard model, and\nunder some circumstances optomechanical systems and the Dicke model. When the\nwave function is plotted in Fock space plus time certain characteristic\nstructures generically appear that we identify as cusp caustics. In the\nvicinity of such a catastrophe the wave function takes on a universal form\ndescribed by the Pearcey function and obeys scaling relations which depend on\nthe total number of particles $N$. In the thermodynamic limit ($N \\rightarrow\n\\infty$) the cusp becomes singular, but at finite $N$ it is decorated by an\ninterference pattern. This pattern contains an intricate network of\nvortex-antivortex pairs, initiating a theory of topological structures in Fock\nspace. In the case where the quench takes the form of a $\\delta$-kick we show\nhow to analytically map the wave function onto the Pearcey function and hence\nobtain the scaling exponents for the size and position of the cusp, as well as\nthose for the amplitude and characteristic length scales of its interference\npattern.\n", "  Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) is a major reliability concern in CMOS\ntechnology, especially with High dielectric constant (High-\\k{appa}/HK) metal\ngate (MG) transistors. In addition, the time independent process induced\nvariation has also increased because of the aggressive scaling down of devices.\nAs a result, the faster devices at the lower threshold voltage distribution\ntail experience higher stress, leading to additional skewness in the BTI\ndegradation. Since time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and\nstress-induced leakage current (SILC) in NMOS devices are correlated to BTI, it\nis necessary to investigate the effect of time zero variability on all these\neffects simultaneously. To that effect, we propose a simulation framework to\nmodel and analyze the impact of time-zero variability (in particular, random\ndopant fluctuations) on different aging effects. For small area devices (~1000\nnm2) in 30nm technology, we observe significant effect of Random Dopant\nFluctuation (RDF) on BTI induced variability ({\\sigma}{\\Delta}Vth). In\naddition, the circuit analysis reveals similar trend on the performance\ndegradation. However, both TDDB and SILC show weak dependence on RDF. We\nconclude that the effect of RDF on Vth degradation cannot be disregarded in\nscaled technology and needs to be considered for variation tolerant circuit\ndesign.\n", "  We investigate one of the radiative models, Kraus-Nasri-Trodden model, with\nthe maximal value of Dirac CP violating phase, $\\delta$ is -\\pi/2 (or\nequivalently 3\\pi/2), which is preferred in not only recent long baseline\nexperiments but also the global fit of neutrino oscillation data. We show that\nour predicted region of the \\mu-e conversion rate can be searched in the future\nexperiments without conflicting lepton-flavor violation and dark matter\nconstraints.\n", "  The effect of the transversality condition on the quantization of the photon\norbital angular momentum is studied. The quantum gauge that is deduced from the\ntransversality condition is shown to be a Berry gauge. It determines a\nhelicity-dependent reference point relative to which the position is\ncanonically conjugate to the momentum. As a result, the photon orbital angular\nmomentum about the origin of the laboratory reference system split into two\nparts. One is the orbital angular momentum of the photon about the reference\npoint, which is canonical. The other is the orbital angular momentum of the\nphoton concentrated at the reference point, which is dependent on the helicity.\nOnly when the Berry-gauge degree of freedom of a paraxial beam is perpendicular\nto the propagation direction, does the total orbital angular momentum reduce to\nits canonical part. One of the observable effects of the Berry-gauge degree of\nfreedom is also clarified.\n", "  A thermal gradient as the driving force for spin currents plays a key role in\nspin caloritronics. In this field the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is of major\ninterest and was investigated in terms of in-plane thermal gradients inducing\nperpendicular spin currents (transverse SSE) and out-of-plane thermal gradients\ngenerating parallel spin currents (longitudinal SSE). Up to now all spincaloric\nexperiments employ a spatially fixed thermal gradient. Thus anisotropic\nmeasurements with respect to well defined crystallographic directions were not\npossible. Here we introduce a new experiment that allows not only the in-plane\nrotation of the external magnetic field, but also the rotation of an in-plane\nthermal gradient controlled by optical temperature detection. As a consequence,\nthe anisotropic magnetothermopower and the planar Nernst effect in a permalloy\nthin film can be measured simultaneously and reveal a phase shift, that allows\nthe quantitative separation of the thermopower, the anisotropic\nmagnetothermopower and the planar Nernst effect.\n", "  Hierarchical structures are very common in Nature, but only recently have\nthey been systematically studied in materials physics, in order to understand\nthe specific effects they can have on the mechanical properties of various\nsystems. Structural hierarchy provides a way to tune and optimize macroscopic\nmechanical properties starting from simple base constituents, and new materials\nare nowadays designed exploiting this possibility. This can be also true in the\nfield of tribology. In this paper, we study the effect of hierarchical\npatterned surfaces on the static and dynamic friction coefficients of an\nelastic material. Our results are obtained by means of numerical simulations\nusing a 1-D spring-block model, which has previously been used to investigate\nvarious aspects of friction. Despite the simplicity of the model, we highlight\nsome possible mechanisms that explain how hierarchical structures can\nsignificantly modify the friction coefficients of a material, providing a means\nto achieve tunability.\n", "  We present the development and performance of an optically detected magnetic\nresonance (ODMR) spectrometer. The spectrometer represents advances over\nsimilar instruments in three areas: i) the exciting light is a tunable laser\nsource which covers much of the visible light range, ii) the optical signal is\nanalyzed with a spectrograph, iii) the emitted light is detected in the\nnear-infrared domain. The need to perform ODMR experiments on single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes motivated the present development and we demonstrate the\nutility of the spectrometer on this material. The performance of the\nspectrometer is critically compared to similar instruments. The present\ndevelopment opens the way to perform ODMR studies on various new materials such\nas molecules and luminescent quantum dots where the emission is in the\nnear-infrared range and requires a well-defined excitation wavelength and\nanalysis of the scattered light.\n", "  Chirping frequency patterns have been observed in the electron cyclotron\nemission from strongly nonequilibrium plasma confined in a table-top mirror\nmagnetic trap. Such patterns are typical for the formation of nonlinear phase\nspace structures in a proximity of the wave-particle resonances of a\nkinetically unstable plasma, also known as the \"holes and clumps\" mechanism.\nOur data provides the first experimental evidence for acting of this mechanism\nin the electron cyclotron frequency domain.\n", "  We show how a simple calculation leads to the surprising result that an\nexcited two-level atom moving through vacuum sees a tiny friction force of\nfirst order in v/c. At first sight this seems to be in obvious contradiction to\nother calculations showing that the interaction with the vacuum does not change\nthe velocity of an atom. It is yet more surprising that this change in the\natom's momentum turns out to be a necessary result of energy and momentum\nconservation in special relativity.\n", "  The coherent Bragg scattering of photons converted from solar axions inside\ncrystals would boost the signal for axion-photon coupling enhancing\nexperimental sensitivity for these hypothetical particles. Knowledge of the\nscattering angle of solar axions with respect to the crystal lattice is\nrequired to make theoretical predications of signal strength. Hence, both the\nlattice axis angle within a crystal and the absolute angle between the crystal\nand the Sun must be known. In this paper, we examine how the experimental\nsensitivity changes with respect to various experimental parameters. We also\ndemonstrate that, in a multiple-crystal setup, knowledge of the relative axis\norientation between multiple crystals can improve the experimental sensitivity,\nor equivalently, relax the precision on the absolute solar angle measurement.\nHowever, if absolute angles of all crystal axes are measured, we find that a\nprecision of 2-4 degrees will suffice for an energy resolution of\n$\\sigma_E=0.04{\\rm E}$ and a flat background. Finally, we also show that, given\na minimum number of detectors, a signal model averaged over angles can\nsubstitute for precise crystal angular measurements, with some loss of\nsensitivity.\n", "  We develop a two-scale formalism to determine global magnetic helicity\nspectra in systems where the local magnetic helicity has opposite signs on both\nsides of the equator, giving rise to cancelation with conventional methods. We\nverify this approach using first a synthetic one-dimensional magnetic field and\nthen two-dimensional slices from a three-dimensional alpha effect-type\ndynamo-generated magnetic field with forced turbulence of opposite helicity\nabove and below the midplane of the domain. We then apply this formalism to\nglobal solar synoptic vector magnetograms. To improve the statistics, data from\nthree consecutive Carrington rotations (2161--2163) are combined into a single\nmap. We find that the spectral magnetic helicity representative of the northern\nhemisphere is negative at all wavenumbers and peaks at ~ 0.06 Mm^{-1} (scales\naround 100 Mm). There is no evidence of bihelical magnetic fields that are\nfound in three-dimensional turbulence simulations of helicity-driven alpha\neffect-type dynamos.\n", "  We calculate the large-scale cosmic-ray (CR) anisotropies predicted for a\nrange of Goldreich-Sridhar (GS) and isotropic models of interstellar\nturbulence, and compare them with IceTop data. In general, the predicted CR\nanisotropy is not a pure dipole; the cold spots reported at 400 TeV and 2 PeV\nare consistent with a GS model that contains a smooth deficit of\nparallel-propagating waves and a broad resonance function, though some other\npossibilities cannot, as yet, be ruled out. In particular, isotropic fast\nmagnetosonic wave turbulence can match the observations at high energy, but\ncannot accommodate an energy dependence in the shape of the CR anisotropy. Our\nfindings suggest that improved data on the large-scale CR anisotropy could\nprovide a valuable probe of the properties - notably the power-spectrum - of\nthe interstellar turbulence within a few tens of parsecs from Earth.\n", "  The importance of surface tension effects is being recognized in the context\nof soft composite solids, where it is found to significantly affect the\nmechanical properties, such as the elastic response to an external stress. It\nhas recently been discovered that Eshelby's inclusion theory breaks down when\nthe inclusion size approaches the elastocapillary length $L\\equiv\\gamma/E$,\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the inclusion/host surface tension and $E$ is the host\nYoung's modulus. Extending our recent results for liquid inclusions, here we\nmodel the elastic behavior of a non-dilute distribution of isotropic elastic\nspherical inclusions in a soft isotropic elastic matrix, subject to a\nprescribed infinitesimal far-field loading. Within our framework, the composite\nstiffness is uniquely determined by the elastocapillary length $L$, the\nspherical inclusion radius $R$, and the stiffness contrast parameter ${C}$,\nwhich is the ratio of the inclusion to the matrix stiffness. We compare the\nresults with those from the case of liquid inclusions, and we derive an\nanalytical expression for elastic cloaking of the composite by the inclusions.\nRemarkably, we find that the composite stiffness is influenced significantly by\nsurface tension even for inclusions two orders of magnitude more stiff than the\nhost matrix. Finally, we show how to simultaneously determine the surface\ntension and the inclusion stiffness using two independent constraints provided\nby global and local measurements.\n", "  We study embedding of non-commuting $Z_2$ and $Z_m$, $m\\geq 3$ symmetries in\ndiscrete subgroups (DSG) of $U(3)$ and analytically work out the mixing\npatterns implied by the assumption that $Z_2$ and $Z_m$ describe the residual\nsymmetries of the neutrino and the charged lepton mass matrices respectively.\nBoth $Z_2$ and $Z_m$ are assumed to be subgroups of a larger discrete symmetry\ngroup $G_f$ possessing three dimensional faithful irreducible representation.\nThe residual symmetries predict the magnitude of a column of the leptonic\nmixing matrix $U_{\\rm PMNS}$ which are studied here assuming $G_f$ as the DSG\nof $SU(3)$ designated as type C and D and large number of DSG of $U(3)$ which\nare not in $SU(3)$. These include the known group series $\\Sigma(3n^3)$,\n$T_n(m)$, $\\Delta(3n^2,m)$, $\\Delta(6n^2,m)$ and $\\Delta'(6n^2,j,k)$. It is\nshown that the predictions for a column of $|U_{\\rm PMNS}|$ in these group\nseries and the C and D types of groups are all contained in the predictions of\nthe $\\Delta(6N^2)$ groups for some integer $N$. The $\\Delta(6N^2)$ groups\ntherefore represent a sufficient set of $G_f$ to obtain predictions of the\nresidual symmetries $Z_2$ and $Z_m$.\n", "  In June 2015, the black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) V404 Cygni went into\noutburst for the first time since 1989. Here, we present a comprehensive search\nfor quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of V404 Cygni during its recent\noutburst, utilizing data from six instruments on board five different X-ray\nmissions: Swift/XRT, Fermi/GBM, Chandra/ACIS, INTEGRAL's IBIS/ISGRI and JEM-X,\nand NuSTAR. We report the detection of a QPO at 18 mHz simultaneously with both\nFermi/GBM and Swift/XRT, another example of a rare but slowly growing new class\nof mHz-QPOs in BHXRBs linked to sources with a high orbital inclination.\nAdditionally, we find a duo of QPOs in a Chandra/ACIS observation at 73 mHz and\n1.03 Hz, as well as a QPO at 136 mHz in a single Swift/XRT observation that can\nbe interpreted as standard Type-C QPOs. Aside from the detected QPOs, there is\nsignificant structure in the broadband power, with a strong feature observable\nin the Chandra observations between 0.1 and 1 Hz. We discuss our results in the\ncontext of current models for QPO formation.\n", "  We aim to give a pedagogic and essentially self-contained presentation of the\nconstruction of various stochastic objects appearing in the dynamical\n$\\Phi^4_3$ model. The construction presented here is based on the use of\nparaproducts. The emphasis is on describing the stochastic objects themselves\nrather than introducing a solution theory for the equation.\n", "  This paper studies a method of a two dimensional background calculation for\nan analysis of events with two particles of the same type registered in\nexperiments in high-energy physics. The standard two-dimensional integration is\nreplaced by an approximation of a specially constructed one-dimensional\nfunction. The number of the signal events is found by the subtraction of the\nbackground events. It allows calculating the purity of the selection. The\nprocedure does not require a hypothesis about background and signal shapes.\nMonte Carlo examples of double J/psi samples are used to demonstrate high\nperformance of the purity calculation method. A comparison of the method with\nstandard two-dimensional fit of the signal revealed a systematic shift of the\nfit results to lower values.\n", "  We identify the sequence of microstructural changes that characterize the\nevolution of an attractive particulate gel under flow and discuss their\nimplications on macroscopic rheology. Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) is\nused to monitor shear-driven evolution of a fabric tensor constructed from the\nensemble spatial configuration of individual attractive constituents within the\ngel. By decomposing this tensor into isotropic and non-isotropic components we\nshow that the average coordination number correlates directly with the flow\ncurve of the shear stress vs. shear rate, consistent with theoretical\npredictions for attractive systems. We show that the evolution in non-isotropic\nlocal particle rearrangements are primarily responsible for stress overshoots\n(strain-hardening) at the inception of steady shear flow and also lead, at\nlarger times and longer scales, to microstructural localization phenomena such\nas shear banding flow-induced structure formation in the vorticity direction.\n", "  We estimate the accretion rates onto the supermassive black holes that power\n20 of the highest-redshift quasars, at z>5.8, including the quasar with the\nhighest redshift known to date -- ULAS J1120 at z=7.09. The analysis is based\non the observed (rest-frame) optical luminosities and reliable \"virial\"\nestimates of the BH masses of the quasars, and utilizes scaling relations\nderived from thin accretion disk theory. The mass accretion rates through the\npostulated disks cover a wide range, dM_disk/dt~4-190 Msol/yr, with most of the\nobjects (80\\%) having dM_disk/dt~10-65 Msol/yr, confirming the\nEddington-limited nature of the accretion flows. By combining our estimates of\ndM_disk/dt with conservative, lower limits on the bolometric luminosities of\nthe quasars, we investigate which alternative values of \\eta best account for\nall the available data. We find that the vast majority of quasars (~85\\%) can\nbe explained with radiative efficiencies in the range \\eta~0.03-0.3, with a\nmedian value close to the commonly assumed \\eta=0.1. Within this range, we\nobtain conservative estimates of \\eta>0.14 for ULAS J1120 and SDSS J0100 (at\nz=6.3), and of >0.19 for SDSS J1148 (at z=6.41; assuming their BH masses are\naccurate). The implied accretion timescales are generally in the range t_acc =\nM_BH / dM_BH/dt ~0.1-1 Gyr, suggesting that most quasars could have had ~1-10\nmass e-foldings since BH seed formation. Our analysis therefore demonstrates\nthat the available luminosities and masses for the highest-redshift quasars can\nbe explained self-consistently within the thin, radiatively efficient accretion\ndisk paradigm. Episodes of radiatively inefficient, \"super-critical\" accretion\nmay have occurred at significantly earlier epochs (i.e., z~10 or above).\n", "  Among the population of known galactic black hole X-ray binaries, GRS\n1915+105 stands out in multiple ways. It has been in continuous outburst since\n1992, and has shown a wide range of different states that can be distinguished\nby their timing and spectral properties. These states, also observed in IGR\nJ17091-3624, have in the past been linked to accretion dynamics. Here, we\npresent the first comprehensive study into the long-term evolution of GRS\n1915+105, using the entire data set observed with RXTE over its sixteen-year\nlifetime. We develop a set of descriptive features allowing for automatic\nseparation of states, and show that supervised machine learning in the form of\nlogistic regression and random forests can be used to efficiently classify the\nentire data set. For the first time, we explore the duty cycle and time\nevolution of states over the entire sixteen-year time span, and find that the\ntemporal distribution of states has significantly changed over the span of the\nobservations. We connect the machine classification with physical\ninterpretations of the phenomenology in terms of chaotic and stochastic\nprocesses.\n", "  We study the non-perturbative superpotential in E_8 x E_8 heterotic string\ntheory on a non-simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold X, as well as on its\nsimply connected covering space \\tilde{X}. The superpotential is induced by the\nstring wrapping holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves. According to the residue\ntheorem of Beasley and Witten, the non-perturbative superpotential must vanish\nin a large class of heterotic vacua because the contributions from curves in\nthe same homology class cancel each other. We point out, however, that in\ncertain cases the curves treated in the residue theorem as lying in the same\nhomology class, can actually have different area with respect to the physical\nKahler form and can be in different homology classes. In these cases, the\nresidue theorem is not directly applicable and the structure of the\nsuperpotential is more subtle. We show, in a specific example, that the\nsuperpotential is non-zero both on \\tilde{X} and on X. On the non-simply\nconnected manifold X, we explicitly compute the leading contribution to the\nsuperpotential from all holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves with minimal\narea. The reason for the non-vanishing of the superpotental on X is that the\nsecond homology class contains a finite part called discrete torsion. As a\nresult, the curves with the same area are distributed among different torsion\nclasses and, hence, do not cancel each other.\n", "  We study a family of Maxwell-Higgs models, described by the inclusion of a\nfunction of the scalar field that represent generalized magnetic permeability.\nWe search for vortex configurations which obey first-order differential\nequations that solve the equations of motion. We first deal with the asymptotic\nbehavior of the field configurations, and then implement a numerical study of\nthe solutions, the energy density and the magnetic field. We work with the\ngeneralized permeability having distinct profiles, giving rise to new models,\nand we investigate how the vortices behave, compared with the solutions of the\ncorresponding standard models. In particular, we show how to build compact\nvortices, that is, vortex solutions with the energy density and magnetic field\nvanishing outside a compact region of the plane.\n", "  We investigate the propagation of a local perturbation in the two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model with a time-dependent application of mean-field\ntheory based on the BBGKY hierarchy. We show that the perturbation propagates\nthrough the system with a finite velocity and that there is transition from\nManhattan to Euclidian metric, resulting in a light cone with an almost\ncircular shape at sufficiently large distances. The propagation velocity of the\nperturbation defining the front of the light cone is discussed with respect to\nthe parameters of the Hamiltonian and compared to exact results for the\ntransverse-field Ising model in one dimension.\n", "  We present the differential decay rates and the branching ratios of the muon\ndecay with internal conversion, $\\mu \\to e \\, (e^+e^-) \\, \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$, in\nthe Standard Model at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the on-shell scheme. This\nrare decay mode of the muon is among the main sources of background to the\nsearch for $\\mu \\to eee$ decay. We found that in the phase space region where\nthe neutrino energies are small, and the three-electron momenta have a similar\nsignature as in the $\\mu \\to eee$ decay, the NLO corrections decrease the\nleading-order prediction by about $10-20\\%$\n", "  We present a systematic method to calculate the universal scaling functions\nfor the critical Casimir force and the according potential of the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model with various boundary conditions. Therefore we\nstart with the dimer representation of the corresponding partition function $Z$\non an $L\\times M$ square lattice, wrapped around a torus with aspect ratio\n$\\rho=L/M$. By assuming periodic boundary conditions and translational\ninvariance in at least one direction, we systematically reduce the problem to a\n$2\\times2$ transfer matrix representation. For the torus we first reproduce the\nresults by Kaufman and then give a detailed calculation of the scaling\nfunctions. Afterwards we present the calculation for the cylinder with open\nboundary conditions. All scaling functions are given in form of combinations of\ninfinite products and integrals. Our results reproduce the known scaling\nfunctions in the limit of thin films $\\rho\\to 0$. Additionally, for the\ncylinder at criticality our results confirm the predictions from conformal\nfield theory.\n", "  We have studied the Heisenberg antiferromagnets characterized by the magnetic\nstructures with the periods being two times larger than the lattice period. We\nhave considered all the types of the Bravais lattices (simple cubic, bcc and\nfcc) and divided all these antiferromagnets into 7 classes i.e. 3 plus 4\nclasses denoted with symbols A and B correspondingly. The order parameter\ncharacterizing the degeneracies of the magnetic structures is an ordinary Neel\nvector for A classes and so-called 4-complex for B classes. We have taken into\naccount the fluctuation corrections for these states within the spin-wave and\nlarge-N expansions ($N$ is the number of spin components). Below the Neel\ntemperature $T_{\\rm{N}}$ quantum and thermal fluctuations lift the degeneracy\nmaking simple one-wave vector collinear structure preferable for all the\nclasses. A satellite of this effect is opening of the exchange gaps at certain\nwave vectors in the spin wave spectrum (there is an analogous effect for the\nnonuniform static transverse susceptibility). However, as the temperature\napproaches $T_{\\rm{N}}$, the exchange gaps are closing. We have calculated the\ncritical indices $\\eta$ and $\\nu$ to order of $1/N$ and found that they differ\nfor A and B classes.\n", "  It is shown that anti-BRST invariance in quantum gauge theories can be\nconsidered as the quantized version of the symmetry of classical gauge theories\nwith respect to different gauge fixing mechanisms.\n", "  Experiments, theory and atomistic simulations show that finite triple\njunction mobility results in non-equilibrium triple junction angles in evolving\npolycrystalline systems. These angles have been predicted and verified for\ncases where grain boundary migration is steady-state. Yet, steady-state never\noccurs during the evolution of polycrystalline microstructures as a result of\nchanging grain size and topological events (e.g., grain face/edge switching -\n\"$T_1$\" process, or grain disappearance \"$T_2$\" or \"$T_3$\" processes). We\nexamine the non-steady evolution of the triple junction angle in the vicinity\nof topological events and show that large deviations from equilibrium and/or\nsteady-state angles occur. We analyze the characteristic relaxation time of\ntriple junction angles $\\tau$ by consideration of a pair of topological events,\nbeginning from steady-state migration. Using numerical results and theoretical\nanalysis we predict how the triple junction angle varies with time and how\n$\\tau$ varies with triple junction mobility. We argue that it is precisely\nthose cases where grain boundaries are moving quickly (e.g., topological\nprocess in nanocrystalline materials), that the classical steady-state\nprediction of the finite triple junction mobility triple junction angle is\ninapplicable and may only be applied qualitatively.\n", "  We present new ALMA band-7 data for a sample of six luminous quasars at\nz~4.8, powered by fast-growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with rather\nuniform properties: the typical accretion rates and black hole masses are\nL/L_Edd~0.7 and M_BH~10^9 M_sol. Our sample consists of three \"FIR-bright\"\nsources, which were individually detected in previous Herschel/SPIRE\nobservations, with star formation rates of SFR>1000 M_sol/yr, and three\n\"FIR-faint\" sources for which Herschel stacking analysis implies a typical SFR\nof ~400 M_sol/yr. The dusty interstellar medium in the hosts of all six quasars\nis clearly detected in the ALMA data and resolved on scales of ~2 kpc, in both\ncontinuum (\\lambda_rest ~150 um) and [C II]157.74 um line emission. The\ncontinuum emission is in good agreement with the expectations from the Herschel\ndata, confirming the intense SF activity in the quasar hosts. Importantly, we\ndetect companion sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) for three sources -- one\nFIR-bright and two FIR-faint, separated by ~14-45 kpc and <450 km/s from the\nquasar hosts. The [C II]-based dynamical mass estimates for the interacting\nSMGs are within a factor of ~3 of the quasar hosts' masses, while the continuum\nemission implies SFR(quasar)~(2-11)xSFR(SMG). Our ALMA data therefore clearly\nsupport the idea that major mergers are important drivers for rapid early SMBH\ngrowth. However, the fact that not all high-SFR quasar hosts are accompanied by\ninteracting SMGs and the gas kinematics as observed by ALMA suggest that other\nprocesses may be fueling these systems. Our analysis thus demonstrates the\ndiversity of host galaxy properties and gas accretion mechanisms associated\nwith early and rapid SMBH growth.\n", "  Several successful iterative approaches have recently been proposed for\nparallel-imaging reconstructions of variable-density (VD) acquisitions, but\nthey often induce substantial computational burden for non-Cartesian data. Here\nwe propose a generalized variable-FOV PILS reconstruction 3D VD Cartesian and\nnon-Cartesian data. The proposed method separates k-space into non-intersecting\nannuli based on sampling density, and sets the 3D reconstruction FOV for each\nannulus based on the respective sampling density. The variable-FOV method is\ncompared against conventional gridding, PILS, and ESPIRiT reconstructions.\nResults indicate that the proposed method yields better artifact suppression\ncompared to gridding and PILS, and improves noise conditioning relative to\nESPIRiT, enabling fast and high-quality reconstructions of 3D datasets.\n", "  We report the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of the\nexoplanet-hosting M-dwarf stars Kepler-138 and Kepler-186 from the analysis of\nhigh-resolution ($R$ $\\sim$ 22,500) $H$-band spectra from the SDSS IV - APOGEE\nsurvey. Chemical abundances of thirteen elements - C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca,\nTi, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe - are extracted from the APOGEE spectra of these early\nM-dwarfs via spectrum syntheses computed with an improved line list that takes\ninto account H$_{2}$O and FeH lines. This paper demonstrates that APOGEE\nspectra can be analyzed to determine detailed chemical compositions of\nM-dwarfs. Both exoplanet-hosting M-dwarfs display modest sub-solar\nmetallicities: [Fe/H]$_{Kepler-138}$ = -0.09 $\\pm$ 0.09 dex and\n[Fe/H]$_{Kepler-186}$ = -0.08 $\\pm$ 0.10 dex. The measured metallicities\nresulting from this high-resolution analysis are found to be higher by\n$\\sim$0.1-0.2 dex than previous estimates from lower-resolution spectra. The\nC/O ratios obtained for the two planet-hosting stars are near-solar, with\nvalues of 0.55 $\\pm$ 0.10 for Kepler-138 and 0.52 $\\pm$ 0.12 for Kepler-186.\nKepler-186 exhibits a marginally enhanced [Si/Fe] ratio.\n", "  We give an introduction to the theory of multi-partite entanglement. We begin\nby describing the \"coordinate system\" of the field: Are we dealing with pure or\nmixed states, with single or multiple copies, what notion of \"locality\" is\nbeing used, do we aim to classify states according to their \"type of\nentanglement\" or to quantify it? Building on the general theory of\nmulti-partite entanglement - to the extent that it has been achieved - we turn\nto explaining important classes of multi-partite entangled states, including\nmatrix product states, stabilizer and graph states, bosonic and fermionic\nGaussian states, addressing applications in condensed matter theory. We end\nwith a brief discussion of various applications that rely on multi-partite\nentangled states: quantum networks, measurement-based quantum computing,\nnon-locality, and quantum metrology.\n", "  Semilocal and electroweak strings are well-known to be unstable against\nunwinding by the condensation of the second Higgs component in their cores. A\nlarge class of current models of dark matter contains dark scalar fields\ncoupled to the Higgs sector of the Standard Model (Higgs portal) and/or dark\nU(1) gauge fields. It is shown, that Higgs-portal-type couplings and a gauge\nkinetic mixing term of the dark U(1) gauge field have a significant stabilising\neffect on semilocal strings in the \"visible\" sector.\n", "  Subgroup discovery (SGD) is presented here as a data-mining approach to help\nfind interpretable local patterns, correlations, and descriptors of a target\nproperty in materials-science data. Specifically, we will be concerned with\ndata generated by density-functional theory calculations. At first, we\ndemonstrate that SGD can identify physically meaningful models that classify\nthe crystal structures of 82 octet binary semiconductors as either rocksalt or\nzincblende. SGD identifies an interpretable two-dimensional model derived from\nonly the atomic radii of valence s and p orbitals that properly classifies the\ncrystal structures for 79 of the 82 octet binary semiconductors. The SGD\nframework is subsequently applied to 24 400 configurations of neutral gas-phase\ngold clusters with 5 to 14 atoms to discern general patterns between\ngeometrical and physicochemical properties. For example, SGD helps find that\nvan der Waals interactions within gold clusters are linearly correlated with\ntheir radius of gyration and are weaker for planar clusters than for nonplanar\nclusters. Also, a descriptor that predicts a local linear correlation between\nthe chemical hardness and the cluster isomer stability is found for the\neven-sized gold clusters.\n", "  In peripheral high-energy heavy-ion collisions only parts of colliding nuclei\ninteract leading to the production of a fireball. The remnants of such nuclei\nare called spectators. We estimated the excitation energy as a function of\nimpact parameter. Their excitation energy is of the order of 100 MeV. The\ndynamical evolution of hot nuclei is described by solving a set of Langevin\nequations in four-dimensional collective coordinate space. The range of nuclear\nmasses and excitation energies suits very well to ability of our model. Thus\nfor the first time we investigate dynamically the fission and evaporation\nchannels in de-excitation of the spectators produced in heavy-ions collision.\n", "  A statistical framework is presented for the study of the orthogonally\npolarized modes of radio pulsar emission via the covariances between the Stokes\nparameters. To accommodate the typically heavy-tailed distributions of\nsingle-pulse radio flux density, the fourth-order joint cumulants of the\nelectric field are used to describe the superposition of modes with arbitrary\nprobability distributions. The framework is used to consider the distinction\nbetween superposed and disjoint modes with particular attention to the effects\nof integration over finite samples. If the interval over which the polarization\nstate is estimated is longer than the timescale for switching between two or\nmore disjoint modes of emission, then the modes are unresolved by the\ninstrument. The resulting composite sample mean exhibits properties that have\nbeen attributed to mode superposition, such as depolarization. Because the\ndistinction between disjoint modes and a composite sample of unresolved\ndisjoint modes depends on the temporal resolution of the observing\ninstrumentation, the arguments in favour of superposed modes of pulsar emission\nare revisited and observational evidence for disjoint modes is described. In\nprinciple, the four-dimensional covariance matrix that describes the\ndistribution of sample mean Stokes parameters can be used to distinguish\nbetween disjoint modes, superposed modes, and a composite sample of unresolved\ndisjoint modes. More comprehensive and conclusive interpretation of the\ncovariance matrix requires more detailed consideration of various relevant\nphenomena, including temporally correlated subpulse modulation (e.g. jitter),\nstatistical dependence between modes (e.g. covariant intensities and partial\ncoherence), and multipath propagation effects (e.g. scintillation and\nscattering). Unpublished supplementary material is appended after the\nbibliography.\n", "  We investigate off-limb active region and quiet Sun corona using\nspectroscopic data. Active region is clearly visible in several spectral lines\nformed in the temperature range of 1.1--2.8 MK. We derive electron number\ndensity using line ratio method, and non-thermal velocity in the off-limb\nregion up to the distance of 140 Mm. We compare density scale heights derived\nfrom several spectral line pairs with expected scale heights as per hydrostatic\nequilibrium model. Using several isolated and unblended spectral line profiles,\nwe estimate non-thermal velocities in active region and quiet Sun. Non-thermal\nvelocities obtained from warm lines in active region first show increase and\nlater show either decrease or almost constant value with height in the far\noff-limb region, whereas hot lines show consistent decrease. However, in the\nquiet Sun region, non-thermal velocities obtained from various spectral lines\nshow either gradual decrease or remain almost constant with height. Using these\nobtained parameters, we further calculate Alfv\\'en wave energy flux in the both\nactive and quiet Sun regions. We find significant decrease in wave energy\nfluxes with height, and hence provide evidence of Alfv\\'en wave damping.\nFurthermore, we derive damping lengths of Alfv\\'en waves in the both regions\nand find them to be in the range of 25-170 Mm. Different damping lengths\nobtained at different temperatures may be explained as either possible\ntemperature dependent damping or measurements obtained in different coronal\nstructures formed at different temperatures along the line-of-sight.\nTemperature dependent damping may suggest some role of thermal conduction in\nthe damping of Alfv\\'en waves in the lower corona.\n", "  We present a search for magnetically broadened gamma-ray emission around\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN), using VERITAS observations of seven hard-spectrum\nblazars. A cascade process occurs when multi-TeV gamma rays from AGN interact\nwith extragalactic background light (EBL) photons to produce electron-positron\npairs, which then interact with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons via\ninverse-Compton scattering to produce gamma rays. Due to the deflection of the\nelectron-positron pairs, a non-zero intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) would\npotentially produce detectable effects on the angular distribution of the\ncascade emission. In particular, an angular broadening compared to the\nunscattered emission could occur. Through non-detection of angularly broadened\nemission from 1ES 1218+304, the source with the largest predicted cascade\nfraction, we exclude a range of IGMF strengths around $10^{-14}$G at the 95%\nconfidence level. The extent of the exclusion range varies with the assumptions\nmade about the intrinsic spectrum of 1ES 1218+304 and the EBL model used in the\nsimulation of the cascade process. All of the sources are used to set limits on\nthe flux due to extended emission.\n", "  Having no any explanations the radiation of high-frequency components of the\npulsar in the Crab Nebula can be a manifestation of instability in the\nnonlinear reflection from the neutron star surface. Reflected radiation it is\nthe radiation of relativistic positrons flying from the magnetosphere to the\nstar and accelerated by the electric field of the polar gap. The discussed\ninstability it is a stimulated scattering by surface waves, predicted more than\nforty years ago and still nowhere and by no one had been observed.\n", "  We formulate part I of a rigorous theory of ground states for classical,\nfinite, Heisenberg spin systems. The main result is that all ground states can\nbe constructed from the eigenvectors of a real, symmetric matrix with entries\ncomprising the coupling constants of the spin system as well as certain\nLagrange parameters. The eigenvectors correspond to the unique maximum of the\nminimal eigenvalue considered as a function of the Lagrange parameters.\nHowever, there are rare cases where all ground states obtained in this way have\nunphysical dimensions $M>3$ and the theory would have to be extended. Further\nresults concern the degree of additional degeneracy, additional to the trivial\ndegeneracy of ground states due to rotations or reflections. The theory is\nillustrated by a couple of elementary examples.\n", "  In the framework of the color-magnetic interaction, we have systematically\nstudied the mass splittings of the possible hidden-charm pentaquarks\n$qqqc\\bar{c}$ ($q=u,d,s$) where the three light quarks are in a color-octet\nstate. We find that i) the LHCb $P_c$ states fall in the mass region of the\nstudied system; ii) most pentaquarks should be broad states since their\n$S$-wave open-charm decays are allowed while the lowest state is the\n$J^P=\\frac12^-$ $\\Lambda$-like pentaquark with probably the suppressed\n$\\eta_c\\Lambda$ decay mode only; and iii) the $J^P=\\frac52^-$ states do not\ndecay through $S$-wave and their widths are not so broad. The masses and widths\nof the two LHCb $P_c$ baryons are compatible with such pentaquark states. We\nalso explore the hidden-bottom and $B_c$-like partners of the hidden-charm\nstates and find the possible existence of the pentaquarks which are lower than\nthe relevant hadronic molecules.\n", "  Many aspects of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) instrument are\nstill unknown due to its young age. One such aspect is the true nature of the\nprimary beam of each baseline, and how changes to the individual primary beams\naffect astronomical observations when said changes are ignored during imaging.\nThis paper aims to create a more thorough understanding of the strengths and\nweaknesses of ALMA through realistic modeling of the primary beams and\nsimulated observations, which in turn can inform the user of the necessity of\nimplementing more computationally costly algorithms, such as A-Projection, and\nwhen simpler, quicker algorithms will suffice. We quantify our results by\nexamining the dynamic range of each observation, along with the ability to\nreconstruct the Stokes I amplitude of the test sources. These tests conclude\nthat for dynamic ranges of less than 1000, for point sources and sources much\nsmaller than the main lobe of the primary beam, the accuracy of the primary\nbeam model beyond the physical size of the aperture simply doesn't matter. In\nobservations of large extended sources, deconvolution errors dominate the\nreconstructed images and the individual primary beam errors were\nindistinguishable from each other.\n", "  In this paper, we have applied a three-dimensional approach for calculation\nof the relativistic nucleon-nucleon potential. The quadratic operator relation\nbetween the non-relativistic and the relativistic nucleon-nucleon interactions\nis formulated as a function of relative two-nucleon momentum vectors, which\nleads to a three-dimensional integral equation. The integral equation is solved\nby the iteration method, and the matrix elements of the relativistic potential\nare calculated from non-relativistic ones. Spin-independent Malfliet-Tjon\npotential is employed in the numerical calculations, and the numerical tests\nindicate that the two-nucleon observables calculated by the relativistic\npotential are preserved with high accuracy.\n", "  We report the $4 \\, \\sigma$ detection of a faint object with a flux of ~ 0.3\nmJy, in the vicinity of the quadruply lensed QSO MG0414+0534 using the Atacama\nLarge Millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA) Band 7. The object is most probably\na dusty dark dwarf galaxy, which has not been detected in either the optical,\nnear-infrared (NIR) or radio (cm) bands. An anomaly in the flux ratio of the\nlensed images observed in Band 7 and the mid-infrared (MIR) band and the\nreddening of the QSO light color can be simultaneously explained if we consider\nthe object as a lensing substructure with an ellipticity ~ 0.7 at a redshift of\n$0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1$. Using the best-fit lens models with three lenses,\nwe find that the dark matter plus baryon mass associated with the object is\n$\\sim 10^9\\, M_{\\odot}$, the dust mass is $\\sim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ and the linear\nsize is $\\gtrsim 5\\,$kpc. Thus our findings suggest that the object is a dusty\ndark dwarf galaxy. A substantial portion of faint submillimeter galaxies (SMGs)\nin the universe may be attributed to such dark objects.\n", "  Monochalcogenides of germanium (or tin) are considered as stable\nisoelectronic and isostructural analogue of black phosphorous. Their\ntwo-dimensional (2D) forms have been just predicted to shown strong\nthickness-dependent physical properties, and even indirect to direct band gap\ncrossover at the monolayer limit. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of\natomically thin GeSe by direct sonication-assisted exfoliation of bulk\nmicrocrystalline powders in solvents. The exfoliated few-layer GeSe sheets\ncharacterize high crystallinity with lateral sizes over 100 nm and,\nimportantly, strong resistance against oxidation and degradation in ambient\nconditions. Density functional theory calculation combined with optical\ncharacterizations confirm the layer-number dependent optical bandgap, which,\nfor few-layer sheets, is optimal for solar light harvesting, and promising for\nrelevant applications, such as optoelectronics and photonics.\n", "  Recently, Ciufolini et al. reported on a test of the general relativistic\ngravitomagnetic Lense-Thirring effect by analyzing about 3.5 years of laser\nranging data to the LAGEOS, LAGEOS II, LARES geodetic satellites orbiting the\nEarth. By using the GRACE-based GGM05S Earth's global gravity model and a\nlinear combination of the nodes $\\Omega$ of the three satellites designed to\nremove the impact of errors in the first two even zonal harmonic coefficients\n$J_2,~J_4$ of the multipolar expansion of the Newtonian part of the Earth's\ngravitational potential, they claimed an overall accuracy of $5\\%$ for the\nLense-Thirring caused node motion. We show that the scatter in the nominal\nvalues of the uncancelled even zonals of degree $\\ell = 6,~8,~10$ from some of\nthe most recent global gravity models does not yet allow to reach unambiguously\nand univocally the expected $\\approx 1\\%$ level, being large up to $\\lesssim\n15\\%~(\\ell=6),~6\\%~(\\ell=8),~36\\%~(\\ell=10)$ for some pairs of models.\n", "  An integral scheme for the efficient evaluation of two-center integrals over\ncontracted solid harmonic Gaussian functions is presented. Integral expressions\nare derived for local operators that depend on the position vector of one of\nthe two Gaussian centers. These expressions are then used to derive the formula\nfor three-index overlap integrals where two of the three Gaussians are located\nat the same center. The efficient evaluation of the latter is essential for\nlocal resolution-of-the-identity techniques that employ an overlap metric. We\ncompare the performance of our integral scheme to the widely used Cartesian\nGaussian-based method of Obara and Saika (OS). Non-local interaction potentials\nsuch as standard Coulomb, modified Coulomb and Gaussian-type operators, that\noccur in range-separated hybrid functionals, are also included in the\nperformance tests. The speed-up with respect to the OS scheme is up to three\norders of magnitude for both, integrals and their derivatives. In particular,\nour method is increasingly efficient for large angular momenta and highly\ncontracted basis sets.\n", "  Dynamical materials that capable of responding to optical stimuli have always\nbeen pursued for designing novel photonic devices and functionalities, of which\nthe response speed and amplitude as well as integration adaptability and energy\neffectiveness are especially critical. Here we show ultrafast pulse generation\nby exploiting the ultrafast and sensitive nonlinear dynamical processes in\ntunably solution-processed colloidal epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) transparent\nconducting oxide (TCO) nanocrystals (NCs), of which the potential respond\nresponse speed is >2 THz and modulation depth is ~23% pumped at ~0.7 mJ/cm2,\nbenefiting from the highly confined geometry in addition to the ENZ enhancement\neffect. These ENZ NCs may offer a scalable and printable material solution for\ndynamic photonic and optoelectronic devices.\n", "  In a network, a local disturbance can propagate and eventually cause a\nsubstantial part of the system to fail, in cascade events that are easy to\nconceptualize but extraordinarily difficult to predict. Here, we develop a\nstatistical framework that can predict cascade size distributions by\nincorporating two ingredients only: the vulnerability of individual components\nand the co-susceptibility of groups of components (i.e., their tendency to fail\ntogether). Using cascades in power grids as a representative example, we show\nthat correlations between component failures define structured and often\nsurprisingly large groups of co-susceptible components. Aside from their\nimplications for blackout studies, these results provide insights and a new\nmodeling framework for understanding cascades in financial systems, food webs,\nand complex networks in general.\n", "  We apply the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion to the curve\ncorresponding to the quantum harmonic oscillator and demonstrate that the\nresult is equivalent to the WKB wave function. We also show that using the\nmulti-differentials obtained by the topological recursion from the harmonic\noscillator curve, one generates naturally the so-called Poincar\\'e polynomials\nassociated with the orbifolds of the metric ribbon graphs.\n", "  We acuminate the idea of a final theory of physics in order to analyze its\nlogical implications and consequences. It is argued that the rationale of a\nfinal theory is the principle of sufficient reason. This implies that a final\ntheory of physics, presumed such a theory is possible, does not allow to\nincorporate substantial (non-trivial) propositions unless they are logically or\nmathematically deduced. Differences between physics and mathematics are\ndiscussed with emphasis on the role of physical constants. It is shown that it\nis logically impossible to introduce constants on the fundamental level of a\nfinal theory. The most fundamental constants emerging within a final theory are\nconstants of motion.\n  It is argued that the only possibility to formulate a final theory is\nnecessarily a tautology: A final theory of physics can only be derived from\nthose presumptions about reality that are inherent in the idea and practice of\nphysics itself. It is argued that a final theory is based on the notion of\nobjectivity, but it is logically impossible that an ideal final theory supports\nrealism.\n", "  Phoretic swimmers provide new avenues to study non-equilibrium statistical\nphysics and are also hailed as a promising technology for bioengineering at the\ncellular scale. Exact solutions for the locomotion of such swimmers have been\nrestricted so far to spheroidal shapes. In this paper we solve for the flow\ninduced by the canonical non-simply connected shape, namely an axisymmetric\nphoretic torus. The analytical solution takes the form of an infinite series\nsolution, which we validate against boundary element computations. For a torus\nof uniform chemical activity, confinement effects in the hole allow the torus\nto act as a pump, which we optimize subject to fixed particle surface area.\nUnder the same constraint, we next characterize the fastest swimming Janus\ntorus for a variety of assumptions on the surface chemistry. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, none of the optimal tori occur in the limit where the central\nhole vanishes.\n", "  The theory of dislocation mediated plastic flow proposed by Langer,\nBouchbinder, and Lookman is applied to compute the stress-strain curve of\naluminum and aluminum alloys over a wide range of temperatures and strain\nrates. The comparison with experiment shows excellent agreement.\n", "  Continuous plasma coherent emission is maintained by repetitive Langmuir\ncollapse driven by the nonlinear evolution of a strong electron two-stream\ninstability. The Langmuir waves are modulated by solitary waves in the linear\nstage, and by electrostatic whistler waves in the nonlinear stage. Modulational\ninstability leads to Langmuir collapse and electron heating that fills in\ncavitons. The high pressure is released via excitation of a short wavelength\nion acoustic mode that is damped by electrons and that re-excites small-scale\nLangmuir waves---this process closes a feedback loop that maintains the\ncontinuous coherent emission.\n", "  We report the discovery of a very bright (r = 20.16), highly magnified, and\nyet intrinsically very luminous Ly{\\alpha} emitter (LAE) at z = 2.82. This\nsystem comprises four images in the observer plane with a maximum separation of\n~ 6\" and it is lensed by a z = 0.55 massive early-type galaxy. It was initially\nidentified in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line\nLens Survey for GALaxy-Ly{\\alpha} EmitteR sYstems (BELLS GALLERY) survey, and\nfollow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations using the Gran Telescopio\nCanarias (GTC) and William Herschel Telescope (WHT) confirmed the lensing\nnature of this system. A lens model using a singular isothermal ellipsoid in an\nexternal shear field reproduces quite well the main features of the system,\nyielding an Einstein radius of 2.95\" +/- 0.10\", and a total magnification\nfactor for the LAE of 8.8 +/- 0.4. This LAE is one of the brightest and most\nluminous galaxy-galaxy strong lenses known. We present initial imaging and\nspectroscopy showing the basic physical and morphological properties of this\nlensed system.\n", "  The energy functional, the governing partial differential equation(s) (PDE),\nand the boundary conditions need to be consistent with each other in a modeling\nsystem. In electrolyte solution study, people usually use a free energy form of\nan infinite domain system (with vanishing potential boundary condition) and the\nderived PDE(s) for analysis and computing. However, in many real systems and/or\nnumerical computing, the objective domain is finite, and people still use the\nsimilar energy form, PDE(s) but with different boundary conditions, which may\ncause inconsistency. In this work, (1) we present a mean field free energy\nfunctional for electrolyte solution within a finite domain with either physical\nor numerically required artificial boundary. Apart from the conventional energy\ncomponents (electrostatic potential energy, ideal gas entropy term and chemical\npotential term), new boundary interaction terms are added for both Neumann and\nDirichlet boundary conditions. These new terms count for physical interactions\nwith the boundary (for real boundary) or the environment influence on the\ncomputational domain system (for non-physical but numerically designed\nboundary). (2) The traditional physical-based Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation\nand Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations are proved to be consistent with the\nnew free energy form, and different boundary conditions can be applied. (3) In\nparticular, for inhomogeneous electrolyte with ionic concentration-dependent\ndielectric permittivity, we derive the generalized Boltzmann distribution\n(thereby the generalized PB equation) for equilibrium case, and the generalized\nPNP equations for non-equilibrium case, under different boundary conditions.\nNumerical tests are performed to demonstrate the different consequences\nresulted from different energy forms and their derived PDE(s).\n", "  In this note we show that the standard \\mbox{Rayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger} (RS)\nperturbation method gives the same result as the hypervirial pertubative method\n(HPM), for an approximate analytic expression for the energy eigenvalues of the\nbounded quartic oscillator. This connection between the HPM and the RS method\nwent unnoticed for a long time, apparently because it was not obvious that the\nresulting polygamma sums to be evaluated in the RS method could, in fact, be\nexpressed in closed form.\n", "  We present final results of a program for the determination of the Hubble\nconstant based on the calibration of the Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) using the\nTip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). We report TRGB distances to three SN Ia\nhost galaxies, NGC 3021, NGC 3370, and NGC 1309. We obtain F555W and F814W\nphotometry of resolved stars from the archival Hubble Space Telescope data.\nLuminosity functions of red giant stars in the outer regions of these galaxies\nshow the TRGB to be at I ~ QT = 28.2 ~ 28.5 mag. From these TRGB magnitudes and\nthe revised TRGB calibration based on two distance anchors (NGC 4258 and the\nLMC) in Jang&Lee 2017, we derive the distances: (m-M)0 = 32.178 +- 0.033 for\nNGC 3021, 32.253 +- 0.041 for NGC 3370, and 32.471 +- 0.040 for NGC 1309. We\nupdate our previous results on the TRGB distances to five SN Ia host galaxies\nusing the revised TRGB calibration. By combining the TRGB distance estimates to\nSN Ia host galaxies in this study with the SN Ia calibration provided by Riess\net al. 2011, we obtain a value of the Hubble constant: H0 = 71.66 +- 1.80\n(random) +- 1.88 (systematic) km/s/Mpc (a 3.6% uncertainty including\nsystematics) from all eight SNe, and H0 = 73.72 +- 2.03 +- 1.94 km/s/Mpc (a\n3.8% uncertainty) from six low-reddened SNe. We present our best estimate, H0 =\n71.17 +- 1.66 +- 1.87 km/s/Mpc (a 3.5% uncertainty) from six low-reddened SNe\nwith the recent SN Ia calibration in Riess et al. 2016. This value is between\nthose from the Cepheid calibrated SNe Ia and those from the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) analysis, lowering the Hubble tension.\n", "  In the absence of empirical confirmation, scientists may judge a theory's\nchances of being viable based on a wide range of arguments. The paper argues\nthat such arguments can differ substantially with regard to their structural\nsimilarly to empirical confirmation. Arguments that resemble empirical\nconfirmation in a number of crucial respects provide a better basis for\nreliable judgement and can, in a Bayesian sense, amount to significant\n\\textit{non-empirical} confirmation. It is shown that three kinds of\nnon-empirical confirmation that have been specified in earlier work do satisfy\nthose conditions.\n", "  Mm-sized LiMn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$PO$_4$ single crystals with $0\\leq x \\leq 1$ were\ngrown by means of the traveling floating-zone technique at elevated Argon\npressure of 30~bar. For the various doping levels, the growth process was\noptimized with respect to the composition-dependant effective light absorption\nand transparency of the materials. A convex crystal/melt interface, determined\nby the angle of incident light, was identified to be particularly crucial for a\nsuccessful growth. The resulting large single crystalline grains are\nstoichiometric. Structure refinement shows that lattice parameters as well as\nthe atomic positions and bond lengths linearly depend on the Mn:Fe-ratio.\nOriented cuboidal samples with several mm$^3$ of volume were used for magnetic\nstudies which imply an antiferromagnetic ground state for all compositions. The\nN\\'eel-temperature changes from $T_N$ = 32.5(5) K in LiMnPO$_4$ to 49.5(5) K in\nLiFePO$_4$ while the easy magnetic axis in the ordered phase flips from the\ncrystallographic $a$- to the $b$-axis upon Fe-doping of $x<0.2$.\n", "  The ability to control electromagnetic fields, heat currents, electric\ncurrents, and other physical phenomena by coordinate transformation methods has\nresulted in novel functionalities, such as cloaking, field rotations, and\nconcentration effects. Transformation optics, as the underlying mathematical\ntool, has proven to be a versatile approach to achieve such unusual outcomes\nrelying on materials with highly anisotropic and inhomogeneous properties. Most\napplications and designs thus far have been limited to functionalities within a\nsingle physical domain. Here we present transformation optics applied to\nthermoelectric phenomena, where thermal and electric flows are coupled via the\nSeebeck coefficient and Joule heating is taken into account. Using laminates,\nwe describe a theoretical thermoelectric cloak capable of hiding objects from\nthermoelectric flow. Our calculations show that such a cloak does not depend on\nthe particular boundary conditions and can also operate in different single\ndomain regimes. These proof-of-principle results constitute a significant step\nforward towards finding unexplored ways to control and manipulate coupled\ntransport.\n", "  By developing a two-dimensional (2D) full quantum simulation, the attributes\nof carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) in different temperatures\nhave been comprehensively investigated. Simulations have been performed by\nemploying the self-consistent solution of 2D Poisson-Schrodinger equations\nwithin the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. Principal\ncharacteristics of CNTFETs such as current capability, drain conductance,\ntransconductance, and subthreshold swing (SS) have been investigated.\nSimulation results present that the drain conductance and on-current of the\nCNTFET increases as temperature raises from 250 to 500 K. Meanwhile the\non-/off-current ratio deteriorated due to faster growth in off-current. Also\nthe effects of temperature on short channel effects (SCEs) such as\ndrain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and threshold voltage roll-off have been\nstudied. Results show that the subthreshold swing and DIBL parameters are\nalmost linearly correlated, so the degradation of these parameters has the same\norigin and can be perfectly influenced by the temperature.\n", "  Cosmic Microwave Background anomalies suggest that the Universe is slightly\nanisotropic, so a Cosmological Model that does not satisfy the Cosmological\nPrinciple is necessary. Anisotropic Bianchi models have been studied given that\nthey would be necessary to understand the early stages of the Universe. In this\npaper, we analyze qualitatively the behavior of the cosmological redshift in a\nBianchi type I model after a coordinate transformation in three cases: vacuum\nwith no vanishing cosmological constant $\\Lambda \\not= 0$, universe dominated\nby dust and universe dominated by radiation.\n", "  We present results of our dense spectroscopic monitoring of Nova V5668 Sgr.\nStarting on March 19 in 2015, only a few days after discovery, we have obtained\na series of spectra with the TIGRE telescope and its HEROS echelle spectrograph\nwhich offers a resolution of R = 20,000 and covers the optical wavelength range\nfrom 3800 to 8800 {\\AA}. We performed a line identification of the discernible\nfeatures for four spectra which are representative for the respective phases in\nthe light curve evolution of that nova. By simultaneously analysing the\nvariations in the visual light curve and the corresponding spectra of Nova\nV5668 Sgr, we found that during the declining phases of the nova the absorption\nfeatures in all hydrogen and many other lines had shifted to higher expansion\nvelocities of -2000 km s^-1. Conversely, during the rise towards the following\nmaximum, these observed absorption features had returned to lower expansion\nvelocities.We found that the absorption features of some Fe II lines displayed\nthe same behaviour, but in addition disappeared for a few days during some\ndeclining phases. Features of several N I lines also disappeared while new N II\nlines appeared in emission for a few days during some of the declining phases\nof the light curve of Nova V5668 Sgr. The shape of the emission features is\nchanging during the evolution and shows a clear double peak structure after the\ndeep minimum.\n", "  Building on the first part of this paper, we develop the theory of functional\nasynchronous networks. We show that a large class of functional asynchronous\nnetworks can be (uniquely) represented as feedforward networks connecting\nevents or dynamical modules. For these networks we can give a complete\ndescription of the network function in terms of the function of the events\ncomprising the network: the Modularization of Dynamics Theorem. We give\nexamples to illustrate the main results.\n", "  Fluctuations are one of the main probes of the physics of the new state of\nhot and dense nuclear matter called the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) which is\ncreated in the ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this dissertation we\nextend and improve upon the existing descriptions of heavy ion collisions in\nthree different directions: we study the new signatures of initial state\nfluctuations, the propagation of perturbations in the early stages of the\ncollision, and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the hydrodynamic expansion\nof the QGP. First, we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to study\nevent-by-event fluctuations in the spectrum of harmonic flow, $v_n(p_T)$ for\n$n=0\\text{--}5$, in hydrodynamic simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\\,{\\rm TeV}$). The PCA procedure\nfinds two dominant contributions to the two-particle correlation function: the\nleading component is identified with the standard event plane $v_n(p_T)$ and\nthe subleading component is responsible for factorization breaking and reflects\nthe radial excitation in the initial state. Second, we use leading order\neffective kinetic theory (accurate at weak coupling) to simulate the\npre-equilibrium evolution of transverse energy and flow perturbations. We\nconstruct the linear response Green functions, which map initial perturbations\nto the energy momentum tensor at a time when hydrodynamics becomes applicable.\nFinally, we develop a set of kinetic equations for thermal noise correlators\nwhich are equivalent to nonlinear hydrodynamics with noise. We use the\nhydro-kinetic equations to analyze thermal fluctuations for a Bjorken expansion\nand determine the coefficient of the first fractional power ($\\propto 1/(\\tau\nT)^{3/2}$) of the nonlinear noise corrections to energy momentum tensor.\n", "  We demonstrate the fabrication of individual nanopores in hexagonal boron\nnitride (hBN) with atomically precise control of the pore size. Previous\nmethods of pore production in other 2D materials create pores of irregular\ngeometry with imprecise diameters. By taking advantage of the preferential\ngrowth of boron vacancies in hBN under electron beam irradiation, we are able\nto observe the pore growth via transmission electron microscopy, and terminate\nthe process when the pore has reached its desired size. Careful control of beam\nconditions allows us to nucleate and grow individual triangular and hexagonal\npores with diameters ranging from subnanometer to 6nm over a large area of\nsuspended hBN using a conventional TEM. These nanopores could find application\nin molecular sensing, DNA sequencing, water desalination, and molecular\nseparation. Furthermore, the chemical edge-groups along the hBN pores can be\nmade entirely nitrogen terminated or faceted with boron-terminated edges,\nopening avenues for tailored functionalization and extending the applications\nof these hBN nanopores.\n", "  Fully reconfigurable metasurfaces would enable new classes of optical devices\nthat provide unprecedented control of electromagnetic beamforms. The principal\nchallenge for achieving reconfigurability is the need to generate large\ntunability of subwavelength, low-Q metasurface resonators. Here, we demonstrate\nlarge refractive index tuning can be efficiently facilitated at mid-infrared\nwavelengths using novel temperature-dependent control over free-carrier\nrefraction. In doped InSb we demonstrate nearly two-fold increase in the\nelectron effective mass leading to a positive refractive index shift\n({\\Delta}n>1.5) far greater than conventional thermo-optic effects. In undoped\nfilms we demonstrate more than 10-fold change in the thermal free-carrier\nconcentration producing a near-unity negative refractive index shift.\nExploiting both effects within a single resonator system, intrinsic InSb wires\non a heavily doped (epsilon near zero) InSb substrate, we demonstrate\ndynamically tunable Mie resonances. The observed larger than line-width\nresonance shifts ({\\Delta}{\\lambda}>1.5{\\mu}m) suggest new avenues for highly\ntunable and reconfigurable mid-infrared semiconductor metasurfaces.\n", "  The principle of material frame indifference is shown to be incompatible with\nthe basic balance laws of continuum mechanics. In its role of providing\nconstraints on possible constitutive prescriptions it must be replaced by the\nclassical principle of Galilean invariance.\n", "  We report comprehensive studies of the single crystal growth and electrical\ntransport properties for various samples of TaAs, the first experimentally\nconfirmed inversion symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetal. The transport parameters\nfor different samples are obtained through the fitting of the two band model\nand the analysis of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations. We find that the ratio\nfactor of transport lifetime to quantum lifetime is intensively enhanced when\nthe Fermi level approaches the Weyl node. This result is consistent with the\nside-jump interpretation derived from a chirality-protected shift in the\nscattering process for a Weyl semimetal.\n", "  Random network models play a prominent role in modeling, analyzing and\nunderstanding complex phenomena on real-life networks. However, a key property\nof networks is often neglected: many real-world networks exhibit spatial\nstructure, the tendency of a node to select neighbors with a probability\ndepending on physical distance. Here, we introduce a class of random spatial\nnetworks (RSNs) which generalizes many existing random network models but adds\nspatial structure. In these networks, nodes are placed randomly in space and\njoined in edges with a probability depending on their distance and their\nindividual expected degrees, in a manner that crucially remains analytically\ntractable. We use this network class to propose a new generalization of\nsmall-world networks, where the average shortest path lengths in the graph are\nsmall, as in classical Watts-Strogatz small-world networks, but with close\nspatial proximity of nodes that are neighbors in the network playing the role\nof large clustering. Small-world effects are demonstrated on these spatial\nsmall-world networks without clustering. We are able to derive partial\nintegro-differential equations governing susceptible-infectious-recovered\ndisease spreading through an RSN, and we demonstrate the existence of traveling\nwave solutions. If the distance kernel governing edge placement decays slower\nthan exponential, the population-scale dynamics are dominated by long-range\nhops followed by local spread of traveling waves. This provides a theoretical\nmodeling framework for recent observations of how epidemics like Ebola evolve\nin modern connected societies, with long-range connections seeding new focal\npoints from which the epidemic locally spreads in a wavelike manner.\n", "  Several anomalies in the semileptonic B-meson decays such as\n$\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ have been reported by $BABAR$, Belle, and LHCb\ncollaborations recently. In this paper, we investigate the contributions of the\ncharged Higgs bosons from the 3-3-1 models to the $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$\nanomalies. We find that, in a wide range of parameter space, the 3-3-1 models\nmight give reasonable explanations to the $\\mathcal{R}(D^{(*)})$ anomalies and\nother analogous anomalies of the B meson's semileptonic decays.\n", "  We present updated studies on the chiral phase transition in $N_{f}=2+1$ QCD.\nSimulations have been carried out using Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ)\non lattices with temporal extent $N_{\\tau} = 6$ at vanishing baryon chemical\npotential. We updated our previous study \\cite{Ding:2015pmg} by extending the\ntemperature window from (140 MeV, 150 MeV) to (140 MeV, 170 MeV). The strange\nquark mass was chosen to its physical value $m_{s}^{\\mathrm{phy}}$, and five\nvalues of two degenerate light quark masses are varied from\n$m_{s}^{\\mathrm{phy}}/80$ to $m_{s}^{\\mathrm{phy}}/20$ which correspond to a\nGoldstone pion mass ranging from 80 MeV to 160 MeV in the continuum limit. The\nuniversal scaling behaviour of the QCD chiral phase transition is investigated\nby studying the temperature and quark mass dependences of chiral condensates\nand chiral susceptibilities. The window of criticality compared to previous\nstudies is also discussed.\n", "  In this work, the authors give a new method for phase determination, the Tian\npseudo atom method (TPAM) or pseudo atom method (PAM) for short. In this new\nmethod, the figure of merit function, Rtian, replaces Rcf in the charge\nflipping algorithm. The key difference between Rcf and Rtian is the oberved\nstructure factor was replaced by the pseudo structure factor. The test results\nshow that Rtian is more powerful and robust than Rcf to estimate the correct\nstructure especially with low resolution data. Therefore, the pseudo atom\nmethod could overcome the charge flipping method's defeat to some extent. In\ntheory, the pseudo atom method could deal with quite low resolution data but it\nneeds a further test.\n", "  Characteristic photoluminescence (PL) of nanodiamonds (ND) of very different\norigin (detonation, HPHT, extracted from meteorite) was studied in situ at high\ntemperatures in the range 20-450C. Luminescence was excited using 473 nm laser\nand recorded in the range 500-800 nm. In contrast to decrease of point defect\nPL in bulk diamond with temperature, we found that the nanodiamond luminescence\nrelated to ND surface defects increases almost an order of magnitude upon\nheating to 200-250 C. The observed effect reveals that water adsorbed on ND\nsurfaces efficiently quenches photoluminescence, water desorption on heating\nleads to dramatic increase of the radiative de-excitation.\n", "  The advance of terahertz science and technology yet lays wait for the\nbreakthrough in high-efficiency and high-power solid-state terahertz sources\napplicable at room temperature. Plasmon in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)\nhas long been pursued as a type of promising active medium for terahertz\nemitters. However, a high wall-plug efficiency sufficient for high-power\noperation has not been achieved. Here we report spontaneous terahertz emission\ntunable in a frequency range from 0.3 to 2.5 THz through electrical excitation\nof plasmon or plasmon-polariton modes in a grating-gate coupled AlGaN/GaN 2DEG\nat 7 K. A wall-plug efficiency ranging from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-1}$ is found by\ntuning the energy (4.5 eV to 0.5 eV) of tunneling electrons between the grating\ngates and the 2DEG. The total emission power, albeit below 15 nW, is already\ndetectable by using a direct terahertz field-effect transistor detector based\non the same type of 2DEG. The findings indicate that both high-efficiency and\nhigh-power terahertz plasmon-polariton emission could be obtained by a proper\ninjection of tunneling electrons with low energy and high current density.\n", "  Electrical characteristics are measured in submicron YBaCuO-normal metal\npoint contacts with a direct conductivity. In a microwave field, such contacts\nreveal a nonstationary Josephson effect which can occur in the current\nconcentration region not only in the initial weak bonds in YBaCuO but also the\nweak bonds of a phase-slip center type, formed as a result of a significant\ncurrent injection (as well as a microwave field). The existence of internal\nweak bonds in the HTS-electrode contact area produces a narrow minimum in the\ndifferential resistance near zero biases. Moreover, the effect of magnetic flux\nquantization is observed for separate granules in magnetic fields stronger than\nthe first critical field.\n", "  Brittle materials fail catastrophically. In consequence of their limited\nflaw-tolerance, failure occurs by localized fracture and is typically a dynamic\nprocess. Recently, experiments on epithelial cell monolayers have revealed that\nthis scenario can be significantly modified when the material susceptible to\ncracking is adhered to a hydrogel substrate. Thanks to the hydraulic coupling\nbetween the brittle layer and the poroelastic substrate, such a composite can\ndevelop a toughening mechanism that relies on the simultaneous growth of\nmultiple cracks. Here, we study this remarkable behaviour by means of a\ndetailed model, and explore how the material and loading parameters concur in\ndetermining the macroscopic toughness of the system. By extending a previous\nstudy, our results show that rapid loading conveys material toughness by\npromoting distributed cracking. Moreover, our theoretical findings may suggest\ninnovative architectures of flaw-insensitive materials with higher toughness.\n", "  This paper summarizes the basics of the notion of quantum discord and how it\nrelates to other types of correlations in quantum physics. We take the\nfundamental information theoretic approach and illustrate our exposition with a\nnumber of simple examples.\n", "  This document collects the proceedings of the \"Parton Radiation and\nFragmentation from LHC to FCC-ee\" workshop (http://indico.cern.ch/e/ee\\_jets16)\nheld at CERN in Nov. 2016. The writeup reviews the latest theoretical and\nexperimental developments on parton radiation and parton-hadron fragmentation\nstudies --including analyses of LEP, B-factories, and LHC data-- with a focus\non the future perspectives reacheable in $e^+e^-$ measurements at the Future\nCircular Collider (FCC-ee), with multi-ab$^{-1}$ integrated luminosities\nyielding 10$^{12}$ and 10$^{8}$ jets from Z and W bosons decays as well as\n10$^5$ gluon jets from Higgs boson decays. The main topics discussed are: (i)\nparton radiation and parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (splitting\nfunctions at NNLO, small-$z$ NNLL resummations, global FF fits including Monte\nCarlo (MC) and neural-network analyses of the latest Belle/BaBar high-precision\ndata, parton shower MC generators), (ii) jet properties (quark-gluon\ndiscrimination, $e^+e^-$ event shapes and multi-jet rates at NNLO+N$^{n}$LL,\njet broadening and angularities, jet substructure at small-radius, jet charge\ndetermination, $e^+e^-$ jet reconstruction algorithms), (iii) heavy-quark jets\n(dead cone effect, charm-bottom separation, gluon-to-$b\\bar{b}$ splitting), and\n(iv) non-perturbative QCD phenomena (colour reconnection, baryon and\nstrangeness production, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac final-state correlations,\ncolour string dynamics: spin effects, helix hadronization).\n", "  We study the Casimir effect for a bosonic string extended between D-branes,\nand living in a flat space with an antisymmetric background B-field. We find\nthe Casimir energy as a function of theB-field, and the mass-parameter of the\nstring, and accordingly we obtain a B-dependence correction term to the\nground-state mass of the string. We show that for sufficiently large B-field,\nthe ground state of the string contains real (i.e. non-Tachyonic) particles.\n", "  A standard method to obtain information on a quantum state is to measure\nmarginal distributions along many different axes in phase space, which forms a\nbasis of quantum state tomography. We theoretically propose and experimentally\ndemonstrate a general framework to manifest nonclassicality by observing a\nsingle marginal distribution only, which provides a novel insight into\nnonclassicality and a practical applicability to various quantum systems. Our\napproach maps the 1-dim marginal distribution into a factorized 2-dim\ndistribution by multiplying the measured distribution or the vacuum-state\ndistribution along an orthogonal axis. The resulting fictitious Wigner function\nbecomes unphysical only for a nonclassical state, thus the negativity of the\ncorresponding density operator provides an evidence of nonclassicality.\nFurthermore, the negativity measured this way yields a lower bound for\nentanglement potential---a measure of entanglement generated using a\nnonclassical state with a beam splitter setting that is a prototypical model to\nproduce continuous-variable (CV) entangled states. Our approach detects both\nGaussian and non-Gaussian nonclassical states in a reliable and efficient\nmanner. Remarkably, it works regardless of measurement axis for all\nnon-Gaussian states in finite-dimensional Fock space of any size, also\nextending to infinite-dimensional states of experimental relevance for CV\nquantum informatics. We experimentally illustrate the power of our criterion\nfor motional states of a trapped ion confirming their nonclassicality in a\nmeasurement-axis independent manner. We also address an extension of our\napproach combined with phase-shift operations, which leads to a stronger test\nof nonclassicality, i.e. detection of genuine non-Gaussianity under a CV\nmeasurement.\n", "  Ego-networks are fundamental structures in social graphs, yet the process of\ntheir evolution is still widely unexplored. In an online context, a key\nquestion is how link recommender systems may skew the growth of these networks,\npossibly restraining diversity. To shed light on this matter, we analyze the\ncomplete temporal evolution of 170M ego-networks extracted from Flickr and\nTumblr, comparing links that are created spontaneously with those that have\nbeen algorithmically recommended. We find that the evolution of ego-networks is\nbursty, community-driven, and characterized by subsequent phases of explosive\ndiameter increase, slight shrinking, and stabilization. Recommendations favor\npopular and well-connected nodes, limiting the diameter expansion. With a\nmatching experiment aimed at detecting causal relationships from observational\ndata, we find that the bias introduced by the recommendations fosters global\ndiversity in the process of neighbor selection. Last, with two link prediction\nexperiments, we show how insights from our analysis can be used to improve the\neffectiveness of social recommender systems.\n", "  The kinetic effects of electrons are important to long wavelength\nmagnetohydrodynamic(MHD)instabilities and short wavelength drift-Alfvenic\ninstabilities responsible for turbulence transport in magnetized plasmas, since\nthe non-adiabatic electron can interact with, modify and drive the low\nfrequency instabilities. A novel conservative split weight scheme is proposed\nfor the electromagnetic simulation with drift kinetic electrons in tokamak\nplasmas, which shows great computational advantages that there is no numerical\nconstrain of electron skin depth on the perpendicular grid size without\nsacrificing any physics. Both kinetic Alfven wave and collision-less tearing\nmode are verified by using this model, which has already been implemented into\nthe gyrokinetic toroidal code(GTC). This model will be used for the micro\ntearing mode and neoclassical tearing mode simulation based on the first\nprinciple in the future.\n", "  Simulation (molecular dynamics and Car-Parrinello [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2471\n(1985)]) and diffraction (x-ray and neutron) studies on nitromethane are\ncompared aiming at the determination of the liquid structure. Beyond that, the\ncapabilities of the methods to describe liquid structure are discussed. For the\nstudied liquid, the diffraction methods are performing very well in the\ndetermination of intramolecular structure, but they do not give detailed\nstructural information on the intermolecular structure. The good agreement\nbetween the diffraction experiments and the results of molecular dynamics\nsimulations justifies the use of simulations for the more detailed description\nof the liquid structure using partial radial distribution functions and\norientational correlation functions. Liquid nitromethane is described as a\nmolecular liquid without strong intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen\nbonding, but with detectable orientational correlations resulting in\npreferential antiparallel order of the neighboring molecules.\n", "  We investigate Maxwell's attempt to justify the mathematical assumptions\nbehind his 1860 Proposition IV according to which the velocity components of\ncolliding particles follow the normal distribution. Contrary to the commonly\nheld view we find that his molecular collision model plays a crucial role in\nreaching this conclusion, and that his model assumptions also permit inference\nto equalization of mean kinetic energies (temperatures), which is what he\nintended to prove in his discredited and widely ignored Proposition VI. If we\ntake a charitable reading of his own proof of Proposition VI then it was\nMaxwell, and not Boltzmann, who gave the first proof of a tendency towards\nequilibrium, a sort of H-theorem. We also call attention to a potential\nconflation of notions of probabilistic and value independence in relevant prior\nworks of his contemporaries and of his own, and argue that this conflation\nmight have impacted his adoption of the suspect independence assumption of\nProposition IV.\n", "  Cellulose is the most abundant bio-polymer on earth. Cellulose fibres, such\nas the one extracted form cotton or woodpulp, have been used by humankind for\nhundreds of years to make textiles and paper. Here we show how, by engineering\nlight matter-interaction, we can optimise light scattering using exclusively\ncellulose nanocrystals. The produced material is sustainable, biocompatible\nand, when compared to ordinary microfibre-based paper, it shows enhanced\nscattering strength (x4) yielding a transport mean free path as low as 3.5 um\nin the visible light range. The experimental results are in a good agreement\nwith the theoretical predictions obtained with a diffusive model for light\npropagation.\n", "  Witten's Gauged Linear $\\sigma$-Model (GLSM) unifies the Gromov-Witten theory\nand the Landau-Ginzburg theory, and provides a global perspective on mirror\nsymmetry. In this article, we summarize a mathematically rigorous construction\nof the GLSM in the geometric phase using methods from symplectic geometry.\n", "  Many-body localization transition in a periodically driven quantum system is\ninvestigated using a solution of a matching Bethe lattice problem for Floquet\nstates of a quantum random energy model with a generalization to more realistic\nsettings. It turns out that an external periodic field can both suppress and\nenhance localization depending on field amplitude and frequency which leads to\nthree distinguishable regimes of field enhanced, controlled and suppressed\ndelocalization. The results can be verified experimentally in systems of cold\natoms and/or interacting spin defects in semiconductors.\n", "  Recent years have seen tremendous growth of many online social networks such\nas Facebook, LinkedIn and MySpace. People connect to each other through these\nnetworks forming large social communities providing researchers rich datasets\nto understand, model and predict social interactions and behaviors. New\ncontacts in these networks can be formed due to an individual's demographic\nattributes such as age group, gender, geographic location, or due to a\nnetwork's structural dynamics such as triadic closure and preferential\nattachment, or a combination of both demographic and structural\ncharacteristics.\n  A number of network generation models have been proposed in the last decade\nto explain the structure, evolution and processes taking place in different\ntypes of networks, and notably social networks. Network generation models\nstudied in the literature primarily consider structural properties, and in some\ncases an individual's demographic profile in the formation of new social\ncontacts. These models do not present a mechanism to combine both structural\nand demographic characteristics for the formation of new links. In this paper,\nwe propose a new network generation algorithm which incorporates both these\ncharacteristics to model network formation. We use different publicly available\nFacebook datasets as benchmarks to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed\nnetwork generation model. The proposed model is flexible and thus can generate\nnetworks with varying demographic and structural properties.\n", "  A review of the current state of our understanding of complete fusion\nreaction mechanisms is presented, from the perspective of an experimentalist.\nFor complete fusion reactions, the overall uncertainties in predicting heavy\nelement synthesis cross sections are examined in terms of the uncertainties\nassociated with the calculations of capture cross sections, fusion\nprobabilities and survival probabilities.\n", "  To describe many-particle systems suspended in incompressible\nlow-Reynolds-number fluids, effective hydrodynamic interactions can be\nintroduced. Here, we consider particles embedded in elastic media. The\neffective elastic interactions between spherical particles are calculated\nanalytically, inspired by the approach in the fluid case. Our experiments on\ninteracting magnetic particles confirm the theory. In view of the huge success\nof the method in hydrodynamics, we similarly expect many future applications in\nthe elastic case, e.g. for elastic composite materials.\n", "  Turbophoresis leading to preferential concentration of inertial particles in\nregions of low turbulent diffusivity is a unique feature of inhomogeneous\nturbulent flows, such as free shear flows or wall-bounded flows. In this work,\nthe theory for clustering of weakly inertial particles in homogeneous\nturbulence is extended to the inhomogeneous case of a turbulent channel flow.\nThe inhomogeneity contributes to the cluster formation in addition to\nclustering in homogeneous turbulence. A space-dependent rate for the creation\nof inhomogeneous particle concentration is derived in terms of local statistics\nof turbulence. We provide the formula for the pair-correlation function of\nconcentration that factorizes in product of time and space-dependent average\nconcentrations and time-independent factor of clustering that obeys a power-law\nin the distance between the points. This power-law characterizes inhomogeneous\nmultifractality of the particle distribution. A unique demonstration and\nquantification of the combined effects of turbophoresis and fractal clustering\nin a direct numerical simulation of particle motion in a turbulent channel flow\nis performed according to the presented theory. The strongest contribution to\nclustering coming from the inhomogeneity of the flow occurs in the transitional\nregion between viscous sublayer and the buffer layer. Further the ratio of\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous term depends on the wall distance. The\ninhomogeneous terms may significantly increase the preferential concentration\nof inertial particles, thus the overall degree of clustering in inhomogeneous\nturbulence is potentially stronger compared to particles with the same inertia\nin purely homogeneous turbulence.\n", "  Recently, epitaxially connected at facets semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs)\nhave been introduced to fascilitate the electron transport between\nnanocrystals. To fully deploy their potential a better understanding of the\nexciton transfer between connected NCs is needed. We go beyond the two\nwell-known transfer mechanisms suggested by F\\\"orster and Dexter and propose a\nthird mechanism of exciton tandem tunneling. The tandem tunnelling occurs\nthrough the intermediate state in which electron and hole are in different NCs.\nThe corresponding rate for exciton hops is larger than the Dexter rate and for\nSi is even much larger that the F\\\"orster one.\n", "  We examine a two dimensional fluid system consisting of a lower medium\nbounded underneath by a flatbed and an upper medium with a free surface. The\ntwo media are separated by a free common interface. The gravity driven surface\nand internal water waves (at the common interface between the media) in the\npresence of a depth-dependent current are studied under certain physical\nassumptions. Both media are considered incompressible and with prescribed\nvorticities. Using the Hamiltonian approach the Hamiltonian of the system is\nconstructed in terms of 'wave' variables and the equations of motion are\ncalculated. The resultant equations of motion are then analysed to show that\nwave-current interaction is influenced only by the current profile in the\n'strips' adjacent to the surface and the interface. Small amplitude and\nlong-wave approximations are also presented.\n", "  In this paper, we study crucial elements of a complex network, namely its\nnodes and connections, which play a key role in maintaining the network's\nstructure and function under unexpected structural perturbations of nodes and\nedges removal. Specifically, we want to identify vital nodes and edges whose\nfailure (either random or intentional) will break the most number of connected\ntriples (or triangles) in the network. This problem is extremely important\nbecause connected triples form the foundation of strong connections in many\nreal-world systems, such as mutual relationships in social networks, reliable\ndata transmission in communication networks, and stable routing strategies in\nmobile networks. Disconnected triples, analog to broken mutual connections, can\ngreatly affect the network's structure and disrupt its normal function, which\ncan further lead to the corruption of the entire system. The analysis of such\ncrucial elements will shed light on key factors behind the resilience and\nrobustness of many complex systems in practice.\n  We formulate the analysis under multiple optimization problems and show their\nintractability. We next propose efficient approximation algorithms, namely\nDAK-n and DAK-e, which guarantee an $(1-1/e)$-approximate ratio (compared to\nthe overall optimal solutions) while having the same time complexity as the\nbest triangle counting and listing algorithm on power-law networks. This\nadvantage makes our algorithms scale extremely well even for very large\nnetworks. In an application perspective, we perform comprehensive experiments\non real social traces with millions of nodes and billions of edges. These\nempirical experiments indicate that our approaches achieve comparably better\nresults while are up to 100x faster than current state-of-the-art methods.\n", "  We investigate a graph probing problem in which an agent has only an\nincomplete view $G' \\subsetneq G$ of the network and wishes to explore the\nnetwork with least effort. In each step, the agent selects a node $u$ in $G'$\nto probe. After probing $u$, the agent gains the information about $u$ and its\nneighbors. All the neighbors of $u$ become \\emph{observed} and are\n\\emph{probable} in the subsequent steps (if they have not been probed). What is\nthe best probing strategy to maximize the number of nodes explored in $k$\nprobes? This problem serves as a fundamental component for other\ndecision-making problems in incomplete networks such as information harvesting\nin social networks, network crawling, network security, and viral marketing\nwith incomplete information.\n  While there are a few methods proposed for the problem, none can perform\nconsistently well across different network types. In this paper, we establish a\nstrong (in)approximability for the problem, proving that no algorithm can\nguarantees finite approximation ratio unless P=NP. On the bright side, we\ndesign learning frameworks to capture the best probing strategies for\nindividual network. Our extensive experiments suggest that our framework can\nlearn efficient probing strategies that \\emph{consistently} outperform previous\nheuristics and metric-based approaches.\n", "  We propose a one-shot mechanism for high-energy cosmic ray generation by a\nneutron star falling into a black hole surrounded by low density plasma. The\nfunction of the black hole in this scenario is to accelerate the star to a\nspeed arbitrarily close to that of light. When the star - essentially, a\nmagnetized sphere - approaches the horizon it imparts energy to the ambient\nplasma charges via the induced electric field. Disregarding radiation losses,\nfor iron nucleus, a simple estimate gives energies on the order of 10^19 eV for\nstars with magnetic fields as weak as 10^6 teslas. The proposed mechanism\nshould also work in chance encounters between rapidly moving neutron stars and\nmolecular clouds. The rarity of such encounters may explain the apparent\nrandomness and rarity of the high-energy cosmic ray events.\n", "  Tensor structure of the deuteron can be studied by deep inelastic scattering\nand Drell-Yan process to understand it in terms of quark and gluon degrees of\nfreedom. It probes interesting features in the deuteron including a D-wave\ncontribution. In the charged-lepton DIS, twist-two structure functions $b_1$\nand $b_2$ are expressed by tensor-polarized parton distribution functions\n(PDFs). We note that the HERMES experimental measurement of $b_1$ seems to be\nmuch different from a conventional theoretical prediction. This puzzling\nsituation should be significantly improved in the near future by an approved\nexperiment to measure $b_1$ at JLab. On the other hand, the tensor-polarized\nPDFs, especially antiquark distributions, could be measured by spin asymmetries\nin the Drell-Yan process with a tensor-polarized deuteron at Fermilab. In this\nwork, we estimate tensor-polarization asymmetries for the Fermilab Drell-Yan\nexperiment by using a parametrization for the tensor-polarized PDFs to explain\nthe HERMES $b_1$ data. Obtained spin asymmetries are typically a few percent\norder and they could be measured by the Fermilab-E1039 experiment. Since the\ntensor-polarized antiquark distributions will play an important role to solve\nthe puzzle, further theoretical and experimental efforts are needed toward the\nDrell-Yan experiment at Fermilab and other hadron facilities.\n", "  We present a modification to variational Monte Carlo's linear method\noptimization scheme that addresses a critical memory bottleneck while\nmaintaining compatibility with both the traditional ground state variational\nprinciple and our recently-introduced variational principle for excited states.\nFor wave function ansatzes with tens of thousands of variables, our\nmodification reduces the required memory per parallel process from tens of\ngigabytes to hundreds of megabytes, making the methodology a much better fit\nfor modern supercomputer architectures in which data communication and\nper-process memory consumption are primary concerns. We verify the efficacy of\nthe new optimization scheme in small molecule tests involving both the Hilbert\nspace Jastrow antisymmetric geminal power ansatz and real space multi-Slater\nJastrow expansions. Satisfied with its performance, we have added the optimizer\nto the QMCPACK software package, with which we demonstrate on a hydrogen ring a\nprototype approach for making systematically convergent, non-perturbative\npredictions of Mott-insulators' optical band gaps.\n", "  We calculate the vector and axial-vector current correlators in the\ncoordinate space and compare them with the experimental information obtained\nthrough the spectral functions of hadronic tau decays measured by ALEPH.\nLattice data are obtained with 2+1 Mobius domain-wall fermions at three lattice\nspacings 0.044, 0.055 and 0.080 fm and the continuum limit is taken. The\ncorrelators calculated on the lattice after extrapolating to the physical point\nagree with those converted from the ALEPH data.\n", "  We extract the charm quark mass and the strong coupling constant from the\ncharmonium current correlators calculated with $n_f = 2 + 1$ Mobius domain wall\nfermions. We match our lattice calculation for the temporal moments of the\ncorrelator with perturbative result known up to four-loop order, and extract\nthe charm quark mass with uncertainty less than 1%. Using the temporal moments,\nwe also confirm the correlators in the vector channel to be consistent with the\nexperimental data for the R-ratio. We used the ensembles generated by the JLQCD\ncollaboration at lattice spacings $a$ = 0.080 fm, 0.055 fm and 0.044 fm.\n", "  In this paper we survey the various implementations of a new data\nassimilation (downscaling) algorithm based on spatial coarse mesh measurements.\nAs a paradigm, we demonstrate the application of this algorithm to the 3D\nLeray-$\\alpha$ subgrid scale turbulence model. Most importantly, we use this\nparadigm to show that it is not always necessary that one has to collect coarse\nmesh measurements of all the state variables, that are involved in the\nunderlying evolutionary system, in order to recover the corresponding exact\nreference solution. Specifically, we show that in the case of the 3D\nLeray$-\\alpha$ model of turbulence the solutions of the algorithm, constructed\nusing only coarse mesh observations of any two components of the\nthree-dimensional velocity field, and without any information of the third\ncomponent, converge, at an exponential rate in time, to the corresponding exact\nreference solution of the 3D Leray$-\\alpha$ model. This study serves as an\naddendum to our recent work on abridged continuous data assimilation for the 2D\nNavier-Stokes equations. Notably, similar results have also been recently\nestablished for the 3D viscous Planetary Geostrophic circulation model in which\nwe show that coarse mesh measurements of the temperature alone are sufficient\nfor recovering, through our data assimilation algorithm, the full solution;\nviz. the three components of velocity vector field and the temperature.\nConsequently, this proves the Charney conjecture for the 3D Planetary\nGeostrophic model; namely, that the history of the large spatial scales of\ntemperature is sufficient for determining all the other quantities (state\nvariables) of the model.\n", "  The atomic-scale synthesis of artificial oxide heterostructures offers new\nopportunities to create novel states that do not occur in nature. The main\nchallenge related to synthesizing these structures is obtaining atomically\nsharp interfaces with designed termination sequences. Here, we demonstrate that\nthe oxygen pressure (PO2) during growth plays an important role in controlling\nthe interfacial terminations of SrRuO3/BaTiO3/SrRuO3 (SRO/BTO/SRO)\nferroelectric capacitors. The SRO/BTO/SRO heterostructures were grown by the\npulsed laser deposition (PLD) method. The top SRO/BTO interface grown at high\nPO2 (around 150 mTorr) usually exhibited a mixture of RuO2-BaO and SrO-TiO2\nterminations. By reducing PO2, we obtained atomically sharp SRO/BTO top\ninterfaces with uniform SrO-TiO2 termination. Using capacitor devices with\nsymmetric and uniform interfacial termination, we were able to demonstrate for\nthe first time that the ferroelectric (FE) critical thickness can reach the\ntheoretical limit of 3.5 unit cells (u.c.).\n", "  These lecture notes on entanglement in topological systems are part of the\n48th IFF Spring School 2017 on Topological Matter: Topological Insulators,\nSkyrmions and Majoranas at the Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany. They cover a\nshort discussion on topologically ordered phases and review the two main tools\navailable for detecting topological order - the entanglement entropy and the\nentanglement spectrum.\n", "  We explore the potential of bilayer graphene as a cryogenic microwave\nphotodetector by studying the microwave absorption in fully suspended clean\nbilayer graphene pn junctions in the frequency range of $1-5$ GHz at a\ntemperature of 8 K. We observe a distinct photocurrent signal if the device is\ngated into the pn regime, while there is almost no signal for unipolar doping\nin either the nn or pp regimes. Most surprisingly, the photocurrent strongly\npeaks when one side of the junction is gated to the Dirac point\n(charge-neutrality point CNP), while the other remains in a highly doped state.\nThis is different to previous results where optical radiation was used. We\npropose a new mechanism based on the phototermal effect explaining the large\nsignal. It requires contact doping and a distinctly different transport\nmechanism on both sides: one side of graphene is ballistic and the other\ndiffusive. By engineering partially diffusive and partially ballistic devices,\nthe photocurrent can drastically be enhanced.\n", "  The paper by Taroni et al. (2016) considers results of forward prediction of\nItalian strong earthquakes by CN algorithm with the declared intent of\nproviding \"a careful assessment of CN prediction performances... using standard\ntesting procedures\". Given the very limited number of target events within each\nregion, however, the considered situation is non statistical, and a priori it\nis clear that the standard statistical methods are not effective here. The\nattempt to replace the standard approaches by Pari-mutuel Gambling Score (PGS)\nmethod leads to almost complete loss of information about predicted\nearthquakes, even for a large sample of target events. Therefore, the\nconclusions based on PGS, are untenable.\n", "  The cross section of the $^{23}$Na($n, \\gamma$)$^{24}$Na reaction has been\nmeasured via the activation method at the Karlsruhe 3.7 MV Van de Graaff\naccelerator. NaCl samples were exposed to quasistellar neutron spectra at\n$kT=5.1$ and 25 keV produced via the $^{18}$O($p, n$)$^{18}$F and $^{7}$Li($p,\nn$)$^{7}$Be reactions, respectively. The derived capture cross sections\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle_{\\rm kT=5 keV}=9.1\\pm0.3$ mb and\n$\\langle\\sigma\\rangle_{\\rm kT=25 keV}=2.03 \\pm 0.05$ mb are significantly lower\nthan reported in literature. These results were used to substantially revise\nthe radiative width of the first $^{23}$Na resonance and to establish an\nimproved set of Maxwellian average cross sections. The implications of the\nlower capture cross section for current models of $s$-process nucleosynthesis\nare discussed.\n", "  Microsphere solid-state biolasers made of biomaterials-bovine serum albumin,\npectin and cellulose are demonstrated. The fabrication is simple, based on\nemulsion, and with green processing. A lasing threshold of 1 microJ/mm2 and Q\nfactor of 3000 are measured. The lasers are biocompatible, do not interfere\nwith cell growth and division.\n", "  A mathematical model describing the initial stage of the capture of\noscillatory systems into autoresonance under the action of slowly varying\npumping is considered. Solutions with an infinitely growing amplitude are\nassociated with the autoresonance phenomenon. Stability of such solutions is of\ngreat importance because only stable solutions correspond to physically\nobservable motions. We study the stabilizing problem and we show that the\nadiabatically varying parametric perturbation with decreasing amplitude in time\ncan stabilize the unstable autoresonant modes.\n", "  Quantum effect on the BB-mode correlation spectrum of Cosmic Microwave\nBackground for several inflation models is studied with the BICEP2/Keck Array\nand Planck joint data. The results do not rule out either single or multi field\nmodels of slow-roll inflation. The quantum effect is found more prominent for\nthe inflation models with larger values of tensor-to-scalar ratio and smaller\nvalues of tensor spectral index.\n", "  Electron pairing in the vast majority of superconductors follows the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity, which describes the\ncondensation of electrons into pairs with antiparallel spins in a singlet state\nwith an s-wave symmetry. Unconventional superconductivity is predicted in\nsingle layer graphene where the electrons pair with a p-wave or chiral d-wave\nsymmetry, depending on the position of the Fermi energy with respect to the\nDirac point. By placing single layer graphene on an electron-doped (non-chiral)\nd-wave superconductor and performing local scanning tunnelling microscopy and\nspectroscopy, here we show evidence for a p-wave triggered superconducting\ndensity of states in single layer graphene. The realization of unconventional\nsuperconductivity in single layer graphene offers an exciting new route for the\ndevelopment of p-wave superconductivity using two-dimensional materials with\ntransition temperatures above 4.2 K.\n", "  An interaction-driven nonzero quantum Hall conductivity is shown to occur in\ntime-reversal symmetric massive Dirac materials, in the absence of any external\nagent. The effect is produced through the dynamical breakdown of time-reversal\nsymmetry, which is generated by quantum fluctuations, when the full dynamical\nelectromagnetic interaction among the electrons is taken into account. The\nmanifestation of this emergent parity anomaly should be observed in materials\nsuch as silicene, stanene, germanene and transition metal dichalcogenides, at\nlow enough temperatures.\n", "  Epithelial tissues form physically integrated barriers against the external\nenvironment protecting organs from infection and invasion. Within each tissue,\nepithelial cells respond to different challenges that can potentially\ncompromise tissue integrity. In particular, cells collectively respond by\nreorganizing their cell-cell junctions and migrating directionally towards the\nsites of injury. Notwithstanding, the mechanisms that define the spatiotemporal\nscales and driving forces of these collective responses remain poorly\nunderstood. To address this we first analyzed the collective response of\nepithelial monolayers to injury and compare the results with different\ncomputational models of epithelial cells. We found that a model that integrates\nthe mechanics of cells at the cell-cell and cell-substrate interface as well as\ncontact inhibition of locomotion predicts two key properties of epithelial\nresponse to injury as: 1) local relaxation of the tissue and 2) collective\nresponses involving the elongation of cells (basal and apical regions) and\nextension of cryptic lamellipodia that extend up to < 3 cell diameters from the\nsite of injury. Our results therefore highlight the integration between\njunctional biomechanics, cell substrate adhesion and contact inhibition of\nlocomotion to guide the rapid collective rearrangements that are required to\npreserve the epithelial barrier in response to injury.\n", "  We revisit the evidence for a \"dust cloud\" observed by the Cassini spacecraft\nat Saturn in 2006. The data of four instruments are simultaneously compared to\ninterpret the signatures of a coherent swarm of dust that would have remained\nnear the equatorial plane for as long as six weeks. The conspicuous pattern, as\nseen in the dust counters of the Cosmic Dust Analyser (CDA), clearly repeats on\nthree consecutive revolutions of the spacecraft. That particular cloud is\nestimated to about 1.36 Saturnian radii in size, and probably broadening. We\nalso present a reconnection event from the magnetic field data (MAG) that leave\nbehind several plasmoids like those reported from the Voyager flybys in the\nearly 1980s. That magnetic bubbles happened at the dawn side of Saturn's\nmagnetosphere. At their nascency, the magnetic field showed a switchover of its\nalignment, disruption of flux tubes and a recovery on a time scale of about 30\ndays. However, we cannot rule out that different events might have taken place.\nEmpirical evidence is shown at another occasion when a plasmoid was carrying a\ncloud of tiny dust particles such that a connection between plasmoids and\ncoherent dust clouds is probable.\n", "  Using a sample of 215 supernovae (SNe), we analyse their positions relative\nto the spiral arms of their host galaxies, distinguishing grand-design (GD)\nspirals from non-GD (NGD) galaxies. Our results suggest that shocks in spiral\narms of GD galaxies trigger star formation in the leading edges of arms\naffecting the distributions of core-collapse (CC) SNe (known to have\nshort-lived progenitors). The closer locations of SNe Ibc vs. SNe II relative\nto the leading edges of the arms supports the belief that SNe Ibc have more\nmassive progenitors. SNe Ia having less massive and older progenitors, show\nsymmetric distribution with respect to the peaks of spiral arms.\n", "  A Fermi gas of cold atoms allows precise control over the dimensionless\neffective range, $k_\\mathrm{F} R_\\mathrm{eff}$, of the Feshbach resonance. Our\npseudopotential formalism allows us to create smooth potentials with effective\nrange, $-2 \\leq k_\\mathrm{F} R_\\mathrm{eff} \\leq 2$, which we use for a\nvariational and diffusion Monte Carlo study of the ground state of a unitary\nFermi gas. We report values for the universal constants of $\\xi = 0.388(1)$ and\n$\\zeta = 0.087(1)$, and compute the condensate fraction, momentum distribution,\nand pair correlations functions. Finally, we show that a gas with $k_\\mathrm{F}\nR_\\mathrm{eff} \\gtrsim 1.9$ is thermodynamically unstable.\n", "  In case of pre-main sequence objects, the only way to determine age and mass\nis by fitting theoretical isochrones on color-magnitude (alternatively\nluminosity-temperature) diagrams. Since young stellar objects exhibit\nphotometric variability over wide range in magnitude and colors, the age and\nmass determined by fitting isochrones is expected to be inaccurate, if not\nerroneous. These in turn will badly affect any study carried out on age spread\nand process of star formation. Since we have carried out very extensive\nphotometric observations of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), we decided to use\nour multi-band data to explore the influence of variability in determining mass\nand age of cluster members. In this study, we get the amplitudes of the\nphotometric variability in V, R, and I optical bands of a sample of 346 ONC\nmembers and use it to investigate how the variability affects the inferred\nmasses and ages and if it alone can take account for the age spread among the\nONC members reported by earlier studies. We find that members that show\nperiodic and smooth photometric rotational modulation have their masses and\nages unaffected by variability. On other hand, we found that members with\nperiodic but very scattered photometric rotational modulation and members with\nirregular variability have their masses and ages significantly affected.\nMoreover, using Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams we find that the observed I\nband photometric variability can take account of only a fraction (about 50%) of\nthe inferred age spread, whereas the V band photometric variability is large\nenough to mask any age spread.\n", "  The rheology of F-actin networks has attracted a great attention during the\nlast years. In order to gain a complete understanding of the rheological\nproperties of these novel materials, it is necessary the study in a large\ndeformations regime to alter their internal structure. In this sense, Schmoller\net al. 2010 showed that the reconstituted networks of F-actin crosslinked with\n$\\alpha$-actinin unexpectedly harden when they are subjected to a cyclical\nshear. This observation contradicts the expected Mullins effect observed in\nmost soft materials, such as rubber and living tissues, where a pronounced\nsoftening is observed when they are cyclically deformed.\n  We think that the key to understand this stunning effect is the gelation\nprocess. To define it, the most relevant constituents are the chemical\ncrosslinks -$\\alpha$-actinin-, the physical crosslinks -introduced by the\nentanglement of the semiflexible network- and the interaction between them. As\na consequence of this interaction, a pre-stressed network emerges and\nintroduces a feedback effect, where the pre-stress also regulates the adhesion\nenergy of the $\\alpha$-actinin, setting the structure in a metastable reference\nconfiguration. Therefore, the external loads and the evolvement of the trapped\nstress drive the microstructural changes during the cyclic loading protocol. In\nthis work, we propose a micromechanical model into the framework of nonlinear\ncontinuum mechanics. The mechanics of the F-actin filaments is modeled using\nthe wormlike chain model for semiflexible filaments and the gelation process is\nmodeled as mesoscale dynamics for the $\\alpha$-actinin and physical\ncrosslink.The model has been validated with reported experimental results.\n", "  Measurements in quantum mechanics can not only effectively freeze the state\nof the quantum system (the quantum Zeno effect) but also accelerate the time\nevolution of the system (the quantum anti-Zeno effect). In studies of the\nquantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects, a quantum state, usually an excited state\nof the system, is prepared repeatedly by projecting the quantum state onto the\ninitial state again and again. In this paper, we repeatedly prepare the initial\nquantum state in a different manner. Instead of only performing projective\nmeasurements, we allow unitary operations to be performed, on a very short\ntime-scale, after each measurement. We can then repeatedly prepare the initial\nquantum state by performing some projective measurement and thereafter, after\neach measurement, performing a suitable unitary operation to repeatedly end up\nwith the initial state. Our objective thereafter is to find the projective\nmeasurements that need to repeatedly performed such that we obtain the minimum\npossible effective decay rate of the quantum state. Consequently, the quantum\nstate is maximally protected from its environment. We find that these optimized\nprojective measurements keep on changing depending on the measurement time\ninterval. We explicitly find the projective measurements that need to be\nperformed, as well as the optimized effective decay rate, for a variety of\nsystem-environment models such as the population decay model, the pure\ndephasing model, the spin-boson model, and the large spin-boson model. We find\nthat there can be considerable differences between this optimized effective\ndecay rate and the usual decay rate obtained by repeatedly projecting onto the\ninitial state. In particular, the Zeno and anti-Zeno regimes can be\nconsiderably modified.\n", "  Calculations of the heat flux carried by plasma to the wall of a magnetic\nfusion machine often assume that power flows only along the field lines, but\nthis cannot be true in general. Instead, we treat the plasma as an anisotropic\nnon-linear thermally conducting medium. The model is physically relevant if\nparallel and cross-field transport are driven at least in part by temperature\ngradients, which means they are affected by the proximity of material surfaces.\nThe model generates a familiar asymmetrical power distribution on the divertor\ntarget, and divergent heat flux on sharp edges, as described previously. The\npower landing on a wall that is parallel to the field (identically zero in the\nconventional model) is a substantial fraction of that landing on the target.\nThe flux profile across the scrape-off layer (SOL) deviates strongly from an\nexponential, because the parallel heat conduction is very large near the\nseparatrix, giving a much steeper fall-off in that region. When a portion of\nthe wall protrudes into the SOL at a grazing angle, the power striking the\ninclined surface is several times the value derived by integrating the parallel\nheat flux calculated in the absence of the inclined surface. We have also\ncalculated the degree to which the shadowing effect of a first wall component\non other parts of the wall falls off with distance - something that cannot even\nbe estimated using the field-line following technique.\n", "  The $\\epsilon - p$ is calculated from lattice simulations of two dimensional\n${\\cal N}=(8,8)$ $SU(N)$ SYM to test the gauge gravity duality. We employ the\nSugino action with keeping two of sixteen supercharges exactly on the lattice.\nThe thermodynamics of this gauge theory is described by the black 1-branes at\nlow temperature. The internal energy density $\\epsilon$ and the pressure $p$\ncan be analytically estimated in the gravitational theory. The lattice results\nin $N=12$ show that $\\epsilon - p$ of the thermal SYM reproduces the prediction\nof the gravitational theory for the dimensionless temperature $T_{\\rm\neff}<0.4$. This clearly indicates that the duality is valid in this system.\n", "  The recent detections of microquasars at energies above a few hundred keV up\nto the TeV in one case has stimulated a strong interest and raised several\nquestions. How are the MeV, GeV, and even TeV emissions, produced? What are the\nemission processes and in-fine the physics and media at the origin of the broad\nband spectra? What is the content of these media, and how are they powered?\nThese sources are machines accelerating particles and matter to very high speed\nin collimated jets. While these are now known for more than twenty years\n(mainly with radio observations) and their behavior known to be tied to the\naccretion processes onto the compact object (studied via X-ray observations),\ntheir potential influence at high energy is just being recognized. In this\nreview I will present a selection of recent results obtained with XMM-Newton,\nINTEGRAL, Fermi on 4U 1630$-$40, Cygnus X-1, and V404 Cygni and will discuss\nthe possible interpretations of these results.\n", "  The peptides in biosystems are homochiral polymers of L-amino acids, but\nrazemisate slowly by an active isomerization kinetics. The chemical reactions\nin biosystems are, however, reversible and what racemisates the peptides at the\nwater activity in the biosystems can ensure homochirality at a smaller\nactivity. Here we show by a thermodynamics analysis and by comprehensive\nMolecular Dynamics simulations of models of peptides, that the isomerization\nkinetics racemisates the peptides at a high water activity in agreement with\nexperimental observations of aging of peptides , but enhances homochirality at\na smaller water activity. The hydrophobic core of the peptide in an enzyme can\nensure homochirality at a low water activity, and thus the establishment of\nhomochirality at the origin of life and ageing of peptides and dead of\nbiosystems might be strongly connected.\n", "  We have studied the effect of structural disorder on the de Haas van Alphen\n(dHvA) and Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations measured in\nsingle-crystal and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite samples at temperatures\ndown to 30 mK and at magnetic fields up to 14 T. The measurements were\nperformed on different samples characterized by means of x-ray diffraction,\ntransmission electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy techniques. Our\nresults reveal a correlation between the amplitude of quantum oscillations and\nthe surface roughness.\n", "  We explore the effect of noise on the ballistic graphene-based small\nJosephson junctions in the framework of the resistively and capacitively\nshunted model. We use the non-sinusoidal current-phase relation specific for\ngraphene layers partially covered by superconducting electrodes. The noise\ninduced escapes from the metastable states, when the external bias current is\nramped, give the switching current distribution, i.e. the probability\ndistribution of the passages to finite voltage from the superconducting state\nas a function of the bias current, that is the information more promptly\navailable in the experiments. We consider a noise source that is a mixture of\ntwo different types of processes: a Gaussian contribution to simulate an\nuncorrelated ordinary thermal bath, and non-Gaussian, $\\alpha$-stable (or\nL\\'evy) term, generally associated to non-equilibrium transport phenomena. We\nfind that the analysis of the switching current distribution makes it possible\nto efficiently detect a non-Gaussian noise component in a Gaussian background.\n", "  Many barred galaxies, possibly including the Milky Way, have cusps in the\ncentres. There is a widespread belief, however, that usual bar instability\ntaking place in bulgeless galaxy models is impossible for the cuspy models,\nbecause of the presence of the inner Lindblad resonance for any pattern speed.\nAt the same time there are numerical evidences that the bar instability can\nform a bar. We analyse this discrepancy, by accurate and diverse N-body\nsimulations and using the calculation of normal modes. We show that bar\nformation in cuspy galaxies can be explained by taking into account the disc\nthickness. The exponential growth time is moderate for typical current disc\nmasses (about 250 Myr), but considerably increases (factor 2 or more) upon\nsubstitution of the live halo and bulge with a rigid halo/bulge potential;\nmeanwhile pattern speeds remain almost the same. Normal mode analysis with\ndifferent disc mass favours a young bar hypothesis, according to which the bar\ninstability saturated only recently.\n", "  A Pilot unit of a closed loop gas (CLS) mixing and distribution system for\nthe INO project was designed and is being operated with (1.8 x 1.9) m^2 glass\nRPCs (Resistive Plate Chamber). The performance of an RPC depends on the\nquality and quantity of gas mixture being used, a number of studies on\ncontrolling the flow and optimization of the gas mixture is being carried out.\nIn this paper the effect of capillary as a dynamic impedance element on the\ndifferential pressure across RPC detector in a closed loop gas system is being\nhighlighted. The flow versus the pressure variation with different types of\ncapillaries and also with different types of gasses that are being used in an\nRPC is presented. An attempt is also made to measure the transient time of the\ngas flow through the capillary.\n", "  Cryogenic 22-pole ion traps have found many applications in ion-molecule\nreaction kinetics and in high resolution molecular spectroscopy. For most of\nthese applications it is important to know the translational and internal\ntemperatures of the trapped ions. Here, we present detailed rotational state\nthermometry measurements over an extended temperature range for the two\nion/buffer gas systems OH-/He and OD-/HD with ion-to-neutral mass ratios of\n4.25 and 6 respectively. The measured rotational temperatures show a\ntermination of the thermalisation with the buffer gas around 25K, independent\nof mass ratio and confinement potential of the trap. Different possible\nexplanations for this incomplete thermalisation have been investigated, among\nthem the thermalisation of the buffer gas and the heating due to room\ntemperature blackbody radiation and room temperature gas entering the trap.\n", "  Solar flares are driven by the release of magnetic energy from reconnection\nevents in the solar corona, whereafter energy is transported to the\nchromosphere, heating the plasma and causing the characteristic radiative\nlosses. In the collisional thick-target model, electrons accelerated to\nenergies exceeding 10 keV traverse the corona and impact the chromosphere,\nwhere they deposit their energy through collisions with the much denser plasma\nin the lower atmosphere. While there are undoubtedly high energy non-thermal\nelectrons accelerated in flares, it is unclear whether these electron beams are\nthe sole mechanism of energy transport, or whether they only dominate in\ncertain phases of the flare's evolution. Alfv\\'enic waves are generated during\nthe post-reconnection relaxation of magnetic field lines, so it is important to\nexamine their role in energy transport.\n", "  We derive an analytic behavior of the Casimir free energy, entropy and\npressure of metallic films in vacuum at low temperature. It is shown that this\nbehavior differs significantly depending on whether the plasma or the Drude\nmodel is used to describe the dielectric properties of film metal. For metallic\nfilms described by the lossless plasma model the thermal corrections to the\nCasimir energy and pressure drop to zero exponentially fast with increasing\nfilm thickness. There is no classical limit in this case. The Casimir entropy\nsatisfies the Nernst heat theorem. For metallic films with perfect crystal\nlattices described by the Drude model the Casimir entropy at zero temperature\ntakes a nonzero value depending on the parameters of a film, i.e., the Nernst\nheat theorem is violated. The Casimir entropy at zero temperature is positive,\nas opposed to the case of two metallic plates separated with a vacuum gap,\nwhere it is negative if the Drude model is used. Possible applications of the\nobtained results in investigations of stability of thin films are discussed.\n", "  Topological insulators (TI) have attracted extensive research effort due to\ntheir insulating bulk states but conducting surface states. However,\ninvestigation and understanding of thermal transport in topological insulators,\nparticularly the effect of surface states are lacking. In this work, we studied\nthickness-dependent in-plane thermal conductivity of Bi2Te2Se TI thin films. A\nlarge enhancement of both thermal and electrical conductivity was observed for\nfilms with thicknesses below 20 nm, which is attributed to the surface states\nand bulk-insulating nature of these films. Surprisingly, a surface Lorenz\nnumber of over 10 times the Sommerfeld value was found. Transport measurements\nindicated that the surface is near the charge neutrality point when the film\nthickness is below 20 nm. Possible reasons for the large Lorenz number include\nthe electrical and thermal current decoupling in the surface state Dirac fluid\nand the bipolar diffusion transport involving surface states.\n", "  Due to the exponential growth of the state space of coupled quantum systems\nit is not possible, in general, to numerically store the state of a very large\nnumber of quantum systems within a classical computer. We demonstrate a method\nfor modelling the dynamical behaviour of measurable quantities for very large\nnumbers of interacting quantum systems. Our approach makes use of a symbolic\nnon-commutative algebra engine that we have recently developed in conjunction\nwith the well-known Ehrenfest theorem. Here we show the possibility of\ndetermining the dynamics of experimentally observable quantities, without\napproximation, for very large numbers of interacting harmonic oscillators. Our\nanalysis removes a large number of significant constraints present in previous\nanalysis of this example system (such as having no entanglement in the initial\nstate). This method will be of value in simulating the operation of large\nquantum machines, emergent behaviour in quantum systems, open quantum systems\nand quantum chemistry to name but a few.\n", "  We previously remarked that when an observable A has a continuous spectrum,\nthen von Neumann's formula for the post-measurement state needs to be extended\nand the correct formula ineluctably involves the resolution of the detector\nused in the measurement. We generalize previous results to compute the\nuncertainties in successive measurements of more general pairs of observables.\nWe also show that this extended von Neumann's formula for the post-measurement\nstate is a completely positive map and, moreover, that there is a\ncompletely-positive interpolation between the pre- and post-measurement states.\nWeinberg has advocated that the time-evolution during the measurement process\nshould be modeled as an open quantum system and governed by a Lindblad\nequation. We verify that this is indeed the case for an arbitrary observable,\nA, and a fairly general class of interpolations.\n"]}
