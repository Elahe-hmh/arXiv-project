Neither phase control of the illuminating field nor phase\nmeasurements of the scattered field are necessary. The method is based on the\nsolution to the inverse scattering problem for a system consisting of a\nweakly-scattering dielectric sample and a strongly-scattering nano-particle\ntip. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the results.\n", "  The paper considers a linear system of Boltzmann transport equations\nmodelling the evolution of three species of particles, photons, electrons and\npositrons. The system is coupled because of the collision term (an integral\noperator). The model is intended especially for dose calculation (forward\nproblem) in radiation therapy. It, however, does not apply to all relevant\ninteractions in its present form. We show under physically relevant assumptions\nthat the system has a unique solution in appropriate ($L^1$-based) spaces and\nthat the solution is non-negative when the data (internal source and inflow\nboundary source) is non-negative. In order to be self-contained as much as is\npractically possible, many (basic) results and proofs have been reproduced in\nthe paper. Existence, uniqueness and non-negativity of solutions for the\nrelated time-dependent coupled system are also proven. Moreover, we deal with\ninverse radiation treatment planning problem (inverse problem) as an optimal\ncontrol problem both for external and internal therapy (in general\n$L^p$-spaces). Especially, in the case $p=2$ variational equations for an\noptimal control related to an appropriate differentiable convex object function\nare verified. Its solution can be used as an initial point for an actual\n(global) optimization.\n", "  With a detail microscopic model for a self-propelled swimmer, we derive the\nrheological properties of a dilute suspension of such particles at small Peclet\nnumbers. It is shown that, in addition to the Einstein's like contribution to\nthe effective viscosity, that is proportional to the volume fraction of the\nswimmers, a contribution due to the activity of self-propelled particles\ninfluences the viscosity. As a result of the activity of swimmers, the\neffective viscosity would be a lower (higher) than the viscosity of the\nsuspending medium when the particles are pushers (pullers). Such activity\ndependent contribution, will also results to a non-Newtonian behavior of the\nsuspension in the form of normal stress differences.\n", "  We examine the problem of snake-like locomotion by studying a system\nconsisting of a planar inextensible elastic rod that is able to control its\nspontaneous curvature. Using a Cosserat model we derive, through variational\nprinciples, the equations of motion for two special cases: one in which the\nsystem is confined inside a frictionless channel, and one in which it is placed\nin an anisotropic frictional environment, modeling the dynamical setting of the\nslithering of snakes on flat surfaces. The presence of constraints in both\ncases leads to non-standard boundary conditions, that allow us to close the\nequations of motion reducing them to a differential and an integro-differential\nequation, respectively, for one end point (the tail) of the active rod. For the\nsnake-like case we also provide analytic solutions for a special class of\nmotions. We highlight the role of the spontaneous curvature in the pushing (and\nthe steering, in the snake-like setting) needed to power locomotion.\nComparisons with available experiments confirm that the model is able to\ncapture many of the essential findings in the zoological literature. The\ncomplete solvability and the existence of analytic solutions offers a tool that\nmay prove valuable for the design of bio-inspired soft robots.\n", "  The surface code cannot be used when qubits vanish during computation;\ninstead, a variant known as the topological cluster state is necessary. It has\na gate error threshold of $0.75% and only requires nearest-neighbor\ninteractions on a 2D array of qubits. Previous work on loss tolerance using\nthis code only considered qubits vanishing during measurement. We begin by also\nincluding qubit loss during two-qubit gates and initialization, and then\nadditionally consider interaction errors that occur when neighbors attempt to\nentangle with a qubit that isn't there. In doing so, we show that even our best\ncase scenario requires a loss rate below 1% in order to avoid considerable\nspace-time overhead.\n", "  Bristle-bots are legged robots that can be easily made out of a toothbrush\nhead and a small vibrating engine. Despite their simple appearance, the\nmechanism enabling them to propel themselves by exploiting friction with the\nsubstrate is far from trivial. Numerical experiments on a model bristle-bot\nhave been able to reproduce such a mechanism revealing, in addition, the\nability to switch direction of motion by varying the vibration frequency. This\npaper provides a detailed account of these phenomena through a fully analytical\ntreatment of the model. The equations of motion are solved through an expansion\nin terms of a properly chosen small parameter. The convergence of the expansion\nis rigorously proven. In addition, the analysis delivers formulas for the\naverage velocity of the robot and for the frequency at which the direction\nswitch takes place. A quantitative description of the mechanism for the\nfriction modulation underlying the motility of the bristle-bot is also\nprovided.\n", "  The variational cluster approximation is used to study the frustrated Hubbard\nmodel at half filling defined on the two-dimensional square lattice with\nanisotropic next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters. We calculate the\nground-state phase diagrams of the model in a wide parameter space for a\nvariety of lattice geometries, including square, crossed-square, and triangular\nlattices. We examine the Mott metal-insulator transition and show that, in the\nMott insulating phase, magnetic phases with N\\'eel, collinear, and spiral\norders appear in relevant parameter regions, and in an intermediate region\nbetween these phases, a nonmagnetic insulating phase caused by the quantum\nfluctuations in the geometrically frustrated spin degrees of freedom emerges.\n", "  We introduce the concept of entanglement width as measure of the spatial\ndistribution of entanglement in multiparticle systems. We develop criteria to\ndetect the width of entanglement using global observables such as energy and\nmagnetic susceptibility. Therefore, the introduced entanglement criteria can be\napplied to systems where addressing of single particles is not possible. We\napply the criteria to different examples such as the J1-J2- Heisenberg model\nand point out the difference between entanglement depth and entanglement width.\n", "  Cavities play a fundamental role in wave phenomena from quantum mechanics to\nelectromagnetism and dictate the spatiotemporal physics of lasers. In general,\nthey are constructed by closing all \"doors\" through which waves can escape. We\nreport, at room temperature, a bound state in the continuum laser that\nharnesses optical modes residing in the radiation continuum but nonetheless may\npossess arbitrarily high quality factors. These counterintuitive cavities are\nbased on resonantly trapped symmetry-compatible modes that destructively\ninterfere. Our experimental demonstration opens exciting avenues towards\ncoherent sources with intriguing topological properties for optical trapping,\nbiological imaging, and quantum communication.\n", "  We study the average rate of change of energy for a static atom immersed in a\nthermal bath of electromagnetic radiation in the cosmic string spacetime and\nseparately calculate the contributions of thermal fluctuations and radiation\nreaction. We find that the transition rates are crucially dependent on the\natom-string distance and polarization of the atom and they in general oscillate\nas the atom-string distance varies. Moreover, the atomic transition rates in\nthe cosmic string spacetime can be larger or smaller than those in Minkowski\nspacetime contingent upon the atomic polarization and position. In particular,\nwhen located on the string, ground-state atoms can make a transition to excited\nstates only if they are polarizable parallel to the string, whereas ground\nstate atoms polarizable only perpendicular to the string are stable as if they\nwere in a vacuum, even if they are immersed in a thermal bath. Our results\nsuggest that the influence of a cosmic string is very similar to that of a\nreflecting boundary in Minkowski spacetime.\n", "  We study the generating functional, the adiabatic curvature and the adiabatic\nphase for the integer quantum Hall effect (QHE) on a compact Riemann surface.\nFor the generating functional we derive its asymptotic expansion for the large\nflux of the magnetic field, i.e., for the large degree $k$ of the positive\nHermitian line bundle $L^k$. The expansion consists of the anomalous and exact\nterms. The anomalous terms are the leading terms of the expansion. This part is\nresponsible for the quantization of the adiabatic transport coefficients in\nQHE. We then identify the non-local (anomalous) part of the expansion with the\nQuillen metric on the determinant line bundle, and the subleading exact part\nwith the asymptotics of the regularized spectral determinant of the Laplacian\nfor the line bundle $L^k$, at large $k$. Finally, we show how the generating\nfunctional of the integer QHE is related to the gauge and gravitational (2+1)d\nChern-Simons functionals. We observe the relation between the\nBismut-Gillet-Soul\\'e curvature formula for the Quillen metric and the\nadiabatic curvature for the electromagnetic and geometric adiabatic transport\nof the integer Quantum Hall state. Then we relate the adiabatic phase in QHE to\nthe eta invariant and show that the geometric part of the adiabatic phase is\ngiven by the Chern-Simons functional.\n", "  We study from a statistical physics perspective the dynamics of a bouncing\nball maintained in a chaotic regime thanks to collisions with a plate\nexperiencing an aperiodic vibration. We analyze in details the energy exchanges\nbetween the bead and the vibrating plate, and show that the coupling between\nthe bead and the plate can be modeled in terms of both a dissipative process\nand an injection mechanism by an energy reservoir, where the dynamics of the\nreservoir obeys only a 'blurred' version of detailed balance. An analysis of\nthe injection statistics in terms of fluctuation relation is also provided.\n", "  The first part of a set of notes based on lectures given at the IHES in May\n2015 on Feynman amplitudes and motivic periods.\n", "  We derive an effective time independent Hamiltonian for the transverse Ising\nmodel coupled to a spin bath, in the presence of a high frequency AC magnetic\nfield. We show that the spin blocking mechanism that removes the quantum phase\ntransition can be suppressed by the AC field, allowing high tunability of the\nquantum critical point. Finally, we calculate the phase diagram within the RPA\napproximation for the case of spin $7/2$ nuclei, appropriate to the\n$LiHo_{x}Y_{1-x}F_{4}$ system.\n", "  In this paper the theory is developed for creating a material in which the\nheat is transmitted along a given line. This gives a possibility to transfer\ninformation using heat signals. This seems to be a novel idea. The technical\npart of the theory is the construction of the potential $q(x)$. This potential\ndescribes the heat equation $u_t = \\Delta u - q(x)u$ in the limiting medium\nwhich is obtained after the small impedance particles are distributed in a\ngiven domain. A numerical method is also established to construct numerically\nsuch a potential.\n", "  Inhomogeneous polymers play an important role in various cellular processes,\nboth in nature and in biotechnological applications. At finite temperatures,\ninhomogeneous polymers exhibit non-trivial thermal fluctuations. In a broader\ncontext, these are relatively simple examples for fluctuations in spatially\ninhomogeneous systems, which are less understood compared to their homogeneous\ncounterparts. We develop a statistical theory of torsional, extensional and\nbending Gaussian fluctuations of inhomogeneous polymers, where the\ninhomogeneity is an inclusion of variable size and mechanical properties, using\nboth continuum and discrete approaches. First, we analytically calculate the\ncomplete eigenvalue and eigenmode spectrum of the inhomogeneous polymer within\na continuum field theory. In particular, we show that the wavenumber inside and\noutside of the inclusion is nearly linear in the eigenvalue index, with a\nnontrivial coefficient. Second, we solve the corresponding discrete problem,\nand highlight fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete\nspectra. In particular, we demonstrate that above a certain wavenumber the\ndiscrete spectrum changes qualitatively and discrete evanescent eigenmodes,\nthat do not have continuum counterparts, emerge. The statistical thermodynamic\nimplications of these differences are then explored by calculating\nfluctuation-induced forces associated with free-energy variations with either\nthe inclusion properties (e.g.~inhomogeneity formed by adsorbing molecules) or\nwith an external geometric constraint. The former, which is the\nfluctuation-induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force, is\nshown to be affected by short wavelengths and thus cannot be calculated using\nthe continuum approach. The latter, on the other hand, is shown to be dominated\nby long wavelength shape fluctuations and hence is properly described by the\ncontinuum theory.\n", "  Inflation models are numerous. It is extremely difficult, if possible at all,\nto identify the actual underlying inflation model of our primordial universe.\nThus, for the purpose of proving/falsifying inflation and using inflation to\nprobe new physics, model independent approaches are crucial. Massive fields\nplay a uniquely important role in those missions. This short review is based on\na talk by one of the authors (YW) in the 2nd LeCosPA Symposium.\n", "  In this study, we explore the validity of the original Heisenberg position-\nmomentum uncertainty relation for a macroscopic harmonic oscillator interacting\nwith environmental micro particles. Our results show that, in the\nquasi-classical situation, the original uncertainty relation does not hold when\nthe number of particles in the environment is small. Nonetheless, increasing\nthe environmental degrees of freedom resolves the violation in the region of\nour investigation.\n", "  In this paper I show that light-atom interaction can be described using\npurely classical field theory without any quantization. In particular, atom\nexcitation by light that accounts for damping due to spontaneous emission is\nfully described in the framework of classical field theory. I show that three\nwell-known laws of the photoelectric effect can also be derived and that all of\nits basic properties can be described within classical field theory.\n", "  In the context of class S theories and 4D/2D duality relations there, we\ndiscuss the skein relations of general topological defects on the 2D side which\nare expected to be counterparts of composite surface-line operators in 4D class\nS theory. Such defects are geometrically interpreted as networks in a three\ndimensional space. We also propose a conjectural computational procedure for\nsuch defects in two dimensional SU(N) topological q-deformed Yang-Mills theory\nby interpreting it as a statistical mechanical system associated with ideal\ntriangulations.\n", "  We study two microswimmers consisting of a spherical rigid head and a passive\nelastic tail. In the first one the tail is clamped to the head, and the system\noscillates under the action of an external torque. In the second one, head and\ntail are connected by a joint allowing the angle between them to vary\nperiodically, as a result of an oscillating internal torque. Previous studies\non these models were restricted to sinusoidal actuations, showing that the\nswimmers can propel while moving on average along a straight line, in the\ndirection given by the symmetry axis around which beating takes place. We\nextend these results to motions produced by generic (non-sinusoidal) periodic\nactuations within the regime of small compliance of the tail. We find that\nmodulation in the velocity of actuation can provide a mechanism to select\ndifferent directions of motion. With velocity modulated inputs the externally\nactuated swimmer can translate laterally with respect to the symmetry axis of\nbeating, while the internally actuated one is able to move along curved\ntrajectories. The governing equations are analysed with an asymptotic\nperturbation scheme, providing explicit formulas whose results are expressed\nthrough motility maps. Asymptotic approximations are further validated by\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We investigate the interaction caused by quantum gravitational vacuum\nfluctuations between a gravitationally polarizable object and a gravitational\nboundary, and find a position-dependent energy shift of the object, which\ninduces a force in close analogy to the Casimir-Polder force in the\nelectromagnetic case. For a Dirichlet boundary, the explicit form of the\nquantum gravitational potential for the polarizable object in its ground-state\nis worked out and is found to behave like $z^{-5}$ in the near regime, and\n$z^{-6}$ in the far regime, where $z$ is the distance to the boundary. Taking a\nBose-Einstein condensate as a gravitationally polarizable object, we find that\nthe relative correction to the radius caused by fluctuating quantum\ngravitational waves in vacuum is of order $10^{-21}$. Although far too small to\nobserve in comparison with its electromagnetic counterpart, it is nevertheless\nof the order of the gravitational strain caused by a recently detected black\nhole merger on the arms of the LIGO.\n", "  Quantum amplifier channels are at the core of several physical processes. Not\nonly do they model the optical process of spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion, but the transformation corresponding to an amplifier channel\nalso describes the physics of the dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting\ncircuits, the Unruh effect, and Hawking radiation. Here we study the\ncommunication capabilities of quantum amplifier channels. Invoking a recently\nestablished minimum output-entropy theorem for single-mode phase-insensitive\nGaussian channels, we determine capacities of quantum-limited amplifier\nchannels in three different scenarios. First, we establish the capacities of\nquantum-limited amplifier channels for one of the most general communication\ntasks, characterized by the trade-off between classical communication, quantum\ncommunication, and entanglement generation or consumption. Second, we establish\ncapacities of quantum-limited amplifier channels for the trade-off between\npublic classical communication, private classical communication, and secret key\ngeneration. Third, we determine the capacity region for a broadcast channel\ninduced by the quantum-limited amplifier channel, and we also show that a fully\nquantum strategy outperforms those achieved by classical coherent detection\nstrategies. In all three scenarios, we find that the capacities significantly\noutperform communication rates achieved with a naive time-sharing strategy.\n", "  Based on a special variant of plaquette expansion, an operator is constructed\nwhose eigenvalues give the low-energy singlet spectrum of spin-$\\frac12$\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet on square lattice with nearest- and frustrating\nnext-nearest-neighbor exchange couplings $J_1$ and $J_2$. It is well known that\na non-magnetic phase arises in this model at $0.4\\lesssim J_2/J_1\\lesssim 0.6$\nsandwiched by two N\\'eel ordered phases. In agreement with previous results, we\nobserve a first-order quantum phase transition (QPT) at $J_2\\approx 0.64J_1$\nfrom the non-magnetic phase to the N\\'eel one. Large gap ($\\gtrsim0.4J_1$) is\nfound in the singlet spectrum at $J_2<0.64J_1$ that excludes a gapless\nspin-liquid state at $0.4\\lesssim J_2/J_1\\lesssim 0.6$ and the deconfined\nquantum criticality scenario for the QPT to another N\\'eel phase. We observe a\nfirst-order QPT at $J_2\\approx 0.55J_1$ presumably between two non-magnetic\nphases.\n", "  We employ time sequences of images observed with a G-band filter (4305{\\AA})\nby the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board of Hinode spacecraft at different\nlatitude along solar central me-ridian to study vorticity of granular flows in\nquiet Sun areas during deep minimum of solar activity. Using a feature\ncorrelation tracking (FCT) technique, we calculate the vorticity of\ngranular-scale flows. Assuming the known pattern of vertical flows (upward in\ngranules and downward in inter-granular lanes), we infer the sign of kinetic\nhelicity of these flows. We show that the kinetic helicity of granular flows\nand intergranular vortices exhibits a weak hemispheric preference, which is in\nagreement with the action of the Coriolis force. This slight hemispheric sign\nasymmetry, however, is not statistically significant given large scatter in the\naverage vorticity. The sign of the current he-licity density of network\nmagnetic fields computed using full disk vector magnetograms from the Synoptic\nOptical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) does not show any\nhemispheric preference. The combination of these two findings suggests that the\nphotospheric dynamo operating on the scale of granular flows is non-helical in\nnature.\n", "  We discuss some open problems in a program of constructing and studying\ntwo-dimensional conformal field theories using the representation theory of\nvertex operator algebras.\n", "  An electron localization measure was originally introduced to characterize\nchemical bond structures in molecules. Recently, a nucleon localization based\non Hartree-Fock densities has been introduced to investigate $\\alpha$-cluster\nstructures in light nuclei. Compared to the local nucleonic densities, the\nnucleon localization function has been shown to be an excellent indicator of\nshell effects and cluster correlations. Using the spatial nucleon localization\nmeasure, we investigate the emergence of fragments in fissioning heavy nuclei.\nTo illustrate basic concepts of nucleon localization, we employ the\nself-consistent energy density functional method with a quantified energy\ndensity functional optimized for fission studies. We study the particle\ndensities and spatial nucleon localization distributions along the fission\npathways of $^{264}$Fm, $^{232}$Th and $^{240}$Pu. We demonstrate that the\nfission fragments are formed fairly early in the evolution, well before\nscission. We illustrate the usefulness of the localization measure by showing\nhow the hyperdeformed state of $^{232}$Th can be understood in terms of a\nquasimolecular state made of $^{132}$Sn and $^{100}$Zr fragments. Compared to\nnucleonic distributions, the nucleon localization function more effectively\nquantifies nucleonic clustering: its characteristic oscillating pattern, traced\nback to shell effects, is a clear fingerprint of cluster/fragment\nconfigurations. This is of particular interest for studies of fragment\nformation and fragment identification in fissioning nuclei.\n", "  Non-equilibrium phase transitions exist in damped-driven open quantum\nsystems, when the continuous tuning of an external parameter leads to a\ntransition between two robust steady states. In second-order transitions this\nchange is abrupt at a critical point, whereas in first-order transitions the\ntwo phases can co-exist in a critical hysteresis domain. Here we report the\nobservation of a first-order dissipative quantum phase transition in a driven\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system. It takes place when the photon\nblockade of the driven cavity-atom system is broken by increasing the drive\npower. The observed experimental signature is a bimodal phase space\ndistribution with varying weights controlled by the drive strength. Our\nmeasurements show an improved stabilization of the classical attractors up to\nthe milli-second range when the size of the quantum system is increased from\none to three artificial atoms. The formation of such robust pointer states\ncould be used for new quantum measurement schemes or to investigate\nmulti-photon quantum many-body phases.\n", "  The complete spectrum of $c\\bar{b}$ states is obtained in a phenomenological\nnon relativistic quark model(NRQM), which consists of a confinement potential\nand one gluon exchange potential (OGEP) as effective quark - antiquark\npotential. We make predictions for the radiative decay (E1 and M1) widths and\nweak decay widths of $c\\bar{b}$ states in the framework of NRQM formalism.\n", "  A role of the unstable nuclei ${}^{6}$Be, ${}^{8}$Be and ${}^{9}$B in the\ndissociation of relativistic nuclei ${}^{7,9}$Be, ${}^{10}$B and ${}^{10,11}$C\nis under study on the basis of nuclear track emulsion exposed to secondary\nbeams of the JINR Nuclotron. Contribution of the configuration ${}^{6}$Be +\n$\\mit{n}$ to the ${}^{7}$Be nucleus structure is 8 $\\pm$ 1% which is near the\nvalue for the configuration ${}^{6}$Li + $\\mit{p}$. Distributions over the\nopening angle of $\\alpha$-particle pairs indicate to a simultaneous presence of\nvirtual ${}^{8}$Be$_{g.s.}$ and ${}^{8}$Be$_{2^+}$ states in the ground states\nof the ${}^{9}$Be and ${}^{10}$C nuclei. The core ${}^{9}$B is manifested in\nthe {${}^{10}$C} nucleus with a probability of 30 $\\pm$ 4%. Selection of the\n${}^{10}$C \"white\" stars accompanied by ${}^{8}$Be$_{g.s.}$ (${}^{9}$B) leads\nto appearance in the excitation energy distribution of 2$\\alpha$2$\\mit{p}$\n\"quartets\" of the distinct peak with a maximum at 4.1 $\\pm$ 0.3 MeV.\n${}^{8}$Be$_{g.s.}$ decays are presented in 24 $\\pm$ 7% of 2He + 2H events of\nthe ${}^{11}$C coherent dissociation and 27 $\\pm$ 11% of the 3He ones.

A\nprobability ratio of the mirror channels ${}^{9}$B + $\\mit{n}$ and ${}^{9}$Be +\n$\\mit{p}$ is estimated to be 6 $\\pm$ 1.\n", "  The magnetic order in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials is hard to control\nwith external magnetic fields. However, recent advances in detecting and\nmanipulating AF order electrically have opened up new prospects for these\nmaterials in basic and applied spintronics research. Using x-ray magnetic\nlinear dichroism microscopy, we show here that staggered effective fields\ngenerated by electrical current can induce reproducible and reversible\nmodification of the antiferromagnetic domain structure in microdevices\nfabricated from a tetragonal CuMnAs thin film. The current-induced domain\nswitching is inhomogeneous at the submicron level. A clear correlation between\nthe average domain orientation and the anisotropy of the electrical resistance\nis demonstrated.\n", "  We study the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term as the leading higher-curvature\ncorrection to pure Einstein gravity. Assuming a tree-level ultraviolet\ncompletion free of ghosts or tachyons, we prove that the GB term has a\nnonnegative coefficient in dimensions greater than four. Our result follows\nfrom unitarity of the spectral representation for a general ultraviolet\ncompletion of the GB term.\n", "  A very approximate second integral of motion of the Dicke model is identified\nwithin a broad region above the ground state, and for a wide range of values of\nthe external parameters. This second integral, obtained from a Born Oppenheimer\napproximation, classifies the whole regular part of the spectrum in bands\nlabelled by its corresponding eigenvalues. Results obtained from this\napproximation are compared with exact numerical diagonalization for finite\nsystems in the superradiant phase, obtaining a remarkable accord. The region of\nvalidity of our approach in the parameter space, which includes the resonant\ncase, is unveiled. The energy range of validity goes from the ground state up\nto a certain upper energy where chaos sets in, and extends far beyond the range\nof applicability of a simple harmonic approximation around the minimal energy\nconfiguration. The upper energy validity limit increases for larger values of\nthe coupling constant and the ratio between the level splitting and the\nfrequency of the field. These results show that the Dicke model behaves like a\ntwo-degree of freedom integrable model for a wide range of energies and values\nof the external parameters.\n", "  Let $H_0 = -\\Delta + V_0(x)$ be a Schroedinger operator on\n$L_2(\\mathbb{R}^\\nu),$ $\\nu=1,2,$ or 3, where $V_0(x)$ is a bounded measurable\nreal-valued function on $\\mathbb{R}^\\nu.$ Let $V$ be an operator of\nmultiplication by a bounded integrable real-valued function $V(x)$ and put $H_r\n= H_0+rV$ for real $r.$ We show that the associated spectral shift function\n(SSF) $\\xi$ admits a natural decomposition into the sum of absolutely\ncontinuous $\\xi^{(a)}$ and singular $\\xi^{(s)}$ SSFs. This is a special case of\nan analogous result for resolvent comparable pairs of self-adjoint operators,\nwhich generalises the known case of a trace class perturbation while also\nsimplifying its proof. We present two proofs -- one short and one long -- which\nwe consider to have value of their own. The long proof along the way reframes\nsome classical results from the perturbation theory of self-adjoint operators,\nincluding the existence and completeness of the wave operators and the\nBirman-Krein formula relating the scattering matrix and the SSF. The two proofs\ndemonstrate the equality of the singular SSF with two a priori different but\nintrinsically integer-valued functions: the total resonance index and the\nsingular $\\mu$-invariant.\n", "  Previous realizations of synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms do not\nallow the spatial profile of the field to evolve freely. We propose a scheme\nwhich overcomes this restriction by using the light in a multimode cavity, in\nconjunction with Raman coupling, to realize an artificial magnetic field which\nacts on a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutral atoms. We describe the evolution\nof such a system, and present the results of numerical simulations which show\ndynamical coupling between the effective field and the matter on which it acts.\nCrucially, the freedom of the spatial profile of the field is sufficient to\nrealize a close analogue of the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is\nexpelled from the superfluid. This back-action of the atoms on the synthetic\nfield distinguishes the Meissner-like effect described here from the\nHess-Fairbank suppression of rotation in a neutral superfluid observed\nelsewhere.\n", "  In this study, we present analytical solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation\nwith the Multiparameter potential containing the different types of physical\npotential via the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) by applying a Pekeris-type\napproximation to the centrifugal potential. For any n and l (states) quantum\nnumbers, we get the bound state energy eigenvalues numerically and the\ncorresponding eigenfunctions.Furthermore, we compare our results with the ones\nobtained in previous works and it is seen that our numerical results are in\ngood agreement with the literature.\n", "  By analyzing the dissipative dynamics of a tunable gap flux qubit, we extract\nboth sides of its two-sided environmental flux noise spectral density over a\nrange of frequencies around $2k_BT/h \\approx 1\\,\\rm{GHz}$, allowing for the\nobservation of a classical-quantum crossover. Below the crossover point, the\nsymmetric noise component follows a $1/f$ power law that matches the magnitude\nof the $1/f$ noise near $1\\,{\\rm{Hz}}$. The antisymmetric component displays a\n1/T dependence below $100\\,\\rm{mK}$, providing dynamical evidence for a\nparamagnetic environment. Extrapolating the two-sided spectrum predicts the\nlinewidth and reorganization energy of incoherent resonant tunneling between\nflux qubit wells.\n", "  One aim of cosmic ray measurements is the search for possible signatures of\nannihilating or decaying dark matter. The so-called positron excess has\nattracted a lot of attention in this context. On the other hand it has been\nproposed that the data might challenge the established diffusion model for\ncosmic ray propagation. We investigate an inhomogeneous diffusion model by\nsolving the corresponding equations analytically. Depending on the propagation\nparameters we find that the spectral features of the positron spectrum are\naffected significantly. We also discuss the influence of the inhomogeneity on\nhadronic spectra.\n", "  Exceptional points (EPs) are degeneracies in open wave systems where at least\ntwo energy levels and their corresponding eigenstates coalesce. We report\nevidence of the existence of EPs in 3D plasmonic nanostructures. The systems\nare composed of coupled plasmonic nanoresonators and can be judiciously and\nsystematically driven to EPs by controlling symmetry-compatible modes via their\nnear-field and far-field interactions. The proposed platform opens the way to\nthe investigation of EPs for enhanced light-matter interactions and\napplications in communication, sensing and imaging.\n", "  The open source ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations)\nproject provides a collection of physics libraries and applications, with a\nfocus on simulations of lattice models and strongly correlated systems. The\nlibraries provide a convenient set of well-documented and reusable components\nfor developing condensed matter physics simulation code, and the applications\nstrive to make commonly used and proven computational algorithms available to a\nnon-expert community. In this paper we present an updated and refactored\nversion of the core ALPS libraries geared at the computational physics software\ndevelopment community, rewritten with focus on documentation, ease of\ninstallation, and software maintainability.\n", "  Dark matter simulations can serve as a basis for creating galaxy histories\nvia the galaxy-dark matter connection. Here, one such model by Becker (2015) is\nimplemented with several variations on three different dark matter simulations.\nStellar mass and star formation rates are assigned to all simulation subhalos\nat all times, using subhalo mass gain to determine stellar mass gain. The\nobservational properties of the resulting galaxy distributions are compared to\neach other and observations for a range of redshifts from 0-2. Although many of\nthe galaxy distributions seem reasonable, there are noticeable differences as\nsimulations, subhalo mass gain definitions, or subhalo mass definitions are\naltered, suggesting that the model should change as these properties are\nvaried. Agreement with observations may improve by including redshift\ndependence in the added-by-hand random contribution to star formation rate.\nThere appears to be an excess of faint quiescent galaxies as well (perhaps due\nin part to differing definitions of quiescence). The ensemble of galaxy\nformation histories for these models tend to have more scatter around their\naverage histories (for a fixed final stellar mass) than the two more predictive\nand elaborate semi-analytic models of Guo et al (2013) and Henriques et al\n(2015), and require more basis fluctuations (using PCA) to capture 90 percent\nof the scatter around their average histories.\n  The codes to plot model predictions (in some cases alongside observational\ndata) are publicly available to test other mock catalogues at\nhttps://github.com/jdcphysics/validation . Information on how to use these\ncodes is in the appendix.\n", "  It is shown that Cooper pairs are a solution of the bipolaron problem for\nmodel Fr\\\"{o}hlich Hamiltonian. The total energy of a pair for the initial\nFr\\\"{o}hlich Hamiltonian is found. Differences between the solutions for the\nmodel and initial two-particle problems are discussed.\n", "  Particle production via parametric resonance in the early Universe, is a\nnonperturbative, non-linear and out-of-equilibrium phenomenon. Although it is a\nwell studied topic, whenever a new scenario exhibits parametric resonance, a\nfull re-analysis is normally required. To avoid this tedious task, many works\npresent often only a simplified linear treatment of the problem. In order to\nsurpass this circumstance in the future, we provide a fitting analysis of\nparametric resonance through all its relevant stages: initial linear growth,\nnon-linear evolution, and relaxation towards equilibrium. Using lattice\nsimulations in an expanding grid in 3 + 1 dimensions, we parametrize the\ndynamics outcome scanning over the relevant ingredients: role of the\noscillatory field, particle coupling strength, initial conditions, and\nbackground expansion rate. We emphasize the inaccuracy of the linear\ncalculation of the decay time of the oscillatory field, and propose a more\nappropriate definition of this scale based on the subsequent non-linear\ndynamics. We provide simple fits to the relevant time scales and particle\nenergy fractions at each stage. Our fits can be applied to post-inflationary\npreheating scenarios, where the oscillatory field is the inflaton, or to\nspectator-field scenarios, where the oscillatory field can be e.g. a curvaton,\nor the Standard Model Higgs.\n", "  The low-frequency dynamical response of an Anderson insulator is dominated by\nso-called Mott resonances: hybridization of pairs of states close in energy,\nbut separated spatially. We study the effect of interaction on Mott resonances\nin the model of spinful fermions (electrons) with local attraction. This model\nis known to exhibit a so-called pseudogap: a suppression of the low-energy\nsingle-particle excitations. Correspondingly, the low-energy dynamical response\nis also reduced. However this reduction has mostly quantitative character. In\nparticular, the Mott formula for frequency-dependent conductivity preserves its\nfunctional asymptotic behavior at low frequencies, but with a small numerical\nprefactor. This result can be explained in terms of Mott resonances for\nelectron pairs instead of single electrons.\n", "  It is shown that the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian is exactly solvable\nwhen the quantum number of the total angular momentum of the system is an\ninteger after the Jordan-Schwinger (differential) boson realization of the\nSU(2) algebra. Algebraic Bethe ansatz is used to get the exact solution with\nthe help of the SU(1,1) algebraic structure, from which a set of Bethe ansatz\nequations of the problem is derived. It is shown that solutions of the Bethe\nansatz equations can be obtained as zeros of the Heine-Stieltjes polynomials.\nThe total number of the four sets of the zeros equals exactly to $2J+1$ for a\ngiven integer angular momentum quantum number $J$, which proves the\ncompleteness of the solutions. It is also shown that double degeneracy in level\nenergies may also occur in the $J\\rightarrow\\infty$ limit for integer $J$ case\nexcept a unique non-degenerate level with zero excitation energy.\n", "  A new method for optimal sensor placement based on variable importance of\nmachine learned models is proposed. With its simplicity, adaptivity, and low\ncomputational cost, the method offers many advantages over existing approaches.\nThe new method is implemented on the flow over an airfoil equipped with a\nCoanda actuator. The analysis is based on flow field data obtained from 2D\nunsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations with different\nactuation conditions. The optimal sensor locations is compared against the\ncurrent de-facto standard of maximum POD modal amplitude location, and against\na brute force approach that scans all possible sensor combinations. The results\nshow that both the flow conditions and the type of sensor have an effect on the\noptimal sensor placement, whereas the choice of the response function appears\nto have limited influence.\n", "  Linear particle transport in stochastic media is key to such relevant\napplications as neutron diffusion in randomly mixed immiscible materials, light\npropagation through engineered optical materials, and inertial confinement\nfusion, only to name a few. We extend the pioneering work by Adams, Larsen and\nPomraning \\cite{benchmark_adams} (recently revisited by Brantley\n\\cite{brantley_benchmark}) by considering a series of benchmark configurations\nfor mono-energetic and isotropic transport through Markov binary mixtures in\ndimension $d$. The stochastic media are generated by resorting to Poisson\nrandom tessellations in $1d$ slab, $2d$ extruded, and full $3d$ geometry. For\neach realization, particle transport is performed by resorting to the Monte\nCarlo simulation. The distributions of the transmission and reflection\ncoefficients on the free surfaces of the geometry are subsequently estimated,\nand the average values over the ensemble of realizations are computed.\nReference solutions for the benchmark have never been provided before for two-\nand three-dimensional Poisson tessellations, and the results presented in this\npaper might thus be useful in order to validate fast but approximated models\nfor particle transport in Markov stochastic media, such as the celebrated Chord\nLength Sampling algorithm.\n", "  The Stratton-Chu integral representation of electromagnetic fields is used to\nstudy the spatio-temporal properties of large bandwidth laser pulses focused by\nhigh numerical aperture mirrors. We review the formal aspects of the derivation\nof diffraction integrals from the Stratton-Chu representation and discuss the\nuse of the Hadamard finite part in the derivation of the physical optics\napproximation. By analyzing the formulation we show that, for the specific case\nof a parabolic mirror, the integrands involved in the description of the\nreflected field near the focal spot do not possess the strong oscillations\ncharacteristic of diffraction integrals. Consequently, the integrals can be\nevaluated with simple and efficient quadrature methods rather than with\nspecialized, more costly approaches. We report on the development of an\nefficiently parallelized algorithm that evaluates the Stratton-Chu diffraction\nintegrals for incident fields of arbitrary temporal and spatial dependence.\nThis method has the advantage that its input is the unfocused field coming from\nthe laser chain, which is experimentally known with high accuracy. We use our\nmethod to show that the reflection of a linearly polarized Gaussian beam of\nfemtosecond duration off a high numerical aperture parabolic mirror induces\nellipticity in the dominant field components and generates strong longitudinal\ncomponents. We also estimate that future high-power laser facilities may reach\nintensities of $10^{24}\\,\\text{W/cm}^2$.\n", "  The data for the Ebola outbreak that occurred in 2014-2016 in three countries\nof West Africa are analysed within a common framework. The analysis is made\nusing the results of an agent based Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model on\na Euclidean network, where nodes at a distance $l$ are connected with\nprobability $P(l) \\propto l^{-\\delta }$, $\\delta$ determining the range of the\ninteraction, in addition to nearest neighbors. The cumulative (total) density\nof infected population here has the form $R(t) =\n\\frac{a\\exp(t/T)}{1+c\\exp(t/T)}$, where the parameters depend on $\\delta$ and\nthe infection probability $q$. This form is seen to fit well with the data.\nUsing the best fitting parameters, the time at which the peak is reached is\nestimated and is shown to be consistent with the data. We also show that in the\nEuclidean model, one can choose $\\delta$ and $q$ values which reproduce the\ndata for the three countries qualitatively. These choices are correlated with\npopulation density, control schemes and other factors. Comparing the real data\nand the results from the model one can also estimate the size of the actual\npopulation susceptible to the disease. Rescaling the real data a reasonably\ngood quantitative agreement with the simulation results is obtained.\n", "  We study the electronic structure and transport properties of zigzag and\narmchair monolayer molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons using an 11-band\ntight-binding model that accurately reproduces the material's bulk band\nstructure near the band gap. We study the electronic properties of pristine\nzigzag and armchair nanoribbons, paying particular attention to the edges\nstates that appear within the MoS$_2$ bulk gap. By analyzing both their orbital\ncomposition and their local density of states, we find that in\nzigzag-terminated nanoribbons these states can be localized at a single edge\nfor certain energies independent of the nanoribbon width. We also study the\neffects of disorder in these systems using the recursive Green's function\ntechnique. We show that for the zigzag nanoribbons, the conductance due to the\nedge states is strongly suppressed by short-range disorder such as vacancies.\nIn contrast, the local density of states still shows edge localization. We also\nshow that long-range disorder has a small effect on the transport properties of\nnanoribbons within the bulk gap energy window.\n", "  We study the behavior of quasinormal modes in a top-down holographic dual\ncorresponding to a strongly coupled $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills plasma\ncharged under a $U(1)$ subgroup of the global $SU(4)$ R-symmetry. In\nparticular, we analyze the spectra of quasinormal modes in the external scalar\nand vector diffusion channels near the critical point and obtain the behavior\nof the characteristic equilibration times of the plasma as the system evolves\ntowards the critical point of its phase diagram. Except close to the critical\npoint, we observe that by increasing the chemical potential one generally\nincreases the damping rate of the quasinormal modes, which leads to a reduction\nof the characteristic equilibration times in the dual strongly coupled plasma.\nHowever, as one approaches the critical point the typical equilibration time\n(as estimated from the lowest non-hydrodynamic quasinormal mode frequency)\nincreases, although remaining finite, while its derivative with respect to the\nchemical potential diverges with exponent -1/2. We also find a purely imaginary\nnon-hydrodynamical mode in the vector diffusion channel at nonzero chemical\npotential which dictates the equilibration time in this channel near the\ncritical point.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically the electric tunability due to coalescence of\nexceptional points in PT-symmetric waveguides bounded by imperfect conductive\nlayers. Owing to the competition effect of multimode interaction, multiple\nexceptional points and PT phase transitions could be attained in such a simple\nsystem and their occurrences are strongly dependent on the boundary conductive\nlayers. When the conductive layers become very thin, it is found that the\noblique transmittance and reflectance of the same system can be tuned between\nzero and one by a small change in carrier density. The results may provide an\neffective method for fast tuning and modulation of optical signals through\nelectrical gating.\n", "  We summarize the status of semileptonic and leptonic $B$ decays, including\n$|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ exclusive and inclusive determinations, decays to\nexcited states of the charm meson spectrum and decays into $\\tau$ leptons.\n", "  We look at the entropy production during the lepton era in the early Universe\nby using a model where we exclude all particles except the leptons and photons.\nWe assume a temperature dependent viscosity as calculated recently by one of us\n(Husdal 2016) with use of relativistic kinetic theory. We consider only the\nbulk viscosity, the shear viscosity being omitted because of spatial isotropy.\nThe rate of entropy production is highest just before the neutrinos decouple.\nOur results show that the increase in entropy during the lepton era is quite\nsmall, about 0.071 % at a decoupling temperature of $T=10^{10}~\\mathrm{K}$.\nThis result is slightly smaller than that obtained earlier by Caderni and\nFabbri (1977). After the neutrino decoupling, when the Universe has entered the\nphoton era, kinetic-theory arguments no longer support the appearance of a bulk\nviscosity. At high temperatures and a stable particle ratio, entropy production\n(d$\\sigma$/d$T$) goes as $T^{-8}$, with the total entropy ($\\Delta \\sigma$)\nincreasing as $T^{-7}$. These rates go slightly down just before the neutrinos\ndecouple, where $\\Delta \\sigma \\propto T^{-6.2}$.\n", "  Charge and energy fractionalization are among the most intriguing features of\ninteracting onedimensional fermion systems. In this work we determine how these\nphenomena are modified in the presence of an interaction quench. Charge and\nenergy are injected into the system suddenly after the quench, by means of\ntunneling processes with a non-interacting one-dimensional probe. Here, we\ndemonstrate that the system settles to a steady state in which the charge\nfractionalization ratio is unaffected by the pre-quenched parameters. On the\ncontrary, due to the post-quench nonequilibrium spectral function, the energy\npartitioning ratio is strongly modified, reaching values larger than one. This\nis a peculiar feature of the non-equilibrium dynamics of the quench process and\nit is in sharp contrast with the non-quenched case, where the ratio is bounded\nby one.\n", "  Recently, Padmanabhan has discussed that the expansion of the cosmic space is\ndue to the difference between the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary\nsurface and the number of degrees of freedom in a bulk region. Now, a natural\nquestion arises that how these degrees of freedom are emerged from nothing? We\ntry to address this issue in a new theory which is more complete than M-theory\nand reduces to it with some limitations. In M-theory, there isn't any stable\nobject like stable M3-branes that our universe is formed on it and for this\nreason can't help us to explain cosmological events. In this research, we\npropose a new theory, named G -theory which could be the mother of M-theory and\nsuperstring theory. In G-theory, at the beginning, two types of G0-branes, one\nwith positive energy and one with negative energy are produced from nothing in\nfourteen dimensions. Then, these branes are compactified on three circles via\ntwo different ways (symmetrically and anti-symmetrically), and two bosonic and\nfermionic parts of action for M0-branes are produced. By joining M0-branes,\nsupersymmetric Mp-branes are created which contain the equal number of degrees\nof freedom for fermions and bosons. Our universe is constructed on one of\nMp-branes and other Mp-brane and extra energy play the role of bulk. By\ndissolving extra energy which is produced by compacting actions of Gp-branes,\ninto our universe, the number of degrees of freedom on it and also it's scale\nfactor increase and universe expands. We test G-theory with observations and\nfind that the the magnitude of the slow-roll parameters and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio in this model are very smaller than one which are in\nagreement with predictions of experimental data. Finally, we consider the\norigin of the extended theories of gravity in G-theory and show that these\ntheories could be anomaly free.\n", "  We study the mass-richness relation using galaxy catalogues and images from\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use two independent methods, in the first one,\nwe calibrate the scaling relation with weak-lensing mass estimates. In the\nsecond procedure we apply a background subtraction technique to derive the\nprobability distribution, $P(M \\mid N)$, that groups with $N$-members have a\nvirialized halo mass $M$. Lensing masses are derived in different richness bins\nfor two galaxy systems sets: the maxBCG catalogue and a catalogue based on a\ngroup finder algorithm developed by Yang et al. MaxBCG results are used to test\nthe lensing methodology. The lensing mass-richness relation for the Yang et al.\ngroup sample shows a good agreement with $P(M \\mid N)$ obtained independently\nwith a straightforward procedure.\n", "  Newtonian simulations have demonstrated that accretion onto binary black\nholes produces accretion disks around each black hole (\"minidisks\"), fed by gas\nstreams flowing through the circumbinary cavity from the surrounding\ncircumbinary disk. We study the dynamics and radiation of an individual black\nhole minidisk using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations performed with a\nnew general relativistic version of the moving mesh code Disco. We introduce a\nco-moving energy variable which enables highly accurate integration of these\nhigh Mach number flows. Tidally induced spiral shock waves are excited in the\ndisk and propagate through the ISCO providing a Reynolds stress which causes\nefficient accretion by purely hydrodynamic means and producing a radiative\nsignature brighter in hard X-rays than the Novikov-Thorne model. Disk cooling\nis provided by a local blackbody prescription that allows the disk to evolve\nself-consistently to a temperature profile where hydrodynamic heating is\nbalanced by radiative cooling. We find that the spiral shock structure is in\nagreement with the relativistic dispersion relation for tightly-wound linear\nwaves. We measure the shock induced dissipation and find outward angular\nmomentum transport corresponding to an effective alpha parameter of order 0.01.\nWe perform ray-tracing image calculations from the simulations to produce\ntheoretical minidisk spectra and viewing angle dependent images for comparison\nwith observations.\n", "  Extra-dimensions are a common topic in popular descriptions of theoretical\nphysics with which undergraduate student most often have no contact in physics\ncourses. This paper shows how students could be introduced to this topic by\npresenting an approach to two basic consequences of the presence of compact\nextra-dimensions based on undergraduate-level physics. The insensibility of\nlow-energy physics to compact extra dimensions is illustrated in the context of\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanics and the prediction of Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations of particles is discussed in the framework of relativistic\nwave-equations. An exercise that could be used as a follow-up to the \"particle\nin a box\" is proposed.\n", "  The impact of the intrinsic time-dependent fluctuations in the electrical\nresistance at the graphene-metal interface or the contact noise, on the\nperformance of graphene field effect transistors, can be as adverse as the\ncontact resistance itself, but remains largely unexplored. Here we have\ninvestigated the contact noise in graphene field effect transistors of varying\ndevice geometry and contact configuration, with carrier mobility ranging from\n5,000 to 80,000$~$cm$^{2}$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$. Our phenomenological model for\ncontact noise due to current crowding in purely two dimensional conductors,\nconfirms that the contacts dominate the measured resistance noise in all\ngraphene field effect transistors in the two-probe or invasive four probe\nconfigurations, and surprisingly, also in nearly noninvasive four probe (Hall\nbar) configuration in the high mobility devices. The microscopic origin of\ncontact noise is directly linked to the fluctuating electrostatic environment\nof the metal-channel interface, which could be generic to two dimensional\nmaterial-based electronic devices.\n", "  Bandwidth measurements are conducted on a 1.4 m long spiral polymer multimode\nwaveguide for a SMF and 50/125 um MMF launch and for different input offsets.\nThe waveguide exhibits a bandwidth of at least 30 GHz for all input types,\nyielding a bandwidth-length product of at least 42 GHzxm, while no impact is\nobserved on the waveguide performance due to the different spatial input\noffsets. The results indicate that data transmission at data rates even higher\nthan 25 Gb/s can be achieved over such structures, thereby demonstrating the\npotential of multimode polymer waveguide technologies in short-reach\nboard-level datacommunication links.\n", "  We apply a recently developed variant of the Density of States (DoS) method,\nthe so-called Functional Fit Approach (FFA) to two different models: the SU(3)\nspin model and SU(3) lattice gauge theory with static color sources. Both\nmodels can be derived from QCD and inherit the complex action problem at finite\ndensity. We discuss the implementation of DoS FFA in the two models and compute\nobservables related to the particle density. For the SU(3) spin model we show\nthat the results are in good agreement with the results from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation in the dual formulation, which is free of the complex action\nproblem. For the case of SU(3) lattice gauge theory with static color sources\nwe present first results for the particle number as a function of the coupling\nfor different values of the chemical potential.\n", "  The fate of a local two-hole doublon excitation in the one-dimensional\nFermi-Hubbard model is systematically studied for strong Hubbard interaction U\nin the entire filling range using the density-matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) and the Bethe ansatz. For strong U, two holes at the same site form a\ncompound object whose decay is impeded by the lack of phase space. Still, a\npartial decay is possible on an extremely short time scale where phase-space\narguments do not yet apply. We argue that the initial decay and the resulting\nintermediate state are relevant for experiments performed with ultracold atoms\nloaded into an optical lattice as well as for (time-resolved) CVV\nAuger-electron spectroscopy. The detailed discussion comprises the mixed\nballistic-diffusive real-time propagation of the doublon through the lattice,\nits partial decay on the short time scale as a function of filling and\ninteraction strength, as well as the analysis of the decay products, which are\nmetastable on the intermediate time scale that is numerically accessible and\nwhich show up in the two-hole excitation (Auger) spectrum. The ambivalent role\nof singly occupied sites is key to understanding the doublon physics: For high\nfillings, ground-state configurations with single occupancies are recognized to\nstrongly relax the kinematic constraints and to open up decay channels. For\nfillings close to half filling, however, their presence actually blocks the\ndoublon decay. Finally, the analysis of the continua in the two-hole spectrum\nexcludes a picture where the doublon decays into unbound electron holes for\ngeneric fillings, different from the limiting case of the completely filled\nband. We demonstrate that the decay products as well as the doublon propagation\nshould rather be understood in terms of Bethe ansatz eigenstates.\n", "  Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG), also referred as MOdified Gravity (MOG),\nis an alternative theory of the gravitational interaction. Its weak field\napproximation has been successfully used to described Solar System\nobservations, galaxy rotation curves, dynamics of clusters of galaxies, and\ncosmological data, without the imposition of dark components. The theory was\nformulated by John Moffat in 2006. In this work, we derive matter-sourced\nsolutions of STVG and construct neutron star models. We aim at exploring STVG\npredictions about stellar structure in the strong gravity regime. Specifically,\nwe represent spacetime with a static, spherically symmetric manifold, and model\nthe stellar matter content with a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor. We then\nderive the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in STVG and integrate\nit for different equations of state. We find that STVG allows heavier neutron\nstars than General Relativity (GR). Maximum masses depend on a normalized\nparameter that quantifies the deviation from GR. The theory exhibits unusual\npredictions for extreme values of this parameter. We conclude that STVG admits\nsuitable spherically symmetric solutions with matter sources, relevant for\nstellar structure. Since recent determinations of neutron stars masses violate\nsome GR predictions, STVG appears as a viable candidate for a new gravity\ntheory.\n", "  We investigate a link between the energy-momentum dispersion relation and the\nspectral distance in the context of a Lorentzian almost-commutative spectral\ngeometry, defined by the product of Minkowski spacetime and an internal\ndiscrete noncommutative space. Using the causal structure, the\nalmost-commutative manifold can be identified with a pair of four-dimensional\nMinkowski spacetimes embedded in a five-dimensional Minkowski geometry.\nConsidering fermions travelling within the light cone of the ambient\nfive-dimensional spacetime, we then derive the energy-momentum dispersion\nrelation.\n", "  A minimal system of equations is introduced and applied to study the drift\nmotion of ferromagnetic particles suspended in a viscous fluid and subjected to\na time-periodic driving force and a nonuniformly rotating magnetic field. It is\ndemonstrated that the synchronized translational and rotational oscillations of\nthese particles are accompanied by their drift in a preferred direction, which\noccurs under the action of the Magnus force. We calculate both analytically and\nnumerically the drift velocity of particles characterized by single-domain\ncores and nonmagnetic shells and show that there are two types of drift,\nunidirectional and bidirectional, which can be realized in suspensions composed\nof particles with different core-shell ratios. The possibility of using the\neffect of bidirectional drift for the separation of core-shell particles in\nsuspensions is also discussed.\n", "  Relaxation in glasses is often approximated by a stretched-exponential form:\n$f(t) = A \\exp [-(t/\\tau)^{\\beta}]$. Here, we show that the relaxation in a\nmodel of sheared non-Brownian suspensions developed by Cort\\'e et al. [Nature\nPhys. 4, 420 (2008)] can be well approximated by a stretched exponential with\nan exponent $\\beta$ that depends on the strain amplitude: $0.25 < \\beta < 1$.\nIn a one-dimensional version of the model, we show how the relaxation\noriginates from density fluctuations in the initial particle configurations.\nOur analysis is in good agreement with numerical simulations and reveals a\nfunctional form for the relaxation that is distinct from, but well approximated\nby, a stretched-exponential function.\n", "  The Tunka-Rex experiment (Tunka Radio Extension) has been deployed in 2012 at\nthe Tunka Valley (Republic of Buryatia, Russia). Its purpose is to investigate\nmethods for the energy spectrum and the mass composition of high-energy cosmic\nrays based on the radio emission of air showers. Tunka-Rex is an array of 25\nradio antennas distributed over an area of 3 km^2. The most important feature\nof the Tunka-Rex is that the air-shower radio emission is measured in\ncoincidence with the Tunka-133 installation, which detects the Cherenkov\nradiation generated by the same atmospheric showers. Joint measurements of the\nradio emission and the Cherenkov light provide a unique opportunity for cross\ncalibration of both calorimetric detection methods. The main goal of Tunka-Rex\nis to determine the precision for the reconstruction of air-shower parameters\nusing the radio detection technique. In this article we present the current\nstatus of Tunka-Rex and first results, including reconstruction methods for\nparameters of the primary cosmic rays.\n", "  Wave function collapse models are considered as the modified theories of\nstandard quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level. By introducing nonlinear\nstochastic terms in the Schr\\\"odinger equation, these models make predictions,\ndifferently from those of standard quantum mechanics, that it is fundamentally\nimpossible to prepare macroscopic systems in macroscopic superpositions. The\nvalidity of these models can only be examined by experiments and hence\nefficient protocols for this kind of experiments are highly needed. Here we\nprovide a protocol that is able to probe the postulated collapse effect by\nmeans of the entanglement of the center-of-mass motion of two nanospheres\noptically trapped in a Fabry-P\\'erot cavity. We show that the collapse noise\nresults in large reduction of the steady-state entanglement and the\nentanglement, with and without the collapse effect, shows distinguishable\nscalings with certain system parameters, which can be used to unambiguously\ndetermine the effect of these models.\n", "  We investigate the interparticle potential between spin-0, -1/2 and -1\nsources interacting in modified electrodynamics in the non-relativistic regime.\nBy keeping terms of $\\mathcal{O}( |{\\bf p}|^2/m^2 )$ in the amplitudes, we\nobtain spin- and velocity-dependent interaction energies. We find well-known\neffects such as spin-orbit couplings, as well as spin-spin (dipole-dipole)\ninteractions. For concreteness, we consider the cases of electrodynamics with\nhigher derivatives (Podolsky-Lee-Wick) and hidden photons.\n", "  The $1/N_c$ expansion method for studying the mass spectrum of excited\nbaryons is shortly reviewed together with applications to mixed symmetric\nstates. The $[{\\bf 70, \\ell^+}]$ multiplet, belonging to the $N$ = 2 band, is\nreanalyzed, with emphasis on hyperons and the SU(3) symmetry breaking operators\nentering the mass formula to first order. An important result is that the\nhierarchy of masses as a function of strangeness is correctly reproduced for\nall multiplets. Predictions for unknown excited hyperons to SU(6) $\\times$ O(3)\nmultiplets are made.\n", "  We propose a two-dimensional crystal which possesses low indirect band gaps\nof 0.55 eV (monolayer) and 0.43 eV (bilayer) and high carrier mobilities\nsimilar to those of phosphorene: GeP3. GeP3 has a stable three-dimensional\nlayered bulk counterpart which is metallic and is known from experiment since\n1970. It has a small cleavage energy, which suggests exfoliation of bulk\nmaterial as viable means for the preparation of mono- and few-layer materials.\nThe material shows strong interlayer quantum confinement effects, resulting in\na band gap reduction from mono- to bilayer, and then to a semiconductor-metal\ntransition between bi- and triple layer. Under biaxial strain, the indirect\nband gap can be turned into a direct one. Pronounced light absorption in the\nspectral range from ~600 to 1400 nm is predicted for monolayer and bilayer and\npromises applications in photovoltaics.\n", "  A generic and universal layer engineering strategy for van der Waals (vW)\nmaterials, scalable and compatible with the current semiconductor technology is\nof paramout importance in realizing all-two-dimensional logic circuits and move\nbeyond the silicon scaling limit. In this letter, we demonstrate a scalable and\nhighly controllable microwave plasma based layer engineering strategy for MoS2\nand other vW materials. Using this technique we etch MoS2 flakes layer-by-layer\nstarting from arbitrary thickness and area down to the mono- or the few-layer\nlimit. From Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, photoluminescence\nspectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron\nmicroscopy, we confirm that the structural and morphological properties of the\nmaterial have not been compromised. The process preserves the pre-etch layer\ntopography and yields a smooth and pristine-like surface. We explore the\nelectrical properties utilising a field effect transistor geometry and find\nthat the mobility values of our samples are comparable to those of the pristine\nones. The layer removal does not involve any reactive gasses or chemical\nreactions and relies on breaking the weak inter-layer vW interaction making it\na generic technique for a wide spectrum of layered materials and\nheterostructures. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the technique by\nextending it to other systems such as Graphene, h-BN and WSe2. In addition,\nusing the microwave plasma in combination with standard lithography, we\nillustrate a lateral patterning scheme for device fabrication.\n", "  Heusler compounds are a large family of binary, ternary and quaternary\ncompounds that exhibit a wide range of properties of both fundamental and\npotential technological interest. The extensive tunability of the Heusler\ncompounds through chemical substitutions and structural motifs makes the family\nespecially interesting. In this article we highlight recent major developments\nin the field of Heusler compounds and put these in the historical context. The\nevolution of the Heusler compounds can be described by four major periods of\nresearch. In the latest period, Heusler 4.0 has led to the observation of a\nvariety of properties derived from topology that includes: topological metals\nwith Weyl and Dirac points; a variety of non-collinear spin textures including\nthe very recent observation of skyrmions at room temperature; and giant\nanomalous Hall effects in antiferromagnetic Heuslers with triangular magnetic\nstructures. Here we give a comprehensive overview of these major achievements\nand set research into Heusler materials within the context of recent emerging\ntrends in condensed matter physics.\n", "  We present results on the effects of interstitial oxygen and carbon on a\nbulk-niobium superconducting radio-frequency cavity. Previous experiments have\nshown that high-temperature (~800 $^\\circ\\text{C}$) nitrogen-doping plays the\ndominant role in the reduction of the electron mean free path in the RF\npenetration layer of niobium that leads to a decrease in microwave surface\nresistance and a suppression the temperature-dependent component of the surface\nresistance with increasing accelerating gradient. In this work, we show that\noxygen and carbon-doping has very similar effects on cavity performance,\ndemonstrating that these effects are not unique to nitrogen. The preparation\nmethod used in the introduction of interstitial oxygen and carbon has the\nadvantage that it is done at lower temperatures than that of high-temperature\nnitrogen-doping and does not require post-treatment electro-polishing.\n", "  A new approach to wavefunction collapse is prepared by an analysis of\nsemiclassical gravity. The fact that, in semiclassical gravity, superposed\nstates must share a common classical spacetime geometry, even if they prefer\n(according to general relativity) differently curved spacetimes, leads to\nenergy increases of the states, when their mass distributions are different. If\none interprets these energy increases divided by Planck's constant as decay\nrates of the states, one obtains the lifetimes of superpositions according to\nthe Diosi-Penrose criterion and reduction probabilities according to Born's\nrule. The derivation of Born's rule for two-state superpositions can be adapted\nto the typical quantum mechanical experiments with the help of a common\nproperty of these experiments. It is that they lead to never more than two\ndifferent mass distributions at one location referring e.g. to the cases that a\nparticle \"is\", or \"is not\", detected at the location. From the characteristic\nenergy of the Diosi-Penrose criterion, an action is constructed whose\nrelativistic generalisation becomes obvious by a decomposition of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action to the superposed states. In Part 2, semiclassical\ngravity is enhanced to the so-called Dynamical Spacetime approach to\nwavefunction collapse, which leads to a physical mechanism for collapse.\n", "  A formulary for the application of the Diosi-Penrose criterion to solids in\nquantum superpositions is developed, which takes the solid's microscopic mass\ndistribution (resulting from its nuclei) and its macroscopic shape into\naccount, where the solid's states can differ by slightly different positions or\nextensions of the solid. For small displacements, smaller than the spatial\nvariation of the solid's nuclei, the characteristic energy of the Diosi-Penrose\ncriterion is mainly determined by the mass distribution of the nuclei. For\nlarge displacements, much larger than the solid's lattice constant, the solid\ncan be idealised as a continuum, and the characteristic energy depends on the\nsolid's shape and the direction of the displacement. In Diosi's approach, in\nwhich the mass density operator has to be smeared, the solid's microscopic mass\ndistribution plays no role. The results are applied to a special single-photon\navalanche photodiode detector, which interacts as little as possible with its\nenvironment. This is realised by disconnecting the detector from the\nmeasurement devices when it is in a superposition, and by biasing the\nphotodiode by a plate capacitor, which is charged shortly before the photon's\narrival. For a suitable choice of components, the detector can stay in a\nsuperposition for seconds; its lifetime can be shortened to microseconds with\nthe help of a piezoactuator, which displaces a mass in the case of photon\ndetection.\n", "  An experiment for checking the Dynamical Spacetime approach to wavefunction\ncollapse is proposed. The Dynamical Spacetime approach predicts deviations from\nBorn's rule, when a solid evolves into a three-state superposition, and when\nthe displacement between the superposed states is, at the reduction point in\ntime, significantly larger than the spatial variation of the solids nuclei,\nbeing typically on the order of a tenth of an Angstroem. The solid is brought\ninto the three-state superposition by splitting a photon into three beams and\nby detecting it in each beam by avalanche photodiodes, which displace the solid\nat different distances with the help of a piezoactuator. The challenge of the\nexperiment is the precise prediction of the setup's reduction point in time to\nensure a sufficient separation between the states at this point in time. This\nis addressed by avoiding interactions of the setup with the environment during\nsuperposition, and by a precise calculation of the setup's reduction point in\ntime with the help of a formulary for the Diosi-Penrose criterion for solids in\nquantum superpositions. Since the measurement of reduction probabilities is not\ndisturbed by state decoherence, the experiment can be performed at room\ntemperature. The quantitative analysis demonstrates that the predicted increase\nof the reduction probability of one state by a factor of 1.5 with respect to\nBorn's rule can be measured by a few hundred statistically significant\nmeasurements.\n", "  We find the exact bound-state solutions and normalization constant for the\nDirac equation with scalar-vector-pseudoscalar interaction terms for the\ngeneralized Hulth\\'{e}n potential in the case where we have a particular mass\nfunction $m(x)$. We also search the solutions for the constant mass where the\nobtained results correspond to the ones when the Dirac equation has spin and\npseudospin symmetry, respectively. After giving the obtained results for the\nnon-relativistic case, we search then the energy spectra and corresponding\nupper and lower components of Dirac spinor for the case of $PT$-symmetric forms\nof the present potential.\n", "  A new approach to wavefunction collapse is proposed. The so-called Dynamical\nSpacetime approach enhances semiclassical gravity and enables it for an\nexplanation of wavefunction collapse by postulating that the spacetime region\non which quantum fields exist and on which the wavefunction's evolution can be\nregarded is bounded towards the future by a spacelike hypersurface, which is\ndynamically expanding towards the future. Collapse is displayed in the way that\nthe wavefunction's evolution becomes unstable at certain critical expansions of\nspacetime, at which it reconfigures via a self-reinforcing mechanism\nquasi-abruptly to an evolution resembling a classical trajectory. Thereby,\nspacetime geometry changes in favour of the winning state, which causes the\npath of the other state to vanish by destructive interference. This mechanism\nfor collapse can explain the quantum correlations in EPR experiments without\ncoming into conflict with relativity and the Free Will theorem. The Dynamical\nSpacetime approach is mathematically formulated on basis of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action and predicts for the Newtonian limit the same lifetimes\nof superpositions as the gravity-based approaches of Diosi and Penrose. A\nsecond important feature of the Dynamical Spacetime approach is its capability\nto forecast reduction probabilities. It can explain why all experiments\nperformed so-far confirm Born's rule, and predict deviations from it, when\nsolids evolve into three-state superpositions. The basics needed for the\nderivations in this paper are developed in Part 1 by an analysis of\nsemiclassical gravity.\n", "  We compute the Schur indices in the presence of some line operators based on\nour con- jectural formula introduced in [1]. In particular, we focus on the\nrank 1 superconformal field theories with the enhanced global symmetry and the\nfree hypermultiplets with the elementary pants networks defined on the three\npunctured sphere in the class S context. From the observations on the concrete\ncomputations, we propose new kinds of the class S skein relations in the sense\nthat they include the generic puncture non-trivially. We also give a general\nformula to unify all the relations we have exhibited.\n", "  Various optical methods for measuring positions of micro-objects in 3D have\nbeen reported in the literature. Nevertheless, majority of them are not\nsuitable for real-time operation, which is needed, for example, for feedback\nposition control. In this paper, we present a method for real-time estimation\nof the position of micro-objects in 3D; the method is based on twin-beam\nillumination and it requires only a very simple hardware setup whose essential\npart is a standard image sensor without any lens. Performance of the proposed\nmethod is tested during a micro-manipulation task in which the estimated\nposition served as a feedback for the controller. The experiments show that the\nestimate is accurate to within ~3 um in the lateral position and ~7 um in the\naxial distance with the refresh rate of 10 Hz. Although the experiments are\ndone using spherical objects, the presented method could be modified to handle\nnon-spherical objects as well.\n", "  This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the closure kinetics of a\npolymer with hydrodynamic interactions. This analysis, which takes into account\nthe non-Markovian dynamics of the end-to-end vector and relies on the\npreaveraging of the mobility tensor (Zimm dynamics), is shown to reproduce very\naccurately the results of numerical simulations of the complete non linear\ndynamics. It is found that Markovian treatments, based on a Wilemski-Fixman\napproximation, significantly overestimate cyclization times (up to a factor 2),\nshowing the importance of memory effects in the dynamics. In addition, this\nanalysis provides scaling laws of the mean first cyclization time (MFCT) with\nthe polymer size $N$ and capture radius $b$, which are identical in both\nMarkovian and non-Markovian approaches. In particular, it is found that the\nscaling of the MFCT for large $N$ is given by $T\\sim N^{3/2}\\ln (N/b^2)$, which\ndiffers from the case of the Rouse dynamics where $T\\sim N^{2}$. The extension\nto the case of the reaction kinetics of a monomer of a Zimm polymer with an\nexternal target in a confined volume is also presented.\n", "  The maximum value of the energy gap $\\Delta\\simeq 8\\ meV$ and the ratio\n$2\\delta/kT_c\\simeq~2.5$ are determined for a high-temperature superconductor\n$\\rm Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+y}$ by using point contacts. It was found that the\nhigh-temperature superconductor is transformed under the effect of current\ninjection of quasiparticles to a new modified state with a reduced gap, which\nis stable in a wide range of injection intensity.\n", "  We present a simplified yet sophisticated variation to localised surface\nplasmon resonance spectroscopy, which makes use of naked or non-functionalised,\nnanoparticle templates. These nanoparticle templates, produced with a rapid and\nscalable process, namely laser annealing, were used as a highly sensitive\nsurface sensor to monitor the adsorption of both metallic lead and a lead salt\nfrom aqueous solutions, showing a measurable optical response due to a surface\nabundance of lead as low as 100 ppm from 0.3 ml of Pb2SO4 solutions, with\nconcentrations less than 20 ppm. This proposed method enables the end user to\nrapidly assess the surface abundance of lead from a simple optical reflectance\nmeasurement and could serve as a platform for in situ analysis within water\nfiltration and cleaning systems.\n", "  Spin filter superconducting S/I/N tunnel junctions (NbN/GdN/TiN) show a\nrobust and pronounced zero bias conductance peak at low temperatures, the\nmagnitude of which is several times the normal state conductance of the\njunction. Such a conductance anomaly is representative of unconventional\nsuperconductivity and is interpreted as a direct signature of an odd frequency\nsuperconducting order.\n", "  Retrosynthesis is a technique to plan the chemical synthesis of organic\nmolecules, for example drugs, agro- and fine chemicals. In retrosynthesis, a\nsearch tree is built by analysing molecules recursively and dissecting them\ninto simpler molecular building blocks until one obtains a set of known\nbuilding blocks. The search space is intractably large, and it is difficult to\ndetermine the value of retrosynthetic positions. Here, we propose to model\nretrosynthesis as a Markov Decision Process. In combination with a Deep Neural\nNetwork policy learned from essentially the complete published knowledge of\nchemistry, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can be used to evaluate positions. In\nexploratory studies, we demonstrate that MCTS with neural network policies\noutperforms the traditionally used best-first search with hand-coded\nheuristics.\n", "  The last few years, 2013-2016, the high energy neutrino events in ICECUBE and\nthe last rich UHECR maps by AUGER and TA were hopefully opening a new High\nEnergy astronomy age. Unfortunately the foreseen correlation between neutrino\nwith best gamma X sources has not (yet) been found. The most celebrated GRB\ngamma sources do not correlate to any neutrino events. The expected Local Group\nanisotropy in UHECR within the nuleon GZK cut off, has just fade away. UHECR\nevents from Virgo are almost absent. Above two hundred TeV energy tau neutrino\nmight shine by double bang in detectable way in ICECUBE. Within a dozen of\nevents no tau neutrino arised (yet) in ICECUBE. Finally GRBs Fireball models\ncalling since decades for HE neutrinos correlated imprint at TeVs energy are\nnot (yet) found. So many absences are making a huge question mark: is there a\nnew reading key?\n", "  GMOS-IFU observational data were used to study the detailed two dimensional\ngas kinematics and morphological structures within the ~500x421 pc^2 of the\nactive Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4501. We provide empirical evidences of possible\noutflowing material from the central zones of NGC 4501 to the observer. In\naddition, we performed a spectral synthesis and diagnostic diagram analysis to\ndetermine respectively the dominant stellar population in the inner disc of\nthis galaxy and to unveil the actual nature of the central engine of NGC 4501.\nThe principal finding of this work is that the central regions of NGC 4501 are\ndominated by non circular motions connected to probable outflows of matter from\nthe nuclear regions of this galaxy. A predominant old stellar population\ninhabits the internal zones of NGC 4501 excluding the possibility of ongoing\nstarburst activity in the central parsecs of this galaxy. The latter result is\nconfirmed by the diagnostic diagram analysis that establishes a preponderant\nactive galactic nucleus character for NGC 4501. These outcomes together provide\na general description of the gas motion and the corresponding nuclear activity\nin the internal disc of NGC 4501 in an attempt to elucidate the possible\nrelation among the central activity and the induced kinematic properties of\nthis nearby galaxy.\n", "  Fuel cells, batteries, thermochemical and other energy conversion devices\ninvolve the transport of a number of (electro-)chemical species through\ndistinct materials so that they can meet and react at specified multi-material\ninterfaces. Therefore, morphology or arrangement of these different materials\ncan be critical in the performance of an energy conversion device. In this\npaper, we study a model problem motivated by a solar-driven thermochemical\nconversion device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. We formulate the\nproblem as a system of coupled multi-material reaction-diffusion equations\nwhere each species diffuses selectively through a given material and where the\nreaction occurs at multi-material interfaces. We express the problem of optimal\ndesign of the material arrangement as a saddle point problem and obtain an\neffective functional which shows that regions with very fine phase mixtures of\nthe material arise naturally. To explore this further, we introduce a\nphase-field formulation of the optimal design problem, and numerically study\nselected examples.\n", "  A vast wealth of literature exists on the topic of rocket trajectory\noptimisation, particularly in the area of interplanetary trajectories due to\nits relevance today. Studies on optimising interstellar and intergalactic\ntrajectories are usually performed in flat spacetime using an analytical\napproach, with very little focus on optimising interstellar trajectories in a\ngeneral relativistic framework. This paper examines the use of low-acceleration\nrockets to reach galactic destinations in the least possible time, with a\ngenetic algorithm being employed for the optimisation process. The fuel\nrequired for each journey was calculated for various types of propulsion\nsystems to determine the viability of low-acceleration rockets to colonise the\nMilky Way. The results showed that to limit the amount of fuel carried on\nboard, an antimatter propulsion system would likely be the minimum\ntechnological requirement to reach star systems tens of thousands of light\nyears away. However, using a low-acceleration rocket would require several\nhundreds of thousands of years to reach these star systems, with minimal time\ndilation effects since maximum velocities only reached about 0.2c. Such transit\ntimes are clearly impractical, and thus, any kind of colonisation using low\nacceleration rockets would be difficult. High accelerations, on the order of\n1g, are likely required to complete interstellar journeys within a reasonable\ntime frame, though they may require prohibitively large amounts of fuel. So for\nnow, it appears that humanity's ultimate goal of a galactic empire may only be\npossible at significantly higher accelerations, though the propulsion\ntechnology requirement for a journey that uses realistic amounts of fuel\nremains to be determined.\n", "  The extended-MHD NIMROD code [C.R. Sovinec and J.R. King, J. Comput. Phys.\n229, 5803 (2010)] is verified against the ideal-MHD ELITE code [H.R. Wilson et\nal. Phys. Plasmas 9, 1277 (2002)] on a diverted tokamak discharge. When the\nNIMROD model complexity is increased incrementally, resistive and first-order\nfinite-Larmour radius effects are destabilizing and stabilizing, respectively.\nThe full result is compared to local analytic calculations which are found to\noverpredict both the resistive destabilization and drift stabilization in\ncomparison to the NIMROD computations.\n", "  The extended-MHD NIMROD code [C.R. Sovinec and J.R. King, J. Comput. Phys.\n229, 5803 (2010)] models broadband-MHD activity from a reconstruction of a\nquiescent H-mode shot on the DIII-D tokamak [J. L. Luxon, Nucl. Fusion 42, 614\n(2002)]. Computations with the reconstructed toroidal and poloidal ion flows\nexhibit low-n perturbations (n=1-5) that grow and saturate into a\nturbulent-like MHD state. The workflow used to project the reconstructed state\nonto the NIMROD basis functions re-solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and\nextrapolates profiles to include scrape-off-layer currents. Evaluation of the\ntransport from the turbulent-like MHD state leads to a relaxation of the\ndensity and temperature profiles.\n", "  This paper aims at extending our previous work on the solution of the\none-dimensional Dirac equation using the Tridiagonal Representation Approach\n(TRA). In the approach, we expand the spinor wavefunction in terms of suitable\nsquare integrable basis functions that support a tridiagonal matrix\nrepresentation of the wave operator. This will transform the problem from\nsolving a system of coupled first order differential equations to solving an\nalgebraic three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the\nwavefunction. In some cases, solutions to this recursion relation can be\nrelated to well-known classes of orthogonal polynomials whereas in other\nsituations solutions represent new class of polynomials. In this work, we will\ndiscuss various solvable potentials that obey the tridiagonal representation\nrequirement with special emphasis on simple cases with spin-symmetric and\npseudospin-symmetric potential couplings. We conclude by mentioning some\npotential applications in graphene.\n", "  We present initial results of computing nucleon electric dipole moment\ninduced by quark chromo-EDM, CP-violating quark-gluon coupling. Using\nchirally-symmetric domain wall and M\\\"obius fermions with pion mass\n$m_\\pi=172\\text{ MeV}$, we calculate the connected part of the electric dipole\nform factor $F_3(Q^2)$. In addition, we perform an exploratory study of the\nmethod to calculate EDM using uniform background electric field on a lattice\nintroduced without breaking the periodicity in the time direction.\n", "  We are presenting the design and the preliminary numerical and experimental\nanalyses of two mismatched Coriolis vibratory gyroscopes incorporating\nnonlinear modal interaction. A novel double-H design includes two\nclamped-clamped beams and a suspended mass in the middle connected to the base\nbeams via four short cantilevers. Another design is a T-shaped gyro including a\nprimary doubly-clamped beam and a secondary sense beam. A combination of\nanalytical, finite element, and experimental analyses are employed to study the\ncharacteristics of the nonlinear gyro. The drive mode matches the structure's\nsecond mode, while the sense mode matches the fundamental mode of the\nstructure. Our preliminary study indicates that the bandwidth and the\nsensitivity of the rotation rate sensor are improved by employing the nonlinear\nmodal interaction.\n", "  Methods are described that extend fields from reconstructed equilibria to\ninclude scrape-off-layer current through extrapolated parametrized and\nexperimental fits. The extrapolation includes both the effects of the\ntoroidal-field and pressure gradients which produce scrape-off-layer current\nafter recomputation of the Grad-Shafranov solution. To quantify the degree that\ninclusion of scrape-off-layer current modifies the equilibrium, the\n$\\chi$-squared goodness-of-fit parameter is calculated for cases with and\nwithout scrape-off-layer current. The change in $\\chi$-squared is found to be\nminor when scrape-off-layer current is included however flux surfaces are\nshifted by up to 3 cm. The impact on edge modes of these scrape-off-layer\nmodifications is also found to be small and the importance of these methods to\nnonlinear computation is discussed.\n", "  Tunable composite materials with interesting physical behavior can be\ndesigned through integrating unique optical properties of solid nanostructures\nwith the facile responses of soft matter to weak external stimuli, but this\napproach remains challenged by their poorly controlled co-assembly at the\nmesoscale. Using scalable wet chemical synthesis procedures, we fabricated\nanisotropic gold-silica-dye colloidal nanostructures and then organized them\ninto the device-scale (demonstrated for square inch cells) electrically tunable\ncomposites by simultaneously invoking molecular and colloidal self-assembly. We\nshow that the ensuing ordered colloidal dispersions of shape-anisotropic\nnanostructures exhibit tunable fluorescence decay rates and intensity. We\ncharacterize how these properties depend on low-voltage fields and polarization\nof both the excitation and emission light, demonstrating a great potential for\nthe practical realization of an interesting breed of nanostructured composite\nmaterials.\n", "  Globular clusters are the oldest conglomerates of stars in our Galaxy and can\nbe useful laboratories to test theories from stellar evolution to cosmology. In\nthis paper, we present a new method to estimate the absolute age of a globular\ncluster from observations of its brown dwarfs. The transition region between\nthe end of the main sequence and the brown dwarf regime is characterized by a\ndearth of objects as function of magnitude. The brightest of the cooling brown\ndwarfs is easily identified by an increase in density in the color-magnitude\ndiagram as you go fainter in magnitudes, and these brightest brown dwarfs get\nfainter with age. By identifying the brightest brown dwarfs, it is thus\npossible to determine the age of a globular cluster within a 1 Gyr precision\nwith four-sigma confidence. This new method, which is independent of current\nmethods of age estimation and which does not rely on the knowledge of the\ncluster's distance from Earth, will become feasible thanks to the high spatial\nresolution and incredible infrared sensitivity of the James Webb Space\nTelescope.\n", "  Quantum corrections to the classical pressure are obtained for Lennard-Jones\nmodels of argon, neon, and helium using classical Metropolis algorithm computer\nsimulations. The corrections for non-commutativity are obtained to fourth order\nin Planck's constant. Compared to the classical virial pressure on all\nisotherms at liquid-like densities, the quantum correction is found to be\n${\\cal O}(10^{-2})$ for argon, ${\\cal O}(10^{0})$ for neon, and ${\\cal\nO}(10^{3})$ for helium. The first order correction due to wave function\nsymmetrization is also obtained, but this is relatively negligible.\n", "  We study exchange coupling due to the interelectron Coulomb interaction\nbetween two ferromagnetic grains embedded into insulating matrix. This\ncontribution to the exchange interaction complements the contribution due to\nvirtual electron hopping between the grains. We show that the Coulomb and the\nhopping based exchange interactions are comparable. However, for most system\nparameters these contributions have opposite signs and compete with each other.\nIn contrast to the hopping based exchange interaction the Coulomb based\nexchange is inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the insulating\nmatrix $\\varepsilon$. The total intergrain exchange interaction has a\ncomplicated dependence on the dielectric permittivity of the insulating matrix.\nIncreasing $\\varepsilon$ one can observe the ferromagnet-antiferromagnet\n(FM-AFM) and AFM-FM transitions. For certain parameters no transition is\npossible, however even in this case the exchange interaction has large\nvariations, changing its value by three times with increasing the matrix\ndielectric constant.\n", "  A hybrid structure of a graphene nanomesh with the gold nanodisks is studied\nto enhance the light absorption by localized surface plasmon resonance. From\nthe reflection spectra of the visible range for graphene nanomesh samples\nwithout and with nanodisks, it is found that the absorption of graphene\nnanomesh structures is greatly enhanced in the presence of gold nanodisks\naround the resonance wavelength. Simulation results based on the\nfinite-difference time-domain method support the experimental observations.\nThis study demonstrates the potential of constructing graphene based\nphotodetectors with a high light absorption efficiency and wavelength\nselectivity.\n", "  The predominant method for generating Lattice QCD configurations is Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (HMC). In order to speed up this generation, a wide range of\npreconditioning techniques that modify the lattice action have been devised.\nThis work compares the performance of the well-known Hasenbusch preconditioning\ntechnique with the polynomial filtering technique on a small $16^3 \\times 32$\nlattice with two flavours of Wilson fermions at a pion mass $M_{\\pi} \\sim\n400~\\mathrm{MeV}$. We explore a novel method of combining polynomial and\nHasenbusch filters, revealing a speedup when compared to the standard two\nHasenbusch filters. This comes with the added advantage of simplified tuning.\n", "  Mesoporous silica matrices have been prepared via classic acid catalyzed and\nsono-catalyzed sol-gel routes. Tetramethoxysilan (TMOS) and\nmethyl-trimethoxysilane (MTMS) were used as silica precursors, and\nN-butyl-3-methylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate ([bmPy][BF4]) was employed as\nco-solvent and pore template. The ionic liquid (IL) to silica mole ratio was\nvaried between 0.007 and 0.07. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption and small-angle\nneutron scattering measurements were used to characterize the obtained\nmaterials. The ionic liquid played the role of catalyst that affected the\nformation of the primary xerogel particles, and changed the porosity of the\nmaterials. Ultrasound treatment resulted in microstructure change on the level\nof the colloid particle aggregates. In comparison with IL containing xerogels,\nthe IL containing sonogels show increased pore diameter, bigger pore volumes\nand diminished surface areas.\n", "  We give results and observations which allow the application of the\nlogarithmic tensor category theory of Lepowsky, Zhang and the author\n([HLZ1]--[HLZ9]) to more general vertex (operator) algebras and their module\ncategories than those studied in a paper by the author ([H3]).\n", "  The physicochemical characterization of the magnetoferritin biomacromolecule\nin terms of morphology, structural and magnetic properties shows that iron\noxides can be efficiently loaded into apoferritin molecules, preserving their\nnative biocompatible structure and affecting the morphology of the protein\nshell.\n", "  Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) have opened a new path to switch the magnetization\nin perpendicularly magnetized films and are of great interest due to their\npotential applications in novel data storage technology, such as the magnetic\nrandom access memory (MRAM). The effective manipulation of SOT has thus become\nan important step towards these applications. Here, current induced spin-orbit\neffective fields and magnetization switching are investigated in\nPt/Ta/CoFeB/MgO structures with bilayer heavy metals. With a fixed thickness (1\nnm) of the Ta layer, the magnitude and sign of current induced spin-orbit\neffective fields can be continuously tuned by changing the Pt layer thickness,\nconsistent with the current induced magnetization switching data. The ratio of\nlongitudinal to transverse spin-orbit effective fields is found to be\ndetermined by the Ta/CoFeB interface and can be continuously tuned by changing\nthe Pt layer thickness. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is found to\nbe weak and shows an insignificant variation with the Pt thickness. The results\ndemonstrate an effective method to tune SOTs utilizing bilayer heavy metals\nwithout affecting the DMI, a desirable feature which will be useful for the\ndesign of SOT-based devices.\n", "  13\\,Tau is a rarely studied bright B9V type star ({\\sl V} = 5.68 mag), which\nshows a weak and double-peaked H{$\\alpha$} emission profile in its spectra. In\nthis study, we presented high-precision photometric data of 13\\,Tau taken by\nthe {\\sl STEREO} satellite between 2007 and 2011, and compared the results to\nthe spectroscopic findings to shed light on the Be phenomenon in the star. From\nthe frequency analysis of the five-year data, we detected that 13\\,Tau has\nexhibited a mono-periodic light variation ($f$ = 1.80487(1) cd$^{-1}$; A $\\sim$\n2.76(8) mmag). The analysis revealed that frequency and amplitude values of the\nseasonal light curves varied from one year to another. From the spectroscopic\ndata, we figured out that the equivalent widths of the H{$\\alpha$} lines also\nshowed variability, which seemed connected to the changes seen in both\nfrequency and amplitude.\n", "  The no-pumping theorem states that seemingly natural driving cycles of\nstochastic machines fail to generate directed motion. Initially derived for\nsingle particle systems, the no-pumping theorem was recently extended to\nmany-particle systems with zero-range interactions. Interestingly, it is known\nthat the theorem is violated by systems with exclusion interactions. These two\nparadigmatic interactions differ by two qualitative aspects: the range of\ninteractions, and the dependence of branching fractions on the state of the\nsystem. In this work two different models are studied in order to identify the\nqualitative property of the interaction that leads to breakdown of no-pumping.\nA model with finite-range interaction is shown analytically to satisfy\nno-pumping. In contrast, a model in which the interaction affects the\nprobabilities of reaching different sites, given that a particle is making a\ntransition, is shown numerically to violate the no-pumping theorem. The results\nsuggest that systems with interactions that lead to state-dependent branching\nfractions do not satisfy the no-pumping theorem.\n", "  Homophily can put minority groups at a disadvantage by restricting their\nability to establish links with people from a majority group. This can limit\nthe overall visibility of minorities in the network. Building on a\nBarab\\'{a}si-Albert model variation with groups and homophily, we show how the\nvisibility of minority groups in social networks is a function of (i) their\nrelative group size and (ii) the presence or absence of homophilic behavior. We\nprovide an analytical solution for this problem and demonstrate the existence\nof asymmetric behavior. Finally, we study the visibility of minority groups in\nexamples of real-world social networks: sexual contacts, scientific\ncollaboration, and scientific citation. Our work presents a foundation for\nassessing the visibility of minority groups in social networks in which\nhomophilic or heterophilic behaviour is present.\n", "  In this talk I review the current status of lattice QCD calculations at\nnonzero temperature and density. I focus on the QCD phase structure and bulk\nQCD thermodynamics at zero and nonzero chemical potentials.\n", "  An analytical wind turbine wake model is proposed to predict the wind\nvelocity distribution for all distances downwind of a wind turbine, including\nthe near-wake. This wake model augments the Jensen model and subsequent\nderivations thereof, and is a direct generalization of that recently proposed\nby Bastankhah and Porte-Agel. The model is derived by applying conservation of\nmass and momentum in the context of actuator disk theory, and assuming a\ndistribution of the double-Gaussian type for the velocity deficit in the wake.\nThe physical solutions are obtained by appropriate mixing of the waked- and\nfreestream velocity deficit solutions, reflecting the fact that only a portion\nof the fluid particles passing through the rotor disk will interact with a\nblade.\n", "  The dynamics of a passive scalar gradient experiencing fluctuating velocity\ngradient through the Lagrangian variations of strain persistence is studied. To\nthis end, a systematic, numerical analysis based on the equation for the\norientation of the gradient of a non-diffusive scalar in two-dimensional flow\nis performed. When the gradient responds weakly its orientation properties are\ndetermined by the mean value of strain persistence. Statistical alignment of\nthe scalar gradient with the direction defined by the opposed actions of strain\nand rotation, by contrast, requires the gradient to keep up with strain\npersistence fluctuations. These results have been obtained for both strain-and\neffective-rotation-dominated regimes and are supported by relevant experimental\ndata. Consequences of the unsteady behaviour of the scalar gradient on mixing\nproperties are also analyzed.\n", "  The OSIRIS camera onboard Rosetta successfully acquired images of asteroid\n2867 Steins through a variety of color filters during the flyby on 5 September\n2008. The best images of this 5 km diameter asteroid have a resolution of 78\nmeters per pixel. We process the images by deconvolving with the point spread\nfunction and enlarging through the Mitchell-Netravali filter. The enhanced set\nis analyzed by means of various techniques (PCA, band ratios, stereo anaglyphs)\nto study surface morphology and search for variegation. We identify a\nlandslide, which supports a YORP origin for Steins' unusual diamond shape. In\naddition, we find that the interior of one of two large craters on the south\npole is bluer than the rest of the body.\n", "  The nonorthogonality of coherent states is a fundamental property which\nprevents them from being perfectly and deterministically discriminated. To\ncircumvent this problem, we present an experimentally feasible protocol for the\nprobabilistic orthogonalisation of a pair of coherent states, independent of\ntheir amplitude and phase. In contrast to unambiguous state discrimination,\nsuccessful operation of our protocol is heralded without measuring the states,\nsuch that they remain suitable for further manipulation. As such, the resulting\northogonalised state may be used for further processing. Indeed, these states\nare close approximations of the discrete-variable superposition state\n$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle \\pm |1\\rangle\\right)$. This feature, coupled\nwith the non-destructive nature of the operation, is especially useful when\nconsidering superpositions of coherent states: such states are mapped to the\n(weakly squeezed) vacuum or single photon Fock state, depending on the phase of\nthe superposition. Thus this operation may find utility in hybrid\ncontinuous-discrete quantum information processing protocols.\n", "  The percentage and sequence of AT and GC base pairs and charges on the DNA\nbackbone contribute significantly to the stiffness of DNA. This elastic\nproperty of DNA also changes with small interacting ligands. The\nsingle-molecule force spectroscopy technique shows different interaction modes\nby measuring the mechanical properties of DNA bound with small ligands. When a\nds-DNA molecule is overstretched in the presence of ligands, it undergoes a\nco-operative structural transition based on the externally applied force, the\nmode of binding of the ligands, the binding constant of the ligands to the DNA,\nthe concentration of the ligands and the ionic strength of the supporting\nmedium. This leads to the changes in the regions- upto 60 pN, cooperative\nstructural transition region and the overstretched region, compared to that of\nthe FEC in the absence of any binding ligand. The cooperative structural\ntransitions were studied by the extended and twistable worm-like chain model.\nHere we have depicted these changes in persistence length and the elastic\nmodulus constant as a function of binding constant and the concentration of the\nbound ligands, which vary with time. Therefore, besides ionic strength,\ninteracting proteins and content of AT and GC base pairs, the ligand binding or\nintercalation with the ligands is an important parameter which changes the\nstiffness of DNA.\n", "  During its year-long orbital mission, the Dawn spacecraft has mapped the\nsurface of main-belt asteroid Vesta multiple times at different spatial\nresolutions and illumination and viewing angles. The onboard Framing Camera has\nacquired thousands of clear filter and narrow band images, which, with the\navailability of high-resolution global shape models, allows for a photometric\ncharacterization of the surface in unprecedented detail. We analyze clear\nfilter images to retrieve the photometric properties of the regolith. In the\nfirst part of the paper we evaluate different photometric models for the global\naverage. In the second part we use these results to study variations in albedo\nand steepness of the phase curve over the surface. Maps of these two\nphotometric parameters show large scale albedo variations, which appear to be\nassociated with compositional differences. They also reveal the location of\nphotometrically extreme terrains, where the phase curve is unusually shallow or\nsteep. We find that shallow phase curves are associated with steep slopes on\ncrater walls and faults, as calculated from a shape model. On the other hand,\nthe phase curve of ejecta associated with young impact craters is steep. We\ninterpret these variations in phase curve slope in terms of physical roughness\nof the regolith. The lack of rough ejecta around older craters suggests that\ninitially rough ejecta associated with impact craters on Vesta are smoothed\nover a relatively short time of several tens of Myr. We propose that this\nprocess is the result of impact gardening, and as such represents a previously\nunrecognized aspect of Vesta space weathering (Pieters et al., 2012). If this\ntype of space weathering is common, we may expect to encounter this photometric\nphenomenon on other main belt asteroids.\n", "  I discuss the evolution of computer architectures with a focus on QCD and\nwith reference to the interplay between architecture, engineering, data motion\nand algorithms. New architectures are discussed and recent performance results\nare displayed. I also review recent progress in multilevel solver and\nintegation algorithms.\n", "  Solid rigidity and liquid-scale mobility are thought incompatible in\nelemental substances. One cannot have an elemental solid that is long-range\npositionally ordered wherein the atoms flow like in a liquid simultaneously.\nThe only exception might be the hypothetical supersolid state of 4He. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that such exotic state could exist even in the classical\nregime. Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and ab initio path integral\nmolecular dynamics (AI-PIMD), a novel state of dense hydrogen which\nsimultaneously has both long-range spatial ordering and liquid-scale atomic\nmobility is discovered at 1~1.5 TPa (1 TPa=10000000 atmospheric pressures). The\nfeatures distinct from a normal solid and liquid are carefully characterized,\nwith the stability and melting behavior are investigated. Extensive AI-PIMD\nsimulations further revealed that this state might be (meta-)stable even at\nultra-low temperatures, suggesting an emerging candidate for an alternative\ntype of supersolid state in dense metallic hydrogen.\n", "  Simulating wave propagation on discrete grid in time domain requires the\ndescription of both the parameters of the media and the values of the wave\nfield at two different time steps within the simulated domain. For most\npractical cases this operation is very demanding on the system's memory and\nruntime. In some cases this demands renders the time domain simulation useless.\nBy using the Triggered Cells Method (TCM) one may effectively increase the\navailable memory of a given system by approximately two orders of magnitude in\nchosen scenarios, and reduce the calculation time by the same factor. The\nmethod is most applicable for pulse or bursts propagation, and can achieve\noutstanding results using single CPU, although it is easily parallelizable for\nmultiple CPU's. This paper will introduce the method using the simple case of\nthe Finite Difference Time Domain implementation of the scalar wave equation,\nalthough applicable for most differential equations under any grid type. A\nhybrid computational engine will be presented, that utilizes the Heterogenic\nBulking Method. It will be demonstrated that in most relevant cases, the\nboundary reflection problem will be resolved using the TCM, without the need to\nimplement sophisticated Phase Matching Layers.\n", "  The specific impacts of El Ni\\~no's two flavors, East Pacific (EP) and\nCentral Pacific (CP) El Ni\\~no, have been studied intensively in recent years,\nmostly by applying linear statistical or composite analyses. These techniques,\nhowever, focus on average spatio-temporal patterns of climate variability and\ndo not allow for a specific assessment of related extreme impacts. Here, we use\nevent coincidence analysis to study the differential imprints of EP and CP\ntypes of both, El Ni\\~no and La Ni\\~na on global extreme precipitation\npatterns. We provide a detailed statistical assessment of seasonal\nprecipitation extremes related to the two flavors of both phases of the El\nNi\\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in terms of their likelihood and spatial\nextent. Our analysis recaptures previously reported interrelations and uncovers\nfurther regional extremes arising along with different ENSO phases that have\nnot been reported so far.\n", "  The existence of stellar cusps in dense clusters around massive black holes\nis a fundamental, decades-old prediction of theoretical stellar dynamics. Yet,\nobservational evidence has been difficult to obtain. With a new, improved\nanalysis of high-angular resolution images of the central parsecs of the\nGalactic Center, we are finally able to provide the first solid evidence for\nthe existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's massive black hole. The\nexistence of stellar cusps has a significant impact on predicted event rates of\nphenomena like tidal disruptions of stars and extreme mass ratio inspirals.\n", "  The magnetocrystalline anisotropy exhibited in PrPd$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal\nhas been investigated by measuring the magnetization, magnetic susceptibility,\nelectrical resistivity and heat capacity. PrPd$_2$Ge$_2$ crystallizes in the\nwell known ThCr$_2$Si$_2$\\--type tetragonal structure. The antiferromagnetic\nordering is confirmed as 5.1~K with the [001]-axis as the easy axis of\nmagnetization. A superzone gap formation is observed from the electrical\nresistivity measurement when the current is passed along the [001] direction.\nThe crystal electric field (CEF) analysis on the magnetic susceptibility,\nmagnetization and the heat capacity measurements confirms a doublet ground\nstate with a relatively low over all CEF level splitting. The CEF level\nspacings and the Zeeman splitting at high fields become comparable and lead to\nmetamagnetic transition at 34~T due to the CEF level crossing.\n", "  A Hollow Electron Lens (HEL) has been proposed in order to improve\nperformance of halo control and collimation in the Large Hadron Collider in\nview of its High Luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC). The concept is based on a beam of\nelectrons that travels around the protons for a few meters. The electron beam\nis produced by a cathode and then guided by a strong magnetic field generated\nby a set of superconducting solenoids. The first step of the design is the\ndefinition of the magnetic fields that drive the electron trajectories. The\nestimation of such trajectories by means of a dedicated MATLAB tool is\npresented. The influence of the main geometrical and electrical parameters are\nanalysed and discussed. Then, the main mechanical design choices for the\nsolenoids, cryostats gun and collector are described. The aim of this paper is\nto provide an overview of the preliminary design of the Electron Lens for LHC.\nThe methods used in this study also serve as examples for future mechanical and\nintegration designs of similar devices.\n", "  The effect of radial drift rate on mean motion resonance capture is studied\nfor prograde, polar and retrograde orbits. We employ the numerical framework of\nour earlier exploration of resonance capture at arbitrary inclination. Randomly\nconstructed samples of massless particles are set to migrate radially from\noutside the orbit of a Jupiter-mass planet at different drift rates totalling\nmore than $1.6\\times 10^6$ numerical simulations. Slower drift rates reduce\noverall capture probability especially for prograde orbits and enhance capture\nat specific initial inclinations of high order resonances such as the outer\n1:5, 1:4, 1:3, 2:5, 3:7 and 5:7. Global capture is reduced with increasing\neccentricity at all inclinations as high order resonances capture more\nparticles that are subsequently lost by disruptive close encounters with the\nplanet. The relative efficiency of retrograde resonances at long-lived capture\nwith respect to prograde resonances is explained by the reduced effect of\nplanet encounters as such events occur with a shorter duration and a higher\nrelative velocity for retrograde motion. Capture in the coorbital 1:1 resonance\nis marginally affected by the radial drift rate except for nearly coplanar\nretrograde eccentric orbits whose capture likelihood is increased significantly\nwith slower drift rates. An unexpected finding is the presence of a dynamical\ncorridor for capture in high order inner prograde resonances with initial\ninclinations in the range [50$^\\circ$,80$^\\circ$] especially at the inner 5:2\nresonance whose capture likelihood peaks at 80% to 90% depending on initial\neccentricity.\n", "  We study generic properties of strongly interacting matter at finite density\nas relevant to heavy-ion collisions at moderate beam energies or the physics of\nneutron stars and their mergers. Because of the fermion-sign problem in lattice\nQCD, here we simulate QCD-like theories without this problem at finite density.\nThese theories (two-color QCD, G2-QCD, or adjoint QCD) typically contain\nbosonic baryons, for example diquarks, or other more exotic states of matter.\nIt is therefore important to understand the effects of such bosonic matter and\ndisentangle them from fermionic baryons where they exist to draw conclusions\nfor QCD. Simulations of these theories, for instance G2-QCD, reveal an\ninteresting and rich phase diagram at zero temperature. Many open questions\narise, partly due to the lack of high precision or large volume/continuum data.\nThis is the reason why we study two-dimensional QCD-like theories. In this\ncontribution we shall discuss differences between QCD-like theories at baryon\nchemical and isospin chemical potential. Furthermore we present simulation\nresults on the phase diagram and spectroscopy at finite density for G2- and\ntwo-color-QCD and compare it to free lattice fermions.\n", "  For the grating, which has depth of grooves as a small parameter, the\ndispersion equation of the Smith-Purcell instability was obtained. It was found\nthat the condition of the Thompson or the Raman regimes of excitation does not\ndepend on beam current but depends on the height of the beam above grating\nsurface. The growth rate of instability in both cases is proportional to the\nsquare root of the electron beam current.\n", "  In this paper we generalize the quantum algorithm for computing short\ndiscrete logarithms previously introduced by Eker{\\aa} so as to allow for\nvarious tradeoffs between the number of times that the algorithm need be\nexecuted on the one hand, and the complexity of the algorithm and the\nrequirements it imposes on the quantum computer on the other hand.\n  Furthermore, we describe applications of algorithms for computing short\ndiscrete logarithms. In particular, we show how other important problems such\nas those of factoring RSA integers and of finding the order of groups under\nside information may be recast as short discrete logarithm problems. This\nimmediately gives rise to an algorithm for factoring RSA integers that is less\ncomplex than Shor's general factoring algorithm in the sense that it imposes\nsmaller requirements on the quantum computer.\n  In both our algorithm and Shor's algorithm, the main hurdle is to compute a\nmodular exponentiation in superposition. When factoring an n bit integer, the\nexponent is of length 2n bits in Shor's algorithm, compared to slightly more\nthan n/2 bits in our algorithm.\n", "  Graphene-based membranes have been investigated as promising candidates for\nwater filtration and gas separation applications. Experimental evidences have\nshown that graphene oxide can be impermeable to liquids, vapors and gases,\nwhile allowing a fast permeation of water molecules. This phenomenon has been\nattributed to the formation of a network of nano capillaries that allow nearly\nfrictionless water flow while blocking other molecules by steric hindrance\neffects. It is supposed that water molecules are transported through the\npercolated two-dimensional channels formed between graphene-based sheets.\nAlthough these channels allow fast water permeation in such materials, the flow\nrates are strongly dependent on how the membranes are fabricated. Also, some\nfundamental issues regarding the nanoscale mechanisms of water permeation are\nstill not fully understood and their interpretation remains controversial. In\nthis work, we have investigated the dynamics of water permeation through\npristine graphene and graphene oxide model membranes. We have carried out fully\natomistic classical molecular dynamics simulations of systems composed of\nmultiple layered graphene-based sheets into contact with a water reservoir\nunder controlled thermodynamics conditions (e. g., by varying temperature and\npressure values). We have systematically analyzed how the transport dynamics of\nthe confined nanofluids depend on the interlayer distances and the role of the\noxide functional groups. Our results show the water flux is much more effective\nfor graphene than for graphene oxide membranes. These results are attributed to\nthe H-bonds formation between oxide functional groups and water, which traps\nthe water molecules and precludes ultrafast water transport through the\nnanochannels.\n", "  We present a novel approach based on machine learning for designing photonic\nstructures. In particular, we focus on strong light confinement that allows the\ndesign of an efficient free-space-to-waveguide coupler which is made of Si-\nslab overlying on the top of silica substrate. The learning algorithm is\nimplemented using bitwise square Si- cells and the whole optimized device has a\nfootprint of $\\boldsymbol{2 \\, \\mu m \\times 1\\, \\mu m}$, which is the smallest\nsize ever achieved numerically. To find the effect of Si- slab thickness on the\nsub-wavelength focusing and strong coupling characteristics of optimized\nphotonic structure, we carried out three-dimensional time-domain numerical\ncalculations. Corresponding optimum values of full width at half maximum and\ncoupling efficiency were calculated as $\\boldsymbol{0.158 \\lambda}$ and\n$\\boldsymbol{-1.87\\,dB}$ with slab thickness of $\\boldsymbol{280nm}$. Compared\nto the conventional counterparts, the optimized lens and coupler designs are\neasy-to-fabricate via optical lithography techniques, quite compact, and can\noperate at telecommunication wavelengths. The outcomes of the presented study\nshow that machine learning can be beneficial for efficient photonic designs in\nvarious potential applications such as polarization-division, beam manipulation\nand optical interconnects.\n", "  We investigate numerically soliton-plasma interaction in a noble-gas-filled\nsilica hollow-core anti-resonant fiber pumped in the mid-IR at 3.0 {\\mu}m. We\nobserve multiple soliton self-compression stages due to distinct stages where\neither the self-focusing or the self-defocusing nonlinearity dominates.\nSpecifically, the parameters may be tuned so the competing plasma\nself-defocusing nonlinearity only dominates over the Kerr self-focusing\nnonlinearity around the soliton self-compression stage, where the increasing\npeak intensity on the leading pulse edge initiates a competing self-defocusing\nplasma nonlinearity acting nonlocally on the trailing edge, effectively\npreventing soliton-formation there. As the plasma switches off after the\nself-compression stage, self-focusing dominates again, initiating another\nsoliton self-compression stage in the trailing edge. This process is\naccompanied by supercontinuum generation spanning 1-4 {\\mu}m. The technique\ncould be exploited to generate an ultrafast sequence of several few-cycle\npulses.\n", "  This document presents the refurbishment project for GILDA, the Italian CRG\nbeamline at the ESRF. After a short introduction to the beamline and its\nachievements in the last years, the base ideas and concepts driving the design\nare exposed whereas a more detailed technical description of the new instrument\nis given in a further section. An analysis of the costs and a schedule for the\nimplementation of the program is also presented in the last part of the\ndocument.\n", "  Comment on a letter to Nature Physics, where Sakmann and Kasevich claim to\nsolve the many-body time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation to simulate single\nexperimental runs of interacting quantum systems.\n", "  The Dark Ages Radio Experiment (DARE) seeks to study the cosmic Dark Ages\napproximately 80 to 420 million years after the Big Bang. Observations require\ntruly quiet radio conditions, shielded from Sun and Earth electromagnetic (EM)\nemissions, on the far side of the Moon. DARE's science orbit is a frozen orbit\nwith respect to lunar gravitational perturbations. The altitude and orientation\nof the orbit remain nearly fixed indefinitely, maximizing science time without\nthe need for maintenance. DARE's observation targets avoid the galactic center\nand enable investigation of the universe's first stars and galaxies.\n", "  The phenomenological universalities (PU) are extended to include\ntime-depended quantum oscillatory phenomena, coherence and supersymmetry. It\nwill be proved that this approach generates minimum uncertainty coherent states\nof time-dependent oscillators, which in the dissociation (classical) limit\nreduce to the functions describing growth (regression) of the systems evolving\nover time. The results obtained reveal existence of a new class of macroscopic\nquantum (or quasi-quantum) phenomena, which may play a vital role in coherent\nformation of the specific growth patterns in complex systems.\n", "  The development of nanoplasmonic devices, such as plasmonic circuits and\nmetamaterial superlenses in the visible to ultraviolet frequency range, is\nhampered by the lack of low-loss plasmonic media. Recently, strong plasmonic\nresponse was reported in a certain class of topological insulators. Here, we\npresent a first-principles density functional theory analysis of the dielectric\nfunctions of topologically insulating quaternary (Bi,Sb)2(Te,Se)3\ntrichalcogenide compounds. Bulk plasmonic properties, dominated by interband\ntransitions, are observed from 2-3 eV and extend to higher frequencies.\nMoreover, trichalcogenide compounds are better plasmonic media than gold and\nsilver at blue and UV wavelengths. By analysing thin slabs, we also show that\nthese materials exhibit topologically protected surface states, which are\ncapable of supporting propagating plasmon polariton modes over an extremely\nbroad spectral range, from the visible to the mid-infrared and beyond, owing to\na combination of inter- and intra-surface band transitions.\n", "  We present a determination of the corrections to Dashen's theorem and of the\nindividual up and down quark masses from a lattice calculation based on\nquenched QED and $N_f=2+1$ QCD simulations with 5 lattice spacings down to\n0.054 fm. The simulations feature lattice sizes up to 6 fm and average up-down\nquark masses all the way down to their physical value. For the parameter which\nquantifies violations to Dashens's theorem we obtain $\\epsilon=0.73(2)(5)(17)$,\nwhere the first error is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third\nis an estimate of the QED quenching error. For the light quark masses we\nobtain, $m_u=2.27(6)(5)(4) \\, MeV$ and $m_d=4.67(6)(5)(4) \\, MeV$ in the\n$\\overline{MS}$ scheme at $2 \\, GeV$ and the isospin breaking ratios\n$m_u/m_d=0.485(11)(8)(14)$, $R=38.2(1.1)(0.8)(1.4)$ and\n$Q=23.4(0.4)(0.3)(0.4)$. Our results exclude the $m_u=0$ solution to the strong\nCP problem by more than 24 standard deviations.\n", "  We review two lattice calculations involving charm hadrons: a determination\nof the vector and scalar form factors of the semileptonic $D \\to \\pi \\ell \\nu$\ndecays, which are relevant for the extraction of the CKM matrix element $\\lvert\nV_{cd} \\rvert$ from experimental data, and a calculation of the matrix elements\nof four-fermion operators relevant to the description of the neutral D mixing\nin the Standard Model and its extensions. Both analyses are based on the gauge\nconfigurations produced by the European Twisted Mass Collaboration with $N_f =\n2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of dynamical quarks. We simulated at three different values\nof the lattice spacing and with pion masses as small as 210 MeV.\n", "  The SLAC T-510 experiment was designed to reproduce the physics of radio\nemission from air showers caused by ultra-high energy cosmic rays in a\ncontrolled lab experiment with the goal to test established formalisms for\nsimulation of radio emission physics: the \"end-point\" formalism and the \"ZHS\"\nformalism. Simulation results derived with these formalisms can be explained by\na superposition of magnetically induced transverse current radiation and the\nAskaryan (charge-excess) effect. Here, we present results of Geant4 simulations\nof the experiment with both formalisms, taking into account the details of the\nexperimental setup (beam energy, target geometry and material, magnetic field\nconfiguration, and refraction effects) to test this hypothesis\n", "  These notes are an introduction to General Relativity as a Quantum Effective\nField Theory, following the material given in a short course on the subject at\nEPFL. The intent is to develop General Relativity starting from a quantum field\ntheoretic viewpoint, and to introduce some of the techniques needed to\nunderstand the subject.\n", "  Understanding the structure of ZnO surface reconstructions and their\nresultant properties is crucial to the rational design of ZnO-containing\ndevices ranging from optoelectronics to catalysts. Here, we are motivated by\nrecent experimental work which showed a new surface reconstruction containing\nZn vacancies ordered in a Zn(3x3) pattern in the subsurface of (0001)-O\nterminated ZnO. A reconstruction with Zn vacancies on (0001)-O is surprising\nand counterintuitive because Zn vacancies enhance the surface dipole rather\nthan reduce it. In this work, we show using Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nthat subsurface Zn vacancies can form on (0001)-O when coupled with adsorption\nof surface H and are in fact stable under a wide range of common conditions. We\nalso show these vacancies have a significant ordering tendency and that\nSb-doping created subsurface inversion domain boundaries (IDBs) enhances the\ndriving force of Zn vacancy alignment into large domains of the Zn(3x3)\nreconstruction.\n", "  We take a step towards characterising stationary data for the vacuum Einstein\nequations, by finding a necessary condition on initial data for which the\nevolution is a solution of the vacuum equations admitting a Killing vector,\nwhich is time-like at least in some region of the Cauchy development.\n", "  Results on the thermal transition of QCD with 3 degenerate flavors, in the\nlower-left corner of the Columbia plot, are puzzling. The transition is\nexpected to be first-order for massless quarks, and to remain so for a range of\nquark masses until it turns second-order at a critical quark mass. But this\ncritical quark mass and resulting \"pion\" mass disagree violently between Wilson\nand staggered fermions at finite lattice spacing, and decrease sharply with the\nlattice spacing, for staggered fermions at least. To clarify this puzzle and\neliminate potential systematic effects from rooting, we study the 4-flavor\ntheory with staggered fermions, on lattices with 4 to 10 time-slices. Our\nresults are qualitatively similar to the 3-flavor case, so that rooting is not\nan issue. However, dramatic cutoff effects are visible, even on our finest\nlattices. Universality implies that cutoff effects for Wilson fermions are even\nmore dramatic. In order to obtain a first-order thermal transition in the\ncontinuum theory, extremely light quarks are needed.\n", "  Superhydrophobicity is connected to the presence of gas pockets within\nsurface asperities. Upon increasing the pressure this \"suspended\" state may\ncollapse, causing the complete wetting of the rough surface. In order to\nquantitatively characterize this process on nanostructured surfaces, we perform\nrare-event atomistic simulations at different pressures and for several texture\ngeometries. Such approach allows us to identify for each pressure the stable\nand metastable states and the free energy barriers separating them. Results\nshow that, by starting from the superhydrophobic state and increasing the\npressure, the suspended state abruptly collapses at a critical intrusion\npressure. If the pressure is subsequently decreased, the system remains trapped\nin the metastable state corresponding to the wet surface. The liquid can be\nextruded from the nanostructures only at very negative pressures, by reaching\nthe critical extrusion pressure (spinodal for the confined liquid). The\nintrusion and extrusion curves form a hysteresis cycle determined by the large\nfree energy barriers separating the suspended and wet state. These barriers,\nwhich grow very quickly for pressures departing from the intrusion/extrusion\npressure, are shown to strongly depend on the texture geometry.\n", "  Bristle bots are vibration-driven robots actuated by the motion of an\ninternal oscillating mass. Vibrations are translated into directed locomotion\ndue to the alternating friction resistance between robots' bristles and the\nsubstrate during oscillations. Bristle bots are, in general, unidirectional\nlocomotion systems. In this paper we demonstrate that motion direction of\nvertically vibrated bristle systems can be controlled by tuning the frequency\nof their oscillatory actuation. We report theoretical and experimental results\nobtained by studying an equivalent system, consisting of an inactive robot\nplaced on a vertically vibrating substrate.\n", "  We have developed a fully sparse, compact-scheme based biglobal stability\nanalysis numerical solver applied, for the scope of the current paper, to the\ninvestigation of the effects of impedance boundary conditions (IBCs) on the\nstructure of a fully developed compressible turbulent channel flow. A\nsixth-order compact finite difference scheme is used to discretize the\nlinearized Navier-Stokes equations leading to a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem\n(GEVP). Sparsity is retained by explicitly introducing derivatives of the\nperturbation as additional unknowns, increasing the overall problem size\n(number of columns $\\times$ number of rows) while significantly reducing the\nnumber of non-zeros and the computational cost with respect to traditional\nimplementations yielding otherwise dense matrix blocks. The resulting GEVP is\ncoded in Python and solved employing an Message Passing Interface (MPI)\nparallelized PETSc-based sparse eigenvalue solver adopting a modified Arnoldi\nalgorithm. Base flow is taken from impermeable isothermal-wall turbulent\nchannel flow simulations at bulk Reynolds number, $Re_b= 6900$ and Mach number,\n$M_b = 0.85$. The eigenvalue spectrum calculated in the biglobal stability\nanalysis shows distinct groups of modes associated with a discrete set of\nstreamwise wave numbers accommodated by computational domain. An iterative\nstrategy for the imposition of the complex IBCs, which are a nonlinear function\nof the real-valued (Fourier) frequency in the GEVP, has been devised. The\nadopted IBC specifically represents an array of sub-surface-mounted Helmholtz\ncavities with resonant frequency, $f_{res}$, covered by a porous sheet with\npermeability inversely proportional to the impedance resistance $R$. The\ntunable resonant frequency has been shown to be an attractor for the\ninstability, yielding a single unstable mode at that frequency.\n", "  Synthetic biological macromolecule of magnetoferritin containing an iron\noxide core inside a protein shell (apoferritin) is prepared with different\ncontent of iron. Its structure in aqueous solution is analyzed by small-angle\nsynchrotron X-ray (SAXS) and neutron (SANS) scattering. The loading factor (LF)\ndefined as the average number of iron atoms per protein is varied up to LF=800.\nWith an increase of the LF, the scattering curves exhibit a relative increase\nin the total scattered intensity, a partial smearing and a shift of the match\npoint in the SANS contrast variation data. The analysis shows an increase in\nthe polydispersity of the proteins and a corresponding effective increase in\nthe relative content of magnetic material against the protein moiety of the\nshell with the LF growth. At LFs above ~150, the apoferritin shell undergoes\nstructural changes, which is strongly indicative of the fact that the shell\nstability is affected by iron oxide presence.\n", "  We present preliminary calculations towards radiative transitions in\ncharmonium using anisotropic $N_f = 2 + 1$ dynamical ensembles generated by the\nHadron Spectrum Collaboration. With the use of newer technologies we aim to\ninvestigate transitions between states, including potential exotic charmonium\nstates, lying higher in the spectrum than in previous studies. A crucial\ningredient in this work is the use of variationally optimised interpolating\noperators which allow for a reliable determination of the three-point\ncorrelation functions needed. Using these operators, we perform first\ncalculations of relevant three-point correlation functions before discussing\nfuture directions.\n", "  The three-sphere swimmer by Najafi and Golestanian is composed of three\nspheres connected by two arms. The case in which the swimmer can control the\nlengths of the two arms has been studied in detail. Here we study a variation\nof the model in which the swimmer's arms are constructed according to Hill's\nmodel of muscular contraction. The swimmer is able to control the tension\ndeveloped in the active components of the arms. The two shape parameters and\nthe tensions acting on the two arms are then obtained by solving a system of\nordinary differential equations. We study the qualitative properties of the\nsolutions, compute analytically their leading order approximation and compare\nthem with numerical simulations. We also formulate and solve some optimisation\nproblems, aimed at finding the actuation strategies maximising performance, for\nvarious performance measures. Finally, we discuss the structure of the\ngoverning equations of our microswimmers from the point of view of control\ntheory. We show that our systems are control affine systems with drift.\n", "  Mesoporous silica particles of MCM-41 type were synthesized by sol-gel method\nfrom tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in 2-methoxyethanol and deionized water\nmixture in base conditions at room temperature. Ammonia or sodium hydroxides\nwere used as catalysts and cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and\nn-dodecyl-trimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) as structure directing agents. The\nporosities and the ordered structure have been analyzed using transmission and\nscanning electron microscopy, small angle neutron and X-ray diffraction,\nnitrogen adsorption, thermal analysis and FTIR spectroscopy. The samples\nconsist of spherical particles of sub-micrometer size, with radially arranged\npores. The comparison of the effect of the different surfactants and catalysts\nshows that by varying the surfactant type and their proportion, the pore sizes\ncan be controlled. As compared to the commonly used ammonia catalyst, the use\nof NaOH as catalyst results in a much smaller porosity of the as-prepared\nmaterials. These materials are not resisting to the heat treatment at 700 C\nused for the template removal, and the ordered porous structure is completely\nlost.\n", "  Many phenomena in collisionless plasma physics require a kinetic description.\nThe evolution of the phase space density can be modeled by means of the Vlasov\nequation, which has to be solved numerically in most of the relevant cases. One\nof the problems that often arise in such simulations is the violation of\nimportant physical conservation laws. Numerical diffusion in phase space\ntranslates into unphysical heating, which can increase the overall energy\nsignificantly, depending on the time scale and the plasma regime. In this\npaper, a general and straightforward way of improving conservation properties\nof Vlasov schemes is presented that can potentially be applied to a variety of\ndifferent codes. The basic idea is to use fluid models with good conservation\nproperties for correcting kinetic models. The higher moments that are missing\nin the fluid models are provided by the kinetic codes, so that both kinetic and\nfluid codes compensate the weaknesses of each other in a closed feedback loop.\n", "  We examine some of the complications involved when combining (matching) TMD\nfactorization with collinear factorization to allow accurate predictions over\nthe whole range of measured transverse momentum in a process like Drell-Yan.\nThen we propose some improved methods for combining the two types of\nfactorization. (This talk is based on work reported in arXiv:1605.00671.)\n", "  A novel system containing nanoporous materials and carbonate ions is\nproposed, which is capable to capture CO2 from ambient air simply by\ncontrolling the amount of water (humidity) in the system. The system absorbs\nCO2 from the air when the surrounding is dry, whereas desorbs CO2 when wet. A\ndesign of such a CO2 absorption/desorption system is investigated in this paper\nusing molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics simulations, and also verified\nby experiments. Its working mechanism is revealed as the reduction of free\nenergy of the carbonate ion hydrolysis with the decrease of the number of water\nmolecules in confined nano-pores. The influences of pore size, spacing of\ncations, surface hydrophobicity and temperature on CO2 capture efficiency are\nelucidated. The study may help to design an efficient direct air capture system\nand contribute to the negative carbon emission.\n", "  The clustering phenomena is very important to determine structure of light\nnuclei and deformation of spherical shape is inevitable. Hence, we calculated\nthe energy levels of two-center Gaussian potential well including spin-orbit\ncoupling by solving the Schr\\\"odinger equation in the cylindrical coordinates.\nThis model could predict the spin and parity of the light nucleus that have\ncluster structure consist of two identical clusters.\n"]}
