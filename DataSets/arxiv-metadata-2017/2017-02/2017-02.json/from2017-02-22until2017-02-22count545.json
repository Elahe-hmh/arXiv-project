afterglow of GRB 060904A with the Swift and Suzaku\nsatellites. We found rapid spectral softening during both the prompt tail phase\nand the decline phase of an X-ray flare in the BAT and XRT data. The observed\nspectra were fit by power-law photon indices which rapidly changed from $\\Gamma\n= 1.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ to $\\Gamma = 5.30^{+0.69}_{-0.59}$ within a few hundred\nseconds in the prompt tail. This is one of the steepest X-ray spectra ever\nobserved, making it quite difficult to explain by simple electron acceleration\nand synchrotron radiation. Then, we applied an alternative spectral fitting\nusing a broken power-law with exponential cutoff (BPEC) model. It is valid to\nconsider the situation that the cutoff energy is equivalent to the synchrotron\nfrequency of the maximum energy electrons in their energy distribution. Since\nthe spectral cutoff appears in the soft X-ray band, we conclude the electron\nacceleration has been inefficient in the internal shocks of GRB 060904A. These\ncutoff spectra suddenly disappeared at the transition time from the prompt tail\nphase to the shallow decay one. After that, typical afterglow spectra with the\nphoton indices of 2.0 are continuously and preciously monitored by both XRT and\nSuzaku/XIS up to 1 day since the burst trigger time. We could successfully\ntrace the temporal history of two characteristic break energies (peak energy\nand cutoff energy) and they show the time dependence of $\\propto t^{-3} \\sim\nt^{-4}$ while the following afterglow spectra are quite stable. This fact\nindicates that the emitting material of prompt tail is due to completely\ndifferent dynamics from the shallow decay component. Therefore we conclude the\nemission sites of two distinct phenomena obviously differ from each other.\n", "  A three- and five-component nonlinear Schrodinger-type models, which describe\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's) with hyperfine structures F=1 and F=2\nrespectively, are studied. These models for particular values of the coupling\nconstants are integrable by the inverse scattering method. They are related to\nsymmetric spaces of BD.I-type SO(2r+1)/(SO(2) x SO(2r-1)) for r=2 and r=3.\nUsing conveniently modified Zakharov-Shabat dressing procedure we obtain\ndifferent types of soliton solutions.\n", "  We study a particle system with hopping (random walk) dynamics on the integer\nlattice $\\mathbb Z^d$. The particles can exist in two states, active or\ninactive (sleeping); only the former can hop. The dynamics conserves the number\nof particles; there is no limit on the number of particles at a given site.\nIsolated active particles fall asleep at rate $\\lambda > 0$, and then remain\nasleep until joined by another particle at the same site. The state in which\nall particles are inactive is absorbing. Whether activity continues at long\ntimes depends on the relation between the particle density $\\zeta$ and the\nsleeping rate $\\lambda$. We discuss the general case, and then, for the\none-dimensional totally asymmetric case, study the phase transition between an\nactive phase (for sufficiently large particle densities and/or small $\\lambda$)\nand an absorbing one. We also present arguments regarding the asymptotic mean\nhopping velocity in the active phase, the rate of fixation in the absorbing\nphase, and survival of the infinite system at criticality. Using mean-field\ntheory and Monte Carlo simulation, we locate the phase boundary. The phase\ntransition appears to be continuous in both the symmetric and asymmetric\nversions of the process, but the critical behavior is very different. The\nformer case is characterized by simple integer or rational values for critical\nexponents ($\\beta = 1$, for example), and the phase diagram is in accord with\nthe prediction of mean-field theory. We present evidence that the symmetric\nversion belongs to the universality class of conserved stochastic sandpiles,\nalso known as conserved directed percolation. Simulations also reveal an\ninteresting transient phenomenon of damped oscillations in the activity\ndensity.\n", "  Using public \\fermi LAT and \\swift BAT observations, we constructed the first\nsample of blazars selected at both hard X-rays and gamma-rays. Studying its\nspectral properties, we find a luminosity dependence of the spectral slopes at\nboth energies. Specifically, luminous blazars, generally classified as FSRQs,\nhave {\\it hard} continua in the medium-hard X-ray range but {\\it soft} continua\nin the LAT gamma-ray range (photon indices $\\Gamma_X$ \\ltsima 2 and $\\Gamma_G$\n\\gtsima 2), while lower luminosity blazars, classified as BL Lacs, have\nopposite behavior, i.e., {\\it soft} X-ray and {\\it hard} gamma-ray continua\n($\\Gamma_X$ \\gtsima 2.4 and $\\Gamma_G < 2$). The trends are confirmed by\ndetailed Monte Carlo simulations explicitly taking into account the\nobservational biases of both instruments. Our results support the so-called\n``blazar sequence'' which was originally based on radio samples of blazars and\nradio luminosities. We also argue that the X-ray-to-gamma-ray continua of\nblazars may provide independent insights into the physical conditions around\nthe jet, complementing/superseding the ambiguities of the traditional\nclassification based on optical properties.\n", "  We present the historic photographic light curves of three little known\nBlazars (two BL Lacs and one FSRQ), BZB J1058+5628, BZQ J1148+5254 and BZB\nJ1209+4119 spanning a time interval of about 50 years, mostly built using the\nAsiago plate archive. All objects show evident long-term variability, over\nwhich short-term variations are superposed. One source, BZB J1058+5628, showed\na marked quasi-periodic variability of 1 mag on time scale of about 6.3 years,\nmaking it one of the few BL Lac objects with a quasi-periodic behavior.\n", "  We discuss outer gap closure mechanism in the trans-field direction with the\nmagnetic pair-creation process near the stellar surface. The gap closure by the\nmagnetic pair-creation is possible if some fraction of the pairs are produced\nwith an outgoing momentum. By assuming that multiple magnetic field will affect\nthe local field near the stellar surface, we show a specific magnetic field\ngeometry near the stellar surface resulting in the outflow of the pairs.\nTogether with the fact that the electric field is weak below null charge\nsurface, the characteristic curvature photon energy emitted by incoming\nparticles, which were accelerated in the outer gap, decreases drastically to\n$\\sim 100$MeV near the stellar surface. We estimate the height measured from\nthe last-open field line, above which 100MeV photons is converted into pairs by\nthe magnetic pair-creation. We also show the resultant multiplicity due to the\nmagnetic pair-creation process could acquire $M_{e^{\\pm}}\\sim 10^4-10^5$. In\nthis model the fractional outer gap size is proportional to $P^{-1/2}$. The\npredicted gamma-ray luminosity ($L_{\\gamma}$) and the characteristic curvature\nphoton energy ($E_c$) emitted from the outer gap are proportional to\n$B^2P^{-5/2}$ and $B^{3/4}P^{-1}$ respectively. This model also predicts that\n$L_{\\gamma}$ and $E_c$ are related to the spin down power ($L_{sd}$) or the\nspin down age of pulsars ($\\tau$) as $L_{\\gamma} \\propto L_{sd}^{5/8}$ or\n$L_{\\gamma} \\propto \\tau^{-5/4}$, and $E_c \\propto L_{sd}^{1/4}$ or $E_c\n\\propto \\tau^{-1/2}$ respectively.\n", "  We present a new model for the spectral evolution of Pulsar Wind Nebulae\ninside Supernova Remnants. The model couples the long-term dynamics of these\nsystems, as derived in the 1-D approximation, with a 1-zone description of the\nspectral evolution of the emitting plasma. Our goal is to provide a simplified\ntheoretical description that can be used as a tool to put constraints on\nunknown properties of PWN-SNR systems: a piece of work that is preliminary to\nany more accurate and sophisticated modeling. In the present paper we apply the\nnewly developed model to a few objects of different ages and luminosities. We\nfind that an injection spectrum in the form of a broken-power law gives a\nsatisfactory description of the emission for all the systems we consider. More\nsurprisingly, we also find that the intrinsic spectral break turns out to be at\na similar energy for all sources, in spite of the differences mentioned above.\nWe discuss the implications of our findings on the workings of pulsar\nmagnetospheres, pair multiplicity and on the particle acceleration mechanism(s)\nthat might be at work at the pulsar wind termination shock.\n", "  Aims: To provide a significantly improved probability distribution for the\nH-test for periodicity in X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray arrival times, which is\nalready extensively used by the $\\gamma$-ray pulsar community. Also, to obtain\nan analytical probability distribution for stacked test statistics in the case\nof a search for pulsed emission from an ensemble of pulsars where the\nsignificance per pulsar is relatively low, making individual detections\ninsignificant on their own. This information is timely given the recent rapid\ndiscovery of new pulsars with the Fermi-LAT t $\\gamma$-ray telescope. Methods:\nApproximately $10^{14}$ realisations of the H-statistic ($H$) for random\n(white) noise is calculated from a random number generator for which the\nrepitition cycle is $\\gg 10^{14}$. From these numbers the probability\ndistribution $P(>H)$ is calculated. Results: The distribution of $H$ is is\nfound to be exponential with parameter $\\lambda=0.4$ so that the cumulative\nprobability distribution $P(>H)=\\exp{(-\\lambda H)}$. If we stack independent\nvalues for $H$, the sum of $K$ such values would follow the Erlang-K\ndistribution with parameter $\\lambda$ for which the cumulative probability\ndistribution is also a simple analytical expression. Conclusion: Searches for\nweak pulsars with unknown pulse profile shapes in the Fermi-LAT, Agile or other\nX-ray data bases should benefit from the {\\it H-test} since it is known to be\npowerful against a broad range of pulse profiles, which introduces only a\nsingle statistical trial if only the {\\it H-test} is used. The new probability\ndistribution presented here favours the detection of weaker pulsars in terms of\nan improved sensitivity relative to the previously known distribution.\n", "  We study the capabilities of the Fermi-LAT instrument on board of the Fermi\nmission to constrain particle dark matter properties, as annihilation cross\nsection, mass and branching ratio into dominant annihilation channels, with\ngamma-ray observations from the galactic center. Besides the prompt gamma-ray\nflux, we also take into account the contribution from the electrons/positrons\nproduced in dark matter annihilations to the gamma-ray signal via inverse\nCompton scattering off the interstellar photon background, which turns out to\nbe crucial in the case of dark matter annihilations into mu+mu- and e+e- pairs.\nWe study the signal dependence on different parameters like the region of\nobservation, the density profile, the assumptions for the dark matter model and\nthe uncertainties in the propagation model. We also show the effect of the\ninclusion of a 20% systematic uncertainty in the gamma-ray background. If\nFermi-LAT is able to distinguish a possible dark matter signal from the large\ngamma-ray background, we show that for dark matter masses below ~200 GeV,\nFermi-LAT will likely be able to determine dark matter properties with good\naccuracy.\n", "  Analysis is presented on 15 months of data taken with the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope for 11 non-blazar AGNs,\nincluding 7 FRI radio galaxies and 4 FRII radio sources consisting of 2 FRII\nradio galaxies and 2 steep spectrum radio quasars. The broad line FRI radio\ngalaxy 3C 120 is reported here as a gamma-ray source for the first time. The\nanalysis is based on directional associations of LAT sources with radio sources\nin the 3CR, 3CRR and MS4 (collectively referred to as 3C-MS) catalogs. Seven of\nthe eleven LAT sources associated with 3C-MS radio sources have spectral\nindices larger than 2.3 and, except for the FRI radio galaxy NGC 1275 that\nshows possible spectral curvature, are well described by a power law. No\nevidence for time variability is found for any sources other than NGC 1275. The\ngamma-ray luminosities of FRI radio galaxies are significantly smaller than\nthose of BL Lac objects detected by the LAT, whereas the gamma-ray luminosities\nof FRII sources are quite similar to those of FSRQs, which could reflect\ndifferent beaming factors for the gamma-ray emission. A core dominance study of\nthe 3CRR sample indicate that sources closer to the jet axis are preferentially\ndetected with the Fermi-LAT, insofar as the gamma-ray--detected misaligned AGNs\nhave larger core dominance at a given average radio flux. The results are\ndiscussed in view of the AGN unification scenario.\n", "  The flux of gamma rays with energies >100MeV is dominated by diffuse emission\nfrom CRs illuminating the ISM of our Galaxy through the processes of\nBremsstrahlung, pion production and decay, and inverse-Compton scattering. The\nstudy of this diffuse emission provides insight into the origin and transport\nof CRs. We searched for gamma-ray emission from the SMC in order to derive\nconstraints on the CR population and transport in an external system with\nproperties different from the Milky Way. We analysed the first 17 months of\ncontinuous all-sky observations by the Large Area Telescope of the Fermi\nmission to determine the spatial distribution, flux and spectrum of the\ngamma-ray emission from the SMC. We also used past radio synchrotron\nobservations of the SMC to study the population of CR electrons specifically.\nWe obtained the first detection of the SMC in high-energy gamma rays, with an\nintegrated >100MeV flux of (3.7 +/-0.7) x10e-8 ph/cm2/s, with additional\nsystematic uncertainty of <16%. The emission is steady and from an extended\nsource ~3{\\deg} in size. It is not clearly correlated with the distribution of\nmassive stars or neutral gas, nor with known pulsars or SNRs, but a certain\ncorrelation with supergiant shells is observed. The observed flux implies an\nupper limit on the average CR nuclei density in the SMC of ~15% of the value\nmeasured locally in the Milky Way. The population of high-energy pulsars of the\nSMC may account for a substantial fraction of the gamma-ray flux, which would\nmake the inferred CR nuclei density even lower. The average density of CR\nelectrons derived from radio synchrotron observations is consistent with the\nsame reduction factor but the uncertainties are large. From our current\nknowledge of the SMC, such a low CR density does not seem to be due to a lower\nrate of CR injection and rather indicates a smaller CR confinement volume\ncharacteristic size.\n", "  Mechanisms of the formation and stability of sunspots are among the\nlongest-standing and intriguing puzzles of solar physics and astrophysics.\nSunspots are controlled by subsurface dynamics hidden from direct observations.\nRecently, substantial progress in our understanding of the physics of the\nturbulent magnetized plasma in strong-field regions has been made by using\nnumerical simulations and local helioseismology. Both the simulations and\nhelioseismic measurements are extremely challenging, but it becomes clear that\nthe key to understanding the enigma of sunspots is a synergy between models and\nobservations. Recent observations and radiative MHD numerical models have\nprovided a convincing explanation to the Evershed flows in sunspot penumbrae.\nAlso, they lead to the understanding of sunspots as self-organized magnetic\nstructures in the turbulent plasma of the upper convection zone, which are\nmaintained by a large-scale dynamics. Local helioseismic diagnostics of\nsunspots still have many uncertainties, some of which are discussed in this\nreview. However, there have been significant achievements in resolving these\nuncertainties, verifying the basic results by new high-resolution observations,\ntesting the helioseismic techniques by numerical simulations, and comparing\nresults obtained by different methods. For instance, a recent analysis of\nhelioseismology data from the Hinode space mission has successfully resolved\nseveral uncertainties and concerns (such as the inclined-field and phase-speed\nfiltering effects) that might affect the inferences of the subsurface\nwave-speed structure of sunspots and the flow pattern. It becomes clear that\nfor the understanding of the phenomenon of sunspots it is important to further\nimprove the helioseismology methods and investigate the whole life cycle of\nactive regions, from magnetic-flux emergence to dissipation.\n", "  We prepared a buoyancy matched binary mixture of polydisperse polystyrene\nmicrogel spheres of size ratio 0.785 and at a volume fraction of 0.567 just\nbelow the kinetic glass transition. In line with theoretical expectations, a\neutectic phase behavior was observed, but only a minor fraction of the samples\ncrystallized at all. By adding a short non-adsorbing polymer we enforce\ninter-species fractionation into coexisting pure component crystals, which in\nturn also shows signs of intra-species fractionation. We show that in formerly\ninaccessible regions of the phase diagram binary hard sphere physics is made\nobservable using attractive hard spheres.\n  Ancillary files: Correction to Soft Matter 2012, 8, 627\n", "  The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C 454.3 underwent an extraordinary 5-day\ngamma-ray outburst in November 2010 where the daily flux measured with the\nFermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) at photon energies E>100 MeV reached (66+/-2)\nx 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1. This is a factor of 3 higher than its previous maximum\nflux recorded in December 2009 and ~5 times brighter than the Vela pulsar,\nwhich is normally the brightest source in the gamma-ray sky. The 3-hr peak flux\nwas (85+/-5) x 10^-6 ph cm^-2 s^-1, corresponding to an apparent isotropic\nluminosity of 2.1+/-0.2 10^50 erg s^-1, the highest ever recorded for a blazar.\nIn this paper, we investigate the features of this exceptional event in the\ngamma-ray band of the Fermi-LAT. In contrast to previous flares of the same\nsource observed with the Fermi-LAT, clear spectral changes are observed during\nthe flare.\n", "  The population of $\\gamma$-ray emitting millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is studied\nby using Monte-Carlo techniques. We simulate the Galactic distributions of the\nMSPs, and apply the outer gap model for the $\\gamma$-ray emission from each\nsimulated MSP. We take into account the dependence of the observed $\\gamma$-ray\nflux on the viewing angle and inclination angle, which is the angle between the\nrotation axis and the magnetic axis, respectively. Using the sensitivity of the\nsix-month long observation of the $Fermi$ telescope and radio sensitivities of\nexisting pulsar surveys, 9-13 radio-selected and 22-35 $\\gamma$-ray-selected\npulsars are detected within our simulation. The statistical properties of the\nsimulated population are consistent with the $Fermi$ observations. Scaling the\nobserved sensitivity $\\propto \\sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the length of observation\ntime, the present model predicts that over the 5-year mission $Fermi$ would\ndetect 15-22 radio-selected $\\gamma$-ray MSPs, and 95-152 $\\gamma$-ray-selected\nMSPs. Our simulation also predicts that about 100 (or 200-300) $\\gamma$-ray\nMSPs with a flux larger $F\\ge 10^{-11}~\\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$ (or $5\\times\n10^{-12}~\\mathrm{erg/cm^2 s}$) irradiate the Earth. With the present\nsensitivities of the radio surveys, most of them are categorized as\n$\\gamma$-ray-selected pulsars, indicating that most of the $\\gamma$-ray MSPs\nhave been missed by the present $Fermi$ observations. We argue that the\nGalactic $Fermi$ unidentified sources located at high latitudes should be\ndominated by MSPs, whereas the sources in the galactic plane are dominated by\nradio-quiet canonical pulsars.\n", "  The GOES M2-class solar flare, SOL2010-06-12T00:57, was modest in many\nrespects yet exhibited remarkable acceleration of energetic particles. The\nflare produced an ~50 s impulsive burst of hard X- and \\gamma-ray emission up\nto at least 400 MeV observed by the Fermi GBM and LAT experiments. The\nremarkably similar hard X-ray and high-energy \\gamma-ray time profiles suggest\nthat most of the particles were accelerated to energies >300 MeV with a delay\nof ~10 s from mildly relativistic electrons, but some reached these energies in\nas little as ~3 s. The \\gamma-ray line fluence from this flare was about ten\ntimes higher than that typically observed from this modest GOES class of X-ray\nflare. There is no evidence for time-extended >100 MeV emission as has been\nfound for other flares with high-energy \\gamma rays.\n", "  Let $M$ be a compact real-analytic manifold, equipped with a real-analytic\nRiemannian metric $g,$ and let $\\beta$ be a closed real-analytic 2-form on $M$,\ninterpreted as a magnetic field. Consider the Hamiltonian flow on $T^*M$ that\ndescribes a charged particle moving in the magnetic field $\\beta$. Following an\nidea of T. Thiemann, we construct a complex structure on a tube inside $T^*M$\nby pushing forward the vertical polarization by the Hamiltonian flow \"evaluated\nat time $i$.\" This complex structure fits together with $\\omega-\\pi^*\\beta$ to\ngive a Kaehler structure on a tube inside $T^*M$. We describe this magnetic\ncomplex structure in terms of its $(1,0)$-tangent bundle, at the level of\nholomorphic functions, and via a construction using the embeddings of\nWhitney-Bruhat and Grauert, which is a magnetic analogue to the analytic\ncontinuation of the geometric exponential map. We describe an antiholomorphic\nintertwiner between this complex structure and the complex structure induced by\n$-\\beta$, and we give two formulas for local Kaehler potentials, which depend\non a local choice of vector potential 1-form for $\\beta$. When $\\beta=0$, our\nmagnetic complex structure is the adapted complex structure of\nLempert-Sz\\H{o}ke and Guillemin-Stenzel.\n  We compute the magnetic complex structure explicitly for constant magnetic\nfields on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and $S^{2}.$ In the $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ case, the\nmagnetic adapted complex structure for a constant magnetic field is related to\nwork of Kr\\\"otz-Thangavelu-Xu on heat kernel analysis on the Heisenberg group.\n", "  The population of compact extragalactic sources contribute to the\nnon-Gaussianity at Cosmic Microwave Background frequencies. We study their\nnon-Gaussianity using publicly available full-sky simulations. We introduce a\nparametrisation to visualise efficiently the bispectrum and we describe the\nscale and frequency dependences of the bispectrum of radio and IR\npoint-sources. We show that the bispectrum is well fitted by an analytical\nprescription. We find that the clustering of IR sources enhances their\nnon-Gaussianity by several orders of magnitude, and that their bispectrum peaks\nin the squeezed triangles. Examining the impact of these sources on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity estimation, we find that radio sources yield an important\npositive bias to local fNL at low frequencies but this bias is efficiently\nreduced by masking detectable sources. IR sources produce a negative bias at\nhigh frequencies, which is not dimmed by the masking, as their clustering is\ndominated by faint sources.\n", "  We searched a short-term radio variability in an active galactic nucleus PKS\n1510-089. A daily flux monitoring for 143 days at 8.4 GHz was performed, and\nVLBI observations at 8.4, 22, and 43 GHz were carried out 4 times during the\nflux monitoring period. As a result, variability with time scale of 20 to 30\ndays was detected. The variation patterns were well alike on three frequencies,\nmoreover those at 22 and 43 GHz were synchronized. These properties support\nthat this short-term variability is an intrinsic one. The Doppler factor\nestimated from the variability time scale is 47. Since the Doppler factor is\nnot extraordinary large for AGN, such intrinsic variability with time scale\nless than 30 days would exist in other AGNs.\n", "  When modeling infrared or gamma-ray data as a linear combination of observed\ngas tracers, excess emission has been detected compared to expectations from\nknown neutral and atomic gas as traced by HI and CO measurements, respectively.\nThis excess might correspond to an additional gas component. This so-called\n\"dark gas\" (DG) has been observed in our Galaxy, as well as the Magellanic\nClouds. For the first time, we investigate the correlation between visible\nextinction (Av) data and gas tracers on large scales in the solar neighborhood.\nOur work focuses on both the solar neighborhood ($|b|>10\\degr$), and the inner\nand outer Galaxy, as well as on four individual regions: Taurus, Orion,\nCepheus-Polaris and Aquila-Ophiuchus. Thanks to the recent production of an\nall-sky Av map, we first perform the correlation between Av and both HI and CO\nemission over the most diffuse regions, to derive the optimal (Av/NH)^(ref)\nratio. We then iterate the analysis over the entire regions to estimate the\nCO-to-H2 conversion factor as well as the DG mass fraction. The average\nextinction to gas column-density ratio in the solar neighborhood is found to be\n(Av/NH)^(ref)=6.53 10^(-22) mag. cm^2, with significant differences between the\ninner and outer Galaxy. We derive an average XCO value of 1.67 10^(20) H2\ncm^(-2)/(K km s^(-1)). In the solar neighborhood, the gas mass in the dark\ncomponent is found to be 19% relative to that in the atomic component and\n164$%$ relative to the one traced by CO. These results are compatible with the\nrecent analysis using Planck data within the uncertainties of our measurements.\nWe estimate the ratio of dark gas to total molecular gas to be 0.62 in the\nsolar neighborhood. The HI-to-H2 and H2-to-CO transitions appear for Av\n$\\simeq$0.2 mag and Av$\\simeq1.5$ mag, respectively, in agreement with\ntheoretical models of dark-H2 gas.\n", "  We report an analysis of the interstellar gamma-ray emission from the\nChamaeleon, R Coronae Australis (R CrA), and Cepheus and Polaris flare regions\nwith the Fermi Large Area Telescope. They are among the nearest molecular cloud\ncomplexes, within ~300 pc from the solar system. The gamma-ray emission\nproduced by interactions of cosmic-rays (CRs) and interstellar gas in those\nmolecular clouds is useful to study the CR densities and distributions of\nmolecular gas close to the solar system. The obtained gamma-ray emissivities\nabove 250 MeV are (5.9 +/- 0.1(stat) (+0.9/-1.0)(sys)), (10.2 +/- 0.4(stat)\n(+1.2/-1.7)(sys)), and (9.1 +/- 0.3(stat) (+1.5/-0.6)(sys)) x10^(-27) photons\ns^(-1) sr^(-1) H-atom^(-1) for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and Polaris\nflare regions, respectively. Whereas the energy dependences of the emissivities\nagree well with that predicted from direct CR observations at the Earth, the\nmeasured emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV indicate a variation of the CR\ndensity by ~20% in the neighborhood of the solar system, even if we consider\nsystematic uncertainties. The molecular mass calibrating ratio, Xco =\nN(H2)/Wco, is found to be (0.96 +/- 0.06(stat) (+0.15/-0.12)(sys)), (0.99 +/-\n0.08(stat) (+0.18/-0.10)(sys)), and (0.63 +/- 0.02(stat) (+0.09/-0.07)(sys))\nx10^20 H2-molecule cm^(-2) (K km s^(-1))^(-1) for the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and\nCepheus and Polaris flare regions, respectively, suggesting a variation of Xco\nin the vicinity of the solar system. From the obtained values of Xco, the\nmasses of molecular gas traced by Wco in the Chamaeleon, R CrA, and Cepheus and\nPolaris flare regions are estimated to be ~5x10^3, ~10^3, and ~3.3x10^4 Msolar,\nrespectively. A comparable amount of gas not traced well by standard HI and CO\nsurveys is found in the regions investigated.\n", "  Over the last few years, the data obtained using the Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has provided new insights on\nhigh-energy processes in globular clusters, particularly those involving\ncompact objects such as Millisecond Pulsars (MSPs). Gamma-ray emission in the\n100 MeV to 10 GeV range has been detected from more than a dozen globular\nclusters in our galaxy, including 47 Tucanae and Terzan 5. Based on a sample of\nknown gamma-ray globular clusters, the empirical relations between gamma-ray\nluminosity and properties of globular clusters such as their stellar encounter\nrate, metallicity, and possible optical and infrared photon energy densities,\nhave been derived. The measured gamma-ray spectra are generally described by a\npower law with a cut-off at a few gigaelectronvolts. Together with the\ndetection of pulsed gamma-rays from two MSPs in two different globular\nclusters, such spectral signature lends support to the hypothesis that\ngamma-rays from globular clusters represent collective curvature emission from\nmagnetospheres of MSPs in the clusters. Alternative models, involving\nInverse-Compton (IC) emission of relativistic electrons that are accelerated\nclose to MSPs or pulsar wind nebula shocks, have also been suggested.\nObservations at >100 GeV by using Fermi/LAT and atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes such as H.E.S.S.-II, MAGIC-II, VERITAS, and CTA will help to settle\nsome questions unanswered by current data.\n", "  We define the \"quadrupole ratio\" r_{Q}=\\dfrac{Q_{0}(S)}{Q_{0}(B)} where\nQ_{0}(S) is the intrinsic quadrupole moment obtained from the static quadrupole\nmoment of the 2_{1}^{+} state of an even-even nucleus and Q_{0}(B) the\nintrinsic quadrupole moment obtained from B(E2)_{0\\rightarrow2} . In both cases\nwe assume a simple rotational formula connecting the rotating frame to the\nlaboratory frame. The quantity r_{Q} would be one if the rotational model were\nperfect and the energy ratio E(4)/E(2) would be 10/3. In the simple vibrational\nmodel, r_{Q} would be zero and E(4)/E(2) would be two. There are some regions\nwhere the rotational limit is almost met and fewer where the vibrational limit\nis also almost met. For most cases, however, it is between these two limits,\ni.e. 0<|r_{Q}|<1 . There are a few cases where r_{Q} is bigger than one,\nespecially for light nuclei. In most cases the quadrupole ratio is positive but\nthere are two regions with negative ratios. The first case is that of light\nnuclei and the second has certain nuclei close to ^{208} Pb.\n", "  Can we learn about New Physics with astronomical and astro-particle data?\nUnderstanding how this is possible is key to unraveling one of the most\npressing mysteries at the interface of cosmology and particle physics: the\nfundamental nature of dark matter. I will discuss some of the recent puzzling\nfindings in cosmic-ray electron-positron data and in gamma-ray observations\nthat might be related to dark matter. I will argue that recent cosmic-ray data,\nmost notably from the Pamela and Fermi satellites, indicate that previously\nunaccounted-for powerful sources in the Galaxy inject high-energy electrons and\npositrons. Interestingly, this new source class might be related to new\nfundamental particle physics, and specifically to pair-annihilation or decay of\ngalactic dark matter. This exciting scenario is directly constrained by Fermi\ngamma-ray observations, which also inform us on astrophysical source\ncounterparts that could also be responsible for the high-energy\nelectron-positron excess. Observations of gamma-ray emission from the central\nregions of the Galaxy as well as claims on a gamma-ray line at around 130 GeV\nalso recently triggered a wide-spread interest: I will address the question of\nwhether we are really observing signals from dark matter annihilation, how to\ntest this hypothesis, and which astrophysical mechanisms constitute the\nrelevant background.\n", "  We present a model for merger-driven evolution of the mass function for\nmassive galaxies and their central supermassive black holes at late times. We\ndiscuss the current observational evidence in favor of merger-driven massive\ngalaxy evolution during this epoch, and demonstrate that the observed evolution\nof the mass function can be reproduced by evolving an initial mass function\nunder the assumption of negligible star formation. We calculate the stochastic\ngravitational wave signal from the resulting black-hole binary mergers in the\nlow redshift universe (z <= 1) implied by this model, and find that this\npopulation has a signal-to-noise ratio as much as ~5x larger than previous\nestimates for pulsar timing arrays, with an expectation value for the\ncharacteristic strain h_c (f=1 yr^{-1}) = 4.1 x 10^{-15} that may already be in\ntension with observational constraints, and a {2-sigma, 3-sigma} lower limit\nwithin this model of h_c (f=1 yr^{-1}) = {1.1 x 10^{-15}, 6.8 x 10^{-16}}. The\nstrength of this signal is sufficient to make it detectable with high\nprobability under conservative assumptions within the next several years, if\nthe principle assumption of merger-driven galaxy evolution since z = 1 holds\ntrue. For cases where a galaxy merger fails to lead to a black hole merger, we\nestimate the probability for a given number of satellite unmerged black holes\nto remain within a massive host galaxy, and interpret the result in light of\nULX observations. In particular, we find that the brightest cluster galaxies\nshould have 1-2 such sources with luminosities above 10^{39} erg/s, which is\nconsistent with the statistics of observed ULXs.\n", "  The experimental two-microphone transfer function method (TMTF) is adapted to\nthe numerical framework to compute the radiation and input impedances of\nthree-dimensional vocal tracts of elliptical cross section. In its simplest\nversion, the TMTF method only requires measuring the acoustic pressure at two\npoints in an impedance duct and the postprocessing of the corresponding\ntransfer function. However, some considerations are to be taken into account\nwhen using the TMTF method in the numerical context, which constitute the main\nobjective of this paper. In particular, the importance of including absorption\nat the impedance duct walls to avoid lengthy numerical simulations is discussed\nand analytical complex axial wave numbers for elliptical ducts are derived for\nthis purpose. It is also shown how the plane wave restriction of the TMTF\nmethod can be circumvented to some extent by appropriate location of the\nvirtual microphones, thus extending the method frequency range of validity.\nVirtual microphone spacing is also discussed on the basis of the so called\nsingularity factor. Numerical examples include the computation of the radiation\nimpedance of vowels /a/, /i/ and /u/ and the input impedance of vowel /a/, for\nsimplified vocal tracts of circular and elliptical cross sections.\n", "  The chameleon mechanism appearing in massive tensor-scalar theory of gravity\ncan effectively reduce the nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and\nmatter. This mechanism is invoked to reconcile cosmological data requiring\nintroduction of Dark Energy with small-scale stringent constraints on General\nRelativity. In this communication, we present constraints on this mechanism\nobtained by a cosmological analysis (based on Supernovae Ia data) and by a\nSolar System analysis (based on PPN formalism).\n", "  We consider the influence of optical and temperature-dependent atomic\nfluctuations on the formation and propagation of optical vortex solitons in\ndense media realized as hollow-core optical fibers filled with a cold atomic\ngas in presence of optical pumping. We show different perturbation-induced\nscenaria of complete destruction and smooth transformations of the topological\ncharacteristics of localized optical structures in hollow-core fiber. The\nmaximum levels of optical and atomic fluctuations at which the soliton regime\ncan be maintained has been determined. The estimates for these levels show an\nopportunity to observe the optical vortex solitions in the core-filling gas of\nthe fiber for temperatures smaller than the critical temperature for\nBose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an atomic two-level system decaying by spontaneous\nemission of light. Subject to continuous detection of the radiated field, the\nsystem tends with certainty to the ground state in the long time limit, but at\ninitial times the excited state population exhibits non-trivial stochastic\nbehavior. Employing methods from Ito calculus, we characterize this behavior,\nand we show, for example, that the emitter, as a result of in-phase homodyne\nmeasurements, may become fully excited during the decay process while\nheterodyne and out of phase homodyne measurements do not drive the atom\ncompletely into the excited state.\n", "  The importance of choosing suitable tetrads for the study of exact solutions\nin f(T) gravity is discussed. For any given metric, we define the concept of\ngood tetrads as the tetrads satisfying the field equations without constrainig\nthe function f(T). Employing local Lorentz transformations, good tetrads in the\ncontext of spherical symmetry are found for Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions.\n", "  A recently proposed variational approach for general relativity where, in\naddition to the metric tensor, two independent affine connections enter the\naction as dynamical variables, is revised. Field equations always reduce to the\nEinstein field equations for any dependence of the matter action upon an\nindependent connection.\n", "  We present the detections of 19 solar flares detected in high-energy gamma\nrays (above 100 MeV) with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) during its first\nfour years of operation. Interestingly, all flares are associated with fairly\nfast Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and are not all powerful X-ray flares. We\nthen describe the detailed temporal, spatial and spectral characteristics of\nthe first two long-lasting events: the 2011 March 7 flare, a moderate (M3.7)\nimpulsive flare followed by slowly varying gamma-ray emission over 13 hours,\nand the 2011 June 7 M2.5 flare, which was followed by gamma-ray emission\nlasting for 2 hours. We compare the Fermi-LAT data with X-ray and proton data\nmeasurements from GOES and RHESSI. We argue that a hadronic origin of the gamma\nrays is more likely than a leptonic origin and find that the energy spectrum of\nthe proton distribution softens after the 2011 March 7 flare, favoring a\nscenario with continuous acceleration at the flare site. This work suggests\nthat proton acceleration in solar flares is more common than previously\nthought, occurring for even modest X-ray flares, and for longer durations.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observed two bright X-class solar flares\non 2012 March 7, and detected gamma-rays up to 4 GeV. We detected gamma-rays\nboth during the impulsive and temporally-extended emission phases, with\nemission above 100 MeV lasting for approximately 20 hours. Accurate\nlocalization of the gamma-ray production site(s) coincide with the solar active\nregion from which X-ray emissions associated with these flares originated. Our\nanalysis of the >100 MeV gamma-ray emission shows a relatively rapid monotonic\ndecrease in flux during the first hour of the impulsive phase, and a much\nslower, almost monotonic decrease in flux for the next 20 hours. The spectra\ncan be adequately described by a power law with a high energy exponential\ncutoff, or as resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced by accelerated\nprotons and ions with an isotropic power-law energy distribution. The required\nproton spectrum has a number index ~3, with minor variations during the\nimpulsive phase, while during the temporally extended phase the spectrum\nsoftens monotonically, starting with index ~4. The >30 MeV proton flux and\nspectra observed near the Earth by the GOES satellites also show a monotonic\nflux decrease and spectral softening during the extended phase, but with a\nharder spectrum, with index ~3. Based on the Fermi-LAT and GOES observations of\nthe flux and spectral evolution of these bright flares, we explore the relative\nmerits of prompt and continuous acceleration scenarios, hadronic and leptonic\nemission processes, and acceleration at the solar corona by the fast Coronal\nMass Ejections (CME) as explanations for the observations. We conclude that the\nmost likely scenario is continuous acceleration of protons in the solar corona\nwhich penetrate the lower solar atmosphere and produce pions that decay into\ngamma-rays.\n", "  The AMS-02 collaboration has recently reported an excess of the cosmic-ray\npositron fraction, which turned out to be consistent with previous results\nreported by the PAMELA and Fermi-LAT collaborations. A decaying dark matter\nwith the mass around 1 TeV can be responsible for the excess of the positron\nfraction when it is interpreted as a dark matter signal. Interestingly, the\npure gravity mediation model provides such a dark matter, namely an almost pure\nneutral wino dark matter, when a tiny R-parity violation through $LLE^c$\ninteractions is introduced. We show that the decaying wino dark matter well\nreproduces the energy spectrum of the fraction with being consistent with\nconstraints from cosmic-ray anti-proton and gamma-ray observations.\n", "  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are a theoretical class of\nparticles that are excellent dark matter candidates. WIMP annihilation or decay\nmay produce essentially monochromatic gamma rays detectable by the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) against the astrophysical gamma-ray emission of the\nGalaxy. We have searched for spectral lines in the energy range 5--300 GeV\nusing 3.7 years of data, reprocessed with updated instrument calibrations and\nan improved energy dispersion model compared to the previous Fermi-LAT\nCollaboration line searches. We searched in five regions selected to optimize\nsensitivity to different theoretically-motivated dark matter density\ndistributions. We did not find any globally significant lines in our a priori\nsearch regions and present 95% confidence limits for annihilation cross\nsections of self-conjugate WIMPs and decay lifetimes. Our most significant fit\noccurred at 133 GeV in our smallest search region and had a local significance\nof 3.3 standard deviations, which translates to a global significance of 1.5\nstandard deviations. We discuss potential systematic effects in this search,\nand examine the feature at 133 GeV in detail. We find that both the use of\nreprocessed data and of additional information in the energy dispersion model\ncontribute to the reduction in significance of the line-like feature near 130\nGeV relative to significances reported in other works. We also find that the\nfeature is narrower than the LAT energy resolution at the level of 2 to 3\nstandard deviations, which somewhat disfavors the interpretation of the 133 GeV\nfeature as a real WIMP signal.\n", "  We consider the population of critical points generated from the critical\npoint of the master function with no variables, which is associated with the\ntrivial representation of the affine Lie algebra $A^2_2$. We describe how the\ncritical points of this population define rational solutions of the equations\nof the mKdV hierarchy associated with $A^2_2$.\n", "  Gamma-ray binaries are stellar systems for which the spectral energy\ndistribution (discounting the thermal stellar emission) peaks at high energies.\nDetected from radio to TeV gamma rays, the gamma-ray binary LS I 61 303 is\nhighly variable across all frequencies. One aspect of this system's variability\nis the modulation of its emission with the timescale set by the ~26.4960-day\norbital period. Here we show that, during the time of our observations, the\ngamma-ray emission of LS I 61 303 also presents a sinusoidal variability\nconsistent with the previously-known superorbital period of 1667 days. This\nmodulation is more prominently seen at orbital phases around apastron, whereas\nit does not introduce a visible change close to periastron. It is also found in\nthe appearance and disappearance of variability at the orbital period in the\npower spectrum of the data. This behavior could be explained by a\nquasi-cyclical evolution of the equatorial outflow of the Be companion star,\nwhose features influence the conditions for generating gamma rays. These\nfindings open the possibility to use gamma-ray observations to study the\noutflows of massive stars in eccentric binary systems.\n", "  A growing number of researchers present evidence that the pulsar wind nebula\n3C58 is much older than predicted by its proposed connection to the historical\nsupernova of A.D. 1181. There is also a great diversity of arguments. The\nstrongest of these arguments rely heavily on the assumed distance of 3.2 kpc\ndetermined with HI absorption measurements. This publication aims at\ndetermining a more accurate distance for 3C58 and re-evaluating the arguments\nfor a larger age. I have re-visited the distance determination of 3C58 based on\nnew HI data from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey and our recent improvements\nin the knowledge of the rotation curve of the outer Milky Way Galaxy. I have\nalso used newly determined distances to objects in the neighbourhood, which are\nbased on direct measurements by trigonometric parallax. I have derived a new\nmore reliable distance estimate of 2 kpc for 3C58. This makes the connection\nbetween the pulsar wind nebula and the historical event from A.D. 1181 once\nagain much more viable.\n", "  We make a detailed time resolved spectroscopy of bright long gamma ray bursts\n(GRBs) which show significant GeV emissions (GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, and GRB\n090926A). In addition to the standard Band model, we also use a model\nconsisting of a blackbody and a power-law to fit the spectra. We find that for\nthe latter model there are indications for an additional soft component in the\nspectra. While previous studies have shown that such models are required for\nGRB 090902B, here we find that a composite spectral model consisting of two\nblack bodies and a power law adequately fit the data of all the three bright\nGRBs. We investigate the evolution of the spectral parameters and find several\ngeneric interesting features for all three GRBs, like a) temperatures of the\nblack bodies are strongly correlated to each other, b) flux in the black body\ncomponents are strongly correlated to each other, c) the temperatures of the\nblack body trace the profile of the individual pulses of the GRBs, and d) the\ncharacteristics of the power law component like the spectral index and the\ndelayed onset bear a close similarity to the emission characteristics in the\nGeV regions. We discuss the implications of these results to the possibility of\nidentifying the radiation mechanisms during the prompt emission of GRBs.\n", "  INTEGRAL is a hard X-ray/gamma-ray observatory for astrophysics (ESA)\ncovering photon energies from 15 keV to 10 MeV. It was launched in 2002 and\nsince then the BGO detectors of the Anti-Coincidence shield (ACS) of the SPI\nspectrometer have detected many hard X-ray (HXR) bursts from the Sun, producing\nlightcurves at photon energies above ~ 100 keV. The spacecraft has a highly\nelliptical orbit, providing a long uninterrupted observing time (about 90% of\nthe orbital period) with nearly constant background due to the reduction of the\ncrossing time of the Earth's radiation belts. However, due to technical\nconstraints, INTEGRAL cannot point to the Sun and high-energy solar photons are\nalways detected in non-standard observation conditions. To make the data useful\nfor solar studies, we have undertaken a major effort to specify the observing\nconditions through Monte-Carlo simulations of the response of ACS for several\nselected flares. We check the performance of the model employed for the\nMonte-Carlo simulations using RHESSI observations for the same sample of solar\nflares. We conclude that, despite the fact that INTEGRAL was not designed to\nperform solar observations, ACS is a useful instrument in solar flare research.\nIn particular, its relatively large effective area allows the determination of\ngood-quality HXR/gamma-ray lightcurves for X- and M-class solar flares and, in\nsome cases, probably also for C-class flares.\n", "  We argue that, because of the quantum-entanglement, the local physics of the\nstrongly-correlated materials at zero temperature is described in very good\napproximation by a simple generalized Gibbs distribution, which depends on a\nrelatively small number local quantum thermodynamical potentials. We\ndemonstrate that our statement is exact in certain limits, and we perform\nnumerical calculations of the iron compounds FeSe and FeTe and of the elemental\ncerium by employing the Gutzwiller Approximation (GA) that strongly support our\ntheory in general.\n", "  {\\it Fermi}-LAT has detected pulsed gamma-ray emissions with high confidences\nfrom more than 40 millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Here we study the phase-averaged\ngamma-ray properties of MSPs by using revised version of a self-consistent\nouter gap model. In this model, a strong multipole magnetic field near the\nstellar surface for a MSP is assumed and such a field will be close to the\nsurface magnetic fields ($\\sim 10^{11}- 10^{12}$ G) of young ulsars; the outer\ngap of a MSP is controlled by photon-photon pair production process, where the\neffects of magnetic inclination angle ($\\alpha$) and magnetic geometry have\nbeen taken into account, therefore the fractional size of the outer gap is a\nfunction of not only pulsar's period and magnetic field strength but also\nmagnetic inclination angle and radial distance to the neutron star, the inner\nboundary of the outer gap can be estimated by the pair production process of\nthe gamma-ray photons which are produced by the back-flowing particles through\nthe null charge surface; inside the outer gap, a Gaussian distribution of the\nparallel electric field along the trans-field thickness is assumed, and the\ngamma-ray emission is represented by the emission from the average radial\ndistance along the central field lines of the outer gap. Using this model, the\nphase-averaged gamma-ray spectra are calculated and compared with the observed\nspectra of 37 MSPs given by the second {\\it Fermi}-LAT catalog of gamma-ray\npulsars, our results show that the {\\it Fermi}-LAT results can be well\nexplained by this model. The thermal X-ray emission properties from MSPs are\nalso investigated.\n", "  Although inflation is a natural candidate to generate the lengths of\ncoherence of magnetic fields needed to explain current observations, it needs\nto break conformal invariance of electromagnetism to obtain significant\nmagnetic amplitudes. Of the simplest realizations are the kinetically-coupled\ntheories $f^2(\\phi)F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu}$ (or $IFF$ theories). However, these\nare known to suffer from electric fields backreaction or the strong coupling\nproblem. In this work we shall confirm that such class of theories are\nproblematic to support magnetogenesis during inflationary cosmology. On the\ncontrary, we show that a bouncing cosmology with a contracting phase dominated\nby an equation of state with $p>-\\rho/3$ can support magnetogenesis, evading\nthe {backreaction/strong-coupling problem}. Finally, we study safe\nmagnetogenesis in a particular bouncing model with an ekpyrotic-like\ncontracting phase. In this case we found that $f^2(\\phi)F^2$-instabilities\nmight arise during the final kinetic-driven expanding phase for steep ekpyrotic\npotentials.\n", "  What is the scaling limit of diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) in the\nplane? This is an old and famously difficult question. One can generalize the\nquestion in two ways: first, one may consider the {\\em dielectric breakdown\nmodel} $\\eta$-DBM, a generalization of DLA in which particle locations are\nsampled from the $\\eta$-th power of harmonic measure, instead of harmonic\nmeasure itself. Second, instead of restricting attention to deterministic\nlattices, one may consider $\\eta$-DBM on random graphs known or believed to\nconverge in law to a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface with parameter\n$\\gamma \\in [0,2]$.\n  In this generality, we propose a scaling limit candidate called quantum\nLoewner evolution, QLE$(\\gamma^2, \\eta)$. QLE is defined in terms of the radial\nLoewner equation like radial SLE, except that it is driven by a measure valued\ndiffusion $\\nu_t$ derived from LQG rather than a multiple of a standard\nBrownian motion. We formalize the dynamics of $\\nu_t$ using an SPDE. For each\n$\\gamma \\in (0,2]$, there are two or three special values of $\\eta$ for which\nwe establish the existence of a solution to these dynamics and explicitly\ndescribe the stationary law of $\\nu_t$.\n  We also explain discrete versions of our construction that relate DLA to\nloop-erased random walk and the Eden model to percolation. A certain\n\"reshuffling\" trick (in which concentric annular regions are rotated randomly,\nlike slot machine reels) facilitates explicit calculation.\n  We propose QLE$(2,1)$ as a scaling limit for DLA on a random\nspanning-tree-decorated planar map, and QLE$(8/3,0)$ as a scaling limit for the\nEden model on a random triangulation. We propose using QLE$(8/3,0)$ to endow\npure LQG with a distance function, by interpreting the region explored by a\nbranching variant of QLE$(8/3,0)$, up to a fixed time, as a metric ball in a\nrandom metric space.\n", "  In this work we study superinflation in the context of the emergent universe\n(EU) scenario. The existence of a superinflating phase before the onset of\nslow-roll inflation arises in any emergent universe model. We found that the\nsuperinflationary period in the EU scenario produces a suppression of the CMB\nanisotropies at large scale which could be responsible for the observed lack of\npower at large angular scales of the CMB.\n", "  We find the distribution function f(E) for dark matter (DM) halos in galaxies\nand the corresponding equation of state from the (empirical) DM density\nprofiles derived from observations. We solve for DM in galaxies the analogous\nof the Eddington equation originally used for the gas of stars in globular\nclusters. The observed density profiles are a good realistic starting point and\nthe distribution functions derived from them are realistic. We do not make any\nassumption about the DM nature, the methods developed here apply to any DM\nkind, though all results are consistent with Warm DM. With these methods we\nfind: (i) Cored density profiles behaving quadratically for small distances\nrho(r) r -> 0 = rho(0) - K r^2 produce distribution functions which are finite\nand positive at the halo center while cusped density profiles always produce\ndivergent distribution functions at the center. (ii) Cored density profiles\nproduce approximate thermal Boltzmann distribution functions for r < 3 r_h\nwhere r_h is the halo radius. (iii) Analytic expressions for the dispersion\nvelocity and the pressure are derived yielding an ideal DM gas equation of\nstate with local temperature T(r) = m v^2(r)/3. T(r) turns to be constant in\nthe same region where the distribution function is thermal and exhibits the\nsame temperature within the percent. The self-gravitating DM gas can thermalize\ndespite being collisionless because it is an ergodic system. (iv) The DM halo\ncan be consistently considered at local thermal equilibrium with: (a) a\nconstant temperature T(r) = T_0 for r < 3 \\; r_h, (b) a space dependent\ntemperature T(r) for 3 r_h < r < R_{virial}, which slowly decreases with r.\nThat is, the DM halo is realistically a collisionless self-gravitating thermal\ngas for r < R_{virial}. (v) T(r) outside the halo radius nicely follows the\ndecrease of the circular velocity squared.\n", "  To explain conceptual gap between classical/quantum and other, hypothetical\ndescriptions of world, several principles has been proposed. So far, all these\nprinciples have not explicitly included the uncertainty relation. Here we\nintroduce an information content principle (ICP) which represents the new -\nconstrained uncertainty principle. The principle, by taking into account the\nencoding/decoding properties of single physical system, is capable of\nseparation both classicality and quanta from a number of potential physical\ntheories including hidden variable theories. The ICP, which is satisfied by\nboth classical and quantum theory, states that the amount of non-redundant\ninformation which may be extracted from a given system is bounded by a\nperfectly decodable information content of the system. We show that ICP allows\nto discriminate theories which do not allow for correlations stronger than\nTsirelson's bound. We show also how to apply the principle to composite\nsystems, ruling out some theories despite their elementary constituents behave\nquantumly.\n", "  While black hole perturbation theory predicts a rich quasi-normal mode\nstructure, technical challenges have limited the numerical study of excitations\nto the fundamental, lowest order modes caused by the coalescence of black\nholes. Here, we present a robust method to identify quasi-normal mode\nexcitations beyond the fundamentals within currently available numerical\nrelativity waveforms. In applying this method to waveforms of initially\nnon-spinning black hole binaries, of mass ratios 1 to 15, we find not only the\nfundamental quasi-normal mode amplitudes, but also overtones, and evidence for\n2nd order quasi-normal modes. We find that the mass-ratio dependence of\nquasi-normal mode excitation is very well modeled by a Post-Newtonian like sum\nin symmetric mass ratio. Concurrently, we find that the mass ratio dependence\nof some quasi-normal modes is qualitatively different from their Post-Newtonian\ninspired counterparts, suggesting that the imprints of nonlinear merger are\nmore evident in some modes than in others. We present new fitting formulas for\nthe related quasi-normal mode excitations, as well as for remnant black hole\nspin and mass. We also discuss the relevance of our results in terms of\ngravitational wave detection and characterization.\n", "  Comparison of hydrodynamic and \"hybrid\" hydrodynamics+transport calculations\nto heavy-ion data inevitably requires the conversion of the fluid to particles.\nFor dissipative fluids the conversion is ambiguous without additional theory\ninput complementing hydrodynamics. We obtain self-consistent shear viscous\nphase space corrections from linearized Boltzmann transport theory for a gas of\nhadrons. These corrections depend on the particle species, and incorporating\nthem in Cooper-Frye freezeout affects identified particle observables. For\nexample, with additive quark model cross sections,proton elliptic flow is\nlarger than pion elliptic flow at moderately high $p_T$ in $Au+Au$ collisions\nat RHIC. This is in contrast to Cooper-Frye freezeout with the commonly used\n\"democratic Grad\" ansatz that assumes no species dependence. Various analytic\nand numerical results are also presented for massless and massive two-component\nmixtures to aid the interpretation. Self-consistent viscous corrections for\neach species are tabulated in Appendix F for convenient inclusion in pure\nhydrodynamic and hybrid calculations.\n", "  High-energy phenomena in the cosmos, and in particular processes leading to\nthe emission of gamma- rays in the energy range 10 MeV - 100 GeV, play a very\nspecial role in the understanding of our Universe. This energy range is indeed\nassociated with non-thermal phenomena and challenging particle acceleration\nprocesses. The technology involved in detecting gamma-rays is challenging and\ndrives our ability to develop improved instruments for a large variety of\napplications. GAMMA-LIGHT is a Small Mission which aims at an unprecedented\nadvance of our knowledge in many sectors of astrophysical and Earth studies\nresearch. The Mission will open a new observational window in the low-energy\ngamma-ray range 10-50 MeV, and is configured to make substantial advances\ncompared with the previous and current gamma-ray experiments (AGILE and Fermi).\nThe improvement is based on an exquisite angular resolution achieved by\nGAMMA-LIGHT using state-of-the-art Silicon technology with innovative data\nacquisition. GAMMA-LIGHT will address all astrophysics issues left open by the\ncurrent generation of instruments. In particular, the breakthrough angular\nresolution in the energy range 100 MeV - 1 GeV is crucial to resolve patchy and\ncomplex features of diffuse sources in the Galaxy as well as increasing the\npoint source sensitivity. This proposal addresses scientific topics of great\ninterest to the community, with particular emphasis on multifrequency\ncorrelation studies involving radio, optical, IR, X-ray, soft gamma-ray and TeV\nemission. At the end of this decade several new observatories will be\noperational including LOFAR, SKA, ALMA, HAWK, CTA. GAMMA-LIGHT will \"fill the\nvacuum\" in the 10 MeV-10 GeV band, and will provide invaluable data for the\nunderstanding of cosmic and terrestrial high-energy sources.\n", "  In this paper, we construct growing modes of the linearized Navier-Stokes\nequations about generic stationary shear flows of the boundary layer type in a\nregime of sufficiently large Reynolds number: $R \\to \\infty$. Notably, the\nshear profiles are allowed to be linearly stable at the infinite Reynolds\nnumber limit, and so the instability presented is purely due to the presence of\nviscosity. The formal construction of approximate modes is well-documented in\nphysics literature, going back to the work of Heisenberg, C.C. Lin, Tollmien,\nDrazin and Reid, but a rigorous construction requires delicate mathematical\ndetails, involving for instance a treatment of primitive Airy functions and\nsingular solutions. Our analysis gives exact unstable eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions, showing that the solution could grow slowly at the rate of\n$e^{t/\\sqrt {R}}$. A new, operator-based approach is introduced, avoiding to\ndeal with matching inner and outer asymptotic expansions, but instead involving\na careful study of singularity in the critical layers by deriving pointwise\nbounds on the Green function of the corresponding Rayleigh and Airy operators.\n", "  In this work we explore the viability of nonminimally coupled matter-\ncurvature gravity theories, namely the conditions required for the absence of\ntachyon instabilities and ghost degrees of freedom. We contrast our finds with\nrecent claims of a pathological behaviour of this class of models, which\nresorted to, in our view, an incorrect analogy with k-essence.\n", "  Agent-based models are versatile tools for studying how societal opinion\nchange, including political polarization and cultural diffusion, emerges from\nindividual behavior. This study expands agents' psychological realism using\nempirically-motivated rules governing interpersonal influence, commitment to\nprevious beliefs, and conformity in social contexts. Computational experiments\nestablish that these extensions produce three novel results: (a) sustained\nstrong diversity of opinions within the population, (b) opinion subcultures,\nand (c) pluralistic ignorance. These phenomena arise from a combination of\nagents' intolerance, susceptibility and conformity, with extremist agents and\nsocial networks playing important roles. The distribution and dynamics of\nsimulated opinions reproduce two empirical datasets on Americans' political\nopinions.\n", "  We consider constraints on cosmic strings from their emission of Higgs\nparticles, in the case that the strings have a Higgs condensate with amplitude\nof order the string mass scale, assuming that a fraction of the energy of\ncondensate can be turned into radiation near cusps. The injection of energy by\nthe decaying Higgs particles affects the light element abundances predicted by\nstandard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and also contributes to the Diffuse\nGamma-Ray Background (DGRB) in the universe today. We examine the two main\nstring scenarios (Nambu-Goto and field theory), and find that the primordial\nHelium abundance strongly constrains the string tension and the efficiency of\nthe emission process in the NG scenario, while the strongest BBN constraint in\nthe FT scenario comes from the Deuterium abundance. The Fermi-LAT measurement\nof the DGRB constrains the field theory scenario even more strongly than\npreviously estimated from EGRET data, requiring that the product of the string\ntension {\\mu} and Newton's constant G is bounded by G{\\mu} <\n2.7x10^{-11}{\\beta}_{ft}^{-2}, where {\\beta}_{ft}^2 is the fraction of the\nstrings' energy going into Higgs particles.\n", "  A traditional approach to the analysis of mode coupling in a fluctuating\nunderwater waveguide is based on solving the system of coupled equations for\nthe second statistical moments of mode amplitudes derived in the Markov\napproximation [D.B. Creamer, J.Acoust. Soc. Am. 99, 2825--2838 (1996)]. In the\npresent work an alternative approach is considered. It is based on an analytic\nsolution of the mode coupling equation derived in the high frequency\napproximation [A.L. Virovlyanskii and A.G. Kosterin, Sov. Phys. Acoust. 35,\n138-142 (1987)]. This solution representing the mode amplitude as a sum of\ncontributions from two geometrical rays is convenient for statistical\naveraging. It allows one to easily derive analytical expressions for any\nstatistical moments of mode amplitudes. The applicability of this approach is\ndemonstrated by comparing its predictions for a deep water acoustic waveguide\nwith results of full wave numerical simulation carried out using the method of\nwide angle parabolic equation.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior of the discrete analogue of the holomorphic\nmap $z^a$. The analysis is based on the use of the Riemann-Hilbert approach.\nSpecifically, using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method we prove\nthe asymptotic formulae which was conjectured in 2000 by the first co-author\nand S.I.~Agafonov.\n", "  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer has released high-precision data for cosmic\nrays, and has verified an excess of positrons relative to expectations from\ncosmic ray interactions in the interstellar medium. An exciting and well-known\npossibility for the excess is production of electron-positron pairs by\nannihilating dark matter particles in the halo of the Galaxy. We have\nconstructed a new scenario for propagation of cosmic rays, based on the 2000\nSMILI results and various other astrophysics observations and measurements, in\nwhich the positron excess is due to secondary production. The scenario is\nstudied from a simple heuristic perspective, and also within the constraints of\na diffusion-reacceleration model using GALPROP. The conclusions of each\napproach agree with one another, showing that the scenario agrees well with the\nobserved positron flux, without any need for dark matter or other exotic\nproduction mechanisms.\n", "  It is known that the high energy $(> 100\\,\\text{MeV})$ emission of gamma-ray\nbursts is delayed with respect to the low energy emission. However, the\ndependence of light curves on energy has not been studied for the high energy\nbands. In this paper we consider the bursts observed by Fermi LAT from 2008\nAugust 4 to 2011 August 1, for which at least $10$ photons were observed with\nthe energy greater than $1\\,\\text{GeV}$. These include $4$ bursts: GRB 080916C,\nGRB 090510, GRB 090902B, and GRB 090926A. We use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to\ncompare the light curves in the two bands, $100\\,\\text{MeV} < E <\n1\\,\\text{GeV}$ and $E > 1\\,\\text{GeV}$. For GRB 080916C and GRB 090510 the\nlight curves in the two bands are statistically compatible. However, for GRB\n090926A, the higher-energy light curve is stretched compared to the\nlower-energy one with a statistical significance of $3.3 \\sigma$ and, for GRB\n090902B, on the contrary, the lower-energy curve is stretched with $2.3 \\sigma$\nsignificance. We argue that the observed diversity of stretching factors may be\nexplained in a simple geometrical model. The model assumes that the jet opening\nangle depends on the emission energy in a way that the most energetic photons\nare radiated near the axis of the jet. All the bursts are considered equivalent\nin their rest frames and the observed light curves differ only due to different\nredshifts and view directions. The model conforms to the total burst energy\nconstraint and matches the Fermi LAT observations of the fraction of GRBs\nvisible in $100\\,\\text{MeV} < E < 1\\,\\text{GeV}$ band, which may be observed at\nhigher energies. The model predicts the distribution of observable stretching\nfactors, which may be tested in the future data. Finally, we propose a method\nto estimate observer's off-axis angle based on the stretching factor and the\nfraction of the high-energy photons.\n", "  Impacts that leave the Earth-Moon system with a large excess in angular\nmomentum have recently been advocated as a means of generating a protolunar\ndisc with a composition that is nearly identical to that of the Earth's mantle.\nWe here investigate the accretion of the Moon from discs generated by such\n\"non-canonical\" impacts, which are typically more compact than discs produced\nby canonical impacts and have a higher fraction of their mass initially located\ninside the Roche limit. Our model predicts a similar overall accretional\nhistory for both canonical and non-canonical discs, with the Moon forming in\nthree consecutive steps over hundreds of years. However, we find that, to yield\na lunar-mass Moon, the more compact non-canonical discs must initially be more\nmassive than implied by prior estimates, and only a few of the discs produced\nby impact simulations to date appear to meet this condition. Non-canonical\nimpacts require that capture of the Moon into the evection resonance with the\nSun reduced the Earth-Moon angular momentum by a factor of 2 or more. We find\nthat the Moon's semimajor axis at the end of its accretion is approximately\n$7R_\\oplus$, which is comparable to the location of the evection resonance for\na post-impact Earth with a 2.5 h rotation period in the absence of a disc.\nThus, the dynamics of the Moon's assembly may directly affect its ability to be\ncaptured into the resonance.\n", "  The standard model of cosmic ray propagation has been very successful in\nexplaining all kinds of the Galactic cosmic ray spectra. However, high\nprecision measurement recently revealed the appreciable discrepancy between\ndata and model expectation, from spectrum observations of $\\gamma$-rays,\n$e^+/e^-$ and probably the $B/C$ ratio starting from $\\sim$10 GeV energy. In\nthis work, we propose that the fresh cosmic rays, which are supplied by the\nyoung accelerators and detained by local magnetic field, can contribute\nadditional secondary particles interacting with local materials. As this early\ncosmic ray has a hard spectrum, the model calculation results in a\ntwo-component $\\gamma$-ray spectrum, which agree very well with the\nobservation. Simultaneously, the expected neutrino number from the galactic\nplane could contribute $\\sim60\\%$ of IceCube observation neutrino number below\na few hundreds of TeV. The same pp-collision process can account for a\nsignificant amount of the positron excesses. Under this model, it is expected\nthat the excesses in $\\overline p/p$ and $B/C$ ratio will show up when energy\nis above $\\sim$10 GeV. We look forward that the model will be tested in the\nnear future by new observations from AMS02, IceCube, AS$\\gamma$, HAWC and\nfuture experiments such as LHASSO, HiSCORE and CTA.\n", "  We compare model results from a semi-analytic (merger-tree based) framework\nfor high-redshift (z ~ 5-20) galaxy formation against reionization indicators,\nincluding the Planck electron scattering optical depth and the ionizing photon\nemissivity, to shed light on the reionization history and sources in Cold (CDM)\nand Warm Dark Matter (WDM; particle masses of $m_x = 1.5,3$ and 5 keV)\ncosmologies. This model includes all the key processes of star formation,\nsupernova feedback, the merger/accretion/ejection driven evolution of gas and\nstellar mass and the effect of the ultra-violet background (UVB) in\nphoto-evaporating the gas content of low-mass galaxies. We find that the delay\nin the start of reionization in light (1.5 keV) WDM models can be compensated\nby a steeper redshift evolution of the ionizing photon escape fraction and a\nfaster mass assembly, resulting in reionization ending at comparable redshifts\n(z~5.5) in all the DM models considered. We find the bulk of the reionization\nphotons come from galaxies with a halo mass $M_h < 10^9 M_\\odot$ and a UV\nmagnitude $ -15 < M_{UV} < -10$ in CDM. The progressive suppression of low-mass\nhalos with decreasing $m_x$ leads to a shift in the reionization population to\nlarger halo masses of $M_h > 10^9 M_\\odot$ and $ -17 < M_{UV} < -13$ for 1.5\nkeV WDM. We find that current observations of the electron scattering optical\ndepth and the Ultra-violet luminosity function are equally compatible with all\nthe (cold and warm) DM models considered in this work. We propose that global\nindicators including the redshift evolution of the stellar mass density and the\nstellar mass-halo mass relation, observable with the James Webb Space\nTelescope, can be used to distinguish between CDM and WDM (1.5 keV)\ncosmologies.\n", "  We consider real-valued solutions $u=u(x|s),x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ of the second\nPainlev\\'e equation $u_{xx}=xu+2u^3$ which are parametrized in terms of the\nmonodromy data $s\\equiv(s_1,s_2,s_3)\\subset\\mathbb{C}^3$ of the associated\nFlaschka-Newell system of rational differential equations. Our analysis\ndescribes the transition, as $x\\rightarrow-\\infty$, between the oscillatory\npower-like decay asymptotics for $|s_1|<1$ (Ablowitz-Segur) to the power-like\ngrowth behavior for $|s_1|=1$ (Hastings-McLeod) and from the latter to the\nsingular oscillatory power-like growth for $|s_1|>1$ (Kapaev). It is shown that\nthe transition asymptotics are of Boutroux type, i.e. they are expressed in\nterms of Jacobi elliptic functions. As applications of our results we obtain\nasymptotics for the Airy kernel determinant $\\det(I-\\gamma\nK_{\\textnormal{Ai}})|_{L^2(x,\\infty)}$ in a double scaling limit\n$x\\rightarrow-\\infty,\\gamma\\uparrow 1$ as well as asymptotics for the spectrum\nof $K_{\\textnormal{Ai}}$.\n", "  The observational status of inflation after the Planck 2013 and 2015 results\nand the BICEP2/Keck Array and Planck joint analysis is discussed. These\npedagogical lecture notes are intended to serve as a technical guide filling\nthe gap between the theoretical articles on inflation and the experimental\nworks on astrophysical and cosmological data. After a short discussion of the\ncentral tenets at the basis of inflation (negative self-gravitating pressure)\nand its experimental verifications, it reviews how the most recent Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) anisotropy measurements constrain cosmic inflation.\nThe fact that vanilla inflationary models are, so far, preferred by the\nobservations is discussed and the reason why plateau-like potential versions of\ninflation are favored within this subclass of scenarios is explained. Finally,\nhow well the future measurements, in particular of $B$-Mode CMB polarization or\nprimordial gravity waves, will help to improve our knowledge about inflation is\nalso investigated.\n", "  With the temperature power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nat least four orders of magnitude larger than the B-mode polarisation power\nspectrum, any instrumental imperfections that couple temperature to\npolarisation must be carefully controlled and/or removed. Here we present two\nnew map-making algorithms that can create polarisation maps that are clean of\ntemperature-to-polarisation leakage systematics due to differential gain and\npointing between a detector pair. Where a half wave plate is used, we show that\nthe spin-2 systematic due to differential ellipticity can also by removed using\nour algorithms. The algorithms require no prior knowledge of the imperfections\nor temperature sky to remove the temperature leakage. Instead, they calculate\nthe systematic and polarisation maps in one step directly from the time ordered\ndata (TOD). The first algorithm is designed to work with scan strategies that\nhave a good range of crossing angles for each map pixel and the second for scan\nstrategies that have a limited range of crossing angles. The first algorithm\ncan also be used to identify if systematic errors that have a particular spin\nare present in a TOD. We demonstrate the use of both algorithms and the ability\nto identify systematics with simulations of TOD with realistic scan strategies\nand instrumental noise.\n", "  We examine the stellar mass assembly in galaxy cluster cores using data from\nthe Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We measure the\ngrowth of brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) stellar mass, the fraction of the\ntotal cluster light which is in the intracluster light (ICL) and the numbers of\nmergers that occur in the BCG over the redshift range of the sample,\n0.18<z<0.90. We find that BCGs grow in stellar mass by a factor of 1.4 on\naverage from accretion of their companions, and this growth is reduced to a\nfactor of 1.2 assuming 50% of the accreted stellar mass becomes ICL, in line\nwith the predictions of simulations. We find that the ICL shows significant\ngrowth over this same redshift range, growing by a factor of of 4--5 in its\ncontribution to the total cluster light. This result is in line with our\nprevious findings for ICL at higher redshifts, however our measured growth is\nsomewhat steeper than is predicted by simulations of ICL assembly. We find high\nmass companions and hence major merging (mergers with objects of masses\n$\\geq$1/2 of the BCG) to be very rare for our sample. We conclude that minor\nmergers (mergers with objects with masses $<$ 1/2 of the BCG) are the dominant\nprocess for stellar mass assembly at low redshifts, with the majority of the\nstellar mass from interactions ending up contributing to the ICL rather than\nbuilding up the BCG. From a rough estimate of the stellar mass growth of the\nICL we also conclude that the majority of the ICL stars must come from galaxies\nwhich fall from outside of the core of the cluster, as is predicted by\nsimulations. It appears that the growth of the ICL is the major evolution event\nin galaxy cluster cores during the second half of the lifetime of the Universe.\n", "  Molecular motors and cytoskeletal filaments work collectively most of the\ntime under opposing forces. This opposing force may be due to cargo carried by\nmotors or resistance coming from the cell membrane pressing against the\ncytoskeletal filaments. Some recent studies have shown that the collective\nmaximum force (stall force) generated by multiple cytoskeletal filaments or\nmolecular motors may not always be just a simple sum of the stall forces of the\nindividual filaments or motors. To understand this excess or deficit in the\ncollective force, we study a broad class of models of both cytoskeletal\nfilaments and molecular motors. We argue that the stall force generated by a\ngroup of filaments or motors is additive, that is, the stall force of $N$\nnumber of filaments (motors) is $N$ times the stall force of one filament\n(motor), when the system is in equilibrium at stall. Conversely, we show that\nthis additive property typically does not hold true when the system is not at\nequilibrium at stall. We thus present a novel and unified understanding of the\nexisting models exhibiting such non-addivity, and generalise our arguments by\ndeveloping new models that demonstrate this phenomena. We also propose a\nquantity similar to thermodynamic efficiency to easily predict this deviation\nfrom stall-force additivity for filament and motor collectives.\n", "  The level structure of the very neutron rich and unbound $^9$He nucleus has\nbeen the subject of significant experimental and theoretical study. Many recent\nworks have claimed that the two lowest energy $^9$He states exist with spins\n$J^\\pi=1/2^+$ and $J^\\pi=1/2^-$ and widths on the order of hundreds of keV.\nThese findings cannot be reconciled with our contemporary understanding of\nnuclear structure. The present work is the first high-resolution study with low\nstatistical uncertainty of the relevant excitation energy range in the\n$^8$He$+n$ system, performed via a search for the T=5/2 isobaric analog states\nin $^9$Li populated through $^8$He+p elastic scattering. The present data show\nno indication of any narrow structures. Instead, we find evidence for a broad\n$J^{\\pi}=1/2^+$ state in $^9$He located approximately 3 MeV above the neutron\ndecay threshold.\n", "  Dark matter in the Milky Way may annihilate directly into gamma rays,\nproducing a monoenergetic spectral line. Therefore, detecting such a signature\nwould be strong evidence for dark matter annihilation or decay. We search for\nspectral lines in the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of the Milky Way\nhalo in the energy range 200 MeV to 500 GeV using analysis methods from our\nmost recent line searches. The main improvements relative to previous works are\nour use of 5.8 years of data reprocessed with the Pass 8 event-level analysis\nand the additional data resulting from the modified observing strategy designed\nto increase exposure of the Galactic center region. We searched in five sky\nregions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically-motivated\ndark matter scenarios and find no significant detections. In addition to\npresenting the results from our search for lines, we also investigate the\npreviously reported tentative detection of a line at 133 GeV using the new Pass\n8 data.\n", "  We show that all $n$-qubit entangled states, with the exception of tensor\nproducts of single-qubit and bipartite maximally-entangled states, admit\nHardy-type proofs of non-locality without inequalities or probabilities. More\nprecisely, we show that for all such states, there are local, one-qubit\nobservables such that the resulting probability tables are logically contextual\nin the sense of Abramsky and Brandenburger, this being the general form of the\nHardy-type property. Moreover, our proof is constructive: given a state, we\nshow how to produce the witnessing local observables. In fact, we give an\nalgorithm to do this. Although the algorithm is reasonably straightforward, its\nproof of correctness is non-trivial. A further striking feature is that we show\nthat $n+2$ local observables suffice to witness the logical contextuality of\nany $n$-qubit state: two each for two for the parties, and one each for the\nremaining $n-2$ parties.\n", "  We present results from a 244\\,ks \\textit{NuSTAR} observation of 3C\\,273\nobtained during a cross-calibration campaign with the \\textit{Chandra},\n\\textit{INTEGRAL}, \\textit{Suzaku}, \\textit{Swift}, and \\textit{XMM-Newton}\nobservatories. We show that the spectrum, when fit with a power-law model using\ndata from all observatories except \\textit{INTEGRAL} over the 1--78\\,keV band,\nleaves significant residuals in the \\textit{NuSTAR} data between 30--78\\,keV.\nThe \\nustar\\ 3--78\\,keV spectrum is well-described by an exponentially cutoff\npower-law ($\\Gamma = 1.646 \\pm 0.006$, E$_\\mathrm{cutoff} =\n202_{-34}^{+51}$\\,keV) with a weak reflection component from cold, dense\nmaterial. There is also evidence for a weak ($EW = 23 \\pm 11$ eV) neutral iron\nline. We interpret these features as arising from coronal emission plus\nreflection off an accretion disk or distant material. Beyond 80\\,keV\n\\textit{INTEGRAL} data show clear excess flux relative to an extrapolation of\nthe AGN model fit to \\nustar. This high-energy power-law is consistent with the\npresence of a beamed jet, which begins to dominate over emission from the inner\naccretion flow at 30-40 keV. Modeling the jet locally (in the \\textit{NuSTAR} +\n\\textit{INTEGRAL} band) as a power-law, we find the coronal component is fit by\n$\\Gamma_\\mathrm{AGN} = 1.638 \\pm 0.045$, $E_\\mathrm{cutoff} = 47 \\pm 15$\\,keV,\nand jet photon index by $\\Gamma_\\mathrm{jet} = 1.05 \\pm 0.4$. We also consider\n\\textit{Fermi}/LAT observations of 3C\\,273 and here the broad-band spectrum of\nthe jet can be described by a log-parabolic model, peaking at $\\sim 2$\\,MeV.\nFinally, we investigate the spectral variability in the \\textit{NuSTAR} band\nand find an inverse correlation between flux and $\\Gamma$.\n", "  Absorption spectroscopy is routinely used to characterise chemical and\nbiological samples. For the state-of-the-art in absorption spectroscopy,\nprecision is theoretically limited by shot-noise due to the fundamental\nPoisson-distribution of photon number in laser radiation. In practice, the\nshot-noise limit can only be achieved when all other sources of noise are\neliminated. Here, we use wavelength-correlated and tuneable photon pairs to\ndemonstrate sub-shot-noise absorption spectroscopy. We measure the absorption\nspectra of spectrally-similar biological samples---oxyhaemoglobin and\ncarboxyhaemoglobin---and show that obtaining a given precision in resolution\nrequires fewer heralded single probe photons compared to using an ideal laser.\n", "  In a recent paper, one of us studied spherically symmetric, asymptotically\nflat solutions of Shape Dynamics, finding that the spatial metric has\ncharacteristics of a wormhole - two asymptotically flat ends and a minimal-area\nsphere, or `throat', in between. In this paper we investigate whether that\nsolution can emerge as a result of gravitational collapse of matter. With this\ngoal, we study the simplest kind of spherically-symmetric matter: an\ninfinitely-thin shell of dust. Our system can be understood as a model of a\nstar accreting a thin layer of matter. We solve the dynamics of the shell\nexactly and find that, indeed, as it collapses, the shell leaves in its wake\nthe wormhole metric. In the maximal-slicing time we use for asymptotically flat\nsolutions, the shell only approaches the throat asymptotically and does not\ncross it in a finite amount of time (as measured by a clock `at infinity').\nThis leaves open the possibility that a more realistic cosmological solution of\nShape Dynamics might see this crossing happening in a finite amount of time (as\nmeasured by the change of relational/shape degrees of freedom).\n", "  The dynamics of individuals is of essential importance for understanding the\nevolution of social systems. Most existing models assume that individuals in\ndiverse systems, ranging from social networks to e-commerce, all tend to what\nis already popular. We develop an analytical time-aware framework which shows\nthat when individuals make choices -- which item to buy, for example -- in\nonline social systems, a small fraction of them is consistently successful in\ndiscovering popular items long before they actually become popular. We argue\nthat these users, whom we refer to as discoverers, are fundamentally different\nfrom the previously known opinion leaders, influentials, and innovators. We use\nthe proposed framework to demonstrate that discoverers are present in a wide\nrange of systems. Once identified, they can be used to predict the future\nsuccess of items. We propose a network model which reproduces the discovery\npatterns observed in the real data. Furthermore, data produced by the model\npose a fundamental challenge to classical ranking algorithms which neglect the\ntime of link creation and thus fail to discriminate between discoverers and\nordinary users in the data. Our results open the door to qualitative and\nquantitative study of fine temporal patterns in social systems and have\nfar-reaching implications for network modeling and algorithm design.\n", "  By exploiting the supersymmetric invariant restrictions on the chiral and\nanti-chiral supervariables, we derive the off-shell nilpotent symmetry\ntransformations for a specific (0 + 1)-dimensional N = 2 supersymmetric quantum\nmechanical model which is considered on a (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold\n(parametrized by a bosonic variable t and a pair of Grassmannian variables\n(\\theta, \\bar\\theta). We also provide the geometrical meaning to the symmetry\ntransformations. Finally, we show that this specific N = 2 SUSY quantum\nmechanical model is a model for Hodge theory.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of intersecting D3/D3' brane system overlapping in\n1+1 dimensions, in a holographic treatment where $N$ D3-branes are manifested\nas anti-de-Sitter Schwartzschild geometry, and the D3'-brane is treated as a\nprobe. We extract the thermodynamic equation of state from the set of embedding\nsolutions, and analyze the stability at the perturbative and the\nnon-perturbative level. We review a systematic procedure to resolve local\ninstabilities and multi-valuedness in the equations of state based on classic\nideas of convexity in microcanonical ensumble. We then identify a run-away\nbehavior which was not noticed previously for this system.\n", "  We have identified an optical/X-ray binary with orbital period P_b=5.47h as\nthe likely counterpart of the Fermi source 2FGL J2039.6-5620. GROND, SOAR and\nDES observations provide an accurate orbital period and allow us to compare\nwith the light curve of an archival XMM exposure. Like many short-period\noptical X-ray binaries associated with LAT sources this may be a interacting\n(black widow/redback) millisecond pulsar binary. The X-ray light curve is\nconsistent with the emission associated with an intrabinary shock. The optical\nlight curve shows evidence of companion heating, but has a peculiar asymmetric\ndouble peak. The nature of this optical structure is not yet clear; additional\noptical studies and, especially, detection of an orbital modulation in a\ngamma-ray pulsar are needed to elucidate the nature of this peculiar source.\n", "  Correlations of polarization components in the coordinate frame are a natural\nbasis for searches of parity-violating modes in the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB). This fact can be exploited to build estimators of parity-violating modes\nthat are {\\sl local} and robust with respect to partial-sky coverage or\ninhomogeneous weighting. As an example application of a method based on these\nideas we develop a peak stacking tool that isolates the signature of\nparity-violating modes. We apply the tool to {\\sl Planck} maps and obtain a\nconstraint on the monopole of the polarization rotation angle $\\alpha < 0.72$\ndegrees at $95\\%$ We also demonstrate how the tool can be used as a local\nmethod for reconstructing maps of direction dependent rotation $\\alpha(\\hat\n{n})$.\n", "  The Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms offer two perspectives on quantum\nfield theory. This paper sets up a framework to compare these approaches for\nthe supersymmetric sigma model. The goal is to use techniques from physics to\nconstruct topological invariants. In brief, the Hamiltonian formalism studies\npositive energy representations of super annuli. This leads to a model for\nelliptic cohomology at the Tate curve over $\\mathbb{Z}$. The Lagrangian\napproach studies sections of line bundles over a moduli stack of super tori.\nThis leads to a model for ordinary cohomology valued in weak modular forms over\n$\\mathbb{C}$. Compatibility between the two formalisms is a field theory\nversion of the topological $q$-expansion principle. Combining these ingredients\nconstructs a cohomology theory admitting an orientation for string manifolds\nthat is closely related to Witten's Dirac operator on loop space.\n", "  The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has provided the most detailed view to\ndate of the emission towards the Galactic centre (GC) in high-energy\ngamma-rays. This paper describes the analysis of data taken during the first 62\nmonths of the mission in the energy range 1-100 GeV from a $15^\\circ \\times\n15^\\circ$ region about the direction of the GC, and implications for the\ninterstellar emissions produced by cosmic ray (CR) particles interacting with\nthe gas and radiation fields in the inner Galaxy and for the point sources\ndetected. Specialised interstellar emission models (IEMs) are constructed that\nenable separation of the gamma-ray emission from the inner $\\sim 1$ kpc about\nthe GC from the fore- and background emission from the Galaxy. Based on these\nmodels, the interstellar emission from CR electrons interacting with the\ninterstellar radiation field via the inverse Compton (IC) process and CR nuclei\ninelastically scattering off the gas producing gamma-rays via $\\pi^0$ decays\nfrom the inner $\\sim 1$ kpc is determined. The IC contribution is found to be\ndominant in the region and strongly enhanced compared to previous studies. A\ncatalog of point sources for the $15^\\circ \\times 15^\\circ$ region is\nself-consistently constructed using these IEMs: the First Fermi-LAT Inner\nGalaxy point source Catalog (1FIG). After subtracting the interstellar emission\nand point-source contributions from the data a residual is found that is a\nsub-dominant fraction of the total flux. If spatial templates that peak toward\nthe GC are used to model the positive residual and included in the total model\nfor the $15^\\circ \\times 15^\\circ$ region, the agreement with the data\nimproves, but none of the additional templates account for all of the residual\nstructure. The spectrum of the positive residual modelled with these templates\nhas a strong dependence on the choice of IEM.

They are being used by most e-commerce web sites\nand attract the interest of a broad scientific community. A recommender system\nuses data on users' past preferences to choose new items that might be\nappreciated by a given individual user. While many approaches to recommendation\nexist, the approach based on a network representation of the input data has\ngained considerable attention in the past. We review here a broad range of\nnetwork-based recommendation algorithms and for the first time compare their\nperformance on three distinct real datasets. We present recommendation topics\nthat go beyond the mere question of which algorithm to use - such as the\npossible influence of recommendation on the evolution of systems that use it -\nand finally discuss open research directions and challenges.\n", "  The low energy magnetic excitation spectrum of charge stripe ordered\nLa(2-x)Sr(x)NiO4, x = 0.4 and x = 0.45 samples were studied by neutron\nscattering. Two excitation modes are observed in both materials, one from the\nordered magnetic moments, and a second mode consistent with\npseudo-one-dimensional antiferromagnetic excitations of the charge stripe\nelectrons (q-1D). The dispersion of the q-1D excitation follows the same\nrelation as in x = 1/3 composition, with even spectral weight in the two\ncounter-propagating branches of the x = 0.4 sample, however in the $x = 0.45$\nsample only one dispersion branch has any measurable spectral weight. The\nevolution of the q-1D excitations on doping to the checkerboard charge ordered\nphase is discussed.\n", "  We construct a monomorphism of the De Rham complex of scalar multivalued\nmeromorphic forms on the projective line, holomorphic on the complement to a\nfinite set of points, to the chain complex of the Lie algebra of $sl_2$-valued\nalgebraic functions on the same complement with coefficients in a tensor\nproduct of contragradient Verma modules over the affine Lie algebra\n$\\hat{sl}_2$. We show that the existence of singular vectors in the Verma\nmodules (the Malikov-Feigin-Fuchs singular vectors) is reflected in the new\nrelations between the cohomology classes of logarithmic differential forms.\n", "  If time-translations are spontaneously broken, so are boosts. This symmetry\nbreaking pattern can be non-linearly realized by either just the Goldstone\nboson of time translations, or by four Goldstone bosons associated with time\ntranslations and boosts. In this paper we extend the Effective Field Theory of\nMultifield Inflation to consider the case in which the additional Goldstone\nbosons associated with boosts are light and coupled to the Goldstone boson of\ntime translations. The symmetry breaking pattern forces a coupling to curvature\nso that the mass of the additional Goldstone bosons is predicted to be equal to\n$\\sqrt{2}H$ in the vast majority of the parameter space where they are light.\nThis pattern therefore offers a natural way of generating self-interacting\nparticles with Hubble mass during inflation. After constructing the general\neffective Lagrangian, we study how these particles mix and interact with the\ncurvature fluctuations, generating potentially detectable non-Gaussian signals.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS collaborations recently reported a mild excess in the\ndiphoton final state pointing to a resonance with a mass of around 750 GeV and\na potentially large width. We consider the possibility of a scalar resonance\nbeing produced via gluon fusion and decaying to electroweak gauge bosons, jets\nand pairs of invisible particles, stable at collider scales. We compute limits\nfrom monojet searches on such a resonance and test their compatibility with the\nrequirement for a large width. We also study whether the stable particle can be\na a dark matter candidate and investigate the corresponding relic density\nconstraints along with the collider limits. We show that monojet searches rule\nout a large part of the available parameter space and point out scenarios where\na broad diphoton resonance can be reconciled with monojet constraints.\n", "  Low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with extremely blue optical\nspectral indices are shown to have a mean, velocity-averaged, broad-line\nH$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratio of $\\thickapprox 2.72 \\pm 0.04$, consistent with a\nBaker-Menzel Case B value. Comparison of a wide range of properties of the very\nbluest AGNs with those of a luminosity-matched subset of the Dong et al. blue\nAGN sample indicates that the only difference is the internal reddening.\nUltraviolet fluxes are brighter for the bluest AGNs by an amount consistent\nwith the flat AGN reddening curve of Gaskell et al.(2004). The lack of a\nsignificant difference in the GALEX (FUV--NUV) colour index strongly rules out\na steep SMC-like reddening curve and also argues against an intrinsically\nharder spectrum for the bluest AGNs. For very blue AGNs the Ly$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$\nratio is also consistent with being the Case B value. The Case B ratios provide\nstrong support for the self-shielded broad-line model of Gaskell, Klimek &\nNazarova. It is proposed that the greatly enhanced Ly$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratio at\nvery high velocities is a consequence of continuum fluorescence in the Lyman\nlines (Case C). Reddenings of AGNs mean that the far-UV luminosity is often\nunderestimated by up to an order of magnitude. This is a major factor causing\nthe discrepancies between measured accretion disc sizes and the predictions of\nsimple accretion disc theory. Dust covering fractions for most AGNs are lower\nthan has been estimated. The total mass in lower mass supermassive black holes\nmust be greater than hitherto estimated.\n", "  Josephson circuits provide a realistic physical setup where the light-matter\nfine structure constant can become of order one, allowing to reach a regime\ndominated by non-perturbative effects beyond standard quantum optics. Simple\nprocesses, such as spontaneous emission, thus acquire a many-body character,\nthat can be tackled using a new description of the time-dependent state vector\nin terms of quantum-superposed coherent states. We find that spontaneous atomic\ndecay at ultrastrong coupling leads to the emission of spectrally broad\nSchr\\\"odinger cats rather than of monochromatic single photons. These cats\nstates remain partially entangled with the emitter at intermediate stages of\nthe dynamics, even after emission, due to a large separation in time scales\nbetween fast energy relaxation and exponentially slow decoherence. Once\ndecoherence of the qubit is finally established, quantum information is\ncompletely transfered to the state of the emitted cat.\n", "  We study a static system of self-gravitating radiations confined in a sphere\nby using numerical and analytical calculations. Due to the scaling symmetry of\nradiations, most of main properties of a solution can be represented as a\nsegment of a solution curve on a plane of two-dimensional scale invariant\nvariables. We define an `approximate horizon' (AH) from the analogy with an\napparent horizon. Any solution curve contains a unique point which corresponds\nto the AH. A given solution is uniquely labelled by three parameters\nrepresenting the solution curve, the size of the AH, and the sphere size, which\nare an alternative of the data at the outer boundary. Various geometrical\nproperties including the existence of an AH and the behaviors around the center\ncan be identified from the parameters. We additionally present an analytic\nsolution of the radiations on the verge of forming a blackhole. Analytic\nformulae for the central mass of the naked singularity are given.\n", "  We discuss a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM) that provides an\nexplicit realization of the dark-matter (DM) neutrino-portal paradigm. The dark\nsector is composed of a scalar $ \\Phi $ and a Dirac fermion $ \\Psi $, with the\nlatter assumed to be lighter than the former. These particles interact with the\nSM through the exchange of a set of heavy Dirac fermion mediators that are\nneutral under all local SM symmetries, and also under the dark-sector symmetry\nthat stabilizes the $ \\Psi $ against decay. We show that this model can\naccommodate all experimental and observational constraints provided the DM mass\nis below $\\sim 35\\, \\gev $ or is in a resonant region of the Higgs or $Z$\nboson. We also show that if the dark scalar and dark fermion are almost\ndegenerate in mass, heavier DM fermions are not excluded. We note that in this\nscenario DM annihilation in the cores of astrophysical objects and the galactic\nhalo produces a monochromatic neutrino beam of energy $ \\mfe $, which provides\na clear signature for this paradigm. Other experimental signatures are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Observations of ionised carbon at 158 micron ([CII]) from luminous\nstar-forming galaxies at z~0 show that their ratios of [CII] to far infrared\n(FIR) luminosity are systematically lower than those of more modestly\nstar-forming galaxies. In this paper, we provide a theory for the origin of\nthis so called \"[CII] deficit\" in galaxies. Our model treats the interstellar\nmedium as a collection of clouds with radially-stratified chemical and thermal\nproperties, which are dictated by the clouds' volume and surface densities, as\nwell as the interstellar radiation and cosmic ray fields to which they are\nexposed. [CII] emission arises from the outer, HI dominated layers of clouds,\nand from regions where the hydrogen is H2 but the carbon is predominantly C+.\nIn contrast, the most shielded regions of clouds are dominated by CO and\nproduce little [CII] emission. This provides a natural mechanism to explain the\nobserved [CII]-star formation relation: galaxies' star formation rates are\nlargely driven by the surface densities of their clouds. As this rises, so does\nthe fraction of gas in the CO-dominated phase that produces little [CII]\nemission. Our model further suggests that the apparent offset in the [CII]-FIR\nrelation for high-z sources compared to those at present epoch may arise from\nsystematically larger gas masses at early times: a galaxy with a large gas mass\ncan sustain a high star formation rate even with relatively modest surface\ndensity, allowing copious [CII] emission to coexist with rapid star formation.\n", "  We present the first application of the newly developed EKK theory of the\neffective nucleon-nucleon interaction to shell-model studies of exotic nuclei,\nincluding those where conventional approaches with fitted interactions\nencounter difficulties. This EKK theory enables us to derive the interaction\nsuitable for several major shells ($sd$+$pf$ in this work). By using such an\neffective interaction obtained from the Entem-Machleidt QCD-based\n$\\chi\\mathrm{N}^3\\mathrm{LO}$ interaction and the Fujita-Miyazawa three-body\nforce, the energies, E2 properties and spectroscopic factors of low-lying\nstates of neutron-rich Ne, Mg and Si isotopes are nicely described, as the\nfirst shell-model description of the \"island of inversion\" without fit of the\ninteraction. The long-standing question as to how particle-hole excitations\noccur across the $sd$-$pf$ magic gap is clarified with distinct differences\nfrom the conventional approaches. The shell evolution is shown to appear\nsimilarly to earlier studies.\n", "  Debris disks offer valuable insights into the latest stages of circumstellar\ndisk evolution, and can possibly help us to trace the outcomes of planetary\nformation processes. In the age range 10 to 100\\,Myr, most of the gas is\nexpected to have been removed from the system, giant planets (if any) must have\nalready been formed, and the formation of terrestrial planets may be on-going.\nPluto-sized planetesimals, and their debris released in a collisional cascade,\nare under their mutual gravitational influence, which may result into\nnon-axisymmetric structures in the debris disk. High angular resolution\nobservations are required to investigate these effects and constrain the\ndynamical evolution of debris disks. Furthermore, multi-wavelength observations\ncan provide information about the dust dynamics by probing different grain\nsizes. Here we present new VLT/SPHERE and ALMA observations of the debris disk\naround the 40\\,Myr-old solar-type star HD\\,61005. We resolve the disk at\nunprecedented resolution both in the near-infrared (in scattered and polarized\nlight) and at millimeter wavelengths. Thanks to the new observations, we\npropose a solution for both the radial and azimuthal distribution of the dust\ngrains in the debris disk. We find that the disk has a moderate eccentricity\n($e \\sim 0.1$) and that the dust density is two times larger at the pericenter\ncompared to the apocenter. With no giant planets detected in our observations,\nwe investigate alternative explanations besides planet-disk interactions to\ninterpret the inferred disk morphology. We postulate that the morphology of the\ndisk could be the consequence of a massive collision between\n$\\sim$\\,1000\\,km-sized bodies at $\\sim$\\,61\\,au. If this interpretation holds,\nit would put stringent constraints on the formation of massive planetesimals at\nlarge distances from the star.\n", "  The particle discovered in the Higgs boson searches at the LHC with a mass of\nabout 125 GeV can be identified with one of the neutral Higgs bosons of the\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). We calculate predictions\nfor the Higgs-boson masses in the NMSSM using the Feynman-diagrammatic\napproach. The predictions are based on the full NMSSM one-loop corrections\nsupplemented with the dominant and sub-dominant two-loop corrections within the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). These include contributions at\n$\\mathcal{O}{\\left(\\alpha_t \\alpha_s, \\alpha_b \\alpha_s,\n\\alpha_t^2,\\alpha_t\\alpha_b\\right)}$, as well as a resummation of leading and\nsubleading logarithms from the top/scalar top sector. Taking these corrections\ninto account in the prediction for the mass of the Higgs boson in the NMSSM\nthat is identified with the observed signal is crucial in order to reach a\nprecision at a similar level as in the MSSM. The quality of the approximation\nmade at the two-loop level is analysed on the basis of the full one-loop\nresult, with a particular focus on the prediction for the Standard Model-like\nHiggs boson that is associated with the observed signal. The obtained results\nwill be used as a basis for the extension of the code FeynHiggs to the NMSSM.\n", "  Quantum state transfer into a memory, state shuttling over long distances via\na quantum bus, and high-fidelity readout are important tasks for quantum\ntechnology. Realizing these tasks is challenging in the presence of realistic\ncouplings to an environment. Here, we introduce and assess protocols that can\nbe used in cavity QED to perform high-fidelity quantum state transfer and fast\nquantum nondemolition qubit readout through Hamiltonian engineering. We show\nthat high-fidelity state transfer between a cavity and a single qubit can be\nperformed, even in the limit of strong dephasing due to inhomogeneous\nbroadening. We generalize this result to state transfer between a cavity and a\nlogical qubit encoded in a collective mode of a large ensemble of $N$ physical\nqubits. Under a decoupling sequence, we show that inhomogeneity in the ensemble\ncouples two collective bright states to only two other collective modes,\nleaving the remaining $N-3$ single-excitation states dark. Moreover, we show\nthat large signal-to-noise and high single-shot fidelity can be achieved in a\ncavity-based qubit readout, even in the weak-coupling limit. These ideas may be\nimportant for novel systems coupling single spins to a microwave cavity.\n", "  Strong electronic interactions and spin orbit coupling can be conducive for\nrealizing novel broken symmetry phases supporting quasiparticles with\nnontrivial band topology. 227 pyrochlore iridates provide a suitable material\nplatform for studying such emergent phenomena where both topology and competing\norders play important roles. In contrast to the most members of this material\nclass, which are thought to display \"all-in all-out\" (AIAO) type magnetically\nordered low-temperature insulating ground states, Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ remains\nmetallic while exhibiting \"spin ice\" (SI) correlations at low temperatures.\nAdditionally, this is the only 227 iridate compound, which exhibits a large\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) along [1,1,1] direction below 1.5 K, without\npossessing any measurable magnetic moment. By focusing on the normal state of\n227 iridates, described by a parabolic semimetal with quadratic band touching,\nwe use renormalization group analysis, mean-field theory, and phenomenological\nLandau theory as three complementary methods to construct a global phase\ndiagram in the presence of generic local interactions among itinerant electrons\nof Ir ions. While the global phase diagram supports several competing\nmultipolar orders, motivated by the phenomenology of 227 iridates we\nparticularly emphasize the competition between AIAO and SI orders and how it\ncan cause a mixed phase with \"three-in one-out\" (3I1O) spin configurations. In\nterms of topological properties of Weyl quasiparticles of the 3I1O state, we\nprovide an explanation for the magnitude and the direction of the observed AHE\nin Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. We propose a strain induced enhancement of the onset\ntemperature for AHE in thin films of Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and additional\nexperiments for studying competing orders in the vicinity of the\nmetal-insulator transition.\n", "  We investigate many-body dynamics in a one-dimensional interacting\nperiodically driven system, based on a partially-filled version of Thouless's\ntopologically quantized adiabatic pump. The corresponding single particle\nFloquet bands are chiral, with the Floquet spectrum realizing nontrivial cycles\naround the quasienergy Brillouin zone. For generic filling, with either bosons\nor fermions, the system is gapless; here the driving cannot be adiabatic and\nthe system is expected to rapidly absorb energy from the driving field. We\nidentify parameter regimes where scattering between Floquet bands of opposite\nchirality is exponentially suppressed, opening a long time window where the\nmany-body dynamics separately conserves the occupations of the two chiral\nbands. Within this intermediate time regime we predict that the system reaches\na chiral quasi-steady state. This state is universal in the sense that the\ncurrent it carries is determined solely by the density of particles in each\nband and the topological winding numbers of the Floquet bands. This remarkable\nbehavior, which holds for both bosons and fermions, may be readily studied\nexperimentally in recently developed cold atom systems.\n", "  This paper considers the geometry of $E_8$ from a Clifford point of view in\nthree complementary ways. Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to\nconstruct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3D root\nsystems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4D even\nsubalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root system\n$H_3$ gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional)\nnon-crystallographic root system $H_4$. Arnold's trinities and the McKay\ncorrespondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the\nicosahedron and $E_8$. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made\nthis connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D\nspace the $120$ elements of the icosahedral group $H_3$ are doubly covered by\n$240$ 8-component objects, which endowed with a `reduced inner product' are\nexactly the $E_8$ root system. It was previously known that $E_8$ splits into\n$H_4$-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the\ntwo pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the\nconstruction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the\nCoxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete\nfactorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials\nof bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle\ngiving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the\nusual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In\nparticular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root\nsystems, $D_6$ as well as $E_8$, whose Coxeter versor factorises as\n$W=\\exp(\\frac{\\pi}{30}B_C)\\exp(\\frac{11\\pi}{30}B_2)\\exp(\\frac{7\\pi}{30}B_3)\\exp(\\frac{13\\pi}{30}B_4)$.\n", "  We investigate the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene as a function\nof the density of defects, ND, introduced in a controllable way. Graphene\nlayers are synthesized using chemical vapor deposition, transferred onto a\ntransmission electron microscopy grid, and suspended over ~7.5-micrometer size\nsquare holes. Defects are induced by irradiation of graphene with the\nlow-energy electron beam (20 keV) and quantified by the Raman D-to-G peak\nintensity ratio. As the defect density changes from 2.0x10^10 cm-2 to 1.8x10^11\ncm-2 the thermal conductivity decreases from ~(1.8+/-0.2)x10^3 W/mK to\n~(4.0+/-0.2)x10^2 W/mK near room temperature. At higher defect densities, the\nthermal conductivity reveals an intriguing saturation behavior at a relatively\nhigh value of ~400 W/mK. The thermal conductivity dependence on defect density\nis analyzed using the Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics\nsimulations. The results are important for understanding phonon - point defect\nscattering in two-dimensional systems and for practical applications of\ngraphene in thermal management.\n", "  We study critical behaviour of a magnet with cubic anisotropy and quenched\nscalar disorder which is taken into account by replica method. We derive to\nfirst order in $\\epsilon$ approximation the renormalization group equations\ntaking into account possible replica symmetry breaking. We study the stability\nof the replica symmetric fixed points with respect to perturbations without (in\ngeneral case) replica symmetry. However, we find that if a fixed point is\nstable with respect to replica symmetric deviations, it is also stable with\nrespect to deviations without replica symmetry.\n", "  We investigate the chiral sine-Gordon model using the renormalization group\nmethod. The chiral sine-Gordon model is a model for $G$-valued fields and\ndescribes a new class of phase transitions, where $G$ is a compact Lie group.\nWe show that the model is renormalizable by means of a perturbation expansion\nand we derive beta functions of the renormalization group theory. The\ncoefficients of beta functions are represented by the Casimir invariants. The\nmodel contains both asymptotically free and ultraviolet strong coupling\nregions. The beta functions have a zero which is a bifurcation point that\ndivides the parameter space into two regions; they are the weak coupling region\nand the strong coupling region. A large-$N$ model is also considered. This\nmodel is reduced to the conventional sine-Gordon model that describes the\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition near the fixed point. In the strong-coupling\nlimit, the model is reduced to a $U(N)$ matrix model.\n", "  Spectral distortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer the\npossibility of probing processes which occurred during the evolution of our\nUniverse going back up to Z$\\simeq 10^7$. Unfortunately all the attempts so far\ncarried out for detecting distortions failed. All of them were based on\ncomparisons among absolute measurements of the CMB temperature at different\nfrequencies. We suggest a different approach: measurements of the frequency\nderivative of the CMB temperature over large frequency intervals instead of\nobservations of the absolute temperature at few, well separated, frequencies as\nfrequently done in the past, and, direct measurements of the foregrounds which\nhinder bobservations, at the same site and with the same radiometer prepared\nfor the search of CMB distortions. We discuss therefore the perspectives of new\nobservations in the next years from the ground, at very special sites, or in\nspace as independent missions or part of other CMB projects\n", "  We study the problem of compilation of quantum algorithms into optimized\nphysical-level circuits executable in a quantum information processing (QIP)\nexperiment based on trapped atomic ions. We report a complete strategy:\nstarting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program, we\ncompile it into a high-level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages\nof decomposition into progressively lower-level circuits until we reach the\nphysical execution-level specification. We skip the fault-tolerance layer, as\nit is not within the scope of this work. The different stages are structured so\nas to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account\nnumerous optimization criteria, including minimizing the number of expensive\ntwo-qubit gates, minimizing the number of less expensive single-qubit gates,\noptimizing the runtime, minimizing the overall circuit error, and optimizing\nclassical control sequences. Our approach allows a trade-off between circuit\nruntime and quantum error, as well as to accommodate future changes in the\noptimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated\nimprovements in the physical-level control of the experiment.\n", "  We investigate the role of bulk viscous pressure on the warm inflationary\nmodified Chaplygin gas in brane-world framework in the presence of standard\nscalar field. We assume the intermediate inflationary scenario in strong\ndissipative regime and constructed the inflaton, potential, entropy density,\nslow-roll parameters, scalar and tensor power spectra, scalar spectral index\nand tensor-to-scalar ratio. We develop various trajectories such as $n_s - N$,\n$n_s - r$ and $n_s - \\alpha_s$ (where $n_s$ is the spectral index, $\\alpha_s$\nis the running of spectral index, $N$ is the number of e-folds and $r$ is\ntensor-to-scalar ratio) for variable as well as constant dissipation and bulk\nviscous coefficients at high dissipative regime. It is interesting to remark\nhere that our results of these parameters are compatible with recent\nobservational data such as WMAP $7+9$, BICEP$2$ and Planck data.\n", "  We study a novel proposal for the origin of cosmological cold dark matter\n(CDM) which is rooted in the quantum nature of spacetime. In this model,\noff-shell modes of quantum fields can exist in asymptotic states as a result of\nspacetime nonlocality (expected in generic theories of quantum gravity), and\nplay the role of CDM, which we dub off-shell dark matter (OfDM). However, their\nrate of production is suppressed by the scale of non-locality (e.g. Planck\nlength). As a result, we show that OfDM is only produced in the first moments\nof big bang, and then effectively decouples (except through its gravitational\ninteractions). We examine the observational predictions of this model: In the\ncontext of cosmic inflation, we show that this proposal relates the reheating\ntemperature to the inflaton mass, which narrows down the uncertainty in the\nnumber of e-foldings of specific inflationary scenarios. We also demonstrate\nthat OfDM is indeed cold, and discuss potentially observable signatures on\nsmall scale matter power spectrum.\n", "  Nonlocality is one of the main characteristic features of quantum systems\ninvolving more than one spatially separated subsystems. It is manifested\ntheoretically as well as experimentally through violation of some local\nrealistic inequality. On the other hand, classical behavior of all physical\nphenomena in the macroscopic limit gives a general intuition that any physical\ntheory for describing microscopic phenomena should resemble classical physics\nin the macroscopic regime-- the so-called macro-realism. In the 2-2-2 scenario\n(two parties, each performing two measurements, each measurement with two\noutcomes), contemplating all the no-signaling correlations, we characterize\nwhich of them would exhibit classical (local-realistic) behavior in the\nmacroscopic limit. Interestingly, we find correlations which at single copy\nlevel violate the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality by an amount less\nthan optimal quantum violation (i.e. the Cirel'son bound $2\\sqrt{2}$), but in\nthe macroscopic limit gives rise to a value which is higher than $2\\sqrt{2}$.\nSuch correlations are therefore not considered as physical. Our study thus\nprovides a sufficient criterion to identify some of unphysical correlations.\n", "  We study the collective dynamics of elongated swimmers in a very thin fluid\nlayer by devising long, filamentous, non-tumbling bacteria. The strong\nconfinement induces weak nematic alignment upon collision, which, for large\nenough density of cells, gives rise to global nematic order. This homogeneous\nbut fluctuating phase, observed on the largest experimentally-accessible scale\nof millimeters, exhibits the properties predicted by standard models for\nflocking such as the Vicsek-style model of polar particles with nematic\nalignment: true long-range nematic order and non-trivial giant number\nfluctuations.\n", "  Investigating relation between various structural patterns found in\nreal-world networks and stability of underlying systems is crucial to\nunderstand importance and evolutionary origin of such patterns. We evolve\nmultiplex networks, comprising of anti-symmetric couplings in one layer,\ndepicting predator-prey relation, and symmetric couplings in the other,\ndepicting mutualistic (or competitive) relation, based on stability\nmaximization through the largest eigenvalue. We find that the correlated\nmultiplexity emerges as evolution progresses. The evolved values of the\ncorrelated multiplexity exhibit a dependence on the inter-link coupling\nstrength. Furthermore, the inter-layer coupling strength governs the evolution\nof disassortativity property in the individual layers. We provide analytical\nunderstanding to these findings by considering star like networks in both the\nlayers. The model and tools used here are useful for understanding the\nprinciples governing the stability as well as importance of such patterns in\nthe underlying networks of real-world systems.\n", "  Reliable determination of Rotation-Activity Correlation (RAC's) depends on\nprecise measurements of the following stellar parameters: $T_{eff}$, parallax,\nradius, metallicity, and rotational speed $v\\sin i$. In this paper, our goal is\nto focus on the determination of these parameters for a sample of K and M\ndwarfs. In a future paper (Paper II), we will combine our rotational data with\nactivity data in order to construct RAC's.\n  Here, we report on a determination of effective temperatures based on the\n(R-I)$_C$ color from the calibrations of Mann et al. (2015) and Kenyon \\&\nHartmann (1995) for four samples of late-K, dM2, dM3 and dM4 stars. We also\ndetermine stellar parameters ($T_{eff}$, $log(g)$ and [M/H]) using the\nPCA-based inversion technique for a sample of 105 late-K dwarfs. We compile all\neffective temperatures from the literature for this sample. We determine\nempirical radius-[M/H] correlations in our stellar samples. This allows us to\npropose new effective temperatures, stellar radii, and metallicities for a\nlarge sample of 612 late-K and M dwarfs. Our mean radii agree well with those\nof Boyajian et al. (2012).\n  We analyze HARPS and SOPHIE spectra of 105 late-K dwarfs, and have detected\n$v\\sin i$ in 92 stars. In combination with our previous $v\\sin i$ measurements\nin M and K dwarfs, we now derive $P/sin i$ measures for a sample of 418 K and M\ndwarfs. We investigate the distributions of $P/sin i$ and we show that they are\ndifferent from one spectral sub-type to another at a 99.9\\% confidence level.\n", "  Spatially localised defect structures emerge spontaneously in a hydrodynamic\ndescription of an active polar fluid comprising polar 'actin' filaments and\n'myosin' motor proteins that (un)bind to filaments and exert active contractile\nstresses. These emergent defect structures are characterized by distinct\ntextures and can be either static or mobile - we derive effective equations of\nmotion for these 'extended particles' and analyse their shape, kinetics,\ninteractions and scattering. Depending on the impact parameter and propulsion\nspeed, these active defects undergo elastic scattering or merger. Our results\nare relevant for the dynamics of actomyosin-dense structures at the cell\ncortex, reconstituted actomyosin complexes and 2D active colloidal gels.\n", "  Several Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) have been detected in the TeV band in the\nlast decade.The TeV emission is typically interpreted in a purely leptonic\nscenario, but this usually requires that the magnetic field in the Nebula be\nmuch lower than the equipartition value and the assumption of an enhanced\ntarget radiation at IR frequencies. In this work we consider the possibility\nthat, in addition to the relativistic electrons, also relativistic hadrons are\npresent in these nebulae. Assuming that part of the emitted TeV photons are of\nhadronic origin, we compute the associated flux of $\\sim 1-100$ TeV neutrinos.\nWe use the IceCube non detection to put constraints on the fraction of TeV\nphotons that might be contributed by hadrons and estimate the number of\nneutrino events that can be expected from these sources in ANTARES and in\nKM3Net.\n", "  Measuring gamma-ray burst (GRB) properties in their rest-frame is crucial to\nunderstand the physics at work in gamma-ray bursts. This can only be done for\nGRBs with known redshift. Since redshifts are usually measured from the optical\nspectrum of the afterglow, correlations between prompt and afterglow emissions\nmay introduce biases in the distribution of rest-frame properties of the prompt\nemission. Our analysis is based on a sample of 90 GRBs with good optical\nfollow-up and well measured prompt emission. 76 of them have a measure of\nredshift and 14 have no redshift. We estimate their optical brightness with\ntheir R magnitude measured two hours after the trigger and compare the rest\nframe prompt properties of different classes of GRB afterglow brightness. We\nfind that the optical brightness of GRBs in our sample is mainly driven by\ntheir intrinsic afterglow luminosity. We show that GRBs with low and high\nafterglow optical fluxes have similar Epi , Eiso , Liso , indicating that the\nrest-frame distributions computed from GRBs with a redshift are not\nsignificantly distorted by optical selection effects. However we found that the\nrest frame T90 distribution is not immune to optical selection effect, which\nfavor the selection of GRBs with longer durations. Finally, we note that GRBs\nin the upper part of the Epi-Eiso plane have fainter optical afterglows and we\nshow that optical selection effects strongly favor the detection of GRBs with\nbright afterglows located close or below the best-fit Epi-Eiso relation, whose\nredshift is easily measurable.\n", "  We study the signatures of reionization and ionizing properties of the early\ngalaxies in the cross-correlations between the 21cm emission from the spin-flip\ntransition of neutral hydrogen (HI) and the underlying galaxy population, in\nparticular a sub-population of galaxies visible as Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs).\nWith both observables simultaneously derived from a $z\\simeq6.6$ hydrodynamical\nsimulation (GADGET-2) snapshot post-processed with a radiative transfer code\n(pCRASH) and a dust model, we perform a parameter study and aim to constrain\nboth the average intergalactic medium (IGM) ionization state ($1-\\langle\n\\chi_{HI} \\rangle$) and the reionization topology (outside-in versus\ninside-out). We find that in our model LAEs occupy the densest and most-ionized\nregions resulting in a very strong anti-correlation between the LAEs and the\n21cm emission. A 1000h SKA-LOW1 - Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam experiment can\nprovide constraints on $\\langle \\chi_{HI} \\rangle$, allowing us to distinguish\nbetween IGM ionization levels of 50%, 25%, 10% and fully ionized at scales\n$r<10$ comoving Mpc (assuming foreground avoidance for SKA). Our results\nsupport the inside-out reionization scenario where the densest knots\n(under-dense voids) are ionized first (last) for $\\langle \\chi_{HI} \\rangle >=\n0.1$. Further, 1000h SKA-LOW1 observations should be able to confirm the\ninside-out scenario by detecting a lower 21cm brightness temperature (by about\n2-10 mK) in the densest regions ($> 2$ arcminute scales) hosting LAEs compared\nto lower-density regions devoid of them.\n", "  (abidged) Context: Stellar convection zones are characterized by vigorous\nhigh-Reynolds number turbulence at low Prandtl numbers. Aims: We study the\ndynamo and differential rotation regimes at varying levels of viscous, thermal,\nand magnetic diffusion. Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of\nstratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating\nspherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to\n2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high\nthermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the\nbottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.\nFor sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at\nmid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased. This coincides with a\nchange in the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to\nequatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the cyclic solutions disappear at\nthe highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. The total magnetic energy increases with\nthe magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here ($5-151$), but the\nenergies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers. The differential rotation is strongly affected by the magnetic fields\nand almost vanishes at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. In some of our\nmost turbulent cases we find that two regimes are possible where either\ndifferential rotation is strong and mean magnetic fields relatively weak or\nvice versa. Conclusions: Our simulations indicate a strong non-linear feedback\nof magnetic fields on differential rotation, leading to qualitative changes in\nthe behaviors of large-scale dynamos at high magnetic Reynolds numbers.\nFurthermore, we do not find indications of the simulations approaching an\nasymptotic regime where the results would be independent of diffusion\ncoefficients.\n", "  We investigate both the classical and quantum gravitational collapse of a\ncharged, non-rotating $n$-dimensional BTZ black hole in AdS space. This is done\nby first deriving the conserved mass of a \"spherically\" symmetric domain wall,\nwhich is then taken as the classical Hamiltonian of the domain wall.\n  In the classical picture, we show that, as far as the asymptotic observer is\nconcerned, the details of the collapse depend on the amount of charge present\nin the domain wall. In the both the extremal and non-extremal cases, the\ncollapse takes an infinite amount of observer time to complete. However, in the\nover-charged case, the collapse never actually occurs, instead one finds an\noscillatory solution which prevents the formation of a naked singularity. As\nfar as the infalling observer is concerned, the collapse is completed within a\nfinite amount of proper time. Thus, the gravitational collapse follows that of\nthe typical formation of a black hole via gravitational collapse.\n  Quantum mechanically, in the absence of induced quasi-particle production and\nfluctuations of the metric geometry, we take primary interest in the behavior\nof the collapse near the horizon and near the classical singularity from the\npoint of view of both asymptotic and infalling observers. For the asymptotic\nobserver, we find that quantum effects near the horizon do not change the\nclassical conclusions. For the infalling observer, the most interesting quantum\nmechanical effect are when the collapsing shell approaches the classical\nsingularity. Here, we find, that the quantum effects in this region display\nnon-local effects, which depend on the energy density of the domain wall.\n", "  We consider the spin-orbit-induced spin Hall effect and spin swapping in\ndiffusive superconductors. By employing the non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's\nfunction technique in the quasiclassical approximation, we derive coupled\ntransport equations for the spectral spin and particle distributions and for\nthe energy density in the elastic scattering regime. We compute four\ncontributions to the spin Hall conductivity, namely, skew scattering,\nside-jump, anomalous velocity, and the Yafet contribution. The reduced density\nof states in the superconductor causes a renormalization of the spin Hall\nangle. We demonstrate that all four of these contributions to the spin Hall\nconductivity are renormalized in the same way in the superconducting state. In\nits simplest manifestation, spin swapping transforms a primary spin current\ninto a secondary spin current with swapped current and polarization directions.\nWe find that the spin-swapping coefficient is not explicitly but only\nimplicitly affected by superconducting correlations through the renormalized\ndiffusion coefficients. We discuss experimental consequences for measurements\nof the (inverse) spin Hall effect and spin swapping in four-terminal\ngeometries. In our geometry, below the superconducting transition temperature,\nthe spin-swapping signal is increased an order of magnitude while changes in\nthe (inverse) spin Hall signal are moderate.\n", "  We suggest a hybrid plasmonic device consisting of a bimodal metallic\nnanoantenna coupled to an incoherently pumped quantum emitter. This hybrid\ndevice emits light into the two modes entangled in the number of photons. The\nprocess is a prime example where losses are turned from a nuisance into\nsomething beneficial, since, even though counterintuitively, the entanglement\nis enabled by strong incoherent processes, i.e. dominant scattering and\nabsorption rates of the nanoantenna. Both, the high emission rate and the\ndegree of entanglement of the emitted light are insensitive with respect to\nimperfections in the nanoantenna geometry, rendering the scheme feasible for an\nimplementation.\n", "  We show that implementations for quantum sensing with exceptional sensitivity\nand spatial resolution can be made using spin-3/2 semiconductor defect states.\nWe illustrate this using the silicon monovacancy deep center in hexagonal SiC\nbased on our rigorous derivation of this defect's ground state and of its\nelectronic and optical properties. For a single $\\textrm{V}_{\\textrm{Si}}^-$\ndefect, we obtain magnetic field sensitivities capable of detecting individual\nnuclear magnetic moments. We also show that its zero-field splitting has an\nexceptional strain and temperature sensitivity within the technologically\ndesirable near-infrared window of biological systems. The concepts and sensing\nschemes developed here are applicable to other point defects with half spin\nmultiplet ($S\\geq 3/2$) configuration.\n", "  Mechanical resonators represent one of the most promising candidates to\nmediate the interaction between different quantum technologies, bridging the\ngap between efficient quantum computation and long-distance quantum\ncommunication. In this letter, we introduce a novel interferometric scheme\nwhere the interaction of a mechanical resonator with input/output quantum\npulses is controlled by an independent classical drive. We design protocols for\nstate teleportation and direct quantum state transfer, between distant\nmechanical resonators. The proposed device, feasible with state-of-the-art\ntechnology, can serve as building block for the implementation of long-distance\nquantum networks of mechanical resonators.\n", "  We analyze the nature of Mott metal-insulator transition in multiorbital\nsystems using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The auxiliary multiorbital\nquantum impurity problem is solved using continuous time quantum Monte Carlo\n(CTQMC) and the rotationally invariant slave-boson (RISB) mean field\napproximation. We focus our analysis on the Kanamori Hamiltonian and find that\nthere are two markedly different regimes determined by the nature of the lowest\nenergy excitations of the atomic Hamiltonian. The RISB results at $T\\to0$\nsuggest the following rule of thumb for the order of the transition at zero\ntemperature: a second order transition is to be expected if the lowest lying\nexcitations of the atomic Hamiltonian are charge excitations, while the\ntransition tends to be first order if the lowest lying excitations are in the\nsame charge sector as the atomic ground state. At finite temperatures the\ntransition is first order and its strength, as measured e.g. by the jump in the\nquasiparticle weight at the transition, is stronger in the parameter regime\nwhere the RISB method predicts a first order transition at zero temperature.\nInterestingly, these results seem to apply to a wide variety of models and\nparameter regimes.\n", "  Canonical quantization is reviewed here for the Abelian Lee-Wick model by\nusing the Dirac constraints method, a Gupta-Bleuler-like prescription is\nimplemented and the BRST charge operator for this model is built. New degrees\nof freedom associated to the (higher derivatives) Lee-Wick ghost are excluded\nfrom the (physical) space of observables by the imposition of a\nPiguet-Nielsen-type BRST-extended symmetry for the Lee-Wick mass term, removing\nthe Lee-Wick mass parameter of the theory, which implies remove all the\nhigher-derivative sector. In addition, another prescription based on a new\nsubsidiary condition of invariance under a purely higher-derivative BRST-type\nnew symmetry is proposed.\n", "  We carry out controlled $N$-body simulations that follow the dynamical\nevolution of binary stars in the dark matter (DM) haloes of ultra-faint dwarf\nspheroidals (dSphs). We find that wide binaries with semi-major axes $a\\gtrsim\na_t$ tend to be quickly disrupted by the tidal field of the halo. In smooth\npotentials the truncation scale, $a_t$, is mainly governed by (i) the mass\nenclosed within the dwarf half-light radius ($R_h$) and (ii) the slope of the\nDM halo profile at $R\\approx R_h$, and is largely independent of the initial\neccentricity distribution of the binary systems and the anisotropy of the\nstellar orbits about the galactic potential. For the reported velocity\ndispersion and half-light radius of Segue I, the closest ultra-faint, our\nmodels predict $a_t$ values that are a factor 2--3 smaller in cuspy haloes than\nin any of the cored models considered here. Using mock observations of Segue I\nwe show that measuring the projected two-point correlation function of stellar\npairs with sub-arcsecond resolution may provide a useful tool to constrain the\namount and distribution of DM in the smallest and most DM-dominated galaxies.\n", "  We present a model of the early chemical composition and elemental abundances\nof planetary atmospheres based on the cumulative gaseous chemical species that\nare accreted onto planets forming by core accretion from evolving\nprotoplanetary disks. The astrochemistry of the host disk is computed using an\nionization driven, non-equilibrium chemistry network within viscously evolving\ndisk models. We accrete gas giant planets whose orbital evolution is controlled\nby planet traps using the standard core accretion model and track the chemical\ncomposition of the material that is accreted onto the protoplanet. We choose a\nfiducial disk model and evolve planets in 3 traps - water ice line, dead zone\nand heat transition. For a disk with a lifetime of 4.1 Myr we produce two Hot\nJupiters (M = 1.43, 2.67 M$_{\\rm Jupiter}$, r = 0.15, 0.11 AU) in the heat\ntransition and ice line trap and one failed core (M = 0.003 M$_{\\rm Jupiter}$,\nr =3.7 AU) in the dead zone. These planets are found with mixing ratios for CO\nand H$_2$O of $1.99\\times 10^{-4}$, $5.0\\times 10^{-4}$ respectively for both\nHot Jupiters. Additionally for these planets we find CO$_2$ and CH$_4$, with\nmixing ratios of $1.8\\times 10^{-6}\\rightarrow 9.8\\times 10^{-10}$ and\n$1.1\\times 10^{-8}\\rightarrow 2.3\\times 10^{-10}$ respectively. These ranges\ncorrespond well with the mixing ratio ranges that have been inferred through\nthe detection of emission spectra from Hot Jupiters by multiple authors. We\ncompute a carbon-to-oxygen ratio of 0.227 for the ice line planet and 0.279 for\nthe heat transition planet. These planets accreted their gas inside the ice\nline, hence the sub-solar C/O.\n", "  Anomalous diffusion processes, in particular superdiffusive ones, are known\nto be efficient strategies for searching and navigation by animals and also in\nhuman mobility. One way to create such regimes are L\\'evy flights, where the\nwalkers are allowed to perform jumps, the \"flights\", that can eventually be\nvery long as their length distribution is asymptotically power-law distributed.\nIn our work, we present a model in which walkers are allowed to perform, on a\n1D lattice, \"cascades\" of $n$ unitary steps instead of one jump of a randomly\ngenerated length, as in the L\\'evy case, where $n$ is drawn from a cascade\ndistribution $p_n$. We show that this local mechanism may give rise to\nsuperdiffusion or normal diffusion when $p_n$ is distributed as a power law. We\nalso introduce waiting times that are power-law distributed as well and\ntherefore the probability distribution scaling is steered by the two PDF's\npower-law exponents. As a perspective, our approach may engender a possible\ngeneralization of anomalous diffusion in context where distances are difficult\nto define, as in the case of complex networks, and also provide an interesting\nmodel for diffusion in temporal networks.\n", "  In spite of their conjectured importance for the Epoch of Reionization, the\nproperties of low-mass galaxies are currently still under large debate. In this\narticle, we study the stellar and gaseous properties of faint, low-mass\ngalaxies at z>3. We observed the Frontier Fields cluster Abell S1063 with MUSE\nover a 2 arcmin^2 field, and combined integral-field spectroscopy with\ngravitational lensing to perform a blind search for intrinsically faint Lya\nemitters (LAEs). We determined in total the redshift of 172 galaxies of which\n14 are lensed LAEs at z=3-6.1. We increased the number of\nspectroscopically-confirmed multiple-image families from 6 to 17 and updated\nour gravitational-lensing model accordingly. The lensing-corrected Lya\nluminosities are with L(Lya) <= 10^41.5 erg/s among the lowest for\nspectroscopically confirmed LAEs at any redshift. We used expanding gaseous\nshell models to fit the Lya line profile, and find low column densities and\nexpansion velocities. This is to our knowledge the first time that gaseous\nproperties of such faint galaxies at z>=3 are reported. We performed SED\nmodelling to broadband photometry from the U-band through the infrared to\ndetermine the stellar properties of these LAEs. The stellar masses are very low\n(10^{6-8} Msun), and are accompanied by very young ages of 1-100 Myr. The very\nhigh specific star formation rates (~100 Gyr^-1) are characteristic of\nstarburst galaxies. The UV-continuum slopes beta are low in our sample, with\nbeta<-2 for all galaxies with M_star<10^8 Msun. We conclude that our low-mass\ngalaxies at 3<z<6 are forming stars at higher rates when correcting for stellar\nmass effects than seen locally or in more massive galaxies. The young stellar\npopulations with high star-formation rates and low HI column densities lead to\ncontinuum slopes and LyC-escape fractions expected for a scenario where low\nmass galaxies reionise the Universe.\n", "  Analytical results for the distribution of first hitting times of random\nwalks on Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks are presented. Starting from a random\ninitial node, a random walker hops between adjacent nodes until it hits a node\nwhich it has already visited before. At this point, the path terminates. The\npath length, namely the number of steps, $d$, pursued by the random walker from\nthe initial node up to its termination is called the first hitting time or the\nfirst intersection length. Using recursion equations, we obtain analytical\nresults for the tail distribution of the path lengths, $P(d > \\ell)$. The\nresults are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations. It\nis found %turns out that the distribution $P(d > \\ell)$ follows a product of an\nexponential distribution and a Rayleigh distribution. The mean, median and\nstandard deviation of this distribution are also calculated, in terms of the\nnetwork size and its mean degree. The termination of an RW path may take place\neither by backtracking to the previous node or by retracing of its path, namely\nstepping into a node which has been visited two or more time steps earlier. We\nobtain analytical results for the probabilities, $p_b$ and $p_r$, that the\ncause of termination will be backtracking or retracing, respectively. It is\nshown that in dilute networks the dominant termination scenario is backtracking\nwhile in dense networks most paths terminate by retracing. We also obtain\nexpressions for the conditional distributions $P(d=\\ell | b)$ and $P(d=\\ell |\nr)$, for those paths which are terminated by backtracking or by retracing,\nrespectively. These results provide useful insight into the general problem of\nsurvival analysis and the statistics of mortality rates when two or more\ntermination scenarios coexist.\n", "  We present the kinematic analysis of a sub-sample of 82 galaxies at\n$\\mathrm{0.75<z<1.2}$ from our new survey HR-COSMOS aimed to obtain the first\nstatistical study on the kinematics of star-forming galaxies in the treasury\nCOSMOS field at $\\mathrm{0<z<1.2}$. We observed $\\sim\\,$766 emission line\ngalaxies using the multi-slit spectrograph ESO-VLT/VIMOS in high-resolution\nmode (R=2500). To better extract galaxy kinematics, VIMOS spectral slits have\nbeen carefully tilted along the major axis orientation of the galaxies, making\nuse of the position angle measurements from the high spatial resolution ACS/HST\nCOSMOS images. We constrained the kinematics of the sub-sample at $0.75<z<1.2$\nby creating high resolution semi-analytical models. We established the\nstellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation at $z\\simeq 0.9$ with high-quality stellar\nmass measurements derived using the latest COSMOS photometric catalog, which\nincludes the latest data releases of UltraVISTA and Spitzer. In doubling the\nsample at these redshifts compared with the literature, we estimated the\nrelation without setting its slope, and found it consistent with previous\nstudies in other deep extragalactic fields assuming no significant evolution of\nthe relation with redshift at $z\\lesssim1$. We computed dynamical masses within\nthe radius R$_{2.2}$ and found a median stellar-to-dynamical mass fraction\nequal to 0.2 (assuming Chabrier IMF), which implies a contribution of gas and\ndark matter masses of 80% of the total mass within R$_{2.2}$, in agreement with\nrecent integral field spectroscopy surveys. We find no dependence of the\nstellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation with environment probing up to group scale\nmasses. This study shows that multi-slit galaxy surveys remain a powerful tool\nto derive kinematics for large numbers of galaxies at both high and low\nredshift.\n", "  Any imaging device such as a microscope or telescope has a resolution limit,\na minimum separation it can resolve between two objects or sources; this limit\nis typically defined by \"Rayleigh's criterion\", although in recent years there\nhave been a number of high-profile techniques demonstrating that Rayleigh's\nlimit can be surpassed under particular sets of conditions. Quantum information\nand quantum metrology have given us new ways to approach measurement ; a new\nproposal inspired by these ideas has now re-examined the problem of trying to\nestimate the separation between two poorly resolved point sources. The \"Fisher\ninformation\" provides the inverse of the Cramer-Rao bound, the lowest variance\nachievable for an unbiased estimator. For a given imaging system and a fixed\nnumber of collected photons, Tsang, Nair and Lu observed that the Fisher\ninformation carried by the intensity of the light in the image-plane (the only\ninformation available to traditional techniques, including previous\nsuper-resolution approaches) falls to zero as the separation between the\nsources decreases; this is known as \"Rayleigh's Curse.\" On the other hand, when\nthey calculated the quantum Fisher information of the full electromagnetic\nfield (including amplitude and phase information), they found it remains\nconstant. In other words, there is infinitely more information available about\nthe separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity\nalone. Here we implement a proof-of-principle system which makes use of the\nphase information, and demonstrate a greatly improved ability to estimate the\ndistance between a pair of closely-separated sources, and immunity to\nRayleigh's curse.\n", "  Observations of the Pluto-Charon system, acquired with the ALMA\ninterferometer on June 12-13, 2015, have yielded a detection of the CO(3-2) and\nHCN(4-3) rotational transitions from Pluto, providing a strong confirmation of\nthe presence of CO, and the first observation of HCN, in Pluto's atmosphere.\nThe CO and HCN lines probe Pluto's atmosphere up to ~450 km and ~900 km\naltitude, respectively. The CO detection yields (i) a much improved\ndetermination of the CO mole fraction, as 515+/-40 ppm for a 12 ubar surface\npressure (ii) clear evidence for a well-marked temperature decrease (i.e.,\nmesosphere) above the 30-50 km stratopause and a best-determined temperature of\n70+/-2 K at 300 km, in agreement with recent inferences from New Horizons /\nAlice solar occultation data. The HCN line shape implies a high abundance of\nthis species in the upper atmosphere, with a mole fraction >1.5x10-5 above 450\nkm and a value of 4x10-5 near 800 km. The large HCN abundance and the cold\nupper atmosphere imply supersaturation of HCN to a degree (7-8 orders of\nmagnitude) hitherto unseen in planetary atmospheres, probably due to the slow\nkinetics of condensation at the low pressure and temperature conditions of\nPluto's upper atmosphere. HCN is also present in the bottom ~100 km of the\natmosphere, with a 10-8 - 10-7 mole fraction; this implies either HCN\nsaturation or undersaturation there, depending on the precise stratopause\ntemperature. The HCN column is (1.6+/-0.4)x10^14 cm-2, suggesting a\nsurface-referred net production rate of ~2x10^7 cm-2s-1. Although HCN\nrotational line cooling affects Pluto's atmosphere heat budget, the amounts\ndetermined in this study are insufficient to explain the well-marked mesosphere\nand upper atmosphere's ~70 K temperature. We finally report an upper limit on\nthe HC3N column density (< 2x10^13 cm-2) and on the HC15N / HC14N ratio (<\n1/125).\n", "  Leptonic unitarity triangle (LUT) provides fundamental means to geometrically\ndescribe CP violation in neutrino oscillation. In this work, we use LUT to\npresent a new geometrical interpretation of the vacuum oscillation probability,\nand derive a compact new oscillation formula in terms of only 3 independent\nparameters of the corresponding LUT. Then, we systematically study matter\neffects in the geometrical formulation of neutrino oscillation with CP\nviolation. Including nontrivial matter effects, we derive a very compact new\noscillation formula by using the LUT formulation. We further demonstrate that\nthis geometrical formula holds well for applications to neutrino oscillations\nin matter, including the long baseline experiments T2K, MINOS, NOvA, and DUNE.\n", "  In view of the projected high number of produced $B$ mesons in Belle II\nexperiment ($\\sim 10^{10}$ per year), in addition to the presently ongoing\nLHC-b, we calculate the rate of decay for the rare decays of $B$ mesons via a\nsterile on-shell neutrino $N$, which subsequently may decay leptonically or\nsemileptonically within the detector: $B \\to (D^{(*)}) \\ell_1^{\\pm} N$, then $N\n\\to \\ell_1^{\\pm} \\ell_2^{\\mp} \\nu$ or $N \\to \\ell^{\\pm} \\pi^\\mp$. Here, $\\ell_1\n\\not= \\ell_2$ in order to avoid serious QED background. We account for the\npossible effects of the strong neutrino lifetime on the observability of the\nrare decays. If no charmed mesons ($D^{(*)}$) are produced at the first vertex\nof the sterile neutrino, a strong CKM-suppression becomes effective; this is\nnot true if we consider instead the decays of $B_c$ mesons which can be\nproduced copiously in LHC-b. The production of charmed mesons $D^{(*)}$ at the\nfirst vertex offers an attractive possibility because it avoids strong\nCKM-suppression. Such rare decays of $B$ mesons could be detected at Belle II\nexperiment, with $N$ neutrino either decaying within the detector or\nmanifesting itself as a massive missing momentum.\n", "  Random walks on bipartite networks have been used extensively to design\npersonalized recommendation methods. While aging has been identified as a key\ncomponent in the growth of information networks, most research has focused on\nthe networks' structural properties and neglected the often available time\ninformation. Time has been largely ignored both by the investigated\nrecommendation methods as well as by the methodology used to evaluate them. We\nshow that this time-unaware approach overestimates the methods' recommendation\nperformance. Motivated by microscopic rules of network growth, we propose a\ntime-aware modification of an existing recommendation method and show that by\ncombining the temporal and structural aspects, it outperforms the existing\nmethods. The performance improvements are particularly striking in systems with\nfast aging.\n", "  We report the Fermi Large Area Telescope detection of extended gamma-ray\nemission from the lobes of the radio galaxy Fornax A using 6.1 years of Pass 8\ndata. After Centaurus A, this is now the second example of an extended\ngamma-ray source attributed to a radio galaxy. Both an extended flat disk\nmorphology and a morphology following the extended radio lobes were preferred\nover a point-source description, and the core contribution was constrained to\nbe < 14% of the total gamma-ray flux. A preferred alignment of the gamma-ray\nelongation with the radio lobes was demonstrated by rotating the radio lobes\ntemplate. We found no significant evidence for variability on ~0.5 year\ntimescales. Taken together, these results strongly suggest a lobe origin for\nthe gamma rays. With the extended nature of the > 100 MeV gamma-ray emission\nestablished, we model the source broadband emission considering currently\navailable total lobe radio and millimeter flux measurements, as well as X-ray\ndetections attributed to inverse Compton (IC) emission off the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). Unlike the Centaurus A case, we find that a leptonic model\ninvolving IC scattering of CMB and extragalactic background light (EBL) photons\nunderpredicts the gamma-ray fluxes by factors of about ~ 2 - 3, depending on\nthe EBL model adopted. An additional gamma-ray spectral component is thus\nrequired, and could be due to hadronic emission arising from proton-proton\ncollisions of cosmic rays with thermal plasma within the radio lobes.\n", "  We consider the quantum harmonic oscillator in contact with a finite\ntemperature bath, modelled by the Caldeira-Leggett master equation. Applying\nperiodic kicks to the oscillator, we study the system in different dynamical\nregimes between classical integrability and chaos on the one hand, and\nballistic or diffusive energy absorption on the other. We then investigate the\ninfluence of the heat bath on the oscillator in each case. Phase space\ntechniques allow us to simulate the evolution of the system efficiently. In\nthis way, we calculate high resolution Wigner functions at long times, where\nthe system approaches a quasi-stationary cyclic evolution. Thereby, we are able\nto perform an accurate study of the thermodynamic properties of a\nnon-integrable, quantum chaotic system in contact with a heat bath.\n", "  Using photoluminescence microscopy enhanced by MRI, we visualize in real\nspace both electron and nuclear polarization occurring in non-equilibrium FQH\nliquids. We observe stripe-like regions comprising FQH excited states which\ndiscretely form when the FQH liquid is excited by a source-drain current. These\nregions are topologically protected and deformable, and give rise to\nbidirectionally polarized nuclear spins as spin-resolved electrons flow across\ntheir boundaries.\n", "  We explore the effects of Photon Induced (PI) production of a dilepton final\nstate in the Large Hadron Collider environment. Using QED Parton Distribution\nFunction (PDF) sets we can treat the photons as real partons inside the protons\nand compare their yield directly to that of the Drell-Yan (DY) process. In\nparticular, we concentrate on an error analysis of the two mechanisms. In order\nto do so, we use the NNPDF set, which comes with a set of replicas to estimate\nthe systematic PDF error. On the one hand, we find that the PI contribution\nbecomes dominant over DY above a dilepton invariant mass of 3 TeV. On the other\nhand, the PI predictions are affected by a large error coming from the QED\nPDFs, well above the one affecting the DY mode. We assess the impact of these\nuncertainties in the context of resonant and non-resonant searches for a\nneutral massive vector boson (Z') through the differential cross section and\nForward-Backward Asymmetry (AFB) observables as a function of the dilepton\ninvariant mass. While the former is subject to the aforementioned significant\nresidual errors the latter shows the systematic error cancellation expected\n(recall that AFB is a ratio of cross sections) even in presence of PI\ncontributions, so that the recently emphasized key role played by AFB as a\nvalid tool for both Z' discovery and interpretation in both resonant and\nnon-resonant mode is further consolidated.\n", "  We investigate whether transition radiation from a particle shower crossing\nthe interface between Earth and air and induced by an Earth-skimming neutrino\ncan explain the upward event announced recently by the ANITA Collaboration.\nWhile the properties of the observed signal can in principle be explained with\ntransition radiation, the flux necessary for a successful explanation is in\ntension with the current best limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, the\nIceCube neutrino detector and the ANITA balloon. We also show that in this\nscenario, the direction of the incoming neutrino is determined precisely to\nwithin a few degrees, from the polarization properties of the observed events\nand thanks to the Earth opacity to ultra high energy neutrinos.\n", "  We present a first-principles framework to investigate the electron\nscattering channels and transport properties for polar material by combining\nthe exact solution of linearized electron-phonon (e-ph) Boltzmann transport\nequation in its integral-differential form associated with the e-ph coupling\nmatrices obtained from polar Wannier interpolation scheme. No ad hoc parameter\nis required throughout this calculation, and GaAs, a well-studied polar\nmaterial, is used as an example to demonstrate this method. In this work, the\nlong-range and short-range contributions as well as the intravalley and\nintervalley transitions in the e-ph interactions (EPIs) have been\nquantitatively addressed. Promoted by such mode-by-mode analysis, we find that\nin GaAs, the piezoelectric scattering is comparable to deformation-potential\nscattering for electron scatterings by acoustic phonons in EPI even at room\ntemperature and makes a significant contribution to mobility. Furthermore, we\nachieved good agreements with experimental data for the mobility, and\nidentified that electrons with mean free paths between 130 and 210 nm\ncontribute dominantly to the electron transport at 300 K. Such information\nprovides deeper understandings on the electron transport in GaAs, and the\npresented framework can be readily applied to other polar materials.\n", "  We provide an analytic solution to the problem of system-bath dynamics under\nthe effect of high-frequency driving that has applications in a large class of\nsettings, such as driven-dissipative many-body systems. Our method relies on\ndiscrete symmetries of the system-bath Hamiltonian and provides the time\nevolution operator of the full system, including bath degrees of freedom,\nwithout weak-coupling or Markovian assumptions. An interpretation of the\nsolution in terms of the strobo- scopic evolution of a family of observables\nunder the influence of an effective static Hamiltonian is proposed, which\nconstitutes a flexible simulation procedure of non-trivial Hamiltonians. We\ninstan- tiate the result with the study of the spin-boson model with\ntime-dependent tunneling amplitude. We analyze the class of Hamiltonians that\nmay be stroboscopically accessed for this example and illustrate the dynamics\nof system and bath degrees of freedom.\n", "  In most of Seyfert-1 active galactic nucei (AGN) the optical linear continuum\npolarization degree is usually small (less than 1%) and the polarization\nposition angle is nearly parallel to the AGN radio-axis. However, there are\nmany types-1 AGNs with unexplained intermediate values for both positional\nangles and polarization degrees. Our explanation of polarization degree and\npositional angle of Seyfert-1 AGNs focuses on the reflection of non-polarized\nradiation from sub-parsec jets in optically thick accretion discs. The presence\nof a magnetic field surrounding the scattering media will induce Faraday\nrotation of the polarization plane that may explain the intermediate values of\npositional angles if there is a magnetic field component normal to the\naccretion disc. The Faraday rotation depolarization effect in disc diminishes\nthe competition between polarization of the reflected radiation with the\nparallel component of polarization and the perpendicular polarization from\ninternal radiation of disc (the Milne problem) in favor of polarization of\nreflected radiation. This effect allows us to explain the observed polarization\nof Seyfert-1 AGN radiation even though the jet optical luminosity is much lower\nthan the luminosity of disc. We present the calculation of polarization degrees\nfor a number of Seyfert-1 AGNs.\n", "  We calculate the minimal amount of large-scale poloidal magnetic field that\nhas to thread the inner, radiation-over-gas pressure dominated region of a thin\ndisk for its thermal stability. Such a net field amplifies the magnetization of\nthe saturated turbulent state and makes it locally stable. For a $10 M_\\odot$\nblack hole the minimal magnetic flux is $10^{24}(\\dot M/\\dot M_{\\rm\nEdd})^{20/21}\\,\\rm G\\cdot cm^{2}$. This amount is compared with the amount of\nuniform magnetic flux that can be provided by the companion star -- estimated\nto be in the range $10^{22}-10^{24}\\,\\rm G\\cdot cm^2$. If accretion rate is\nlarge enough, the companion is not able to provide the required amount and such\na system, if still sub-Eddington, must be thermally unstable. The peculiar\nvariability of GRS 1915+105, an X-ray binary with the exceptionally high BH\nmass and near-Eddington luminosity, may result from the shortage of large scale\npoloidal field of uniform polarity.\n", "  The recent measurements of high energy photodisintegration of the $^3He$\nnucleus to the $pd$ pair at $90^0$ center of mass demonstrated an energy\nscaling consistent with the quark counting rule with unprecedentedly large\nexponent of $s^{-17}$. To understand the underlying mechanism of this process\nwe extended the theoretical formalism of hard rescattering mechanism to\ncalculate the $\\gamma ^3He\\rightarrow pd$ reaction. In HRM the incoming high\nenergy photon strikes a quark from one of the nucleons in the target which\nsubsequently undergoes hard rescattering with the quarks from the other\nnucleons generating hard two-body system in the final state of the reaction.\nWithin the HRM we derived the parameter free expression for the differential\ncross section of the reaction, which is expressed through the $^3He\\rightarrow\npd$ transition spectral function, cross section of hard $pd\\rightarrow pd$\nscattering and the effective charge of the quarks being interchanged during the\nhard rescattering process. The numerical estimates of all these factors\nresulted in the magnitude of the cross section which is surprisingly in a good\nagreement with the data.\n", "  We present an open-source and validated chemical kinetics code for studying\nhot exoplanetary atmospheres, which we name VULCAN. It is constructed for\ngaseous chemistry from 500 to 2500 K using a reduced C-H-O chemical network\nwith about 300 reactions. It uses eddy diffusion to mimic atmospheric dynamics\nand excludes photochemistry. We have provided a full description of the rate\ncoefficients and thermodynamic data used. We validate VULCAN by reproducing\nchemical equilibrium and by comparing its output versus the\ndisequilibrium-chemistry calculations of Moses et al. and Rimmer & Helling. It\nreproduces the models of HD 189733b and HD 209458b by Moses et al., which\nemploy a network with nearly 1600 reactions. We also use VULCAN to examine the\ntheoretical trends produced when the temperature-pressure profile and\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio are varied. Assisted by a sensitivity test designed to\nidentify the key reactions responsible for producing a specific molecule, we\nrevisit the quenching approximation and find that it is accurate for methane\nbut breaks down for acetylene, because the disequilibrium abundance of\nacetylene is not directly determined by transport-induced quenching, but is\nrather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane.\nTherefore, we suggest that the quenching approximation should be used with\ncaution and must always be checked against a chemical kinetics calculation. A\none-dimensional model atmosphere with 100 layers, computed using VULCAN,\ntypically takes several minutes to complete. VULCAN is part of the Exoclimes\nSimulation Platform (ESP; http://www.exoclime.net/) and publicly available at\nhttp://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN .\n", "  We reveal a hierarchical, multilayer organization of finite components --\ni.e., tendrils and tubes -- around the giant connected components in directed\nnetworks and propose efficient algorithms allowing one to uncover the entire\norganization of key real-world directed networks, such as the World Wide Web,\nthe neural network of \\emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}, and others. With\nincreasing damage, the giant components decrease in size while the number and\nsize of tendril layers increase, enhancing the susceptibility of the networks\nto damage.\n", "  We present an analysis of the mid-infrared WISE sources seen within the\nequatorial GAMA G12 field, located in the North Galactic Cap. Our motivation is\nto study and characterize the behavior of WISE source populations in\nanticipation of the deep multi-wavelength surveys that will define the next\ndecade, with the principal science goal of mapping the 3D large scale\nstructures and determining the global physical attributes of the host galaxies.\nIn combination with cosmological redshifts, we identify galaxies from their\nWISE W1 3.4um resolved emission, and by performing a star-galaxy separation\nusing apparent magnitude, colors and statistical modeling of star-counts. The\nresultant galaxy catalog has ~590,000 sources in 60 deg^2, reaching a W1\n5-sigma depth of 31 uJy. At the faint end, where redshifts are not available,\nwe employ a luminosity function analysis to show that approximately 27% of all\nWISE extragalactic sources to a limit of 17.5 mag (31 uJy) are at high\nredshift, z > 1. The spatial distribution is investigated using two-point\ncorrelation functions and a 3D source density characterization at 5 Mpc and 20\nMpc scales. For angular distributions, we find brighter and more massive\nsources are strongly clustered relative to fainter and lower mass source;\nlikewise, based on WISE colors, spheroidal galaxies have the strongest\nclustering, while late-type disk galaxies have the lowest clustering\namplitudes. Along the radial direction, the strongest clustering is in the\nlargest redshift shell, while the weakest is in the nearest redshift shell,\nconsistent with the stellar mass and morphological type dependency results. In\nthree dimensions, we find a number of distinct groupings, often bridged by\nfilaments and super-structures. Using special visualization tools, we map these\nstructures, exploring how clustering may play a role with stellar mass and\ngalaxy type.\n", "  In this work we have estimated 10 collisional ages of 9 families for which\nfor different reasons our previous attempts failed. In general, these are\ndifficult cases that required dedicated effort, such as a new family\nclassifications for asteroids in mean motion resonances, as well as a revision\nof the classification inside the $3/2$ resonance. Of the families locked in\nmean motion resonances, we succeeded in determining ages of the families of\n(1911) Schubart and of the \"super-Hilda\" family, assuming this is actually a\nseverely eroded original family of (153) Hilda. In the Trojan region we found\nfamilies with almost no Yarkovsky evolution, for which we could compute only\nphysically implausible ages. Hence, we interpreted their modest dispersions of\nproper eccentricities and inclinations as implying that the Trojan asteroid\nfamilies are fossil families, frozen at their proper elements determined by the\noriginal ejection velocity field. We have found a new family, among the Griquas\nlocked in the 2/1 resonance with Jupiter: (11097) 1994 UD1. We have estimated\nthe ages of 6 families affected by secular resonances: families of (5) Astraea,\n(25) Phocaea, (283) Emma, (363) Padua, (686) Gersuind, and (945) Barcelona. By\nusing a numerical calibration method, we have shown that the secular resonances\ndo not affect significanly the secular change of proper a. For the family of\n(145) Adeona we could estimate the age only after removal of a number of\nassumed interlopers. With the present paper we have concluded the series\ndedicated to the determination of asteroid ages with a uniform method. We\ncomputed the ages for a total of 57 families with $>100$ members. There remain\nfamilies too small at present to provide reliable estimates, as well as some\ncomplex families (221, 135, 298) which may have more ages than we could\ncurrently estimate.\n", "  We study the bulk-edge correspondence in topological insulators by taking\nFu-Kane spin pumping model as an example. We show that the Kane-Mele invariant\nin this model is Z2 invariant modulo the spectral flow of a single-parameter\nfamily of 1+1-dimensional Dirac operators with a global boundary condition\ninduced by the Kramers degeneracy of the system. This spectral flow is defined\nas an integer which counts the difference between the number of eigenvalues of\nthe Dirac operator family that flow from negative to non-negative and the\nnumber of eigenvalues that flow from non-negative to negative. Since the bulk\nstates of the insulator are completely gapped and the ground state is assumed\nbeing no more degenerate except the Kramers, they do not contribute to the\nspectral flow and only edge states contribute to. The parity of the number of\nthe Kramers pairs of gapless edge states is exactly the same as that of the\nspectral flow. This reveals the origin of the edge-bulk correspondence, i.e.,\nwhy the edge states can be used to characterize the topological insulators.\nFurthermore, the spectral flow is related to the reduced eta-invariant and thus\ncounts both the discrete ground state degeneracy and the continuous gapless\nexcitations, which distinguishes the topological insulator from the\nconventional band insulator even if the edge states open a gap due to a strong\ninteraction between edge modes. We emphasize that these results are also valid\neven for a weak disordered and/or weak interacting system. The higher spectral\nflow to categorize the higher-dimensional topological insulators are expected.\n", "  Quark-gluon plasma produced at the early stage of ultrarelativistic heavy ion\ncollisions is unstable, if weakly coupled, due to the anisotropy of its\nmomentum distribution. Chromomagnetic fields are spontaneously generated and\ncan reach magnitudes much exceeding typical values of the fields in\nequilibrated plasma. We consider a high energy test parton traversing an\nunstable plasma that is populated with strong fields. We study the momentum\nbroadening parameter $\\hat q$ which determines the radiative energy loss of the\ntest parton. We develop a formalism which gives $\\hat q$ as the solution of an\ninitial value problem, and we focus on extremely oblate plasmas which are\nphysically relevant for relativistic heavy ion collisions. The parameter $\\hat\nq$ is found to be strongly dependent on time. For short times it is of the\norder of the equilibrium value, but at later times $\\hat q$ grows exponentially\ndue to the interaction of the test parton with unstable modes and becomes much\nbigger than the value in equilibrium. The momentum broadening is also strongly\ndirectionally dependent and is largest when the test parton velocity is\ntransverse to the beam axis. Consequences of our findings for the phenomenology\nof jet quenching in relativistic heavy ion collisions are briefly discussed.\n", "  A Monte-Carlo approach to proton stopping in warm dense matter is implemented\ninto an existing particle-in-cell code. The model is based on multiple\nbinary-collisions among electron-electron, electron-ion and ion-ion, taking\ninto account contributions from both free and bound electrons, and allows to\ncalculate particle stopping in much more natural manner. At low temperature\nlimit, when ``all'' electron are bounded at the nucleus, the stopping power\nconverges to the predictions of Bethe-Bloch theory, which shows good\nconsistency with data provided by the NIST. With the rising of temperatures,\nmore and more bound electron are ionized, thus giving rise to an increased\nstopping power to cold matter, which is consistent with the report of a\nrecently experimental measurement [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 215002 (2015)]. When\ntemperature is further increased, with ionizations reaching the maximum,\nlowered stopping power is observed, which is due to the suppression of\ncollision frequency between projected proton beam and hot plasmas in the\ntarget.\n", "  We demonstrate that the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the Rabi model and\ncritical dynamics near the QPT can be probed in the setup of a single trapped\nion. We first show that there exists equilibrium and non-equilibrium universal\nfunctions of the Rabi model by finding a proper rescaling of the system\nparameters and observables. We then propose a scheme that can faithfully\nrealize the Rabi model in the limit of a large ratio of the effective atomic\ntransition frequency to the oscillator frequency using a single trapped-ion and\ntherefore the QPT. It is demonstrated that the predicted universal functions\ncan indeed be observed based on our scheme. Finally, the effects of realistic\nnoise sources on probing the universal functions in experiments are examined.\n", "  In an isotropic strongly interacting quantum liquid without quasiparticles,\ngeneral scaling arguments imply that the dimensionless ratio $(k_B /\\hbar)\\,\n\\eta/s$, where $\\eta$ is the shear viscosity and $s$ is the entropy density, is\na universal number. We compute the shear viscosity of the Ising-nematic\ncritical point of metals in spatial dimension $d=2$ by an expansion below\n$d=5/2$. The anisotropy associated with directions parallel and normal to the\nFermi surface leads to a violation of the scaling expectations: $\\eta$ scales\nin the same manner as a chiral conductivity, and the ratio $\\eta/s$ diverges at\nlow temperature ($T$) as $T^{-2/z}$, where $z$ is the dynamic critical exponent\nfor fermionic excitations dispersing normal to the Fermi surface.\n", "  Shadowgraphy is a technique widely used to diagnose objects or systems in\nvarious fields in physics and engineering. In shadowgraphy, an optical beam is\ndeflected by the object and then the intensity modulation is captured on a\nscreen placed some distance away. However, retrieving quantitative information\nfrom the shadowgrams themselves is a challenging task because of the non-linear\nnature of the process. Here, a novel method to retrieve quantitative\ninformation from shadowgrams, based on computational geometry, is presented for\nthe first time. This process can be applied to proton radiography for electric\nand magnetic field diagnosis in high-energy-density plasmas and has been\nbenchmarked using a toroidal magnetic field as the object, among others. It is\nshown that the method can accurately retrieve quantitative parameters with\nerror bars less than 10%, even when caustics are present. The method is also\nshown to be robust enough to process real experimental results with simple pre-\nand post-processing techniques. This adds a powerful new tool for research in\nvarious fields in engineering and physics for both techniques.\n", "  The early stages of heavy ion collisions are dominated by high density\nsystems of gluons that carry each a small fraction $x$ of the momenta of the\ncolliding nucleons. A distinguishing feature of such systems is the phenomenon\nof \"saturation\" which tames the expected growth of the gluon density as the\nenergy of the collision increases. The onset of saturation occurs at a\nparticular transverse momentum scale, the \"saturation momentum\", that emerges\ndynamically and that marks the onset of non-linear gluon interactions. At high\nenergy, and for large nuclei, the saturation momentum is large compared to the\ntypical hadronic scale, making high density gluons amenable to a description\nwith weak coupling techniques. This paper reviews some of the challenges faced\nin the study of such dense systems of small $x$ gluons, and of the progress\nmade in addressing them. The focus is on conceptual issues, and the\npresentation is both pedagogical, and critical. Examples where high gluon\ndensity could play a visible role in heavy ion collisions are briefly discussed\nat the end, for illustration purpose.\n", "  We propose a simple experimental scheme to realize simultaneously the\none-dimensional spin-orbit coupling and the staggered spin-flip in ultracold\npseudospin-$1/2$ atomic Fermi gases trapped in square optical lattices. In the\nabsence of interspecies interactions, the system supports gapped Chern\ninsulators and gapless topological semimetal states. By turning on the $s$-wave\ninteractions, a rich variety of gapped and gapless inhomogeneous topological\nsuperfluids can emerge. In particular, a gapped topological Fulde-Ferrell\nsuperfluid, in which the chiral edge states at opposite boundaries possess the\nsame chirality, is predicted.\n", "  BaSn$_2$ has been shown to form as layers of buckled stanene intercalated by\nbarium ions~\\cite{Kim_2008}. However, despite an apparently straightforward\nsynthesis and significant interest in stanene as a topological material,\nBaSn$_2$ has been left largely unexplored, and has only recently been\nrecognized as a potential topological insulator. Belonging to neither the lead\nnor bismuth chalcogenide families, it would represent a unique manifestation of\nthe topological insulating phase. Here we present a detailed investigation of\nBaSn$_2$, using both {\\it ab initio} and experimental methods. First-principles\ncalculations demonstrate that this overlooked material is a indeed strong\ntopological insulator with a bulk band gap of 360meV, among the largest\nobserved for topological insulators. We characterize the surface state\ndependence on termination chemistry, providing guidance for experimental\nefforts to measure and manipulate its topological properties. Additionally,\nthrough {\\it ab initio} modeling and synthesis experiments we explore the\nstability and accessibility of this phase, revealing a complicated phase\ndiagram that indicates a challenging path to obtaining single crystals.\n", "  The shapes of relativistic iron lines observed in spectra of candidate black\nholes carry the signatures of the strong gravitational fields in which the\naccretion disks lie. These lines result from the sum of the contributions of\nall images of the disk created by gravitational lensing, with the direct and\nfirst-order images largely dominating the overall shapes. Higher order images\ncreated by photons tightly winding around the black holes are often neglected\nin the modeling of these lines, since they require a substantially higher\ncomputational effort. With the help of the strong deflection limit, we present\nthe most accurate semi-analytical calculation of these higher order\ncontributions to the iron lines for Schwarzschild black holes. We show that two\nregimes exist depending on the inclination of the disk with respect to the line\nof sight. Many useful analytical formulae can be also derived in this\nframework.\n", "  We revisit the possibility of generating non-zero reactor mixing angle in a\nscenario where there is a sterile neutrino at the eV scale apart from the usual\nthree sub-eV scale active neutrinos. We show that the $3\\times3$ active\nneutrino mass matrix can possess a $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry and can still be\nconsistent with non-zero value of the reactor mixing angle $\\theta_{13}$, if\nthis $\\mu-\\tau$ symmetry is broken in the sterile neutrino sector. We first\npropose a simple model based on the discrete flavour symmetry $A_4 \\times Z_3\n\\times Z^{\\prime}_3$ to realise such a scenario and then numerically evaluate\nthe complete $3+1$ neutrino parameter space that allows such a possibility. We\nshow that, such a possibility of generating non-zero $\\theta_{13}$ can in\ngeneral, remain valid even if the present $3+1$ neutrino global fit data get\nruled out by future experiments. We also discuss the possible implications at\nneutrinoless double beta decay $(0\\nu \\beta \\beta)$ experiments in view of the\nlatest results from KamLAND-Zen experiment.\n", "  We report on the elastocapillary deformation of flexible microfibers in\ncontact with liquid droplets. A fiber is observed to bend more as the size of\nthe contacting droplet is increased. At a critical droplet size, proportional\nto the bending elastocapillary length, the fiber is seen to spontaneously wind\naround the droplet. To rationalize these observations, we invoke a minimal\nmodel based on elastic beam theory, and find agreement with experimental data.\nFurther energetic considerations provide a consistent prediction for the\nwinding criterion.\n", "  Heavy fermion systems, and other strongly correlated electron materials,\noften exhibit a competition between antiferromagnetic (AF) and singlet ground\nstates. Using exact Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we examine the\neffect of impurities in the vicinity of such AF- singlet quantum critical\npoints, through an appropriately defined impurity susceptibility, $\\chi_{imp}$.\nOur key finding is a connection, within a single calculational framework,\nbetween AF domains induced on the singlet side of the transition, and the\nbehavior of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate $1/T_1$. We\nshow that local NMR measurements provide a diagnostic for the location of the\nQCP which agrees remarkably well with the vanishing of the AF order parameter\nand large values of $\\chi_{imp}$. We connect our results with experiments on\nCd-doped CeCoIn$_5$.\n", "  We demonstrate a generally applicable technique for mixing two-species\nquantum degenerate bosonic samples in the presence of an optical lattice, and\nwe employ it to produce low-entropy samples of ultracold 87Rb133Cs Feshbach\nmolecules with a lattice filling fraction exceeding 30%. Starting from two\nspatially separated Bose-Einstein condensates of Rb and Cs atoms, Rb-Cs atom\npairs are efficiently produced by using the superfluid-to-Mott insulator\nquantum phase transition twice, first for the Cs sample, then for the Rb\nsample, after nulling the Rb-Cs interaction at a Feshbach resonance's zero\ncrossing. We form molecules out of atom pairs and characterize the mixing\nprocess in terms of sample overlap and mixing speed. The dense and ultracold\nsample of more than 5000 RbCs molecules is an ideal starting point for\nexperiments in the context of quantum many-body physics with long-range dipolar\ninteractions.\n", "  A variational scheme for the derivation of generalized, symmetry-induced\ncontinuity equations for Hermitian and non-Hermitian quantum mechanical systems\nis developed. We introduce a Lagrangian which involves two complex wave fields\nand whose global invariance under dilation and phase variations leads to a\nmixed continuity equation for the two fields. In combination with discrete\nspatial symmetries of the underlying Hamiltonian, the mixed continuity equation\nis shown to produce bilocal conservation laws for a single field. This leads to\ngeneralized conserved charges for vanishing boundary currents, and to\ndivergenceless bilocal currents for stationary states. The formalism reproduces\nthe bilocal continuity equation obtained in the special case of $\\mathcal{PT}$\nsymmetric quantum mechanics and paraxial optics.\n", "  The sensitivity properties of an SU(1,1) interferometer made of two cascaded\nparametric amplifiers, as well as of an ordinary SU(2) interferometer preceded\nby a squeezer and followed by an anti-squeezer, are theoretically investigated.\nSeveral possible experimental configurations are considered, such as the\nabsence or presence of a seed beam, direct or homodyne detection scheme. In all\ncases we formulate the optimal conditions to achieve phase super-sensitivity,\nmeaning a sensitivity overcoming the shot-noise limit. We show that for a given\ngain of the first parametric amplifier, unbalancing the interferometer by\nincreasing the gain of the second amplifier improves the interferometer\nproperties. In particular, a broader super-sensitivity phase range and a better\noverall sensitivity can be achieved by gain unbalancing.\n", "  We report three newly discovered exoplanets from the SuperWASP survey.\nWASP-127b is a heavily inflated super-Neptune of mass 0.18 +/- 0.02 M_J and\nradius 1.37 +/- 0.04 R_J. This is one of the least massive planets discovered\nby the WASP project. It orbits a bright host star (Vmag = 10.16) of spectral\ntype G5 with a period of 4.17 days. WASP-127b is a low-density planet that has\nan extended atmosphere with a scale height of 2500 +/- 400 km, making it an\nideal candidate for transmission spectroscopy. WASP-136b and WASP-138b are both\nhot Jupiters with mass and radii of 1.51 +/- 0.08 M_J and 1.38 +/- 0.16 R_J,\nand 1.22 +/- 0.08 M_J and 1.09 +/- 0.05 R_J, respectively. WASP-136b is in a\n5.22-day orbit around an F9 subgiant star with a mass of 1.41 +/- 0.07 M_sun\nand a radius of 2.21 +/- 0.22 R_sun. The discovery of WASP-136b could help\nconstrain the characteristics of the giant planet population around evolved\nstars. WASP-138b orbits an F7 star with a period of 3.63 days. Its radius\nagrees with theoretical values from standard models, suggesting the presence of\na heavy element core with a mass of ~10 M_earth. The discovery of these new\nplanets helps in exploring the diverse compositional range of short-period\nplanets, and will aid our understanding of the physical characteristics of both\ngas giants and low-density planets.\n", "  We study the thermodynamical properties of a one-dimensional gas with\none-dimensional gravitational interactions, and placed in a uniform mass\nbackground. Periodic boundary conditions are implemented as a modification of\nthe potential consisting of a sum over mirror images (Ewald sum), regularized\nwith an exponential cut-off. The system has a phase transition at a critical\ntemperature. Above the critical temperature the gas density is uniform, while\nbelow the critical point the system becomes inhomogeneous. Numerical\nsimulations of the model confirms the existence of the phase transition, and\nare in good agreement with the theoretical results.\n", "  We propose an alternative structure of TiO2 anatase that has a higher energy\noxygen p-like valence band maximum than the pristine TiO2 anatase and thus has\na much better alignment with the water splitting levels. This alternative\nstructure is unique when considering a large subspace of possible structural\ndistortions of TiO2 anatase. We propose two routes towards this state and argue\nthat one of them might have been realized in the recently discovered so-called\nblack TiO2.\n", "  A spin-polarizing electron beam splitter is described which relies on an\narrangement of linearly polarized laser waves of nonrelativistic intensity. An\nincident electron beam is first coherently scattered off a bichromatic laser\nfield, splitting the beam into two portions, with electron spin and momentum\nbeing entangled. Afterwards, the partial beams are coherently superposed in an\ninterferometric setup formed by standing laser waves. As a result, the outgoing\nelectron beam is separated into its spin components along the laser magnetic\nfield, which is shown by both analytical and numerical solutions of Pauli's\nequation. The proposed laser field configuration thus exerts the same effect on\nfree electrons like an ordinary Stern-Gerlach magnet does on atoms.\n", "  Based on more than seven years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) Pass 8\ndata, we report on a detailed analysis of the bright gamma-ray pulsar (PSR)\nJ0007+7303. We confirm that PSR J0007+7303 is significantly detected as a point\nsource also during the off-peak phases with a TS value of 262 ($\\sim$ 16\n$\\sigma$). In the description of PSR J0007+7303 off-peak spectrum, a power law\nwith an exponential cutoff at 2.7$\\pm$1.2$\\pm$1.3 GeV (the first/second\nuncertainties correspond to statistical/systematic errors) is preferred over a\nsingle power law at a level of 3.5 $\\sigma$. The possible existence of a cutoff\nhints at a magnetospheric origin of the emission. In addition, no extended\ngamma-ray emission is detected compatible with either the supernova remnant\n(CTA 1) or the very high energy (> 100 GeV) pulsar wind nebula. A flux upper\nlimit of 6.5$\\times$10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 10-300 GeV energy\nrange is reported, for an extended source assuming the morphology of the\nVERITAS detection. During on-peak phases, a sub-exponential cutoff is\nsignificantly preferred ($\\sim$11 $\\sigma$) for representing the spectral\nenergy distribution, both in the phase-averaged and in the phase-resolved\nspectra. Three glitches are detected during the observation period and we found\nno flux variability at the time of the glitches or in the long-term behavior.\nWe also report the discovery of a previously unknown gamma-ray source in the\nvicinity of PSR J0007+7303, Fermi J0020+7328, which we associate with the z =\n1.781 quasar S5 0016+73. A concurrent analysis of this source is needed to\ncorrectly characterize the behavior of CTA 1 and it is also presented in the\npaper.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the effects of a new version of the generalized\nuncertainty principle (modified GUP) on the dynamics of the Universe. As the\nmodified GUP will modify the relation between the entropy and area of the\napparent horizon, it will also deform the Friedmann equations within Jacobson's\napproach. We explicitly find these deformed Friedmann equations governing the\nmodified GUP-corrected dynamics of such a Universe. It is shown that the\nmodified GUP-deformed Jacobson's approach implies an upper bound for the\ndensity of such a Universe. The Big Bang singularity can therefore also be\navoided using the modified GUP-corrections to horizons' thermodynamics. In\nfact, we are able to analyze the pre Big Bang state of the Universe.\nFurthermore, the equations imply that the expansion of the Universe will come\nto a halt and then will immediately be followed by a contracting phase. When\nthe equations are extrapolated beyond the maximum rate of contraction, a cyclic\nUniverse scenario emerges.\n", "  Systems where all energy eigenstates are localized are known to display an\nemergent local integrability, in the sense that one can construct an extensive\nnumber of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian and are localized in real\nspace. Here we show that emergent local integrability does not require a\ncomplete set of localized eigenstates. Given a set of localized eigenstates\ncomprising a nonzero fraction $(1-f)$ of the full many body spectrum, one can\nconstruct an extensive number of integrals of motion which are local in the\nsense that they have {\\it nonzero weight} in a compact region of real space, in\nthe thermodynamic limit. However, these modified integrals of motion have a\n`global dressing' whose weight vanishes as $\\sim f$ as $f \\rightarrow 0$. In\nthis sense, the existence of a {\\it non-zero fraction} of localized eigenstates\nis sufficient for emergent local integrability. We discuss the implications of\nour findings for systems where the spectrum contains delocalized states, for\nsystems with projected Hilbert spaces, and for the robustness of quantum\nintegrability.\n", "  In this work we show that under specific anomalous diffusion conditions,\nchemical systems can produce well-ordered self-similar concentration patterns\nthrough a diffusion-driven instability. We also find spiral patterns and\npatterns with mixtures of rotational symmetries not reported before. The type\nof anomalous diffusion discussed in this work, either subdiffusion or\nsuperdiffusion, is a consequence of the medium heterogeneity, and is modelled\nthrough a space-dependent diffusion coefficient with a power-law functional\nform.\n", "  Motivated by recent progress in using restricted Boltzmann machines as\npreprocessing algorithms for deep neural network, we revisit the mean-field\nequations (belief-propagation and TAP equations) in the best understood such\nmachine, namely the Hopfield model of neural networks, and we explicit how they\ncan be used as iterative message-passing algorithms, providing a fast method to\ncompute the local polarizations of neurons. In the \"retrieval phase\" where\nneurons polarize in the direction of one memorized pattern, we point out a\nmajor difference between the belief propagation and TAP equations : the set of\nbelief propagation equations depends on the pattern which is retrieved, while\none can use a unique set of TAP equations. This makes the latter method much\nbetter suited for applications in the learning process of restricted Boltzmann\nmachines. In the case where the patterns memorized in the Hopfield model are\nnot independent, but are correlated through a combinatorial structure, we show\nthat the TAP equations have to be modified. This modification can be seen\neither as an alteration of the reaction term in TAP equations, or, more\ninterestingly, as the consequence of message passing on a graphical model with\nseveral hidden layers, where the number of hidden layers depends on the depth\nof the correlations in the memorized patterns. This layered structure is\nactually necessary when one deals with more general restricted Boltzmann\nmachines.\n", "  Assuming that neutrinos are Majorana particles, we explore what information\ncan be inferred from future strong limits (i.e. non-observation) for\nneutrinoless double beta decay. Specifically we consider the case where the\nmass hierarchy is normal and the different contributions to the effective mass\n$\\langle m \\rangle_{ee}$ partly cancel. We discuss how this fixes the two\nMajorana CP phases simultaneously from the Majorana Triangle and how it limits\nthe lightest neutrino mass $m_1$ within a narrow window. The two Majorana CP\nphases are in this case even better determined than in the usual case for\nlarger $\\langle m \\rangle_{ee}$. We show that the uncertainty in these\npredictions can be significantly reduced by the complementary measurement of\nreactor neutrino experiments, especially the medium baseline version\nJUNO/RENO-50. We also estimate the necessary precision on $\\langle m\n\\rangle_{ee}$ to infer non-trivial Majorana CP phases and the upper limit\n$\\langle m \\rangle_{ee} \\lesssim 1\\,\\mbox{meV}$ sets a target for the design of\nfuture neutrinoless double beta decay experiments.\n", "  We investigate turbulent gas motions in spiral galaxies and their importance\nto star formation in far outer disks, where the column density is typically far\nbelow the critical value for spontaneous gravitational collapse. Following the\nmethods of Burkhart et al. (2010) on the Small Magellanic Cloud, we use the\nthird and fourth statistical moments, as indicators of structures caused by\nturbulence, to examine the neutral hydrogen (HI) column density of a sample of\nspiral galaxies selected from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS, Walter et\nal. 2008). We apply the statistical moments in three different methods- the\ngalaxy as a whole, divided into a function of radii and then into grids. We\ncreate individual grid maps of kurtosis for each galaxy. To investigate the\nrelation between these moments and star formation, we compare these maps with\ntheir far-ultraviolet images taken by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX)\nsatellite. We find that the moments are largely uniform across the galaxies, in\nwhich the variation does not appear to trace any star forming regions. This\nmay, however, be due to the spatial resolution of our analysis, which could\npotentially limit the scale of turbulent motions that we are sensitive to\ngreater than ~700 pc. From comparison between the moments themselves, we find\nthat the gas motions in our sampled galaxies are largely supersonic. This\nanalysis also shows that Burkhart et al. (2010)'s methods may be applied not\njust to dwarf galaxies but also to normal spiral galaxies.\n", "  We present a detailed study of the rest-optical (3600-7000 Angstrom) nebular\nspectra of ~380 star-forming galaxies at z~2-3 obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE as\npart of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS). The KBSS-MOSFIRE sample is\nrepresentative of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, with stellar masses\nM*=10^9-10^11.5 M_sun and star formation rates SFR=3-1000 M_sun/yr. We focus on\nrobust measurements of many strong diagnostic emission lines for individual\ngalaxies: [O II]3727,3729, [Ne III]3869, H-beta, [O III]4960,5008, [N\nII]6549,6585, H-alpha, and [S II]6718,6732. Comparisons with observations of\ntypical local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and between\nsubsamples of KBSS-MOSFIRE show that high-redshift galaxies exhibit a number of\nsignificant differences in addition to the well-known offset in log([O\nIII]/H-beta) and log([N II]/H-alpha). We argue that the primary difference\nbetween H II regions in z~2.3 galaxies and those at z~0 is an enhancement in\nthe degree of nebular excitation, as measured by [O III]/H-beta and R23=log[([O\nIII]+[O II])/H-beta]. At the same time, KBSS-MOSFIRE galaxies are ~10 times\nmore massive than z~0 galaxies with similar ionizing spectra and have higher\nN/O (likely accompanied by higher O/H) at fixed excitation. These results\nindicate the presence of harder ionizing radiation fields at fixed N/O and O/H\nrelative to typical z~0 galaxies, consistent with Fe-poor stellar population\nmodels that include massive binaries, and highlight a population of massive,\nhigh-specific star formation rate galaxies at high-redshift with systematically\ndifferent star formation histories than galaxies of similar stellar mass today.\n", "  We show that eleven dimensional supergravity in Euclidean signature admits an\nexact classical solution with isometry corresponding to a three dimensional\nscale invariant field theory without conformal invariance. We also construct\nthe holographic renormalization group flow that connects the known UV conformal\nfixed point and the new scale invariant but not conformal fixed point. In view\nof holography, the existence of such classical solutions suggests that the\ntopologically twisted M2-brane gauge theory possesses a scale invariant but not\nconformal phase.\n", "  The interplay between multiple bands, sizable multi-band electronic\ncorrelations and strong spin-orbit coupling may conspire in selecting a rather\nunusual unconventional pairing symmetry in layered Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$. This\nmandates a detailed revisit of the normal state and, in particular, the\n$T$-dependent incoherence-coherence crossover. Using a modern first-principles\ncorrelated view, we study this issue in the actual structure of\nSr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ and present a unified and quantitative description of a range\nof unusual physical responses in the normal state. Armed with these, we propose\nthat a new and important element, that of dominant multi-orbital charge\nfluctuations in a Hund's metal, may be a primary pair glue for unconventional\nsuperconductivity. Thereby we establish a connection between the normal state\nresponses and superconductivity in this system.\n", "  The 6.8$\\sigma$ anomaly in excited 8Be nuclear decays via internal pair\ncreation is fit well by a new particle interpretation. In a previous analysis,\nwe showed that a 17 MeV protophobic gauge boson provides a particle physics\nexplanation of the anomaly consistent with all existing constraints. Here we\nbegin with a review of the physics of internal pair creation in 8Be decays and\nthe characteristics of the observed anomaly. To develop its particle\ninterpretation, we provide an effective operator analysis for excited 8Be\ndecays to particles with a variety of spins and parities and show that these\nconsiderations exclude simple models with scalar particles. We discuss the\nrequired couplings for a gauge boson to give the observed signal, highlighting\nthe significant dependence on the precise mass of the boson and isospin mixing\nand breaking effects. We present anomaly-free extensions of the Standard Model\nthat contain protophobic gauge bosons with the desired couplings to explain the\n8Be anomaly. In the first model, the new force carrier is a U(1)B gauge boson\nthat kinetically mixes with the photon; in the second model, it is a U(1)(B-L)\ngauge boson with a similar kinetic mixing. In both cases, the models predict\nrelatively large charged lepton couplings ~ 0.001 that can resolve the\ndiscrepancy in the muon anomalous magnetic moment and are amenable to many\nexperimental probes. The models also contain vectorlike leptons at the weak\nscale that may be accessible to near future LHC searches.\n", "  Understanding our Galactic Center is easier with insights from nearby\ngalactic nuclei. Both the star formation activity in nuclear gas disks, driven\nby bars and nuclear bars, and the fueling of low-luminosity AGN, followed by\nfeedback of jets, driving molecular outflows, were certainly present in our\nGalactic Center, which now appears to be quenched. Comparisons and diagnostics\nare reviewed, in particular of m=2 and m=1 modes, lopsidedness, different disk\norientations, and fossil evidences of activity and feedback.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the one-dimensional semirelativistic\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation for a particle interacting with $N$ Dirac delta\npotentials. Using the heat kernel techniques, we establish a resolvent formula\nin terms of an $N \\times N$ matrix, called the principal matrix. This matrix\nessentially includes all the information about the spectrum of the problem. We\nstudy the bound state spectrum by working out the eigenvalues of the principal\nmatrix. With the help of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, we analyze how the bound\nstate energies change with respect to the parameters in the model. We also\nprove that there are at most $N$ bound states and explicitly derive the bound\nstate wave function. The bound state problem for the two-center case is\nparticularly investigated. We show that the ground state energy is bounded\nbelow, and there exists a self-adjoint Hamiltonian associated with the\nresolvent formula. Moreover, we prove that the ground state is nondegenerate.\nThe scattering problem for $N$ centers is analyzed by exactly solving the\nsemirelativistic Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The reflection and the\ntransmission coefficients are numerically and asymptotically computed for the\ntwo-center case. We observe the so-called threshold anomaly for two\nsymmetrically located centers. The semirelativistic version of the\nKronig-Penney model is shortly discussed, and the band gap structure of the\nspectrum is illustrated. The bound state and scattering problems in the\nmassless case are also discussed. Furthermore, the reflection and the\ntransmission coefficients for the two delta potentials in this particular case\nare analytically found. Finally, we solve the renormalization group equations\nand compute the beta function nonperturbatively.\n", "  Recent progress in the field of molecular electronics has revealed the\nfundamental importance of the coupling between the electronic degrees of\nfreedom and specific vibrational modes. Considering the examples of a molecular\ndimer and a carbon nanotube double quantum dot, we here theoretically\ninvestigate transport through a two-site system that is strongly coupled to a\nsingle vibrational mode. Using a quantum master equation approach, we\ndemonstrate that, depending on the relative positions of the two dots,\nelectron-phonon interactions can lead to negative differential conductance and\nsuppression of the current through the system. We also discuss the experimental\nrelevance of the presented results and possible implementations of the studied\nsystem.\n", "  We prove that a solution of the Schr\\\"odinger-type equation\n$\\mathrm{i}\\partial_t u= Hu$, where $H$ is a Jacobi operator with\nasymptotically constant coefficients, cannot decay too fast at two different\ntimes unless it is trivial.\n", "  The extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background and its spatial anisotropy could\npotentially contain a signature of dark matter (DM) annihilation or particle\ndecay. Astrophysical foregrounds, such as blazars and star-forming galaxies\n(SFGs), however, dominate the $\\gamma$-ray background, precluding an easy\ndetection of the signal associated with the DM annihilation or decay in the\nbackground intensity spectrum. The DM imprint on the $\\gamma$-ray background is\nexpected to be correlated with large-scale structure tracers. In some cases,\nsuch a cross-correlation is even expected to have a higher signal-to-noise\nratio than the auto-correlation. One reliable tracer of the DM distribution in\nthe large-scale structure is lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB),\nand the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is a reliable tracer of SFGs. We\nanalyze Fermi-LAT data taken over 92 months and study the cross-correlation\nwith Planck CMB lensing, Planck CIB, and Fermi-$\\gamma$ maps. We put upper\nlimits on the DM annihilation cross-section from the cross-power spectra with\nthe $\\gamma$-ray background anisotropies. The unbiased power spectrum\nestimation is validated with simulations that include cross-correlated signals.\nWe also provide a set of systematic tests and show that no significant\ncontaminations are found for the measurements presented here. Using\n$\\gamma$-ray background map from data gathered over 92 months, we find the best\nconstraint on the DM annihilation with a $1\\sigma$ confidence level upper limit\nof $10^{-25}$-$10^{-24}$ cm$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$, when the mass of DM particles is\nbetween 20 and 100 GeV.\n", "  We investigate the inflationary predictions of a simple Horndeski theory\nwhere the inflaton scalar field has a non-minimal derivative coupling (NMDC) to\nthe Einstein tensor. The NMDC is very motivated for the construction of\nsuccessful models for inflation, nevertheless its inflationary predictions are\nnot observationally distinct. We show that it is possible to probe the effects\nof the NMDC on the CMB observables by taking into account both the dynamics of\nthe inflationary slow-roll phase and the subsequent reheating. We perform a\ncomparative study between representative inflationary models with canonical\nfields minimally coupled to gravity and models with NMDC. We find that the\ninflation models with dominant NMDC generically predict a higher reheating\ntemperature and a different range for the tilt of the scalar perturbation\nspectrum $n_s$ and scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, potentially testable by current\nand future CMB experiments.\n", "  We study the spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres in the\nVIS-IR spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR\nimaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. Disk-resolved observations\nwith a phase angle within the $7^{\\circ}<\\alpha<132^{\\circ}$ interval were used\nto characterize Ceres' phase curve in the 0.465-4.05 $\\mu$m spectral range.\nHapke's model was applied to perform the photometric correction of the dataset,\nallowing us to produce albedo and color maps of the surface. The $V$-band\nmagnitude phase function of Ceres was fitted with both the classical linear\nmodel and H-G formalism. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry\nparameter at 0.55$\\mu$m are $w=0.14\\pm0.02$ and $\\xi=-0.11\\pm0.08$,\nrespectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); the modeled geometric\nalbedo is $0.094\\pm0.007$; the roughness parameter is\n$\\bar{\\theta}=29^{\\circ}\\pm6^{\\circ}$. Albedo maps indicate small variability\non a global scale with an average reflectance of $0.034 \\pm 0.003$. Isolated\nareas such as the Occator bright spots, Haulani, and Oxo show an albedo much\nhigher than average. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the\naverage spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is\n$1.1\\%k\\AA^{-1}$ and $0.85\\%k\\AA^{-1}$ at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively.\nBroadband color indices are $V-R=0.38\\pm0.01$ and $R-I=0.33\\pm0.02$. H-G\nmodeling of the $V$-band magnitude phase curve for $\\alpha<30^{\\circ}$ gives\n$H=3.14\\pm0.04$ and $G=0.10\\pm0.04$, while the classical linear model provides\n$V(1,1,0^{\\circ})=3.48\\pm0.03$ and $\\beta=0.036\\pm0.002$. The comparison with\nspectrophotometric properties of other minor bodies indicates that Ceres has a\nless back-scattering phase function and a slightly higher albedo than comets\nand C-type objects. However, the latter represents the closest match in the\nusual asteroid taxonomy.\n", "  In this paper we study efficiency of particle acceleration in the\nmagnetospheres of stellar mass black holes. For this purpose we consider the\nlinearized set of the Euler equation, continuity equation and Poisson equation\nrespectively. After introducing the varying relativistic centrifugal force, we\nshow that the charge separation undergoes the parametric instability, leading\nto generation of centrifugally excited Langmuir waves. It is shown that these\nwaves, via the Langmuir collapse damp by means of the Landau damping, as a\nresult energy transfers to particles accelerating them to energies of the order\nof $10^{16}$eV.\n", "  We propose measuring the mass shift and width broadening of the $f_1(1285)$\nmeson together with those of the $\\omega$ from a nuclear target as a means to\nexperimentally probe the partial restoration of chiral symmetry inside the\nnuclear matter. The relation between the order parameter of chiral symmetry and\nthe difference in the correlation functions of the $f_1(1285)$ current and the\n$\\omega$ current is discussed in the limit where the disconnected diagrams are\nneglected. A QCD sum rule analysis of the $f_1(1285)$ meson mass leads to about\n100 MeV attraction in nuclear matter, which can be probed in future\nexperiments.\n", "  We reconsider the commonly held assumption that warm debris disks are tracers\nof terrestrial planet formation. The high occurrence rate inferred for\nEarth-mass planets around mature solar-type stars based on exoplanet surveys\n(roughly 20%) stands in stark contrast to the low incidence rate (less than\n2-3%) of warm dusty debris around solar-type stars during the expected epoch of\nterrestrial planet assembly (roughly 10 Myr). If Earth-mass planets at AU\ndistances are a common outcome of the planet formation process, this\ndiscrepancy suggests that rocky planet formation occurs more quickly and/or is\nmuch neater than traditionally believed, leaving behind little in the way of a\ndust signature. Alternatively, the incidence rate of terrestrial planets has\nbeen overestimated or some previously unrecognized physical mechanism removes\nwarm dust efficiently from the terrestrial planet region. A promising removal\nmechanism is gas drag in a residual gaseous disk with a surface density of\nroughly or somewhat more than 0.001% of the minimum mass solar nebula.\n", "  A minimal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a single new mass scale\nand providing a complete and consistent picture of particle physics and\ncosmology up to the Planck scale is presented. We add to the SM three\nright-handed SM-singlet neutrinos, a new vector-like color triplet fermion and\na complex SM singlet scalar $\\sigma$ that stabilises the Higgs potential and\nwhose vacuum expectation value at $\\sim 10^{11}$ GeV breaks lepton number and a\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry simultaneously. Primordial inflation is produced by a\ncombination of $\\sigma$ (non-minimally coupled to the scalar curvature) and the\nSM Higgs. Baryogenesis proceeds via thermal leptogenesis. At low energies, the\nmodel reduces to the SM, augmented by seesaw-generated neutrino masses, plus\nthe axion, which solves the strong CP problem and accounts for the dark matter\nin the Universe. The model predicts a minimum value of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio $r\\simeq 0.004$, running of the scalar spectral index $\\alpha\\simeq -\n7\\times 10^{-4}$, the axion mass $m_A\\sim 100\\,\\mu{\\rm eV}$ and cosmic axion\nbackground radiation corresponding to an increase of the effective number of\nrelativistic neutrinos of $\\sim 0.03$. It can be probed decisively by the next\ngeneration of cosmic microwave background and axion dark matter experiments.\n", "  We present an analysis of the gamma-ray measurements by the Large Area\nTelescope onboard the \\textit{Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} in the region of\nthe supernova remnant~(SNR) Monoceros Loop~(G205.5$+$0.5). The brightest\ngamma-ray peak is spatially correlated with the Rosette Nebula, which is a\nmolecular cloud complex adjacent to the southeast edge of the SNR. After\nsubtraction of this emission by spatial modeling, the gamma-ray emission from\nthe SNR emerges, which is extended and fit by a Gaussian spatial template. The\ngamma-ray spectra are significantly better reproduced by a curved shape than a\nsimple power law. The luminosities between 0.2--300~GeV are $\\sim$~$4 \\times\n10^{34}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ for the SNR and $\\sim$~$3 \\times 10^{34}$~erg~s$^{-1}$\nfor the Rosette Nebula, respectively. We argue that the gamma rays likely\noriginate from the interactions of particles accelerated in the SNR. The decay\nof neutral pions produced in nucleon-nucleon interactions of accelerated\nhadrons with interstellar gas provides a reasonable explanation for the\ngamma-ray emission of both the Rosette Nebula and the Monoceros SNR.\n", "  In the context of quantum tomography, we recently introduced a quantity\ncalled a partial determinant \\cite{jackson2015detecting}. PDs (partial\ndeterminants) are explicit functions of the collected data which are sensitive\nto the presence of state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) correlations.\nImportantly, this is done without any need to estimate state-preparation or\nmeasurement parameters. In the present work, we wish to better explain our\ntheoretical perspective behind the PD. Further, we would like to demonstrate\nthat there is an overwhelming variety of applications and generalizations of\nthe PD. In particular we will construct methods for detecting SPAM correlations\nin multiqudit systems. The relationship between the PDs of each method and the\ncorrelations they are sensitive to is topological. We give a classification of\nall such methods but focus on explicitly detailing only the most scalable\nmethods, $\\mathcal{O}(d^4)$.\n", "  We present the first comprehensive broadband optical spectroscopy data on two\ninsulating phases of vanadium dioxide (VO2): monoclinic M2 and triclinic. The\nmain result of our work is that the energy gap and the electronic structure are\nessentially unaltered by the first-order structural phase transition between\nthe M2 and triclinic phases. Moreover, the optical interband features in the M2\nand triclinic phases are remarkably similar to those observed in the\nwell-studied monoclinic M1 insulating phase of VO2. As the energy gap is\ninsensitive to the different lattice structures of the three insulating phases,\nwe rule out Peierls effects as the dominant contributor to the opening of the\ngap. Rather, the energy gap arises from intra-atomic Coulomb correlations.\n", "  A promising proposal for resolving the cusp-core anomaly in the density\nprofile of dwarf galaxies is to allow dark matter to interact with itself\nthrough a light mediator of mass much less than a GeV. The theoretical\nchallenge is to have a complete renormalizable theory where this happens\nnaturally even though dark matter itself may be of the electroweak scale, i.e.\n100 GeV to 1 TeV. I propose here such a model, with just two neutral complex\nscalar singlets under a softly broken dark global U(1) symmetry.\n", "  Our main aim is to determine carbon-to-nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios for\nevolved giants in the open clusters NGC 2324, NGC 2477, and NGC 3960, which\nhave turn-off masses of about 2 Msun, and to compare them with predictions of\ntheoretical models. High-resolution spectra were analysed using a differential\nsynthetic spectrum method. Abundances of carbon were derived using the C2 Swan\n(0,1) band heads at 5135 and 5635.5 A. The wavelength interval 7940-8130 A with\nstrong CN features was analysed to determine nitrogen abundances and carbon\nisotope ratios. The oxygen abundances were determined from the [Oi] line at\n6300 A. The mean values of the CNO abundances are [C/Fe]=-0.35+-0.06 (s.d.),\n[N/Fe]=0.28+-0.05, and [O/Fe]=-0.02+-0.10 in seven stars of NGC 2324;\n[C/Fe]=-0.26+-0.02, [N/Fe]=0.39+-0.04, and [O/Fe]=-0.11+-0.06 in six stars of\nNGC 2477; and [C/Fe]=-0.39+-0.04, [N/Fe]=0.32+-0.05, and [O/Fe]=-0.19+-0.06 in\nsix stars of NGC 3960. The mean C/N ratio is equal to 0.92+-0.12, 0.91+-0.09,\nand 0.80+-0.13, respectively. The mean 12C/13C ratio is equal to 21+-1, 20+-1,\nand 16+-4, respectively. The 12C/13C and C/N ratios of stars in the\ninvestigated open clusters were compared with the ratios predicted by stellar\nevolution models. The mean values of the 12C/13C and C/N ratios in NGC 2324 and\nNGC 2477 agree well with the first dredge-up and thermohaline-induced\nextra-mixing models, which are similar for intermediate turn-off mass stars.\nThe 12C/13C ratios in the investigated clump stars of NGC 3960 span from 10 to\n20. The mean carbon isotope and C/N ratios in NGC 3960 are close to predictions\nof the model in which the thermohaline- and rotation-induced (if rotation\nvelocity at the zero-age main sequence was 30% of the critical velocity)\nextra-mixing act together.\n", "  We consider a quantum system periodically driven with a strength which varies\nslowly on the scale of the driving period. The analysis is based on a general\nformulation of the Floquet theory relying on the extended Hilbert space. It is\nshown that the dynamics of the system can be described in terms of a slowly\nvarying effective Floquet Hamiltonian that captures the long-term evolution, as\nwell as rapidly oscillating micromotion operators. We obtain a systematic\nhigh-frequency expansion of all these operators. Generalizing the previous\nstudies, the expanded effective Hamiltonian is now time-dependent and contains\nextra terms appearing due to changes in the periodic driving. The same applies\nto the micromotion operators which exhibit a slow temporal dependence in\naddition to the rapid oscillations. As an illustration, we consider a\nquantum-mechanical spin in an oscillating magnetic field with a slowly changing\ndirection. The effective evolution of the spin is then associated with\nnon-Abelian geometric phases reflecting the geometry of the extended Floquet\nspace. The developed formalism is general and also applies to other\nperiodically driven systems, such as shaken optical lattices with a\ntime-dependent shaking strength, a situation relevant to the cold atom\nexperiments.\n", "  Most, if not all, scalar-tensor theories are equivalent to General Relativity\nwith a disformally coupled matter sector. In extra-dimensional theories such a\ncoupling can be understood as a result of induction of the metric on a brane\nthat matter is confined to. This article presents a first look at the\nnon-Gaussianities in disformally coupled inflation, a simple two-field model\nthat features a novel kinetic interaction. Cases with both canonical and\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) kinetic terms are taken into account, the latter\nmotivated by the possible extra-dimensional origin of the disformality. The\ncomputations are carried out for the equilateral configuration in the slow-roll\nregime, wherein it is found that the non-Gaussianity is typically rather small\nand negative. This is despite the fact that the new kinetic interaction causes\nthe perturbation modes to propagate with different sounds speeds, which may\nboth significantly deviate from unity during inflation.\n", "  Josephson parametric converters (JPCs) are superconducting devices capable of\nperforming nondegenerate, three-wave mixing in the microwave domain without\nlosses. One drawback limiting their use in scalable quantum architectures is\nthe large footprint of the auxiliary circuit needed for their operation, in\nparticular, the use of off-chip, bulky, broadband hybrids and magnetic coils.\nHere, we realize a JPC which eliminates the need for these bulky components.\nThe pump drive and flux bias are applied in the new device through an on-chip,\nlossless, three-port power divider and on-chip flux line, respectively. We show\nthat the new design considerably simplifies the circuit and reduces the\nfootprint of the device while maintaining a comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art JPCs. Furthermore, we exploit the tunable bandwidth property\nof the JPC and the added capability of applying alternating currents to the\nflux line in order to switch the resonance frequencies of the device, hence\ndemonstrating time-multiplexed amplification of microwave tones that are\nseparated by more than the dynamical bandwidth of the amplifier. Such a\nmeasurement technique can potentially serve to perform time-multiplexed,\nhigh-fidelity readout of superconducting qubits.\n", "  The paper is devoted to nonlinear localized modes (\"gap solitons\") for the\nspatially one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation (1D GPE) with a periodic\npotential and repulsive interparticle interactions. It has been recently shown\n(G. L. Alfimov, A. I. Avramenko, Physica D, 254, 29 (2013)) that under certain\nconditions all the stationary modes for the 1D GPE can be coded by bi-infinite\nsequences of symbols of some finite alphabet (called \"codes\" of the solutions).\nWe present and justify a numerical method which allows to reconstruct the\nprofile of a localized mode by its code. As an example, the method is applied\nto compute the profiles of gap solitons for 1D GPE with a cosine potential.\n", "  The perspective of Kac-Schwarz operators is introduced to the authors'\nprevious work on the quantum mirror curves of topological string theory in\nstrip geometry and closed topological vertex. Open string amplitudes on each\nleg of the web diagram of such geometry can be packed into a multi-variate\ngenerating function. This generating function turns out to be a tau function of\nthe KP hierarchy. The tau function has a fermionic expression, from which one\nfinds a vector $|W\\rangle$ in the fermionic Fock space that represents a point\n$W$ of the Sato Grassmannian. $|W\\rangle$ is generated from the vacuum vector\n$|0\\rangle$ by an operator $g$ on the Fock space. $g$ determines an operator\n$G$ on the space $V = \\mathbb{C}((x))$ of Laurent series in which $W$ is\nrealized as a linear subspace. $G$ generates an admissible basis\n$\\{\\Phi_j(x)\\}_{j=0}^\\infty$ of $W$. $q$-difference analogues $A$, $B$ of\nKac-Schwarz operators are defined with the aid of $G$. $\\Phi_j(x)$'s satisfy\nthe linear equations $A\\Phi_j(x) = q^j\\Phi_j(x)$, $B\\Phi_j(x) = \\Phi_{j+1}(x)$.\nThe lowest equation $A\\Phi_0(x) = \\Phi_0(x)$ reproduces the quantum mirror\ncurve in the authors' previous work.\n", "  Scattering of electromagnetic waves by an arbitrary nanoscale object can be\ncharacterized by a multipole decomposition of the electromagnetic field that\nallows to describe the scattering intensity and radiation pattern through\ninterferences of dominating excited multipole modes. In modern nanophotonics,\nboth generation and interference of multipole modes start to play an\nindispensable role, and they enable nanoscale manipulation of light with many\nrelated applications. Here we review the multipolar interference effects in\nmetallic, metal-dielectric, and dielectric nanostructures, and suggest a\ncomprehensive view on many phenomena involving the interferences of electric,\nmagnetic and toroidal multipoles, which drive a number of recently discussed\neffects in nanophotonics such as unidirectional scattering, effective optical\nantiferromagnetism, generalized Kerker scattering with controlled angular\npatterns, generalized Brewster angle, and nonradiating optical anapoles. We\nfurther discuss other types of possible multipolar interference effects not yet\nexploited in literature and envisage the prospect of achieving more flexible\nand advanced nanoscale control of light relying on the concepts of multipolar\ninterference through full phase and amplitude engineering.\n", "  Methods are developed, which use the pulse-height spectra of SiPMs measured\nin the dark and illuminated by pulsed light, to determine the pulse shape, the\ndark-count rate, the gain, the average number of photons initiating a Geiger\ndischarge, the probabilities for prompt cross-talk and after-pulses, as well as\nthe electronics noise and the gain fluctuations between and in pixels. The\nentire pulse-height spectra, including the background regions in-between the\npeaks corresponding to different number of Geiger discharges, are described by\nsingle functions. As a demonstration, the model is used to characterise a KETEK\nSiPM with 4382 pixels of 15 \\mu m x 15 \\mu m area for voltages between 2.5 and\n8 V above the breakdown voltage at 20{\\deg}C. The results are compared to other\nmethods of characterising SiPMs. Finally, examples are given, how the complete\ndescription of the pulse-eight spectra can be used to optimise the operating\nvoltage of SiPMs, and a method for an in-situ calibration and monitoring of\nSiPMs, suited for large-scale applications, is proposed.\n", "  Parametric instability is an intrinsic risk in high power laser\ninterferometer gravitational wave detectors, in which the optical cavity modes\ninteract with the acoustic modes of the mirrors leading to exponential growth\nof the acoustic vibration. In this paper, we investigate the potential\nparametric instability for a proposed next generation gravitational wave\ndetector based on cooled silicon test masses. It is shown that there would be\nabout 2 unstable modes per test mass, with the highest parametric gain of ~76.\nThe importance of developing suitable instability suppression schemes is\nemphasized.\n", "  It was proposed recently that the out-of-time-ordered four-point correlator\n(OTOC) may serve as a useful characteristic of quantum-chaotic behavior,\nbecause in the semi-classical limit, $\\hbar \\to 0$, its rate of exponential\ngrowth resembles the classical Lyapunov exponent. Here, we calculate the\nfour-point correlator, $C(t)$, for the classical and quantum kicked rotor -- a\ntextbook driven chaotic system -- and compare its growth rate at initial times\nwith the standard definition of the classical Lyapunov exponent. Using both\nquantum and classical arguments, we show that the OTOC's growth rate and the\nLyapunov exponent are in general distinct quantities, corresponding to the\nlogarithm of phase-space averaged divergence rate of classical trajectories and\nto the phase-space average of the logarithm, respectively. The difference\nappears to be more pronounced in the regime of low kicking strength $K$, where\nno classical chaos exists globally. In this case, the Lyapunov exponent quickly\ndecreases as $K \\to 0$, while the OTOC's growth rate may decrease much slower\nshowing higher sensitivity to small chaotic islands in the phase space. We also\nshow that the quantum correlator as a function of time exhibits a clear\nsingularity at the Ehrenfest time $t_E$: transitioning from a time-independent\nvalue of $t^{-1} \\ln{C(t)}$ at $t < t_E$ to its monotonous decrease with time\nat $t>t_E$. We note that the underlying physics here is the same as in the\ntheory of weak (dynamical) localization [Aleiner and Larkin, Phys. Rev. B 54,\n14423 (1996); Tian, Kamenev, and Larkin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 124101 (2004)]\nand is due to a delay in the onset of quantum interference effects, which occur\nsharply at a time of the order of the Ehrenfest time.\n", "  Muon neutrino disappearance measurements at NO$\\nu$A suggest that maximal\n$\\theta_{23}$ is excluded at the 2.6$\\sigma$ CL. This is in mild tension with\nT2K data which prefer maximal mixing. Considering that NO$\\nu$A has a much\nlonger baseline than T2K, we point out that the apparent departure from maximal\nmixing in NO$\\nu$A may be a consequence of nonstandard neutrino propagation in\nmatter.\n", "  A charged Higgs in the type II two-Higgs-doublet model (THDM) has been\nbounded to be above a few hundred GeV by the radiative $B$ decays. A Higgs\ntriplet extension of the THDM not only provides an origin of neutrino masses\nand a completely new doubly-charged Higgs decay pattern, but it also achieves a\nlight-charged Higgs with a mass of ${\\cal O}(100)$ GeV through the new scalar\ncouplings in the scalar potential. It was found that these light-charged Higgs\ndecays depend on its mass $m_{H^\\pm}$, $\\tan\\beta$, and mixing effect\n$\\sin\\theta_\\pm$: at $\\tan\\beta =1$, if $m_{H^\\pm} > m_W + m_Z$, $\\bar b b\nW^\\pm$, $W^\\pm Z$, and $\\tau \\nu$ are the main decay modes; however, if\n$m_{H^\\pm} < m_W + m_Z$, the main decay modes are then $\\bar b b W$ and $\\tau\n\\nu$, and at $\\tan\\beta=30$, the $\\tau \\nu$ mode dominates the other decays.\nWhen $m_t > m_{H^\\pm} + m_b$, we found that the ATLAS and CMS recent upper\nbounds on the product of $BR(t\\to H^+ b)BR(H^+\\to \\tau^+ \\nu)$ can be directly\napplied and will give a strict constraint on the correlation of $m_{H^\\pm}$ and\n$\\sin\\theta_\\pm$. If the upper bound of $BR(t\\to H^+ b)BR(H^+\\to \\tau^+ \\nu)$\nis satisfied (escaped) for $m_t > (<) m_{H^\\pm} + m_b$, it was found that the\nsignificance of discovering the charged Higgs through $H^\\pm \\to W^\\pm Z$ is\nmuch lower than that through $H^\\pm \\to \\bar b b W^\\pm$. With a luminosity of\n100 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and including the experimental bounds, the\nsignificance of the $H^\\pm \\to \\bar b b W^\\pm$ signal can reach around $6.2\n(2.4)\\sigma$ for $m_{H^\\pm} <(>) m_W + m_Z$.\n", "  We study the behavior of strongly interacting matter under an external\nconstant magnetic field in the context of nonlocal chiral quark models within\nthe mean field approximation. We find that at zero temperature the behavior of\nthe quark condensates shows the expected magnetic catalysis effect, our\npredictions being in good quantitative agreement with lattice QCD results. On\nthe other hand, in contrast to what happens in the standard local\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model, when the analysis is extended to the case of finite\ntemperature our results show that nonlocal models naturally lead to the Inverse\nMagnetic Catalysis effect.\n", "  We present a 1.4 GHz Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) study of a sample\nof early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the volume- and magnitude-limited ATLAS-3D\nsurvey. The radio morphologies of these ETGs at a resolution of 5\" are diverse\nand include sources that are compact on sub-kpc scales, resolved structures\nsimilar to those seen in star-forming spiral galaxies, and kpc-scale radio\njets/lobes associated with active nuclei. We compare the 1.4 GHz, molecular\ngas, and infrared (IR) properties of these ETGs. The most CO-rich ATLAS-3D ETGs\nhave radio luminosities consistent with extrapolations from H_2-mass-derived\nstar formation rates from studies of late-type galaxies. These ETGs also follow\nthe radio-IR correlation. However, ETGs with lower molecular gas masses tend to\nhave less radio emission relative to their CO and IR emission compared to\nspirals. The fraction of galaxies in our sample with high IR-radio ratios is\nmuch higher than in previous studies, and cannot be explained by a systematic\nunderestimation of the radio luminosity due to the presence extended,\nlow-surface-brightness emission that was resolved-out in our VLA observations.\nIn addition, we find that the high IR-radio ratios tend to occur at low IR\nluminosities, but are not associated with low dynamical mass or metallicity.\nThus, we have identified a population of ETGs that have a genuine shortfall of\nradio emission relative to both their IR and molecular gas emission. A number\nof mechanisms may conspire to cause this radio deficiency, including a\nbottom-heavy stellar initial mass function, weak magnetic fields, a higher\nprevalence of environmental effects compared to spirals and enhanced cosmic ray\nlosses.\n", "  We present a Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance study of the charge\nstripe ordered phase of LBCO, with detection of previously unobserved\n('wiped-out') signal. We show that spin-spin and spin-lattice relaxation rates\nare strongly enhanced in the charge ordered phase, explaining the apparent\nsignal decrease in earlier investigations. The enhancement is caused by\nmagnetic, rather than charge fluctuations, conclusively confirming the\nlong-suspected assumption that spin fluctuations are responsible for the\nwipeout effect. Observation of the full Cu signal enables insight into the spin\nand charge dynamics of the stripe-ordered phase, and measurements in external\nmagnetic fields provide information on the nature and suppression of spin\nfluctuations associated with charge order. We find glassy spin dynamics, in\nagreement with previous work, and incommensurate static charge order with\ncharge modulation amplitude similar to other cuprate compounds, suggesting that\nthe amplitude of charge stripes is universal in the cuprates.\n", "  By performing a global magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulation for the Milky\nWay with an axisymmetric gravitational potential, we propose that spatially\ndependent amplification of magnetic fields possibly explains the observed\nnoncircular motion of the gas in the Galactic centre (GC) region. The radial\ndistribution of the rotation frequency in the bulge region is not monotonic in\ngeneral. The amplification of the magnetic field is enhanced in regions with\nstronger differential rotation, because magnetorotational instability and\nfield-line stretching are more effective. The strength of the amplified\nmagnetic field reaches >~ 0.5 mG, and radial flows of the gas are excited by\nthe inhomogeneous transport of angular momentum through turbulent magnetic\nfield that is amplified in a spatially dependent manner. As a result, the\nsimulated position-velocity diagram exhibits a time-dependent asymmetric\nparallelogram-shape owing to the intermittency of the magnetic turbulence; the\npresent model provides a viable alternative to the bar-potential-driven model\nfor the parallelogram shape of the central molecular zone. In addition, Parker\ninstability (magnetic buoyancy) creates vertical magnetic structure, which\nwould correspond to observed molecular loops, and frequently excited vertical\nflows. Furthermore, the time-averaged net gas flow is directed outward, whereas\nthe flows are highly time dependent, which would contribute to the outflow from\nthe bulge.\n", "  Although people have already artificially formed parity--time\n($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry with gain and loss in a balanced manner, it is still\na defect that the gain is restricted to semi--classical but not full quantum.\nHere we propose and analyze a theoretical scheme to realize full quantum\noscillator $\\mathcal{PT}$--symmetry. The quantum gain is provided by a\ndissipation optical cavity with blue detuned laser field. After adiabatically\neliminating the cavity modes, we give an effective master equation, which is a\nmore complete quantum description compared with non--Hermitian Hamiltonian, to\nreveal the quantum behaviors of such a gain oscillator. This kind of\n$\\mathcal{PT}$--symmetry can eliminate the dissipation effect in quantum\nregime. As examples, we finally apply $\\mathcal{PT}$--symmetric oscillators to\nenhance optomechanically induced transparency and to preserve oscillator\nnon--classical state.\n", "  Based on the central limit theorem, we discuss the problem of evaluation of\nthe statistical error of Monte Carlo calculations using a time discretized\ndiffusion process. We present a robust and practical method to determine the\neffective variance of general observables and show how to verify the\nequilibrium hypothesis by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We then derive scaling\nlaws of the efficiency illustrated by Variational Monte Carlo calculations on\nthe two dimensional electron gas.\n", "  Context. The temperate Earth-mass planet Proxima b is the closest exoplanet\nto Earth and represents what may be our best ever opportunity to search for\nlife outside the Solar System. Aims. We aim at directly detecting Proxima b and\ncharacterizing its atmosphere by spatially resolving the planet and obtaining\nhigh-resolution reflected-light spectra. Methods. We propose to develop a\ncoupling interface between the SPHERE high-contrast imager and the new ESPRESSO\nspectrograph, both installed at ESO VLT. The angular separation of 37 mas\nbetween Proxima b and its host star requires the use of visible wavelengths to\nspatially resolve the planet on a 8.2-m telescope. At an estimated\nplanet-to-star contrast of ~10^-7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely\nchallenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a\n~10^3-10^4 contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of\nESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from\nthe stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to\nSPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5-sigma detection of the planet and yield a\nmeasurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time,\nassuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible\nto probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,\nand the methane band at 715 nm. In particular, a 3.6-sigma detection of O2\ncould be made in about 60 nights of telescope time. Those would need to be\nspread over 3 years considering optimal observability conditions for the\nplanet. Conclusions. The very existence of Proxima b and the SPHERE-ESPRESSO\nsynergy represent a unique opportunity to detect biosignatures on an exoplanet\nin the near future. It is also a crucial pathfinder experiment for the\ndevelopment of Extremely Large Telescopes and their instruments (abridged).\n", "  Nanoparticles functionalized with multiple ligands can be programmed to bind\nbiological targets depending on the receptors they express, providing a general\nmechanism exploited in various technologies, from selective drug-delivery to\nbiosensing. For binding to be highly selective, ligands should exclusively\ninteract with specific targeted receptors, because formation of bonds with\nother, untargeted ones would lead to non-specific binding and potentially\nharmful behaviour. This poses a particular problem for multivalent\nnanoparticles, because even very weak bonds can collectively lead to strong\nbinding. A statistical mechanical model is used here to describe how\ncompetition between different receptors together with multivalent effects can\nbe harnessed to design ligand-functionalized nanoparticles insensitive to the\npresence of untargeted receptors, are insensitive to these problems, preventing\nnon-specific binding.\n", "  The spatial distribution of the metals residing in the intra-cluster medium\n(ICM) of galaxy clusters records all the information on a cluster's\nnucleosynthesis and chemical enrichment history. We present measurements from a\ntotal of 1.2 Ms Suzaku XIS and 72 ks Chandra observations of the cool-core\ngalaxy cluster Abell 3112 out its virial radius (~ 1470 kpc). We find that the\nratio of the observed supernova type Ia explosions to the total supernova\nexplosions has a uniform distribution at a level of 12-16% out to the cluster's\nvirial radius. The observed fraction of type Ia supernova explosions is in\nagreement with the corresponding fraction found in our Galaxy and the chemical\nenrichment of our Galaxy. The non-varying supernova enrichment suggests that\nthe ICM in cluster outskirts was enriched by metals at an early stage before\nthe cluster itself was formed during the period of intense star formation\nactivity. Additionally, we find that the 2D delayed detonation model CDDT\nproduces significantly worse fits to the X-ray spectra compared to simple 1D W7\nmodels. This is due to the relative overestimate of Si, and underestimate of\nMg, in these models with respect to the measured abundances.\n", "  We report the detection of stellar eclipses in the LP 661-13 system. We\npresent the discovery and characterization of this system, including high\nresolution spectroscopic radial velocities and a photometric solution spanning\ntwo observing seasons. LP 661-13 is a low mass binary system with an orbital\nperiod of $4.7043512^{+0.0000013}_{-0.0000010}$ days at a distance of $24.9 \\pm\n1.3$ parsecs. LP 661-13A is a $0.30795 \\pm 0.00084$ $M_\\odot$ star while LP\n661-13B is a $0.19400 \\pm 0.00034$ $M_\\odot$ star. The radius of each component\nis $0.3226 \\pm 0.0033$ $R_\\odot$ and $0.2174 \\pm 0.0023$ $R_\\odot$,\nrespectively. We detect out of eclipse modulations at a period slightly shorter\nthan the orbital period, implying that at least one of the components is not\nrotating synchronously. We find that each component is slightly inflated\ncompared to stellar models, and that this cannot be reconciled through age or\nmetallicity effects. As a nearby eclipsing binary system where both components\nare near or below the full-convection limit, LP 661-13 will be a valuable test\nof models for the structure of cool dwarf stars.\n", "  The dispersal of the circumstellar discs of dust and gas surrounding young\nlow- mass stars has important implications for the formation of planetary\nsystems. Photo- evaporation from energetic radiation from the central object is\nthought to drive the dispersal in the majority of discs, by creating a gap\nwhich disconnects the outer from the inner regions of the disc and then\ndisperses the outer disc from the inside-out, while the inner disc keeps\ndraining viscously onto the star. In this Letter we show that the disc around\nTW Hya, the closest protoplanetary disc to Earth, may be the first object where\na photoevaporative gap has been imaged around the time at which it is being\ncreated. Indeed the detected gap in the ALMA images is consistent with the\nexpectations of X-ray photoevaporation models, thus not requiring the presence\nof a planet. The photoevaporation model is also consistent with a broad range\nof properties of the TW Hya system, e.g. accretion rate and the location of the\ngap at the onset of dispersal. We show that the central, unresolved 870 {\\mu}m\ncontinuum source might be produced by free free emission from the gas and/or\nresidual dust inside the gap.\n", "  The Milky Way Galaxy glows with the soft gamma ray emission resulting from\nthe annihilation of $\\sim 5 \\times 10^{43}$ electron-positron pairs every\nsecond. The origin of this vast quantity of antimatter and the peculiar\nmorphology of the 511keV gamma ray line resulting from this annihilation have\nbeen the subject of debate for almost half a century. Most obvious positron\nsources are associated with star forming regions and cannot explain the rate of\npositron annihilation in the Galactic bulge, which last saw star formation some\n$10\\,\\mathrm{Gyr}$ ago, or else violate stringent constraints on the positron\ninjection energy. Radioactive decay of elements formed in core collapse\nsupernovae (CCSNe) and normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) could supply\npositrons matching the injection energy constraints but the distribution of\nsuch potential sources does not replicate the required morphology. We show that\na single class of peculiar thermonuclear supernova - SN1991bg-like supernovae\n(SNe 91bg) - can supply the number and distribution of positrons we see\nannihilating in the Galaxy through the decay of $^{44}$Ti synthesised in these\nevents. Such $^{44}$Ti production simultaneously addresses the observed\nabundance of $^{44}$Ca, the $^{44}$Ti decay product, in solar system material.\n", "  Models of spatial firm competition assume that customers are distributed in\nspace and transportation costs are associated with their purchases of products\nfrom a small number of firms that are also placed at definite locations. It has\nbeen long known that the competition equilibrium is not guaranteed to exist if\nthe most straightforward linear transportation costs are assumed. We show by\nsimulations and also analytically that if periodic boundary conditions in two\ndimensions are assumed, the equilibrium exists for a pair of firms at any\ndistance. When a larger number of firms is considered, we find that their total\nequilibrium profit is inversely proportional to the square root of the number\nof firms. We end with a numerical investigation of the system's behavior for a\ngeneral transportation cost exponent.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), which in long-range ordered ferromagnets\nappears as a voltage transverse to the current and usually is proportional to\nthe magnetization, often is believed to be of negligible size in\nantiferromagnets due to their low uniform magnetization. However, recent\nexperiments and theory have demonstrated that certain antiferromagnets with a\nnon-collinear arrangement of magnetic moments exhibit a sizeable spontaneous\nAHE at zero field due to a non-vanishing Berry curvature arising from the\nquantum mechanical phase of the electron's wave functions. Here we show that\nantiferromagnetic Mn5Si3 single crystals exibit a large AHE which is strongly\nanisotropic and shows multiple transitions with sign changes at different\nmagnetic fields due to field-induced rearrangements of the magnetic structure\ndespite only tiny variations of the total magnetization. The presence of\nmultiple non-collinear magnetic phases offers the unique possiblity to explore\nthe details of the AHE and the sensitivity of the Hall effect on the details of\nthe magnetic texture.\n", "  The angular resolution (~10\") achieved by the Herschel Space Observatory\n~3.5m telescope at FIR wavelengths allowed us to roughly separate the emission\ntoward the inner parsec of the galaxy (the central cavity) from that of the\nsurrounding circumnuclear disk (the CND). The FIR spectrum toward SgrA* is\ndominated by intense [Oiii], [Oi], [Cii], [Niii], [Nii], and [Ci]\nfine-structure lines (in decreasing order of luminosity) arising in gas\nirradiated by the strong UV field from the central stellar cluster. The high-J\nCO rotational line intensities observed at the interface between the inner CND\nand the central cavity are consistent with a hot isothermal component at\nT~10^{3.1} K and n(H_2)~10^4 cm^{-3}. They are also consistent with a\ndistribution of lower temperatures at higher gas density, with most CO at T~300\nK. The hot CO component (either the bulk of the CO column density or just a\nsmall fraction depending on the above scenario) likely results from a\ncombination of UV and shock-driven heating. Although this component is beam\ndiluted in our FIR observations, it may be resolved at much higher angular\nresolution. An ALMA project using different molecular tracers to characterize\nUV-irradiated shocks in the innermost layers of the CND is ongoing.\n", "  Organic semiconductors find increasing importance in spin transport devices\ndue to the modulation and control of their properties through chemical\nsynthetic versatility. The organic materials are used as interlayers between\ntwo ferromagnet (FM) electrodes in organic spin valves (OSV), as well as for\nmagnetic spin manipulation of metal-organic complexes at the molecular level.\nIn the latter, specifically, the substrate-induced magnetic switching in a\nparamagnetic molecule has been evoked extensively, but studied by delicate\nsurface spectroscopies. Here we present evidence of the substantial magnetic\nswitching in a nanosized thin film of the paramagnetic molecule,\ntris(8-hydroxyquinoline)iron(III) (Feq3) deposited on a FM substrate, using the\nmagnetoresistance response of electrical spin-injection in an OSV structure,\nand the inverse-spin-Hall effect induced by state-of-art pulsed microwave\nspin-pumping. We show that interfacial spin control at the molecular level may\nlead to a macroscopic organic spin transport device, thus, bridging the gap\nbetween organic spintronics and molecular spintronics.\n", "  We present an innovative method for magnetic resonance force microscopy\n(MRFM) with ultra-low dissipation, by using the higher modes of the mechanical\ndetector as radio frequency (rf) source. This method allows MRFM on samples\nwithout the need to be close to an rf source. Furthermore, since rf sources\nrequire currents that give dissipation, our method enables nuclear magnetic\nresonance experiments at ultra-low temperatures. Removing the need for an\non-chip rf source is an important step towards a MRFM which can be widely used\nin condensed matter physics.\n", "  The spectral line polarization encodes a wealth of information about the\nthermal and magnetic properties of the solar atmosphere. Modeling the Stokes\nprofiles of strong resonance lines is, however, a complex problem both from the\ntheoretical and computational point of view, especially when partial frequency\nredistribution (PRD) effects need to be taken into account. In this work, we\nconsider a two-level atom in the presence of magnetic fields of arbitrary\nintensity (Hanle-Zeeman regime) and orientation, both deterministic and\nmicro-structured. Working within the framework of a rigorous PRD theoretical\napproach, we have developed a numerical code which solves the full non-LTE\nradiative transfer problem for polarized radiation, in one-dimensional models\nof the solar atmosphere, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and\nZeeman effects, as well as for PRD phenomena. After briefly discussing the\nrelevant equations, we describe the iterative method of solution of the problem\nand the numerical tools that we have developed and implemented. We finally\npresent some illustrative applications to two resonance lines that form at\ndifferent heights in the solar atmosphere, and provide a detailed physical\ninterpretation of the calculated Stokes profiles. We find that in strong\nresonance lines sensitive to PRD effects the magneto-optical terms of the\nStokes-vector transfer equation produce conspicuous U/I wing signals along with\na very interesting magnetic sensitivity in the wings of the linear polarization\nprofiles. We also show that the weak-field approximation has to be used with\ncaution when PRD effects are considered.\n", "  We show that an ansatz based on independent composite bosons [Phys. Rep. 463,\n215 (2008)] accurately describes the condensate fraction of molecular\nBose-Einstein condensates in ultracold Fermi gases. The entanglement between\nthe fermionic constituents of a single Feshbach molecule then governs the\nmany-particle statistics of the condensate, from the limit of strong\ninteraction to close to unitarity. This result strengthens the role of\nentanglement as the indispensable driver of composite-boson behavior. The\ncondensate fraction of fermion pairs at zero temperature that we compute\nmatches excellently previous results obtained by means of fixed-node diffusion\nMonte Carlo methods and the Bogoliubov depletion approximation. This paves the\nway towards the exploration of the BEC-BCS crossover physics in mixtures of\ncold Fermi gases with an arbitrary number of fermion pairs as well as the\nimplementation of Hong-Ou-Mandel-like interference experiments proposed within\ncoboson theory.\n", "  We study the effect of charged impurity screening on spin decoherence in bulk\n{\\it n}-type GaAs, and analyse in details the effect of the use of different\nBorn approximations applied to a linearized Thomas-Fermi screening theory. The\nspin relaxation times are calculated by ensemble Monte Carlo techniques,\nincluding electron-electron, electron-impurities, and electron-phonons\nscattering. We carefully choose a parameter region so that all the physical\napproximations hold, and, in particular, a Yukawa-type potential can be used to\ndescribe the screened Coulomb interaction and the Born series converges. Our\nresults show that including the second order Born approximation yields much\nshorter spin relaxation times compared to the commonly implemented first Born\napproximation: spin relaxation times may be reduced by hundreds of picoseconds,\nwith the first Born approximation overestimating results by 30% or more for a\nlarge region of parameters. Though our ensemble Monte Carlo simulations include\nelectron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, when considering low to\nintermediate carrier densities and $T > 50 $ $\\mathrm{K}$, but $T$ smaller than\nthe Fermi temperature, our results are in good agreement with Dyakonov-Perel\ntheory when this includes electron-impurity interactions only, which supports\nthis to be the most relevant scattering mechanism for bulk GaAs in this\nlow-intermediate temperature regime.\n", "  As an update to our previous calculation for spin $J\\leq2$, we present the\nangular moments for exclusive $\\overline{B} \\to X_J \\ell_1 \\ell_2$, where\n$\\ell_1$ is a charged massless lepton and $\\ell_2$ is a charged or neutral\nmassless lepton, and $X_J$ is a mesonic system with spin $J\\leq4$. The expected\napplications include higher resonances in the $[K\\pi]$ system in\n$\\overline{B}^0 \\to K^- \\pi^+ \\mu^- \\mu^+$ at LHCb in Run~II, and in the $[\\pi\n\\pi]$ system for $ \\overline{B} \\to \\pi \\pi \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ at Belle~II.\nFor the $J\\leq2$ case, we also provide a set of consistency relations among the\nmeasured moments observables and validate them against the latest measurements\nfrom LHCb.\n", "  We present a transportable optical clock (TOC) with $^{87}$Sr. Its complete\ncharacterization against a stationary lattice clock resulted in a systematic\nuncertainty of ${7.4 \\times 10^{-17}}$ which is currently limited by the\nstatistics of the determination of the residual lattice light shift. The\nmeasurements confirm that the systematic uncertainty is reduceable to below the\ndesign goal of $1 \\times 10^{-17}$. The instability of our TOC is $1.3 \\times\n10^{-15}/\\sqrt{(\\tau/s)}$. Both, the systematic uncertainty and the instability\nare to our best knowledge currently the best achieved with any type of\ntransportable clock. For autonomous operation the TOC is installed in an\nair-conditioned car-trailer. It is suitable for chronometric leveling with\nsub-meter resolution as well as intercontinental cross-linking of optical\nclocks, which is essential for a redefiniton of the SI second. In addition, the\nTOC will be used for high precision experiments for fundamental science that\nare commonly tied to precise frequency measurements and it is a first step to\nspace borne optical clocks\n", "  We present a generalization of the problem of pattern recognition to\narbitrary probabilistic models. This version deals with the problem of\nrecognizing an individual pattern among a family of different species or\nclasses of objects which obey probabilistic laws which do not comply with\nKolmogorov's axioms. We show that such a scenario accommodates many important\nexamples, and in particular, we provide a rigorous definition of the classical\nand the quantum pattern recognition problems, respectively. Our framework\nallows for the introduction of non-trivial correlations (as entanglement or\ndiscord) between the different species involved, opening the door to a new way\nof harnessing these physical resources for solving pattern recognition\nproblems. Finally, we present some examples and discuss the computational\ncomplexity of the quantum pattern recognition problem, showing that the most\nimportant quantum computation algorithms can be described as non-Kolmogorovian\npattern recognition problems.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the relations between the exact shape of\ninterparticle interactions in complex (dusty) plasmas and the dispersion\nrelation of the longitudinal collective mode. Several representative repulsive\npotentials, predicted previously theoretically, are chosen and the\ncorresponding dispersion relations are calculated using the quasi-crystalline\napproximation. Both weakly coupled and strongly coupled regimes are considered.\nIt is shown that the long-wavelength portions of the dispersion relations are\nsensitive to the long-range asymptote of the interaction potential. This can be\nused to discriminate between different interaction mechanisms operational in\ncomplex plasmas experimentally. Main requirements are briefly discussed.\n", "  Using numerical models for star clusters spanning a wide range in ages and\nmetallicities (Z) we study the masses of binary black holes (BBHs) produced\ndynamically and merging in the local universe ($z\\lesssim0.2$). After taking\ninto account cosmological constraints on star-formation rate and metallicity\nevolution, which realistically relate merger delay times obtained from models\nwith merger redshifts, we show here for the first time that while old,\nmetal-poor globular clusters can naturally produce merging BBHs with heavier\ncomponents, as observed in GW150914, lower-mass BBHs like GW151226 are easily\nformed dynamically in younger, higher-metallicity clusters.More specifically,\nwe show that the mass of GW151226 is well within $1\\sigma$ of the mass\ndistribution obtained from our models for clusters with Z/Zsun$\\gtrsim0.5$.\nIndeed dynamical formation of a system like GW151226 likely requires a cluster\nthat is younger and has a higher metallicity than typical Galactic globular\nclusters. The LVT151012 system, if real, could have been created in any cluster\nwith Z/Zsun$\\lesssim0.25$. On the other hand, GW150914 is more massive (beyond\n$1\\sigma$) than typical BBHs from even the lowest-metallicity (Z/Zsun=0.005)\nclusters we consider, but is within $2\\sigma$ of the intrinsic mass\ndistribution from our cluster models with Z/Zsun$\\lesssim0.05$; of course\ndetection biases also push the observed distributions towards higher masses.\n", "  Beam dump experiments have been used to search for new particles with null\nresults interpreted in terms of limits on masses $m_\\phi$ and coupling\nconstants $\\epsilon$. However these limits have been obtained by using\napproximations [including the Weizs\\\"{a}cker-Williams (WW) approximation] or\nMonte-Carlo simulations. We display methods, using a new scalar boson as an\nexample, to obtain the cross section and the resulting particle production\nnumbers without using approximations or Monte-Carlo simulations. We show that\nthe approximations cannot be used to obtain accurate values of cross sections.\nThe corresponding exclusion plots differ by substantial amounts when seen on a\nlinear scale. In the event of a discovery, we generate pseudodata (assuming\ngiven values of $m_\\phi$ and $\\epsilon$) in the currently allowed regions of\nparameter space. The use of approximations to analyze the pseudodata for the\nfuture experiments is shown to lead to considerable errors in determining the\nparameters. Furthermore, a new region of parameter space can be explored\nwithout using one of the common approximations, $m_\\phi\\gg m_e$. Our method can\nbe used as a consistency check for Monte-Carlo simulations.\n", "  The dynamics of a single magnetic Skyrmion in an atomic spin system under the\ninfluence of Scanning Tunneling Microscope is investigated by computer\nsimulations solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Two possible\nscenarios are described: manipulation with aid of a spin-polarized tunneling\ncurrent and by an electric field created by the scanning tunneling microscope.\nThe dynamics during the creation and annihilation process is studied and the\npossibility to move single Skyrmions is showed.\n", "  The longitudinal polarization of hyperons in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at high\nenergies depends on the longitudinal polarization of the quark produced at the\n$e^+e^-$ annihilation vertex whereas the spin alignment of vector mesons is\nindependent of it. They exhibit very different energy dependences. We use the\nlongitudinal polarization of Lambda hyperon and the spin alignment of $K^*$ as\nexamples and present numerical results of energy dependences. We present the\nresults at the leading twist with perturbative QCD evolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions at the leading order.\n", "  We study confining gauge theories with fermions vectorial under the SM that\nproduce a Higgs doublet as a Nambu-Goldstone boson. The vacuum misalignment\nrequired to break the electro-weak symmetry is induced by an elementary Higgs\ndoublet with Yukawa couplings to the new fermions. The physical Higgs is a\nlinear combination of elementary and composite Higgses while the SM fermions\nremain elementary. The full theory is renormalizable and the SM Yukawa\ncouplings are generated from the ones of the elementary Higgs allowing to\neliminate all flavour problems but with interesting effects for Electric Dipole\nMoments of SM particles. We also discuss how ideas on the relaxation of the\nelectro-weak scale could be realised within this framework.\n", "  Recent observations have suggested that there is water ice present on the\nsurfaces of 24 Themis and 1 Ceres. We present upper limits on the H$_2$O\nproduction rate on these bodies derived using a search for [OI]6300 Angstrom\nemission. For Themis, the water production is less than 4.5 $\\times$ 10$^{27}$\nmol s$^{-1}$, while for Ceres our derived upper limit is 4.6 $\\times$ 10$^{28}$\nmol s$^{-1}$. The derived limits imply a very low fraction of the surface area\nof each asteroid is active ($<$ 2 $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$), though this estimate\nvaries by as much as an order of magnitude depending on thermal properties of\nthe surface. This is much lower than seen for comets, which have active areas\nof 10$^{-2}$ - 10$^{-1}$. We discuss possible implications for our findings on\nthe nature of water ice on Themis and Ceres.\n", "  With the help of 3D AMR hydrodynamical simulations we aim at understanding\nG2's nature, recent evolution and fate in the coming years. By exploring the\npossible parameter space of the diffuse cloud scenario, we find that a starting\npoint within the disc of young stars is favoured by the observations, which may\nhint at G2 being the result of stellar wind interactions.\n", "  We study the evolution of G2 in a \\textit{Compact Source Scenario}, where G2\nis the outflow from a low-mass central star moving on the observed orbit. This\nis done through 3D AMR simulations of the hydrodynamic interaction of G2 with\nthe surrounding hot accretion flow. A comparison with observations is done by\nmeans of mock position-velocity (PV) diagrams. We found that a massive\n($\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{w}=5\\times 10^{-7} \\;M_{\\odot} \\; \\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) and slow\n($v_\\mathrm{w}=50 \\;\\mathrm{km\\; s^{-1}}$) outflow can reproduce G2's\nproperties. A faster outflow ($v_\\mathrm{w}=400 \\;\\mathrm{km\\; s^{-1}}$) might\nalso be able to explain the material that seems to follow G2 on the same orbit.\n", "  We consider exact and asymptotic solutions of the stationary cubic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLSE) on metric graphs. We focus on some basic example\ngraphs. The asymptotic solutions are obtained using the canonical perturbation\nformalism developed in our earlier paper \\cite{paper1}. For closed example\ngraphs (interval, ring, star graph, tadpole graph) we calculate spectral curves\nand show how the description of spectra reduces to known characteristic\nfunctions of linear quantum graphs in the low intensity limit. Analogously for\nopen examples we show how nonlinear scattering of stationary waves arises and\nhow it reduces to known linear scattering amplitudes at low intensities. In the\nshort-wave length asymptotics we discuss how genuine nonlinear effects such as\nmay be described using the leading order of canonical perturbation theory:\nbifurcation of spectral curves (and the corresponding solutions) in closed\ngraphs and multistability in open graphs.\n", "  The Moon migrated to $r_{\\leftmoon}\\simeq3.8\\times10^{10}$ cm over a\ncharacteristic time $r/v=10^{10}$ Gyr by tidal interaction with the Earth's\noceans at a present velocity of $v=3.8$ cm yr$^{-1}$. We derive scaling of\nglobal dissipation that covers the entire history over the past 4.52 Gyr.\nOff-resonance tidal interactions at relatively short tidal periods in the past\nreveal the need for scaling {with amplitude}. The global properties of the\ncomplex spatio-temporal dynamics and dissipation in broad spectrum ocean waves\nis modeled by damping $\\epsilon = h F/(2Q_0)$, where $h$ is the tidal wave\namplitude, $F$ is the tidal frequency, and $Q_0$ is the $Q$-factor at the\npresent time. It satisfies $Q_0\\simeq 14$ for consistency of migration time and\nage of the Moon consistent with observations for a near-resonance state today.\nIt shows a startingly fast eviction of the Moon from an unstable\nnear-synchronous orbit close to the Roche limit, probably in a protolunar disk.\nRapid spin down of the Earth from an intial $\\sim30\\%$ of break-up by the Moon\nfavored early formation of a clement global climate. Our theory suggests moons\nmay be similarly advantageous to potentially habitable exoplanets.\n", "  Analysis of multiwavelength light curves and VLBI observations of the blazar\nS5 0716+71 provides different and sometimes contradictory results for periods\nof long-term variability and kinematics of the parsec-scale jet components. We\npropose a model that consistently explains observable properties. Obtained\nresults and conclusions: 1) geometrical parameters of helix, pitch-angle, and\nlower limit on jet components Lorentz-factor, distance from the jet vertex to\nVLBA core at 15 GHz, 2) distinction in duration of long-term variability\nperiods for position angle of the inner jet ($PA_{in}$), optical and radio\nemission is caused by non-accelerated non-ballistic motion of jet component, 3)\nbecause different jet parts are responsible for observed flux and $PA_{in}$,\nmutual orientation of these jet parts relative to a plane containing the helix\naxis and the line of sight influences both the value of correlation coefficient\nbetween flux and $PA_{in}$ and the time interval within which this value is\nobserved, 4) non-ballistic motion of jet components, firstly, gives simple\nexplanation for difference apparent speeds of jet features in the inner and\nouter jet and secondly, forms conditions for existence of high apparent speed\nup to 37c.\n", "  The nature and origin of the Fermi bubbles detected in the inner Galaxy\nremain elusive. In this paper, we briefly discuss some recent theoretical and\nobservational developments, with a focus on the AGN jet model. Analogous to\nradio lobes observed in massive galaxies, the Fermi bubbles could be naturally\nproduced by a pair of opposing jets emanating nearly along the Galaxy's\nrotation axis from the Galactic center. Our two-fluid hydrodynamic simulations\nreproduce quite well the bubble location and shape, and interface instabilities\nat the bubble surface could be effectively suppressed by shear viscosity. We\nbriefly comment on some potential issues related to our model, which may lead\nto future progress.\n", "  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, the central 500 pc of the Milky Way)\ncontains the largest reservoir of high-density molecular gas in the Galaxy, but\nforms stars at a rate 10-100 times below commonly-used star formation\nrelations. We discuss recent efforts in understanding how the nearest galactic\nnucleus forms its stars. The latest models of the gas inflow, star formation,\nand feedback duty cycle reproduce the main observable features of the CMZ,\nshowing that star formation is episodic and that the CMZ currently resides at a\nstar formation minimum. Using orbital modelling, we derive the\nthree-dimensional geometry of the CMZ and show how the orbital dynamics and the\nstar formation potential of the gas are closely coupled. We discuss how this\ncoupling reveals the physics of star formation and feedback under the\nconditions seen in high-redshift galaxies, and promotes the formation of the\ndensest stellar clusters in the Galaxy.\n", "  We describe how to estimate the velocity dispersions of ultra diffuse\ngalaxies, UDGs, using a previously defined galaxy scaling relationship. The\nmethod is accurate for the two UDGs with spectroscopically measured\ndispersions, as well as for ultra compact galaxies, ultra faint galaxies, and\nstellar systems with little or no dark matter. This universality means that the\nrelationship can be applied without further knowledge or prejudice regarding\nthe structure of a galaxy. We then estimate the velocity dispersions of UDGs\ndrawn from two published samples and examine the distribution of total masses.\nWe find, in agreement with the previous studies of two individual UDGs, that\nthese systems are dark matter dominated systems, and that they span a range of\nat least $10^{10} < M_{200}/M_\\odot < 10^{12} $. These galaxies are not, as an\nentire class, either all dwarfs or all failed $L_*$ galaxies. Estimates of the\nvelocity dispersions can also help identify interesting subsets of UDGs, such\nas those that are likely to have the largest mass-to-light ratios, for\nsubsequent spectroscopic study.\n", "  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), usually referring to the inner 500 pc of\nthe Galaxy, contains a dozen of massive ($\\sim10^5$ $M_\\odot$) molecular\nclouds. Are these clouds going to actively form stars like Sgr B2? How are they\naffected by the extreme physical conditions in the CMZ, such as strong\nturbulence? Here we present a first step towards answering these questions.\nUsing high-sensitivity, high angular resolution radio and (sub)millimeter\nobservations, we studied deeply embedded star formation in six massive clouds\nin the CMZ, including the 20 and 50 km s$^{-1}$ clouds, Sgr B1 off (as known as\ndust ridge clouds e/f), Sgr C, Sgr D, and G0.253-0.016. The VLA water maser\nobservations suggest a population of deeply embedded protostellar candidates,\nmany of which are new detections. The SMA 1.3 mm continuum observations reveal\npeaks in dust emission associated with the masers, suggesting the existence of\ndense cores. While our findings confirm that clouds such as G0.253-0.016 lack\ninternal compact substructures and are quiescent in terms of star formation,\ntwo clouds (the 20 km s$^{-1}$ cloud and Sgr C) stand out with clusters of\nwater masers with associated dense cores which may suggest a population of\ndeeply embedded protostars at early evolutionary phases. Follow-up observations\nwith VLA and ALMA are necessary to confirm their protostellar nature.\n", "  We found a molecular cloud connecting from the outer region to the \"Galactic\nCenter Mini-spiral (GCMS)\" which is a bundle of the ionized gas streams\nadjacent to Sgr A*. The molecular cloud has a filamentary appearance which is\nprominent in the CS J=2-1 emission line and is continuously connected with the\nGCMS. The velocity of the molecular cloud is also continuously connected with\nthat of the ionized gas in the GCMS observed in the H42alpha recombination\nline. The morphological and kinematic relations suggest that the molecular\ncloud is falling from the outer region to the vicinity of Sgr A*, being\ndisrupted by the tidal shear of Sgr A* and ionized by UV emission from the\nCentral Cluster. We also found the SiO J=2-1 emission in the boundary area\nbetween the filamentary molecular cloud and the GCMS. There seems to exist\nshocked gas in the boundary area.\n", "  The environment within the inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way, known\nas the \"Central Molecular Zone\" (CMZ), harbours densities and pressures orders\nof magnitude higher than the Galactic Disc; akin to that at the peak of cosmic\nstar formation (Kruijssen & Longmore 2013). Previous studies have shown that\ncurrent theoretical star-formation models under-predict the observed level of\nstar-formation (SF) in the CMZ by an order of magnitude given the large\nreservoir of dense gas it contains. Here we explore potential reasons for this\napparent dearth of star formation activity.\n", "  Using halo effective field theory (EFT), an expansion in $R_{core}/R_{halo}$,\nwhere $R_{core}$ is the radius of the core and $R_{halo}$ the radius of the\nhalo nucleus, we calculate the charge and neutron form factors of the\ntwo-neutron halo nuclei $^{11}$Li, $^{14}$Be, and $^{22}$C to\nnext-to-leading-order (NLO) by treating them as an effective three-body system.\nFrom the form factors we extract the point charge and point matter radii,\ninter-neutron distance, and neutron opening angle. Agreement is found with\nexisting experimental extractions. Results are given for the point charge and\npoint matter radii for arbitrary neutron core scattering effective range,\n$\\rho_{cn}$, that can be used for predictions once $\\rho_{cn}$ is measured.\nEstimates for $\\rho_{cn}$ are also used to make NLO predictions. Finally, our\npoint charge radii are compared to other halo-EFT predictions, and setting the\ncore mass equal to the neutron mass our point charge radius is found to agree\nwith an analytical prediction in the unitary limit.\n", "  We derive an effective $Z_2$ gauge theory to describe the quantum kagome ice\n(QKI) state that has been observed by Carrasquilla $\\textit{et. al.}$ in Monte\nCarlo studies of the $S = 1/2$ kagome XYZ model in a Zeeman field. The\nnumerical results on QKI are consistent with, but do not confirm or rule out,\nthe hypothesis that it is a $Z_2$ spin liquid. Our effective theory allows us\nto explore this hypothesis and make a striking prediction for future numerical\nstudies, namely that symmetry-protected vison zero modes arise at lattice\ndisclination defects, leading to a Curie defect term in the spin\nsusceptibility, and a characteristic $(N_{dis} - 1) \\ln 2$ contribution to the\nentropy, where $N_{dis}$ is the number of disclinations. Only the $Z_2$ Ising\nsymmetry is required to protect the vison zero modes. This is remarkable\nbecause a unitary $Z_2$ symmetry cannot be responsible for symmetry-protected\ndegeneracies of local degrees of freedom. We also discuss other signatures of\nsymmetry fractionalization in the $Z_2$ spin liquid, and phase transitions out\nof the $Z_2$ spin liquid to nearby ordered phases.\n", "  Star formation in the Galactic disc is primarily controlled by gravity,\nturbulence, and magnetic fields. It is not clear that this also applies to star\nformation near the Galactic Centre. Here we determine the turbulence and star\nformation in the CMZ cloud G0.253+0.016. Using maps of 3mm dust emission and\nHNCO intensity-weighted velocity obtained with ALMA, we measure the\nvolume-density variance $\\sigma_{\\rho/\\rho_0} = 1.3 \\pm 0.5$ and turbulent Mach\nnumber $\\mathcal{M} = 11 \\pm 3$. Combining these with turbulence simulations to\nconstrain the plasma $\\beta = 0.34 \\pm 0.35$, we reconstruct the turbulence\ndriving parameter $b = 0.22 \\pm 0.12$ in G0.253+0.016. This low value of $b$\nindicates solenoidal (divergence-free) driving of the turbulence in\nG0.253+0.016. By contrast, typical clouds in the Milky Way disc and spiral arms\nhave a significant compressive (curl-free) driving component ($b > 0.4$). We\nspeculate that shear causes the solenoidal driving in G0.253+0.016 and show\nthat this may reduce the star formation rate by a factor of 7 compared to\nnearby clouds.\n", "  We have observed the Galactic Center 50km/s molecular cloud (50MC) with ALMA\nto search for filamentary structures. In the CS J=2-1 emission line channel\nmaps, we succeeded in identifying 27 molecular cloud filaments using the\nDisPerSE algorithm. This is the first attempt of \"filament-finding\" in the\nGalactic Center Region. These molecular cloud filaments strongly suggest that\nthe molecular cloud filaments are also ubiquitous in the molecular clouds of\nthe Galactic Center Region.\n", "  Quantum Measure Theory (QMT) is a generalization of quantum theory where\nphysical predictions are computed from a matrix known as \\emph{decoherence\nfunctional} (DF). Previous works have noted that, in its original formulation,\nQMT exhibits a problem with composability, since the composition of two\ndecoherence functionals is, in general, not a valid decoherence functional.\nThis does not occur when the DFs in question happen to be positive semidefinite\n(a condition known as strong positivity). In this paper, we study the concept\nof composability of DFs and its consequences for QMT. Firstly, we show that the\nproblem of composability is much deeper than originally envisaged, since, for\nany $n$, there exists a DF that can co-exist with $n-1$ copies of itself, but\nnot with $n$. Secondly, we prove that the set of strongly positive DFs cannot\nbe enlarged while remaining closed under composition. Furthermore, any closed\nset of DFs containing all quantum DFs can only contain strongly positive DFs.\n", "  The central molecular zone (CMZ) hosts some of the most massive and dense\nmolecular clouds and star clusters in the Galaxy, offering an important window\ninto star formation under extreme conditions. Star formation in this extreme\nenvironment may be closely linked to the 3-D distribution and orbital dynamics\nof the gas. Here I discuss how our new, accurate description of the $\\{l,b,v\\}$\nstructure of the CMZ is helping to constrain its 3-D geometry. I also present\nthe discovery of a highly-regular, corrugated velocity field located just\nupstream from the dust ridge molecular clouds (which include G0.253+0.016 and\nSgr B2). The extremes in this velocity field correlate with a series of massive\n($\\sim10^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$) cloud condensations. The corrugation wavelength\n($\\sim23$ pc) and cloud separation ($\\sim8$ pc) closely agree with the\npredicted Toomre ($\\sim17$ pc) and Jeans ($\\sim6$ pc) lengths, respectively. I\nconclude that gravitational instabilities are driving the formation of\nmolecular clouds within the Galactic Centre gas stream. Furthermore, I suggest\nthat these seeds are the historical analogues of the dust ridge molecular\nclouds - possible progenitors of some of the most massive and dense molecular\nclouds in the Galaxy. If our current best understanding for the 3-D geometry of\nthis system is confirmed, these clouds may pinpoint the beginning of an\nevolutionary sequence that can be followed, in time, from cloud condensation to\nstar formation.\n", "  We consider a cosmology in which dark matter and a quintessence scalar field\nresponsible for the acceleration of the Universe are allowed to interact.\nAllowing for both conformal and disformal couplings, we perform a global\nanalysis of the constraints on our model using Hubble parameter measurements,\nbaryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, and a Supernovae Type Ia\ndata set. We find that the additional disformal coupling relaxes the conformal\ncoupling constraints. Moreover we show that, at the background level, a\ndisformal interaction within the dark sector is preferred to both $\\Lambda$CDM\nand uncoupled quintessence, hence favouring interacting dark energy.\n", "  We present NH3 and H64a+H63a VLA observations of the Radio Arc region,\nincluding the M0.20-0.033 and G0.10-0.08 molecular clouds. These observations\nsuggest the two velocity components of M0.20-0.033 are physically connected in\nthe south. Additional ATCA observations suggest this connection is due to an\nexpanding shell in the molecular gas, with the centroid located near the\nQuintuplet cluster. The G0.10-0.08 molecular cloud has little radio continuum,\nstrong molecular emission, and abundant CH3OH masers, similar to a nearby\nmolecular cloud with no star formation: M0.25+0.01. These features detected in\nG0.10-0.08 suggest dense molecular gas with no signs of current star formation.\n", "  Critical branching is a theoretical interaction in-between simple units, such\nas neuronal elements of the human brain. Zhigalov, Kaplan, and Palva (2016,\nClin. Neurophysiol., 127(8), 2882-2889) revealed that neurofeedback flash\nstimulation locked to the phase of high-amplitude occipital alpha influences\nstimulus-locked occipital averages in the alpha-band. This feedback also\ninfluences the power scaling of long-range temporal correlations in alpha-band\namplitude fluctuations. Seemingly, neurofeedback influences critical branching\nalongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal activity and\nevoked responses. However, the causal relations between these neuronal\nlong-range temporal correlations, sustained attention, and any avalanche\ndynamics are called into question. Further, uncorrected concerns include false\ndiscovery rate and an objective mathematical error in the precedent (Palva et\nal., 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110(9), 3585-3590). An alternative set\nof illustrative mathematical principles offers a preliminary fit to the effects\nin the data. That is, neurofeedback influences the deterministic contribution\nto the single-trial event-related potentials, which each flash evokes,\nseparately from the oscillatory alpha gain that those flashes cause.\nAccordingly, distinct principles of this neurofeedback-related exponential\noccipital oscillatory alpha gain and deterministic event-related potential\ngeneration produce micro-behaviours with macroscale consequences: neurofeedback\ncausally influences power-scaling of long-range temporal correlations without\ncritical branching.\n", "  For Anderson Localization models with multifractal eigenvectors on disordered\nsamples containing $N$ sites, we analyze in a unified framework the\nconsequences for the statistical properties of the Green function. We focus in\nparticular on the imaginary part of the Green function at coinciding points\n$G^I_{xx}(E-i \\eta)$ and study the scaling with the size $N$ of the moments of\narbitrary indices $q$ when the broadening follows the scaling\n$\\eta=\\frac{c}{N^{\\delta}}$. For the standard scaling regime $\\delta=1$, we\nfind in the two limits $c \\ll 1$ and $c \\gg 1$ that the moments are governed by\nthe anomalous exponents $\\Delta(q)$ of individual eigenfunctions, without the\nassumption of strong correlations between the weights of consecutive\neigenstates at the same point. For the non-standard scaling regimes\n$0<\\delta<1$, we obtain that the imaginary Green function follows some\nFr\\'echet distribution in the typical region, while rare events are important\nto obtain the scaling of the moments. We describe the application to the case\nof Gaussian multifractality and to the case of linear multifractality.\n", "  Definitive determination of first order character of the magnetocaloric\nmagnetic transition remains elusive. Here we use a microcalorimetry technique\nin two modes of operation to determine the contributions to entropy change from\nlatent heat and heat capacity separately in an engineered set of La(Fe, Mn,\nSi)13 samples. We compare the properties extracted by this method with those\ndetermined using magnetometry and propose a model independent parameter that\nwould allow the degree of first order character to be defined across different\nfamilies of materials. The microcalorimetry method is sufficiently sensitive to\nallow observation of an additional peak feature in the low field heat capacity\nassociated with the presence of Mn in these samples. The feature is of magnetic\norigin but is insensitive to magnetic field, explicable in terms of\ninhomogeneous occupancy of Mn within the lattice resulting in antiferromagnetic\nordered Mn clusters.\n", "  Antibaryons are produced in our Galaxy in collisions of high energy cosmic\nrays with the interstellar medium and in old supernova remnants, and possibly,\nin exotic sources such as primordial black hole evaporation or dark matter\nannihilations and decays. The search for signals from exotic sources in\nantiproton data is hampered by large backgrounds from spallation which, within\ntheoretical errors, can solely account for the current data. Due to the higher\nenergy threshold for antideuteron production, which translates into a\nsuppression of the low energy flux from spallations, antideuteron searches have\nbeen proposed as a probe for exotic sources. We perform in this paper a\ncomprehensive analysis of the antideuteron fluxes at the Earth expected from\nknown and hypothetical sources in our Galaxy, and we calculate their maximal\nvalues consistent with current antiproton data from AMS-02. We find that\nsupernova remnants generate a negligible flux, whereas primordial black hole\nevaporation and dark matter annihilations or decays may dominate the total flux\nat low energies. On the other hand, we find that the detection of cosmic\nantideuterons would require, for the scenarios studied in this paper and\nassuming optimistic values of the coalescence momentum and solar modulation, an\nincrease of the experimental sensitivity compared to ongoing and planned\ninstruments by at least a factor of 2. Finally, we briefly comment on the\nprospects for antihelium-3 detection.\n", "  It has been indicated that low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are\naccelerating high-energy cosmic-ray (CR) protons in their radiatively\ninefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). If this is the case, Sagittarius A* (Sgr\nA*) should also be generating CR protons, because Sgr A* is a LLAGN. Based on\nthis scenario, we calculate a production rate of CR protons in Sgr A* and their\ndiffusion in the central molecular zone (CMZ) around Sgr A*. The CR protons\ndiffusing in the CMZ create gamma-rays through pp interaction. We show that the\ngamma-ray luminosity and spectrum are consistent with observations if Sgr A*\nwas active in the past.\n", "  We investigate the consequence of vector leptoquarks on the rare semileptonic\nlepton flavour violating decays of $B$ meson which are more promising and\neffective channels to probe the new physics signal. We constrain the resulting\nnew leptoquark parameter space by using the branching ratios of $B_{s, d} \\to\nl^+ l^-$, $K_L \\to l^+ l^-$ and $\\tau^- \\to l^- \\gamma$ processes. We estimate\nthe branching ratios of rare lepton flavour violating $B \\to K(\\pi)l_i^- l_j^+$\nprocesses using the constrained leptoquark couplings. We also compute the\nforward-backward asymmetries and the lepton non-universality parameters of the\nLFV decays in the vector leptoquark model. Furthermore, we study the effect of\nvector leptoquark on $(g-2)_\\mu$ anomaly.\n", "  We measure temperature-dependent one-photon and two-photon induced\nphotoluminescence from (CH3NH3)PbBr3 single crystals cleaved in ultrahigh\nvacuum. An approach is presented to extract absorption spectra from a\ncomparison of both measurements. Cleaved crystals exhibit broad\nphotoluminescence spectra. We identify the direct optical band gap of 2.31 eV.\nBelow 200 K the band gap increases with temperature, and it decreases at\nelevated temperature, as described by the Bose-Einstein model. An excitonic\ntransition is found 22 meV below the band gap at temperatures <200 K. Defect\nemission occurs at photon energies <2.16 eV. In addition, we observe a\ntransition at 2.25 eV (2.22 eV) in the orthorhombic (tetragonal and cubic)\nphase. Below 200 K, the associated exciton binding energy is also 22 meV, and\nthe transition redshifts at higher temperature. The binding energy of the\nexciton related to the direct band gap, in contrast, decreases in the cubic\nphase. High-energy emission from free carriers is observed with higher\nintensity than reported in earlier studies. It disappears after exposing the\ncrystals to air.\n", "  An appropriate design of wavefront will enable light fields propagating along\narbitrary trajectories thus forming accelerating beams in free space. Previous\nways of designing such accelerating beams mainly rely on caustic methods, which\nstart from diffraction integrals and only deal with two-dimensional fields.\nHere we introduce a new perspective to construct accelerating beams in phase\nspace by designing the corresponding Wigner distribution function (WDF). We\nfind such a WDF-based method is capable of providing both the initial field\ndistribution and the angular spectrum in need by projecting the WDF into the\nreal space and the Fourier space respectively. Moreover, this approach applies\nto the construction of both two- and three-dimensional fields, greatly\ngeneralizing previous caustic methods. It may therefore open up a new route to\nconstruct highly-tailored accelerating beams and facilitate applications\nranging from particle manipulation and trapping to optical routing as well as\nmaterial processing.\n", "  The decays $B^+\\rightarrow J/\\psi 3\\pi^+ 2\\pi^-$ and $B^+\\rightarrow \\psi(2S)\n\\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^-$ are observed for the first time using a data sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3.0fb^{-1}$, collected by the\nLHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energies of 7\nand 8 TeV. The branching fractions relative to that of $B^+ \\rightarrow\n\\psi(2S)K^+$ are measured to be \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  \\frac {\\mathcal{B}\\left(B^+\\rightarrow J/\\psi 3\\pi^+ 2\\pi^- \\right)}\n  {\\mathcal{B}\\left(B^+ \\rightarrow \\psi(2S)K^+ \\right)}\n  & = &\n  \\left(1.88\\pm0.17\\pm0.09\\right)\\times10^{-2},\n  \\frac {\\mathcal{B}\\left(B^+\\rightarrow \\psi(2S) \\pi^+\\pi^+\\pi^- \\right)}\n  {\\mathcal{B}\\left(B^+ \\rightarrow \\psi(2S)K^+ \\right)} & = &\n  \\left(3.04\\pm0.50\\pm0.26\\right)\\times10^{-2}, \\end{eqnarray*} where the first\nuncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic.\n", "  We infer the absolute time dependence of kinematic gas temperature along a\nproposed orbit of molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the\nGalactic Center (GC). Ammonia gas temperature maps are one of the results of\nthe \"Survey of Water and Ammonia in the Galactic Center\" (SWAG, PI: J. Ott);\nthe dynamical model of molecular clouds in the CMZ was taken from Kruijssen et\nal. (2015). We find that gas temperatures increase as a function of time in\nboth regimes before and after the cloud passes pericenter on its orbit in the\nGC potential. This is consistent with the recent proposal that pericenter\npassage triggers gravitational collapse. Other investigated quantities (line\nwidth, column density, opacity) show no strong sign of time dependence but are\nlikely dominated by cloud-to-cloud variations.\n", "  Many coordination phenomena are based on a synchronisation process, whose\nglobal behaviour emerges from the interactions among the individual parts.\nOften in Nature, such self-organising mechanism allows the system to behave as\na whole and thus grounding its very first existence, or expected functioning,\non such process. There are however cases where synchronisation acts against the\nstability of the system; for instance in the case of engineered structures,\nresonances among sub parts can destabilise the whole system. In this Letter we\npropose an innovative control method to tackle the synchronisation process\nbased on the use of the Hamiltonian control theory, by adding a small control\nterm to the system we are able to impede the onset of the synchronisation. We\npresent our results on the paradigmatic Kuramoto model but the applicability\ndomain is far more large.\n", "  We review recent developments in the field of string cosmology with\nparticular emphasis on open problems having to do mainly with geometric\nasymptotics and singularities. We discuss outstanding issues in a variety of\ncurrently popular themes, such as tree-level string cosmology asymptotics,\nhigher-order string correction effects, M-theory cosmology, braneworlds, and\nfinally ambient cosmology.\n", "  The exclusive charmonium production process in $\\bar{p}p$ annihilation with\nan associated $\\pi^0$ meson $\\bar{p}p\\to J/\\psi\\pi^0$ is studied in the\nframework of QCD collinear factorization. The feasibility of measuring this\nreaction through the $J/\\psi\\to e^+e^-$ decay channel with the PANDA\n(AntiProton ANnihilation at DArmstadt) experiment is investigated. Simulations\non signal reconstruction efficiency as well as the background rejection from\nvarious sources including the $\\bar{p}p\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\pi^0$ and $\\bar{p}p\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^0\\pi^0$ reactions are performed with PandaRoot, the simulation and\nanalysis software framework of the PANDA experiment. It is shown that the\nmeasurement can be done at PANDA with significant constraining power under the\nassumption of an integrated luminosity attainable in four to five months of\ndata taking at the maximum design luminosity.\n", "  The late-type stellar population in the Galactic Center was first predicted\nto reside in a dynamically relaxed cusp (power law slope ranging from 3/2 to\n7/4). However, observations - which rely on models to correct for projection\neffects - have suggested a flat distribution instead. The need for this\ncorrection is due to the lack of information regarding the line-of-sight\ndistances. With a two decade long baseline in astrometric measurements, we are\nnow able to measure significant projected radial accelerations, six of which\nare newly reported here, that directly constrain line-of-sight distances. Here\nwe present a statistical approach to take advantage of this information and\nmore accurately constrain the shape of the radial density profile of the\nlate-type stellar population in the Galactic Center.\n", "  We present constraints on the variability and binarity of young stars in the\ncentral 10 arcseconds (~0.4 pc) of the Milky Way Galactic Center (GC) using\nKeck Adaptive Optics data over a 12 year baseline. Given our experiment's\nphotometric uncertainties, at least 36% of our sample's known early-type stars\nare variable. We identified eclipsing binary systems by searching for periodic\nvariability. In our sample of spectroscopically confirmed and likely early-type\nstars, we detected the two previously discovered GC eclipsing binary systems.\nWe derived the likely binary fraction of main sequence, early-type stars at the\nGC via Monte Carlo simulations of eclipsing binary systems, and find that it is\nat least 32% with 90% confidence.\n", "  Small-crater counts on Mars light-toned sedimentary rock are often\ninconsistent with any isochron; these data are usually plotted then ignored. We\nshow (using an 18-HiRISE-image, >10^4 crater dataset) that these non-isochron\ncrater counts are often well-fit by a model where crater production is balanced\nby crater obliteration via steady exhumation. For these regions, we fit erosion\nrates. We infer that Mars light-toned sedimentary rocks typically erode at\n~10^2 nm/yr, when averaged over 10 km^2 scales and 10^7-10^8 yr timescales.\nCrater-based erosion-rate determination is consistent with independent\ntechniques, but can be applied to nearly all light-toned sedimentary rocks on\nMars. Erosion is swift enough that radiolysis cannot destroy complex organic\nmatter at some locations (e.g. paleolake deposits at SW Melas), but radiolysis\nis a severe problem at other locations (e.g. Oxia Planum). The data suggest\nthat the relief of the Valles Marineris mounds is currently being reduced by\nwind erosion, and that dust production on Mars <3 Gya greatly exceeds the\nmodern reservoir of mobile dust.\n", "  We demonstrate the nonlinear frequency conversion of ferromagnetic resonance\n(FMR) frequency by optically excited elastic waves in a thin metallic film on\ndielectric substrates. Time-resolved probing of the magnetization directly\nwitnesses magneto-elastically driven second harmonic generation, sum- and\ndifference frequency mixing from two distinct frequencies, as well as\nparametric downconversion of each individual drive frequency. Starting from the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations, we derive an analytical equation of an\nelastically driven nonlinear parametric oscillator and show that frequency\nmixing is dominated by the parametric modulation of FMR frequency.\n", "  Due to its proximity, the Milky Way nuclear star cluster provides us with a\nwealth of data not available in other galactic nuclei. In particular, with\nadaptive optics, we can observe the detailed properties of individual stars,\nwhich can offer insight into the origin and evolution of the cluster. We\nsummarize work on the central parsec of the Galactic center based on imaging\nand spectroscopic observations at the Keck and Gemini telescopes. These\nobservations include stellar positions in two dimension and the velocity in\nthree dimensions. Spectroscopic observations also enable measurements of the\nphysical properties of individual stars, such as the spectral type and in some\ncases the effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity. We present a\nreview of our latest measurements of the density profiles and luminosity\nfunctions of the young and old stars in this region. These observations show a\ncomplex stellar population with a young (4-6 Myr) compact star cluster in the\ncentral 0.5 pc embedded in an older and much more massive nuclear star cluster.\nSurprisingly, the old late-type giants do not show a cusp profile as long been\nexpected from theoretical work. The solution to the missing cusp problem may\noffer us insight into the dynamical evolution of the cluster. Finally, we also\ndiscuss recent work on the metallicity of stars in this region and how they\nmight be used to trace their origin. The nuclear star cluster shows a large\nvariation in metallicity ([M/Fe]). The majority of the stars have higher than\nsolar metallicity, with about 6\\% having [M/Fe] $< -0.5$. These observations\nindicate that the NSC was not built from the globular clusters that we see\ntoday. The formation of the nuclear star cluster is more likely from the inward\nmigration of gas originating in the disk of the Milky Way.\n", "  We provide a clear energetic insight into the catastrophic nature of the\nso-called creasing and pull-in instabilities in soft electro-active elastomers.\nThese phenomena are ubiquitous for thin electro-elastic plates and are a major\nobstacle to the development of giant actuators; yet they are not completely\nunderstood nor modelled accurately. Here, in complete agreement with\nexperiments, we give a simple formula to predict the voltage thresholds for\nthese instability patterns and model their shape, and show that equilibrium is\nimpossible beyond their onset. Our analysis is fully analytical, does not\nrequire finite element simulations, and can be extended to include pre-stretch\nand to encompass any material behaviour.\n", "  The analysis of the quantum Hall response of a small system of ultracold\nbosonic atoms through the variation of its Hall resistivity against the applied\ngauge magnetic field, provides a powerful method to unmask its strongly\ncorrelated states in a quite eshaustive way. Within a fixed range of values of\nthe magnetic field in the lowest Landau-level regime, where the resistivity\ndisplays two successive plateaux, we identify the implied states as the\nPfaffian and the state with filling factor \\nu=2/3 in the thermodynamic limit.\nWe fix the conditions to have good observability.\n", "  One of the keys behind the success of the modern semiconductor technology has\nbeen the ion implantation of silicon, which allows its electronic properties to\nbe tailored. For similar purposes, heteroatoms have been introduced into carbon\nnanomaterials both during growth and using post-growth methods. However, due to\nthe nature of the samples, it has been challenging to determine whether the\nheteroatoms have been incorporated into the lattice as intended, with direct\nobservations so far being limited to N and B dopants, and incidental Si\nimpurities. Furthermore, ion implantation of these materials is more\nchallenging due to the requirement of very low ion energies and atomically\nclean surfaces. Here, we provide the first atomic-resolution imaging and\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) evidence of phosphorus atoms\nincorporated into the graphene lattice by low-energy ion irradiation. The\nmeasured P L-edge response of an single-atom EELS spectrum map shows excellent\nagreement with an ab initio spectrum simulation, conclusively identifying the P\nin a buckled substitutional configuration. Our results demonstrate the\nviability of phosphorus as a lattice dopant in $sp^2$-bonded carbon structures\nand provide its unmistakeable fingerprint for further studies.\n", "  The vertical flow structure in the galactic center region remains poorly\nunderstood. We analyzed the MHD simulation data by Suzuki et al. (2015) for\nbetter understanding. As a result, we found the fast downflows with a speed of\n~100 km/s near the foot-points of magnetic loops. These downflows are flowing\nalong a magnetic field line and accelerated by the gravity. The direction of\nthe fast flows is changed by the magnetic loop geometry, as it moves. As a\nresult, not only vertical motions but also azimuthal and radial motions are\nexcited. This feature could be relevant to the observed high velocity\ndispersion in the position-velocity diagram.\n", "  In quantum theory it is possible to explain time, and dynamics, in terms of\nentanglement. This is the timeless approach to time, which assumes that the\nuniverse is in a stationary state, where two non-interacting subsystems, the\nclock and the rest, are entangled. As a consequence, by choosing a suitable\nobservable of the clock, the relative state of the rest of the universe evolves\nunitarily with respect to the variable labelling the clock observable's\neigenstates, which is then interpreted as time. This model for an evolution\nwithout evolution (Page and Wootters, 1983), albeit elegant, has never been\ndeveloped further, because it was criticised for generating severe ambiguities\nin the dynamics of the rest of the universe. In this paper we show that there\nare no such ambiguities, we also update the model, making it amenable to\npossible new applications.\n", "  The effect of a slow noise in non-diagonal matrix element, J(t), that\ndescribes the diabatic level coupling, on the probability of the Landau-Zener\ntransition is studied. For slow noise, the correlation time, \\tau_c, of J(t) is\nmuch longer than the characteristic time of the transition. Existing theory for\nthis case suggests that the average transition probability is the result of\naveraging of the conventional Landau-Zener probability, calculated for a given\nconstant J, over the distribution of J. We calculate a finite-\\tau_c correction\nto this classical result. Our main finding is that this correction is dominated\nby sparse realizations of noise for which J(t) passes through zero within a\nnarrow time interval near the level crossing. Two models of noise, random\ntelegraph noise and gaussian noise, are considered. Naturally, in both models\nthe average probability of transition decreases upon decreasing \\tau_c. For\ngaussian noise we identify two domains of this fall-off with specific\ndependencies of average transition probability on \\tau_c.\n", "  Space plasmas are dominated by the presence of large-amplitude waves,\nlarge-scale inhomogeneities, kinetic effects and turbulence. Beside the\nhomogeneous turbulence, generation of small scale fluctuations can take place\nalso in other realistic configurations, namely, when perturbations superpose to\nan inhomogeneous background magnetic field. When an Alfv\\'en wave propagates in\na medium where the Alfv\\'en speed varies in a direction transverse to the mean\nfield, it undergoes phase-mixing, which progressively bends wavefronts,\ngenerating small scales in the transverse direction. As soon as transverse\nscales get of the order of the proton inertial length $d_p$, kinetic Alfv\\'en\nwaves (KAWs) are naturally generated. KAWs belong to the branch of Alfv\\'en\nwaves and propagate nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, at\nscales close to $d_p$. Many numerical, observational and theoretical works have\nsuggested that these fluctuations may play a determinant role in the\ndevelopment of the solar-wind turbulent cascade. In the present paper, the\ngeneration of large amplitude KAW fluctuations in inhomogeneous background and\ntheir effect on the protons have been investigated by means of hybrid\nVlasov-Maxwell direct numerical simulations. Imposing a pressure balanced\nmagnetic shear, the kinetic dynamics of protons has been investigated by\nvarying both the magnetic configuration and the amplitude of the initial\nperturbations. Of interest here is the transition from quasi-linear to\nturbulent regimes, focusing, in particular, on the development of important\nnon-Maxwellian features in the proton distribution function driven by KAW\nfluctuations.\n", "  The Telescope Array (TA) shows a 20$^{\\circ}$ hotspot as well as an excess of\nUHECRs above 50~EeV when compared with the Auger spectrum. We consider the\npossibility that both the TA excess and hotspot are due to a dominant source in\nthe Northern sky. We carry out detailed simulations of UHECR propagation in\nboth the intergalactic medium and the Galaxy, using different values for the\nintergalactic magnetic field. We consider two general classes of sources:\ntransients and steady, adopting a mixed UHECR composition that is consistent\nwith the one found by Auger. The spatial location of the sources is draw\nrandomly. We generate Auger-like and TA-like data sets from which we determine\nthe spectrum, the sky maps and the level of anisotropy. We find that, while\nsteady sources are favored over transients, it is unlikely to account for all\nthe currently available observational data. While we reproduce fairly well the\nAuger spectrum for the vast majority of the simulated data sets, most of the\nsimulated data sets with a spectrum compatible with that of TA (at most a few\npercent depending on density model tested) show a much stronger anisotropy than\nthe one observed. We find that the rare cases in which both the spectrum and\nthe anisotropy are consistent require a steady source within $\\sim 10$ Mpc, to\naccount for the flux excess, and a strong extragalactic magnetic field $\\sim\n10$ nG, to reduce the excessive anisotropy.\n", "  We theoretically study the propagation and storage of a classical field in a\n$\\Lambda$-type atomic medium using coherent population oscillations (CPOs). We\nshow that the propagation eigenmodes strongly relate to the different CPO modes\nof the system. Light storage in such modes is discussed by introducing a\n\"populariton\" quantity, a mixture of populations and field, by analogy to the\ndark state polariton used in the context of electromagnetically induced\ntransparency light storage protocol. As experimentally shown, this memory\nrelies on populations and is then - by contrast with usual Raman coherence\noptical storage protocols - robust to dephasing effects.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a charged massive fermionic quantum field in the\nidealized cosmic string spacetime and in the presence of a magnetic field\nconfined in a cylindrical tube of finite radius. Three distinct configurations\nfor the magnetic fields are taken into account: (i) a cylindrical shell of\nradius $a$, (ii) a magnetic field proportional to $1/r$ and (iii) a constant\nmagnetic field. In these three cases, the axis of the infinitely long tube of\nradius $a$ coincides with the cosmic string. Our main objectives in this paper\nare to analyze the fermionic condensat (FC) e and the vacuum expectation value\n(VEV) of the fermionic energy-momentum tensor. In order to do that, we\nexplicitly construct the complete set of normalized wave-functions for each\nconfiguration of magnetic field. We show that in the region outside the tube,\nthe FC and the VEV of the energy-momentum tensor are decomposed into two parts:\nthe first ones correspond to the zero-thickness magnetic flux contributions,\nand the seconds are induced by the non-trivial structure of the magnetic field,\nnamed core-induced contributions. The latter present specific forms depending\non the magnetic field configuration considered. We also show that the VEV of\nthe energy-momentum tensor is diagonal, obeys the conservation condition and\nits trace is expressed in terms of the fermionic condensate. The zero-thickness\ncontributions to the FC and VEV of the energy-momentum tensor, depend only on\nthe fractional part of the ration of the magnetic flux inside the tube by the\nquantum one. As to the core-induced contributions they depend on the total\nmagnetic flux inside the tube, and consequently, in general, are not a periodic\nfunction of the magnetic flux.\n", "  We rigorously analyze the low-temperature properties of homogeneous\nthree-dimensional two-component Bose mixture with dipole-dipole interaction.\nFor such a system the effective hydrodynamic action that governs the behavior\nof low-energy excitations is derived. The infrared structure of the exact\nsingle-particle Green's functions is obtained in terms of macroscopic\nparameters, namely the inverse compressibility and the superfluid density\nmatrices. Within one-loop approximation we calculate the anisotropic superfluid\nand condensate densities and give the beyond mean-field stability condition for\nthe binary dipolar Bose gas. A brief variational derivation of the coupled\nequations that describe macroscopic hydrodynamics of the system in the external\nnon-uniform potential at zero temperature is presented.\n", "  SWAG (\"Survey of Water and Ammonia in the Galactic Center\") is a multi-line\ninterferometric survey toward the Center of the Milky Way conducted with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array. The survey region spans the entire ~400pc\nCentral Molecular Zone and comprises ~42 spectral lines at pc spatial and\nsub-km/s spectral resolution. In addition, we deeply map continuum intensity,\nspectral index, and polarization at the frequencies where synchrotron,\nfree-free, and thermal dust sources emit. The observed spectral lines include\nmany transitions of ammonia, which we use to construct maps of molecular gas\ntemperature, opacity and gas formation temperature (see poster by Nico Krieger\net al., this volume). Water masers pinpoint the sites of active star formation\nand other lines are good tracers for density, radiation field, shocks, and\nionization. This extremely rich survey forms a perfect basis to construct maps\nof the physical parameters of the gas in this extreme environment.\n", "  Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation are powerful tools to study the\nevolution of galaxy population in a cosmological context. However, most models\nover-predict the number of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts and the color of\nmodel galaxies are not right in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies are\ntoo red and centrals are too blue. The recent version of the L-Galaxies model\nby Henriques et al.(H15) is a step forward to solve these problems by\nreproducing the evolution of stellar mass function and the overall fraction of\nred galaxies. In this paper we compare the two model predictions of L-Galaxies\n(the other is Guo et al. , G13) to the SDSS data in detail. We find that in the\nH15 model the red fraction of central galaxies now agrees with the data due to\ntheir implementation of strong AGN feedback, but the stellar mass of centrals\nin massive haloes is now slightly lower than the data. For satellite galaxies,\nthe red fraction of low-mass galaxies ($\\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10$) also agrees\nwith the data, but the color of massive satellites ($10 < \\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot}\n< 11$) is slightly bluer. The correct color of centrals and bluer color of\nmassive satellites indicate that the quenching in massive satellites are not\nstrong enough. We also find that there are too much red spirals and less\nbulge-dominated galaxies in both H15 and G13 models. Our results suggest that\nadditional mechanisms, such as more minor merger or disk instability, are\nneeded to slightly increase the stellar mass of central galaxy in massive\ngalaxies, mainly in the bulge component, and the bulge dominated galaxy will be\nquenched or then be quenched by any other mechanisms.\n", "  The inner few hundred parsecs of the Milky Way, the Central Molecular Zone\n(CMZ), is our closest laboratory for understanding star formation in the\nextreme environments (hot, dense, turbulent gas) that once dominated the\nuniverse. We present an update on the first large-area survey to expose the\nsites of star formation across the CMZ at high-resolution in submillimeter\nwavelengths: the CMZoom survey with the Submillimeter Array (SMA). We identify\nthe locations of dense cores and search for signatures of embedded star\nformation. CMZoom is a three-year survey in its final year and is mapping out\nthe highest column density regions of the CMZ in dust continuum and a variety\nof spectral lines around 1.3 mm. CMZoom combines SMA compact and subcompact\nconfigurations with single-dish data from BGPS and the APEX telescope,\nachieving an angular resolution of about 4\" (0.2 pc) and good image fidelity up\nto large spatial scales.\n", "  In this work, the two-photon-exchange (TPE) effects in the unpolarized $\\mu\np$ scattering are discussed within the hadronic model where the intermediate\nstates $N,\\Delta$ and $\\sigma$ are considered. The contribution from the $N$\nintermediate is close to the results given by Ref. \\cite{Tomalak2014} at the\nsmall $Q$ and there is a sizeable difference when $Q>0.25$GeV (where $Q^2$ is\nthe four momentum transfer). The contributions from the $\\Delta$ and the\n$\\sigma$ intermediate states are much smaller than that from the $N$\nintermediate at the small $Q$. In the kinematic region with $k_i\\subseteq\n[0.01,0.3]$ GeV and $Q \\leq0.4$GeV (where $k_i$ is the three momentum of\ninitial muon at Lab frame), a naive expression for the TPE contributions is\ngiven, which can be used directly for other analysis.\n", "  We establish two complementarity relations for the relative entropy of\ncoherence in quantum information processing, i.e., quantum dense coding and\nteleportation. We first give an uncertaintylike expression relating local\nquantum coherence to the capacity of optimal dense coding for bipartite system.\nThe relation can also be applied to the case of dense coding by using unital\nmemoryless noisy quantum channels. Further, the relation between local quantum\ncoherence and teleportation fidelity for two-qubit system is given.\n", "  We retrieve vertical and meridional variations of methane mole fraction in\nTitan's lower troposphere by re-analyzing near-infrared ground-based\nobservations from 17 July 2014 UT (Adamkovics et al., 2016). We generate\nsynthetic spectra using atmospheric methane profiles that do not contain\nsupersaturation or discontinuities to fit the observations, and thereby\nretrieve minimum saturation altitudes and corresponding specific humidities in\nthe boundary layer. We relate these in turn to surface-level relative\nhumidities using independent surface temperature measurements. We also compare\nour results with general circulation model simulations to interpret and\nconstrain the relationship between humidities and surface liquids. The results\nshow that Titan's lower troposphere is undersaturated at latitudes south of\n60N, consistent with a dry surface there, but increases in humidity toward the\nnorth pole indicate appreciable surface liquid coverage. While our observations\nare consistent with considerably more liquid methane existing at the north pole\nthan is present in observed lakes, a degeneracy between low-level methane and\nhaze leads to substantial uncertainty in determining the extent of the source\nregion.\n", "  The kinetic study of plasma sheaths is critical, among other things, to\nunderstand the deposition of heat on walls, the effect of sputtering, and\ncontamination of the plasma with detrimental impurities. The plasma sheath also\nprovides a boundary condition and can often have a significant global impact on\nthe bulk plasma. In this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are\nperformed with the continuum code, Gkeyll, that directly solves the\nVlasov-Poisson/Maxwell equations. The code uses a novel version of the\nfinite-element discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme that conserves energy in the\ncontinuous-time limit. The electrostatic field is computed using the Poisson\nequation. Ionization and scattering collisions are included, however, surface\neffects are neglected. The aim of this work is to introduce the\ncontinuum-kinetic method and compare its results to those obtained from an\nalready established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in Gkeyll.\nNovel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without\nspecifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at\nthe wall. The work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid\nresults are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain\nregimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the\nplasma boundary. There are differences in the electrostatic potential between\nthe fluid and kinetic results. Further, the direct solutions of the\ndistribution function presented here highlight the non-Maxwellian distribution\nof electrons in the sheath, emphasizing the need for a kinetic model.\n", "  We study the intrinsic transport anisotropy and fermiology of the quasi\none-dimensional superconductor Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$. Below $T^*=20$ K we\ndetect a thermodynamic phase transition that predominantly affects the\nconductivity perpendicular to the quasi one-dimensional chains, consistent with\na thermodynamic transition related to the presence of charge order that\nprecedes superconductivity. Remarkably the Fermi surface pockets detected by de\nHaas-van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations are unaffected by this transition,\nsuggesting that the ordered state does not break any translational symmetries\nbut rather alters the scattering of the quasiparticles themselves.\n", "  We calculate superconducting gaps and quasiparticle density of states of\nYNi$_2$B$_2$C in the framework of the density functional theory for\nsuperconductors to investigate the origin of a highly anisotropic\nsuperconducting gaps in this material. Calculated phonon frequencies, the\nquasiparticle density of states, and the transition temperature show good\nagreement with experimental results. From our calculation of superconducting\ngaps and orbital character analysis, we establish that the orbital character\nvariation of the Fermi surface is the key factor of the anisotropic gap. Since\nthe electronic states that consist of mainly Ni $3 d$ orbitals couple weakly\nwith phonons, the superconducting gap function is suppressed for the\ncorresponding states, which results in the anisotropy observed in the\nexperiments. These results are hints to increase the transition temperature of\nmaterials in the borocarbide family.\n", "  Thermonuclear X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars power brief but\nstrong irradiation of their surroundings, providing a unique way to study\naccretion physics. We analyze MAXI/GSC and Swift/XRT spectra of a day-long\nflash observed from IGR J17062-6143 in 2015. It is a rare case of recurring\nbursts at a low accretion luminosity of 0.15% Eddington. Spectra from MAXI,\nChandra, and NuSTAR observations taken between the 2015 burst and the previous\none in 2012 are used to determine the accretion column. We find it to be\nconsistent with the burst ignition column of 5x10^10 g cm^-2, which indicates\nthat it is likely powered by burning in a deep helium layer. The burst flux is\nobserved for over a day, and decays as a straight power law: F~t^-1.15. The\nburst and persistent spectra are well described by thermal emission from the\nneutron star, Comptonization of this emission in a hot optically thin medium\nsurrounding the star, and reflection off the photoionized accretion disk. At\nthe burst peak, the Comptonized component disappears, when the burst may\ndissipate the Comptonizing gas, and it returns in the burst tail. The\nreflection signal suggests that the inner disk is truncated at ~100\ngravitational radii before the burst, but may move closer to the star during\nthe burst. At the end of the burst, the flux drops below the burst cooling\ntrend for 2 days, before returning to the pre-burst level.\n", "  One-dimensional (1D) quantum systems, which are predicted to exhibit novel\nstates of matter in theory, have been elusive in experiment. Here we report a\nsuperlattice method of creating artificial 1D quantum stripes, which offers\ndimensional tunability from two- to one-dimensions. As a model system, we have\nfabricated 1D iridium (Ir) stripes using a-axis oriented superlattices of a\nrelativistic Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 and a wide bandgap insulator LaSrGaO4, both\nof which are crystals with layered structure. In addition to the successful\nformation of 1D Ir-stripe structure, we have observed 1D quantum-confined\nelectronic states from optical spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray\nscattering. Since this 1D superlattice approach can be applied to a wide range\nof layered materials, it opens a new era of 1D science.\n", "  We study $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric QED in three dimensions, on a\nthree-sphere, with 2N massive hypermultiplets and a Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter.\nWe identify the exact partition function of the theory with a conical (Mehler)\nfunction. This implies a number of analytical formulas, including a recurrence\nrelation and a second-order differential equation, associated with an\nintegrable system. In the large N limit, the theory undergoes a second-order\nphase transition on a critical line in the parameter space. We discuss the\ncritical behavior and compute the two-point correlation function of a gauge\ninvariant mass operator, which is shown to diverge as one approaches\ncriticality from the subcritical phase. Finally, we comment on the asymptotic\n1/N expansion and on mirror symmetry.\n", "  In pulsar timing, timing residuals are the differences between the observed\ntimes of arrival and the predictions from the timing model. A comprehensive\ntiming model will produce featureless residuals, which are presumably composed\nof dominating noise and weak physical effects excluded from the timing model\n(e.g. gravitational waves). In order to apply the optimal statistical methods\nfor detecting the weak gravitational wave signals, we need to know the\nstatistical properties of the noise components in the residuals. In this paper\nwe utilize a variety of non-parametric statistical tests to analyze the\nwhiteness and Gaussianity of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for\nGravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 5-year timing data which are obtained from the\nArecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Telescope from 2005 to 2010 (Demorest et\nal. 2013). We find that most of the data are consistent with white noise; Many\ndata deviate from Gaussianity at different levels, nevertheless, removing\noutliers in some pulsars will mitigate the deviations.\n", "  The low spin rates measured for solar-type stars at an age of a few Myr (~10%\nof the break-up velocity) indicate that some mechanism of angular momentum\nregulation must be at play in the early pre-main sequence. We characterize the\nrotation properties for members of the region NGC 2264 (~3 Myr), and\ninvestigate the accretion-rotation connection at an age where about 50% of the\nstars have already lost their disks. We examined a sample of 500 cluster\nmembers whose photometric variations were monitored in the optical for 38\nconsecutive days with CoRoT. Light curves were analyzed for periodicity using\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the autocorrelation function and the\nstring-length method. The period distribution obtained for the cluster consists\nof a smooth distribution centered around P=5.2 d with two peaks at P=1-2 d and\n3-4 d. A separate analysis of CTTS and WTTS indicates that the P=1-2 d peak is\nassociated with the latter, while both groups contribute to the P=3-4 d peak.\nThe comparison between CTTS and WTTS supports the idea of a rotation-accretion\nconnection: their respective rotational properties are statistically different,\nand CTTS rotate on average more slowly than WTTS. We also observe a clear\ndearth of fast rotators with strong accretion signatures (large UV flux\nexcess). This is consistent with earlier findings that fast rotators in young\nstar clusters are typically devoid of dusty disks. Our sample shows some\nevidence of a mass dependence in the rotation properties of NGC 2264 members,\nlower-mass stars spinning on average faster. This study confirms that disks\ninfluence the rotational evolution of young stars. The idea of disk-locking may\nbe consistent with the picture of rotation and rotation-accretion connection\nthat we observe for the NGC 2264 cluster. However, the origin of the several\nsubstructures that we observe in the period distribution deserves further\ninvestigation.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce a new alternative quantum fidelity for quantum\nstates which perfectly satisfies all Jozsas axioms and is zero for orthogonal\nstates. By employing this fidelity, we derive an improved bound for quantum\nspeed limit time in open quantum systems in which the initial states can be\nchosen as either pure or mixed. This bound leads to the well-known\nMandelstamm-Tamm type bound for nonunitary dynamics in the case of initial pure\nstates. However, in the case of initial mixed states, the bound provided by the\nintroduced fidelity is tighter and sharper than the obtained bounds in the\nprevious works.\n", "  We study the link between baryons and dark matter in 240 galaxies with\nspatially resolved kinematic data. Our sample spans 9 dex in stellar mass and\nincludes all morphological types. We consider (i) 153 late-type galaxies (LTGs;\nspirals and irregulars) with gas rotation curves from the SPARC database; (ii)\n25 early-type galaxies (ETGs; ellipticals and lenticulars) with stellar and HI\ndata from ATLAS^3D or X-ray data from Chandra; and (iii) 62 dwarf spheroidals\n(dSphs) with individual-star spectroscopy. We find that LTGs, ETGs, and\n\"classical\" dSphs follow the same radial acceleration relation: the observed\nacceleration (gobs) correlates with that expected from the distribution of\nbaryons (gbar) over 4 dex. The relation coincides with the 1:1 line (no dark\nmatter) at high accelerations but systematically deviates from unity below a\ncritical scale of ~10^-10 m/s^2. The observed scatter is remarkably small\n(<0.13 dex) and largely driven by observational uncertainties. The residuals do\nnot correlate with any global or local galaxy property (baryonic mass, gas\nfraction, radius, etc.). The radial acceleration relation is tantamount to a\nNatural Law: when the baryonic contribution is measured, the rotation curve\nfollows, and vice versa. Including ultrafaint dSphs, the relation may extend by\nanother 2 dex and possibly flatten at gbar<10^-12 m/s^2, but these data are\nsignificantly more uncertain. The radial acceleration relation subsumes and\ngeneralizes several well-known dynamical properties of galaxies, like the\nTully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations, the \"baryon-halo\" conspiracies, and\nRenzo's rule.\n", "  We investigate the effects of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interactions on the\nfrustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ kagome-Heisenberg model using the pseudo-fermion\nfunctional-renormalization-group (PFFRG) technique. In order to treat the\noff-diagonal nature of DM interactions, we develop an extended PFFRG scheme. We\nbenchmark this approach in parameter regimes that have previously been studied\nwith other methods and find good agreement of the magnetic phase diagram.\nParticularly, finite DM interactions are found to stabilize all types of\nnon-collinear magnetic orders of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model\n($\\mathbf{q}=0$, $\\sqrt{3}\\times\\sqrt{3}$, and cuboc orders) and shrink the\nextents of magnetically disordered phases. We discuss our results in the light\nof the mineral {\\it herbertsmithite} which has been experimentally predicted to\nhost a quantum spin liquid at low temperatures. Our PFFRG data indicates that\nthis material lies in close proximity to a quantum critical point. In parts of\nthe experimentally relevant parameter regime for {\\it herbertsmithite}, the\nspin-correlation profile is found to be in good qualitative agreement with\nrecent inelastic-neutron-scattering data.\n", "  We use deep optical photometry from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey\n[NGVS] to investigate the color-magnitude diagram for the galaxies inhabiting\nthe core of this cluster. The sensitivity of the NGVS imaging allows us to\ncontinuously probe galaxy colors over a factor of $\\sim 2 \\times 10^5$ in\nluminosity, from brightest cluster galaxies to scales overlapping classical\nsatellites of the Milky Way [$M_{g^{\\prime}}$ $\\sim$ $-$9; $M_{*}$ $\\sim 10^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$], within a single environment. Remarkably, we find the first\nevidence that the RS flattens in all colors at the faint-magnitude end\n[starting between $-$14 $\\le$ $M_{g^{\\prime}}$ $\\le$ $-$13, around $M_{*}$\n$\\sim 4 \\times 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$], with the slope decreasing to $\\sim$60% or\nless of its value at brighter magnitudes. This could indicate that the stellar\npopulations of faint dwarfs in Virgo's core share similar characteristics [e.g.\nconstant mean age] over $\\sim$3 mags in luminosity, suggesting that these\ngalaxies were quenched coevally, likely via pre-processing in smaller hosts. We\nalso compare our results to galaxy formation models, finding that the RS in\nmodel clusters have slopes at intermediate magnitudes that are too shallow, and\nin the case of semi-analytic models, do not reproduce the flattening seen at\nboth extremes [bright/faint] of the Virgo RS. Deficiencies in the chemical\nevolution of model galaxies likely contribute to the model-data discrepancies\nat all masses, while overly efficient quenching may also be a factor at dwarf\nscales. Deep UV and near-IR photometry are required to unambiguously diagnose\nthe cause of the faint-end flattening.\n", "  We perform calculations showing that a source producing $K^* \\bar{K}^*$ in $J\n= 2$ and $L=0$ gives rise to a triangle singularity at $1810$ MeV with a width\nof about $200$ MeV from the mechanism $K^* \\to \\pi K$ and then $K\\bar{K}^*$\nmerging into the $a_1(1260)$ resonance. We suggest that this is the origin of\nthe present $f_2(1810)$ resonance and propose to look at the $\\pi a_1(1260)$\nmode in several reactions to clarify the issue.\n", "  We report new ALMA observations of the CO(3-2) line emission from the\n$2.1\\pm0.3\\times10^{10}\\rm\\thinspace M_{\\odot}$ molecular gas reservoir in the\ncentral galaxy of the Phoenix cluster. The cold molecular gas is fuelling a\nvigorous starburst at a rate of $500-800\\rm\\thinspace M_{\\odot}\\rm\\; yr^{-1}$\nand powerful black hole activity in the form of both intense quasar radiation\nand radio jets. The radio jets have inflated huge bubbles filled with\nrelativistic plasma into the hot, X-ray atmospheres surrounding the host\ngalaxy. The ALMA observations show that extended filaments of molecular gas,\neach $10-20\\rm\\; kpc$ long with a mass of several billion solar masses, are\nlocated along the peripheries of the radio bubbles. The smooth velocity\ngradients and narrow line widths along each filament reveal massive, ordered\nmolecular gas flows around each bubble, which are inconsistent with\ngravitational free-fall. The molecular clouds have been lifted directly by the\nradio bubbles, or formed via thermal instabilities induced in low entropy gas\nlifted in the updraft of the bubbles. These new data provide compelling\nevidence for close coupling between the radio bubbles and the cold gas, which\nis essential to explain the self-regulation of feedback. The very feedback\nmechanism that heats hot atmospheres and suppresses star formation may also\nparadoxically stimulate production of the cold gas required to sustain feedback\nin massive galaxies.\n", "  The mass and meson-current coupling of the diquark-antidiquark states with\nthe quantum numbers $J^{P}=0^{+}$ and quark contents $Z_{q}=[cq][\\bar {b} \\bar\nq ]$ and $Z_{s}=[cs][\\bar {b} \\bar s]$ are calculated using two-point QCD sum\nrule approach. In calculations the quark, gluon and mixing condensates up to\neight dimensions are taken into account. The parameters of the scalar\ntetraquarks extracted from this analysis are employed to explore the strong\nvertices $Z_q B_c \\pi $, $Z_q B_c \\eta $ and $Z_s B_c \\eta $ and compute the\ncouplings $g_{Z_qB_c \\pi }$, $g_{Z_qB_c \\eta }$ and $g_{Z_sB_c \\eta }$. The\nstrong couplings are obtained within the soft-meson approximation of QCD\nlight-cone sum rule method: they form, alongside with other parameters, the\nbasis for evaluating the widths of $Z_q \\to B_c \\pi$, $% Z_q \\to B_c \\eta$ and\n$Z_s \\to B_c \\eta$ decays. Obtained in this work results for the mass of the\ntetraquarks $Z_{q}$ and $Z_{s}$ are compared with available predictions\npresented in the literature.\n", "  The question of whether there exist bound states of two heavy quarks\n$Q=(c,b)$ and antiquarks $\\bar Q = (\\bar c, \\bar b)$, distinct from a pair of\nquark-antiquark mesons, has been debated for more than forty years. We suggest\nsome means of producing and observing $Q_1 Q_2 \\bar Q_3 \\bar Q_4$ resonant\nstates, concentrating on the $c c \\bar c \\bar c$ channel which is most easily\nproduced and the $b b \\bar b \\bar b$ channel which has a better chance of being\nrelatively narrow. We obtain $M_{(cc)(\\bar c \\bar c)} = 6,192 \\pm 25$ MeV and\n$M_{(bb)(\\bar b \\bar b)} = 18,826 \\pm 25$ MeV, for the charmed and bottom\ntetraquarks, respectively. Experimental search for these states in the relevant\nmass region is highly desirable.\n", "  We report initial observations and analysis on the Type IIb SN~2016gkg in the\nnearby galaxy NGC~613. SN~2016gkg exhibited a clear double-peaked light curve\nduring its early evolution, as evidenced by our intensive photometric follow-up\ncampaign. SN~2016gkg shows strong similarities with other Type IIb SNe, in\nparticular with respect to the \\he~emission features observed in both the\noptical and near infrared. SN~2016gkg evolved faster than the prototypical\nType~IIb SN~1993J, with a decline similar to that of SN~2011dh after the first\npeak. The analysis of archival {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} images indicate a\npre-explosion source at SN~2016gkg's position, suggesting a progenitor star\nwith a $\\sim$mid F spectral type and initial mass $15-20$\\msun, depending on\nthe distance modulus adopted for NGC~613. Modeling the temperature evolution\nwithin $5\\,\\rm{days}$ of explosion, we obtain a progenitor radius of\n$\\sim\\,48-124$\\rsun, smaller than that obtained from the analysis of the\npre-explosion images ($240-320$\\rsun).\n", "  The ability in experiments to control the relative twist angle between\nsuccessive layers in two-dimensional (2D) materials offers a new approach to\nmanipulating their electronic properties; we refer to this approach as\n\"twistronics\". A major challenge to theory is that, for arbitrary twist angles,\nthe resulting structure involves incommensurate (aperiodic) 2D lattices. Here,\nwe present a general method for the calculation of the electronic density of\nstates of aperiodic 2D layered materials, using parameter-free hamiltonians\nderived from ab initio density-functional theory. We use graphene, a semimetal,\nand MoS$_2$, a representative of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)\nfamily of 2D semiconductors, to illustrate the application of our method, which\nenables fast and efficient simulation of multi-layered stacks in the presence\nof local disorder and external fields. We comment on the interesting features\nof their Density of States (DoS) as a function of twist-angle and local\nconfiguration and on how these features can be experimentally observed.\n", "  The detection of organic molecules with increasing complexity and potential\nbiological relevance is opening the possibility to understand the formation of\nthe building blocks of life in the interstellar medium. One of the families of\nmolecules with astrobiological interest are the esters, whose simplest member,\nmethyl formate, is rather abundant in star-forming regions. The next step in\nthe chemical complexity of esters is ethyl formate, C$_2$H$_5$OCHO. Only two\ndetections of this species have been reported so far, which strongly limits our\nunderstanding of how complex molecules are formed in the interstellar medium.\nWe have searched for ethyl formate towards the W51 e2 hot molecular core, one\nof the most chemically rich sources in the Galaxy and one of the most promising\nregions to study prebiotic chemistry, especially after the recent discovery of\nthe P$-$O bond, key in the formation of DNA. We have analyzed a spectral line\nsurvey towards the W51 e2 hot molecular core, which covers 44 GHz in the 1, 2\nand 3 mm bands, carried out with the IRAM 30m telescope. We report the\ndetection of the trans and gauche conformers of ethyl formate. A Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium analysis indicates that the excitation temperature is\n78$\\pm$10 K and that the two conformers have similar source-averaged column\ndensities of (2.0$\\pm$0.3)$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ and an abundance of\n$\\sim$10$^{-8}$. We compare the observed molecular abundances of ethyl formate\nwith different competing chemical models based on grain surface and gas-phase\nchemistry. We propose that grain-surface chemistry may have a dominant role in\nthe formation of ethyl formate (and other complex organic molecules) in hot\nmolecular cores, rather than reactions in the gas phase.\n", "  When atomic gases are laser driven to Rydberg states in an off resonant way,\na single Rydberg atom may enhance the excitation rate of surrounding atoms.\nThis leads to a facilitated excitation referred to as Rydberg anti-blockade. In\nthe usual facilitation scenario, the detuning of the laser from resonance\ncompensates the interaction shift. Here, we discuss a different excitation\nmechanism, which we call anomalous facilitation. This occurs on the \"wrong\nside\" of the resonance and originates from inhomogeneous broadening. The\nanomalous facilitation may be seen in experiments of attractively interacting\natoms on the blue detuned side, where facilitation is not expected to appear.\n", "  We perform self-consistent studies of two-dimensional (2D) $s$-wave\ntopological superconductivity (TSC) with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman\nfield by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. In particular, we examine\nthe effects of a nonmagnetic impurity in detail and show that the nature of the\nspin-polarised midgap bound state varies significantly depending on the\nmaterial parameters. Most notably, a nonmagnetic impurity in a 2D $s$-wave\ntopological superconductor can act like a magnetic impurity in a conventional\n$s$-wave superconductor, leading to phase transitions of the ground state as\nthe impurity potential is varied. Furthermore, by solving for the\nspin-dependent Hartree potential self-consistently along with the\nsuperconducting order parameter, we demonstrate that topological charge density\nwaves can coexist with TSC at half filling just as in a conventional $s$-wave\nsuperconductor.\n", "  During the late stages of gravitational core-collapse of massive stars,\nextreme isospin asymmetries are reached within the core. Due to the lack of\nmicroscopic calculations of electron capture (EC) rates for all relevant\nnuclei, in general simple analytic parameterizations are employed. We study\nhere several extensions of these parameterizations, allowing for a temperature,\nelectron density and isospin dependence as well as for odd-even effects. The\nlatter extra degrees of freedom considerably improve the agreement with large\nscale microscopic rate calculations. We find, in particular, that the isospin\ndependence leads to a significant reduction of the global EC rates during core\ncollapse with respect to fiducial results, where rates optimized on\ncalculations of stable $fp$-shell nuclei are used. Our results indicate that\nsystematic microscopic calculations and experimental measurements in the\n$N\\approx 50$ neutron rich region are desirable for realistic simulations of\nthe core-collapse.\n", "  The Einstein-Proca system is studied in the case of a complex vector-field\nself-interacting through an appropriate potential with a global U(1) symmetry.\nThe corresponding equations for a static, cylindrically symmetric metric and\nmatter fields are then constructed and solved. In the probe limit (no gravity),\nit is shown that the equations admit at least two classes of regular solutions\ndistinguished by the asymptotic behavior of the matter fields. One of these\nclasses corresponds to lumps of vector fields localized in a cylindrical\nregion, we naturally call these solutions \"Proca-Q-tubes\". They constitute the\ncylindrical counterparts of spherical Proca-Q-balls constructed recently, they\ncan be characterized by finite mass and charge per unit-length of the tube. The\ndomain of existence of these Proca-Q-tubes with respect to the coupling\nconstants determining the potential is studied in detail. Finally, the\ngravitating Proca-Q-tubes are constructed and studied.\n", "  The [CII] 158 um fine structure line is one of the dominant cooling lines in\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) and is an important tracer of star formation.\nRecent velocity-resolved studies with Herschel/HIFI and SOFIA/GREAT showed that\nthe [CII] line can constrain the properties of the ISM phases in star-forming\nregions. The [CII] line as a tracer of star formation is particularly important\nin low-metallicity environments where CO emission is weak because of the\npresence of large amounts of CO-dark gas. The nearby irregular dwarf galaxy NGC\n4214 offers an excellent opportunity to study an actively star-forming ISM at\nlow metallicity. We analyzed the spectrally resolved [CII] line profiles in\nthree distinct regions at different evolutionary stages of NGC 4214 with\nrespect to ancillary HI and CO data in order to study the origin of the [CII]\nline. We used SOFIA/GREAT [CII] 158 um observations, HI data from THINGS, and\nCO(2-1) data from HERACLES to decompose the spectrally resolved [CII] line\nprofiles into components associated with neutral atomic and molecular gas. We\nuse this decomposition to infer gas masses traced by [CII] under different ISM\nconditions. Averaged over all regions, we associate about 46% of the [CII]\nemission with the HI emission. However, we can assign only around 9% of the\ntotal [CII] emission to the cold neutral medium (CNM). We found that about 79%\nof the total molecular hydrogen mass is not traced by CO emission. On average,\nthe fraction of CO-dark gas dominates the molecular gas mass budget. The\nfraction seems to depend on the evolutionary stage of the regions: it is\nhighest in the region covering a super star cluster in NGC 4214, while it is\nlower in a more compact, more metal-rich region.\n", "  The 2175 \\AA\\ UV extinction feature was discovered in the mid-1960s, yet its\nphysical origin remains poorly understood. One suggestion is absorption by\nPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) molecules, which is supported by\ntheoretical molecular structure computations and by laboratory experiments.\nPAHs are positively detected by their 3.3, 6.2, 7.7 8.6, 11.3 & 12.7 $\\mu$m IR\nemission bands, which are specified by their modes of vibration. A definitive\nempirical link between the 2175 \\AA\\ UV extinction, and the PAH IR emission\nbands, however, is still missing. We present a new sample of hot stars that\nhave both 2175 \\AA\\ absorption and PAH IR emission. We find significant shifts\nof the central wavelength of the UV absorption feature, up to 2350 \\AA, but\npredominantly in stars that also have IR PAH emission. These UV shifts depend\non stellar temperature in a fashion that is similar to the shifts of the 6.2\nand 7.7$\\mu$m PAH IR bands, namely the features are increasingly more\nred-shifted as the stellar temperature decreases, but only below $\\sim 15$ kK.\nAbove 15 kK both UV and IR features retain their nominal values. Moreover, we\nfind a suggestive correlation between the UV and IR shifts. We hypothesize that\nthese similar dependences of both the UV and IR features on stellar temperature\nhint to a common origin of the two in PAH molecules and may establish the\nmissing link between the UV and IR observations. We further suggest that the\nshifts depend on molecular size, and that the critical temperature of $\\sim 15$\nkK above which no shifts are observed is related to the onset of UV driven\nhot-star winds and their associated shocks.\n", "  We revisit the phase diagram of spin-1 $su(2)_k$ anyonic chains, originally\nstudied by Gils {\\it et. al.} [Phys. Rev. B, {\\bf 87} (23) (2013)]. These\nchains possess several integrable points, which were overlooked (or only\nbriefly considered) so far.\n  Exploiting integrability through a combination of algebraic techniques and\nexact Bethe ansatz results, we establish in particular the presence of new\nfirst order phase transitions, a new critical point described by a $Z_k$\nparafermionic CFT, and of even more phases than originally conjectured. Our\nresults leave room for yet more progress in the understanding of spin-1 anyonic\nchains.\n", "  We present the results from an all-sky search for short-duration\ngravitational waves in the data of the first run of the Advanced LIGO detectors\nbetween September 2015 and January 2016. The search algorithms use minimal\nassumptions on the signal morphology, so they are sensitive to a wide range of\nsources emitting gravitational waves. The analyses target transient signals\nwith duration ranging from milliseconds to seconds over the frequency band of\n32 to 4096 Hz. The first observed gravitational-wave event, GW150914, has been\ndetected with high confidence in this search; other known gravitational-wave\nevents fall below the search's sensitivity. Besides GW150914, all of the search\nresults are consistent with the expected rate of accidental noise coincidences.\nFinally, we estimate rate-density limits for a broad range of non-BBH transient\ngravitational-wave sources as a function of their gravitational radiation\nemission energy and their characteristic frequency. These rate-density\nupper-limits are stricter than those previously published by an\norder-of-magnitude.\n", "  We search for excess gamma-ray emission coincident with the positions of\nconfirmed and candidate Milky Way satellite galaxies using 6 years of data from\nthe Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes\n28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies\n(dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric\ncharacteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of\nthese targets, the relative predicted gamma-ray flux due to dark matter\nannihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from\na distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems\nare dark-matter-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly\ndiscovered targets show a slight preference (each ~$2 \\sigma$ local) for\ngamma-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of\nderived gamma-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is consistent with\nthe expectation from analyzing random blank-sky regions, and a combined\nanalysis of the population of stellar systems yields no globally significant\nexcess (global significance $<1 \\sigma$). Our analysis has increased\nsensitivity compared to the analysis of 15 confirmed dSphs by Ackermann et al.\n2015. The observed constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section\nare statistically consistent with the background expectation, improving by a\nfactor of ~2 for large dark matter masses ($m_{{\\rm DM},b \\bar b} \\gtrsim 1$\nTeV and $m_{{\\rm DM},\\tau^{+}\\tau^{-}} \\gtrsim 70$ GeV) and weakening by a\nfactor of ~1.5 at lower masses relative to previously observed limits.\n", "  Observations of Uranus were made on the 8/9th November with HST/WFC3 at a\ntime when a huge cloud complex was present at 30 - 40N. We imaged Uranus in\nseven filters spanning 467 - 924 nm, and analysed these observations with the\nNEMESIS radiative-transfer and retrieval code.\n  The same system was also observed in the H-band with VLT/SINFONI ON 31st\nOctober and 11th November (Irwin et al., 2016). To constrain the background\ncloud particle sizes and scattering properties we conducted a limb-darkening\nanalysis of the background cloud structure at 30-40N by simultaneously fitting:\na) these HST/OPAL observations at a range of zenith angles; b) the VLT/SINFONI\nobservations at a range of zenith angles; and c) IRTF/SpeX observations made in\n2009 (Irwin et al., 2015).\n  We find that the observations are well modelled with a three-component cloud\ncomprised of: 1) a vertically thin, but optically thick 'deep' tropospheric\ncloud at a pressure of ~2 bars; 2) a methane-ice cloud at the\nmethane-condensation level with variable vertical extent; and 3) a vertically\nextended tropospheric haze. We find that the particles sizes in both haze and\ntropospheric cloud have an effective radius of ~0.1 micron, although we cannot\nrule out larger particle sizes in the tropospheric cloud.\n  We find that the particles in both the tropospheric cloud and haze are more\nscattering at short wavelengths, giving them a blue colour, but are more\nabsorbing at longer wavelengths, especially for the tropospheric haze. For the\nparticles in the storm clouds, which we assume to be composed of methane ice\nparticles, we find that their mean radii must be ~0.5 micron. We find that the\nhigh clouds have low integrated opacity, and that \"streamers\" reminiscent of\nthunderstorm anvils are confined to levels deeper than 1 bar. These results\nargue against vigorous moist convective origins for the cloud features.\n", "  \\textit{Topmetal-${II}^-$} is a low noise CMOS pixel direct charge sensor\nwith a pitch of 83$\\mu m$. CdZnTe is an excellent semiconductor material for\nradiation detection. The combination of CdZnTe and the sensor makes it possible\nto build a detector with high spatial resolution. In our experiments, an epoxy\nadhesive is used as the conductive medium to connect the sensor and Cadmium\nZinc Telluride (CdZnTe). The diffusion coefficient and charge efficiency of\nelectrons are measured at a low bias voltage of -2 Volts, and the image of a\nsingle alpha is clear with a reasonable spatial resolution. The detector of\nsuch structure has the potential to be applied in X-ray imaging systems with a\nfurther improvements of the sensor.\n", "  We study the behavior of the complex potential between a heavy quark and its\nantiquark, which are in relative motion with respect to a hot and dense medium.\nThe heavy quark-antiquark complex potential is obtained by correcting both the\nCoulombic and the linear terms in the Cornell potential through a dielectric\nfunction estimated within the real-time formalism using the hard thermal loop\napproximation. We show the variation of both the real and the imaginary parts\nof the potential for different values of velocities when the bound state ($\nQ\\bar{Q}$ pair) is aligned in the direction parallel as well as perpendicular\nto the relative velocity of the $ Q\\bar{Q}$ pair with the thermal medium. With\nan increase of the relative velocity the screening of the real part of the\npotential becomes weaker at short distances and stronger at large distances for\nthe parallel case. However, for the perpendicular case the potential decreases\nwith an increase of the velocity at all distances which results in the larger\nscreening of the potential. In addition, the inclusion of the string term makes\nthe screening of the potential weaker as compared to the Coulombic term alone\nfor both cases. Therefore, by combining all these effects we expect a stronger\nbinding of a $ Q\\bar{Q} $ pair in a moving medium in the presence of the string\nterm as compared to the Coulombic term alone. The imaginary part decreases (in\nmagnitude) with an increase of the relative velocity, leading to a decrease of\nthe width of the quarkonium state at higher velocities. The inclusion of the\nstring term increases the magnitude of the imaginary part, which results in an\nincrease of the width of the quarkonium states. All of these effects lead to\nthe modification in the dissolution of quarkonium states.\n", "  Ground-state OH masers identified in the Southern Parkes Large-Area Survey in\nHydroxyl were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array to obtain\npositions with high accuracy ($\\sim$1\\,arcsec). We classified these OH masers\ninto evolved star OH maser sites, star formation OH maser sites, supernova\nremnant OH maser sites, planetary nebula OH maser sites and unknown maser sites\nusing their accurate positions. Evolved star and star formation OH maser sites\nin the Galactic Centre region (between Galactic longitudes of $-5^{\\circ}$ to\n$+5^{\\circ}$ and Galactic latitudes of $-2^{\\circ}$ and $+2^{\\circ}$) were\nstudied in detail to understand their distributions.\n", "  We study the evolution of holographic screens, both generally and in explicit\nexamples, including cosmology and gravitational collapse. A screen $H$ consists\nof a one-parameter sequence of maximal surfaces called leaves. Its causal\nstructure is nonrelativistic. Each leaf can store all of the quantum\ninformation on a corresponding null slice holographically, at no more than one\nbit per Planck area. Therefore, we expect the screen geometry to reflect\ncertain coarse-grained quantities in the quantum gravity theory.\n  In a given spacetime, there are many different screens, which are naturally\nassociated to different observers. We find that this ambiguity corresponds\nprecisely to the free choice of a single function on $H$. We also consider the\nbackground-free construction of $H$, where the spacetime is not given. The\nevolution equations then constrain aspects of the full spacetime and the\nscreen's embedding in it.\n", "  The Casimir effect is one of the most remarkable consequences of the non-zero\nvacuum energy predicted by quantum field theory. In this paper we use a local\napproach to study the Lorentz violation effects of the minimal standard model\nextension on the Casimir force between two parallel conducting plates in the\nvacuum. Using a perturbative method similar to that used for obtaining the Born\nseries for the scattering amplitudes in quantum mechanics, we compute, at\nleading order in the Lorentz-violating coefficients, the relevant Green's\nfunction which satisfies given boundary conditions. The standard\npoint-splitting technique allow us to express the vacuum expectation value of\nthe stress-energy tensor in terms of the Green's function. We discuss its\nstructure in the region between the plates. We compute the renormalized vacuum\nstress, which is obtained as the difference between the vacuum stress in the\npresence of the plates and that of the vacuum. The Casimir force is evaluated\nin an analytical fashion by two methods: by differentiating the renormalized\nglobal energy density and by computing the normal-normal component of the\nrenormalized vacuum stress. We compute the local Casimir energy, which is found\nto diverge as approaching the plates, and we demonstrate that it does not\ncontribute to the observable force.\n", "  We analyze the topological deformations of a spin-1/2 in an effective\nmagnetic field induced by an ohmic quantum dissipative environment at zero\ntemperature. From Bethe Ansatz results and a variational approach, we confirm\nthat the Chern number is preserved in the delocalized phase for $\\alpha<1$. We\nreport a divergence of the Berry curvature at the equator when $\\alpha_c=1$\nthat appears at the localization Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition\nin this model. Recent experiments in quantum circuits have engineered\nnon-equilibrium protocols in time to access topological properties at\nequilibrium from the measure of the (quasi-)adiabatic out-of-equilibrium spin\nexpectation values. Applying a numerically exact stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation we find that, for a fixed sweep velocity, the bath induces a crossover\nfrom (quasi-)adiabatic to non-adiabatic dynamical behavior when the spin bath\ncoupling increases. We also investigate the particular regime $H/\\omega_c \\ll\nv/H \\ll 1$, where the dynamical Chern number observable built from\nout-of-equilibrium spin expectation values vanishes at $\\alpha=1/2$. In this\nregime, the mapping to an interacting resonance level model enables us to\ncharacterize the evolution of the dynamical Chern number in the vicinity of\n$\\alpha=1/2$. Then, we provide an intuitive physical explanation of the\nbreakdown of adiabaticity in analogy to the Faraday effect in electromagnetism.\nWe demonstrate that the driving of the spin leads to the production of a large\nnumber of bosonic excitations in the bath, which in return strongly affect the\nspin dynamics. Finally, we quantify the spin-bath entanglement and build an\nanalogy with an effective model at thermal equilibrium.\n", "  Massive star evolution remains only partly constrained. In particular, the\nexact role of rotation has been questioned by puzzling properties of OB stars\nin the Magellanic Clouds. Our goal is to study the relation between surface\nchemical composition and rotational velocity, and to test predictions of\nevolutionary models including rotation. We have performed a spectroscopic\nanalysis of a sample of fifteen Galactic O7-8 giant stars. This sample is\nhomogeneous in terms of mass, metallicity and evolutionary state. It is made of\nstars with a wide range of projected rotational velocities. We show that the\nsample stars are located on the second half of the main sequence, in a\nrelatively narrow mass range (25-40 Msun). Almost all stars with projected\nrotational velocities above 100 km/s have N/C ratios about ten times the\ninitial value. Below 100 km/s a wide range of N/C values is observed. The\nrelation between N/C and surface gravity is well reproduced by various sets of\nmodels. Some evolutionary models including rotation are also able to\nconsistently explain slowly rotating, highly enriched stars. This is due to\ndifferential rotation which efficiently transports nucleosynthesis products and\nallows the surface to rotate slower than the core. In addition, angular\nmomentum removal by winds amplifies surface braking on the main sequence.\nComparison of the surface composition of O7-8 giant stars with a sample of B\nstars with initial masses about four times smaller reveal that chemical\nenrichment scales with initial mass, as expected from theory. Although\nevolutionary models that include rotation face difficulties in explaining the\nchemical properties of O- and B-type stars at low metallicity, some of them can\nconsistently account for the properties of main-sequence Galactic O stars in\nthe mass range 25-40 Msun\n", "  We theoretically study the anisotropic magnetotransport in Dirac-Weyl\nmagnetic junctions where a doped ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal is sandwiched\nbetween doped Dirac semimetals. We calculate the conductance using the Landauer\nformula and find that the system exhibits extraordinarily large anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance (AMR). The AMR depends on the ratio of the Fermi energy and\nthe strength of the exchange interaction. The origin of the AMR is the shift of\nthe Fermi surface in the Weyl semimetal and the mechanism is completely\ndifferent from the conventional AMR originating from the spin dependent\nscattering and the spin-orbit interaction.\n", "  We have studied the production and decay of the $f_1(1285)$ into $\\pi\na_0(980)$ and $K^* \\bar K$ as a function of the mass of the resonance and find\na shoulder around 1400 MeV, tied to a triangle singularity, for the $\\pi\na_0(980)$ mode, and a peak around 1420 MeV with about 60 MeV width for the $K^*\n\\bar K$ mode. Both these features agree with the experimental information on\nwhich the $f_1(1420)$ resonance is based. In addition, we find that if the\n$f_1(1420)$ is a genuine resonance, coupling mostly to $K^* \\bar K$ as seen\nexperimentally, one finds unavoidably about a 20\\% fraction for $\\pi a_0(980)$\ndecay of this resonance, in drastic contradiction with all experiments.\nAltogether, we conclude that the $f_1(1420)$ is not a genuine resonance, but\nthe manifestation of the $\\pi a_0(980)$ and $K^* \\bar K$ decay modes of the\n$f_1(1285)$ at higher energies than the nominal one.\n", "  Recent observations have shown that a growing number of the most massive\nGalactic globular clusters contain multiple populations of stars with different\n[Fe/H] and neutron-capture element abundances. NGC 6273 has only recently been\nrecognized as a member of this \"iron-complex\" cluster class, and we provide\nhere a chemical and kinematic analysis of > 300 red giant branch (RGB) and\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) member stars using high resolution spectra\nobtained with the Magellan-M2FS and VLT-FLAMES instruments. Multiple lines of\nevidence indicate that NGC 6273 possesses an intrinsic metallicity spread that\nranges from about [Fe/H] = -2 to -1 dex, and may include at least three\npopulations with different [Fe/H] values. The three populations identified here\ncontain separate first (Na/Al-poor) and second (Na/Al-rich) generation stars,\nbut a Mg-Al anti-correlation may only be present in stars with [Fe/H] > -1.65.\nThe strong correlation between [La/Eu] and [Fe/H] suggests that the s-process\nmust have dominated the heavy element enrichment at higher metallicities. A\nsmall group of stars with low [alpha/Fe] is identified and may have been\naccreted from a former surrounding field star population. The cluster's large\nabundance variations are coupled with a complex, extended, and multimodal blue\nhorizontal branch (HB). The HB morphology and chemical abundances suggest that\nNGC 6273 may have an origin that is similar to omega Cen and M 54.\n", "  Squeezed-state interferometry plays an important role in quantum-enhanced\noptical phase estimation, as it allows the estimation precision to be improved\nup to the Heisenberg limit by using ideal photon-number-resolving detectors at\nthe output ports. Here we show that for each individual $N$-photon component of\nthe phase-matched coherent $\\otimes$ squeezed vacuum input state, the classical\nFisher information always saturates the quantum Fisher information. Moreover,\nthe total Fisher information is the sum of the contributions from each\nindividual $N$-photon components, where the largest $N$ is limited by the\nfinite number resolution of available photon counters. Based on this\nobservation, we provide an approximate analytical formula that quantifies the\namount of lost information due to the finite photon number resolution, e.g.,\ngiven the mean photon number $\\bar{n}$ in the input state, over $96$ percent of\nthe Heisenberg limit can be achieved with the number resolution larger than\n$5\\bar{n}$.\n", "  We comment on the paper \"Critique and correction of the currently accepted\nsolution of the infinite spherical well in quantum mechanics\" by Huang\nYoung-Sea and Thomann Hans-Rudolph, EPL 115, 60001 (2016) .\n", "  Mechanical spectroscopy, i.e. cyclic deformations at varying frequencies, is\nused theoretically and numerically to measure dissipation in model glasses.\nFrom a normal mode analysis, we show that in the high-frequency THz regime\nwhere dissipation is harmonic, the quality factor (or loss angle) can be\nexpressed analytically. This expression is validated through non-equilibrium\nmolecular dynamics simulations applied to a model of amorphous silica\n(SiO$_2$). Dissipation is shown to arise from non-affine relaxations triggered\nby the applied strain through the excitation of vibrational eigenmodes that act\nas damped harmonic oscillators. We discuss an asymmetry vector field, which\nencodes the information about the structural origin of dissipation measured by\nmechanical spectroscopy. In the particular case of silica, we find that the\nmotion of oxygen atoms, which induce a deformation of Si-O-Si bonds is the main\ncontributor to harmonic energy dissipation.\n", "  Assessing the quality of aperture synthesis maps is relevant for benchmarking\nimage reconstruction algorithms, for the scientific exploitation of data from\noptical long-baseline interferometers, and for the design/upgrade of\nnew/existing interferometric imaging facilities. Although metrics have been\nproposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the\nselection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the\nquestion: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed\nimage? It starts by considering several metrics, and selecting a few based on\ngeneral properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases is\nconsidered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing\nat the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two,\nthree, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished\nwith the MiRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is\nfound that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for\nproper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images\nis superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the\narray. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis\nalgorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l1 norm is the most\nrobust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to\nimage smoothing by high regularisation levels. For the cases considered, this\nmetric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of\nreconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.\n", "  In barred galaxies, the contours of stellar velocity dispersions ($\\sigma$)\nare generally expected to be oval and aligned with the orientation of bars.\nHowever, many double-barred (S2B) galaxies exhibit distinct $\\sigma$ peaks on\nthe minor axis of inner bars, which we termed \"$\\sigma$-humps,\" while two local\n$\\sigma$ minima are present close to the ends of inner bars, i.e.,\n\"$\\sigma$-hollows.\" Analysis of numerical simulations shows that\n$\\sigma_z$-humps or hollows should play an important role in generating the\nobserved $\\sigma$-humps+hollows in low-inclination galaxies. In order to\nsystematically investigate the properties of $\\sigma_z$ in barred galaxies, we\napply the vertical Jeans equation to a group of well-designed three-dimensional\nbar+disk(+bulge) models. A vertically thin bar can lower $\\sigma_z$ along the\nbar and enhance it perpendicular to the bar, thus generating\n$\\sigma_z$-humps+hollows. Such a result suggests that $\\sigma_z$-humps+hollows\ncan be generated by the purely dynamical response of stars in the presence of\na, sufficiently massive, vertically thin bar, even without an outer bar. Using\nself-consistent $N$-body simulations, we verify the existence of vertically\nthin bars in the nuclear-barred and S2B models which generate prominent\n$\\sigma$-humps+hollows. Thus the ubiquitous presence of $\\sigma$-humps+hollows\nin S2Bs implies that inner bars are vertically thin. The addition of a bulge\nmakes the $\\sigma_z$-humps more ambiguous and thus tends to somewhat hide the\n$\\sigma_z$-humps+hollows. We show that $\\sigma_z$ may be used as a kinematic\ndiagnostic of stellar components that have different thickness, providing a\ndirect perspective on the morphology and thickness of nearly face-on bars and\nbulges with integral field unit spectroscopy.\n", "  We propose four left-right symmetric extensions of several chiral 3-3-1\nmodels. Although they have some common features they also have important\ndifference due to different representation content.\n", "  Evidence of polarized $\\gamma$-ray emission ($>$ 50 keV) from Gamma-Ray\nBursts (GRBs) has been accumulated in recent years. Measurements have been\nreported with levels in the range of 30-80\\%, typically with limited\nstatistical significance. No clear picture has yet emerged with regards to the\npolarization properties of GRBs. Taken at face value, the data suggest that\nmost GRBs have a relatively large level of polarization (typically, $> 50\\%$),\nwhich may suggest synchrotron emission associated with an ordered magnetic\nfield structure within the GRB jet. But these results are far from conclusive.\nHere, we review the observations that have been made, concentrating especially\non the instrumental issues and the lessons that might be learned from these\ndata.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the RKKY exchange coupling between two\nferromagnets (FM) separated by a thin topological insulator film (TI). We find\nan unusual dependence of the RKKY exchange coupling on the TI thickness\n($t_{TI}$). First, when $t_{TI}$ decreases, the coupling amplitude increases at\nfirst and reaches its maximum value at some critical thickness, below which the\namplitude turns to diminish. This trend is attributed to the hybridization\nbetween surfaces of the TI film, which opens a gap below critical thickness and\nthus turns the surfaces into insulating state from semi-metal state. In\ninsulating phase, diamagnetism induced by the gap-opening compensates\nparamagnetism of Dirac state, resulting in a diminishing magnetic\nsusceptibility and RKKY coupling. For typical parameters, the critical\nthickness in Bi2Se3 thin film is estimated to be in the range of 3-5 nm.\n", "  Research on Galactic Center star formation is making great advances, in\nparticular due to new data from interferometers spatially resolving molecular\nclouds in this environment. These new results are discussed in the context of\nestablished knowledge about the Galactic Center. Particular attention is paid\nto suppressed star formation in the Galactic Center and how it might result\nfrom shallow density gradients in molecular clouds.\n", "  We present the Magellan/FIRE detection of highly-ionized CIV 1550 and OIII]\n1666 in a deep infrared spectrum of the z=6.11 gravitationally lensed low-mass\ngalaxy RXC J2248.7-4431-ID3, which has previously-known Lyman-alpha. No\ncorresponding emission is detected at the expected location of HeII 1640. The\nupper limit on HeII paired with detection of OIII] and CIV constrains possible\nionization scenarios. Production of CIV and OIII] requires ionizing photons of\n2.5-3.5 Ryd, but once in that state their multiplet emission is powered by\ncollisional excitation at lower energies (~0.5 Ryd). As a pure recombination\nline, HeII emission is powered by 4 Ryd ionizing photons. The data therefore\nrequire a spectrum with significant power at 3.5 Ryd but a rapid drop toward\n4.0 Ryd. This hard spectrum with a steep drop is characteristic of\nlow-metallicity stellar populations, and less consistent with soft AGN\nexcitation, which features more 4 Ryd photons and hence higher HeII flux. The\nconclusions based on ratios of metal line detections to Helium non-detection\nare strengthened if the gas metallicity is low. RXJ2248-ID3 adds to the growing\nhandful of reionization-era galaxies with UV emission line ratios distinct from\nthe general z=2-3 population, in a way that suggests hard ionizing spectra that\ndo not necessarily originate in AGN.\n", "  The QCD collinear factorization framework allows to describe exclusive\nbackward production of a $J/\\psi$ meson in pion-nucleon collisions in terms of\npion-to-nucleon transition distribution amplitudes. We calculate the scattering\namplitude at the leading order in the strong coupling constant and estimate the\ncross section of this reaction in the backward kinematical region for a medium\nenergy pion beam available at the J-Parc experimental facility.\n", "  Quasi-periodic modulations of the stellar light curve may result from dark\nspots crossing the visible stellar disc. Due to differential rotation, spots at\ndifferent latitudes generally have different rotation periods. Hence, by\nstudying spot-induced modulations, one can learn about stellar surface\n(differential) rotation and magnetic activity. Recently, Reinhold & Arlt (2015)\nproposed a method based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of light curves to\nidentify the sign of the differential rotation at the stellar surface. Our goal\nis to understand how the modulation of the stellar light curve due to the\npresence of spots and the corresponding periodogram are affected by both the\nstellar and spot properties. We generate synthetic light curves of stars with\ndifferent properties (inclination angle, limb darkening, and rotation rate) and\nspot configurations (number of spots, latitude, intensity contrast, and size).\nBy analysing their Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we compute the ratio between the\nheights of the second and first harmonics of the rotation period\n(peak-height-ratio). We find that the peak-height ratios are essentially a\nfunction of a single parameter, the fraction of time the spot is visible, which\nis related to the sinusoidality of the spot modulation. We identify the\nconditions under which the periodogram analysis can actually provide an\nestimate of the spot latitudes and/or the stellar inclination angle. We also\nidentify possible sources of error in the identification of the sign of the\ndifferential rotation.\n", "  Photon Dominated Regions (PDRs) are interfaces between the mainly ionized and\nmainly molecular material around young massive stars. Analysis of the physical\nand chemical structure of such regions traces the impact of far-ultraviolet\nradiation of young massive stars on their environment. We present results on\nthe physical and chemical structure of the prototypical high UV-illumination\nedge-on Orion Bar PDR from an unbiased spectral line survey with a wide\nspectral coverage. A spectral scan from 480-1250 GHz and 1410-1910 GHz at 1.1\nMHz resolution was obtained by the HIFI instrument onboard the Herschel Space\nObservatory. For molecules with multiple transitions we used rotational\ndiagrams to obtain excitation temperatures and column densities. For species\nwith a single detected transition we used an optically thin LTE approximation.\nIn case of species with available collisional rates, we also performed a\nnon-LTE analysis to obtain kinetic temperatures, H2 volume densities, and\ncolumn densities. About 120 lines corresponding to 29 molecules (including\nisotopologues) have been detected in the Herschel/HIFI line survey, including\n11 transitions of CO, 7 transitions of 13CO, 6 transitions of C18O, 10\ntransitions of H2CO, and 6 transitions of H2O. Most species trace kinetic\ntemperatures in the range between 100 and 150 K and H2 volume densities in the\nrange between 10^5 and 10^6 cm^-3. The species with temperatures and / or\ndensities outside of this range include the H2CO transitions tracing a very\nhigh temperature (315 K) and density (1.4x10^6 cm^-3) component and SO\ncorresponding to the lowest temperature (56 K) measured as a part of this line\nsurvey. The observed lines/species reveal a range of physical conditions (gas\ndensity /temperature) involving structures at high density / high pressure,\nobsoleting the traditional 'clump / interclump' picture of the Orion Bar.\n", "  We study the Glashow resonance $\\bar{\\nu}_e + e^- \\rightarrow W^-\n\\rightarrow$ hadrons at 6.3 PeV as diagnostic of the production processes of\nultra-high energy neutrinos. The focus lies on describing the physics of\nneutrino production from pion decay as accurate as possible by including the\nkinematics of weak decays and Monte Carlo simulations of pp and p$\\gamma$\ninteractions. We discuss optically thick (to photohadronic interactions)\nsources, sources of cosmic ray nuclei and muon damped sources. Even in the\nproposed upgrade IceCube-Gen2, a discrimination of scenarios such as pp versus\np$\\gamma$ is extremely challenging under realistic assumptions. Nonetheless,\nthe Glashow resonance can serve as a smoking gun signature of neutrino\nproduction from photohadronic (A$\\gamma$) interactions of heavier nuclei, as\nthe expected Glashow event rate exceeds that of pp interactions. We finally\nquantify the exposures for which the non-observation of Glashow events exerts\npressure on certain scenarios.\n", "  Nonperturbative renormalization group techniques have recently proven a\npowerful tool to tackle the nontrivial infrared dynamics of light scalar fields\nin de Sitter space. In the present article, we develop the formalism beyond the\nlocal potential approximation employed in earlier works. In particular, we\nconsider the derivative expansion, a systematic expansion in powers of field\nderivatives, appropriate for long wavelength modes, that we generalize to the\nrelevant case of a curved metric with Lorentzian signature. The method is\nillustrated with a detailed discussion of the so-called local potential\napproximation prime which, on top of the full effective potential, includes a\nrunning (but field-independent) field renormalization. We explicitly compute\nthe associated anomalous dimension for O(N) theories. We find that it can take\nlarge values along the flow, leading to sizable differences as compared to the\nlocal potential approximation. However, it does not prevent the phenomenon of\ngravitationally induced dimensional reduction pointed out in previous studies.\nWe show that, as a consequence, the effective potential at the end of the flow\nis unchanged as compared to the local potential approximation, the main effect\nof the running anomalous dimension being merely to slow down the flow.\n", "  We study the alignment of galaxies relative to their local environment in\nSDSS-DR8 and, using these data, we discuss evolution scenarios for different\ntypes of galaxies. We defined a vector field of the direction of anisotropy of\nthe local environment of galaxies. We summed the unit direction vectors of all\nclose neighbours of a given galaxy in a particular way to estimate this field.\nWe found the alignment angles between the spin axes of disc galaxies, or the\nminor axes of elliptical galaxies, and the direction of anisotropy. The\ndistributions of cosines of these angles are compared to the random\ndistributions to analyse the alignment of galaxies. Sab galaxies show\nperpendicular alignment relative to the direction of anisotropy in a sparse\nenvironment, for single galaxies and galaxies of low luminosity. Most of the\nparallel alignment of Scd galaxies comes from dense regions, from 2...3 member\ngroups and from galaxies with low luminosity. The perpendicular alignment of S0\ngalaxies does not depend strongly on environmental density nor luminosity; it\nis detected for single and 2...3 member group galaxies, and for main galaxies\nof 4...10 member groups. The perpendicular alignment of elliptical galaxies is\nclearly detected for single galaxies and for members of < 11 member groups; the\nalignment increases with environmental density and luminosity. We confirm the\nexistence of fossil tidally induced alignment of Sab galaxies at low z. The\nalignment of Scd galaxies can be explained via the infall of matter to\nfilaments. S0 galaxies may have encountered relatively massive mergers along\nthe direction of anisotropy. Major mergers along this direction can explain the\nalignment of elliptical galaxies. Less massive, but repeated mergers are\npossibly responsible for the formation of elliptical galaxies in sparser areas\nand for less luminous elliptical galaxies.\n", "  Hybrid semiconductor-superconductor quantum dot devices are tunable physical\nrealizations of quantum impurity models for a magnetic impurity in a\nsuperconducting host. The binding energy of the localized sub-gap Shiba states\nis set by the gate voltages and external magnetic field. In this work we\ndiscuss the effects of the Zeeman spin splitting which is generically present\nboth in the quantum dot and in the (thin-film) superconductor. The unequal\n$g$-factors in semiconductor and superconductor materials result in respective\nZeeman splittings of different magnitude. We consider both classical and\nquantum impurities. In the first case we analytically study the spectral\nfunction and the sub-gap states. The energy of bound states depends on the\nspin-splitting of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands as a simple rigid shift.\nFor the case of collinear magnetization of impurity and host, the Shiba\nresonance of a given spin polarization remains unperturbed when it overlaps\nwith the branch of the quasiparticle excitations of the opposite spin\npolarization. In the quantum case, we employ numerical renormalization group\ncalculations to study the effect of the Zeeman field for different values of\nthe $g$-factors of the impurity and of the superconductor. We find that in\ngeneral the critical magnetic field for the singlet-doublet transition changes\nnon-monotonically as a function of the superconducting gap, demonstrating the\nexistence of two different transition mechanisms: Zeeman splitting of Shiba\nstates or gap closure due to Zeeman splitting of Bogoliubov states. We also\nstudy how in the presence of spin-orbit coupling, modeled as an additional\nnon-collinear component of the magnetic field at the impurity site, the Shiba\nresonance overlapping with the quasiparticle continuum of the opposite spin\ngradually broadens and then merges with the continuum.\n", "  We study a one dimensional Coulomb system, where two charged colloids are\nneutralized by a collection of point counterions, with global neutrality.\nTemperature being given, two situations are addressed: the colloids are either\nkept at fixed positions (canonical ensemble), or the force acting on the\ncolloids is fixed (isobaric-isothermal ensemble). The corresponding partition\nfunctions are worked out exactly, in view of determining which arrangement of\ncounterions is optimal: how many counterions should be in the confined segment\nbetween the colloids? For the remaining ions outside, is there a left/right\nsymmetry breakdown? We evidence a cascade of transitions, as system size is\nvaried in the canonical treatment, or as pressure is increased in the isobaric\nformulation.\n", "  Long-term BVRI photometric light curves of the pre-main sequence stars V977\nCep and V982 Cep during the period from 2000 October to 2016 August are\npresented. The stars are located in the vicinity of the reflection nebula NGC\n7129. Our photometric data show that both stars exhibit strong photometric\nvariability in all optical passbands, which is typical for Classical T Tauri\nstars. Using our observational data we analyze the reasons for the observed\nbrightness variations. In the case of V977 Cep we identify previously unknown\nperiodicity in its light curve.\n", "  In light of recent observational results indicating an apparent lack of\ncorrelation between the Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) and mid-infrared\nemission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), we assess whether\nrotational emission from spinning silicate and/or iron nanoparticles could\naccount for the observed AME without violating observational constraints on\ninterstellar abundances, ultraviolet extinction, and infrared emission. By\nmodifying the SpDust code to compute the rotational emission from these grains,\nwe find that nanosilicate grains could account for the entirety of the observed\nAME, whereas iron grains could be responsible for only a fraction, even for\nextreme assumptions on the amount of interstellar iron concentrated in\nultrasmall iron nanoparticles. Given the added complexity of contributions from\nmultiple grain populations to the total spinning dust emission, as well as\nexisting uncertainties due to the poorly-constrained grain size, charge, and\ndipole moment distributions, we discuss generic, carrier-independent\npredictions of spinning dust theory and observational tests that could help\nidentify the AME carrier(s).\n", "  Certain models with rank-$3$ tensor degrees of freedom have been shown by\nGurau and collaborators to possess a novel large $N$ limit, where $g^2 N^3$ is\nheld fixed. In this limit the perturbative expansion in the quartic coupling\nconstant, $g$, is dominated by a special class of \"melon\" diagrams. We study\n\"uncolored\" models of this type, which contain a single copy of real rank-$3$\ntensor. Its three indexes are distinguishable; therefore, the models possess\n$O(N)^3$ symmetry with the tensor field transforming in the tri-fundamental\nrepresentation. Such uncolored models also possess the large $N$ limit\ndominated by the melon diagrams. The quantum mechanics of a real anti-commuting\ntensor therefore has a similar large $N$ limit to the model recently introduced\nby Witten as an implementation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which does\nnot require disorder. Gauging the $O(N)^3$ symmetry in our quantum mechanical\nmodel removes the non-singlet states; therefore, one can search for its\nwell-defined gravity dual. We point out, however, that the model possesses a\nvast number of gauge-invariant operators involving higher powers of the tensor\nfield, suggesting that the complete gravity dual will be intricate. We also\ndiscuss the quantum mechanics of a complex 3-index anti-commuting tensor, which\nhas $U(N)^2\\times O(N)$ symmetry and argue that it is equivalent in the large\n$N$ limit to a version of SYK model with complex fermions. Finally, we discuss\nsimilar models of a commuting tensor in dimension $d$. While the quartic\ninteraction is not positive definite, we construct the large $N$\nSchwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function and show that its solution\nis consistent with conformal invariance. We carry out a perturbative check of\nthis result using the $4-\\epsilon$ expansion.\n", "  In this paper we study the coarsening dynamics of a spinor condensate\nquenched into an easy-axis ferromagnetic phase by a sudden change in the\nquadratic Zeeman energy. We show that applying a spin rotation prior to\nchanging the Zeeman energy accelerates the development of local order and\nreduces heating. We examine the longitudinal spin ordering and the superfluid\nordering of the system and show that the respective order parameter correlation\nfunctions exhibit dynamic scaling in the late time dynamics. Our results also\ndemonstrate that these two types of order grow at different rates, i.e.~with\ndifferent dynamic critical exponents. The spin domain area distribution is\ncalculated and is shown to have power law scaling behavior expected from\npercolation theory.\n", "  We use a simple organism lifecycle model to explore the viability of an\natmospheric habitable zone (AHZ), with temperatures that could support\nEarth-centric life, which sits above an environment that does not support life.\nTo illustrate our model we use a cool Y dwarf atmosphere, such as\n$\\mathrm{WISE~J}085510.83-0714442.5$ whose $4.5-5.2$ micron spectrum shows\nabsorption features consistent with water vapour and clouds. We allow organisms\nto adapt to their atmospheric environment (described by temperature,\nconvection, and gravity) by adopting different growth strategies that maximize\ntheir chance of survival and proliferation. We assume a constant upward\nvertical velocity through the AHZ. We found that the organism growth strategy\nis most sensitive to the magnitude of the atmospheric convection. Stronger\nconvection supports the evolution of more massive organisms. For a purely\nradiative environment we find that evolved organisms have a mass that is an\norder of magnitude smaller than terrestrial microbes, thereby defining a\ndynamical constraint on the dimensions of life that an AHZ can support. Based\non a previously defined statistical approach we infer that there are of order\n$10^9$ cool Y brown dwarfs in the Milky Way, and likely a few tens of these\nobjects are within ten parsecs from Earth. Our work also has implications for\nexploring life in the atmospheres of temperate gas giants. Consideration of the\nhabitable volumes in planetary atmospheres significantly increases the volume\nof habitable space in the galaxy.\n", "  This study presents the temporal and spectral analysis of the prompt emission\nof two high-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), 120521C at $z\\sim6$ and 130606A\nat $z\\sim5.91$, which were performed using the Swift-XRT/BAT and the Suzaku-WAM\nsimultaneously. Based on follow-up XRT observations, the longest durations of\nthe prompt emissions were approximately $80$ s (120521C) and $360$ s (130606A)\nin the rest frame of each GRB, which are categorized as long-duration GRBs, but\nare insufficiently long compared with the predicted duration of GRBs that\noriginate from first-generation stars. Because of the wide bandpass of the\ninstruments covering the ranges of 15 keV--5 MeV (BAT-WAM) and 0.3 keV--5.0 MeV\n(XRT-BAT-WAM), we successfully determined the $\\nu F_{\\nu}$ peak energies\n$E_{\\rm peak}^{\\rm src}$ of $682^{+845}_{-207}$ keV and $1209^{+553}_{-304}$\nkeV in the rest frame, and the isotropic-equivalent radiated energies $E_{\\rm\niso}$ of $(8.25^{+2.24}_{-1.96})\\times10^{52}$ erg and\n$(2.82^{+0.17}_{-0.71})\\times10^{53}$ erg, respectively. These obtained\ncharacteristic parameters are in accordance with the well-known relation\nbetween $E_{\\rm peak}^{\\rm src}$ and $E_{\\rm iso}$ (Amati relation). In\naddition, we examined the relations between $E_{\\rm peak}^{\\rm src}$ and the\n1-s peak luminosity, $L_{\\rm p}$, or the geometrical corrected radiated energy,\n$E_{\\gamma}$, and confirmed the $E_{\\rm peak}^{\\rm src}$-$L_{\\rm p}$ (Yonetoku)\nand $E_{\\rm peak}^{\\rm src}$-$E_{\\gamma}$ (Ghirlanda) relations. The results\nimplied that these high-redshift GRBs at $z\\sim6$, expected as having radiated\nfrom the reionization epoch, have similar properties as that of X-ray prompt\nemission with low-redshift GRBs.\n", "  We investigate the physical conditions of the gas, atomic and molecular, in\nthe filaments in the context of Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) using the\nKOSMA-PDR mode of clumpy clouds. We also compare the [CII] vs. [NII] integrated\nintensity predictions in Abel et al. 2005 for HII regions and adjacent PDRs in\nthe Galactic disk, and check for their applicability under the extreme physical\nconditions present in the GC. Our preliminary results show that observed\nintegrated intensities are well reproduced by the PDR model. The gas is exposed\nto a relatively low Far-UV field between 10^2 - 10^3 Draine fields. The total\nvolume hydrogen density is well constrained between 10^4 - 10^5 cm^-3. The\nhydrogen ionization rate due to cosmic-rays varies between 10^-15 and 4x10^-15\ns^-1, with the highest value ~ 10^-14 s^-1 found towards G0.07+0.04. Our\nresults show that the line-of-sight contribution to the total distance of the\nfilaments to the Arches Cluster is not negligible. The spatial distribution of\nthe [CII]/[NII] ratio shows that the integrated intensity ratios are fairly\nhomogeneously distributed for values below 10 in energy units. Calculations\nincluding variation on the [C/N] abundance ratio show that tight constraints on\nthis ratio are needed to reproduce the observations.\n", "  The AMS-02 has measured the cosmic ray electron (plus positron) spectrum up\nto ~TeV with an unprecedent precision. The spectrum can be well described by a\npower law without any obvious features above 10 GeV. The satellite instrument\nDark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE), which was launched a year ago, will\nmeasure the electron spectrum up to 10 TeV with a high energy resolution. The\ncosmic electrons beyond TeV may be attributed to few local cosmic ray sources,\nsuch as supernova remnants. Therefore, spectral features, such as cutoff and\nbumps, can be expected at high energies. In this work we give a careful study\non the perspective of the electron spectrum beyond TeV. We first examine our\nastrophysical source models on the latest leptonic data of AMS-02 to give a\nself-consistent picture. Then we focus on the discussion about the candidate\nsources which could be electron contributors above TeV. Depending on the\nproperties of the local sources (especially on the nature of Vela), DAMPE may\ndetect interesting features in the electron spectrum above TeV in the future.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations of stellar interactions require stable models of\nstars as initial conditions. Such initial models, however, are difficult to\nconstruct for giant stars because of the wide range in spatial scales of the\nhydrostatic equilibrium and in dynamical timescales between the core and the\nenvelope of the giant. They are needed for, e.g., modeling the common envelope\nphase where a giant envelope encompasses both the giant core and a companion\nstar. Here, we present a new method of approximating and reconstructing giant\nprofiles from a stellar evolution code to produce stable models for\nmulti-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We determine typical stellar\nstratification profiles with the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. After an\nappropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the\ncore of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation\nof the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that\ncan specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping\nto a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities\nyields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially\nconvectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while\nfor stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution\ncode, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and\nshow large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8. Examples are shown\nfor a $2M_\\odot$ red giant and a $0.67M_\\odot$ asymptotic giant branch star. A\ndetailed analysis shows that the improved method reliably provides stable\nmodels of giant envelopes that can be used as initial conditions for subsequent\nhydrodynamical simulations of stellar interactions involving giant stars.\n", "  Aims: We present the first measurement of the proper motion and orbit of the\nvery distant and intriguing globular cluster NCG 2419. Methods: We have\ncombined data from HST and Gaia DR1 to derive the relative proper motions of\nstars in the direction to the cluster. To tie to an absolute reference frame we\nhave used a background galaxy located in the field. Results: We find the\nabsolute proper motion of NGC 2419 to be $(\\mu_{\\alpha}\\cos(\\delta)$,\n$\\mu_{\\delta}$)=($-0.17\\pm0.26,-0.49\\pm0.17$) mas/yr. We have integrated the\norbit of the cluster in a Galactic potential and found it to oscillate between\n$\\sim$53 kpc and $\\sim$98 kpc on a nearly polar orbit. This makes it very\nlikely that NGC 2419 is a former cluster of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxy, also because it shares the same sense of rotation around the Milky Way.\n", "  In this article we provide a a general analysis of canonical quantization for\npolaritons in dispersive and dissipative electromagnetic media. We compare\nseveral approaches based either on the Huttner Barnett model [B. Huttner, S. M.\nBarnett, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{46}, 4306 (1992)] or the Green function, Langevin\nnoise method [T. Gruner, D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{53}, 1818 (1996)]\nwhich includes only material oscillators as fundamental variables. We show in\norder to preserve unitarity, causality and time symmetry one must necessarily\ninclude with an equal footing both electromagnetic modes and material\nfluctuations on the evolution equations. This becomes particularly relevant for\nall nanophotonics and plasmonics problems involving spatially localized\nantennas or devices.\n", "  There is a linear relation between the mass of dense gas, traced by the\nHCN(1-0) luminosity, and the star formation rate (SFR), traced by the\nfar-infrared luminosity. Recent observations of galactic disks have shown some\nsystematic variations. In order to explore the SFR-dense gas link at high\nresolution ($\\sim 4\"$, $\\sim 150$ pc) in the outer disk of an external galaxy,\nwe have mapped a region about 5 kpc from the center along the northern spiral\narm of M51 in the HCN(1-0), HCO$^+$(1-0) and HNC(1-0) emission lines using the\nNorthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometer. The HCN and HCO$^+$\nlines were detected in 6 giant molecular associations (GMAs) while HNC emission\nwas only detected in the two brightest GMAs. One of the GMAs hosts a powerful\nHII region and HCN is stronger than HCO$^+$ there. Comparing with observations\nof GMAs in the disks of M31 and M33 at similar angular resolution ($\\sim 100$\npc), we find that GMAs in the outer disk of M51 are brighter in both HCN and\nHCO$^+$ lines by a factor of 3 on average. However, the $I_{HCN}/I_{CO}$ and\n$I_{HCO^+}/I_{CO}$ ratios are similar to the ratios in nearby galactic disks\nand the Galactic plane. Using the Herschel 70 $\\mu$m data to trace the total IR\nluminosity at the resolution of the GMAs, we find that both the\nL$_{IR}$-L$_{HCN}$ and L$_{IR}$-L$_{HCO^+}$ relations in the outer disk GMAs\nare consistent with the proportionality between the L$_{IR}$ and the dense gas\nmass established globally in galaxies within the scatter. The IR/HCN and\nIR/HCO$^+$ ratios of the GMAs vary by a factor of 3, probably depending on\nwhether massive stars are forming or not.\n", "  To study the full counting statistics of quantum heat transfer in a driven\nnonequilibrium spin-boson model, we develop a generalized nonequilibrium\npolaron-transformed Redfield equation with an auxiliary counting field. This\nenables us to study the impact of qubit-bath coupling ranging from weak to\nstrong regimes. Without external modulations, we observe maximal values of both\nsteady state heat flux and noise power at moderate coupling regimes, below\nwhich we find those two transport quantities are enhanced by the finite qubit\nenergy bias. With external modulations, the geometric-phase-induced heat flux\nshows monotonic decrease as increasing the qubit-bath coupling at zero qubit\nenergy bias (without bias). While under finite qubit energy bias (with bias),\nthe geometric-phase-induced heat flux exhibits an interesting reversal behavior\nin strong coupling regime. Our results unify the seemingly contradictory\nresults in weak and strong qubit-bath coupling regimes, and provide detailed\ndissections for the quantum fluctuation of nonequilibrium heat transfer.\n", "  The evolution of HII regions/supershells can trigger a new generation of\nstars/clusters at their peripheries, with environmental conditions that may\naffect the initial mass function, disk evolution and star formation efficiency.\nIn this paper we study the stellar content and star formation processes in the\nyoung cluster Stock 8, which itself is thought to be formed during the\nexpansion of a supershell. We present deep optical photometry along with JHK\nand 3.6, 4.5 {\\mu}m photometry from UKIDSS and Spitzer-IRAC. We use multi-color\ncriteria to identify the candidate young stellar objects in the region. Using\nevolutionary models, we obtain a median log(age) of ~6.5 (~3.0 Myr) with an\nobserved age spread of ~0.25 dex for the cluster. Monte Carlo simulations of\nthe population of Stock 8, based on estimates for the photometric uncertainty,\ndifferential reddening, binarity, and variability, indicate that these\nuncertainties introduce an age spread of ~0.15 dex. The intrinsic age spread in\nthe cluster is ~0.2 dex. The fraction of young stellar objects surrounded by\ndisk is ~35%. The K-band luminosity function of Stock 8 is similar to that of\nthe Trapezium cluster. The IMF of Stock 8 has a Salpeter- like slope at >0.5\nMsun and the IMF flattens and peaks at ~0.4 Msun, below which declines into the\nsubstellar regime. Although Stock 8 is surrounded by several massive stars,\nthere seems to be no severe environmental effect in the form of IMF due to the\nproximity of massive stars around the cluster.\n", "  The magnetic correlations within the cuprates have undergone intense scrutiny\nas part of efforts to understand high temperature superconductivity. We explore\nthe evolution of the magnetic correlations along the nodal direction of the\nBrillouin zone in La2-xSrxCuO4, spanning the doping phase diagram from the\nanti-ferromagnetic Mott insulator at x = 0 to the metallic phase at x = 0.26.\nMagnetic excitations along this direction are found to be systematically\nsoftened and broadened with doping, at a higher rate than the excitations along\nthe anti-nodal direction. This phenomenology is discussed in terms of the\nnature of the magnetism in the doped cuprates. Survival of the high energy\nmagnetic excitations, even in the overdoped regime, indicates that these\nexcitations are marginal to pairing, while the influence of the low energy\nexcitations remains ambiguous.\n", "  For photoionized plasmas, electron energy-loss rates due to radiative\nrecombination (RR) are required for thermal equilib- rium calculations, which\nassume a local balance between the energy gain and loss. While many\ncalculations of total and/or partial RR rates are available from literature,\nspecific calculations of associated RR electron energy-loss rates are lacking.\nHere we focus on electron energy-loss rates due to radiative recombination of\nH-like to Ne-like ions for all the elements up to and including zinc (Z = 30),\nover a wide temperature range. We use the AUTOSTRUCTURE code to calculate the\nlevel-resolved photoionization cross section and modify the ADASRR code so that\nwe can simultaneously obtain level-resolved RR rate coefficients and associated\nRR electron energy-loss rate coefficients. The total RR rates and electron\nenergy-loss rates of H i and He i are compared with those found in literature.\nFurthermore, we utilize and parameterize the weighted electron energy-loss\nfactors (dimensionless) to characterize total electron energy-loss rates due to\nRR. The RR electron energy-loss data are archived according to the Atomic Data\nand Analysis Structure (ADAS) data class adf48. The RR electron energy-loss\ndata are also incorporated into the SPEX code for detailed modelling of\nphotoionized plamsas.\n", "  We consider the problems of maximizing the entanglement negativity of X-form\nqubit-qutrit density matrices with (i) a fixed spectrum and (ii) a fixed\npurity. In the first case, the problem is solved in full generality whereas, in\nthe latter, partial solutions are obtained by imposing extra spectral\nconstraints such as rank-deficiency and degeneracy, which enable a semidefinite\nprogramming treatment for the optimization problem at hand. Despite the\ntechnically-motivated assumptions, we provide strong numerical evidence that\nthree-fold degenerate X states of purity $P$ reach the highest entanglement\nnegativity accessible to arbitrary qubit-qutrit density matrices of the same\npurity, hence characterizing a sparse family of likely qubit-qutrit maximally\nentangled mixed states.\n", "  A two dimensional (2D) percolation transition in Fe/W(110) ultrathin magnetic\nfilms occurs when islands in the second atomic layer percolate and resolve a\nfrustrated magnetic state to produce long-range in-plane ferromagnetic order.\nNovel measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\\chi(\\theta)$ as the films\nare deposited at a constant temperature, allow the long-range percolation\ntransition to be observed as a sharp peak consistent with a critical phase\ntransition. The measurements are used to trace the\nparamagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase boundary between the $T=0$ percolation\nmagnetic transition and the thermal Curie magnetic transition of the undiluted\nfilm. A quantitative comparison to critical scaling theory is made by fitting\nthe functional form of the phase boundary. The fitted parameters are then used\nin theoretical expressions for $\\chi(T)$ in the critical region of the\nparamagnetic state to provide an excellent, independent representation of the\nexperimental measurements.\n", "  In an isolated single-particle quantum system a spatial disorder can induce\nAnderson localization. Being a result of interference, this phenomenon is\nexpected to be fragile in the face of dissipation. Here we show that\ndissipation can drive a disordered system into a steady state with tunable\nlocalization properties. This can be achieved with a set of identical\ndissipative operators, each one acting non-trivially only on a pair of\nneighboring sites. Operators are parametrized by a uniform phase, which\ncontrols selection of Anderson modes contributing to the state. On the\nmicroscopic level, quantum trajectories of a system in a localized steady\nregime exhibit intermittent dynamics consisting of long-time sticking events\nnear selected modes interrupted by jumps between them.\n", "  We report an initial experimental survey of spin-Hall torques generated by\nthe rare-earth metals Gd, Dy, Ho, and Lu, along with comparisons to\nfirst-principles calculations of their spin Hall conductivities. Using spin\ntorque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) measurements and DC-biased ST-FMR, we\nestimate lower bounds for the spin-Hall torque ratio, $\\xi_{SH}$, of $\\approx$\n0.04 for Gd, $\\approx$ 0.05 for Dy, $\\approx$ 0.14 for Ho, and $\\approx$ 0.014\nfor Lu. The variations among these elements are qualitatively consistent with\nresults from first principles (density functional theory, DFT, in the local\ndensity approximation with a Hubbard-U correction). The DFT calculations\nindicate that the spin Hall conductivity is enhanced by the presence of the\npartially-filled $f$ orbitals in Dy and Ho, which suggests a strategy to\nfurther strengthen the contribution of the $f$ orbitals to the spin Hall effect\nby shifting the electron chemical potential.\n", "  Two-point correlation functions are ubiquitous tools of modern cosmology,\nappearing in disparate topics ranging from cosmological inflation to late-time\nastrophysics. When the background spacetime is maximally symmetric, invariance\narguments can be used to fix the functional dependence of this function as the\ninvariant distance between any two points. In this paper we introduce a novel\nformalism which fixes this functional dependence directly from the isometries\nof the background metric, thus allowing one to quickly assess the overall\nfeatures of Gaussian correlators without resorting to the full machinery of\nperturbation theory. As an application we construct the CMB temperature\ncorrelation function in one inhomogeneous (namely, an off-center LTB model) and\ntwo spatially flat and anisotropic (Bianchi) universes, and derive their\ncovariance matrices in the limit of almost Friedmannian symmetry. We show how\nthe method can be extended to arbitrary N -point correlation functions and\nillustrate its use by constructing three-point correlation functions in some\nsimple geometries.\n", "  We collected the multiplicity data of stars in Taurus to build an up-to-date\nstellar/multiplicity catalog. After a general study of nearest-neighbor\nstatistics on spatial random distribution, we introduce the one-point\ncorrelation $\\Psi$ function to complement the pair correlation function and\ndefine the spatial regimes departing from randomness in Taurus. We then perform\na set of statistical studies to characterize the binary regime that prevails in\nTaurus. The $\\Psi$ function in Taurus has a scale-free trend with a similar\nexponent as the correlation function at small scale. It extends almost 3\ndecades up to $\\sim 60$ kAU showing a potential extended wide binary regime.\nThis was hidden in the correlation function due to the clustering pattern\nblending. Distinguishing two stellar populations, single stars versus multiple\nsystems (separation $ \\leq 1$ kAU), within Class II/III stars observed at high\nangular resolution, we highlight a major spatial neighborhood difference\nbetween the two populations using nearest-neighbor statistics. The multiple\nsystems are three times more likely to have a distant companion within 10 kAU\nwhen compared to single stars. We show that this is due to the presence of most\nprobable physical ultra-wide pairs. These UWPs are biased towards high\nmultiplicity and higher-stellar-mass components at shorter separations. The\nmultiplicity fraction per ultra-wide pair with separation less than 10 kAU may\nbe as high as 83.5 $\\pm$ 19.6\\%. We suggest that these young pre-main sequence\nUWPs may be pristine imprints of their spatial configuration at birth resulting\nfrom a cascade fragmentation scenario of the natal molecular core. They could\nbe the older counterparts, at least for those separated by less than 10 kAU, to\nthe $\\le$ 0.5 Myr prestellar cores/Class 0 multiple objects observed at\nradio/mm wavelengths.\n", "  We study the small scale clustering of gyrotactic swimmers transported by a\nturbulent flow, when the intrinsic variability of the swimming parameters\nwithin the population is considered. By means of extensive numerical\nsimulations, we find that the variety of the population introduces a\ncharacteristic scale $R^*$ in its spatial distribution. At scales smaller than\n$R^*$ the swimmers are homogeneously distributed, while at larger scales an\ninhomogeneous distribution is observed with a fractal dimension close to what\nobserved for a monodisperse population characterized by mean parameters. The\nscale $R^*$ depends on the dispersion of the population and it is found to\nscale linearly with the standard deviation both for a bimodal and for a\nGaussian distribution. Our numerical results, which extend recent findings for\na monodisperse population, indicate that in principle it is possible to observe\nsmall scale, fractal clustering in a laboratory experiment with gyrotactic\ncells.\n", "  Decays of the $\\Xi_b^-$ and $\\Omega_b^-$ baryons to the charmless final\nstates $p h^{-}h^{\\prime -}$, where $h^{(\\prime)}$ denotes a kaon or pion, are\nsearched for with the LHCb detector. The analysis is based on a sample of\nproton-proton collision data collected at centre-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s} =\n7$ and $8 TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3 {\\rm fb}^{-1}$.\nThe decay $\\Xi_b^- \\to p K^-K^-$ is observed with a significance of $8.7$\nstandard deviations, and evidence at the level of $3.4$ standard deviations is\nfound for the $\\Xi_b^- \\to p K^-\\pi^-$ decay. Results are reported, relative to\nthe $B^-\\to K^+K^-K^-$ normalisation channel, for the products of branching\nfractions and $b$-hadron production fractions. The branching fractions of\n$\\Xi_b^- \\to p K^-\\pi^-$ and $\\Xi_b^- \\to p \\pi^-\\pi^-$ relative to $\\Xi_b^-\n\\to p K^-K^-$ decays are also measured.\n", "  We extend our analysis of the implications of hadronic supersymmetry for\nheavy-light hadrons in light-front holographic QCD. Although conformal symmetry\nis strongly broken by the heavy quark mass, supersymmetry and the holographic\nembedding of semiclassical light-front dynamics derived from five-dimensional\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) space nevertheless determines the form of the confining\npotential in the light-front Hamiltonian to be harmonic. The resulting\nlight-front bound-state equations lead to a heavy-light Regge-like spectrum for\nboth mesons and baryons. The confinement hadron mass scale and their Regge\nslopes depend, however, on the mass of the heavy quark in the meson or baryon\nas expected from Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). This procedure reproduces\nthe observed spectra of heavy-light hadrons with good precision and makes\npredictions for yet unobserved states.\n", "  We report new spectroscopic and photometric observations of the\nmain-sequence, detached, eccentric, double-lined eclipsing binary V541 Cyg (P =\n15.34 days, e = 0.468). Using these observations together with existing\nmeasurements we determine the component masses and radii to better than 1%\nprecision: M1 = 2.335 +0.017/-0.013 MSun, M2 = 2.260 +0.016/-0.013 MSun, R1 =\n1.859 +0.012/-0.009 RSun, and R2 = 1.808 +0.015/-0.013 RSun. The nearly\nidentical B9.5 stars have estimated temperatures of 10650 +/- 200 K and 10350\n+/- 200 K. A comparison of these properties with current stellar evolution\nmodels shows excellent agreement at an age of about 190 Myr and [Fe/H]\napproximately -0.18. Both components are found to be rotating at the\npseudo-synchronous rate. The system displays a slow periastron advance that is\ndominated by General Relativity (GR), and has previously been claimed to be\nslower than predicted by theory. Our new measurement, dw/dt = 0.859\n+0.042/-0.017 deg/century, has an 88% contribution from GR and agrees with the\nexpected rate within the uncertainties. We also clarify the use of the gravity\ndarkening coefficients in the light-curve fitting program EBOP, a version of\nwhich we use here.\n", "  We perform an exotic dualization of the Ramond-Ramond fields in type II\ndouble field theory, in which they are encoded in a Majorana-Weyl spinor of\nO(D,D). Starting from a first-order master action, the dual theory in terms of\na tensor-spinor of O(D,D) is determined. This tensor-spinor is subject to an\nexotic version of the (self-)duality constraint needed for a democratic\nformulation. We show that in components, reducing O(D,D) to GL(D), one obtains\nthe expected exotically dual theory in terms of mixed Young tableaux fields. To\nthis end, we generalize exotic dualizations to self-dual fields, such as the\n4-form in type IIB string theory.\n", "  The single-particle Green's function (GF) of mesoscopic structures plays a\ncentral role in mesoscopic quantum transport. The recursive GF technique is a\nstandard tool to compute this quantity numerically, but it lacks physical\ntransparency and is limited to relatively small systems. Here we present a\nnumerically efficient and physically transparent GF formalism for a general\nlayered structure. In contrast to the recursive GF that directly calculates the\nGF through the Dyson equations, our approach converts the calculation of the GF\nto the generation and subsequent propagation of a scattering wave function\nemanating from a local excitation. This viewpoint not only allows us to\nreproduce existing results in a concise and physically intuitive manner, but\nalso provides analytical expressions of the GF in terms of a generalized\nscattering matrix. This identifies the contributions from each individual\nscattering channel to the GF and hence allows this information to be extracted\nquantitatively from dual-probe STM experiments. The simplicity and physical\ntransparency of the formalism further allows us to treat the multiple\nreflection analytically and derive an analytical rule to construct the GF of a\ngeneral layered system. This could significantly reduce the computational time\nand enable quantum transport calculations for large samples. We apply this\nformalism to perform both analytical analysis and numerical simulation for the\ntwo-dimensional conductance map of a realistic graphene p-n junction. The\nresults demonstrate the possibility of observing the spatially-resolved\ninterference pattern caused by negative refraction and further reveal a few\ninteresting features, such as the distance-independent conductance and its\nquadratic dependence on the carrier concentration, as opposed to the linear\ndependence in uniform graphene.\n", "  A spacetime interpretation of deformed relativity symmetry groups was\nrecently proposed by resorting to Finslerian geometries, seen as the outcome of\na continuous limit endowed with first order corrections from the quantum\ngravity regime. In this work we further investigate such connection between\ndeformed algebras and Finslerian geometries by showing that the Finsler\ngeometries associated to the generalisation of the Poincar\\'{e} group (the so\ncalled $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'{e} Hopf algebra) are maximally symmetric spacetimes\nwhich are also of the Berwald type: Finslerian spacetimes for which the\nconnections are substantially Riemannian, belonging to the unique class for\nwhich the weak equivalence principle still holds. We also extend this analysis\nby considering a generalization of the de Sitter group (the so called $q$-de\nSitter group) and showing that its associated Finslerian geometry reproduces\nlocally the one from the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'{e} group and that itself can be\nrecast in a Berwald form in an appropriate limit.\n", "  We present a combined morphological and X-ray analysis of Was 49, an\nisolated, dual AGN system notable for the presence of a dominant AGN Was 49b in\nthe disk of the primary galaxy Was 49a, at a projected radial distance of 8 kpc\nfrom the nucleus. Using X-ray data from Chandra, NuSTAR, and Swift, we find\nthat this AGN has a bolometric luminosity of L_bol ~ 2 x 10^45 erg/s, with a\nblack hole mass of M_BH=1.3^{+2.9}_{-0.9} x 10^8 M_Sol. Despite its large mass,\nour analysis of optical data from the Discovery Channel Telescope shows that\nthe supermassive black hole is hosted by a stellar counterpart with a mass of\nonly 5.6^{+4.9}_{-2.6} x 10^9 M_Sol, making the SMBH potentially larger than\nexpected from SMBH-galaxy scaling relations, and the stellar counterpart\nexhibits a morphology that is consistent with dwarf elliptical galaxies. Our\nanalysis of the system in the r and K bands indicates that Was 49 is a minor\nmerger, with a mass ratio of Was 49a to Was 49b between 1:7 and 1:15. This is\nin contrast with findings that the most luminous merger-triggered AGNs are\nfound in major mergers, and that minor mergers predominantly enhance AGN\nactivity in the primary galaxy.\n", "  Recent studies indicate that the configurational entropy is an useful tool to\ninvestigate the stability and (or) the relative dominance of states for diverse\nphysical systems. Recent examples comprise the connection between the variation\nof this quantity and the relative fraction of light mesons and glueballs\nobserved in hadronic processes. Here we develop a technique for defining a\nconfigurational entropy for an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. The achieved\nresult corroborates consistency with the Hawking-Page phase transition. Namely,\nthe dominance of the black hole configurational entropy will be shown to\nincrease with the temperature. In order to verify the consistency of the new\nprocedure developed here, we also consider the case of black holes in flat\nspace-time. For such a black hole, it is known that evaporation leads to\ninstability. The configurational entropy obtained for the flat space case is\nthoroughly consistent with the physical expectation. In fact, we show that the\nsmaller the black holes, the more unstable they are. So, the configurational\nentropy furnishes a reliable measure for stability of black holes.\n", "  Taking advantage of the fact that the flavor of the neutrino in semileptonic\n$B$ decays $B\\to D^{(*)}\\tau\\nu$ is not known, we show how a minimal set of\nhigher-dimensional lepton flavor violating (LFV) operators can explain the\n$R(D^{(*)})$ anomalies, and as a spin-off, can give rise to the LFV decay of\nthe Higgs boson, $h\\to\\mu\\tau$. We also show how none but the minimal set of\noperators survive the present data.\n", "  The structural and energetic properties of layered materials propose a\nchallenge to density functional theory with common semilocal approximations to\nthe exchange-correlation. By combining the most-widely used semilocal\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA), Perdew--Burke--Ernzerhof (PBE), with\nthe revised Vydrov--Van Voorhis non-local correlation functional (rVV10), both\nexcellent structural and energetic properties of 28 layered materials were\nrecovered with a judicious parameter selection. We term the resulting\nfunctional as PBE+rVV10L with \"L\" denoting for layered materials. Such\ncombination is not new, and involves only refitting a single global parameter,\nhowever the resulting excellency suggests such corrected PBE for many aspects\nof theoretical studies on layered materials. For comparison, we also present\nthe results for PBE+rVV10 where the parameter is determined by the 22\ninteraction energies between molecules.\n", "  We discuss and test possible evolutionary connections between Blue Compact\nDwarf galaxies (BCDs) and other types of dwarf galaxies. BCDs provide ideal\nlaboratories to study intense star formation episodes in low mass dwarf\ngalaxies, and have sometimes been considered a short-lived evolutionary stage\nbetween types of dwarf galaxies. To test these connections, we consider a\nsample of BCDs as well as a comparison sample of nearby galaxies from the Local\nVolume Legacy (LVL) survey for context. We fit the multi-wavelength spectral\nenergy distributions (SED, far-ultra-violet to far-infrared) of each galaxy\nwith a grid of theoretical models to determine their stellar masses and star\nformation properties. We compare our results for BCDs with the LVL galaxies to\nput BCDs in the context of normal galaxy evolution. The SED fits demonstrate\nthat the star formation events currently underway in BCDs are at the extreme of\nthe continuum of normal dwarf galaxies, both in terms of the relative mass\ninvolved and in the relative increase over previous star formation rates.\nToday's BCDs are distinctive objects in a state of extreme star formation which\nis rapidly transforming them. This study also suggests ways to identify former\nBCDs whose star formation episodes have since faded.\n", "  Continuing work initiated in an earlier publication [Ishihara, Suzuki, Ono,\nKitamura, Asada, Phys. Rev. D {\\bf 94}, 084015 (2016) ], we discuss a method of\ncalculating the bending angle of light in a static, spherically symmetric and\nasymptotically flat spacetime, especially by taking account of the finite\ndistance from a lens object to a light source and a receiver. For this purpose,\nwe use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to define the bending angle of light, such that\nthe definition can be valid also in the strong deflection limit. Finally, this\nmethod is applied to Schwarzschild spacetime in order to discuss also possible\nobservational implications. The proposed corrections for Sgr A$^{\\ast}$ for\ninstance are able to amount to $\\sim 10^{-5}$ arcseconds for some parameter\nrange, which may be within the capability of near-future astronomy, while also\nthe correction for the Sun in the weak field limit is $\\sim 10^{-5}$\narcseconds.\n", "  The perovskite Ba8CoNb6O24 comprises equilateral effective spin-1/2 Co2+\ntriangular layers separated by six non-magnetic layers. Susceptibility,\nspecific heat and neutron scattering measurements combined with\nhigh-temperature series expansions and spin-wave calculations confirm that\nBa8CoNb6O24 is basically a twodimensional (2D) magnet with no detectable spin\nanisotropy and no long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.06 K. In other words,\nBa8CoNb6O24 is very close to be a realization of the paradigmatic spin-1/2\ntriangular Heisenberg model, which is not expected to exhibit symmetry breaking\nat finite temperature according to the Mermin and Wagner theorem.\n", "  It was recently revealed that a rotating compact body responds dynamically\nwhen it is subjected to a gravitomagnetic tidal field, even when this field is\nidealized as time-independent. The dynamical response is characterized by\ntime-changing internal currents, and it was suspected to originate from\nzero-frequency g-modes and r-modes driven by the tidal forces. In this paper we\nprovide additional insights into the phenomenon by examining the tidal response\nof a rotating body within the framework of post-Newtonian gravity. This\napproach allows us to develop an intuitive picture for the phenomenon, which\nrelies on the close analogy between post-Newtonian gravity and Maxwell's theory\nof electromagnetism. In this picture, the coupling between the gravitomagnetic\ntidal field and the body's rotational velocity is naturally expected to produce\nan unbalanced Lorentz-like force within the body, and it is this force that is\nresponsible for the tidal currents. The simplicity of the fluid equations in\nthe post-Newtonian setting allows us to provide a complete description of the\nzero-frequency modes and demonstrate their precise role in the establishment of\nthe tidal currents. We estimate the amplitude of these currents, and find that\nfor neutron-star binaries of relevance to LIGO, the scale of the velocity\nperturbation is measured in kilometers per second when the rotation period is\ncomparable to 100 milliseconds. This estimate indicates that the tidal currents\nmay have a significant impact on the physics of neutron stars near merger.\n", "  Weak value amplification (WVA) is a technique in which one can magnify the\napparent strength of a measurement signal. Some have claimed that WVA can\noutperform more conventional measurement schemes in parameter estimation.\nNonetheless, a significant body of theoretical work has challenged this\nperspective, suggesting WVA to be fundamentally sub-optimal. Optimal\nmeasurements may not be practical, however. Two practical considerations that\nhave been conjectured to afford a benefit to WVA over conventional measurement\nare certain types of noise and detector saturation. Here, we report a\ntheoretical study of the role of saturation and pixel noise in WVA-based\nmeasurement, in which we carry out a Bayesian analysis of the Fisher\ninformation available using a saturable, pixelated, digitized, and/or noisy\ndetector. We draw two conclusions: first, that saturation alone does not confer\nan advantage to the WVA approach over conventional measurement, and second,\nthat WVA can outperform conventional measurement when saturation is combined\nwith intrinsic pixel noise and/or digitization.\n", "  We present a general method to account for full colour dependence Yang-Mills\namplitudes at loop level. The method fits most naturally into the framework of\nmulti-loop integrand reduction and in a nutshell amounts to consistently\nretaining the colour structures of the unitarity cuts from which the integrand\nis gradually constructed. This technique has already been used in the recent\ncalculation of the two-loop five-gluon amplitude in pure Yang-Mills theory with\nall positive helicities, arXiv:1507.08797. In this note, we give a careful\nexposition of the method and discuss its connection to loop-level Kleiss-Kuijf\nrelations. We also explore its implications for cancellation of nontrivial\nsymmetry factors at two loops. As an example of its generality, we show how it\napplies to the three-loop case in supersymmetric Yang-Mills case.\n", "  We examine a holographic model in which a U(1) symmetry and translational\ninvariance are broken spontaneously at the same time. Our construction provides\nan example of a system with pair-density wave order, in which the\nsuperconducting order parameter is spatially modulated but has a zero average.\nIn addition, the charge density oscillates at twice the frequency of the scalar\ncondensate. Depending on the choice of parameters, the model also admits a\nstate with co-existing superconducting and charge density wave orders, in which\nthe scalar condensate has a uniform component.\n", "  I show that the problem of realizing inflation in theories with random\npotentials of a limited number of fields can be solved, and agreement with the\nobservational data can be naturally achieved if at least one of these fields\nhas a non-minimal kinetic term of the type used in the theory of cosmological\n$\\alpha$-attractors.\n", "  We compare four-- and five--flavour scheme predictions for $b$-associated\nproduction of $Z$ and Higgs bosons. The results are obtained with \\Sherpa's\nMC@NLOimplementation for the four--flavour scheme, treating the $b$'s as\nmassive, and with multijet merging at leading and next-to leading order for the\nfive--flavour schemes. Comparison with data for $Z+b(\\bar{b})$ production at\nthe $7$ TeV LHC exhibit strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches\nand are used to validate predictions for $b$-associated Higgs-boson production\nat the 13 TeV Run II.\n", "  The SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking expansion in up, down and strange quark\nmasses is extended from hadron masses to meson decay constants. This allows a\ndetermination of the ratio of kaon to pion decay constants in QCD. Furthermore\nwhen using partially quenched valence quarks the expansion is such that SU(2)\nisospin breaking effects can also be determined. It is found that the lowest\norder SU(3) flavour symmetry breaking expansion (or Gell-Mann-Okubo expansion)\nworks very well. Simulations are performed for 2+1 flavours of clover fermions\nat four lattice spacings.\n", "  Using a nonrelativistic constituent quark model in which the degrees of\nfreedom are quark-antiquark and meson-meson components, we have recently shown\nthat the $D^{(\\ast)}K$ thresholds play an important role in lowering the mass\nof the physical $D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$ and $D_{s1}(2460)$ states. This\nobservation is also supported by other theoretical approaches such as\nlattice-regularised QCD or chiral unitary theory in coupled channels. Herein,\nwe extend our computation to the lowest $P$-wave $B_{s}$ mesons, taking into\naccount the corresponding $J^{P} = 0^{+}$, $1^{+}$ and $2^{+}$ bottom-strange\nstates predicted by the naive quark model and the $BK$ and $B^{\\ast}K$\nthresholds. We assume that mixing with $B_{s}^{(\\ast)}\\eta$ and\nisospin-violating decays to $B_{s}^{(\\ast)}\\pi$ are negligible. This\ncomputation is important because there is no experimental data in the\n$b\\bar{s}$ sector for the equivalent $j_{q}^{P}=1/2^{+}$\n($D_{s0}^{\\ast}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$) heavy-quark multiplet and, as it has\nbeen seen in the $c\\bar s$ sector, the naive theoretical result can be wrong by\nmore than $100\\,{\\rm MeV}$. Our calculation allows to introduce the coupling\nwith the $D$-wave $B^{\\ast}K$ channel and to compute the probabilities\nassociated with the different Fock components of the physical state.\n", "  Solar coronal holes are sources of high-speed solar wind streams, which cause\npersistent geomagnetic activity especially at high latitudes. Here we estimate\nseasonal solar wind speeds at 1 AU for the last 100 years using high-latitude\ngeomagnetic measurements and show that they give information on the long-term\nevolution of important structures of the solar large-scale magnetic field, such\nas persistent coronal holes. We find that the centennial evolution of solar\nwind speed at 1 AU is different for equinoxes and solstices, reflecting\ndifferences in the evolution of polar coronal hole extensions and isolated\nlow-latitude coronal holes. Equinoctial solar wind speeds had their centennial\nmaximum in 1952, during the declining phase of solar cycle 18, verifying that\npolar coronal holes had exceptionally persistent extensions just before the\npeak of the Grand Modern Maximum of solar activity. On the other hand, solstice\nspeeds had their centennial maximum during the declining phase of solar cycle\n23 due to large low-latitude coronal holes. A similar configuration of seasonal\nspeeds as in cycle 23 was not found earlier, not even during the less active\ncycles of early 20th century. Therefore the exceptional occurrence of\npersistent, isolated low-latitude coronal holes in cycle 23 is not related to\nthe absolute level of sunspot activity but, most likely, to the demise of the\nGrand Modern Maximum.\n", "  We present the physical and evolutionary properties of prestellar and\nprotostellar clumps in the Herschel Infrared GALactic plane survey (Hi-GAL) in\ntwo large areas centered in the Galactic plane and covering the tips of the\nlong Galactic bar at the intersection with the spiral arms. The areas fall in\nthe longitude ranges 19 < l < 33 and 340 < l < 350, while latitude is -1 < b <\n1. Newly formed high mass stars and prestellar objects are identified and their\nproperties derived and compared. A study is also presented on five giant\nmolecular complexes at the further edge of the bar. The star-formation rate was\nestimated from the quantity of proto-stars expected to form during the collapse\nof massive turbulent clumps into star clusters. This new method was developed\nby applying a Monte Carlo procedure to an evolutionary model of turbulent cores\nand takes into account the wide multiplicity of sources produced during the\ncollapse. The star-formation rate density values at the tips are 1.2 +- 0.3\n10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 and 1.5+-0.3 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 in the first and fourth\nquadrant, respectively. The same values estimated on the entire field of view,\nthat is including the tips of the bar and background and foreground regions,\nare 0.9+-0.2 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2 and 0.8+-0.2 10-3 Msol/yr/kpc2. The conversion\nefficiency is approximately 0.8% in the first quadrant and 0.5% in the fourth\nquadrant, and does not show a significant difference in proximity of the bar.\nThe star forming regions identified through CO contours at the further edge of\nthe bar show star-formation rate densities larger than the surrounding regions\nbut their conversion efficiencies are comparable. Our results suggest that the\nstar-formation activity at the bar is due to a large amount of dust and\nmolecular material rather than being due to a triggering process.\n", "  The oxide interface SrTiO3/LaAlO3 supports a 2D electron liquid displaying\nsuperconductivity and magnetism, while allowing for a continuous control of the\nelectron density using a gate. Our recent measurements have shown a similar\nsurprising nonmonotonic behavior as function of the gate voltage (carrier\ndensity) of three quantities: the superconducting critical temperature and\nfield, the inverse Hall coefficient, and the frequency of quantum oscillations.\nWhile the total density has to be monotonic as function of gate, the last\nresult indicates that one of the involved bands has a nonmontonic occupancy as\nfunction of the chemical potential. We show how electronic interactions can\nlead to such an effect, by creating a competition between the involved bands\nand making their structure non-rigid, and thus account for all these effects.\nAdding Fock terms to our previous Hartree treatment makes this scenario even\nmore generic.\n", "  We explore the possibility that the short-lived radionuclides $^{26}$Al,\n$^{60}$Fe, $^{107}$Pd, and $^{182}$Hf inferred to be present in the proto-solar\ncloud originated from $3-8 M_{\\odot}$ Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars.\nModels of AGB stars with initial mass above 5$M_{\\odot}$ are prolific producers\nof $^{26}$Al owing to hot bottom burning (HBB). In contrast, $^{60}$Fe,\n$^{107}$Pd, and $^{182}$Hf are produced by neutron captures: $^{107}$Pd and\n$^{182}$Hf in models $\\lesssim 5 M_{\\odot}$; and $^{60}$Fe in models with\nhigher mass. We mix stellar yields from solar-metallicity AGB models into a\ncloud of solar mass and composition to investigate if it is possible to explain\nthe abundances of the four radioactive nuclides at the Sun's birth using one\nsingle value of the mixing ratio between the AGB yields and the initial cloud\nmaterial. We find that AGB stars that experience efficient HBB ($\\geq 6\nM_{\\odot}$) cannot provide a solution because they produce too little\n$^{182}$Hf and $^{107}$Pd relative to $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe. Lower-mass AGB\ncannot provide a solution because they produce too little $^{26}$Al relative to\n$^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf. A self-consistent solution may be found for AGB\nstars with masses in-between ($4-5.5 M_{\\odot}$), provided HBB is stronger than\nin our models and the $^{13}$C($\\alpha$, n)$^{16}$O neutron source is mildly\nactivated. If stars of M $< 5.5 M_{\\odot}$ are the source of the radioactive\nnuclides, then some basis for their existence in proto-solar clouds needs to be\nexplored, given that the stellar lifetimes are longer than the molecular cloud\nlifetimes.\n", "  We introduce the notion of fluid approximation of a quantum spherical black\nhole in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity. In this limit, the microstates of\nthe black hole are intertwiners between \"large\" representations $s_i$ which\ntypically scale as $s_i \\sim \\sqrt{a_H}$ where $a_H$ denotes the area of the\nhorizon in Planck units. The punctures with large colors are, for the black\nhole horizon, similar to what are the fluid parcels for a classical fluid. We\ndub them puncels. Hence, in the fluid limit, the horizon is composed by puncels\nwhich are themselves interpreted as composed (in the sense of the tensor\nproduct) by a large number of more fundamental intertwiners. We study the\nspectrum of the euclidean volume acting on puncels and we compute its quantum\nfluctuations. Then, we propose an interpretation of black holes radiation based\non the properties of the quantum fluctuations of the euclidean volume operator.\nWe estimate a typical temperature of the black hole and we show that it scales\nas the Hawking temperature.\n", "  The simultaneous presence of sizable spin-orbit interactions and electron\ncorrelations in iridium oxides has led to predictions of novel ground states\nincluding Dirac semimetals, Kitaev spin liquids, and superconductivity.\nElectron and hole doping studies of spin-orbit assisted Mott insulator Sr2IrO4\nare being intensively pursued due to extensive parallels with the La2CuO4\nparent compound of Cuprate superconductors. In particular, the mechanism of\ncharge doping associated with replacement of Ir with Rh ions remains\ncontroversial with profound consequences for the interpretation of electronic\nstructure and transport data. Using x-ray absorption near edge structure\n(XANES) measurements at the Rh L, K- and Ir L- edges we observe anomalous\nevolution of charge partitioning between Rh and Ir with Rh doping. The\npartitioning of charge between Rh and Ir sites progresses in a way that holes\nare initially doped into the Jeff=1/2 band at low x only to be removed from it\nat higher x values. This anomalous hole doping naturally explains the\nre-entrant insulating phase in the phase diagram of Rh doped Sr2IrO4 and ought\nto be considered when searching for superconductivity and other emergent\nphenomena in iridates doped with 4d elements\n", "  In a first systematic effort to characterize the intra-night optical\nvariability (INOV) of different classes of narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1)\ngalaxies, we have carried out observations on a sample of radio-loud (RL) and\nradio-quiet (RQ) NLSy1 galaxies. The RL-NLSy1 galaxies are further divided into\n{\\gamma}-ray loud (GL) and {\\gamma}-ray quiet (GQ) NLSy1 galaxies. Our sample\nconsists of four sets, each set consisting of a RQ-NLSy1, a GQ-NLSy1 and a\nGL-NLSy1 galaxy, closely matched in redshift and optical luminosity. Our\nobservations on both RQ and GQ-NLSy1 galaxies consist of a total of 19 nights,\nwhereas the data for GL-NLSy1 galaxies (18 nights) were taken from literature\npublished earlier by us. This enabled us to do a comparison of the duty cycle\n(DC) of different classes of NLSy1 galaxies. Using power-enhanced F-test, with\na variability threshold of 1%, we find DCs of about 55%, 39% and 0% for GL, GQ\nand RQ-NLSy1 galaxies respectively. The high DC and large amplitude of INOV\n(24.0 +/- 13.7%) shown by GL-NLSy1 galaxies relative to the other two classes\nmight be due to their inner aligned relativistic jets having large bulk Lorentz\nfactors. The null DC of RQ-NLSy1 galaxies could mean the presence of low power\nand/or largely misaligned jets in them. However, dividing RL-NLSy1 galaxies\ninto low and high optical polarization sources, we find that sources with large\npolarization show somewhat higher DCs (69%) and amplitudes (29%) compared to\nthose with low polarization. This points to a possible link between INOV and\noptical polarization.\n", "  The geometric distortion of CCD field of view has direct influence on the\npositional measurements of CCD observations. In order to obtain high precision\nastrometric results, the geometric distortion should be derived and corrected\nprecisely. As presented in our previous work Peng et al. (2012), a convenient\nsolution has been carried out and also been made with successful application to\nPhoebe's observations. In order to further improve the solution, an orthogonal\nmethod based on the Zernike polynomials is used in this work. Four nights of\nCCD observations including Himalia, the sixth satellite of Jupiter, and open\nclusters (NGC1664 or NGC2324) on each night have been processed to make an\napplication. The observations were obtained from the 2.4 m telescope\nadministered by Yunnan Observatories. The catalog UCAC4 was used to match\nreference stars in all of the CCD frames. The ephemeris of Himalia is retrieved\nfrom the (IMCCE). Our results show that the means of observed minus computed\n(O-C) positional residuals are -0.034 and -0.026 arcsec in right ascension and\ndeclination, respectively. The corresponding standard deviations are 0.031 and\n0.028 arcsec. The measurement dispersion is significantly improved than that by\nusing our previous solution.\n", "  We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the fragmentation of\nself-gravitating discs using 3D global ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nperformed with the \"phantom\" smoothed particle hydrodynamics code.\n  For initially toroidal fields, we find two regimes. In the first, where the\ncooling time is greater than five times the dynamical time, magnetic fields\nreduce spiral density wave amplitudes, which in turn suppresses fragmentation.\nThis is the case even if the magnetic pressure is only a tenth of the thermal\npressure. The second regime occurs when the cooling time is sufficiently short\nthat magnetic fields cannot halt fragmentation.\n  We find that magnetised discs produce more massive fragments, due to both the\nadditional pressure exerted by the magnetic field, and the additional angular\nmomentum transport induced by Maxwell stresses. The fragments are confined to a\nnarrower range of initial semimajor axes than those in unmagnetised discs. The\norbital eccentricity and inclination distributions of unmagnetised and\nmagnetised disc fragments are similar. Our results suggest the fragmentation\nboundary could be at cooling times a factor of two lower than predicted by\npurely hydrodynamical models.\n", "  The Slater-Pauling rule states that L21 Heusler compounds with 24 valence\nelectrons do never exhibit a total spin magnetic moment. In case of strongly\nlocalized magnetic moments at one of the atoms (here Mn) they will exhibit a\nfully compensated half-metallic ferrimagnetic state instead, in particular,\nwhen symmetry does not allow for antiferromagnetic order. With aid of magnetic\nand anomalous Hall effect measurements it is experimentally demonstrated that\nMn1.5V0.5FeAl follows such a scenario. The ferrimagnetic state is tuned by the\ncomposition. A small residual magnetization, that arises due to a slight\nmismatch of the magnetic moments in the different sublattices results in a\npronounced change of the temperature dependence of the ferrimagnet. A\ncompensation point is confirmed by observation of magnetic reversal and sign\nchange of the anomalous Hall effect. Theoretical models are presented that\ncorrelate the electronic structure and the compensation mechanisms of the\ndifferent half-metallic ferrimagnetic states in the Mn-V-Fe-Al Heusler system.\n", "  We present the first full catalog and science results for the NuSTAR\nserendipitous survey. The catalog incorporates data taken during the first 40\nmonths of NuSTAR operation, which provide ~20Ms of effective exposure time over\n331 fields, with an areal coverage of 13 sq deg, and 497 sources detected in\ntotal over the 3-24 keV energy range. There are 276 sources with spectroscopic\nredshifts and classifications, largely resulting from our extensive campaign of\nground-based spectroscopic followup. We characterize the overall sample in\nterms of the X-ray, optical, and infrared source properties. The sample is\nprimarily comprised of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), detected over a large\nrange in redshift from z = 0.002 - 3.4 (median of <z> = 0.56), but also\nincludes 16 spectroscopically confirmed Galactic sources. There is a large\nrange in X-ray flux, from log( f_3-24keV / erg s^-1 cm^-2 ) ~ -14 to -11, and\nin rest-frame 10-40 keV luminosity, from log( L_10-40keV / erg s^-1 ) ~ 39 to\n46, with a median of 44.1. Approximately 79% of the NuSTAR sources have lower\nenergy (<10 keV) X-ray counterparts from XMM-Newton, Chandra, and Swift/XRT.\nThe mid-infrared (MIR) analysis, using WISE all-sky survey data, shows that MIR\nAGN color selections miss a large fraction of the NuSTAR-selected AGN\npopulation, from ~15% at the highest luminosities (Lx > 10^44 erg s^-1) to ~80%\nat the lowest luminosities (Lx < 10^43 erg s^-1). Our optical spectroscopic\nanalysis finds that the observed fraction of optically obscured AGNs (i.e., the\nType 2 fraction) is F_Type2 = 53(+14-15)%, for a well-defined subset of the\n8-24 keV selected sample. This is higher, albeit at a low significance level,\nthan the Type 2 fraction measured for redshift- and luminosity-matched AGNs\nselected by <10 keV X-ray missions.\n", "  We investigate two-dimensional image decomposition of nearby, morphologically\nselected early-type galaxies (ETGs). We are motivated by recent observational\nevidence of significant size growth of quiescent galaxies and theoretical\ndevelopment advocating a two-phase formation scenario for ETGs. We find that a\nsignificant fraction of nearby ETGs show changes in isophotal shape that\nrequire multi-component models. The characteristic sizes of the inner and outer\ncomponent are $\\sim 3$ and $\\sim 15$ kpc. The inner component lies on the\nmass-size relation of ETGs at $z \\sim 0.25-0.75$, while the outer component\ntends to be more elliptical and hints at a stochastic buildup process. We find\nreal physical differences between the single- and double-component ETGs, with\nthe double-component galaxies being younger and more metal-rich. The fraction\nof double component ETGs increases with increasing $\\sigma$ and decreases in\ndenser environments. We hypothesize that double-component systems were able to\naccrete gas and small galaxies until later times, boosting their central\ndensities, building up their outer parts, and lowering their typical central\nages. In contrast, the oldest galaxies, perhaps due to residing in richer\nenvironments, have no remaining hints of their last accretion episode.\n", "  We perform a thorough study of the thermodynamic properties of a class of\nLovelock black holes with conformal scalar hair arising from coupling of a real\nscalar field to the dimensionally extended Euler densities. We study the\nlinearized equations of motion of the theory and describe constraints under\nwhich the theory is free from ghosts/tachyons. We then consider, within the\ncontext of black hole chemistry, the thermodynamics of the hairy black holes in\nthe Gauss-Bonnet and cubic Lovelock theories. We clarify the connection between\nisolated critical points and thermodynamic singularities, finding a one\nparameter family of these critical points which occur for well-defined\nthermodynamic parameters. We also report on a number of novel results,\nincluding `virtual triple points' and the first example of a\n`$\\lambda$-line'---a line of second order phase transitions---in black hole\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Neutrinos propagating in dense astrophysical environments sustain nonlinear\nrefractive effects due to neutrino-neutrino forward scattering. We study\ngeometric phases in neutrino oscillations that arise out of cyclic evolution of\nthe potential generated by these forward-scattering processes. We perform\nseveral calculations, exact and perturbative, that illustrate the robustness of\nsuch phases, and of geometric effects more broadly, in the flavor evolution of\nneutrinos. The scenarios we consider are highly idealized in order to make them\nanalytically tractable, but they suggest the possible presence of complicated\ngeometric effects in realistic astrophysical settings. We also point out that\nin the limit of extremely high neutrino densities, the nonlinear potential in\nthree flavors naturally gives rise to non-Abelian geometric phases. This paper\nis intended to be accessible to neutrino experts and non-specialists alike.\n", "  Abridged - We quantify the effect of the galaxy group environment (for 12.5 <\nlog(M_group/Msun) < 14.0) on the star formation rates of the\n(morphologically-selected) population of disk-dominated local Universe spiral\ngalaxies (z < 0.13) with stellar masses log(M*/Msun) > 9.5. Within this\npopulation, we find that, while a small minority of group satellites are\nstrongly quenched, the group centrals, and the large majority of satellites\nexhibit levels of SFR indistinguishable from ungrouped \"field\" galaxies of the\nsame M*, albeit with a higher scatter, and for all M*. Modelling these results,\nwe deduce that disk-dominated satellites continue to be characterized by a\nrapid cycling of gas into and out of their ISM at rates similar to those\noperating prior to infall, with the on-going fuelling likely sourced from the\ngroup intrahalo medium (IHM) on Mpc scales, rather than from the\ncircum-galactic medium on 100kpc scales. Consequently, the color-density\nrelation of the galaxy population as a whole would appear to be primarily due\nto a change in the mix of disk- and spheroid-dominated morphologies in the\ndenser group environment compared to the field, rather than to a reduced\npropensity of the IHM in higher mass structures to cool and accrete onto\ngalaxies. We also suggest that the inferred substantial accretion of IHM gas by\nsatellite disk-dominated galaxies will lead to a progressive reduction in their\nspecific angular momentum, thereby representing an efficient secular mechanism\nto transform morphology from star-forming disk-dominated types to more passive\nspheroid-dominated types.\n", "  We report hyperpolarization of the electronic spins associated with\nsubstitutional nitrogen defects in bulk diamond crystal. Hyperpolarization is\nachieved by optical pumping of nitrogen vacancy centers followed by rapid cross\nrelaxation at the energy level matching condition in a 51 mT bias field. The\nmaximum observed donor spin polarization is 0.9 \\% corresponding to an\nenhancement by 25 compared to the thermal Boltzmann polarization. A further\naccumulation of polarization is impeded by an anomalous optical saturation\neffect that we attribute to charge state conversion processes. Hyperpolarized\nnitrogen donors may form a useful resource for increasing the efficiency of\ndiamond-based dynamic nuclear polarization devices.\n", "  We introduce Deep-HiTS, a rotation invariant convolutional neural network\n(CNN) model for classifying images of transients candidates into artifacts or\nreal sources for the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS). CNNs have the\nadvantage of learning the features automatically from the data while achieving\nhigh performance. We compare our CNN model against a feature engineering\napproach using random forests (RF). We show that our CNN significantly\noutperforms the RF model reducing the error by almost half. Furthermore, for a\nfixed number of approximately 2,000 allowed false transient candidates per\nnight we are able to reduce the miss-classified real transients by\napproximately 1/5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CNNs\nhave been used to detect astronomical transient events. Our approach will be\nvery useful when processing images from next generation instruments such as the\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We have made all our code and data\navailable to the community for the sake of allowing further developments and\ncomparisons at https://github.com/guille-c/Deep-HiTS.\n", "  NGC 1448 is one of the nearest luminous galaxies ($L_{8-1000\\mu m} >$ 10$^{9}\nL_{\\odot}$) to ours ($z$ $=$ 0.00390), and yet the active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) it hosts was only recently discovered, in 2009. In this paper, we present\nan analysis of the nuclear source across three wavebands: mid-infrared (MIR)\ncontinuum, optical, and X-rays. We observed the source with the Nuclear\nSpectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), and combined this data with archival\nChandra data to perform broadband X-ray spectral fitting ($\\approx$0.5-40 keV)\nof the AGN for the first time. Our X-ray spectral analysis reveals that the AGN\nis buried under a Compton-thick (CT) column of obscuring gas along our\nline-of-sight, with a column density of $N_{\\rm H}$(los) $\\gtrsim$ 2.5 $\\times$\n10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The best-fitting torus models measured an intrinsic 2-10\nkeV luminosity of $L_{2-10\\rm{,int}}$ $=$ (3.5-7.6) $\\times$ 10$^{40}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, making NGC 1448 one of the lowest luminosity CTAGNs known. In\naddition to the NuSTAR observation, we also performed optical spectroscopy for\nthe nucleus in this edge-on galaxy using the European Southern Observatory New\nTechnology Telescope. We re-classify the optical nuclear spectrum as a Seyfert\non the basis of the Baldwin-Philips-Terlevich diagnostic diagrams, thus\nidentifying the AGN at optical wavelengths for the first time. We also present\nhigh spatial resolution MIR observations of NGC 1448 with Gemini/T-ReCS, in\nwhich a compact nucleus is clearly detected. The absorption-corrected 2-10 keV\nluminosity measured from our X-ray spectral analysis agrees with that predicted\nfrom the optical [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\\AA\\ emission line and the MIR 12$\\mu$m\ncontinuum, further supporting the CT nature of the AGN.\n", "  We present near-infrared spectra for 144 candidate planetary systems\nidentified during Campaigns 1-7 of the NASA K2 Mission. The goal of the survey\nwas to characterize planets orbiting low-mass stars, but our IRTF/SpeX and\nPalomar/TripleSpec spectroscopic observations revealed that 49% of our targets\nwere actually giant stars or hotter dwarfs reddened by interstellar extinction.\nFor the 72 stars with spectra consistent with classification as cool dwarfs\n(spectral types K3 - M4), we refined their stellar properties by applying\nempirical relations based on stars with interferometric radius measurements.\nAlthough our revised temperatures are generally consistent with those reported\nin the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), our revised stellar radii are\ntypically 0.13 solar radii (39%) larger than the EPIC values, which were based\non model isochrones that have been shown to underestimate the radii of cool\ndwarfs. Our improved stellar characterizations will enable more efficient\nprioritization of K2 targets for follow-up studies.\n", "  While theoretical dust condensation models predict that most refractory\nelements produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) efficiently condense into\ndust, a large quantity of dust has so far only been observed in SN 1987A. We\npresent the analysis of Spitzer Space Telescope, Herschel Space Observatory,\nStratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and AKARI\nobservations of the infrared (IR) shell surrounding the pulsar wind nebula in\nthe supernova remnant G54.1+0.3. We attribute a distinctive spectral feature at\n21 $\\mu$m to a magnesium silicate grain species that has been invoked in\nmodeling the ejecta-condensed dust in Cas A, which exhibits the same spectral\nsignature. If this species is responsible for producing the observed spectral\nfeature and accounts for a significant fraction of the observed IR continuum,\nwe find that it would be the dominant constituent of the dust in G54.1+0.3,\nwith possible secondary contributions from other compositions, such as carbon,\nsilicate, or alumina grains. The smallest mass of SN-formed dust required by\nour models is 1.1 $\\pm$ 0.8 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$. We discuss how these results may\nbe affected by varying dust grain properties and self-consistent grain heating\nmodels. The spatial distribution of the dust mass and temperature in G54.1+0.3\nconfirms the scenario in which the SN-formed dust has not yet been processed by\nthe SN reverse shock and is being heated by stars belonging to a cluster in\nwhich the SN progenitor exploded. The dust mass and composition suggest a\nprogenitor mass of 16$-$27 $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and imply a high dust condensation\nefficiency, similar to that found for Cas A and SN 1987A. The study provides\nanother example of significant dust formation in a Type IIP SN and sheds light\non the properties of pristine SN-condensed dust.\n", "  Extremely high velocity emission likely related to jets is known to occur in\nsome proto-Planetary Nebulae. However, the molecular complexity of this\nkinematic component is largely unknown. We observed the known extreme outflow\nfrom the proto-Planetary Nebula IRAS 16342-3814, a prototype water fountain, in\nthe full frequency range from 73 to 111 GHz with the RSR receiver on the Large\nMillimetre Telescope. We detected the molecules SiO, HCN, SO, and $^{13}$CO.\nAll molecular transitions, with the exception of the latter are detected for\nthe first time in this source, and all present emission with velocities up to a\nfew hundred km s$^{-1}$. IRAS 16342-3814 is therefore the only source of this\nkind presenting extreme outflow activity simultaneously in all these molecules,\nwith SO and SiO emission showing the highest velocities found of these species\nin proto-Planetary Nebulae. To be confirmed is a tentative weak SO component\nwith a FWHM $\\sim$ 700 km s$^{-1}$. The extreme outflow gas consists of dense\ngas (n$_{\\rm H_2} >$ 10$^{4.8}$--10$^{5.7}$ cm$^{-3}$), with a mass larger than\n$\\sim$ 0.02--0.15 M$_{\\odot}$. The relatively high abundances of SiO and SO may\nbe an indication of an oxygen-rich extreme high velocity gas.\n", "  Correction of Type Ia Supernova brightnesses for extinction by dust has\nproven to be a vexing problem. Here we study the dust foreground to the highly\nreddened SN 2012cu, which is projected onto a dust lane in the galaxy NGC 4772.\nThe analysis is based on multi-epoch, spectrophotometric observations spanning\n3,300 - 9,200 {\\AA}, obtained by the Nearby Supernova Factory. Phase-matched\ncomparison of the spectroscopically twinned SN 2012cu and SN 2011fe across 10\nepochs results in the best-fit color excess of (E(B-V), RMS) = (1.00, 0.03) and\ntotal-to-selective extinction ratio of (RV , RMS) = (2.95, 0.08) toward SN\n2012cu within its host galaxy. We further identify several diffuse interstellar\nbands, and compare the 5780 {\\AA} band with the dust-to-band ratio for the\nMilky Way. Overall, we find the foreground dust-extinction properties for SN\n2012cu to be consistent with those of the Milky Way. Furthermore we find no\nevidence for significant time variation in any of these extinction tracers. We\nalso compare the dust extinction curve models of Cardelli et al. (1989),\nO'Donnell (1994), and Fitzpatrick (1999), and find the predictions of\nFitzpatrick (1999) fit SN 2012cu the best. Finally, the distance to NGC4772,\nthe host of SN 2012cu, at a redshift of z = 0.0035, often assigned to the Virgo\nSouthern Extension, is determined to be 16.6$\\pm$1.1 Mpc. We compare this\nresult with distance measurements in the literature.\n", "  Recent population studies have shown that the variability Doppler factors can\nadequately describe blazars as a population. We use the flux density variations\nfound within the extensive radio multi-wavelength datasets of the F-GAMMA\nprogram, a total of 10 frequencies from 2.64 up to 142.33 GHz, in order to\nestimate the variability Doppler factors for 58 $\\gamma$-ray bright sources,\nfor 20 of which no variability Doppler factor has been estimated before. We\nemploy specifically designed algorithms in order to obtain a model for each\nflare at each frequency. We then identify each event and track its evolution\nthrough all the available frequencies for each source. This approach allows us\nto distinguish significant events producing flares from stochastic variability\nin blazar jets. It also allows us to effectively constrain the variability\nbrightness temperature and hence the variability Doppler factor as well as\nprovide error estimates. Our method can produce the most accurate (16\\% error\non average) estimates in the literature to date.\n", "  Solar filaments can be formed via chromospheric evaporation followed by\ncondensation in the corona or by the direct injection of cool plasma from the\nchromosphere to the corona. In this paper, with high-resolution H$\\alpha$ data\nobserved by the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope of the Big Bear Solar Observatory on\n2015 August 21, we confirmed that an active-region filament is maintained by\nthe continuous injection of cold chromospheric plasma. We find that the\nfilament is rooted along a bright ridge in H$\\alpha$, which corresponds to the\nintersection of a magnetic quasi-separatrix layer with the solar surface. This\nbright ridge consists of many small patches and the sizes of these patches are\ncomparable to the width of the filament threads. It is found that upflows\noriginate from the brighter patches of the ridge, whereas the downflows move\ntoward the weaker patches of the ridge. The whole filament is composed of two\nopposite directional streams, implying that longitudinal oscillations are not\nthe only cause of the counterstreamings, and unidirectional siphon flows with\nalternative directions are another possibility.\n", "  We use the IRAM Large Program EMPIRE and new high-resolution ALMA data to\nmeasure 13CO(1-0)/C18O(1-0) intensity ratios across nine nearby spiral\ngalaxies. These isotopologues of CO are typically optically thin across most of\nthe area in galaxy disks, and this ratio allows us to gauge their relative\nabundance due to chemistry or stellar nucleosynthesis effects. Resolved\n13CO/C18O gradients across normal galaxies have been rare due to the faintness\nof these lines. We find a mean 13CO/C18O ratio of 6.0$\\pm$0.9 for the central\nregions of our galaxies. This agrees well with results in the Milky Way, but\ndiffers from results for starburst galaxies (3.4$\\pm$0.9) and ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies (1.1$\\pm$0.4). In our sample, the 13CO/C18O ratio\nconsistently increases with increasing galactocentric radius and decreases with\nincreasing star formation rate surface density. These trends qualitatively\nagree with expectations for carbon and oxygen isotopic abundance variations due\nto stellar nucleosynthesis, with a possible effect of fractionation.\n", "  We present $\\emph{NuSTAR}$ observations of neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray\nbinaries: 4U 1636-53, GX 17+2, and 4U 1705-44. We observed 4U 1636-53 in the\nhard state, with an Eddington fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$, of 0.01; GX 17+2\nand 4U 1705-44 were in the soft state with fractions of 0.57 and 0.10,\nrespectively. Each spectrum shows evidence for a relativistically broadened Fe\nK$_{\\alpha}$ line. Through accretion disk reflection modeling, we constrain the\nradius of the inner disk in 4U 1636-53 to be $R_{in}=1.03\\pm0.03$ ISCO\n(innermost stable circular orbit) assuming a dimensionless spin parameter\n$a_{*}=cJ/GM^{2}=0.0$, and $R_{in}=1.08\\pm0.06$ ISCO for $a_{*}=0.3$ (errors\nquoted at 1 $\\sigma$). This value proves to be model independent. For\n$a_{*}=0.3$ and $M=1.4\\ M_{\\odot}$, for example, $1.08\\pm0.06$ ISCO translates\nto a physical radius of $R=10.8\\pm0.6$ km, and the neutron star would have to\nbe smaller than this radius (other outcomes are possible for allowed spin\nparameters and masses). For GX 17+2, $R_{in}=1.00-1.04$ ISCO for $a_{*}=0.0$\nand $R_{in}=1.03-1.30$ ISCO for $a_{*}=0.3$. For $a_{*}=0.3$ and $M=1.4\\\nM_{\\odot}$, $R_{in}=1.03-1.30$ ISCO translates to $R=10.3-13.0$ km. The inner\naccretion disk in 4U 1705-44 may be truncated just above the stellar surface,\nperhaps by a boundary layer or magnetosphere; reflection models give a radius\nof 1.46-1.64 ISCO for $a_{*}=0.0$ and 1.69-1.93 ISCO for $a_{*}=0.3$. We\ndiscuss the implications that our results may have on the equation of state of\nultradense, cold matter and our understanding of the innermost accretion flow\nonto neutron stars with low surface magnetic fields, and systematic errors\nrelated to the reflection models and spacetime metric around less idealized\nneutron stars.\n", "  The complex interplay between turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity\nleads to the formation of molecular clouds out of the diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM). One avenue of studying this interplay is by analyzing statistical\nfeatures derived from observations, where the interpretation of these features\nis greatly facilitated by comparisons with numerical simulations. Here we focus\non the statistical anisotropy present in synthetic maps of velocity centroid\ndata, which we derive from three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\na turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating patch of ISM. We study how the\norientation and magnitude of the velocity anisotropy correlate with the\nmagnetic field and with the structures generated by gravitational collapse.\n  Motivated by recent observational constraints, our simulations focus on the\nsupersonic (sonic Mach number $\\mathcal{M} \\approx 2 - 17$) but sub- to\ntrans-alfvenic (alfvenic Mach number $\\mathcal{M}_A \\approx 0.2 - 1.2$)\nturbulence regime, and we consider clouds which are barely to mildly\nmagnetically supercritical (mass-to-flux ratio equal to once or twice the\ncritical value). Additionally we explore the impact of the turbulence driving\nmechanism (solenoidal or compressive) on the velocity anisotropy.\n  While we confirm previous findings that the velocity anisotropy generally\naligns well with the plane-of-sky magnetic field, our inclusion of the effects\nof self-gravity reveals that in regions of higher column density, the velocity\nanisotropy may be destroyed or even reoriented to align with the\ngravitationally formed structures. We provide evidence that this effect is not\nnecessarily due to the increase of $\\mathcal{M}_A$ inside the high-density\nregions.\n", "  In the first paper of this series, we showed that the ratio c of individual\ndose to ambient dose did not change with time in Date City, Fukushima\nPrefecture, after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The\npurpose of the present paper, the second in a series, is to estimate the\nlifetime doses of the Date City residents, based on continuous glass badge\nmonitoring data, extrapolated by means of the ambient-dose-rate reduction\nfunction obtained from the airborne monitoring data. As a result, we found that\nthe mean additional lifetime dose of residents living in Date City is not\nexpected to exceed 18 mSv. In addition, effects of decontamination on the\nreduction of individual doses were not evident. This method of combining\nindividual doses and the ambient doses, as developed in this study, has made it\npossible to predict with reasonable certainty the lifetime doses of residents\nwho continue to live in this radiologically contaminated area.\n", "  Kustaanheimo-Stiefel (KS) transformation depends on the choice of some\npreferred direction in the Cartesian 3D space. This choice, seldom explicitly\nmentioned, amounts typically to the direction of the first or the third\ncoordinate axis in celestial mechanics and atomic physics, respectively. The\npresent work develops a canonical KS transformation with an arbitrary preferred\ndirection, indicated by what we call a defining vector. Using a mix of vector\nand quaternion algebra, we formulate the transformation in a reference frame\nindependent manner. The link between the oscillator and Keplerian first\nintegrals is given. As an example of the present formulation, the Keplerian\nmotion in a rotating frame is re-investigated.\n", "  This paper presents the multi-wavelength analysis of a 13 s quasi-periodic\npulsation (QPP) observed in hard X-ray (12-300 keV) and microwave (4.9-34 GHz)\nemissions during a C-class flare occurred on 21 September 2015. AIA 304 and 171\n\\AA~ images show an emerging loop/flux tube (L1) moving radially outward, which\ninteracts with preexisting structures within the active region. The QPP was\nobserved during the expansion and rising motion of L1. The Nobeyama\nRadioheliograph (NoRH) microwave images in 17/34 GHz channels reveal a single\nradio source, which was co-spatial with a neighboring loop (L2). In addition,\nusing AIA 304 \\AA~ images, we detected intensity oscillations in the legs of\nloop L2 with a period of about 26 s. A similar oscillation period was observed\nin the GOES soft X-ray flux derivative. This oscillation period seems to\nincrease with time. We suggest that the observed QPP is most likely generated\nby the interaction between loops L2 and L3 observed in the AIA hot channels\n(131 and 94 \\AA). The merging speed of loops L2 and L3 was ~35 km/s. Loop L1\ndestroyed possibly by its interaction with preexisting structures in the active\nregion and produced a cool jet with the speed ~106-118 km/s associated with a\nnarrow CME (~770 km/s). Another mechanism of the QPP in terms of a sausage\noscillation of the loop (L2) is also possible.\n", "  We present $H$-band scattered light imaging of a bright debris disk around\nthe A0 star HD 36546 obtained from the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive\nOptics (SCExAO) system with data recorded by the HiCIAO camera using the vector\nvortex coronagraph. SCExAO traces the disk from $r$ $\\sim$ 0.3\" to $r$ $\\sim$\n1\" (34--114 au). The disk is oriented in a near east-west direction (PA $\\sim$\n75$^{o}$), is inclined by $i$ $\\sim$ 70--75$^{o}$ and is strongly\nforward-scattering ($g$ $>$ 0.5). It is an extended disk rather than a sharp\nring; a second, diffuse dust population extends from the disk's eastern side.\nWhile HD 36546 intrinsic properties are consistent with a wide age range ($t$\n$\\sim$ 1--250 $Myr$), its kinematics and analysis of coeval stars suggest a\nyoung age (3--10 $Myr$) and a possible connection to Taurus-Auriga's star\nformation history. SCExAO's planet-to-star contrast ratios are comparable to\nthe first-light Gemini Planet Imager contrasts; for an age of 10 $Myr$, we rule\nout planets with masses comparable to HR 8799 b beyond a projected separation\nof 23 au. A massive icy planetesimal disk or an unseen superjovian planet at\n$r$ $>$ 20 au may explain the disk's visibility. The HD 36546 debris disk may\nbe the youngest debris disk yet imaged, is the first newly-identified object\nfrom the now-operational SCExAO extreme AO system, is ideally suited for\nspectroscopic follow up with SCExAO/CHARIS in 2017, and may be a key probe of\nicy planet formation and planet-disk interactions.\n", "  Catalytic swimmers have attracted much attention as alternatives to\nbiological systems for examining collective microscopic dynamics and the\nresponse to physico-chemical signals. Yet, understanding and predicting even\nthe most fundamental characteristics of their individual propulsion still\nraises important challenges. While chemical asymmetry is widely recognized as\nthe cornerstone of catalytic propulsion, different experimental studies have\nreported that particles with identical chemical properties may propel in\nopposite directions. Here, we show that, beyond its chemical properties, the\ndetailed shape of a catalytic swimmer plays an essential role in determining\nits direction of motion, demonstrating the compatibility of the classical\ntheoretical framework with experimental observations.\n", "  Ultra-Compact (UC)HII regions represent a very early stage of massive star\nformation whose structure and evolution are not yet fully understood.\nInterferometric observations in recent years show that some UCHII regions have\nassociated compact sources of uncertain nature. Based on this, we carried out\nVLA 1.3 cm observations in the A configuration of selected UCHII regions in\norder to report additional cases of compact sources embedded in UCHII regions.\nFrom the observations, we find 13 compact sources associated to 9 UCHII\nregions. Although we cannot establish an unambiguous nature for the newly\ndetected sources, we assess some of their observational properties. According\nto the results, we can distinguish between two types of compact sources. One\ntype corresponds to sources that probably are deeply embedded in the dense\nionized gas of the UCHII region. These sources are being photo-evaporated by\nthe exciting star of the region and will last for 10$^4-10^5$ yr. They may play\na crucial role in the evolution of the UCHII region as the photo-evaporated\nmaterial could replenish the expanding plasma and might provide a solution to\nthe so-called lifetime problem for these regions. The second type of compact\nsources is not associated with the densest ionized gas of the region. A few of\nthese sources appear resolved and may be photo-evaporating objects such as\nthose of the first type but with significantly lower mass depletion rates. The\nrest of sources of this second type appear unresolved and their properties are\nvaried. We speculate on the similarity between the sources of the second type\nand those of the Orion population of radio sources.\n", "  We present a sample of 1,483 sources that display spectral peaks between 72\nMHz and 1.4 GHz, selected from the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison\nWidefield Array (GLEAM) survey. The GLEAM survey is the widest fractional\nbandwidth all-sky survey to date, ideal for identifying peaked-spectrum sources\nat low radio frequencies. Our peaked-spectrum sources are the low frequency\nanalogues of gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) and compact-steep spectrum (CSS)\nsources, which have been hypothesized to be the precursors to massive radio\ngalaxies. Our sample more than doubles the number of known peaked-spectrum\ncandidates, and 95% of our sample have a newly characterized spectral peak. We\nhighlight that some GPS sources peaking above 5 GHz have had multiple epochs of\nnuclear activity, and demonstrate the possibility of identifying high redshift\n($z > 2$) galaxies via steep optically thin spectral indices and low observed\npeak frequencies. The distribution of the optically thick spectral indices of\nour sample is consistent with past GPS/CSS samples but with a large dispersion,\nsuggesting that the spectral peak is a product of an inhomogeneous environment\nthat is individualistic. We find no dependence of observed peak frequency with\nredshift, consistent with the peaked-spectrum sample comprising both local CSS\nsources and high-redshift GPS sources. The 5 GHz luminosity distribution lacks\nthe brightest GPS and CSS sources of previous samples, implying that a\nconvolution of source evolution and redshift influences the type of\npeaked-spectrum sources identified below 1 GHz. Finally, we discuss sources\nwith optically thick spectral indices that exceed the synchrotron\nself-absorption limit.\n", "  Over two decades of astrometric and radial velocity data of short period\nstars in the Galactic center have the potential to provide unprecedented tests\nof General Relativity and insight into the astrophysics of supermassive black\nholes. Fundamental to this is understanding the underlying statistical issues\nof fitting stellar orbits. Unintended prior effects can obscure actual physical\neffects from General Relativity and the underlying extended mass distribution.\nAt the heart of this is dealing with large parameter spaces inherent to multi\nstar fitting and ensuring acceptable coverage properties of the resulting\nconfidence intervals within the Bayesian framework. This proceeding will detail\nsome of the UCLA Galactic Center Group's analysis and work in addressing these\nstatistical issues.\n", "  In this work, we extensively investigate the formation of near 4:2:1 mean\nmotion resonances (MMRs) configuration by performing two sets of N-body\nsimulations. We model the eccentricity damping, gas drag, type I and type II\nplanetary migration of planetesimals, planetary embryos and giant planets in\nthe first sets. For the simulations of giant planets with type II migration,\nthe massive terrestrial planets, with a mass up to several Earth masses, are\nlikely produced in the systems. We further show that by shepherding and/or\nscattering mechanisms through Jovian planet's type II migration, the\nterrestrial planets and giant planets in the systems can be evolved into a near\n4:2:1 MMRs. Moreover, the models are applicable to the formation of Kepler-238\nand 302 systems. In the second set, we study the 4:2:1 MMRs formation in the\nterrestrial planetary systems, where the planets undergo type I migration and\neccentricity damping. By considering type I migration, $\\sim$ 17.1\\% of the\nsimulations indicate that terrestrial planets are evolved into 4:2:1 MMRs.\nHowever, this probability should depend on the initial conditions of planets.\nHence, we conclude that both type I and type II migration can play a crucial\nrole in close-in terrestrial planet formation.\n", "  The measured frequencies and intensities of different first- and second-\norder Raman peaks of suspended graphene are used to show that optical phonons\nand different acoustic phonon polarizations are driven out of local equilibrium\ninside a sub-micron laser spot. The experimental results are correlated with a\nfirst principles-based multiple temperature model to suggest a considerably\nlower equivalent local temperature of the flexural phonons than those of other\nphonon polarizations. The finding reveals weak coupling between the flexural\nmodes with hot electrons and optical phonons. Since the ultrahigh intrinsic\nthermal conductivity of graphene has been largely attributed to contributions\nfrom the flexural phonons, the observed local non-equilibrium phenomena have\nimportant implications for understanding energy dissipation processes in\ngraphene-based electronic and optoelectronic devices, as well as in Raman\nmeasurements of thermal transport in graphene and other two-dimensional\nmaterials.\n", "  We present a catalog of compact sources of radio emission at 1420 MHz in the\nnorthern Galactic plane from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey. The catalog\ncontains 72,787 compact sources with angular size less than 3$'$ within the\nGalactic longitude range $52^{\\circ} < \\ell < 192^{\\circ}$ down to a 5$\\sigma$\ndetection level of $\\sim$1.2 mJy. Linear polarization properties are included\nfor 12,368 sources with signals greater than 4$\\sigma_{QU}$ in the CGPS Stokes\n$Q$ and $U$ images at the position of the total intensity peak. We compare CGPS\nflux densities with cataloged flux densities in the Northern VLA Sky Survey\ncatalog for 10,897 isolated unresolved sources with CGPS flux density greater\nthan 4 mJy to search for sources that show variable flux density on time scales\nof several years. We identify 146 candidate variables that exhibit high\nfractional variations between the two surveys. In addition we identify 13\ncandidate transient sources that have CGPS flux density above 10\\,mJy but are\nnot detected in the NVSS.\n", "  Long term radio monitoring of the broad absorption line quasar, Mrk\\,231, at\n17.6~GHz detected a strong flare in 2015. This triggered four epochs of Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA) observations from 8.4 GHz to 43 GHz as well as three\nepochs of X-ray observations with NuSTAR and two with XMM over a 15 week\nperiod. Two ejected components were detected by the VLBA observations. A\nconservative lower bound on the apparent speed of the first ejection is\nattained by assuming that it was ejected when the flare began,\n$v_{\\rm{app}}>3.15$c. Serendipitous far UV Hubble Space Telescope observations\ncombined with our long term radio monitoring seem to indicate that episodes of\nrelativistic ejections suppress flux that is emitted at wavelengths shortward\nof the peak of the far UV spectral energy distribution, similar to what has\nbeen observed in radio loud quasars. Episodes of strong jet production also\nseem to suppress the high ionization broad absorption line wind seen in weak\njet states. We found a statistically significant increase ($\\sim 25\\%$) of the\n3-12 keV flux during the radio flare relative to a quiescent radio state. This\nis explained by an ultra-fast ($\\sim 0.06$c) X-ray absorbing photo-ionized wind\nthat is significantly detected only in the low radio state (similar to Galactic\nblack holes). Mrk~231 is becoming more radio loud. We found that the putative\nparsec scale radio lobe doubled in brightness in 9 years. Furthermore, large\nflares are more frequent with 3 major flares occurring at $\\sim 2$ year\nintervals.\n", "  The wake-mediated propulsion of an \"extra\" particle in a channel of two\nneighboring rows of a two-dimensional plasma crystal, observed experimentally\nby Du et al. [Phys. Rev. E 89, 021101(R) (2014)], is explained in simulations\nand theory. We use the simple model of a pointlike ion wake charge to reproduce\nthis intriguing effect in simulations, allowing for a detailed investigation\nand a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics. We show that the\nnonreciprocity of the particle interaction, owing to the wake charges, is\nresponsible for a broken symmetry of the channel that enables a persistent\nself-propelled motion of the extra particle. We find good agreement of the\nterminal extra-particle velocity with our theoretical considerations and with\nexperiments.\n", "  We report the first asteroseismic results obtained with the Hertzsprung SONG\nTelescope from an extensive high-precision radial-velocity observing campaign\nof the subgiant muHerculis. The data set was collected during 215 nights in\n2014 and 2015. We detected a total of 49 oscillation modes with l values from 0\nto 3, including some l = 1 mixed modes. Based on the rotational splitting\nobserved in l = 1 modes, we determine a rotational period of 52 days and a\nstellar inclination angle of 63 degrees. The parameters obtained through\nmodeling of the observed oscillation frequencies agree very well with\nindependent observations and imply a stellar mass between 1.11 and 1.15M_sun\nand an age of 7.8+/-0.4 Gyr. Furthermore, the high-quality data allowed us to\ndetermine the acoustic depths of the He II ionization layer and the base of the\nconvection zone.\n", "  The globular cluster (GC) system of our Galaxy contains four planetary\nnebulae (PNe): K 648 (or Ps 1) in M15, IRAS 18333-2357 in M22, JaFu 1 in Pal 6,\nand JaFu 2 in NGC 6441. Because single-star evolution at the low stellar mass\nof present-epoch GCs was considered incapable of producing visible PNe, their\norigin presented a puzzle. We imaged the PN JaFu 1 with the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) to obtain photometry of its central star (CS) and\nhigh-resolution morphological information. We imaged IRAS 18333-2357 with\nbetter depth and resolution, and we analyzed its archival HST spectra to\nconstrain its CS temperature and luminosity. All PNe in Galactic GCs now have\nhigh-quality HST data, allowing us to improve CS mass estimates. We find\nreasonably consistent masses between 0.53 and 0.58 Msun for all four objects,\nthough estimates vary when adopting different stellar evolutionary\ncalculations. The CS mass of IRAS 18333-2357, though, depends strongly on its\ntemperature, which remains elusive due to reddening uncertainties. For all four\nobjects, we consider their CS and nebular masses, their morphologies, and other\nincongruities to assess the likelihood that these objects formed from binary\nstars. Although generally limited by uncertainties (~0.02 Msun) in post-AGB\ntracks and core mass vs. luminosity relations, the high-mass CS in K 648\nindicates a binary origin. The CS of JaFu 1 exhibits compact bright [O III] and\nHalpha emission, like EGB 6, suggesting a binary companion or disk. Evidence is\nweaker for a binary origin of JaFu 2.\n", "  We investigate how the hydrostatic suppression of baryonic accretion affects\nthe growth rate of dark matter halos during the Epoch of Reionization. By\ncomparing halo properties in a simplistic hydrodynamic simulation in which gas\nonly cools adiabatically, with its collisionless equivalent, we find that halo\ngrowth is slowed as hydrostatic forces prevent gas from collapsing. In our\nsimulations, at the high redshifts relevant for reionization (between ${\\sim}6$\nand ${\\sim}11$), halos that host dwarf galaxies ($\\lesssim 10^{9}\n\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$) can be reduced by up to a factor of 2 in mass due to the\nhydrostatic pressure of baryons. Consequently, the inclusion of baryonic\neffects reduces the amplitude of the low mass tail of the halo mass function by\nfactors of 2 to 4. In addition, we find that the fraction of baryons in dark\nmatter halos hosting dwarf galaxies at high redshift never exceeds ${\\sim}90\\%$\nof the cosmic baryon fraction. When implementing baryonic processes, including\ncooling, star formation, supernova feedback and reionization, the suppression\neffects become more significant with further reductions of ${\\sim}30\\%$ to\n60\\%. Although convergence tests suggest that the suppression may become weaker\nin higher resolution simulations, this suppressed growth will be important for\nsemi-analytic models of galaxy formation, in which the halo mass inherited from\nan underlying N-body simulation directly determines galaxy properties. Based on\nthe adiabatic simulation, we provide tables to account for these effects in\nN-body simulations, and present a modification of the halo mass function along\nwith explanatory analytic calculations.\n", "  Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are a population of extragalactic objects\nwhose luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit for a 10 Msun black hole (BH).\nTheir properties have been widely interpreted in terms of accreting\nstellar-mass or intermediate-mass BHs. However at least three neutron stars\n(NSs) have been recently identified in ULXs through the discovery of periodic\npulsations. Motivated by these findings we studied the spectral properties of a\nsample of bright ULXs using a simple continuum model which was extensively used\nto fit the X-ray spectra of accreting magnetic NSs in the Galaxy. We found that\nsuch a model, consisting of a power-law with a high-energy exponential cut-off,\nfits very well most of the ULX spectra analyzed here, at a level comparable to\nthat of models involving an accreting BH. On these grounds alone we suggest\nthat other non-pulsating ULXs may host NSs. We found also that above 2 keV the\nspectrum of known pulsating ULXs is harder than that of the majority of the\nother ULXs of the sample, with only IC 342 X-1 and Ho IX X-1 displaying spectra\nof comparable hardness. We thus suggest that these two ULXs may host an\naccreting NS and encourage searches for periodic pulsations in the flux.\n", "  The deformation parameters beta and gamma together with the two-quasiparticle\nexcitations are taken into account, for the first time, as coordinates within a\nsymmetry conserving (angular momentum and particle number) generator coordinate\nmethod. The simultaneous consideration of collective as well as single particle\ndegrees of freedom allows us to describe soft and rigid nuclei as well as the\ntransition region in between.\n  We apply the new theory to the study of the spectra and transition\nprobabilities of the 156-172Er isotopes with a Pairing plus Quadrupole residual\ninteraction. Good agreement with the experimental results is obtained for most\nof the observables studied and with the same quality for the very soft and the\nstrongly deformed nuclei.\n", "  We present the detection of four far-infrared fine-structure oxygen lines, as\nwell as strong upper limits for the CO(2-1) and [N II] 205 um lines, in 3C 368,\na well-studied radio-loud galaxy at z = 1.131. These new oxygen lines, taken in\nconjunction with previously observed neon and carbon fine-structure lines,\nsuggest a powerful active galactic nucleus (AGN), accompanied by vigorous and\nextended star formation. A starburst dominated by O8 stars, with an age of ~6.5\nMyr, provides a good fit to the fine-structure line data. This estimated age of\nthe starburst makes it nearly concurrent with the latest episode of AGN\nactivity, suggesting a link between the growth of the supermassive black hole\nand stellar population in this source. We do not detect the CO(2-1) line, down\nto a level twelve times lower than the expected value for star forming\ngalaxies. This lack of CO line emission is consistent with recent star\nformation activity if the star-forming molecular gas has low metallicity, is\nhighly fractionated (such that CO is photodissociated through much of the\nclouds), or is chemically very young (such that CO has not yet had time to\nform). It is also possible, though we argue unlikely, that the ensemble of fine\nstructure lines are emitted from the region heated by the AGN.\n", "  Continuum and reflection spectral models have each been widely employed in\nmeasuring the spins of accreting black holes. However, the two approaches have\nnot been implemented together in a photon-conserving, self-consistent\nframework. We develop such a framework using the black-hole X-ray binary GX\n339-4 as a touchstone source, and we demonstrate three important ramifications:\n(1) Compton scattering of reflection emission in the corona is routinely\nignored, but is an essential consideration given that reflection is linked to\nthe regimes with strongest Comptonization. Properly accounting for this causes\nthe inferred reflection fraction to increase substantially, especially for the\nhard state. Another important impact of the Comptonization of reflection\nemission by the corona is the downscattered tail. Downscattering has the\npotential to mimic the relativistically-broadened red wing of the Fe line\nassociated with a spinning black hole. (2) Recent evidence for a reflection\ncomponent with a harder spectral index than the power-law continuum is\nnaturally explained as Compton-scattered reflection emission. (3) Photon\nconservation provides an important constraint on the hard state's accretion\nrate. For bright hard states, we show that disk truncation to large scales (R\nmuch larger than the ISCO radius) is unlikely as this would require accretion\nrates far in excess of the brightest soft states. Our principal conclusion is\nthat when modeling relativistically-broadened reflection, spectral models\nshould allow for coronal Compton scattering of the reflection features, and\nwhen possible, take advantage of the additional constraining power from linking\nto the thermal disk component.\n", "  We present the combined Chandra and Swift-BAT spectral analysis of seven\nSeyfert 2 galaxies selected from the Swift-BAT 100-month catalog. We selected\nnearby (z<=0.03) sources lacking of a ROSAT counterpart and never previously\nobserved with Chandra in the 0.3-10 keV energy range, and targeted these\nobjects with 10 ks Chandra ACIS-S observations. The X-ray spectral fitting over\nthe 0.3-150 keV energy range allows us to determine that all the objects are\nsignificantly obscured, having NH>=1E23 cm^(-2) at a >99% confidence level.\nMoreover, one to three sources are candidate Compton thick Active Galactic\nNuclei (CT-AGN), i.e., have NH>=1E24 cm^(-2). We also test the recent \"spectral\ncurvature\" method developed by Koss et al. (2016) to find candidate CT-AGN,\nfinding a good agreement between our results and their predictions. Since the\nselection criteria we adopted have been effective in detecting highly obscured\nAGN, further observations of these and other Seyfert 2 galaxies selected from\nthe Swift-BAT 100-month catalog will allow us to create a statistically\nsignificant sample of highly obscured AGN, therefore better understanding the\nphysics of the obscuration processes.\n", "  Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs), a major component of space weather,\npropagate through the interplanetary medium strongly guided by the\nInterplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF). In this work, we analyse the implications\na flat Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) has on proton propagation from SEP\nrelease sites to the Earth. We simulate proton propagation by integrating fully\n3-D trajectories near an analytically defined flat current sheet, collecting\ncomprehensive statistics into histograms, fluence maps and virtual observer\ntime profiles within an energy range of 1--800 MeV. We show that protons\nexperience significant current sheet drift to distant longitudes, causing time\nprofiles to exhibit multiple components, which are a potential source of\nconfusing interpretation of observations. We find that variation of current\nsheet thickness within a realistic parameter range has little effect on\nparticle propagation. We show that IMF configuration strongly affects\ndeceleration of protons. We show that in our model, the presence of a flat\nequatorial HCS in the inner heliosphere limits the crossing of protons into the\nopposite hemisphere.\n", "  Observationally measuring the location of the H$_{2}$O snowline is crucial\nfor understanding the planetesimal and planet formation processes, and the\norigin of water on Earth. In disks around Herbig Ae stars ($T_{\\mathrm{*}}\\sim$\n10,000K, $M_{\\mathrm{*}}\\gtrsim$ 2.5$M_{\\bigodot}$), the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline is further from the central star compared with that around\ncooler, and less massive T Tauri stars. Thus, the H$_{2}$O emission line fluxes\nfrom the region within the H$_{2}$O snowline are expected to be stronger. In\nthis paper, we calculate the chemical composition of a Herbig Ae disk using\nchemical kinetics. Next, we calculate the H$_{2}$O emission line profiles, and\ninvestigate the properties of candidate water lines across a wide range of\nwavelengths (from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter) that can locate the position\nof the H$_{2}$O snowline. Those line identified have small Einstein $A$\ncoefficients ($\\sim 10^{-6} -10^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$) and relatively high upper state\nenergies ($\\sim$ 1000K). The total fluxes tend to increase with decreasing\nwavelengths. We investigate the possibility of future observations (e.g., ALMA,\nSPICA/SMI-HRS) to locate the position of the H$_{2}$O snowline. Since the\nfluxes of those identified lines from Herbig Ae disks are stronger than those\nfrom T Tauri disks, the possibility of a successful detection is expected to\nincrease for a Herbig Ae disk.\n", "  Broad emission-line outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been\nproposed for many years but are very difficult to quantitatively study because\nof the coexistence of the gravitationally-bound and outflow emission. We\npresent detailed analysis of a heavily reddened quasar, SDSS\nJ000610.67+121501.2, whose normal ultraviolet (UV) broad emission lines (BELs)\nare heavily suppressed by the Dusty Torus as a natural \"Coronagraph\", thus the\nblueshifted BELs (BBELs) can be reliably measured. The physical properties of\nthe emission-line outflows are derived as follows: ionization parameter $U \\sim\n10^{-0.5}$, column density $N_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{22.0}$ cm$^{-2}$, covering\nfraction of $\\sim 0.1$ and upper limit density of $n_{\\rm H}\\sim 10^{5.8}$\ncm$^{-3}$. The outflow gases are located at least 41 pc away from the central\nengine, which suggests that they have expanded to the scale of the dust torus\nor beyond. Besides, Lya shows a narrow symmetric component, to our surprise,\nwhich is undetected in any other lines. After inspecting the narrow\nemission-line region and the starforming region as the origin of the Lya narrow\nline, we propose the end-result of outflows, diffusing gases in the larger\nregion, acts as the screen of Lya photons. Future high spatial resolution\nspectrometry and/or spectropolarimetric observation are needed to make a final\nclarification.\n", "  Radio astronomy has traditionally depended on observatories allocating time\nto observers for exclusive use of their telescopes. The disadvantage of this\nscheme is that the data thus collected is rarely used for other astronomy\napplications, and in many cases, is unsuitable. For example, properly\ncalibrated pulsar search data can, with some reduction, be used for spectral\nline surveys. A backend that supports plugging in multiple applications to a\ntelescope to perform commensal data analysis will vastly increase the science\nthroughput of the facility. In this paper, we present 'SETIBURST', a robotic,\ncommensal, realtime multi-science backend for the 305-m Arecibo Telescope. The\nsystem uses the 1.4 GHz, seven-beam Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver\nwhenever it is operated. SETIBURST currently supports two applications:\nSERENDIP VI, a SETI spectrometer that is conducting a search for signs of\ntechnological life, and ALFABURST, a fast transient search system that is\nconducting a survey of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Based on the FRB event rate\nand the expected usage of ALFA, we expect 0-5 FRB detections over the coming\nyear. SETIBURST also provides the option of plugging in more applications. We\noutline the motivation for our instrumentation scheme and the scientific\nmotivation of the two surveys, along with their descriptions and related\ndiscussions.\n", "  Fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to\ninvestigate how a liquid-like water droplet behaves when into contact with a\nnanopore formed by carbon nanotube arrays. We have considered different tube\narrays, varying the spacing between them, as well as, different chemical\nfunctionalizations on the uncapped nanotubes. Our results show that simple\nfunctionalizations (for instance, hydrogen ones) allow tuning up the wetting\nsurface properties increasing the permeation of liquid inside the nanopore. For\nfunctionalizations that increase the surface hydrophilicity, even when the pore\nsize is significantly increased the droplet remains at the surface without tube\npermeation.\n", "  Here we present positions and radial velocities for over 4000 globular\nclusters (GCs) in 27 nearby early-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey. The\nSLUGGS survey is designed to be representative of elliptical and lenticular\ngalaxies in the stellar mass range 10 $<$ log M$_{\\ast}$/M$_{\\odot}$ $<$ 11.7.\nThe data have been obtained over many years, mostly using the very stable\nmulti-object spectrograph DEIMOS on the Keck II 10m telescope. Radial\nvelocities are measured using the calcium triplet lines with a velocity\naccuracy of $\\pm$ 10-15 km/s. We use phase space diagrams (i.e.\nvelocity--position diagrams) to identify contaminants such as foreground stars\nand background galaxies, and to show that the contribution of GCs from\nneighboring galaxies is generally insignificant. Likely ultra-compact dwarfs\nare tabulated separately. We find that the mean velocity of the GC system is\nclose to that of the host galaxy systemic velocity, indicating that the GC\nsystem is in overall dynamical equilibrium within the galaxy potential. We also\nfind that the GC system velocity dispersion scales with host galaxy stellar\nmass in a similar manner to the Faber-Jackson relation for the stellar velocity\ndispersion. Publication of these GC radial velocity catalogs should enable\nfurther studies in many areas, such as GC system substructure, kinematics, and\nhost galaxy mass measurements.\n", "  Although for many solar physics problems the desirable or meaningful boundary\nis the radial component of the magnetic field $B_{\\rm r}$, the most readily\navailable measurement is the component of the magnetic field along the\nline-of-sight to the observer, $B_{\\rm los}$. As this component is only equal\nto the radial component where the viewing angle is exactly zero, some\napproximation is required to estimate $B_{\\rm r}$ at all other observed\nlocations. In this study, a common approximation known as the\n\"$\\mu$-correction\", which assumes all photospheric field to be radial, is\ncompared to a method which invokes computing a potential field that matches the\nobserved $B_{\\rm los}$, from which the potential field radial component,\n$B_{\\rm r}^{\\rm pot}$ is recovered. We demonstrate that in regions that are\ntruly dominated by radially-oriented field at the resolution of the data\nemployed, the $\\mu$-correction performs acceptably if not better than the\npotential-field approach. However, it is also shown that for any solar\nstructure which includes horizontal fields, i.e. active regions, the\npotential-field method better recovers both the strength of the radial field\nand the location of magnetic neutral line.\n", "  We present 450 and 850 micron submillimetre continuum observations of the\nIC5146 star-forming region taken as part of the JCMT Gould Belt Survey. We\ninvestigate the location of bright submillimetre (clumped) emission with the\nlarger-scale molecular cloud through comparison with extinction maps, and find\nthat these denser structures correlate with higher cloud column density.\nNinety-six individual submillimetre clumps are identified using FellWalker and\ntheir physical properties are examined. These clumps are found to be relatively\nmassive, ranging from 0.5to 116 MSun with a mean mass of 8 MSun and a median\nmass of 3.7 MSun. A stability analysis for the clumps suggest that the majority\nare (thermally) Jeans stable, with M/M_J < 1. We further compare the locations\nof known protostars with the observed submillimetre emission, finding that\nyounger protostars, i.e., Class 0 and I sources, are strongly correlated with\nsubmillimetre peaks and that the clumps with protostars are among the most\nJeans unstable. Finally, we contrast the evolutionary conditions in the two\nmajor star-forming regions within IC5146: the young cluster associated with the\nCocoon Nebula and the more distributed star formation associated with the\nNorthern Streamer filaments. The Cocoon Nebula appears to have converted a\nhigher fraction of its mass into dense clumps and protostars, the clumps are\nmore likely to be Jeans unstable, and a larger fraction of these remaining\nclumps contain embedded protostars. The Northern Streamer, however, has a\nlarger number of clumps in total and a larger fraction of the known protostars\nare still embedded within these clumps.\n", "  Using the high-quality observations of the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we\npresent the interaction of two filaments (F1 and F2) in a long filament channel\nassociated with twin coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on 2016 January 26. Before\nthe eruption, a sequence of rapid cancellation and emergence of the magnetic\nflux has been observed, which likely triggered the ascending of the west\nfilament (F1). The east footpoints of rising F1 moved toward the east far end\nof the filament channel, accompanying with post-eruption loops and flare\nribbons. It likely indicated a large-scale eruption involving the long filament\nchannel, resulted from the interaction between F1 and the east filament (F2).\nSome bright plasma flew over F2, and F2 stayed at rest during the eruption,\nlikely due to the confinement of its overlying lower magnetic field.\nInterestingly, the impulsive F1 pushed its overlying magnetic arcades to form\nthe first CME, and F1 finally evolved into the second CME after the collision\nwith the nearby coronal hole. We suggest that the interaction of F1 and the\noverlying magnetic field of F2 led to the merging reconnection that form a\nlonger eruptive filament loop. Our results also provide a possible picture of\nthe origin of twin CMEs, and show the large-scale magnetic topology of the\ncoronal hole is important for the eventual propagation direction of CMEs.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC opened up a new possibility to\nobtain a precise understanding of the origin of mass and the structure of the\nvacuum. Several theories beyond the Standard Model predict an extended Higgs\nsector, with additional scalar particles. We outline the complementary search\npossibilities for these beyond Standard Model Higgs bosons at the LHC and at\npossible future high-energy collider facilities.\n", "  We present a study of the continuum polarization over the 400--600 nm range\nof 19 Type Ia SNe obtained with FORS at the VLT. We separate them in those that\nshow Na I D lines at the velocity of their hosts and those that do not.\nContinuum polarization of the sodium sample near maximum light displays a broad\nrange of values, from extremely polarized cases like SN 2006X to almost\nunpolarized ones like SN 2011ae. The non--sodium sample shows, typically,\nsmaller polarization values. The continuum polarization of the sodium sample in\nthe 400--600 nm range is linear with wavelength and can be characterized by the\nmean polarization (P$_{\\rm{mean}}$). Its values span a wide range and show a\nlinear correlation with color, color excess, and extinction in the visual band.\nLarger dispersion correlations were found with the equivalent width of the Na I\nD and Ca II H & K lines, and also a noisy relation between P$_{\\rm{mean}}$ and\n$R_{V}$, the ratio of total to selective extinction. Redder SNe show stronger\ncontinuum polarization, with larger color excesses and extinctions. We also\nconfirm that high continuum polarization is associated with small values of\n$R_{V}$.\n  The correlation between extinction and polarization -- and polarization\nangles -- suggest that the dominant fraction of dust polarization is imprinted\nin interstellar regions of the host galaxies.\n  We show that Na I D lines from foreground matter in the SN host are usually\nassociated with non-galactic ISM, challenging the typical assumptions in\nforeground interstellar polarization models.\n", "  The late-type Be star $\\beta$ CMi is remarkably stable compared to other Be\nstars that have been studied. This has led to a realistic model of the\noutflowing Be disk by Klement et al. These results showed that the disk is\nlikely truncated at a finite radius from the star, which Klement et al.~suggest\nis evidence for an unseen binary companion in orbit. Here we report on an\nanalysis of the Ritter Observatory spectroscopic archive of $\\beta$ CMi to\nsearch for evidence of the elusive companion. We detect periodic Doppler shifts\nin the wings of the H$\\alpha$ line with a period of 170 d and an amplitude of\n2.25 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with a low-mass binary companion ($M\\approx 0.42\nM_\\odot$). We then compared the small changes in the violet-to-red peak height\nchanges ($V/R$) with the orbital motion. We find weak evidence that it does\nfollow the orbital motion, as suggested by recent Be binary models by Panoglou\net al. Our results, which are similar to those for several other Be stars,\nsuggest that $\\beta$ CMi may be a product of binary evolution where Roche lobe\noverflow has spun up the current Be star, likely leaving a hot subdwarf or\nwhite dwarf in orbit around the star. Unfortunately, no direct sign of this\ncompanion star is found in the very limited archive of {\\it International\nUltraviolet Explorer} spectra.\n", "  The old novae V533 Her (Nova Her 1963), DI Lac (Nova Lac 1910) and RR Pic\n(Nova Pic 1891) are in (or near) their quiescent stage following their nova\nexplosions and continue to accrete at a high rate in the aftermath of their\nexplosions. They exhibit continua that are steeply rising into the FUV as well\nas absorption lines and emission lines of uncertain origin. All three have FUSE\nspectra which offer not only higher spectral resolution but also wavelength\ncoverage extending down to the Lyman Limit. For DI Lac, we have matched these\nFUSE spectra with existing archival IUE spectral coverage to broaden the FUV\nwavelength coverage. We adopted the newly determined interstellar reddening\ncorrections of Selvelli and Gilmozzi (2013). The dereddened FUV spectra have\nbeen modeled with our grids of optically thick accretion disks and hot, NLTE\nwhite dwarf photospheres.\n  The results of our modeling analysis indicate that the hot component in RR\nPic and V533 Her is likely to be the accretion disk with a mass accretion of\n$10^{-8}M_{\\odot}$/yr and $10^{-9}M_{\\odot}$/yr respectively. However, the disk\ncannot produce the observed absorption lines. For the WD to be the source of\nthe absorption lines in these two systems, it must be very hot with a radius\nseveral times its expected size (since the WD in these systems is massive, it\nhas a smaller radius). For DI Lac we find the best fit to be a disk with\n$\\dot{M}=10^{-10}M_{\\odot}$/yr with a 30,000K WD.\n", "  I demonstrate four tight correlations of total baryonic mass, velocity and\nradius for a set of nearby disk galaxies: the Mass-Velocity relation $ Mt\n\\propto V^4$; the Mass-Radius relation $ Mt \\propto R^2$; the Radius-Velocity\nrelation $R \\propto V^2$; and the Mass-Radius-Velocity relation $ Mt \\propto R\nV^2$. The Mass-Velocity relation is the familiar Baryonic Tully-Fisher\nrelation(BTFR) and versions of the other three relations, using magnitude\nrather than baryonic mass, are also well known. These four observed\ncorrelations follow from a pair of more fundamental relations. First, the\ncentripetal acceleration at the edge of the stellar disk is proportional to the\nacceleration predicted by Newtonian physics and secondly, this acceleration is\na constant which is related to Milgrom's constant. The two primary relations\ncan be manipulated algebraically to generate the four observed correlations and\nallow little room for dark matter inside the radius of the stellar disk. The\nprimary relations do not explain the velocity of the outer gaseous disks of\nspiral galaxies which do not trace the Newtonian gravitational field of the\nobserved matter.\n", "  The Candidate Cluster and Protocluster Catalog (CCPC) contains 218 galaxy\noverdensities com- posed of more than 2000 galaxies with spectroscopic\nredshifts spanning the first few Gyrs after the Big Bang (2.0 < z < 6.6). We\nuse Spitzer archival data to track the underlying stellar mass of these\noverdense regions in various temporal cross sections by building rest-frame\nnear-infrared luminosity functions across the span of redshifts.This exercise\nmaps the stellar growth of protocluster galaxies, as halos in the densest\nenvironments should be the most massive from hierarchical accretion. The\ncharacteristic apparent magnitude, m*(z), is relatively flat from 2.0 < z <\n6.6, consistent with a passive evolution of an old stellar population. This\ntrend maps smoothly to lower redshift results of cluster galaxies from other\nworks. We find no difference in the luminosity\n", "  N103B is a Type Ia supernova remnant (SNR) projected in the outskirt of the\nsuperbubble around the rich cluster NGC 1850 in the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). We have obtained H$\\alpha$ and continuum images of N103B with the\n$\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ ($\\textit{HST}$) and high-dispersion spectra\nwith 4m and 1.5m telescopes at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The\n$\\textit{HST}$ H$\\alpha$ image exhibits a complex system of nebular knots\ninside an incomplete filamentary elliptical shell that opens to the east where\nX-ray and radio emission extends further out. Electron densities of the nebular\nknots, determined from the [S II] doublet, reach 5300 cm$^{-3}$, indicating an\norigin of circumstellar medium, rather than interstellar medium. The\nhigh-dispersion spectra reveal three kinematic components in N103B: (1) a\nnarrow component with [N II]6583/H$\\alpha$ $\\sim$ 0.14 from the ionized\ninterstellar gas associated with the superbubble of NGC 1850 in the background,\n(2) a broader H$\\alpha$ component with no [N II] counterpart from the SNR's\ncollisionless shocks into a mostly neutral ambient medium, and (3) a broad\ncomponent, $\\Delta V$ $\\sim$ 500 km s$^{-1}$, in both H$\\alpha$ and [N II]\nlines from shocked material in the nebular knots. The Balmer-dominated\nfilaments can be fitted by an ellipse, and we adopt its center as the site of\nSN explosion. We find that the star closest to this explosion center has colors\nand luminosity consistent with a 1 $M_\\odot$ surviving subgiant companion as\nmodelled by Podsiadlowski. Follow-up spectroscopic observations are needed to\nconfirm this star as the SN's surviving companion.\n", "  Recent investigations have shown that the extended main-sequence turnoffs\n(eMSTOs) are a common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the\nMagellanic Clouds. The eMSTOs are also found in the color-magnitude diagram\n(CMD) of young-age star clusters. The origin of the eMSTOs is still an open\nquestion. Moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting\nparameter $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars\nwith an approximatelly equal mass. Thus the MSTO of star clusters may be\naffected by the overshooting of the convective core (OVCC). We calculated the\neffects of the OVCC with different $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ on the MSTO of young- and\nintermediate-age star clusters. \\textbf{If $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ varies between\nstars in a cluster,} the observed eMSTOs of young- and intermediate-age star\nclusters can be explained well by the effects. The equivalent age spreads of\nMSTO caused by the OVCC are related to the age of star clusters and are in good\nagreement with observed results of many clusters. Moreover, the observed eMSTOs\nof NGC 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different\n$\\delta_{\\rm ov}$. The eMSTOs of star clusters may be relevant to the effects\nof the OVCC. The effects of the OVCC \\textbf{are similar to that of rotation in\nsome respects. But the effects cannot result in a significant split of main\nsequence of young star clusters at $m_{U}\\lesssim 21$.} The presence of a rapid\nrotation can make the split of main sequence of young star clusters more\nsignificant.\n", "  Standard candles can probe the evolution of dark energy in a large redshift\nrange. But the cosmic opacity can degrade the quality of standard candles. In\nthis paper, we use the latest observations, including type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) from JLA sample and Hubble parameters, to probe the opacity of the\nuniverse. In order to avoid the cosmological dependence of SNe Ia luminosity\ndistances, a joint fitting of the SNe Ia light-curve parameters, cosmological\nparameters and opacity is used. In order to explore the cosmic opacity at high\nredshifts, the latest gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are used. At high redshifts,\ncosmic reionization process is considered. We find that the sample supports an\nalmost transparent universe for flat $\\Lambda$CDM and XCDM models. Meanwhile,\nfree electrons deplete photons from standard candles through the (inverse)\nCompton scattering, known as an important component of opacity. This Compton\ndimming may paly an important role in future supernova surveys. From analysis,\nwe find that about a few percent cosmic opacity is caused by Compton dimming in\nthe two models, which can be correctable.\n", "  Luminosity correlations of long Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are extensively\nproposed as an effective complementarity to trace the Hubble diagram of\nUniverse at high redshifts, which is of great importance to explore properties\nof dark energy. Recently, several empirical luminosity correlations have been\nstatistically proposed from GRB observations. However, to treat GRB as the\ndistance indicator, there are two key issues: the redshift evolution of\nluminosity correlations and their calibrations. In this paper, we choose the\nAmati relation, the correlation between the peak spectra energy and the\nequivalent isotropic energy of GRBs ($E_{\\rm p}-E_{\\rm iso}$), as an example,\nand find that the current GRB dataset implies that there could be a evolution\nof the luminosity correlation with respect to the redshift. Therefore, we\npropose an extended Amati relation with two extra redshift-dependent terms to\ncorrect the redshift evolution of GRB relation. Secondly, we carefully check\nthe reliability of the calibration method using the low-redshift GRB data.\nImportantly, we find that the low-redshift calibration method does not take\nwhole correlations between $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and coefficients into account.\nNeglecting these correlation information can break the degeneracies and obtain\nthe biased constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ which is very sensitive to values of\nparameters for the calibration. A small shift of parameters of \"calibrated\"\nrelation could significantly change the final constraint on $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ in\nthe low-redshift calibration method. Finally, we simulate several GRB samples\nwith different statistical errors and find that, in order to correctly recover\nthe fiducial value of $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ using the low-redshift calibration\nmethod, we need a large number of GRB samples with high precisions.\n", "  A correlation among the radio luminosity ($L_{\\rm R}$), X-ray luminosity\n($L_{\\rm X}$), and black hole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) in active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) and black hole binaries is known to exist and is called the \"Fundamental\nPlane\" of black hole activity. Yuan & Cui (2005) predicts that the radio/X-ray\ncorrelation index, $\\xi_{\\rm X}$, changes from $\\xi_{\\rm X}\\approx 0.6$ to\n$\\xi_{\\rm X}\\approx 1.2-1.3$ when $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ decreases below a\ncritical value $\\sim 10^{-6}$. While many works favor such a change, there are\nalso several works claiming the opposite. In this paper, we gather from\nliterature a largest quiescent AGN (defined as $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} <\n10^{-6}$) sample to date, consisting of $75$ sources. We find that these\nquiescent AGNs follow a $\\xi_{\\rm X}\\approx 1.23$ radio/X-ray relationship, in\nexcellent agreement with the Yuan \\& Cui prediction. The reason for the\ndiscrepancy between the present result and some previous works is that their\nsamples contain not only quiescent sources but also \"normal\" ones (i.e.,\n$L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd} > 10^{-6}$). In this case, the quiescent sources will\nmix up with those normal ones in $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$. The value of\n$\\xi_{\\rm X}$ will then be between $0.6$ and $\\sim1.3$, with the exact value\nbeing determined by the sample composition, i.e., the fraction of the quiescent\nand normal sources. Based on this result, we propose that a more physical way\nto study the Fundamental Plane is to replace $L_{\\rm R}$ and $L_{\\rm X}$ with\n$L_{\\rm R}/L_{\\rm Edd}$ and $L_{\\rm X}/L_{\\rm Edd}$, respectively.\n", "  We present a principal component analysis of 23 line of sight parameters\n(including the strengths of 16 diffuse interstellar bands, DIBs) for a\nwell-chosen sample of single-cloud sightlines representing a broad range of\nenvironmental conditions. Our analysis indicates that the majority ($\\sim$93\\%)\nof the variations in the measurements can be captured by only four parameters\nThe main driver (i.e., the first principal component) is the amount of\nDIB-producing material in the line of sight, a quantity that is extremely well\ntraced by the equivalent width of the $\\lambda$5797 DIB. The second principal\ncomponent is the amount of UV radiation, which correlates well with the\n$\\lambda$5797/$\\lambda$5780 DIB strength ratio. The remaining two principal\ncomponents are more difficult to interpret, but are likely related to the\nproperties of dust in the line of sight (e.g., the gas-to-dust ratio). With our\nPCA results, the DIBs can then be used to estimate these line of sight\nparameters.\n", "  An X1.6 flare occurred in AR 12192 on 2014 October 22 at 14:02 UT and was\nobserved by Hinode, IRIS, SDO, and RHESSI. We analyze a bright kernel which\nproduces a white light (WL) flare with continuum enhancement and a hard X-ray\n(HXR) peak. Taking advantage of the spectroscopic observations of IRIS and\nHinode/EIS, we measure the temporal variation of the plasma properties in the\nbright kernel in the chromosphere and corona. We found that explosive\nevaporation was observed when the WL emission occurred, even though the\nintensity enhancement in hotter lines is quite weak. The temporal correlation\nof the WL emission, HXR peak, and evaporation flows indicate that the WL\nemission was produced by accelerated electrons. To understand the white light\nemission process, we calculated the energy flux deposited by non- thermal\nelectrons (observed by RHESSI) and compared it to the dissipated energy\nestimated from a chromospheric line (Mg II triplet) observed by IRIS. The\ndeposited energy flux from the non-thermal electrons is about 3 ~ 7.7 X 10^(10)\nerg cm^(-2) s^(-1) for a given low energy cut-off of 30 ~ 40 keV, assuming the\nthick target model. The energy flux estimated from the temperature changes in\nthe chromosphere measured using the Mg II subordinate line is about 4.6 - 6.7 X\n10(9) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1): ~6-22% of the deposited energy. This comparison of\nestimated energy fluxes implies that the continuum enhancement was directly\nproduced by the non-thermal electrons.\n", "  Presolar grains are small particles found in meteorites through their\nisotopic compositions which are considerably different from those of materials\nin the Solar System. If some isotopes in presolar grains diffused out beyond\ntheir grain sizes when they were embedded in parent bodies of meteorites, their\nisotopic compositions could be washed out, and hence the grains cannot be\nidentified as presolar grains any more. We explore this possibility for the\nfirst time by self-consistently simulating the thermal evolution of\nplanetesimals and the diffusion length of $^{18}$O in presolar silicate grains.\nOur results show that presolar silicate grains smaller than $\\sim$ 0.03 $\\mu m$\ncannot keep their original isotopic compositions even if the host planetesimals\nexperienced maximum temperature as low as 600 $^{\\circ}$C. Since this\ntemperature corresponds to the one experienced by petrologic type 3 chondrites,\nthe isotopic diffusion can constrain the size of presolar silicate grains\ndiscovered in such chondrites to be larger than $\\sim$ 0.03 $\\mu m$. We also\nfind that the diffusion lengths of $^{18}$O reach $\\sim$ 0.3-2 $\\mu m$ in\nplanetesimals that were heated up to 700-800 $^{\\circ}$C. This indicates that,\nif the original size of presolar grains spans a range from $\\sim$ 0.001 $\\mu m$\nto $\\sim$ 0.3 $\\mu m$ like that in the interstellar medium, the isotopic\nrecords of the presolar grains may be almost completely lost in such highly\nthermalized parent bodies. We propose that isotopic diffusion could be a key\nprocess to control the size distribution and abundance of presolar grains in\nsome types of chondrites.\n", "  Accurate estimates of the horizontal electric field on the Sun's visible\nsurface are important not only for estimating the Poynting flux of magnetic\nenergy into the corona but also for driving time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic\nmodels of the corona. In this paper, a method is developed for estimating the\nhorizontal electric field from a sequence of radial-component magnetic field\nmaps. This problem of inverting Faraday's law has no unique solution.\nUnfortunately, the simplest solution (a divergence-free electric field) is not\nrealistically localized in regions of non-zero magnetic field, as would be\nexpected from Ohm's law. Our new method generates instead a localized solution,\nusing a basis pursuit algorithm to find a sparse solution for the electric\nfield. The method is shown to perform well on test cases where the input\nmagnetic maps are flux balanced, in both Cartesian and spherical geometries.\nHowever, we show that if the input maps have a significant imbalance of flux -\nusually arising from data assimilation - then it is not possible to find a\nlocalized, realistic, electric field solution. This is the main obstacle to\ndriving coronal models from time sequences of solar surface magnetic maps.\n", "  Flare associated coronal shock waves sometimes interact with solar\nprominences leading to large amplitude prominence oscillations. Such prominence\nactivation gives us unique opportunity to track time evolution of shock-cloud\ninteraction in cosmic plasmas. Although the dynamics of interstellar\nshock-cloud interaction is extensively studied, coronal shock-solar prominence\ninteraction is rarely studied in the context of shock-cloud interaction.\nAssociated with X5.4 class solar flare occurred on 7 March, 2012, a globally\npropagated coronal shock wave interacted with a polar prominence leading to\nlarge amplitude prominence oscillation. In this paper, we studied bulk\nacceleration and excitation of internal flow of the shocked prominence using\nthree-dimensional MHD simulations. We studied eight magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulation runs with different mass density structure of the prominence, and\none hydrodynamic simulation run, and compared the result. In order to compare\nobserved motion of activated prominence with corresponding simulation, we also\nstudied prominence activation by injection of triangular shaped coronal shock.\nWe found that magnetic tension force mainly accelerate (and then decelerate)\nthe prominence. The internal flow, on the other hand, is excited during the\nshock front sweeps through the the prominence and damps almost exponentially.\nWe construct phenomenological model of bulk momentum transfer from shock to the\nprominence, which agreed quantitatively with all the simulation results. Based\non the phenomenological prominence-activation model, we diagnosed physical\nparameters of coronal shock wave. The estimated energy of the coronal shock is\nseveral percent of total energy released during the X5.4 flare.\n", "  With the recent recognition of a second, distinctive class of molecular\noutflows, namely the explosive ones not directly connected to the\naccretion-ejection process in the star formation, a juxtaposition of the\nmorphological and kinematic properties of both classes is warranted. By\napplying the same method used in Zapata et al. (2009), and using\n$^{12}$CO(J=2-1) archival data from the Submillimeter Array (SMA), we contrast\ntwo well known explosive objects, Orion KL and DR21, to HH211 and DG Tau B, two\nflows representative of classical low-mass protostellar outflows. At the moment\nthere are only two well established cases of explosive outflows, but with the\nfull availability of ALMA we expect that more examples will be found in the\nnear future. Main results are the largely different spatial distributions of\nthe explosive flows, consisting of numerous narrow straight filament-like\nejections with different orientations and in almost an isotropic configuration,\nthe red with respect to the blueshifted components of the flows (maximally\nseparated in protostellar, largely overlapping in explosive outflows), the very\nwell-defined Hubble flow-like increase of velocity with distance from the\norigin in the explosive filaments versus the mostly non-organized CO velocity\nfield in protostellar objects, and huge inequalities in mass, momentum and\nenergy of the two classes, at least for the case of low-mass flows. Finally,\nall the molecular filaments in the explosive outflows point back to\napproximately a central position i.e. the place where its \"exciting source\" was\nlocated, contrary to the bulk of the molecular material within the protostellar\noutflows.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope's Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS), will\noffer nearly 2 orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and >3X\nimprovement in spectral resolution over our previous space-based mid-IR\nspectrometer, the Spitzer IRS. In this paper, we make predictions for\nspectroscopic pointed observations and serendipitous detections with the MRS.\nSpecifically, pointed observations of Herschel sources require only a few\nminutes on source integration for detections of several star-forming and active\ngalactic nucleus lines, out to z$=$3 and beyond. But the same data will also\ninclude tens of serendipitous 0$\\lesssim$z$\\lesssim$4 galaxies per field with\ninfrared luminosities ranging $\\sim10^6-10^{13}$L$_{\\odot}$. In particular, for\nthe first time and for free we will be able to explore the\n$L_{IR}<10^{9}L_{\\odot}$ regime out to $z\\sim3$. We estimate that with\n$\\sim$100 such fields, statistics of these detections will be sufficient to\nconstrain the evolution of the low-$L$ end of the infrared luminosity function,\nand hence the star formation rate function. The above conclusions hold for a\nwide range in potential low-$L$ end of the IR luminosity function, and\naccounting for the PAH deficit in low-$L$, low-metallicity galaxies.\n", "  For the interpretation of measurements of radio emission from extensive air\nshowers, an important systematic uncertainty arises from natural variations of\nthe atmospheric refractive index $n$. At a given altitude, the refractivity\n$N=10^6\\, (n-1)$ can have relative variations on the order of $10 \\%$ depending\non temperature, humidity, and air pressure. Typical corrections to be applied\nto $N$ are about $4\\%$. Using CoREAS simulations of radio emission from air\nshowers, we have evaluated the effect of varying $N$ on measurements of the\ndepth of shower maximum $X_{\\rm max}$. For an observation band of 30 to 80 MHz,\na difference of $4 \\%$ in refractivity gives rise to a systematic error in the\ninferred $X_{\\rm max}$ between 3.5 and 11 $\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$, for proton showers\nwith zenith angles ranging from 15 to 50 degrees. At higher frequencies, from\n120 to 250 MHz, the offset ranges from 10 to 22 $\\mathrm{g/cm^2}$. These\noffsets were found to be proportional to the geometric distance to $X_{\\rm\nmax}$. We have compared the results to a simple model based on the Cherenkov\nangle. For the 120 to 250 MHz band, the model is in qualitative agreement with\nthe simulations. In typical circumstances, we find a slight decrease in $X_{\\rm\nmax}$ compared to the default refractivity treatment in CoREAS. While this is\nwithin commonly treated systematic uncertainties, accounting for it explicitly\nimproves the accuracy of $X_{\\rm max}$ measurements.\n", "  Galaxy mass assembly is an end product of structure formation in the\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. As an extension of Lee \\& Yi (2013), we investigate the\nassembly history of stellar components in galaxies as a function of halo\nenvironments and stellar mass using semi-analytic approaches. In our fiducial\nmodel, halo mass intrinsically determines the formation and assembly of the\nstellar mass. Overall, the ex situ fraction slowly increases in central\ngalaxies with increasing halo mass but sharply increases for $\\log\nM_{*}/M_{\\odot}\\gtrsim11$. A similar trend is also found in satellite galaxies,\nwhich implies that mergers are essential to build stellar masses above $\\log\nM_{*}/M_{\\odot}\\sim11$. We also examine the time evolution of the contribution\nof mass growth channels. Mergers become the primary channel in the mass growth\nof central galaxies when their host halo mass begins to exceed $\\log\nM_{200}/M_{\\odot}\\sim13$. However, satellite galaxies seldom reach the\nmerger-dominant phase despite their reduced star formation activities due to\nenvironmental effects.\n", "  The application of GNC devices on small robots is a game-changer that enables\nthese robots to be mobile on low-gravity planetary surfaces and small bodies.\nUse of reaction wheels enables these robots to roll, hop, summersault and rest\non precarious/sloped surfaces that would otherwise not be possible with\nconven-tional wheeled robots. We are extending this technology to enable robots\nto climb off-world canyons, cliffs and caves. A single robot may slip and fall,\nhowever, a multirobot system can work cooperatively by being interlinked using\nspring-tethers and work much like a team of mountaineers to systematically\nclimb a slope. A multirobot system as we will show in this paper can climb\nsur-faces not possible with a single robot alone. We consider a team of four\nrobots that are interlinked with tethers in an 'x' configuration. Each robot\nsecures itself to a slope using spiny gripping actuators, and one by one each\nrobot moves up-wards by crawling, rolling or hopping up the slope. If any one\nof the robots loses grip, slips or falls, the remaining robots will be holding\nit up as they are anchored. This distributed controls approach to cliff\nclimbing enables the system to reconfigure itself where possible and avoid\ngetting stuck at one hard to reach location. Instead, the risk is distributed\nand through close cooperation, the robots can identify multiple trajectories to\nclimb a cliff or rugged surface. The benefits can also be realized on\nmilligravity surfaces such as asteroids. Too fast a jump can result in the\nrobot flying off the surface into space. Having multiple robots anchored to the\nsurface keeps the entire system secure. Our work combines dynamics and control\nsimulation to evaluate the feasibility of our approach. The simulation results\nshow a promising pathway towards advanced development of this technology on a\nteam of real robots.\n", "  Connecting in-situ measured solar-wind plasma properties with typical regions\non the Sun can provide an effective constraint and test to various solar wind\nmodels. We examine the statistical characteristics of the solar wind with an\norigin in different types of source regions. We find that the speed\ndistribution of coronal hole (CH) wind is bimodal with the slow wind peaking at\n~400 km/s and a fast at ~600 km/s. An anti-correlation between the solar wind\nspeeds and the O7+/O6+ ion ratio remains valid in all three types of solar wind\nas well during the three studied solar cycle activity phases, i.e. solar\nmaximum, decline and minimum. The N_Fe/N_O range and its average values all\ndecrease with the increasing solar wind speed in different types of solar wind.\nThe N_Fe/N_O range (0.06-0.40, FIP bias range 1-7) for AR wind is wider than\nfor CH wind (0.06-0.20, FIP bias range 1-3) while the minimum value of N_Fe/N_O\n(0.06) does not change with the variation of speed, and it is similar for all\nsourceregions. The two-peak distribution of CH wind and the anti-correlation\nbetween the speed and O7+/O6+ in all three types of solar wind can be explained\nqualitatively by both the wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) and\nreconnection-loop-opening (RLO) models, whereas the distribution features of\nN_Fe/N_O in different source regions of solar wind can be explained more\nreasonably by the RLO models.\n", "  Turbulent mixing of chemical elements by convection has fundamental effects\non the evolution of stars. The standard algorithm at present, mixing-length\ntheory (MLT), is intrinsically local, and must be supplemented by extensions\nwith adjustable parameters. As a step toward reducing this arbitrariness, we\ncompare asteroseismically inferred internal structures of two Kepler slowly\npulsating B stars (SPB's; $M\\sim 3.25 M_\\odot$) to predictions of 321D\nturbulence theory, based upon well-resolved, truly turbulent three-dimensional\nsimulations (Arnett , et al. 2015, Christini, et al. 2016) which include\nboundary physics absent from MLT. We find promising agreement between the\nsteepness and shapes of the theoretically-predicted composition profile outside\nthe convective region in 3D simulations and in asteroseismically constrained\ncomposition profiles in the best 1D models of the two SPBs. The structure and\nmotion of the boundary layer, and the generation of waves, are discussed.\n", "  Jets from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) inflate large cavities in the hot gas\nenvironment around galaxies and galaxy clusters. The large-scale gas\ncirculation promoted within such cavities by the jet itself gives rise to\nbackflows that propagate back to the center of the jet-cocoon system, spanning\nall the physical scales relevant for the AGN.\n  Using an Adaptive Mesh Refinement code, we study these backflows through a\nseries of numerical experiments, aiming at understanding how their global\nproperties depend on jet parameters. We are able to characterize their mass\nflux down to a scale of a few kiloparsecs to about $0.5\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot/y}$for\nas long as $15$ or $20$ Myr, depending on jet power. We find that backflows are\nboth spatially coherent and temporally textbf{intermittent}, independently of\njet power in the range $10^{43-45}$ erg/s.\n  Using the mass flux thus measured, we model analytically the effect of\nbackflows on the central accretion region, where a Magnetically Arrested Disk\nlies at the center of a thin circumnuclear disk. Backflow accretion onto the\ndisk modifies its density profile, producing a flat core and tail.\n  We use this analytic model to predict how accretion beyond the BH\nmagnetopause is modified, and thus how the jet power is temporally modulated.\nUnder the assumption that the magnetic flux stays frozen in the accreting\nmatter, and that the jets are always launched via the Blandford-Znajek (1977)\nmechanism, we find that backflows are capable of boosting the jet power up to\ntenfold during relatively short time episodes (a few Myr).\n", "  By exploiting two ACS/HST datasets separated by a temporal baseline of ~7\nyears, we have determined the relative stellar proper motions (providing\nmembership) and the absolute proper motion of the Galactic globular cluster\nM71. The absolute proper motion has been used to reconstruct the cluster orbit\nwithin a Galactic, three-component, axisymmetric potential. M71 turns out to be\nin a low latitude disk-like orbit inside the Galactic disk, further supporting\nthe scenario in which it lost a significant fraction of its initial mass. Since\nlarge differential reddening is known to affect this system, we took advantage\nof near-infrared, ground-based observations to re-determine the cluster center\nand density profile from direct star counts. The new structural parameters turn\nout to be significantly different from the ones quoted in the literature. In\nparticular, M71 has a core and a half-mass radii almost 50% larger than\npreviously thought. Finally we estimate that the initial mass of M71 was likely\none order of magnitude larger than its current value, thus helping to solve the\ndiscrepancy with the observed number of X-ray sources.\n", "  The formation of the solar system's terrestrial planets has been numerically\nmodeled in various works, and many other studies have been devoted to\ncharacterizing our modern planets' chaotic dynamical state. However, it is\nstill not known whether our planet's fragile chaotic state is an expected\noutcome of terrestrial planet accretion. We use a suite of numerical\nsimulations to present a detailed analysis and characterization of the\ndynamical chaos in 145 different systems produced via terrestrial planet\nformation in Kaib and Cowan (2015). These systems were created in the presence\nof a fully formed Jupiter and Saturn, using a variety of different initial\nconditions. They are not meant to provide a detailed replication of the actual\npresent solar system, but rather serve as a sample of similar systems for\ncomparison and analysis. We find that dynamical chaos is prevalent in roughly\nhalf of the systems we form. We show that this chaos disappears in the majority\nof such systems when Jupiter is removed, implying that the largest source of\nchaos is perturbations from Jupiter. Chaos is most prevalent in systems that\nform 4 or 5 terrestrial planets. Additionally, an eccentric Jupiter and Saturn\nis shown to enhance the prevalence of chaos in systems. Furthermore, systems in\nour sample with a center of mass highly concentrated between 0.8 -1.2 AU\ngenerally prove to be less chaotic than systems with more exotic mass\ndistributions. Through the process of evolving systems to the current epoch, we\nshow that late instabilities are quite common in our systems. Of greatest\ninterest, many of the sources of chaos observed in our own solar system (such\nas the secularly driven chaos between Mercury and Jupiter) are shown to be\ncommon outcomes of terrestrial planetary formation.\n", "  We present results from WIYN pODI imaging of Lacerta I (And XXXI), a\nsatellite dwarf galaxy discovered in the outskirts of the Andromeda galaxy\n(M31) in Pan-STARRS1 survey data. Our deep, wide-field $g,i$ photometry reaches\n$\\sim$3 magnitudes fainter than the photometry in the Pan-STARRS1 discovery\npaper and allows us to trace the stellar population of Lac I beyond two\nhalf-light radii from the galaxy center. We measure a Tip of the Red Giant\nBranch (TRGB) distance for Lac I of $(m-M)_0=24.44\\pm0.11$ mag (773$\\pm$40 kpc,\nor 264$\\pm$6 kpc from M31), which is consistent with the Pan-STARRS1 distance.\nWe use a maximum-likelihood technique to derive structural properties for the\ngalaxy, and find a half-light radius ($r_h$) of 3.24$\\pm$0.21 arcmin\n(728$\\pm$47 pc), ellipticity ($\\epsilon$) of 0.44$\\pm$0.03, total magnitude\n$M_V$ $=$ $-$11.4$\\pm$0.3, and central surface brightness $\\mu_{V,0}$ $=$\n24.8$\\pm$0.3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find no HI emission in archival data and set\na limit on Lac I's neutral gas mass-to-light ratio of $M_{HI}/L_V$ $<$ 0.06\n$M_{sun}$/$L_{sun}$, confirming Lac I as a gas-poor dwarf spheroidal galaxy.\nPhotometric metallicities derived from Red Giant Branch stars within 2 $r_h$\nyield a median [Fe/H] of $-$1.68$\\pm$0.03, which is more metal-rich than the\nspectroscopically-derived value from Martin et al. (2014). Combining our\nmeasured magnitude with this higher metallicity estimate places Lac I closer to\nits expected position on the luminosity-metallicity relation for dwarf\ngalaxies.\n", "  We study the Planck CMB temperature at different scales through its\nderivatives up to second order, which allows one to characterize the local\nshape and isotropy of the field. The problem of having an incomplete sky in the\ncalculation and statistical characterization of the derivatives is addressed in\nthe paper. The analysis confirms the existence of a low variance in the CMB at\nlarge scales, which is also noticeable in the derivatives. Moreover, deviations\nfrom the standard model in the gradient, curvature and the eccentricity tensor\nare studied in terms of extreme values on the data. As it is expected, the Cold\nSpot is detected as one of the most prominent peaks in terms of curvature, but\nadditionally, when the information of the temperature and its Laplacian are\ncombined, another feature with similar probability at the scale of $10^\\circ$\nis also observed. However, the $p$-value of these two deviations increase above\nthe $6\\%$ when they are referred to the variance calculated from the\ntheoretical fiducial model, indicating that these deviations can be associated\nto the low variance anomaly. Finally, an estimator of the directional\nanisotropy for spinorial quantities is introduced, which is applied to the\nspinors derived from the field derivatives. An anisotropic direction whose\nprobability is $<1\\%$ is detected in the eccentricity tensor.\n", "  In the extragalactic sky, microquasars and ultra-luminous X-ray sources\n(ULXs) are known as energetic compact objects locating at off-nucleus positions\nin galaxies. Some of these objects are associated with expanding bubbles with a\nvelocity of 80-250 ${\\rm km~s^{-1}}$. We investigate the shock acceleration of\nparticles in those expanding nebulae. The nebulae having fast expansion\nvelocity $\\gtrsim120~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ are able to accelerate cosmic rays up to\n$\\sim100$ TeV. If 10% of the shock kinetic energy goes into particle\nacceleration, powerful nebulae such as the microquasar S26 in NGC 7793 would\nemit gamma rays up to several tens TeV with a photon index of $\\sim2$. These\nnebulae will be good targets for future Cherenkov Telescope Array observations\ngiven its sensitivity and angular resolution. They would also contribute to\n$\\sim7$% of the unresolved cosmic gamma-ray background radiation at\n$\\ge0.1~{\\rm GeV}$. In contrast, particle acceleration in slowly expanding\nnebulae $\\lesssim120~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}$ would be less efficient due to\nion-neutral collisions and result in softer spectra at $\\gtrsim10$ GeV.\n", "  Context. Tighter constraints on metal-poor stars we observe are needed to\nbetter understand the chemical processes of the early Universe. Computing a\nstellar spectrum in 3D allows one to model complex stellar behaviours, which\ncannot be replicated in 1D. Aims. We examine the effect that the intrinsic CNO\nabundances have on a 3D model structure and the resulting 3D spectrum\nsynthesis. Methods. Model atmospheres were computed in 3D for three distinct\nCNO chemical compositions using the CO 5 BOLD model atmosphere code, and their\ninternal structures were examined. Synthetic spectra were computed from these\nmodels using Linfor3D and they were compared. New 3D abundance corrections for\nthe G-band and a selection of UV OH lines were also computed. Results. The\nvarying CNO abundances change the metal content of the 3D models. This had an\neffect on the model structure and the resulting synthesis. However, it was\nfound that the C/O ratio had a larger effect than the overall metal content of\na model. Conclusions. Our results suggest that varying the C/O ratio has a\nsubstantial impact on the internal structure of the 3D model, even in the hot\nturn-off star models explored here. This suggests that bespoke 3D models, for\nspecific CNO abundances should be sought. Such effects are not seen in 1D at\nthese temperature regimes.\n", "  We analyse stellar masses of clumps drawn from a compilation of star-forming\ngalaxies at 1.1<z<3.6. Comparing clumps selected in different ways, and in\nlensed or blank field galaxies, we examine the effects of spatial resolution\nand sensitivity on the inferred stellar masses. Large differences are found,\nwith median stellar masses ranging from ~10^9 Msun for clumps in the\noften-referenced field galaxies to ~10^7 Msun for fainter clumps selected in\ndeep-field or lensed galaxies. We argue that the clump masses, observed in\nnon-lensed galaxies with a limited spatial resolution of ~1 kpc, are\nartificially increased due to the clustering of clumps of smaller mass.\nFurthermore, we show that the sensitivity threshold used for the clump\nselection affects the inferred masses even more strongly than resolution,\nbiasing clumps at the low mass end. Both improved spatial resolution and\nsensitivity appear to shift the clump stellar mass distribution to lower\nmasses, qualitatively in agreement with clump masses found in recent\nhigh-resolution simulations of disk fragmentation. We discuss the nature of the\nmost massive clumps, and we conclude that it is currently not possible to\nproperly establish a meaningful clump stellar mass distribution from\nobservations and to infer the existence and value of a characteristic clump\nmass scale.\n", "  We present the first map of carbonicity, [C/Fe], for the halo system of the\nMilky Way, based on a sample of over 100,000 main-sequence turnoff stars with\navailable spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This map, which\nexplores distances up to 15 kpc from the Sun, reveals clear evidence for the\ndual nature of the Galactic halo, based on the spatial distribution of stellar\ncarbonicity. The metallicity distribution functions of stars in the inner- and\nouter-halo regions of the carbonicity map reproduce those previously argued to\narise from contributions of the inner- and outer-halo populations, with peaks\nat [Fe/H] = -1.5 and -2.2, respectively. From consideration of the absolute\ncarbon abundances for our sample, A(C), we also confirm that the\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the outer-halo region exhibit a\nhigher frequency of CEMP-no stars (those with no overabundances of heavy\nneutron-capture elements) than of CEMP-s stars (those with strong\noverabundances of elements associated with the s-process), whereas the stars in\nthe inner-halo region exhibit a higher frequency of CEMP-s stars. We argue that\nthe contrast in the behavior of the CEMP-no and CEMP-s fractions in these\nregions arises from differences in the mass distributions of the mini-halos\nfrom which the stars of the inner- and outer-halo populations formed, which\ngives rise in turn to the observed dichotomy of the Galactic halo.\n", "  Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) are thought to contain a wealth of resources,\nincluding water, iron, titanium, nickel, platinum and silicates. Future space\nmissions that can exploit these resources by performing In-Situ Resource\nUtilization (ISRU) gain substantial benefit in terms of range, payload capacity\nand mission flexibility. Compared to the Moon or Mars, the milligravity on some\nasteroids demands a fraction of the energy for digging and accessing hydrated\nregolith just below the surface. However, asteroids and small-bodies, because\nof their low gravity present a major challenge in landing, surface excavation\nand resource capture. These challenges have resulted in adoption of a \"touch\nand go techniques\", like the upcoming Osiris-rex sample-return mission.\nPrevious asteroid excavation efforts have focused on discrete capture events\n(an extension of sampling technology) or whole-asteroid capture and processing.\nThis paper analyzes the control of a bucket-wheel design for asteroid or\nsmall-body excavation. Our study focuses on system design of two counter\nrotating bucket-wheels that are attached to a hovering spacecraft. Regolith is\nexcavated and heated to 1000 C to extract water. The water in turn is\nelectrolyzed to produce hydrogen and oxygen for rocket fuel. We analyze control\ntechniques to maximize traction of the bucket-wheels on the asteroid surface\nand minimize lift-off the surface, together with methods to dig deeper into the\nasteroid surface. Our studies combine analytical models, with simulation and\nhardware testing. For initial evaluation of material-spacecraft dynamics and\nmechanics, we assume lunar-like regolith for bulk density, particle size and\ncohesion. Our early studies point towards a promising pathway towards\nrefinement of this technology for demonstration aboard a future space mission.\n", "  Comparative assessment of the total breakup proton-emission cross sections\nmeasured for 56 MeV deuteron interaction with target nuclei from $^{12}$C to\n$^{209}$Bi, with an empirical parametrization and recently calculated\nmicroscopic neutron-removal cross sections has been done at the same time with\nsimilar data measured at 15, 25.5, 70, and 80 MeV. Comparable mass dependances\nof the elastic-breakup (EB) cross sections provided by the empirical\nparametrization and the microscopic results have been also found at the\ndeuteron energy of 56 MeV, while the assessment of absolute-values variance up\nto a factor of two has been not possible due to the lack of EB measurements at\nenergies higher than 25.5 MeV. While the similarities represent an additional\nvalidation of the microscopic calculations, the cross-section difference should\nbe considered within the objectives of further measurements.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the symmetry energy for isotopic chains of\neven-even Ni, Sn, and Pb nuclei is investigated in the framework of the local\ndensity approximation (LDA). The Skyrme energy density functional with two\nSkyrme-class effective interactions, SkM* and SLy4, is used in the\ncalculations. The temperature-dependent proton and neutron densities are\ncalculated through the HFBTHO code that solves the nuclear\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov problem by using the cylindrical transformed\ndeformed harmonic-oscillator basis. In addition, two other density\ndistributions of $^{208}$Pb, namely the Fermi-type density determined within\nthe extended Thomas-Fermi (TF) method and symmetrized-Fermi local density\nobtained within the rigorous density functional approach, are used. The kinetic\nenergy densities are calculated either by the HFBTHO code or, for a comparison,\nby the extended TF method up to second order in temperature (with $T^{2}$\nterm). Alternative ways to calculate the symmetry energy coefficient within the\nLDA are proposed. The results for the thermal evolution of the symmetry energy\ncoefficient in the interval $T=0-4$ MeV show that its values decrease with\ntemperature. The temperature dependence of the neutron and proton\nroot-mean-square radii and corresponding neutron skin thickness is also\ninvestigated, showing that the effect of temperature leads mainly to a\nsubstantial increase of the neutron radii and skins, especially in the more\nneutron-rich nuclei, a feature that may have consequences on astrophysical\nprocesses and neutron stars.\n", "  A cluster-transfer experiment\n$^9$Be($^9$Be,$^{14}$C$^*\\rightarrow\\alpha$+$^{10}$Be)$\\alpha$ was carried out\nusing an incident beam energy of 45 MeV. This reaction channel has a large\n$Q$-value that favors populating the high-lying states in $^{14}$C and\nseparating various reaction channels. A number of resonant states are\nreconstructed from the forward emitting $^{10}$Be + $\\alpha$ fragments with\nrespect to three sets of well discriminated final states in $^{10}$Be, most of\nwhich agree with the previous observations. A state at 22.5(1) MeV in $^{14}$C\nis found to decay predominantly into the states around 6 MeV in $^{10}$Be\ndaughter nucleus, in line with the unique property of the predicted band head\nof the $\\sigma$-bond linear-chain molecular states. A new state at 23.5(1) MeV\nis identified which decays strongly into the first excited state of $^{10}$Be.\n", "  The idea that dark matter can be made of intermediate-mass primordial black\nholes in the $10M_\\odot \\lesssim M \\lesssim 200M_\\odot$ range has recently been\nreconsidered, particularly in the light of the detection of gravitational waves\nby the LIGO experiment. The existence of even a small fraction of dark matter\nin black holes should nevertheless result in noticeable quasar gravitational\nmicrolensing. Quasar microlensing is sensitive to any type of compact objects\nin the lens galaxy, to their abundance, and to their mass. We have analyzed\noptical and X-ray microlensing data from 24 gravitationally lensed quasars to\nestimate the abundance of compact objects in a very wide range of masses. We\nconclude that the fraction of mass in black holes or any type of compact\nobjects is negligible outside of the $0.05 M_\\odot \\lesssim M \\lesssim 0.45\nM_\\odot$ mass range and that it amounts to $20 \\pm5$% of the total matter, in\nagreement with the expected masses and abundances of the stellar component.\nConsequently, the existence of a significant population of intermediate-mass\nprimordial black holes appears to be inconsistent with current microlensing\nobservations. Therefore, primordial massive black holes are a very unlikely\nsource of the gravitational radiation detected by LIGO.\n", "  Photospheric waves in sunspots moving radially outwards at speeds faster than\nthe characteristic wave velocities have been recently detected. It has been\nsuggested that they are the visual pattern of $p-$modes excited around 5 Mm\nbeneath the sunspot. Using numerical simulations, we have performed a\nparametric study of the waves observed at the photosphere and higher layers\nproduced by sources located at different depths. The observational measurements\nare consistent with waves driven between approximately 1 Mm and 5 Mm below the\nsunspot surface.\n", "  We use the lensing potential map from Planck CMB lensing reconstruction\nanalysis and the \"Public Cosmic Void Catalog\" to measure the stacked void\nlensing potential. In this profile, four parameters are needed to describe the\nshape of voids with different characteristic radii $R_V$. However, we have\nfound that after reducing the background noise by subtracting the average\nbackground, there is a residue lensing power left in the data. The inclusion of\nthe environment shifting parameter, $\\gamma_V$, is necessary to get a better\nfit to the data with the residue lensing power. We divide the voids into two\nredshift bins: cmass1 ($0.45 < z < 0.5$) and cmass2 ($0.5 < z < 0.6$). Our\nbest-fit parameters are $\\alpha = 1.989\\pm0.149$, $\\beta = 12.61\\pm0.56$,\n$\\delta_c=-0.697\\pm0.025$, $R_S/R_V=1.039\\pm0.030$, $\\gamma_v=(-7.034\\pm0.150)\n\\times 10^{-2}$ for the cmass1 sample with 123 voids and $\\alpha =\n1.956\\pm0.165$, $\\beta = 12.91\\pm0.60$, $\\delta_c=-0.673\\pm0.027$,\n$R_S/R_V=1.115\\pm0.032$, $\\gamma_v=(-4.512\\pm0.114) \\times 10^{-2}$ for the\ncmass2 sample with 393 voids at 68% C.L. The addition of the environment\nparameter is consistent with the conjecture that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nvoids reside in an underdense region.\n", "  The WASP-18 system, with its massive and extremely close-in planet, WASP-18b\n(M$_{p}$ = 10.3M$_{J}$, a = 0.02 AU, P = 22.6 hours), is one of the best known\nexoplanet laboratories to directly measure Q', the modified tidal quality\nfactor and proxy for efficiency of tidal dissipation, of the host star.\nPrevious analysis predicted a rapid orbital decay of the planet toward its host\nstar that should be measurable on the time scale of a few years, if the star is\nas dissipative as is inferred from the circularization of close-in solar-type\nbinary stars. We have compiled published transit and secondary eclipse timing\n(as observed by WASP, TRAPPIST, and Spitzer) with more recent unpublished light\ncurves (as observed by TRAPPIST and HST) with coverage spanning nine years. We\nfind no signature of a rapid decay. We conclude that the absence of rapid\norbital decay most likely derives from Q' being larger than was inferred from\nsolar-type stars, and find that Q' $\\geq $1$\\times10^{6}$, at 95\\,\\%\nconfidence; this supports previous work suggesting that F-stars, with their\nconvective cores and thin convective envelopes, are significantly less tidally\ndissipative than solar-type stars, with radiative cores and large convective\nenvelopes.\n", "  Solar filaments/prominences are one of the most common features in the\ncorona, which may lead to energetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares\nwhen they erupt. Filaments are about one hundred times cooler and denser than\nthe coronal material, and physical understanding of their material origin\nremains controversial. Two types of scenarios have been proposed: one argues\nthat the filament plasma is brought into the corona from photosphere or\nchromosphere through a siphon or evaporation/injection process, while the other\nsuggests that the material condenses from the surrounding coronal plasma due to\nthermal instability. The elemental abundance analysis is a reasonable clue to\nconstrain the models, as the siphon or evaporation/injection model would\npredict that the filament material abundances are close to the photospheric or\nchromospheric ones, while the condensation model should have coronal\nabundances. In this letter, we analyze the elemental abundances of a magnetic\ncloud that contains the ejected filament material. The corresponding filament\neruption occurred on 1998 April 29, accompanying an M6.8 class soft X-ray flare\nlocated at the heliographic coordinates S18E20 (NOAA 08210) and a fast halo CME\nwith the linear velocity of 1374 km s$^{-1}$ near the Sun. We find that the\nabundance ratios of elements with low and high First Ionization Potential such\nas Fe/O, Mg/O, and Si/O are 0.150, 0.050, and 0.070, respectively, approaching\ntheir corresponding photospheric values 0.065, 0.081, and 0.066, which does not\nsupport the coronal origin of the filament plasma.\n", "  Isolated magnetic white dwarfs have field strengths ranging from kilogauss to\ngigagauss. However, the origin of the magnetic field has not been hitherto\nelucidated. Whether these fields are fossil, hence the remnants of original\nweak magnetic fields amplified during the course of the evolution of their\nprogenitor stars, or are the result of binary interactions or, finally, they\nare produced by other internal physical mechanisms during the cooling of the\nwhite dwarf itself, remains a mystery. At sufficiently low temperatures white\ndwarfs crystallize. Upon solidification, phase separation of its main\nconstituents, 12C and 16O, and of the impurities left by previous evolution\noccurs. This process leads to the formation of a Rayleigh-Taylor unstable\nliquid mantle on top of a solid core. This convective region, as it occurs in\nSolar System planets like the Earth and Jupiter, can produce a dynamo able to\nyield magnetic fields of strengths of up to 0.1 MG, thus providing a mechanism\nthat could explain magnetism in single white dwarfs.\n", "  We carried out 2.5-dimensional resistive MHD simulations to study the\nformation mechanism of molecular loops observed by Fukui et al. (2006) at\nGalactic central region. Since it is hard to form molecular loops by uplifting\ndense molecular gas, we study the formation mechanism of molecular gas in\nrising magnetic arcades. This model is based on the in-situ formation model of\nsolar prominences, in which prominences are formed by cooling instability in\nhelical magnetic flux ropes formed by imposing converging and shearing motion\nat footpoints of the magnetic arch anchored to the solar surface. We extended\nthis model to Galactic center scale (a few hundreds pc). Numerical results\nindicate that magnetic reconnection taking place in the current sheet formed\ninside the rising magnetic arcade creates dense blobs confined by the rising\nhelical magnetic flux ropes. Thermal instability taking place in the flux ropes\nforms dense molecular filaments floating at high Galactic latitude. The mass of\nthe filament increases with time, and can exceed 10^5 solar mass.\n", "  We present a new nearby young moving group (NYMG) kinematic membership\nanalysis code, LocAting Constituent mEmbers In Nearby Groups (LACEwING), a new\nCatalog of Suspected Nearby Young Stars, a new list of bona fide members of\nmoving groups, and a kinematic traceback code. LACEwING is a convergence-style\nalgorithm with carefully vetted membership statistics based on a large\nnumerical simulation of the Solar Neighborhood. Given spatial and kinematic\ninformation on stars, LACEwING calculates membership probabilities in 13 NYMGs\nand three open clusters within 100 pc. In addition to describing the inputs,\nmethods, and products of the code, we provide comparisons of LACEwING to other\npopular kinematic moving group membership identification codes. As a proof of\nconcept, we use LACEwING to reconsider the membership of 930 stellar systems in\nthe Solar Neighborhood (within 100 pc) that have reported measurable lithium\nequivalent widths. We quantify the evidence in support of a population of young\nstars not attached to any NYMGs, which is a possible sign of new\nas-yet-undiscovered groups or of a field population of young stars.\n", "  Eclipsing binaries provide a unique opportunity to determine fundamental\nstellar properties. In the era of wide-field cameras and all-sky imaging\nsurveys, thousands of eclipsing binaries have been reported through light curve\nclassification, yet their basic properties remain unexplored due to the\nextensive efforts needed to follow them up spectroscopically. In this paper we\ninvestigate three M2-M3 type double-lined eclipsing binaries discovered by\ncross-matching eclipsing binaries from the Catalina Sky Survey wtih\nspectroscopically classified M dwarfs from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object\nFiber Spectroscopic Telescope survey data release one and two. Because these\nthree M dwarf binaries are faint, we further acquire radial velocity\nmeasurements using GMOS on the Gemini North telescope with R~40000, enabling us\nto determine the mass and radius of individual stellar components. By jointly\nfitting the light and radial velocity curves of these systems, we derive the\nmass and radius of the primary and secondary components of these three systems,\nin the range between 0.28-0.42 M_sun and 0.29-0.67 R_sun, respectively. Future\nobservations with a high resolution spectrograph will help us pin down the\nuncertainties in their stellar parameters, and render these systems benchmarks\nto study m dwarfs, providing inputs to improving stellar models in the low mass\nregime, or establishing an empirical mass-radius relation for M dwarf stars.\n", "  Electric-field control of magnetism without electric currents potentially\nrevolutionizes spintronics towards ultralow power. Here by using mechanically\ncoupled phase field simulations, we computationally demonstrate the application\nof the strain-mediated magnetoelectric effect for the electric-field control of\nmagnetic states in heterostructure. In the model heterostructure constituted of\nthe soft nanomagnet Co and the piezoelectric substrate PMN-PT, both the\nvolatility of magnetic states and the magnetization switching dynamics excited\nby the electric field are explored. It is found that an electric field can\ndrive the single-domain nanomagnet into an equilibrium vortex state. The\nnanomagnet remains in the vortex state even after removing the electric field\nor applying a reverse electric field, i.e. the vortex state is extremely stable\nand nonvolatile. Only by utilizing the precessional magnetization dynamics, the\n180$^\\circ$ magnetization switching is possible in small-sized nanomagnets\nwhich are free of the stable vortex state. Electric-field pulses can realize\nthe deterministic 180$^\\circ$ switching if the electric-field magnitude, pulse\nwidth, and ramp time are carefully designed. The minimum switching time is\nfound to be less than 10 ns. These results provide useful information for the\ndesign of low-power, reliable, and fast electric-field-controlled spintronics.\n", "  We present a multi-wavelength timing study of the eclipsing low mass X-ray\nbinary EXO 0748-676 (UY Vol) using XMM-Newton when the source was in a hard\nspectral state. The orbital optical and X-ray light curves show a fairly large\namount of intensity modulation in the 7 observations taken during\nSeptember-November, 2003, covering 36 complete binary orbits of EXO 0748-676.\nWhile assessing the non-burst variability, simultaneously in the optical and\nX-ray light curves, we find that they are not correlated at reprocessing or\norbital time-scales, but are weakly correlated at a few 1000s of seconds\ntime-scales. Although a large fraction of the optical emission is likely to be\ndue to reprocessing, the lack of significant correlation and presence of large\nvariability in the orbital X-ray and optical light curves is probably due to\nstructures and structural changes in the accretion disk that produce, and\nsometimes mask the reprocessed signal in varying amounts. These disk structures\ncould be induced, at least partly, by irradiation. From the observed\nmodulations seen in the optical light curves, there is strong evidence of\naccretion disk evolution at time scales of a few hours.\n", "  The performance of adaptive optics systems is partially dependant on the\nalgorithms used within the real-time control system to compute wavefront slope\nmeasurements. We demonstrate use of a matched filter algorithm for the\nprocessing of elongated laser guide star (LGS) Shack-Hartmann images, using the\nCANARY adaptive optics instrument on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope and\nthe European Southern Observatory Wendelstein LGS Unit placed 40m away. This\nalgorithm has been selected for use with the forthcoming Thirty Meter\nTelescope, but until now had not been demonstrated on-sky. From the results of\na first observing run, we show that the use of matched filtering improves our\nadaptive optics system performance, with increases in on-sky H-band Strehl\nmeasured up to about a factor of 1.1 with respect to a conventional centre of\ngravity approach. We describe the algorithm used, and the methods that we\nimplemented to enable on-sky demonstration.\n", "  The density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) method and the Hartree-Fock\n(HF) approximation with the charge-density-wave (CDW) instability are used to\nstudy a formation and condensation of excitonic bound states in the generalized\nFalicov-Kimball model. In particular, we examine effects of various factors,\nlike the $f$-electron hopping, the local and nonlocal hybridization, as well as\nthe increasing dimension of the system on the excitonic momentum distribution\n$N(q)$ and especially on the number of zero momentum excitons $N_0=N(q=0)$ in\nthe condensate. It is found that the negative values of the $f$-electron\nhopping integrals $t_f$ support the formation of zero-momentum condensate,\nwhile the positive values of $t_f$ have the fully opposite effect. The opposite\neffects on the formation of condensate exhibit also the local and nonlocal\nhybridization. The first one strongly supports the formation of condensate,\nwhile the second one destroys it completely. Moreover, it was shown that the\nzero-momentum condensate remains robust with increasing dimension of the\nsystem.\n", "  The effects of mixedness and entanglement on the lower bound and tightness of\nthe entropic uncertainty in the Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction have been investigated. It is found that the mixedness can reflect\nthe essence of the entropic uncertainty better than the entanglement.\nMeanwhile, the uncertainty of measurement results will be reduced by the\nentanglement and improved by the mixedness.The entanglement can destroy the\ntightness of the uncertainty, while the tightness will be improved with the\nincreasing of the mixedness. In addition, the tightness of the uncertainty in\nHeisenberg model can be expressed as a function of the magnetic properties, the\nstrength of the DM interaction as well as the mixedness of the state and the\nfunctional form has no relationship with temperature. What's more, the entropic\nuncertain inequality becomes uncertain equality when the mixedness of the\nsystem reach the minimum value.For a given mixedness, the tightness will be\nreduced with the increasing of the strength of DM interaction at the\nantiferromagnetic case while the situation is just the opposite for the\nferromagnetic case.\n", "  The field of exoplanet research is moving towards the detection and\ncharacterization of habitable planets. These exo-Earths can be easily found\naround low-mass stars by using either photometric transit or radial-velocity\n(RV) techniques. In the latter case the gain is twofold because the signal\ninduced by the planet of a given mass is higher due to the more favourable\nplanet-star mass ratio and because the habitable zone lies closer to the star.\nHowever, late-type stars emit mainly in the infrared (IR) wavelength range,\nwhich calls for IR instruments. SPIRou is a stable RV IR spectrograph\naddressing these ambitious scientific objectives. As with any other\nspectrograph, calibration and drift monitoring is fundamental to achieve high\nprecision. Our goal was to build, test and finally operate a\nFabry-P\\'erot-based RV-reference module able to provide the needed spectral\ninformation over the full wavelength range of SPIRou. We adapted the existing\nHARPS Fabry-P\\'erot calibrator for operation in the IR domain. After\nmanufacturing and assembly, we characterized the FP RV-module in the\nlaboratory. We measured finesse, transmittance, and spectral flux of the\nsystem. The measured finesse value of F=12.8 corresponds perfectly to the\ntheoretical value. The total transmittance at peak is of the order of 0.5%,\nmainly limited by fibre-connectors and interfaces. Nevertheless, the provided\nflux is in line with the the requirements set by the SPIRou instrument. Once\ninstalled on SPIRou, we will test the full spectral characteristics and\nstability of the RV-reference module. The goal will be to prove that the line\nposition and shape stability of all lines is better than 0.3 m s$^{-1}$ between\ntwo calibration sequences (typically 24 hours), such that the RV-reference\nmodule can be used to monitor instrumental drifts.\n", "  Color flux tubes (quark-gluon strings), formed at early stages of\nhadron-hadron collisions, may overlap in case of sufficiently high densities\nand interact, producing long-range azimuthal correlations. In the hypothesis of\nrepulsive interaction, each string may acquire, before the hadronization, the\nadditional transverse boost, which is an efficient sum of all accounted\nstring-string interactions. This modifies transverse momenta to the particles\nformed in string decay, leading to modification of event-wise observables, like\nazimuthal asymmetry of two-particle correlations, over a wide range of\nrapidity.\n  In this article we discuss results of Monte Carlo model with string\nrepulsion, where efficient string-string interaction radius is introduced. We\nshow that the effect of string repulsion can be the main dynamic origin of the\nelliptic flow and of the higher harmonics, which are reflected in the\ncomplicated structures observed in two-particle long-range correlation topology\nin nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC and at LHC.\n", "  We present a model that takes into account the coupling between evolutionary\ngame dynamics and social influence. Importantly, social influence and game\ndynamics take place in different domains, which we model as different layers of\na multiplex network. We show that the coupling between these dynamical\nprocesses can lead to cooperation in scenarios where the pure game dynamics\npredicts defection. In addition, we show that the structure of the network\nlayers and the relation between them can further increase cooperation.\nRemarkably, if the layers are related in a certain way, the system can reach a\npolarized metastable state.These findings could explain the prevalence of\npolarization observed in many social dilemmas.\n", "  Many debris discs reveal a two-component structure, with a cold outer and a\nwarm inner component. While the former are likely massive analogues of the\nKuiper belt, the origin of the latter is still a matter of debate. In this work\nwe investigate whether the warm dust may be a signature of asteroid belt\nanalogues. In the scenario tested here the current two-belt architecture stems\nfrom an originally extended protoplanetary disc, in which planets have opened a\ngap separating it into the outer and inner discs which, after the gas\ndispersal, experience a steady-state collisional decay. This idea is explored\nwith an analytic collisional evolution model for a sample of 225 debris discs\nfrom a Spitzer/IRS catalogue that are likely to possess a two-component\nstructure. We find that the vast majority of systems (220 out of 225, or 98%)\nare compatible with this scenario. For their progenitors, original\nprotoplanetary discs, we find an average surface density slope of\n$-0.93\\pm0.06$ and an average initial mass of\n$\\left(3.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\\right)\\times 10^{-3}$ solar masses, both of which are\nin agreement with the values inferred from submillimetre surveys. However, dust\nproduction by short-period comets and - more rarely - inward transport from the\nouter belts may be viable, and not mutually excluding, alternatives to the\nasteroid belt scenario. The remaining five discs (2% of the sample: HIP 11486,\nHIP 23497, HIP 57971, HIP 85790, HIP 89770) harbour inner components that\nappear inconsistent with dust production in an \"asteroid belt.\" Warm dust in\nthese systems must either be replenished from cometary sources or represent an\naftermath of a recent rare event, such as a major collision or planetary system\ninstability.\n", "  Increasing the distance from which an antineutrino detector is capable of\nmonitoring the operation of a registered reactor, or discovering a clandestine\nreactor, strengthens the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty. This\npaper presents calculations of reactor antineutrino interactions from\nquasi-elastic neutrino-proton scattering and elastic neutrino-electron\nscattering in a water-based detector operated $\\gtrsim10$ km from a commercial\npower reactor. It separately calculates signal from the proximal reactor and\nbackground from all other registered reactors. The main results are\ndifferential and integral interaction rates from the quasi-elastic and elastic\nprocesses. There are two underground facilities capable of hosting a detector\n($\\sim1$ kT H$_2$O) project nearby ($L\\sim20$ km) an operating commercial\nreactor ($P_{th}\\sim3$ GW). These reactor-site combinations, which are under\nconsideration for project WATCHMAN, are Perry-Morton on the southern shore of\nLake Erie in the United States and Hartlepool-Boulby on the western shore of\nthe North Sea in England. The signal rate from the proximal reactor is about\nfive times greater at the Morton site than at the Boulby site due to shorter\nreactor-site separation distance, larger reactor thermal power, and greater\nneutrino oscillation survival probability. Although the background rate from\nall other reactors is larger at Morton than at Boulby, it is a smaller fraction\nof the signal rate from the proximal reactor at Morton than at Boulby.\nMoreover, the Hartlepool power plant has two cores whereas the Perry plant has\na single core. The Boulby site, therefore, offers an opportunity for remotely\nmonitoring the on/off cycle of a reactor core under more stringent conditions\nthan does the Morton site.\n", "  We describe a light-weight system of bash scripts for efficiently bundling\nsupercomputing tasks into large jobs, so that one can take advantage of\nincentives or discounts for requesting large allocations. The software can\nbackfill computational tasks, avoiding wasted cycles, and can streamline\ncollaboration between different users. It is simple to use, functioning\nsimilarly to batch systems like PBS, MOAB, and SLURM.\n", "  In this paper, we prove a sharp limit on the community detection problem with\ncolored edges. We assume two equal-sized communities and there are $m$\ndifferent types of edges. If two vertices are in the same community, the\ndistribution of edges follows $p_i=\\alpha_i\\log{n}/n$ for $1\\leq i \\leq m$,\notherwise the distribution of edges is $q_i=\\beta_i\\log{n}/n$ for $1\\leq i \\leq\nm$, where $\\alpha_i$ and $\\beta_i$ are positive constants and $n$ is the total\nnumber of vertices. Under these assumptions, a fundamental limit on community\ndetection is characterized using the Hellinger distance between the two\ndistributions. If $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(\\sqrt{\\alpha_i} - \\sqrt{\\beta_i})}^2 >2$,\nthen the community detection via maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is possible\nwith high probability. If $\\sum_{i=1}^m {(\\sqrt{\\alpha_i} - \\sqrt{\\beta_i})}^2\n< 2$, the probability that the ML estimator fails to detect the communities\ndoes not go to zero.\n", "  Computing meaningful clusters of nodes is crucial to analyse large networks.\nIn this paper, we apply new clustering methods to improve the computational\ntime. We use the properties of the adjacency matrix to obtain better role\nextraction. We also define a new non-recursive similarity measure and compare\nits results with the ones obtained with Browet's similarity measure. We will\nshow the extraction of the different roles with a linear time complexity.\nFinally, we test our algorithm with real data structures and analyse the limit\nof our algorithm.\n", "  We consider the population of critical points generated from the critical\npoint of the master function with no variables, which is associated with the\ntrivial representation of the twisted affine Lie algebra $A^{(2)}_{2n}$. The\npopulation is naturally partitioned into an infinite collection of complex\ncells $\\mathbb{C}^m$, where $m$ are some positive integers. For each cell we\ndefine an injective rational map $\\mathbb{C}^m \\to M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ of the cell\nto the space $M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ of Miura opers of type $A^{(2)}_{2n}$. We show\nthat the image of the map is invariant with respect to all mKdV flows on\n$M(A^{(2)}_{2n})$ and the image is point-wise fixed by all mKdV flows\n$\\frac\\partial{\\partial t_r}$ with index $r$ greater than $4m$.\n", "  In the present work, a theoretical study of electron-phonon (electron-ion)\ncoupling rates in semiconductors driven out of equilibrium is performed.\nTransient change of optical coefficients reflects the band gap shrinkage in\ncovalently bonded materials, and thus, the heating of atomic lattice. Utilizing\nthis dependence, we test various models of electron-ion coupling. The\nsimulation technique is based on tight-binding molecular dynamics. Our\nsimulations with the dedicated hybrid approach (XTANT) indicate that the widely\nused Fermi's golden rule can break down describing material excitation on\nfemtosecond time scales. In contrast, dynamical coupling proposed in this work\nyields a reasonably good agreement of simulation results with available\nexperimental data.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Schr\\\"odinger equation with a new quasi-exactly\nsolvable double-well potential. Exact expressions for the energies, the\ncorresponding wave functions and the allowed values of the potential parameters\nare obtained using two different methods, the Bethe ansatz method and the Lie\nalgebraic approach. Some numerical results are reported and it is shown that\nthe results are in good agreement with each other and with those obtained\npreviously via a different method.\n", "  This paper investigates cells proliferation dynamics in small tumor cell\naggregates using an individual based model (IBM). The simulation model is\ndesigned to study the morphology of the cell population and of the cell\nlineages as well as the impact of the orientation of the division plane on this\nmorphology. Our IBM model is based on the hypothesis that cells are\nincompressible objects that grow in size and divide once a threshold size is\nreached, and that newly born cell adhere to the existing cell cluster. We\nperformed comparisons between the simulation model and experimental data by\nusing several statistical indicators. The results suggest that the emergence of\nparticular morphologies can be explained by simple mechanical interactions.\n", "  A programmable micromechanical resonator based on a VO2 thin film is\nreported. Multiple mechanical eigenfrequency states are programmed using Joule\nheating as local power source, gradually driving the phase transition of VO2\naround its Metal-Insulator transition temperature. Phase coexistence of domains\nis used to tune the stiffness of the device via local control of internal\nstresses and mechanical properties. This study opens perspectives for\ndeveloping mechanically configurable nanostructure arrays.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of implementing a previously proposed\ndistributed direct coupling quantum observer for a closed linear quantum\nsystem. By modifying the form of the previously proposed observer, the paper\nproposes a possible experimental implementation of the observer plant system\nusing a non-degenerate parametric amplifier and a chain of optical cavities\nwhich are coupled together via optical interconnections. It is shown that the\ndistributed observer converges to a consensus in a time averaged sense in which\nan output of each element of the observer estimates the specified output of the\nquantum plant.\n", "  We have investigated mixed-gap vector solitons involving incoherently coupled\nfundamental and dipole components in a parity-time (PT) symmetric lattice with\nsaturable nonlinearity. For the focusing case, vector solitons emerge from the\nsemi-infinite and the first finite gaps, while for the defocusing case, vector\nsolitons emerge from the first finite and the second finite gaps. For both\ncases, we find that stronger saturable nonlinearity is relative to sharper\nincrease/decrease of soliton power with propagation constant and to narrower\nexistence domain of vector solitons. This finding is helpful for realizing\nhigh-power solitons with limited range of propagation constant. Additionally,\nour numerical calculations show that increasing the weight of dipole component\nresults in destabilization of vector solitons, while stronger saturable\nnonlinearity to certain extent suppresses the instability of vector solitons.\n", "  The strangeness $S=-2$ baryon-baryon interaction is investigated directly\nfrom the fundamental theory of the strong interaction, QCD. The HAL QCD method\nenables us to extract baryon interactions from the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter wave\nfunctions without using any experimental information. We present our latest\nresult on the $S = -2$ baryon interactions and discuss the H-dibaryon state\nusing potentials which are calculated by using the (almost) physical point\ngauge configurations with large lattice volume of$(8.1{\\rm{fm}})^4$ generated\non the K-computer.\n", "  With progress in quantum technology more sophisticated quantum annealing\ndevices are becoming available. While they offer new possibilities for solving\noptimization problems, their true potential is still an open question. As the\noptimal design of adiabatic algorithms plays an important role in their\nassessment, we illustrate the aspects and challenges to consider when\nimplementing optimization problems on quantum annealing hardware based on the\nexample of the traveling salesman problem (TSP). We demonstrate that tunneling\nbetween local minima can be exponentially suppressed if the quantum dynamics\nare not carefully tailored to the problem. Furthermore we show that inequality\nconstraints, in particular, present a major hurdle for the implementation on\nanalog quantum annealers. We finally argue that programmable digital quantum\nannealers can overcome many of these obstacles and can - once large enough\nquantum computers exist - provide an interesting route to using quantum\nannealing on a large class of problems.\n", "  The most general structure (in matrix form) of a single-qubit gate is\npresented. Subsequently, used that to obtain a set of conditions for testing\n(a) whether a given 2-qubit gate is genuinely a 2-qubit gate, i.e., not\ndecomposable into two single qubit gates and (b) whether a given single qubit\ngate is self-inverse? Relevance of the results reported here is discussed in\nthe context of optimization of reversible and quantum circuits, especially for\nthe optimization of quantum cost. A systematic procedure is developed for the\nidentification of the non-decomposable 2-qubit gates. Such a non-decomposable\n2-qubit gate along with all possible single qubit gates form a universal\nquantum gate library. Further, some possible applications of the present work\nare also discussed.\n", "  At COMPASS DVCS and DVMP processes are studied in order to probe the partonic\nstructure of the nucleon by constraining GPD models. Extending beyond\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, the measurement of lepton-induced\nexclusive reactions enables the study of GPDs, which ultimately reveal the\nthree dimensional picture of the nucleon and the decomposition of its total\nangular momentum. Exploiting the flavour filtering character of DVMP\nmeasurements, the COMPASS experiment is able to access different combinations\nof quark and gluon GPDs by determining the cross sections for various mesons.\nWe report on the first extraction of the exclusive ${\\pi}^0$ muoproduction\ncross section in the intermediate $x_{Bj}$ domain ranging from 0.01 to 0.15.\n", "  Obtaining strong magnetoelectric couplings in bulk materials and\nheterostructures is an ongoing challenge. We demonstrate that manganite\nheterostructures of the form ${\\rm\n(Insulator)/(LaMnO_3)_n/(CaMnO_3)_n/(Insulator)}$ show strong multiferroicity\nin magnetic manganites where ferroelectric polarization is realized by charges\nleaking from ${\\rm LaMnO_3}$ to ${\\rm CaMnO_3}$ due to repulsion. Here, an\neffective nearest-neighbor electron-electron (electron-hole) repulsion\n(attraction) is generated by cooperative electron-phonon interaction. Double\nexchange, when a particle virtually hops to its unoccupied neighboring site and\nback, produces magnetic polarons that polarize antiferromagnetic regions. Thus\na striking giant magnetoelectric effect ensues when an external electrical\nfield enhances the electron leakage across the interface.\n", "  The goal of the first phase of the AWAKE \\cite{AWAKE1,AWAKE2} experiment at\nCERN is to measure the self-modulation \\cite{SMI} of the $\\sigma_z =\n12\\,\\rm{cm}$ long SPS proton bunch into microbunches after traversing\n$10\\,\\rm{m}$ of plasma with a plasma density of\n$n_{pe}=7\\times10^{14}\\,\\rm{electrons/cm}^3$. The two screen measurement setup\n\\cite{Turner2016} is a proton beam diagnostic that can indirectly prove the\nsuccessful development of the self-modulation of the proton beam by imaging\nprotons that got defocused by the transverse plasma wakefields after passing\nthrough the plasma, at two locations downstream the end of the plasma. This\narticle describes the design and realization of the two screen measurement\nsetup integrated in the AWAKE experiment. We discuss the performance and\nbackground response of the system based on measurements performed with an\nunmodulated Gaussian SPS proton bunch during the AWAKE beam commissioning in\nSeptember and October 2016. We show that the system is fully commissioned and\nadapted to eventually image the full profile of a self-modulated SPS proton\nbunch in a single shot measurement during the first phase of the AWAKE\nexperiment.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of magnetic billiards inside a convex domain\nin the plane.\n", "  The key reactions to study the Generalised Parton Distributions are Deeply\nVirtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) and Deeply Virtual Meson Production (DVMP).\nAt COMPASS, these processes are investigated using a high intensity muon beam\nwith a momentum of 160\\,GeV/c and a 2.5\\,m-long liquid hydrogen target. In\norder to optimize the selection of exclusive reactions at these energies, the\ntarget is surrounded by a new barrel-shaped time-of-flight system to detect the\nrecoiling particles. COMPASS-II covers the up to now unexplored $x_{B}$ domain\nranging from 0.01 to 0.15. From the sum of cross sections measured with\npositive and negative beam polarities, the pure DVCS cross-section and its\n$t$-dependence have been extracted resulting in a first model-independent\ndetermination of the transverse size of the partonic distribution of the\nnucleon $\\sqrt{<r_{\\perp}^2>}= (0.578 \\ \\pm \\ 0.042\\ _{- \\ 0.018}^{+ \\\n0.006})\\,\\textsf{fm} $ at a mean $x_{B}$ value of 0.056.\n", "  The photon-ion merged-beams technique for the photoionization of mass/charge\nselected ionized atoms, molecules and clusters by x-rays from synchrotron\nradiation sources is introduced. Examples for photoionization of atomic ions\nare discussed by going from outer-shell ionization of simple few-electron\nsystems to inner-shell ionization of complex many-electron ions. Fundamental\nionization mechanisms are elucidated and the importance of the results for\napplications in astrophysics and plasma physics is pointed out. Finally, the\nunique capabilities of the photon-ion merged-beams technique for the study of\nphotoabsorption by nanoparticles are demonstrated by the example of endohedral\nfullerene ions.\n", "  Photon counts statistics have recently been proven to provide a sensitive\nobservable for characterizing gamma-ray source populations and for measuring\nthe composition of the gamma-ray sky. In this work, we generalize the use of\nthe standard 1-point probability distribution function (1pPDF) to decompose the\nhigh-latitude gamma-ray emission observed with Fermi-LAT into: (i) point-source\ncontributions, (ii) the Galactic foreground contribution, and (iii) a diffuse\nisotropic background contribution. We analyze gamma-ray data in five adjacent\nenergy bands between 1 and 171 GeV. We measure the source-count distribution\ndN/dS as a function of energy, and demonstrate that our results extend current\nmeasurements from source catalogs to the regime of so far undetected sources.\nOur method improves the sensitivity for resolving point-source populations by\nabout one order of magnitude in flux. The dN/dS distribution as a function of\nflux is found to be compatible with a broken power law. We derive upper limits\non further possible breaks as well as the angular power of unresolved sources.\nWe discuss the composition of the gamma-ray sky and capabilities of the 1pPDF\nmethod.\n", "  We include a resummation of large transverse momentum logarithms in the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) Balitsky-Kovchegov equation. The resummed evolution\nequation is shown to be stable, the evolution speed being significantly reduced\nby NLO corrections. The contributions from NLO terms that are not enhanced by\nlarge logarithms are found to be numerically important close to\nphenomenologically relevant initial conditions. We numerically determine the\nvalue for the constant in the resummed logarithm that includes a maximal part\nof the full NLO terms in the resummation.\n", "  Best present experimental achievements in double beta decay are presented.\nPossible progress in this field in the near and far future is discussed.\n", "  In the present work, we investigate the potential of fractional derivatives\nto model atmospheric dispersion of pollutants. We propose simple fractional\ndifferential equation models for the steady state spatial distribution of\nconcentration of a non-reactive pollutant in Planetary Boundary Layer. We solve\nthese models and we compare the solutions with a real experiment. We found that\nthe fractional derivative models perform far better than the traditional\nGaussian model and even better than models found in the literature where it is\nconsidered that the diffusion coefficient is a function of the position in\norder to deal with the anomalous diffusion.\n", "  Based on a solution of the Floquet Hamiltonian we have studied the\ntime-evolution of electronic states in graphene nanoribbons driven out of\nequilibrium by time-dependent electromagnetic fields in different regimes of\nintensity, polarization and frequency. We show that the time-dependent band\nstructure contains many unconventional features that are not captured by\nconsidering the Floquet eigenvalues alone. By analyzing the evolution in time\nof the state population we have identified regimes for the emergence of\ntime-dependent edge states responsible of charge oscillations across the\nribbon.\n", "  Flexible fully transparent diodes with high rectification ratio of 5 e 8 are\nfabricated with all oxide materials at low temperature. The devices are\noptically transparent in visible spectra range and electrically robust while\nmechanically bending. Distinguished from other diodes, these diodes utilize\ndiode-connected thin-film transistor architecture and follow field-effect\nprinciples.\n", "  System of differential equations describing the initial stage of the capture\nof oscillatory systems into the parametric autoresonance is considered. Of\nspecial interest are solutions whose amplitude increases without bound with\ntime. The possibility of capture the system into the autoresonance is related\nwith the stability of such solutions. We study the stability of autoresonant\nsolutions with respect to persistent perturbations of white noise type, and we\nshow that under certain conditions on the intensity of the noise, the capture\ninto parametric autoresonance is preserved with probability tending to one.\n", "  X-ray spectra of accreting pulsars are generally observed to vary with their\nX-ray luminosity. In particular, the hardness of the X-ray continuum is found\nto depend on luminosity. In a few sources, the correlation between the energy\nof the cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and the luminosity is\nclear. Different types (signs) of the correlation are believed to reflect\ndifferent accretion modes. We analyse two NuSTAR observations of the transient\naccreting pulsar Cep X-4 during its 2014 outburst. Our analysis is focused on a\ndetailed investigation of the dependence of the CRSF energy and of the spectral\nhardness on X-ray luminosity, especially on short timescales. To investigate\nthe spectral changes as a function of luminosity within each of the two\nobservations, we used the intrinsic variability of the source on the timescale\nof individual pulse cycles (tens of seconds), the so-called pulse-to-pulse\nvariability. We find that the NuSTAR spectrum of Cep X-4 contains two CRSFs:\nthe fundamental line at ~30 keV and its harmonic at ~55 keV. We find for the\nfirst time that the energy of the fundamental CRSF increases and the continuum\nbecomes harder with increasing X-ray luminosity not only between the two\nobservations, that is, on the long timescale, but also within an individual\nobservation, on the timescale of a few tens of seconds. We investigate these\ndependencies in detail including their non-linearity. We discuss a possible\nphysical interpretation of the observed behaviour in the frame of a simple\none-dimensional model of the polar emitting region with a collisionless shock\nformed in the infalling plasma near the neutron star surface. With this model,\nwe are able to reproduce the observed variations of the continuum hardness\nratio and of the CRSF energy with luminosity.\n", "  Given a network, the statistical ensemble of its graph-Voronoi diagrams with\nrandomly chosen cell centers exhibits properties convertible into information\non the network's large scale structures. We define a node-pair level measure\ncalled {\\it Voronoi cohesion} which describes the probability for sharing the\nsame Voronoi cell, when randomly choosing $g$ centers in the network. This\nmeasure provides information based on the global context (the network in its\nentirety) a type of information that is not carried by other similarity\nmeasures. We explore the mathematical background of this phenomenon and several\nof its potential applications. A special focus is laid on the possibilities and\nlimitations pertaining to the exploitation of the phenomenon for community\ndetection purposes.\n", "  In an effort to increase the versatility of finite element codes, we explore\nthe possibility of automatically creating the Jacobian matrix necessary for the\ngradient-based solution of nonlinear systems of equations. Particularly, we aim\nto assess the feasibility of employing the automatic differentiation tool\nTAPENADE for this purpose on a large Fortran codebase that is the result of\nmany years of continuous development. As a starting point we will describe the\nspecial structure of finite element codes and the implications that this code\ndesign carries for an efficient calculation of the Jacobian matrix. We will\nalso propose a first approach towards improving the efficiency of such a\nmethod. Finally, we will present a functioning method for the automatic\nimplementation of the Jacobian calculation in a finite element software, but\nwill also point out important shortcomings that will have to be addressed in\nthe future.\n", "  This paper studies distributed-parameter systems on Riemannian manifolds with\nrespect to Stokes-Dirac structures in a language of contact geometry with fiber\nbundles. For the class where energy functionals are quadratic, it is shown that\ndistributed-parameter port-Hamiltonian systems with respect to Stokes-Dirac\nstructures on one, two, and three dimensional Riemannian manifolds are written\nin terms of contact Hamiltonian vector fields on bundles. Their fiber spaces\nare contact manifolds and base spaces are Riemannian manifolds. In addition,\nfor a class of distributed-parameter port-Hamiltonian systems, information\ngeometry induced from contact manifolds and convex energy functionals is\nintroduced and briefly discussed.\n", "  In this paper, the structural property of complex plasma and self-diffusion\ncoefficient of dust particles in presence of such wake potential have been\ninvestigated using Langevin dynamics simulation in the subsonic regime of ion\nflow. The study reveals that the self-diffusion of dust grains is strongly\naffected by ion flow and it changes its character in the wake potential\ndominant to the Debye-H\\\"uckel potential dominant regimes. The dependence of\nself-diffusion coefficient on parameters such as neutral pressure, dust size,\nion flow velocity, Coulomb coupling parameter have been calculated for subsonic\nregime using Green-Kubo expression which is based on integrated velocity\nautocorrelation function (VACF).\n", "  Many-body Hilbert space is a functional vector space with the natural\nstructure of an algebra, in which vector multiplication is ordinary\nmultiplication of wave functions. This algebra is finite-dimensional, with\nexactly $N!^{d-1}$ generators for $N$ identical particles, bosons or fermions,\nin $d$ dimensions. The generators are called shapes. Each shape is a possible\nmany-body vacuum. Shapes are natural generalizations of the ground-state Slater\ndeterminant to more than one dimension. Physical states, including the ground\nstate, are superpositions of shapes with symmetric-function coefficients, for\nboth bosons and fermions. These symmetric functions may be interpreted as\nbosonic excitations of the shapes. The algebraic structure of Hilbert space\ndescribed here provides qualitative insights into long-standing issues of\nmany-body physics, including the fermion sign problem and the microscopic\norigin of bands in the spectra of finite systems.\n", "  We devise an approach to the calculation of scaling dimensions of generic\noperators describing scattering within multi-channel Luttinger liquid. The\nlocal impurity scattering in an arbitrary configuration of conducting and\ninsulating channels is investigated and the problem is reduced to a single\nalgebraic matrix equation. In particular, the solution to this equation is\nfound for a finite array of chains described by Luttinger liquid models. It is\nfound that for a weak inter-chain hybridisation and intra-channel\nelectron-electron attraction the edge wires are robust against disorder whereas\nbulk wires, on contrary, become insulating. Thus, the edge state may exist in a\nfinite sliding Luttinger liquid without time-reversal symmetry breaking\n(quantum Hall systems) or spin-orbit interaction (topological insulators).\n", "  We find that the solution of the polar angular differential equation can be\nwritten as the universal associated Legendre polynomials. Its generating\nfunction is applied to obtain an analytical result for a class of interesting\nintegrals involving complicated argument. The present method can in principle\nbe generalizable to the integrals involving other special functions. As an\nillustration we also study a typical Bessel integral with a complicated\nargument.\n", "  Here we propose a linear microbolometric array based on VOx thin films. The\nlinear microbolometric array is fabricated by using micromachining technology,\nand its thermo-sensitive VOx thin film has excellent infrared response spectrum\nand TCR characteristics. Nano-scale VOx thin films deposited on SiO2/Si\nsubstrates were obtained by e-beam vapor deposition. The VOx films were then\nannealed at temperatures between 300 to 500 C with various deposition duration\ntime. The crystal structures and microstructures were examined by XRD, SEM and\nESCA. These films showed a predominant phase of rhombohedral VO2 and the\ncrystallinity of the VO2 increased as the annealing temperature increased.\nIntegrated with CMOS circuit, an experimentally prototypical monolithic linear\nmicrobolometric array is designed and fabricated. The testing results of the\nexperimental linear array show that the responsivity of linear array can\napproach 18KV/W and is potential for infrared image systems.\n", "  We prove a long-standing conjecture by B. Feigin et al. that certain\nscreening operators on a conformal field theory obey the algebra relations of\nthe Borel part of a quantum group (and more generally a diagonal Nichols\nalgebra). Up to now this has been proven only for the quantum group\n$u_q(sl_2)$.\n  The proof is based on a novel, intimate relation between Hopf algebras,\nVertex algebras and a class of analytic functions in several variables, which\nare generalizations of Selberg integrals. These special functions have zeroes\nwherever the associated diagonal Nichols algebra has a relation, because we can\nprove analytically a quantum symmetrizer formula for them. Morevover, we can\nuse the poles of these functions to construct a crucial Weyl group action.\n  Our result produces an infinite-dimensional graded representation of any\nquantum group or Nichols algebra. We discuss applications of this\nrepresentation to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory.\n", "  Motivated by the absence of signals of new physics at the LHC, which seems to\nimply the presence of large mass hierarchies, we investigate the theoretical\npossibility that these could arise dynamically in new strongly-coupled gauge\ntheories extending the standard model of particle physics. To this purpose, we\nstudy lattice data on non-Abelian gauge theories in the (near-)conformal\nregime---specifically, $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ with $N_{\\mathrm{f}}=1$ and $2$\ndynamical fermion flavours in the adjoint representation. We focus our\nattention on the ratio $R$ between the masses of the lightest spin-2 and spin-0\nresonances, and draw comparisons with a simple toy model in the context of\ngauge/gravity dualities. For models in which large anomalous dimensions arise\ndynamically, we show indications that this mass ratio can be large, with $R >\n5$. Moreover, our results suggest that $R$ might be related to universal\nproperties of the IR fixed point. Our findings provide an interesting step\ntowards understanding large mass ratios in the non-perturbative regime of\nquantum field theories with (near) IR conformal behaviour.\n", "  We have presented a compact MOSFET model, which allows us to describe the I-V\ncharacteristics of irradiated long-channel and short-channel transistors in all\noperation modes at different measurement temperatures and interface trap\ndensities. The model allows simulating of the off-state and the on-state drain\ncurrents of irradiated MOSFETs based on an equal footing. Particularly, a novel\ncompact model of the rebound effect in n-MOSFETs was employed for simulation of\nthe total dose dependencies of drain currents in the highly scaled 60 nm node\ncircuits irradiated up to 1Grad. Compatibility of the model parameter set with\nBSIM and a single closed form of the model equation imply the possibility of\nits easy implementation into the standard CAD tools.\n", "  We consider plasmon resonances and cloaking for the elastostatic system in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ via the spectral theory of Neumann-Poincar\\'e operator. We first\nderive the full spectral properties of the Neumann-Poincar\\'e operator for the\n3D elastostatic system in the spherical geometry. The spectral result is of\nsignificant interest for its own sake, and serves as a highly nontrivial\nextension of the corresponding 2D study in [8]. The derivation of the spectral\nresult in 3D involves much more complicated and subtle calculations and\narguments than that for the 2D case. Then we consider a 3D plasmonic structure\nin elastostatics which takes a general core-shell-matrix form with the\nmetamaterial located in the shell. Using the obtained spectral result, we\nprovide an accurate characterisation of the anomalous localised resonance and\ncloaking associated to such a plasmonic structure.\n", "  The universal behavior of a three-boson system close to the unitary limit is\nencoded in a simple dependence of many observables in terms of few parameters.\nFor example the product of the three-body parameter $\\kappa_*$ and the two-body\nscattering length $a$, $\\kappa_* a$ depends on the angle $\\xi$ defined by\n$E_3/E_2=\\tan^2\\xi$. A similar dependence is observed in the ratio $a_{AD}/a$\nwith $a_{AD}$ the boson-dimer scattering length. We use a two-parameter\npotential to determine this simple behavior and, as an application, to compute\n$a_{AD}$ for the case of three $^4$He atoms.\n", "  A Kalman filter based sequential estimator is presented in the present work.\nThe estimator is integrated in the structure of segregated solvers for the\nanalysis of incompressible flows. This technique provides an augmented flow\nstate integrating available observation in the CFD model, naturally preserving\na zero-divergence condition for the velocity field. Because of the prohibitive\ncosts associated with a complete Kalman Filter application, two model reduction\nstrategies have been proposed and assessed. These strategies dramatically\nreduce the increase in computational costs of the model, which can be\nquantified in an increase of $10\\% - 15\\%$ with respect to the classical\nnumerical simulation. In addition, an extended analysis of the behavior of the\nnumerical model covariance $Q$ has been performed. The results have shown that\noptimized values are strongly linked to the truncation error of the\ndiscretization procedure. The estimator has been applied to the analysis of a\nnumber of test cases exhibiting increasing complexity, including turbulent flow\nconfigurations. The results show that the augmented flow successfully improves\nthe prediction of the physical quantities investigated, even when the\nobservation is provided in a limited region of the physical domain. In\naddition, the present work indicates that these Data Assimilation techniques,\nwhich are at an embryonic stage of development in CFD, can be pushed even\nfurther using the augmented prediction as a powerful tool for the optimization\nof the free parameters in the numerical simulation.\n", "  We discuss over the energy resolution we measured for several Helium-3\nproportional tubes. The energy resolution of a Helium-3 detector is strictly\nrelated to the discrimination between gamma-rays and neutrons that can be\nachieved. We also discuss the different contributions to the energy resolution;\nthese provide information about how the helium-3 counters operate.\n  We measured the spatial resolution of position sensitive Helium-3 detectors\nin order to quantify and understand the limit that can be achieved with this\ntechnology.\n  The gamma-ray sensitivity is the efficiency for miscounting a gamma-ray pulse\nas a neutron pulse. This quantity is crucial to determine the performance of\nthe detectors.None of the gamma-ray sensitivity measurements described in the\nliterature involves Helium-3 detectors. We measured the gamma-ray sensitivity\nfor several Helium-3 detectors, providing a useful term of comparison for the\nalternative technologies. We investigated the different contributions that give\nrise to the gamma-ray sensitivity in a detector. In order to better understand\nthese contributions we performed several Monte Carlo simulations.\n  In order to improve the gamma-ray sensitivity, we tested the feasibility of\ngamma-ray pulse rejection via Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD). While proving\nits feasibility, we quantify the magnitude of the gamma-ray rejection in\nHelium-3 tubes. The implementation of the PSD technique on Helium-3 detectors\nwas also investigated in order to set a possible starting point for the PSD\nimplementation on Boron-10 detectors.\n", "  The advantages of high-order finite difference scheme for astrophysical MHD\nand turbulence simulations are highlighted. A number of one-dimensional test\ncases are presented ranging from various shock tests to Parker-type wind\nsolutions. Applications to magnetized accretion discs and their associated\noutflows are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of\ndynamo action in three-dimensional turbulent convection and shear flows, which\nis relevant to stars and astrophysical discs. The generation of large scale\nfields is discussed in terms of an inverse magnetic cascade and the\nconsequences imposed by magnetic helicity conservation are reviewed with\nparticular emphasis on the issue of alpha-quenching.\n", "  The theory of the solar/stellar activity cycles is presented, based on the\nmean-field concept in magnetohydrodynamics. A new approach to the formulation\nof the electromotive force and the theory of differential rotation and\nmeridional circulation is described. Dynamo cycles in the overshoot layer and\ndistributed dynamos are compared, with the latter including the influence of\nmeridional flow. The overshoot layer dynamo reproduces the solar cycle periods\nand the butterfly diagram only if alpha=0 in the convection zone (CZ). The\ndistributed dynamo including meridional flows shows the observed butterfly\ndiagram even with a positive dynamo-alpha in CZ. The nonlinear feedback of\nstrong magnetic fields on differential rotation leads to grand minima in the\ncyclic activity similar to those observed. Our 2D model contains the large- and\nsmall-scale feedback of magnetic fields on diff. rotation and induction in a\nmean-field formulation (Lambda-, alpha-quenching). Grand minima may also occur\nif a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We never found\nany indication that such an on-off dynamo collapses by this effect after being\nexcited. The full quenching of turbulence by strong magnetic fields as reduced\ninduction (alpha) and reduced turbulent diffusivity (eta_T) is studied in 1D.\nWe find a stronger dependence of cycle period on dynamo number compared with a\npure alpha-quenching model giving a very weak cycle period dependence. Also the\ntemporal fluctuations of alpha and eta_T from a random-vortex simulation were\napplied to a dynamo. Then the low `quality' of the solar cycle can be explained\nwith a small number of giant cells as dynamo-active turbulence. The transition\nfrom almost regular magnetic oscillations (many vortices) to a more or less\nchaotic time series (very few vortices) is shown.\n", "  A combined analysis of the profiles of the main broad quasar emission lines\nin both Hubble Space Telescope and optical spectra shows that while the\nprofiles of the strong UV lines are quite similar, there is frequently a strong\nincrease in the Ly-alpha/H-alpha ratio in the high-velocity gas. We show that\nthe suggestion that the high velocity gas is optically-thin presents many\nproblems. We show that the relative strengths of the high velocity wings arise\nnaturally in an optically-thick BLR component. An optically-thick model\nsuccessfully explains the equivalent widths of the lines, the Ly-alpha/H-alpha\nratios and flatter Balmer decrements in the line wings, the strengths of CIII]\nand the lambda 1400 blend, and the strong variability of high-velocity,\nhigh-ionization lines (especially HeII and HeI).\n", "  These notes provide an introduction to the theory of the formation and early\nevolution of planetary systems. Topics covered include the structure, evolution\nand dispersal of protoplanetary disks; the formation of planetesimals,\nterrestrial and gas giant planets; and orbital evolution due to gas disk\nmigration, planetesimal scattering, planet-planet interactions, and tides.\n"]}
