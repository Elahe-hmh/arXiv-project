An exact flux representation of the partition sum\nis used which avoids the complex action problem and based on a generalized worm\nalgorithm we can run Monte Carlo simulations at arbitrary densities. We study\nthermodynamical quantities as a function of the chemical potential mu for zero-\nand finite temperature. It is shown that at zero temperature thermodynamical\nobservables are independent of mu up to a critical value mu_c (Silver Blaze\nphenomenon). In a spectroscopy calculation we cross-check that mu_c agrees with\nthe mass m of the scalar field. The Silver Blaze region ends in a second order\nphase transition and we show that for low temperatures the second order phase\nboundary persists and separates a pseudo Silver Blaze region from a condensed\nphase with strong mu-dependence.\n", "  The finite-size effect on the evolution of Griffiths phase (GP) is studied\nusing nanoparticles of half-doped manganite Pr$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_{3}$ with\ndifferent average particle sizes but having similar structural parameters. All\nthe samples exhibit pronounced GP behavior. With reducing particle size, the\nGriffiths temperature remains almost unchanged but the characteristic critical\ntemperature $T_c^R$ decreases and the GP properties are strengthened. It is\nnoteworthy that the shift of $T_c^R$ follows finite-size scaling with the\nparticle size revealing an exotic interplay between the GP properties and the\nsample dimension. This reinforces an earlier proposal of length-scale related\nevolution of GP.\n", "  We propose a method to construct first integrals of a dynamical system,\nstarting with a given set of independent infinitesimal symmetries. In the case\nof two infinitesimal symmetries, a rank two Poisson structure on the ambient\nspace it is found, such that the vector field that generates the dynamical\nsystem, becomes a Poisson vector field. Moreover, the symplectic leaves and the\nCasimir functions of the associated Poisson manifold are characterized.\nExplicit conditions that guarantee Hamilton-Poisson realizations of the\ndynamical system are also given.\n", "  We produce in an explicit form free generators of the affine W-algebra of\ntype A associated with a nilpotent matrix whose Jordan blocks are of the same\nsize. This includes the principal nilpotent case and we thus recover the\nquantum Miura transformation of Fateev and Lukyanov.\n", "  A multiparametric family of 2D Toda $\\tau$-functions of hypergeometric type\nis shown to provide generating functions for composite, signed Hurwitz numbers\nthat enumerate certain classes of branched coverings of the Riemann sphere and\npaths in the Cayley graph of $S_n$. The coefficients $F^{c_1, ..., c_l}_{d_1,\n..., d_m}(\\mu, \\nu)$ in their series expansion over products $P_\\mu P'_\\nu$ of\npower sum symmetric functions in the two sets of Toda flow parameters and\npowers of the $l+m$ auxiliary parameters are shown to enumerate $|\\mu|=|\\nu|=n$\nfold branched covers of the Riemann sphere with specified ramification profiles\n$ \\mu$ and $\\nu$ at a pair of points, and two sets of additional branch paints,\nsatisfying certain additional conditions on their ramification profile lengths.\nThe first group consists of $l$ branch points, with ramification profile\nlengths fixed to be the numbers $(n-c_1, ..., n- c_l)$; the second consists of\n$m$ further groups of \"coloured\" branch points, of variable number, for which\nthe sums of the complements of the ramification profile lengths within the\ngroups are fixed to equal the numbers $(d_1, ..., d_m)$. The latter are counted\nwith sign determined by the parity of the total number of such branch points.\nThe coefficients $F^{c_1, ..., c_l}_{d_1, ..., d_m}(\\mu, \\nu)$ are also shown\nto enumerate paths in the Cayley graph of the symmetric group $S_n$ generated\nby transpositions, starting, as in the usual double Hurwitz case, at an element\nin the conjugacy class of cycle type $\\mu$ and ending in the class of type\n$\\nu$, but with the first $l$ consecutive subsequences of $(c_1, ..., c_l)$\ntranspositions strictly monotonically increasing, and the subsequent\nsubsequences of $(d_1, ..., d_m)$ transpositions weakly increasing.\n", "  In this MSc. thesis, we have attempted to give an overview of the firewall\nparadox and various approaches towards its resolution. After an introductory\nchapter on some basic concepts in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes\nsuch as Hawking radiation, we introduce the paradox. It arises out of\napplication of principles each of which is thought or assumed to be correct: 1)\nunitary black hole evaporation, 2) validity of quantum field theory in curved\nspacetime, 3) a measure of the number of black hole quantum states, 4)\nEinstein's equivalence principle. Then, we present various approaches that\nexist in the literature towards the resolution of the paradox.\n", "  The Saha equations for photo-ionization process of hydrogen atoms and the\ncreation of electron-positron pairs at high temperature are investigated in a\nreference frame undergoing a uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry or equivalently, in a rest frame in presence of a\nstrong uniform gravitational field. It is known as the Rindler space.\n", "  The nanoscopic isothermal machines are not only energy but also information\ntransducers. We show that the generalized fluctuation theorem with information\ncreation and entropy reduction can be fulfilled for the enzymatic molecular\nmachines with the stochastic dynamics, which offers a choice of the work\nperformance in a variety of ways. A model of such dynamics, specified by a\ncritical complex network, is investigated. The main conclusion of the study is\nthat the processing of free energy has to be distinguished from the processing\nof organization, which we identify with an adequately defined thermodynamic\nvariable. Maxwell's demon utilizes entropy reduction for creation of\ninformation, which, from the former point of view, may be used for a reduction\nof energy losses, hence ultimately, for the performance of work. From the\nlatter point of view, however, it can be used for other purposes, for example\nmolecular recognition. This can be the case of biological molecular machines.\nFrom the biological perspective, the ascertainment is important, that the\ninformation creation and storage take place in the long lasting transient\nstages before completing the free energy transduction cycles. From a broader\nphysical perspective, a supposition could be of special importance, that\ninformation is a change of organization, the thermodynamic function of state of\nthe system.\n", "  We study heat traces associated with positive unbounded operators with\ncompact inverses. With the help of the inverse Mellin transform we derive\nnecessary conditions for the existence of a short time asymptotic expansion.\nThe conditions are formulated in terms of the meromorphic extension of the\nassociated spectral zeta-functions and proven to be verified for a large class\nof operators. We also address the problem of convergence of the obtained\nasymptotic expansions. General results are illustrated with a number of\nexplicit examples.\n", "  This is the 5th article in the collection of reviews \"Exact results on N=2\nsupersymmetric gauge theories\", ed. J. Teschner. We review the supersymmetric\nlocalization of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories on curved backgrounds in four\ndimensions using $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity and generalised conformal Killing\nspinors. We review some known backgrounds and give examples of new geometries\nsuch as local $T^2$-bundle fibrations. We discuss in detail a topological\nfour-sphere with generic $T^2$-invariant metric.\n", "  This is the first in a pair of articles that classify the configuration space\nand kinematic symmetry groups for $N$ identical particles in one-dimensional\ntraps experiencing Galilean-invariant two-body interactions. These symmetries\nexplain degeneracies in the few-body spectrum and demonstrate how tuning the\ntrap shape and the particle interactions can manipulate these degeneracies. The\nadditional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting limit and in the\nunitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are sufficient to\nalgebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of the\none-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the\nalgebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or\nnearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\\ independent of trap shape and\ndetails of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin\nare considered. This article sequentially analyzes the symmetries of one, two\nand three particles in asymmetric, symmetric, and harmonic traps; the sequel\narticle treats the $N$ particle case.\n", "  We present a new program able to perform visual structural analysis on 3D\nparticle systems called PASYVAT (PArticle SYstem Visual Analysis Tool). More\nspecifically, it can select multiple interparticle distance ranges from a\nradial distribution function (RDF) plot and display them in 3D as bonds between\nthe particles falling within the selected distance range, thus generating a\nnetwork of bonds. This software can be used with any data set representing a\nsystem of points or other objects having a welldefined center of mass or\ngeometric center in 3D space. In this article we describe the program and its\ninternal structure, with emphasis on its applicability in the study of certain\nparticle configurations, obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulation\nin condensed matter physics.\n", "  In cosmological scenarios with thermal inflation, extra eras of moduli matter\ndomination, thermal inflation and flaton matter domination exist between\nprimordial inflation and the radiation domination of Big Bang nucleosynthesis.\nDuring these eras, cosmological perturbations on small scales can enter and\nre-exit the horizon, modifying the power spectrum on those scales. The largest\nmodified scale, $k_\\mathrm{b}$, touches the horizon size when the expansion\nchanges from deflation to inflation at the transition from moduli domination to\nthermal inflation. We analytically calculate the evolution of perturbations\nfrom moduli domination through thermal inflation and evaluate the curvature\nperturbation on the constant radiation density hypersurface at the end of\nthermal inflation to determine the late time curvature perturbation. Our\nresulting transfer function suppresses the power spectrum by a factor $\\sim 50$\nat $k \\gg k_\\mathrm{b}$, with $k_\\mathrm{b}$ corresponding to anywhere from\nmegaparsec to subparsec scales depending on the parameters of thermal\ninflation. Thus, thermal inflation might be constrained or detected by small\nscale observations such as CMB distortions or 21cm hydrogen line observations.\n", "  This is the second in a pair of articles that classify the configuration\nspace and kinematic symmetry groups for $N$ identical particles in\none-dimensional traps experiencing Galilean-invariant two-body interactions.\nThese symmetries explain degeneracies in the few-body spectrum and demonstrate\nhow tuning the trap shape and the particle interactions can manipulate these\ndegeneracies. The additional symmetries that emerge in the non-interacting\nlimit and in the unitary limit of an infinitely strong contact interaction are\nsufficient to algebraically solve for the spectrum and degeneracy in terms of\nthe one-particle observables. Symmetry also determines the degree to which the\nalgebraic expressions for energy level shifts by weak interactions or\nnearly-unitary interactions are universal, i.e.\\ independent of trap shape and\ndetails of the interaction. Identical fermions and bosons with and without spin\nare considered. This article analyzes the symmetries of $N$ particles in\nasymmetric, symmetric, and harmonic traps; the prequel article treats the one,\ntwo and three particle cases.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the heavy quark potential in some holographic\nQCD models. The calculation relies on a modified renormalization scheme\nmentioned in a previous work of Albacete et al. After studying the heavy quark\npotential in Pirner-Galow model and Andreev-Zakharov model, we extend the\ndiscussion to a general deformed $AdS_5$ case. It is shown that the obtained\npotential is negative definite for all quark-antiquark separations, differs\nfrom that using the usual renormalization scheme.\n", "  The dynamics of self-gravitating fluids is analyzed within the framework of a\ncollisionless Boltzmann equation in the presence of gravitational fields and\nPoisson equation. Two cases are analyzed: a system with baryonic and dark\nmatter in a static universe and a single system in an expanding universe. The\namplitudes of the perturbed distribution functions are considered as a linear\ncombination of the collision invariants of the Boltzmann equation. For the\nsystem of baryonic and dark matter, the Jeans mass of the combined system is\nsmaller than the one of the single system indicating that a smaller mass is\nneeded to initiate the collapse. For the single system in an expanding universe\nit is not necessary to make use of Jeans \"swindle\"and it shown that for small\nwavelengths the density contrast oscillates while for large wavelengths it\ngrows with time and the Jeans instability emerges.\n", "  This contributed conference proceeding reviews some results about a system of\na few identical particles with spin trapped in one-dimensional potentials and\nexperiencing two-body interactions. The focus is on how symmetry,\nintegrability, and solvability depend on the trap shape, two-body interaction,\nthe number of particles, and the number of spin components. A series of\ncomments are presented that characterize the minimal symmetries possible for a\ncomposite system constructed from interacting single particles, with special\nfocus on the contact interaction. For five and more particles with internal\ncomponents like spin, a kind of universality called algebraically solvability\nis lost.\n", "  This study is focused on the mechanical properties and stress transfer\nbehavior of multiscale composites containing nano- and micro-scale\nreinforcements. The distinctive feature of construction of this composite is\nsuch that the carbon nanostructures (CNS) are dispersed in the matrix around\nthe continuous microscale fiber to modify microfiber-matrix interfacial\nadhesion. Such CNS are considered to be made of aligned CNTs (A-CNTs).\nAccordingly, multiscale models are developed for such hybrid composites. First,\nmolecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Mori-Tanaka method are\nused to determine the effective elastic properties of nano-engineered\ninterphase layer composed of CNS and epoxy. Subsequently, a micromechanical\npull-out model for a continuous fiber multi-scale composite is developed, and\nstress transfer behavior is studied for different orientations of CNS\nconsidering their perfect and imperfect interfacial bonding conditions with the\nsurrounding epoxy. Such interface condition was modeled using the linear spring\nlayer model with a continuous traction but a displacement jump. The current\npull-out model accounts for the radial as well as the axial deformations of\ndifferent orthotropic constituent phases of the multiscale composite. The\nresults from the developed pull-out model are compared with those of the finite\nelement analyses and are found to be in good agreement. Our results reveal that\nthe stress transfer characteristics of the multiscale composite are\nsignificantly improved by controlling the CNT morphology around the fiber,\nparticularly, when they are aligned along the axial direction of the microscale\nfiber. The results also show that the CNS-epoxy interface weakening\nsignificantly influences the radial stress along the length of the microscale\nfiber.\n", "  Particles in rotating saddle potentials exhibit precessional motion which, up\nto now, has been explained by explicit computation. We show that this\nprecession is due to a hidden Coriolis-like force which, unlike the standard\nCoriolis force, is present in the inertial frame. We do so by finding a\nhodograph-like \"guiding center\" transformation using the method of normal form.\n", "  Geometrical frustration and spin-orbit coupling effect together play vital\nrole to influence properties in pyrochlore based iridium oxides. Here we have\ninvestigated detailed structural, magnetic, thermodynamic and transport\nproperties of pyrochlore iridate Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Magnetization data show\nonset of magnetic irreversibility around temperature $T_{irr}$ $\\sim$ 160 K,\nhowever, no sign of long-range type ferromagnetic ordering is observed below\n$T_{irr}$. Specific heat data show no visible anomaly across $T_{irr}$, and the\nanalysis of data indicate sizable density of states across Fermi level.\nTemperature dependent x-ray diffraction measurements show no change in\nstructural symmetry down to low temperature. The material, on the other hand,\nshows significant relaxation and aging behavior similar to glassy dynamics. The\nelectronic charge transport in this highly insulating system is found to follow\npower law dependence with temperature. The material shows negative\nmagnetoresistance which is explained with quantum interference effect.\n", "  We propose a universal formula of dc electrical conductivity in rotational-\nand translational- symmetries breaking systems via the holographic duality.\nThis formula states that the ratio of the determinant of the dc electrical\nconductivities along any spatial directions to the black hole area density in\nzero-charge limit has a universal value. As explicit illustrations, we give\nseveral examples elucidating the validation of this formula: We construct an\nanisotropic black brane solution, which yields linear in temperature for the\nin-plane resistivity and insulating behavior for the out-of-plane resistivity;\nWe also construct a spatially isotropic black brane solution that both the\nlinear-T and quadratic-T contributions to the resistivity can be realized.\n", "  Based on the gravitational redshift, one prediction of Einstein's general\nrelativity theory, of broad optical emission lines in active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), a new method is proposed to estimate the virial factors $f$ in\nmeasuring black hole masses $M_{\\rm{RM}}$ by the reverberation mapping of AGNs.\nThe factors $f$ can be measured on the basis of two physical quantities, i.e.\nthe gravitational redshifts $z_{\\rm{g}}$ and full widths at half maxima\n$v_{\\rm{FWHM}}$ of broad lines. In the past it has been difficult to determine\nthe factors $f$ for individual AGNs. We apply this new method to several\nreverberation mapped Seyfert 1 galaxies. There is a correlation between $f$ and\nbroad-line region (BLR) radius $r_{\\rm{BLR}}$, $f=5.4 r_{\\rm{BLR}}^{0.3}$, for\nthe gravitationally redshifted broad lines He II, He I, H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$\nin narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) Mrk 110. This correlation results from\nthe radiation pressure influence of the accretion disc on the BLR clouds. The\nradiation pressure influence seems to be more important than usually thought in\nAGNs. Mrk 110 has $f \\approx$ 8--16, distinctly larger than the mean $\\langle\nf\\rangle \\approx 1$, usually used to estimate $M_{\\rm{RM}}$ in the case of\n$v_{\\rm{FWHM}}$. NGC 4593 and NLS1 Mrk 486 has $f\\approx 3$ and $f\\approx 9$,\nrespectively. Higher $f$ values of several tens are derived for three other\nNLS1s. There is a correlation between $f$ and accretion rate $\\mathscr{\\dot\nM}_{f=1}$, $f=6.8\\mathscr{\\dot M}^{0.4}_{f=1}$ for five objects, where\n$\\mathscr{\\dot M}_{f=1}=\\dot M_{\\bullet}/L_{\\rm{Edd}}c^{-2}$ as $f=1$ is\nassumed to estimate $M_{\\rm{RM}}$ used in the Eddington luminosity\n$L_{\\rm{Edd}}$, $\\dot M_{\\bullet}$ is the mass accretion rate, and $c$ is the\nspeed of light. These larger $f$ values will produce higher $M_{\\rm{RM}}$\nvalues and lower Eddington ratios.\n", "  Nuclear recoil events produced by neutron scatters form one of the most\nimportant classes of background in WIMP direct detection experiments, as they\nmay produce nuclear recoils that look exactly like WIMP interactions. In\nDarkSide-50, we both actively suppress and measure the rate of neutron-induced\nbackground events using our neutron veto, composed of a boron-loaded liquid\nscintillator detector within a water Cherenkov detector. This paper is devoted\nto the description of the neutron veto system of DarkSide-50, including the\ndetector structure, the fundamentals of event reconstruction and data analysis,\nand basic performance parameters.\n", "  An increasing number of theoretical calculations on few-layer materials have\nbeen reporting a non-zero sound velocity for all three acoustic phonon modes.\nIn contrast with these reports, here we show that the lowest phonon dispersion\nbranch of atomistically described few-layer materials should be quadratic, and\nthis can have dramatic consequencies on calculated properties, such as the\nthermal conductivity. By reformulating the interatomic force constants (IFC) in\nterms of internal coordinates, we find that a delicate balance between the IFCs\nis responsible for this quadraticity. This balance is hard to obtain in\nab-initio calculations even if all the symmetries are numerically enforced a\nposteriori, but it arises naturally in our approach. We demonstrate the\nphenomenon in the case of borophene, where a very subtle correction to the\nab-initio IFCs yields the physically correct quadratic dispersion, while\nleaving the rest of the spectrum virtually unmodified. Such quadraticity\nnevertheless has a major effect on the computed lattice thermal conductivity,\nwhich in the case of borophene changes by more than a factor 2, and reverses\nits anisotropy, when the subtle IFC correction is put in place.\n", "  We investigate the mass content of galaxies in the core of the galaxy cluster\nAbell 611. We perform a strong lensing analysis of the cluster core and use\nvelocity dispersion measurements for individual cluster members as additional\nconstraints. Despite the small number of multiply-imaged systems and cluster\nmembers with central velocity dispersions available in the core of A611, the\naddition of velocity dispersion measurements leads to tighter constraints on\nthe mass associated with the galaxy component, and as a result, on the mass\nassociated with the dark matter halo. Without the spectroscopic velocity\ndispersions, we would overestimate the mass of the galaxy component by a factor\nof $\\sim1.5$, or, equivalently, we would underestimate the mass of the cluster\ndark halo by $\\sim5\\%$. We perform an additional lensing analysis using surface\nbrightness (SB) reconstruction of the tangential giant arc. This approach\nimproves the constraints on the mass parameters of the 5 galaxies close to the\narc by up to a factor $\\sim10$. The galaxy velocity dispersions resulting from\nthe SB analysis are consistent at the 1$\\sigma$ confidence level with the\nspectroscopic measurements and with the prediction from the simple pointlike\nanalysis. In contrast the truncation radii for 2-3 galaxies depart\nsignificantly from the galaxy scaling relation and suggest differences in the\nstripping history from galaxy to galaxy.\n", "  With ever-increasing amounts of online information available, modeling and\npredicting individual preferences-for books or articles, for example-is\nbecoming more and more important. Good predictions enable us to improve advice\nto users, and obtain a better understanding of the socio-psychological\nprocesses that determine those preferences. We have developed a collaborative\nfiltering model, with an associated scalable algorithm, that makes accurate\npredictions of individuals' preferences. Our approach is based on the explicit\nassumption that there are groups of individuals and of items, and that the\npreferences of an individual for an item are determined only by their group\nmemberships. Importantly, we allow each individual and each item to belong\nsimultaneously to mixtures of different groups and, unlike many popular\napproaches, such as matrix factorization, we do not assume implicitly or\nexplicitly that individuals in each group prefer items in a single group of\nitems. The resulting overlapping groups and the predicted preferences can be\ninferred with a expectation-maximization algorithm whose running time scales\nlinearly (per iteration). Our approach enables us to predict individual\npreferences in large datasets, and is considerably more accurate than the\ncurrent algorithms for such large datasets.\n", "  We construct a coordinate-space potential based on pionless effective field\ntheory with a Gaussian regulator. Charge-symmetry breaking is included through\nthe Coulomb potential and through two- and three-body contact interactions.\nStarting with the effective field theory potential, we apply the stochastic\nvariational method to determine the ground states of nuclei with mass number\n$A\\leq 4$. At next-to-next-to-leading order, two out of three independent\nthree-body parameters can be fitted to the three-body binding energies. To fix\nthe remaining one, we look for a simultaneous description of the binding energy\nof $^4$He and the charge radii of $^3$He and $^4$He. We show that at the order\nconsidered we can find an acceptable solution, within the uncertainty of the\nexpansion. We find that the EFT expansion shows good agreement with empirical\ndata within the estimated uncertainty, even for a system as dense as $^4$He.\n", "  We analyse a combination of ATLAS and CMS searches for dijet resonances at\nrun I and run II, presenting the results in a way that can be easily applied to\na generic Z' model. As an illustrative example, we consider a simple model of a\nZ' coupling to quarks and dark matter. We first study a benchmark case with\nfixed couplings and then focus on the assumption that the Z' is responsible for\nsetting the dark matter relic abundance. Dijet constraints place significant\nbounds on this scenario, allowing us to narrow down the allowed range of dark\nmatter masses for given Z' mass and width.\n", "  Ceramic samples, produced by conventional sintering method in ambient air,\n6H-SrMnO$_3$(6H-SMO), 15R-BaMnO$_3$(15R-BMO),\n4H-Ba$_{0.5}$Sr$_{0.5}$MnO$_3$(4H-BSMO) were studied. In the XRD measurements\nfor SMO the new anomalies of the lattice parameters at 600-800 K range and the\nincreasing of thermal expansion coefficients with a clear maximum in a vicinity\nat 670 K were detected. The N$\\acute{e}$el phase transition for BSMO was\nobserved at $T_N$=250 K in magnetic measurements and its trace was detected in\ndielectric, FTIR, DSC, and DMA experiments. The enthalpy and entropy changes of\nthe phase transition for BSMO at $T_N$ were determined as 17.5 J/mol and 70\nmJ/K mol, respectively. The activation energy values and relaxation times\ncharacteristic for relaxation processes were determined from the Arrhenius law.\nResults of ab initio simulations showed that the contribution of the exchange\ncorrelation energy to the total energy is about 30%.\n", "  We study the diffusive escape of cosmic rays from a central source inside a\ngalaxy cluster to obtain the suppression in the outgoing flux appearing when\nthe confinement times get comparable or larger than the age of the sources. We\nalso discuss the attenuation of the flux due to the interactions of the cosmic\nrays with the cluster medium, which can be sizeable for heavy nuclei. The\noverall suppression in the total cosmic ray flux expected on Earth is important\nto understand the shape of the extragalactic contribution to the cosmic ray\nspectrum for $E/Z<1$ EeV. This suppression can also be relevant to interpret\nthe results of fits to composition-sensitive observables measured at ultra-high\nenergies.\n", "  DarkSide-50 is a detector for dark matter candidates in the form of weakly\ninteracting massive particles (WIMPs). It utilizes a liquid argon time\nprojection chamber (LAr TPC) for the inner main detector. The TPC is surrounded\nby a liquid scintillator veto (LSV) and a water Cherenkov veto detector (WCV).\nThe LSV and WCV, both instrumented with PMTs, act as the neutron and cosmogenic\nmuon veto detectors for DarkSide-50. This paper describes the electronics and\ndata acquisition system used for these two detectors.\n", "  We study the properties of a family of anti-pervoskite materials, which are\ntopological crystalline insulators with an insulating bulk but a conducting\nsurface. Using ab-initio DFT calculations, we investigate the bulk and surface\ntopology and show that these materials exhibit type-I as well as type-II Dirac\nsurface states protected by reflection symmetry. While type-I Dirac states give\nrise to closed circular Fermi surfaces, type-II Dirac surface states are\ncharacterized by open electron and hole pockets that touch each other. We find\nthat the type-II Dirac states exhibit characteristic van-Hove singularities in\ntheir dispersion, which can serve as an experimental fingerprint. In addition,\nwe study the response of the surface states to magnetic fields.\n", "  The statistical properties of photons are fundamental to investigating\nquantum mechanical phenomena using light. In multi-photon, two-mode systems,\ncorrelations may exist between outcomes of measurements made on each mode which\nexhibit useful properties. Correlation in this sense can be thought of as\nincreasing the probability of a particular outcome of a measurement on one\nsubsystem given a measurement on a correlated subsystem. Here, we show a\nstatistical property we call \"discorrelation,\" in which the probability of a\nparticular outcome of one subsystem is reduced to zero, given a measurement on\na discorrelated subsystem. We show how such a state can be constructed using\nreadily available building blocks of quantum optics, namely coherent states,\nsingle photons, beam splitters and projective measurement. We present a variety\nof discorrelated states, show that they are entangled, and study their\nsensitivity to loss.\n", "  How do symmetries induce natural and useful quantum structures? This question\nis investigated in the context of models of three interacting particles in\none-dimension. Such models display a wide spectrum of possibilities for\ndynamical systems, from integrability to hard chaos. This article demonstrates\nthat the related but distinct notions of integrability, separability, and\nsolvability identify meaningful collective observables for Hamiltonians with\nsufficient symmetry. In turn, these observables induce tensor product\nstructures on the Hilbert space that are especially useful for storing and\nprocessing quantum information and provide guidance to interpretation and\nphenomenology of quantum few-body physics.\n", "  Determining defect types and concentrations remains a big challenge of\nsemiconductor materials science. By using ab-initio thermal conductivity\ncalculations we reveal that Ni/vacancy antisites, and not the previously\nclaimed Sn/Zr antisites, are the dominant defects affecting thermal transport\nin half-Heusler compound ZrNiSn. Our calculations correctly predict the thermal\nconductivity dependence with temperature and concentration, in quantitative\nagreement with published experimental results. Furthermore, we find a\ncharacteristic proportionality between phonon-antisite scattering rates and the\nsixth power of phonon frequency, for which we provide an analytic derivation.\nThese results suggest that thermal conductivity measurements in combination\nwith ab-initio calculations can be used to quantitatively assess defect types\nand concentrations in semiconductors.\n", "  FEMSIM, a Fortran code, has been developed to simulate the fluctuation\nelectron microscopy signal, the variance, V(k), from a model atomic structure.\nFEMSIM has been incorporated into a hybrid-reverse Monte Carlo code that\ncombines an embedded atom or Finnis-Sinclair potential with the deviation\nbetween simulated and experimental V(k) data to refine an atomic model with\nstructure constrained by both the potential and experimental data. The\nresulting models have experimentally-derived medium-range order.\n", "  The interpretation of dark matter direct detection experiments is complicated\nby the fact that neither the astrophysical distribution of dark matter nor the\nproperties of its particle physics interactions with nuclei are known in\ndetail. To address both of these issues in a very general way we develop a new\nframework that combines the full formalism of non-relativistic effective\ninteractions with state-of-the-art halo-independent methods. This approach\nmakes it possible to analyse direct detection experiments for arbitrary dark\nmatter interactions and quantify the goodness-of-fit independent of\nastrophysical uncertainties. We employ this method in order to demonstrate that\nthe degeneracy between astrophysical uncertainties and particle physics\nunknowns is not complete. Certain models can be distinguished in a\nhalo-independent way using a single ton-scale experiment based on liquid xenon,\nwhile other models are indistinguishable with a single experiment but can be\nseparated using combined information from several target elements.\n", "  Quantum phase transitions reflect singular changes taking place in a\nmany-body ground state, however, computing and analyzing large-scale critical\nwave functions constitutes a formidable challenge. New physical insights into\nthe sub-Ohmic spin-boson model are provided by the coherent state expansion\n(CSE), which represents the wave function by a linear combination of\nclassically displaced configurations. We find that the distribution of\nlow-energy displacements displays an emergent symmetry in the absence of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, while experiencing strong fluctuations of the\norder parameter near the quantum critical point. Quantum criticality provides\ntwo strong fingerprints in critical low-energy modes: an algebraic decay of the\naverage displacement and a constant universal average squeezing amplitude.\nThese observations, confirmed by extensive variational matrix product states\n(VMPS) simulations and field theory arguments, offer precious clues into the\nmicroscopics of critical many-body states in quantum impurity models.\n", "  Using a recent formulation of quantum mechanics without potential function,\nwe present a four-parameter system associated with the Wilson and Racah\npolynomials. The continuum scattering states are written in terms of the Wilson\npolynomials whose asymptotics gives the scattering amplitude and phase shift.\nOn the other hand, the finite number of discrete bound states are associated\nwith the Racah polynomials.\n  We are honored to dedicate this work to Prof. Hashim A. Yamani on the\noccasion of his 70th birthday.\n", "  We clarify the relation between noncommutative spacetimes and multifractional\ngeometries, two quantum-gravity-related approaches where the fundamental\ndescription of spacetime is not given by a classical smooth geometry. Despite\ntheir different conceptual premises and mathematical formalisms, both research\nprograms allow for the spacetime dimension to vary with the probed scale. This\nfeature and other similarities led to ask whether there is a duality between\nthese two independent proposals. In the absence of curvature and comparing the\nsymmetries of both position and momentum space, we show that $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nspacetime and the commutative multifractional theory with $q$-derivatives are\nphysically inequivalent but they admit several contact points that allow one to\ndescribe certain aspects of $\\kappa$-Minkowski noncommutative geometry as a\nmultifractional theory and vice versa. Contrary to previous literature, this\nresult holds without assuming any specific measure for $\\kappa$-Minkowski. More\ngenerally, no well-defined $\\star$-product can be constructed from the\n$q$-theory, although the latter does admit a natural noncommutative extension\nwith a given deformed Poincar\\'e algebra. A similar no-go theorem may be valid\nfor all multiscale theories with factorizable measures. Turning gravity on, we\nwrite the algebras of gravitational first-class constraints in the\nmultifractional theories with $q$- and weighted derivatives and discuss their\ndifferences with respect to the deformed algebras of $\\kappa$-Minkowski\nspacetime and of loop quantum gravity.\n", "  We report the serendipitous discovery of a quadruply lensed source at $z_{\\rm\ns}=3.76$, HSC~J115252+004733, from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey. The\nsource is lensed by an early-type galaxy at $z_{\\rm l}=0.466$ and a satellite\ngalaxy. Here, we investigate the properties of the source by studying its size\nand luminosity from the imaging and the luminosity and velocity width of the\nLy-$\\alpha$ line from the spectrum. Our analyses suggest that the source is\nmost probably a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) but the\npossibility of it being a compact bright galaxy (e.g., a Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitter\nor Lyman Break Galaxy) cannot be excluded. The brighter pair of lensed images\nappears point-like except in the HSC $i$-band (with a seeing $\\sim0.5\"$). The\nextended emission in the $i$-band image could be due to the host galaxy\nunderneath the AGN, or alternatively, due to a highly compact lensed galaxy\n(without AGN) which appears point-like in all bands except in $i$-band. We also\nfind that the flux ratio of the brighter pair of images is different in the\nKs-band compared to optical wavelengths. Phenomena such as differential\nextinction and intrinsic variability cannot explain this chromatic variation.\nWhile microlensing from stars in the foreground galaxy is less likely to be the\ncause, it cannot be ruled out completely. If the galaxy hosts an AGN, then this\nrepresents the highest redshift quadruply imaged AGN known to date, enabling\nstudy of a distant LLAGN. Discovery of this unusually compact and faint source\ndemonstrates the potential of the HSC survey.\n", "  In this paper we consider dipole-mediated correlations between DNA and\nenzymes in the context of their water environment. Such correlations emerge\nfrom electric dipole-dipole interactions between aromatic ring structures in\nDNA and in enzymes. We show that there are matching collective modes between\nDNA and enzyme dipole fields, and that a dynamic time-averaged polarization\nvanishes in the water dipole field only if either DNA, enzyme, or both are\nabsent from the sample. This persistent field may serve as the electromagnetic\nimage that, in popular colloquialisms about DNA biochemistry, allows enzymes to\n\"scan\" or \"read\" the double helix. Topologically nontrivial configurations in\nthe coherent ground state requiring clamplike enzyme behavior on the DNA may\nstem, ultimately, from spontaneously broken gauge symmetries.\n", "  We report the observation of the Goos-H\\\"anchen effect in graphene via a weak\nvalue amplification scheme. We demonstrate that the amplified Goos-H\\\"anchen\nshift in weak measurements is sensitive to the variation of graphene layers.\nCombining the Goos-H\\\"anchen effect with weak measurements may provide\nimportant applications in characterizing the parameters of graphene.\n", "  Encoding information in the position of single photons has no known limits,\ngiven infinite resources. Using a heralded single-photon source and a Spatial\nLight Modulator (SLM), we steer single photons to specific positions in a\nvirtual grid on a large-area spatially resolving photon-counting detector\n(ICCD). We experimentally demonstrate selective addressing any location\n(symbol) in a 9072 size grid (alphabet) to achieve 10.5 bit of mutual\ninformation between the sender and receiver per detected photon. Our results\nset the stage for very-high-dimensional quantum information processing.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal denotes an electronic phase of solids in which two bands\ncross linearly. In this paper we study the effect of a spatially correlated\ndisorder on such a phase. Using a renormalization group analysis, we show that\nin three dimensions, three scenarios are possible depending on the disorder\ncorrelations. A standard transition is recovered for short range correlations.\nFor disorder decaying slower than $1/r^{2}$, the Weyl semimetal is unstable to\nany weak disorder and no transition persists. In between, a new phase\ntransition occurs. This transition still separates a disordered metal from a\nsemi-metal, but with a new critical behavior that we analyze to two-loop order.\n", "  The AB-stacked bilayer graphene (BLG) is a pure semiconductor whose band gap\nand properties can be tuned by various methods such as doping or applying gate\nvoltage. Here we show an alternative method to control the electronic\nproperties of BLG; intercalation of transition metal atoms between the two\nmonolayers graphene (MLG). A theoretical investigation has been performed on\ntwo-dimensional MLG, BLG, BLG-intercalated nanostructured materials, all of\nwhich are energetically stable. Our study reveals that only MLG and\nBLG-intercalated with one Vanadium (V) atom (BLG-1V) materials have a Dirac\nCone at the K-point. This study reveals a new strategy to control the material\nproperties of BLG to exhibit various behaviors, including: metallic,\nsemi-metallic, and semiconducting by varying the concentration and spin\narrangement of the V atoms in BLG. In all the cases, the present DFT\ncalculations show that the 2p$_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the\n3d$_{yz}$ sub-shells of the V atoms provide the electron density near the Fermi\nlevel controlling the material properties of the BLG-intercalated materials.\nThus we prove that out-of-plane atoms can influence in plane electronic\ndensities in BLG.\n", "  We present mean-field calculations of azimuthally averaged retarded\ndipole-dipole interactions in a Bose-Einstein condensate induced by a laser, at\nboth long and short wavelengths. Our calculations demonstrate that\ndipole-dipole interactions become significantly stronger at shorter\nwavelengths, by as much as 30-fold, due to retardation effects. This\nenhancement, along with inclusion of the dynamic polarizability, indicate a\nmethod of inducing long-range interatomic interactions in neutral atom\ncondensates at significantly lower intensities than previously realized.\n", "  We report a density-functional-theoretic study of the stability and\nelectronic structure of two recently proposed borophene sheets with Pmmn\nsymmetry and nonzero thickness. We then investigate nanoribbons (BNRs) derived\nfrom these nanostructures, with particular attention to technologically\nrelevant properties like magnetism and electronic transport. We consider two\nperpendicular directions for the edges of the stripes as well as different\nlateral widths. We show that the Pmmn8 sheet, with 8 atoms in its unit cell and\ngenerated by two interpenetrating lattices, has a larger binding energy than\nthe Pmmn2 sheet, with only 2 atoms per unit cell. We also use their phonon\nspectra to show that the mechanical stability of the Pmmn8 sheet is superior to\nthat of the Pmmn2 sheet. Nanoribbons derived from Pmmn8 are not only more\nstable than those derived from Pmmn2, but also more interesting from the\ntechnological point of view. We find a rich variety of magnetic solutions,\ndepending on the borophene \"mother structure\", edge orientation, width and, in\nthe case of Pmmn8-derived BNRs, the sublattice of edge atoms. We show that one\ncan build BNRs with magnetic moment in both, one or none of the edges, as well\nas with parallel or antiparallel magnetic coupling between the edges when\nmagnetic; moreover, their electronic character can be semiconducting, metallic\nor half-metallic, creating a perfect spin valve at low bias. These different\nbehaviors are reflected in their densities of states, spin density and\nelectronic transport coefficients, which are analyzed in detail. Our work\nprovides a complete overview of what one may expect if nanoribbons are cut out\nfrom Pmmn sheets with a view to potential technological applications.\n", "  In this paper we point out that the generalized statistics of\nTsallis-Havrda-Charv\\'at can be conveniently used as a conceptual framework for\nstatistical treatment of random chains. In particular, we use the path-integral\napproach to show that the ensuing partition function can be identified with the\npartition function of a fluctuating oriented random loop of arbitrary length\nand shape in a background scalar potential. To put some meat on the bare bones,\nwe illustrate this with two statistical systems; Schultz-Zimm polymer and\nrelativistic particle. Further salient issues such as the $PSL(2;R)$\ntransformation properties of Tsallis' inverse-temperature parameter and a\ngrandcanonical ensemble of fluctuating random loops related to the\nTsallis-Havrda-Charv\\'at statistics are also briefly discussed.\n", "  It is widely believed that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) might be formed in\nthe current heavy ion collisions. It is also widely recognized that the\nrelativistic hydrodynamics is one of the best tools for describing the process\nof expansion and particlization of QGP. In this paper, by taking into account\nthe effects of thermal motion, a hydrodynamic model including phase transition\nfrom QGP state to hadronic state is used to analyze the rapidity and transverse\nmomentum distributions of identified charged particles produced in heavy ion\ncollisions. A comparison is made between the theoretical results and\nexperimental data. The theoretical model gives a good description to the\ncorresponding measurements made in Au-Au collisions at RHIC energies.\n", "  In the current LHC run, an accurate understanding of Standard Model processes\nis extremely important. Processes including electroweak gauge bosons serve as\nstandard candles for SM measurements, and equally constitute important\nbackgrounds for Beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) searches. We present here the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) QCD virtual contributions to W+W- + jet in an\nanalytic format obtained through unitarity methods. We present results for the\nfull process using the Monte Carlo event generator MCFM, and discuss total as\nwell as differential cross-sections for the LHC with 14 TeV center-of-mass\nenergy, as well as a future 100 TeV proton-proton machine.\n", "  We study the transport properties of a topological system coupled to an AC\nelectric field by means of Floquet-Keldysh formalism. We consider a\nsemi-infinite chain of dimers coupled to a semi-infinite metallic lead, and\nobtain the density of states and current when the system is out of equilibrium.\nOur formalism is non-perturbative and allows us to explore, in the\nthermodynamic limit, a wide range of regimes for the AC field, arbitrary values\nof the coupling strength to the metallic contact and corrections to the\nwide-band limit. We find that hybridization with the contact can change the\ndimerization phase, and that the current dependence on the field amplitude can\nbe used to discriminate between them. We also show the appearance of side-bands\nand non-equilibrium zero-energy modes, characteristic of Floquet systems. Our\nresults directly apply to the stability of non-equilibrium topological phases,\nwhen transport measurements are used for their detection.\n", "  We discuss the current status of theoretical and experimental constraints on\nthe real Higgs singlet extension of the Standard Model. For the second neutral\n(non-standard) Higgs boson the full mass range from 1 GeV to 1 TeV accessible\nat past and current collider experiments is considered. We present benchmark\nscenarios for searches for an additional Higgs state in the real Higgs singlet\nextension of the Standard Model in Run 2 of the LHC. We furthermore discuss\nelectroweak corrections to the H to hh partial decay width within this model.\n", "  High resolution digital micro-mirror devices (DMD) make it possible to\nproduce nearly arbitrary light fields with high accuracy, reproducibility and\nlow optical aberrations. However, using these devices to trap and manipulate\nultracold atomic systems for e.g. quantum simulation is often complicated by\nthe presence of kHz-frequency switching noise. Here we demonstrate a simple\nhardware extension that solves this problem and makes it possible to produce\ntruly static light fields. This modification leads to a 47 fold increase in the\ntime that we can hold ultracold $^6$Li atoms in a dipole potential created with\nthe DMD. Finally, we provide reliable and user friendly APIs written in Matlab\nand Python to control the DMD.\n", "  We build the framework for performing loop computations in the defect version\nof N=4 super Yang-Mills theory which is dual to the probe D5-D3 brane system\nwith background gauge-field flux. In this dCFT, a codimension-one defect\nseparates two regions of space-time with different ranks of the gauge group and\nthree of the scalar fields acquire non-vanishing and space-time-dependent\nvacuum expectation values. The latter leads to a highly non-trivial mass mixing\nproblem between different colour and flavour components, which we solve using\nfuzzy-sphere coordinates. Furthermore, the resulting space-time dependence of\nthe theory's Minkowski space propagators is handled by reformulating these as\npropagators in an effective AdS4. Subsequently, we initiate the computation of\nquantum corrections. The one-loop correction to the one-point function of any\nlocal gauge-invariant scalar operator is shown to receive contributions from\nonly two Feynman diagrams. We regulate these diagrams using dimensional\nreduction, finding that one of the two diagrams vanishes, and discuss the\nprocedure for calculating the one-point function of a generic operator from the\nSU(2) subsector. Finally, we explicitly evaluate the one-loop correction to the\none-point function of the BPS vacuum state, finding perfect agreement with an\nearlier string-theory prediction. This constitutes a highly non-trivial test of\nthe gauge-gravity duality in a situation where both supersymmetry and conformal\nsymmetry are partially broken.\n", "  By studying numerically the phase-ordering kinetics of a two-dimensional\nferromagnetic Ising model with quenched disorder -- either random bonds or\nrandom fields -- we show that a critical percolation structure forms in an\nearly stage and is then progressively compactified by the ensuing coarsening\nprocess. Results are compared with the non-disordered case, where a similar\nphenomenon is observed, and interpreted within a dynamical scaling framework.\n", "  In order to study the temperature dependence of the quark-hadron phase\nstructure and the QCD equation of state in vanishing and finite magnetic field,\nthe SU(3) Polyakov linear-sigma model is utilized. In mean field approximation,\nthe dependence of various magnetic properties such as magnetization, magnetic\nsusceptibility and magnetic catalysis is analyzed in finite magnetic field.\nFurthermore, the influences of finite magnetic field on the temperature\ndependence of some transport properties (viscosity and conductivity) from\nGreen-Kubo correlation are characterized.\n", "  We study Majorana devices featuring a competition between superconductivity\nand multi-channel Kondo physics. Our proposal extends previous work on\nsingle-channel Kondo systems to a topologically nontrivial setting of non-Fermi\nliquid type, where topological superconductor wires (with gap $\\Delta$)\nrepresent leads tunnel-coupled to a Coulomb-blockaded Majorana box. On the box,\na spin degree of freedom with Kondo temperature $T_K$ is nonlocally defined in\nterms of Majorana states. For $\\Delta\\gg T_K$, the destruction of Kondo\nscreening by superconductivity implies a $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson\ncurrent-phase relation. Using a strong-coupling analysis in the opposite regime\n$\\Delta \\ll T_K$, we find a $6\\pi$-periodic Josephson relation for three leads,\nwith critical current $I_c\\approx e\\Delta^2/ \\hbar T_K$, corresponding to the\ntransfer of fractionalized charges $e^*=2e/3$.\n", "  We report a study on the low-energy properties of the elastic $s-$wave\nscattering of a neutron ($n$) in the carbon isotope $^{19}$C near the critical\ncondition for the occurrence of an excited Efimov state in the three-body\n$n-n-^{18}$C system. For the separation energy of the two halo neutrons in\n$^{20}$C we use the available experimental data. We also investigate to which\nextent the universal scaling laws, strictly valid in the zero-range limit, will\nsurvive when using finite-range interactions. By allowing to vary the\n$n-^{18}$C binding energy, a scaling behavior for the real and imaginary parts\nof the $s-$wave phase-shift $\\delta_0$ is verified, emerging some universal\ncharacteristics given by the pole-position of $k\\cot(\\delta_0^R)$ and\neffective-range parameters.\n", "  We report the result from the first search for $D^0$ decays to invisible\nfinal states. The analysis is performed on a data sample of 924 $\\rm{fb}^{-1}$\ncollected at and near the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\\Upsilon(5S)$ resonances with the\nBelle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. The\nabsolute branching fraction is determined using an inclusive $D^0$ sample,\nobtained by fully reconstructing the rest of the particle system including the\nother charmed particle. No significant signal yield is observed and an upper\nlimit of $9.4\\times 10^{-5}$ is set on the branching fraction of $D^0$ to\ninvisible final states at 90\\% confidence level.\n", "  Ground-based gravitational wave interferometers such as the Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) are susceptible to\nhigh-magnitude teleseismic events, which can interrupt their operation in\nscience mode and significantly reduce the duty cycle. It can take several hours\nfor a detector to stabilize enough to return to its nominal state for\nscientific observations. The down time can be reduced if advance warning of\nimpending shaking is received and the impact is suppressed in the isolation\nsystem with the goal of maintaining stable operation even at the expense of\nincreased instrumental noise. Here we describe an early warning system for\nmodern gravitational-wave observatories. The system relies on near real-time\nearthquake alerts provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Hypocenter and\nmagnitude information is generally available in 5 to 20 minutes of a\nsignificant earthquake depending on its magnitude and location. The alerts are\nused to estimate arrival times and ground velocities at the gravitational-wave\ndetectors. In general, 90\\% of the predictions for ground-motion amplitude are\nwithin a factor of 5 of measured values. The error in both arrival time and\nground-motion prediction introduced by using preliminary, rather than final,\nhypocenter and magnitude information is minimal. By using a machine learning\nalgorithm, we develop a prediction model that calculates the probability that a\ngiven earthquake will prevent a detector from taking data. Our initial results\nindicate that by using detector control configuration changes, we could prevent\ninterruption of operation from 40-100 earthquake events in a 6-month\ntime-period.\n", "  We performed ultrafast degenerate pump-probe spectroscopy on monolayer WSe2\nnear its exciton resonance. The observed differential reflectance signals\nexhibit signatures of strong many-body interactions including the\nexciton-exciton interaction and free carrier induced band gap renormalization.\nThe exciton-exciton interaction results in a resonance blue shift which lasts\nfor the exciton lifetime (several ps), while the band gap renormalization\nmanifests as a resonance red shift with several tens ps lifetime. Our model\nbased on the many-body interactions for the nonlinear optical susceptibility\nfits well the experimental observations. The power dependence of the spectra\nshows that with the increase of pump power, the exciton population increases\nlinearly and then saturates, while the free carrier density increases\nsuperlinearly, implying that exciton Auger recombination could be the origin of\nthese free carriers. Our model demonstrates a simple but efficient method for\nquantitatively analyzing the spectra, and indicates the important role of\nCoulomb interactions in nonlinear optical responses of such 2D materials.\n", "  We report the detection of a cross-correlation signal between {\\it Fermi}\nLarge Area Telescope diffuse gamma-ray maps and catalogs of clusters. In our\nanalysis, we considered three different catalogs: WHL12, redMaPPer and\nPlanckSZ. They all show a positive correlation with different amplitudes,\nrelated to the average mass of the objects in each catalog, which also sets the\ncatalog bias. The signal detection is confirmed by the results of a stacking\nanalysis. The cross-correlation signal extends to rather large angular scales,\naround 1 degree, that correspond, at the typical redshift of the clusters in\nthese catalogs, to a few to tens of Mpc, i.e. the typical scale-length of the\nlarge scale structures in the Universe. Most likely this signal is contributed\nby the cumulative emission from AGNs associated to the filamentary structures\nthat converge toward the high peaks of the matter density field in which galaxy\nclusters reside. In addition, our analysis reveals the presence of a second\ncomponent, more compact in size and compatible with a point-like emission from\nwithin individual clusters. At present, we cannot distinguish between the two\nmost likely interpretations for such a signal, i.e. whether it is produced by\nAGNs inside clusters or if it is a diffuse gamma-ray emission from the\nintra-cluster medium. We argue that this latter, intriguing, hypothesis might\nbe tested by applying this technique to a low redshift large mass cluster\nsample.\n", "  We investigate spontaneously symmetry breaking states in the attractive\nSU($N$) Hubbard model at half filling. Combining dynamical mean-field theory\nwith the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method, we obtain the finite\ntemperature phase diagrams for the superfluid state. When $N>2$, the\nsecond-order phase transition occurs in the weak coupling region, while the\nfirst-order phase transition with the hysteresis appears in the strong coupling\nregion. We also discuss the stability of the density wave state and clarify the\ncomponent dependence of the maximum critical temperature.\n", "  To elucidate the intrinsic broadband infrared (IR) emission properties of\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs), we analyze the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of 87 z<0.5 Palomar-Green (PG) quasars. While the Elvis AGN template\nwith a moderate far-IR correction can reasonably match the SEDs of the AGN\ncomponents in ~60% of the sample (and is superior to alternatives such as that\nby Assef), it fails on two quasar populations: 1) hot-dust-deficient (HDD)\nquasars that show very weak emission thoroughly from the near-IR to the far-IR,\nand 2) warm-dust-deficient (WDD) quasars that have similar hot dust emission as\nnormal quasars but are relatively faint in the mid- and far-IR. After building\ncomposite AGN templates for these dust-deficient quasars, we successfully fit\nthe 0.3-500 {\\mu}m SEDs of the PG sample with the appropriate AGN template, an\ninfrared template of a star-forming galaxy, and a host galaxy stellar template.\n20 HDD and 12 WDD quasars are identified from the SED decomposition, including\nseven ambiguous cases. Compared with normal quasars, the HDD quasars have AGN\nwith relatively low Eddington ratios and the fraction of WDD quasars increases\nwith AGN luminosity. Moreover, both the HDD and WDD quasar populations show\nrelatively stronger mid-IR silicate emission. Virtually identical SED\nproperties are also found in some quasars from z = 0.5 to 6. We propose a\nconceptual model to demonstrate that the observed dust deficiency of quasars\ncan result from a change of structures of the circumnuclear tori that can occur\nat any cosmic epoch.\n", "  It has been pointed out that the currently most precise determination of the\nweak phase $\\phi_2 = \\alpha$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix\nachieved in $B \\to \\rho\\rho$ decays is susceptible to a small correction at a\nlevel of $(\\Gamma_\\rho/m_\\rho)^2$ due to an $I=1$ amplitude caused by the\n$\\rho$ width. Using Breit-Wigner distributions for the two pairs of pions\nforming $\\rho$ mesons, we study the $I=1$ contribution to $B\\to \\rho\\rho$ decay\nrates as function of the width and location of the $\\rho$ band. We find that in\nthe absence of a particular enhancement of the $I=1$ amplitude reducing a\nsingle band to a width $\\Gamma_\\rho$ at SuperKEKB leads to results which are\ncompletely insensitive to the $\\rho$ width. If the $I=1$ amplitude is\ndynamically enhanced relative to the $I=0,2$ amplitude one could subject its\ncontribution to a \"magnifying glass\" measurement using two separated $\\rho$\nbands of width $\\Gamma_\\rho$. Subtraction of the $I=1$ contribution from the\nmeasured decay rate would lead to a very precise determination of the $I=0,2$\namplitude needed for performing the isospin analysis.\n", "  We consider the Schr\\\"odinger operator $$-\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + V \\qquad\n\\mbox{on an interval}~~[a,b]~\\mbox{with Dirichlet boundary conditions},$$ where\n$V$ is bounded from below and prove a lower bound on the first eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_1$ in terms of sublevel estimates: if $ w_V(y) = |I_y|,\\text{ where }\nI_y := \\left\\{ x \\in [a,b]: V(x) \\leq y \\right\\},$ then $$ \\lambda_1 \\geq\n\\frac{1}{250} \\min_{y > \\min V}{\\left(\\frac{1}{w_V(y)^2} + y\\right)}.$$ The\nresult is sharp up to a universal constant if $\\left\\{ x \\in [a,b]: V(x) \\leq y\n\\right\\}$ is an interval for the value of $y$ solving the minimization problem.\nAn immediate application is as follows: let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a\nconvex domain with inradius $\\rho$ and diameter $D$ and let $u:\\Omega\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ be the first eigenfunction of the Laplacian $-\\Delta$\non $\\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions on $\\partial \\Omega$. We prove\n$$ \\| u \\|_{L^{\\infty}} \\lesssim \\frac{1}{\\rho^{}} \\left( \\frac{\\rho}{D}\n\\right)^{1/6} \\|u\\|_{L^2},$$ which answers a question of van den Berg in the\nspecial case of two dimensions.\n", "  We show the full multiscale Persson's theory for rubber friction due to\nviscoelastic losses can be approximated extremely closely to simpler models,\nlike that suggested by Persson in 1998 and similarly by Popov in his 2010 book\n(but we don't make any use of the so-called \"Method of Dimensionality\nReduction\"), so it is essentially a single scale model at the so called large\nwavevector cutoff. The dependence on the entire spectrum of roughness is\ntherefore only confusing, and we confirm this with actual exact calculations\nand reference to recent Lorenz et al (2015) data. The multiscale aspect is\nirrelevant with respect to the real critical issue: the choice of the \"free\nparameter\" best fit truncation cutoff, which shows the models are mainly\nfitting equations. In this sense, we provide at least a very simple one.\n", "  The strange-quark occupation factor ($\\gamma_s$) is determined from the\nstatistical fit of the multiplicity ratio $\\mathrm{K}^+/\\pi^+$ in a wide range\nof nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies ($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). From this\nsingle-strange-quark-subsystem, $\\gamma_s(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ was parametrized as a\ndamped trigonometric functionality and successfully implemented to the hadron\nresonance gas model, at chemical semi-equilibrium. Various particle ratios\nincluding $\\mathrm{K}^-/\\pi^-$, $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}/\\pi^-$, and\n$\\mathrm{\\bar{\\Lambda}}/\\pi^-$ are well reproduced. The phenomenology of\n$\\gamma_s(\\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ suggests that, the hadrons ($\\gamma_s$ raises) at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\simeq 7~$GeV seems to undergo a phase transition to a mixed\nphase ($\\gamma_s$ declines), which is then derived into partons ($\\gamma_s$\nremains unchanged with increasing $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$), at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \\simeq\n20~$GeV.\n", "  Controlling the insulator-to-2D-metal transition is a promising key to\novercome the scaling problem that silicon-based electronic devices will face in\nthe near future. In this context, we examine the channel formation of\nSrTiO3-based solid-gated field-effect devices in which a 2D metal phase\ncoexists with a semiconductor phase. A non-monotonic voltage-gain transfer\ncharacteristic with negative and positive slope regions is observed. We\nintroduce a numerical model that helps to rationalize the experimental findings\nin terms of the established physics of field-effect transistors and\npercolation. Our numerical study not only reproduces the experimental results\nbut also provides non-trivial predictions, which we verify experimentally.\n", "  Networks describe a range of social, biological and technical phenomena. An\nimportant property of a network is its degree correlation or assortativity,\ndescribing how nodes in the network associate based on their number of\nconnections. Social networks are typically thought to be distinct from other\nnetworks in being assortative (possessing positive degree correlations);\nwell-connected individuals associate with other well-connected individuals, and\npoorly-connected individuals associate with each other. We review the evidence\nfor this in the literature and find that, while social networks are more\nassortative than non-social networks, only when they are built using\ngroup-based methods do they tend to be positively assortative. Non-social\nnetworks tend to be disassortative. We go on to show that connecting\nindividuals due to shared membership of a group, a commonly used method, biases\ntowards assortativity unless a large enough number of censuses of the network\nare taken. We present a number of solutions to overcoming this bias by drawing\non advances in sociological and biological fields. Adoption of these methods\nacross all fields can greatly enhance our understanding of social networks and\nnetworks in general.\n", "  Recent developments in the relativistic nuclear field theory (RNFT) are\nreviewed. Based on the covariant meson-nucleon Lagrangian of quantum\nhadrodynamics, RNFT connects consistently the high-energy scale of heavy\nmesons, medium-energy range of pion and the low-energy domain of emergent\ncollective vibrations (phonons) in a parameter-free way. Mesons and phonons\nbuild up the effective interaction in various channels, in particular, the\nphonon-exchange part takes care of the retardation effects, which are of great\nimportance for the fragmentation of single-particle states, spreading of\ncollective giant resonances and soft modes, quenching and beta-decay rates with\nsignificant consequences for astrophysics and for the theory of weak processes\nin nuclei. As examples, the recently discovered impact of isospin dynamics on\nthe nuclear shell structure and the isospin-flip pairing vibrations are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Multiwavelength flares from tidal disruption and accretion of stars can be\nused to find and study otherwise dormant massive black holes in galactic\nnuclei. Previous well-monitored candidate flares are short-lived, with most\nemission confined to within ~1 year. Here we report the discovery of a well\nobserved super-long (>11 years) luminous soft X-ray flare from the nuclear\nregion of a dwarf starburst galaxy. After an apparently fast rise within ~4\nmonths a decade ago, the X-ray luminosity, though showing a weak trend of\ndecay, has been persistently high at around the Eddington limit (when the\nradiation pressure balances the gravitational force). The X-ray spectra are\ngenerally soft (steeply declining towards higher energies) and can be described\nwith Comptonized emission from an optically thick low-temperature corona, a\nsuper-Eddington accretion signature often observed in accreting stellar-mass\nblack holes. Dramatic spectral softening was also caught in one recent\nobservation, implying either a temporary transition from the super-Eddington\naccretion state to the standard thermal state or the presence of a transient\nhighly blueshifted (~0.36c) warm absorber. All these properties in concert\nsuggest a tidal disruption event of an unusually long super-Eddington accretion\nphase that has never been observed before.\n", "  We investigate the resistive switching behaviour of $\\mathrm{VO_2}$\nmicrobridges under current bias as a function of temperature and thermal\ncoupling with the heat bath. Upon increasing the electrical current bias, the\nformation of the metallic phase can progress smoothly or through sharp jumps.\nThe magnitude and threshold current values of these sharp resistance drops show\nrandom behaviour and are dramatically influenced by thermal dissipation\nconditions. Our results also evidence how the propagation of the metallic phase\ninduced by electrical current in $\\mathrm{VO_2}$, and thus the shape of the\nresulting high-conductivity path, are not predictable. We discuss the origin of\nthe switching events through a simple electro-thermal model based on the domain\nstructure of $\\mathrm{VO_2}$ films that can be useful to improve the stability\nand controllability of future $\\mathrm{VO_2}$-based devices.\n", "  Communication with a spacecraft is typically performed using Radio Frequency\n(RF). RF is a well-established and well-regulated technology that enables\ncommunication over long distances as proven by the Voyager 1 & II missions.\nHowever, RF requires licensing of very limited radio spectrum and this poses a\nchallenge in the future, particularly with spectrum time-sharing. This is of a\nconcern for emergency communication when it is of utmost urgency to contact the\nspacecraft and maintain contact, particularly when there is a major mission\nanomaly or loss of contact. For these applications, we propose a backup laser\ncommunication system where a laser is beamed towards a satellite and the\nonboard photovoltaics acts as a laser receiver. This approach enables a laser\nground station to broadcast commands to the spacecraft in times of emergency.\nAdding an actuated reflector to the laser receiver on the spacecraft enables\ntwo-way communication between ground and the spacecraft, but without the laser\nbeing located on the spacecraft. In this paper, we analyze the feasibility of\nthe concept in the laboratory and develop a benchtop experiment to verify the\nconcept. We have also developed a preliminary design for a 6U CubeSat-based\ndemonstrator to evaluate technology merits\n", "  The split step quantum walk for two noninteracting particles is numerically\nsimulated. The entropy of entanglement and spatial particle distributions are\ncalculated for a range of initial states and for a range of disorder. The\nimpact of varying the topological phase on these quantities is discussed.\n", "  Combination of electric fields and Joule self-heating is used to change the\noxygen stoichiometry and promote oxygen vacancy drift in a free-standing\n$\\mathrm{(La,Sr)MnO_3}$ thin film microbridge placed in controlled atmosphere.\nBy controlling the local oxygen vacancies concentration, we can reversibly\nswitch our LSMO-based microbridges from metallic to insulating behavior on\ntimescales lower than 1 s and with small applied voltages (<5 V). The strong\ntemperature gradients given by the microbridge geometry strongly confine the\nmotion of oxygen vacancies, limiting the modified region within the\nfree-standing area. Multiple resistive states can be set by selected current\npulses that determine different oxygen vacancies profiles within the device .\nQualitative analysis of device operation is also provided with the support of\nFinite Element Analysis.\n", "  This paper presents a model based on Deep Learning algorithms of LSTM and GRU\nfor facilitating an anomaly detection in Large Hadron Collider superconducting\nmagnets. We used high resolution data available in Post Mortem database to\ntrain a set of models and chose the best possible set of their\nhyper-parameters. Using Deep Learning approach allowed to examine a vast body\nof data and extract the fragments which require further experts examination and\nare regarded as anomalies. The presented method does not require tedious manual\nthreshold setting and operator attention at the stage of the system setup.\nInstead, the automatic approach is proposed, which achieves according to our\nexperiments accuracy of 99%. This is reached for the largest dataset of 302 MB\nand the following architecture of the network: single layer LSTM, 128 cells, 20\nepochs of training, look_back=16, look_ahead=128, grid=100 and optimizer Adam.\nAll the experiments were run on GPU Nvidia Tesla K80\n", "  PHOTOMETRYPIPELINE (PP) is an automated pipeline that produces calibrated\nphotometry from imaging data through image registration, aperture photometry,\nphotometric calibration, and target identification with only minimal human\ninteraction. PP utilizes the widely used Source Extractor software for source\nidentification and aperture photometry; SCAMP is used for image registration.\nBoth image registration and photometric calibration are based on matching field\nstars with star catalogs, requiring catalog coverage of the respective field. A\nnumber of different astrometric and photometric catalogs can be queried online.\nRelying on a sufficient number of background stars for image registration and\nphotometric calibration, PP is well-suited to analyze data from small to\nmedium-sized telescopes. Calibrated magnitudes obtained by PP are typically\naccurate within 0.03 mag and astrometric accuracies are of the order of 0.3\narcsec relative to the catalogs used in the registration. The pipeline consists\nof an open-source software suite written in Python 2.7, can be run on\nUnix-based systems on a simple desktop machine, and is capable of realtime data\nanalysis. PP has been developed for observations of moving targets, but can be\nused for analyzing point source observations of any kind.\n", "  We describe here a procedure to combine measurements in the 393.37 nm Ca II K\nspectral line taken at different observatories. Measurements from the National\nSolar Observatory (NSO) Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) on the Synoptic\nOptical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) telescope, the NSO/Sac Peak\nCa II K-Line Monitoring Program, and Ca II K filtergrams from Kodaikanal Solar\nObservatory (KKL) are merged together to create a pair of composites of the Ca\nII K 1-A emission index. These composites are publicly available from the SOLIS\nwebsite at http://solis.nso.edu/0/iss/.\n", "  A recursive form of arbitrary-order Wronskian associated with transformation\nfunctions in the confluent algorithm of supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY)\nis constructed. With this recursive form regularity conditions for the\ngenerated potentials can be analyzed. Moreover, as byproducts we obtain new\nrepresentations of solutions to Schr\\\"odinger equations that underwent a\nconfluent SUSY-transformation.\n", "  A recent development in radio astronomy is to replace traditional dishes with\nmany small antennas. The signals are combined to form one large, virtual\ntelescope. The enormous data streams are cross-correlated to filter out noise.\nThis is especially challenging, since the computational demands grow\nquadratically with the number of data streams. Moreover, the correlator is not\nonly computationally intensive, but also very I/O intensive. The LOFAR\ntelescope, for instance, will produce over 100 terabytes per day. The future\nSKA telescope will even require in the order of exaflops, and petabits/s of\nI/O. A recent trend is to correlate in software instead of dedicated hardware,\nto increase flexibility and to reduce development efforts.\n  We evaluate the correlator algorithm on multi-core CPUs and many-core\narchitectures, such as NVIDIA and ATI GPUs, and the Cell/B.E. The correlator is\na streaming, real-time application, and is much more I/O intensive than\napplications that are typically implemented on many-core hardware today. We\ncompare with the LOFAR production correlator on an IBM Blue Gene/P\nsupercomputer. We investigate performance, power efficiency, and\nprogrammability. We identify several important architectural problems which\ncause architectures to perform suboptimally. Our findings are applicable to\ndata-intensive applications in general.\n  The processing power and memory bandwidth of current GPUs are highly\nimbalanced for correlation purposes. While the production correlator on the\nBlue Gene/P achieves a superb 96% of the theoretical peak performance, this is\nonly 16% on ATI GPUs, and 32% on NVIDIA GPUs. The Cell/B.E. processor, in\ncontrast, achieves an excellent 92%. We found that the Cell/B.E. and NVIDIA\nGPUs are the most energy-efficient solutions, they run the correlator at least\n4 times more energy efficiently than the Blue Gene/P.\n", "  By using numerical and analytical methods, we describe the generation of\nfine-scale lateral electromagnetic waves, called surface plasmon-polaritons\n(SPPs), on atomically thick, metamaterial conducting sheets in two spatial\ndimensions (2D). Our computations capture the two-scale character of the total\nfield and reveal how each edge of the sheet acts as a source of an SPP that may\ndominate the diffracted field. We use the finite element method to numerically\nimplement a variational formulation for a weak discontinuity of the tangential\nmagnetic field across a hypersurface. An adaptive, local mesh refinement\nstrategy based on a posteriori error estimators is applied to resolve the\npronounced two-scale character of wave propagation and radiation over the\nmetamaterial sheet. We demonstrate by numerical examples how a singular\ngeometry, e.g., sheets with sharp edges, and sharp spatial changes in the\nassociated surface conductivity may significantly influence surface plasmons in\nnanophotonics.\n", "  Some modern cosmological models predict the appearance of Boltzmann Brains:\nobservers who randomly fluctuate out of a thermal bath rather than naturally\nevolving from a low-entropy Big Bang. A theory in which most observers are of\nthe Boltzmann Brain type is generally thought to be unacceptable, although\nopinions differ. I argue that such theories are indeed unacceptable: the real\nproblem is with fluctuations into observers who are locally identical to\nordinary observers, and their existence cannot be swept under the rug by a\nchoice of probability distributions over observers. The issue is not that the\nexistence of such observers is ruled out by data, but that the theories that\npredict them are cognitively unstable: they cannot simultaneously be true and\njustifiably believed.\n", "  Using a recent reformulation of quantum mechanics where the potential\nfunction is not required, we are able to obtain the energy spectrum and wave\nfunction associated with the infinite square well analytically. Therefore, this\nwork constitutes an example of how to establish the correspondence between this\napproach and the standard formulation of quantum mechanics.\n", "  In this work we perform the Hamilton-Jacobi constraint analysis of the four\ndimensional Background Field (BF) model with cosmological term. We obtain the\ncomplete set of involutive Hamiltonians that guarantee the integrability of the\nsystem and identify the reduced phase space. From the fundamental differential\nwe recover the equations of motion and obtain the generators of the gauge and\nshift transformations.\n", "  We propose a way for transferring Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled\nstates from $n$ qubits in one cavity onto another $n$ qubits in the other\ncavity. It is shown that $n$-qubit GHZ states $\\alpha \\left\\vert\n00...0\\right\\rangle +\\beta \\left\\vert 11...1\\right\\rangle $ with arbitrary\ndegree of entanglement can be transferred deterministically. Both of the GHZ\nstate transfer and the operation time are not dependent on the number of\nqubits, and there is no need of measurement. This proposal is quite general and\ncan be applied to accomplish the same task for a wide range of physical qubits.\nFurthermore, note that the $n$-qubit GHZ state $\\alpha \\left\\vert\n00...0\\right\\rangle +\\beta \\left\\vert 11...1\\right\\rangle $ is a\nquantum-secret-sharing code for encoding a single-qubit arbitrary pure state\n$\\alpha \\left\\vert 0\\right\\rangle +\\beta \\left\\vert 1\\right\\rangle $. Thus,\nthis work also provides a way to transfer quantum secret sharing from $n$\nqubits in one cavity to another $n$ qubits in the other cavity.\n", "  We re-examine the way in which Bogoliubov's theory of a dilute Bose gas at\n$T=0$ has been extended to describe the statistical mechanics of interacting\nbosons at finite temperature. We show explicitly that the field-theoretic\ncalculation of the grand partition function in this formulation amounts to a\ncanonical trace over the eigenfunctions of the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian at fixed\ntotal number of bosons $N$, and that the additional trace over $N$ that is\nrequired in the grand-canonical formalism is never carried out. This implies\nthat what usually passes as the grand-canonical treatment of the Bogoliubov\nHamiltonian is not quite grand-canonical, and is in fact a canonical one. We\nalso show that the discontinuity in the condensate density predicted by\nprevious formulations of this theory as the temperature $T$ goes past the\ncritical transition temperature $T_c$ is a direct consequence of an\ninappropriate generalization of the Bogoliubov prescription to finite\ntemperatures, and that this discontinuity disappears when this prescription is\neither used as a zero temperature approximation or avoided altogether. Armed\nwith the above findings, we reformulate the statistical mechanics of\ninteracting bosons in the canonical ensemble and derive the thermodynamics of\nthe system. We then show how the canonical treatment can be used to setup a\ntruly grand-canonical description of the statistical mechanics of a weakly\ninteracting Bose gas where the average number of bosons in the system varies\nwith temperature, unlike existing formulations where the total number of bosons\n$N$ is taken to be a constant that does not depend on $T$. Consequences on the\nphysics of interacting bosons are briefly discussed.\n", "  In order to understand the role of radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) in galaxy\nevolution, we must determine the relative levels of accretion and\nstar-formation activity within these objects. Previous work at low radio\nflux-densities has shown that accretion makes a significant contribution to the\ntotal radio emission, in contrast with other quasar studies that suggest star\nformation dominates. To investigate, we use 70 RQQs from the Spitzer-Herschel\nActive Galaxy Survey. These quasars are all at $z$ ~ 1, thereby minimising\nevolutionary effects, and have been selected to span a factor of ~100 in\noptical luminosity, so that the luminosity dependence of their properties can\nbe studied. We have imaged the sample using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(JVLA), whose high sensitivity results in 35 RQQs being detected above 2\n$\\sigma$. This radio dataset is combined with far-infrared luminosities derived\nfrom grey-body fitting to Herschel photometry. By exploiting the\nfar-infrared--radio correlation observed for star-forming galaxies, and\ncomparing two independent estimates of the star-formation rate, we show that\nstar formation alone is not sufficient to explain the total radio emission.\nConsidering RQQs above a 2-$\\sigma$ detection level in both the radio and the\nfar-infrared, 92 per cent are accretion-dominated, and the accretion process\naccounts for 80 per cent of the radio luminosity when summed across the\nobjects. The radio emission connected with accretion appears to be correlated\nwith the optical luminosity of the RQQ, whilst a weaker luminosity-dependence\nis evident for the radio emission connected with star formation.\n", "  The phase diagram of numerous materials of technological importance features\nhigh-symmetry high-temperature phases that exhibit phonon instabilities.\nLeading examples include shape-memory alloys, as well as ferroelectric,\nrefractory, and structural materials. The thermodynamics of these phases have\nproven challenging to handle by atomistic computational thermodynamic\ntechniques, due to the occurrence of constant anharmonicity-driven hopping\nbetween local low-symmetry distortions, while maintaining a high-symmetry\ntime-averaged structure. To compute the free energy in such phases, we propose\nto explore the system's potential-energy surface by discrete sampling of local\nminima by means of a lattice gas Monte Carlo approach and by continuous\nsampling by means of a lattice dynamics approach in the vicinity of each local\nminimum. Given the proximity of the local minima, it is necessary to carefully\npartition phase space by using a Voronoi tessellation to constrain the domain\nof integration of the partition function, in order to avoid double-counting\nartifacts and enable an accurate harmonic treatment near each local minima. We\nconsider the bcc phase of titanium as a prototypical examples to illustrate our\napproach.\n", "  Landauer's principle claims that \"Information is Physical.\" It is not\nsurprising that its conceptual antithesis, Wheeler's \"It from Bit,\" has been\nmore popular among computer scientists --- in the form of the Church-Turing\nhypothesis: All natural processes can be computed by a universal Turing\nmachine; physical laws then become descriptions of subsets of observable, as\nopposed to merely possible, computations. Switching back and forth between the\ntwo traditional styles of thought, motivated by quantum-physical Bell\ncorrelations and the doubts they raise about fundamental space-time causality,\nwe look for an intrinsic, physical randomness notion and find one around the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Bell correlations combined with complexity as\nrandomness tell us that beyond-Turing computations are either physically\nimpossible, or they can be carried out by \"devices\" as simple as individual\nphotons.\n", "  The noncommutative space provides a framework to understand phenomena in\nPlanck scale physics. However, there is no any direct experimental evidence to\ndemonstrate the existence of noncommutative space. We propose an experimental\nscheme based on the Aharonov-Bohm effect in the nano-scale quantum mechanics to\nprobe the phenomena in the noncommutative phase space. By the Seiberg-Witten\nmap, the free electrons of the nano-scale ring in noncommutative phase space\ncan be mapped equivalently to the quantum mechanical (Heisenberg's algebra)\nphase space with an extra effective magnetic flux. We introduce two variables\nrelated to the persistent current in the ring to probe the noncommutative phase\nspace effect. We give a value-independent criterion to detect the existence of\nthe noncommutative phase space. Namely the answer for existence or nonexistence\nof the noncommutative phase space depends only on the trend of the curves,\nrather than the values of the observation data. It can be expected to catch the\nnoncommutative phase-space effect by this scheme.\n", "  Radiaitve mechanism of conformal symmetry breaking in a comformal-invariant\nversion of the Standard Model is considered.

For certain tunnelling\nbarrier configurations and high sample bias we find a pronounced resonance\nassociated with a Fermi edge singularity. This many-body scattering effect\nappears when the electrochemical potential of the quantum dot is aligned with\nthe Fermi level of the lead less coupled to the dot. By changing the relative\ntunnelling barrier strength we are able to tune the interaction of the\nlocalised electron with the Fermi sea.\n", "  We computationally investigate the wave propagation characteristics of\nnanoscopic granular crystals composed of one-dimensionally arrayed gold\nnanoparticles using molecular dynamics simulation. We examine two basic\nconfigurations, i.e. homogeneous lattices and diatomic lattices with\nmass-mismatch. We discover that homogeneous lattices of gold nanospheres\nsupport weakly dissipative and highly localized solitary wave at 300 K, while\ndiatomic lattices have a good tuning ability of transmittance and wave speed.\nWe establish a validated nonlinear spring contact model with the consideration\nof complex interactions between gold nanospheres which reveals the physical\nnature of wave behaviors at nanoscale. This work sheds light on the application\nof nanogold as a novel mechanical wave tuner, qualitatively and fundamentally\ndifferent from its counterpart granular materials at meso- and macroscale.\n", "  In this paper, we present temperature and field dependent neutron diffraction\n(ND) study to unravel the structural and the magnetic properties in\nNi50Mn38Sb12 Heusler system. This alloy shows martensitic transition from high\ntemperature austenite cubic phase to low temperature martensite orthorhombic\nphase on cooling. At 3 K, the lattice parameters and magnetic moments are found\nto be almost insensitive to field. Just below the martensitic transition\ntemperature, the martensite phase fraction is found to be 85%. Upon applying\nthe field, the austenite phase becomes dominant, and the field induced reverse\nmartensitic transition is clearly observed in the ND data. Therefore, the\npresent study gives an estimate of the strength of the martensite phase or the\nsharpness of the martensitic transition. Variation of individual moments and\nthe change in the phase fraction obtained from the analysis of the ND data\nvividly show the change in the magneto-structural state of the material across\nthe transition.\n", "  The multiple assignment scheme is to assign one or more shares to single\nparticipant so that any kind of access structure can be realized by classical\nsecret sharing schemes.

Dipole masses for the momentum dependence of the form factors\nare extracted and compared to experiment, as is the nucleon magnetic moment and\ncharge and magnetic radii.\n", "  The Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program is a short-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiment in the Booster Neutrino Beam-line (BNB) at Fermilab. It\nconsists of three Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LArTPCs) from the\nShort-Baseline Near Detector (SBND), Micro Booster Neutrino Experiment\n(MicroBooNE), and Imaging Cosmic And Rare Underground Signals (ICARUS)\nexperiments. The SBN Program will definitively search for short-baseline\nneutrino oscillations in the 1 eV mass range, make precision neutrino-argon\ninteraction measurements, and further develop the LArTPC technology. The\nphysics program and current status of the program, and its constituent\nexperiments, are presented.\n", "  -Purpose: A neural network estimator to process x-ray spectral measurements\nfrom photon counting detectors with pileup. The estimator is used with an\nexpansion of the attenuation coefficient as a linear combination of functions\nof energy multiplied by coefficients that depend on the material composition at\npoints within the object [R.E. Alvarez and A. Macovski, Phys. Med. Biol., 1976,\n733-744]. The estimator computes the line integrals of the coefficients from\nmeasurements with different spectra. Neural network estimators are trained with\nmeasurements of a calibration phantom with the clinical x-ray system. One\nestimator uses low noise training data and another network is trained with data\ncomputed by adding random noise to the low noise data. The performance of the\nestimators is compared to each other and to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).\nMethods: The estimator performance is measured using a Monte Carlo simulation\nwith an idealized model of a photon counting detector that includes only pileup\nand quantum noise. Transmitted x-ray spectra are computed for a calibration\nphantom. The transmitted spectra are used to compute random data for photon\ncounting detectors with pileup. Detectors with small and large dead times are\nconsidered. Neural network training data with extremely low noise are computed\nby averaging the random detected data with pileup for a large numbers of\nexposures of the phantom. Each exposure is equivalent to a projection image or\none projection of a computed tomography scan. Training data with high noise are\ncomputed by using data from one exposure. Finally, training data are computed\nby adding random data to the low noise data. The added random data are\nmultivariate normal with zero mean and covariance equal to the sample\ncovariance of data for an object with properly chosen attenuation. To test the\nestimators, random data are computed for different thicknesses of three test\nobjects with different compositions. These are used as inputs to the neural\nnetwork estimators. The mean squared errors (MSE), variance and square of the\nbias of the neural networks' outputs with the random object data are each\ncompared to the CRLB. Results: The MSE for a network trained with low noise\ndata and added noise is close to the CRLB for both the low and high pileup\ncases. Networks trained with very low noise data have low bias but large\nvariance for both pileup cases. ralvarez@aprendtech.com Networks trained with\nhigh noise data have both large bias and large variance. Conclusion: With a\nproperly chosen level of added training data noise, a neural network estimator\nfor photon counting data with pileup can have variance close to the CRLB with\nnegligible bias.\n", "  The screened Coulomb interaction between uniformly charged flat plates is\nconsidered at very small plate separations for which the Debye layers are\nstrongly overlapped, in the limit of small electrical potentials. If the plates\nare of infinite length, the disjoining pressure between the plates decays as an\ninverse power of the plate separation. If the plates are of finite length, we\nshow that screening Debye layer charges close to the edge of the plates are no\nlonger constrained to stay between the plates, but instead spill out into the\nsurrounding electrolyte. The resulting reduction in the disjoining pressure is\ncalculated analytically. A similar reduction of disjoining pressure due to loss\nof lateral confinement of the Debye layer charges should occur whenever the\nsizes of the interacting charged objects become small enough to approach the\nDebye scale. We investigate the effect here in the context of a two dimensional\nmodel problem that is sufficiently simple to yield analytical results.\n", "  We have investigated the effect of site dilution with substitution of\nnonmagnetic element in SrRu$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ ($x$ $\\leq$ 0.7). The nature of\nferromagnetic state in SrRuO$_3$ is believed to be of itinerant type with\ntransition temperature $T_c$ $\\sim$ 162 K. Crystallographically, SrRuO$_3$ has\na distorted orthorhombic structure. Substitution of Ti$^{+4}$ (3$d^0$) for\nRu$^{+4}$ (4$d^4$), however, does not introduce significant structural\nmodification due to their matching ionic radii. This substitution, on the other\nhand, is expected to tune the electronic correlation effect and the $d$\nelectron density in system. With Ti substitution, we find that magnetic moment\nand Curie temperature decreases but $T_c$ remains unchanged which has been\nattributed to opposite tuning of electron correlation effect and density of\nstates within framework of itinerant ferromagnetism. The estimated critical\nexponent ($\\beta$) related to magnetization implies a mean-field type of\nmagnetic nature in SrRuO$_3$. The value of $\\beta$ further increases with $x$\nwhich is understood from the dilution effect of magnetic lattice. The system\nevolves to exhibit Griffiths phase like behavior above $T_c$ which is usually\nrealized in diluted ferromagnet following local moment model of magnetism. Our\ndetail analysis of magnetization data indicates that magnetic state in\nSrRuO$_3$ has contribution from both itinerant and local moment model of\nmagnetism.\n", "  This article deals with the multiscale modeling of stress transfer\ncharacteristics of nano-reinforced polymer composite reinforced with regularly\nstaggered carbon fibers. The distinctive feature of construction of\nnano-reinforced composite is such that the microscale carbon fibers are packed\nin hexagonal array in the carbon nanotube reinforced polymer matrix (CNRP). We\nconsidered three different cases of CNRP, in which carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are:\n(i) aligned along the direction of carbon fiber, (ii) aligned radially to the\naxis of carbon fiber, and (iii) randomly dispersed. Accordingly, multiscale\nmodels were developed. First, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and then\nMori-Tanaka technique were used to estimate the effective elastic properties of\nCNRP. Second, a micromechanical three-phase shear lag model was developed\nconsidering the staggering effect of microscale fibers and the application of\nradial loads on the cylindrical representative volume element (RVE) of\nnano-reinforced composite. Our results reveal that the stress transfer\ncharacteristics of the nano-reinforced composite are significantly improved by\ncontrolling the CNT morphology, particularly, when they are randomly dispersed\naround the microscale fiber. The results from the developed shear lag model\nwere also validated with the finite element shear lag simulations and found to\nbe in good agreement.\n", "  - We made use of a combination of three models that describe plasma\nequilibrium, cluster kinetics and aerosol dynamics in order to investigate\nsolid carbonaceous dust formation in a DC gas discharge where the carbon source\nis provided by a graphite cathode sputtering. This enabled us to determine the\ntime-evolution of some of the particle characteristics, e., g. total density,\nmean-diameter, average-charge as function of the sputtering yield. We showed\nthat for few minutes discharge duration, the particle density reaches 10 7-10 8\ncm-3 , the particle mean diameter is approximately 40 nm and the particle size\ndistributions are bimodal for all the investigated conditions. We also showed\nthat the variation of the sputtering yield affects in a quite unexpected way\nthe interplay between the phenomena involved in the aerosol dynamics.\nBasically, larger sputtering yields result in larger density and coagulation\nrate on one hand, and in a limited nucleation and surface sticking kinetics on\nthe other hand.\n", "  We present selected results obtained by RQCD from simulations of $N_f=2+1$\nflavours of non-perturbatively $\\mathcal{O}(a)$ improved Wilson fermions,\nemploying open boundary conditions in time. The ensembles were created within\nthe CLS (Coordinated Lattice Simulations) effort at five different values of\nthe lattice spacing, ranging from 0.085fm down to below 0.04fm. Many quark mass\ncombinations were realized, in particular along lines where the sum of the bare\nquark masses was kept fixed as well as trajectories of an approximately\nphysical renormalized strange quark mass. Several key observables, including\nmeson and baryon masses and the axial charge of the nucleon have been computed,\nand preliminary results are presented here. In some cases an accurate and\ncontrolled extrapolation to the continuum limit has become possible.\n", "  We show how some parton distribution functions related to the transverse spin\nof nucleons can be extracted point by point from combinations of proton and\ndeuteron observables. In particular, we present a determination of the valence\nand sea Sivers functions from the single-spin asymmetries measured by COMPASS.\n", "  Free-surface liquid metal flows tend to be uneven due to instabilities and\nother effects. Some applications, however, require constant, uniform liquid\nmetal thickness. This is for example the case of liquid walls in nuclear fusion\nreactors. With this motivation, here we present experimental results on the\nstabilization of a free-surface flow of Galinstan. The flow was sustained by an\nelectromagnetic induction pump featuring rotating permanent magnets. Evidence\nis reported of the flowing Galinstan layer becoming flatter in the presence of\na sufficiently strong magnetic field, either alone (passive stabilization) or\nin combination with an electrical current passing through the liquid metal\n(active stabilization). The results are interpreted in terms of an effective\nviscosity and effective gravity, respectively.\n", "  Studies of the large $N$ behaviour of the topological properties of gauge\ntheories typically focused on the large $N$ scaling of the topological\nsusceptibility. A much more difficult task is the study of the behaviour of\nhigher cumulants of the topological charge in the large $N$ limit, which up to\nnow remained elusive. We will present first results confirming the expected\nlarge $N$ scaling of the coefficient commonly denoted by $b_2$, related to the\nkurtosis of the topological charge.\n", "  The Anthropocene is characterized by close interdependencies between the\nnatural Earth system and the human society, posing novel challenges to model\ndevelopment. Here we present a conceptual model describing the long-term\ncoevolution of natural and socioeconomic subsystems of Earth. While the climate\nis represented via a global carbon cycle, we use economic concepts to model\nsocio-metabolic flows of biomass and fossil fuels between nature and society. A\nwellbeing-dependent parametrization of fertility and mortality governs human\npopulation dynamics. Our analysis focuses on assessing possible asymptotic\nstates of the Earth system for a qualitative understanding of its complex\ndynamics rather than quantitative predictions. Low dimension and simple\nequations enable a parameter-space analysis allowing us to identify\npreconditions of several asymptotic states and hence fates of humanity and\nplanet. These include a sustainable co-evolution of nature and society, a\nglobal collapse and everlasting oscillations. We consider scenarios\ncorresponding to different socio-cultural stages of human history. The\nnecessity of accounting for the \"human factor\" in Earth system models is\nhighlighted by the fact that carbon stocks during the past centuries evolved\nopposing to what would \"naturally\" be expected on a planet without humans. The\nintensity of biomass use and the contribution of ecosystem services to human\nwell-being are found to be crucial determinants of the asymptotic state in a\nbiomass-only scenario. The capitalistic, fossil-based scenario reveals that\ntrajectories with fundamentally different asymptotic states might still be\nalmost indistinguishable during a very long transient phase. Given current\npopulation levels, our study also supports the claim that besides reducing the\nglobal demand for energy, only the extensive use of renewable energies may pave\nthe way into a sustainable future.\n", "  The giant magnetoresistance (GMR) and structure was investigated for\nelectrodeposited Co/Cu multilayers prepared by a conventional\ngalvanostatic/potentiostatic pulse combination from a pure sulfate electrolyte\nwith various layer thicknesses, total multilayer thickness and Cu deposition\npotential. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed superlattice satellite\nreflections for many of the multilayers having sufficiently large thickness (at\nleast 2 nm) of both constituent layers. The bilayer repeats derived from the\npositions of the visible superlattice reflections were typically 10-20% higher\nthan the nominal values.The observed GMR was found to be dominated by the\nmultilayer-like ferromagnetic (FM) contribution even for multilayers without\nvisible superlattice satellites. There was always also a modest\nsuperparamagnetic (SPM) contribution to the GMR and this term was the largest\nfor multilayers with very thin (0.5 nm) magnetic layers containg apparently a\nsmall amount of magnetically decoupled SPM regions. No oscillatory GMR behavior\nwith spacer thickness was observed at any magnetic layer thickness. The\nsaturation of the coercivity as measured by the peak position of the MR(H)\ncurves indicated a complete decoupling of magnetic layers for large spacer\nthicknesses. The GMR increased with total multilayer thickness which could be\nascribed to an increasing SPM contribution to the GMR due to an increasing\nsurface roughness, also indicated by the increasing coercivity. For multilayers\nwith Cu layers deposited at more and more positive potentials, the GMRFM term\nincreased and the GMRSPM term decreased. At the same time, a corresponding\nreduction of surface roughness measured with atomic force microscopy indicated\nan improvement of the multilayer structural quality which was, however, not\naccompanied by an increase of the superlattice reflection intensities.\n", "  High-energy cosmic rays are one of the primary sources of information for\nscientists investigating the elementary properties of matter. The need to study\ncosmic rays, with energies thousands of times larger than those encountered in\nparticle accelerators, led to the development of modern detection hardware and\nexperimental methodologies. We present a low power, low complexity data\nacquisition (DAQ) system with 100 ps resolution, suitable for particle and\nradiation detection experiments. The system uses a Multiple-Time-over-Threshold\n(MToT) technique for the treatment of the output signal of Photo Multiplier\nTubes (PMTs). The use of three thresholds compensates for the slewing effects\nand offers a more accurate measurement of the PMT pulses' width. For the\nevaluation of the pulse the system uses comparators and a Time-to-Digital (TDC)\nconverter, whereas the pulses are time-stamped using the GPS signal. The\nprototype card is analyzed for its noise behavior and is tested to verify its\nperformance. The system has been designed for the HEllenic LYceum Cosmic\nObservatories Network (HELYCON) Extensive Air Showers (EAS) detector.\n", "  The WFI (Wide Field Imager) instrument is planned to be one of two\ncomplementary focal plane cameras on ESA's next X-ray observatory Athena. It\ncombines unprecedented survey power through its large field of view of 40 amin\nx 40 amin together with excellent count rate capability (larger than 1 Crab).\nThe energy resolution of the silicon sensor is state-of-the-art in the energy\nband of interest from 0.2 keV to 15 keV, e.g. the full width at half maximum of\na line at 7 keV will be better than 170 eV until the end of the nominal mission\nphase. This performance is accomplished by using DEPFET active pixel sensors\nwith a pixel size of 130 x 130 microns is well suited to the on-axis angular\nresolution of 5 arcsec half energy width (HEW) of the mirror system. Each\nDEPFET pixel is a combined sensor-amplifier structure with a MOSFET integrated\nonto a fully depleted 450 micron thick silicon bulk. Two detectors are planned\nfor the WFI instrument: A large-area detector comprising four sensors with a\ntotal of 1024 x 1024 pixels and a fast detector optimized for high count rate\nobservations. This high count rate capable detector permits for bright point\nsources with an intensity of 1 Crab a throughput of more than 80% and a pile-up\nof less than 1 %. The fast readout of the DEPFET pixel matrices is facilitated\nby an ASIC development, called VERITAS-2. Together with the Switcher-A, a\ncontrol ASIC that allows for operation of the DEPFET in rolling shutter mode,\nthese elements form the key components of the WFI detectors. The detectors are\nsurrounded by a graded-Z shield, which has in particular the purpose to avoid\nfluorescence lines that would contribute to the instrument\nbackground...[Abridged]\n", "  Physical properties of a pyrohafnate compound Pr2Hf2O7 have been investigated\nby ac magnetic susceptibility \\chi_ ac(T), dc magnetic susceptibility \\chi(T),\nisothermal magnetization M(H) and heat capacity C_p(T) measurements on\npolycrystalline as well as single crystal samples combined with high-resolution\nsynchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) for structural characterization and\ninelastic neutron scattering (INS) to determine the crystal field energy level\nscheme and wave functions. Synchrotron XRD data confirm the ordered cubic\npyrochlore (Fd-3m) structure without any noticeable site mixing or oxygen\ndeficiency. No clear evidence of long range magnetic ordering is observed down\nto 90 mK, however the \\chi_ac(T) evinces slow spin dynamics revealed by a\nfrequency dependent broad peak associated with spin freezing. The INS data\nreveal the expected five well defined magnetic excitations due to crystal field\nsplitting of the J = 4 ground state multiplet of the Pr^3+. The crystal field\nparameters and ground state wavefunction of Pr^3+ have been determined. The\nIsing anisotropic nature of magnetic ground state is inferred from the INS as\nwell as \\chi(T) and M(H) data. Together these properties make Pr2Hf2O7 a\ncandidate compound for quantum spin-ice behavior.\n", "  Graphene nanowiggles (GNW) are graphene-based nanostructures obtained by\nmaking alternated regular cuts in pristine graphene nanoribbons. GNW were\nrecently synthesized and it was demonstrated that they exhibit tunable\nelectronic and magnetic properties by just varying their shape. Here, we have\ninvestigated the mechanical properties and fracture patterns of a large number\nof GNW of different shapes and sizes using fully atomistic reactive molecular\ndynamics simulations. Our results show that the GNW mechanical properties are\nstrongly dependent on its shape and size and, as a general trend narrow sheets\nhave larger ultimate strength and Young's modulus than wide ones. The estimated\nYoung's modulus values were found to be in a range of ~ 100-1000 GPa and the\nultimate strength in a range of ~ 20-110 GPa, depending on GNW shape. Also,\nsuper-ductile behaviour under strain was observed for some structures.\n", "  We provide a simple derivation for particle production in heavy-ion\ncollisions that is proportional to the rate of entropy production. We find that\nthe particle production depends only on the power of the centre-of-mass\ncollision energy $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ and the effective phase-space/volume (e.g.\ngeometry of the collision approximated by the number of nucleons participating\nin the collision $N_{\\rm part}$). We show that at low-energies the\npseudo-rapidity density of particles per participating nucleon pair scales\nlinearly with $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ while at high-energies with $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}^{1/3}$. The $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}^{1/3}$ region is directly related to\nsub-nucleon degrees of freedom and creation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). This\npicture explains experimental observation that the shape of the distributions\nof pseudorapidity-density per nucleon pair of charged particles does not depend\non $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ over a large span of collision energies. We provide an\nexplanation of the scaling and connect it with the maximum rate per unit time\nof entropy production. We conclude with remarks on the hadron-parton phase\ntransition. In particular, our considerations suggest that the pseudo-rapitidy\ndensity of the produced particles per $N_{\\rm part}/2$ larger than\napproximately 1 (excluding particles from jet fragmentation) is a signature of\na QGP formation.\n"]}
