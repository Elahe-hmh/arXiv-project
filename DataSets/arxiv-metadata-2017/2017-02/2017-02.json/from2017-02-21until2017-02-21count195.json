We derive and discuss the\ngoverning Schr\\\"odinger equation and the corresponding quantum effective\npotential which is periodic and points to the helical configuration as more\nenergetically favorable as compared to the straight tube. The exhibited\nperiodicity also leads to energy band structure of pure geometrical origin.\n", "  We present an exact calculation of the effective geometry-induced quantum\npotential for a particle confined on a helicoidal ribbon. This potential leads\nto the appearance of localized states at the rim of the helicoid. In this\ngeometry the twist of the ribbon plays the role of an effective transverse\nelectric field on the surface and thus this is reminiscent of the quantum Hall\neffect.\n", "  Correlation functions in Liouville theory are meromorphic functions of the\nLiouville momenta, as is shown explicitly by the DOZZ formula for the\nthree-point function on the sphere. In a certain physical region, where a real\nclassical solution exists, the semiclassical limit of the DOZZ formula is known\nto agree with what one would expect from the action of the classical solution.\nIn this paper, we ask what happens outside of this physical region. Perhaps\nsurprisingly we find that, while in some range of the Liouville momenta the\nsemiclassical limit is associated to complex saddle points, in general\nLiouville's equations do not have enough complex-valued solutions to account\nfor the semiclassical behavior. For a full picture, we either must include\n\"solutions\" of Liouville's equations in which the Liouville field is\nmultivalued (as well as being complex-valued), or else we can reformulate\nLiouville theory as a Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions, in which the\nrequisite solutions exist in a more conventional sense. We also study the case\nof \"timelike\" Liouville theory, where we show that a proposal of Al. B.\nZamolodchikov for the exact three-point function on the sphere can be computed\nby the original Liouville path integral evaluated on a new integration cycle.\n", "  We perform studies on electric field induced diffusion limited aggregation of\nconductive particles dispersed in a non conductive medium. The bridges formed\nacross gaps between electrodes with an electric field in between due to the\naggregation mechanism provides a means to automate the correction of open\ninterconnect faults for integrated circuit application. We derive an expression\nfor the bridging time and describe the mechanics of bridge formation with the\nabove application in mind.\n", "  The D-instanton corrected hypermultiplet moduli space of type II string\ntheory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold is known in the type IIA picture\nto be determined in terms of the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants,\nthrough a twistorial construction. At the same time, in the mirror type IIB\npicture, and in the limit where only D3-D1-D(-1)-instanton corrections are\nretained, it should carry an isometric action of the S-duality group SL(2,Z).\nWe prove that this is the case in the one-instanton approximation, by\nconstructing a holomorphic action of SL(2,Z) on the linearized twistor space.\nUsing the modular invariance of the D4-D2-D0 black hole partition function, we\nshow that the standard Darboux coordinates in twistor space have modular\nanomalies controlled by period integrals of a Siegel-Narain theta series, which\ncan be canceled by a contact transformation generated by a holomorphic mock\ntheta series.\n", "  Motivated by developments in vectorlike holography, we study SU(N)\nChern-Simons theory coupled to matter fields in the fundamental representation\non various spatial manifolds. On the spatial torus T^2, we find light states at\nsmall `t Hooft coupling \\lambda=N/k, where k is the Chern-Simons level, taken\nto be large. In the free scalar theory the gaps are of order \\sqrt {\\lambda}/N\nand in the critical scalar theory and the free fermion theory they are of order\n\\lambda/N. The entropy of these states grows like N Log(k). We briefly consider\nspatial surfaces of higher genus. Based on results from pure Chern-Simons\ntheory, it appears that there are light states with entropy that grows even\nfaster, like N^2 Log(k). This is consistent with the log of the partition\nfunction on the three sphere S^3, which also behaves like N^2 Log(k). These\nlight states require bulk dynamics beyond standard Vasiliev higher spin gravity\nto explain them.\n", "  Timelike Liouville theory admits the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$ as a real saddle\npoint, about which quantum fluctuations can occur. An issue occurs when\ncomputing the expectation values of specific types of quantities, like the\ndistance between points. The problem being that the gauge redundancy of the\npath integral over metrics is not completely fixed even after fixing to\nconformal gauge by imposing $g_{\\mu\\nu} = e^{2\\b\\phi}\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}$, where\n$\\phi$ is the Liouville field and $\\tilde{g}_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a reference metric.\nThe physical metric $g_{\\mu\\nu}$, and therefore the path integral over metrics\nstill possesses a gauge redundancy due to invariance under $SL_{2}(\\mathbb{C})$\ncoordinate transformations of the reference coordinates. This zero mode of the\naction must be dealt with before a perturbative analysis can be made.\n  This paper shows that after fixing to conformal gauge, the remaining zero\nmode of the linearized Liouville action due to $SL_{2}(\\mathbb{C})$ coordinate\ntransformations can be dealt with by using standard Fadeev-Popov methods.\nEmploying the gauge condition that the \"dipole\" of the reference coordinate\nsystem is a fixed vector, and then integrating over all values of this dipole\nvector. The \"dipole\" vector referring to how coordinate area is concentrated\nabout the sphere; assuming the sphere is embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ and\ncentered at the origin, and the coordinate area is thought of as a charge\ndensity on the sphere. The vector points along the ray from the origin of\n$\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ to the direction of greatest coordinate area.\n  A Green's function is obtained and used to compute the expectation value of\nthe geodesic length between two points on the $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$ to second order\nin the Timelike Liouville coupling $\\b$. This quantity doesn't suffer from any\npower law or logarithmic divergences as a na\\\"{i}ve power counting argument\nmight suggest.\n", "  The present work deals with three alternative generalized Bekenstein-Hawking\nformulation of thermodynamical parameters namely entropy and temperature for\nthe universal thermodynamical system bounded by a horizon in the frame work of\ninhomogeneous perfect fluid Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) model of the Universe.\nFor the first choice, the first law of thermodynamics holds only for the\ntrivial de Sitter case of the LTB model while we need restriction on the\nevolution of the horizon radius for the validity of the generalized second law\nof thermodynamics. However, for the other two choices, the first law of\nthermodynamics holds with some specific (integral) form of the parameters\ninvolved but for generalized LTB models.\n", "  It is well known that most of the frequently used reversible logic gates\n(e.g., NOT, CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli, Fredkin) are self-inverse and are represented\nby square matrices that are unitary and Hermitian. However, with a simple\nminded argument, it is established that the most of the allowed reversible\ngates are non-self-inverse (unitary but non-Hermitian) in nature. It is also\nshown that the % of non-Hermitian gates increases with the dimension. For\nexample, 58.33% of the 2-bit gates, 98.10% of the 3-bit gates and 99.99% of the\n4-bit gates are non-Hermitian. As classical reversible gates are essentially\npermutation gates, above statistics is strictly valid for classical reversible\ngates, but the argument can be easily extended to include quantum gates and to\nestablish that the majority of the quantum gates are also non-self-inverse.\nFurther, the % of genuinely 2-bit reversible gates (i.e., 2-bit gates that\ncannot be decomposed as a product of two single bit gates) among all possible\ngates has been computed as 83.3%, and the applicability of this analysis in the\noptimization of circuit cost is discussed.\n", "  We review the tachyon model derived from the dynamics of a 3-brane moving in\nthe AdS5 bulk. The bulk geometry is based on the Randall-Sundrum II model\nextended to include the radion. The effective tachyon Lagrangian is modified\ndue to the back-reaction of the brane on the bulk geometry.\n", "  Wave kinetic theory for rapidly rotating flows is developed in this paper\nusing a rigorous application of multiple scales perturbation theory. The\ngoverning equations are an asymptotically reduced set of equations that are\nderived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are\napplicable for rapidly rotating flow regimes and are best suited to describe\nanisotropic dynamics of rotating flows. The independent variables of these\nequations inherently reside in a helical wave basis that is the most suitable\nbasis for inertial waves. A coupled system of equations for the two global\ninvariants: \\textit{energy} and \\textit{helicity}, is derived by extending a\nsimpler symmetrical system to the more general non-symmetrical helical case.\nThis approach of deriving the kinetic equations for helicity follows naturally\nby exploiting the symmetries in the system and is different from the\nderivations presented in earlier work of \\citet{Galtier03, Galtier14} that uses\nmultiple correlation functions to account for the asymmetry due to helicity.\nStationary solutions, including Kolmogorov solutions, for the flow invariants\nare obtained as a scaling law of the anisotropic wave numbers. The scaling law\nsolutions compare affirmatively with results from recent experimental and\nsimulation data. The theory developed in this paper pertains to the wave\ndynamics supported by an asymptotically reduced set of hydrodynamic equations\nand therefore encompasses a different dynamical regime compared to the weak\nturbulence theory presented in the work of \\citet{Galtier03, Galtier14}.\n", "  In this set of notes we simplify the formulation of the Poincare'-invariant\neffective string theory in D dimensions by adding an intrinsic metric and\nembedding its dynamics into the Polyakov formalism. We use this formalism to\nconstruct operators order by order in the inverse physical length of the\nstring, in a fully gauge-invariant framework. We use this construction to\ndiscuss universality and nonuniversality of observables up to and including\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in the long string expansion.\n", "  We present a comparative confrontation of both the Bose-Einstein Condensate\n(BEC) and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark halo models with galactic rotation\ncurves. We employ 6 High Surface Brightness (HSB), 6 Low Surface Brightness\n(LSB), and 7 dwarf galaxies with rotation curves falling into two classes. In\nthe first class rotational velocities increase with radius over the observed\nrange.The BEC and NFW models give comparable fits for HSB and LSB galaxies of\nthis type, while for dwarf galaxies the fit is significantly better with the\nBEC model. In the second class the rotational velocity of HSB and LSB galaxies\nexhibits long flat plateaus, resulting in better fit with the NFW model for HSB\ngalaxies and comparable fits for LSB galaxies. We conclude that due to its\ncentral density cusp avoidance the BEC model fits better dwarf galaxy dark\nmatter distribution. Nevertheless it suffers from sharp cutoff in larger\ngalaxies, where the NFW model performs better. The investigated galaxy sample\nobeys the Tully-Fisher relation, including the particular characteristics\nexhibited by dwarf galaxies. In both models the fitting enforces a relation\nbetween dark matter parameters: the characteristic density and the\ncorresponding characteristic distance scale with an inverse power.\n", "  In this paper, we study the M5-brane configurations in AdS$_4 \\times\nQ^{1,1,1}$ spacetime. We consider the configurations with an AdS$_2$ factor\nembedding into AdS$_4$, and manage to construct two solutions, which could be\ndual to line defects in the boundary gauge theory. Moreover we discuss their\nBPS nature and find that neither of them is supersymmetric. We show that the\nM5-brane with a R$_t$ or an AdS$_3$ factor found before is half-BPS.\n", "  Classical mathematics (involving such notions as infinitely small/large and\ncontinuity) is usually treated as fundamental while finite mathematics is\ntreated as inferior which is used only in special applications. We first argue\nthat the situation is the opposite: classical mathematics is only a degenerate\nspecial case of finite one and finite mathematics is more pertinent for\ndescribing nature than standard one. Then we describe results of a quantum\ntheory based on finite mathematics. Implications for foundation of mathematics\nare discussed.\n", "  We investigate the cooling of neutron stars with relativistic and\nnon-relativistic models of dense nuclear matter. We focus on the effects of\nuncertainties originated from the nuclear models, the composition of elements\nin the envelope region, and the formation of superfluidity in the core and the\ncrust of neutron stars. Discovery of $2 M_\\odot$ neutron stars PSR J1614-2230\nand PSR J0343+0432 has triggered the revival of stiff nuclear equation of state\nat high densities. In the mean time, observation of a neutron star in\nCassiopeia A for more than 10 years has provided us with very accurate data for\nthe thermal evolution of neutron stars. Both mass and temperature of neutron\nstars depend critically on the equation of state of nuclear matter, so we first\nsearch for nuclear models that satisfy the constraints from mass and\ntemperature simultaneously within a reasonable range. With selected models, we\nexplore the effects of element composition in the evenlope region, and the\nexistence of superfluidity in the core and the crust of neutron stars. Due to\nuncertainty in the composition of particles in the envelope region we obtain a\nrange of cooling curves that can cover substantial region of observation data.\n", "  We discuss the differences between two well-studied and related\nphenomena---coherent population trapping (CPT) and electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT). Many differences between the two---such as the effect of\npower in the beams, detuning of the beams from resonance, and the use of vapor\ncells filled with buffer gas---are demonstrated experimentally. The experiments\nare done using magnetic sublevels of the $ 1 \\rightarrow 1 $ transition in the\nD$_2$ line of $^{87}$Rb.\n", "  The CRESST experiment (Cryogenic Rare Event Search with Superconducting\nThermometers) searches for dark matter via the phonon and light signals of\nelastic scattering processes in scintillating crystals. The discrimination\nbetween a possible dark matter signal and background is based on the light\nyield. We present a new method for evaluating the two characteristics of a\nphonon/light detector module that determine how much of the deposited energy is\nconverted to scintillation light and how efficiently a module detects the\nproduced light. In contrast to former approaches with dedicated setups, we\ndeveloped a method which allows us to use data taken with the cryogenic setup,\nduring a dark matter search phase. In this way, we accounted for the entire\nprocess that occurs in a detector module, and obtained information on the light\nemission of the crystal as well as information on the performance of the module\n(light transport and detection). We found that with the detectors operated in\nCRESST-II phase 1, about 20% of the produced scintillation light is detected. A\npart of the light is likely absorbed by creating meta-stable excitations in the\nscintillating crystals. The light not detected is not absorbed entirely, as an\nadditional light detector can help to increase the fraction of detected light.\n", "  We consider hard-core bosons on the kagome lattice in the presence of short\nrange repulsive interactions and focus particularly on the filling factor 1/3.\nIn the strongly interacting limit, the low energy excitations can be described\nby the quantum fully packed loop coverings on the triangular lattice. Using a\ncombination of tensor-product state based methods and exact diagonalization\ntechniques, we show that the system has an extended Z2 topological liquid phase\nas well as a lattice nematic phase. The latter breaks lattice rotational\nsymmetry. By tuning appropriate parameters in the model, we study the quantum\nphase transition between the topological and the symmetry broken phases. We\nconstruct the critical theory for this transition using a mapping to an Ising\ngauge theory that predicts the transition to belong to the O(3) universality\nclass.\n", "  The crustal fraction of moment of inertia in neutron stars is calculated\nusing $\\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter obtained from density dependent M3Y\neffective interaction. The transition density, pressure and proton fraction at\nthe inner edge separating the liquid core from the solid crust of the neutron\nstars determined from the thermodynamic stability conditions are found to be\n$\\rho_t=$ 0.0938 fm$^{-3}$, P$_t=$ 0.5006 MeV fm$^{-3}$ and $x_{p(t)}=$ 0.0308,\nrespectively. The crustal fraction of the moment of inertia can be extracted\nfrom studying pulsar glitches and is most sensitive to the pressure as well as\ndensity at the transition from the crust to the core. These results for\npressure and density at core-crust transition together with the observed\nminimum crustal fraction of the total moment of inertia provide a new limit for\nthe radius of the Vela pulsar: $R \\geq 4.10 + 3.36 M/M_\\odot$ kms.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmion, vortex-like swirling topologically stable spin\nconfigurations, is appealing as information carrier for future nanoelectronics,\nowing to the stability, small size and extremely low driving current density.\nOne of the most promising applications of skyrmion is to build racetrack memory\n(RM). Compared to domain wall-based RM (DW-RM), skyrmion-based RM (Sky-RM)\npossesses quite a few benefits in terms of energy, density and speed etc. Until\nnow, the fundamental behaviors, including nucleation/annihilation, motion and\ndetection of skyrmion have been intensively investigated. However, one\nindispensable function, i.e., pinning/depinning of skyrmion still remains an\nopen question and has to be addressed before applying skyrmion for RM.\nFurthermore, Current research mainly focuses on physical investigations,\nwhereas the electrical design and evaluation are still lacking. In this work,\nwe aim to promote the development of Sky-RM from fundamental physics to\nrealistic electronics. First, we investigate the pinning/depinning\ncharacteristics of skyrmion in a nanotrack with the voltage-controlled magnetic\nanisotropy (VCMA) effect. Then, we propose a compact model and design framework\nof Sky-RM for electrical evaluation. This work completes the elementary memory\nfunctionality of Sky-RM and fills the technical gap between the physicists and\nelectronic engineers, making a significant step forward for the development of\nSky-RM.\n", "  Quantum coherence is the outcome of the superposition principle. Recently, it\nhas been theorized as a quantum resource, and is the premise of quantum\ncorrelations in multipartite systems. It is therefore interesting to study the\ncoherence content and its distribution in a multipartite quantum system. In\nthis work, we show analytically as well as numerically the reciprocity between\ncoherence and mixedness of a quantum state. We find that this trade-off is a\ngeneral feature in the sense that it is true for large spectra of measures of\ncoherence and of mixedness. We also study the distribution of coherence in\nmultipartite systems by looking at monogamy-type relation--which we refer to as\nadditivity relation--between coherences of different parts of the system. We\nshow that for the Dicke states, while the normalized measures of coherence\nviolate the additivity relation, the unnormalized ones satisfy the same.\n", "  A central question in the high temperature cuprate superconductors is the\nfate of the parent Mott insulator upon charge doping. Here we use scanning\ntunneling microscopy to investigate the local electronic structure of lightly\ndoped cuprate in the antiferromagnetic insulating regime. We show that the\ndoped charge induces a spectral weight transfer from the high energy Hubbard\nbands to the low energy in-gap states. With increasing doping, a V-shaped\ndensity of state suppression occurs at the Fermi level, which is accompanied by\nthe emergence of checkerboard charge order. The new STM perspective revealed\nhere is the cuprates first become a charge ordered insulator upon doping.\nSubsequently, with further doping, Fermi surface and high temperature\nsuperconductivity grow out of it.\n", "  We study inclusive $\\chi_{cJ}$ production with definite polarizations in\npolarized proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 200 GeV and 500 GeV at RHIC\nby using non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) color-octet mechanism. We present results\nof rapidity distribution of $\\chi_{c0}$, $\\chi_{c1}$ and $\\chi_{c2}$ production\nwith specific polarizations in polarized p-p collisions at RHIC within the\nPHENIX detector acceptance range. We also present the corresponding results for\nthe spin asymmetries.\n", "  I introduce the notion of a parity horizon, and show that many simple\nsolutions of shape dynamics possess them. I show that the event horizons of the\nknown asymptotically flat black hole solutions of shape dynamics are parity\nhorizons and that this notion of parity implies that these horizons possess a\nnotion of CPT invariance that can in some cases be extended to the solution as\na whole. I present three new solutions of shape dynamics with parity horizons\nand find that not only event horizons become parity horizons in shape dynamics,\nbut observer-dependent horizons and Cauchy horizons do as well. The fact that\nCauchy horizons become (singular) parity horizons suggests a general chronology\nprotection mechanism in shape dynamics that prevents the formation of closed\ntime-like curves.\n", "  Theoretical understanding of the observed jet quenching measurements at RHIC\nand LHC is challenging in QCD because it requires understanding of parton to\nhadron fragmentation function in non-equilibrium QCD. In this paper, by using\nclosed-time path integral formalism, we derive the gauge invariant definition\nof the gluon to hadron fragmentation function in non-equilibrium QCD which is\nconsistent with factorization theorem in non-equilibrium QCD from first\nprinciples.\n", "  We demonstrate dual-gated $p$-type field-effect transistors (FETs) based on\nfew-layer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) using high work-function platinum\nsource/drain contacts, and a hexagonal boron nitride top-gate dielectric. A\ndevice topology with contacts underneath the WSe$_2$ results in $p$-FETs with\n$I_{ON}$/$I_{OFF}$ ratios exceeding 10$^7$, and contacts that remain Ohmic down\nto cryogenic temperatures. The output characteristics show current saturation\nand gate tunable negative differential resistance. The devices show intrinsic\nhole mobilities around 140 cm$^2$/Vs at room temperature, and approaching 4,000\ncm$^2$/Vs at 2 K. Temperature-dependent transport measurements show a\nmetal-insulator transition, with an insulating phase at low densities, and a\nmetallic phase at high densities. The mobility shows a strong temperature\ndependence consistent with phonon scattering, and saturates at low\ntemperatures, possibly limited by Coulomb scattering, or defects.\n", "  The notion of a topological phase of an insulator is based on the concept of\nhomotopy between Hamiltonians. It therefore depends on the choice of a\ntopological space to which the Hamiltonians belong. We advocate that this space\nshould be the $C^*$-algebra of observables. We relate the symmetries of\ninsulators to graded real structures on the observable algebra and classify the\ntopological phases using van Daele's formulation of $K$-theory. This is related\nbut not identical to Thiang's recent approach to classify topological phases by\n$K$-groups in Karoubi's formulation.\n", "  Physical constraints make it challenging to implement and control many-body\ninteractions. For this reason, designing quantum information processes with\nHamiltonians consisting of only one- and two-local terms is a worthwhile\nchallenge. Enabling error suppression with two-local Hamiltonians is\nparticularly challenging. A no-go theorem of Marvian and Lidar [Physical Review\nLetters 113(26), 260504 (2014)] demonstrates that, even allowing particles with\nhigh Hilbert-space dimension, it is impossible to protect quantum information\nfrom single-site errors by encoding in the ground subspace of any Hamiltonian\ncontaining only commuting two-local terms. Here, we get around this no-go\nresult by encoding in the ground subspace of a Hamiltonian consisting of\nnon-commuting two-local terms arising from the gauge operators of a subsystem\ncode. Specifically, we show how to protect stored quantum information against\nsingle-qubit errors using a Hamiltonian consisting of sums of the gauge\ngenerators from Bacon-Shor codes [Physical Review A 73(1), 012340 (2006)] and\ngeneralized-Bacon-Shor code [Physical Review A 83(1), 012320 (2011)]. Our\nresults imply that non-commuting two-local Hamiltonians have more\nerror-suppressing power than commuting two-local Hamiltonians. While far from\nproviding full fault tolerance, this approach improves the robustness\nachievable in near-term implementable quantum storage and adiabatic quantum\ncomputations, reducing the number of higher-order terms required to encode\ncommonly used adiabatic Hamiltonians such as the Ising Hamiltonians common in\nadiabatic quantum optimization and quantum annealing.\n", "  We consider a family of quantum channels characterized by the fact that\ncertain (in general nonorthogonal) Pure states at the channel entrance are\nmapped to (tensor) Products of Pure states (PPP, hence \"pcubed\") at the\ncomplementary outputs (the main output and the \"environment\") of the channel.\nThe pcubed construction, a reformulation of the twisted-diagonal procedure by\nM. M Wolf and D. Perez-Garcia, [Phys. Rev. A 75, 012303 (2007)], can be used to\nproduce a large class of degradable quantum channels; degradable channels are\nof interest because their quantum capacities are easy to calculate. Several\nknown types of degradable channels are either pcubed channels, or subchannels\n(employing a subspace of the channel entrance), or continuous limits of pcubed\nchannels. The pcubed construction also yields channels which are neither\ndegradable nor antidegradable (i.e., the complement of a degradable channel); a\nparticular example of a qutrit channel of this type is studied in some detail.\nDetermining whether a pcubed channel is degradable or antidegradable or neither\nis quite straightforward given the pure input and output states that\ncharacterize the channel. Conjugate degradable pcubed channels are always\ndegradable.\n", "  We study the coalescence of two bound energy eigenstates embedded in the\ncontinuous spectrum of a real Hamiltonian $H[4]$ and the singular point\nproduced by this coalescence. At the singular point, the two unnormalized Jost\neigenfunctions are no longer linearly independent but coalesce to give rise to\na bound state eigenfunction embedded in the continuum. We disturb the potential\n$V[4]$ by means of a truncation, this perturbation breaks the singular point in\ntwo resonances. The phase shift shows a jump of magnitude $2\\pi$ and the shape\nof the cross section shows two inverted peaks, this behaviour is due to the\ninterference between the two nearly degenerate resonances and the background\ncomponent of the Jost function.\n", "  Asteroids that could collide with the Earth are listed on the publicly\navailable Near-Earth object (NEO) hazard web sites maintained by the US and\nEuropean space agencies (NASA and ESA). The impact probability distribution of\n69 potentially threatening NEOs from these lists that produce 261 dynamically\ndistinct impact instances, or Virtual Impactors (VIs), were calculated using\nthe Asteroid Risk Mitigation and Optimization Research (ARMOR) tool in\nconjunction with OrbFit. ARMOR projected the impact probability of each VI onto\nthe surface of the Earth as a spatial probability distribution. The projection\nconsiders orbit solution accuracy and the global impact probability. The method\nof ARMOR is introduced and the tool is validated against two asteroid-Earth\ncollision cases with objects 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA. In the analysis, the natural\ndistribution of impact corridors is contrasted against the impact probability\ndistribution to evaluate the distributions conformity with the uniform impact\ndistribution assumption. The distribution of impact corridors is based on the\nNEO population and orbital mechanics. The analysis shows that the distribution\nof impact corridors matches the common assumption of uniform impact\ndistribution and the result extends the evidence base for the uniform\nassumption from qualitative analysis of historic impact events into the future\nin a quantitative way. This finding is confirmed in a parallel analysis of\nimpact points belonging to a synthetic population of 10006 VIs. Taking into\naccount the impact probabilities introduced significant variation into the\nresults and the impact probability distribution, consequently, deviates\nmarkedly from uniformity. The concept of impact probabilities is a product of\nthe asteroid observation and orbit determination technique and, thus,\nrepresents a man-made component that is largely disconnected from natural\nprocesses.\n", "  We consider the typical asymptotic behaviour of cellular automata of higher\ndimension (greater than 2). That is, we take an initial configuration at random\naccording to a Bernoulli (i.i.d) probability measure, iterate some cellular\nautomaton, and consider the (set of) limit probability measure(s) as time tends\nto infinity. In this paper, we prove that limit measures that can be reached by\nhigher-dimensional cellular automata are completely characterised by\ncomputability conditions, as in the one-dimensional case. This implies that\ncellular automata have the same variety and complexity of typical asymptotic\nbehaviours as Turing machines, and that any nontrivial property in this regard\nis undecidable (Rice-type theorem). These results extend to connected sets of\nlimit measures and Ces\\`aro mean convergence. The main tool is the\nimplementation of arbitrary computation in the time evolution of a cellular\nautomata in such a way that it emerges and self-organises from a random\nconfiguration.\n", "  In this paper, we study the mean field quantum fluctuation dynamics for a\nsystem of infinitely many fermions with delta pair interactions in the vicinity\nof an equilibrium solution (the Fermi sea) at zero temperature, in dimensions\n$d=2,3$, and prove global well-posedness of the corresponding Cauchy problem.\nOur work extends some of the recent important results obtained by M. Lewin and\nJ. Sabin, who addressed this problem for more regular pair interactions.\n", "  Quantum spin liquids may be considered \"quantum disordered\" ground states of\nspin systems, in which zero point fluctuations are so strong that they prevent\nconventional magnetic long range order. More interestingly, quantum spin\nliquids are prototypical examples of ground states with massive many-body\nentanglement, of a degree sufficient to render these states distinct phases of\nmatter. Their highly entangled nature imbues quantum spin liquids with unique\nphysical aspects, such as non-local excitations, topological properties, and\nmore. In this review, we discuss the nature of such phases and their properties\nbased on paradigmatic models and general arguments, and introduce theoretical\ntechnology such as gauge theory and partons that are conveniently used in the\nstudy of quantum spin liquids. An overview is given of the different types of\nquantum spin liquids and the models and theories used to describe them. We also\nprovide a guide to the current status of experiments to study quantum spin\nliquids, and to the diverse probes used therein.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmion holds promise as information carriers in the\nnext-generation memory and logic devices, owing to the topological stability,\nsmall size and extremely low current needed to drive it. One of the most\npotential applications of skyrmion is to design racetrack memory (RM), named\nSk-RM, instead of utilizing domain wall (DW). However, current studies face\nsome key design challenges, e.g., skyrmion manipulation, data representation\nand synchronization etc. To address these challenges, we propose here a\ncomplementary Sk-RM structure with voltage manipulation. Functionality and\nperformance of the proposed design are investigated with micromagnetic\nsimulations.\n", "  This paper establishes several converse bounds on the private transmission\ncapabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds\nfirmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum\nmethod for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local\noperations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum\nprivacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach\nhas previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,\nincluding the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.\nHere we use this approach along with a \"privacy test\" to establish a general\nmeta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of\napplications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's\nrelative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private\ncommunication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to\nsecond-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private\ncommunication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private\ncommunication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by\nunlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for\nestablishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols\nconducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several\nchannels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds\non the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic\nchannels.\n", "  We develop an instantonic calculus to derive an analytical expression for the\nthermally-assisted tunneling decay rate of a metastable state in a fully\nconnected quantum spin model. The tunneling decay problem can be mapped onto\nthe Kramers escape problem of a classical random dynamical field. This\ndynamical field is simulated efficiently by path integral Quantum Monte Carlo\n(QMC). We show analytically that the exponential scaling with the number of\nspins of the thermally-assisted quantum tunneling rate and the escape rate of\nthe QMC process are identical. We relate this effect to the existence of a\ndominant instantonic tunneling path. The instanton trajectory is described by\nnonlinear dynamical mean-field theory equations for a single site magnetization\nvector, which we solve exactly. Finally, we derive scaling relations for the\n\"spiky\" barrier shape when the spin tunnelling and QMC rates scale polynomially\nwith the number of spins $N$ while a purely classical over-the-barrier\nactivation rate scales exponentially with $N$.\n", "  We demonstrate the growth of thin films of molybdenum ditelluride and\nmolybdenum diselenide on sapphire substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. In-situ\nstructural and chemical analyses reveal stoichiometric layered film growth with\natomically smooth surface morphologies. Film growth along the (001) direction\nis confirmed by X-ray diffraction, and the crystalline nature of growth in the\n2H phase is evident from Raman spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy\nis used to confirm the layered film structure and hexagonal arrangement of\nsurface atoms. Temperature dependent electrical measurements show an insulating\nbehavior which agrees well with a two-dimensional variable-range hopping model,\nsuggesting that transport in these films is dominated by localized\ncharge-carrier states.\n", "  Several approximate equalities among the matrix elements of CKM and PMNS\nimply that hidden symmetries may exist and be common for both quark and\nneutrino sectors. The CP phase of the CKM matrix ($\\delta_{\\rm CKM}$) is\ninvolved in these equalities and can be investigated when these equalities turn\ninto several equations. As we substitute those experimentally measured values\nof the three mixing angles into the equations for quarks, it is noted that one\nof the equations which holds exactly has a solution $\\delta_{\\rm\nCKM}=68.95^\\circ$. That value accords with $(69.1^{+2.02}_{-3.85})^\\circ$\ndetermined from available data. Generalizing the scenario to the lepton sector,\nthe same equality determines the leptonic CP phase $\\delta_{\\rm PMNS}$ to be $\n276.10^\\circ$. Thus we predict the value of $\\delta_{\\rm PMNS}$ from the\nequation. So far there is no direct measurement on $\\delta_{\\rm PMNS}$ yet, but\na recent analysis based on the neutrino oscillation data prefers the phase\nclose to $270^\\circ$.\n", "  Motivated by the search for flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) top quark\ndecays at the LHC, we calculate rare Higgs three body decay $H\\rightarrow Wbc$\ninduced by top-Higgs FCNC coupling in the littlest Higgs model with\nT-parity(LHT). We find that the branching ratios of $H\\rightarrow Wbc$ in the\nLHT model can reach $\\mathcal O(10^{-7})$ in the allowed parameter space.\n", "  We present a novel algorithm, FAST-PT, for performing convolution or\nmode-coupling integrals that appear in nonlinear cosmological perturbation\ntheory. The algorithm uses several properties of gravitational structure\nformation -- the locality of the dark matter equations and the scale invariance\nof the problem -- as well as Fast Fourier Transforms to describe the input\npower spectrum as a superposition of power laws. This yields extremely fast\nperformance, enabling mode-coupling integral computations fast enough to embed\nin Monte Carlo Markov Chain parameter estimation. We describe the algorithm and\ndemonstrate its application to calculating nonlinear corrections to the matter\npower spectrum, including one-loop standard perturbation theory and the\nrenormalization group approach. We also describe our public code (in Python) to\nimplement this algorithm, including the applications described here.\n", "  Pathogens can spread epidemically through populations. Beneficial contagions,\nsuch as viruses that enhance host survival or technological innovations that\nimprove quality of life, also have the potential to spread epidemically. How do\nthe dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics differ from those of\ndetrimental epidemics? We investigate this question using three theoretical\napproaches. First, in the context of population genetics, we show that a\nhorizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness, such as viral DNA,\nspreads superexponentially through a population, more quickly than a beneficial\nmutation. Second, in the context of behavioral epidemiology, we show that\ninfections that cause increased connectivity lead to superexponential fixation\nin the population. Third, in the context of dynamic social networks, we find\nthat preferences for increased global infection accelerate spread and produce\nsuperexponential fixation, but preferences for local assortativity halt\nepidemics by disconnecting the infected from the susceptible. We conclude that\nthe dynamics of beneficial biological and social epidemics are characterized by\nthe rapid spread of beneficial elements, which is facilitated in biological\nsystems by horizontal transmission and in social systems by active spreading\nbehavior of infected individuals.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a general toric wall crossing on genus zero\nGromov-Witten theory. Given two complete toric orbifolds $X_+$ and $X_-$\nrelated by wall crossing under variation of GIT, we prove that their respective\n$I$-functions are related by linear transformation and asymptotic expansion. We\nuse this comparison to deduce a similar result for birational complete\nintersections in $X_+$ and $X_-$. This extends the work of the previous authors\nin Acosta-Shoemaker to the case of complete intersections in toric varieties,\nand generalizes some of the results of Coates-Iritani-Jiang on the crepant\ntransformation conjecture to the setting of non-zero discrepancy.\n", "  When a light scalar dilaton $\\sigma$ and the light-quark vector mesons\n$V=(\\rho,\\omega)$ are incorporated into an effective scale-invariant hidden\nlocal symmetric (sHLS) Lagrangian, scale symmetry for $\\sigma$ and local gauge\nsymmetry for $V$, both invisible in QCD in the vacuum, arise as emergent\nsymmetries at a density above $n_{1/2}\\sim 2n_0$, a phenomenon highly relevant\nfor massive compact stars, hitherto unobserved in standard chiral pertubative\napproaches. What takes place involves a topology change at $n_{1/2}$, and as\nthe density increases beyond, (1) exposes a parity doubling in the nucleon\nstructure, (2) triggers drastic change in the nuclear tensor force and (3)\nstiffens the nuclear symmetry energy as density exceeds $n_{1/2}$. It results\nfrom an intricate interplay between the two hidden symmetries that the $\\rho$\nmeson moves toward the vector manifestation (VM) fixed point where\n$m_\\rho\\rightarrow 0$ and the velocity of sound $v_s$ in the dense matter\napproaches the conformal symmetry value $v_s/c=\\sqrt{1/3}$, indicating a\npresence of an infrared fixed point at which the dilaton mass vanishes.\n", "  We present an in-depth study of the spin-orbit (SO) interactions occurring in\ninversion-asymmetric two-dimensional hole gases at semiconductor\nheterointerfaces. We focus on common semiconductors such as GaAs, InAs, InSb,\nGe, and Si. We develop a semi-analytical variational method to quantify SO\ninteractions, accounting for both structure inversion asymmetry (SIA) and bulk\ninversion asymmetry (BIA). Under certain circumstances, using the\nSchrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation, the dispersion of the ground state heavy\nhole subbands can be written as $E(k) = A k^2 - B k^4 \\pm C k^3$ where $A$,\n$B$, and $C$ are material- and structure-dependent coefficients. We provide a\nsimple method of calculating the parameters $A$, $B$, and $C$, yet demonstrate\nthat the simple SW approximation leading to a SIA (Rashba) spin splitting\n$\\propto k^3$ frequently breaks down. We determine the parameter regimes at\nwhich this happens for the materials above and discuss a convenient\nsemi-analytical method to obtain the correct spin splitting, effective masses,\nFermi level, and subband occupancy, together with their dependence on the\ncharge density, dopant type, and dopant concentration for both inversion and\naccumulation layers. Our results are in good agreement with fully numerical\ncalculations as well as with experimental findings. They suggest that a naive\napplication of the simple cubic Rashba model is of limited use in common\nheterostructures, as well as quantum dots. Finally, we find that for the single\nheterojunctions studied here the magnitudes of BIA terms are always much\nsmaller than those of SIA terms.\n", "  We study the rigidity properties of Grassmannian frames: basis-like sets of\nunit vectors that correspond to optimal Grassmannian line packings. It is known\nthat Grassmannian frames characterized by the Welch bound must satisfy the\nrestrictive geometric and spectral conditions of being both equiangular and\ntight; however, less is known about the necessary properties of other types of\nGrassmannian frames. We examine explicit low-dimensional examples of\northoplectic Grassmannian frames and conclude that, in general, the necessary\nconditions for the existence of Grassmannian frames can be much less\nrestrictive. In particular, we exhibit a pair of $5$-element Grassmannian\nframes in $\\mathbb C^2$ manifesting with differently sized angle sets and\ndifferent reconstructive properties (ie, only one of them is a tight frame).\nThis illustrates the complexity of the line packing problem, as there are cases\nwhere a solution may coexist with another solution of a different geometric and\nspectral character. Nevertheless, we find that these \"twin\" instances still\nrespect a certain rigidity, as there is a necessary trade-off between their\ntightness properties and the cardinalities of their angle sets. The proof of\nthis depends on the observation that the traceless embedding of Conway, Hardin\nand Sloane sends the vectors of a unit-norm, tight frame to a zero-summing set\non a higher dimensional sphere. In addition, we review some of the known bounds\nfor characterizing optimal line packings in $\\mathbb C^2$ and discuss several\nexamples of Grassmannian frames achieving them.\n", "  We propose a total measure of multi-particle quantum correlation in a system\nof N two-level atoms (N qubits). We construct a parameter that encompasses all\npossible quantum correlations among N two-level atoms in arbitrary symmetric\npure states and define its numerical value to be the total measure of the net\natom-atom correlations. We use that parameter to quantify the total quantum\ncorrelations in atomic Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states, which are generated by the\ndispersive interaction in a cavity. We study the variation of the net amount of\nquantum correlation as we vary the number of atoms from N=2 to N=100 and obtain\nsome interesting results. We also study the variation of the net correlation,\nfor fixed interaction time, as we increase the number of atoms in the excited\nstate of the initial system, and notice some interesting features. We also\nobserve the behaviour of the net quantum correlation as we continuously\nincrease the interaction time, for the general state of N two-level atoms in a\ndispersive cavity.\n", "  In the present paper, the minimal investment risk for a portfolio\noptimization problem with imposed budget and investment concentration\nconstraints is considered using replica analysis. Since the minimal investment\nrisk is influenced by the investment concentration constraint (as well as the\nbudget constraint), it is intuitive that the minimal investment risk for the\nproblem with an investment concentration constraint be larger than that without\nthe constraint (that is, with only the budget constraint). Moreover, a\nnumerical experiment shows the effectiveness of our proposed analysis.\n", "  In the task of discriminating between nonorthogonal quantum states from\nmultiple copies, the key parameters are the error probability and the resources\n(number of copies) used. Previous studies have considered the task of\nminimizing the average error probability for fixed resources. Here we introduce\na new state discrimination task: minimizing the average resources for a fixed\nadmissible error probability. We show that this new task is not performed\noptimally by previously known strategies, and derive and experimentally test a\ndetection scheme that performs better.\n", "  Irreversible aggregation is an archetypal example of a system driven far from\nequilibrium by sources and sinks of a conserved quantity (mass). The source is\na steady input of monomers and the evaporation of colliding particles with a\nsmall probability is the sink. Using exact and heuristic analyses, we find a\nuniversal regime and two distinct non-universal regimes distinguished by the\nrelative importance of mergers between small and large particles. At the\nboundary between the regimes we find an analogue of the logarithmic correction\nconjectured by Kraichnan for two-dimensional turbulence.\n", "  Electromagnetic scattering in accelerating reference frames inspires a\nvariety of phenomena, requiring employment of general relativity for their\ndescription. While the quasi-stationary field analysis could be applied to\nslowly-accelerating bodies as a first-order approximation, the scattering\nproblem remains fundamentally nonlinear in boundary conditions, giving rise to\nmultiple frequency generation (micro-Doppler shifts). Here a frequency comb,\ngenerated by an axially rotating subwavelength (cm-range) wire and split ring\nresonator (SRR), is analyzed theoretically and observed experimentally by\nilluminating the system with a 2GHz carrier wave. Highly accurate lock in\ndetection scheme enables factorization of the carrier and observation of more\nthan ten peaks in a comb. The Hallen integral equation is employed for deriving\nthe currents induced on the scatterer at rest and a set of coordinate\ntransformations, connecting laboratory and rotating frames, is applied in order\nto predict the spectral positions and amplitudes of the frequency comb peaks.\nUnique spectral signature of micro-Doppler shifts could enable resolving an\ninternal structure of the scatterers and mapping their accelerations in space,\nwhich is valuable for a variety of applications spanning from targets\nidentification to stellar radiometry.\n", "  We consider the question of whether the leading contribution to the\nentanglement entropy in holographic CFTs is truly given by the expectation\nvalue of a linear operator as is suggested by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. We\ninvestigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the\nreplica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct\ngeometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expectation value of the\narea operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the\nnumber of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the\ncentral charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the\nchoice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density\nmatrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the\nhomology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology\nconstraint is not a linear property in the CFT. We also discuss the existence\nof entropy operators in general systems with a large number of degrees of\nfreedom.\n", "  We study the performance of the D-Wave 2X quantum annealing machine on\nsystems with well-controlled ground-state degeneracy. While obtaining the\nground state of a spin-glass benchmark instance represents a difficult task,\nthe gold standard for any optimization algorithm or machine is to sample all\nsolutions that minimize the Hamiltonian with more or less equal probability.\nOur results show that while naive transverse-field quantum annealing on the\nD-Wave 2X device can find the ground-state energy of the problems, it is not\nwell suited in identifying all degenerate ground-state configurations\nassociated to a particular instance. Even worse, some states are exponentially\nsuppressed, in agreement with previous studies on toy model problems [New J.\nPhys. 11, 073021 (2009)]. These results suggest that more complex driving\nHamiltonians are needed in future quantum annealing machines to ensure a fair\nsampling of the ground-state manifold.\n", "  In this work, we have studied the possibility of setting up Bell's inequality\nviolating experiment in the context of cosmology, based on the basic principles\nof quantum mechanics. First we start with the physical motivation of\nimplementing the Bell's inequality violation in the context of cosmology. Then\nto set up the cosmological Bell violating test experiment we introduce a model\nindependent theoretical framework using which we have studied the creation of\nnew massive particles by implementing the WKB approximation method for the\nscalar fluctuations in presence of additional time dependent mass contribution.\nNext using the background scalar fluctuation in presence of new time dependent\nmass contribution, we explicitly compute the expression for the one point and\ntwo point correlation functions. Furthermore, using the results for one point\nfunction we introduce a new theoretical cosmological parameter which can be\nexpressed in terms of the other known inflationary observables and can also be\ntreated as a future theoretical probe to break the degeneracy amongst various\nmodels of inflation. Additionally, we also fix the scale of inflation in a\nmodel independent way without any prior knowledge of primordial gravitational\nwaves. Next, we also comment on the technicalities of measurements from isospin\nbreaking interactions and the future prospects of newly introduced massive\nparticles in cosmological Bell violating test experiment. Further, we cite a\nprecise example of this set up applicable in the context of string theory\nmotivated axion monodromy model. Then we comment on the explicit role of\ndecoherence effect and high spin on cosmological Bell violating test\nexperiment. In fine, we provide a theoretical bound on the heavy particle mass\nparameter for scalar fields, graviton and other high spin fields from our\nproposed setup.\n", "  The $M$-dimensional unitary matrix $S(E)$, which describes scattering of\nwaves, is a strongly fluctuating function of the energy for complex systems\nsuch as ballistic cavities, whose geometry induces chaotic ray dynamics. Its\nstatistical behaviour can be expressed by means of correlation functions of the\nkind $\\left \\langle S_{ij}(E+\\epsilon)S^\\dag_{pq}(E-\\epsilon)\\right\\rangle$,\nwhich have been much studied within the random matrix approach. In this work,\nwe consider correlations involving an arbitrary number of matrix elements and\nexpress them as infinite series in $1/M$, whose coefficients are rational\nfunctions of $\\epsilon$. From a mathematical point of view, this may be seen as\na generalization of the Weingarten functions of circular ensembles.\n", "  We propose a scheme for digital quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories\nwith dynamical fermions. Using a layered optical lattice with ancilla atoms\nthat can move and interact with the other atoms (simulating the physical\ndegrees of freedom), we obtain a stroboscopic dynamics which yields the\nfour-body plaquette interactions, arising in models with $2+1$ and higher\ndimensions, without the use of perturbation theory. As an example we show how\nto simulate a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ model in $2+1$ dimensions.\n", "  We analyze the inflationary scenario based on the tachyon field coupled with\nthe radion of the second Randall-Sundrum model (RSII). The tachyon Lagrangian\nis derived from the dynamics of a 3-brane moving in the five dimensional bulk.\nThe AdS$_5$ geometry of the bulk is extended to include the radion. Using the\nHamiltonian formalism we find four nonlinear field equations supplemented by\nthe modified Friedmann equations of the RSII braneworld cosmology. After a\nsuitable rescaling we reduce the parameters of our model to only one free\nparameter related to the brane tension and the AdS$_5$ curvature. We solve the\nequations numerically assuming a reasonably wide range of initial conditions\ndetermined by physical considerations. Varying the free parameter and initial\nconditions we confront our results with the Planck 2015 data.\n", "  Reliable transport of magnetic skyrmions is required for any future\nskyrmion-based information processing devices. Here we present a micromagnetic\nstudy of the in-plane current-driven motion of a skyrmion in a ferromagnetic\nnanotrack with spatially sinusoidally varying Gilbert damping and/or\nnon-adiabatic spin-transfer torque coefficients. It is found that the skyrmion\nmoves in a sinusoidal pattern as a result of the spatially varying Gilbert\ndamping and/or non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque in the nanotrack, which could\nprevent the destruction of the skyrmion caused by the skyrmion Hall effect. The\nresults provide a guide for designing and developing the skyrmion transport\nchannel in skyrmion-based spintronic applications.\n", "  Instantaneous quantum computing is a sub-universal quantum complexity class,\nwhose circuits have proven to be hard to simulate classically in the\nDiscrete-Variable (DV) realm. We extend this proof to the Continuous-Variable\n(CV) domain by using squeezed states and homodyne detection, and by exploring\nthe properties of post-selected circuits. In order to treat post-selection in\nCVs we consider finitely-resolved homodyne detectors, corresponding to a\nrealistic scheme based on discrete probability distributions of the measurement\noutcomes. The unavoidable errors stemming from the use of finitely squeezed\nstates are suppressed through a qubit-into-oscillator GKP encoding of quantum\ninformation, which was previously shown to enable fault-tolerant CV quantum\ncomputation. Finally, we show that, in order to render post-selected\ncomputational classes in CVs meaningful, a logarithmic scaling of the squeezing\nparameter with the circuit size is necessary, translating into a polynomial\nscaling of the input energy.\n", "  We propose a general scheme for a digital construction of lattice gauge\ntheories with dynamical fermions. In this method, the four-body interactions\narising in models with $2+1$ dimensions and higher, are obtained\nstroboscopically, through a sequence of two-body interactions with ancillary\ndegrees of freedom. This yields stronger interactions than the ones obtained\nthrough pertubative methods, as typically done in previous proposals, and\nremoves an important bottleneck in the road towards experimental realizations.\nThe scheme applies to generic gauge theories with Lie or finite symmetry\ngroups, both Abelian and non-Abelian. As a concrete example, we present the\nconstruction of a digital quantum simulator for a $\\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ lattice\ngauge theory with dynamical fermionic matter in $2+1$ dimensions, using\nultracold atoms in optical lattices, involving three atomic species,\nrepresenting the matter, gauge and auxiliary degrees of freedom, that are\nseparated in three different layers. By moving the ancilla atoms with a proper\nsequence of steps, we show how we can obtain the desired evolution in a clean,\ncontrolled way.\n", "  Stators, which may be intuitively defined as \"half states, half operators\"\nare mathematical objects which act on two Hilbert spaces and utilize\nentanglement to create remote operations and exchange information between two\nphysical systems. In particular, they allow to induce effective dynamics on one\nphysical system by acting on the other one, given they have properly been\nconnected with the right stator. In this work, the concept of stators is\ngeneralized and formalized in a way that allows the utilization of stators for\nsome physical problems based on symmetry groups, and in particular digital\nquantum simulation.\n", "  The second-order phase transition into a hidden order phase in URu$_2$Si$_2$\ngoes along with an order parameter which is still a mystery, despite 30 years\nof research. However, it is understood that the symmetry of the order parameter\nmust be related to the symmetry of the low lying local electronic $f$-states.\nHere we present results of a novel spectroscopy, namely core-level non-resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (NIXS). This method allows for the measurement of\nlocal high-multipole excitations and it is bulk sensitive. The observed\nanisotropy of the scattering function unambiguously shows that the 5$f$ ground\nstate wave function is composed mainly, but essentially not purely, of the\n$\\Gamma_1$ with majority $J_z$ =$|4\\rangle$ + $|-4\\rangle$ and/or $\\Gamma_2$\nsinglet states.\n", "  We derive the halo mass function (HMF) for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by solving\nthe excursion set problem explicitly with a mass-dependent barrier function,\nwhich has not been done before. We find that compared to the naive approach of\nthe Sheth--Tormen HMF for FDM, our approach has a higher cut off mass and the\ncut off mass changes less strongly with redshifts. Using merger trees\nconstructed with a modified version of the Lacey & Cole formalism that accounts\nfor suppressed small scale power and the scale-dependent growth of FDM haloes\nand the semi-analytic GALACTICUS code, we study the statistics of halo\nsubstructure including the effects from dynamical friction and tidal stripping.\nWe find that if the dark matter is a mixture of cold dark matter (CDM) and FDM,\nthere will be a suppression on the halo substructure on small scales which may\nbe able to solve the Missing Satellites Problem faced by the pure CDM model.\nThe suppression becomes stronger with increasing FDM fraction or decreasing FDM\nmass. Thus, it may be used to constrain the FDM model.\n", "  We calculate the energy and angular momentum fluxes across the event horizon\nof a tidally deformed, rapidly rotating black hole to next-to-leading order in\nthe curvature of the external spacetime. These are expressed in terms of tidal\nquadrupole moments and their time derivatives, which provide a characterization\nof a generic tidal environment. As an application of our results, we provide an\nexpression for the energy and angular-momentum fluxes across the horizon when\nthe black hole is a member of a binary system on a slowly-moving,\nquasi-circular orbit. Our expressions are accurate to 1.5 post-Newtonian order\nbeyond the leading-order fluxes, but they are valid for arbitrary mass ratios.\nWe compare our results to those previously obtained in the case of an extreme\nmass ratio binary, and find that they do not agree at the 1.5 post-Newtonian\norder. We investigate a number of possible sources for this discrepancy, but\nare ultimately unable to resolve it.\n", "  Based on 4d ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM on $\\mathbb{R}^{1}\\times$S$^3$, a gauge theory\ndescription of a small black hole in AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$ is proposed. The change\nof the number of dynamical degrees of freedom associated with the emission of\nthe scalar fields' eigenvalues plays a crucial role in this description. By\nanalyzing the microcanonical ensemble, the Hagedorn behavior of long strings at\nlow energy is obtained. Modulo an assumption based on the AdS/CFT duality for a\nlarge black hole, the energy of the small ten-dimensional Schwarzschild black\nhole $E\\sim 1/(G_{\\rm 10,N}T^7)$ is derived. A heuristic gauge theory argument\nsupporting this assumption is also given. The same argument applied to the ABJM\ntheory correctly reproduces the relation for the eleven-dimensional\nSchwarzschild black hole. One of the consequences of our proposal is that the\nsmall and large black holes are very similar when seen from the gauge theory\npoint of view.\n", "  In 1996, Huisen-Yau proved that every three-dimensional, asymptotically\nSchwarzschilden manifold with positive mass is uniquely foliated by stable\nspheres of constant mean curvature and they defined the center of mass using\nthis CMC-foliation. Rigger and Neves-Tian showed in 2004 and 2009/10 analogous\nexistence and uniqueness theorems for three-dimensional, asymptotically Anti-de\nSitter and asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with positive mass aspect\nfunction, respectively. Last year, Cederbaum-Cortier-Sakovich proved that the\nCMC-foliation characterizes the center of mass in the hyperbolic setting, too.\nIn this article, the existence and the uniqueness of the CMC-foliation are\nfurther generalized to the wider class of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds\nwhich do not necessarily have a well-defined mass aspect function, but only a\ntimelike mass vector. Furthermore, we prove that the CMC-foliation also\ncharacterizes the center of mass in this more general setting.\n", "  Quantum critical states exhibit strong quantum fluctuations and are therefore\nhighly susceptible to perturbations. In this work we study the dynamical\nstability against a sudden coupling to these strong fluctuations by quenching\nthe order parameter of the underlying transition. Such a quench can generate\nsuperextensive energy fluctuations. This leads to a dynamical quantum phase\ntransition (DQPT) with nonanalytic real-time behavior in the resulting decay of\nthe initial state. By establishing a general connection between DQPTs and\nquantum speed limits, this allows us to obtain a yet unrecognized quantum speed\nlimit with unconventional system size dependence. These findings are\nillustrated for the one-dimensional and the infinitely-connected\ntransverse-field Ising model. The main concepts, however, are general and can\nbe applied also to other critical states. An outlook is given onto the\nimplications of the superextensive energy fluctuations on potential restricted\nthermalization despite of nonintegrability.\n", "  Influence maximization in social networks has typically been studied in the\ncontext of contagion models and irreversible processes. In this paper, we\nconsider an alternate model that treats individual opinions as spins in an\nIsing system at dynamic equilibrium. We formalize the \\textit{Ising influence\nmaximization} problem, which has a natural physical interpretation as\nmaximizing the magnetization given a budget of external magnetic field. Under\nthe mean-field (MF) approximation, we present a gradient ascent algorithm that\nuses the susceptibility to efficiently calculate local maxima of the\nmagnetization, and we develop a number of sufficient conditions for when the MF\nmagnetization is concave and our algorithm converges to a global optimum. We\napply our algorithm on random and real-world networks, demonstrating,\nremarkably, that the MF optimal external fields (i.e., the external fields\nwhich maximize the MF magnetization) shift from focusing on high-degree\nindividuals at high temperatures to focusing on low-degree individuals at low\ntemperatures. We also establish a number of novel results about the structure\nof steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general graph\ntopologies, which are of independent interest.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for next-generation information\ncarriers, owing to their small size, topological stability, and ultralow\ndepinning current density. A wide variety of skyrmionic device concepts and\nprototypes have been proposed, highlighting their potential applications. Here,\nwe report on a bioinspired skyrmionic device with synaptic plasticity. The\nsynaptic weight of the proposed device can be strengthened/weakened by\npositive/negative stimuli, mimicking the potentiation/depression process of a\nbiological synapse. Both short-term plasticity(STP) and long-term\npotentiation(LTP) functionalities have been demonstrated for a spiking\ntime-dependent plasticity(STDP) scheme. This proposal suggests new\npossibilities for synaptic devices for use in spiking neuromorphic computing\napplications.\n", "  We investigate the constraint ability of the gravitational wave (GW) as the\nstandard siren on the cosmological parameters by using the third-generation\ngravitational wave detector: the Einstein Telescope. We simulate the luminosity\ndistances and redshift measurements from 100 to 1000 GW events. We use two\ndifferent algorithms to constrain the cosmological parameters. For the Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ and dark matter density parameter $\\Omega_m$, we adopt the\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo approach. We find that with about 500-600 GW events we\ncan constrain the Hubble constant with an accuracy comparable to\n\\textit{Planck} temperature data and \\textit{Planck} lensing combined results,\nwhile for the dark matter density, GWs alone seem not able to provide the\nconstraints as good as for the Hubble constant; the sensitivity of 1000 GW\nevents is a little lower than that of \\textit{Planck} data. It should require\nmore than 1000 events to match the \\textit{Planck} sensitivity. Yet, for\nanalyzing the more complex dynamical property of dark energy, i.e., the\nequation of state $w$, we adopt a new powerful nonparametric method: the\nGaussian process. We can reconstruct $w$ directly from the observational\nluminosity distance at every redshift. In the low redshift region, we find that\nabout 700 GW events can give the constraints of $w(z)$ comparable to the\nconstraints of a constant $w$ by \\textit{Planck} data with type Ia supernovae.\nThose results show that GWs as the standard sirens to probe the cosmological\nparameters can provide an independent and complementary alternative to current\nexperiments.\n", "  The holographic complexity and fidelity susceptibility have been defined as\nnew quantities dual to different volumes in AdS. In this paper, we will use\nthese new proposals to calculate both of these quantities for a variety of\ninteresting deformations of AdS. We obtain the holographic complexity and\nfidelity susceptibility for an AdS black hole, Janus solution and a solution\nwith cylindrically symmetry, an inhomogeneous background and a hyperscaling\nviolating background. It is observed that the holographic complexity depends on\nthe size of the subsystem for all these solutions and the fidelity\nsusceptibility does not have any such dependence.\n", "  Aspects of nuclear structure in alpha-conjugate nuclei have long been\nassociated with alpha clustering, including the existence of superdeformed\nbands. In this paper, an alpha-particle inelastic scattering experiment\ninvestigating the location of $0^+$ states in $^{28}$Si is reported in an\nattempt to locate possible cluster states. The results are compared to a\nsemi-microscopic model which shows good agreement with the data, and supports\nthe assignment of a newly discovered $0^+$ state as the band-head of a\npreviously observed superdeformed band in $^{28}$Si\n", "  This article presents a review of recent developments on various aspects of\nthe quantum Rabi model. Particular emphasis is given on the exact analytic\nsolution obtained in terms of confluent Heun functions. The analytic solutions\nfor various generalisations of the quantum Rabi model are also discussed.\nResults are also reviewed on the level statistics and the dynamics of the\nquantum Rabi model. The article concludes with an introductory overview of\nseveral experimental realisations of the quantum Rabi model. An outlook towards\nfuture developments is also given.\n", "  We investigate energy transfer by the radiation from a cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) system in the context of quantum thermodynamics. We\npropose a method of decomposing it into work and heat within the framework of\nquantum master equations. We find that the work and heat correspond\nrespectively to the coherent and incoherent parts of the radiation. In the\nderivation of the method, it is crucial to investigate the dynamics of the\nsystem that receives the radiation from the cavity.\n", "  A search for the resonant production of high-mass photon pairs is presented.\nThe search focuses on spin-0 and spin-2 resonances with masses between 0.5 and\n4.5 TeV, and with a width, relative to the mass, between 1.4E-4 and 5.6E-2. The\ndata sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse femtobarns\nof proton-proton collisions collected with the CMS detector in 2016 at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excess is observed relative to\nthe standard model expectation. The results of the search are combined\nstatistically with those previously obtained in 2012 and 2015 at sqrt(s) = 8\nand 13TeV, respectively, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 19.7 and\n3.3 inverse femtobarns, to derive exclusion limits on scalar resonances\nproduced through gluon-gluon fusion, and on Randall-Sundrum gravitons. The\nlower mass limits for Randall-Sundrum gravitons range from 1.95 to 4.45 TeV for\ncoupling parameters between 0.01 and 0.2. These are the most stringent limits\non Randall-Sundrum graviton production to date.\n", "  The problem of a quantum Ising degree of freedom coupled to a gapless bosonic\nmode appears naturally in many one dimensional systems, yet surprisingly little\nis known how such a coupling affects the Ising quantum critical point. We\ninvestigate the fate of the critical point in a regime, where the weak coupling\nrenormalization group (RG) indicates a flow toward strong coupling. Using a\nrenormalization group analysis and numerical density matrix renormalization\ngroup (DMRG) calculations we show that, depending on the ratio of velocities of\nthe gapless bosonic mode and the Ising critical fluctuations, the transition\nmay remain continuous or become fluctuation-driven first order. The two regimes\nare separated by a tri-critical point of a novel type.\n", "  We demonstrated visualization of Au nanoparticles buried 300 nm into a\npolymer matrix by measurement of the thermal noise spectrum of a\nmicrocantilever with a tip in contact to the polymer surface. The subsurface Au\nnanoparticles were detected as the variation in the contact stiffness and\ndamping reflecting the viscoelastic properties of the polymer surface. The\nvariation in the contact stiffness well agreed with the effective stiffness of\na simple one-dimensional model, which is consistent with the fact that the\nmaximum depth range of the technique is far beyond the extent of the contact\nstress field.\n", "  Non-stoquastic Hamiltonians have both positive and negative signs in\noff-diagonal elements in their matrix representation in the standard\ncomputational basis and thus cannot be simulated efficiently by the standard\nquantum Monte Carlo method due to the sign problem. We describe our analytical\nstudies of this type of Hamiltonians with infinite-range non-random as well as\nrandom interactions from the perspective of possible enhancement of the\nefficiency of quantum annealing or adiabatic quantum computing. It is shown\nthat multi-body transverse interactions like $XX$ and $XXXXX$ with positive\ncoefficients appended to a stoquastic transverse-field Ising model render the\nHamiltonian non-stoquastic and reduce a first-order quantum phase transition in\nthe simple transverse-field case to a second-order transition. This implies\nthat the efficiency of quantum annealing is exponentially enhanced, because a\nfirst-order transition has an exponentially small energy gap (and therefore\nexponentially long computation time) whereas a second-order transition has a\npolynomially decaying gap (polynomial computation time). The examples presented\nhere represent rare instances where strong quantum effects, in the sense that\nthey cannot be efficiently simulated in the standard quantum Monte Carlo, have\nanalytically been shown to exponentially enhance the efficiency of quantum\nannealing for combinatorial optimization problems.\n", "  The theory of composite bosons (cobosons) made of two fermions [Phys. Rev. A\n71, 034306 (2005), Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 260403 (2012)] converges to ordinary\nstructureless bosons in the limit of infinitely strong entanglement between the\nfermionic constituents. For finite entanglement, the annihilation operator\n$\\hat c$ of a composite boson couples the $N$-coboson Fock-state not only to\nthe $(N-1)$-coboson state -- as for ordinary bosons --, but also to a component\nwhich is orthogonal to the Fock-state ladder of cobosons. Coupling with states\northogonal to the Fock ladder arises also in dynamical processes of cobosons.\nHere, with a Gedanken-experiment involving both mode-splitting and collective\nHong-Ou-Mandel-like interference, we derive the characteristic physical\nsignature of the states orthogonal to the Fock ladder generated in the\nsplitting process. This allows to extract microscopic properties of\nmany-fermion-wave functions from the collective coboson behavior. We show that\nconsecutive beam-splitter dynamics increases the deviation from the ideal\nbosonic behavior pattern, which opens up a rigorous approach to the\nfalsification of coboson theory.\n", "  We report on new results of a search for two-photon interaction with\naxionlike particles (ALPs). The experiment was carried out at a synchrotron\nradiation facility using a \"light shining through a wall (LSW)\" technique. For\nthis purpose, we have developed a novel pulsed-magnet system, composed of\nmultiple racetrack-magnets and a transportable power supply. It produces fields\nof about 10 T over 0.8 m with a high repetition rate of 0.2 Hz and yields a new\nmethod of probing vacuum with high intensity fields. The data obtained with a\ntotal of 27,676 pulses provide a limit on the ALP-two-photon coupling constant\nthat is more stringent by a factor of 5.2 compared to a previous x-ray LSW\nlimit for the ALP mass below 0.1 eV.\n", "  We carry out constant volume simulations of steady-state, shear driven flow\nin a simple model of athermal, bidisperse, soft-core, frictionless disks in two\ndimensions, using a dissipation law that gives rise to Bagnoldian rheology.\nFocusing on the small strain rate limit, we map out the rheological behavior as\na function of particle packing fraction $\\phi$ and a parameter $Q$ that\nmeasures the elasticity of binary particle collisions. We find a $Q^*(\\phi)$\nthat marks the clear crossover from a region characteristic of strongly\ninelastic collisions, $Q<Q^*$, to a region characteristic of weakly inelastic\ncollisions, $Q>Q^*$, and give evidence that $Q^*(\\phi)$ diverges as\n$\\phi\\to\\phi_J$, the shear driven jamming transition. We thus conclude that the\njamming transition at any value of $Q$ behaves the same as the strongly\ninelastic case, provide one is sufficiently close to $\\phi_J$. We further\ncharacterize the differing nature of collisions in the strongly inelastic vs\nweakly inelastic regions, and recast our results into the constituent equation\nform commonly used in discussions of hard granular matter.\n", "  Ben-Israel and Vaidman (Found Phys (2017). doi:10.1007/s10701-017-0071-x)\nhave raised objections to my arguments that there are cases where a quantum\nmechanical weak value can be said not to represent the system to which it\npertains. They are correct in pointing out that some of my conclusions were too\ngeneral. However, for weak values of projection operators my conclusions still\nstand.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a Brownian circle swimmer with a time-dependent\nself-propulsion velocity in an external temporally varying harmonic potential.\nFor several situations, the noise-free swimming paths, the noise-averaged mean\ntrajectories, and the mean square displacements are calculated analytically or\nby computer simulation. Based on our results, we discuss optimal swimming\nstrategies in order to explore a maximum spatial range around the trap center.\nIn particular, we find a resonance situation for the maximum escape distance as\na function of the various frequencies in the system. Moreover, the influence of\nthe Brownian noise is analyzed by comparing noise-free trajectories at zero\ntemperature with the corresponding noise-averaged trajectories at finite\ntemperature. The latter reveal various complex self-similar spiral or\nrosette-like patterns. Our predictions can be tested in experiments on\nartificial and biological microswimmers under dynamical external confinement.\n", "  Density perturbations in cosmology, i.e. spherically symmetric adiabatic\nperturbations of a Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, are\nlocally exactly equivalent to a different FLRW solution, as long as their\nwavelength is much larger than the sound horizon of all fluid components. This\nfact is known as the \"separate universe\" paradigm. However, no such relation is\nknown for anisotropic adiabatic perturbations, which correspond to an FLRW\nspacetime with large-scale tidal fields. Here, we provide a closed, fully\nrelativistic set of evolutionary equations for the nonlinear evolution of such\nmodes, based on the conformal Fermi (CFC) frame. We show explicitly that the\ntidal effects are encoded by the Weyl tensor, and are hence entirely different\nfrom an anisotropic Bianchi I spacetime, where the anisotropy is sourced by the\nRicci tensor. In order to close the system, certain higher derivative terms\nhave to be dropped. We show that this approximation is equivalent to the local\ntidal approximation of Hui and Bertschinger (1995). We also show that this very\nsimple set of equations matches the exact evolution of the density field at\nsecond order, but fails at third and higher order. This provides a useful,\neasy-to-use framework for computing the fully relativistic growth of structure\nat second order.\n", "  We review previous work on spectral flow in connection with certain\nself-adjoint model operators $\\{A(t)\\}_{t\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ on a Hilbert space\n$\\mathcal{H}$, joining endpoints $A_\\pm$, and the index of the operator\n$D_{A}^{}= (d/d t) + A$ acting in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}; \\mathcal{H})$, where $A$\ndenotes the operator of multiplication $(A f)(t) = A(t)f(t)$. In this article\nwe review what is known when these operators have some essential spectrum and\ndescribe some new results in terms of associated spectral shift functions.\n  We are especially interested in extensions to non-Fredholm situations,\nreplacing the Fredholm index by the Witten index, and use a particular\n$(1+1)$-dimensional model setup to illustrate our approach based on spectral\nshift functions.\n", "  Modern pedestrian and suspension bridges are designed using industry-standard\npackages, yet disastrous resonant vibrations are observed, necessitating\nmulti-million dollar repairs. Recent examples include pedestrian induced\nvibrations during the openings of the Solf\\'erino Bridge in Paris in 1999 and\nthe increased bouncing of the Squibb Park Bridge in Brooklyn in 2014. The most\nprominent example of an unstable lively bridge is the London Millennium Bridge\nwhich started wobbling as a result of pedestrian-bridge interactions.\nPedestrian phase-locking due to footstep phase adjustment, is suspected to be\nthe main cause of its large lateral vibrations; however, its role in the\ninitiation of wobbling was debated. In this paper, we develop foot force models\nof pedestrians' response to bridge motion and detailed, yet analytically\ntractable models of crowd phase-locking. We use bio-mechanically inspired\nmodels of crowd lateral movement to investigate to what degree pedestrian\nsynchrony must be present for a bridge to wobble significantly and what is a\ncritical crowd size. Our results can be used as a safety guideline for\ndesigning pedestrian bridges or limiting the maximum occupancy of an existing\nbridge. The pedestrian models can be used as \"crash test dummies\" when\nnumerically probing a specific bridge design. This is particularly important\nbecause the US code for designing pedestrian bridges does not contain explicit\nguidelines that account for the collective pedestrian behavior.\n", "  Analogous to the quarkyonic matter at high baryon density in which the quark\nFermi seas and the baryonic excitations coexist, it is argued that a\n\"quarksonic matter\" phase appears at high isospin density where the quark\n(antiquark) Fermi seas and the mesonic excitations coexist. We explore this\nphase in detail in both large $N_c$ and asymptotically free limits: In large\n$N_c$ limit, we sketch a phase diagram for the quarksonic matter. In the\nasymptotically free limit, we study the pion superfluidity and thermodynamics\nof the quarksonic matter by using both perturbative calculations and effective\nmodel.\n", "  Recent reanalysis of ALEPH data on Z -> b bar{b} + X seems to indicate an\nexistence of the dimuon excess around 30 GeV with a branching fraction for Z ->\nb bar{b} mu^+ mu^- around 1.1 X 10^{-5}. In this letter, we discuss three\ndifferent types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first\nclass of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+\nmu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of\nmodels is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the\nb bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV\nexcess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike\nsinglet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for\nthe ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike\nquark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~\nO(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger\nthan sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC\nwould be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might\nhave been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events\nhave low SM background and are rare at the LHC. In the third model, we consider\nZ -> Z' phi followed by Z' -> mu^+ mu^- and phi -> b bar{b} assuming that the\nHiggs field for Z' mass is also charged under the SM U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. In\nthis class of model, we could accommodate the Br(Z -> b bar{b} mu^+ mu^-) ~ 1.1\nX 10^{-5} if we assume very large U(1)' charge for the U(1)' breaking Higgs\nfield. Finally, we study various kinematic distributions of muons and b jets in\nall the three models, and find that none of the models we consider in this\npaper are not compatible with the kinematic distributions extracted from the\nALEPH data.\n", "  We numerically study the zero temperature phase structure of the multiflavor\nSchwinger model at nonzero chemical potential. Using matrix product states, we\nreproduce analytical results for the phase structure for two flavors in the\nmassless case and extend the computation to the massive case, where no\nanalytical predictions are available. Our calculations allow us to locate phase\ntransitions in the mass-chemical potential plane with great precision and\nprovide a concrete example of tensor networks overcoming the sign problem in a\nlattice gauge theory calculation.\n", "  Unlike the two-terminal device, in which the time-reversal invariant\nspin-orbit interaction alone cannot polarize the spins, such a polarization can\nbe generated when electrons from one source reservoir flow into two (or more)\nseparate drain reservoirs. We present analytical solutions for two examples.\nFirst, we demonstrate that the electrons transmitted through a \"diamond\"\ninterferometer into two drains can be simultaneously fully spin-polarized along\ndifferent tunable directions, even when the two arms of the interferometer are\nnot identical. Second, we show that a single helical molecule attached to more\nthan one drain can induce a significant spin polarization in electrons passing\nthrough it. The average polarization remains non-zero even when the electrons\noutgoing into separate leads are eventually mixed incoherently into one\nabsorbing reservoir. This may explain recent experiments on spin selectivity of\ncertain helical-chiral molecules.\n", "  The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) was installed on the International\nSpace Station (ISS) and it has been collecting data successfully since May\n2011. The main goals of AMS-02 are the search for cosmic anti-matter, dark\nmatter and the precise measurement of the relative abundance of elements and\nisotopes in galactic cosmic rays. In order to identify particle properties,\nAMS-02 includes several specialized sub-detectors. Among them, the AMS-02 Ring\nImaging Cherenkov detector (RICH) is designed to provide a very precise\nmeasurement of the velocity and electric charge of particles. We describe a\nmethod to reject the dominant electron background in antiproton identification\nwith the use of the AMS-02 RICH detector as a veto for rigidities below 3 GV.\nRay tracing integration method is used to maximize the statistics of $\\bar{p}$\nwith the lowest possible $e^{-}$ background, providing 4 times rejection power\ngain for $e^{-}$ background with respect to only 3\\% of $\\bar{p}$ signal\nefficiency loss. By using the collected cosmic-rays data, $e^{-}$ contamination\ncan be well suppressed within 3\\% with $\\beta \\approx 1$, while keeping 76\\%\nefficiency for $\\bar{p}$ below the threshold.\n", "  While a plethora of hypertext links exist on the Web, only a small amount of\nthem are regularly clicked. Starting from this observation, we set out to study\nlarge-scale click data from Wikipedia in order to understand what makes a link\nsuccessful. We systematically analyze effects of link properties on the\npopularity of links. By utilizing mixed-effects hurdle models supplemented with\ndescriptive insights, we find evidence of user preference towards links leading\nto the periphery of the network, towards links leading to semantically similar\narticles, and towards links in the top and left-side of the screen. We\nintegrate these findings as Bayesian priors into a navigational Markov chain\nmodel and by doing so successfully improve the model fits. We further adapt and\nimprove the well-known classic PageRank algorithm that assumes random\nnavigation by accounting for observed navigational preferences of users in a\nweighted variation. This work facilitates understanding navigational click\nbehavior and thus can contribute to improving link structures and algorithms\nutilizing these structures.\n", "  In this work, we present an analysis of the nonleptonic charmonium modes\n$B_s^0 \\to J / \\psi f_2^\\prime(1525)$ and $B_s^0 \\to J/\\psi K^+K^-$. Within the\nframework of the factorization approach and using the perturbative QCD for the\nevaluation of the relevant form factors, we find a branching fraction for the\ntwo-body channel of BR$(B_s^{0} \\to J/\\psi f_2^{\\prime}(1525)) = (1.6\n{}^{+0.9}_{-0.7})\\times 10^{-4}$ which is in agreement with the experimental\nvalues reported by the LHCb and Belle Collaborations. The associated\npolarization fractions to this vector-tensor mode are also presented. On the\nother hand, non-resonant and resonant contributions to the three-body decay\n$B_s^0 \\to J/\\psi K^+K^-$ are carefully investigated. The dominant\ncontributions of the resonances $ \\phi(1020)$ and $f_2^{\\prime}(1525)$ are\nproperly taken into account. A detailed analysis of the $K^+ K^-$ invariant\nmass distributions and Dalitz plot are also performed. The overall result\nBR$(B_s^{0} \\to J/\\psi K^+ K^-) = (9.3^{+1.3}_{-1.1})\\times 10^{-4}$ is also in\nsatisfactory agreement with the experimental information reported by LHCb and\nBelle.\n", "  We study lower large deviations for the current of totally asymmetric\nzero-range processes on a ring with concave current-density relation. We use an\napproach by Jensen and Varadhan which has previously been applied to exclusion\nprocesses, to realize current fluctuations by travelling wave density profiles\ncorresponding to non-entropic weak solutions of the hyperbolic scaling limit of\nthe process. We further establish a dynamic transition, where large deviations\nof the current below a certain value are no longer typically attained by\nnon-entropic weak solutions, but by condensed profiles, where a non-zero\nfraction of all the particles accumulates on a single fixed lattice site. This\nleads to a general characterization of the rate function, which is illustrated\nby providing detailed results for four generic examples of jump rates,\nincluding constant rates, decreasing rates, unbounded sublinear rates and\nasymptotically linear rates. Our results on the dynamic transition are\nsupported by numerical simulations using a cloning algorithm.\n", "  The Dalitz decay pi^0 -> e^+e^-gamma has been measured in the gamma p -> pi^0\np reaction with the A2 tagged-photon facility at the Mainz Microtron, MAMI. The\nvalue obtained for the slope parameter of the pi^0 electromagnetic transition\nform factor, a_pi = 0.030+/-0.010_tot, is in agreement with existing\nmeasurements of this decay and with recent theoretical calculations. The\nuncertainty obtained in the value of a_pi is lower than in previous results\nbased on the pi^0 -> e^+e^-gamma decay.\n", "  In this brief note we point out that in the case of two dimensional crystals\nlike graaphene, there is an interesting anomalous behaviour of Fermions. This\ncould potentially be useful.\n", "  SU(5) $\\otimes$ SU(5) provides a minimal grand unification scheme for\nfermions and gauge forces if there are vector-like quarks and leptons in\nnature. We explore the gauge coupling unification in a non-supersymmetric model\nof this type, and study its implications for proton decay. The properties of\nvector-like quarks and intermediate scales that emerge from coupling\nunification play a central role in suppressing proton decay. We find that in\nthis model, the familiar decay mode $p \\to e^+ \\pi^0$ may have a partial\nlifetime within the reach of currently planned experiments.\n", "  Majorana Kramers pairs emerged on surfaces of time-reversal-invariant\ntopological crystalline superconductors show the Ising anisotropy to an applied\nmagnetic field. We clarify that crystalline symmetry uniquely determines the\ndirection of the Majorana Ising spin for given irreducible representations of\npair potential, deriving constraints to topological invariants. Besides,\nnecessary conditions for nontrivial topological invariants protected by the\nn-fold rotational symmetry are shown.\n", "  Similar to the hybridization of three atoms, three coupled resonators\ninteract to form bonding, anti-bonding and non-bonding modes. The non-bonding\nmode enables an electromagnetic induced transparency like transfer of energy.\nHere the non-bonding mode, resulting from the strong electric coupling of two\ndielectric resonators and an enclosure, is exploited to show that it is\nfeasible to transfer power over a distance comparable to the operating\nwavelength. In this scheme, the enclosure acts as a mediator. The strong\ncoupling permits the excitation of the non-bonding mode with high purity. This\napproach is different from resonant inductive coupling which works in the\nsub-wavelength regime. Optimal loads and the corresponding maximum efficiency\nare determined using two independent methods: Coupled Mode Theory and Circuit\nmodelling. It is shown that, unlike resonant inductive coupling, the figure of\nmerit depends on the enclosure quality and not on the load, which emphasizes\nthe role of the enclosure as a mediator. Briefly after the input excitation is\nturned on, the energy in the receiver builds up via all coupled and spurious\nmodes. As time elapses, all modes except the non-bonding cease to sustain. Due\nto the strong coupling between the dielectrics and the enclosure, such systems\nhave unique properties such as high and uniform efficiency over large\ndistances; and minimal fringing fields. These properties suggest that\nelectromagnetic induced transparency like schemes which rely on the use of\ndielectric resonators can be used to power autonomous systems inside an\nenclosure or find applications when exposure to the fields needs to be minimal.\nFinite Element computations are used to verify the theoretical predictions by\ndetermining the transfer efficiency, fields profile and coupling coefficients\nfor two different systems.\n", "  With a light dilaton $\\sigma$ and the light-quark vector mesons\n$V=(\\rho,\\omega)$ incorporated into an effective scale-invariant hidden local\nsymmetric Lagrangian, scale-chiral symmetry -- hidden in QCD -- arises at a\nhigh density, $n_{1/2}$, as an \"emergent\" symmetry, a phenomenon absent in\nstandard chiral perturbative approaches but highly relevant for massive compact\nstars. What takes place as the density increases beyond $n_{1/2}\\sim 2n_0$ in\ncompressed baryonic matter is (1) a topology change from skyrmions to\nhalf-skyrmions, (2) parity doubling in the nucleon structure, (3) the maximum\nneutron star mass $M\\simeq 2.01 M_{\\odot}$ and the radius $R\\simeq 12.0$ km and\n(4) the sound velocity $v_s^2/c^2\\simeq 1/3$ due to the \"vector manifestation\n(VM)\" fixed point of $\\rho$ and a \"walking\" dilaton condensate, which is\nintricately connected to the source of the proton mass.\n", "  In a recent paper [Mod. Phys. Lett. A30 (2015) 1550104], the black-hole/qubit\ncorrespondence (BHQC) was exploited to define \"black hole quantum circuits\"\nallowing for a change of the supersymmetry-preserving features of\nelectromagnetic charge configurations supporting the black hole solution, thus\nswitching from one U-duality orbit to another, or - equivalently - from an\nelement of the corresponding Freudenthal Triple System with a definite rank, to\nanother one. On the supergravity side of BHQC, such quantum gates relate to\nparticular symplectic transformations acting on the black hole charges; namely,\nsuch transformations cannot belong to the U-duality group, otherwise switching\namong orbits would be impossible. In this paper, we consider a particular class\nof such symplectic transformations, namely the ones belonging to the so-called\nPeccei-Quinn symplectic group, introduced some time ago within the study of\nvery special Kaehler geometries of the vector multiplets' scalar manifolds in N\n= 2 supergravity in D = 4 space-time dimensions.\n", "  We report on measurements of relative beta-decay rates of Na-22, Cl-36,\nCo-60, Sr-90, Cs-137 monitored for more than one year. The radioactive samples\nare mounted in an automated sample changer that sequentially positions the five\nsamples in turn, with high spatial precision, in front of each of four\nGeiger-M\\\"uller tubes. The sample wheel, detectors, and associated electronics\nare housed inside a sealed chamber held at constant absolute pressure,\nhumidity, and temperature to isolate the experiment from environmental\nvariations. The statistical uncertainty in the count rate approaches a few\ntimes 0.01% with two weeks of averaging. Other sources of error are on a\nsimilar scale. The data are analyzed in variety of ways, comparing count rates\nof the various samples on one or more detectors, and comparing count rates of a\nparticular sample across multiple detectors. We observe no statistically\nsignificant variations in the ratios of decay rates, either annual or at\nhigher-frequency, at a level above 0.01%.\n", "  The production of two prompt $J/\\psi$ mesons, each with transverse momenta\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}>8.5$ GeV and rapidity $|y| < 2.1$, is studied using a sample of\nproton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 11.4 fb$^{-1}$ collected in 2012 with the ATLAS detector at the\nLHC. The differential cross-section, assuming unpolarised $J/\\psi$ production,\nis measured as a function of the transverse momentum of the\nlower-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ $J/\\psi$ meson, di-$J/\\psi$ $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and mass,\nthe difference in rapidity between the two $J/\\psi$ mesons, and the azimuthal\nangle between the two $J/\\psi$ mesons. The fraction of prompt pair events due\nto double parton scattering is determined by studying kinematic correlations\nbetween the two $J/\\psi$ mesons. The total and double parton scattering\ncross-sections are compared with predictions. The effective cross-section of\ndouble parton scattering is measured to be $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 6.3 \\pm 1.6\n\\mathrm{(stat)} \\pm 1.0 \\mathrm{(syst)}$ mb.\n", "  Using four different experimental techniques, we performed comprehensive\nstudies of the bulk superconductive properties of single crystals of the nearly\noptimally doped $Ba_{1-x}K_xFe_2As_2$ ($T_{c} \\approx 36\\,K$), a typical\nrepresentative of the 122 family. We investigated temperature dependencies of\nthe (i) specific heat $C_{el}(T)$, (ii) first critical magnetic field\n$H_{c1}(T)$, (iii) intrinsic multiple Andreev reflection effect (IMARE), and\n(iv) infrared reflectivity spectra. All data clearly show the presence of (at\nleast) two superconducting nodeless gaps. The quantitative data on the\nsuperconducting spectrum obtained by four different techniques are consistent\nwith each other: (a) the small energy gap $\\Delta_S(0) \\approx 1.8 - 2.5\\,meV$,\nand the large gap energy $\\Delta_L(0) \\approx 9.5 - 11.3\\,meV$ that\ndemonstrates the signature of an extended s-wave symmetry ($\\sim~33 \\%$\nin-plane anisotropy), (b) the characteristic ratio $2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C$\nnoticeably exceeds the BCS value.\n", "  An energy gap can be opened in the electronic spectrum of graphene by lifting\nits sublattice symmetry. In bilayers, it is possible to open gaps as large as\n0.2 eV. However, these gaps rarely lead to a highly insulating state expected\nfor such semiconductors at low temperatures. This long-standing puzzle is\nusually explained by charge inhomogeneity. Here we investigate spatial\ndistributions of proximity-induced superconducting currents in gapped graphene\nand, also, compare measurements in the Hall bar and Corbino geometries in the\nnormal state. By gradually opening the gap in bilayer graphene, we find that\nthe supercurrent at the charge neutrality point changes from uniform to such\nthat it propagates along narrow stripes near graphene edges. Similar stripes\nare found in gapped monolayers. These observations are corroborated by using\nthe \"edgeless\" Corbino geometry in which case resistivity at the neutrality\npoint increases exponentially with increasing the gap, as expected for an\nordinary semiconductor. This is in contrast to the Hall bar geometry where\nresistivity measured under similar conditions saturates to values of only about\na few resistance quanta. We attribute the metallic-like edge conductance to a\nnontrivial topology of gapped Dirac spectra.\n", "  We study numerically a model of quantum dot with interacting fermions. At\nstrong interactions with small conductance the model is reduced to the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev black hole model while at weak interactions and large\nconductance it describes a Landau Fermi liquid in a regime of quantum chaos. We\nshow that above the Aberg threshold for interactions there is an onset of\ndynamical themalization with the Fermi-Dirac distribution describing the\neigenstates of isolated dot. At strong interactions in the isolated black hole\nregime there is also onset of dynamical thermalization with the entropy\ndescribed by the quantum Gibbs distribution. This dynamical thermalization\ntakes place in an isolated system without any contact with thermostat. We\ndiscuss possible realization of these regimes with quantum dots of 2D electrons\nand cold ions in optical lattices.\n", "  On the elementary level, electronic current consists of individual electron\ntunnelling events that are separated by random time intervals. The waiting time\ndistribution is a probability to observe the electron transfer in the detector\nelectrode at time $t+\\tau$ given that an electron was detected in the same\nelectrode at earlier time $t$. We study waiting time distribution for quantum\ntransport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration\ninteraction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we obtain\nmaster equation and compute the distribution of waiting times for electron\ntransport. The details of waiting time distributions are used to elucidate\nmicroscopic mechanism of electron transport and the role of electron-vibration\ninteractions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction,\nthe skewness and dispersion of the waiting time distribution experience\nstepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are\nassociated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons.\nIn the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease\ndominates over all other changes in the waiting time distribution as the\nmolecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium.\n", "  In this paper, we have worked on the possibility of setting up an Bell's\ninequality violating experiment in the context of primordial cosmology\nfollowing the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. To set up this\nproposal we have introduced a model independent theoretical framework using\nwhich we have studied the creation of new massive particles for the scalar\nfluctuations in the presence of additional time dependent mass parameter. Next\nwe explicitly computed the one point and two point correlation functions from\nthis setup. Then we comment on the measurement techniques of isospin breaking\ninteractions of newly introduced massive particles and its further prospects.\nAfter that, we give an example of string theory originated axion monodromy\nmodel in this context. Finally, we provide a bound on the heavy particle mass\nparameter for any arbitrary spin field.\n", "  Computational prediction of origin of replication (ORI) has been of great\ninterest in bioinformatics and several methods including GC Skew, Z curve,\nauto-correlation etc. have been explored in the past. In this paper, we have\nextended the auto-correlation method to predict ORI location with much higher\nresolution for prokaryotes. The proposed complex correlation method (iCorr)\nconverts the genome sequence into a sequence of complex numbers by mapping the\nnucleotides to {+1,-1,+i,-i} instead of {+1,-1} used in the auto-correlation\nmethod (here, 'i' is square root of -1). Thus, the iCorr method uses\ninformation about the positions of all the four nucleotides unlike the earlier\nauto-correlation method which uses the positional information of only one\nnucleotide. Also, this earlier method required visual inspection of the\nobtained graphs to identify the location of origin of replication. The proposed\niCorr method does away with this need and is able to identify the origin\nlocation simply by picking the peak in the iCorr graph. The iCorr method also\nworks for a much smaller segment size compared to the earlier auto-correlation\nmethod, which can be very helpful in experimental validation of the\ncomputational predictions. We have also developed a variant of the iCorr method\nto predict ORI location in eukaryotes and have tested it with the\nexperimentally known origin locations of S. cerevisiae with an average accuracy\nof 71.76%.\n", "  Recent radio observations show that the giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass\nfunctions noticeably vary across galactic disks. High-resolution\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations show that multiple episodes of compression are\nrequired for creating a molecular cloud in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nIn this article, we formulate the evolution equation for the GMC mass function\nto reproduce the observed profiles, for which multiple compression are driven\nby the network of expanding shells due to HII regions and supernova remnants.\nWe introduce the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) terms in the evolution equation in\ncontrast to the previous work (Inutsuka et al. 2015). The computed time\nevolution suggests that the GMC mass function slope is governed by the ratio of\nGMC formation timescale to its dispersal timescale, and that the CCC effect is\nlimited only in the massive-end of the mass function. In addition, we identify\na gas resurrection channel that allows the gas dispersed by massive stars to\nregenerate GMC populations or to accrete onto the pre-existing GMCs. Our\nresults show that almost all of the dispersed gas contribute to the mass growth\nof pre-existing GMCs in arm regions whereas less than 60 per cent in inter-arm\nregions. Our results also predict that GMC mass functions have a single\npower-law exponent in the mass range < 10^5.5 Msun (where Msun represents the\nsolar mass), which is well characterized by GMC self-growth and dispersal\ntimescales. Measurement of the GMC mass function slope provides a powerful\nmethod to constrain those GMC timescales and the gas resurrecting factor in\nvarious environment across galactic disks.\n", "  We present here the application of a model for a mass circulation mechanism\nin between the H-burning shell and the base of the convective envelope of low\nmass AGB stars, aimed at studying the isotopic composition of those presolar\ngrains showing the most extreme levels of 18O depletion and high concentration\nof 26Mg from the decay of 26Al. The mixing scheme we present is based on a\npreviously suggested magnetic-buoyancy process, already shown to account\nadequately for the formation of the main neutron source for slow neutron\ncaptures in AGB stars. We find that this scenario is also capable of\nreproducing for the first time the extreme values of the 17O/16O, the 18O/16O,\nand the 26Al/27Al isotopic ratios found in the mentioned oxide grains,\nincluding the highest amounts of 26Al there measured.\n", "  Generic axiomatic-nonextensive statistics characterized by two asymptotic\nproperties, to each of them a scaling function is assigned, characterized by c\nand d for first and second scaling property, respectively, is formulated in a\ngrand-canonical ensemble with finite volume in the thermodynamic limit. The\nthermodynamic properties of a relativistic ideal gas of hadron resonances are\nstudied. It is found that this generic statistics satisfies the requirements of\nthe equilibrium thermodynamics. Essential aspects of thermodynamic\nself-consistency are clarified. Analytical expressions are proposed for the\nstatistical fits of various transverse momentum distributions measured in\nmost-central collisions at different collision energies and colliding systems.\nEstimations for the freezeout temperature and chemical potential and both c and\nd are determined. The earlier are found compatible with the parameters deduced\nfrom Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistics (extensive), while the latter refer to\ngeneric nonextensivity. The resulting equivalence class (c,d) is associated to\nstretched exponentials, where Lambert function reaches its asymptotic\nstability. In some measurements, the resulting nonextensive entropy is linearly\ncomposed of extensive entropies. Apart from power-scaling, the particle ratios\nand yields are excellent quantities to highlighting whether the particle\nproduction takes place, (non)extensively. Various particle ratios and yields\nmeasured by the STAR experiment in central collisions at 200, 62.4 and 7.7 GeV\nare fitted to this novel approach. We found that both c and d<1, i.e. referring\nto neither BG- nor Tsallis-type statistics, but to (c,d)-entropy, where Lambert\nfunctions exponentially raise. We conclude that the particle production at STAR\nenergies is likely a nonextensive process but not necessarily BG or Tsallis\ntype.\n", "  Graphynes and graphdiynes are carbon 2D allotrope structures presenting both\nsp2 and sp hybridized atoms. These materials have been theoretically predicted\nbut due to intrinsic difficulties in their synthesis, only recently some of\nthese structures have been experimentally realized. Graphyne nanoscrolls are\nstructures obtained by rolling up graphyne sheets into papyrus-like structures.\nIn this work we have investigated, through fully atomistic reactive molecular\ndynamics simulations, the dynamics of nanoscroll formation for a series of\ngraphyne ({\\alpha}, \\b{eta}, and {\\delta} types) structures. We have also\ninvestigated their thermal stability for a temperature range of 200-1000K. Our\nresults show that stable nanoscrolls can be formed for all structures\nconsidered here. Their stability depends on a critical value of the ratio\nbetween width and height of the graphyne sheets. Our findings also show that\nthese structures are structurally less stable then graphene-based nanoscrolls.\nThis can be explained by the graphyne higher structural porosity which results\nin a decreased pi-pi stacking interactions\n", "  Angular momentum and mass-charge inequalities for axisymmetric maximal\ntime-symmetric initial data in Einstein-Maxwell gravity with dark matter sector\nwere derived. The dark matter sector is mimicked by another U(1)-gauge field\ncoupled to the ordinary Maxwell one. We assume that data set with two\nasymptotically flat regions is given on smooth simply connected manifold. One\nalso pays attention to the area momentum charge inequalities for a closed\norientable two-dimensional spacelike surface embedded in the spacetime of the\nconsidered theory. It turned out that the addition of dark matter sector\ninfluences to the great extent on the growth of the black hole masses. This\nfact may be responsible for the existence of the recently detected supermassive\nobjects at relatively short time after Big Bang. The inequalities binding the\ncharge of the body (black hole) and its size were also investigated. It turns\nout that the estimation depends on the coupling constant of the ordinary matter\nto the dark matter sector.\n", "  Resonant optical excitation of apical oxygen vibrational modes in the normal\nstate of underdoped YBa2Cu3O6+x induces a transient state with optical\nproperties similar to those of the equilibrium superconducting state. Amongst\nthese, a divergent imaginary conductivity and a plasma edge are transiently\nobserved in the photo-stimulated state. Femtosecond hard x-ray diffraction\nexperiments have been used in the past to identify the transient crystal\nstructure in this non-equilibrium state. Here, we start from these\ncrystallographic features and theoretically predict the corresponding\nelectronic rearrangements that accompany these structural deformations. Using\ndensity functional theory, we predict enhanced hole-doping of the CuO2 planes.\nThe empty chain Cu dy2-z2 orbital is calculated to strongly reduce in energy,\nwhich would increase c-axis transport and potentially enhance the interlayer\nJosephson coupling as observed in the THz-frequency response. From these\ncalculations, we predict changes in the soft x-ray absorption spectra at the Cu\nL-edge. Femtosecond x-ray pulses from a free electron laser are used to probe\nthese changes in absorption at two photon energies along this spectrum, and\nprovide data consistent with these predictions.\n", "  A generalization of the forest technique procedure --- the\n$R^{-1}$-operation---is elaborated and then employed to treat a variety of\nproblems. First, it is employed to reveal the underlying simple structure of\nthe Bogoliubov-Parasiuk renormalization prescription based on momentum\nsubtractions. Second, we use this structure to derive a generalized Zimmermann\nidentity connecting two different renormalized versions of a given Feynman\nintegral. Third, the recursive procedure to minimally subtract the ultraviolet\nand infrared divergences from euclidean, dimensionally regularized Feynman\nintegrals---the $R^*$-operation--- is simplified by reformulating it in terms\nof the R-operation alone. The new formulation is shown to lead immediately to a\nsimple and regular algorithm for evaluating the overall ultraviolet divergences\nof arbitrary dimensionally regularized Feynman integrals, (including the ones\nappearing in two-dimensional field-theoretical models), the algorithm neatly\nreducing the problem to computing some massless propagator-type integrals.\nFinally, we construct a brief and concise proof of a general theorem which\ngives an explicitly finite large momenta and/or masses asymptotic expansion of\nan arbitrary (minimally subtracted) euclidean Feynman integral.\n", "  In 1996, Huisken-Yau proved that every three-dimensional Riemannian manifold\ncan be uniquely foliated near infinity by stable closed surfaces of constant\nmean curvature (CMC) if it is asymptotically equal to the (spatial)\nSchwarzschild solution. Using their method, Rigger proved the same theorem for\nRiemannian manifolds being asymptotically equal to the (spatial)\n(Schwarzschild-)Anti-de Sitter solution. This was generalized to asymptotically\nhyperbolic manifolds by Neves-Tian, Chodosh, and the author at a later stage.\nIn this work, we prove the reverse implication as the author already did in the\nEuclidean setting, i.e. any three-dimensional Riemannian manifold is\nasymptotically hyperbolic if it (and only if) possesses a CMC-cover satisfying\ncertain geometric curvature estimates, a uniqueness property, and each surface\nhas controlled instability. As toy application of these geometric\ncharacterizations of asymptotically Euclidean and hyperbolic manifolds, we\npresent a method for replacing an asymptotically hyperbolic by an\nasymptotically Euclidean end and apply this method to prove that the Hawking\nmass of the CMC-surfaces is bounded by their limit being the total mass of the\nasymptotically hyperbolic manifold, where equality holds only for the t=0-slice\nof the (Schwarzschild-)Anti-de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  Numerical simulations of realistic non-vacuum magnetospheres of isolated\nneutron stars have shown that pulsar spin-down luminosities depend weakly on\nthe magnetic obliquity. This result provides the opportunity to estimate the\nsurface magnetic field for a given radiopulsar with quite a high accuracy. In\nthe current work, we present a refinement of the classical `magneto-dipolar'\nformula for pulsar magnetic fields $B_{\\rm md} = (3.2\\times 10^{19}\\mbox{\nG})\\sqrt{P\\dot P}$, where $P$ is the neutron star spin period. The new, robust\ntiming-based estimator is introduced as $\\log B = \\log B_{\\rm md} + \\Delta_{\\rm\nB}(M, \\alpha)$, where the correction $\\Delta_{\\rm B}$ depends on the equation\nof state (EOS) of dense matter, the individual pulsar obliquity $\\alpha$ and\nthe mass $M$. Adopting state-of-the-art statistics for $M$ and $\\alpha$ we\ncalculate the distributions of $\\Delta_{\\rm B}$ for a representative subset of\n22 EOSs that do not contradict observations. It has been found that\n$\\Delta_{\\rm B}$ is distributed nearly normally, with the average in the range\n-0.5 to -0.25 dex and standard deviation $\\sigma[\\Delta_{\\rm B}] \\approx$ 0.06\nto 0.09 dex, depending on the adopted EOS. The latter quantity represents a\nformal uncertainty of the corrected estimation of $\\log B$ because $\\Delta_{\\rm\nB}$ is weakly correlated with $\\log B_{\\rm md}$. At the same time, if it is\nassumed that every considered EOS has the same chance of occurring in nature,\nthen another, more generalized, estimator $B^* \\approx 3B_{\\rm md}/7$ can be\nintroduced providing an unbiased value of the pulsar surface magnetic field\nwith $\\sim$30 per cent uncertainty with 68 per cent confidence. Finally, we\ndiscuss the possible impact of pulsar timing irregularities on the timing-based\nestimation of $B$ and review the astrophysical applications of the obtained\nresults.\n", "  We apply the notion of \\emph{optimality} of measurements for state\ndetermination(tomography) as originally given by Wootters and Fields to\n\\emph{weak value tomography} of \\emph{pure states}. They defined measurements\nto be optimal if they 'minimised' the effects of statistical errors. For\ntechnical reasons they actually maximised the state averaged information,\nprecisely quantified as the negative logarithm of 'error volume'. In this paper\nwe optimise both the state averaged information as well as error volumes. We\nprove, for Hilbert spaces of arbitrary (finite) dimensionality, that varieties\nof weak value measurements are optimal when the post-selected bases are\n\\emph{mutually unbiased} with respect to the eigenvectors of the observable\nbeing measured. We prove a number of important results about the geometry of\nstate spaces when expressed through the weak values as coordinates. We derive\nan expression for the Ka\\\"ehler potential for the N-dimensional case with the\nhelp of which we give an exact treatment of the arbitrary-spin case.\n", "  The topological presentation of pomeron exchange at the proton-proton\ncollision of high energy is cylinder that is covered with quark-gluon net. I\nsuggest that the process of double diffraction (DD) is to be presented as one\npomeron exchange with the central loop of two uncut pomeron cylinders. This\npomeron torus may be covered by only a certain number of hexagons with\nthree-string-junction (SJ) and three-anti-junction vertices each. It is\nreasonable to expect that the dynamics of rapidity gaps in DD should be\ndetermined by the number of hexagons on the surface of pomeron torus.\nTherefore, the gap distribution in DD events has the discrete structure in the\nregion of large gaps. Moreover, if the string-junction torus can be released in\npp interactions as metastable particle, it is getting suspected as Dark Matter\ncandidate. The possibility of production of the states with many string\njunctions has been discussed recently by G.C. Rossi and G. Veneziano. There is\nanother process with pomeron loop configuration that is the particle production\nevents with doubled multiplicity at the central rapidity, which corresponds to\nthe cut along the pomeron loop. The positive hyperon production asymmetries\nthat have been measured at LHC are real demonstrations of string junction\ndynamics in the proton-proton interactions. These measurements have shown that\nthe energy dependence of baryon excess in the central rapidity region depends\non the SJ parameter. Therefore, the actual goal of LHC experiments should be\nthe measurements of asymmetries in heavy baryon production that give us the\nprecise value of the dynamical parameter of string junction: the intercept of\nSJ-antiSJ Regge trajectory. Furthermore, the detail study of the gap\ndistributions in DD as well as the distributions of events with doubled\nmultiplicity, which both go on the level of one percent of production cross\nsection, seems also necessary.\n", "  Monogamy relations characterize the distributions of entanglement in\nmultipartite systems. We investigate monogamy relations related to the\nconcurrence $C$ and the entanglement of formation $E$. We present new\nentanglement monogamy relations satisfied by the $\\alpha$-th power of\nconcurrence for all $\\alpha\\geq2$, and the $\\alpha$-th power of the\nentanglement of formation for all $\\alpha\\geq\\sqrt{2}$. These monogamy\nrelations are shown to be tighter than the existing ones.\n", "  Entanglement monogamy is a fundamental property of multipartite entangled\nstates. We investigate the monogamy relations for multiqubit generalized\nW-class states. Analytical monogamy inequalities are obtained for the\nconcurrence of assistance, the entanglement of formation and the entanglement\nof assistance.\n", "  Universal thermodynamics for FRW model of the Universe bounded by\napparent/event horizon has been considered for massive gravity theory. Assuming\nHawking temperature and using the unified first law of thermodynamics on the\nhorizon, modified entropy on the horizon has been determined. For simple\nperfect fluid with constant equation of state, generalized second law of\nthermodynamics and thermodynamical equilibrium have been examined on both the\nhorizons.\n", "  The experiments reveal the strong narrow band in the spectra of the emission\nfrom Au-film on the Cu substrate. The emission was excited by red He-Ne laser\nin standard geometry for Raman back-scattering experiments. Some additional\nexperiments were made. The set of obtained data did not give enough arguments\nto make the final conclusion about the nature of this emission. The details of\nexperiments, results, and possible explanations are discussed.\n", "  The origin of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources (ULXs) in external galaxies whose\nX-ray luminosities exceed those of the brightest black holes in our Galaxy by\nhundreds and thousands of times is mysterious. The most popular models for the\nULXs involve either intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) or stellar-mass black\nholes accreting at super-Eddington rates. Here we review the ULX properties.\nTheir X-ray spectra indicate a presence of hot winds in their accretion disks\nsupposing the supercritical accretion. In recent years, new surprising results\nwere discovered in X-ray data, ULX-pulsars and high-velocity outflows up to 0.2\nc. They are also in accordance with the super-Eddington accretion. However, the\nstrongest evidences come from optical spectroscopy. The spectra of the ULX\ncounterparts are very similar to that of SS433, the only known supercritical\naccretor in our Galaxy. The spectra are apparently of WNL type (late nitrogen\nWolf-Rayet stars) or LBV (luminous blue variables) in their hot state, which\nare very scarce stellar objects. We find that the spectra do not originate from\nWNL/LBV type donors but from very hot winds from the accretion disks, which\nhave similar physical conditions as the stellar winds from these stars. The\nresults suggest that bona-fide ULXs must constitute a homogeneous class of\nobjects, which most likely have supercritical accretion disks.\n", "  Novel hollow-core THz waveguides featuring hyperuniform disordered reflectors\nare proposed, fabricated, and characterized. The reflector comprise\naperiodically positioned dielectric cylinders connected with dielectric\nbridges. The proposed waveguides are fabricated using a 3D stereolithography\nprinter. Optical properties of the fabricated waveguide are investigated\nnumerically using finite element method, as well as experimentally using\nTHz-TDS spectroscopy. The results confirm that proposed waveguides exhibit\nsizable photonic band gaps (20%) even when relatively low refractive index\ncontrast used (resin/air). Position of the band gaps can be easily tuned by\nvarying reflector geometrical parameters.\n", "  New forms of empirical formulae that provide an approximate description of\nthe decay of shock pressure with distance in hypervelocity impacts are\nproposed. These forms, which are intended for use in applications such as\nlarge-scale mantle convection models, are continuous and smooth from the point\nof impact to arbitrarily large distances, thereby avoiding the need to divide\nthe domain into different decay regimes and yielding the maximum pressure in a\nself-consistent way without resorting to the impedance-match solution.\nIndividual fits for different impact velocities as well as a tentative general\nfitting formula are given, especially for the case of dunite-on-dunite impacts.\nThe temperature effects resulting from the shock are estimated for different\ndecay models, and the differences between them are found to be substantial in\nsome cases, potentially leading to over- or underestimates of impact heating\nand melt production in modeling contexts like mantle convection, where such\nparameterizations are commonly used to represent giant impacts.\n", "  A Turmit is a Turing machine that works over a two-dimensional grid, that is,\nan agent that moves, reads and writes symbols over the cells of the grid. Its\nstate is an arrow and, depending on the symbol that it reads, it turns to the\nleft or to the right, switching the symbol at the same time. Several symbols\nare admitted, and the rule is specified by the turning sense that the machine\nhas over each symbol. Turmites are a generalization of Langtons ant, and they\npresent very complex and diverse behaviors. We prove that any Turmite, except\nfor those whose rule does not depend on the symbol, can simulate any Turing\nMachine. We also prove the P-completeness of prediction their future behavior\nby explicitly giving a log-space reduction from the Topological Circuit Value\nProblem. A similar result was already established for Langtons ant; here we use\na similar technique but prove a stronger notion of simulation, and for a more\ngeneral family.\n", "  Interfaces dominate heat conduction in nanostructured systems, and much work\nhas focused on methods to enhance interfacial conduction. These approaches\ngenerally address planar interfaces, where the heat flux vector is everywhere\nnormal to the interface. Here, we explore a nanostructured interface geometry\nthat uses nonplanar features to enhance the effective interfacial conductance\nbeyond what is possible with planar interfaces. This interface consists of\ninterdigitating Al pillars embedded within SiO2 with characteristic feature\nsize ranging from 100 nm to 800 nm. The total sidewall surface area is\nmodulated to highlight the impact of this additional channel by changing the\npillar-to-pillar pitch L_P between 1.6 um and 200 nm while maintaining the same\nAl:SiO2 fill fraction. Using optical pump-probe thermoreflectance measurements,\nwe show that the effective conductance of a ~65 nm thick fin layer\nmonotonically increases with decreasing L_P, and that the conductance for L_P =\n200 nm is more than twice the prediction for a layered stack with the same\nvolume ratio and a planar interface. Through a combination of Boltzmann\ntransport modeling and finite element calculations, we explore the impact of\nthe pitch L_P and the pillar aspect ratio on effective thermal conductance.\nThis analysis suggests that the concept of nanostructured interfaces can be\nextended to interfaces between diffusive and quasi-ballistic media in highly\nscaled devices. Our work proposes that the controlled texturing of interfaces\ncan facilitate interfacial conduction beyond the planar interface regime,\nopening new avenues for thermal management at the nanoscale.\n", "  We have fabricated indium-doped ZnO (IZO) nanowires (NWs) and carried out\n4-probe electrical-transport measurements at low temperatures. The NWs reveal\ncharge conduction behavior characteristic of disordered metals. In addition to\nthe $T$ dependence of resistance $R$, we have measured the magnetoresistances\n(MR) in perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields. Our $R(T)$ and MR data in\ndifferent $T$ intervals are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the\none- (1D), two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) weak-localization (WL) and the\nelectron-electron interaction (EEI) effects. In particular, a few\ndimensionality crossovers in the two effects are observed. These crossover\nphenomena are consistent with the model of a \"core-shell-like structure\" in\nindividual IZO NWs, where an outer shell of a thickness $t$ ($\\simeq$ 15-17 nm)\nis responsible for the quantum-interference transport. In the WL effect, as the\nelectron dephasing length $L_\\phi$ gradually decreases with increasing $T$ from\nthe lowest measurement temperatures, a 1D-to-2D dimensionality crossover takes\nplace around a characteristic temperature where $L_\\phi$ approximately equals\n$d$, an effective NW diameter which is slightly smaller than the geometric\ndiameter. As $T$ further increases, a 2D-to-3D dimensionality crossover occurs\naround another characteristic temperature where $L_\\phi$ approximately equals\n$t$ ($< d$). In the EEI effect, a 2D-to-3D dimensionality crossover takes place\nwhen the thermal diffusion length $L_T$ progressively decreases with increasing\n$T$ and approaches $t$. However, a crossover to the 1D EEI effect is not seen\nbecause $L_T < d$ even at $T$ = 1 K in our IZO NWs. Furthermore, we explain the\nvarious inelastic electron scattering processes which govern $L_\\phi$. This\nwork indicates that the surface-related conduction processes are essential to\ndoped semiconductor nanostructures.\n", "  A perturbation analysis has been conducted to evaluate the generation of\nhotspots inside an electrical loaded ceramic sample, which is assumed to have\nan Arrhenius-type conductivity. The results identified a critical size, above\nwhich a small temperature perturbations will be magnified and hotspots will be\ngenerated. It provides an estimate for the largest sample size suitable for\nflash sintering, beyond which hotspots are likely to form, resulting in\ninhomogeneous heating and sintering.\n", "  High-precision resistance noise measurements indicate that the epitaxial\nCoSi$_2$/Si hetero-structures at 150 K and 2 K (slightly above its\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$ of 1.54 K) exhibit an unusually\nlow 1/f noise level in the frequency range of 0.008-0.2 Hz. This corresponds to\nan upper limit of Hooge constant $\\gamma \\leq 3 \\times 10^{-6}$, about 100\ntimes lower than that of single-crystalline aluminum films on SiO$_2$ capped Si\nsubstrates. Supported by high-resolution cross-sectional transmission electron\nmicroscopy studies, our analysis reveals that the 1/f noise is dominated by\nexcess interfacial Si atoms and their dimer reconstruction induced fluctuators.\nUnbonded orbitals (i.e., dangling bonds) on excess Si atoms are intrinsically\nrare at the epitaxial CoSi$_2$/Si(100) interface, giving limited\ntrapping-detrapping centers for localized charges. With its excellent\nnormal-state properties, CoSi$_2$ has been used in silicon-based integrated\ncircuits for decades. The intrinsically low noise properties discovered in this\nwork could be utilized for developing quiet qubits and scalable superconducting\ncircuits for future quantum computing.\n", "  We present a theory of the nonlinear growth of zonal flows in magnetized\nplasma turbulence, by the mechanism of secondary instability. The theory is\nderived for general magnetic geometry, and is thus applicable to both tokamaks\nand stellarators. The predicted growth rate is shown to compare favorably with\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, with the error scaling as expected with the\nsmall parameter of the theory.\n", "  Convexity and convex functions play an important role in theoretical physics.\nTo initiate a study of the possible uses of convex functions in General\nRelativity, we discuss the consequences of a spacetime $(M,g_{\\mu \\nu})$ or an\ninitial data set $(\\Sigma, h_{ij}, K_{ij})$ admitting a suitably defined convex\nfunction. We show how the existence of a convex function on a spacetime places\nrestrictions on the properties of the spacetime geometry.\n", "  A novel capsule target design to improve the hot-spot pressure in the\nhigh-adiabat implosion for inertial confinement fusion is proposed, where a\nlayer of comparatively high-density material is used as a pusher between the\nfuel and the ablator. This design is based on our theoretical finding of the\nstagnation scaling laws, which indicates that the hot spot pressure can be\nimproved by increasing the kinetic energy density $\\rho_d V_{imp}^2/2$\n($\\rho_d$ is the shell density when the maximum shell velocity is reached,\n$V_{imp}$ is the implosion velocity.) of the shell. The proposed design uses\nthe high density pusher to enhance the shell density $\\rho_d$ so that the hot\nspot pressure is improved. Radio-hydrodynamic simulations show that the hot\nspot pressure of the design reaches the requirement for ignition even driven by\na very high-adiabat short-duration two-shock pulse. The design is hopeful to\nsimultaneously overcome the two major obstacles to achieving ignition--ablative\ninstability and laser-plasma instability.\n", "  Global magnetic fields of flare stars can evolve rapidly, in time scale of\nhundreds or dozens of days. We believe, that such changes result from rapid\nsuperposition of local magnetic fields generated by differential rotation of\nthose stars. We discuss possible mechanisms of generation and dissipation of\nlocal and global magnetic fields in sample flare stars OT Ser and YZ CMi. We\npropose mechanism of magnetic braking of these stars, in which differential\nrotation generates local magnetic fields, and eventually energy accumulated in\nlocal fields is radiated away by flares. We obtained estimates of the\nrotational energy and the energy of the global magnetic field of OT Ser and YZ\nCMi. We also show that the energy of the local magnetic fields dissipated\nduring superflare of YZ CMi on 9 February 2008 (UT 20:22:00) did not influence\nthe global magnetic field of this star.\n", "  This thesis tackles the vast question of generating accelerated periods of\nexpansion of the universe. Models loosely related were developed in the early\nand late universe. In the early universe, generalizations of the Schwinger\neffect were developed in curved (de Sitter) space and some backreaction effects\nwere estimated. In the late universe, a fractal model was developed and\nconfronted to supernovae data. This relies on the idea of an accelerated\nexpanding universe being nothing but a mirage due to inhomogeneities disposed\nin a fractal (in this particular model) way. Finally a model of interacting\nenergy based on an Einstein-Cartan gravitational theory was phenomenologically\ninvestigated.\n", "  We study the electronic band structure in the K/K' valleys of the Brillouin\nzone of monolayer WSe2 and MoSe2 by optical reflection and photoluminescence\nspectroscopy on dual-gated field-effect devices. Our experiment reveals the\ndistinct spin polarization in the conduction bands of these compounds by a\nsystematic study of the doping dependence of the A and B excitonic resonances.\nElectrons in the highest-energy valence band and the lowest-energy conduction\nband have antiparallel spins in monolayer WSe2, and parallel spins in monolayer\nMoSe2. The spin splitting is determined to be hundreds of meV for the valence\nbands and tens of meV for the conduction bands, which are in good agreement\nwith first principles calculations. These values also suggest that both n- and\np-type WSe2 and MoSe2 can be relevant for spin- and valley-based applications\n", "  In these proceedings, we present recent results of $\\Upsilon$ measurements in\nheavy-ion collisions from the STAR experiment at RHIC. Nuclear modification\nfactors ($R_{AA}$) for $\\Upsilon(1S)$ and $\\Upsilon(1S+2S+3S)$ in U+U\ncollisions at \\sqrtsNN\\ = 193 GeV are measured through the di-electron channel\nand compared to those in Au+Au collisions at \\sqrtsNN\\ = 200 GeV and Pb+Pb\ncollisions at \\sqrtsNN\\ = 2.76 TeV. The ratio between the $\\Upsilon(2S+3S)$ and\n$\\Upsilon(1S)$ yields in Au+Au collisions at \\sqrtsNN\\ = 200 GeV is measured in\nthe di-muon channel and compared to those in p+p collisions and in Pb+Pb\ncollisions at \\sqrtsNN\\ = 2.76 TeV. Prospects for future $\\Upsilon$\nmeasurements with the STAR experiment are also discussed.\n", "  Electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) possess both\nthe valley and spin degree of freedom. These internal quantum degrees of\nfreedom have provided an ideal laboratory for exploring both new physical\nphenomena and electronics and photonics applications. Valley- and\nspin-dependent optical and electrical properties, originated from Berry\ncurvature effects, have been recently demonstrated. Such Berry curvature\neffects, together with strong spin-orbit interactions, can further generate\nunconventional Landau levels (LLs) under a perpendicular magnetic field that\nsupport valley- and spinpolarized chiral edge states in the quantum Hall\nregime. The unique LL structure, however, has not been demonstrated in TMDs.\nHere we report the observation of fully valley- and spin-polarized LLs in\nhigh-quality WSe2 monolayers achieved using a van der Waals heterostructure\ndevice platform. Handedness-resolved optical reflection spectroscopy has been\napplied to probe the inter-LL transitions at individual valleys. The LL\nstructure has been constructed. A doping-induced mass renormalization driven by\nthe strong Coulomb interactions has also been observed. Our results open the\ndoor for studies of the unconventional LL physics and quantum Hall effect in\nmonolayer TMDs.\n", "  The intrinsically rectifying-resistive switching (IR-RS) has been regarded as\nan effective way to address the crosstalk issue, due to the Schottky diodes\nformed at the metal/oxide interfaces in the ON states to suppress the sneak\ncurrent at reverse biases. In this letter, we report for the first time another\ntype of IR-RS that is related to the built-in homojunction. The IR-RS study was\nusually limited to macroscopic samples with micron-order pad-type electrodes,\nwhile this work is on NiO nanodots fabricated with ultrathin\nanodic-aluminum-oxide templates and acting as nanoscaled analogs of real\ndevices. The NiO nanodots show high storage density and high uniformity, and\nthe IR-RS behaviors are of good device performances in terms of retention,\nendurance, switching ratio and rectification ratio. The feasibility of the\nIR-RS for selection device-free memory application has been demonstrated, by\ncalculating the maximum crossbar array size under the worst-case scenario to be\n3 Mbit.\n", "  Graphene is an ideal material for fabricating atomically thin nanometre\nspaced electrodes. Recently, carbon-based nanoelectrodes have been employed to\ncreate single-molecule transistors and phase change memory devices. In spite of\nthe significant recent interest in their use in a range of nanoscale devices\nfrom phase change memories to molecular electronics, the operating and scaling\nlimits of these electrodes are completely unknown. In this paper, we report on\nour observations of consistent voltage driven resistance switching in sub-5 nm\ngraphene nanogaps. We find that we are able to reversibly cycle between a low\nand a high resistance state using feedback-controlled voltage ramps.We\nattribute this unexplained switching in the gap to the formation and breakdown\nof carbon filaments.By increasing the gap, we find that such intrinsic\nresistance switching of graphene nanogaps imposes a scaling limit of 10 nm\n(approx.) on the gap-size for devices with operating voltages of 1 to 2 volts.\n", "  Flexible and transparent electronics presents a new era of electronic\ntechnologies. Ubiquitous applications involve wearable electronics, biosensors,\nflexible transparent displays, radio-frequency identifications (RFIDs),\netc.Zinc oxide (ZnO) and related materials are the most commonly used inorganic\nsemiconductors in flexible and transparent devices, owing to their high\nelectrical performance, together with low processing temperature and good\noptical transparency.In this paper, we review recent advances in flexible and\ntransparent thin-film transistors (TFTs) based on ZnO and related\nmaterials.After a brief introduction, the main progresses on the preparation of\neach component (substrate, electrodes, channel and dielectrics) are summarized\nand discussed. Then, the effect of mechanical bending on electrical performance\nwas highlighted. Finally, we suggest the challenges and opportunities in future\ninvestigations.\n", "  P-n junctions based on vertically stacked single or few layer transition\nmetal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted substantial scientific interest.\nDue to the propensity of TMDCs to show exclusively one type of conductivity, n-\nor p-type, heterojunctions of different materials are typically fabricated to\nproduce diode-like current rectification and photovoltaic response. Recently,\nartificial, stable and substitutional doping of MoS2 into n- and p-type has\nbeen demonstrated. MoS2 is an interesting material to use for optoelectronic\napplications due to the potential of low-cost production in large quantities,\nstrong light-matter interactions and chemical stability. Here we report the\ncharacterization of the optoelectronic properties of vertical homojunctions\nmade by stacking few-layer flakes of MoS2:Fe (n-type) and MoS2:Nb (p-type). The\njunctions exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.7 %, a maximum open\ncircuit voltage of 0.51 V, they are stable in air and their rectification\ncharacteristics and photovoltaic response are in excellent agreement to the\nShockley diode model. The gate-tunability of the maximum output power, the\nideality factor and the shunt resistance indicate that the dark current is\ndominated by trap-assisted recombination and that the photocurrent collection\ndepends strongly on the spatial extent of the space charge region. We\ndemonstrate a response time faster than 80 ms and highlight the potential to\nintegrate such devices into quasi-transparent and flexible optoelectronics.\n", "  Because the conductivity of organic semiconductors is very low, a useful\nmodel for the organic diode consists of treating the organic layer as an\ninsulator, an approximation often referred to as the metal-insulator-metal\n(MIM) model. Moreover, the dominant charge carrier injection process is\ndiffusion, so that a modified Schottky theory can be used to derive a simple\nanalytical equation for the current voltage curve of the diode. Here, we\ncarried out a full analysis of the MIM model for the organic diode. We show\nthat Schottky theory is only valid when charge injection is poor, that is, for\nhigh injection barriers. When the injection barrier is lowered, the current\ngiven by Schottky theory is still valid in the weak injection regime, when the\napplied potential is lower than the diffusion potential. However, it becomes\nlargely overestimated in the strong injection regime. We also show that in the\nstrong injection regime, the current given by the MIM model merges with\nMott-Gurnery space-charge-limited regime.\n", "  Precise localization of nanoparticles within a cell is crucial to the\nunderstanding of cell-particle interactions and has broad applications in\nnanomedicine. Here, we report a proof-of-principle experiment for imaging\nindividual functionalized nanoparticles within a mammalian cell by correlative\nmicroscopy. Using a chemically-fixed, HeLa cell labeled with fluorescent\ncore-shell nanoparticles as a model system, we implemented a graphene-oxide\nlayer as a substrate to significantly reduce background scattering. We\nidentified cellular features of interest by fluorescence microscopy, followed\nby scanning transmission X-ray tomography to localize the particles in 3D, and\nptychographic coherent diffractive imaging of the fine features in the region\nat high resolution. By tuning the X-ray energy to the Fe L-edge, we\ndemonstrated sensitive detection of nanoparticles composed of a 22 nm magnetic\nFe3O4 core encased by a 25-nm-thick fluorescent silica (SiO2) shell. These\nfluorescent core-shell nanoparticles act as landmarks and offer clarity in a\ncellular context. Our correlative microscopy results confirmed a subset of\nparticles to be fully internalized, and high-contrast ptychographic images\nshowed two oxidation states of individual nanoparticles with a resolution of\n~16.5 nm. The ability to precisely localize individual fluorescent\nnanoparticles within mammalian cells will expand our understanding of the\nstructure/function relationships for functionalized nanoparticles.\n", "  Blazars are an extreme subclass of active galactic nuclei. Their rapid\nvariability, luminous brightness, superluminal motion, and high and variable\npolarization are probably due to a beaming effect. However, this beaming factor\n(or Doppler factor) is very difficult to measure. Currently, a good way to\nestimate it is to use the time scale of their radio flares. In this $Letter$,\nwe use multiwavelength data and Doppler factors reported in the literatures for\na sample of 86 flaring blazars detected by Fermi to compute their intrinsic\nmultiwavelength data and intrinsic spectral energy distributions, and\ninvestigate the correlations among observed and intrinsic data. Quite\ninterestingly, intrinsic data show a positive correlation between luminosity\nand peak frequency, in contrast with the behavior of observed data, and a\ntighter correlation between $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and the lower energy ones.\nFor flaring blazars detected by Fermi, we conclude that (1) Observed emissions\nare strongly beamed; (2) The anti-correlation between luminosity and peak\nfrequency from the observed data is an apparent result, the correlation between\nintrinsic data being positive; and (3) Intrinsic $\\gamma$-ray luminosity is\nstrongly correlated with other intrinsic luminosities.\n", "  Multiplayer online battle arena has become a popular game genre. It also\nreceived increasing attention from our research community because they provide\na wealth of information about human interactions and behaviors. A major problem\nis extracting meaningful patterns of activity from this type of data, in a way\nthat is also easy to interpret. Here, we propose to exploit tensor\ndecomposition techniques, and in particular Non-negative Tensor Factorization,\nto discover hidden correlated behavioral patterns of play in a popular game:\nLeague of Legends. We first collect the entire gaming history of a group of\nabout one thousand players, totaling roughly $100K$ matches. By applying our\nmethodological framework, we then separate players into groups that exhibit\nsimilar features and playing strategies, as well as similar temporal\ntrajectories, i.e., behavioral progressions over the course of their gaming\nhistory: this will allow us to investigate how players learn and improve their\nskills.\n", "  Cytosine methylation has been found to play a crucial role in various\nbiological processes, including a number of human diseases. The detection of\nthis small modification remains challenging. In this work, we computationally\nexplore the possibility of detecting methylated DNA strands through direct\nelectrical conductance measurements. Using density functional theory and the\nLandauer-Buttiker method, we study the electronic properties and charge\ntransport through an eight base-pair methylated DNA strand and its native\ncounterpart. We first analyze the effect of cytosine methylation on the\ntight-binding parameters of two DNA strands and then model the transmission of\nthe electrons and conductance through the strands both with and without\ndecoherence. We find that the main difference of the tight-binding parameters\nbetween the native DNA and the methylated DNA lies in the on-site energies of\n(methylated) cytosine bases. The intra- and inter- strand hopping integrals\nbetween two nearest neighboring guanine base and (methylated) cytosine base\nalso change with the addition of the methyl groups. Our calculations show that\nin the phase-coherent limit, the transmission of the methylated strand is close\nto the native strand when the energy is nearby the highest occupied molecular\norbital level and larger than the native strand by 5 times in the bandgap. The\ntrend in transmission also holds in the presence of the decoherence with the\nsame rate. The lower conductance for the methylated strand in the experiment is\nsuggested to be caused by the more stable structure due to the introduction of\nthe methyl groups. We also study the role of the exchangecorrelation functional\nand the effect of contact coupling by choosing coupling strengths ranging from\nweak to strong coupling limit.\n", "  MCBooster is a header-only, C++11-compliant library that provides routines to\ngenerate and perform calculations on large samples of phase space Monte Carlo\nevents. To achieve superior performance, MCBooster is capable to perform most\nof its calculations in parallel using CUDA- and OpenMP-enabled devices.\nMCBooster is built on top of the Thrust library and runs on Linux systems. This\ncontribution summarizes the main features of MCBooster. A basic description of\nthe user interface and some examples of applications are provided, along with\nmeasurements of performance in a variety of environments\n", "  We review our recent work on a construction of spherically symmetric global\nsolutions to the Einstein--scalar field system with large bounded variation\nnorms and large Bondi masses. We show that similar ideas, together with\nChristodoulou's short pulse method, allow us to prove the following result:\nGiven $M_i \\geq M_f>0$ and $\\epsilon>0$, there exists a spherically symmetric\n(black hole) solution to the Einstein--scalar field system such that up to an\nerror of size $\\epsilon$, the initial Bondi mass is $M_i$ and the final Bondi\nmass is $M_f$. Moreover, if one assumes a continuity property of the final\nBondi mass (which in principle follows from known techniques in the\nliterature), then for $M_i>M_f>0$, the above result holds without an\n$\\epsilon$-error.\n", "  In this paper we have solved the nonrelativistic form of the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation in the momentum-helicity space by inserting a\nspin-dependent quark-antiquark potential model numerically. To this end, we\nhave used the momentum-helicity basis states for describing a nonrelativistic\nreduction of one gluon exchange potential. Then we have calculated the mass\nspectrum of the charmonium $\\psi(c\\bar{c})$, and finally we have compared the\nresults with the another theoretical results and experimental data.\n", "  Electron ptychography has seen a recent surge of interest for phase sensitive\nimaging at atomic or near-atomic resolution. However, applications are so far\nmainly limited to radiation-hard samples because the required doses are too\nhigh for imaging biological samples at high resolution. We propose the use of\nnon-convex, Bayesian optimization to overcome this problem and reduce the dose\nrequired for successful reconstruction by two orders of magnitude compared to\nprevious experiments. We suggest to use this method for imaging single\nbiological macromolecules at cryogenic temperatures and demonstrate 2D\nsingle-particle reconstructions from simulated data with a resolution of 7.9\n\\AA$\\,$ at a dose of 20 $e^- / \\AA^2$. When averaging over only 15 low-dose\ndatasets, a resolution of 4 \\AA$\\,$ is possible for large macromolecular\ncomplexes. With its independence from microscope transfer function, direct\nrecovery of phase contrast and better scaling of signal-to-noise ratio,\ncryo-electron ptychography may become a promising alternative to Zernike\nphase-contrast microscopy.\n", "  It is shown that Maxwell's equations in media without source can be written\nas a contact Hamiltonian vector field restricted to a Legendre submanifold,\nwhere this submanifold is in a fiber space of a bundle and is generated by\neither electromagnetic energy functional or co-energy functional. Then, it\nturns out that Legendre duality for this system gives the induction oriented\nformulation of Maxwell's equations and field intensity oriented one. Also,\ninformation geometry of the Maxwell fields is introduced and discussed.\n", "  The superconducting energy gap in $\\rm DyNi_2B_2C$ has been investigated\nusing a point-contact technique based on the Andreev reflection from a normal\n(N)-superconductor (S) boundary, where N is Ag. The observed differential\nresistance $dV/dI$ is well described by the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK)\ntheory based on the BSC density of states with zero broadening parameter.\nTypically, the intensity of the gap structure amounts to several percentage of\nthe normal state resistance, which is an order of magnitude less than predicted\nby the theory. For $\\rm DyNi_2B_2C$ with $T_c<T_N$ (the Neel temperature), we\nfound gap values satisfying the ratio of $2\\Delta_0/k_BT_c=3.63\\pm 0.05$\nsimilar to other superconducting nickel-borocarbides, both nonmagnetic and\nmagnetic with $T_c\\geq T_N$. The superconducting gap nonlinearity is\nsuperimposed on the antiferromagnetic structure in $dV/dI(V)$ which is\nsuppressed at the magnetic field of the order of 3T applied nominally in the\n$ab$-plane and temperature $\\geq 11~K$. The observed superconducting properties\ndepend on the exact composition and structure at the surface of the crystal.\n", "  Results will be shown from the ASTRONEU array developed and operated in the\noutskirts of Patras, Greece. An array of 9 scintillator detectors and 3\nantennas were deployed to study Extensive Air Showers (EAS) as a tool for\ncalibrating an underwater neutrino telescope, possible other applications in\nmuon tomography, education purposes, and last but not least, the detection of\nair showers via their electromagnetic signature. This is the first stage of a\ntotal of 24 scintillator counters and 6 RF antennas to complete the array. In\nthis work, results with regard to the electromagnetic detection of showers will\nbe shown. The method of operation and analysis will be presented. The purpose\nof this project was to demonstrate the adequacy of the method to detect cosmic\nevents even in the presence of high urban electromagnetic background, using\nnoise filters, timing, signal polarization, and eventual comparison with well\nunderstood event reconstruction using the scintillator detectors. The results\nindicate that cosmic showers were detected and the method can be used for the\ncomplete array.\n", "  An asteroid impact is a low probability event with potentially devastating\nconsequences. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR)\nsoftware tool calculates whether a colliding asteroid experiences an airburst\nor surface impact and calculates effect severity as well as reach on the global\nmap. To calculate the consequences of an impact in terms of loss of human life,\nnew vulnerability models are derived that connect the severity of seven impact\neffects (strong winds, overpressure shockwave, thermal radiation, seismic\nshaking, ejecta deposition, cratering and tsunamis) with lethality to human\npopulations. With the new vulnerability models ARMOR estimates casualties of an\nimpact under consideration of the local population and geography. The presented\nalgorithms and models are employed in two case studies to estimate total\ncasualties as well as the damage contribution of each impact effect. The case\nstudies highlight that aerothermal effects are most harmful except for deep\nwater impacts, where tsunamis are the dominant hazard. Continental shelves\nserve a protective function against the tsunami hazard caused by impactors on\nthe shelf. Furthermore, the calculation of impact consequences facilitates\nasteroid risk estimation to better characterize a given threat and the concept\nof risk as well as its applicability to the asteroid impact scenario are\npresented.\n", "  Integrated polarimetric receivers have the potential to define a new\ngeneration of lightweight, high-performance instrumentation for remote sensing.\nTo date, on-chip polarization-selective devices such as polarizing\nbeam-splitters have yet to even approach the necessary performance, due to\nfundamental design limitations. Here, we propose, simulate and experimentally\ndemonstrate a method for realizing spatially-mapped birefringence onto\nintegrated photonic circuits, deemed topographically anisotropic photonics.\nWith this robust and widely tolerant approach, devices can be constructed with\nstrongly polarization-dependent modal properties and minimal wavelength\ndependence. An integrated polarizing beam-splitter (PBS) is realized with\nunprecedented performance: a record 0.52 octaves of fractional bandwidth (116\nTHz), maximum insertion loss of 1.4 +/- 0.8 dB, and a minimum extinction ratio\nof 16 +/- 3 dB, pushing it into the realm of wideband spectroscopy and imaging\napplications. Additionally, novel photonic structures such as\npolarization-selective beam-taps and polarization-selective microring\nresonators are demonstrated, enabling new on-chip polarimetric receiver\narchitectures.\n", "  Colloidal Laves phases (LPs) of $MgCu_2$ type are promising precursors for\ndiamond structure photonic materials. They have been predicted for hard sphere\nbinary mixtures, but not yet observed. We here report a time resolved static\nlight scattering study on their formation in a binary mixture of buoyant\nexperimental hard sphere approximants (size ratio $\\Gamma=0.77$, molar fraction\nof small spheres $x_S = 0.76$) for volume fractions between melting and the\nglass transition. In line with theoretical expectation, all samples form LPs of\n$MgZn_2$ structure on the time scale of weeks to months. $MgNi_2$ structures\nare absent, $MgCu_2$ structures and randomly stacked LPs prevail at elevated\nvolume fraction. The addition of small amounts of non-adsorbing polymer\nswitches the interaction to depletion attractive and results in significantly\naccelerated crystallization kinetics and improved crystal quality.\n", "  We demonstrate that temporal observables, which are sensitive to a system's\nhistory (as opposed to its state), implicate entangled histories. We exemplify\nprotocols for measuring such observables, and algorithms for predicting the\n(stochastic) outcomes of such measurements. Temporal observables allow us to\ndefine, and potentially to measure, precise mathematical consequences of\nintrinsically disjoint, yet mutually accessible, branches within the evolution\nof a pure quantum state.\n", "  Excitonic states in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have\nbeen the subject of extensive recent interest. Their intrinsic properties can,\nhowever, be obscured due to the influence of inhomogeneity in the external\nenvironment. Here we report methods for fabricating high quality TMDC\nmonolayers with narrow photoluminescence (PL) linewidth approaching the\nintrinsic limit. We find that encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)\nsharply reduces the PL linewidth, and that passivation of the oxide substrate\nby an alkyl monolayer further decreases the linewidth and also minimizes the\ncharged exciton (trion) peak. The combination of these sample preparation\nmethods results in much reduced spatial variation in the PL emission, with a\nfull-width-at-half-maximum as low as 1.7 meV. Analysis of the PL line shape\nyields a homogeneous width of 1.43$\\pm$0.08 meV and inhomogeneous broadening of\n1.1$\\pm$0.3 meV.\n", "  Considering the mass constraint from the resent pulsar observations, we study\nthe properties of neutron stars including hyperons and quarks explicitly. Using\nthe chiral quark-meson coupling model with relativistic Hartree-Fock\napproximation, the equation of state (EoS) for hadronic matter is calculated by\ntaking into account the strange ($\\sigma^{\\ast}$ and $\\phi$) mesons as well as\nthe light non-strange ($\\sigma$, $\\omega$, $\\vec{\\rho}$, and $\\vec{\\pi}$)\nmesons in SU(3) flavor symmetry. On the other hand, the EoS for quark matter is\nconstructed with the simple MIT bag or the flavor-SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel, and we investigate the effect of the hadron-quark coexistence on the\nneutron-star properties, imposing smooth crossover or Gibbs criterion for\nchemical equilibrium. The mass-radius relation of a neutron star, as well as\nphysical quantities such as EoSs, particle fractions, and the speed of sound in\nmatter are presented. We find that, in order to prevent the quark appearance at\nvery low densities, the stiff hadronic EoS should be required under both of the\nhadron-quark crossover and the first-order phase transition.\n", "  We study nonautonomous mappings of the plane by means of spaces of initial\nconditions. First we introduce the notion of a space of initial conditions for\nnonautonomous systems and we study the basic properties of general equations\nthat have spaces of initial conditions. Then, we consider the minimization of\nspaces of initial conditions for nonautonomous systems and we show that if a\nnonautonomous mapping of the plane with a space of initial conditions, and\nunbounded degree growth, has zero algebraic entropy, then it must be one of the\ndiscrete Painlev\\'{e} equations in the Sakai classification.\n", "  There have been several surprising developments in our understanding of\nsymbiotic binary stars and nova eruptions over the last decade or so based on\nmultiwavelength data. For example, symbiotic stars without shell burning on\ntheir white dwarfs have been revealed through their X-ray emission, UV excess,\nand UV variability. These purely accretion powered symbiotic stars have much\nweaker optical emission lines than those with shell burning, and are therefore\nharder to discover. Yet they may be as numerous as symbiotic stars with shell\nburning. Interestingly, both types of symbiotic stars are capable of driving\nstrong outflows, leading to colliding wind X-ray emission and spatially\nresolved jets. For nova eruptions, the most surprising discovery has been that\nthey are capable of particle acceleration as evidenced by Fermi detection of\nnovae as transient GeV gamma-ray sources. For nova eruptions in cataclysmic\nvariables, this implicates internal shocks, between a slow, dense outflow and a\nfast outflow or wind. Other signatures of shocks include thermal X-rays and\nnon-thermal radio emissions, and a substantial fraction of optical emission may\nbe shock-powered in the early phase of novae. Radio (V959 Mon) and HST (V959\nMon and T Pyx) images of nova shells within a few years of their respective\neruptions suggest that the ejecta from a nova may commonly consist of an\nequatorial ring and a bipolar outflow.\n", "  Inspired by recent studies of various two-dimensional (2D) metals such as Au,\nFe and Ag, we study the growth of two-dimensional gold patches in graphene\npores by density-functional theory. We find that at room temperature gold atoms\ndiffuse readily on top of both graphene and two-dimensional gold with energy\nbarriers less than $0.5$ eV. Furthermore, gold atoms move without barriers from\nthe top of graphene to its edge and from the top of 2D gold to its edge. The\nenergy barriers are absent even at the interface of 2D gold and graphene, so\nthat the gold atoms move effortlessly across the interface. We hope our\ndemonstration for the propensity of diffusing gold atoms to grow 2D gold\npatches in graphene pores will inspire the fabrication of these patches\nexperimentally.\n", "  In a recent comment (arXiv:1607.06081), Falaye et al. claim that there are\ncertain flaws in our publication (Phys. Rev. B, 78, 195427 (2008)). We point\nout that our results, in particular the analytic derivation of the energy\nspectrum of a circular graphene quantum dot exposed to a perpendicular magnetic\nfield, are correct and equivalent to the result of Falaye et al. A misleading\nnotation error is corrected.\n", "  While experiments with one or two quantum emitters have become routine in\nvarious laboratories, scalable platforms for efficient optical coupling of many\nquantum systems remain elusive. To address this issue, we report on chip-based\nsystems made of one-dimensional subwavelength dielectric waveguides\n(nanoguides) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. After discussing\nthe design and fabrication requirements, we present data on coherent linear and\nnonlinear spectroscopy of single molecules coupled to a nanoguide mode. Our\nresults show that external microelectrodes as well as optical beams can be used\nto switch the propagation of light in a nanoguide via the Stark effect and a\nnonlinear optical process, respectively. The presented nanoguide architecture\npaves the way for the investigation of many-body phenomena and polaritonic\nstates and can be readily extended to more complex geometries for the\nrealization of quantum integrated photonic circuits.\n", "  For the last decades, multiple international facilities have developed\nRadioactive-Ion Beams (RIB) to measure reaction processes including exotic\nnuclei. These measurements coupled with an accurate theoretical model of the\nreaction enable us to infer information about the structure of these nuclei.\nThe partial-wave expansion provides a precise description of two-body\ncollisions but has a large computational cost. To cope with this issue, the\neikonal approximation is a powerful tool as it reduces the computational time\nand still describes the quantum effects observed in reaction observables.\nHowever, its range of validity is restricted to high energy and to forward\nscattering angles. In this work, we analyse the extension of the eikonal\napproximation to lower energies and larger angles through the implementation of\ntwo corrections. These aim to improve the treatment of the nuclear and Coulomb\ninteractions within the eikonal model. The first correction is based on an\nexpansion of the $T$-matrix while the second relies on a semi-classical\napproach. They permit to better account for the deflection of the projectile by\nthe target, which is neglected in the standard eikonal model. The gain in\naccuracy of each correction is evaluated through the analyses of angular cross\nsections computed with the standard eikonal model, its corrections and the\npartial-wave expansion. These analyses have been performed for tightly bound\nprojectiles ($^{10}\\mathrm{Be}$) from intermediate energies (67 MeV/nucleon)\ndown to energies of interest of future RIB facilities such as HIE-ISOLDE and\nReA12 at MSU (10 MeV/nucleon).\n", "  We have investigated a THz detection scheme based on mixing of electrical\nsignals in a voltage-dependent capacitance made out of suspended graphene. We\nhave analyzed both coherent and incoherent detection regimes and compared their\nperformance with the state of the art. Using a high-amplitude local oscillator,\nwe anticipate potential for quantum limited detection in the coherent mode. The\nsensitivity stems from the extraordinary mechanical and electrical properties\nof atomically thin graphene or graphene-related 2D materials.\n", "  Northwest Africa (NWA) 5958 is a carbonaceous chondrite found in Morocco in\n2009. Preliminary chemical and isotopic data leading to its initial\nclassification as C3.0 ungrouped have prompted us to conduct a multi-technique\nstudy of this meteorite and present a general description here. The petrography\nand chemistry of NWA 5958 is most similar to a CM chondrite, with a low degree\nof aqueous alteration, apparently under oxidizing conditions, and evidence of a\nsecond, limited alteration episode manifested by alteration fronts. The oxygen\nisotopic composition, with $\\Delta^{17}$O = -4.3 $\\permil$, is more 16O-rich\nthan all CM chondrites, indicating, along with other compositional arguments, a\nseparate parent body of origin. We suggest that NWA 5958 be reclassified as an\nungrouped carbonaceous chondrite related to the CM group.\n", "  Recent submillimeter and far-infrared wavelength observations of absorption\nin the rotational ground-state lines of various simple molecules against\ndistant Galactic continuum sources have opened the possibility of studying the\nchemistry of diffuse molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to\ncalculate abundances, the column densities of molecular and atomic hydrogen,\nHI, must be known. We aim at determining the atomic hydrogen column densities\nfor diffuse clouds located on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent\nhigh-mass star-forming regions that were intensely studied with the HIFI\ninstrument onboard Herschel. Based on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ\nthe 21 cm HI absorption-line technique to construct profiles of the HI opacity\nversus radial velocity toward our target sources. These profiles are combined\nwith lower resolution archival data of extended HI emission to calculate the HI\ncolumn densities of the individual clouds along the sight lines. We employ\nBayesian inference to estimate the uncertainties of the derived quantities. Our\nstudy delivers reliable estimates of the atomic hydrogen column density for a\nlarge number of diffuse molecular clouds at various Galactocentric distances.\nTogether with column densities of molecular hydrogen derived from its\nsurrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements can be used to characterize the\nclouds and investigate the dependence of their chemistry on the molecular\nfraction, for example.\n", "  A quantum memory is a system that enables transfer, storage, and retrieval of\noptical quantum states by ON/OFF switching of the control signal in each stages\nof the memory. In particular, it is known that, for perfect transfer of a\nsingle-photon state, appropriate shaping of the input pulse is required.\nHowever, in general, such a desirable pulse shape has a complicated form, which\nwould be hard to generate in practice. In this paper, for a wide class of\nlinear quantum memory systems, we develop a method that reduces the complexity\nof the input pulse shape of a single-photon while maintaining the perfect state\ntransfer. The key idea is twofold; (i) the control signal is allowed to vary\ncontinuously in time to introduce an additional degree of freedom, and then\n(ii) an optimal control problem is formulated to design a simple-formed input\npulse and the corresponding control signal. Numerical simulations are conducted\nfor Lambda-type atomic media and a networked atomic ensembles, to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n", "  ThCr2Si2-type phosphide ACo2P2 (A=Rare earth elements) has the same structure\nas iron arsenides, but their magnetic behaviors are quite distinct. In this\npaper, we for the first time grew a series of La1-xCexCo2P2 single crystals\n(x=0.0 to1.0), and made structural and magnetic characterizations. This allows\nus to carry out a careful investigation on the evolution of magnetism with\ncerium content and build a magnetic phase diagram. We found that the\nintroduction of cerium induces a rapid decrease of c-axis and a change from\nferromagnetic (FM) to antiferromagnetic (AFM) states. By employing\nfirst-principles band-structure calculations, we identify the formation of P-P\nbonding with the shortening of c-axis, which effectively drives an increase of\nAFM interaction and eventually leads to AFM ordering in the high doping region.\nThe present study may shed light on the interplay between the structural\ncollapsing and electronic/magnetic properties in 122 iron pnictides.\n", "  We discuss some recent results obtained in the study of strong\nquark-antiquark interactions in the presence of intense external magnetic\nfields by means of lattice QCD simulations. We confirm previous findings and\nshow that both at zero and finite temperature the external field induces\nanisotropies in the static quark potential. An in-depth study suggests that the\neffects are essentially due to the variation of the string tension whose\nangular dependence can be nicely parametrized by the first allowed term in a\nFourier expansion. In the confined phase at high temperature, we observe that\nthe suppression of the string tension is enhanced as the strength of the\nexternal field increases. Our results support the idea that the loss of\nconfining properties is the dominant effect related to the decrease of $T_c$ as\na function of $B$.\n", "  We study phase transitions in classical spin ice at nonzero magnetization, by\nintroducing a mean-field theory designed to capture the interplay between\nconfinement and topological constraints. The method is applied to a model of\nspin ice in an applied magnetic field along the [100] crystallographic\ndirection and yields a phase diagram containing the Coulomb phase as well as a\nset of magnetization plateaux. We argue that the lobe structure of the phase\ndiagram, strongly reminiscent of the Bose-Hubbard model, is generic to Coulomb\nspin liquids.\n", "  In this paper, we give a correspondence between the Berezin-Toeplitz and the\ncomplex Weyl quantizations of the torus $ \\mathbb{T}^2$. To achieve this, we\nuse the correspondence between the Berezin-Toeplitz and the complex Weyl\nquantizations of the complex plane and a relation between the Berezin-Toeplitz\nquantization of a periodic symbol on the real phase space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and\nthe Berezin-Toeplitz quantization of a symbol on the torus $ \\mathbb{T}^2 $.\n", "  We consider a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that\ndescribes an age-structured population inhabiting several temporally varying\npatches. We prove existence and uniqueness of solution and analyze its\nlarge-time behavior in cases when the environment is constant and when it\nchanges periodically. A pivotal assumption is that individuals can disperse and\nthat each patch can be reached from every other patch, directly or through\nseveral intermediary patches. We introduce the net reproductive operator and\ncharacteristic equations for time-independent and periodical models and prove\nthat permanency is defined by the net reproductive rate for the whole system.\nIf the net reproductive rate is less or equal to one, extinction on all patches\nis imminent. Otherwise, permanency on all patches is guaranteed. The proof is\nbased on a new approach to analysis of large-time stability.\n", "  In order to improve our understanding of landing on small bodies and of\nasteroid evolution, we use our novel drop tower facility to perform\nlow-velocity (2-40 cm s^-1), shallow impact experiments of a 10 cm diameter\naluminum sphere into quartz sand in low effective gravities (~0.2-1 m s^-2).\nUsing in situ accelerometers, we measure the acceleration profile during the\nimpacts and determine the peak accelerations, collision durations and maximum\npenetration depth. We find that the penetration depth scales linearly with the\ncollision velocity but is independent of the effective gravity for the\nexperimental range tested, and that the collision duration is independent of\nboth the effective gravity and the collision velocity. No rebounds are observed\nin any of the experiments. Our low-gravity experimental results indicate that\nthe transition from the quasi-static regime to the inertial regime occurs for\nimpact energies two orders of magnitude smaller than in similar impact\nexperiments under terrestrial gravity. The lower energy regime change may be\ndue to the increased hydrodynamic drag of the surface material in our\nexperiments, but may also support the notion that the quasi-static regime\nreduces as the effective gravity becomes lower.\n", "  Revealing the structure of complex biological macromolecules, such as\nproteins, is an essential step for understanding the chemical mechanisms that\ndetermine the diversity of their functions. Synchrotron based x-ray\ncrystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have made major contributions in\ndetermining thousands of protein structures even from micro-sized crystals.\nThey suffer from some limitations that have not been overcome, such as\nradiation damage, the natural inability to crystallize of a number of proteins\nand experimental conditions for structure determination that are incompatible\nwith the physiological environment. Today the ultrashort and ultra-bright\npulses of X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have made attainable the dream to\ndetermine protein structure before radiation damage starts to destroy the\nsamples. However, the signal-to-noise ratio remains a great challenge to obtain\nusable diffraction patterns from a single protein molecule. We describe here a\nnew methodology that should overcome the signal and protein crystallization\nlimits. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we propose to create a two\ndimensional protein array with defined orientation attached on a\nself-assembled-monolayer. We develop a literature-based, flexible toolbox\ncapable of assembling different proteins on a functionalized surface while\nkeeping them under physiological conditions during the experiment, using a\nwater-confining graphene cover.\n", "  Energy has always been the driving force in the technological and economic\ndevelopment of societies. The consumption of a significant amount of energy is\nrequired to provide basic living conditions of developed countries (heating,\ntransportation, lighting, etc.). Today energy supply has a considerable impact\non the environment, since it is fuelled by the burning of fossil fuels. In\naddition to this, the fossil fuel reserves are decreasing while the demand for\nenergy is rapidly rising. Climate change, the depletion and geographical\nsegregation of fossil fuel resources, health related issues as well as energy\npoverty constitute the driving forces towards the pursuit of alternative energy\nsources. In addition, countries with no access to oil reserves are being\ndependent from other countries for their energy supply, with a strong impact on\npolitics and financial issues.\n", "  The system of dynamic equations for Bose-Einstein condensate at zero\ntemperature with account of pair correlations is obtained. The spectrum of\nsmall oscillations of the condensate in a spatially homogeneous state is\nexplored. It is shown that this spectrum has two branches: the sound wave\nbranch and branch with an energy gap.\n", "  The intermediate state dependence of photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD)\nin resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization of fenchone in the gas phase is\nexperimentally studied. By scanning the excitation wavelength from 359 to 431\nnm we simultaneously excite up to three electronically distinct resonances. In\nthe PECD experiment performed with a broadband femtosecond laser their\nrespective contributions to the photoelectron spectrum can be resolved.\nHigh-resolution spectroscopy allows us to identify two of the resonances as\nbelonging to the B- and C-bands, which involve excitation to states with 3s and\n3p Rydberg character, respectively. We observe a sign change in the PECD signal\ndepending on which electronic state is used as an intermediate. Additionally,\nscanning the laser wavelength reveals a decrease of PECD magnitude with\nincreasing photoelectron energy for the 3s state.\n", "  The dark side of the universe is mysterious and its nature is still unknown.\nIn fact, this poses perhaps as the biggest challenge in the modern cosmology.\nThe two components of the dark sector (dark matter and dark energy) correspond\ntoday to around ninety five percent of the universe. The simplest dark energy\ncandidate is a cosmological constant. However, this attempt presents a huge\ndiscrepancy of 120 orders of magnitude between the theoretical prediction and\nthe observed data. Such a huge disparity motivates physicists to look into a\nmore sophisticated models. This can be done either looking for a deeper\nunderstanding of where the cosmological constant comes from, if one wants to\nderive it from first principles, or considering other possibilities for\naccelerated expansion, such as modifications of general relativity, additional\nmatter fields and so on. Still regarding a dynamical dark energy, there may\nexist a possibility of interaction between dark energy and dark matter, since\ntheir densities are comparable and, depending on the coupling used, the\ninteraction can also alleviate the issue of why dark energy and matter\ndensities are of the same order today. Phenomenological models have been widely\nexplored in the literature. On the other hand, field theory models that aim a\nconsistent description of the dark energy/dark matter interaction are still\nfew. In this thesis, we explore either a scalar or a vector field as a dark\nenergy candidate in several different approaches, taking into account a\npossible interaction between the two components of the dark sector. This thesis\nis based on the following papers: 1611.00428, 1605.03550, 1509.04980,\n1508.07248, 1507.00902 and 1505.03243. The author also collaborated in the\nworks 1607.03506 and 1605.05264.\n", "  In this paper, a Bayesian method for piecewise regression is adapted to\nhandle counting processes data distributed as Poisson. A numerical code in\nMathematica is developed and tested analyzing simulated data. The resulting\nmethod is valuable for detecting breaking points in the count rate of time\nseries for Poisson processes.\n", "  We report on the magnetic properties of zinc ferrite thin film deposited on\nSrTiO$_3$ single crystal using pulsed laser deposition. X-ray diffraction\nresult indicates the highly oriented single phase growth of the film along with\nthe presence of the strain. In comparison to the bulk antiferromagnetic order,\nthe as-deposited film has been found to exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering with a\ncoercive field of 1140~Oe at 5~K. A broad maximum, at $\\approx$105~K, observed\nin zero-field cooled magnetization curve indicates the wide grain size\ndistribution for the as-deposited film. Reduction in magnetization and blocking\ntemperature has been observed after annealing in both argon as well as oxygen\natmospheres, where the variation was found to be dependent on the annealing\ntemperature.\n", "  The linear and nonlinear interactions between spin waves (magnons) and\nacoustic waves (phonons) in magnetostrictive materials provide an exciting\nopportunity for realizing novel microwave signal processing devices and\nspintronic circuits. Here we demonstrate the parametric pumping of spin waves\nby acoustic waves, the possibility of which has long been theoretically\nanticipated but never experimentally realized. Spin waves propagating in a thin\nfilm of yttrium iron garnet (YIG), a magnetostrictive ferrimagnet with low spin\nand acoustic wave damping, are pumped using an acoustic resonator driven at\nfrequencies near twice the spin wave frequency. The observation of a\ncounter-propagating idler wave and a distinct pump threshold that increases\nquadratically with frequency non-degeneracy are evidence of a nonlinear\nparametric pumping process consistent with classical theory. This demonstration\nof acoustic parametric pumping lays the groundwork for developing new\nspintronic and microwave signal processing devices based on amplification and\nmanipulation of spin waves by efficient, spatially localized acoustic\ntransducers.\n", "  In the paper \"Formality conjecture\" (1996) Kontsevich designed a universal\nflow $\\dot{\\mathcal{P}}=\\mathcal{Q}_{a:b}(\\mathcal{P})=a\\Gamma_{1}+b\\Gamma_{2}$\non the spaces of Poisson structures $\\mathcal{P}$ on all affine manifolds of\ndimension $n \\geqslant 2$. We prove a claim from $\\textit{loc. cit.}$ stating\nthat if $n=2$, the flow $\\mathcal{Q}_{1:0}=\\Gamma_{1}(\\mathcal{P})$ is\nPoisson-cohomology trivial: $\\Gamma_{1}(\\mathcal{P})$ is the Schouten bracket\nof $\\mathcal{P}$ with $\\mathcal{X}$, for some vector field $\\mathcal{X}$; we\nexamine the structure of the space of solutions $\\mathcal{X}$. Both the\nconstruction of differential polynomials $\\Gamma_{1}(\\mathcal{P})$ and\n$\\Gamma_{2}(\\mathcal{P})$ and the technique to study them remain valid in\nhigher dimensions $n \\geqslant 3$, but neither the trivializing vector field\n$\\mathcal{X}$ nor the setting $b:=0$ survive at $n\\geqslant 3$, where the\nbalance is $a:b=1:6$.\n", "  The analogy between mechanical and electromagnetic resonators has been a\ncelebrated paradigm of science and engineering. Exploration of this analogy in\nrecent years has resulted in several exciting research directions, including\ncavity optomechanics[1], phononic bandgap materials[2] and phononic\nmetamaterials[3-5]. In these examples, progress in electromagnetic research has\nusually led the way for their mechanical counterparts. Here, we contribute to\nthis analogy from a different perspective by adapting a sensing technique\noriginally developed for mechanical devices to increase the capabilities of\nsensors based on electromagnetic fields. More specifically, multimode resonance\ntechniques, which enable spatial resolution in inertial mass sensing\nexperiments with nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), are tailored for use in\nmicrowave resonant sensing, which is commonly employed in microfluidics. We\nshow that the use of higher-order modes of such sensors can provide electrical\nvolume, position and geometric size data. The combination of such spatial\nfeatures implies the potential for image reconstruction when a large number of\nmodes are used. With the analytical and experimental framework presented here,\nwe can move beyond simple counting and achieve the sizing and imaging of\nanalytes with impedance spectroscopy.\n", "  We report the observation of pulsed electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR)\nspectrum caused by interactions of the nitrogen nuclei 14N with the unpaired\nelectron of the paramagnetic vanadyl complexes VO2+ of vanadyl porphyrins in\nnatural crude oil. We provide detailed experimental and theoretical\ncharacterization of the nitrogen hyperfine and quadrupole tensors.\n", "  An algorithm is presented for generating successive approximations to\ntrigonometric functions of sums of non-commuting matrices. The resulting\nexpressions involve nested commutators of the respective matrices. The\nprocedure is shown to converge in the convergent domain of the Zassenhaus\nformula and can be useful in the perturbative treatment of quantum mechanical\nproblems, where exponentials of sums of non-commuting skew-Hermitian matrices\nfrequently appear.\n", "  Recently, a new neutron spectroscopy for the dynamics in complex (bio-)\nsystems has been proposed [A. Benedetto, and G. J. Kearley, Sci. Rep. 6, 34266,\n(2016)]. This spectroscopy is ideal where only the overall relaxation time in a\nparameterless way is required, for example in complex systems, because only the\nelastic-scattering intensity as a function of the energy resolution is\nrequired. This has been termed \"Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy\" (ESS). It is\nbased on the inflection points in the elastic-scattering intensity at the\nenergy-resolution value corresponding to the overall system relaxation-time. A\nConstant wavelength (CW) option, more suitable for reactor sources, and the\ntime-of-flight (TOF) option, more suitable for spallation sources, have already\nbeen proposed, and here we examine the concept of a third option based on\nneutron spin-echo (NSE), called ESS-NSE. In principle, this consists of simply\nmeasuring depolarisation at the relatively-intense elastic echo-condition, as a\nfunction of resolution, with the basic set-up being similar to standard\nspin-echo. In its basic set-up, ESS spin-echo can access 5 orders of magnitude\nin time from nanoseconds to tens of picoseconds, reaching slower relaxation\nprocesses than the CW and TOF options recently presented. However, spatial\nfocussing is important for the small sample-sizes of biological systems, so we\nalso explore how the fields may be shaped to enable a small neutron beam to be\nfocussed on the sample.\n", "  In simulation of fluid injection in fractured geothermal reservoirs, the\ncharacteristics of the physical processes are severely affected by the local\noccurence of connected fractures. To resolve these structurally dominated\nprocesses, there is a need to develop discretization strategies that also limit\ncomputational effort. In this paper we present an upscaling methodology for\ngeothermal heat transport with fractures represented explicitly in the\ncomputational grid. The heat transport is modeled by an advection-conduction\nequation for the temperature, and solved on a highly irregular coarse grid that\npreserves the fracture heterogeneity. The upscaling is based on different\nstrategies for the advective term and the conductive term, respectively. The\ncoarse scale advective term is constructed from sums of fine scale fluxes,\nwhereas the coarse scale conductive term is constructed based on numerically\ncomputed basis functions. The method naturally incorporates a coupling between\nthe matrix and the fractures via the discretization, so that explicit transfer\nterms that couple solution variables in the fractures and the matrix are\navoided. Numerical results show that the upscaling methodology performs well,\nin particular for large upscaling ratios, and that it is applicable also to\nhighly complex fracture networks.\n", "  Fringe-projection profilometry with 1 camera and 1 fringe-projector is a\nwell-known and widely used technique in optical metrology. Spatial-frequency\nmultiplexing interferometry with several spatial-carriers having\nnon-overlapping spatial-spectra is also well known and productive in optical\nmetrology. In this paper we propose temporal-multiplexing phase-shifting\ninterferometry applied to profilometry. That is, instead of having\nfringe-patterns with well separated spatial-spectra, we propose instead to\nseparate the fringe information in the temporal-spectra. In other words, we may\nhave overlapping spatial-spectra, but separated in the temporal-spectra by\nfrequency multiplexing. Using 1-camera and several fringe-projectors one\nminimizes the object shadows and specular reflections from the digitizing\nsolid. Temporal multiplexing profilometry allows us to illuminate the object\nfrom several projectors turned-on simultaneously. In previous phase-shifting\nco-phased profilometry, the projectors were turned-on and off sequentially. As\nseen in this work temporal-multiplexing allow us to demodulate the several\nfringe-patterns without crosstalk from other simultaneously projected fringes.\nThis is entirely analogous to having several television stations broadcasting\nsimultaneously, each TV-transmitter having its own broadcasting frequency. A\ngiven TV-receiver tunes into a single TV-station and filter-out all other\nbroadcasters. Following this analogy, each fringe-projector must have its own\ntemporal broadcasting frequency to remain well separated from all other\nprojectors in the time-spectra domain. In addition to the general theory\npresented, we assess its feasibility with experimental results.\n", "  We present a simple stochastic agent-based community finding algorithm. Our\nalgorithm is tested on network data from the Zachary karate club study, data\nfrom Victor Hugo's \"Les Miserables\", and data obtained from a musical piece by\nJ.S. Bach. In all three cases, the algorithm partitions the vertices of the\ngraph sensibly.\n"]}
