We propose a microscopic model according to\nthe electrodynamics of point charges, complex enough to describe the essential\nphysics. Our microscopic model reaches a simple qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental results as regards interference in double-slit scattering and in\nelectronic scattering by crystals. We discuss our model in the light of\nexisting experimental results, including a qualitative disagreement found for\nthe double-slit experiment. We discuss an approximation for the complex neutral\ndifferential delay equations of our model using piecewise-defined\n(discontinuous) velocities for all charges and piecewise-constant-velocities\nfor the scattered charge. Our approximation predicts the De Broglie wavelength\nas an inverse function of the incoming velocity and in the correct order of\nmagnitude. We explain the scattering by crystals in the light of the same\nsimplified modeling with Einstein-local interactions. We include a discussion\nof the qualitative properties of the neutral-delay-equations of electrodynamics\nto stimulate future experimental tests on the possibility to complete quantum\nmechanics with electromagnetic models.\n", "  In this paper, we study the multi-spin string solutions in AdS_4*CP^3 and its\n\\beta-deformation with real \\beta. We give various explicit solutions after\nsome general studies. Conserved charges are computed for these explicit\nsolutions.\n", "  We consider an abelian N=4 super Yang-Mills theory coupled to background N=4\nconformal supergravity fields. At the classical level, this coupling is\ninvariant under global SU(1,1) transformation of the complex (\"dilaton-axion\")\nsupergravity scalar combined with an on-shell vector-vector duality. We compute\nthe divergent part of the corresponding quantum effective action found by\nintegrating over the super Yang-Mills fields and demonstrate its SU(1,1)\ninvariance. This divergent part related to the conformal anomaly is one-loop\nexact and should be given by the N=4 conformal supergravity action containing\nthe Weyl tensor squared term. This allows us to determine the full non-linear\nform of the bosonic part of the N=4 conformal supergravity action which has\nmanifest SU(1,1) invariance.\n", "  We consider a nearest-neighbor four state hard-core (HC) model on the\nhomogeneous Cayley tree of order $k$. The Hamiltonian of the model is\nconsidered on a set of \"admissible\" configurations. Admissibility is specified\nthrough a graph with four vertices. We first exhibit conditions (on the graph\nand on the parameters) under which the model has a unique Gibbs measure. Next\nwe turn to some specific cases. Namely, first we study, in the case of a\nparticular graph (the diamond), translation-invariant and periodic Gibbs\nmeasures. We provide in both cases the equations of the transition lines\nseparating uniqueness from non--uniqueness regimes. Finally the same is done\nfor \"fertile\" graphs, the so--called stick, gun, and key (here only translation\ninvariant states are taken into account).\n", "  We have constructed a noncommutative deformation of the holographic QCD\n(Sakai-Sugimoto) model and evaluated the mass spectrum of low spin vector\nmesons at finite temperature. The masses of light vector- and\npseudovector-meson in the noncommutative holographic QCD model reduces over the\nwhole area in the intermediate-temperature regime compared to the commutative\ncase. However, the space noncommutativity does not change the properties of\ntemperature dependence for the mass spectrum of low spin mesons. The masses of\nmeson also decrease with increasing temperature in noncommutative case.\n", "  We derive an exact solution of an explicitly time-dependent multichannel\nmodel of quantum mechanical nonadiabatic transitions. Our model corresponds to\nthe case of a single linear diabatic energy level interacting with a band of an\narbitrary N states, for which the diabatic energies decay with time according\nto the Coulomb law. We show that the time-dependent Schroedingier equation for\nthis system can be solved in terms of Meijer functions whose asymptotics at a\nlarge time can be compactly written in terms of elementary functions that\ndepend on the roots of an Nth order characteristic polynomial. Our model can be\nconsidered a generalization of the Demkov-Osherov model. In comparison to the\nlatter, our model allows one to explore the role of curvature of the band\nlevels and diabatic avoided crossings.\n", "  Scaling and sustaining educational innovations is a common problem in the\nlearning sciences. Professional development resources around educational\ninnovations that are personalized to appeal to the needs and motivations of\ndifferent types of faculty offer a possible solution. The method of developing\npersonas to represent key types of users is commonly employed in user-interface\ndesign and can be used to produce personalized resources. Personas are\nfictional named archetypes of users encompassing generalizations of their key\ncharacteristics and goals that emerge from interviews. This method is\nespecially powerful because personas succinctly package information into the\nform of a person, who is easily understood and reasoned about. Herein we\ndescribe the creation of a set of personas focusing on the needs and\nmotivations of physics faculty around assessment and teaching. We present the\npersonas, a discussion of how they inform our design and how the method can be\nused more broadly.\n", "  We investigate the stability and coherence properties of one-dimensional\nexciton-polariton condensates under nonresonant pumping. We model the\ncondensate dynamics using the open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In\nthe case of spatially homogeneous pumping, we find that the instability of the\nsteady state leads to significant eduction of the coherence length. We consider\ntwo effects that can lead to the stabilization of the steady state, i.e. the\npolariton energy relaxation and the influence of an inhomogeneous pumping\nprofile. We find that, while the former has little effect on the stability, the\nlatter is very effective in stabilizing the condensate which results in a large\ncoherence length.\n", "  We identify a nontrivial multistate Landau-Zener model for which transition\nprobabilities between any pair of diabatic states can be determined\nanalytically and exactly. In the semiclassical picture, this model features the\npossibility of interference of different trajectories that connect the same\ninitial and final states. Hence, transition probabilities are generally not\ndescribed by the incoherent successive application of the Landau-Zener formula.\nWe discuss reasons for integrability of this system and provide numerical tests\nof the suggested expression for the transition probability matrix.\n", "  Recently it has become clear that many technologies follow a generalized\nversion of Moore's law, i.e. costs tend to drop exponentially, at different\nrates that depend on the technology. Here we formulate Moore's law as a\ncorrelated geometric random walk with drift, and apply it to historical data on\n53 technologies. We derive a closed form expression approximating the\ndistribution of forecast errors as a function of time. Based on hind-casting\nexperiments we show that this works well, making it possible to collapse the\nforecast errors for many different technologies at different time horizons onto\nthe same universal distribution. This is valuable because it allows us to make\nforecasts for any given technology with a clear understanding of the quality of\nthe forecasts. As a practical demonstration we make distributional forecasts at\ndifferent time horizons for solar photovoltaic modules, and show how our method\ncan be used to estimate the probability that a given technology will outperform\nanother technology at a given point in the future.\n", "  Quantum entanglement is considered, by and large, to be a very delicate and\nnon-robust phenomenon that is very hard to maintain in the presence of noise,\nor non-zero temperatures. In recent years however, and motivated, in part, by a\nquest for a quantum analog of the PCP theorem researches have tried to\nestablish whether or not we can preserve quantum entanglement at \"constant\"\ntemperatures that are independent of system size. This would imply that any\nquantum state with energy at most, say 0.05 of the total available energy of\nthe Hamiltonian, would be highly-entangled. To this date, no such systems were\nfound, and moreover, it became evident that even embedding local Hamiltonians\non robust, albeit \"non-physical\" topologies, namely expanders, does not\nguarantee entanglement robustness. In this study, we indicate that such\nrobustness may be possible after all: We construct an infinite family of\nO(1)-local Hamiltonians, corresponding to check terms of a quantum\nerror-correcting code with the following property of inapproximability: any\nquantum state with energy at most 0.05 w.r.t. the total available energy cannot\nbe even approximately simulated by classical circuits of bounded\n(sub-logarithmic) depth. In a sense, this implies that even providing a\n\"witness\" to the fact that the local Hamiltonian can be \"almost\" satisfied,\nalready requires some measure of long-range entanglement. Our construction is\nbut a first step in what, we believe, is a whole range of possible entanglement\n- robust local Hamiltonians. A natural next step, we believe, is to devise such\nlocal Hamiltonians that resist approximation in terms of bounded-depth quantum\ncircuits (e.g. NLTS), and even find such robust forms of entanglement that are\nuseful for some computation.\n", "  We study the relation between the models commonly used to describe the\ndynamics of nonresonantly pumped exciton-polariton condensates, namely the ones\ndescribed by the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and by the open-dissipative\nGross-Pitaevskii equation including a separate equation for the reservoir\ndensity. In particular, we focus on the validity of the adiabatic approximation\nthat allows to reduce the coupled condensate-reservoir dynamics to a single\npartial differential equation. We find that the adiabatic approximation\nconsists of three independent analytical conditions that have to be fulfilled\nsimultaneously. By investigating stochastic versions of the two corresponding\nmodels, we verify that the breakdown of the adiabatic approximation can lead to\ndiscrepancies in correlation lengths and distributions of fluctuations.\nAdditionally, we consider the phase diffusion and number fluctuations of a\ncondensate in a box, and show that self-consistent description requires\ntreatment beyond the typical Bogoliubov approximation.\n", "  We consider a localized electronic spin controlled by a circularly polarized\noptical beam and an external magnetic field. When the frequency of the beam is\ntuned near an optical resonance with a continuum of higher energy states,\neffective magnetic fields are induced on the two-level system via the Inverse\nFaraday Effect. We explore the process in which the frequency of the beam is\nmade linearly time-dependent so that it sweeps through the optical resonance,\nstarting and ending at the values far away from it. In addition to changes of\nspin states, Kramers-Kronig relations guarantee that a localized electron can\nalso escape into a continuum of states. We argue that probabilities of\ntransitions between different possible electronic states after such a sweep of\nthe optical frequency can be found exactly regardless the shape of the\nresonance. We also discuss extension of our results to multistate systems.\n", "  We show that how a recent experiment of quantum imaging with undetected\nphotons can basically be described as a (partial) ancilla-assisted process\ntomography. We propose a simplified quantum circuit version of this scenario,\nwhich also enables to recast quantum imaging in quantum computation language.\nOur analogy and analysis may help better understand the role of classical\nand/or quantum correlations in imaging experiments.\n", "  We study the Zeeman effect on entanglement of non-equilibrium finite-spin\nsystems with external fields using a method based on thermofield dynamics\n(TFD). For this purpose, the extended density matrices and extended\nentanglement entropies of two systems with either non-competing or competing\nexternal fields are calculated according to the dissipative von Neumann\nequation, and the numerical results are compared. Consequently, through the\n\"twin-peaks\" oscillations of the quantum entanglement, we have illustrated the\nZeeman effect on the entanglement of non-equilibrium finite-spin systems with\ncompeting external fields in the TFD algorithm.\n", "  The phenomenon of a dispersion bandgap opening between low-loss spectral\nwindows of odd and even plasmonic modes in a layered insulator-metal-insulator\nplasmonic waveguide is introduced. Beginning with a three layer plasmonic\ndispersion relation, we explain and numerically confirm the existence of the\nplasmonic bandgap, and investigate its properties at a very broad spectrum\nrange from ultraviolet to far infrared. The nature of the observed bandgap\nopening is explained in terms of the near-zero value of an effective\npermittivity for plasmonic modes in the waveguide. The adjustment of the\nplasmonic bandgap spectrum is demonstrated with the structural modification of\nthe plasmonic waveguide. As an application example, we illustrate a new concept\nof coupling control between surface plasmons and free-space excitation waves,\nby employing a tapered non-adiabatic insulator-metal-insulator waveguide.\n", "  Unique electrodynamic response of graphene implies a manifestation of an\nunusual propagating and localised transverse-electric (TE) mode near the\nspectral onset of interband transitions. However, excitation and further\ndetection of the TE mode supported by graphene is considered to be a challenge\nfor it is extremely sensitive to excitation environment and phase matching\ncondition adherence. Here for the first time, we experimentally prove an\nexistence of the TE mode by its direct optical probing, demonstrating\nsignificant coupling to an incident wave in electrically doped multilayer\ngraphene sheet at room temperature. We believe that proposed technique of\ncareful phase matching and obtained access to graphene TE excitation would\nstimulate further studies of this unique phenomenon, and enable its potential\nemploying in various fields of photonics as well as for characterization of\ngraphene.\n", "  We construct new integrable systems describing particles with internal spin\nfrom four-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ quiver gauge theories. The models can be\nquantized and solved exactly using the quantum inverse scattering method and\nalso using the Bethe/Gauge correspondence.\n", "  Special coordinate systems are constructed in a neighborhood of a point or of\na curve. Taylor expansions can then be easily inferred for the metric, the\nconnection, or the Finsler Lagrangian in terms of curvature invariants. These\ncoordinates circumvent the difficulties of the normal and Fermi coordinates in\nFinsler geometry, which in general are not sufficiently differentiable. They\nare obtained applying the usual constructions to the pullback of a horizontally\ntorsionless connection. The results so obtained are easily specialized to the\nBerwald or Chern-Rund connections and have application in the study of the\nequivalence principle in Finslerian extensions of general relativity.\n", "  We propose an approximate reconstruction of random heterogeneous\nmicrostructures using the two-exponent power-law (TEPL). This rule originates\nfrom the entropic descriptor (ED) that is a multi-scale measure of spatial\ninhomogeneity for a given microstructure. A digitized target sample is a cube\nof linear size L in voxels. Then, a number of trial configurations can be\ngenerated by a model of overlapping spheres of a fixed radius, which are\nrandomly distributed on a regular lattice. The TEPL describes the averaged\nmaximum of the ED as a function of the phase concentration and the radius.\nThus, it can be used to determine the radius. The suggested approach is tested\non surrogate samples of ceramic and carbonate. In each of the cases, fifty\nlow-cost trials provided a few good enough candidates to a selection of the\noptimal reconstruction. When a better accuracy is planned, the final\nreconstructions can serve as the starting configurations. Then, the resulting\nreconstructions should be competitive indeed to those starting with random\nconfigurations.\n", "  Kramers degeneracy theorem is one of the basic results in quantum mechanics.\nAccording to it, the time-reversal symmetry makes each energy level of a\nhalf-integer spin system at least doubly degenerate, meaning the absence of\ntransitions or scatterings between degenerate states if the Hamiltonian does\nnot depend on time explicitly. We generalize this result to the case of\nexplicitly time-dependent spin Hamiltonians. We prove that for a spin system\nwith the total spin being a half integer, if its Hamiltonian and the evolution\ntime interval are symmetric under a specifically defined time reversal\noperation, the scattering amplitude between an arbitrary initial state and its\ntime reversed counterpart is exactly zero. We also discuss applications of this\nresult to the multistate Landau-Zener (LZ) theory.\n", "  Oxides with perovskite-based structures have been known as essential\nmaterials for fascinating phenomena such as high-temperature and unconventional\nsuperconductivity. Discoveries of these oxide superconductors have driven the\nscience community to vastly extend the concepts of strongly correlated electron\nsystems. The base of these materials, the cubic perovskite oxides, $AB$O$_3$,\nalso exhibit superconductivity with $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of up to 30 K, as reported\nfor Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$BiO$_3$. Perovskite oxides have their counterparts,\nantiperovskite oxides $A_3B$O (or \"$B$O$A_3$\"), in which the position of metal\nand oxygen ions are reversed and therefore metallic $B$ ions take unusual\nnegative valence states. However, no superconductivity has been reported among\nantiperovskite oxides. Here, we report the discovery of the first\nsuperconducting antiperovskite oxide Sr$_3$SnO with $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ of around\n5 K. Sr$_3$SnO possesses Dirac points in its electronic structure, originating\nfrom the inversion of bands with different parities. Based on theoretical\nanalysis, we propose possibility of topological odd-parity superconductivity\nanalogous to the superfluid $^3$He-B, in moderately hole-doped Sr$_3$SnO,\noriginating from unusual orbital texture on the Fermi surface. We envision that\nthis discovery of a new class of oxide superconductor with the inverted valence\nconfiguration will stimulate the exploration of topological materials science\nbased on a variety of antiperovskite oxides.\n", "  The full version of QCD light-cone sum rule method is applied to tetraquarks\ncontaining a single heavy $b$ or $c$ quark. To this end, investigations of the\nstrong vertices $X_{b}X_{b}\\rho$ and $X_{c}X_{c}\\rho$ are performed, where\n$X_b=[su][\\bar b\\bar d]$ and $X_c=[su][\\bar c\\bar d]$ are the exotic states\nbuilt of four quarks of different flavors. The strong coupling constants\n$G_{X_{b}X_{b}\\rho}$ and $G_{X_{c}X_{c}\\rho}$ corresponding to these vertices\nare found using the $\\rho$-meson leading and higher-twist distribution\namplitudes. In the calculations $X_{b}$ and $X_{c}$ are treated as scalar bound\nstates of a diquark and antidiquark.\n", "  We analyze Darboux transformations in very general settings for\nmultidimensional linear partial differential operators. We consider all known\ntypes of Darboux transformations, and present a new type. We obtain a full\nclassification of all operators that admit Wronskian type Darboux\ntransformations of first order and a complete description of all possible\nfirst-order Darboux transformations. We introduce a large class of invertible\nDarboux transformations of higher order, which we call Darboux transformations\nof continued Type I. This generalizes the class of Darboux transformations of\nType I, which was previously introduced. There is also a modification of this\ntype of Darboux transformations, continued Wronskian type, which generalize\nWronskian type Darboux transformations.\n", "  A many-body atomic system coupled to quantized light is subject to weak\nmeasurement. Instead of coupling light to the on-site density, we consider the\nquantum backaction due to the measurement of matter-phase-related variables\nsuch as global phase coherence. We show how this unconventional approach opens\nup new opportunities to affect system evolution and demonstrate how this can\nlead to a new class of measurement projections, thus extending the measurement\npostulate for the case of strong competition with the system's own evolution.\n", "  We study the imprints that theories of gravity beyond GR can leave on the\nlensing signal around line of sight directions that are predominantly\nhalo-underdense (called troughs) and halo-overdense. To carry out our\ninvestigations, we consider the normal branch of DGP gravity, as well as a\nphenomenological variant thereof that directly modifies the lensing potential.\nThe predictions of these models are obtained with N-body simulation and\nray-tracing methods using the ECOSMOG and Ray-Ramses codes. We analyse the\nstacked lensing convergence profiles around the underdense and overdense lines\nof sight, which exhibit, respectively, a suppression and a boost w.r.t. the\nmean in the field of view. The modifications to gravity in these models\nstrengthen the signal w.r.t. $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ in a scale-independent way. We\nfind that the size of this effect is the same for both underdense and overdense\nlines of sight, which implies that the density field along the overdense\ndirections on the sky is not sufficiently evolved to trigger the suppression\neffects of the screening mechanism. These results are robust to variations in\nthe minimum halo mass and redshift ranges used to identify the lines of sight,\nas well as to different line of sight aperture sizes and criteria for their\nunderdensity and overdensity thresholds.\n", "  A challenge of molecular self-assembly is to understand how to design\nparticles that self-assemble into a desired structure and not any of a\npotentially large number of undesired structures. Here we use simulation to\nshow that a strategy of minimal positive design allows the self-assembly of\nnetworks equivalent to the 8 semiregular Archimedean tilings of the plane,\nstructures not previously realized in simulation. This strategy consists of\nidentifying the fewest distinct types of interparticle interaction that appear\nin the desired structure, and does not require enumeration of the many possible\nundesired structures. The resulting particles, which self-assemble into the\ndesired networks, possess DNA-like selectivity of their interactions. Assembly\nof certain molecular networks may therefore require such selectivity.\n", "  We present a theoretical description of the nonlinear response induced by an\nelliptically-polarized terahertz beam normally-incident on intrinsic and\nextrinsic metallic armchair graphene nanorib- bons. Our results show that using\na straightforward experimental setup, it should be possible to observe novel\npolarization-dependent nonlinearities at low excitation field strengths of the\nor- der of 10 4 V/m. At low temperatures the Kerr nonlinearities in extrinsic\nnanoribbons persist to significantly higher excitation frequencies than they do\nfor linear polarizations, and at room tem- peratures, the third-harmonic\nnonlinearities are enhanced by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Finally, the\nFermi-level and temperature dependence of the nonlinear response is\ncharacterized.\n", "  We investigate the Alcock Paczynski (AP) test applied to the Baryon Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) feature in the galaxy correlation function. By using a\ngeneral formalism that includes relativistic effects, we quantify the\nimportance of the linear redshift space distortions and gravitational lensing\ncorrections to the galaxy number density fluctuation. We show that redshift\nspace distortions significantly affect the shape of the correlation function,\nboth in radial and transverse directions, causing different values of galaxy\nbias to induce offsets up to 1% in the AP test. On the other hand, we find that\nthe lensing correction around the BAO scale modifies the amplitude but not the\nshape of the correlation function and therefore does not introduce any\nsystematic effect. Furthermore, we investigate in details how the AP test is\nsensitive to redshift binning: a window function in transverse direction\nsuppresses correlations and shifts the peak position toward smaller angular\nscales. We determine the correction that should be applied in order to account\nfor this effect, when performing the test with data from three future planned\ngalaxy redshift surveys: Euclid, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument\n(DESI) and the Square Kilometer Array (SKA).\n", "  The quantum uncertainty principle famously predicts that there exist\nmeasurements that are inherently incompatible, in the sense that their outcomes\ncannot be predicted simultaneously. In contrast, no such uncertainty exists in\nthe classical domain, where all uncertainty results from ignorance about the\nexact state of the physical system. Here, we critically examine the concept of\npreparation uncertainty and ask whether similarly in the quantum regime, some\nof the uncertainty that we observe can actually also be understood as a lack of\ninformation (LOI), albeit a lack of quantum information. We answer this\nquestion affirmatively by showing that for the well known measurements employed\nin BB84 quantum key distribution, the amount of uncertainty can indeed be\nrelated to the amount of available information about additional registers\ndetermining the choice of the measurement. We proceed to show that also for\nother measurements the amount of uncertainty is in part connected to a LOI.\nFinally, we discuss the conceptual implications of our observation to the\nsecurity of cryptographic protocols that make use of BB84 states.\n", "  The transverse momentum spectra of weak vector bosons are measured in the CMS\nexperiment at the LHC. The measurement uses a sample of proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, collected during a special low-luminosity\nrunning that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.4 +/- 0.5 inverse\npicobarns. The production of W bosons is studied in both electron and muon\ndecay modes, while the production of Z bosons is studied using only the dimuon\ndecay channel. The ratios of W- to W+ and Z to W differential cross sections\nare also measured. The measured differential cross sections and ratios are\ncompared with theoretical predictions up to next-to-next leading order in QCD.\n", "  We present an implementation of optimal control theory for the\nfirst-principles non-adiabatic Ehrenfest Molecular Dynamics model, which\ndescribes a condensed matter system by considering classical point-particle\nnuclei, and quantum electrons, handled in our case with time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory. The scheme is demonstrated by optimizing the Coulomb\nexplosion of small Sodium clusters: the algorithm is set to find the optimal\nfemtosecond laser pulses that disintegrate the clusters, for a given total\npulse duration, fluence, and cut-off frequency. We describe the numerical\ndetails and difficulties of the methodology.\n", "  Under coherent interactions, particles undergo correlated collisions with the\ncrystal lattice and their motion result in confinement in the fields of atomic\nplanes, i.e. particle channeling. Other than coherently interacting with the\nlattice, particles also suffer incoherent interactions with individual nuclei\nand may leave their bounded motion, i.e., they de-channel. This latter is the\nmain limiting factor for applications of coherent interactions in\ncrystal-assisted particle steering. We experimentally investigated the nature\nof dechanneling of 120 GeV/c $e^{-}$ and $e^{+}$ in a bent silicon crystal at\nH4-SPS external line at CERN. We found out that while channeling efficiency\ndiffers significantly for $e^{-}$ ($2\\pm2$ $\\%$) and $e^{+}$ ($54\\pm2$ $\\%$),\ntheir nuclear dechanneling length is comparable, $(0.6\\pm0.1)$ mm for $e^{-}$\nand $(0.7\\pm0.3)$ mm for $e^{+}$. The experimental proof of the equality of the\nnuclear dechanneling length for positrons and electrons is interpreted in terms\nof similar dynamics undergone by the channeled particles in the field of nuclei\nno matter of their charge.\n", "  Radical-ion-pair reactions, central for understanding the avian magnetic\ncompass and spin transport in photosynthetic reaction centers, were recently\nshown to be a fruitful paradigm of the new synthesis of quantum information\nscience with biological processes. We show here that the master equation so far\nconstituting the theoretical foundation of spin chemistry violates fundamental\nbounds for the entropy of quantum systems, in particular the Ozawa bound. In\ncontrast, a recently developed theory based on quantum measurements, quantum\ncoherence measures, and quantum retrodiction, thus exemplifying the paradigm of\nquantum biology, satisfies the Ozawa bound as well as the Lanford-Robinson\nbound on information extraction. By considering Groenewold information, the\nquantum information extracted during the reaction, we reproduce the known and\nunravel other magnetic-field effects not conveyed by reaction yields.\n", "  We evaluate spectral zeta-functions of certain network Laplacians that can be\ntreated exactly with the renormalization group. As specific examples we\nconsider a class of Hanoi networks and those hierarchical networks obtained by\nthe Migdal-Kadanoff bond moving scheme from regular lattices. As possible\napplications of these results we mention quantum search algorithms as well as\nsynchronization, which we discuss in more detail.\n", "  We investigate the phase diagram of the spin-orbit-coupled three orbital\nHubbard model at arbitrary filling by means of dynamical mean-field theory\ncombined with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo. We find that the\nspin-freezing crossover occurring in the metallic phase of the non-relativistic\nmultiorbital Hubbard model can be generalized to a $\\mathbf{J}$-freezing\ncrossover, with $\\mathbf{J}=\\mathbf{L}+\\mathbf{S}$, in the spin-orbit-coupled\ncase. In the $\\mathbf{J}$-frozen regime the correlated electrons exhibit a\nnon-trivial flavor selectivity and energy dependence. Furthermore, in the\nregions near $n=2$ and $n=4$ the metallic states are qualitatively different\nfrom each other, which reflects the atomic Hund's third rule. Finally, we\nexplore the appearance of magnetic order from exciton condensation at $n=4$ and\ndiscuss the relevance of our results for real materials.\n", "  An information theoretic approach to bounds in superconformal field theories\nis proposed. It is proved that the supersymmetric R\\'enyi entropy $\\bar\nS_\\alpha$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $\\alpha$ and\n$(\\alpha-1)\\bar S_\\alpha$ is a concave function of $\\alpha$. Under the\nassumption that the thermal entropy associated with the \"replica trick\" time\ncircle is bounded from below by the charge at $\\alpha\\to\\infty$, it is further\nproved that both ${\\alpha-1\\over \\alpha}\\bar S_\\alpha$ and $(\\alpha-1)\\bar\nS_\\alpha$ monotonically increase as functions of $\\alpha$. Because $\\bar\nS_\\alpha$ enjoys universal relations with the Weyl anomaly coefficients in\neven-dimensional superconformal field theories, one therefore obtains a set of\nbounds on these coefficients by imposing the inequalities of $\\bar S_\\alpha$.\nSome of the bounds coincide with Hofman-Maldacena bounds and the others are\nnew. We also check the inequalities for examples in odd-dimensions.\n", "  The configuration interaction approach to nuclear structure uses the\neffective Hamiltonian in a finite orbital space. The various parts of this\nHamiltonian and their interplay are responsible for specific features of\nphysics including the shape of the mean field and level density. This\ninterrelation is not sufficiently understood. We intend to study phase\ntransitions between spherical and deformed shapes driven by different parts of\nthe nuclear Hamiltonian and to establish the presence of the collective\nenhancement of the nuclear level density by varying the shell-model matrix\nelements. Varying the interaction matrix elements we define, for nuclei in the\nsd and pf shells, the sectors with spherical and deformed shapes. Using the\nmoments method that does not require the full diagonalization we relate the\nshape transitions with the corresponding level density. Enhancement of the\nlevel density in the low-energy part of the spectrum is observed in clear\ncorrelation with a deformation phase transition induced mainly by the matrix\nelements of single-particle transfer. The single-particle transfer matrix\nelements in the shell model nuclear Hamiltonian are indeed the carriers of\ndeformation, providing rotational observables and enhanced level densities.\n", "  The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser\nInterferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The\nGW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform\nmodel, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal\nvisible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and\ngeneral relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The\nsimple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully\ngeneral-relativistic analyses published elsewhere,in showing that the signal\nwas produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The\nblack holes were each of approximately 35 Msun, still orbited each other as\nclose as ~350 km apart, and subsequently merged to form a single black hole.\nSimilar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far\nthese black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in\ngravitational waves.\n", "  We revisit the possibility of a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate in the\nlight of current $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ anomalies by investigating a minimal\nextension of the Standard Model with a horizontal $\\mathrm{U(1)}^{\\prime}$\nlocal symmetry. Dark matter stability is protected by a remnant $\\mathcal{Z}_2$\nsymmetry arising after spontaneous symmetry breaking of\n$\\mathrm{U(1)}^{\\prime}$. The associated $Z^{\\prime}$ gauge boson can\naccommodate current hints of new physics in $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ decays, and\nacts as a vector portal between dark matter and the visible sector. We find\nthat the model is severely constrained by a combination of precision\nmeasurements at flavour factories, LHC searches for dilepton resonances, as\nwell as direct and indirect dark matter searches. Despite this, viable regions\nof the parameter space accommodating the observed dark matter relic abundance\nand the $b \\to s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ anomalies still persist for dark matter and\n$Z^{\\prime}$ masses in the TeV range.\n", "  The production cross section of a W boson in association with two b jets is\nmeasured using a sample of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV\ncollected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The data sample corresponds to\nan integrated luminosity of 19.8 inverse femtobarns. The W bosons are\nreconstructed via their leptonic decays, W to l nu, where l = mu or e. The\nfiducial region studied contains exactly one lepton with transverse momentum\npt[l] > 30 GeV and pseudorapidity abs(eta[l]) < 2.1, with exactly two b jets\nwith pt > 25 GeV and abs(eta) < 2.4 and no other jets with pt > 25 GeV and\nabs(eta) < 4.7. The cross section is measured to be sigma(pp to W (l nu)+\nbb-bar) = 0.64 +/- 0.03 (stat) +/- 0.10 (syst) +/- 0.06 (theo) +/- 0.02 (lumi)\npb, in agreement with standard model predictions.\n", "  We report on the experimental realization of a ten-photon\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state using thin BiB$_{3}$O$_{6}$ crystals. The\nobserved fidelity is $0.606\\pm0.029$, demonstrating a genuine entanglement with\na standard deviation of 3.6 $\\sigma$. This result is further verified using\n$p$-value calculation, obtaining an upper bound of $3.7\\times10^{-3}$ under an\nassumed hypothesis test. Our experiment paves a new way to efficiently engineer\nBiB$_{3}$O$_{6}$ crystal-based multi-photon entanglement systems, which\nprovides a promising platform for investigating advanced optical quantum\ninformation processing tasks such as boson sampling, quantum error correction\nand quantum-enhanced measurement.\n", "  We consider discrete-time evolution equations in which the stochastic\noperator of a classical random walk is replaced by a unitary operator. Such a\nproblem has gained much attention as a framework for coined quantum walks that\nare essential for attaining the Grover limit for quantum search algorithms in\nphysically realizable, low-dimensional geometries. In particular, we analyze\nthe exact real-space renormalization group (RG) procedure recently introduced\nto study the scaling of quantum walks on fractal networks. While this\nprocedure, when implemented numerically, was able to provide some deep insights\ninto the relation between classical and quantum walks, its analytic basis has\nremained obscure. Our discussion here is laying the groundwork for a rigorous\nimplementation of the RG for this important class of transport and algorithmic\nproblems, although some instances remain unresolved. Specifically, we find that\nthe RG fixed-point analysis of the classical walk, which typically focuses on\nthe dominant Jacobian eigenvalue $\\lambda_{1}$, with walk dimension\n$d_{w}^{RW}=\\log_{2}\\lambda_{1}$, needs to be extended to include the\nsubdominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}$, such that the dimension of the quantum\nwalk obtains $d_{w}^{QW}=\\log_{2}\\sqrt{\\lambda_{1}\\lambda_{2}}$. With that\nextension, we obtain analytically previously conjectured results for\n$d_{w}^{QW}$ of Grover walks on all but one of the fractal networks that have\nbeen considered.\n", "  We present a mechanism of amplification of phonons by phonons on the basis of\nnonlinear band-gap transmission phenomenon. As a concept the idea may be\napplied to the various number of systems, however we introduce the specific\nidea of creating amplification scenario in the chain of coupled cantilever\narrays. One chain is driven at the constant frequency located in the upper band\nof the ladder system, thus no wave enters the system. However the frequency is\nspecifically chosen to be very close to the maximum value of frequency\ncorresponding to dispersion relation of the system. Amplification scenario\nhappens when a counter phase pulse of same frequency with a small amplitude is\nintroduced to the second chain. If both signals exceed a threshold amplitude\nfor the band-gap transmission a large amplitude soliton enters the system -\ntherefore we have an amplifier. Although the concept may be applied in a\nvariety of contexts - all optical or all-magnonic systems, we choose the system\nof coupled cantilever arrays and represent a clear example of the application\nof presented conceptual idea. Logical operations is the other probable field,\nwhere such mechanism could be used, which might significantly broaden the\nhorizon of considered applications of band-gap soliton dynamics.\n", "  The polarization of photons produced in radiative $B^{0}_{s}$ decays is\nstudied for the first time. The data are recorded by the LHCb experiment in\n$pp$ collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3fb$^{-1}$ at\ncenter-of-mass energies of $7$ and $8$TeV. A time-dependent analysis of the\n$B^{0}_{s} \\to \\phi \\gamma$ decay rate is conducted to determine the parameter\n${\\mathcal{A}}^\\Delta$, which is related to the ratio of right- over\nleft-handed photon polarization amplitudes in $b \\to s \\gamma$ transitions. A\nvalue of ${\\mathcal{A}}^\\Delta=-0.98^{\\,+0.46\\,+0.23}_{\\,-0.52\\,-0.20}$ is\nmeasured. This result is consistent with the Standard Model prediction within\ntwo standard deviations.\n", "  Magnetic fields, which play a major role in a large number of astrophysical\nprocesses from galactic to cosmological scales, can be traced via observations\nof dust polarization as demonstrated by the Planck satellite results. In\nparticular, low-resolution observations of dust polarization have demonstrated\nthat Galactic filamentary structures, where star formation takes place, are\nassociated to well organized magnetic fields. A better understanding of this\nprocess requires detailed observations of galactic dust polarization on scales\nof 0.01 to 0.1 pc. Such high-resolution polarization observations can be\ncarried out at the IRAM 30 m telescope using the recently installed NIKA2\ncamera, which features two frequency bands at 260 and 150 GHz (respectively\n1.15 and 2.05 mm), the 260 GHz band being polarization sensitive. NIKA2 so far\nin commissioning phase, has its focal plane filled with ~3300 detectors to\ncover a Field of View (FoV) of 6.5 arcminutes diameter. The NIKA camera, which\nconsisted of two arrays of 132 and 224 Lumped Element Kinetic Inductance\nDetectors (LEKIDs) and a FWHM (Full-Width-Half-Maximum) of 12 and 18.2\narcsecond at 1.15 and 2.05 mm respectively, has been operated at the IRAM 30 m\ntelescope from 2012 to 2015 as a test-bench for NIKA2. NIKA was equipped of a\nroom temperature polarization system (a half wave plate (HWP) and a grid\npolarizer facing the NIKA cryostat window). The fast and continuous rotation of\nthe HWP permits the quasi simultaneous reconstruction of the three Stokes\nparameters, I, Q and U at 150 and 260 GHz. This paper presents the first\npolarization measurements with KIDs and reports the polarization performance of\nthe NIKA camera and the pertinence of the choice of the polarization setup in\nthe perspective of NIKA2. (abridged)\n", "  Bell inequalities (BIs) derived in terms of quantum probability statistics\nare extended to general bipartite-entangled states of arbitrary spins with\nparallel polarization. The original formula of Bell for the two-spin singlet is\nslightly modified in the parallel configuration, while, the inequality for-\nmulated by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt remains not changed. The violation of BIs\nindeed resulted from the quantum non-local correlation for spin-1=2 case.\nHowever, the inequalities are always satisfied for the spin-1 entangled states\nregardless of parallel or antiparallel polarizations of two spins. The spin\nparity effect originally demonstrated with the antiparallel spin-polarizations\n(Mod. Phys. Lett. B28, 145004) still exists for the parallel case. The quantum\nnon-locality does not lead to the violation for integer spins due to the\ncancellation of non-local interference effects by the quantum\nstatistical-average. Again the violation of BIs seems a result of the\nmeasurement induced nontrivial Berry-phase for half-integer spins.\n", "  We review a new approach to open heavy flavor production in heavy ion\ncollisions based on Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). We include both\nfinite heavy quark masses in the SCET Lagrangian and Glauber gluons that\ndescribe the interaction of collinear partons with the hot and dense QCD\nmedium. From the new effective field theory, we derive massive in-medium\nsplitting kernels and propose a new framework for including in-medium\ninteractions consistent with next-to-leading order calculations in QCD. We\npresent numerical results for the suppression of $D$- and $B$-mesons and\ncompare to results obtained within the traditional approach to parton energy\nloss. We find good agreement when comparing to existing data from the LHC at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV and 2.76 TeV.\n", "  Computer simulations are used widely across the engineering and science\ndisciplines, including in the research and development of magnetic devices\nusing computational micromagnetics. In this work, we identify and review\ndifferent approaches to configuring simulation runs: (i) the re-compilation of\nsource code, (ii) the use of configuration files, (iii) the graphical user\ninterface, and (iv) embedding the simulation specification in an existing\nprogramming language to express the computational problem. We identify the\nadvantages and disadvantages of different approaches and discuss their\nimplications on effectiveness and reproducibility of computational studies and\nresults. Following on from this, we design and describe a domain specific\nlanguage for micromagnetics that is embedded in the Python language, and allows\nusers to define the micromagnetic simulations they want to carry out in a\nflexible way. We have implemented this micromagnetic simulation description\nlanguage together with a computational backend that executes the simulation\ntask using the Object Oriented MicroMagnetic Framework (OOMMF). We illustrate\nthe use of this Python interface for OOMMF by solving the micromagnetic\nstandard problem 4. All the code is publicly available and is open source.\n", "  In the context of structure formation with ultralight axion dark matter, we\noffer an alternative explanation for the mass relation of solitonic cores and\ntheir host halos observed in numerical simulations. Our argument is based\nentirely on the mass gain that occurs during major mergers of binary cores and\nlargely independent of the initial core-halo mass relation assigned to hosts\nthat have just collapsed. We find a relation between the halo mass $M_h$ and\ncorresponding core mass $M_c$, $M_c\\propto M_h^{2\\beta-1}$, where $(1-\\beta)$\nis the core mass loss fraction. Following the evolution of core masses in\nstochastic merger trees, we find empirical evidence for our model. Our results\nare useful for statistically modeling the effects of dark matter cores on the\nproperties of galaxies and their substructures in axion dark matter\ncosmologies.\n", "  We compare mass-selected close pairs at z > 1 with the intrinsic galaxy\nmerger rate in the Illustris Simulations. To do so, we construct three 140\narcmin^2 lightcone catalogs and measure pair fractions, finding that they\nchange little or decrease with increasing redshift at z > 1. Consistent with\ncurrent surveys, this trend requires a decrease in the merger-pair\nobservability time, roughly as (1 + z)^-2, in order to measure the merger rates\nof the same galaxies. This implies that major mergers are more common at high\nredshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant\nobservability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction\nof massive, major (4:1) pairs which merge by today increases weakly from ~0.5\nat z=1 to ~0.8 at z=3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and\nfinal remnant decreases by a factor of two from z~1 to z~3. (3) An increasing\nspecific star formation rate (sSFR) decreases the time during which common\nstellar-mass based pair selection criteria could identify the mergers. The\naverage orbit of the pairs at observation time varies only weakly, suggesting\nthat the dynamical time is not varying enough to account by itself for the pair\nfraction trends. Merging pairs reside in dense regions, having overdensity ~10\nto ~100 times greater than the average massive galaxy. We forward model the\npairs to reconstruct the merger remnant production rate, showing that it is\nconsistent with a rapid increase in galaxy merger rates at z > 1.\n", "  We report the first observation of Rabi oscillations in the spin-7/2 ensemble\nof trivalent gadolinium ions hosted in CaWO$_4$ single crystal. A number of\ntransitions within the lowest electronic multiplet $^8S_{7/2}$ of Gd$^{3+}$ ion\nare studied using a combination of continuous-wave and pulsed electron\nparamagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The corresponding Rabi damping curves and\nthe spin coherence times are detected at varying strengths of the microwave\nfield. These data are well reproduced by a theoretical model which accounts for\nthe intrinsic inhomogeneity of the microwave field within the microwave\nresonator and the magnetic dipole interactions in the diluted spin ensemble.\nThe results indicate that the studied 8-level ground manifold of Gd$^{3+}$ ion\ncan represent an effective three qubit quantum system.\n", "  We study the dipion transitions $\\Upsilon(4S) \\rightarrow \\Upsilon(nS)\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ $(n=1,2)$. In particular, we consider the effects of the two\nintermediate bottomoniumlike exotic states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ as\nwell as bottom meson loops. The strong pion-pion final-state interactions,\nespecially including channel coupling to $K\\bar{K}$ in the $S$-wave, are taken\ninto account model-independently by using dispersion theory. Based on a\nnonrelativistic effective field theory we find that the contribution from the\nbottom meson loops is comparable to those from the chiral contact terms and the\n$Z_b$-exchange terms. For the $\\Upsilon(4S) \\rightarrow \\Upsilon(2S)\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay, the result shows that including the effects of the\n$Z_b$-exchange and the bottom meson loops can naturally reproduce the two-hump\nbehavior of the $\\pi\\pi$ mass spectra. Future angular distribution data are\ndecisive for the identification of different production mechanisms. For the\n$\\Upsilon(4S) \\rightarrow \\Upsilon(1S) \\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay, we show that there is\na narrow dip around 1 GeV in the $\\pi\\pi$ invariant mass distribution, caused\nby the final-state interactions. The distribution is clearly different from\nthat in similar transitions from lower $\\Upsilon$ states, and needs to be\nverified by future data with high statistics. Also we predict the decay width\nand the dikaon mass distribution of the $\\Upsilon(4S) \\rightarrow \\Upsilon(1S)\nK^+ K^-$ process.\n", "  We study a system of interacting matter quasiparticles strongly coupled to\nphotons inside an optomechanical cavity. The resulting normal modes of the\nsystem are represented by hybrid polaritonic quasiparticles, which acquire\neffective nonlinearity. Its strength is influenced by the presence of the\nmechanical mode and depends on the resonance frequency of the cavity. This\nleads to an interactive type of optomechanical coupling, being distinct from\nthe previously studied dispersive and dissipative couplings in optomechanical\nsystems. The emergent interactive coupling is shown to generate effective\noptical nonlinearity terms of high order, being quartic in the polariton\nnumber. We consider particular systems of exciton-polaritons and dipolaritons,\nand show that the induced effective optical nonlinearity due to the interactive\ncoupling can exceed in magnitude the strength of Kerr nonlinear terms, such as\nthose arising from polariton-polariton interactions. As applications, we show\nthat the higher order terms give rise to localized bright flat top solitons,\nwhich may form spontaneously in polariton condensates.\n", "  In this paper, a Bose-Hubbard extension of a Weyl semimetal is proposed that\ncan be realized for ultracold atoms using laser assisted tunneling and Feshbach\nresonance technique in three dimensional optical lattices. The global phase\ndiagram is obtained consisting of a superfluid phase and various Mott insulator\nphases by using Landau theory. The Bogoliubov excitation modes for the weakly\ninteracting case have nontrivial properties (Weyl nodes, bosonic surface arc,\netc.) analogs of those in Weyl semimetals of electronic systems, which are\nsmoothly carried over to that of Bloch bands for the noninteracting case. The\nproperties of the insulating phases for the strongly interacting case are\nexplored by calculating both the quasiparticle and quasihole dispersion\nrelation, which shows two quasiparticle spectra touch at Weyl nodes.\n", "  We present a novel mechanism of s-wave pairing in Fe-based superconductors.\nThe mechanism involves holes near dxz/dyz pockets only and is applicable\nprimarily to strongly hole doped materials. We argue that as long as the\nrenormalized Hund's coupling J exceeds the renormalized inter-orbital Hubbard\nrepulsion U', any finite spin-orbit coupling gives rise to s-wave\nsuperconductivity. This holds even at weak coupling and regardless of the\nstrength of the intra-orbital Hubbard repulsion U. The transition temperature\ngrows as the hole density decreases. The pairing gaps are four-fold symmetric,\nbut anisotropic, with the possibility of eight accidental nodes along the\nlarger pocket. The resulting state is consistent with the experiments on\nKFe2As2.\n", "  In this paper, a numerical study on the complete synchronization phenomenon\nexhibited by coupled forced negative conductance circuits is presented. The\nnonlinear system exhibiting two types of chaotic attractors is studied for\ncomplete synchronization of the identical chaotic attractors through phase\nportraits under one type of coupling. The stability of the synchronized states\nis observed for different coupling schemes of the circuit variables through\n{\\emph{Master Stability Function}}. The Conditional lyapunov exponents\nexplaining the dynamical behaviour of the driven system is presented.\n", "  The tightening of the constraints on the standard thermal WIMP scenario has\nforced physicists to propose alternative dark matter (DM) models. One of the\nmost popular alternate explanations of the origin of DM is the non-thermal\nproduction of DM via freeze-in. In this scenario the DM never attains thermal\nequilibrium with the thermal soup because of its feeble coupling strength\n($\\sim 10^{-12}$) with the other particles in the thermal bath and is generally\ncalled the Feebly Interacting Massive Particle (FIMP). In this work, we present\na gauged U(1)$_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ extension of the Standard Model (SM) which\nhas a scalar FIMP DM candidate and can consistently explain the DM relic\ndensity bound. In addition, the spontaneous breaking of the\nU(1)$_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ gauge symmetry gives an extra massive neutral gauge\nboson $Z_{\\mu\\tau}$ which can explain the muon ($g-2$) data through its\nadditional one-loop contribution to the process. Lastly, presence of three\nright-handed neutrinos enable the model to successfully explain the small\nneutrino masses via the Type-I seesaw mechanism. The presence of the\nspontaneously broken U(1)$_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ gives a particular structure to\nthe light neutrino mass matrix which can explain the peculiar mixing pattern of\nthe light neutrinos.\n", "  In this work the relativistic mean field (RMF) FSUGold model extended to\ninclude hyperons is employed to study the properties of neutron stars with\nstrong magnetic fields. The chaotic magnetic field approximation is utilized.\nThe effect of the anomalous magnetic moments (AMMs) is also investigated. It is\nshown that the equation of state (EOS)of neutron star matter is stiffened by\nthe presence of the magnetic field, which increases the maximum mass of neutron\nstar by around 6%. The AMMs only have a small influence on the EOS of neutron\nstar matter, and increase the maximum mass of neutron star by 0.02 M$_{sun}$.\nNeutral particles are spin polarized due to the presence of the AMMs.\n", "  We investigate the scattering of an electron by phonons in a small structure\nbetween two one-dimensional tight-binding leads. This model mimics the quantum\nelectron transport through atomic wires or molecular junctions coupled to\nmetallic leads. The electron-phonon coupled structure is represented by the\nHolstein model. We observe permanent energy transfer from the electron to the\nphonon system (dissipation), transient self-trapping of the electron in the\nelectron-phonon coupled structure (due to polaron formation and multiple\nreflections at the structure edges), and transmission resonances that depend\nstrongly on the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the adiabaticity\nratio. A recently developed TEBD algorithm, optimized for bosonic degrees of\nfreedom, is used to simulate the quantum dynamics of a wave packet launched\nagainst the electron-phonon coupled structure. Exact results are calculated for\na single electron-phonon site using scattering theory and analytical\napproximations are obtained for limiting cases.\n", "  Quark Wars is an all-new, adventure style game. We recommended playing it\noutdoors. Quark Wars is modeled upon the outdoor game called Hungarian Number\nWar, with notable influence from Star Wars, the American epic space saga. The\nplayers form two opposing teams. Both teams elect their own leader. The team\nmembers and their leaders wear particle war bonnets on their foreheads. These\nheaddresses consist of three or four cards indicating combinations of\nelementary particles. The two teams compete by identifying (reading out loudly)\nthe elementary particle cards on the foreheads of their adversaries. Players\nare allowed to use the terrain to cover their particle identity on their\nforeheads and may try to hide, run, or band together in a group to win. Quark\nWars was tested at a Summer Camp of Berze Science Club in Hungary. Students\nloved playing Quark Wars, as this game resulted in lots of hilarity and action.\nIn addition, Quark Wars also solidified particle terminology and made the\nconcept of particle identification and discovery more tangible to\nsecondary/middle school students.\n", "  Titanium oxides have many fascinating optical and electrical properties, such\nas the superconductivity at 2.0 K in cubic titanium monoxide TiO\npolycrystalline bulk. However, the lack of TiO single crystals or epitaxial\nfilms has prevented systematic investigations on its superconductivity. Here,\nwe report the basic superconductivity characterizations of cubic TiO films\nepitaxially grown on (0001)-oriented Al2O3 substrates. The magnetic and\nelectronic transport measurements confirmed that TiO is a type-II\nsuperconductor and the record high Tc is about 7.4 K. The lower critical field\n(Hc1) at 1.9 K, the extrapolated upper critical field Hc2(0) and coherence\nlength are about 18 Oe, 13.7 T and 4.9 nm, respectively. With increasing\npressure, the value of Tc shifts to lower temperature while the normal state\nresistivity increases. Our results on the superconducting TiO films confirm the\nstrategy to achieve higher Tc in epitaxial films, which may be helpful for\nfinding more superconducting materials in various related systems.\n", "  We suggest and demonstrate an all-optical quantum simulator for single-qubit\nnoisy channels originating from the interaction with a fluctuating field. The\nsimulator employs the polarization degree of freedom of a single photon, and\nexploits its spectral components to average over the realizations of the\nstochastic dynamics. As a proof of principle, we run simulations of dephasing\nchannels driven either by Gaussian (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) or non-Gaussian (random\ntelegraph) stochastic processes.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to propose a novel methodology to deal with\nmicro-structural boundary conditions for the analysis of granular materials.\nThe response of the granular assembly is modelled through the discrete element\nmethod (DEM), consistent with a micro-macro homogenization scheme formulated in\nthe transition from a continuous to a discrete setting. The three classical\ntypes of boundary conditions (displacement, periodic and displacement) are\nimplemented with a servo-control method. Two types of algorithms are developed,\nwhich consider or not an initial prediction for the displacement field of the\nparticles. Additionally, to simulate in a more realistic manner the effect of\nmacroscopic deformation on the micro-structure, a mixed type of boundary\nconditions is introduced, i.e. a combination of classical boundary conditions.\nThe effectiveness of the algorithms is tested on a series of DEM simulations.\nThe influence of the micro-structural morphology and of the size of the\nmicro-structure on the overall response is finally investigated.\n", "  We consider a model of semi-flexible interacting self-avoiding trails\n(sISAT's) on a lattice, where the walks are constrained to visit each lattice\nedge at most once. Such models have been studied as an alternative to the\nself-attracting self-avoiding walks (SASAW) to investigate the collapse\ntransition of polymers, with the attractive interactions being on site, as\nopposed to nearest-neighbor interactions in SASAW. The grand-canonical version\nof the sISAT model is solved on a four-coordinated Bethe lattice, and four\nphases appear: non-polymerized (NP), regular polymerized (P), dense polymerized\n(DP) and anisotropic nematic (AN), the last one present in the phase diagram\nonly for sufficiently stiff chains. The last two phases are dense, in the sense\nthat all lattice sites are visited once in AN phase and twice in DP phase. In\ngeneral, critical NP-P and DP-P transition surfaces meet with a NP-DP\ncoexistence surface at a line of bicritical points. The region in which the AN\nphase is stable is limited by a discontinuous critical transition to the P\nphase, and we study this somewhat unusual transition in some detail. In the\nlimit of rods, where the chains are totally rigid, the P phase is absent and\nthe three coexistence lines (NP-AN, AN-DP, and NP-DP) meet at a triple point,\nwhich is the endpoint of the bicritical line.\n", "  The dipole-nucleus forward scattering amplitude rules the onset of the gluon\nanomalous dimension, in the Color-Glass Condensate regime. In this model, the\nonset of quantum regime is here derived as a critical stable point in the\nnuclear configurational entropy, matching the fitted experimental data in the\nliterature with accuracy of 1%. It corroborates with the informational entropy\nparadigm in high energy nuclear physics.\n", "  We study magnetic, transport and thermodynamic properties of the half-filled\ntwo-dimensional ($2D$) Hubbard model with layered distributed repulsive\ninteractions using unbiased finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo simulations.\nAntiferromagnetic long-ranged correlations at $T=0$ are confirmed by means of\nthe magnetic structure factor and the onset of short-ranged ones is at a\nminimum temperature which can be obtained by peaks in susceptibility and\nspecific heat following an RPA prediction. We also show that transport is\naffected in the large interaction limit and is enhanced in the non-repulsive\nlayers suggesting a change of dimensionality induced by increased interactions.\nLastly, we show that by adiabatically switching the interactions in layered\ndistributed patterns reduces the overall temperature of the system with a\npotential application in cooling protocols in cold atoms systems.\n", "  We report on recent study of the production of forward di-jets in\nproton-proton and proton-lead collisions at the Large Hadron Collider with\nImproved Transversal Momentum Factorization \\cite{vanHameren:2016ftb}. The\nresults as compared to results obtained within High Energy Factorization show\nnoticable effects related to detailed treatment of nonlinear effects.\n", "  We report on a first study of 4-jet production in a high energy factorization\n(HEF) framework \\cite{Kutak:2016mik,Kutak:2016ukc}. We include and discuss\ncontributions from both single-parton scattering (SPS) and double-parton\nscattering (DPS) and compare to the measured data. The DPS HEF result is\nconsiderably smaller than the one obtained with collinear factorization. The\nmechanism leading to this difference is of kinematical nature. In contrast to\nthe collinear approach, the HEF approach nicely describes the distribution of\nthe $\\Delta S$ variable, which involves all four jets and their angular\ncorrelations.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of the return amplitude following a sudden quench in\nthe three-state quantum Potts chain. For quenches crossing the quantum critical\npoint from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase, the corresponding rate\nfunction is non-analytic at critical times and behaves linearly in their\nvicinity. In particular, we find no indication of a link between the time\nevolution close to the critical times and the scaling properties of the quantum\ncritical point in the Potts chain.\n", "  Ryabinkin, Kohut, and Staroverov (RKS) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 083001 (2015)]\ndevised an iterative method for reducing many-electron wave functions to\nKohn-Sham exchange-correlation potentials, $v_\\text{XC}(\\mathbf{r})$. For a\ngiven type of wave function, the RKS method is exact (Kohn-Sham-compliant) in\nthe basis-set limit; in a finite basis set, it produces an approximation to the\ncorresponding basis-set-limit $v_\\text{XC}(\\mathbf{r})$. The original RKS\nprocedure works very well for large basis sets but sometimes fails for commonly\nused (small and medium) sets. We derive a modification of the method's working\nequation that makes the RKS procedure robust for all Gaussian basis sets and\nincreases the accuracy of the resulting exchange-correlation potentials with\nrespect to the basis-set limit.\n", "  Magnetization, neutron diffraction, and high-energy x-ray diffraction results\nfor Sn-flux grown single-crystal samples of\nCa(Co$_{1-x}$Fe$_{x}$)$_{y}$As$_{2}$, $0\\leq x\\leq1$, $1.86\\leq y \\leq 2$, are\npresented and reveal that A-type antiferromagnetic order, with ordered moments\nlying along the $c$ axis, persists for $x\\lesssim0.12(1)$. The\nantiferromagnetic order is smoothly suppressed with increasing $x$, with both\nthe ordered moment and N\\'{e}el temperature linearly decreasing. Stripe-type\nantiferromagnetic order does not occur for $x\\leq0.25$, nor does ferromagnetic\norder for $x$ up to at least $x=0.104$, and a smooth crossover from the\ncollapsed-tetragonal (cT) phase of CaCo$_{1.86}$As$_{2}$ to the tetragonal (T)\nphase of CaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ occurs. These results suggest that hole doping\nCaCo$_{1.86}$As$_{2}$ has a less dramatic effect on the magnetism and structure\nthan steric effects due to substituting Sr for Ca.\n", "  The analysis of high-energy particle collisions is an excellent testbed for\nthe non-extensive statistical approach. In these reactions we are far from the\nthermodynamical limit. In small colliding systems, such as electron-positron or\nnuclear collisions, the number of particles is several orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the Avogadro number; therefore, finite-size and fluctuation\neffects strongly influence the final-state one-particle energy distributions.\nDue to the simple characterization, the description of the identified hadron\nspectra with the Boltzmann-Gibbs thermodynamical approach is insufficient.\nThese spectra can be described very well with Tsallis-Pareto distributions\ninstead, derived from non-extensive thermodynamics. Using the $q$-entropy\nformula, we interpret the microscopic physics in terms of the Tsallis $q$ and\n$T$ parameters. In this paper we give a view on these parameters, analyzing\nidentified hadron spectra from recent years in a wide center-of-mass energy\nrange. We demonstrate that the fitted Tsallis-parameters show dependency on the\ncenter-of-mass energy and particle species (mass). Our findings are described\nwell by a QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics) inspired parton evolution ansatz. Based\non this comprehensive study, apart from the evolution, both mesonic and\nbaryonic components found to be non-extensive ($q>1$), besides the mass ordered\nhierarchy observed in the parameter $T$. We also study and compare in details\nthe theory-obtained parameters for the case of PYTHIA8 Monte Carlo Generator,\nperturbative QCD and quark coalescence models.\n", "  Studies of the $\\gamma$-ray strength functions can reveal useful information\nconcerning underlying nuclear structure. Accumulated experimental data on the\nstrength functions show an enhancement in the low $\\gamma$ energy region. We\nhave calculated the M1 strength functions for the $^{49,50}$Cr and $^{48}$V\nnuclei in the $f_{7/2}$ shell-model basis. We find a low-energy enhancement for\ngamma decay similar to that obtained for other nuclei in previous studies, but\nfor the first time we are also able to study the complete distribution related\nto M1 emission and absorption. We find that M1 strength distribution peaks at\nzero transition energy and falls off exponentially. The height of the peak and\nthe slope of the exponential are approximately independent of the nuclei\nstudied in this model space and the range of initial angular momenta. We show\nthat the slope of the exponential fall off is proportional to the energy of the\n$T=1$ pairing gap.\n", "  In this article we present a new prepare and measure quantum key distribution\nprotocol that decouples the necessary quantum channel error estimation from its\ndependency on sifting, or otherwise post-selecting, the detection outcomes.\nRather than estimating Eve's coupling to the quantum channel from the\nstatistics of the sifted key, we infer this information from weak measurements\nmade equally on all of the received photons immediately prior to post-selection\nby the photon detectors. We prove that the accuracy of the weak measurement\nparameter estimation is robust to reasonable device imperfections, even in an\nadversarial environment, and hence the asymptotic security of this protocol can\nbe inferred from the security analysis of BB84. In addition to eliminating\ndetector basis-dependent attacks, such as detector blinding, we demonstrate\nthat this new prepared and measure QKD protocol is immune to a very powerful\nclass of measurement-side device attacks that also allow an adversary control\nof the weak measurement outcomes given two modest requirements placed on the\nmeasurement-side devices. Finally, we compare the asymptotically achievable\nsecure key rate of a decoy state version of the weak measurement protocol and\nshow it is essentially equal to that of BB84 with decoy states and\nsignificantly higher than MDI-QKD for realistic system parameters.\n", "  The Boltzmann equation is an integro-differential equation which describes\nthe density function of the distribution of the velocities of the molecules of\ndilute monoatomic gases under the assumption that the energy is only\ntransferred via collisions between the molecules. In 1956 Kac studied the\nBoltzmann equation and defined a property of the density function that he\ncalled the \"Boltzmann property\" which describes the behavior of the density\nfunction at a given fixed time as the number of particles tends to infinity.\nThe Boltzmann property has been studied extensively since then, and now it is\nsimply called chaos, or Kac's chaos. On the other hand, in ergodic theory,\nchaos usually refers to the mixing properties of a dynamical system as time\ntends to infinity. A relationship is derived between Kac's chaos and the notion\nof mixing.\n", "  Quarks can be represented on the faces of the 3x3 Rubik's cube with the help\nof a symbolic representation of quarks and anti-quarks, that was delevoped\noriginally for a deck of elementary particle cards, called Quark Matter Card\nGame. Cubing the cards leads to a model of the nearly perfect fluid of Quark\nMatter on Rubik's cube, or Qbe, which can be utilized to provide hands-on\nexperience with the high entropy density, overall color neutrality and net\nbaryon free, nearly perfect fluid nature of Quark Matter.\n", "  The Bessis-Moussa-Villani conjecture states that the trace of $\\exp(A-tB)$\nis, as a function of the real variable $t$, the Laplace transform of a positive\nmeasure, where $A$ and $B$ are respectively a hermitian and positive\nsemi-definite matrix. The long standing conjecture was recently proved by Stahl\nand streamlined by Eremenko. We report on a more concise yet self-contained\nversion of the proof.\n", "  This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in\nequation which we use from Ref. 7 that is incorrect. In particular, Eq.(1-8) is\nnot the correct equation from the variation of N. See, for example, Eq.(6) in\nPRD93, 064043 (2016) for phi = 0 case.\n", "  Using the generalized tortoise coordinate transformations the quantum\nradiation properties of Klein-Gordon scalar particles, Maxwell's\nelectromagnetic field equations and Dirac equations are investigated in general\nnon-stationary black hole. The locations of the event horizon and the Hawking\ntemperature depend on both time and angles. A new extra coupling effect is\nobserved in the thermal radiation spectrum of Maxwell's equations and Dirac\nequations which is absent in the thermal radiation spectrum of scalar\nparticles. We also observe that the chemical potential derived from scalar\nparticles is equal to the highest energy of the negative energy state of the\nscalar particle in the non-thermal radiation in general non-stationary black\nhole. Applying generalized tortoise coordinate transformation a constant term\n$\\xi$ is produced in the expression of thermal radiation in general\nnon-stationary black hole. It indicates that generalized tortoise coordinate\ntransformation is more accurate and reliable in the study of thermal radiation\nof black hole.\n", "  The conformal crossing equation puts very stringent constraints on the\nconformal data. We formulate it in way that makes the conformal symmetry more\ntransparent. This allows for generalization of the crossing equation to\narbitrary Lie group G. Using the crossing equation for SU(2) as a toy model, we\nfind infinitely many solutions to the G-crossing equation. In particular, when\nG is specialized to the conformal group SO(d+1,1), we get infinitely many\nsolutions to the conformal crossing equation.\n", "  In a search for new white dwarfs in DR12 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nKepler et al. (2016) found atmospheric parameters for thousands of objects with\neffective temperatures below 20,000 K and surface gravities between 5.5 <\nlog(g) < 6.5. They classified these objects as cool subdwarfs -- sdA -- and\nspeculated that many may be extremely low-mass (ELM) white dwarfs (helium-core\nwhite dwarfs with masses below 0.3 Msun). We present evidence -- using radial\nvelocities, photometric colors, and reduced proper motions -- that the vast\nmajority (>99%) of these objects are unlikely to be ELM white dwarfs. Their\ntrue identity remains an interesting question.\n", "  Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography (UOT) is a technique that images\noptical contrast deep inside scattering media. Heterodyne holography is a\npromising tool able to detect the UOT tagged photons with high efficiency. In\nthis work, we describe theoretically the detection of the tagged photon in\nheterodyne holography based UOT, show how to filter the untagged photon, and\ndiscuss the effect of shot noise. The discussion considers also speckle\ndecorrelation. We show that optimal detection sensitivity can be reached, if\nthe frame exposure time of the camera used to perform the holographic detection\nis of the order of the decorrelation time.\n", "  The observed constraints on the variability of the proton to electron mass\nratio $\\mu$ and the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ are used to establish\nconstraints on the variability of the Quantum Chromodynamic Scale and a\ncombination of the Higgs Vacuum Expectation Value and the Yukawa couplings.\nFurther model dependent assumptions provide constraints on the Higgs VEV and\nthe Yukawa couplings separately. A primary conclusion is that limits on the\nvariability of dimensionless fundamental constants such as $\\mu$ and $\\alpha$\nprovide important constraints on the parameter space of new physics and\ncosmologies.\n", "  In the last decades, it has been understood that a wide variety of phenomena\nin quantum field theory (QFT) can be characterised using quantum information\nmeasures, such as the entanglement entropy of a state and the relative entropy\nbetween quantum states in the same Hilbert space. In this thesis, we use these\nand other tools from quantum information theory to study several interesting\nproblems in quantum field theory. The topics analysed range from the study of\nthe Aharonov-Bohm effect in QFT using entanglement entropy, to the consistence\nof the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (proposed in the context of the AdS/CFT duality)\nusing properties of relative entropy. We show that relative entropy can also be\nused to obtain new interesting quantum energy inequalities, that constrain the\nspatial distribution of negative energy density.\n", "  We develop a model to compute the first-passage time of a random walker in a\ncrowded environment. Hard-core particles with the same size and diffusion\ncoefficient than the tracer diffuse, and the model allows to compute the first\npassage time of the tracer on euclidian lattices. The result is compared to\nclassical Nakazato-Kitahara model, and extends previous results obtained for\npersistent random walker. The crowding in a confined media acts as a memory\neffect, and thus lead to a persistent-like behavior.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a ring geometry all-fiber cavity system for\ncavity quantum electrodynamics with an ensemble of cold atoms. The fiber cavity\ncontains a nanofiber section which mediates atom-light interactions through an\nevanescent field. We observe well-resolved, vacuum Rabi splitting of the cavity\ntransmission spectrum in the weak driving limit due to a collective enhancement\nof the coupling rate by the ensemble of atoms within the evanescent field, and\nwe present a simple theoretical model to describe this. In addition, we\ndemonstrate a method to control and stabilize the resonant frequency of the\ncavity by utilizing the thermal properties of the nanofiber.\n", "  Unidirectional magnetic domain-wall motion is a key concept underlying\nnext-generation application devices. Such motion has been recently demonstrated\nby applying an alternating magnetic field, resulting in the coherent\nunidirectional motion of magnetic bubbles. Here we report the optimal\nconfiguration of applied magnetic field for the magnetic bubblecade, the\ncoherent unidirectional motion of magnetic bubbles, driven by a tilted\nalternating magnetic field. The tilted alternating magnetic field induces\nasymmetric expansion and shrinkage of the magnetic bubbles under the influence\nof the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, resulting in continuous shift of the\nbubbles in time. By realizing the magnetic bubblecade in PtCoPt films, we find\nthat the bubblecade speed is sensitive to the tilt angle with a maximum at an\nangle, which can be explained well by a simple analytical form within the\ncontext of the domain-wall creep theory. A simplified analytic formula for the\nangle for maximum speed is then given as a function of the amplitude of the\nalternating magnetic field. The present observation provides a practical design\nrule for memory and logic devices based on the magnetic bubblecade.\n", "  We introduce a new paradigm that is important for community detection in the\nrealm of network analysis. Networks contain a set of strong, dominant\ncommunities, which interfere with the detection of weak, natural community\nstructure. When most of the members of the weak communities also belong to\nstronger communities, they are extremely hard to be uncovered. We call the weak\ncommunities the hidden community structure.\n  We present a novel approach called HICODE (HIdden COmmunity DEtection) that\nidentifies the hidden community structure as well as the dominant community\nstructure. By weakening the strength of the dominant structure, one can uncover\nthe hidden structure beneath. Likewise, by reducing the strength of the hidden\nstructure, one can more accurately identify the dominant structure. In this\nway, HICODE tackles both tasks simultaneously.\n  Extensive experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that HICODE\noutperforms several state-of-the-art community detection methods in uncovering\nboth the dominant and the hidden structure. In the Facebook university social\nnetworks, we find multiple non-redundant sets of communities that are strongly\nassociated with residential hall, year of registration or career position of\nthe faculties or students, while the state-of-the-art algorithms mainly locate\nthe dominant ground truth category. In the Due to the difficulty of labeling\nall ground truth communities in real-world datasets, HICODE provides a\npromising approach to pinpoint the existing latent communities and uncover\ncommunities for which there is no ground truth. Finding this unknown structure\nis an extremely important community detection problem.\n", "  Single-phased, single-oriented thin films of Mn-doped ZnAs-based diluted\nmagnetic semiconductor (DMS) Ba1-xKx(Zn1-yMny)2As2 (x = 0.03, 0.08; y = 0.15)\nhave been deposited on Si, SrTiO3, LaAlO3, (La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3, and MgAl2O4\nsubstrates, respectively. Utilizing a combined synthesis and characterization\nsystem excluding the air and further optimizing the deposition parameters,\nhigh-quality thin films could be obtained and be measured showing that they can\nkeep inactive-in-air up to more than 90 hours characterized by electrical\ntransport measurements. In comparison with films of x = 0.03 which possess\nrelatively higher resistivity, weaker magnetic performances, and larger energy\ngap, thin films of x = 0.08 show better electrical and magnetic performances.\nStrong magnetic anisotropy was found in films of x = 0.08 grown on\n(La,Sr)(Al,Ta)O3 substrate with their magnetic polarization aligned almost\nsolely on the film growth direction.\n", "  The formation mechanism of CO clouds observed with NANTEN2 and Mopra\ntelescope toward the stellar cluster Westerlund 2 is studied by\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations taking into account the\ninterstellar cooling. These molecular clouds show a peculiar shape composing of\nan arc-shaped cloud in one side of a TeV-ray source HESS J1023-575 and a linear\ndistribution of clouds (jet clouds) in another side. We propose that these\nclouds are formed by the interaction of a jet with interstellar neutral\nhydrogen (HI) clumps. By studying the dependence of the shape of dense cold\nclouds formed by shock compression and cooling on the filling factor of HI\nclumps, we found that the density distribution of HI clumps determines the\nshape of molecular clouds formed by the jet-cloud interaction; arc-clouds are\nformed when the filling factor is large. On the other hand, when the filling\nfactor is small, molecular clouds align with the jet. The jet propagates faster\nin models with small filling factors.\n", "  The luminosity ratio of electrons to protons as it is produced in stochastic\nacceleration processes in cosmic ray sources is an important quantity relevant\nfor several aspects of the modeling of the sources themselves. It is usually\nassumed to be around 1:100 in the case of Galactic sources, while a value of\n1:10 is typically assumed when describing extragalactic sources. It is\nsupported by observations that the average ratios should be close to these\nvalues. At this point, however, there is no possibility to investigate how each\nindividual source behaves. When looking at the physics aspects, a 1:100 ratio\nis well supported in theory when making the following assumptions: (1) the\ntotal number of electrons and protons that is accelerated are the same; (2) the\nspectral index of both populations after acceleration is $a_e=a_p\\approx 2.2$.\nIn this paper, we reinvestigate these assumptions. In particular, assumption\n(2) is not supported by observational data of the sources and PIC simulation\nyield different spectral indices as well. We present the detailed calculation\nof the electron-to-proton ratio, dropping the assumption of equal spectral\nindices. We distinguish between the ratio of luminosities and the ratio of the\ndifferential spectral behavior, which becomes necessary for cases where the\nspectral indices of the two particle populations are not the same. We discuss\nthe possible range of values when allowing for different spectral indices\nconcerning the spectral behavior of electrons and protons. Additionally, it is\nshown that the minimum energy of the accelerated population can have a large\ninfluence on the results.\n", "  A majority part of magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars of the upper main\nsequence exhibits strictly periodic light, magnetic, radio, and spectral\nvariations that can be fully explained by the model of a rigidly rotating\nmain-sequence star with persistent surface structures and stable global\nmagnetic field frozen into the body of the star. Nevertheless, there is an\ninhomogeneous group consisting of a few mCP stars whose rotation periods vary\non timescales of decades, while the shapes of their phase curves remain nearly\nunchanged. Alternations in the rotational period variations, proven in the case\nof some of them, offer new insight on this theoretically unpredicted\nphenomenon. We present a novel and generally applicable method of period\nanalysis based on the simultaneous exploitation of all available observational\ndata containing phase information. This phenomenological method can monitor\ngradual changes in the observed instantaneous period very efficiently and\nreliably. We present up to date results of the period monitoring of V901~Ori,\nCU~Vir, $\\sigma$\\,Ori\\,E, and BS~Cir, known to be mCP stars changing their\nobserved periods and discuss the physics of this unusual behaviour. To compare\nthe period behavior of those stars, we treated their data with an orthogonal\npolynomial model, which was specifically developed for this purpose. We\nconfirmed period variations in all stars and showed that they reflect real\nchanges in the angular velocity of outer layers of the stars, fastened by their\nglobal magnetic fields. However, the nature of the observed rotational\ninstabilities has remained elusive up to now. The discussed group of mCP stars\nis inhomogeneous to such extent that each of the stars may experience a\ndifferent cause for its period variations.\n", "  We study the scattering of a long longitudinal radiating bulk strain solitary\nwave in the delaminated area of a two-layered elastic structure with soft\n(`imperfect') bonding between the layers within the scope of the coupled\nBoussinesq equations. The direct numerical modelling of this and similar\nproblems is challenging and has natural limitations. We develop a\nsemi-analytical approach, based on the use of several matched asymptotic\nmultiple-scale expansions and averaging with respect to the fast space\nvariable, leading to the coupled Ostrovsky equations in bonded regions and\nuncoupled Korteweg-de Vries equations in the delaminated region. We show that\nthe semi-analytical approach agrees well with direct numerical simulations and\nuse it to study the nonlinear dynamics and scattering of the radiating solitary\nwave in a wide range of bi-layers with delamination. The results indicate that\nradiating solitary waves could help us to control the integrity of layered\nstructures with imperfect interfaces.\n", "  Using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory and\nthe nonequilibrium Green function formalism, we studied the spin transport\nthrough metal-phthalocyanine (MPc, M=Ni, Fe, Co, Mn, Cr) molecules connected to\naurum nanowire electrodes. We found that the MnPc, FePc, and CrPc molecular\ndevices exhibit a perfect spin filtering effect compared to CoPc and NiPc.\nMoreover, negative differential resistance appears in FePc molecular devices.\nThe transmission coefficients at different bias voltages were further presented\nto understand this phenomenon. These results would be useful in designing\ndevices for future nanotechnology.\n", "  There are polarized structure functions $b_{1-4}$ for the spin-1 deuteron. We\ncalculated the leading-twist tensor structure function $b_1$ by using\nconvolution description for the deuteron. We found large differences between\nour theoretical functions and HERMES experimental data on $b_1$. Although\nhigher-twist effects should be considered in obtaining experimental $b_1$, it\nsuggests a possible existence of new hadron physics mechanism for spin-1\nhadrons. Furthermore, we found that there are significant distributions at\nlarge Bjorken $x$. In future, an experimental measurement is planned at JLab\nfor $b_1$ and there is a possibility of a proton-deuteron Drell-Yan experiment\nat Fermilab with the tensor-polarized deuteron, so that further theoretical\nstudies are needed for clarifying the physics origin of tensor structure in\nterms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom.\n", "  There is a review of the physical theories needing Dirac-Bergmann theory of\nconstraints at the Hamiltonian level due to the existence of gauge symmetries.\nIt contains:\n  i) the treatment of systems of point particles in special relativity both in\ninertial and non-inertial frames with a Wigner-covariant way of eliminating\nrelative times in relativistic bound states;\n  ii) the description of the electro-magnetic field in relativistic atomic\nphysics and of Yang-Mills fields in absence of Gribov ambiguity in particle\nphysics;\n  iii) the identification of the inertial gauge variables and of the physical\nvariables in canonical ADM tetrad gravity in presence of the electro-magnetic\nfield and of charged scalar point particles in asymptotically Minkowskian\nspace-times without super-translations by means of a Shanmugadhasan canonical\ntransformation to a York canonical basis adapted to ten of the 14 first-class\nconstraints and the definition of the Hamiltonian Post-Minkowskian weak field\nlimit.\n  Review paper for a chapter of a future book\n", "  Experimental studies of systems containing active proteins that undergo\nconformational changes driven by catalytic chemical reactions have shown that\nthe diffusion coefficients of passive tracer particles and active molecules are\nlarger than the corresponding values when chemical activity is absent. Various\nmechanisms have been proposed for such behavior, including, among others, force\ndipole interactions of molecular motors moving on filaments and collective\nhydrodynamic effects arising from active proteins. Simulations of a\nmulti-component system containing active dumbbell molecules that cycle between\nopen and closed states, a passive tracer particle and solvent molecules are\ncarried out. Consistent with experiments, it is shown that the diffusion\ncoefficients of both passive particles and the dumbbells themselves are\nenhanced when the dumbbells are active. The dependence of the diffusion\nenhancement on the volume fraction of dumbbells is determined, and the effects\nof crowding by active dumbbell molecules are shown to differ from those due to\ninactive molecules.\n", "  We present numerical simulations for modelling optoacoustic (OA) signals\nobserved in PVA hydrogel tissue phantoms. We review the computational approach\nto model the underlying mechanisms, i.e. optical absorption of laser energy and\nacoustic propagation of mechanical stress, geared towards experiments that\ninvolve absorbing media only. We apply the numerical procedure to model signals\nobserved in the acoustic near- and farfield in both, forward and backward\ndetection mode, in PVA hydrogel tissue phantoms (i.e. an elastic solid).\nFurther, we illustrate the computational approach by modeling OA signal for\nseveral experiments on dye solution (i.e. a liquid) reported in the literature,\nand benchmark the research code by comparing our fully 3D procedure to limiting\ncases described in terms of effectively 1D approaches.\n", "  The Data Activated Liu Graph Engine - DALiuGE - is an execution framework for\nprocessing large astronomical datasets at a scale required by the Square\nKilometre Array Phase 1 (SKA1). It includes an interface for expressing complex\ndata reduction pipelines consisting of both data sets and algorithmic\ncomponents and an implementation run-time to execute such pipelines on\ndistributed resources. By mapping the logical view of a pipeline to its\nphysical realisation, DALiuGE separates the concerns of multiple stakeholders,\nallowing them to collectively optimise large-scale data processing solutions in\na coherent manner. The execution in DALiuGE is data-activated, where each\nindividual data item autonomously triggers the processing on itself. Such\ndecentralisation also makes the execution framework very scalable and flexible,\nsupporting pipeline sizes ranging from less than ten tasks running on a laptop\nto tens of millions of concurrent tasks on the second fastest supercomputer in\nthe world. DALiuGE has been used in production for reducing interferometry data\nsets from the Karl E. Jansky Very Large Array and the Mingantu Ultrawide\nSpectral Radioheliograph; and is being developed as the execution framework\nprototype for the Science Data Processor (SDP) consortium of the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA) telescope. This paper presents a technical overview of\nDALiuGE and discusses case studies from the CHILES and MUSER projects that use\nDALiuGE to execute production pipelines. In a companion paper, we provide\nin-depth analysis of DALiuGE's scalability to very large numbers of tasks on\ntwo supercomputing facilities.\n", "  The convective stability associated with carbon sequestration is usually\ninvestigated by adopting an unsteady diffusive basic profile. The method of\nnormal modes is not applicable due to the time dependence of the nonlinear base\nprofile. Therefore, the instability is quantified either in terms of critical\ntimes at which the boundary layer instability sets in or in terms of long time\nevolution of initial disturbances. This paper adopts an unstably stratified\nbasic profile having a step function density with top heavy carbon saturated\nlayer (boundary layer) overlying a lighter carbon free layer (ambient brine).\nThe resulting configuration resembles that of the Rayleigh-Taylor problem with\nbuoyancy diffusion at the interface separating the two layers. The\ndiscontinuous reference state satisfies the governing system of equations and\nboundary conditions and pertains to an unstably stratified motionless state.\nOur model accounts for anisotropy in both diffusion and permeability and\nchemical reaction between the carbon dioxide rich brine and host mineralogy. We\nproceed by supposing that the carbon dioxide that has accumulated below the top\ncap rock forms a layer of carbon saturated brine of some thickness that\noverlies a carbon-free brine layer. The resulting stratification remains stable\nuntil the thickness of the carbon saturated layer is sufficient to induce the\nfluid to overturn. With this formulation for the reference state, the stability\ncalculations will be in terms of critical boundary layer thickness instead of\ncritical times, although the two formulations are homologous. This approach is\ntractable by the classical normal mode analysis. Even though it yields only\nconservative threshold instability conditions, it offers the advantage for an\nanalytically tractable linear and weakly nonlinear studies.\n", "  Blind source separation is a common processing tool to analyse the\nconstitution of pixels of hyperspectral images. Such methods usually suppose\nthat pure pixel spectra (endmembers) are the same in all the image for each\nclass of materials. In the framework of remote sensing, such an assumption is\nno more valid in the presence of intra-class variabilities due to illumination\nconditions, weathering, slight variations of the pure materials, etc... In this\npaper, we first describe the results of investigations highlighting intra-class\nvariability measured in real images. Considering these results, a new\nformulation of the linear mixing model is presented leading to two new methods.\nUnconstrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (UP-NMF) is a new blind source separation\nmethod based on the assumption of a linear mixing model, which can deal with\nintra-class variability. To overcome UP-NMF limitations an extended method is\nproposed, named Inertia-constrained Pixel-by-pixel NMF (IP-NMF). For each\nsensed spectrum, these extended versions of NMF extract a corresponding set of\nsource spectra. A constraint is set to limit the spreading of each source's\nestimates in IP-NMF. The methods are tested on a semi-synthetic data set built\nwith spectra extracted from a real hyperspectral image and then numerically\nmixed. We thus demonstrate the interest of our methods for realistic source\nvariabilities. Finally, IP-NMF is tested on a real data set and it is shown to\nyield better performance than state of the art methods.\n", "  We study the mass spectrum of mesons at high temperature in $SU(2)$ gauge\ntheory with two flavors of Dirac fundamental fermions. Numerical simulations\nare carried out on anisotropic lattices using Wilson fermions, with lattice\nparameters tuned so that Euclidean symmetry is restored at low energy. We\ndetermine the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ using renormalized Polyakov\nloops. We calculate temporal and spatial meson correlation functions across\n$T_c$, and observe a clear sign of parity doublings above $T_c$ in both vector\nand scalar channels. The degeneracy between parity partners in the spectrum\nindicates that the enhanced $SU(4) \\times U(1)_A$ global symmetry of the model\nis restored at high temperature.\n", "  In the present paper we give numerical estimations of the plasma ion electric\nmicrofield mixing dynamics rate. This rate was deduced from a quantum atomic\ndensity matrix formalism and corresponds to the mixing dynamics effect of\nenergy levels by the plasma ion electric microfield. The rate in question is to\nbe added to the usual collisional-radiative model for the modeling of\ndielectronic satellites originating from multi-excited atomic configurations to\ndiagnose high density plasma regimes generated by the interaction of X-ray free\nelectron lasers (XFEL's) with solid density matter. The obtained numerical\nvalues of this rate are compared to usual relaxation atomic rates of the\ncollisional-radiative model in the case of three atomic energy levels of the\ndoubly excited 2l2l' configuration of helium-like aluminium (Z = 13): 2p^2\n1D_2, 2s2p 1P_1 and 2p2 1S_0. The comparison is made for different values of\nthe electronic density n_e (10^+20, 10^+22, 10^+23, 10^+24 cm^-3) and for the\nelectronic temperature T_e = 500 eV. The numerical result shows that at high\ndensities this rate is at the same order of magnitude as usual\ncollisional-radiative rates and even exceed them in certain cases. This\ndemonstrates the potential role of this rate for a better understanding of the\nheating mechanism underlying the evolution of a solid state matter to a plasma.\n", "  Most of the studies on the adsorption of F$^-$ are experimental, and have\nbeen done with synthetic solutions. Such studies rarely mimic the field\nsituation. Therefore, selection of an adsorbent that can remove F$^-$ from any\nkind of feed requires models that can predict the adsorption behavior for any\ngiven set of input conditions. From our observations and as also reported by\nmany authors, the adsorption of F$^-$ is affected by the presence of many ions.\nWhen modelling the adsorption of F$^-$, it is usually taken as a single entity\ngetting adsorbed on the adsorbent. As this is not a proper assumption, a model\nwas developed which takes into account all the speciation reactions that take\nplace during adsorption, and all the species like H$^+$, OH$^-$, Na$^+$,\nCl$^-$, and NO$_3^-$ present in the solution along with F$^-$. As an\nelectrolyte system is involved, the Nernst-Planck equations were used to obtain\nthe flux of each species. Using the model, the equilibrium constants and rate\nconstants for the reactions were obtained. For one initial concentration of\nF$^-$, a reasonable fit was obtained to the batch adsorption data, except at\nshort times. Because of an uncertainty in the amount of impurity present in the\ncommercial adsorbent used, there was a significant discrepancy between\npredictions and data at higher initial concentrations of F$^-$. The present\nmodel can be applied to any charged adsorbent.\n", "  We have measured the K-shell internal conversion coefficient, alpha_K, for\nthe 88.2-keV M4 transition from the 106-day isomer to the ground state in 127Te\nto be 484(6). When compared with Dirac-Fock calculations of alpha_K, this\nresult agrees well with the version of the theory that incorporates the effect\nof the K-shell atomic vacancy and disagrees with the one that does not. As a\nbyproduct of this measurement, we have determined the beta branching from the\nisomer to be 2.14(3)%.\n", "  We present a modification of the method for reconstructing the stellar\nvelocity ellipsoid (SVE) in disc galaxies. Our version does not need any\nparametrization of the velocity dispersion profiles and uses only one\nassumption that the ratio $\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R$ remains constant along the\nprofile or along several pieces of the profile. The method was tested on two\ngalaxies from the sample of other authors and for the first time was applied to\nthree lenticular galaxies NGC~1167, NGC~3245 and NGC~4150 as well as to one Sab\ngalaxy NGC~338. We found that for galaxies with a high inclination ($i\n>55-60^\\circ$) it is difficult or rather impossible to extract the information\nabout SVE while for galaxies at an intermediate inclination the procedure of\nextracting is successful. For NGC~1167 we managed to reconstruct SVE, provided\nthat the value of $\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R$ is piecewise constant. We found\n$\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R=0.7$ for the inner parts of the disc and\n$\\sigma_z/\\sigma_R=0.3$ for the outskirts. We also obtained a rigid constrain\non the value of the radial velocity dispersion $\\sigma_R$ for highly inclined\ngalaxies and tested the result using the asymmetric drift equation, provided\nthat the gas rotation curve is available.\n", "  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is an optical phenomenon which\nallows a drastic modification of the optical properties of an atomic system by\napplying a control field. It has been largely studied in the last decades and\nnowadays we can find a huge number of experimental and theoretical related\nstudies. Recently a similar phenomenon was also shown in quantum dot molecules\n(QDM) , where the control field is replaced by the tunneling rate between\nquantum dots. Our results show that in the EIT regime, the optical properties\nof QDM and the atomic system are identical. However, here we show that in the\nstrong probe field regime, i.e., \"coherent population trapping\" (CPT) regime,\nit appears a strong discrepancy on the optical properties of both systems. We\nshow that the origin of such difference relies on the different decay rates of\nthe excited state of the two systems, implying in a strong difference on their\nhigher order nonlinear susceptibilities. Finally, we investigate the optical\nresponse of atom/QDM strongly coupled to a cavity mode. In particular, the\nQDM-cavity system has the advantage of allowing a better narrowing of the width\nof the dark state resonance in the CPT regime when compared with atom-cavity\nsystem.\n", "  The STAR Collaboration reports on the photoproduction of $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ pairs\nin gold-gold collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 200 GeV/nucleon-pair.\nThese pion pairs are produced when a nearly-real photon emitted by one ion\nscatters from the other ion.\n  We fit the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ invariant mass spectrum with a combination of $\\rho$\nand $\\omega$ resonances and a direct $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ continuum. This is the first\nobservation of the $\\omega$ in ultra-peripheral collisions, and the first\nmeasurement of $\\rho-\\omega$ interference at energies where photoproduction is\ndominated by Pomeron exchange. The $\\omega$ amplitude is consistent with the\nmeasured $\\gamma p\\rightarrow \\omega p$ cross section, a classical Glauber\ncalculation and the $\\omega\\rightarrow\\pi^+\\pi^-$ branching ratio. The $\\omega$\nphase angle is similar to that observed at much lower energies, showing that\nthe $\\rho-\\omega$ phase difference does not depend significantly on photon\nenergy.\n  The $\\rho^0$ differential cross section $d\\sigma/dt$ exhibits a clear\ndiffraction pattern, compatible with scattering from a gold nucleus, with 2\nminima visible. The positions of the diffractive minima agree better with the\npredictions of a quantum Glauber calculation that does not include nuclear\nshadowing than with a calculation that does include shadowing.\n", "  Absorptive corrections, known to suppress proton-neutron transitions with\nlarge fractional momentum $z\\to1$ in pp collisions, become dramatically strong\non a nuclear target, and push the partial cross sections of leading neutron\nproduction to the very periphery of the nucleus. The mechanism of $\\pi$-$a_1$\ninterference, which successfully explains the observed single-spin asymmetry in\npolarized $pp\\to nX$, is extended to collisions of polarized protons with\nnuclei. Corrected for nuclear effects, it explains the observed single-spin\nazimuthal asymmetry of neutrons, produced in inelastic events, where the\nnucleus violently breaks up. The single-spin asymmetry is found to be negative\nand nearly $A$-independent.\n"]}
