A thorough desription of the applied procedure will be given. We apply\nvarious binning techniques to the different data: Bayes blocks, exponential\nbinning and signal-to-noise type of binning. We present a handful of\nlightcurves and some possible applications.\n", "  We look into the quantum phase diagram of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$\nantiferromagnet on the square lattice with degenerate Shastry-Sutherland ground\nstates, for which only a schematic phase diagram is known so far. Many exotic\nphases were proposed in the schematic phase diagram by the use of exact\ndiagonalization on very small system sizes. In our present work, an important\nextension of this antiferromagnet is introduced and investigated in the\nthermodynamic limit using triplon mean-field theory. Remarkably, this\nantiferromagnet shows a stable plaquette spin-gapped phase like the original\nShastry-Sutherland antiferromagnet, although both of these antiferromagnets\ndiffer in the Hamiltonian construction and ground state degeneracy. We propose\na sublattice columnar dimer phase which is stabilized by the second and third\nneighbor antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interactions. There are also\nsome commensurate and incommensurate magnetically ordered phases, and other\nspin-gapped phases which find their places in the quantum phase diagram.\nMean-field results suggest that there is always a level-crossing phase\ntransition between two spin gapped phases, whereas in other situations, either\na level-crossing or a continuous phase transition happens.\n", "  The exact analytical lattice results for the partition function of the free\nneutral scalar field in one spatial dimension in both the configuration and the\nmomentum space were obtained in the framework of the path integral method. The\nsymmetric square matrices of the bilinear forms on the vector space of fields\nin both configuration space and momentum space were found explicitly. The exact\nlattice results for the partition function were generalized to the\nthree-dimensional spatial momentum space and the main thermodynamic quantities\nwere derived both on the lattice and in the continuum limit. The thermodynamic\nproperties and the finite volume corrections to the thermodynamic quantities of\nthe free real scalar field were studied. We found that on the finite lattice\nthe exact lattice results for the free massive neutral scalar field agree with\nthe continuum limit only in the region of small values of temperature and\nvolume. However, at these temperatures and volumes the continuum physical\nquantities for both massive and massless scalar field deviate essentially from\ntheir thermodynamic limit values and recover them only at high temperatures\nor/and large volumes in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We report the first test of isotropy of the Universe in the matter dominated\nepoch using the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest data from the high redshift quasars\n($z>2$) from SDSS-III BOSS-DR9 datasets. Using some specified data cuts, we\nobtain the probability distribution function (PDF) of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\ntransmitted flux and use the statistical moments of the PDF to address the\nisotropy of the Universe. In an isotropic Universe one would expect the\ntransmitted flux to have consistent statistical characteristics in different\nparts of the sky. We trisect the total survey area of 3275 ${\\rm deg}^2$ along\nthe galactic latitude and using quadrant convention. We also make three\nsubdivisions in the data for three different signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR).\nFinally we obtain and compare the statistical moments in the mean redshifts of\n2.3, 2.6 and 2.9. We find, that the moments from all patches agree at all\nredshifts and at all SNRs, within 3$\\sigma$ uncertainties. Since Lyman-$\\alpha$\ntransmitted flux directly maps the neutral hydrogen distribution in the inter\ngalactic medium (IGM), our results indicate, within the limited survey area and\nsensitivity of the data, the distribution of the neutral hydrogen in the\nUniverse is consistent with isotropic distribution. We should mention that we\nreport few deviations from isotropy in the data with low statistical\nsignificance. Increase in survey area and larger amount of data are needed to\nmake any strong conclusion about these deviations.\n", "  Performing analysis, optimization and control using simulations of\nmany-particle systems is computationally demanding when no macroscopic model\nfor the dynamics of the variables of interest is available. In case\nobservations on the macroscopic scale can only be produced via legacy simulator\ncode or live experiments, finding a model for these macroscopic variables is\nchallenging.\n  In this paper, we employ time-lagged embedding theory to construct\nmacroscopic numerical models from output data of a black box, such as a\nsimulator or live experiments. Since the state space variables of the\nconstructed, coarse model are dynamically closed and observable by an\nobservation function, we call these variables closed observables. The approach\nis an online-offline procedure, as model construction from observation data is\nperformed offline and the new model can then be used in an online phase,\nindependent of the original. We illustrate the theoretical findings with\nnumerical models constructed from time series of a two-dimensional ordinary\ndifferential equation system, and from the density evolution of a\ntransport-diffusion system. Applicability is demonstrated in a real-world\nexample, where passengers leave a train and the macroscopic model for the\ndensity flow onto the platform is constructed with our approach. If only the\nmacroscopic variables are of interest, simulation runtimes with the numerical\nmodel are three orders of magnitude lower compared to simulations with the\noriginal fine scale model. We conclude with a brief discussion of possibilities\nof numerical model construction in systematic upscaling, network optimization\nand uncertainty quantification.\n", "  The gravitational coupling of a long-wavelength tidal field with small-scale\ndensity fluctuations leads to anisotropic distortions of the locally measured\nsmall-scale matter correlation function. Since the local correlation function\nis known to be statistically isotropic in the absence of such tidal\ninteractions, the tidal distortions can be used to reconstruct the\nlong-wavelength tidal field and large-scale density field in analogy with the\ncosmic microwave background lensing reconstruction. In this paper we present\nthe theoretical framework of cosmic tidal reconstruction and test the\nreconstruction in numerical simulations. We find that the density field on\nlarge scales can be reconstructed with good accuracy and the cross-correlation\ncoefficient between the reconstructed density field and the original density\nfield is greater than 0.9 on large scales $(k\\lesssim0.1\\ h/\\mathrm{Mpc})$,\nwith the filter scale $\\sim1.25\\ \\mathrm{Mpc}/h$. This is useful in the 21cm\nintensity mapping survey, where the long-wavelength radial modes are lost due\nto a foreground subtraction process.\n", "  We study features in the bispectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation\ncorrelated with the reconstructed primordial power spectrum from the observed\ncosmic microwave background temperature data. We first show how the bispectrum\ncan be completely specified in terms of the power spectrum and its first two\nderivatives, valid for any configuration of interest. Then using a\nmodel-independent reconstruction of the primordial power spectrum from the\nPlanck angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies, we compute the\nbispectrum in different triangular configurations. We find that in the squeezed\nlimit at k ~ 0.06/Mpc and k ~ 0.014/Mpc there are marginal 2sigma deviations\nfrom the standard featureless bispectrum, which meanwhile is consistent with\nthe reconstructed bispectrum in the equilateral configuration.\n", "  We investigate gain in microwave photonic cavities coupled to voltage-biased\ndouble quantum dot systems with an arbitrary strong dot-lead coupling and with\na Holstein-like light-matter interaction, by adapting the diagrammatic Keldysh\nnonequilibrium Green's function approach. We compute out-of-equilibrium\nproperties of the cavity : its transmission, phase response, mean photon\nnumber, power spectrum, and spectral function. We show that by the careful\nengineering of these hybrid light-matter systems, one can achieve a significant\namplification of the optical signal with the voltage-biased electronic system\nserving as a gain medium. We also study the steady state current across the\ndevice, identifying elastic and inelastic tunnelling processes which involve\nthe cavity mode. Our results show how recent advances in quantum electronics\ncan be exploited to build hybrid light-matter systems that behave as\nsingle-atom amplifiers and photon source devices. The diagrammatic Keldysh\napproach is primarily discussed for a cavity-coupled double quantum dot\narchitecture, but it is generalizable to other hybrid light-matter systems.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments on the generation of coherent light in\nengineered hybrid quantum systems, we investigate gain in a microwave photonic\ncavity coupled to quantum dot structures, and develop concrete directions for\nachieving a giant amplification in photon transmission. We propose two\narchitectures for scaling up the electronic gain medium: (i) $N$ double quantum\ndot systems (N-DQD), (ii) $M$ quantum dots arranged in series akin to a quantum\ncascade laser setup. In both setups, the fermionic reservoirs are voltage\nbiased, and the quantum dots are coupled to a single-mode cavity. Optical\namplification is explained based on a sum rule for the transmission function,\nand it is determined by an intricate competition between two different\nprocesses: charge density response in the gain medium, and cavity losses to\ninput and output ports. The same design principle is also responsible for the\ncorresponding giant amplification in other photonic observables, mean photon\nnumber and emission spectrum, thereby realizing a quantum device that behaves\nas a giant microwave amplifier.\n", "  Military and civilian applications of nuclear energy have left a significant\namount of spent nuclear fuel over the past 70 years. Currently, in many\ncountries world wide, the use of nuclear energy is on the rise. Therefore, the\nmanagement of highly radioactive nuclear waste is a pressing issue. In this\nletter, we explore antineutrino detectors as a tool for monitoring and\nsafeguarding nuclear waste material. We compute the flux and spectrum of\nantineutrinos emitted by spent nuclear fuel elements as a function of time, and\nwe illustrate the usefulness of antineutrino detectors in several benchmark\nscenarios. In particular, we demonstrate how a measurement of the antineutrino\nflux can help to re-verify the contents of a dry storage cask in case the\nmonitoring chain by conventional means gets disrupted. We then comment on the\nusefulness of antineutrino detectors at long-term storage facilities such as\nYucca mountain. Finally, we put forward antineutrino detection as a tool in\nlocating underground \"hot spots\" in contaminated areas such as the Hanford site\nin Washington state.\n", "  We investigate the magnetic properties of a repulsive fermionic SU($3$)\nHubbard model on the Lieb lattice from weak to strong interaction by means of\nthe mean-field approximation. To validate the method we employed, we first\ndiscuss the SU($2$) Hubbard model at the mean-field level, and find that our\nresults are consistent with known rigorous theorems. We then extend the\ncalculation to the case of SU($3$) symmetry. We find that, at $4/9$ filling,\nthe SU$(3)$ symmetry spontaneously breaks into the SU$(2)\\times$U$(1)$ symmetry\nin the ground state, leading to a staggered ferromagnetic state for any\nrepulsive $U$ at zero temperature. We then investigate the stability of the\nferromagnetic state by relaxing the filling away from $4/9$, and conclude that\nthe ferromagnetic state is sensitive but robust to fillings, as it can persist\nwithin a certain filling regime. We also apply the mean-field approximation to\nfinite temperature to calculate the critical temperature and the critical\nentropy of the ferromagnetic state. As the resulting critical entropy per\nparticle is significantly greater than that can be realized in experiments, we\nexpect some quasi-long-range-ordered features of such a ferromagnetic state can\nbe realized and observed with fermionic alkaline-earth-metal(-like) atoms\nloaded into optical lattices.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to investigate system identification for\nsingle-input-single-output general (active or passive) quantum linear systems.\nFor a given input we address the following questions: (1) Which parameters can\nbe identified by measuring the output? (2) How can we construct a system\nrealization from sufficient input-output data? We show that for time-dependent\ninputs, the systems which cannot be distinguished are related by symplectic\ntransformations acting on the space of system modes. This complements a\nprevious result for passive linear systems. In the regime of stationary quantum\nnoise input, the output is completely determined by the power spectrum. We\ndefine the notion of global minimality for a given power spectrum, and\ncharacterize globally minimal systems as those with a fully mixed stationary\nstate. We show that in the case of systems with a cascade realization, the\npower spectrum completely fixes the transfer function, so the system can be\nidentified up to a symplectic transformation. We give a method for constructing\na globally minimal subsystem direct from the power spectrum. Restricting to\npassive systems the analysis simplifies so that identifiability may be\ncompletely understood from the eigenvalues of a particular system matrix.\n", "  In this article, we study the strong interaction of the vertexes $\\Sigma_bNB$\nand $\\Sigma_c ND$ using the three-point QCD sum rules under two different dirac\nstructures. Considering the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to\ndimension $5$ in the operation product expansion, the form factors of these\nvertexes are calculated. Then, we fit the form factors into analytical\nfunctions and extrapolate them into time-like regions, which giving the\ncoupling constant. Our analysis indicates that the coupling constant for these\ntwo vertexes are $G_{\\Sigma_bNB}=0.43\\pm0.01GeV^{-1}$ and\n$G_{\\Sigma_cND}=3.76\\pm0.05GeV^{-1}$.\n", "  We analyze a coupled anonymized dataset collecting the mobile phone\ncommunication and bank transactions history of a large number of individuals.\nAfter mapping the social structure and introducing indicators of socioeconomic\nstatus, demographic features, and purchasing habits of individuals we show that\ntypical consumption patterns are strongly correlated with identified\nsocioeconomic classes leading to patterns of stratification in the social\nstructure. In addition we measure correlations between merchant categories and\nintroduce a correlation network, which emerges with a meaningful community\nstructure. We detect multivariate relations between merchant categories and\nshow correlations in purchasing habits of individuals. Our work provides novel\nand detailed insight into the relations between social and consuming behaviour\nwith potential applications in recommendation system design.\n", "  We test the consistency between Planck temperature and polarization power\nspectra and the concordance model of $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmology\n($\\Lambda$CDM) within the framework of Crossing statistics. We find that Planck\nTT best fit $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum is completely consistent with EE power\nspectrum data while EE best fit $\\Lambda$CDM power spectrum is not consistent\nwith TT data. However, this does not point to any systematic or model-data\ndiscrepancy since in the Planck EE data, uncertainties are much larger compared\nto the TT data. We also investigate the possibility of any deviation from\n$\\Lambda$CDM model analyzing the Planck 2015 data. Results from TT, TE and EE\ndata analysis indicate that no deviation is required beyond the flexibility of\nthe concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. Our analysis thus rules out any strong\nevidence for beyond the concordance model in the Planck spectra data. We also\nreport a mild amplitude difference comparing temperature and polarization data,\nwhere temperature data seems to have slightly lower amplitude than expected\n(consistently at all multiples), as we assume both temperature and polarization\ndata are realizations of the same underlying cosmology.\n", "  One of the most promising frameworks for understanding the anomalies of cold\nand supercooled water postulates the existence of two competing,\ninterconvertible local structures. If the non-ideality in the Gibbs energy of\nmixing overcomes the ideal entropy of mixing of these two structures, a\nliquid-liquid phase transition, terminated at a liquid-liquid critical point,\nis predicted. Various versions of the \"two-structure equation of state\" (TSEOS)\nbased on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental\ndata for metastable, deeply supercooled water and simulations of molecular\nwater models. However, existing TSEOSs were not designed to describe the\nnegative pressure region and do not account for the stability limit of the\nliquid state with respect to the vapor. While experimental data on supercooled\nwater at negative pressures may shed additional light on the source of the\nanomalies of water, such data are very limited. To fill this gap, we have\nanalyzed simulation results for TIP4P/2005, one of the most accurate classical\nwater models available. We have used recently published simulation data, and\nperformed additional simulations, over a broad range of positive and negative\npressures, from ambient temperature to deeply supercooled conditions. We show\nthat, by explicitly incorporating the liquid-vapor spinodal into a TSEOS, we\nare able to match the simulation data for TIP4P/2005 with remarkable accuracy.\nIn particular, this equation of state quantitatively reproduces the lines of\nextrema in density, isothermal compressibility, and isobaric heat capacity.\nContrary to an explanation of the thermodynamic anomalies of water based on a\n\"retracing spinodal\", the liquid-vapor spinodal in the present TSEOS continues\nmonotonically to lower pressures upon cooling, influencing but not giving rise\nto density extrema and other thermodynamic anomalies.\n", "  We present a direct approach to nonparametrically reconstruct the linear\ndensity field from an observed nonlinear map. We solve for the unique\ndisplacement potential consistent with the nonlinear density and positive\ndefinite coordinate transformation using a multigrid algorithm. We show that we\nrecover the linear initial conditions up to the nonlinear scale\n($r_{\\delta_r\\delta_L}>0.5$ for $k\\lesssim1\\ h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$) with minimal\ncomputational cost. This reconstruction approach generalizes the linear\ndisplacement theory to fully nonlinear fields, potentially substantially\nexpanding the baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift space distortions\ninformation content of dense large scale structure surveys, including for\nexample SDSS main sample and 21cm intensity mapping initiatives.\n", "  We study the statistics of thermal energy transfer in the nonequilibrium\n(two-bath) spin-boson model. This quantum many-body impurity system serves as a\ncanonical model for quantum energy transport. Our method makes use of the\nMajorana fermion representation for the spin operators, in combination with the\nKeldysh nonequilibrium Green's function approach. We derive an analytical\nexpression for the cumulant generating function of the model in the steady\nstate limit, and show that it satisfies the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation\nsymmetry. We obtain analytical expressions for the heat current and its noise,\nvalid beyond the sequential and the co-tunnelling regimes. Our results satisfy\nthe quantum mechanical bound for heat current in interacting nanojunctions.\nResults are compared with other approximate theories, as well as with a\nnon-interacting model, a fully harmonic thermal junction.\n", "  Classical autoencoders are neural networks that can learn efficient low\ndimensional representations of data in higher dimensional space. The task of an\nautoencoder is, given an input $x$, is to map $x$ to a lower dimensional point\n$y$ such that $x$ can likely be recovered from $y$. The structure of the\nunderlying autoencoder network can be chosen to represent the data on a smaller\ndimension, effectively compressing the input. Inspired by this idea, we\nintroduce the model of a quantum autoencoder to perform similar tasks on\nquantum data. The quantum autoencoder is trained to compress a particular\ndataset of quantum states, where a classical compression algorithm cannot be\nemployed. The parameters of the quantum autoencoder are trained using classical\noptimization algorithms. We show an example of a simple programmable circuit\nthat can be trained as an efficient autoencoder. We apply our model in the\ncontext of quantum simulation to compress ground states of the Hubbard model\nand molecular Hamiltonians.\n", "  For any given channel $W$ with classical inputs and possibly quantum outputs,\na dual classical-input channel $W^\\perp$ can be defined by embedding the\noriginal into a channel $\\mathcal N$ with quantum inputs and outputs. Here we\ngive new uncertainty relations for a general class of entropies that lead to\nvery close relationships between the original channel and its dual. Moreover,\nwe show that channel duality can be combined with duality of linear codes,\nwhereupon the uncertainty relations imply that the performance of a given code\nover a given channel is entirely characterized by the performance of the dual\ncode on the dual channel. This has several applications. In the context of\npolar codes, it implies that the rates of polarization to ideal and useless\nchannels must be identical. Duality also relates the tasks of channel coding\nand privacy amplification, implying that the finite blocklength performance of\nextractors and codes is precisely linked, and that optimal rate extractors can\nbe transformed into capacity-achieving codes, and vice versa. Finally, duality\nalso extends to the EXIT function of any channel and code. Here it implies that\nfor any channel family, if the EXIT function for a fixed code has a sharp\ntransition, then it must be such that the rate of the code equals the capacity\nat the transition. This may give a different route to proving a code family\nachieves capacity by establishing sharp EXIT function transitions.\n", "  The electrical conductance of molecular junctions may strongly depend on the\ntemperature, and weakly on molecular length, under two distinct mechanisms:\nphase-coherent resonant conduction, with charges proceeding via delocalized\nmolecular orbitals, and incoherent thermally-assisted multi-step hopping. While\nin the case of coherent conduction the temperature dependence arises from the\nbroadening of the Fermi distribution in the metal electrodes, in the latter\ncase it corresponds to electron-vibration interaction effects on the junction.\nWith the objective to distill the thermally-activated hopping component, thus\nexpose intrinsic electron-vibration interaction phenomena on the junction, we\nsuggest the design of molecular junctions with \"spacers\", extended anchoring\ngroups that act to filter out phase-coherent resonant electrons. Specifically,\nwe study the electrical conductance of fixed-gap and variable-gap junctions\nthat include a tunneling block, with spacers at the boundaries. Using numerical\nsimulations and analytical considerations, we demonstrate that in our design,\nresonant conduction is suppressed. As a result, the electrical conductance is\ndominated by two (rather than three) mechanisms: superexchange (deep\ntunneling), and multi-step thermally-induced hopping. We further exemplify our\nanalysis on DNA junctions with an A:T block serving as a tunneling barrier.\nHere, we show that the electrical conductance is insensitive to the number of\nG:C base-pairs at the boundaries. This indicates that the tunneling-to-hopping\ncrossover revealed in such sequences truly corresponds to the properties of the\nA:T barrier.\n", "  We calculate the collective excitations of a dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate\nin the regime where it self-binds into droplets stabilized by quantum\nfluctuations. We show that the filament-shaped droplets act as a\nquasi-one-dimensional waveguide along which low angular momentum phonons\npropagate. The evaporation (unbinding) threshold occurring as the atom number\n$N$ is reduced to the critical value $N_c$ is associated with a monopole-like\nexcitation going soft as $\\epsilon_0\\sim(N-N_c)^{1/4}$. Considering the system\nin the presence of a trapping potential, we quantify the crossover from a\ntrap-bound condensate to a self-bound droplet.\n", "  We study the interacting, symmetrically coupled single impurity Anderson\nmodel. By employing the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, we establish\nan exact relationship between the steady-state charge current flowing through\nthe impurity (dot) and its occupation. We argue that the steady state\ncurrent-occupation relation can be used to assess the consistency of simulation\ntechniques, and identify spurious transport phenomena. We test this relation in\ntwo different model variants: First, we study the Anderson-Holstein model in\nthe strong electron-vibration coupling limit using the polaronic quantum master\nequation method. We find that the current-occupation relation is violated\nnumerically in standard calculations, with simulations bringing up incorrect\ntransport effects. Using a numerical procedure, we resolve the problem\nefficiently. Second, we simulate the Anderson model with electron-electron\ninteraction on the dot using a deterministic numerically-exact time-evolution\nscheme. Here, we observe that the current-occupation relation is satisfied in\nthe steady-state limit---even before results converge to the exact limit.\n", "  Dark matter particles interacting via the exchange of very light spin-0\nmediators can have large self-interaction rates and obtain their relic\nabundance from thermal freeze-out. At the same time, these models face strong\nbounds from direct and indirect probes of dark matter as well as a number of\nconstraints on the properties of the mediator. We investigate whether these\nconstraints can be consistent with having observable effects from dark matter\nself-interactions in astrophysical systems. For the case of a mediator with\npurely scalar couplings we point out the highly relevant impact of\nlow-threshold direct detection experiments like CRESST-II, which essentially\nrule out the simplest realization of this model. These constraints can be\nsignificantly relaxed if the mediator has CP-violating couplings, but then the\nmodel faces strong constraints from CMB measurements, which can only be avoided\nin special regions of parameter space.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger equation with potential $-g/r^2$ exhibits a limit cycle,\ndescribed in the literature in a broad range of contexts using various\nregularizations of the singularity at $r=0$. Instead, we use the\nrenormalization group transformation based on Gaussian elimination, from the\nHamiltonian eigenvalue problem, of high momentum modes above a finite, floating\ncutoff scale. The procedure identifies a richer structure than the one we found\nin the literature. Namely, it directly yields an equation that determines the\nrenormalized Hamiltonians as functions of the floating cutoff: solutions to\nthis equation exhibit, in addition to the limit-cycle, also the\nasymptotic-freedom, triviality, and fixed-point behaviors, the latter in\nvicinity of infinitely many separate pairs of fixed points in different partial\nwaves for different values of $g$.\n", "  We investigate how to attack Shor's quantum algorithm for factorization with\nan entangling probe. We show that an attacker can steal an exact solution of\nShor's algorithm outside an institute where the quantum computer is installed\nif he replaces its initialized quantum register with entangled qubits, namely\nthe entangling probe. He can apply arbitrary local operations to his own probe.\nMoreover, we assume that there is an unauthorized person who helps the attacker\nto commit a crime inside the institute. He tells garbage data obtained from\nmeasurements of the quantum register to the attacker secretly behind a\nlegitimate user's back. If the attacker succeeds in cracking Shor's algorithm,\nthe legitimate user obtains a random answer and does not notice the attacker's\nillegal acts. We discuss how to detect the attacker. Finally we estimate a\nprobability that the quantum algorithm inevitably makes an error, of which the\nattacker can take advantage.\n", "  We present next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations including QCD and\nelectroweak (EW) corrections for $2\\ell2\\nu$ diboson signatures with two\nopposite-charge leptons and two neutrinos. Specifically, we study the processes\n$pp\\to e^+ \\mu^- \\nu_{e}\\bar\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $pp\\to e^+ e^-\\nu\\bar\\nu$, including\nall relevant off-shell diboson channels, $W^+W^-$, $ZZ$, $\\gamma Z$, as well as\nnon-resonant contributions. Photon-induced processes are computed at NLO EW,\nand we discuss subtle differences related to the definition and the\nrenormalisation of the coupling $\\alpha$ for processes with initial- and\nfinal-state photons. All calculations are performed within the automated\nMunich/Sherpa+OpenLoops frameworks, and we provide numerical predictions for\nthe LHC at 13 TeV. The behaviour of the corrections is investigated with\nemphasis on the high-energy regime, where NLO EW effects can amount to tens of\npercent due to large Sudakov logarithms. The interplay between $WW$ and $ZZ$\ncontributions to the same-flavour channel, $pp\\to e^+ e^-\\nu\\bar\\nu$, is\ndiscussed in detail, and a quantitative analysis of photon-induced\ncontributions is presented. Finally, we consider approximations that account\nfor all sources of large logarithms, at high and low energy, by combining\nvirtual EW corrections with a YFS soft-photon resummation or a QED parton\nshower.\n", "  It is predicted that quantum computers will dramatically outperform their\nconventional counterparts. However, large-scale universal quantum computers are\nyet to be built. Boson sampling is a rudimentary quantum algorithm tailored to\nthe platform of photons in linear optics, which has sparked interest as a rapid\nway to demonstrate this quantum supremacy. Photon statistics are governed by\nintractable matrix functions known as permanents, which suggests that sampling\nfrom the distribution obtained by injecting photons into a linear-optical\nnetwork could be solved more quickly by a photonic experiment than by a\nclassical computer. The contrast between the apparently awesome challenge faced\nby any classical sampling algorithm and the apparently near-term experimental\nresources required for a large boson sampling experiment has raised\nexpectations that quantum supremacy by boson sampling is on the horizon. Here\nwe present classical boson sampling algorithms and theoretical analyses of\nprospects for scaling boson sampling experiments, showing that near-term\nquantum supremacy via boson sampling is unlikely. While the largest boson\nsampling experiments reported so far are with 5 photons, our classical\nalgorithm, based on Metropolised independence sampling (MIS), allowed the boson\nsampling problem to be solved for 30 photons with standard computing hardware.\nWe argue that the impact of experimental photon losses means that demonstrating\nquantum supremacy by boson sampling would require a step change in technology.\n", "  The complete nonperturbative expressions for the high-temperature expansion\nof the one-loop effective action induced by the charged scalar and the charged\nDirac particles both at zero and finite temperatures are derived with account\nfor possible nontrivial boundary conditions. The background electromagnetic\nfield is assumed to be stationary and such that the corresponding Klein-Gordon\noperator or the Dirac Hamiltonian are self-adjoint. The contributions of\nparticles and antiparticles are obtained separately. The explicit expressions\nfor the $C$-symmetric and the non $C$-symmetric vacuum energies of the Dirac\nfermions are derived. The leading corrections to the high-temperature expansion\ndue to the nontrivial boundary conditions are explicitly found. The corrections\nto the logarithmic divergence of the effective action that come from the\nboundary conditions are derived. The high-temperature expansion of the naive\none-loop effective action induced by charged fermions turns out to be divergent\nin the limit of a zero fermion mass.\n", "  In this article, we analyze the strong vertexes $\\Sigma_{c}^{*}ND$ and\n$\\Sigma_{b}^{*}NB$ using the three-point QCD sum rules under the Dirac\nstructure of $q\\!\\!\\!/p\\!\\!\\!/\\gamma_{\\mu}$. We perform our analysis by\nconsidering the contributions of the perturbative part and the condensate terms\nof $<\\overline{q}q>$ and $<\\frac{\\alpha_{s}}{\\pi}GG>$. After the form factors\nare calculated, they are then fitted into analytical functions which are used\nto get the strong coupling constants for these two vertexes. The final results\nare $g_{\\Sigma_{c}^{*}ND}=7.19^{+8.49}_{-3.11}\\pm1.76$ and\n$g_{\\Sigma_{b}^{*}NB}=10.54^{+15.59}_{-5.23}\\pm1.82$.\n", "  Non-parametric reconstruction methods, such as Gaussian process (GP)\nregression, provide a model-independent way of estimating an underlying\nfunction and its uncertainty from noisy data. We demonstrate how\nGP-reconstruction can be used as a consistency test between a given data set\nand a specific model by looking for structures in the residuals of the data\nwith respect to the model's best-fit. Applying this formalism to the Planck\ntemperature and polarisation power spectrum measurements, we test their global\nconsistency with the predictions of the base $\\Lambda$CDM model. Our results do\nnot show any serious inconsistencies, lending further support to the\ninterpretation of the base $\\Lambda$CDM model as cosmology's gold standard.\n", "  This chapter draws upon astronomical observations and modeling to constrain\nthe prevalence of communicative civilizations in the galaxy. We discuss the\ndependence of the Drake equation parameters on the spectral type of the host\nstar and the time since the galaxy formed, which allow us to examine\ntrajectories for the emergence of communicative civilizations over the history\nof the galaxy. We suggest that the maximum lifetime of communicative\ncivilizations depends on the spectral type of the host star, which implies that\nF- and G-dwarf stars are the best places to search for signs of technological\nintelligence today.\n", "  We present a general quantum kinetic theory of low-field magnetotransport in\nweakly disordered crystals that accounts fully for the interplay between\nelectric-field induced interband coherence, Bloch-state scattering, and an\nexternal magnetic field. The quantum kinetic equation we derive for the\nBloch-state density matrix naturally incorporates the momentum-space Berry\nphase effects whose influence on Bloch-state wavepacket dynamics is normally\nincorporated into transport theory in an ad hoc manner. The Berry phase\ncorrection to the momentum-space density of states in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field implied by semiclassical wavepacket dynamics is\ncaptured by our theory as an intrinsic density-matrix response to a magnetic\nfield. We propose a simple and general procedure for expanding the linear\nresponse of the Bloch-state density matrix to an electric field in powers of\nmagnetic field. As an illustration, we apply our theory to magnetotransport in\nWeyl semimetals. We show that the chiral anomaly (positive magnetoconductivity\nquadratic in magnetic field) that appears when separate Fermi surface pockets\nsurround distinct Weyl points survives only when intervalley scattering is very\nweak compared to intravalley scattering.\n", "  The sky distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been intensively studied\nby various groups for more than two decades. Most of these studies test the\nisotropy of GRBs based on their sky number density distribution. In this work\nwe propose an approach to test the isotropy of the Universe through inspecting\nthe isotropy of the properties of GRBs such as their duration, fluences and\npeak fluxes at various energy bands and different time scales. We apply this\nmethod on the {\\em Fermi} / Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) data sample\ncontaining 1591 GRBs. The most noticeable feature we found is near the Galactic\ncoordinates $l\\approx 30^\\circ$, $b\\approx 15^\\circ$ and radius $r\\approx\n20^\\circ-40^\\circ$. The inferred probability for the occurrence of such an\nanisotropic signal (in a random isotropic sample) is derived to be less than a\npercent in some of the tests while the other tests give results consistent with\nisotropy. These are based on the comparison of the results from the real data\nwith the randomly shuffled data samples. Considering large number of statistics\nwe used in this work (which some of them are correlated to each other) we can\nanticipate that the detected feature could be result of statistical\nfluctuations. Moreover, we noticed a considerably low number of GRBs in this\nparticular patch which might be due to some instrumentation or observational\neffects that can consequently affect our statistics through some systematics.\nFurther investigation is highly desirable in order clarify about this result,\ne.g. utilizing a larger future {\\em Fermi} / GBM data sample as well as data\nsamples of other GRB missions and also looking for possible systematics.\n", "  The Bousso's D-bound entropy for the various possible black hole solutions on\na 4-dimensional brane is checked. It is found that the D-bound entropy here is\napparently different from that of obtained for the 4-dimensional black hole\nsolutions. This difference is interpreted as the extra loss of information,\nassociated to the extra dimension, when an extra-dimensional black hole is\nmoved outward the observer's cosmological horizon. Also, it is discussed that\nN-bound entropy is hold for the possible solutions here. Finally, by adopting\nthe recent Bohr-like approach to black hole quantum physics for the excited\nblack holes, the obtained results are written also in terms of the black hole\nexcited states.\n", "  The theory of phase control of coherence, entanglement and quantum steering\nis developed for an optomechanical system composed of a single mode cavity\ncontaining a partially transmitting dielectric membrane and driven by short\nlaser pulses. The closed loop in the coupling creates interfering channels\nwhich depend on the relative phase of the coupling strengths of the field modes\nto the mechanical mode. We show several interesting phase dependent effects\nsuch as reversible population transfer from one field mode to the other,\ncreation of collective modes, and induced coherence without induced emission.\nThese effects result from perfect mutual coherence between the field modes\nwhich is preserved even if one of the modes is not populated. Depending on the\nphase, the field modes can act on the mechanical mode collectively or\nindividually resulting, respectively, in tripartite or bipartite entanglement.\nIn addition, we examine the phase sensitivity of quantum steering of the\nmechanical mode by the field modes is investigated. Deterministic phase\ntransfer of the steering from bipartite to collective is predicted and optimum\nsteering corresponding to perfect EPR state can be achieved. These different\ntypes of quantum steering can be distinguished experimentally by measuring the\ncoincidence rate between two detectors adjusted to collect photons of the\noutput cavity modes. In particular, we find that the minima of the interference\npattern of the coincidence rate signal the bipartite steering, while the maxima\nsignal the collective steering.\n", "  Self-interacting dark matter may have striking astrophysical signatures, such\nas observable offsets between galaxies and dark matter in merging galaxy\nclusters. Numerical N-body simulations used to predict such observables\ntypically treat the galaxies as collisionless test particles, a questionable\nassumption given that each galaxy is embedded in its own dark matter halo. To\nenable a more accurate treatment we develop an effective description of small\ndark matter haloes taking into account the two major effects due to dark matter\nself-scatterings: deceleration and evaporation. We point out that\nself-scatterings can have a sizeable impact on the trajectories of galaxies,\ndiminishing the separation between galaxies and dark matter in merging\nclusters. This effect depends sensitively on the underlying particle physics,\nin particular the angular dependence of the self-scattering cross section, and\ncannot be predicted from the momentum transfer cross section alone.\n", "  Data correction is probably the least favourite activity amongst users\nexperimenting with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS): if it is not done\nsufficiently well, this may become evident during the data analysis stage,\nnecessitating the repetition of the data corrections from scratch. A\nrecommended, comprehensive sequence of elementary data correction steps is\npresented here to alleviate the difficulties associated with data correction.\nWhen applied in the proposed order, the resulting data will provide a high\ndegree of accuracy for both solid samples and dispersions. The solution here\ncan be applied without modification to any pinhole-collimated instruments with\nphoton-counting, direct detection area detectors.\n", "  We describe in detail the analysis procedure used to derive the first limits\nfrom the Haloscope at Yale Sensitive to Axion CDM (HAYSTAC), a microwave cavity\nsearch for cold dark matter (CDM) axions with masses above $20\\ \\mu\\text{eV}$.\nWe have introduced several significant innovations to the axion search analysis\npioneered by the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX), including optimal\nfiltering of the individual power spectra that constitute the axion search\ndataset and a consistent maximum likelihood procedure for combining and\nrebinning these spectra. These innovations enable us to obtain the axion-photon\ncoupling $|g_\\gamma|$ excluded at any desired confidence level directly from\nthe statistics of the combined data.\n", "  We investigated the scaling and topology of engineered urban drainage\nnetworks (UDNs) in two cities, and further examined UDN evolution over decades.\nUDN scaling was analyzed using two power-law characteristics widely employed\nfor river networks: (1) Hack's law of length ($L$)-area ($A$) scaling [$L\n\\propto A^{h}$], and (2) exceedance probability distribution of upstream\ncontributing area $(\\delta)$ [$P(A\\geq \\delta) \\sim a \\delta^{-\\epsilon}$]. For\nthe smallest UDNs ($<2 \\>\\text{km}^2$), length-area scales linearly ($h\\sim\n1$), but power-law scaling emerges as the UDNs grow. While $P(A\\geq \\delta)$\nplots for river networks are abruptly truncated, those for UDNs display\nexponential tempering [$P(A\\geq \\delta) \\>\\text{=}\\> a\n\\delta^{-\\epsilon}\\exp(-c\\delta)$]. The tempering parameter $c$ decreases as\nthe UDNs grow, implying that the distribution evolves in time to resemble those\nfor river networks. However, the power-law exponent $\\epsilon$ for large UDNs\ntends to be slightly larger than the range reported for river networks.\nDifferences in generative processes and engineering design constraints\ncontribute to observed differences in the evolution of UDNs and river networks,\nincluding subnet heterogeneity and non-random branching.\n", "  We investigate the impact of displaced heavy quark matching scales in a\nglobal fit. The heavy quark matching scale $\\mu_{m}$ determines at which energy\nscale $\\mu$ the QCD theory transitions from $N_{F}$ to $N_{F}+1$ in the\nVariable Flavor Number Scheme (VFNS) for the evolution of the Parton\nDistribution Functions (PDFs) and strong coupling $\\alpha_S(\\mu)$. We study the\nvariation of the matching scales, and their impact on a global PDF fit of the\ncombined HERA data. As the choice of the matching scale $\\mu_{m}$ effectively\nis a choice of scheme, this represents a theoretical uncertainty; ideally, we\nwould like to see minimal dependence on this parameter. For the transition\nacross the charm quark (from $N_{F}=3$ to $4$), we find a large $\\mu_m=\\mu_{c}$\ndependence of the global fit $\\chi^2$ at NLO, but this is significantly reduced\nat NNLO. For the transition across the bottom quark (from $N_{F}=4$ to $5$), we\nhave a reduced $\\mu_{m}=\\mu_b$ dependence of the $\\chi^2$ at both NLO and NNLO\nas compared to the charm. This feature is now implemented in xFitter 2.0.0, an\nopen source QCD fit framework.\n", "  We argue that if ultrahigh-energy (E > 10^10 GeV) cosmic rays are heavy\nnuclei (as indicated by existing data), then the pointing of cosmic rays to\ntheir nearest extragalactic sources is expected for 10^10.6 < E/GeV < 10^11.\nThis is because for a nucleus of charge Ze and baryon number A, the bending of\nthe cosmic ray decreases as Z/E with rising energy, so that pointing to nearby\nsources becomes possible at highest energies. In addition, the maximum energy\nof acceleration capability of the sources grows linearly in Z, while the energy\nloss per distance traveled decreases with increasing A. Each of these two\npoints tend to favor heavy nuclei at the highest energies. The traditional\nbi-dimensional analyses, which simultaneously reproduce Auger data on the\nspectrum and nuclear composition, may not be capable of incorporating the\nrelative importance of these phenomena. In this paper we propose a\nmulti-dimensional reconstruction of the individual emission spectra (in E,\ndirection, and cross-correlation with nearby putative sources) to study the\nhypothesis that primaries are heavy nuclei subject to GZK photo-disintegration,\nand to determine the nature of the extragalactic sources. More specifically, we\npropose to combine information on nuclear composition and arrival direction to\nassociate a potential clustering of events with a 3-dimensional position in the\nsky. Actually, both the source distance and maximum emission energy can be\nobtained through a multi-parameter likelihood analysis to accommodate the\nobserved nuclear composition of each individual event in the cluster. We show\nthat nucleus-emitting-sources exhibit a cepa stratis structure on Earth which\ncould be pealed off by future space-missions, such as POEMMA. We also show that\nmetal-rich starburst galaxies are highly-plausible candidate sources, and we\nuse them as an explicit example of our proposed multi-dimensional analysis.\n", "  Since the enlightening proofs of quantum contextuality first established by\nKochen and Specker, and also by Bell, various simplified proofs have been\nconstructed to exclude the non-contextual hidden variable theory of our nature\nat the microscopic scale. The conflict between the non-contextual hidden\nvariable theory and quantum mechanics is commonly revealed by Kochen-Specker\n(KS) sets of yes-no tests, represented by projectors (or rays), via either\nlogical contradictions or noncontextuality inequalities in a\nstate-(in)dependent manner. Here we first propose a systematic and programmable\nconstruction of a state-independent proof from a given set of nonspecific rays\nin $\\mC^3$ according to their Gram matrix. This approach brings us a greater\nconvenience in the experimental arrangements. Besides, our proofs in $\\mC^3$\ncan also be generalized to any higher dimensional systems by a recursive\nmethod.\n", "  The uncertainty relation is a distinguishing feature of quantum theory,\ncharacterizing the incompatibility of noncommuting observables in the\npreparation of quantum states. Recently, many uncertainty relations were\nproposed with improved lower bounds and were deemed capable of incorporating\nmultiple observables. Here we report an experimental verification of seven\nuncertainty relations of this type with single-photon measurements. The\nresults, while confirming these uncertainty relations, show as well the\nrelative stringency of various uncertainty lower bounds.\n", "  We revisit the calculation of height correlations in the two-dimensional\nAbelian sandpile model by taking advantage of a technique developed recently by\nKenyon and Wilson. The formalism requires to equip the usual graph Laplacian,\nubiquitous in the context of cycle-rooted spanning forests, with a complex\nconnection. In the case at hand, the connection is constant and localized along\na semi-infinite defect line (zipper). In the appropriate limit of a trivial\nconnection, it allows one to count spanning forests whose components contain\nprescribed sites, which are of direct relevance for height correlations in the\nsandpile model. Using this technique, we first rederive known 1- and 2-site\nlattice correlators on the plane and upper half-plane, more efficiently than\nwhat has been done so far. We also compute explicitly the (new) next-to-leading\norder in the distances ($r^{-4}$ for 1-site on the upper half-plane, $r^{-6}$\nfor 2-site on the plane). We extend these results by computing new correlators\ninvolving one arbitrary height and a few heights 1 on the plane and upper\nhalf-plane, for the open and closed boundary conditions. We examine our lattice\nresults from the conformal point of view, and confirm the full consistency with\nthe specific features currently conjectured to be present in the associated\nlogarithmic conformal field theory.\n", "  Brownian motion of water molecules provides an essential length scale, the\ndiffusion length, commensurate with cell dimensions in biological tissues.\nMeasuring the diffusion coefficient as a function of diffusion time makes in\nvivo diffusion MRI uniquely sensitive to the cellular features about three\norders of magnitude below imaging resolution. However, there is a longstanding\ndebate, regarding which contribution --- intra- or extra-cellular --- is more\nrelevant in the overall time-dependence of the diffusion metrics. Here we\nresolve this debate in the human brain white matter. By varying not just the\ndiffusion time, but also the gradient pulse duration of a standard diffusion\npulse sequence, we identify a functional form of the measured time-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient transverse to white matter tracts in 5 healthy\nvolunteers. This specific functional form is shown to originate from the\nextra-axonal space, and provides estimates of the fiber packing correlation\nlength for axons in a bundle. Our results offer a metric for the outer axonal\ndiameter, a promising candidate marker for demyelination in neurodegenerative\ndiseases. From the methodological perspective, our analysis demonstrates how\ncompeting models, which describe different physics yet interpolate standard\nmeasurements equally well, can be distinguished based on their prediction for\nan independent \"orthogonal\" measurement.\n", "  In mechanical systems, Maxwell-Betti reciprocity means that the displacement\nat point B in response to a force at point A is the same as the displacement at\npoint A in response to the same force applied at point B. Because the notion of\nreciprocity is general, fundamental, and is operant for other physical systems\nlike electromagnetics, acoustics, and optics, there is significant interest in\nunderstanding systems that are not reciprocal, or exhibit non-reciprocity.\nHowever, most studies of non-reciprocity have occurred in bulk-scale structures\nfor dynamic problems involving time reversal symmetry. As a result, little is\nknown about the mechanisms governing static non-reciprocal responses,\nparticularly in atomically-thin two-dimensional materials like graphene. Here,\nwe use classical atomistic simulations to demonstrate that out of plane\nripples, which are intrinsic to graphene, enable significant, multiple orders\nof magnitude enhancements in the statically non-reciprocal response of graphene\nmetamaterials. Specifically, we find that a striking interplay between the\nripples and the stress fields that are induced in the metamaterials due to\ntheir geometry impact the displacements that are transmitted by the\nmetamaterial, thus leading to a significantly enhanced static non-reciprocal\nresponse. This study thus demonstrates the potential of two-dimensional\nmechanical metamaterials for symmetry-breaking applications.\n", "  Inspired by mirror symmetry, we investigate some differential geometric\naspects of the space of Bridgeland stability conditions on a Calabi-Yau\ntriangulated category. The aim is to develop theory of Weil-Petersson geometry\non the stringy K\\\"ahler moduli space. A few basic examples are studied. In\nparticular, we identify our Weil-Petersson metric with the Bergman metric on a\nSiegel modular variety in the case of the self-product of an elliptic curve.\n", "  Ensemble density functional theory is a promising method for the efficient\nand accurate calculation of excitations of quantum systems, at least if useful\nfunctionals can be developed to broaden its domain of practical applicability.\nHere, we introduce a guaranteed single-valued 'Hartree-exchange' ensemble\ndensity functional, $E_{Hx}[n]$, in terms of the right derivative of the\nuniversal ensemble density functional with respect to the coupling constant at\nvanishing interaction. We show that $E_{Hx}[n]$ is straightforwardly\nexpressible using block eigenvalues of a simple matrix [equation (14)].\nSpecialized expressions for $E_{Hx}[n]$ from the literature, including those\ninvolving superpositions of Slater determinants, can now be regarded as\noriginating from the unifying picture presented here. We thus establish a clear\nand practical description for Hartree-exchange in ensemble systems.\n", "  We calculate various quantities that characterize the dissimilarity of\nreduced density matrices for a short interval of length $\\ell$ in a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) large central charge conformal field theory (CFT). These\nquantities include the R\\'enyi entropy, entanglement entropy, relative entropy,\nJensen-Shannon divergence, as well as the Schatten 2-norm and 4-norm. We adopt\nthe method of operator product expansion of twist operators, and calculate the\nshort interval expansion of these quantities up to order of $\\ell^9$ for the\ncontributions from the vacuum conformal family. The formal forms of these\ndissimilarity measures and the derived Fisher information metric from\ncontributions of general operators are also given. As an application of the\nresults, we use these dissimilarity measures to compare the excited and thermal\nstates, and examine the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) by showing\nhow they behave in high temperature limit. This would help to understand how\nETH in 2D CFT can be defined more precisely. We discuss the possibility that\nall the dissimilarity measures considered here vanish when comparing the\nreduced density matrices of an excited state and a generalized Gibbs ensemble\nthermal state. We also discuss ETH for a microcanonical ensemble thermal state\nin a 2D large central charge CFT, and find that it is approximately satisfied\nfor a small subsystem and violated for a large subsystem.\n", "  We report the magneto-transport properties and electronic structures of\nBaZnBi$_2$. BaZnBi$_2$ is a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) material with metallic\nbehavior. The transverse magnetoresistance (MR) depends on magnetic field\nlinearly and exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation at low temperature\nand high field. The observed linear MR may originate from the disorder in\nsamples or the edge conductivity in compensated two-component systems. The\nfirst-principles calculations reveal the absence of stable gapless Dirac\nfermion. Combining with the trivial Berry phase extracted from SdH oscillation,\nBaZnBi$_2$ is suggested to be a topologically trivial semimetal. Nearly\ncompensated electron-like Fermi surfaces (FSs) and hole-like FSs coexist in\nBaZnBi$_2$.\n", "  We study the dynamics of an initially degenerate homogeneous Bose gas after\nan interaction quench to the unitary regime at a magnetic Feshbach resonance.\nAs the cloud decays and heats, it exhibits a crossover from degenerate- to\nthermal-gas behaviour, both of which are characterised by universal scaling\nlaws linking the particle-loss rate to the total atom number $N$. In the\ndegenerate and thermal regimes the per-particle loss rate is $\\propto N^{2/3}$\nand $N^{26/9}$, respectively. The crossover occurs at a universal kinetic\nenergy per particle and at a universal time after the quench, in units of\nenergy and time set by the gas density. By slowly sweeping the magnetic field\naway from the resonance and creating a mixture of atoms and molecules, we also\nmap out the dynamics of correlations in the unitary gas, which display a\nuniversal temporal scaling with the gas density, and reach a steady state while\nthe gas is still degenerate.\n", "  We study the dependence of the normalized moments of the net-proton\nmultiplicity distributions on the definition of centrality in relativistic\nnuclear collisions at a beam energy of $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}= 7.7$ GeV. Using\nthe UrQMD model as event generator we find that the centrality definition has a\nlarge effect on the extracted cumulant ratios. Furthermore we find that the\nfinite efficiency for the determination of the centrality introduces an\nadditional systematic uncertainty. Finally, we quantitatively investigate the\neffects of event-pile up and other possible spurious effects which may change\nthe measured proton number. We find that pile-up alone is not sufficient to\ndescribe the data and show that a random double counting of events, adding\nsignificantly to the measured proton number, affects mainly the higher order\ncumulants in most central collisions.\n", "  We investigate the phenomenology of QCD axions and axionlike particles in a\nscenario with two eras of inflation. In particular, we describe the possible\nsolutions for the QCD axion field equation after the second inflation and\nreheating. We calculate the dilution numerically for QCD axions and give an\nanalytic approximation for axionlike particles. While it has been realised\nbefore that such a scenario can dilute the axion energy density and open up the\nparameter space for the axion decay constant $f_A$, we find that even a small\nincrease in the relative QCD axion energy density is possible.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological gravitino problem in inflation models in which\nthe inflaton potential is constructed from K\\\"ahler potential rather than\nsuperpotential: a representative model is $\\overline{\\text{D}3}$-induced\ngeometric inflation. A critical ingredient in this type of models is the\ncoupling of the inflaton and Polonyi (supersymmetry-breaking) field in the\nK\\\"ahler potential, which is needed to build the inflaton potential. We point\nout the same coupling let the inflaton dominantly decay into a pair of\ninflatino and gravitino causing the gravitino problem. We propose some possible\nsolutions to this problem.\n", "  We consider a fundamental string in a bubbling geometry of arbitrary genus\ndual to a half-supersymmetric Wilson loop in a general large representation\n$\\mathbf{R}$ of the $SU(N)$ gauge group in ${\\cal N}=4$ Supersymmetric\nYang-Mills. We demonstrate, under some mild conditions, that the minimum value\nof the string classical action for a bubbling geometry of arbitrary genus\nprecisely matches the correlator of a Wilson loop in the fundamental\nrepresentation and one in a general large representation. We work out the case\nin which the large representation is given by a rectangular Young Tableau,\ncorresponding to a genus one bubbling geometry, explicitly. We also present\nexplicit results in the field theory for a correlator of two Wilson loops: a\nlarge one in an arbitrary representation and a \"small\" one in the fundamental,\ntotally symmetric or totally antisymmetric representation.\n", "  The topological properties of electronic edge states in time-periodically\ndriven spatially-periodic corrugated zigzag graphene nanoribbons are studied.\nAn effective one-dimensional Hamiltonian is used to describe the electronic\nproperties of graphene and the time-dependence is studied within the Floquet\nformalism. Then the quasienergy spectrum of the evolution operator is obtained\nusing analytical and numeric calculations, both in excellent agreement.\nDepending on the external parameters of the time-driving, two different kinds\n(type I and type II) of touching band points are found, which have a Dirac-like\nnature at both zero and $\\pm\\pi$ quasienergy. These touching band points are\nable to host topologically protected edge states for a finite size system. The\ntopological nature of such edge states was confirmed by an explicit evaluation\nof the Berry phase in the neighborhood of type I touching band points and by\nobtaining the winding number of the effective Hamiltonian for type II touching\nband points. Additionally, the topological phase diagram in terms of the\ndriving parameters of the system was built.\n", "  We report a precise measurement of the J/$\\psi$ elliptic flow in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the\nLHC. The J/$\\psi$ mesons are reconstructed at mid-rapidity ($|y| < 0.9$) in the\ndielectron decay channel and at forward rapidity ($2.5<y<4.0$) in the dimuon\nchannel, both down to zero transverse momentum. At forward rapidity, the\nelliptic flow $v_2$ of the J/$\\psi$ is studied as a function of transverse\nmomentum and centrality. A positive $v_2$ is observed in the transverse\nmomentum range $2 < p_{\\rm T} < 8$ GeV/$c$ in the three centrality classes\nstudied and confirms with higher statistics our earlier results at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV in semi-central collisions. At mid-rapidity, the\nJ/$\\psi$ $v_2$ is investigated as a function of transverse momentum in\nsemi-central collisions and found to be in agreement with the measurements at\nforward rapidity. These results are compared to transport model calculations.\nThe comparison supports the idea that at low $p_{\\rm T}$ the elliptic flow of\nthe J/$\\psi$ originates from the thermalization of charm quarks in the\ndeconfined medium, but suggests that additional mechanisms might be missing in\nthe models.\n", "  We increase the isolation of a superconducting double dot from its\nenvironment by galvanically isolating it from any electrodes. We probe it using\nhigh frequency reflectometry techniques, find 2e-periodic behaviour, and\ncharacterise the energy structure of its charge states. By modelling the\nresponse of the device, we determine the quasiparticle poisoning rate to be\nsignificantly worse than that of a unisolated double dot, and conclude that\nquasiparticle exchange between the dot and the leads is an important relaxation\nmechanism.\n", "  Encouraged by recent discovery of $\\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ baryon, we investigate two\nbody non-leptonic weak decays of doubly charmed, $\\Xi_{cc}$, baryons. We\ncalculate the branching ratios for CKM-favored and suppressed modes in\nfactorization and pole model approach. We give the first estimates of\nnonfactorizable W-exchange contributions using pole model. We find that\nW-exchange contributions to $\\Xi_{cc}$ decays being sizable can not be ignored.\n", "  A thought-provoking proposal by Tsakmakidis et al. [Science 356, 1260 (2017)]\nsuggests that nonreciprocal optics can break a time-bandwidth limit to passive\nresonators. Here I quantize their resonator model and show that quantum\nmechanics does impose a limit, or requires extra noise to be added in the same\nfashion as amplified spontaneous emission in an active resonator. I also use\nthermodynamics to argue that extra dissipation or noise must be present in\ntheir proposed device.\n", "  The intermetallic semiconductor FeGa$_{3}$ acquires itinerant ferromagnetism\nupon electron doping by a partial replacement of Ga with Ge. We studied the\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) of high-quality single crystals of\nFeGa$_{3-x}$Ge$_x$ for $x$ from 0 up to 0.162 where ferromagnetic order is\nobserved. For $x = 0$ we observed a well-defined ESR signal, indicating the\npresence of pre-formed magnetic moments in the semiconducting phase. Upon Ge\ndoping the occurrence of itinerant magnetism clearly affects the ESR properties\nbelow $\\approx 40$~K whereas at higher temperatures an ESR signal as seen in\nFeGa$_{3}$ prevails independent on the Ge-content. The present results show\nthat the ESR of FeGa$_{3-x}$Ge$_x$ is an appropriate and direct tool to\ninvestigate the evolution of 3d-based itinerant magnetism.\n", "  The exciting development of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy in the\ncorrelation of LIGO and VIRGO detection of GW signals makes possible to expect\nregistration of effects of not only Binary Black Hole (BH) coalescence, but\nalso Binary Neutron Star (NS) merging accompanied by electromagnetic (GRB)\nsignal. Here we consider the possibility that a Neutron Star (NS), merging in a\nNS-NS or NS-BH system might be (soon) observed in correlation with any\nLIGO-VIRGO Gravitational Waves detection. We analyze as an example the recent\ncase of the short GRB 170817A observed by Fermi and Integral. The associated\nOptical transient OT source in NGC4993 imply a rare near source, a consequent\naveraged large rate of such events (almost) compatible with expected NS NS\nmerging rate. However the expected beamed GRB (or Short GRB) may be mostly\naligned to a different direction than our. Therefore even soft GRB photons,\nmore spread than hard ones, might be hardly able to shower to us. Nevertheless\na prompt spiraling electron turbine jet in largest magnetic fields, at the base\nof the NS-NS collapse, might shine by its tangential synchrotron radiation in\nspread way with its skimming photons shining in large open disk. The consequent\nsolid angle for such soft disk gamma radiation may be large enough to be\nnevertheless often observed.\n", "  In 2016, UNSCEAR published an attachment to its Fukushima 2015 White Paper,\nentitled \"Development of isodose maps representing annual external exposure in\nJapan as a function of time,\" in which the committee presented annual\nadditional 1 mSv effective dose ab extra isodose lines for 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 50\nyears after the accident, based on the soil deposition data of radionuclides\nwithin 100 km from FDNPP. Meanwhile, the median of the ratio, c, between the\nexternal effective dose rates and the ambient dose equivalent rates at 1 m\nabove the ground obtained by the airborne monitoring has been established to be\nc~0.15. We here compare the UNSCEAR predictions with respect to estimates based\non the airborne monitoring. Although both methods and data used in the two\napproaches are di erent, the resultant contours show relatively good agreement.\nHowever, to improve the accuracy of long-term annual effective isodose lines,\nfeedback from continuous measurements such as airborne monitoring is important.\n", "  We perform a study of the achievable field enhancement of plasmonic cascade\nnanolenses in the quantum and classical regimes, and explore the limits\nenforced at larger sizes by retardation and at smaller sizes by nonlocality and\nother quantum effects. We compare the near field response of a sodium nanolens\nwithin a local and nonlocal formalism and find that the increased electron-\nsurface scattering decreases the field enhancements by over an order of\nmagnitude. The large parameter space is explored, within the local\napproximation, for a number of plasmonic metals as well as the polar dielectric\nSiC. Using localised surface phonon polaritons, which can be excited in polar\ndielectrics, is an effective strategy for overcoming retardation due to the\nlower energy phonon frequency. Finally, we compare the nanolens against the\nmore usual dimer configuration, we find that the superior geometry depends\ncrucially on the material used, with noble metal nanolenses unlikely to offer\nbetter performance to equivalent dimers. Interestingly SiC nanolenses can offer\na larger maximum field enhancement compared to the corresponding dimer\nconfiguration, suggesting that future endeavours in constructing a nanolens\nshould be based on polar dielectrics.\n", "  We present a non-perturbative, divergence-free series expansion of Green's\nfunctions using effective operators. The method is especially suited for\ncomputing correlators of complex operators as a series of correlation functions\nof simpler forms. We apply the method to study low-energy excitations in\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) in doped one- and two-dimensional\nsingle-band Hubbard models. The RIXS operator is expanded into polynomials of\nspin, density, and current operators weighted by fundamental x-ray spectral\nfunctions. These operators couple to different polarization channels resulting\nin simple selection rules. The incident photon energy dependent coefficients\nhelp to pinpoint main RIXS contributions from different degrees of freedom. We\nshow in particular that, with parameters pertaining to cuprate superconductors,\nlocal spin excitation dominates the RIXS spectral weight over a wide doping\nrange in the cross-polarization channel.\n", "  In Stokes flow, the stream function associated with the velocity of the fluid\nsatisfies the biharmonic equation. The detailed behavior of solutions to the\nbiharmonic equation on regions with corners has been historically difficult to\ncharacterize. The problem was first examined by Lord Rayleigh in 1920; in 1973,\nthe existence of infinite oscillations in the domain Green's function was\nproven in the case of the right angle by S.~Osher. In this paper, we observe\nthat, when the biharmonic equation is formulated as a boundary integral\nequation, the solutions are representable by rapidly convergent series of the\nform $\\sum_{j} ( c_{j} t^{\\mu_{j}} \\sin{(\\beta_{j} \\log{(t)})} + d_{j}\nt^{\\mu_{j}} \\cos{(\\beta_{j} \\log{(t)})} )$, where $t$ is the distance from the\ncorner and the parameters $\\mu_{j},\\beta_{j}$ are real, and are determined via\nan explicit formula depending on the angle at the corner. In addition to being\nanalytically perspicuous, these representations lend themselves to the\nconstruction of highly accurate and efficient numerical discretizations,\nsignificantly reducing the number of degrees of freedom required for the\nsolution of the corresponding integral equations. The results are illustrated\nby several numerical examples.\n", "  In this work the scalar free Klein-Gordon field coupled to the quantum\nmechanical gravity equation (QMGE), that takes into account the quantum\nproperty of matter, is quantized. The model has been developed at the first\norder in the metric tensor with a self-consistent analytical dependence of the\nenergy impulse tensor by the quantum field. The quantum behavior, due to the\nquantum potential energy, in the gravity equation (GE) has been investigated by\nstudying the energy-impulse tensor density generated the quantum field. The\noutputs of the theory show that the vacuum energy density of the zero point is\neffective for the cosmological constant only in the volume of space where the\nmass is localized in particles or in high gravity bodies, leading to a\ncosmological effect on the motion of the galaxies that is compatible with the\nastronomical observations. The paper shows that the energy-impulse tensor\ndensity makes the QMGE, in the quasi-Euclidean limit, physically independent by\nthe level of the zero-point energy density of the vacuum, and possibly\ncompatible with the renormalization techniques of the quantum field theory\n(QFT). Finally, the coupling of the QGE to the quantum Dirac field has been\npreliminary outlined.\n", "  Kinetic theory (KT) has been successfully used to model rapid granular flows\nin which particle interactions are frictionless and near elastic. However, it\nfails when particle interactions become frictional and inelastic. For example,\nthe KT is not able to accurately predict the free cooling process of a vibrated\ngranular medium that consists of inelastic frictional particles under\nmicrogravity. The main reason that the classical KT fails to model these flows\nis due to its inability to account for the particle surface friction and its\ninelastic behavior, which are the two most important factors that need be\nconsidered in modeling collisional granular flows. In this study, we have\nmodified the KT model that is able to incorporate these two factors. The\ninelasticity of a particle is considered by establishing a velocity-dependent\nexpression for the restitution coefficient based on many experimental studies\nfound in the literature, and the particle friction effect is included by using\na tangential restitution coefficient that is related to the particle friction\ncoefficient. Theoretical predictions of the free cooling process by the\nclassical KT and the improved KT are compared with the experimental results\nfrom a study conducted on an airplane undergoing parabolic flights without the\ninfluence of gravity [Y. Grasselli, G. Bossis, and G. Goutallier, EPL\n(Europhysics Letters) 86, 60007 (2009)]. Our results show that both the\nvelocity- dependent restitution coefficient and the particle surface friction\nare important in predicting the free cooling process of granular flows; the\nmodified KT model that integrates these two factors is able to improve the\nsimulation results and led to a better agreement with the experimental results.\n", "  The complete theory of electrical conductivity of graphene at arbitrary\ntemperature is developed with taken into account mass-gap parameter and\nchemical potential. Both the in-plane and out-of-plane conductivities of\ngraphene are expressed via the components of the polarization tensor in\n(2+1)-dimensional space-time analytically continued to the real frequency axis.\nSimple analytic expressions for both the real and imaginary parts of the\nconductivity of graphene are obtained at zero and nonzero temperature. They\ndemonstrate an interesting interplay depending on the values of mass gap and\nchemical potential. In the local limit, several results obtained earlier using\nvarious approximate and phenomenological approaches are reproduced, refined and\ngeneralized. The numerical computations of both the real and imaginary parts of\nthe conductivity of graphene are performed to illustrate the obtained results.\nThe analytic expressions for the conductivity of graphene obtained in this\npaper can serve as a guide in the comparison between different theoretical\napproaches and between experiment and theory.\n", "  Spectroscopic observations are extremely important for determining the\ncomposition, structure, and surface gravity of exoplanetary atmospheres. High\nresolution spectroscopy of the planet itself has only been demonstrated a\nhandful of times. By using advanced high contrast imagers, it is possible to\nconduct high resolution spectroscopy on imageable exoplanets, after the star\nlight is first suppressed with an advanced coronagraph. Because the planet is\nspatially separated in the focal plane, a single mode fiber could be used to\ncollect the light from the planet alone, reducing the photon noise by orders of\nmagnitude. In addition, speckle control applied to the location where an\nexoplanet is known to exist, can be used to preferentially reject the stellar\nflux from the fiber further.\n  In this paper we will present the plans for conducting high resolution\nspectroscopic studies of this nature with the combination of SCExAO and IRD in\nthe H-band on the Subaru Telescope. This technique will be critical to the\ncharacterization of terrestrial planets on ELTs and future space missions.\n", "  A key objective in DNA-based material science is understanding and precisely\ncontrolling the mechanical properties of DNA hydrogels. We perform\nmicrorheology measurements using diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS) to\ninvestigate the viscoelastic behavior of a hydrogel made of Y-shaped DNA\nnano-stars over a wide range of frequencies and temperatures. Results show a\nclear liquid-to-equilibrium-gel transition as the temperature cycles up and\ndown across the melting-temperature region for which the Y-DNA bind to each\nother. These first measurements reveal the crossover of the elastic\nG'({\\omega}) and loss modulus G'({\\omega}) when the DNA-hydrogel formed at low\ntemperatures is heated to a fluid phase of DNA nano-stars well above the melt\ntemperature Tm. We show that the crossover relates to the life-time of the\nDNA-bond and also that percolation coincides with the systems' Tm. The approach\ndemonstrated here can be easily extended to more complicated DNA hydrogel\nsystems and provides guidance for the future design of such transient,\nsemi-flexible networks that can be adapted to the application of molecular\nsensing and controlled release.\n", "  In this document we report on the recent development of a C++ interface to\nthe FORTRAN-based evolution program QCDNUM. A short description of the\ninterface is given with a few basic examples of its usage.\n", "  Since its launch in 2008, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected\nover 200 -ray pulsars above 100 MeV. This population of pulsars is\ncharacterised by a rich diversity of light curve morphologies. Researchers have\nbeen using both the radio and -ray light curves to constrain the inclination\nand observer angles for each of these pulsars. At first, this was done using a\nby-eye technique and later via statistical approaches. We have also developed\ntwo novel statistical approaches that place the radio and -ray data on equal\nfooting despite their disparate relative flux errors. We chose eleven pulsars\nfrom the Second Fermi Pulsar Catalog, both old and young, and applied these new\ntechniques as well as the by-eye technique to constrain their geometric\nparameters using standard pulsar models. We present first results on our\ncomparison of the best-fit parameters yielded by each of the aforementioned\ntechniques. This will assist us in determining the utility of our new\nstatistical approaches, and gauge the overlap of the best-fit parameters (plus\nerrors) from each of the different methods. Such a statistical fitting approach\nwill provide the means for further pulsar magnetospheric model development\nusing light curve data.\n", "  We analyze the phase structure of $SU(\\infty)$ gauge theory at finite\ntemperature using matrix models. Our basic assumption is that the effective\npotential is dominated by double-trace terms for the Polyakov loops. As a\nfunction of the temperature, a background field for the Polyakov loop, and a\nquartic coupling, it exhibits a universal structure: in the large portion of\nthe parameter space, there is a continuous phase transition analogous to the\nthird-order phase transition of Gross, Witten and Wadia, but the order of phase\ntransition can be higher than third. We show that different confining\npotentials give rise to drastically different behavior of the eigenvalue\ndensity and the free energy. Therefore lattice simulations at large $N$ could\nprobe the order of phase transition and test our results.\n", "  Recent results have shown the presence and importance of oxygen chemistry\nduring the growth of aromatic compounds, leading to the formation of oxygenated\nstructures that have been identified in various environments. Since the\nformation of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) bridge the formation of\ngas-phase species with particle inception, in this work we report a detailed\nanalysis of the effects of molecular characteristics on physical growth of PAC\nvia dimerization. We have included oxygen content, mass, type of bonds (rigid\nversus rotatable), and shape as main properties of the molecules and studied\ntheir effect on the propensity of these structures to form homo-molecular and\nhetero-molecular dimers. Using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics techniques,\nwe have computed the free energy of dimerization in the temperature range\n$500-1680$~K. Initial structures used in this study were obtained from\nexperimental data. The results show that although the effects of shape,\npresence of oxygen, mass, and internal bonds are tightly intertwined, and their\nrelative importance changes with temperature. In general, mass and the presence\nof rotatable bonds are the best indicators. The results provide knowledge on\nthe inception step and the role that particle characteristics play during\ninception. In addition, our study highlights the fact that current models that\nuse stabilomers as monomers for physical aggregation are overestimating the\nimportance of this process during particle nucleation.\n", "  The work presents a comprehensive methodology to determine the Shielding\nEffectiveness (SE) of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)/polymer\nnanocomposites. Here, an algorithm based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) was\nemployed to determine the electrical conductivity ({\\sigma}) of these\nnanocomposites as a function of SWCNT concentration. Then, these {\\sigma}\nvalues were used to compute the SE values as a function of frequency and\nconcentration. Specifically, a pseudo three-dimensional (3D) percolation model\nwas developed to study the effects of random connectivity of SWCNTs to one\nanother on the {\\sigma} values of the nanocomposites. Both intrinsic and\ntunneling resistances were taken into account. The consequences of the presence\nof both well-exfoliated and aggregated SWCNTs with varying lengths distributed\ninhomogeneously on {\\sigma} and SE values were investigated.\n", "  The LHC heavy ion data for W/Z production can provide new incisive\ninformation on the PDFs. This data is sensitive to the heavier quark flavors\n(strange and charm) in a high energy kinematic region; this can facilitate the\ndetermination of PDFs in the small x region where previous data was limited. At\npresent, the flavor separation of the proton PDFs is dependent on DIS data from\nnuclear targets. Therefore, improved nuclear corrections can also yield\nenhanced flavor determination of both the proton and nuclear PDFs.\n", "  We report a novel optical waveguide design of a hollow step index fiber\nmodified with a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). We show an excitation of\nhighly confined waveguide mode in the proposed fiber near the wavelength where\npermittivity of ITO approaches zero. Due to the high field confinement within\nthin ITO shell inside the fiber, the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) mode can be\ncharacterized by a peak in modal loss of the hybrid waveguide. Our results show\nthat such in-fiber excitation of ENZ mode is due to the coupling of the guided\ncore mode to the thin-film ENZ mode. We also show that the phase matching\nwavelength, where the coupling takes place, varies depending on the refractive\nindex of the constituents inside the central bore of the fiber. These ENZ\nnanostructured optical fibers have many potential applications, for example, in\nENZ nonlinear and magneto-optics, as in-fiber wavelength-dependent filters, and\nas subwavelength fluid channel for optical and bio-photonic sensing.\n", "  Spin waves in ferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet (YIG) films with ultralow\nmagnetic damping are relevant for magnon-based spintronics and low-power\nwave-like computing. The excitation frequency of spin waves in YIG is rather\nlow in weak external magnetic fields because of its small saturation\nmagnetization, which limits the potential of YIG films for high-frequency\napplications. Here, we demonstrate how exchange-coupling to a CoFeB film\nenables efficient excitation of high-frequency perpendicular standing spin\nwaves (PSSWs) in nanometer-thick (80 nm and 295 nm) YIG films using uniform\nmicrowave magnetic fields. In the 295-nm-thick YIG film, we measure intense\nPSSW modes up to 10th order. Strong hybridization between the PSSW modes and\nthe ferromagnetic resonance mode of CoFeB leads to characteristic anti-crossing\nbehavior in broadband spin-wave spectra. A dynamic exchange torque at the\nYIG/CoFeB interface explains the excitation of PSSWs. The localized torque\noriginates from exchange coupling between two dissimilar magnetization\nprecessions in the YIG and CoFeB layers. As a consequence, spin waves are\nemitted from the YIG/CoFeB interface and PSSWs form when their wave vector\nmatches the perpendicular confinement condition. PSSWs are not excited when the\nexchange coupling between YIG and CoFeB is suppressed by a Ta spacer layer.\nMicromagnetic simulations confirm the exchange-torque mechanism.\n", "  Inelastic surface growth associated with continuous creation of\nincompatibility on the boundary of an evolving body is behind a variety of\nnatural and technological processes, including embryonic development and 3D\nprinting. In this paper we extend the recently proposed stress-space-centered\ntheory of surface growth (PRL 119, 048001, 2017) by shifting the focus towards\ngrowth induced strains. To illustrate the new development we present several\nanalytically tractable examples.\n", "  Dark matter axions and other highly degenerate bosonic fluids are commonly\ndescribed by classical field equations. In a recent paper \\cite{BECprop} we\ncalculated the duration of classicality of homogeneous condensates with\nattractive contact interactions and of self-gravitating homogeneous condensates\nin critical expansion. According to their classical equations of motion, such\ncondensates persist forever. In their quantum evolution parametric resonance\ncauses quanta to jump in pairs out of the condensate into all modes with\nwavevector less than some critical value. We estimated in each case the time\nscale over which the condensate is depleted and after which a classical\ndescription is invalid.\n", "  We show that the antisymmetric spinor tensor representation of spin-0\nrelativistic quantum mechanics provides a conserved current with positive\ndefinite timelike component, interpretable as probability density. The\nconstruction runs in complete analogy to the spin-1/2 case, and provides an\nanalogously natural one-particle Hilbert space description for spin 0. Except\nfor the free particle, the obtained formulation proves to be inequivalent to\nthe one based on the Klein--Gordon equation. The second quantized version may\nlead to new field theoretical interaction terms for zero-spin particles.\n", "  We study the origin of the non-thermal profiles observed in filamentary\nstructures in galactic molecular clouds by means of numerical dynamical\nsimulations. We find that such profiles are intrinsic features of the end\nproducts of dissipationless collapse in cylindrical symmetry. Moreover, for\nsufficiently cold initial conditions, we obtain end states characterized by\nmarkedly anticorrelated radial density and temperature profiles. Gravitational,\ndissipationless dynamics alone is thus sufficient to reproduce, at least\nqualitatively, many of the properties of the observed non-thermal structures.\n", "  We couple photoluminescent semiconducting 7-atom wide armchair edge graphene\nnanoribbons to plasmonic nanoantenna arrays and demonstrate an enhancement of\nthe photoluminescence and Raman scattering intensity of the nanoribbons by more\nthan one order of magnitude. The increase in signal allows us to study Raman\nspectra with high signal-to-noise ratio. Using plasmonic enhancement we are\nable to detect the off-resonant Raman signals from the modified radial\nbreathing-like mode (RBLM) due to physisorbed molecules, the 3rd order RBLM,\nand C-H vibrations. We find excellent agreement between data and simulations\ndescribing the spectral dependence of the enhancement and modifications of the\npolarization anisotropy. The strong field gradients in the optical near-field\nfurther allow us to probe the subwavelength coherence properties of the phonon\nmodes in the nanoribbons. We theoretically model this considering a finite\ncoherence length along the GNR direction. Our results allow estimating the\ncoherence length in graphene nanoribbons.\n", "  The MESSENGER mission sought to discover what physical processes determined\nMercury's high metal to silicate ratio. Instead, the mission has discovered\nmultiple anomalous characteristics about our innermost planet. The lack of FeO\nand the reduced oxidation state of Mercury's crust and mantle are more extreme\nthan nearly all other known materials in the solar system. In contrast,\nmoderately volatile elements are present in abundances comparable to the other\nterrestrial planets. No single process during Mercury's formation is able to\nexplain all of these observations. Here, we review the current ideas for the\norigin of Mercury's unique features. Gaps in understanding the innermost\nregions of the solar nebula limit testing different hypotheses. Even so, all\nproposed models are incomplete and need further development in order to unravel\nMercury's remaining secrets.\n", "  Graph clustering (or community detection) has long drawn enormous attention\nfrom the research on web mining and information networks. Recent literature on\nthis topic has reached a consensus that node contents and link structures\nshould be integrated for reliable graph clustering, especially in an\nunsupervised setting. However, existing methods based on shallow models often\nsuffer from content noise and sparsity. In this work, we propose to utilize\ndeep embedding for graph clustering, motivated by the well-recognized power of\nneural networks in learning intrinsic content representations. Upon that, we\ncapture the dynamic nature of networks through the principle of influence\npropagation and calculate the dynamic network embedding. Network clusters are\nthen detected based on the stable state of such an embedding. Unlike most\nexisting embedding methods that are task-agnostic, we simultaneously solve for\nthe underlying node representations and the optimal clustering assignments in\nan end-to-end manner. To provide more insight, we theoretically analyze our\ninterpretation of network clusters and find its underlying connections with two\nwidely applied approaches for network modeling. Extensive experimental results\non six real-world datasets including both social networks and citation networks\ndemonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the state-of-the-art.\n", "  Core-collapse supernova explosions are driven by a central engine that\nconverts a small fraction of the gravitational binding energy released during\ncore collapse to outgoing kinetic energy. The suspected mode for this energy\nconversion is the neutrino mechanism, where a fraction of the neutrinos emitted\nfrom the newly formed protoneutron star are absorbed by and heat the matter\nbehind the supernova shock. Accurate neutrino-matter interaction terms are\ncrucial for simulating these explosions. In this proceedings for IAUS 331, SN\n1987A, 30 years later, we explore several corrections to the neutrino-nucleon\nscattering opacity and demonstrate the effect on the dynamics of the\ncore-collapse supernova central engine via two dimensional\nneutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Our results reveal that the\nexplosion properties are sensitive to corrections to the neutral-current\nscattering cross section at the 10-20% level, but only for densities at or\nabove $\\sim 10^{12}$ g cm$^{-3}$\n", "  We discuss the detailed balance condition for hybrid Monte Carlo method\n", "  Magnonics is gaining momentum as an emerging technology for information\nprocessing. The wave character and Joule heating-free propagation of spin-waves\nhold promises for highly efficient analog computing platforms, based on\nintegrated magnonic circuits. Miniaturization is a key issue but, so far, only\nfew examples of manipulation of spin-waves in nanostructures have been\ndemonstrated, due to the difficulty of tailoring the nanoscopic magnetic\nproperties with conventional fabrication techniques. In this Letter, we\ndemonstrate an unprecedented degree of control in the manipulation of\nspin-waves at the nanoscale by using patterned reconfigurable spin-textures. By\nspace and time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy imaging, we\nprovide direct evidence for the channeling and steering of propagating\nspin-waves in arbitrarily shaped nanomagnonic waveguides based on patterned\ndomain walls, with no need for external magnetic fields or currents.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate a prototypic nanomagnonic circuit based on two\nconverging waveguides, allowing for the tunable spatial superposition and\ninteraction of confined spin-waves modes.\n", "  The centrality dependence of pseudorapidity density of charged particles ($\ndN_{ch}/d\\eta $) in $Cu+Cu$ ($Au+Au$) collisions at RHIC energy of $\n\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=22.4$ , $62.4 $ and $200$ ($19.6$, $62.4$ and $200$) GeV,\nis investigated within an improved HIJING code. The standard HIJING model is\nenhanced by a prescription for collective nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) interactions\nand more modern parton distribution functions. The collective $NN$-interactions\nare used to induce both cascade and nucleon shadowing effects. We find\ncollective cascade broadens the pseudorapidity distributions in the tails (at $\n|\\eta|> y_{\\rm beam} $) above $25-30\\%$ collision centrality to be consistent\nwith the $ dN_{ch}/d\\eta $ data at $ \\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=19.6$, $22.4$, $62.4\n$ GeV. The overall contribution of nucleon shadowing is shown to depress the\nwhole shape of $ dN_{ch}/d\\eta$ in the primary interaction region (at $ |\\eta|<\ny_{\\rm beam} $) for semiperipheral ($ 20-25 $ \\%) and peripheral ($\\ge\n35-40$\\%) $Cu+Cu$ ($Au+Au$) interactions at $ \\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=200$ GeV, in\naccordance with the PHOBOS data.\n", "  The problem of the strong momentum dependence of the $\\rho\\pi\\pi$-vertex in\nthe extended Nambu -- Jona-Lasinio model is solved by an appropriate choice of\nfields for spin-1 particles. A corresponding phenomenological Lagrangian is\nderived. As straightforward applications, the decay widths of $\\rho\\to\\pi\\pi$,\nand $a_1\\to\\rho\\pi$ transitions are calculated and compared with known\nempirical data and previous theoretical estimates.\n", "  We derive generalized charge energy rate equations for organic solids and\nbiomolecular aggregates, even when these are dynamically disordered. These\nequations suggest that the transport in such cases rely on both drift and\ndiffusion phenomena. The presence of disorder and field effects makes the\nequations nonlinear and together with cooperativity, these enhance the charge\nand energy transport. The generalized drift diffusion expression connects the\nadiabatic band and nonadiabatic hopping transport mechanisms, well suited for\nany complex organic semiconductors or assemblies of bio molecular systems. Here\nwe have proposed donor-acceptor (DA) reaction state model, which examines the\nprobability of charge transfer and the rate between two distinct transition\nstate identities. From our analytical equations, we suggest that charge and\nenergy transport property in DA states can be tuned by only a single parameter,\ni.e., the chemical potential. Importantly, we find the non-equilibrium assisted\ndrift-diffusion transport at non- steady state regime in 2D and 3D\nsemiconducting devices. The numerical results clearly support our unified\nanalytical equations, which goes beyond Einstein's diffusion law even in quasi-\nequilibrium cases.\n", "  Can we hear the sound of our brain? Is there any technique which can enable\nus to hear the neuro-electrical impulses originating from the different lobes\nof brain? The answer to all these questions is YES. In this paper we present a\nnovel method with which we can sonify the Electroencephalogram (EEG) data\nrecorded in rest state as well as under the influence of a simplest acoustical\nstimuli - a tanpura drone. The tanpura drone has a very simple yet very complex\nacoustic features, which is generally used for creation of an ambiance during a\nmusical performance. Hence, for this pilot project we chose to study the\ncorrelation between a simple acoustic stimuli (tanpura drone) and sonified EEG\ndata. Till date, there have been no study which deals with the direct\ncorrelation between a bio-signal and its acoustic counterpart and how that\ncorrelation varies under the influence of different types of stimuli. This is\nthe first of its kind study which bridges this gap and looks for a direct\ncorrelation between music signal and EEG data using a robust mathematical\nmicroscope called Multifractal Detrended Cross Correlation Analysis (MFDXA).\nFor this, we took EEG data of 10 participants in 2 min 'rest state' (i.e. with\nwhite noise) and in 2 min 'tanpura drone' (musical stimulus) listening\ncondition. Next, the EEG signals from different electrodes were sonified and\nMFDXA technique was used to assess the degree of correlation (or the cross\ncorrelation coefficient) between tanpura signal and EEG signals. The variation\nof {\\gamma}x for different lobes during the course of the experiment also\nprovides major interesting new information. Only music stimuli has the ability\nto engage several areas of the brain significantly unlike other stimuli (which\nengages specific domains only).\n", "  We presented experimental and theoretical studies of the effect of an\nexternal magnetic field on the forbidden transition in the bosonic Sr atom. In\nour ultra-cold atomic system, the excitation fraction of\n$5s5p$~$^3P_0$~-~$5s^2$~$^1S_0$ forbidden transition was measured under the\ncircumstance of the different magnetic field strengths by using the normalized\ndetection method. Based on perturbation theory, we calculated the\nmagnetic-field-induced $5s5p$~$^3P_0$~-~$5s^2$~$^1S_0$ transition rate. The\nexcitation fraction as a function of the magnetic field strength was deduced\naccording to the calculated results. A good agreement was found between the\nexperimental measurements and the calculations. This study should be helpful in\nevaluating the magnetic field effects on the forbidden transition rate with\nhigher accuracy. Moreover, it can help to understand the ultra-cold atomic\ninteraction in the external magnetic field.\n", "  In a quantum dot hybrid superconducting junction, the behavior of the\nsupercurrent is dominated by Coulomb blockade physics, which determines the\nmagnetic state of the dot. In particular, in a single level quantum dot singly\noccupied, the sign of the supercurrent can be reversed, giving rise to a\npi-junction. This 0-pi transition, corresponding to a singlet-doublet\ntransition, is then driven by the gate voltage or by the superconducting phase\nin the case of strong competition between the superconducting proximity effect\nand Kondo correlations. In a two-level quantum dot, such as a clean carbon\nnanotube, 0-pi transitions exist as well but, because more cotunneling\nprocesses are allowed, are not necessarily associated to a magnetic state\ntransition of the dot. In this proceeding, after a review of 0-pi transitions\nin Josephson junctions, we present measurements of current-phase relation in a\nclean carbon nanotube quantum dot, in the single and two-level regimes. In the\nsingle level regime, close to orbital degeneracy and in a regime of strong\ncompetition between local electronic correlations and superconducting proximity\neffect, we find that the phase diagram of the phase-dependent transition is a\nuniversal characteristic of a discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition\nat zero temperature. In the case where the two levels are involved, the\nnanotube Josephson current exhibits a continuous 0-pi transition, independent\nof the superconducting phase, revealing a different physical mechanism of the\ntransition.\n", "  Using the 2+1 flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model with the Polyakov loop,\nwe determine the structure of the QCD phase diagram in an external magnetic\nfield. Beyond the usual NJL model with constant couplings, we also consider a\nvariant with a magnetic field dependent scalar coupling, which reproduces the\nInverse Magnetic Catalysis (IMC) at zero chemical potential. We conclude that\nthe IMC affects the location of the Critical End Point, and found indications\nthat, for high enough magnetic fields, the chiral phase transition at zero\nchemical potential might change from an analytic to a first-order phase\ntransition.\n", "  The paper presents hodograph transformation between nonlocal short pulse\nmodels and the first member in the AKNS negative hierarchy (AKNS($-1$)). We\nconsider real and complex multi-component cases. It is shown that the\nindependent variables of the short pulse models and AKNS($-1$) that are\nconnected via hodograph transformation are covariant in nonlocal reductions.\n", "  We prove the existence of a limit shape for the dimer model on planar\nperiodic bipartite graphs with an arbitrary fundamental domain and arbitrary\nperiodic weights. This proof is based on a variational principle that uses the\nlocality of the model and the compactness of the space of states.\n", "  We introduce K\\\"ahler-Poisson algebras as analogues of algebras of smooth\nfunctions on K\\\"ahler manifolds, and prove that they share several properties\nwith their classical counterparts on an algebraic level. For instance, the\nmodule of inner derivations of a K\\\"ahler-Poisson algebra is a finitely\ngenerated projective module, and allows for a unique metric and torsion-free\nconnection whose curvature enjoys all the classical symmetries. Moreover,\nstarting from a large class of Poisson algebras, we show that every algebra has\nan associated K\\\"ahler-Poisson algebra constructed as a localization. At the\nend, detailed examples are provided in order to illustrate the novel concepts.\n", "  Controlling the transmission of electrical current using a quantum point\ncontact constriction paved a way to a large variety of experiments in\nmesoscopic physics. The increasing interest in heat transfer in such systems\nfosters questions about possible manipulations of quantum heat modes that do\nnot carry net charge(neutral modes). Here, we study the transmission of\nupstream neutral modes through a quantum point contact in fractional\nhole-conjugate quantum Hall states. Employing two different measurement\ntechniques, we were able to render the relative spatial distribution of these\nchargeless modes with their charged counter-parts. In these states, which were\nfound to harbor more than one downstream charge mode, the upstream neutral\nmodes are found to flow with the inner charge mode - as theoretically\npredicted. These results unveil a universal upstream heat current structure and\nopen the path for more complex engineering of heat flows and cooling mechanisms\nin quantum nano-electronic devices.\n", "  We consider bosonic quantum complex networks as structured finite\nenvironments for a quantum harmonic oscillator and investigate the interplay\nbetween the network structure and its spectral density, excitation transport\nproperties and non-Markovianity. After a review of the formalism used, we\ndemonstrate how even small changes to the network structure can have a large\nimpact on the transport of excitations. We then consider the non-Markovianity\nover ensemble averages of several different types of random networks of\nidentical oscillators and uniform coupling strength. Our results show that\nincreasing the number of interactions in the network tends to suppress the\naverage non-Markovianity. This suggests that tree networks are the random\nnetworks optimizing this quantity.\n", "  To overcome the difficulty of realizing large-scale quantum Fourier transform\n(QFT) within existing technology, this paper presents a resource-saving method,\nnamely t-bit semiclassical QFT over (Z_(2^n)), which could realize large-scale\nQFT using arbitrary-scale quantum register. Using our method, the scale of\nquantum register can be determined flexibility according to the scale of\nquantum system, enabling the quantum resource and speed of realizing QFT to be\noptimal. By developing a feasible method to realize the control quantum gate\nR_k, we experimentally demonstrate the 2-bit semiclassical QFT over (Z_(2^3))\non IBM's quantum cloud computer, showing the feasibility of our proposed\nmethod. Then, we compare the actual performance of 2-bit semiclassical QFT and\nstandard QFT in the experiments. Experimental data show that the fidelity of\nthe result of 2-bit semiclassical QFT is higher than that of standard QFT,\nwhich is mainly due to less two-qubit controlled gates are required in the\nsemiclassical QFT. Furthermore, based on the proposed method, we successfully\nimplement the Shor's algorithm to factorize N=15.\n", "  We measure the polarization of a photon gas in a dye-filled microcavity. The\npolarization is obtained by a single-shot measurement of the Stokes parameters.\nWe find that the polarization of both the thermal cloud and the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate of photons (phBEC) does not differ from shot to shot. In the case of\nthe phBEC, we find that the polarization correlates with the polarization of\nthe pump pulse. The polarization of the thermal cloud is independent of\nparameters varied in the experiment and is governed by a hidden anisotropy in\nthe system.\n", "  This work presents a new parametrisation suitable for parameter-space studies\nof heliocentric Earth-impacting orbits. Originally motivated by the issue of\npotentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) and the mitigation of such a risk, we\nshow that the simultaneous analysis of all the conceivable impacting elliptical\norbits is greatly facilitated by the use of a parametrisation that involves\nonly the true anomaly at impact, the eccentricity and the inclination.\n  While the new parametrisation is presented from an explicit planetary-defence\nperspective, it is general enough to be useful in analogous studies.\n", "  The collective diffusion effects in system of a colloidal particles in a\nliquid crystal has been proposed. In this article described peculiarity of\ncollective diffusion colloidal particles in a liquid crystal, which can be\nobserve experimentally. The diffusion coefficient should be crucial dependence\nfrom temperature and concentration of particles. In system colloidal particles\narise from the elastic distortion of the elastic director field the\ninter-particle interaction. These interaction can cause nontrivial collective\nbehavior, as the results the non-monotonic dependence collective diffusion. Are\npredicted a nontrivial behavior collective diffusion of colloidal particles in\na liquid crystal.\n", "  We study the force production dynamics of undulating elastic plates as a\nmodel for fish-like inertial swimmers. Using a beam model coupled with\nLighthill's large-amplitude elongated-body theory, we explore different\nlocalised actuations at one extremity of the plate (heaving, pitching, and a\ncombination of both) in order to quantify the reactive and resistive\ncontributions to the thrust. The latter has the form of a quadratic drag in\nlarge Reynolds number swimmers and has recently been pointed out as a crucial\nelement in the thrust force balance. We validate the output of a weakly\nnonlinear solution to the fluid--structure model using thrust force\nmeasurements from an experiment with flexible plates subjected to the three\ndifferent actuation types. The model is subsequently used in a self-propelled\nconfiguration ---with a skin friction model that balances thrust to produce a\nconstant cruising speed--- to map the reactive versus resistive thrust\nproduction in a parameter space defined by the aspect ratio and the actuation\nfrequency. We show that this balance is modified as the frequency of excitation\nchanges and the response of the elastic plate shifts between different resonant\nmodes, the pure heaving case being the most sensitive to the modal response\nwith drastic changes in the reactive/resistive contribution ratio along the\nfrequency axis. We analyse also the role of the phase lag between the heaving\nand pitching components in the case of combined actuation, showing in\nparticular a non-trivial effect on the propulsive efficiency.\n", "  The probability of quantum relocation of a human body, at a given distance,\nis estimated using two different methods, giving comparable results. Not only\nthe obtained values for the probabilities are inconceivably small, but\nassumptions of a sci-fi nature are also necessary to ensure that they are not\nidentical to zero. The notions of 'non-spatiality' and 'superselection rule'\nare also briefly discussed.\n", "  The evaluation and monitoring of cells health in the human retina is crucial\nand follow time course of retinal diseases, detect lesions before irreversible\nvisual loss and to evaluate treatment effects. Towards this goal, a major\nchallenge is to image and quantify retinal cells in human eyes in a\nnon-invasive manner. Despite the phenomenal advances in Optical Coherence\nTomography (OCT) and Adaptive Optics systems, in vivo imaging of many of these\ncells is limited by the fact that cell contrast in reflection is extremely low.\nHere, we report on a major advance by proposing and demonstrating a radically\ndifferent method compared with OCT to visualize retinal cells with high\ncontrast, resolution and an acquisition time suitable for clinical use. The\nmethod uses a transscleral illumination which provides a high numerical\naperture in a dark field configuration. The light backscattered by the Retinal\nPigment Epithelium (RPE) and the choroid provides a forward illumination for\nthe upper layer of the retina, thus providing a transmission illumination\ncondition. By collecting the scattered light through the pupil, the partially\ncoherent illumination produces dark field images, which are combined to\nreconstruct a quasi-quantitative phase image with twice the numerical aperture\ngiven by the eye's pupil. The retrieved quasi-quantitative phase images (QPI)\nof cells in ex vivo human and pig's eyes are validated with those taken with a\nstandard QPI system. We then apply the technique in vivo on human eye, without\npupil dilation, we demonstrated the feasibility to image retinal cells up to\nthe retinal pigment epithelium within a few seconds.\n", "  We consider the perturbed sine-Gordon equation $\\theta_{tt}-\\theta_{xx}+\\sin\n\\theta=\n  \\varepsilon^2 f(\\varepsilon x)$, where the external perturbation\n$\\varepsilon^2 f(\\varepsilon x)$ corresponds to a small, slowly varying\nelectric field. We show that the initial value problem with an appropriate\ninitial state close enough to the solitary manifold has a unique solution,\nwhich follows up to time $1/{\\varepsilon}$ and errors of order $\\varepsilon^{\n3/4}$ a trajectory on the solitary manifold. The trajectory on the solitary\nmanifold is described by ODEs, which agree approximately up to errors of order\n$\\varepsilon^3$ with Hamilton equations for the restricted to the solitary\nmanifold sine-Gordon Hamiltonian.\n", "  A combination of theoretical calculation and the experimental synthesis to\nexplore the new ternary compound is demonstrated in the Sr-Pt-Bi system. Since\nPt-Bi is considered as a new critical charge-transfer pair for\nsuperconductivity, it inspired us to investigate the Sr-Pt-Bi system. With a\nthorough calculation of all the known stable/metastable compounds in the\nSr-Pt-Bi system and crystal structure predictions, the thermodynamic stability\nof hypothetical stoichiometry, SrPtBi2, is determined. Followed by the\nhigh-temperature synthesis and crystallographic analysis, the first ternary\nbismuthide in Sr-Pt-Bi, SrPtBi2 was prepared and the stoichiometry was\nconfirmed experimentally. SrPtBi2 crystallizes in the space group Pnma (S.G.\n62, Pearson Symbol oP48), which matches well with theoretical prediction using\nan adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA). Using first-principles calculations, we\ndemonstrate that the orthorhombic structure has lower formation energies than\nother 112 structure types, such as tetragonal BaMnBi2 (CuSmP2) and LaAuBi2\n(CuHfSi2) structure types. The bonding analysis indicates the Pt-Bi\ninteractions play a critical role in structural stability. The physical\nproperties measurements show the metallic properties with low electron-phonon\ninteractions at the low temperature, which agrees with the electronic structure\nassessment.\n", "  We investigate the triggering and guiding of DC high-voltage discharges over\na distance of 37 cm by filaments produced by ultraviolet (266 nm) laser pulses\nof 200 ps duration. The latter reduce the breakdown electric field by half and\nallow up to 80% discharge probability in an electric field of 920 kV/m. This\nhigh efficiency is not further increased by adding nanosecond pulses in the\nJoule range at 532 nm and 1064 nm. However, the latter statistically increases\nthe guiding length, thereby accelerating the discharge by a factor of 2. This\neffect is due both to photodetachment and to the heating of the plasma channel,\nthat increases the efficiency of avalanche ionization and reduces electron\nattachment and recombination.\n", "  Results of crystallographic refinement, the relationship between electron\ncounts and structural stability, and magnetic characterization of YT$_x$Ge$_2$\n(T= Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) prepared using the arc melting method are\npresented. These YT$_x$Ge$_2$ compounds crystallize in the\nBaCuSn$_2$-CeNi$_1$$_-$$_x$Si$_2$-type structure with space group Cmcm, and the\nsite occupancies of 3d transition metals range from x = 0.22(1) for Cr to x =\n0.66(1) for Ni. Based on a combination of single crystal and powder X-ray\ndiffraction and scanning electron microscopy, the trends are clearly\nestablished that the smaller transition metal atoms exhibit larger occupancies\non T (Cu) site. Our investigation into the relationship between electron count\nand site defect reveals that a stable configuration is obtained when reaching\n10.3e- per transition metal (Y+T), which strongly correlates with the defect\nobserved in the case of T metals. Magnetic properties measurements indicate\nparamagnetism for T = Cr, Fe, and Co, but ferromagnetism for T = Mn with a\nCurie temperature at 293 K and effective moment ~ 3.6 uB/Mn. The absence of\nsuperconductivity in this series is surprising because they consist of similar\nbuilding blocks and electron counts to superconducting\nYGe$_1$$_.$$_5$$_+$$_d$Si$_2$ except for 3d transition metals. Introducing 3d\ntransition metals into the system plays a critical role in suppressing\nsuperconductivity, offering new insights into the interplay between\nsuperconductivity and magnetism in layered intermetallics.\n", "  The molecular structure of dimyristoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) monolayers\non a water substrate in different phase states has been investigated under\nnormal conditions by X-ray reflectometry with a photon energy of ~ 8 keV.\nAccording to the experimental data, the transition from a two-dimensional\nexpanded liquid state to a solid gel state (liquid crystal) accompanied by the\nordering of the hydrocarbon tails of the DMPS molecule occurs in the monolayer\nas the surface pressure rises. The monolayer thickness is (20 +/- 3) Angstrom\nand (28 +/- 2) Angstrom in the liquid and solid phases, respectively, with the\ndeflection angle of the molecular tail axis from the normal to the surface in\nthe gel phase being (26 +/- 8) deg. At least a twofold decrease in the degree\nof hydration of the polar lipid groups also occurs under two-dimensional\nmonolayer compression. The reflectometry data have been analyzed using two\napproaches: under the assumption about the presence of two layers with\ndifferent electron densities in the monolayer and without any assumptions about\nthe transverse surface structure. Both approaches demonstrate satisfactory\nagreement between themselves in describing the experimental results.\n", "  Finite dimensional solutions to a class of stochastic partial differential\nequations are obtained extending the differential constraints method for\ndeterministic PDE to the stochastic framework. A geometrical reformulation of\nthe stochastic problem using the concept of infinite jet bundles is provided\nand a practical algorithm for explicitly computing these finite dimensional\nsolutions is developed. This method, covering the majority of the current\nliterature, is applied to a set of new SPDEs admitting finite dimensional\nsolutions taken from Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework, stochastic hydrodynamics\nand filtering theory.\n", "  The semi-velocity is defined as an exponential function of the rapidity.\nPhysically the semi-velocity is interpreted as the relativistic analogue of the\nphase velocity, a geometrical interpretation done within the framework of\nBeltrami-Klein and Poincar\\'e models. A kinematical wave equation related with\nthe Fermat principle and the concept of the semi-velocity is derived.\n", "  The glueball-quarkonia mixture decay amplitude has been evaluated, in the\nliterature, by diagrammatic techniques for drawing quark lines and the\nquark-gluon vertex. In this paper we use an alternative approach which consists\nin a mapping technique, the Fock-Tani formalism, in order to obtain an\neffective Hamiltonian starting from microscopic interactions. An extra effect\nis present in this formalism associated to the extended nature of mesons:\nbound-state corrections, which introduces an additional decay amplitude and\nsets a fine-tuning procedure for general meson decay calculations. The\n$f_0(1500) \\to \\pi \\pi$ channel shall be considered as numerical example of the\nprocedure.\n", "  We report on the selective fabrication of high-quality Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and\nSrIrO$_3$ epitaxial thin films from a single polycrystalline Sr$_2$IrO$_4$\ntarget by pulsed laser deposition. Using a combination of X-ray diffraction and\nphotoemission spectroscopy characterizations, we discover that within a\nrelatively narrow range of substrate temperature, the oxygen partial pressure\nplays a critical role in the cation stoichiometric ratio of the films, and\ntriggers the stabilization of different Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phases. Resonant\nX-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements taken at the Ir $L$-edge and the O\n$K$-edge demonstrate the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling, and reveal the\nelectronic and orbital structures of both compounds. These results suggest that\nin addition to the conventional thermodynamics consideration, higher members of\nthe Sr$_{n+1}$Ir$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ series can possibly be achieved by kinetic\ncontrol away from the thermodynamic limit. These findings offer a new approach\nto the synthesis of ultra-thin films of the RP series of iridates and can be\nextended to other complex oxides with layered structure.\n", "  The famous Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality certifies a quantum\nviolation, by a factor $\\sqrt{2}$, of correlations predicted by the classical\nview of the world in the simplest possible nontrivial measurement setup (two\nsystems with two dichotomic measurements each). In such setting, this is the\nlargest possible violation, which is known as the \\emph{Tsirelson bound}. In\nthis paper we calculate the exact values of quantum violations for the other\nBell correlation inequalities that appear in the setups involving up to four\nmeasurements; they are all smaller than $\\sqrt{2}$. While various authors\ninvestigated these inequalities via numerical methods, our approach is\nanalytic. We also include tables summarizing facial structure of Bell polytopes\nin low dimensions.\n", "  If confocal microscopy is an ubiquitous tool in life science, its\napplications in chemistry and materials science are still, in comparison, very\nlimited. Of particular interest in these domains is the use of confocal\nmicroscopy to investigate temperature-dependent phenomena such as\nself-assembly, diffusio- or thermophoresis, or crystal growth. Several hurdles\nmust be solved to develop a temperature-controlled stage for laser scanning\nconfocal microscopy, in particular regarding the influence of an elevated\ntemperature gradient close to the microscope objective, which most people try\nvery hard to avoid. Here we report the design of a temperature-controlled stage\nable to generate stable temperature gradients in both positive and negative\ntemperature range and does not require use of liquid nitrogen. Our setup\nprovides an excellent control of the temperature gradient, which can be coupled\nwith a controlled displacement of the sample, making it useful in particular\nfor a variety of solidification, chemistry, and interfacial problems. We\nillustrate the benefits of our setup with several case studies of interest in\nchemistry and materials science: the 3D real-time imaging of ice growth, the\nsegregation of hard particles by growing crystals, the freezing behaviour of\nsingle emulsions, the self-shaping of oil droplets upon cooling, and the\nself-assembly of amphiphile molecules into helical structures. These results\nshow how confocal microscopy coupled with a temperature-controlled stage is a\nwelcome addition to the toolkit of chemists and materials scientists.\n", "  Charge transfer can take place along double helical DNA over distances as\nlong as 30 nanometers. However, given the active role of the thermal\nenvironment surrounding charge carriers in DNA, physical mechanisms driving the\ntransfer process are highly debated. Moreover, the overall potential of DNA to\nact as a conducting material in nanoelectronic circuits is questionable. Here,\nwe identify key principles in DNA nanoelectronics by performing an exhaustive\ncomputational study. The electronic structure of double-stranded DNA is\ndescribed with a coarse-grained model. The dynamics of the molecular system and\nits environment is taken into account using a quantum scattering method,\nmimicking incoherent, elastic and inelastic effects. By analyzing all possible\nsequences with 3 to 7 base pairs, we identify fundamental principles in DNA\nnanoelectronics: The environment crucially influences the electrical\nconductance of DNA, and the majority of sequences conduct via a mixed,\ncoherent-incoherent mechanism. Likewise, the metal-molecule coupling and the\ngateway states play significant roles in the transport behavior. While most\nsequences analyzed here are exposed to be rather poor electrical conductors, we\nidentify exceptional DNA molecules, which we predict to be excellent and robust\nconductors of electric current over a wide range of physical conditions.\n", "  Magnetically ordered, electrically insulating materials pave the way towards\nnovel spintronic devices. In these materials the flow of magnetic excitations\nsuch as magnons results in pure spin currents. These spin currents can be\ndriven by gradients of the spin chemical potential and/or temperature such that\nthey can play the same role in novel spintronic devices as charge currents in\ntraditional electronic circuits. Connecting spin current based and charge\ncurrent based devices requires spin to charge interconversion. This has been\nachieved by the spin Hall effect with an efficiency of several 10%. The recent\nprogress in materials development and understanding of pure spin current\nphysics opens up a plethora of novel device concepts and opportunities for\nfundamental studies.\n", "  In this paper, a new size-dependent Timoshenko beam model is developed based\non the consistent couple stress theory. In the present formulation, the\ngoverning equations and corresponding boundary conditions are obtained.\nAfterwards, this formulation is used to investigate size-dependency for several\nelementary beam problems. Analytical solutions are obtained for pure bending of\na beam and for a cantilever beam with partially and fully clamped boundary\nconditions. These analytical results are then compared to the numerical results\nfrom a two-dimensional finite element formulation for the corresponding couple\nstress continuum problem.\n", "  The system identification problem is to estimate dynamical parameters from\nthe output data, obtained by performing measurements on the output fields. We\ninvestigate system identification for quantum linear systems. Our main\nobjectives are to address the following general problems: (1) Which parameters\ncan be identified by measuring the output? (2) How can we construct a system\nrealisation from sufficient input-output data? (3) How well can we estimate the\nparameters governing the dynamics? We investigate these problems in two\ncontrasting approaches; using time-dependent inputs or time-stationary (quantum\nnoise) inputs.\n", "  We study the inelastic neutron scattering cross section in the vicinity of\ntouching points in magnon bands. Among the possible touching points are magnon\nWeyl points in three dimensional ordered magnets with significant spin-orbit\ncoupling that are characterized by a linear dispersion in their vicinity. A\nWeyl point is topologically protected by its net chirality and here we show\nthat this leads to a characteristic form for the dynamical structure factor. To\naddress this question, we show that scattering intensities in the vicinity of\narbitrary magnon two-band touching points are identical to expectation values\nof the pseudospin polarization along some direction $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}$ in\nmomentum space fixed by the magnetic Hamiltonian. This approach applied to Weyl\npoints shows that they are singular points in the intensity of the form\n$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}\\cdot \\delta\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$ regardless of the\nmagnetic ground state. We make specific predictions for the experimental\nsignatures of such intensity singularities in several spin models hosting Weyl\nmagnons applicable to candidate materials.\n", "  Cyclotomic polylogarithms are reviewed and new results concerning the special\nconstants that occur are presented. This also allows some comments on previous\nliterature results using PSLQ.\n", "  Plasma-based accelerators have achieved tremendous progress in the past few\ndecades, thanks to the advances of high power lasers and the availability of\nhigh-energy and relativistic particle beams. However, the electrons (or\npositrons) accelerated in the plasma wakefields are subject to radiation\nlosses, which generally suppress the final energy gains of the beams. In this\npaper, radiation reaction in plasma-based high-energy accelerators is\ninvestigated using test particle approach. Energy-frontier TeV colliders based\non a multiple stage laser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator and a\nsingle-staged proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerator are studied in detail.\nThe results show that the higher axial and transverse field gradients seen by\nan off-axis injected witness beam result in a stronger damping force on the\naccelerated particles. Proton-driven plasma wakefield accelerated electrons are\nshown to lose less energy compared to those accelerated in a multi-staged\nlaser-driven plasma wakefield accelerator.\n", "  Heisenberg introduced his famous uncertainty relations in a seminal 1927\npaper entitled \"The Physical Content of Quantum Kinematics and Mechanics\". He\nmotivated his arguments with a gedanken experiment, a gamma ray microscope to\nmeasure the position of a particle. A primary result was that, due to the\nquantum nature of light, there is an inherent uncertainty in the determinations\nof the particle's position and momentum dictated by an indeterminacy relation,\n$\\delta q \\delta p \\sim h$. Heisenberg offered this demonstration as \"a direct\nphysical interpretation of the [quantum mechanical] equation $\\textbf{pq} -\n\\textbf{qp} = -i\\hbar$\" but considered the indeterminacy relation to be much\nmore than this. He also argued that it implies limitations on the very meanings\nof position and momentum and emphasized that these limitations are the source\nof the statistical character of quantum mechanics. In addition, Heisenberg\nhoped but was unable to demonstrate that the laws of quantum mechanics could be\nderived directly from the uncertainty relation. In this paper, we revisit\nHeisenberg's microscope and argue that the Schr\\\"odinger equation for a free\nparticle does indeed follow from the indeterminacy relation together with\nreasonable statistical assumptions.\n", "  A suite of science instruments is critical to any high contrast imaging\nfacility, as it defines the science capabilities and observing modes available.\nSCExAO uses a modular approach which allows for state-of-the-art visitor\nmodules to be tested within an observatory environment on an 8-m class\ntelescope. This allows for rapid prototyping of new and innovative imaging\ntechniques that otherwise take much longer in traditional instrument design.\nWith the aim of maturing science modules for an advanced high contrast imager\non an giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) that will be capable of imaging\nterrestrial planets, we offer an overview and status update on the various\nscience modules currently under test within the SCExAO instrument.\n", "  Mechanoelectrical transduction in the inner ear is a biophysical process\nunderlying the senses of hearing and balance. The key players involved in this\nprocess are mechanosensitive ion channels. They are located in the stereocilia\nof hair cells and opened by the tension in specialized molecular springs, the\ntip links, connecting adjacent stereocilia. When channels open, the tip links\nrelax, reducing the hair-bundle stiffness. This gating compliance makes hair\ncells especially sensitive to small stimuli. The classical explanation for the\ngating compliance is that the conformational rearrangement of a single channel\ndirectly shortens the tip link. However, to reconcile theoretical models based\non this mechanism with experimental data, an unrealistically large structural\nchange of the channel is required. Experimental evidence indicates that each\ntip link is a dimeric molecule, associated on average with two channels at its\nlower end. It also indicates that the lipid bilayer modulates channel gating,\nalthough it is not clear how. Here, we design and analyze a model of\nmechanotransduction where each tip link attaches to two channels, mobile within\nthe membrane. Their states and positions are coupled by membrane-mediated\nelastic forces arising from the interaction between the channels' hydrophobic\ncores and that of the lipid bilayer. This coupling induces cooperative opening\nand closing of the channels. The model reproduces the main properties of\nhair-cell mechanotransduction using only realistic parameters constrained by\nexperimental evidence. This work provides an insight into the fundamental role\nthat membrane-mediated ion-channel cooperativity can play in sensory\nphysiology.\n"]}
