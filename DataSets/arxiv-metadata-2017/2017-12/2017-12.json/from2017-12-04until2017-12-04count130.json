When undergoing particle absorption, the\nchanges of the entropy and irreducible mass are shown to be dependent on the\nparticle radial momentum. The black hole thermodynamic behaviors are dependent\non dimensionality for specific rotations. For a 4-dimensional Kerr black hole,\nits black hole properties are maintained for any particle absorption.\n5-dimensional black holes can avoid a naked ring singularity by absorbing a\nparticle in specific momenta ranges. Black holes over 6 dimensions become\nultra-spinning black holes through a specific form of particle absorption. The\nmicroscopical changes are interpreted in limited cases of Myers-Perry black\nholes using Kerr/CFT correspondence. We systematically describe the black hole\nproperties changed by particle absorption in all dimensions.\n", "  All Darboux integrable difference equations on the quad-graph are described\nin the case of the equations that possess autonomous first-order integrals in\none of the characteristics. A generalization of the discrete Liouville equation\nis obtained from a subclass of these equation via a non-point transformation.\nThe general proposition on the symmetry structure of the quad-graph equations\nis proved as an auxiliary result.\n", "  In this paper we study compactifications of heterotic string theory on\nmanifolds satisfying the ddbar-lemma. We consider the Strominger system\ndescription of the low energy supergravity to first order in alpha' and show\nthat the moduli of such compactifications are subspaces of familiar cohomology\ngroups such as H^1(TX), H^1(TX*), H^1(End_0(V)) and H^1(End_0(TX)). These\ngroups encode the complex structure, Kahler moduli, bundle moduli and\nperturbations of the spin connection respectively in the case of a Calabi-Yau\ncompactification. We investigate the fluctuations of only a subset of the\nconditions of the Strominger system (expected to correspond physically to\nF-term constraints in the effective theory). The full physical moduli space is,\ntherefore, given by a further restriction on these degrees of freedom which we\ndiscuss but do not explicitly provide. This paper is complementary to a\nprevious tree-level worldsheet analysis of such moduli and agrees with that\ndiscussion in the limit of vanishing alpha'. The structure we present can be\ninterpreted in terms of recent work in Atiyah and Courant algebroids, and we\nconjecture links with aspects of Hitchin's generalized geometry to heterotic\nmoduli.\n", "  We report experimental results on the action of selected local environments\non the fidelity of the quantum teleportation protocol, taking into account\nnon-ideal, realistic entangled resources. Different working conditions are\ntheoretically identified, where a noisy protocol can be made almost insensitive\nto further addition of noise. We put to test these conditions on a photonic\nimplementation of the quantum teleportation algorithm, where two polarization\nentangled qubits act as the entangled resource and a path qubit on Alice\nencodes the state to be teleported. Bob's path qubit is used to implement a\nlocal environment, while the environment on Alice's qubit is simulated as a\nweighed average of different pure states. We obtain a good agreement with the\ntheoretical predictions, we experimentally recreate the conditions to obtain a\nnoise-induced enhancement of the protocol fidelity, and we identify parameter\nregions of increased insensibility to interactions with specific noisy\nenvironments.\n", "  We show how the spin independent scattering of two initially distant qubits,\nsay, in distinct traps or in remote sites of a lattice, can be used to\nimplement an entangling quantum gate between them. The scattering takes place\nunder 1D confinement for which we consider two different scenarios: a 1D\nwave-guide and a tight-binding lattice. We consider models with contact-like\ninteraction between two fermionic or two bosonic particles. A qubit is encoded\nin two distinct spins (or other internal) states of each particle. Our scheme\nenables the implementation of a gate between two qubits which are initially too\nfar to interact directly, and provides an alternative to photonic mediators for\nthe scaling of quantum computers. Fundamentally, an interesting feature is that\n\"identical particles\" (e.g., two atoms of the same species) and the 1D\nconfinement, are both necessary for the action of the gate. Finally, we discuss\nthe feasibility of our scheme, the degree of control required to initialize the\nwave-packets momenta, and show how the quality of the gate is affected by\nmomentum distributions and initial distance. In a lattice, the control of\nquasi-momenta is naturally provided by few local edge impurities in the lattice\npotential.\n", "  This review introduces physical processes in protoplanetary disks relevant to\naccretion and the initial stages of planet formation. After a brief overview of\nthe observational context, I introduce the elementary theory of disk structure\nand evolution, review the gas-phase physics of angular momentum transport\nthrough turbulence and disk winds, and discuss possible origins for the\nepisodic accretion observed in Young Stellar Objects. Turning to solids, I\nreview the evolution of single particles under aerodynamic forces, and describe\nthe conditions necessary for the development of collective gas-particle\ninstabilities. Observations show that disks can exhibit pronounced large-scale\nstructure, and I discuss the types of structures that may form from gas and\nparticle interactions at ice lines, vortices and zonal flows, prior to the\nformation of large planetary bodies. I conclude with disk dispersal.\n", "  We consider the signals arising from top partner pair production at the LHC\nas a probe of theories of Neutral Naturalness. We focus on scenarios in which\ntop partners carry electroweak charges, such as Folded SUSY or the Quirky\nLittle Higgs. In this class of theories the top partners are pair produced as\nquirky bound states, since they are charged under a mirror color group whose\nlightest states are hidden glueballs. The quirks promptly de-excite and\nannihilate into glueballs, which decay back to SM fermions via Higgs mixing.\nThis can give rise to spectacular signatures at the LHC, such displaced decays,\nor high-multiplicity prompt production of many hard $\\bar b b$ or $\\tau^+\n\\tau^-$ pairs. We show that signals arising from top partner pair production\nconstitute the primary discovery channel for this class of theories in most\nregions of parameter space, and might provide the only experimental probe of\nscenarios with sub-cm glueball decay lengths. The measurement of top partner\nmasses and couplings, which could be used to test the neutral naturalness\nmechanism directly, is also a tantalizing possibility.\n", "  We study the soliton modes carrying fractional quantum numbers in\none-dimensional superfluids. In the $s$-wave pairing superfluid with the phase\nof the order parameter twisted by opposite angles $\\pm \\varphi/2$ at the two\nends there is an emergent complex $Z_2$ soliton mode carrying fractional spin\nnumber $\\varphi /(2\\pi)$ if there is only one pairing branch. We demonstrate\nthat in finite systems of length $L$, the spin density for one pairing branch\nin the presence of a single soliton mode consists of two terms, a localized\nspin density profile carrying fractional quantum number $\\varphi/(2\\pi)$, and a\nuniform background $-\\varphi /(2\\pi L)$. The latter one vanishes in the\nthermodynamic limit leaving a single soliton mode carrying fractional\nexcitation, however it is essential to keep the total quantum number conserved\nin finite systems. This analysis is also applicable to other systems with\nfractional quantum numbers, thus provides a mechanism to understand the\ncompatibility of the emergence of fractional charges with the integral\nquantization of charges in a finite system. For the $p$-wave pairing superfluid\nwith the chemical potential interpolating between the strong and weak pairing\nphases, the $Z_2$ soliton is associated with a Majorana zero mode. By\nintroducing the dimension density, we argue that the Majorana zero mode may be\nunderstood as an object with 1/2 dimension of the single particle Hilbert\nspace. We conjecture a connection of the dimension density of one-dimensional\nsolitons with the quantum dimension of topological excitations.\n", "  The design of an efficient curing policy, able to stem an epidemic process at\nan affordable cost, has to account for the structure of the population contact\nnetwork supporting the contagious process. Thus, we tackle the problem of\nallocating recovery resources among the population, at the lowest cost possible\nto prevent the epidemic from persisting indefinitely in the network.\nSpecifically, we analyze a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic process\nspreading over a weighted graph, by means of a first-order mean-field\napproximation. First, we describe the influence of the contact network on the\ndynamics of the epidemics among a heterogeneous population, that is possibly\ndivided into communities. For the case of a community network, our\ninvestigation relies on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition; we\nshow that the epidemic threshold, a key measure of the network robustness\nagainst epidemic spreading, can be determined using a lower-dimensional\ndynamical system. Exploiting the computation of the epidemic threshold, we\ndetermine a cost-optimal curing policy by solving a convex minimization\nproblem, which possesses a reduced dimension in the case of a community\nnetwork. Lastly, we consider a two-level optimal curing problem, for which an\nalgorithm is designed with a polynomial time complexity in the network size.\n", "  The canonical partition function of a two-dimensional lattice gas in a field\nof randomly placed traps, like many other problems in physics, evaluates to the\nGauss hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$ in the limit when one or more\nof its parameters become large. This limit is difficult to compute from first\nprinciples, and finding the asymptotic expansions of the hypergeometric\nfunction is therefore an important task. While some possible cases of the\nasymptotic expansions of ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$ have been provided in the\nliterature, they are all limited by a narrow domain of validity, either in the\ncomplex plane of the variable or in the parameter space. Overcoming this\nrestriction, we provide new asymptotic expansions for the hypergeometric\nfunction with two large parameters, which are valid for the entire complex\nplane of $z$ except for a few specific points. We show that these expansions\nwork well even when we approach the possible singularity of ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$,\n$|z|=1$, where the current expansions typically fail. Using our results we\ndetermine asymptotically the partition function of a lattice gas in a field of\ntraps in the different possible physical limits of few/many particles and\nfew/many traps, illustrating the applicability of the derived asymptotic\nexpansions of the HGF in physics.\n", "  We initiate a systematic study of 3-dimensional `defect' topological quantum\nfield theories, that we introduce as symmetric monoidal functors on stratified\nand decorated bordisms. For every such functor we construct a tricategory with\nduals, which is the natural categorification of a pivotal bicategory. This\ncaptures the algebraic essence of defect TQFTs, and it gives precise meaning to\nthe fusion of line and surface defects as well as their duality operations. As\nexamples, we discuss how Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro theories embed into\nour framework, and how they can be extended to defect TQFTs.\n", "  By assuming a deterministic evolution of quantum systems and taking realism\ninto account, we carefully build a hidden variable theory for Quantum Mechanics\nbased on the notion of ontological states proposed by 't Hooft. We view these\nontological states as the ones embedded with realism and compare them to the\n(usual) quantum states that represent superpositions, viewing the latter as\nmere information of the system they describe. Such a deterministic model puts\nforward conditions for the applicability of Bell's inequality: the usual\ninequality cannot be applied to the usual experiments. We build a Bell-like\ninequality that can be applied to the EPR scenario and show that this\ninequality is always satisfied by Quantum Mechanics. In this way we show that\nQuantum Mechanics can indeed have a local interpretation, and thus meet with\nthe causal structure imposed by the Theory of Special Relativity in a\nsatisfying way.\n", "  We study the velocity statistics distribution of an external heavy particle\nin holographic fluids. We argue that when the dual supergravity background has\na finite temperature horizon the velocity statistics goes generically as $1/v$,\ncompatible with the jet-quenching intuition from the quark-gluon plasma. A\ncareful analysis of the behavior of the classical string whose apparent\nworldsheet horizon deviates from the background horizon reveals that other\nregimes are possible. We numerically discuss two cases: the magnetized\nquark-gluon plasma and a model of superfluid flow. We explore a range of\nparameters in these top-down supergravity solutions including, respectively,\nthe magnetic field and the superfluid velocity. We determine that the velocity\nstatistics goes largely as $1/v$, however, as we leave the non-relativistic\nregime we observe some deviations.\n", "  Ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions produce a quark-gluon matter which\nlies in the future light cone originating from given points on the $t=z=0$\nplane of the Minkowski spacetime manifold. We show that in a weak coupling\nregime the Minkowski vacuum of massless fields presents itself in the \"Little\nBang\" region as a thermal state of low $p_{T}$ particles, in close analogy to\nthe Unruh effect for uniformly accelerated observers which are causally\nrestricted to a Rindler wedge. It can shed some light on the mechanisms of\nearly time thermalization in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.\n", "  Bug bounty programs offer a modern platform for organizations to crowdsource\ntheir software security and for security researchers to be fairly rewarded for\nthe vulnerabilities they find. Little is known however on the incentives set by\nbug bounty programs: How they drive new bug discoveries, and how they\nsupposedly improve security through the progressive exhaustion of discoverable\nvulnerabilities. Here, we recognize that bug bounty programs create tensions,\nfor organizations running them on the one hand, and for security researchers on\nthe other hand. At the level of one bug bounty program, security researchers\nface a sort of St-Petersburg paradox: The probability of finding additional\nbugs decays fast, and thus can hardly be matched with a sufficient increase of\nmonetary rewards. Furthermore, bug bounty program managers have an incentive to\ngather the largest possible crowd to ensure a larger pool of expertise, which\nin turn increases competition among security researchers. As a result, we find\nthat researchers have high incentives to switch to newly launched programs, for\nwhich a reserve of low-hanging fruit vulnerabilities is still available. Our\nresults inform on the technical and economic mechanisms underlying the dynamics\nof bug bounty program contributions, and may in turn help improve the mechanism\ndesign of bug bounty programs that get increasingly adopted by cybersecurity\nsavvy organizations.\n", "  The paper is devoted to the conjecture that an equation is Darboux integrable\nif and only if it possesses symmetries depending on arbitrary functions. We\nnote that results of previous works together prove this conjecture for scalar\npartial differential equations of the form $u_{xy}=F(x,y,u,u_x,u_y)$. For\nautonomous semi-discrete and discrete analogues of these equations we prove\nthat the sequence of Laplace invariants is terminated by zero for an equation\nif this equation admits an operator mapping any function of one independent\nvariable into a symmetry of the equation. The vanishing of an Laplace invariant\nallows us to construct a formal integral, i.e. an operator that maps symmetries\ninto integrals (including, generally speaking, trivial integrals). This and\nresults of previous works together prove a `formal' version of the\naforementioned conjecture in the semi-discrete and pure discrete cases.\n", "  We propose a new numerical method to determine the central charge of the\nconformal field theory models corresponding to the 2D lattice models. In this\nmethod, the free energy of the lattice model on the torus is calculated by the\nWang-Landau algorithm and then the central charge is obtained from a free\nenergy scaling with respect to the torus radii. The method is applied for\ndetermination of the central charge in the site-diluted Ising model.\n", "  We model a wire as a cylindrical potential barrier and calculate diffraction\nfrom that potential using quantum electrodynamics. We compare our results with\nclassical Fraunhofer diffraction. We find general agreement between the quantum\nand the classical results; however, we find that the classical approach\noverestimates the wire radius. We consider an incoming electron beam\ndiffracting from the potential. We also consider the case of an incoming photon\nbeam. For the photon case we only indicate the amplitudes that need to be\nevaluated numerically. We also study the case of two beams in phase that\ninterfere and diffract from the wire-like potential.\n", "  Upon doping, Mott insulators often exhibit symmetry breaking where charge\ncarriers and their spins organize into patterns known as stripes. For high-Tc\nsuperconducting cuprates, stripes are widely suspected to exist in a\nfluctuating form. Here, we use numerically exact determinant quantum Monte\nCarlo calculations to demonstrate dynamical stripe correlations in the\nthree-band Hubbard model, which represents the local electronic structure of\nthe Cu-O plane. Our results, which are robust to varying parameters, cluster\nsize, and boundary condition, strongly support the interpretation of a variety\nof experimental observations in terms of the physics of fluctuating stripes,\nincluding the hourglass magnetic dispersion and the Yamada plot of\nincommensurability vs. doping. These findings provide a novel perspective on\nthe intertwined orders emerging from the cuprates' normal state.\n", "  We present a theoretical scheme to simulate quantum field theory in a\ndiscrete curved spacetime based on the Bose-Hubbard model describing a\nBose-Einstein condensate trapped inside an optical lattice. Using the\nBose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we first introduce a hydrodynamic presentation of the\nsystem evolution in discrete space. We then show that the phase (density)\nfluctuations of the trapped bosons inside an optical lattice in the superfluid\n(Mott insulator) state obey the Klein-Gordon equation for a massless scalar\nfield propagating in a discrete curved spacetime. We derive the effective\nmetrics associated with the superfluid and Mott-insulator phases and, in\nparticular, we find that in the superfluid phase the metric exhibits a\nsingularity which can be considered as a the manifestation of an analog\nacoustic black hole. The proposed approach is found to provide a suitable\nplatform for quantum simulation of various spacetime metrics through adjusting\nthe system parameters.\n", "  We have revisited several interesting questions on how the rapidity-odd\ndirected flow is developed in relativistic $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 and 39 GeV based on a multiphase transport model. As the\npartonic phase evolves with time, the slope of the parton directed flow at\nmidrapidity region changes from negative to positive as a result of the later\ndynamics at 200 GeV, while it remains negative at 39 GeV due to the shorter\nlife time of the partonic phase. The directed flow splitting for various quark\nspecies due to their different initial eccentricities is observed at 39 GeV,\nwhile the splitting is very small at 200 GeV. From a dynamical coalescence\nalgorithm with Wigner functions, we found that the directed flow of hadrons is\na result of competition between the coalescence in momentum and coordinate\nspace as well as further modifications by the hadronic rescatterings.\n", "  Inverse engineering of Hamiltonian (IEH) from an evolution operator is a\nuseful technique for protocol of quantum control with potential applications in\nquantum information processing. In this paper we introduce a particular\nprotocol to perform IEH and we show how this scheme can be used for\nimplementing a set of quantum gates by using minimal quantum resources (such as\nentanglement, interactions between more than two quits or auxiliary quits).\nRemarkably, while previous protocols request three-quits interactions and/or\nauxiliary quits for implementing such gates, our protocol requires just\ntwo-qubit interactions and no auxiliary qubits. By using this approach, we can\nobtain a large class of Hamiltonians that allow us to implement single and\ntwo-quit gates necessary to quantum computation. To conclude this article, we\nanalyze the performance of our scheme against systematic errors related to\namplitude noise, where we show that the free parameters introduced in our\nscheme can be useful for enhancing the robustness of the protocol against such\nerrors.\n", "  Na$_2$IrO$_3$ was one of the first materials proposed to feature the\nKane-Mele type topological insulator phase. Contemporaneously it was claimed\nthat the very same material is in a Mott insulating phase which is described by\nthe Kitaev-Heisenberg (KH) model. First experiments indeed revealed Mott\ninsulating behavior in conjunction with antiferromagnetic long-range order.\nFurther refined experiments established antiferromagnetic order of zigzag type\nwhich is not captured by the KH model. Since then several extensions and\nmodifications of the KH model were proposed in order to describe the\nexperimental findings. Here we suggest that adding charge fluctuations to the\nKH model represents an alternative explanation of zigzag antiferromagnetism.\nMoreover, a phenomenological three-band Hubbard model unifies all the pieces of\nthe puzzle: topological insulator physics for weak and KH model for strong\nelectron-electron interactions as well as a zigzag antiferromagnet at\nintermediate interaction strength.\n", "  We study the real-time and real-space dynamics of charge in the\none-dimensional Hubbard model in the limit of high temperatures. To this end,\nwe prepare pure initial states with sharply peaked density profiles and\ncalculate the time evolution of these nonequilibrium states, by using numerical\nforward-propagation approaches to chains as long as 20 sites. For a class of\ntypical states, we find excellent agreement with linear-response theory and\nunveil the existence of remarkably clean charge diffusion in the regime of\nstrong particle-particle interactions. Moreover, we demonstrate that this\ndiffusive behavior does not depend on certain details of our initial\nconditions, i.e., it occurs for five different realizations with random and\nnonrandom internal degrees of freedom, single and double occupation of the\ncentral site, and displacement of spin-up and spin-down particles.\n", "  It is generally believed that, when a linguistic item acquires a new meaning,\nits overall frequency of use in the language rises with time with an S-shaped\ngrowth curve. Yet, this claim has only been supported by a limited number of\ncase studies. In this paper, we provide the first corpus-based quantitative\nconfirmation of the genericity of the S-curve in language change. Moreover, we\nuncover another generic pattern, a latency phase of variable duration preceding\nthe S-growth, during which the frequency of use of the semantically expanding\nword remains low and more or less constant. We also propose a usage-based model\nof language change supported by cognitive considerations, which predicts that\nboth phases, the latency and the fast S-growth, take place. The driving\nmechanism is a stochastic dynamics, a random walk in the space of frequency of\nuse. The underlying deterministic dynamics highlights the role of a control\nparameter, the strength of the cognitive impetus governing the onset of change,\nwhich tunes the system at the vicinity of a saddle-node bifurcation. In the\nneighborhood of the critical point, the latency phase corresponds to the\ndiffusion time over the critical region, and the S-growth to the fast\nconvergence that follows. The duration of the two phases is computed as\nspecific first passage times of the random walk process, leading to\ndistributions that fit well the ones extracted from our dataset. We argue that\nour results are not specific to the studied corpus, but apply to semantic\nchange in general.\n", "  The $B^0$, $B^0_s$, $B^+$ and $\\Lambda^0_b$ hadron production asymmetries are\nmeasured using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0\nfb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment in proton-proton collisions at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The measurements are performed as a\nfunction of transverse momentum and rapidity of the $b$ hadrons within the LHCb\ndetector acceptance. The overall production asymmetries, integrated over\ntransverse momentum and rapidity, are also determined.\n", "  The evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas in structured populations has\nbeen studied extensively in recent years. Whereas many theoretical studies have\nfound that a heterogeneous network of contacts favors cooperation, the impact\nof spatial effects in scale-free networks is still not well understood. In\naddition to being heterogeneous, real contact networks exhibit a high mean\nlocal clustering coefficient, which implies the existence of an underlying\nmetric space. Here, we show that evolutionary dynamics in scale-free networks\nself-organize into spatial patterns in the underlying metric space. The\nresulting metric clusters of cooperators are able to survive in social dilemmas\nas their spatial organization shields them from surrounding defectors, similar\nto spatial selection in Euclidean space. We show that under certain conditions\nthese metric clusters are more efficient than the most connected nodes at\nsustaining cooperation and that heterogeneity does not always favor--but can\neven hinder--cooperation in social dilemmas. Our findings provide a new\nperspective to understand the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary games in\nrealistic structured populations.\n", "  At air-water interfaces, the Lifshitz interaction by itself does not promote\nice growth. On the contrary, we find that the Lifshitz force promotes the\ngrowth of an ice film, up to 1-8 nm thickness, near silica-water interfaces at\nthe triple point of water. This is achieved in a system where the combined\neffect of the retardation and the zero frequency mode influences the\nshort-range interactions at low temperatures, contrary to common understanding.\nCancellation between the positive and negative contributions in the Lifshitz\nspectral function is reversed in silica with high porosity. Our results provide\na model for how water freezes on glass and other surfaces.\n", "  We consider photon heralding with quasi-number-resolving detection schemes\nand account for detection efficiencies and dark count probabilities. With a\nstraightforward formalism, we develop closed-form expressions for the heralding\nprobability, photon number distribution of the resulting heralded state, and\nfidelity of this heralded state to a single photon state. We calculate that, on\nthe basis of optimizing this fidelity, due to the presence of dark counts there\nis a maximum number of detection modes worth multiplexing for each combination\nof efficiency and dark count probability.\n", "  We introduce a new type of states for light in multimode waveguides featuring\nstrongly enhanced or reduced spectral correlations. Based on the experimentally\nmeasured multi-spectral transmission matrix of a multimode fiber, we generate a\nset of states that outperform the established \"principal modes\" in terms of the\nspectral stability of their output spatial field profiles. Inverting this\nconcept also allows us to create states with a minimal spectral correlation\nwidth, whose output profiles are considerably more sensitive to a frequency\nchange than typical input wavefronts. The resulting \"super-\" and\n\"anti-principal\" modes are made orthogonal to each other even in the presence\nof mode-dependent loss. By decomposing them in the principal mode basis, we\nshow that the super-principal modes are formed via interference of principal\nmodes with closeby delay times, whereas the anti-principal modes are a\nsuperposition of principal modes with the most different delay times available\nin the fiber. Such novel states are expected to have broad applications in\nfiber communication, imaging, and spectroscopy.\n", "  In this paper, we present the computation of the Higgs boson pair production\ncross section, both inclusive as well as differential on the invariant mass\ndistribution, at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD including effects\nof new physics beyond the standard model. We parametrize the effects of new\nphysics with the relevant dimension 6 operators in a standard model effective\nfield theory (EFT) approach and examine their phenomenology. The dependence of\nthe NNLO $K$-factor on the EFT couplings is analysed, finding that, while\nrather flat for a number of EFT coefficients, it can considerably differ from\nthe standard model value in some particular regions of the parameter space. We\npresent explicit examples of (almost) degeneracy in the NNLO cross-section with\nrespect to the anomalous couplings, showing that the invariant mass\ndistribution has a much larger sensitivity to phenomena beyond the standard\nmodel and can be used as a tool to discriminate their effect.\n", "  Precession and relaxation predominantly characterize the real-time dynamics\nof a spin driven by a magnetic field and coupled to a large Fermi sea of\nconduction electrons. We demonstrate an anomalous precession with frequency\nhigher than the Larmor frequency or with inverted orientation in the limit\nwhere the electronic motion adiabatically follows the spin dynamics. For a\nclassical spin, the effect is traced back to a geometrical torque resulting\nfrom a finite spin Berry curvature.\n", "  We present the results of a linear optics photonic implementation of a\nquantum circuit that simulates a phase covariant cloner, by using two different\ndegrees of freedom of a single photon. We experimentally simulate the action of\ntwo mirrored $1\\rightarrow 2$ cloners, each of them biasing the cloned states\ninto opposite regions of the Bloch sphere. We show that by applying a random\nsequence of these two cloners, an eavesdropper can mitigate the amount of noise\nadded to the original input state and therefore prepare clones with no bias but\nwith the same individual fidelity, masking its presence in a quantum key\ndistribution protocol. Input polarization qubit states are cloned into path\nqubit states of the same photon, which is identified as a potential\neavesdropper in a quantum key distribution protocol. The device has the\nflexibility to produce mirrored versions that optimally clone states on either\nthe northern or southern hemispheres of the Bloch sphere, as well as to\nsimulate optimal and non-optimal cloning machines by tuning the asymmetry on\neach of the cloning machines.\n", "  When an object moves faster than emissions it creates, it may appear at two\npositions simultaneously. The appearance or disappearance of this bifurcation\nis referred to as a pair event. Inherently convolved with superluminal motion,\npair events have no subluminal counterparts. Common examples of superluminal\nmotions that exhibit pair events include Cherenkov radiation, sonic booms,\nillumination fronts from variable light sources, and rotating beams. The\nminimally simple case of pair events from a single massive object is explored\nhere: uniform linear motion. A pair event is perceived when the radial\ncomponent of the object's speed toward the observer drops from superluminal to\nsubluminal. Emission from the pair creation event will reach the observer\nbefore emission from either of the two images created. Potentially observable\nimage pair events are described for sonic booms and Cherenkov light. To date,\nno detection of discrete images following a projectile pair event have ever\nbeen reported, and so the pair event nature of sonic booms and Cherenkov\nradiation, for example, remains unconfirmed. Recent advances in modern\ntechnology have made such pair event tracking feasible. If measured, pair\nevents could provide important information about object distance and history.\n", "  Beside the spin density wave (SDW) order inside the superconducting phase in\n$\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ at high magnetic fields, recent neutron scattering\nmeasurements have found Bragg peaks in $5\\%$ Nd doped $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$ at\nlow fields. The intensity of Bragg peaks in low fields is suppressed by\nincreasing field. Based on the phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we\nshow that for the Pauli limited $d$-wave superconductors in the vicinity of SDW\ninstability relevant for $\\mathrm{CeCoIn_5}$, magnetic impurities locally\ninduce droplets of SDW order. Because of the strong anisotropy in the momentum\nspace in the spin fluctuations guaranteed by the $d$-wave pairing symmetry,\nsharp peaks in spin structure factor at $\\mathbf{Q}$s are produced by the\nimpurities, even when the droplets of SDW do not order. At zero field, the Nd\nimpurity spins are along the $c$ axis due to the coupling to the conduction\nelectrons with an easy $c$ axis, besides their own crystal field effect. The\nin-plane magnetic field cants the impurity moments toward the $ab$ plane, which\nsuppress the droplets of SDW order. At high fields, the long-range SDW inside\nthe superconducting phase is stabilized as a consequence of magnon\ncondensation. Our results are consistent with the recent neutron scattering and\nthermal conductivity measurements.\n", "  The cosmological constraining power of modern galaxy cluster catalogs can be\nimproved by obtaining low-scatter mass proxy measurements for even a small\nfraction of sources. In the context of large upcoming surveys that will reveal\nthe cluster population down to the group scale and out to high redshifts,\nefficient strategies for obtaining such mass proxies will be valuable. In this\nwork, we use high-quality weak lensing and X-ray mass estimates for massive\nclusters in current X-ray selected catalogs to revisit the scaling relations of\nthe projected, center-excised X-ray luminosity ($L_{ce}$), which previous work\nsuggests correlates tightly with total mass. Our data confirm that this is the\ncase, with $L_{ce}$ having an intrinsic scatter at fixed mass comparable to\nthat of gas mass, temperature or $Y_X$. Compared to these other proxies,\nhowever, $L_{ce}$ is less susceptible to systematic uncertainties due to\nbackground modeling, and can be measured precisely with shorter exposures. This\nopens up the possibility of using $L_{ce}$ to estimate masses for large numbers\nof clusters discovered by new X-ray surveys (e.g. eROSITA) directly from the\nsurvey data, as well as for clusters discovered at other wavelengths, with\nrelatively short follow-up observations. We describe a simple procedure for\nmaking such estimates from X-ray surface brightness data, and comment on the\nspatial resolution required to apply this method as a function of cluster mass\nand redshift. We also explore the potential impact of Chandra and XMM-Newton\nfollow-up observations over the next decade on dark energy constraints from new\ncluster surveys.\n", "  Defects in silicon carbide (SiC) have emerged as a favorable platform for\noptically-active spin-based quantum technologies. Spin qubits exist in specific\ncharge states of these defects, where the ability to control these states can\nprovide enhanced spin-dependent readout and long-term charge stability of the\nqubits. We investigate this charge state control for two major spin qubits in\n4H-SiC, the divacancy (VV) and silicon vacancy (Vsi), obtaining bidirectional\noptical charge conversion between the bright and dark states of these defects.\nWe measure increased photoluminescence from VV ensembles by up to three orders\nof magnitude using near-ultraviolet excitation, depending on the substrate, and\nwithout degrading the electron spin coherence time. This charge conversion\nremains stable for hours at cryogenic temperatures, allowing spatial and\npersistent patterning of the relative charge state populations. We develop a\ncomprehensive model of the defects and optical processes involved, offering a\nstrong basis to improve material design and to develop quantum applications in\nSiC.\n", "  A new heuristic model of interaction of an atomic system with a gravitational\nwave is proposed. In it, the gravitational wave alters the local\nelectromagnetic field of the atomic nucleus, as perceived by the electron,\nwhich changes the energy of the system. The spectral decomposition of the wave\nfunction is calculated, from which the energy of the system can be obtained.\nThe results suggest a shift in the energy difference of the atomic energy\nlevels, which will induce a small detuning to any given resonant transition.\nThe detuning increases with the quantum numbers of the levels, making the\neffect more prominent for Rydberg states. We performed calculations on the Rabi\noscillations of atomic transitions, estimating how they would vary as a result\nof the proposed effect.\n", "  We propose to constrain the gluon Wigner distribution in the nucleon by\nstudying the exclusive diffractive dijet production process in ultraperipheral\nproton-nucleus collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. Compared to the previous\nproposal in Ref. [Y. Hatta, B. W. Xiao, and F. Yuan, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,\n202301 (2016).] to study the same observable in lepton-nucleon scattering, the\nuse of UPCs has a few advantages: not only is the cross section larger, but the\nextraction of the Wigner distribution from the data also becomes simpler,\nincluding its elliptic angular dependence. We compute the corresponding cross\nsection and evaluate the coefficients using models which include the gluon\nsaturation effects. A potential for the measurements of the Wigner distribution\nat current and future experimental facilities is also discussed.\n", "  The partitioning of small molecules in cell membranes---a key parameter for\npharmaceutical applications---typically relies on experimentally-available bulk\npartitioning coefficients. Computer simulations provide a structural resolution\nof the insertion thermodynamics via the potential of mean force, but require\nsignificant sampling at the atomistic level. Here, we introduce high-throughput\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to screen thermodynamic\nproperties. This application of physics based models in a large-scale study of\nsmall molecules establishes linear relationships between partitioning\ncoefficients and key features of the potential of mean force. This allows us to\npredict the structure of the insertion from bulk experimental measurements for\nmore than 400,000 compounds. The potential of mean force hereby becomes an\neasily accessible quantity---already recognized for its high predictability of\ncertain properties, e.g., passive permeation. Further, we demonstrate how\ncoarse graining helps reduce the size of chemical space, enabling a\nhierarchical approach to screening small molecules.\n", "  A compact multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna with very high\nisolation is proposed for ultrawide-band (UWB) applications. The antenna with a\ncompact size of 30.1x20.5 mm^2 (0.31${\\lambda}_0$ x0.21${\\lambda}_0$ ) consists\nof two planar-monopole antenna elements. It is found that isolation of more\nthan 25 dB can be achieved between two parallel monopole antenna elements. For\nthe low-frequency isolation, an efficient technique of bending the feed-line\nand applying a new protruded ground is introduced. To increase isolation, a\ndesign based on suppressing surface wave, near-field, and far-field coupling is\napplied. The simulation and measurement results of the proposed antenna with\nthe good agreement are presented and show a bandwidth with S 11 < -10 dB, S 12\n< -25 dB ranged from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz making the proposed antenna a good\ncandidate for UWB MIMO systems.\n", "  In this paper we propose (0,2) mirrors for general Fano toric varieties with\nspecial tangent bundle deformations, corresponding to subsets of toric\ndeformations. Our mirrors are of the form of (B/2-twisted) (0,2)\nLandau-Ginzburg models, matching Hori-Vafa mirrors on the (2,2) locus. We\ncompare our predictions to (0,2) mirrors obtained by Chen et al for certain\nexamples of toric varieties, and find that they match. We also briefly outline\nconjectures for analogous results for hypersurfaces in Fano toric varieties.\nOur methods utilize results from supersymmetric localization, which allows us\nto incidentally gain occasional further insights into GLSM-based (2,2) mirror\nconstructions. For example, we explicitly verify that closed-string correlation\nfunctions of the original A-twisted GLSM match those of the mirror B-twisted\nLandau-Ginzburg model, as well as (0,2) deformations thereof.\n", "  Nonlocal effects have been shown to be responsible for a variety of\nnon-trivial optical effects in small-size plasmonic nanoparticles, beyond\nclassical electrodynamics. However, it is not clear whether optical mode\ndescriptions can be applied to such extreme confinement regimes. Here, we\npresent a powerful and intuitive quasinormal mode description of the nonlocal\noptical response for three-dimensional plasmonic nanoresonators. The nonlocal\nhydrodynamical model and a generalized nonlocal optical response model for\nplasmonic nanoresonators are used to construct an intuitive modal theory and to\ncompare to the local Drude model response theory. Using the example of a gold\nnanorod, we show how an efficient quasinormal mode picture is able to\naccurately capture the blueshift of the resonances, the higher damping rates in\nplasmonic nanoresonators, and the modified spatial profile of the plasmon\nquasinormal modes, even at the single mode level. We exemplify the use of this\ntheory by calculating the Purcell factors of single quantum emitters, the\nelectron energy-loss spectroscopy spatial maps, as well as the Mollow triplet\nspectra of field-driven quantum dots with and without nonlocal effects for\ndifferent size nanoresonators. Our nonlocal quasinormal mode theory offers a\nreliable and efficient technique to study both classical and quantum optical\nproblems in nanoplasmonics.\n", "  The Bell basis is a distinctive set of maximally entangled two-particle\nquantum states that forms the foundation for many quantum protocols such as\nteleportation, dense coding and entanglement swapping. While the generation,\nmanipulation, and measurement of two-level quantum states is well understood,\nthe same is not true in higher dimensions. Here we present the experimental\ngeneration of a complete set of Bell states in a four-dimensional Hilbert\nspace, comprising of 16 orthogonal entangled Bell-like states encoded in the\norbital angular momentum of photons. The states are created by the application\nof generalized high-dimensional Pauli gates on an initial entangled state. Our\nresults pave the way for the application of high-dimensional quantum states in\ncomplex quantum protocols such as quantum dense coding.\n", "  We study the Friedmann inflation in general covariant Horava-Lifshitz (HL)\ngravity without the projectability conditions and with detailed and\nnon-detailed balance conditions. Accordingly, we derive modifications in the\nFriedmann equations due to a single-scalar field potential describing\nminimal-supersymmetrically extended inflation. By implementing two\ntime-independent equations of state (EoS) characterizing the cosmic background\ngeometry filled up with dark energy, the dependence of the tensorial and scalar\ndensity fluctuations and their ratios on the inflation field are determined.\nThe latter refer to the time evolution of the inflationary field relative to\nthe Hubble parameter. Furthermore, the ratios of tensorial-to-spectral density\nfluctuations are calculated in dependence on the spectral index. For cold dark\nenergy EoS $\\omega=-1/3$, we find that the tensorial-to-spectral density\nfluctuations are not depending on the different theories of gravity and the\nresults are very small relative to the recent BICEP2/Keck Array-Planck\nobservations, $10^{-9} \\lessapprox r \\lessapprox 10^{-3}$. We have also\ncalculated the tensorial and scalar perturbations of the primordial spectra.\n", "  The particle size (D) dependence of the effective magnetic anisotropy Keff of\nmagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) usually shows Keff increasing with decreasing D.\nThis dependence is often interpreted using the Eq.: Keff = Kb + (6Ks/D) where\nKb and Ks are the anisotropy constants of the spins in the bulk-like core and\nsurface layer, respectively. Here, we show that this model is inadequate to\nexplain the observed size-dependency of Keff for smaller nanoparticles with D <\n5 nm. Instead the results in NPs of maghemite ({\\gamma}-Fe2O3), NiO and Ni are\nbest described by an extension of the above model leading to the variation\ngiven by Keff = Kb + (6Ks/D) +Ksh{[1-(2d/D)]^(-3) -1}, where the last term is\ndue to the spins in a shell of thickness d with anisotropy Ksh. The validation\nof this core-shell-surface layer (CSSL) model for three different magnetic NPs\nsystems viz. ferrimagnetic {\\gamma}-Fe2O3, ferromagnetic Ni and\nantiferromagnetic NiO suggests its possible applicability for all magnetic\nnanoparticles.\n", "  Recent Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments [M. Giustina et al. Phys.\nRev. Lett. 115, 250401 (2015); L. K. Shalm et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 250402\n(2015)] that claim to be loophole free are scrutinized and are shown to suffer\na photon identification loophole. The combination of a digital computer and\ndiscrete-event simulation is used to construct a minimal but faithful model of\nthe most perfected realization of these laboratory experiments. In contrast to\nprior simulations, all photon selections are strictly made, as they are in the\nactual experiments, at the local station and no other \"post-selection\" is\ninvolved. The simulation results demonstrate that a manifestly non-quantum\nmodel that identifies photons in the same local manner as in these experiments\ncan produce correlations that are in excellent agreement with those of the\nquantum theoretical description of the corresponding thought experiment, in\nconflict with Bell's theorem. The failure of Bell's theorem is possible because\nof our recognition of the photon identification loophole. Such identification\nmeasurement-procedures are necessarily included in all actual experiments but\nare not included in the theory of Bell and his followers.\n", "  We establish the existence of `time quasicrystals', tilings of the time axis\nwith two unit cells of different duration. These aperiodic tilings can be\nconstructed as slices through regular tilings of a space spanned by two\northogonal time directions. We establish the result rigorously using the tools\nof symbolic dynamics. We show that, of the ten physically-relevant classes of\none-dimensional quasicrystal, precisely two can appear as stable, attracting\ntrajectories in dynamical systems, which we term the infinite Pell and\nClapeyron words. These grow, via a generalization of the period-doubling\ncascade, as a sequence of stable orbits with periods increasing as the Pell and\nClapeyron numbers, providing systematic approximations which can be\nexperimentally implemented. The results apply to a wide universality class of\ndissipative nonlinear systems: we consider discrete-time maps, and\ncontinuous-time dynamical systems, both autonomous and periodically driven.\nThis Paper proves and extends the results of a companion Letter, as well as\nproviding a pedagogical background.\n", "  An 't Hooft anomaly is the obstruction for gauging symmetries, and it\nconstrains possible low-energy behaviors of quantum field theories by excluding\ntrivial infrared theories. Global inconsistency condition is recently proposed\nas a milder condition but is expected to play an almost same role by comparing\nhigh symmetry points in the theory space. In order to clarify the consequence\ncoming from this new condition, we discuss several quantum mechanical models\nwith topological angles and explicitly compute their energy spectra. It turns\nout that the global inconsistency can be saturated not only by the ground-state\ndegeneracy at either of high symmetry points but also by the level crossing\n(phase transition) separating those high symmetry points.\n", "  This letter considers stellar core collapse in massive scalar--tensor\ntheories of gravity. The presence of a mass term for the scalar field allows\nfor dramatic increases in the radiated gravitational wave signal. There are\nseveral potential smoking gun signatures of a departure from general relativity\nassociated with this process. These signatures could show up within existing\nLIGO--Virgo searches.\n", "  We study physical consequences of adding orientifolds to the ABJ triality,\nwhich is among 3d N=6 superconformal Chern-Simons theory known as ABJ theory,\ntype IIA string in AdS_4 x CP^3 and N=6 supersymmetric (SUSY) Vasiliev higher\nspin theory in AdS_4. After adding the orientifolds, it is known that the gauge\ngroup of the ABJ theory becomes O(N_1)xUSp(2N_2) while the background of the\nstring theory is replaced by AdS_4 x CP^3/Z_2, and the supersymmetries in the\nboth theories reduce to N=5. We propose that adding the orientifolds to the N=6\nVasiliev theory leads to N=5 SUSY Vasiliev theory. It turns out that the N=5\ncase is more involved because there are two formulations of the N=5 Vasiliev\ntheory with either O or USp internal symmetry. We show that the two N=5\nVasiliev theories can be understood as certain projections of the N=6 Vasiliev\ntheory, which we identify with the orientifold projections in the Vasiliev\ntheory. We conjecture that the O(N_1)xUSp(2N_2) ABJ theory has the two vector\nmodel like limits: N_2 >> N_1 and N_1 >> N_2 which correspond to the\nsemi-classical N=5 Vasiliev theories with O(N_1) and USp(2N_2) internal\nsymmetries respectively. These correspondences together with the standard\nAdS/CFT correspondence comprise the ABJ quadrality among the N=5 ABJ theory,\nstring/M-theory and two N=5 Vasliev theories. We provide a precise holographic\ndictionary for the correspondences by comparing correlation functions of stress\ntensor and flavor currents. Our conjecture is supported by various evidence\nsuch as agreements of the spectra, one-loop free energies and SUSY enhancement\non the both sides. We also predict the leading free energy of the N=5 Vasiliev\ntheory from the CFT side. As a byproduct, we give a derivation of the relation\nbetween the parity violating phase in the N=6 Vasiliev theory and the\nparameters in the N=6 ABJ theory, which was conjectured in arXiv:1207.4485.\n", "  xFitter is an open-source package that provides a framework for the\ndetermination of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton for\nmany different kinds of analyses in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). xFitter\nversion 2.0.0 has recently been released, and offers an expanded set of tools\nand options. It incorporates experimental data from a wide range of experiments\nincluding fixed-target, Tevatron, HERA, and LHC. xFitter can analyze this data\nup to next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in perturbation theory with a\nvariety of theoretical calculations including numerous methodological options\nfor carrying out PDF fits and plotting tools which help visualize the results.\nWhile primarily based on the collinear factorization foundation, xFitter also\nprovides facilities for fits of dipole models and transverse-momentum dependent\n(TMD) PDFs. The package can be used to study the impact of new precise\nmeasurements from hadron colliders, and also assess the impact of future\ncolliders. This paper provides a brief overview of xFitter with emphasis of the\nnew version 2.0.0 features.\n", "  We propose a spin valve device based on the interplay of a modulated\nspin-orbit interaction and a uniform external magnetic field acting on a\nquantum wire. Half-metal phases, where electrons with only a selected spin\npolarization exhibit ballistic conductance, can be tuned by varying the\nmagnetic field. These half-metal phases are proven to be robust against\nelectron-electron repulsive interactions. Our results arise from a combination\nof explicit band diagonalization, bosonization techniques and extensive DMRG\ncomputations.\n", "  In the large $N_c$ limit both heavy and light baryons are described by the\nuniversal mean field, which allows us to relate the properties of heavy baryons\nto light ones. With the only input from the decays of light octet baryons (due\nto the universality of the chiral mean field), excellent description of strong\ndecays of both charm and bottom sextets is obtained. The parameter-free\nprediction for the widths of exotic anti-decapentaplet\n($\\overline{\\boldsymbol{15}}$) baryons is also made. The exotic heavy baryons\nshould be anomalously narrow despite of large phase space available. In\nparticular, the widths of $\\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\\Omega_c(3119)$, interpreted as\nmembers of $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{15}}$-plet, are very small: 0.48~MeV and\n1.12~MeV respectivly. This result is in very good agreement with the\nmeasurements of the LHCb Collaboration and provides natural and parameter free\nexplanation of the LHCb observation that $\\Omega_c(3050)$ and $\\Omega_c(3119)$\nhave anomalously small widths among five recently observed states.\n", "  A model in which a three-dimensional elastic medium is represented by a\nnetwork of identical masses connected by springs of random strengths and\nallowed to vibrate only along a selected axis of the reference frame, exhibits\nan Anderson localization transition. To study this transition, we assume that\nthe dynamical matrix of the network is given by a product of a sparse random\nmatrix with real, independent, Gaussian-distributed non-zero entries and its\ntranspose. A finite-time scaling analysis of system's response to an initial\nexcitation allows us to estimate the critical parameters of the localization\ntransition. The critical exponent is found to be $\\nu = 1.57 \\pm 0.02$ in\nagreement with previous studies of Anderson transition belonging to the\nthree-dimensional orthogonal universality class.\n", "  In the model of gate-based quantum computation, the qubits are controlled by\na sequence of quantum gates. In superconducting qubit systems, these gates can\nbe implemented by voltage pulses. The success of implementing a particular gate\ncan be expressed by various metrics such as the average gate fidelity, the\ndiamond distance, and the unitarity. We analyze these metrics of gate pulses\nfor a system of two superconducting transmon qubits coupled by a resonator, a\nsystem inspired by the architecture of the IBM Quantum Experience. The metrics\nare obtained by numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nof the transmon system. We find that the metrics reflect systematic errors that\nare most pronounced for echoed cross-resonance gates, but that none of the\nstudied metrics can reliably predict the performance of a gate when used\nrepeatedly in a quantum algorithm.\n", "  The pseudoscalar correlator is an ideal lattice probe for thermal\nmodifications to quarkonium spectra, given that it is not compromised by a\ncontribution from a large transport peak. We construct a perturbative spectral\nfunction incorporating resummed thermal effects around the threshold and vacuum\nasymptotics above the threshold, and compare the corresponding imaginary-time\ncorrelators with continuum-extrapolated lattice data for quenched SU(3) at\nseveral temperatures. Modest differences are observed, which may originate from\nnon-perturbative mass shifts or renormalization factors, however no resonance\npeaks are needed for describing the quenched lattice data for charmonium at and\nabove T ~ 1.1Tc ~ 350 MeV. For comparison, in the bottomonium case a good\ndescription of the lattice data is obtained with a spectral function containing\na single thermally broadened resonance peak.\n", "  An optical vortex is a light wave with a twisting wavefront around its\npropagation axis and null intensity in the beam center. Its unique spatial\nstructure of field lends itself to a broad range of applications, including\noptical communication, quantum information, superresolution microscopy, and\nmulti-dimensional manipulation of particles. However, accessible intensity of\noptical vortices have been limited to material ionization threshold. This\nlimitation might be removed by using the plasma medium. Here we propose the\ndesign of suitably magnetized plasmas which, functioning as a q-plate, leads to\na direct convertion from a high-intensity Gaussian beam into a twisted beam. A\ncircularly polarized laser beam in the plasma accumulates an\nazimuthal-angle-dependent phase shift and hence forms a twisting wavefront. Our\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate extremely high power\nconversion efficiency. The plasma q-plate can work in a large range of\nfrequencies spanning from terahertz to the optical domain.\n", "  We develop a formalism suitable for studying Maxwell's equations in the\npresence of a medium that is axially symmetric, in particular with respect to\nCasimir-Polder interaction energies. As an application, we derive the\nCasimir-Polder interaction energy between an electric $\\delta$-function plate\nand an anisotropically polarizable molecule for arbitrary orientations of the\nprincipal axes of polarizabilities of the molecule. We show that in the perfect\nconductor limit for the plate the interaction is insensitive to the orientation\nof the polarizabilities of the molecule. We obtain the Casimir-Polder energy\nbetween an electric $\\delta$-function sphere and an anisotropically polarizable\nmolecule, again for arbitrary orientations of the principal axes of\npolarizabilities of the molecule. We derive results when the polarizable\nmolecule is either outside the sphere, or inside the sphere. We present the\nperfectly conducting limit for the $\\delta$-function sphere, and also the\ninteraction energy for the special case when the molecule is at the center of\nthe sphere. Our general proposition is that the Casimir-Polder energy between a\ndielectric body with axial symmetry and an unidirectionally polarizable\nmolecule placed on the axis with its polarizability parallel to the axis gets\nnon-zero contribution only from the $m=0$ azimuth mode. This feature in\nconjunction with the property that the $m=0$ mode separates into transverse\nelectric and transverse magnetic modes allows the evaluation of Casimir-Polder\nenergies for axially symmetric systems in a relatively easy manner.\n", "  We present our observations of the optical intra-day variability (IDV) in\n$\\gamma$-ray BL Lac object Mrk 501. The observations were run with the 1.02 m\nand 2.4 m optical telescopes at Yunnan Observatories from 2005 April to 2012\nMay. The light curve at the $R$ band on 2010 May 15 passes both variability\ntests (the $F$ test and the ANOVA test). A flare within the light curve on 2010\nMay 15 has a magnitude change $\\Delta m = 0.03 \\pm 0.005_{\\rm{stat}} \\pm\n0.007_{\\rm{sys}}$ mag, \\textbf{a darkening timescale of $\\tau_{\\rm{d}}=$ 26.7\nminutes}, and an amplitude of IDV $Amp=2.9\\% \\pm0.7\\%$. A decline\n\\textbf{described by 11 consecutive flux measurements} within the flare can be\nfitted linearly with a Pearson's correlation coefficient $r = 0.945$ at the\nconfidence level of $> 99.99\\%$. Under the assumptions that the IDV is tightly\nconnected to the mass of the black hole, \\textbf{and that the flare duration,\nbeing two times $\\tau_{\\rm{d}}$, is representative of the minimum\ncharacteristic timescale, we can derive upper bounds to the mass of the black\nhole}. In the case of the Kerr black hole, the timescale of $\\Delta\nt_{\\rm{min}}^{\\rm{ob}}=$ 0.89 hours gives $M_{\\bullet}\\la 10^{9.20} M_{\\odot}$,\nwhich is consistent with measurements reported in the literature. This\nagreement indicates that the hypothesis about $M_{\\bullet}$ and $\\Delta\nt_{\\rm{min}}^{\\rm{ob}}$ is consistent with the measurements/data.\n", "  We study the interaction-modulated tunneling dynamics of a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) in a deep double-well potential, where the tunneling between\nthe two wells is modulated by another BEC trapped in a harmonic potential\nsymmetrically positioned at the center of the double-well potential. The\ninter-species interactions couple the dynamics of the two BECs, which give rise\nto interesting features in the tunneling oscillations. Adopting a two-mode\napproximation for the BEC in the double-well potential and coupling it with the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation of the harmonically trapped BEC, we numerically\ninvestigate the coupled dynamics of the BEC mixture, and map out the phase\ndiagram of the tunneling dynamics. We show that the dynamical back action of\nthe BEC in the harmonic trap leads to strong non-linearity in the oscillations\nof the BEC in the double-well potential, which enriches the system dynamics,\nand enhances macroscopic self trapping. The transition between the Josephson\noscillation and the self-trapping dynamics can be identified by monitoring the\noscillation frequency of the double-well BEC. Our results suggest the\npossibility of tuning the tunneling dynamics of BECs in double-well potentials.\n", "  A neutron imaging detector based on neutron-sensitive microchannel plates\n(MCPs) was constructed and tested at beamlines of thermal and cold neutrons.\nThe MCPs are made of a glass mixture containing B-10 and natural Gd, which\nmakes the bulk of the MCP an efficient neutron converter. Contrary to the\nneutron sensitive scintillator screens normally used in neutron imaging,\nspatial resolution is not traded off with detection efficiency. While the best\nneutron imaging scintillators have a detection efficiency around a percent, a\ndetection efficiency of around 50% for thermal neutrons and 70% for cold\nneutrons has been demonstrated with these MCPs earlier.\n  Our tests show a performance similar to conventional neutron imaging\ndetectors, apart from the orders of magnitude better sensitivity. We\ndemonstrate a spatial resolution better than 150 um. The sensitivity of this\ndetector allows fast tomography and neutron video recording, and will make\nsmaller reactor sites and even portable sources suitable for neutron imaging.\n", "  Observations show that massive star formation quenches first at centers of\ngalaxies. To understand quenching mechanisms, we investigate the thermal and\nnonthermal energy balance in the central kpc of NGC1097- a prototypical galaxy\nundergoing quenching- and present a systematic study of the nuclear star\nformation efficiency and its dependencies. This region is dominated by the\nnonthermal pressure from the magnetic field, cosmic rays, and turbulence. A\ncomparison of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio of the molecular clouds shows\nthat most of them are magnetically critical or supported against gravitational\ncollapse needed to form cores of massive stars. Moreover, the star formation\nefficiency of the clouds drops with the magnetic field strength. Such an\nanti-correlation holds with neither the turbulent nor the thermal pressure.\nHence, a progressive built up of the magnetic field results in high-mass stars\nforming inefficiently, and it may be the cause of the low-mass stellar\npopulation in the bulges of galaxies.\n", "  On 2017 August 17 the merger of two compact objects with masses consistent\nwith two neutron stars was discovered through gravitational-wave (GW170817),\ngamma-ray (GRB 170817A), and optical (SSS17a/AT 2017gfo) observations. The\noptical source was associated with the early-type galaxy NGC 4993 at a distance\nof just $\\sim$40 Mpc, consistent with the gravitational-wave measurement, and\nthe merger was localized to be at a projected distance of $\\sim$2 kpc away from\nthe galaxy's center. We use this minimal set of facts and the mass posteriors\nof the two neutron stars to derive the first constraints on the progenitor of\nGW170817 at the time of the second supernova (SN). We generate simulated\nprogenitor populations and follow the three-dimensional kinematic evolution\nfrom the binary neutron star (BNS) birth to the merger time, accounting for\npre-SN galactic motion, for considerably different input distributions of the\nprogenitor mass, pre-SN semimajor axis, and SN-kick velocity. Though not\nconsiderably tight, we find these constraints to be comparable to those for\nGalactic BNS progenitors. The derived constraints are very strongly influenced\nby the requirement of keeping the binary bound after the second SN and having\nthe merger occur relatively close to the center of the galaxy. These\nconstraints are insensitive to the galaxy's star formation history, provided\nthe stellar populations are older than 1 Gyr.\n", "  This paper answers Bell's question: What does quantum information refer to?\nIt is about quantum properties represented by subspaces of the quantum Hilbert\nspace, or their projectors, to which standard (Kolmogorov) probabilities can be\nassigned by using a projective decomposition of the identity (PDI or framework)\nas a quantum sample space. The single framework rule of consistent histories\nprevents paradoxes or contradictions. When only one framework is employed,\nclassical (Shannon) information theory can be imported unchanged into the\nquantum domain. A particular case is the macroscopic world of classical physics\nwhose quantum description needs only a single quasiclassical framework.\nNontrivial issues unique to quantum information, those with no classical\nanalog, arise when aspects of two or more incompatible frameworks are compared.\n", "  We study the penetration of ultraintense circularly polarized laser pulses\ninto a thick subcritical plasma layer with accounting for radiation friction.\nWe show that radiation pressure is enhanced by radiation friction in the\ndirection transverse to the laser pulse propagation, and that for stronger and\nlonger laser pulses this mechanism dominates over the ordinary ponderomotive\npressure, thus resulting in a stronger charge separation than anticipated\npreviously. We give estimates of the effect and compare them with the results\nof 1D and 2D PIC simulations.\n", "  We consider the dynamics of overdamped MEMS devices undergoing the pull-in\ninstability. Numerous previous experiments and numerical simulations have shown\na significant increase in the pull-in time under DC voltages close to the\npull-in voltage. Here the transient dynamics slow down as the device passes\nthrough a meta-stable or bottleneck phase, but this slowing down is not well\nunderstood quantitatively. Using a lumped parallel-plate model, we perform a\ndetailed analysis of the pull-in dynamics in this regime. We show that the\nbottleneck phenomenon is a type of critical slowing down arising from the\npull-in transition. This allows us to show that the pull-in time obeys an\ninverse square-root scaling law as the transition is approached; moreover we\ndetermine an analytical expression for this pull-in time. We then compare our\nprediction to a wide range of pull-in time data reported in the literature,\nshowing that the observed slowing down is well captured by our scaling law,\nwhich appears to be generic for overdamped pull-in under DC loads. This\nrealization provides a useful design rule with which to tune dynamic response\nin applications, including state-of-the-art accelerometers and pressure sensors\nthat use pull-in time as a sensing mechanism. We also propose a method to\nestimate the pull-in voltage based only on data of the pull-in times.\n", "  I use recent observational and theoretical studies of type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa) to further constrain the viable SN Ia scenarios and to argue that there\nmust be a substantial time delay between the end of the merger of the white\ndwarf (WD) with a companion or the end of mass accretion on to the WD and its\nterminal explosion. This merger/accretion to explosion delay (MED) is required\nto allow the binary system to lead to a more or less spherical explosion and to\nprevent a pre-explosion ionizing radiation. Considering these recent results\nand the required MED, I conclude that the core degenerate scenario is somewhat\nmore favorable over the other scenarios, followed by the double degenerate\nscenario. Although the single degenerate scenario is viable as well, it is less\nlikely to account for common (normal) SN Ia. As all scenarios require\nsubstantial MED, the MED has turned from a disadvantage of the core degenerate\nscenario to a challenge that theory should overcome. I hope that the\nrequirement for a MED will stimulate the discussion of the different SN Ia\nscenarios and the comparison of the scenarios to each other.\n", "  In this paper, we introduce the stationary harmonic measure in the upper half\nplane. By bounding this measure, we are able to define both the discrete and\ncontinuous time diffusion limit aggregation (DLA) in the upper half plane with\nabsorbing boundary conditions. We prove that for the continuous model the\ngrowth rate is bounded from above by $o(t^{2+\\epsilon})$. When time is\ndiscrete, we also prove a better upper bound of $o(n^{2/3+\\epsilon})$, on the\nmaximum height of the aggregate at time $n$. An important tool developed in\nthis paper, is an interface growth process, bounding any process growing\naccording to the stationary harmonic measure. Together with [10] one obtains\nnon zero growth rate for any such process.\n", "  We study holographic shear sum rules in Einstein gravity with curvature\nsquared corrections. Sum rules relate weighted integral over spectral densities\nof retarded correlators in the shear channel to the one point functions of the\nCFTs. The proportionality constant can be written in terms of the data of three\npoint functions of the stress tenors of the CFT ($t_2$ and $t_4$). For CFTs\ndual to two derivative Einstein gravity, this proportionality constant is just\n$\\frac{d}{2(d+1)}$. This has been verified by a direct holographic computation\nof the retarded correlator for Einstein gravity in $AdS_{d+1}$ black hole\nbackground. We compute corrections to the holographic shear sum rule in\npresence of higher derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We\nfind agreement between the sum rule obtained from a general CFT analysis and\nholographic computation for Gauss Bonnet theories in $AdS_5$ black hole\nbackground. We then generalize the sum rule for arbitrary curvature squared\ncorrections to Einstein-Hilbert action in $d\\geq 4$. Evaluating the parameters\n$t_2$ and $t_4$ for the possible dual CFT in presence of such curvature\ncorrections, we find an agreement with the general field theory derivation to\nleading order in coupling constants of the higher derivative terms.\n", "  Chemically active Brownian particles with surface catalytic reactions may\nrepel each other due to diffusiophoretic interactions in the reaction and\nproduct concentration fields. The system behavior can be described by a\n`chemical' coupling parameter $\\Gamma_c$ that compares the strength of\ndiffusiophoretic repulsion to Brownian motion, and by a mapping to the\nclassical electrostatic One Component Plasma (OCP) system. When confined to a\nconstant-volume domain, Body-Centered Cubic crystals spontaneously form from\nrandom initial configurations when the repulsion is strong enough to overcome\nBrownian motion. Face-Centered Cubic crystals may also be stable. The `melting\npoint' of the `liquid-to-crystal transition' occurs at $\\Gamma_c\\approx140$ for\nboth BCC and FCC lattices.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations\nare not feasible yet for most practical turbulent flows. Therefore, dynamically\nless complex mathematical formulations are necessary for coarse-grained\nsimulations. In this regard, eddy-viscosity models for Large-Eddy Simulation\n(LES) are probably the most popular example thereof. This type of models\nrequires the calculation of a subgrid characteristic length which is usually\nassociated with the local grid size. For isotropic grids this is equal to the\nmesh step. However, for anisotropic or unstructured grids, such as the\npancake-like meshes that are often used to resolve near-wall turbulence or\nshear layers, a consensus on defining the subgrid characteristic length has not\nbeen reached yet despite the fact that it can strongly affect the performance\nof LES models. In this context, a new definition of the subgrid characteristic\nlength is presented in this work. This flow-dependent length scale is based on\nthe turbulent, or subgrid stress, tensor and its representations on different\ngrids. The simplicity and mathematical properties suggest that it can be a\nrobust definition that minimizes the effects of mesh anisotropies on simulation\nresults. The performance of the proposed subgrid characteristic length is\nsuccessfully tested for decaying isotropic turbulence and a turbulent channel\nflow using artificially refined grids. Finally, a simple extension of the\nmethod for unstructured meshes is proposed and tested for a turbulent flow\naround a square cylinder. Comparisons with existing subgrid characteristic\nlength scales show that the proposed definition is much more robust with\nrespect to mesh anisotropies and has a great potential to be used in complex\ngeometries where highly skewed (unstructured) meshes are present.\n", "  This paper shows the CFD investigation of pressure drop and thermal\nperformance of aluminum oxide nano fluid inside square channel inserted a\ncylinder with and without fin using two-phase method. The constant heat flux on\nouter wall and laminar flow regime are applied in the considered domain using\nfinite volume method. The results depict that the enhance of nano-particles\nvolume concentration and Reynolds number have dramatic effects on heat transfer\ncoefficient enhancement. Moreover, the increase of nano-particle diameter has\nopposite impact on heat transfer efficiency. The passive way leads to higher\npressure drops. For all fluids under consideration, pressure drop escalated\nwith Reynolds number. Injecting nano-particles into the water causes to\nincrease in pressure drop and this impact is more significant in high\nnano-particle volume fraction.\n", "  We initiate the study of a new nonlinear parabolic equation on a Riemann\nsurface. The evolution equation arises as a reduction of the Anomaly flow on a\nfibration. We obtain a criterion for long-time existence for this flow, and\ngive a range of initial data where a singularity forms in finite time, as well\nas a range of initial data where the solution exists for all time. A geometric\ninterpretation of these results is given in terms of the Anomaly flow on a\nCalabi-Yau threefold.\n", "  We find evidence for a strong thermal inversion in the dayside atmosphere of\nthe highly irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-18b (T$_{eq}=2411K$, $M=10.3M_{J}$)\nbased on emission spectroscopy from Hubble Space Telescope secondary eclipse\nobservations and Spitzer eclipse photometry. We demonstrate a lack of water\nvapor in either absorption or emission at 1.4$\\mu$m. However, we infer emission\nat 4.5$\\mu$m and absorption at 1.6$\\mu$m that we attribute to CO, as well as a\nnon-detection of all other relevant species (e.g., TiO, VO). The most probable\natmospheric retrieval solution indicates a C/O ratio of 1 and a high\nmetallicity (C/H=$283^{+395}_{-138}\\times$ solar). The derived composition and\nT/P profile suggest that WASP-18b is the first example of both a planet with a\nnon-oxide driven thermal inversion and a planet with an atmospheric metallicity\ninconsistent with that predicted for Jupiter-mass planets at $>2\\sigma$. Future\nobservations are necessary to confirm the unusual planetary properties implied\nby these results.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the formation of metal droplets on the growth\ndynamics of InGaN by Plasma-Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy (PAMBE) at low\ntemperatures (T = 450{\\deg}C). We find that the presence of droplets on the\ngrowth surface strongly affects the adatom incorporation dynamics, making the\ngrowth rate a decreasing function of the overall metal flux impinging on the\nsurface as soon as the metal dose exceeds the critical amount required for the\nnucleation of droplets. We explain this phenomenon via a model that takes into\naccount droplet effects on the incorporation of metal adatoms into the crystal.\nA relevant role is played by the vapor-liquid-solid growth mode that takes\nplace under the droplets due to nitrogen molecules directly impinging on the\ndroplets.\n", "  Two-dimensional monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have unique\noptical and electronic properties for applications pertaining to field effect\ntransistors, light emitting diodes, photodetectors, and solar cells. Vertical\ninterfacing of WS2 and MoS2 layered materials in combination with other\nfamilies of 2D materials were previously reported. On the other hand, lateral\nheterostructures are particularly promising for the spatial confinement of\ncharged carriers, excitons and phonons within an atomically-thin layer. In the\nlateral geometry, the quality of the interface in terms of the crystallinity\nand optical properties is of paramount importance. Using plasmonic near-field\ntip-enhanced technology, we investigated the detailed nanoscale\nphotoluminescence (nano-PL) characteristics of the hetero-interface in a\nmonolayer WS2-MoS2 lateral heterostructure. Focusing the laser excitation spot\nat the apex of a plasmonic tip improved the PL spatial resolution by an order\nof magnitude compared to the conventional far-field PL. Nano-PL spatial line\nprofiles were found to be more pronounced and enhanced at the interfaces. By\nanalyzing the spectral signals of the heterojunctions, we obtained a better\nunderstanding of these direct band gap layered semiconductors, which may help\nto design next-generation smart optoelectronic devices.\n", "  Spintronic devices as alternatives to traditional semiconductor-based\nelectronic devices attract considerable interest as they offer zero quiescent\npower, built-in memory, scalability, and reconfigurability. To realize\nspintronic logic gates for practical use, a complementary logic operation is\nessential but still missing despite a recent progress in spin-based logic\ndevices. Here, we report the development of a complementary spin logic device\nusing electric-field controlled spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching. In heavy\nmetal/ferromagnet/oxide structures, the critical current for SOT-induced\nswitching of perpendicular magnetization is efficiently modulated by an\nelectric field via voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect in a\nnon-volatile manner. Moreover, the polarity of the VCMA is tuned by the\nmodification of oxidation state at the ferromagnet/oxide interface. This allows\nus to fabricate both n-type and p-type spin logic devices and to enable a\ncomplementary logic operation, paving the way for the development of\nnon-volatile and reconfigurable logic devices.\n", "  Polymer composites with thermally conductive nanoscale filler particles, such\nas graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), are promising for certain heat\ntransfer applications. While graphene-polymer composites have been extensively\ninvestigated, studies on h-BN-polymer composites has been relatively rare. In\nthis paper, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the interfacial\nthermal conductance (ITC) involved in the h-BN-polymer composites. We first\ncompare the ITC across h-BN/hexane (C6H14) interfaces to that of\ngraphene/hexane interfaces, where we found that the electrostatic interaction\ndue to the partial charge on h-BN atoms can play an important role in such\ninterfacial thermal transport. Based this finding, we further explore the\nthermal transport across different h-BN interfaces, including h-BN/hexanamine\n(C6H13NH2), h-BN/hexanol (C6H13OH), h-BN/hexanoic acid (C5H11COOH), where the\nincreasingly polar molecules lead to systematic changes in the electrostatic\ninteractions between h-BN and polymers. Heat flux decomposition and atom number\ndensity calculations are performed to understand the role of electrostatic\ninteraction in thermal transport across h-BN-polymer interfaces. It was\nobserved that stronger electrostatic interactions across the interfaces can\nhelp attract the polymer molecules closer to h-BN, and the reduced interface\ndistance leads to larger heat flux contributed from both van der Waals and\nelectrostatic forces. These results may provide useful information to guide the\ndesign of thermally conductive h-BN-polymer nanocomposites.\n", "  During the process of planet formation, the planet-discs interactions might\nexcite (or damp) the orbital eccentricity of the planet. In this paper, we\npresent two long ($t\\sim 3\\times 10^5$ orbits) numerical simulations: (a) one\n(with a relatively light disc, $M_{\\rm d}/M_{\\rm p}=0.2$) where the\neccentricity initially stalls before growing at later times and (b) one (with a\nmore massive disc, $M_{\\rm d}/M_{\\rm p}=0.65$) with fast growth and a late\ndecrease of the eccentricity. We recover the well-known result that a more\nmassive disc promotes a faster initial growth of the planet eccentricity.\nHowever, at late times the planet eccentricity decreases in the massive disc\ncase, but increases in the light disc case. Both simulations show periodic\neccentricity oscillations superimposed on a growing/decreasing trend and a\nrapid transition between fast and slow pericentre precession. The peculiar and\ncontrasting evolution of the eccentricity of both planet and disc in the two\nsimulations can be understood by invoking a simple toy model where the disc is\ntreated as a second point-like gravitating body, subject to secular\nplanet-planet interaction and eccentricity pumping/damping provided by the\ndisc. We show how the counterintuitive result that the more massive simulation\nproduces a lower planet eccentricity at late times can be understood in terms\nof the different ratios of the disc-to-planet angular momentum in the two\nsimulations. In our interpretation, at late times the planet eccentricity can\nincrease more in low-mass discs rather than in high-mass discs, contrary to\nprevious claims in the literature.\n", "  Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are hyperluminous\n($L_{\\mathrm{8-1000\\,\\mu m}}>10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{L_\\odot}$) infrared galaxies with\nextremely high (up to hundreds of K) dust temperatures. The sources powering\nboth their extremely high luminosities and dust temperatures are thought to be\ndeeply buried and rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Hot DOGs\ncould therefore represent a key evolutionary phase in which the SMBH growth\npeaks. X-ray observations can be used to study their obscuration levels and\nluminosities. In this work, we present the X-ray properties of the 20\nmost-luminous ($L_{\\mathrm{bol}}\\gtrsim10^{14}\\, L_\\odot$) known Hot DOGs at\n$z=2-4.6$. Five of them are covered by long-exposure ($10-70$ ks) Chandra and\nXMM-Newton observations, with three being X-ray detected, and we study their\nindividual properties. One of these sources (W0116$-$0505) is a Compton-thick\ncandidate, with column density $N_H=(1.0-1.5)\\times10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$\nderived from X-ray spectral fitting. The remaining 15 Hot DOGs have been\ntargeted by a Chandra snapshot (3.1 ks) survey. None of these 15 is\nindividually detected; therefore we applied a stacking analysis to investigate\ntheir average emission. From hardness-ratio analysis, we constrained the\naverage obscuring column density and intrinsic luminosity to be\nlog$N_H\\,\\mathrm{[cm^{-2}]}>23.5$ and\n$L_X\\gtrsim10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$, which are consistent with\nresults for individually detected sources. We also investigated the\n$L_X-L_{6\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$ and $L_X-L_{bol}$ relations, finding hints that Hot\nDOGs are typically X-ray weaker than expected, although larger samples of\nluminous obscured QSOs are needed to derive solid conclusions.\n", "  Extensions of the NJL model which go beyond the original 4-quark interaction,\nwhich drives the dynamical mass generation, have proven to be quite successful\nin describing low energy hadronic phenomenology. The inclusion of 8-quark\ninteraction terms solved a metastability problem of the effective potential\nintroduced by the inclusion of the 6-quark 't Hooft determinant term in the\n3-flavor version of the model (needed to eliminate the unwanted U(1) axial\nsymmetry) . This model, that has proven to be quite powerful and feature-rich,\nhas been expanded to include all the spin-0 terms, without and with explicit\nchiral symmetry breaking, which are of the same order as the 't Hooft flavor\ndeterminant in a 1/Nc expansion resulting in an unprecedented success in\nreproducing the low lying scalar and pseudoscalar meson spectra. This success\ncan be seen as a result of the inclusion of the full chiral symmetry breaking\npattern. The two critical endpoints which are obtained in the\ntemperature/chemical potential phase diagram are shifted to lower chemical\npotential and higher temperature when the effect of magnetic field is taken\ninto account. For the studied magnetic field strengths (in the range\n$eH=0-0.4~GeV^2$) no significant extra transitions are seen to appear.\n", "  We present a dynamic and thermodynamic study of the orientational glass\nformer Freon113 (CCl2F-CClF2) in order to analyze its kinetic and thermodynamic\nfragilities. Freon113 displays internal molecular degrees of freedom which\npromote a complex energy landscape. Experimental specific heat and its\nmicroscopic origin, the vibrational density of states from inelastic neutron\nscattering, together with the orientational dynamics obtained by means of\ndielectric spectroscopy have revealed the highest fragility value, both\nthermodynamic and kinetic, found for this orientational glass former. The\nexcess in both Debye-reduced specific heat and density of states (boson peak)\nevidences the existence of glassy low-energy excitations. We demonstrate that\nearly proposed correlations between the boson peak and the Debye specific heat\nvalue are elusive as revealed by the clear counterexample of the studied case.\n", "  The low-temperature thermal and transport properties of an unusual kind of\ncrystal exhibiting minimal molecular positional and tilting disorder have been\nmeasured. The material, namely, low-dimensional, highly anisotropic\npentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) has a layered structure of rhombohedral parallel\nplanes in which the molecules execute large-amplitude in-plane as well as\nconcurrent out-of-plane librational motions. Our study reveals that\nlow-temperature glassy anomalies can be found in a system with minimal disorder\ndue to the freezing of (mostly in-plane) reorientational jumps of molecules\nbetween equivalent crystallographic positions with partial site occupation. Our\nfindings will pave the way to a deeper understanding of the origin of\nabove-mentioned universal glassy properties at low temperature.\n", "  Residue number system (RNS) enables dimensionality reduction of an arithmetic\nproblem by representing a large number as a set of smaller integers, where the\nnumber is decomposed by prime number factorization using the moduli as basic\nfunctions. These reduced problem sets can then be processed independently and\nin parallel, thus improving computational efficiency and speed. Here we show an\noptical RNS hardware representation based on integrated nanophotonics. The\ndigit-wise shifting in RNS arithmetic is expressed as spatial routing of an\noptical signal in 2x2 hybrid photonic-plasmonic switches. Here the residue is\nrepresented by spatially shifting the input waveguides relative to the routers\noutputs, where the moduli are represented by the number of waveguides. By\ncascading the photonic 2x2 switches, we design a photonic RNS adder and a\nmultiplier forming an all-to-all sparse directional network. The advantage of\nthis photonic arithmetic processor is the short (10's ps) computational\nexecution time given by the optical propagation delay through the integrated\nnanophotonic router. Furthermore, we show how photonic processing\nin-the-network leverages the natural parallelism of optics such as\nwavelength-division-multiplexing or optical angular momentum in this RNS\nprocessor. A key application for photonic RNS is the functional analysis\nconvolution with widespread usage in numerical linear algebra, computer vision,\nlanguage- image- and signal processing, and neural networks.\n", "  We report that the inclusion of dynamical spin effects in the pion\nholographic light-front wavefunction leads to a remarkable improvement in\ndescribing pion observables (pion mean charge radius, decay constant, spacelike\nelectromagnetic form factor) without the need to invoke higher Fock state\ncontributions and/or a special AdS/QCD mass scale for the pion.\n", "  Topological semimetals can be classified by the connectivity and\ndimensionality of the band cross- ing in momentum space. The band crossings of\na Dirac, Weyl, or an unconventional fermion semimet- al are 0D points, whereas\nthe band crossings of a nodal-line semimetal are 1D closed loops. Here we\npropose that the presence of perpendicular crystalline mirror planes can\nprotect 3D band crossings characterized by nontrivial links such as a Hopf link\nor a coupled-chain, giving rise to a variety of new types of topological\nsemimetals. We show that the nontrivial winding number protects topolog- ical\nsurface states distinct from those in previously known topological semimetals\nwith a vanishing spin-orbit interaction. We also show that these nontrivial\nlinks can be engineered by tuning the mirror eigenvalues associated with the\nperpendicular mirror planes. Using first-principles band structure\ncalculations, we predict the ferromagnetic full Heusler compound Co2MnGa as a\ncandidate. Both Hopf link and chain-like bulk band crossings and unconventional\ntopological surface states are identified.\n", "  Aluminum nitride and silicon nitride have recently emerged as important\nnonlinear optical materials in integrated photonics respectively for their\nquadratic and cubic optical nonlinearity. A composite aluminum nitride and\nsilicon nitride waveguide structure, if realized, will simultaneously allow\nhighly efficient second and third harmonic generation on the same chip platform\nand therefore assists 2f-3f self-referenced frequency combs. On-chip third\nharmonic generation, being a higher order nonlinear optics effect, is more\ndemanding than second harmonic generation due to the large frequency difference\nbetween the fundamental and third harmonic frequencies which implies large\nchange of refractive indices and more strigent requirements on phase matching.\nIn this work we demonstrate high-efficiency third harmonic generation in a high\nQ composite aluminum nitride / silicon nitide ring cavity. By carefully\nengineering the microring resonator geometry of the bilayer structure to\noptimize the quality factor, mode volume and modal overlap of the optical\nfields, we report a maximum conversion efficiency of $180\\%\\,\\mathrm{W^{-2}}$.\nThis composite photonic chip design provides a solution for efficient frequency\nconversion over a large wavelength span, broadband comb generation and\nself-referenced frequency combs.\n", "  We review recent results on chiral $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\approx O(4)$ and\n$U(1)_A$ symmetry restoration in QCD. In particular, we discuss how Ward\nIdentities allow one to derive general results on partner degeneration, which\nshed light on the distinction between the $O(4)$ and $O(4)\\times U(1)_A$\npatterns of the chiral transition. For that purpose, susceptibilities\nassociated with the $O(4)$ and $U(1)_A$ symmetries are studied. From this\nanalysis we conclude that in the ideal regime of exact $O(4)$ restoration\n(formally achieved in the limit of two massless flavours), $U(1)_A$ partners\ndegenerate as well. We also discuss the role of the thermal $f_0(500)$ state to\ndescribe thermodynamic observables sensitive to chiral restoration, such as the\nscalar susceptibility. We pay special attention to the consistency of our\nresults with recent lattice analysis.\n", "  We study thermal properties of a large-N massless pion gas using a low-energy\nQCD approach given by an $O(N +1)/O(N)$ Nonlinear Sigma Model. We build\ndiagrammatically the associated finite free energy to $O(TM^{3})$ in the pion\nmass expansion through an effective vertex that considers all the contributions\ncoming from closed diagrams. Subsequently, we calculate finite order parameters\nsuch as the quark condensate and its respective derivative, i.e., the scalar\nsusceptibility, in the chiral limit, along with their associated critical\nexponents. These results are compared with our previous unitarized scattering\nanalyses for the chiral transition universality class, thus showing a\nreasonable agreement both with lattice simulations and these resonant studies.\n", "  We report the configuration of a Hamamatsu C5680 streak camera as a framing\ncamera to record transverse spatial information of green-component laser\nmicropulses at 3- and 9-MHz rates for the first time. The latter is near the\ntime scale of the ~7.5-MHz revolution frequency of the Integrable Optics Test\nAccelerator (IOTA) ring and its expected synchroton radiation source temporal\nstructure. The 2-D images are recorded with a Gig-E readout CCD camera. We also\nreport a first proof of principle with an OTR source using the linac streak\ncamera in a semi-framing mode.\n", "  We analyze here the mass spectrum of light vector and scalar mesons applying\na novel approach where a modified soft wall model that includes a UV-cutoff at\na finite $z$-position in the AdS space is used, thus introducing an extra\nenergy scale. For this model, we found that the masses for the scalar and\nvector spectra are well fitted within $\\delta_{RMS}=7.64\\%$ for these states,\nwith non-linear trajectories given by two common parameters, the UV locus\n$z_{0}$ and the quadratic dilaton profile slope $\\kappa$. We also conclude that\nin this model, the $f_{0}(500)$ scalar resonance cannot be fitted\nholographycally as a $q\\overline{q}$ state since we cannot find a trajectory\nthat include this pole. This result is in agreement with the most recent\nphenomenological and theoretical methods.\n", "  Most commercially available treatment planning systems for brachytherapy\noperate based on physical dose and do not incorporate fractionation or\ntissue-specific response. The purpose of this study is to investigate the\npotential for hypofractionation in HDR brachytherapy, thereby reducing the\nnumber of implants required. A new treatment planning algorithm was built in\norder to optimize based on tissue and fractionation specific parameters.\nDifferent fractionation schemes were considered for 6 patients, and plans were\ncreated using the new algorithm. A baseline fractionation scheme consisting of\n5 fractions was compared to hypofractionated plans of 1 to 4 fractions. The\neffectiveness of each plan was evaluated using radiobiological criteria taken\nfrom GEC-ESTRO guidelines. The results of this study indicate that an\noptimization algorithm based on biological parameters has similar functionality\nto traditional planning methods with the additional ability to account for\nfractionation effects. Using this algorithm, it was shown that plans consisting\nof 3 and 4 fractions have comparable target coverage with equivalent normal\ntissue exposure. In some specific cases, further fractionation may present\nacceptable target coverage as well.\n", "  We analyze a simplistic model for run-and-tumble dynamics, motivated by\nobservations of complex spatio-temporal patterns in colonies of myxobacteria.\nIn our model, agents run with fixed speed either left or right, and agents turn\nwith a density-dependent nonlinear turning rate, in addition to diffusive\nBrownian motion. We show how a very simple nonlinearity in the turning rate can\nmediate the formation of self-organized stationary clusters and fronts.\nPhenomenologically, we demonstrate the formation of barriers, where high\nconcentrations of agents at the boundary of a cluster, moving towards the\ncenter of a cluster, prevent the agents caught in the cluster from escaping.\nMathematically, we analyze stationary solutions in a four-dimensional ODE with\na conserved quantity and a reversibility symmetry, using a combination of\nbifurcation methods, geometric arguments, and numerical continuation. We also\npresent numerical results on the temporal stability of the solutions found\nhere.\n", "  The number of parameters describing a quantum state is well known to grow\nexponentially with the number of particles. This scaling clearly limits our\nability to do tomography to systems with no more than a few qubits and has been\nused to argue against the universal validity of quantum mechanics itself.\nHowever, from a computational learning theory perspective, it can be shown\nthat, in a probabilistic setting, quantum states can be approximately learned\nusing only a linear number of measurements. Here we experimentally demonstrate\nthis linear scaling in optical systems with up to 6 qubits. Our results\nhighlight the power of computational learning theory to investigate quantum\ninformation, provide the first experimental demonstration that quantum states\ncan be \"probably approximately learned\" with access to a number of copies of\nthe state that scales linearly with the number of qubits, and pave the way to\nprobing quantum states at new, larger scales.\n", "  This short note is intended as a \"Letter to the Editor\" Perspective in order\nthat it serves as a contribution, in view of reaching the physics community\ncaring about rare events and scaling laws and unexpected findings, on a domain\nof wide interest: sport and money. It is apparent from the data reported and\ndiscussed below that the scarcity of such data does not allow to recommend a\ncomplex elaboration of an agent based model, - at this time. In some sense,\nthis also means that much data on sport activities is not necessarily given in\nterms of physics prone materials, but it could be, and would then attract much\nattention. Nevertheless the findings tie the data to well known scaling laws\nand physics processes. It is found that a simple scaling law describes the\ngains of teams in recent bicycle races, like the Tour de France. An analogous\ncase, ranking teams in Formula 1 races, is shown in an Appendix\n", "  We discuss a common suspicion about reported financial data, in 10 industrial\nsectors of the 6 so called \"main developing countries\" over the time interval\n[2000-2014]. These data are examined through Benford's law first significant\ndigit and through distribution distances tests. It is shown that several\nvisually anomalous data have to be a priori removed. Thereafter, the\ndistributions much better follow the first digit significant law, indicating\nthe usefulness of a Benford's law test from the research starting line. The\nsame holds true for distance tests. A few outliers are pointed out.\n", "  We derive a system of equations governing the coupled gravitational and\nelectromagnetic perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om spacetime. The equations\nare derived in the context of global non-linear stability of\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om under axially symmetric polarized perturbations, as a\ngeneralization of the recent work on non-linear stability of Schwarzschild\nspacetime of Klainerman-Szeftel. The main result consists in deriving, through\na Chandrasekhar-type transformation, a gauge invariant quantity associated to\nthe electromagnetic tensor that verifies a Regge-Wheeler equation. In this\npaper, we present the derivation of the main equations, postponing the\nestimates of the non-linear system and the construction of the dynamical\nspacetime to a later time.\n", "  With recent developments in parallel supercomputing architecture, many core,\nmulti-core, and GPU processors are now commonplace, resulting in more levels of\nparallelism, memory hierarchy, and programming complexity. It has been\nnecessary to adapt the MILC code to these new processors starting with NVIDIA\nGPUs, and more recently, the Intel Xeon Phi processors. We report on our\nefforts to port and optimize our code for the Intel Knights Landing\narchitecture. We consider performance of the MILC code with MPI and OpenMP, and\noptimizations with QOPQDP and QPhiX. For the latter approach, we concentrate on\nthe staggered conjugate gradient and gauge force. We also consider performance\non recent NVIDIA GPUs using the QUDA library.\n", "  When a mixture of propylene glycol and water is deposited on a clean glass\nslide, it forms a droplet of a given apparent contact angle rather than\nspreading as one would expect on such a high-energy surface. The droplet is\nstabilized by a Marangoni flow due to the non-uniformity of the components'\nconcentrations between the border and the center of the droplet, itself a\nresult of evaporation. These self-contracting droplets have unusual properties\nsuch as absence of pinning and the ability to move under an external humidity\ngradient. The droplets' apparent contact angle is a function of their\nconcentration and the external humidity. Here we study the motion of such\ndroplets sliding down slopes, how they deform when moving at large speeds, and\ncompare the results to normal non-volatile droplets. We precisely control the\nexternal humidity and explore the influence of the volume, viscosity, surface\ntension, and contact angle. We find that the droplets suffer a negligible\npinning force so that for small velocities the capillary number ($\\mathrm{Ca}$)\nis directly proportional to the Bond number ($\\mathrm{Bo}$):\n$\\mathrm{Ca}=\\mathrm{Bo} \\sin\\alpha$ with $\\alpha$ the angle of the slope. When\nthe droplets move at larger velocities they deform when Ca exceeds a threshold,\nand deposit smaller droplets when $\\mathrm{Ca}$ reaches twice this threshold.\n", "  A susceptibility propagation that is constructed by combining a belief\npropagation and a linear response method is used for approximate computation\nfor Markov random fields. Herein, we formulate a new, improved susceptibility\npropagation by using the concept of a diagonal matching method that is based on\nmean-field approaches to inverse Ising problems. The proposed susceptibility\npropagation is robust for various network structures, and it is reduced to the\nordinary susceptibility propagation and to the adaptive\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer equation in special cases.\n", "  We present the results of ALMA observations of dust continuum emission and\nmolecular rotational lines toward a dense core, MC27 (aka L1521F), which is\nconsidered to be very close to the first core phase. We revealed the\nspatial/velocity structures of the core are very complex and and suggest that\nthe initial condition of star formation is highly dynamical.\n", "  A low-cost, robust, and simple mechanism to measure hemoglobin would play a\ncritical role in the modern health infrastructure. Consistent sample\nacquisition has been a long-standing technical hurdle for photometer-based\nportable hemoglobin detectors which rely on micro cuvettes and dry chemistry.\nAny particulates (e.g. intact red blood cells (RBCs), microbubbles, etc.) in a\ncuvette's sensing area drastically impact optical absorption profile, and\ncommercial hemoglobinometers lack the ability to automatically detect faulty\nsamples. We present the ground-up development of a portable, low-cost and open\nplatform with equivalent accuracy to medical-grade devices, with the addition\nof CNN-based image processing for rapid sample viability prechecks. The\ndeveloped platform has demonstrated precision to the nearest $0.18[g/dL]$ of\nhemoglobin, an R^2 = 0.945 correlation to hemoglobin absorption curves reported\nin literature, and a 97% detection accuracy of poorly-prepared samples. We see\nthe developed hemoglobin device/ML platform having massive implications in\nrural medicine, and consider it an excellent springboard for robust deep\nlearning optical spectroscopy: a currently untapped source of data for\ndetection of countless analytes.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of spin reorientation in the double\nperovskite Ho$_2$FeCoO$_6$. The magnetic phase transitions in this compound are\ncharacterized and studied through magnetization and specific heat, and the\nmagnetic structures are elucidated by neutron powder diffraction. Two magnetic\nphase transitions are observed in this compound - one at $T_\\mathrm{N1}\n\\approx$ 250~K, from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic, and the other at\n$T_\\mathrm{N2} \\approx$ 45~K, from a phase with mixed magnetic structures to a\nsingle phase through a spin reorientation process. The magnetic structure in\nthe temperature range 200~K - 45~K is a mixed phase of the irreducible\nrepresentations $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_3$, both of which are antiferromagnetic.\nThe phase with mixed magnetic structures that exists in Ho$_2$FeCoO$_6$ gives\nrise to a large thermal hysteresis in magnetization that extends from 200~K\ndown to the spin reorientation temperature. At $T_\\mathrm{N2}$, the magnetic\nstructure transforms to $\\Gamma_1$. Though long-range magnetic order is\nestablished in the transition metal lattice, it is seen that only short-range\nmagnetic order prevails in Ho$^{3+}$ - lattice. Our results should motivate\nfurther detailed studies on single crystals in order to explore spin\nreorientation process, spin switching and the possibility of anisotropic\nmagnetic interactions giving rise to electric polarization in Ho$_2$FeCoO$_6$.\n", "  The human brain is one of the most complex living structures in the known\nUniverse. It consists of billions of neurons and synapses. Due to its intrinsic\ncomplexity, it can be a formidable task to accurately depict brain's structure\nand functionality. In the past, numerous studies have been conducted on\nmodeling brain disease, structure, and functionality. Some of these studies\nhave employed Agent-based approaches including multiagent-based simulation\nmodels as well as brain complex networks. While these models have all been\ndeveloped using agent-based computing, however, to our best knowledge, none of\nthem have employed the use of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)\nmethodologies in developing the brain or disease model. This is a problem\nbecause without due process, developed models can miss out on important\nrequirements. AOSE has the unique capability of merging concepts from\nmultiagent systems, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, besides\nconcepts from distributed systems. AOSE involves the various tested software\nengineering principles in various phases of the model development ranging from\nanalysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. In this paper, we employ\nthe use of three different AOSE methodologies for modeling the Multiple\nSclerosis brain disease namely GAIA, TROPOS, and MASE. After developing the\nmodels, we further employ the use of Exploratory Agent-based Modeling (EABM) to\ndevelop an actual model replicating previous results as a proof of concept. The\nkey objective of this study is to demonstrate and explore the viability and\neffectiveness of AOSE methodologies in the development of complex brain\nstructure and cognitive process models. Our key finding include demonstration\nthat AOSE methodologies can be considerably helpful in modeling various living\ncomplex systems, in general, and the human brain, in particular.\n", "  It has been shown that the entropy function formalism is an efficient way to\ncalculate the entropy of black holes in string theory. We check this formalism\nfor the extremal charged dilaton black hole. We find the general\nfour-derivative correction on the black hole entropy from the value of the\nentropy function at its extremum point.\n", "  The deuteration mechanism of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is\nstill being debated. Observations of deuterium-bearing species in several\nastronomical sources represent a powerful tool to improve our understanding of\nthe interstellar chemistry. The doubly deuterated form of the astrophysically\ninteresting Amidogen radical could be a target of detection in space. In this\nwork, the rotational spectrum of the ND$_{2}$ radical in its ground vibrational\nand electronic $X^{2}B_{1}$ states has been investigated between 588 and 1131\nGHz using a frequency modulation millimeter/submillimeter-wave spectrometer.\nThe ND$_{2}$ has been produced in a free-space glass absorption cell by\ndischarging a mixture of ND$_{3}$ and Ar. Sixty-four new transition frequencies\ninvolving $J$ values from 2 to 5 and $K_{a}$ values from 0 to 4 have been\nmeasured. A global analysis including all the previous field-free pure\nrotational data has been performed, allowing for a more precise determination\nof a very large number of spectroscopic parameters. Accurate predictions of\nrotational transition frequencies of ND$_{2}$ are now available from a few GHz\nup to several THz.\n", "  Optical molecular sensing techniques are often limited by the refractive\nindex change associated with the probed interactions. In this work, we present\na closed form analytical model to estimate the magnitude of optical refractive\nindex change arising from protein-protein interactions. The model, based on the\nMaxwell Garnett effective medium theory and first order chemical kinetics\nserves as a general framework for estimating the detection limits of optical\nsensing of molecular interactions. The model is applicable to situations where\none interacting species is immobilized to a surface, as commonly done, or to\nemerging techniques such as Back-Scattering Interferometry (BSI) where both\ninteracting species are un-tethered. Our findings from this model point to the\nstrong role of as yet unidentified factors in the origin of the BSI signal\nresulting in significant deviation from linear optical response.\n", "  With upcoming high-quality data from surveys such as the Extended Baryon\nOscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) or the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI), improving the theoretical modeling and gaining a deeper\nunderstanding of the effects of neutrinos and dark radiation on structure\nformation at small scales are necessary, to obtain robust constraints free from\nsystematic biases. Using a novel suite of hydrodynamical simulations that\nincorporate dark matter, baryons, massive neutrinos, and dark radiation, we\npresent a detailed study of their impact on Lyman-Alpha forest observables. In\nparticular, we accurately measure the tomographic evolution of the shape and\namplitude of the small-scale matter and flux power spectra and search for\nunique signatures along with preferred scales where a neutrino mass detection\nmay be feasible. We then investigate the thermal state of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) through the temperature-density relation. Our findings suggest\nthat at k~5h/Mpc the suppression on the matter power spectrum induced by\nM_nu=0.1 eV neutrinos can reach ~4% at z~3 when compared to a massless neutrino\ncosmology, and ~10% if a massless sterile neutrino is included; surprisingly,\nwe also find good agreement (~2%) with some analytic predictions. For the 1D\nflux power spectrum, the highest response to free-streaming effects is achieved\nat k~0.005 s/km when M_nu=0.1 eV; this k-limit falls in the Lyman-Alpha forest\nregime, making the small-scale 1D flux power spectrum an excellent probe for\ndetecting neutrino and dark radiation imprints. Our results indicate that the\nIGM at z~3 provides the best sensitivity to active and sterile neutrinos.\n", "  In this work we calculate the ratios of rates of the $\\Xi_b$ nonleptonic and\nsemileptonic decays into the $\\Xi_c$(2790) and $\\Xi_c$(2815) ($\\Xi_c^*$)\nresonances. These resonances are dynamically generated from the\npseudoscalar-baryon and vector-baryon interactions, whose mixing is done using\nthe chiral Weinberg-Tomozawa (WT) meson-baryon interaction extended to four\nflavors. The first part of the decay is a weak decay that we analyze through\ntheir quark constituents where it is noted that only the heavy quarks ($b$ and\n$c$) participate in the interaction, leaving the light pair ($ds$) as\nspectators. This first decay then produces a meson-baryon pair that creates the\n$\\Xi_c^*$ through the WT interaction. We then proceed to calculate the decay\nrates to $\\Xi_c$(2790) and $\\Xi_c$(2815) for both the nonleptonic and\nsemileptonic cases and then calculate the ratios between them. We do this\ncalculation nonrelativistically and fully relativistically and notice that,\neven though both approaches yield somewhat different results in the rates, the\nratios are very similar (difference on the order of 1\\%) in both cases. The\nabsolute values of the decay rates are also successfully calculated by\nobtaining the rates between our decays and $\\Lambda_b \\to \\pi (D_s ) \\\n\\Lambda_c (2595) \\left(\\Lambda_c (2625) \\right)$ and $\\Lambda_b \\to \\bar{\\nu}_l\nl \\ \\Lambda_c (2595) \\left(\\Lambda_c (2625) \\right)$ for which there are\nexperimental results, since the momentum transfer is similar such we can cancel\nout the influence of the quark wave functions in the ratios.\n", "  The critical temperature (TC) of MgB2, one of the key factors limiting its\napplication, is highly desired to be improved. On the basis of the\nmeta-material structure, we prepared a smart meta-superconductor structure\nconsisting of MgB2 micro-particles and inhomogeneous phases by an ex situ\nprocess. The effect of inhomogeneous phase on the TC of smart\nmeta-superconductor MgB2 was investigated. Results showed that the onset\ntemperature (Ton C) of doping samples was lower than those of pure MgB2.\nHowever, the offset temperature (Toff C) of the sample doped with Y2O3:Eu3+\nnanosheets with a thickness of 2~3 nm which is much less than the coherence\nlength of MgB2 is 1.2 K higher than that of pure MgB2. The effect of the\napplied electric field on the TC of sample was also studied. Results indicated\nthat with the increase of current, Ton C is slightly increased in the samples\ndoping with different inhomogeneous phases. When increasing current, the Toff C\nof the samples doped with nonluminous inhomogeneous phases was decreased.\nHowever, the Toff C of the luminescent inhomogeneous phase doping samples\nincreased and then decreased as increasing current.\n", "  The evolution of extragalactic radio sources has been a fundamental problem\nin the study of active galactic nuclei for many years. A standard evolutionary\nmodel has been created based on observations of a wide range of radio sources.\nIn the general scenario of the evolution, the younger and smaller\nGigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources become\nlarge-scale FRI and FRII objects. However, a growing number of observations of\nlow power radio sources suggests that the model cannot explain all their\nproperties and there are still some aspects of the evolutionary path that\nremain unclear. There are indications, that some sources may be short-lived\nobjects on timescales of $10^4$ - $10^5$ years. Those objects represent a new\npopulation of active galaxies. Here, we present the discovery of several radio\ntransient sources on timescales of 5-20 years, largely associated with renewed\nAGN (Active Galactic Nucleus) activity. These changing-look AGNs possibly\nrepresent behaviour typical for many active galaxies.\n", "  The architecture of Exascale computing facilities, which involves millions of\nheterogeneous processing units, will deeply impact on scientific applications.\nFuture astrophysical HPC applications must be designed to make such computing\nsystems exploitable. The ExaNeSt H2020 EU-funded project aims to design and\ndevelop an exascale ready prototype based on low-energy-consumption ARM64 cores\nand FPGA accelerators. We participate to the design of the platform and to the\nvalidation of the prototype with cosmological N-body and hydrodynamical codes\nsuited to perform large-scale, high-resolution numerical simulations of cosmic\nstructures formation and evolution. We discuss our activities on astrophysical\napplications to take advantage of the underlying architecture.\n", "  It is difficult to discriminate between the state of initial time $t_0$ and\nthat of time $t_0+\\Delta t$. The task of discriminating between the two states\ncan be interpreted as the hypothesis testing problem as to a state $\\rho$\ndeciding whether $\\rho$ is $\\rho_{t_0}$ or$\\rho_{t_0+\\Delta t}$ We show the\nprocess of optimization of this hypotheses testing and the condition that\ndiscrimination between the two states become difficult even when optimized test\nwas executed. In addition, We consider time-enegy uncertainty relation from the\nviewpoint of optimized hypotheses testing. Optimization consists of two steps.\nThe first step is to optimize the decision rule based on the outcome of the\ngiven measurement by the Neyman-Pearson theorem. The second step is to select\noptimum measurement in order to maximize the power of test. The optimum\nmeasurement is proved to be $\\{ |0\\rangle \\langle 0|,1-|0\\rangle \\langle 0|\\}$\nand the power of test in the optimized test holds\n$\\gamma_{Max}=1-\\exp(-\\frac{2n}{\\hbar^2}\\Delta t^2\\Delta H^2)+o(\\Delta t^2)$\nwhen $\\Delta t \\ll 1$ satisfies,where n is the number of the data. It will be\nimpossible to discriminate between the two states when the power of this test\ndeclines. This condition becomes $\\frac{2n}{\\hbar^2}\\Delta t^2\\Delta H^2\\ll 1$\nin the optimized hypotheses testing.\n  It is remarkable that the optimum measurement is composed of the operators\n$Q_0$ and $1-Q_0$ in the proof of time-energy uncertainty relation. Namely, the\ntime-energy uncertainty relation presents the time interval in which even the\noptimum measurement hardly detect modification of the initial state .\n", "  In latest years, the high sensitivity of the instruments on-board the\nXMM-Newton and Chandra satellites allowed us to explore the properties of the\nX-ray emission from hot subdwarf stars. The small but growing sample of X-ray\ndetected hot subdwarfs includes binary systems, in which the X-ray emission is\ndue to wind accretion onto a compact companion (white dwarf or neutron star),\nas well as isolated sdO stars, in which X-rays are probably due to shock\ninstabilities in the wind. X-ray observations of these low-mass stars provide\ninformation which can be useful for our understanding of the weak winds of this\ntype of stars and can lead to the discovery of particularly interesting binary\nsystems. Here we report the most recent results we have recently obtained in\nthis research area.\n", "  The ~400 MeV flaring emission from the Crab Nebula is naturally explained as\nthe result of an abrupt reduction in the mass-loading of the pulsar wind. Very\nfew particles are then available to carry the current required to maintain wave\nactivity, causing them to achieve high Lorentz factors. When they penetrate the\nNebula, a tightly beamed, high luminosity burst of hard gamma-rays results,\nwith characteristics similar to the observed flares. This mechanism may operate\nin other powerful pulsars, such as J0537-6910 (PWN N 157B), B0540-69, B1957+20\nand J0205+6449 (3C 58).\n", "  Our understanding of protoplanetary disks has greatly improved over the last\ndecade due to a wealth of data from new facilities. Unbiased dust surveys with\nSpitzer leave us with good constraints on the dust dispersal timescale of small\ngrains in the terrestrial planet forming region. In the ALMA era, this can be\nconfronted for the first time also with evolutionary timescales of mm grains in\nthe outer disk. Gas surveys in the context of the existing multi-wavelength\ndust surveys will be a key in large statistical studies of disk gas evolution.\nUnbiased gas surveys are limited to ALMA CO submm surveys, where the\nquantitative interpretation is still debated. Herschel gas surveys have been\nlargely biased, but [OI] 63 mic surveys and also accretion tracers agree\nqualitatively with the evolutionary timescale of small grains in the inner\ndisk. Recent advances achieved by means of consistent multi-wavelength studies\nof gas AND dust in planet forming disks reveal the subtleties of the\nquantitative interpretation of gas surveys. Observational methods to determine\ndisk masses e.g. from CO submm lines require the knowledge of the dust\nproperties in the disk. Understanding not only the gas evolution, but also its\nchemical composition will provide crucial input for planet formation models.\nKinetic chemical results give profoundly different answers than thermodynamic\nequilibrium in terms of the C/O ratios as well as the water ice/rock ratios.\nAgain, dust has a key impact on the chemical evolution and composition of the\ngas. Grain growth for example affects freeze-out processes and strongly\nincreases the cosmic ray induced UV field.\n", "  We construct, for the first time to our knowledge, a one-dimensional\nstochastic field $\\{u(x)\\}_{x\\in \\mathbb{R}}$ which satisfies the following\naxioms which are at the core of the phenomenology of turbulence mainly due to\nKolmogorov:\n  (i) Homogeneity and isotropy: $u(x) \\overset{\\mathrm{law}}= -u(x)\n\\overset{\\mathrm{law}}=u(0)$\n  (ii) Negative skewness (i.e. the $4/5^{\\mbox{\\tiny th}}$-law): \\\\\n$\\mathbb{E}{(u(x+\\ell)-u(x))^3} \\sim_{\\ell \\to 0+} - C \\, \\ell\\,,$ \\, for some\nconstant $C>0$\n  (iii) Intermittency:\n  $\\mathbb{E}{|u(x+\\ell)-u(x) |^q} \\asymp_{\\ell \\to 0} |\\ell|^{\\xi_q}\\,,$ for\nsome non-linear spectrum $q\\mapsto \\xi_q$\n  Since then, it has been a challenging problem to combine axiom (ii) with\naxiom (iii) (especially for Hurst indexes of interest in turbulence, namely\n$H<1/2$). In order to achieve simultaneously both axioms, we disturb with two\ningredients a underlying fractional Gaussian field of parameter $H\\approx \\frac\n1 3 $. The first ingredient is an independent Gaussian multiplicative chaos\n(GMC) of parameter $\\gamma$ that mimics the intermittent, i.e. multifractal,\nnature of the fluctuations. The second one is a field that correlates in an\nintricate way the fractional component and the GMC without additional\nparameters, a necessary inter-dependence in order to reproduce the\nasymmetrical, i.e. skewed, nature of the probability laws at small scales.\n", "  Since the first graphene layer was fabricated in the early 2000's, graphene\nproperties have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically.\nHowever, when comparing the many resistivity models reported in literature,\nseveral discrepancies can be found, as well as a number of inconsistencies\nbetween formulas. In this paper, we revise the main scattering mechanisms in\ngraphene, based on theory and goodness of fit to in-house experimental data. In\nparticular, a step-by-step evaluation of the interaction between electrons and\noptical phonons is carried out, where we demonstrate that the process of\noptical phonon emission scattering is completely suppressed for all low-field\napplications and all temperatures in the range of interest, as opposed to what\nis often reported in literature. Finally, we identify the best scattering\nmodels based on the goodness of fit to experimental data.\n", "  We point out that for sufficiently strong shocks, with Mach number $ M_1 >\n\\sqrt{\\frac{3 \\gamma -1}{(3-\\gamma ) \\gamma }}= 1.34$ ($\\gamma=5/3$), the\nsolutions for cosmic ray-modified shocks experiences a bifurcation. As a\nresult, for super-critical flows an isothermal jump forms (which is not a\nshock). The isothermal jump forms due to the energy diffusion of fast, but\nenergetically subdominant cosmic rays. For super-critical flows the isothermal\njump appears regardless of a particular feed-back mechanism from the CRs. The\ncompression ratio at the isothermal jump is $2/ (\\gamma-1)=3$, so that in the\ntest particle regime the expected spectrum of low energy CRs experiencing\nfirst-order Fermi process is $p = 2\\gamma/(3- \\gamma) = 5/2$, steeper than\nconventional $p=2$.\n", "  This paper presents a simplification design for the fiber cavity ring-down\ntechnique. The new configuration is no longer in ring cavity and is converted\nto a linear cavity. The proposed linear cavity is created with a single fibre\ncoupler of 99:1 and two thin-film mirrors located at the end of the fibre arms.\nThis configuration can be interrogated in reflection or in transmission\n(whether if two fibre couplers are used in conventional configuration), however\nthe reflection interrogation presents better resolution when compared\nsignal-to-noise ratio in the decay time measurement. The mirrors can be also\nreplaced by fibre Bragg gratings and fibre loop mirrors. One of the main\nadvantages of this simplification is its use for remote sensing. However, it is\nnecessary to include amplification in the cavity to eliminate fiber length\nlosses. This configuration allows using any intensity-based optical fibre\nsensor in the literature with twice improvement in the sensitivity and can be\neasily adapted to a commercial system. A proof-of-concept for strain sensing is\ndemonstrated. This simplification opens new paths in physical, chemical or\nbiological parameters using this simple fibre configuration.\n", "  The present work identify an island in the values of dimensionless parameter\n$\\chi$ as +0.10 $<$ $\\chi$ $<$ +0.55 outside which no magnetic rotational (MR)\nbands due to the repulsive interaction would be observed. The semi-classical\ncalculations within the hybrid shears mechanism with the principal axis\ncranking model (HSPAC) reveal the possibility of the shears band due to the\nattractive interaction for nuclei in A $\\sim$ 140 region. Though the limited\ninformation exists in literature, the HSPAC calculation exhibits the dipole\nbands above the 4389-keV and 4160-keV excited states in $^{145}$Sm and\n$^{146}$Eu nuclei, respectively, demand their candidature of the attractive\nshears bands. Other interesting consequence of the HSPAC calculations is the\nincreasing nature of the $B(M1)$ and $B(E2)$ transition strengths with spin\nunlike the decreasing nature of the transition strengths ($B(M1)$ and $B(E2)$\nvalues) of the MR bands. Thus measurement of the transition probability has\nbeen required on urgent basis to validate the strong candidature of such an\nextreme excitation mechanism in $^{145}$Sm and $^{146}$Eu nuclei.\n", "  This work investigated the detection of gravitational wave (GW) from\nsimulated damped sinusoid signals contaminated with Gaussian noise. We proposed\nto treat it as a classification problem with one class bearing our special\nattentions. Two successive steps of the proposed scheme are as following:\nfirst, decompose the data using a wavelet packet and represent the GW signal\nand noise using the derived decomposition coefficients; Second, detect the\nexistence of GW using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reflect our\nspecial attention on searching GW signals, the performance is evaluated using\nnot only the traditional classification accuracy (correct ratio), but also\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and experiments show excelllent\nperformances on both evaluation measures. The generalization of a proposed\nsearching scheme on GW model parameter and possible extensions to other data\nanalysis tasks are crucial for a machine learning based approach. On this\naspect, experiments shows that there is no significant difference between GW\nmodel parameters on identification performances by our proposed scheme.\nTherefore, the proposed scheme has excellent generalization and could be used\nto search for non-trained and un-known GW signals or glitches in the future GW\nastronomy era.\n", "  Cecotti and Vafa proposed in 1993 a beautiful idea how to associate spectral\nnumbers $\\alpha_1,...,\\alpha_n\\in{\\mathbb R}$ to real upper triangular $n\\times\nn$ matrices $S$ with 1's on the diagonal and eigenvalues of $S^{-1}S^t$ in the\nunit sphere. Especially, $\\exp(-2\\pi i\\alpha_j)$ shall be the eigenvalues of\n$S^{-1}S^t$.\n  We tried to make their idea rigorous, but we succeeded only partially. This\npaper fixes our results and our conjectures. For certain subfamilies of\nmatrices their idea works marvellously, and there the spectral numbers fit well\nto natural (split) polarized mixed Hodge structures. We formulate precise\nconjectures saying how this should extend to all matrices $S$ as above.\n  The idea might become relevant in the context of semiorthogonal\ndecompositions in derived algebraic geometry. Our main interest are the cases\nof Stokes like matrices which are associated to holomorphic functions with\nisolated singularities (Landau-Ginzburg models). Also there we formulate\nprecise conjectures (which overlap with expectations of Cecotti and Vafa). In\nthe case of the chain type singularities, we have positive results.\n  We hope that this paper will be useful for further studies of the idea of\nCecotti and Vafa.\n", "  We analyze in detail the electronic properties of high pressure hydrogen\naround the liquid-liquid phase transition based on Coupled Electron-Ion Monte\nCarlo calculations. Computing the off-diagonal single particle density matrix\nand the momentum distribution we discuss localization properties of the\nelectrons. The abrupt changes of these distributions indicate a metal to\ninsulator transition occurring together with the structural transition from the\natomic to molecular fluid. We further discuss the electron-proton and\nelectron-electron pair correlation functions, which also change abruptly at the\ntransition.\n", "  A substantial fraction the stellar mass attributed to galaxies is invisible:\nstars close to the hydrogen burning limit, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron\nstars and black holes. These constituents do, however, gravitationally\nmicro-lens background quasars, thereby permitting measurement of the total\nstellar contribution to the mass surface density along the line of sight. We\nreport the results of such a measurement using a sample of ten quadruply lensed\nquasars. We discuss the prospects for improving upon this measurement with a\nlarger sample and describe efforts to find new quadruple lenses. If we invert\nour argument and take the stellar mass to be known, we derive a value for the\nfraction of the dark halo in MaCHOs (including 20 solar mass primordial black\nholes) of somthing less than 10%, confirming the widely ignored result of\nMediavilla et al (2009).\n", "  The traditional paradigm for materials discovery has been recently expanded\nto incorporate substantial data driven research. With the intent to accelerate\nthe development and the deployment of new technologies, the AFLOW Fleet for\ncomputational materials design automates high-throughput first principles\ncalculations, and provides tools for data verification and dissemination for a\nbroad community of users. AFLOW incorporates different computational modules to\nrobustly determine thermodynamic stability, electronic band structures,\nvibrational dispersions, thermo-mechanical properties and more. The AFLOW data\nrepository is publicly accessible online at aflow.org, with more than 1.7\nmillion materials entries and a panoply of queryable computed properties. Tools\nto programmatically search and process the data, as well as to perform online\nmachine learning predictions, are also available.\n", "  Models of the Solar System evolution show that almost all the primitive\nmaterial leftover from the formation of the planets was ejected to the\ninterstellar space as a result of dynamical instabilities. Accordingly, minor\nbodies should also be ejected from other planetary systems and should be\nabundant in the interstellar space. The number density of such objects, and\nprospects for their detection as they penetrate through the Solar System, were\nspeculated about for decades, recently rising high hopes with the Pan-STARRS\nand LSST surveys. These expectations materialized on 18 October 2017 with the\nPan-STARRS's discovery of 1I/'Oumuamua. Here we report homogeneous photometric\nobservations of this body from Gemini North, which densely cover a total of 8\nhr over two nights. A combined ultra-deep image of 1I/'Oumuamua shows no signs\nof cometary activity, confirming the results from earlier, less sensitive\nsearches. Our data also show an enormous range of brightness variations > 2.5\nmag, larger than ever observed in the population of Solar System objects,\nsuggesting a very elongated shape of the body. But most significantly, the\nlight curve does not repeat exactly from one rotation cycle to another and its\ndouble-peaked periodicity of 7.5483 $\\pm$ 0.0073 hr from our data is\ninconsistent with earlier determinations. These are clear signs of a tumbling\nmotion, a remarkable characteristic of 1I/'Oumuamua's rotation, consistent with\na catastrophic collision in the distant past. This first example of an impacted\nminor body of exosolar origin indicates that collisional evolution of minor\nbody populations in other planetary systems is not uncommon.\n", "  We investigate, experimentally and theoretically, polarization rotation\neffects in dilute photonic crystals with transverse permittivity inhomogeneity\nperpendicular to the traveling direction of waves. A capsize, namely a drastic\nchange of polarization to the perpendicular direction is observed in a\none-dimensional photonic crystal in the frequency range $10\\div 140$ GHz. To\ngain more insights into the rotational mechanism, we have developed a\ntheoretical model of dilute photonic crystal, based on Maxwell's equations with\na spatially dependent two dimensional inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity. We\nshow that the polarization's rotation can be explained by an optical splitting\nparameter appearing naturally in Maxwell's equations for magnetic or electric\nfields components. This parameter is an optical analogous of Rashba like\nspin-orbit interaction parameter present in quantum waves, introduces a\ncorrection to the band structure of the two-dimensional Bloch states, creates\nthe dynamical phase shift between the waves propagating in the orthogonal\ndirections and finally leads to capsizing of the initial polarization.\nExcellent agreement between theory and experiment is found.\n", "  The origin of the 3.55 keV excess reported in various galaxies and galaxy\nclusters remains unknown. Non-observations of the line in dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies (dSphs) create tension with galaxy cluster observations when\nconsidering a direct Dark Matter (DM) $\\rightarrow \\gamma$ decay. This\ndiscrepancy could be explained by a DM $\\rightarrow a \\rightarrow \\gamma$\ndecay, where the DM particles decay to axion-like particles (ALPs), which then\nconvert to photons in a magnetic field. The 3.55 keV line from a decay to ALPs\ntherefore has very different morphology from a direct decay to photons, as it\nwould only appear in environments with substantial magnetic fields between the\nsource and us. To test this hypothesis we consider targets where the line\nstrength would be enhanced compared to the DM $\\rightarrow \\gamma$ model. The\ngiant lobes of radio galaxies could represent good environments, having\nmagnetic fields with strength $\\mathcal{O}(\\mu\\rm{G})$ that extend for hundreds\nof kiloparsecs, and minimal X-ray background. In the case of Centaurus A, a\nlarge population of dSphs are associated with the galaxy, some of which are\npotentially in or behind its lobes. In this paper we estimate the flux of a\n3.55 keV DM $\\rightarrow a \\rightarrow \\gamma$ line from these sources, and\ncompare it to the flux from the DM halo of Centaurus~A. We comment on the\npotential to detect such a signal with current satellites (such as XMM-Newton\nand Chandra) and future satellites (such as Athena).\n"]}
