The energy spectrum is shown to be\nin accord with the Kolmogorov scaling. The vortex line decay equation is shown\nto have an underlying Hamiltonian framework. Effects of spatial intermittency\n(exhibited in laboratory experiments) on superfluid turbulence are incorporated\nvia the fractal nature of the vortex lines, for length scales of the order or\nsmaller than the intervortical distance. The spatial intermittency effects are\nshown to enhance the vortex line density L, for a given value of intervortex\nspacing L, and to provide for a mechanism commensurate with the enhanced\ndepolarization of vortex lines. The spatial intermittency is found to steepen\nthe energy spectrum in qualitative agreement with laboratory experiments and to\nenhance vortex line decay.\n", "  Community structure is a typical property of many real-world networks, and\nhas become a key to understand the dynamics of the networked systems. In these\nnetworks most nodes apparently lie in a community while there often exists a\nfew nodes straddling several communities. An ideal algorithm for community\ndetection is preferable which can identify the overlapping communities in such\nnetworks. To represent an overlapping division we develop a encoding schema\ncomposed of two segments, the first one represents a disjoint partition and the\nsecond one represents a extension of the partition that allows of multiple\nmemberships. We give a measure for the informativeness of a node, and present\nan evolutionary method for detecting the overlapping communities in a network.\n", "  Recent calculations in loop quantum cosmology suggest that a transition from\na Lorentzian to an Euclidean space-time might take place in the very early\nUniverse. The transition point leads to a state of silence, characterized by a\nvanishing speed of light. This behavior can be interpreted as a decoupling of\ndifferent space points, similar to the one characterizing the BKL phase.\n  In this study, we address the issue of imposing initial conditions for the\ncosmological perturbations at the transition point between the Lorentzian and\nEuclidean phases. Motivated by the decoupling of space points, initial\nconditions characterized by a lack of correlations are investigated. We show\nthat the \"white noise\" gains some support from analysis of the vacuum state in\nthe deep Euclidean regime.\n  Furthermore, the possibility of imposing the silent initial conditions at the\ntrans-Planckian surface, characterized by a vanishing speed for the propagation\nof modes with wavelengths of the order of the Planck length, is studied. Such\ninitial conditions might result from a loop-deformations of the Poincar\\'e\nalgebra. The conversion of the silent initial power spectrum to a\nscale-invariant one is also examined.\n", "  Time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEGF) are shown to provide\na flexible, effective tool for the description of quantum mechanical single\nparticle scattering on a spatially localized, time-dependent potential.\nFocusing on numerical methods, arbitrary space and time dependence of the\npotential can be treated, provided it is zero before an initial time instant.\nIn this case, appropriate version of the Dyson and Keldysh equations lead to a\ntransparent description with clear physical interpretation. The interaction of\na short laser pulse and an electron propagating initially in free space is\ndiscussed as an example.\n", "  Silicene, the two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon has very recently\nattracted a lot of attention. It has a structure that is similar to graphene\nand it is theoretically predicted to show the same kind of electronic\nproperties which has put graphene into the focus of large research and\ndevelopment projects world-wide. In particular, a 2D structure made from Si is\nof high interest because of the application potential in Si-based electronic\ndevices. However, so far there is not much known about the silicene band\nstructure from experimental studies. A comprehensive study is here presented of\nthe atomic and electronic structure of the silicene phase on Ag(111) denoted as\n(2$\\sqrt{3}$x2$\\sqrt{3}$)R30{\\deg} in the literature. Low energy electron\ndiffraction (LEED) shows an unconventional rotated (\"2$\\sqrt{3}$x2$\\sqrt{3}$\")\npattern with a complicated set of split diffraction spots. Scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) results reveal a Ag(111) surface that is homogeneously covered\nby the (\"2$\\sqrt{3}$x2$\\sqrt{3}$\") silicene which exhibits an additional\nquasi-periodic long range ordered superstructure. The complex structure,\nrevealed by STM, has been investigated in detail and we present a consistent\npicture of the silicene structure based on both STM and LEED. The homogeneous\ncoverage by the (\"2$\\sqrt{3}$x2$\\sqrt{3}$\") silicene facilitated an\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy study which reveals a silicene band\nstructure of unprecedented detail. Here, we report four silicene bands which\nare compared to calculated dispersions based on a relaxed\n(2$\\sqrt{3}$x2$\\sqrt{3}$) model. We find good qualitative agreement between the\nexperimentally observed bands and calculated silicene bands of {\\sigma}\ncharacter.\n", "  In the case of graphene, hydrogenation removes the conductivity due to the\nbands forming the Dirac cone by opening up a band gap. This type of chemical\nfunctionalization is of utmost importance for electronic applications. As\npredicted by theoretical studies, a similar change of the band structure is\nexpected for silicene, the closest analogue to graphene. We here report a study\nof the atomic and electronic structures of hydrogenated silicene, so called\nsilicane. The ($\\small 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{3}$) phase of silicene on\nAg(111) was used in this study since it can be formed homogeneously across the\nentire surface of the Ag substrate. Low energy electron diffraction and\nscanning tunneling microscopy data clearly show that hydrogenation changes the\nstructure of silicene on Ag(111) resulting in a (1 $\\times$ 1) periodicity with\nrespect to the silicene lattice. The hydrogenated silicene also exhibits a\nquasi-regular ($\\small 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 2\\sqrt{3}$)-like arrangement of\nvacancies. Angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy revealed two dispersive\nbands which can be unambiguously assigned to silicane. The common top of these\nbands is located at $\\small \\backsim$ 0.9 eV below the Fermi level. We find\nthat the experimental bands are closely reproduced by the theoretical band\nstructure of free standing silicane with H adsorbed on the upper hexagonal\nsub-lattice of silicene.\n", "  We review the one-loop effective action in scalar QED and the Schwinger\neffect in a uniform electric field in a two-dimensional (anti-) de Sitter\nspace. The Schwinger effect has a thermal interpretation in terms of the\neffective temperature introduced by Cai and Kim. We propose a method to find\nthe density of states for the charged scalar and obtain the QED action density\nand the pair-production rate in the in-out formalism.\n", "  We present a definition of the two-sided inverse of position operator in\ngeneral case of deformed Heisenberg algebra leading to minimal length. Energy\nspectrum and eigenfunctions in momentum space for 1D Coulomb-like potential in\ndeformed space are found exactly. We analyse the energy spectrum for different\npartial cases of deformation function and find that correction due to the\ndeformation highly depends on type of the deformation function.\n", "  The Eulerian perfect-fluid theory is reformulated from its action principle\nin a pure field-theoretic manner. Conservation of the convective current is no\nlonger imposed by Lin's constraints, but rather adopted as the central idea of\nthe theory. Our formulation, for the first time, successfully reduces redundant\ndegrees of freedom promoting one half of the Clebsch variables as the true\ndynamical fields. Interactions on these fields allow for the exchange of the\nconvective current of quantities such as mass and charge, which are uniformly\nunderstood as the breaking of the underlying symmetry of the force-free fluid.\nThe Clebsch fields play the essential role in the exchange of angular momentum\nwith the force field producing vorticity.\n", "  An accurate description of nonadiabatic energy relaxation is crucial for\nmodeling atomistic dynamics at metal surfaces. Interfacial energy transfer due\nto electron-hole pair excitations coupled to motion of molecular adsorbates is\noften simulated by Langevin molecular dynamics with electronic friction. Here,\nwe present calculations of the full electronic friction tensor by using first\norder time-dependent perturbation theory (TDPT) at the density functional\ntheory (DFT) level. We show that the friction tensor is generally anisotropic\nand non-diagonal, as found for hydrogen atom on Pd(100) and CO on a Cu(100)\nsurfaces. This implies that electron-hole pair induced nonadiabatic coupling at\nmetal surfaces leads to friction-induced mode coupling, therefore opening an\nadditional channel for energy redistribution. We demonstrate the robustness and\naccuracy of our results by direct comparison to established methods and\nexperimental data.\n", "  Within the framework of quantum mechanics working with one-dimensional,\nmanifestly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H=T+V$ the traditional class of the\nexactly solvable models with local point interactions $V=V(x)$ is generalized.\nThe consequences of the use of the nonlocal point interactions such that $(V\nf)(x) = \\int K(x,s) f(s) ds$ are discussed using the suitably adapted formalism\nof boundary triplets.\n", "  In this paper, we indicate a possibility of utilizing the intense chromium\nsource ($\\sim 370 PBq$) in probing the neutrino nature in low energy neutrino\nexperiments with the ultra-low threshold and background real-time Borexino\ndetector located near the source ($\\sim 8 m$). We analyze the elastic\nscattering of electron neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana, respectively) on the\nunpolarized electrons in the relativistic neutrino limit. We assume that the\nincoming neutrino beam is the superposition of left-right chiral states. Left\nchiral neutrinos may be detected by the standard $V A$ and non-standard scalar\n$S_L$, tensor $T_L$ interactions, while right chiral ones partake only in the\nexotic $V + A$ and $S_R, T_R$ interactions. Our model-independent study is\ncarried out for the flavour (current) neutrino eigenstates. We compute the\nexpected event number for the standard $V-A$ interaction of the left chiral\nneutrinos using the current experimental values of standard couplings and in\nthe case of left-right chiral superposition. We show that the significant\ndecrement in the event number due to the interference terms between the\nstandard and exotic interactions for the Majorana $\\nu_e$'s may appear. The $90\n\\%$ C. L. sensitivity contours in the planes of corresponding exotic couplings\nare also found. The presence of interferences in the Majorana case gives the\nstronger constraints than for the Dirac neutrinos, even if the neutrino source\nis placed outside the detector.\n", "  This contribution investigates the extension of the microplane formulation to\nthe description of transversely isotropic materials such as shale rock, foams,\nunidirectional composites, and ceramics. Two possible approaches are\nconsidered: 1) the spectral decomposition of the stiffness tensor to define the\nmicroplane constitutive laws in terms of energetically orthogonal eigenstrains\nand eigenstresses; and 2) the definition of orientation-dependent microplane\nelastic moduli. It is shown that the first approach provides a rigorous way to\ntackle anisotropy within the microplane framework whereas the second approach\nrepresents an approximation which, however, makes the formulation of nonlinear\nconstitutive equations much simpler. The efficacy of the second approach in\nmodeling the macroscopic elastic behavior is compared to the thermodynamic\nrestrictions of the anisotropic parameters showing that a significant range of\nelastic properties can be modeled with excellent accuracy. Further, it is shown\nthat it provides a very good approximation of the microplane stresses provided\nby the first approach, with the advantage of a simpler formulation.\n  It is concluded that the spectral stiffness decomposition represents the best\napproach in such cases as for modeling unidirectional composites, in which\naccurately capturing the elastic behavior is important. The introduction of\norientation-dependent microplane elastic moduli provides a simpler framework\nfor the modeling of transversely isotropic materials with remarked inelastic\nbehavior, as in the case, for example, of shale rock.\n", "  Further investigation of data on quasars, especially in the ultraviolet band,\nyields an amazingly coherent narrative which we present in this paper. Quasars\nare characterised by strong continuum emission and redshifted emission and\nabsorption lines which includes the famous Lyman $\\alpha$ forest. We present\nirrefutable evidence in support of (1) the entire line spectrum arising in\nmatter located inside the quasar system, (2) the range of redshifts shown by\nthe lines being due to the variable contribution of the gravitational redshift\nin the observed line velocity, (3) existence of rotating black holes and of\nmatter inside its ergosphere, (4) quasars located within cosmological redshifts\n$\\sim 3$, (5) $\\gamma$ ray bursts being explosive events in a quasar. These\nresults are significant and a game-changer when we realise that the absorbing\ngas has been postulated to exist along the line-of-sight to the quasar and\nobservations have accordingly been interpreted.\n  In light of these definitive results which uniquely constrain the quasar\nstructure, we need to drastically revise our understanding of the universe\nbuilt on the faulty assumptions of observed redshifts of quasars having an\nentirely cosmological origin and the absorption lines arising in the\nintervening medium.\n", "  A full-wave numerical scheme of polarisability tensors evaluation is\npresented. The method accepts highly conducting bodies of arbitrary shape and\nexplicitly accounts for the radiation as well as ohmic losses. The method is\nverified on canonical bodies with known polarisability tensors, such as a\nsphere and a cube, as well as on realistic scatterers. The theoretical\ndevelopments are followed by a freely available code whose sole user input is\nthe triangular mesh covering the surface of the body under consideration.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new approach that generalizes the existing\nsecond-order hydrodynamic traffic models. In the proposed approach, we use the\nexpression for the relative velocity of disturbances propagation in traffic\nflow. We show that properties of any phenomenological model are fully defined\nby how the relative velocity of disturbances propagation expressed in the\nmodel. We verify the proposed approach through simulations of the Interstate\n580 freeway segment in California, USA, with traffic measurements from the\nPerformance Measurement System (PeMS).\n", "  The relation between network structure and dynamics is determinant for the\nbehavior of complex systems in numerous domains. An important long-standing\nproblem concerns the properties of the networks that optimize the dynamics with\nrespect to a given performance measure. Here we show that such optimization can\nlead to sensitive dependence of the dynamics on the structure of the network.\nSpecifically, using diffusively coupled systems as examples, we demonstrate\nthat the stability of a dynamical state can exhibit sensitivity to unweighted\nstructural perturbations (i.e., link removals and node additions) for\nundirected optimal networks and to weighted perturbations (i.e., small changes\nin link weights) for directed optimal networks. As mechanisms underlying this\nsensitivity, we identify discontinuous transitions occurring in the complement\nof undirected optimal networks and the prevalence of eigenvector degeneracy in\ndirected optimal networks. These findings establish a unified characterization\nof networks optimized for dynamical stability, which we illustrate using Turing\ninstability in activator-inhibitor systems, synchronization in power-grid\nnetworks, network diffusion, and several other network processes. Our results\nsuggest that the network structure of a complex system operating near an\noptimum can potentially be fine-tuned for a significantly enhanced stability\ncompared to what one might expect from simple extrapolation. On the other hand,\nthey also suggest constraints on how close to the optimum the system can be in\npractice. Finally, the results have potential implications for biophysical\nnetworks, which have evolved under the competing pressures of optimizing\nfitness while remaining robust against perturbations.\n", "  In this thesis we review some results on the generalization of the\ngauge/gravity duality to new cases by using T-duality and by including\nfundamental matter, finding applications to condensed matter physics. First, we\nconstruct new supersymmetric solutions of type IIA/B and eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity by using non-abelian T-duality. Second, we construct a type IIA\nsupergravity solution with D6-brane sources, dual to an unquenched massive\nflavored version of the ABJM theory. Third, we study a probe D6-brane with\nworldvolume gauge fields in the ABJM background, obtaining the dual description\nof a quantum Hall system. Moreover, we consider a system of a probe D6-brane in\nthe ABJM background and study quantum phase transitions of its dual theory.\n", "  We investigate the realization of the emergent universe scenario in theories\nwith natural UV cutoffs, namely a minimum length and a maximum momentum,\nquantified by a new deformation parameter in the generalized uncertainty\nprinciple. We extract the Einstein static universe solutions and we examine\ntheir stability through a phase-space analysis. As we show, the role of the new\ndeformation parameter is crucial in a twofold way: Firstly, it leads to the\nappearance of new Einstein static universe critical points, that are absent in\nstandard cosmology. Secondly, it provides a way for a graceful exit from the\nEinstein static universe into the expanding thermal history, that is needed for\na complete and successful realization of the emergent universe scenario.\n", "  We propose the model describing the observed multiple fast radio bursts due\nto the close encounters and collisions of neutron stars in the central clusters\nof the evolved galactic nuclei. The subsystem of neutron star cluster may\noriginate in the dense galactic nucleus evolutionary in the combined processes\nof stellar and dynamical evolution. The neutron stars in the compact cluster\ncan produce the short living binaries with the highly eccentric orbits, and\nfinally collide after several orbital revolutions. Fast radio bursts may be\nproduced during the close periastron approach and at the process of the final\nbinary merging. In the sufficiently dense star cluster the neutron stars\ncollisions can be very frequent. Therefore, this model can explain in principle\nthe observed recurrent (multiple) fast radio bursts, analogous to the observed\nones from the source FRB 121102. Among the possible observational signatures of\nthe proposed model may be the registration of the gravitational wave bursts by\nthe laser interferometers LIGO/VIRGO or by the next generation of gravitational\nwave detectors.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating an unknown but constant carrier phase\nmodulation $\\theta$ using a general -- possibly entangled -- $n$-mode optical\nprobe through $n$ independent and identical uses of a lossy bosonic channel\nwith additive thermal noise. We find an upper bound to the quantum Fisher\ninformation (QFI) of estimating $\\theta$ as a function of $n$, the mean and\nvariance of the total number of photons $N_{\\rm S}$ in the $n$-mode probe, the\ntransmissivity $\\eta$ and mean thermal photon number per mode ${\\bar n}_{\\rm\nB}$ of the bosonic channel. Since the inverse of QFI provides a lower bound to\nthe mean-squared error (MSE) of an unbiased estimator $\\tilde{\\theta}$ of\n$\\theta$, our upper bound to the QFI provides a lower bound to the MSE. It\nalready has found use in proving fundamental limits of covert sensing, and\ncould find other applications requiring bounding the fundamental limits of\nsensing an unknown parameter embedded in a correlated field.\n", "  The most energetic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are remarkable sources releasing\nhuge amounts of energy on short timescales. Their prompt emission, which\nusually lasts few seconds, is so bright that it is visible across the whole\nobservable universe. Studying these extreme events may provide clues on the\nnature of GRB progenitors and on the physical processes at work in relativistic\njets.\n  In this paper, we study the bright end of the isotropic energy distribution\nof long GRBs. We use two samples of long GRBs with redshift detected by\nFermi/GBM or Konus-Wind, two instruments which measure the spectral shape and\nthe energetics of the prompt emission accurately. We focus on GRBs within a\nrange of redshifts z = 1 -- 5, a volume that contains a large number of\nenergetic GRBs, and we propose a simple method to reconstruct the bright end of\nthe GRB energy distribution from the observed one. We find that the GRB energy\ndistribution cannot be described by a simple power law but requires a strong\ncutoff above $1-3 \\times 10^{54}$ erg. We attribute this feature to an\nintrinsic limit on the energy per unit of solid angle radiated by gamma-ray\nbursts.\n", "  A key ecological parameter for planktonic copepods studies is their\ninterspecies encounter rate which is driven by their behaviour and is strongly\ninfluenced by turbulence of the surrounding environment. A distinctive feature\nof copepods motility is their ability to perform quick displacements, often\ndubbed jumps, by means of powerful swimming strokes. Such a reaction has been\nassociated to an escape behaviour from flow disturbances due to predators or\nother external dangers. In the present study, the encounter rate of copepods in\na developed turbulent flow with intensity comparable to the one found in\ncopepods' habitat is numerically investigated. This is done by means of a\nLagrangian copepod (LC) model that mimics the jump escape reaction behaviour\nfrom localised high-shear rate fluctuations in the turbulent flows. Our\nanalysis shows that the encounter rate for copepods of typical perception\nradius of ~ {\\eta}, where {\\eta} is the dissipative scale of turbulence, can be\nincreased by a factor up to ~ 100 compared to the one experienced by passively\ntransported fluid tracers. Furthermore, we address the effect of introducing in\nthe LC model a minimal waiting time between consecutive jumps. It is shown that\nany encounter-rate enhancement is lost if such time goes beyond the dissipative\ntime-scale of turbulence, {\\tau}_{\\eta}. Because typically in the ocean {\\eta}\n~ 0.001m and {\\tau}_{\\eta} ~ 1s, this provides stringent constraints on the\nturbulent-driven enhancement of encounter-rate due to a purely mechanical\ninduced escape reaction.\n", "  Exotic spin-multipolar ordering in spin transition metal insulators has so\nfar eluded unambiguous experimental observation. A less studied, but perhaps\nmore feasible fingerprint of multipole character emerges in the excitation\nspectrum in the form of quadrupolar transitions. Such multipolar excitations\nare desirable as they can be manipulated with the use of light or electric\nfield and can be captured by means of conventional experimental techniques.\nHere we study single crystals of multiferroic Sr$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, and show\nthat due to its nearly isotropic nature a purely quadrupolar bimagnon mode\nappears in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra. This non-magnetic\nspin-excitation couples to the electric field of the light and becomes\nobservable for a specific experimental configuration, in full agreement with a\ntheoretical analysis of the selection rules.\n", "  Gravitational-wave astronomy can give us access to the structure of black\nholes, potentially probing microscopic or even Planckian corrections at the\nhorizon scale, as those predicted by some quantum-gravity models of exotic\ncompact objects. A generic feature of these models is the replacement of the\nhorizon by a reflective surface. Objects with these properties are prone to the\nso-called ergoregion instability when they spin sufficiently fast. We\ninvestigate in detail a simple model consisting of scalar perturbations of a\nKerr geometry with a reflective surface near the horizon. The instability\ndepends on the spin, on the compactness, and on the reflectivity at the\nsurface. The instability time scale increases only logarithmically in the\nblack-hole limit and, for a perfectly reflecting object, this is not enough to\nprevent the instability from occurring on dynamical time scales. However, we\nfind that an absorption rate at the surface as small as 0.4% (reflectivity\ncoefficient as large as $|{\\cal R}|^2=0.996$) is sufficient to quench the\ninstability completely. Our results suggest that exotic compact objects are not\nnecessarily ruled out by the ergoregion instability.\n", "  A proposal to link the equation of state of a monocomponent hard-disk fluid\nto the equation of state of a polydisperse hard-disk mixture is presented.\nEvent-driven molecular dynamics simulations are performed to obtain data for\nthe compressibility factor of the monocomponent fluid and of 26 polydisperse\nmixtures with different size distributions. Those data are used to assess the\nproposal and to infer the values of the compressibility factor of the\nmonocomponent hard-disk fluid in the metastable region from those of mixtures\nin the high-density region. The collapse of the curves for the different\nmixtures is excellent in the stable region. In the metastable regime, except\nfor two mixtures in which crystallization is present, the outcome of the\napproach exhibits a rather good performance. The simulation results indicate\nthat a (reduced) variance of the size distribution larger than about $0.01$ is\nsufficient to avoid crystallization and explore the metastable fluid branch.\n", "  So far the study of black hole perturbations has been mostly focussed upon\nthe classical black holes with singularities at the origin and hidden by event\nhorizon. Compared to that, the regular black holes are a completely new class\nof solutions arising out of modification of general theory of relativity by\ncoupling gravity to an external form of matter. Therefore it is extremely\nimportant to study the behaviour of such regular black holes under different\ntypes of perturbations. Recently a new regular Bardeen black hole solution with\na de Sitter branch has been proposed by Fernando. We compute the quasi-normal\n(QN) frequencies for the regular Bardeen de Sitter (BdS) black hole due to\nmassless and massive scalar field perturbations as well as the massless Dirac\nperturbations. We analyze the behaviour of both real and imaginary parts of\nquasinormal frequencies by varying different parameters of the theory.\n", "  The theoretical procedure of supersymmetric quantum mechanics is adopted to\ngenerate the resonance state wave functions of the unbound nucleus $^{15}$Be.\nIn this framework, we used a density dependent M3Y microscopic potential and\narrived at the energy and width of the 1.8 MeV (5/2$^+$) resonance state. We\ndid not find any other nearby resonances for $^{15}$Be. It becomes apparent\nthat the present framework is a powerful tool to theoretically complement the\nincreasingly important accelerator based experiments with unbound nuclei.\n", "  A ghost D-brane has been proposed as an object that cancels the effects of a\nD-branes. We construct a classical solution with an arbitrary number of\nD-branes and ghost D-branes in the context of open string field theory.\nCancellation of BRST cohomolgy between D-branes and ghost D-branes is shown.\n", "  Recently observed quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) membranes\nhave a potential for achieving high accessibility and controllability thanks to\nthe lower spatial dimension. Moreover, these objects naturally have a high\nsensitivity to vibrations of the hosting membrane due to its low mass density\nand high elasticity modulus. Here, we propose and analyze a spin-mechanical\nsystem based on color centers in a suspended hBN mechanical resonator. Through\ngroup theoretical analyses and ab-initio calculation of the electronic and spin\nproperties of such a system, we identify a spin doublet ground state and\ndemonstrate that a spin-motion interaction can be engineered which enables\nground state cooling of the mechanical resonator. We also present a toolbox for\ninitialization, rotation, and readout of the defect spin qubit. As a result the\nproposed setup presents the possibility for studying a wide range of physics.\nTo illustrate its assets, we show that a fast and noise resilient preparation\nof a multicomponent cat state and a squeezed state of the mechanical resonator\nis possible; the latter is achieved by realizing the extremely detuned,\nultrastrong coupling regime of the Rabi model, where a phonon superradiant\nphase transition is expected to occur.\n", "  We measure statistically anisotropic signatures imprinted in\nthree-dimensional galaxy clustering using bipolar spherical harmonics (BipoSHs)\nin both Fourier space and configuration space. We then constrain a well-known\nquadrupolar anisotropy parameter $g_{2M}$ in the primordial power spectrum,\nparametrized by $P(\\vec{k}) = \\bar{P}(k) [ 1 + \\sum_{M} g_{2M} Y_{2M}(\\hat{k})\n]$, with $M$ determining the direction of the anisotropy. Such an anisotropic\nsignal is easily contaminated by artificial asymmetries due to specific survey\ngeometry. We precisely estimate the contaminated signal and finally subtract it\nfrom the data. Using the galaxy samples obtained by the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey Data Release 12, we find no evidence for violation of\nstatistical isotropy, $g_{2M}$ for all $M$ to be of zero within the $2\\sigma$\nlevel. The $g_{2M}$-type anisotropy can originate from the primordial curvature\npower spectrum involving a directional-dependent modulation $g_* (\\hat{k} \\cdot\n\\hat{p})^2$. The bound on $g_{2M}$ is translated into $g_*$ as $-0.09 < g_* <\n0.08$ with a $95\\%$ confidence level when $\\hat{p}$ is marginalized over.\n", "  We discuss the Matsuo-Cherednik type correspondence between the quantum\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated with $GL(N)$ and the $n$-particle\nquantum Ruijsenaars model, with $n$ being not necessarily equal to $N$. The\nquasiclassical limit of this construction yields the quantum-classical\ncorrespondence between the quantum spin chains and the classical Ruijsenaars\nmodels.\n", "  We determine the degeneracy factor and the average particle mass of particles\nthat produce the Lattice QCD pressure and specific entropy at zero baryon\nchemical potential. The number of states of the gluons and the quarks are found\nto converge above $T=$230 MeV to almost constant values, close to the number of\nstates of an ideal Quark-Gluon Phase, while their assigned masses retain high\nvalues. The number of states and the average mass of a system containing quarks\nin interaction with gluons are found to decrease steeply with increase of\ntemperature between $T \\sim 150$ and 160 MeV, a region contained within the\nregion of the chiral transition. The minimum value of the number of states\nwithin this temperature interval indicates that the states are of hadronic\nnature.\n", "  We consider a class of models of neutrino mixing with $S_4$ lepton flavour\nsymmetry combined with a generalised CP symmetry, which are broken to residual\n$Z_2$ and $Z_2 \\times H^\\nu_{\\rm CP}$ symmetries in the charged lepton and\nneutrino sectors, respectively, $H^\\nu_{\\rm CP}$ being a remnant CP symmetry of\nthe neutrino Majorana mass term. In this set-up the neutrino mixing angles and\nCP violation (CPV) phases of the neutrino mixing matrix depend on three real\nparameters - two angles and a phase. We classify all phenomenologically viable\nmixing patterns and derive predictions for the Dirac and Majorana CPV phases.\nFurther, we use the results obtained on the neutrino mixing angles and leptonic\nCPV phases to derive predictions for the effective Majorana mass in\nneutrinoless double beta decay.\n", "  Fluid-resistance limited transport of vesicles through narrow constrictions\nis a recurring theme in many biological and engineering applications. Inspired\nby the motor-driven movement of soft membrane-bound vesicles into closed\nneuronal dendritic spines, here we study this problem using a combination of\npassive three-dimensional simulations and a simplified semi-analytical theory\nfor active transport of vesicles that are forced through such constrictions by\nmolecular motors. We show that the motion of these objects is characterized by\ntwo dimensionless quantities related to the geometry and the strength of\nforcing relative to the vesicle elasticity. We use numerical simulations to\ncharacterize the transit time for a vesicle forced by fluid pressure through a\nconstriction in a channel, and find that relative to an open channel, transport\ninto a blind end leads to the formation of an effective lubrication layer that\nstrongly impedes motion. When the fluid pressure forcing is complemented by\nforces due to molecular motors that are responsible for vesicle trafficking\ninto dendritic spines, we find that the competition between motor forcing and\nfluid drag results in multistable dynamics reminiscent of the real system. Our\nstudy highlights the role of non-local hydrodynamic effects in determining the\nkinetics of vesicular transport in constricted geometries.\n", "  We propose a mechanism of ground-state blockade between two $N$-type Rydberg\natoms in virtue of Rydberg-antiblockade effect and Raman transition. Inspired\nby the quantum Zeno effect, the strong Rydberg antiblockade interaction plays a\nrole in frequently measuring one ground state of two, leading to a blockade\neffect for double occupation of the corresponding quantum state. By encoding\nthe logic qubits into the ground states, we efficiently avoid the spontaneous\nemission of the excited Rydberg state, and maintain the nonlinear\nRydberg-Rydberg interaction at the same time. As applications, we discuss in\ndetail the feasibility of preparing two-atom and three-atom entanglement with\nground-state blockade in closed system and open system, respectively, which\nshows that a high fidelity of entangled state can be obtained with current\nexperimental parameters.\n", "  Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) studies frequently observe a fine\nstructure in the local spectral function of the SU(2) Fermi-Hubbard model at\nhalf filling: In the metallic phase close to the Mott transition, subpeaks\nemerge at the inner edges of the Hubbard bands. Here we demonstrate that these\nsubpeaks originate from the low-energy effective interaction of doublon-holon\npairs, by investigating how the correlation functions of doublon and holon\noperators contribute to the subpeaks. A mean-field analysis of the low-energy\neffective Hamiltonian provides results consistent with our DMFT calculation\nusing the numerical renormalization group as an impurity solver. In the SU(3)\nand SU(4) Hubbard models, the subpeaks become more pronounced due to the\nincreased degeneracy of doublon-holon pair excitations.\n", "  An excited emitter decays by radiating a photon into a quantized mode of the\nelectromagnetic field, a process known as spontaneous emission. If the emitter\nis driven to a higher excited state, it radiates multiple photons in a cascade\ndecay. Atomic and biexciton cascades have been exploited as sources of\npolarization-entangled photon pairs. Because the photons are emitted\nsequentially, their intensities are strongly correlated in time, as measured in\na double-beam coincidence experiment. Perhaps less intuitively, their phases\ncan also be correlated, provided a single emitter is deterministically prepared\ninto a superposition state, and the emitted radiation is detected in a\nphase-sensitive manner and with high efficiency. Here we have met these\nrequirements by using a superconducting artificial atom, coherently driven to\nits second-excited state and decaying into a well-defined microwave mode. Our\nresults highlight the coherent nature of cascade decay and demonstrate a novel\nprotocol to generate entanglement between itinerant field modes.\n", "  We show that local Lorentz covariance arises canonically as the group of\ntransformations between local thermal states in the framework of Local Quantum\nPhysics, given the following three postulates: (i) Local observable algebras\nare finite-dimensional. (ii) Minimal local observable algebras are isomorphic\nto $\\mathbb{M}_2(\\mathbb{C})$, the observable algebra of a single qubit. (iii)\nThe vacuum restricted to any minimal local observable algebra is a\nnon-maximally mixed thermal state. The derivation reveals a new and surprising\nrelation between spacetime structure and local quantum states. In particular,\nwe show how local restrictions of the vacuum can determine the connection\nbetween different local inertial reference frames.\n", "  The LHCb has measured the ratios of $B\\to K^\\ast\\mu^+\\mu^-$ to $B\\to K^\\ast\ne^+ e^-$ branching fractions in two dilepton invariant mass squared bins, which\ndeviate from the Standard Model predictions by approximately $2.5\\sigma$. These\nnew measurements strengthen the hint of lepton flavor universality breaking\nwhich was observed earlier in $B\\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decays. In this work we\nexplore the possibility of explaining these anomalies within the framework of\n$R$-parity violating interactions. In this framework, $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$\ntransitions are generated through tree and one loop diagrams involving exchange\nof down-type right-handed squarks, up-type left-handed squarks and left-handed\nsneutrinos. We find that the tree level contributions are not enough to explain\nthe anomalies, but at one loop, simultaneous explanation of the deviations in\n$B\\to K^\\ast\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $B\\to K\\ell^+\\ell^-$ is feasible for a parameter\nspace of the Yukawa couplings that is consistent with the bounds coming from\n$B\\to K^{(\\ast)}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ and $D^0\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays and\n$B_s-\\bar{B}_s$ mixing.\n", "  In the last years several papers addressed the supposed spin-1 sector of the\nmassive Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation restricted to (1+1) space-time\ndimensions. In this note we show explicitly that this is a misleading approach,\nsince the DKP algebra in (1+1) dimensions admits only a spin-0 representation.\nOur result also is useful to understand why several recent papers found\ncoincident results for both spin-0 and spin-1 sectors of the DKP theory in\n(3+1) dimensions when the dynamics is restricted to one space dimension.\n", "  It is argued that the main results of the paper of Gibbons and Volkov (Phys.\nRev. D {\\bf 96}, 024053 (2017)) come from erroneous interpretations of the\nsurface $r=0$ in the Kerr and Kerr-(anti)de Sitter spacetimes.\n", "  We study the properties of $s$-wave superconductivity induced around a\nnematic quantum critical point in two-dimensional metals. The strong Landau\ndamping and the Cooper pairing between incoherent fermions have dramatic mutual\ninfluence on each other, and hence should be treated on an equal footing. This\nproblem is addressed by analyzing the self-consistent Dyson-Schwinger equations\nfor the superconducting gap and Landau damping rate. We solve the equations at\nzero temperature without making any linearization, and show that the\nsuperconducting gap is maximized at the quantum critical point and decreases\nrapidly as the system departs from this point. The interplay between nematic\nfluctuation and an additional pairing interaction, caused by phonon or other\nboson mode, is also investigated. The total superconducting gap generated by\nsuch interplay can be several times larger than the direct sum of the gaps\nseparately induced by these two pairing interactions. This provides a promising\nway to achieve remarkable enhancement of superconductivity.\n", "  We define the operations of conformal change and elementary deformation in\nthe setting of generalized complex geometry. Then we apply Swann's twist\nconstruction to generalized (almost) complex and Hermitian structures obtained\nby these operations and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nCourant integrability of the resulting twisted structures. In particular, we\nassociate to any appropriate generalized Kahler manifold (M, G, \\mathcal J )\nwith a Hamiltonian Killing vector field a new generalized Kahler manifold,\ndepending on the choice of a pair of non-vanishing functions and compatible\ntwist data. We study this construction when (M, G, \\mathcal J) is (diagonal)\ntoric, with emphasis on the four dimensional case. In particular, we apply it\nto deformations of the standard flat Kahler metric on C^{n}, the Fubini-Study\nKahler metric on CP^{2} and the so called admissible Kahler metrics on\nHirzebruch surfaces. As a further application, we recover the KK\n(Kahler-Kahler) correspondence, which is obtained by specializing to the case\nof an ordinary Kahler manifold.\n", "  We investigate the ballistic spreading behavior of the one-dimensional\ndiscrete time quantum walks whose time evolution is driven by any balanced\nquantum coin. We obtain closed-form expressions for the long-time variance of\nposition of quantum walks starting from any initial qubit (spin-$1/2$ particle)\nand position states following a delta-like (local), Gaussian and uniform\nprobability distributions. By averaging over all spin states, we find out that\nthe average variance of a quantum walk starting from a local state is\nindependent of the quantum coin, while from Gaussian and uniform states it\ndepends on the sum of relative phases between spin states given by the quantum\ncoin, being non-dispersive for a Fourier walk and large initial dispersion. We\nalso perform numerical simulations of the average probability distribution and\nvariance along the time to compare them with our analytical results.\n", "  Local chiral effective field theory interactions have recently been developed\nand used in the context of quantum Monte Carlo few- and many-body methods for\nnuclear physics. In this work, we go over detailed features of local chiral\nnucleon-nucleon interactions and examine their effect on properties of the\ndeuteron, paying special attention to the perturbativeness of the expansion. We\nthen turn to three-nucleon interactions, focusing on operator ambiguities and\ntheir interplay with regulator effects. We then discuss the nuclear Green's\nfunction Monte Carlo method, going over both wave-function correlations and\napproximations for the two- and three-body propagators. Following this, we\npresent a range of results on light nuclei: Binding energies and distribution\nfunctions are contrasted and compared, starting from several different\nmicroscopic interactions.\n", "  The optical properties of randomly positioned, resonant scatterers is a\nfundamentally difficult problem to address across a wide range of densities and\ngeometries. We investigate it experimentally using a dense cloud of rubidium\natoms probed with near-resonant light. The atoms are confined in a slab\ngeometry with a sub-wavelength thickness. We probe the optical response of the\ncloud as its density and hence the strength of the light-induced dipole-dipole\ninteractions are increased. We also describe a theoretical study based on a\ncoupled dipole simulation which is further complemented by a perturbative\napproach. This model reproduces qualitatively the experimental observation of a\nsaturation of the optical depth, a broadening of the transition and a blue\nshift of the resonance.\n", "  Sliding along frictional interfaces separating dissimilar elastic materials\nis qualitatively different from sliding along interfaces separating identical\nmaterials due to the existence of an elastodynamic coupling between interfacial\nslip and normal stress perturbations in the former case. This bimaterial\ncoupling has important implications for the dynamics of frictional interfaces,\nincluding their stability and rupture propagation along them. We show that\nwhile this bimaterial coupling is a monotonically increasing function of the\nbimaterial contrast, when it is coupled to interfacial shear stress\nperturbations through a friction law, various physical quantities exhibit a\nnon-monotonic dependence on the bimaterial contrast. In particular, we show\nthat for a regularized Coulomb friction, the maximal growth rate of unstable\ninterfacial perturbations of homogeneous sliding is a non-monotonic function of\nthe bimaterial contrast, and provide analytic insight into the origin of this\nnon-monotonicity. We further show that for velocity-strengthening\nrate-and-state friction, the maximal growth rate of unstable interfacial\nperturbations of homogeneous sliding is also a non-monotonic function of the\nbimaterial contrast. Results from simulations of dynamic rupture along a\nbimaterial interface with slip-weakening friction provide evidence that the\ntheoretically predicted non-monotonicity persists in non-steady, transient\nfrictional dynamics.\n", "  In the past 20 years, impressive progress has been made both experimentally\nand theoretically in superconducting quantum circuits, which provide a platform\nfor manipulating microwave photons. This emerging field of superconducting\nquantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in\nmicrowave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the\ninteraction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave\nphotons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong\ncoupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional\ncavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally\nobserved, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom\ninduced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to\nimproved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics,\nand speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting\nquantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and\ntheoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum\ncircuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this\nrapidly developing field.\n", "  Motivated by recent progress in the experimental manipulation of cold atoms\nin optical lattices, we study three different protocols for non-adiabatic\nquantum state preparation and state transport in chains of Rydberg atoms. The\nprotocols we discuss are based on the blockade mechanism between atoms which,\nwhen excited to a Rydberg state, interact through a van der Waals potential,\nand rely on single-site addressing. Specifically, we discuss protocols for\nefficient creation of an antiferromagnetic GHZ state, a class of matrix product\nstates including a so-called Rydberg crystal and for the state transport of a\nsingle-qubit quantum state between two ends of a chain of atoms. We identify\nsystem parameters allowing for the operation of the protocols on timescales\nshorter than the lifetime of the Rydberg states while yielding high fidelity\noutput states. We discuss the effect of positional disorder on the resulting\nstates and comment on limitations due to other sources of noise such as\nradiative decay of the Rydberg states. The proposed protocols provide a testbed\nfor benchmarking the performance of quantum information processing platforms\nbased on Rydberg atoms.\n", "  Nearly 150 massive black hole binary (MBHB) candidates at sub-pc orbital\nseparations have been reported in recent literature. Nevertheless, the\ndefinitive detection of even a single such object remains elusive. If at least\none of the black holes is accreting, the light emitted from its accretion disc\nwill be lensed by the other black hole for binary orbital inclinations near to\nthe line of sight. This binary self-lensing could provide a unique signature of\ncompact MBHB systems. We show that, for MBHBs with masses in the range 10^6 -\n10^10 solar masses and with orbital periods less than ~10 yr, strong lensing\nevents should occur in one to 10s of percent of MBHB systems that are monitored\nfor an entire orbit. Lensing events will last from days for the less massive,\nshorter period MBHBs up to a year for the most massive ~10 year orbital period\nMBHBs. At small inclinations of the binary orbit to the line of sight, lensing\nmust occur and will be accompanied by periodicity due to the relativistic\nDoppler boost. Flares at the same phase as the otherwise average flux of the\nDoppler modulation would be a smoking gun signature of self-lensing and can be\nused to constrain binary parameters. For MBHBs with separation >100\nSchwarzschild radii, we show that finite-sized source effects could serve as a\nprobe of MBH accretion disc structure. Finally, we stress that our lensing\nprobability estimate implies that ~10 of the known MBHB candidates identified\nthrough quasar periodicity should exhibit strong lensing flares.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of phase estimation in a lossy Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer (MZI) using two general, and practical, resources generated by a\nlaser and a nonlinear optical medium with passive optimal elements, which are\nreadily available in the laboratory: One is a two-mode separable coherent and\nsqueezed vacuum state at a beam splitter and the other is a two-mode squeezed\nvacuum state. In view of the ultimate precision given by quantum Fisher\ninformation, we show that the two-mode squeezed vacuum state can achieve a\nlower bound of estimation error than the coherent and squeezed vacuum state\nunder a photon-loss channel. We further consider practical measurement schemes,\nhomodyne detection and photon number resolving detection (PNRD), to\ncharacterize the accuracy of phase estimation in reality and find that the\ncoherent and squeezed vacuum state largely achieves a lower bound than the\ntwo-mode squeezed vacuum in the lossy MZI while maintaining quantum enhancement\nover the shot-noise limit. By comparing homodyne detection and PNRD, we\ndemonstrate that quadrature measurement with homodyne detection is more robust\nagainst photon loss than parity measurement with PNRD. We also show that double\nhomodyne detection can provide a better tool for phase estimation than single\nhomodyne detection against photon loss.\n", "  This paper is devoted to investigate the cylindrical collapse of an\nanisotropic fluid in $f(R)$ gravity. For this purpose, the viscous charged\nanisotropic fluid dissipating energy with heat flow and shear is assumed. We\nuse the perturbation scheme to develop the dynamical equations for the\nvariables that ultimately lead to the disturbance of the physical variables and\nthe Starobinksy like $f(R)$ model chosen. The evolution of the matter variables\nis discussed with the help of these equations. It can be concluded that the\nrange of dynamic instabilities depends on the field strength, density\ndistribution, pressure and the curvature term of the $f(R)$ model. We find that\nour results of Newtonian and post-Newtonian regimes reduce asymptotically to\ngeneral relativity solutions in the limiting case.\n", "  The traffic flow through a light signal is explored by using the optimal\nvelocity model and its improvement known as full velocity differences model.\nThe simulations consider a single line of identical cars, equally spaced, and\nwith no obstacles after the signal crossing line. The flow dependence on\nvehicle's characteristics, as it's length and sensitivity, are studied. Also,\nthe influence of the attitude of drivers (careful or aggressive) has been used\nas parameters on the present work. It was found that the optimal separation\nbetween cars, defined as the distance that allows the system to carry the\nhigher number of vehicles through the signal crossing line, is independent of\nthe sensitivity of the system, but it does depend on the aggressive or careful\ncharacteristic of the drivers. The optimal separation is also found to be\nproportional to the length of the cars for a system of identical vehicles.\n", "  In the summer of 2016, physicists gathered in Torun, Poland for the 48th\nannual Symposium on Mathematical Physics. This Symposium was special; it\ncelebrated the 40th anniversary of the discovery of the\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, which is widely used in\nquantum physics and quantum chemistry. This article forms part of a Special\nVolume of the journal Open Systems & Information Dynamics arising from that\nconference; and it aims to celebrate a related discovery -- also by Sudarshan\n-- that of Quantum Maps (which had their 55th anniversary in the same year).\nNowadays, much like the master equation, quantum maps are ubiquitous in physics\nand chemistry. Their importance in quantum information and related fields\ncannot be overstated. In this manuscript, we motivate quantum maps from a\ntomographic perspective, and derive their well-known representations. We then\ndive into the murky world beyond these maps, where recent research has yielded\ntheir generalisation to non-Markovian quantum processes.\n", "  In this paper we give an electrically charged traversable wormhole solution\nfor the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory when the dilaton is a phantom field,\ni.e. it has flipped sign kinetic term appearing in the action. In the limit\nwhen the charge is zero, we recover the anti-Fisher solution, which can be\nreduced to the Bronnikov-Ellis solution under certain choices of integration\nconstants. The equations of motion of this theory share the same S-duality\ninvariance of string theory, so the electrically charged solution is rotated\ninto the magnetically charged one by applying such transformations. The scalar\nfield is topological, so we compute its topological charge, and discuss that\nunder appropriate boundary conditions we can have a lump, a kink, or an\nanti-kink profile. We determine the position of the throat, and show the\nembedding diagram of the wormhole. As a physical application, we apply the\nGauss-Bonnet theorem to compute the deflection angle of a light-ray that passes\nclose to the wormhole.\n", "  We report a comparative study of rigid layer Raman-active modes in $N$-layer\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. Trigonal prismatic (2Hc, such as MoSe$_2$,\nMoTe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and distorted octahedral (1T', such as ReS$_2$ and\nReSe$_2$) phases are considered. The Raman-active in-plane interlayer shear\nmodes and out-of-plane interlayer breathing modes appear as well-defined\nfeatures with wavenumbers in the range 0-40~cm$^{-1}$. These rigid layer modes\nare well-described by an elementary linear chain model from which the\ninterlayer force constants are readily extracted. Remarkably, these force\nconstants are all found to be of the same order of magnitude. Finally, we show\nthat the prominent interlayer shear and breathing mode features allow\nhigh-precision hyperspectral Raman imaging of $N-$layer domains within a given\ntransition metal dichalcogenide flake.\n", "  Halide perovskites show unusual thermalisation kinetics for above bandgap\nphoto-excitation. We explain this as a consequence of excess energy being\ndeposited into discrete large polaron states. The cross-over between\nlow-fluence and high-fluence `phonon bottleneck' cooling is due to a Mott\ntransition where the polarons overlap ($n \\ge 10^{18}/\\mathrm{cm}^3$) and the\nphonon sub-populations are shared. We calculate the initial rate of cooling\n(thermalisation) from the scattering time in the Fr\\\"ohlich polaron model to be\n78 meVps$^{-1}$ for $\\mathrm{CH}_3\\mathrm{NH}_3\\mathrm{PbI}_3$. This rapid\ninitial thermalisation involves heat transfer into optical phonon modes coupled\nby a polar dielectric interaction. Further cooling to equilibrium over hundreds\nof picoseconds is limited by the ultra-low thermal conductivity of the\nperovskite lattice.\n", "  Usually $Z_2$ topological insulators are protected by time reversal symmetry.\nHere, we present a new type of $Z_2$ topological insulators in a cubic lattice\nwhich is protected by a novel hidden symmetry, while time reversal symmetry is\nbroken. The hidden symmetry has a composite antiunitary operator consisting of\nfractional translation, complex conjugation, sublattice exchange, and local\ngauge transformation. Based on the hidden symmetry, we define the\nhidden-symmetry polarization and $Z_2$ topological invariant to characterize\nthe topological insulators. The surface states have band structures with odd\nnumber of Dirac cones, where pseudospin-momentum locking occurs. When the\nhidden-symmetry-breaking perturbations are added on the boundaries, a gap opens\nin the surface band structure, which confirms that the topological insulator\nand the surface states are protected by the hidden symmetry. We aslo discuss\nthe realization and detection of this new kind of $Z_2$ topological insulator\nin optical lattices with ultracold atom techniques.\n", "  This paper investigates the energy bounds in modified Gauss-Bonnet gravity\nwith anisotropic background. Locally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type ${I}$\ncosmological model in $f(R,G)$ gravity is considered to meet this aim.\nPrimarily, a general $f(R,G)$ model is used to develop the field equations. In\nthis aspect, we investigate the viability of modified gravitational theory by\nstudying the energy conditions. We take in account four $f(R,G)$ gravity models\ncommonly discussed in the literature. We formulate the inequalities obtained by\nenergy conditions and investigate the viability of the above mentioned models\nusing the Hubble, deceleration, jerk and snap parameters. Graphical analysis\nshows that for first two $f(R,G)$ gravity models, NEC, WEC and SEC are\nsatisfied under suitable values of anisotropy and model parameters involved.\nMoreover, SEC is violated for the third and fourth models which predicts the\ncosmic expansion.\n", "  We construct generalised diffeomorphisms for E$_9$ exceptional field theory.\nThe transformations, which like in the E$_8$ case contain constrained local\ntransformations, close when acting on fields. This is the first example of a\ngeneralised diffeomorphism algebra based on an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra\nand an infinite-dimensional coordinate module. As a byproduct, we give a simple\ngeneric expression for the invariant tensors used in any extended geometry. We\nperform a generalised Scherk--Schwarz reduction and verify that our\ntransformations reproduce the structure of gauged supergravity in two\ndimensions. The results are valid also for other affine algebras.\n", "  The transmission rules of interparticle forces between granular particles\nwere analyzed, and a discrete packing model was proposed to calculate the\nstatic pressure at the bottom of granular material confined in a vertical\ncolumn. The mechanical analysis and numerical simulation results indicate that\nthe silo effect is caused by the frictional contacts between border particles\nand inner walls, the static pressure at the bottom depends on the external load\ninitially, and then tends to a saturation pressure (Pn) in an exponential form.\nThe saturation pressure (Pn) is positive linear related to the container radius\n(R) with the same granular matter and stacking manner. The saturation pressure\n(Pn) is directly proportional to the particle size (ra), and the increasing or\ndecreasing characteristic depends on the frictional property of inner walls,\nthe friction and stacking angle of grains. At last, the predictions of the\naforementioned model are compared with the experimental results from the\nliterature, and good agreement is achieved.\n", "  The first observation of the decay of a $B^0$ meson to a purely baryonic\nfinal state, $B^0 \\to p \\bar{p}$, is reported. The proton-proton collision data\nsample used was collected with the LHCb experiment at center-of-mass energies\nof 7 and 8 TeV and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$.\nThe branching fraction is determined to be $${\\cal B}(B^0 \\to p \\bar{p}) = (\n1.25 \\pm 0.27 \\pm 0.18 ) \\times 10^{-8} ,$$ where the first uncertainty is\nstatistical and the second systematic. The decay mode $B^0 \\to p \\bar{p}$ is\nthe rarest decay of the $B^0$ meson observed to date. The decay $B_s^0 \\to p\n\\bar{p}$ is also investigated. No signal is seen and the upper limit ${\\cal\nB}(B_s^0 \\to p \\bar{p}) < 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}$ at 90% confidence level is set on\nthe branching fraction.\n", "  We study the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetoconductivity in\ndiffusive cylindrical semiconductor nanowires. Following up on our former study\non tubular semiconductor nanowires, we focus in this paper on nanowire systems\nwhere no surface accumulation layer is formed but instead the electron wave\nfunction extends over the entire cross section. We take into account the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling resulting from a zinc-blende lattice and the\nRashba spin-orbit coupling, which is controlled by a lateral gate electrode.\nThe spin relaxation rate due to Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is found to\ndepend neither on the spin density component nor on the wire growth direction\nand is unaffected by the radial boundary. In contrast, the Rashba spin\nrelaxation rate is strongly reduced for a wire radius that is smaller than the\nspin precession length. The derived model is fitted to the data of\nmagnetoconductance measurements of a heavily doped back-gated InAs nanowire and\ntransport parameters are extracted. At last, we compare our results to previous\ntheoretical and experimental studies and discuss the occurring discrepancies.\n", "  Within the standard paradigm, dark energy is taken as a homogeneous fluid\nthat drives the accelerated expansion of the universe and does not contribute\nto the mass of collapsed objects such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. The\nabundance of galaxy clusters -- measured through a variety of channels -- has\nbeen extensively used to constrain the normalization of the power spectrum: it\nis an important probe as it allows us to test if the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel can indeed accurately describe the evolution of structures across\nbillions of years. It is then quite significant that the Planck satellite has\ndetected, via the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, less clusters than expected\naccording to the primary CMB anisotropies. One of the simplest generalizations\nthat could reconcile these observations is to consider models in which dark\nenergy is allowed to cluster, i.e., allowing its sound speed to vary. In this\ncase, however, the standard methods to compute the abundance of galaxy clusters\nneed to be adapted to account for the contributions of dark energy. In\nparticular, we examine the case of clustering dark energy -- a dark energy\nfluid with negligible sound speed -- with a redshift-dependent equation of\nstate. We carefully study how the halo mass function is modified in this\nscenario, highlighting corrections that have not been considered before in the\nliterature. We address modifications in the growth function, collapse\nthreshold, virialization densities and also changes in the comoving scale of\ncollapse and mass function normalization. Our results show that clustering dark\nenergy can impact halo abundances at the level of 10\\%--30\\%, depending on the\nhalo mass, and that cluster counts are modified by about 30\\% at a redshift of\nunity.\n", "  We report on experiments investigating the collisional properties of atoms at\nultralow collision energies using an all-optical atom collider. By using a pair\nof optical tweezers, we can manipulate two ultracold atom clouds and collide\nthem together at energies up to three orders of magnitude larger than their\nthermal energy. Our experiments measure the scattering of $\\rm ^{87}Rb$, $\\rm\n^{40}K$, and $\\rm ^{40}K$-$\\rm ^{87}Rb$ collisions. The versatility of our\ncollider allows us to probe both shape resonances and Feshbach resonances in\nany partial wave. As examples, we present experiments demonstrating p-wave\nscattering with indistinguishable fermions, inelastic scattering at non-zero\nenergies near a homonuclear Feshbach resonance, and partial wave interference\nin heteronuclear collisions.\n", "  We present spatially resolved ALMA images of CO J=3-2 emission from the\nprotoplanetary disk around HD100546. We model the spatially-resolved kinematic\nstructure of the CO emission. Assuming a velocity profile which prescribes a\nflat or flared emitting surface in Keplerian rotation, we uncover significant\nresiduals with a peak of $\\approx7\\delta v$, where $\\delta v = 0.21$ km\ns$^{-1}$ is the width of a spectral resolution element. The residuals reveal\nthe possible presence of a severely warped and twisted inner disk extending to\nat most 100au. Adapting the model to include a misaligned inner gas disk with\n(i) an inclination almost edge-on to the line of sight, and (ii) a position\nangle almost orthogonal to that of the outer disk reduces the residuals to $<\n3\\delta v$. However, these findings are contrasted by recent VLT/SPHERE,\nMagAO/GPI, and VLTI/PIONIER observations of HD100546 that show no evidence of a\nseverely misaligned inner dust disk down to spatial scales of $\\sim 1$au. An\nalternative explanation for the observed kinematics are fast radial flows\nmediated by (proto)planets. Inclusion of a radial velocity component at close\nto free-fall speeds and inwards of $\\approx 50$au results in residuals of\n$\\approx 4 \\delta v$. Hence, the model including a radial velocity component\nonly does not reproduce the data as well as that including a twisted and\nmisaligned inner gas disk. Molecular emission data at a higher spatial\nresolution (of order 10au) are required to further constrain the kinematics\nwithin $\\lesssim 100$au. HD100546 joins several other protoplanetary disks for\nwhich high spectral resolution molecular emission shows that the gas velocity\nstructure cannot be described by a purely Keplerian velocity profile with a\nuniversal inclination and position angle. Regardless of the process, the most\nlikely cause is the presence of an unseen planetary companion. (Abridged)\n", "  Rare $b \\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ flavour-changing-neutral-current processes provide\nimportant tests of the Standard Model of particle physics. Angular observables\nin exclusive $b \\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ processes can be particularly powerful as\nthey allow hadronic uncertainties to be controlled. Amongst the exclusive\nprocesses that have been studied by experiments, the decay $\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda\\ell^+\\ell^-$ is unique in that the $\\Lambda_b$ baryon can be produced\npolarised. In this paper, we derive an expression for the angular distribution\nof the $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\\ell^+\\ell^-$ decay for the case where the\n$\\Lambda_b$ baryon is produced polarised. This extends the number of angular\nobservables in this decay from 10 to 34. Standard Model expectations for the\nnew observables are provided and the sensitivity of the observables is explored\nunder a variety of new physics models. At low-hadronic recoil, four of the new\nobservables have a new short distance dependence that is absent in the\nunpolarised case. The remaining observables depend on the same short distance\ncontributions as the unpolarised observables, but with different dependence on\nhadronic form-factors. These relations provide possibilities for novel tests of\nthe SM that could be carried out with the data that will become available at\nthe LHC or a future $e^+e^-$ collider.\n", "  In a very interesting paper, Cunha, Berti, and Herdeiro have recently claimed\nthat ultra-compact objects, self-gravitating horizonless solutions of the\nEinstein field equations which have a light ring, must possess at least {\\it\ntwo} (and, in general, an even number of) light rings, of which the inner one\nis {\\it stable}. In the present compact paper we explicitly prove that, while\nthis intriguing theorem is generally true, there is an important exception in\nthe presence of degenerate light rings which, in the spherically symmetric\nstatic case, are characterized by the simple dimensionless relation $8\\pi\nr^2_{\\gamma}(\\rho+p_{\\text{T}})=1$ [here $r_{\\gamma}$ is the radius of the\nlight ring and $\\{\\rho,p_{\\text{T}}\\}$ are respectively the energy density and\ntangential pressure of the matter fields]. Ultra-compact objects which belong\nto this unique family can have an {\\it odd} number of light rings. As a\nconcrete example, we show that spherically symmetric constant density stars\nwith dimensionless compactness $M/R=1/3$ possess only {\\it one} light ring\nwhich, interestingly, is shown to be {\\it unstable}.\n", "  We give a self-contained derivation of the low-energy effective interactions\nof the SU($N$) Hubbard model, a multiflavor generalization of the one-band\nHubbard model, by using a generalized Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT).\nThe effective interaction of doublons and holons, which has been largely\nignored in previous SWT studies (e.g., the $t$-$J$ model), leads to distinct\npeaks in the local density of states. As shown by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n119, 236402 (2017)], this underlying effective doublon-holon interaction\nexplains the numerical observation of the subpeaks at the inner edges of the\nHubbard bands in the metallic phase close to the Mott transition.\n", "  We present an analysis of strong two-body decays of the $a_1(1420)$ with\n$J^{PC} = 1^{++}$ recently reported by the COMPASS Collaboration at CERN.\nFollowing the interpretation of the COMPASS Collaboration that the $a_1$ is an\nunusual state with a four-quark $q\\bar q s \\bar s$ structure we consider two\npossible configurations for this state --- hadronic molecular and color\ndiquark-antidiquark structures. We find that the dominant decay mode of the\n$a_1$ is the decay into $K$ and $K^*$. In particular, we calculate that the\nfour decay modes $a_1 \\to VP$ with $VP = K^{*\\pm}K^\\mp$, $K^{*0}\\bar K^0$,\n$\\bar K^{*0}K^0$ together give a dominant contribution to the measured total\nwidth of about 150 MeV. The observational mode $a_1 \\to f_0(980) + \\pi^0$ is\nsignificantly suppressed by one order of magnitude.\n", "  SHiP is a new general purpose fixed target experiment at the CERN SPS\ndesigned to complement LHC experiments in the search for new physics. In its\ninitial phase, the $400$ GeV proton beam extracted from the SPS will be dumped\non a heavy target with the aim of integrating $2\\times10^{20}$ pot in 5 years.\nShielded by an active muon shield, a dedicated detector, based on a long decay\nvolume followed by a spectrometer and particle identification detectors, will\nallow probing a variety of models with light long-lived exotic particles with\nmasses below $\\mathcal{O}(10)\\; \\mathrm{GeV}/{c^2}$. The main focus will be the\nphysics of the so-called Hidden Portals, i.e. search for Dark Photons, Light\nscalars and pseudo-scalars, and Heavy Neutral Leptons. The sensitivity to Heavy\nNeutral Leptons will allow for the first time to probe, in the mass range above\nthe kaon mass, a coupling range for which Baryogenesis and active neutrino\nmasses could also be explained. A dedicated emulsion-based detector will allow\ndetection of light dark matter in an unexplored parameter range.\n", "  Chiral superconductors support chiral edge modes and potentially spontaneous\nedge currents at their boundaries. Motivated by the putative multiband chiral\np-wave superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, we study the influence of the interference\nbetween different bands at the edges, which may appear in the presence of\nmoderate edge disorder or in edge tunneling measurements. We show that\ninterband interference can strongly modify the measurable quantities at the\nedges when the order parameter exhibits phase difference between the bands.\nThis is illustrated by investigating the edge dispersion and the edge current\ndistribution in the presence of interband mixing, as well as the conductance at\na tunneling junction. The results are discussed in connection with the putative\nchiral p-wave superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. In passing, we also discuss similar\ninterference effects in multiband models with other pairing symmetries.\n", "  We analyze space- and ground-based data for the old ($7.0\\pm0.3$~Gyr) solar\nanalogs 16 Cyg A and B. The stars were observed with the Cosmic Origins UV\nSpectrographs on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) on 23 October 2015 and 3\nFebruary 2016 respectively, and with the Chandra X-ray Observatory on 7\nFebruary 2016. Time-series data in \\ion{Ca}{2} data are used to place the UV\ndata in context. The UV spectra of 18 Sco (3.7$\\pm0.5$ Gyr), the Sun\n(4.6$\\pm0.04$ Gyr) and $\\alpha$ Cen A ($5.4_{-0.2}^{+1.2}$ Gyr), appear\nremarkably similar, pointing to a convergence of magnetic heating rates for G2\nmain-sequence stars older than $\\approx 2-4$ Gyr. But the B component's X-ray\n(0.3-2.5 keV) flux lies 20$\\times$ below a well-known minimum level reported by\nSchmitt. As reported for $\\alpha$~Cen~A, the coronal temperature probably lies\nbelow that detectable in soft X-rays. No solar UV flux spectra of comparable\nresolution to stellar data exist, but they are badly needed for comparison with\nstellar data. Center-to-limb (C-L) variations are re-evaluated for lines such\nas \\ion{Ca}{2} through to X-rays, with important consequences for observing\nactivity cycles in such features. We also call into question work that has\nmixed solar intensity-intensity statistics with flux-flux relations of stars.\n", "  Dwarf galaxy anomalies, such as their abundance and cusp-core problems,\nremain a prime challenge in our understanding of galaxy formation. The\ninclusion of baryonic physics could potentially solve these issues, but the\nefficiency of stellar feedback is still controversial. We analytically explore\nthe possibility of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies\nand compare AGN and supernova (SN) feedback. We assume the presence of an\nintermediate mass black hole within low mass galaxies and standard scaling\nrelations between the relevant physical quantities. We model the propagation\nand properties of the outflow and explore the critical condition for global gas\nejection. Performing the same calculation for SNe, we compare the ability of\nAGN and SNe to drive gas out of galaxies. We find that a critical halo mass\nexists below which AGN feedback can remove gas from the host halo and that the\ncritical halo mass for AGN is greater than the equivalent for SNe in a\nsignificant part of the parameter space, suggesting that AGN could provide an\nalternative and more successful source of negative feedback than SNe, even in\nthe most massive dwarf galaxies.\n", "  The basic concept of multi-dimensional limiting process (MLP) on unstructured\ngrids is inherited and modified for improving shock stabilities and reducing\nnumerical dissipation on smooth regions. A relaxed version of MLP condition,\nsimply named as weak-MLP, is proposed for reducing dissipation. Moreover, a\nstricter condition, that is the strict-MLP condition, is proposed to enhance\nthe numerical stability. The maximum/minimum principle is fulfilled by both the\nstrict- and weak-MLP condition. A differentiable pressure weight function is\napplied for the combination of two novel conditions, and thus the modified\nlimiter is named as MLP-pw(pressure-weighted). A series of numerical test cases\nshow that MLP-pw limiter has improved stability and convergence, especially in\nhypersonic simulations. Furthermore, the limiter also shows lower dissipation\nin regions without significant pressure transition. Therefore, MLP-pw limiter\ncan capture contact discontinuity and expansion accurately.\n", "  Properties of nuclear systems at subsaturation densities can be obtained from\ndifferent approaches. We demonstrate the use of the density autocorrelation\nfunction which is related to the isothermal compressibility and, after\nintegration, to the equation of state. This way we connect the Landau Fermi\nliquid theory well elaborated in nuclear physics with the approaches to dilute\nnuclear matter describing cluster formation. A quantum statistical approach is\npresented, based on the cluster decomposition of the polarization function. The\nfundamental quantity to be calculated is the dynamic structure factor.\nComparing with the Landau Fermi liquid theory which is reproduced in lowest\napproximation, the account of bound state formation and continuum correlations\ngives the correct low-density result as described by the second virial\ncoefficient and by the mass action law (nuclear statistical equilibrium). Going\nto higher densities, the inclusion of medium effects is more involved compared\nwith other quantum statistical approaches, but the relation to the Landau Fermi\nliquid theory gives a promising approach to describe not only thermodynamic but\nalso collective excitations and non-equilibrium properties of nuclear systems\nin a wide region of the phase diagram.\n", "  Large crystals of La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{1+x}$Cu$_2$O$_{6}$ (La-Ca-2126) with\n$x=0.10$ and 0.15 have been grown and converted to bulk superconductors by\nhigh-pressure oxygen annealing. The superconducting transition temperature,\n$T_c$, is as high as 55~K; this can be raised to 60~K by post-annealing in air.\nHere we present structural and magnetic characterizations of these crystals\nusing neutron scattering and muon spin rotation techniques. While the as-grown,\nnon-superconducting crystals are single phase, we find that the superconducting\ncrystals contain 3 phases forming coherent domains stacked along the $c$ axis:\nthe dominant La-Ca-2126 phase, very thin (1.5 unit-cell) intergrowths of\nLa$_2$CuO$_4$, and an antiferromagnetic La$_8$Cu$_8$O$_{20}$ phase. We propose\nthat the formation and segregation of the latter phases increases the Ca\nconcentration of the La-Ca-2126, thus providing the hole-doping that supports\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  Doping lithium-ion battery electrode materials LiMO$_2$ (M = Co, Ni, Mn) with\nimpurities has been shown to be an effective way to optimize their\nelectrochemical properties. Here, we report a detailed first-principles study\nof layered oxides LiCoO$_2$, LiNiO$_2$, and LiMnO$_2$ lightly doped with\ntransition-metal (Fe, Co, Ni, Mn) and non-transition-metal (Mg, Al) impurities\nusing hybrid-density-functional defect calculations. We find that the lattice\nsite preference is dependent on both the dopant's charge and spin states, which\nare coupled strongly to the local lattice environment and can be affected by\nthe presence of co-dopant(s), and the relative abundance of the host compound's\nconstituting elements in the synthesis environment. On the basis of the\nstructure and energetics of the impurities and their complexes with intrinsic\npoint defects, we determine all possible low-energy impurity-related defect\ncomplexes, thus providing defect models for further analyses of the materials.\nFrom a materials modeling perspective, these lightly doped compounds also serve\nas model systems for understanding the more complex, mixed-metal,\nLiMO$_2$-based battery cathode materials.\n", "  We report a detailed first-principles study of doping in Li$_2$MnO$_3$, in\nboth the dilute doping limit and heavy doping, using hybrid density-functional\ncalculations. We find that Al, Fe, Mo, and Ru impurities are energetically most\nfavorable when incorporated into Li$_2$MnO$_3$ at the Mn site, whereas Mg is\nmost favorable when doped at the Li sites. Ni, on the other hand, can be\nincorporated at the Li site and/or the Mn site, and the distribution of Ni over\nthe lattice sites can be tuned by tuning the materials preparation conditions.\nThere is a strong interplay between the lattice site preference and charge and\nspin states of the dopant, the electronic structure of the doped material, and\nthe delithiation mechanism. The calculated electronic structure and voltage\nprofile indicate that, in Ni-, Mo-, or Ru-doped Li$_2$MnO$_3$, oxidation occurs\non the electrochemically active transition-metal ion(s) before it does on\noxygen during the delithiation process. The role of the dopants is to provide\ncharge-compensation and bulk electronic conduction mechanisms in the initial\nstages of delithiation, hence enabling the oxidation of the lattice oxygen in\nthe later stages. This work thus illustrates how the oxygen-oxidation mechanism\ncan be used in combination with the conventional mechanism involving\ntransition-metal cations in design of high-capacity battery cathode materials.\n", "  Thermoelectric transport is traditionally analyzed using relations imposed by\ntime-reversal symmetry, ranging from Onsager's results to fluctuation relations\nin counting statistics. In this paper, we show that a recently discovered\nduality relation for fermionic systems -- deriving from the fundamental\nfermion-parity superselection principle of quantum many-particle systems --\nprovides new insights into thermoelectric transport. Using a master equation,\nwe analyze the stationary charge and heat currents through a weakly coupled,\nbut strongly interacting single-level quantum dot subject to electrical and\nthermal bias. In linear transport, the fermion-parity duality shows that\nfeatures of thermoelectric response coefficients are actually dominated by the\naverage and fluctuations of the charge in a dual quantum dot system, governed\nby attractive instead of repulsive electron-electron interaction. In the\nnonlinear regime, the duality furthermore relates most transport coefficients\nto much better understood equilibrium quantities. Finally, we naturally\nidentify the fermion-parity as the part of the Coulomb interaction relevant for\nboth the linear and nonlinear Fourier heat. Altogether, our findings hence\nreveal that next to time-reversal, the duality imposes equally important\nsymmetry restrictions on thermoelectric transport. As such, it is also expected\nto simplify computations and clarify the physical understanding for more\ncomplex systems than the simplest relevant interacting nanostructure model\nstudied here.\n", "  Entropy-driven equilibrium phase behaviour of hard particle dispersions can\nbe understood from excluded volume arguments only. While monodisperse hard\nspheres only exhibit a fluid-solid phase transition, anisotropic hard particles\nsuch as rods, discs, cuboids or boards exhibit various multi-phase equilibria.\nOrdering of such anisotropic particles increases the free volume entropy by\nreducing the excluded volume between them. The addition of depletants gives\nrise to an entropic patchiness represented by orientation-dependent attraction\nresulting in non-trivial phase behaviour. We show that free volume theory is a\nsimple, generic and tractable framework that enables to incorporate these\neffects and rationalise various experimental findings. Plate-shaped particles\nconstitute the main building blocks of clays, asphaltenes and chromonic liquid\ncrystals that find widespread use in the food, cosmetics and oil industry. We\ndemonstrate that mixtures of platelets and ideal depletants exhibit a\nstrikingly rich phase behaviour containing several types of three-phase\ncoexistence areas and even a quadruple region with four coexisting phases.\n", "  The observation of giant Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide\n$\\left(\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}\\right)$ up to a principal quantum number of $n=25$ by\nT.~Kazimierczuk \\emph{et al.} [Nature \\textbf{514}, 343, (2014)] inevitably\nraises the question whether these quasi-particles must be described within a\nmulti-polariton framework since excitons and photons are always coupled in the\nsolid. In this paper we present the theory of exciton-polaritons in\n$\\mathrm{Cu_{2}O}$. To this end we extend the Hamiltonian which includes the\ncomplete valence band structure, the exchange interaction, and the central-cell\ncorrections effects, and which has been recently deduced by F.~Schweiner\n\\emph{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~B \\textbf{95}, 195201, (2017)], for finite values of\nthe exciton momentum $\\hbar K$. We derive formulas to calculate not only dipole\nbut also quadrupole oscillator strengths when using the complete basis of\nF.~Schweiner \\emph{et al.}. Very complex polariton spectra for the three\norientations of $\\boldsymbol{K}$ along the axes $[001]$, $[110]$, and $[111]$\nof high symmetry are obtained and a strong mixing of exciton states is\nreported. The main focus is on the $1S$ ortho exciton-polariton, for which\npronounced polariton effects have been measured in experiments. We set up a\n$5\\times 5$ matrix model, which accounts for both the polariton effect and the\n$K$-dependent splitting, and which allows treating the anisotropic polariton\ndispersion for any direction of $\\boldsymbol{K}$. We especially discuss the\ndispersions for $\\boldsymbol{K}$ being oriented in the planes perpendicular to\n$[1\\bar{1}0]$ and $[111]$, for which experimental transmission spectra have\nbeen measured. Furthermore, we compare our results with experimental values of\nthe $K$-dependent splitting, the group velocity, and the oscillator strengths\nof this exciton-polariton.\n", "  We consider a very general class of theories, process theories, which capture\nthe underlying structure common to most theories of physics as we understand\nthem today (be they established, toy or speculative theories). Amongst these\ntheories, we will be focusing on those which are `causal', in the sense that\nthey are intrinsically compatible with the causal structure of space-time -- as\nrequired by relativity. We demonstrate that there is a sharp contrast between\nthese theories and the corresponding time-reversed theories, where time is\ntaken to flow backwards from the future to the past. While the former typically\nfeature a rich gamut of allowed states, the latter only allow for a single\nstate: eternal noise. We illustrate this result by considering of the\ntime-reverse of quantum theory. We also derive a strengthening of the result in\nPRL 108, 200403 on signalling in time-reversed theories.\n", "  We present a modified model for relativistic stars which are usually\nrepresented by perfect fluids. Fluctuations of the stress tensor act as source\nin the modified Einstein's equation, giving it a Langevin equation form. The\noccurrence of these fluctuations is attributed to the microphysics of the\ninterior of the star and their contribution to statistical properties of the\nfluid and the induced metric perturbations are argued to be of significance. We\nalso discuss the response of fluctuations of the stress tensor in the interior\nof the star and possible developments towards fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nissues in curved spacetime. The aim and further directions of research\nenvisioned are discussed intermittently throughout the manuscript and towards\nthe end.\n", "  The Alvarez-Macovski method [Alvarez, R. E and Macovski, A.,\n\"Energy-selective reconstructions in X-ray computerized tomography\", Phys. Med.\nBiol. (1976), 733--44] requires the inversion of the transformation from the\nline integrals of the basis set coefficients to measurements with multiple\nx-ray spectra. Analytical formulas for invertibility of the transformation from\ntwo measurements to two line integrals are derived. It is found that\nnon-invertible systems have near zero Jacobian determinants on a nearly\nstraight line in the line integrals plane. Formulas are derived for the points\nwhere the line crosses the axes, thus determining the line. Additional formulas\nare derived for the values of the terms of the Jacobian determinant at the\nendpoints of the line of non-invertibility. The formulas are applied to a set\nof spectra including one suggested by Levine that is not invertible as well as\nsimilar spectra that are invertible and voltage switched x-ray tube spectra\nthat are also invertible. An iterative inverse transformation algorithm\nexhibits large errors with non-invertible spectra.\n", "  We study the inference of the origin and the pattern of contamination in\nwater distribution networks. We assume a simplified model for the dyanmics of\nthe contamination spread inside a water distribution network, and assume that\nat some random location a sensor detects the presence of contaminants. We\ntransform the source location problem into an optimization problem by\nconsidering discrete times and a binary contaminated/not contaminated state for\nthe nodes of the network. The resulting problem is solved by Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming. We test our results on random networks as well as in the\nModena city network.\n", "  Experimental data on Coulomb breakup and neutron removal indicate that 31Ne\nis one of the heaviest halo nuclei discovered so far. The possible ground state\nof 31Ne is either 3/2- coming from p-wave halo or 1/2+ from s-wave halo. In\nthis work, we develop a treatable model to include deformed wave functions and\na dynamical knockout formalism which includes the dependence on the nuclear\norientation to study the neutron removal from 31Ne projectiles at energies\naround E=200 MeV/nucleon. A detailed account of the effects of deformation on\ncross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions is made. Our numerical\nanalysis indicates a preference for the 31Ne ground state with spin parity\n3/2-.\n", "  Among surprising results of NASA's Dawn spacecraft mission at dwarf planet\nCeres are enigmatic bright spots inside Occator crater and a lone tall pyramid\nmountain. Here we explain the appearance of such spots, weird mountains, and\nconcomitant craters on celestial bodies. The phenomenon is as follows. A\nmountain is ejected rotated out of mechanically stressed crust as a result of\nexplosive conical cleavage all over its buried surface. Then the mountain lands\nupside down i.e. summit up. It may save its integrity or split into parts to\nform mountains of smaller sizes and/or block debris. The process is a volcanic\ncaldera formation regime. We infer that it is the result of crack expansion and\nfracture of planetary crust due to inherent stresses. We scrutinize the\nprocesses' phenomenology on examples of Ceres' relief features. Pile-ups of\nbright substances are also synthesized in the course of the newly described\nphenomenon of explosive ejective orogenesis. Our analyses allow establish a\nviewpoint that is consistent with a broad range of observational data.\n", "  Until now only for specific crossovers between Poissonian statistics (P), the\nstatistics of a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), or the statistics of a\nGaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) analytical formulas for the level spacing\ndistribution function have been derived within random matrix theory. We\ninvestigate arbitrary crossovers in the triangle between all three statistics.\nTo this aim we propose an according formula for the level spacing distribution\nfunction depending on two parameters. Comparing the behavior of our formula for\nthe special cases of P$\\rightarrow$GUE, P$\\rightarrow$GOE, and\nGOE$\\rightarrow$GUE with the results from random matrix theory, we prove that\nthese crossovers are described reasonably. Recent investigations by\nF.~Schweiner~\\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. E~\\textbf{95}, 062205 (2017)] have shown\nthat the Hamiltonian of magnetoexcitons in cubic semiconductors can exhibit all\nthree statistics in dependence on the system parameters. Evaluating the\nnumerical results for magnetoexcitons in dependence on the excitation energy\nand on a parameter connected with the cubic valence band structure and\ncomparing the results with the formula proposed allows us to distinguish\nbetween regular and chaotic behavior as well as between existent or broken\nantiunitary symmetries. Increasing one of the two parameters, transitions\nbetween different crossovers, e.g., from the P$\\rightarrow$GOE to the\nP$\\rightarrow$GUE-crossover, are observed and discussed.\n", "  The MICROMEGAS (MICRO-MEsh GAseous Structure) charge amplification structure\nhas found wide use in many detection applications, especially as a gain stage\nfor the charge readout of Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). Here we report on\nthe behavior of a MICROMEGAS TPC when operated in a high-energy (up to 800 MeV)\nneutron beam. It is found that neutron-induced reactions can cause discharges\nin some drift gas mixtures that are stable in the absence of the neutron beam.\nThe discharges result from recoil ions close to the MICROMEGAS that deposit\nhigh specific ionization density and have a limited diffusion time. For a\nbinary drift gas, increasing the percentage of the molecular component (quench\ngas) relative to the noble component and operating at lower pressures generally\nimproves stability.\n", "  We propose a new method to search for axion-like particles (ALPs) based on\nthe gamma-rays produced concomitant with high-energy astrophysical neutrinos.\nThe existence of high-energy neutrinos implies production of gamma-rays in the\nsame sources. Photons can convert into ALPs in the sources' magnetic fields,\nand will travel as ALPs through extragalactic space. Back-conversion in the\nMilky Way's magnetic field leads to a diffuse anisotropic high-energy photon\nflux that existing and upcoming gamma-ray detectors, like HAWC, CTA, and LHAASO\ncan detect. This method probes unexplored ALP parameter space, with LHAASO\nbeing realistically sensitive to couplings above $10^{-11}\\, \\rm{GeV^{-1}}$ and\nmasses up to $3\\times 10^{-6} \\, \\rm{eV}$ in ten years. Our technique also\nexplores viable ALP dark matter parameter space.\n", "  The AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) survey consists of two survey projects:\nNEP-Deep (0.5 sq.deg) and NEP-Wide (5.4 sq.deg), providing with tens of\nthousands of galaxies. A continuous filter coverage in the mid-infrared\nwavelengths (7, 9, 11, 15, 18 and 24 $\\mu$m) is unique to diagnose the\ncontributions from dusty star-formation activity and AGNs. Here we present\ncurrent status focused on the newly obtained optical images and near-future\nprospects with a new X-ray telescope.\n  Hyper Suprime-Cam on Subaru telescope is a gigantic optical camera with huge\nField of View (FoV). Thanks to the wide FoV, we successfully obtained deep\noptical images at g, r, i, z and Y-bands covering most of the NEP-Wide field.\nUsing the deep optical images, we identified over 5000 optical counterparts of\nthe mid-IR sources, presumably deeply obscured galaxies in NEP-Wide field. We\nalso investigated properties of these infrared sources with SED-fitting.\n  eROSITA, to be launched early 2018, is a new all-sky X-ray survey telescope,\nand expected to conduct ultra deep 2-10 keV imaging toward NEP. We expect\nunprecedentedly numerous Compton-thick AGN candidates when combined with the\nmulti-wavelength data in NEP region.\n", "  Star-forming galaxies display a close relation among stellar mass,\nmetallicity and star-formation rate (or molecular-gas mass). This is known as\nthe fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) (or molecular-gas FMR), and it has a\nprofound implication on models of galaxy evolution. However, there still\nremains a significant residual scatter around the FMR. We show here that a\nfourth parameter, the surface density of stellar mass, reduces the dispersion\naround the molecular-gas FMR. In a principal component analysis of 29 physical\nparameters of 41,338 star-forming galaxies, the surface density of stellar mass\nis found to be the fourth most important parameter. The new four-dimensional\n(4D) fundamental relation forms a tighter hypersurface that reduces the\nmetallicity dispersion to 50% of that of the molecular-gas FMR. We suggest that\nfuture analyses and models of galaxy evolution should consider the FMR in a 4D\nspace that includes surface density. The dilution time scale of gas inflow and\nthe star-formation efficiency could explain the observational dependence on\nsurface density of stellar mass. AKARI is expected to play an important role in\nshedding light on the infrared properties of the new 4D FMR.\n", "  We present an improved photometric error analysis for the 7,100 CRTS\n(Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey) optical light curves for quasars from the\nSDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) Stripe 82 catalogue. The SDSS imaging survey\nhas provided a time-resolved photometric data set which greatly improved our\nunderstanding of the quasar optical continuum variability: Data for monthly and\nlonger time-scales are consistent with a damped random walk (DRW). Recently,\nnewer data obtained by CRTS provided puzzling evidence for enhanced\nvariability, compared to SDSS results, on monthly time-scales. Quantitatively,\nSDSS results predict about 0.06 mag root-mean-square (rms) variability for\nmonthly time-scales, while CRTS data show about a factor of 2 larger rms, for\nspectroscopically confirmed SDSS quasars. Our analysis has successfully\nresolved this discrepancy as due to slightly underestimated photometric\nuncertainties from the CRTS image processing pipelines. As a result, the\ncorrection for observational noise is too small and the implied quasar\nvariability is too large. The CRTS photometric error correction factors,\nderived from detailed analysis of non-variable SDSS standard stars that were\nre-observed by CRTS, are about 20-30%, and result in reconciling quasar\nvariability behaviour implied by the CRTS data with earlier SDSS results. An\nadditional analysis based on independent light curve data for the same objects\nobtained by the Palomar Transient Factory provides further support for this\nconclusion. In summary, the quasar variability constraints on weekly and\nmonthly time-scales from SDSS, CRTS and PTF surveys are mutually compatible, as\nwell as consistent with DRW model.\n", "  The fate of massive stars with initial masses >8M$_\\odot$ depends largely on\nthe mass-loss rate (\\mdot ) in the end stages of their lives. Red supergiants\n(RSGs) are the direct progenitors to Type II-P core collapse supernovae (SN),\nbut there is uncertainty regarding the scale and impact of any mass-loss during\nthis phase. Here we used near and mid-IR photometry and the radiative transfer\ncode DUSTY to determine luminosity and \\mdot\\ values for the RSGs in two\nGalactic clusters (NGC 7419 and $\\chi$ Per) where the RSGs are all of similar\ninitial mass ($M_{\\rm initial}$$\\sim$16M$_\\odot$), allowing us to study how\n\\mdot\\ changes with time along an evolutionary sequence. We find a clear, tight\ncorrelation between luminosity and \\mdot\\ suggesting the scatter seen in\nstudies of field stars is caused by stars of similar luminosity being of\ndifferent initial masses. From our results we estimate how much mass a\n16M$_\\odot$ star would lose during the RSG phase, finding a star of this mass\nwould lose a total of 0.61$^{+0.92}_{-0.31}$M$_\\odot$. This is much less than\nexpected for \\mdot\\ prescriptions currently used in evolutionary models.\n", "  In this research, we provide a new, efficient method to select infrared (IR)\nactive galatic nucleus (AGN). In the past, AGN selection in IR had been\nestablished by many studies using color-color diagrams. However, those methods\nhave a problem in common that the number of bands is limited. The AKARI North\nEcliptic Pole (NEP) survey was carried out by the AKARI Infrared Camera (IRC),\nwhich has 9 filters in mid-IR with a continuous wavelength coverage from 2 to\n24$\\mu$m$^{-1}$. Based on the intrinsic different mid-IR features of AGN and\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs), we performed SED fitting to separate these two\npopulations by the best-fitting model. In the X-ray AGN sample, our method by\nSED fitting selects 50$\\%$ AGNs, while the previous method by colour criteria\nrecovers only 30$\\%$ of them, which is a significant improvement. Furthermore,\nin the whole NEP deep sample, SED fitting selects two times more AGNs than the\ncolor selection. This may imply that the black hole accretion history could be\nmore stronger than people expected before.\n", "  In this paper, we have derived planar multilayer dyadic Greens functions by\nFourier expansion method and have checked its correctness by comparing results\nfor reflected electric fields from dipole emissions near such structures\navailable in previous literature. Furthermore, we show how these dyadic Greens\nfunctions can be applied to calculate reflected fields from a dipole source\nwith arbitrary orientations. We believe our formulation will be powerful in the\nmodeling of molecular fluorescence near these structures.\n", "  In the present report, we have investigated the effect of the low-frequency\nsignal on nanoscale memristor device. The frequency is varied from 2 Hz to 10\nHz and the corresponding effect on the current-voltage characteristics, time\ndomain state variable, charge-magnetic flux relation, memristance-charge\nrelation, memristance-voltage characteristics and memristance-magnetic flux\nrelation are studied. The results clearly suggested that the frequency of the\ninput stimulus plays an important role in the device dynamics.\n", "  We present a study of GaN single-nanowire ultraviolet photodetectors with an\nembedded GaN/AlN superlattice. The heterostructure dimensions and doping\nprofile were designed in such a way that the application of positive or\nnegative bias leads to an enhancement of the collection of photogenerated\ncarriers from the GaN/AlN superlattice or from the GaN base, respectively, as\nconfirmed by electron beam-induced current measurements. The devices display\nenhanced response in the ultraviolet A ($\\approx$ 330-360 nm) / B ($\\approx$\n280-330 nm) spectral windows under positive/negative bias. The result is\nexplained by correlation of the photocurrent measurements with scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy observations of the same single nanowire, and\nsemi-classical simulations of the strain and band structure in one and three\ndimensions.\n", "  We present IRAM/NOEMA and JVLA observations of the quasar J1342+0928 at\nz=7.54 and report detections of copious amounts of dust and [CII] emission in\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) of its host galaxy. At this redshift, the age of\nthe universe is 690 Myr, about 10% younger than the redshift of the previous\nquasar record holder. Yet, the ISM of this new quasar host galaxy is\nsignificantly enriched by metals, as evidenced by the detection of the [CII]\n158micron cooling line and the underlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum\nemission. To the first order, the FIR properties of this quasar host are\nsimilar to those found at a slightly lower redshift (z~6), making this source\nby far the FIR-brightest galaxy known at z>7.5. The [CII] emission is spatially\nunresolved, with an upper limit on the diameter of 7 kpc. Together with the\nmeasured FWHM of the [CII] line, this yields a dynamical mass of the host of\n<1.5x10^11 M_sun. Using standard assumptions about the dust temperature and\nemissivity, the NOEMA measurements give a dust mass of (0.6-4.3)x10^8 M_sun.\nThe brightness of the [CII] luminosity, together with the high dust mass, imply\nactive ongoing star formation in the quasar host. Using [CII]-SFR scaling\nrelations, we derive star formation rates of 85-545 M_sun/yr in the host,\nconsistent with the values derived from the dust continuum. Indeed, an episode\nof such past high star formation is needed to explain the presence of ~10^8\nM_sun of dust implied by the observations.\n", "  We used polarization-resolved Raman scattering to study the magneto-elastic\ncoupling in the parent compounds of several families of Fe-based\nsuperconductors (BaFe2As2, EuFe2As2, NaFeAs, LiFeAs, FeSe and LaFeAsO). We\nobserve an emergent Ag-symmetry As phonon mode in the XY scattering geometry\nwhose intensity is significantly enhanced below the magneto-structural\ntransition only for compounds showing magnetic ordering. We conclude that the\nsmall lattice anisotropy is insufficient to induce the in-plane electronic\npolarizability anisotropy necessary for the observed phonon intensity\nenhancement, and interpret this enhancement below the Neel temperature in terms\nof the anisotropy of the magnetic moment and magneto-elastic coupling. We\nevidence a Fano line- shape in the XY scattering geometry resulting from a\nstrong coupling between the Ag (As) phonon mode and the B2g symmetry-like\nelectronic continuum. Strong electron-phonon coupling may be relevant to\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  In computational materials science, mechanical properties are typically\nextracted from simulations by means of analysis routines that seek to mimic\ntheir experimental counterparts. However, simulated data often exhibit\nuncertainties that can propagate into final predictions in unexpected ways.\nThus, modelers require data analysis tools that (i) address the problems posed\nby simulated data, and (ii) facilitate uncertainty quantification. In this\nmanuscript, we discuss three case studies in materials modeling where careful\ndata analysis can be leveraged to address specific instances of these issues.\nAs a unifying theme, we highlight the idea that attention to physical and\nmathematical constraints surrounding the generation of computational data can\nsignificantly enhance its analysis.\n", "  We used polarization-resolved Raman scattering to study magneto-elastic\ncoupling in Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Au$_{x}$)$_2$As$_2$ crystals as a function of light\nAu-doping, materials for which temperatures of the structural transition\n($T_S$) and of the magnetic ordering transition ($T_N$) split. We study the\nappearance of the $A_g$(As)phonon intensity in the $XY$ scattering geometry\nthat is very weak just below $T_S$, but for which the intensity is\nsignificantly enhanced below $T_N$. In addition, the $A_g$(As) phonon shows an\nasymmetric line shape below $T_N$ and an anomalous linewidth broadening upon\nAu-doping in the magnetic phase. We demonstrate that the anomalous behavior of\nthe $A_g$(As) phonon mode in the $XY$ scattering geometry can be consistently\ndescribed by a Fano model involving the $A_g$(As) phonon mode interacting with\nthe $B_{2g}$ symmetry-like magnetic continuum in which the magneto-elastic\ncoupling constant is proportional to the magnetic order parameter.\n", "  A novel jet-stirred combustion chamber is designed to study turbulent\npremixed flames. In the new approach, multiple impinging turbulent jets are\nused to stir the mixture. It is well known that pair of counterflowing\nturbulent jets produces nearly a constant intensity along the jet axes. In this\nstudy, different numbers of impinging jets in various configurations are used\nto produce isotropic turbulence intensity. FLUENT simulations have been\nconducted to assess the viability of the proposed chamber. In order to be able\nto compare different configurations, three different non dimensional indices\nare introduces. Mean flow index, Homogeneity index, and Isotropicity index.\nUsing these indices one can compare various chambers including conventional\nFan-stirred Reactor. Results show that a concentric inlet/outlet chamber with 8\ninlets and 8 outlets with inlet velocity of 20 m/s and initial intensity of 15%\nproduces near zero mean flow and 2.5 m/s turbulence intensity which is much\nmore higher than reported values for Fan-stirred chamber.\n", "  Massive photon-like particles are predicted in many extensions of the\nStandard Model with a hidden sector where dark matter is secluded. They are\nvector bosons mediating the interaction between dark matter particles and can\nbe produced in scattering of ordinary particles through a faint mixing to the\nphoton. Most of the present experimental constraints on this \"dark photon\" (A')\nrely on the hypothesis of dominant decays to lepton pairs. The PADME experiment\nwill search for the e$^+$e$^- \\rightarrow \\gamma $A' process in a\npositron-on-target experiment, assuming a decay of the A' into invisible\nparticles of the hidden sector. The positron beam of the DA$\\Phi$NE Beam-Test\nFacility, at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of INFN, will be used. A\nfine-grained, high-resolution calorimeter will measure the momentum of the\nphoton in events with no other activity in the detector, thus allowing to\nmeasure the A' mass as the missing mass in the final state. In about one year\nof data taking, a sensitivity on the interaction strength ($\\varepsilon^2$\nparameter) down to $10^{-6}$ is achievable in the mass region\nM$_{\\text{A'}}<23.7~$MeV. The experiment is currently under construction and it\nis planned to take data in 2018. The status of PADME and its physics potential\nwill be reviewed.\n", "  A general solution for a coupled system of eikonal equations u_\\mu u_\\mu = 0,\nv_\\mu v_\\mu = 0, u_\\mu v_\\mu = 1 is presented, where lower indices designate\nderivatives, \\mu = 0, 1, 2 and summation is implied over the repeated indices.\nThis solution is of interest by itself due to wide applications of the eikonal\nequations, but the system considered also appears to be part of the reduction\nconditions for many equations of mathematical physics. We describe in detail\nthe procedure that allowed obtaining of the general solution using hodograph\nand contact transformations of the initial system, however, we omit here\nspecial case when the system is equivalent to a system for one space dimension\nor to a system for one dependent function. The procedure used allowed also\nobtaining of the general solution for a coupled system of the eikonal and\nHamilton-Jacobi equation.\n", "  Conjugation is a process in which bacteria exchange DNA through a physical\nconnection (conjugative junction) between mating cells. Despite its\nsignificance for processes such as the spread of antibiotic resistance, the\nrole of physical forces in conjugation is poorly understood. Here we use\ncomputer models to show that the conjugative junction not only serves as a link\nto transfer the DNA but it also mechanically stabilises the mating pair which\nsignificantly increases the conjugation rate. We discuss the importance of our\nfindings for biological evolution and suggest experiments to validate them.\n", "  This is an editorial to the special issue on Cosmic Dust IX.\n", "  We conjecture that the Fourier coefficients of a degree three Siegel form,\n$1/\\sqrt{\\chi_{18}}$, count the degeneracy of three-center BPS bound states in\ntype II string theory compactified on $K3 \\times T^2$. We provide evidence for\nour conjecture in the form of consistency with physical considerations of\nwall-crossing, holographic bounds, and the appearance of suitable counting\nfunctions (involving the inverse of the modular discriminant $\\Delta$ and the\ninverse of the Igusa cusp form $\\Phi_{10}$) in limits where the count\ndegenerates to involve single-center or two-center objects.\n", "  The effects of ground-state correlations on the dipole and quadrupole\nexcitations are studied for $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca using the extended random\nphase approximation (ERPA) derived from the time-dependent density-matrix\ntheory. Large effects of the ground-state correlations are found in the\nfragmentation of the giant quadrupole resonance in $^{40}$Ca and in the\nlow-lying dipole strength in $^{48}$Ca. It is discussed that the former is due\nto a mixing of different configurations in the ground state and the latter is\nfrom the partial occupation of the neutron single-particle states. The dipole\nand quadrupole strength distributions below 10 MeV calculated in ERPA are in\nqualitatively agreement with experiment.\n", "  We report superconductivity at 1.4K in the ternary SrPt$_{10}$P$_4$ with a\ncomplex new structure. SrPt$_{10}$P$_4$ crystallizes in a monoclinic\nspace-group C2/c (\\#15) with lattice parameters a= 22.9151(9)$\\AA$, b=\n13.1664(5)$\\AA$, c=13.4131(5)$\\AA$, and $\\beta$= 90.0270(5)${^\\circ}$. Bulk\nsuperconductivity in the samples has been demonstrated through resistivity, ac\nsusceptibility, and heat capacity measurements. High pressure measurements have\nshown that the superconducting T$_C$ is systematically suppressed upon\napplication of pressure, with a dT$_C$/dP coefficient of -0.016 K/GPa.\n", "  Holographic recording in Bi$_{12}$TiO$_{20}$ crystal at 1064 nm is\ninvestigated aiming the characterization of diffraction efficiency under action\nof applied dc electric field ($E_0$). An enhancement of 12-fold in the\ndiffraction efficiency was revealed when $E_0$ increased from 0.0 to 4.2 kV/cm.\nThe theoretical dependence of the diffraction efficiency upon $E_0$ was\ninvestigated using the standard model for photorefractivity and the results\nshowed a good experimental data fitting, allowing the computation of the\nacceptor concentration in the crystal of $\\approx$ $5.3\\times 10^{15}$\ncm$^{-3}$.\n", "  In this paper we consider a differential--difference system which is\nequivalent to the commutativity condition of two differential--difference\noperators. We study the rank two algebro--geometric solutions of this system.\n", "  We present a process for sculpting Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanoflakes into\napplication-relevant geometries using a high resolution transmission electron\nmicroscope. This process takes several minutes to sculpt small areas and can be\nused to cut the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ into wires and rings, to thin areas of the\nBi$_2$Se$_3$, and to drill circular holes and lines. We determined that this\nmethod allows for sub 10-nm features and results in clean edges along the\ndrilled regions. Using in-situ high-resolution imaging, selected area\ndiffraction, and atomic force microscopy, we found that this lithography\nprocess preserves the crystal structure of Bi$_2$Se$_3$. TEM sculpting is more\nprecise and potentially results in cleaner edges than does ion-beam\nmodification; therefore, the promise of this method for thermoelectric and\ntopological devices calls for further study into the transport properties of\nsuch structures.\n", "  Metasurfaces represent a new paradigm in artificial subwavelength structures\ndue to their potential to overcome many challenges typically associated with\nbulk metamaterials. The ability making very thin structures and change their\nproperties dynamically make metasurfaces an exceptional meta-optics platform\nfor engineering advanced electromagnetic and photonic metadevices. Here, we\nsuggest and demonstrate experimentally a novel tunable metasurface capable to\nenhance significantly the local image quality in magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI). We present a design of the hybrid metasurface based on\nelectromagnetically-coupled dielectric and metallic elements. We demonstrate\nhow to tailor the spectral characteristics of the metasurface eigenmodes by\nchanging dynamically the effective permittivity of the structure. By maximizing\na coupling between metasurface eigenmodes and transmitted and received fields\nin the MRI system, we enhance the device sensitivity that results in a\nsubstantial improvement of the image quality.\n", "  The segmented coronagraph design and analysis (SCDA) study is a coordinated\neffort, led by Stuart Shaklan (JPL) and supported by NASA's Exoplanet\nExploration Program (ExEP), to provide efficient coronagraph design concepts\nfor exoplanet imaging with future segmented aperture space telescopes. This\ndocument serves as an update on the apodized vortex coronagraph designs devised\nby the Caltech/JPL SCDA team. Apodized vortex coronagraphs come in two flavors,\nwhere the apodization is achieved either by use of 1) a gray-scale\nsemi-transparent pupil mask or 2) a pair of deformable mirrors in series. Each\napproach has attractive benefits. This document presents a comprehensive review\nof the former type. Future theoretical investigations will further explore the\nuse of deformable mirrors for apodization.\n", "  The energy-, density-, and isospin-dependent $\\Delta$-formation cross section\n$\\sigma_{N\\pi \\rightarrow \\Delta}^*$ and $\\Delta$-decay width are calculated\nbased on the relativistic BUU approach in which the effective mass splitting of\nnucleon and $\\Delta$ baryons in isospin-asymmetric matter is considered by the\ninclusion of the $\\delta$ meson exchange in the effective Lagrangian density.\nWith the density-dependent couplings for baryons of F. Hofmann et al., the\n$\\sigma_{N\\pi \\rightarrow \\Delta}^*$ is decreased (increased) moderately with\nincreasing density with (without) the consideration of the density dependent\npion effective mass. Meanwhile, if the invariant mass of the system is not far\nfrom the $\\Delta$ pole mass, the $\\Delta$-decay width is also weakly dependent\non density. The mass splitting effect of differently charged nucleon and\n$\\Delta$ baryons on $\\sigma_{N\\pi \\rightarrow \\Delta}^*$ are found to be more\nobvious than that of pion mesons but much weaker than the mass splitting in the\nhard $\\Delta$ production channel $NN\\rightarrow N\\Delta$. Further, the largest\nmass-splitting influence is seen in the $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow \\Delta^0$ and\n$\\pi^+n\\rightarrow \\Delta^+$ channels but not in the production of $\\Delta^-$\nand $\\Delta^{++}$ isobars.\n", "  There is an increasing recognition regarding of the importance of introducing\nmodern Einsteinian concepts early in science education. This study investigates\nthe efficacy of an innovative educational programme \"Einstein-First\", which\nfocuses on teaching Einsteinian physics at an earlier age than usual through\nthe incorporation of appropriate hands-on activities. This paper presents an\nanalysis of 14 to 15-year-old students' conceptualisation of Einsteinian\nphysics and their attitudes towards science as a result of this programme. We\nhave investigated the students' understanding of modern physics concept after a\nterm of 20 lessons. We report on two such 20-lesson programmes, one delivered\nin 2013 and a second, improved programme delivered in 2014; each to 50-60\nstudents across two classes designated by the participating high school as\n\"academically talented\" students. We found, as expected, that the students'\npossessed little prior knowledge of Einsteinian physics. the significant\nimprovement in the students' knowledge, as tested before and after the course,\nshowed that they could comprehend Einsteinian physics at the level it was\ngiven. The findings also showed that the short programme improved students'\nattitude towards physics.While the male students initially showed greater\ninterest in physics compared to their female counterparts, the female students\nshowed a significantly increased interest in physics after the programme. Also,\nstudents' memory retention of Einsteinian physics concepts was tested in two\ndifferent years, one class was tested after one year of the programmes and the\nother was tested after three years of the programme. The results show that the\nEinstein-First programme had a lasting impact on the students involved in the\nstudy.\n", "  For safety reasons, it is important that the design of buildings and public\nfacilities comply with the guidelines compiled in building codes.The latter are\noften premised on the concept of exit capacity, \\emph{i.e.}, the mean\npedestrian flow rate through a bottleneck (at congestion). Here, we argue that\none should duly take into account the evacuation time fluctuations when\ndevising these guidelines. This is particularly true when the narrowing\nisabrupt and the crowd may behave competitively. We suggest a simple way to\nassess the extent of (part of) these fluctuations on the basis of the\nstatistics of time gaps between successive escapes through the\nconsideredbottleneck, which in practice could be garnered by analysing\nrecordings of future real evacuations or, perhaps, realistic drills (in the\nlimits of what is ethically possible). We briefly present a test of the\nproposed strategy using a cellular automaton model and confirm its validity\nunder some conditions, but alsodisclose some of its limitations. In particular,\nit may severely underestimate fluctuations in the presence of strong\ncorrelations in the pedestrians' behaviours(while still performing better than\nonly the mean capacity).\n", "  Detailed characterization of damage and rupture mechanics of arteries is one\nthe current challenges in vascular biomechanics, which requires developing\nsuitable experimental approaches. This paper introduces an approach using in\nsitu tensile tests in an X-ray micro-tomography setup to observe mechanisms of\ndamage initiation and progression in medial layers of porcine aortic samples.\nThe technique requires the use of sodium polytungstate as a contrast agent, of\nwhich the conditions for use are detailed in this paper. Immersion of the\nsamples during 24 hours in a 15 g.L-1 concentrated solution provided the best\ncompromise for viewing musculo-elastic units in this tissue. The process of\ndamage initiation, delamination and rupture of medial tissue under tensile\nloading was observed and can be described as an elementary process repeating\nseveral times until complete failure. This elementary process initiates with a\nsudden mode I fracture of a group of musculo-elastic units, followed by an\nelastic recoil of these units, causing mode II separation of these, hence a\ndelamination plane. The presented experimental approach constitutes a basis for\nobservation of other constituents, or for investigations on other tissues and\ndamage mechanisms.\n", "  Given a nonlinear evolution equation in (1+n) dimensions, which has spatially\nextended traveling wave solutions, it can be extended into a system of two\ncoupled equations, one of which generates the original traveling waves, and the\nother generates structures that are localized in the vicinity of the\nintersections of the traveling waves. This is achieved thanks to the\nobservation that, as a direct consequence of the original evolution equation, a\nfunctional of its solution exists, which vanishes identically on the\nsingle-wave solution. This functional maps any multi-wave solution onto a\nstructure that is confined to the vicinity of wave intersections. In the case\nof solitons in (1+1) dimensions, the structure is a collection of humps\nlocalized in the vicinity of soliton intersections. In higher space dimensions\nthese structures move in space. For example, a two-front system in (1+3)\ndimensions is mapped onto an infinitely long and laterally bounded rod, which\nmoves in a direction perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. The coupled\nsystems corresponding to several known evolution equations in (1+1), (1+2) and\n(1+3) dimensions are reviewed.\n", "  The hydrogen abstraction reaction between H and H$_2$S, yielding HS and H$_2$\nas products, has been studied within the framework of interstellar surface\nchemistry. High-temperature rate constants up to 2000 K are calculated in the\ngas phase and are in agreement with previously reported values. Subsequently\nlow-temperature rate constants down to 55 K are presented for the first time\nthat are of interest to astrochemistry, i.e., covering both bimolecular and\nunimolecular reaction mechanisms. For this, a so-called implicit surface model\nis used. Strictly speaking, this is a structural gas-phase model in which the\nrestriction of the rotation in the solid state is taken into account. The\ncalculated kinetic isotope effects are explained in terms of difference in\nactivation and delocalization. All rate constants are calculated at the\nUCCSD(T)-F12/cc-VTZ-F12 level of theory. Finally, we show that the energetics\nof the reaction is only affected to a small extent by the presence of H$_2$O or\nH$_2$S molecular clusters that simulate an ice surface, calculated at the\nMPWB1K/def2-TZVP level of theory.\n", "  We present results for in-medium spectral functions obtained within the\nFunctional Renormalization Group framework. The analytic continuation from\nimaginary to real time is performed in a well-defined way on the level of the\nflow equations. Based on this recently developed method, results for the sigma\nand the pion spectral function for the quark-meson model are shown at finite\ntemperature, finite quark-chemical potential and finite spatial momentum. It is\nshown how these spectral function become degenreate at high temperatures due to\nthe restoration of chiral symmetry. In addition, results for vector- and\naxial-vector meson spectral functions are shown using a gauged linear sigma\nmodel with quarks. The degeneration of the $\\rho$ and the $a_1$ spectral\nfunction as well as the behavior of their pole masses is discussed.\n", "  Topological line defects in graphene represent an ideal way to produce highly\ncontrolled structures with reduced dimensionality that can be used in\nelectronic devices. In this work we propose using extended line defects in\ngraphene to improve nucleobase selectivity in nanopore-based DNA sequencing\ndevices. We use a combination of QM/MM and non-equilibrium Green's functions\nmethods to investigate the conductance modulation, fully accounting for solvent\neffects. By sampling over a large number of different orientations generated\nfrom molecular dynamics simulations, we theoretically demonstrate that\ndistinguishing between the four nucleobases using line defects in a\ngraphene-based electronic device appears possible. The changes in conductance\nare associated with transport across specific molecular states near the Fermi\nlevel and their coupling to the pore. Through the application of a specifically\ntuned gate voltage, such a device would be able to discriminate the four types\nof nucleobases more reliably than that of graphene sensors without topological\nline defects.\n", "  Measuring the unknown neutrino oscillation parameters is one of the main aims\nin neutrino physics today. The measurement of these parameters is severely\naffected by the presence of degeneracies in the parameter space. Various\nneutrino oscillation projects have been proposed to measure them. In this\noverview talk, we will discuss some of the proposed neutrino experiments and\nthe synergies between them that can enhance their future physics reach.\n", "  All carbon materials, e.g., amorphous carbon (a-C) coatings and C60 fullerene\nthin films, play an important role in short-wavelength free-electron laser\n(FEL) research motivated by FEL optics development and prospective\nnanotechnology applications. Responses of a-C and C60 layers to the extreme\nultraviolet (SPring-8 Compact SASE Source in Japan) and soft x-ray\n(free-electron laser in Hamburg) free-electron laser radiation are investigated\nby Raman spectroscopy, differential interference contrast, and atomic force\nmicroscopy. A remarkable difference in the behavior of covalent (a-C) and\nmolecular (C60) carbonaceous solids is demonstrated under these irradiation\nconditions. Low thresholds for ablation of a fullerene crystal (estimated to be\naround 0.15 eV/atom for C60 vs 0.9 eV/atom for a-C in terms of the absorbed\ndose) are caused by a low cohesive energy of fullerene crystals. An efficient\nmechanism of the removal of intact C60 molecules from the irradiated crystal\ndue to Coulomb repulsion of fullerene-cage cation radicals formed by the\nionizing radiation is revealed by a detailed modeling.\n", "  We determine, by hierarchy, dependencies between higher order linear\nsymmetries which occur when generating them using recursion operators. Thus, we\ndeduce a formula which gives the number of independent generalized symmetries\n(basis) of several orders. We construct a basis for conservation laws (with\nrespect to the group admitted by the system of differential equation) and hence\ngenerate infinite conservation laws in each equivalence class.\n", "  The outer Galaxy beyond the Outer Arm provides a good opportunity to study\nstar formation in an environment significantly different from that in the solar\nneighborhood. However, star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy have never been\ncomprehensively studied or cataloged because of the difficulties in detecting\nthem at such large distances. We studied 33 known young star-forming regions\nassociated with 13 molecular clouds at $R_{\\rm G}$ $\\ge$ 13.5 kpc in the outer\nGalaxy with data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)\nmid-infrared all-sky survey. From their color distribution, we developed a\nsimple identification criterion of star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy\nwith the WISE color. We applied the criterion to all the WISE sources in the\nmolecular clouds in the outer Galaxy at $R_{\\rm G}$ $\\ge$ 13.5 kpc detected\nwith the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO) $^{12}$CO survey of\nthe outer Galaxy, of which the survey region is 102$^\\circ$.49 $\\le$ $l$ $\\le$\n141$^\\circ$.54, $-$3$^\\circ$.03 $\\le$ $b$ $\\le$ 5$^\\circ$.41, and successfully\nidentified 711 new candidate star-forming regions in 240 molecular clouds. The\nlarge number of samples enables us to perform the statistical study of\nstar-formation properties in the outer Galaxy for the first time. This study is\ncrucial to investigate the fundamental star-formation properties, including\nstar-formation rate, star-formation efficiency, and initial mass function, in a\nprimordial environment such as the early phase of the Galaxy formation.\n", "  Mixed-order phase transitions display a discontinuity in the order parameter\nlike first-order transitions yet feature critical behavior like second-order\ntransitions. Such transitions have been predicted for a broad range of\nequilibrium and nonequilibrium systems, but their experimental observation has\nremained elusive. Here, we analytically predict and experimentally realize a\nmixed-order equilibrium phase transition. Specifically, a discontinuous\nsolid-solid transition in a two-dimensional crystal of paramagnetic colloidal\nparticles is induced by a magnetic field $H$. At the transition field\n$H_{\\text{s}}$, the energy landscape of the system becomes completely flat,\nwhich causes diverging fluctuations and correlation length $\\xi\\propto | H^2 -\nH_{\\text{s}}^2|^{-1/2}$. Mean-field critical exponents are predicted, since the\nupper critical dimension of the transition is $d_{\\text{u}}=2$. Our colloidal\nsystem provides an experimental test bed to probe the unconventional properties\nof mixed-order phase transitions.\n", "  We study the condensation of exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb\nlattice of micropillars. We show selective polariton condensation into the\nflatbands formed by S and P$_{x;y}$ orbital modes of the micropillars under\nnon-resonant laser excitation. The real space mode patterns of these\ncondensates are accurately reproduced by the calculation of related Bloch modes\nof S- and P-flatbands. Our work emphasizes the potential of exciton-polariton\nlattices to emulate Hamiltonians of advanced potential landscapes. Furthermore,\nthe obtained results provide a deeper inside into the physics of flatbands\nknown mostly within the tight-binding limit.\n", "  In this note we present explicit and elementary formulas for the\ncorrespondence between the group of special Lorentz transformation $SO^+(3,1)$,\non the one hand, and its spin group $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$, on the other hand.\nAlthough we will not mention Clifford algebra terminology explicitly, it is\nhidden in our calculations by using complex $2\\times2$-matrices. Nevertheless,\nour calculations are strongly motivated by the Clifford algebra\n$\\mathfrak{gl}(4,\\mathbb{C})$ of four-dimensional space-time.\n", "  At the time of the 10th International Workshop on Top Quark Physics\n(TOP2017), top quark physics is a very dynamic research area. Thanks to the\nunprecedentedly fast accumulation of high-energy data at the LHC during the\nongoing Run~2, statistical starvation is a matter of the past for most of the\ntraditional top-quark analyses, that are now experiencing the luxury of having\nto worry about how to punch through the \"Systematics Wall\" and maximize the\nutility of their data. New processes involving top quarks are being studied for\nthe first time, and the good old pair-production processes are being explored\nin unusual settings, such as collisions involving heavy ions, or \"reference\ndata\" collected by the LHC at relatively low centre-of-mass energy. The TOP2017\nconference featured 37 talks delivered by experimental physicists, including\nseven in the \"Young Scientists Forum\" where young colleagues were given the\nopportunity to elaborate more deeply than usual on their own work. As it is\nimpossible to do justice to all the experimental results presented at this\nconference while staying within a reasonable length, this document contains a\nvery biased selection, mostly based on the personal taste of the author.\n", "  The origin of cycle-to-cycle variations in solar activity is currently the\nfocus of much interest. It has recently been pointed out that large individual\nactive regions with atypical properties can have a significant impact on the\nlong term behaviour of solar activity. We investigate this possibility in more\ndetail using a recently developed 2$\\times$2D dynamo model of the solar\nmagnetic cycle. We find that even a single \"rogue\" bipolar magnetic region\n(BMR) in the simulations can have a major effect on the further development of\nsolar activity cycles, boosting or suppressing the amplitude of subsequent\ncycles. In extreme cases an individual BMR can completely halt the dynamo,\ntriggering a grand minimum. Rogue BMRs also have the potential to induce\nsignificant hemispheric asymmetries in the solar cycle. To study the effect of\nrogue BMRs in a more systematic manner, a series of dynamo simulations were\nconducted, in which a large test BMR was manually introduced in the model at\nvarious phases of cycles of different amplitudes. BMRs emerging in the rising\nphase of a cycle can modify the amplitude of the ongoing cycle while BMRs\nemerging in later phases will only impact subsequent cycles. In this model, the\nstrongest impact on the subsequent cycle occurs when the rogue BMR emerges\naround cycle maximum at low latitudes but the BMR does not need to be strictly\ncross-equatorial. Active regions emerging as far as $20^{\\circ}$ from the\nequator can still have a significant impact. We demonstrate that the combined\neffect of the magnetic flux, tilt angle and polarity separation of the BMR on\nthe dynamo is via their contribution to the dipole moment, $\\delta\nD_{\\mathrm{BMR}}$. Our results indicate that prediction of the amplitude,\nstarting epoch and duration of a cycle requires an accurate accounting of a\nbroad range of active regions emerging in the previous cycle.\n", "  The chemical composition of a planetary body reflects its starting conditions\nmodified by numerous processes during its formation and geological evolution.\nMeasurements by X-ray, gamma-ray, and neutron spectrometers on the MESSENGER\nspacecraft revealed Mercury's surface to have surprisingly high abundances of\nthe moderately volatile elements sodium, sulfur, potassium, chlorine, and\nthorium, and a low abundance of iron. This composition rules out some formation\nmodels for which high temperatures are expected to have strongly depleted\nvolatiles and indicates that Mercury formed under conditions much more reducing\nthan the other rocky planets of our Solar System. Through geochemical modeling\nand petrologic experiments, the planet's mantle and core compositions can be\nestimated from the surface composition and geophysical constraints. The bulk\nsilicate composition of Mercury is likely similar to that of enstatite or\nmetal-rich chondrite meteorites, and the planet's unusually large core is most\nlikely Si rich, implying that in bulk Mercury is enriched in Fe and Si (and\npossibly S) relative to the other inner planets. The compositional data for\nMercury acquired by MESSENGER will be crucial for quantitatively testing future\nmodels of the formation of Mercury and the Solar System as a whole, as well as\nfor constraining the geological evolution of the innermost planet.\n", "  The concept of Lefschetz thimble decomposition is one of the most promising\npossible modifications of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms aimed at\nalleviating the sign problem which appears in many interesting physical\nsituations, e.g. in the Hubbard model away from half filling. In this approach\none utilizes the fact that the integral over real variables with an integrand\ncontaining a complex fluctuating phase is equivalent to the sum of integrals\nover special manifolds in complex space (\"Lefschetz thimbles\"), each of them\nhaving a fixed complex phase factor. Thus, the sign problem can be reduced if\nthe resulting sum contains terms with only a few different phases. We explore\nthe complexity of the sign problem for the few-site Hubbard model on square\nlattice combining a semi-analytical study of saddle points and thimbles in\nsmall lattices with several steps in Euclidean time with results of test QMC\ncalculations. We check different variants of conventional Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation based on Gaussian integrals. On the basis of our analysis we\nreveal a regime with minimal number of relevant thimbles in the vicinity of\nhalf filling. In this regime we found only two relevant thimbles for the\nfew-site lattices studied in the paper. There is also indirect evidence of the\nexistence of this regime in more realistic systems with large number of\nEuclidean time slices. In addition, we derive a new non-Gaussian representation\nof the interaction term, where the number of relevant Lefschetz is also reduced\nin comparison with conventional Gaussian Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.\n", "  Rare-earth phosphors exhibit unique luminescence polarization features\noriginating from the anisotropic symmetry of the emitter ion's chemical\nenvironment. However, to take advantage of this peculiar property, it is\nnecessary to control and measure the ensemble orientation of the host particles\nwith a high degree of precision. Here, we show a methodology to obtain the\nphotoluminescence polarization of Eu-doped LaPO4 nano rods assembled in an\nelectrically modulated liquid-crystalline phase. We measure Eu3+ emission\nspectra for the three main optimal configurations ({\\sigma}, {\\pi} and\n{\\alpha}, depending on the direction of observation and the polarization axes)\nand use them as a reference for the nano rod orientation analysis. Based on the\nfact that flowing nano rods tend to orient along the shear strain profile, we\nuse this orientation analysis to measure the local shear rate in a flowing\nliquid. The potential of this approach is then demonstrated through tomographic\nimaging of the shear rate distribution in a microfluidic system.\n", "  In magnetically confined plasmas used in Tokamak, turbulence is responsible\nfor specific transport that limits the performance of this kind of reactors.\nGyrokinetic simulations are able to capture ion and electron turbulence that\ngive rise to heat losses, but require also state-of-the-art HPC techniques to\nhandle computation costs. Such simulations are a major tool to establish good\noperating regime in Tokamak such as ITER, which is currently being built. Some\nof the key issues to address more realistic gyrokinetic simulations are:\nefficient and robust numerical schemes, accurate geometric description, good\nparallelization algorithms. The framework of this work is the Semi-Lagrangian\nsetting for solving the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation and the Gyseka code. In\nthis paper, a new variant for the interpolation method is proposed that can\nhandle the mesh singularity in the poloidal plane at r=0 (polar system is used\nfor the moment in Gysela). A non-uniform meshing of the poloidal plane is\nproposed instead of uniform one in order to save memory and computations. The\ninterpolation method, the gyroaverage operator, and the Poisson solver are\nrevised in order to cope with non-uniform meshes. A mapping that establish a\nbijection from polar coordinates to more realistic plasma shape is used to\nimprove realism. Convergence studies are provided to establish the validity and\nrobustness of our new approach.\n", "  A spectral line survey of IRC +10216 between 13.3 and 18.5 GHz is carried out\nusing the Shanghai Tian Ma 65 m Radio Telescope (TMRT-65m) with a sensitivity\nof < 7 mK. Thirty-five spectral lines of 12 different molecules and radicals\nare detected in total. Except for SiS, the detected molecules are all\ncarbon-chain molecules, including HC3N, HC5N, HC7N, HC9N, C6H, C6H-, C8H, SiC2,\nSiC4, c-C3H2 and l-C5H. The presence of rich carbon-bearing molecules is\nconsistent with the identity of IRC +10216 as a carbon-rich AGB star. The\nexcitation temperatures and column densities of the observed species are\nderived by assuming a local thermodynamic equilibrium and homogeneous\nconditions.\n", "  At the kind request of the Editor of Hadronic Journal, and of TEC/TNRG (Usa),\nwe recall in this article some elementary historical information about the role\nplayed by Ettore Majorana[1-17] with regard to the Neutron, and to the\nNeutrino. Often we do explicitly insert direct quotations from the original\nwritten statements --in particular by Edoardo Amaldi[22-24]--, which in some\ncases, and for some topics, constitute the main available evidence. We also\ndiscuss some recent, unjustified rumors about Ettore Majorana and Enrico Fermi.\n[Keywords: Ettore Majorana; Neutron; Neutrinos; Enrico Fermi; Edoardo Amaldi;\nMajorana spinors; Majorana algebras; Majorana fermions; Fred Wilczek; History\nof XX century physics; Reply to unjustified rumors]\n", "  Illuminated by the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technology in classical\ncontrol engineering, we propose the PWM approximation which transforms\ncontinuous and bang-bang control into each other. This method works by\nsqueezing the approximation error into high-frequency components above a\nprescribed cutoff frequency $\\Omega$, which can be tailored by modulating the\nswitch time of the bang-bang control. Because the quantum dynamics under\nbang-bang control can be efficiently calculated, PWM allows us to speed up\nquantum control design particularly in large dimensional systems with small\nnumber of control variables. Moreover, PWM paves the way to implement various\nbang-bang control protocols in the literature with an arbitrary waveform, which\nis more desirable in laboratory.\n", "  We look at an electric charge in hyperbolic motion, and we describe some\narcane geometrical aspects of the electrodynamic interaction. We discuss the\nadvantages of a time symmetric formulation in which the material point\nparticles are replaced by infinitesimal length elements along their worldlines.\nWe show that the four-force obtained from our geometrical model is very closely\nrelated to the \"electrostatic\" four-force obtained from Fokker's time symmetric\naction.\n", "  Christoffel connection did not enter gravity as an axiom of minimal length\nfor the free fall of particles (where anyway length action is not defined for\nmassless particles), nor out of economy, but from the weak equivalence\nprinciple (gravitational force is equivalent to acceleration according to\nEinstein) together with the identification of the local inertial frame with the\nlocal Lorentz one. This identification implies that the orbits of all particles\nare given by the geodesics of the Christoffel connection. Here, we show that in\nthe presence of only massless particles (absence of massive particles) the\nabove identification is inconsistent and does not lead to any connection. The\nproof is based on the existence of projectively equivalent connections and the\nabsence of proper time for null particles. If a connection derived by some\nkinematical principles for the particles is to be applied in the world, it is\nbetter these principles to be valid in all relevant spacetime rather than\ndifferent principles to give different connections in different spacetime\nregions. Therefore, our result stated above may imply a conceptual\ninsufficiency of the use of the Christoffel connection in the early universe\nwhere only massless particles are expected to be present (whenever at least\nsome notions, like orbits, are meaningful), and thus of the total use of this\nconnection. If in the early universe the notion of a massive particle, which\nappears latter in time, cannot be used, in an analogous way in a causally\ndisconnected high-energy region (maybe deep interior of astrophysical objects\nor black holes) the same conclusions could be extracted if only massless\nparticles are present.\n", "  In-vivo, cells are frequently exposed to multiple mechanical stimuli arising\nfrom the extracellular microenvironment, with deep impact on many biological\nfunctions. On the other hand, current methods for mechanobiology do not allow\nto easily replicate in-vitro the complex spatio-temporal behavior of such\nmechanical signals. Here, we introduce a new platform for studying the\nmechanical coupling between the extracellular environment and the nucleus in\nliving cells, based on active substrates for cell culture made of Fe-coated\npolymeric micropillars. Under the action of quasi-static external magnetic\nfields, each group of pillars produces synchronous nano-mechanical stimuli at\ndifferent points of the cell membrane, thanks to the highly controllable\npillars' deflection. This method enables to perform a new set of experiments\nfor the investigation of cellular dynamics and mechanotransduction mechanisms\nin response to a periodic nano-pinching, with tunable strength and arbitrary\ntemporal shape. We applied this methodology to NIH3T3 cells, demonstrating how\nthe nano-mechanical stimulation affects the actin cytoskeleton, nuclear\nmorphology, H2B core-histone dynamics and MKL transcription-cofactor nuclear to\ncytoplasmic translocation.\n", "  Humans are routinely asked to evaluate the performance of other individuals,\nseparating success from failure and affecting outcomes from science to\neducation and sports. Yet, in many contexts, the metrics driving the human\nevaluation process remain unclear. Here we analyse a massive dataset capturing\nplayers' evaluations by human judges to explore human perception of performance\nin soccer, the world's most popular sport. We use machine learning to design an\nartificial judge which accurately reproduces human evaluation, allowing us to\ndemonstrate how human observers are biased towards diverse contextual features.\nBy investigating the structure of the artificial judge, we uncover the aspects\nof the players' behavior which attract the attention of human judges,\ndemonstrating that human evaluation is based on a noticeability heuristic where\nonly feature values far from the norm are considered to rate an individual's\nperformance.\n", "  We present an analogy between the one dimensional Poisson equation in\ninhomogeneous media and the Dirac equation in one space dimension with a\nLorentz scalar potential for zero energy. We illustrate how the zero energy\nstate in the Jackiw-Rebbi model can be implemented in a simple one dimensional\nelectrostatic setting by using an inhomogeneous electric permittivity and an\ninfinite charged sheet. Our approach provides a novel insight into the\nJackiw-Rebbi zero energy state and provides a helpful view in teaching this\nimportant quantum field theory model using basic electrostatics.\n", "  Popularity describes the dynamics of mass attention, and is a part of a\nbroader class of population dynamics in ecology and social science literature.\nStudying accurate model of popularity is important for quantifying spreading of\nnovelty, memes, and influences in human society. Although logistic equation and\nsimilar class of nonlinear differential equation formulates traditional\npopulation dynamics well, part of the deviation in long-term prediction is\nstated, yet fully understood. Recently, several studies hinted a long-term\nmemory effect on popularity whose response function follows a power-law,\nespecially that appears on online mass media such as YouTube, Twitter, or\nAmazon book sales. Here, we investigate the ranking of most popular music,\n\\textit{the Billboard Hot 100 chart}, which is one of the largest popularity\ndataset spanning several decades. Using a popularity model that comprises\nlogistic growth and a power-law decaying long-term memory, we showed that rank\nhistory is mainly characterized by initial popularity and memory strength. With\nthis framework, we investigated temporal development of long-term memory on the\nwhole popularity dynamics. As a result, abrupt emergence of long-term memory\nand broad initial popularity is illustrated, which was not clearly detected by\ntime-independent measures. We emphasize not only development of the mass media,\nbut also the difference of spreading and accumulated popularity affect dynamics\nsignificantly when the popularity has long-term memory.\n", "  This work investigates a method for generating medium fidelity reactor model\ncross sections. The methodology used here couples a neutron transport code with\na depletion calculator. Together the two can be used to generate time dependent\ngroup cross sections for medium fidelity reactor models in fuel cycle\nsimulation. This work analyzes XSgen, a software that performs the functions\nmentioned above. Addtionally, it is shown that XSgen is capable of creating\ndatasets for a medium fidelity reactor model known as Bright-lite. The results\nof this work show that XSgen produces datasets that match NEA benchmarks for\nboth uranium based LWR, and MOX reactors.\n", "  The generation of random bits is of enormous importance in modern information\nscience. Cryptographic security is based on random numbers which require a\nphysical process for their generation. This is commonly performed by hardware\nrandom number generators. These exhibit often a number of problems, namely\nexperimental bias, memory in the system, and other technical subtleties, which\nreduce the reliability in the entropy estimation. Further, the generated\noutcome has to be post-processed to \"iron out\" such spurious effects. Here, we\npresent a purely optical randomness generator, based on the bi-stable output of\nan optical parametric oscillator. Detector noise plays no role and no further\npost-processing is required. Upon entering the bi-stable regime, initially the\nresulting output phase depends on vacuum fluctuations. Later, the phase is\nrigidly locked and can be well determined versus a pulse train, which is\nderived from the pump laser. This delivers an ambiguity-free output, which is\nreliably detected and associated with a binary outcome. The resulting random\nbit stream resembles a perfect coin toss and passes all relevant randomness\nmeasures. The random nature of the generated binary outcome is furthermore\nconfirmed by an analysis of resulting conditional entropies.\n", "  We develop an intrinsic geometric approach to calculus of variations on\nWasserstein space. We show that the flows associated to the Schroedinger bridge\nwith general prior, to Optimal Mass Transport and to the Madelung fluid can all\nbe characterized as annihilating the first variation of a suitable action. We\nthen discuss the implications of this unified framework for stochastic\nmechanics: It entails, in particular, a sort of fluid-dynamic reconciliation\nbetween Bohm's and Nelson's stochastic mechanics.\n", "  The generalized copolymer model is a disordered system built on a discrete\nrenewal process with inter-arrival distribution that decays in a regularly\nvarying fashion with exponent $1+ \\alpha\\geq 1$. It exhibits a localization\ntransition which can be characterized in terms of the free energy of the model:\nthe free energy is zero in the delocalized phase and it is positive in the\nlocalized phase. This transition, which is observed when tuning the mean $h$ of\nthe disorder variable, has been tackled in the physics literature notably via a\nrenormalization group procedure that goes under the name of \\emph{strong\ndisorder renormalization}. We focus on the case $\\alpha=0$ -- the critical\nvalue $h_c(\\beta)$ of the parameter $h$ is exactly known (for every strength\n$\\beta$ of the disorder) in this case -- and we provide precise estimates on\nthe critical behavior. Our results confirm the strong disorder renormalization\ngroup prediction that the transition is of infinite order, namely that when\n$h\\searrow h_c(\\beta)$ the free energy vanishes faster than any power of\n$h-h_c(\\beta)$. But we show that the free energy vanishes much faster than the\nphysicists' prediction.\n", "  Measurements of the ratio of the proton elastic form factors ($\\mu_pG_E/G_M$)\nusing Rosenbluth separation and those using polarization-based techniques show\na strong discrepancy, which increases as a function of $Q^2$. The contribution\nof hard two-photon exchange (TPE) to $e^-p$ scattering, which is neglected in\nthe standard treatments of elastic $e^-p$ scattering, is the most\nwidely-accepted hypothesis for the explanation of this discrepancy. While\ncalculations of the hard TPE contribution are highly model dependent, the\neffect may be quantified experimentally by precisely measuring the ratio of the\npositron-proton and electron-proton elastic scattering cross sections. The\nOLYMPUS experiment collected approximately 4 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+p$ and $e^-p$\nscattering data at the DORIS storage ring at DESY in 2012, with the goal of\nmeasuring the elastic $\\sigma_{e^+p}/\\sigma_{e^-p}$ ratio over the kinematic\nrange $(0.4 \\leq \\epsilon \\leq 0.9)$, $(0.6 \\leq Q^2 \\leq 2.2)$ GeV$^2/c^2$ at\na fixed lepton beam energy of 2.01 GeV. Initial results from OLYMPUS were\npresented, and subsequently results on $R_{2\\gamma} =\n\\sigma_{e^+p}/\\sigma_{e^-p}$ from the experiment have been publicly released\nand are in preparation for publication.\n", "  The Renormalization Group (RG) is a set of methods that have been\ninstrumental in tackling problems involving an infinite number of degrees of\nfreedom. What all these methods have in common -- which is what explains their\nsuccess -- is that they allow a systematic search for those degrees of freedom\nthat happen to be relevant to the phenomena in question. In the standard\napproaches the RG transformations are implemented by either coarse graining or\nby changes of variables. When these transformations are infinitesimal the\nformalism can be described as a continuous dynamical flow in a fictitious time\nparameter. It is generally the case that these exact RG equations are\nfunctional diffusion equations. In this paper we show that the exact RG\nequations can be derived using entropic methods. The RG flow is then described\nas a form of entropic dynamics of field configurations. Although equivalent to\nother versions of the RG, in this approach the RG transformations receive a\npurely inferential interpretation that establishes a clear link to information\ntheory.\n", "  The relationships between atomic and molecular hydrogen and dust of various\nsizes in extragalactic star-forming regions are considered, based on\nobservational data from the Spitzer and Herschel infrared space telescopes, the\nVery Large Array (atomic hydrogen emission) and IRAM (CO emission). The source\nsample consists of approximately 300 star-forming regions in 11 nearby\ngalaxies. Aperture photometry has been applied to measure the fluxes in eight\ninfrared bands (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8, 24, 70, 100, and 160$\\mu$m), the atomic\nhydrogen (21cm) line and CO (2--1) lines.\n  The parameters of the dust in the starforming regions were determined via\nsynthetic-spectra fitting, such as the total dust mass, the fraction of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), etc. Comparison of the observed fluxes\nwith the measured parameters shows that the relationships between atomic\nhydrogen, molecular hydrogen, and dust are different in low- and\nhigh-metallicity regions. Low-metallicity regions contain more atomic gas, but\nless molecular gas and dust, including PAHs. The mass of dust constitutes about\n$1\\%$ of the mass of molecular gas in all regions considered. Fluxes produced\nby atomic and molecular gas do not correlate with the parameters of the stellar\nradiation, whereas the dust fluxes grow with increasing mean intensity of\nstellar radiation and the fraction of enhanced stellar radiation. The ratio of\nthe fluxes at 8 and 24$\\mu$m, which characterizes the PAH content, decreases\nwith increasing intensity of the stellar radiation, possibly indicating\nevolutionary variations of the PAH content. The results confirm that the\ncontribution of the 24$\\mu$m emission to the total IR luminosity of\nextragalactic star-forming regions does not depend on the metallicity.\n", "  We study the structure and evolution of the accreting plasma in gamma ray\nburst central engines. The models are based on the general relativistic MHD\nsimulations. The nuclear equation of state adequate for dense and degenerate\nplasma, is incorporated to the numerical scheme instead of a simple polytropic\nEOS. Plasma is cooled by neutrinos and energy is extracted from the rotating BH\nby magnetic fields. We discuss our results in the frame of the observable GRBs,\nand speculate about the origin of variability in the GRB jet emission. We also\ndiscuss the possible contribution from the heavy elements synthesized in winds\nfrom GRB engines to the kilonova emission.\n", "  We present our implementation of an automated VLBI data reduction pipeline\ndedicated to interferometric data imaging and analysis. The pipeline can handle\nmassive VLBI data efficiently which makes it an appropriate tool to investigate\nmulti-epoch multiband VLBI data. Compared to traditional manual data reduction,\nour pipeline provides more objective results since less human interference is\ninvolved. Source extraction is done in the image plane, while deconvolution and\nmodel fitting are done in both the image plane and the uv plane for parallel\ncomparison. The output from the pipeline includes catalogues of CLEANed images\nand reconstructed models, polarisation maps, proper motion estimates, core\nlight curves and multi-band spectra. We have developed a regression strip\nalgorithm to automatically detect linear or non-linear patterns in the jet\ncomponent trajectories. This algorithm offers an objective method to match jet\ncomponents at different epochs and determine their proper motions.\n", "  NASA's K2 mission began observing fields along the ecliptic plane in 2014.\nEach observing campaign lasts approximately 80 days, during which\nhigh-precision optical photometry of select astrophysical targets is collected\nby the Kepler spacecraft. Due to the 4 arcsec pixel scale of the Kepler\nphotometer, significant blending between the observed targets can occur\n(especially in dense fields close to the Galactic plane). We undertook a\nprogram to use the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the 3.8 m United Kingdom\nInfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) to collect high-spatial-resolution near-infrared\nimages of targets in select K2 campaign fields, which we report here. These 0.4\narcsec resolution K-band images offer the opportunity to perform a variety of\nscience, including vetting exoplanet candidates by identifying nearby stars\nblended with the target star and estimating the size, color, and type of\ngalaxies observed by K2.\n", "  In many interfacial flow systems, variations of surface properties lead to\nnovel and interesting behaviors. In this work a three-dimensional model of flow\ndynamics for multicomponent vesicles is presented. The surface composition is\nmodeled using a two-phase surface Cahn-Hilliard system, while the interface is\ncaptured using a level set jet scheme. The interface is coupled to the\nsurrounding fluid via a variation of energy approach. Sample energies\nconsidered include the total bending, variable surface tension energy, and\nphase segregation energy. The fully coupled system for surface inhomogeneities,\nand thus varying interface material properties is presented, as are the\nassociated numerical methods. Numerical convergence and sample results\ndemonstrate the validity of the model.\n", "  Transcription factors are able to associate to their binding sites on DNA\nfaster than the physical limit posed by diffusion. Such high association rates\ncan be achieved by alternating between three-dimensional diffusion and\none-dimensional sliding along the DNA chain, a mechanism dubbed Facilitated\nDiffusion. By studying a collection of transcription factor binding sites of\nEscherichia coli from the RegulonDB database and of Bacillus subtilis from\nDBTBS, we reveal a funnel in the binding energy landscape around the target\nsequences. We show that such a funnel is linked to the presence of gradients of\nAT in the base composition in the DNA region around the binding sites. An\nextensive computational study of the stochastic sliding process along the\nenergetic landscapes obtained from the database shows that the funnel can\nsignificantly enhance the probability of transcription factors to find their\ntarget sequences when sliding in their proximity. We demonstrate that this\nenhancement leads to a speed-up of the association process.\n", "  We have performed Coherent-vorticity Preserving Large-Eddy simulations of a\ntrefoil knot-shaped vortex, inspired by the experiments of Kleckner and Irvine.\nThe flow parameter space is extended in the present study, including variations\nof the circulation Reynolds numbers in the range Re = 2000 - 200000, where Re =\n20000 is the value used in the experiments. The vortex line corresponding to\nthe trefoil knot is defined using a parametric equation and the Biot-Savart law\nis employed to initialize the velocity field. The CvP LES computation displays\na good qualitative match with the experiment. In particular, the vortex\nentanglement process is accurately represented as well as the subsequent\nseparation of the main vortex in two distinct structures - a small and a large\nvortex - with different self-advection speeds that have been quantified. The\nsmall vortex propagates faster than the large oscillatory vortex which carries\nan important amount of vorticity. The advection velocity of the vortex before\nbursting is found to be independent of the Reynolds number. The low Reynolds\nnumber computation leads to a decrease of the separated vortices velocity after\nbursting, compared to the higher Reynolds computations. The computation of\nenergy spectra emphasizes intense energy transfers from large to small scales\nduring the bursting process. The evolution of volume-averaged enstrophy shows\nthat the bursting leads to the creation of small scales that are sustained a\nlong time in the flow, when a sufficiently large Reynolds number is considered\n(Re>20000). The low Reynolds number case Re = 2000 hinders the generation of\nsmall scales during the bursting process and yields essentially laminar\ndynamics. The onset of background turbulence due to the entanglement process\ncan be observed at Re = 200000\n", "  In this paper, we show that the generating function for linear Hodge\nintegrals over moduli spaces of stable maps to a nonsingular projective variety\n$X$ can be connected to the generating function for Gromov-Witten invariants of\n$X$ by a series of differential operators $\\{ L_m \\mid m \\geq 1 \\}$ after a\nsuitable change of variables. These operators satisfy the Virasoro bracket\nrelation and can be seen as a generalization of the Virasoro operators appeared\nin the Virasoro constraints for Kontsevich-Witten tau-function in the point\ncase. This result is an extension of the work in \\cite{LW} for the point case\nwhich solved a conjecture of Alexandrov.\n", "  We explore how introducing a non-trivial Mordell-Weil group changes the\nstructure of the Coulomb phases of a five-dimensional gauge theory from an\nM-theory compactified on an elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with a\nI$_2$+I$_4$ collision of singularities. The resulting gauge theory has a\nsemi-simple Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{su}(2)\\oplus \\mathfrak{sp}(4)$ or\n$\\mathfrak{su}(2)\\oplus \\mathfrak{su}(4)$. We compute topological invariants\nrelevant for the physics, such as the Euler characteristic, Hodge numbers, and\ntriple intersection numbers. We determine the matter representation\ngeometrically by computing weights via intersection of curves and fibral\ndivisors. We fix the number of charged hypermultiplets transforming in each\nrepresentations by comparing the triple intersection numbers and the one-loop\nprepotential. This condition is enough to fix the number of representation when\nthe Mordell-Weil group is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ but not when it is trivial. The\nvanishing of the fourth power of the curvature forms in the anomaly polynomial\nis enough to fix the number of representations. We discuss anomaly\ncancellations of the six-dimensional uplifted. In particular, the gravitational\nanomaly is also considered as the Hodge numbers are computed explicitly without\ncounting the degrees of freedom of the Weierstrass equation.\n", "  We consider the energy level statistics of non-interacting electrons which\ndiffuse in a $ d $-dimensional disordered metallic conductor of characteristic\nThouless energy $ E_c. $ We assume that the level distribution can be written\nas the Gibbs distribution of a classical one-dimensional gas of fictitious\nparticles with a pairwise additive interaction potential $ f(\\varepsilon ). $\nWe show that the interaction which is consistent with the known correlation\nfunction of pairs of energy levels is a logarithmic repulsion for level\nseparations $ \\varepsilon <E_c, $ in agreement with Random Matrix Theory. When\n$ \\varepsilon >E_c, $ $ f(\\varepsilon ) $ vanishes as a power law in $\n\\varepsilon /E_c $ with exponents $ -{1 \\over 2},-2, $ and $ -{3 \\over 2} $ for\n$ d=1,2, $ and 3, respectively. While for $ d=1,2 $ the energy-level\ninteraction is always repulsive, in three dimensions there is long-range level\nattraction after the short-range logarithmic repulsion.\n", "  The distribution function of the local density of states is computed exactly\nfor the Wigner-Dyson ensemble of random Hamiltonians. In the absence of\ntime-reversal symmetry, precise agreement is obtained with the \"supersymmetry\"\ntheory by Efetov and Prigodin of the NMR lineshape in disordered metal\nparticles. Upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, the variance of the Knight\nshift in the smallest particles is reduced by a universal factor of 2/3. ***To\nbe published in Physical Review B.****\n", "  The transport properties of a ferromagnet-superconductor (FS) junction are\nstudied in a scattering formulation. Andreev reflection at the FS interface is\nstrongly affected by the exchange interaction in the ferromagnet. The\nconductance G_FS of a ballistic point contact between F and S can be both\nlarger or smaller than the value G_FN with the superconductor in the normal\nstate, depending on the ratio of the exchange and Fermi energies. If the\nferromagnet contains a tunnel barrier (I), the conductance G_FIFS exhibits\nresonances which do not vanish in linear response -- in contrast to the Tomasch\noscillations for non-ferromagnetic materials.\n"]}
