coefficients between temperature and line-of-sight\nvelocity as a function of optical depth throughout the solar photosphere for\nthe non-magnetic photosphere and a small area of enhanced magnetic activity.\nThe maximum anticorrelation of about -0.6 between temperature and line-of-sight\nvelocity in the non-magnetic photosphere occurs at log tau5 = -0.4. The\nmagnetic field is another decorrelating factor along with 5-min oscillations\nand seeing.\n", "  The solar chromosphere and transition region are highly structured and\ncomplex regimes. A recent breakthrough has been the identification of dynamic\nfibrils observed in H alpha as caused by field-aligned magnetoacoustic shocks.\nWe seek to find whether such dynamic fibrils are also observed in Ly alpha. We\nused a brief sequence of four high-resolution Ly alpha images of the solar limb\ntaken by the Very high Angular resolution ULtraviolet Telescope (VAULT), which\ndisplays many extending and retracting Ly alpha jets. We measured their top\ntrajectories and fitted parabolas to the 30 best-defined ones. Most jet tops\nmove supersonically. Half of them decelerate, sometimes superballistically, the\nothers accelerate. This bifurcation may arise from incomplete sampling of\nrecurrent jets. The similarities between dynamic Ly alpha jets and H alpha\nfibrils suggest that the magnetoacoustic shocks causing dynamic H alpha fibrils\nalso affect dynamic Ly alpha jets.\n", "  Using non-linear system theory and numerical simulations we map out the\nstatic and dynamic phase diagram in zero applied field of a spin torque\noscillator with a tilted polarizer (TP-STO).We find that for sufficiently large\ncurrents, even very small tilt angles (beta>1 degree) will lead to steady free\nlayer precession in zero field. Within a rather large range of tilt angles, 1\ndegree< beta <19 degree, we find coexisting static states and hysteretic\nswitching between these using only current. In a more narrow window (1\ndegree<beta<5 degree) one of the static states turns into a limit cycle\n(precession). The coexistence of static and dynamic states in zero magnetic\nfield is unique to the tilted polarizer and leads to large hysteresis in the\nupper and lower threshold currents for TP-STO operation.\n", "  We study metastable clusters in a colloidal system with competing\ninteractions. A short-ranged polymer-induced attraction drives clustering,\nwhile a weak, long-ranged electrostatic repulsion prevents extensive\naggregation. We compare experimental yields of cluster structures expected from\ntheory, which assumes simple addition of the competing isotropic interactions.\nFor clusters of size $4\\leq m\\leq6$, the yield is significantly less than that\nexpected. We attribute this to an anisotropic self-organized surface charge\ndistribution linked to the cluster symmetry: non-additivity of electrostatic\nrepulsion and polymer-induced attraction. 7-membered clusters have a clear\noptimal yield of the expected pentagonal bipyramid structure as a function of\nstrength of the attractive interaction.\n", "  General relativistic quasiequilibrium states of black hole-neutron star\nbinaries are computed in the moving-puncture framework. We propose three\nconditions for determining the quasiequilibrium states and compare the\nnumerical results with those obtained in the excision framework. We find that\nthe results obtained in the moving-puncture framework agree with those in the\nexcision framework and with those in the third post-Newtonian approximation for\nthe cases that (i) the mass ratio of the binary is close to unity irrespective\nof the orbital separation, and (ii) the orbital separation is large enough\n($m_0\\Omega \\alt 0.02$ where $m_0$ and $\\Omega$ are the total mass and the\norbital angular velocity, respectively) irrespective of the mass ratio. For\n$m_0 \\Omega \\agt 0.03$, both of the results in the moving-puncture and excision\nframeworks deviate, more or less, from those in the third post-Newtonian\napproximation. Thus the numerical results do not provide a quasicircular state,\nrather they seem to have a nonnegligible eccentricity of order 0.01--0.1. We\nshow by numerical simulation that a method in the moving-puncture framework can\nprovide approximately quasicircular states in which the eccentricity is by a\nfactor of $\\sim 2$ smaller than those in quasiequilibrium given by other\napproaches.\n", "  We investigate the temporal evolution of magnetic flux emerging within a\ngranule in the quiet-Sun internetwork at disk center. We combined IR\nspectropolarimetry performed in two Fe I lines at 1565 nm with\nspeckle-reconstructed G-band imaging. We determined the magnetic field\nparameters by a LTE inversion of the full Stokes vector using the SIR code, and\nfollowed their evolution in time. To interpret the observations, we created a\ngeometrical model of a rising loop in 3D. The relevant parameters of the loop\nwere matched to the observations where possible. We then synthesized spectra\nfrom the 3D model for a comparison to the observations. We found signatures of\nmagnetic flux emergence within a growing granule. In the early phases, a\nhorizontal magnetic field with a distinct linear polarization signal dominated\nthe emerging flux. Later on, two patches of opposite circular polarization\nsignal appeared symmetrically on either side of the linear polarization patch,\nindicating a small loop-like structure. The mean magnetic flux density of this\nloop was roughly 450 G, with a total magnetic flux of around 3x10^17 Mx. During\nthe ~12 min episode of loop occurrence, the spatial extent of the loop\nincreased from about 1 to 2 arcsec. The middle part of the appearing feature\nwas blueshifted during its occurrence, supporting the scenario of an emerging\nloop. The temporal evolution of the observed spectra is reproduced to first\norder by the spectra derived from the geometrical model. The observed event can\nbe explained as a case of flux emergence in the shape of a small-scale loop.\n", "  Systems in which a short-ranged attraction and long-ranged repulsion compete\nare intrinsically frustrated, leading their structure and dynamics to be\ndominated either by mesoscopic order or by metastable disorder. Here we report\nthe latter case in a colloidal system with long-ranged electrostatic repulsions\nand short-ranged depletion attractions. We find a variety of states exhibiting\nslow non-diffusive dynamics: a gel, a glassy state of clusters, and a state\nreminiscent of a Wigner glass. Varying the interactions, we find a continuous\ncrossover between the Wigner and cluster glassy states, and a sharp\ndiscontinuous transition between the Wigner glassy state and gel. This\ndifference reflects the fact that dynamic arrest is driven by repulsion for the\ntwo glassy states and attraction in the case of the gel.\n", "  We report results of a numerical-relativity simulation for the merger of a\nblack hole-neutron star binary with a variety of equations of state (EOSs)\nmodeled by piecewise polytropes. We focus in particular on the dependence of\nthe gravitational waveform at the merger stage on the EOSs. The initial\nconditions are computed in the moving-puncture framework, assuming that the\nblack hole is nonspinning and the neutron star has an irrotational velocity\nfield. For a small mass ratio of the binaries (e.g., MBH/MNS = 2 where MBH and\nMNS are the masses of the black hole and neutron star, respectively), the\nneutron star is tidally disrupted before it is swallowed by the black hole\nirrespective of the EOS. Especially for less-compact neutron stars, the tidal\ndisruption occurs at a more distant orbit. The tidal disruption is reflected in\na cutoff frequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrum\namplitude exponentially decreases. A clear relation is found between the cutoff\nfrequency of the gravitational-wave spectrum and the compactness of the neutron\nstar. This relation also depends weakly on the stiffness of the EOS in the core\nregion of the neutron star, suggesting that not only the compactness but also\nthe EOS at high density is reflected in gravitational waveforms. The mass of\nthe disk formed after the merger shows a similar correlation with the EOS,\nwhereas the spin of the remnant black hole depends primarily on the mass ratio\nof the binary, and only weakly on the EOS. Properties of the remnant disks are\nalso analyzed.\n", "  Until now, gels have been formed of multicomponent soft matter systems,\nconsisting of a solvent and one or more macromolecular or colloidal species.\nHere we show that, for sufficient quench rates, the Girifalco model of C60 can\nform gels which we identify by their slow dynamics and long-lived network\nstructure. These gels are stable at room temperature, at least on the\nsimulation timescale up to 100 ns. At moderate temperatures around 1000 K,\nbelow the bulk glass transition temperature, C60 exhibits crystallisation and\nphase separation proceeds without the dynamical arrest associated with\ngelation, in contrast to many colloidal systems.\n", "  Hard-sphere colloids are popular as models for testing fundamental theories\nin condensed matter and statistical physics, from crystal nucleation to the\nglass transition. A single parameter, the volume fraction (phi), characterizes\nan ideal, monodisperse hard-sphere suspension. In comparing experiments with\ntheories and simulation, researchers to date have paid little attention to\nlikely uncertainties in experimentally-quoted phi values. We critically review\nthe experimental measurement of phi in hard-sphere colloids, and show that\nwhile statistical uncertainties in comparing relative values of phi can be as\nlow as 0.0001, systematic errors of 3-6% are probably unavoidable. The\nconsequences of this are illustrated by way of a case study comparing\nliterature data sets on hard-sphere viscosity and diffusion.\n", "  We study the merger of black hole (BH)-neutron star (NS) binaries with a\nvariety of BH spins aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum,\nand with the mass ratio in the range MBH/MNS = 2--5, where MBH and MNS are the\nmass of the BH and NS, respectively. We model NS matter by systematically\nparametrized piecewise polytropic equations of state. The initial condition is\ncomputed in the puncture framework adopting an isolated horizon framework to\nestimate the BH spin and assuming an irrotational velocity field for the fluid\ninside the NS. Dynamical simulations are performed in full general relativity\nby an adaptive mesh refinement code, SACRA. The treatment of hydrodynamic\nequations and estimation of the disk mass are improved. We find that the NS is\ntidally disrupted irrespective of the mass ratio when the BH has a moderately\nlarge prograde spin, whereas only binaries with low mass ratios, MBH/MNS <~ 3\nor small compactnesses of the NSs, bring the tidal disruption when the BH spin\nis zero or retrograde. The mass of the remnant disk is accordingly large as >~\n0.1 Msun, which is required by central engines of short gamma-ray bursts, if\nthe BH spin is prograde. Information of the tidal disruption is reflected in a\nclear relation between the compactness of the NS and an appropriately defined\n\"cutoff frequency\" in the gravitational-wave spectrum, above which the spectrum\ndamps exponentially. We find that the tidal disruption of the NS and excitation\nof the quasinormal mode of the remnant BH occur in a compatible manner in high\nmass-ratio binaries with the prograde BH spin. The correlation between the\ncompactness and the cutoff frequency still holds for such cases. It is also\nsuggested by extrapolation that the merger of an extremely spinning BH and an\nirrotational NS binary does not lead to formation of an overspinning BH.\n", "  We proposed a deterministic multidimensional growth model for small-world\nnetworks. The model can characterize the distinguishing properties of many\nreal-life networks with geometric space structure. Our results show the model\npossesses small-world effect: larger clustering coefficient and smaller\ncharacteristic path length. We also obtain some accurate results for its\nproperties including degree distribution, clustering coefficient and network\ndiameter and discuss them. It is also worth noting that we get an accurate\nanalytical expression for calculating the characteristic path length. We verify\nnumerically and experimentally these main features.\n", "  We introduce a model system of anisotropic colloidal `rocks'. Due to their\nshape, the bonding introduced via non-absorbing polymers is profoundly\ndifferent from spherical particles: bonds between rocks are rigid against\nrotation, leading to strong frustration. We develop a geometric model which\ncaptures the essence of the rocks. Experiments and simulations show that the\ncolloid geometry leads to structures of low fractal dimension. This is in stark\ncontrast to gels of spheres, whose rigidity results from locally dense regions.\nAt high density the rocks form a quasi one-component glass.\n", "  We report that binary dispersions of like-charged colloidal particles with\nlarge charge asymmetry but similar size exhibit phase separation into crystal\nand fluid phases under very low salt conditions. This is unexpected because the\neffective colloid-colloid pair interactions are accurately described by a\nYukawa model which is stable to demixing. We show that colloid-ion interactions\nprovide an energetic driving force for phase separation, which is initiated by\ncrystallization of one species.\n", "  We investigate the response to temperature of a well-known colloid-polymer\nmixture. At room temperature, the critical value of the second virial\ncoefficient of the effective interaction for the Asakura-Oosawa model predicts\nthe onset of gelation with remarkable accuracy. Upon cooling the system, the\neffective attractions between colloids induced by polymer depletion are\nreduced, because the polymer radius of gyration is decreases as the\ntheta-temperature is approached. Paradoxically, this raises the effective\ntemperature, leading to \"melting\" of colloidal gels. We find the Asakura-Oosawa\nmodel of effective colloid interactions with a simple description of the\npolymer temperature response provides a quantitative description of the\nfluid-gel transition. Further we present evidence for enhancement of\ncrystallisation rates near the metastable critical point.\n", "  Whether or not there is growing static order accompanying the dynamical\nheterogeneity and increasing relaxation times seen in glassy systems is a\nmatter of dispute. An obstacle to resolving this issue is that the order is\nexpected to be amorphous and so not amenable to simple order parameters. We use\nmutual information to provide a general measurement of order that is sensitive\nto multi-particle correlations. We apply this to two glass-forming systems (2D\nbinary mixtures of hard disks with different size ratios to give varying\namounts of hexatic order) and show that there is little growth of amorphous\norder in the system without crystalline order. In both cases we measure the\ndynamical length with a four-point correlation function and find that it\nincreases significantly faster than the static lengths in the system as density\nis increased. We further show that we can recover the known scaling of the\ndynamic correlation length in a kinetically constrained model, the 2-TLG.\n", "  We consider homogeneous crystallisation rates in confocal microscopy\nexperiments on colloidal nearly hard spheres at the single particle level.\nThese we compare with Brownian dynamics simuations by carefully modelling the\nsoftness in the interactions with a Yukawa potential, which takes account of\nthe electrostatic charges present in the experimental system. Both structure\nand dynamics of the colloidal fluid are very well matched between experiment\nand simulation, so we have confidence that the system simulated is close to\nthat in the experiment. In the regimes we can access, we find reasonable\nagreement in crystallisation rates between experiment and simulations, noting\nthat the larger system size in experiments enables the formation of critical\nnuclei and hence crystallisation at lower supersaturations than the\nsimulations. We further examine the structure of the metastable fluid with a\nnovel structural analysis, the topological cluster classification. We find that\nat densities where the hard sphere fluid becomes metastable, the dominant\nstructure is a cluster of m=10 particles with five-fold symmetry. At a particle\nlevel, we find three regimes for the crystallisation process: metastable fluid\n(dominated by m=10 clusters), crystal and a transition region of frequent\nhopping between crystal-like environments and other (m\\neq10) structures\n", "  We propose a possibility of ultrarelativistic electromagnetic counterparts to\ngravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers at nearly all the viewing\nangles. Our proposed mechanism relies on the merger-shock propagation\naccelerating a smaller mass in the outer parts of the neutron star crust to a\nlarger Lorentz factor $\\Gamma$ with smaller energy $\\sim 10^{47} \\Gamma^{-1}$\nerg. This mechanism is difficult to resolve by current 3D numerical\nsimulations. The outflows emit synchrotron flares for seconds to days by\nshocking the ambient medium. Ultrarelativistic flares shine at an early time\nand in high-energy bands, potentially detectable by current X-ray to radio\ninstruments, such as Swift XRT and Pan-STARRS, and even in low ambient density\n$\\sim 10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$ by EVLA. The flares probe the merger position and\ntime, and the merger types as black hole--neutron star outflows would be\nnon-/mildly relativistic.\n", "  Alfven waves are considered as potential transporters of energy heating the\nsolar corona. We seek spectroscopic signatures of the Alfven waves in the\nchromosphere occupied by a bright network element, investigating temporal\nvariations of the spectral width, intensity, Dopplershift, and the asymmetry of\nthe core of the Halpha spectral line observed by the tunable Lyot filter\ninstalled on the Dutch Open Telescope. The spectral characteristics are derived\nthrough the fitting of five intensity samples, separated from each other by\n0.35 A, by a 4th-order polynomial. The bright network element displays the most\npronounced variations of the Dopplershift varying from 0 to 4 km/s about the\naverage of 1.5 km/s. This fact implies a persistent redshift of the Halpha core\nwith a redward asymmetry of about 0.5 km/s, suggesting an inverse-C bisector.\nThe variations of the core intensity up to +-10% and the core width up to +-5%\nabout the respective averages are much less pronounced, but still detectable.\nThe core intensity variations lag behind the Dopplershift variations about 2.1\nmin. The Halpha core width tends to correlate with the Dopplershift and\nanticorrelate with the asymmetry, suggesting that more redshifted Halpha\nprofiles are wider and the broadening of the Halpha core is accompanied with a\nchange of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward. We also found a striking\nanticorrelation between the core asymmetry and the Dopplershift, suggesting a\nchange of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward with an increasing\nredshift of the Halpha core. The data and the applied analysis do not show\nmeaningful tracks of Alfven waves in the selected network element.\n", "  The merger of black hole-neutron star binaries can eject substantial material\nwith the mass ~0.01-0.1M_sun when the neutron star is disrupted prior to the\nmerger. The ejecta shows significant anisotropy, and travels in a particular\ndirection with the bulk velocity ~0.2c. This is drastically different from the\nbinary neutron star merger, for which ejecta is nearly isotropic. Anisotropic\nejecta brings electromagnetic-counterpart diversity which is unique to black\nhole-neutron star binaries, such as viewing-angle dependence, polarization, and\nproper motion. The kick velocity of the black hole, gravitational-wave memory\nemission, and cosmic-ray acceleration are also discussed.\n", "  We build a holographic superconductor model with a scalar triplet charged\nunder an SU(2) gauge field in the bulk. In this model, the s-wave and p-wave\ncondensates can be consistently realized. We find that there are totally four\nphases in this model, namely, the normal phase without any condensate, s-wave\nphase, p-wave phase and the s+p coexisting phase. By calculating Gibbs free\nenergy, the s+p coexisting phase turns out to be thermodynamically favored once\nit can appear. The phase diagram with the dimension of the scalar operator and\ntemperature is drawn. The temperature range for the s+p coexisting phase is\nvery narrow, which shows the competition between the s-wave and p-wave orders\nin the superconductor model.\n", "  Dust grains scatter X-ray light through small angles, producing a diffuse\nhalo image around bright X-ray point sources situated behind a large amount of\ninterstellar material. We present analytic solutions to the integral for the\ndust scattering intensity, which allow for a Bayesian analysis of the\nscattering halo around Cygnus X-3. Fitting the optically thin 4-6 keV halo\nsurface brightness profile yields the dust grain size and spatial distribution.\nWe assume a power law distribution of grain sizes ($n \\propto a^{-p}$) and fit\nfor $p$, the grain radius cut-off amax, and dust mass column. We find that a $p\n\\approx 3.5$ dust grain size distribution with amax $\\approx 0.2$ um fits the\nhalo profile relatively well, whether the dust is distributed uniformly along\nthe line of sight or in clumps. We find that a model consisting of two dust\nscreens, representative of foreground spiral arms, requires the foreground\nPerseus arm to contain 80\\% of the total dust mass. The remaining 20\\% of the\ndust, which may be associated with the outer spiral arm of the Milky Way, is\nlocated within 1 kpc of Cyg X-3. Regardless of which model was used, we found\n$\\tau_{\\rm sca} \\sim 2 \\ E_{\\rm keV}^{-2}$. We examine the energy resolved\nhalos of Cyg X-3 from 1 - 6 keV and find that there is a sharp drop in\nscattering halo intensity when $E < 2-3$ keV, which cannot be explained with\nmultiple scattering effects. We hypothesize that this may be caused by large\ndust grains or material with unique dielectric properties, causing the\nscattering cross-section to depart from the Rayleigh-Gans approximation that is\nused most often in X-ray scattering studies. The foreground Cyg OB2\nassociation, which contains several evolved stars with large extinction values,\nis a likely culprit for grains of unique size or composition.\n", "  We study the possibility of pre-merger localization of eccentric compact\nbinary coalescences by second-generation gravitational-wave detector networks.\nGravitational waves from eccentric binaries can be regarded as a sequence of\npulses, which are composed of various higher harmonic modes than ones with\ntwice the orbital frequency. The higher harmonic modes from a very early\ninspiral phase will not only contribute to the signal-to-noise ratio, but also\nallow us to localize the gravitational-wave source before the merger sets in.\nThis is due to the fact that high-frequency gravitational waves are essential\nfor the source localization via triangulation by ground-based detector\nnetworks. We found that the single-detector signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 5 at\n10 min before the merger for a 1.4--1.4 $M_\\odot$ eccentric binary neutron\nstars at 100 Mpc in optimal cases, and it can be localized up to 10 deg$^2$ at\nhalf a minute before the merger by a four-detector network. We will even be\nable to achieve $\\sim$ 10 deg$^2$ at 10 min before the merger for a face-on\neccentric compact binary by a five-detector network.\n", "  We develop a method to compute low-eccentricity initial data of binary\nneutron stars required to perform realistic simulations in numerical\nrelativity. The orbital eccentricity is controlled by adjusting the orbital\nangular velocity of a binary and incorporating an approaching relative velocity\nof the neutron stars. These modifications improve the solution primarily\nthrough the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the binary initial data. The\norbital angular velocity and approaching velocity of initial data are updated\niteratively by performing time evolutions over ~3 orbits. We find that the\neccentricity can be reduced by an order of magnitude compared to standard\nquasicircular initial data, specifically from ~0.01 to <~0.001, by three\nsuccessive iterations for equal-mass binaries leaving ~10 orbits before the\nmerger.\n", "  The path-preference traffic flow cellular automaton is suggested to model the\ndynamics of transcription. The main difference from the simple traffic flow\nmodel is that it contains another preferential paths at some sites. In this\npaper, we propose an exact analysis for the simplest version of this model. We\nfind that the number of particles is dominant to the dynamics of this cellular\nautomaton and observed that there are not only expected phase shift but also\nseveral gaps as the number of particles increases. By considering the behavior\nof periodic orbits, we also determine the point where such gaps in the flow\nappear and the exact value of the flow.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the relationship between local structure and\ndynamical arrest in a quasi-2d colloidal model system which approximates hard\ndiscs. We introduce polydispersity to the system to suppress crystallisation.\nUpon compression, the increase in structural relaxation time is accompanied by\nthe emergence of local hexagonal symmetry. Examining the dynamical\nheterogeneity of the system, we identify three types of motion :\n\"zero-dimensional\" corresponding to beta-relaxation, \"one-dimensional\" or\nstringlike motion and \"two-dimensional\" motion. The dynamic heterogeneity is\ncorrelated with the local order, that is to say locally hexagonal regions are\nmore likely to be dynamically slow. However we find that lengthscales\ncorresponding to dynamic heterogeneity and local structure do not appear to\nscale together approaching the glass transition.\n", "  In a previous paper (arXiv:1309.2204, JHEP 1311 (2013) 087), we present a\nholographic s+p superconductor model with a scalar triplet charged under an\nSU(2) gauge field in the bulk. We also study the competition and coexistence of\nthe s-wave and p-wave orders in the probe limit. In this work we continue to\nstudy the model by considering the full back-reaction The model shows a rich\nphase structure and various condensate behaviors such as the \"n-type\" and\n\"u-type\" ones, which are also known as reentrant phase transitions in condensed\nmatter physics. The phase transitions to the p-wave phase or s+p coexisting\nphase become first order in strong back-reaction cases. In these first order\nphase transitions, the free energy curve always forms a swallow tail shape, in\nwhich the unstable s+p solution can also play an important role. The phase\ndiagrams of this model are given in terms of the dimension of the scalar order\nand the temperature in the cases of eight different values of the back reaction\nparameter, which show that the region for the s+p coexisting phase is enlarged\nwith a small or medium back reaction parameter, but is reduced in the strong\nback-reaction cases.\n", "  Networks are a convenient way to represent complex systems of interacting\nentities. Many networks contain \"communities\" of nodes that are more densely\nconnected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. In this\npaper, we investigate the detection of communities in temporal networks\nrepresented as multilayer networks. As a focal example, we study time-dependent\nfinancial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the\n\"modularity\" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in\nan observed network to expected edge weights in a \"null network\"---is\napplication-dependent. We differentiate between \"null networks\" and \"null\nmodels\" in our discussion of modularity maximization, and we highlight that the\nsame null network can correspond to different null models. We then investigate\na multilayer modularity-maximization problem to identify communities in\ntemporal networks. Our multilayer analysis only depends on the form of the\nmaximization problem and not on the specific quality function that one chooses.\nWe introduce a diagnostic to measure \\emph{persistence} of community structure\nin a multilayer network partition. We prove several results that describe how\nthe multilayer maximization problem measures a trade-off between static\ncommunity structure within layers and larger values of persistence across\nlayers. We also discuss some computational issues that the popular \"Louvain\"\nheuristic faces with temporal multilayer networks and suggest ways to mitigate\nthem.\n", "  In 'modified' gravity the observed acceleration of the universe is explained\nby changing the gravitational force law or the number of degrees of freedom in\nthe gravitational sector. Both possibilities can be tested by measurements of\ncosmological structure formation. In this paper we elaborate the details of\nsuch tests using the Galileon model as a case study. We pay attention to the\npossibility that each new degree of freedom may have stochastically independent\ninitial conditions, generating different types of potential well in the early\nuniverse and breaking complete correlation between density and velocity power\nspectra. This 'stochastic bias' can confuse schemes to parametrize the\npredictions of modified gravity models, such as the use of the growth parameter\nf alone. Using data from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey we show that it will be\npossible to obtain constraints using information about the cosmological-scale\nforce law embedded in the multipole power spectra of redshift-space\ndistortions. As an example, we obtain an upper limit on the strength of the\nconformal coupling to matter in the cubic Galileon model, giving |1/M| < 200 /\nMp. This allows the fifth-force to be stronger than gravity, but is consistent\nwith zero coupling.\n", "  In this article, we introduce higher order conjugate Poisson and Poisson\nkernels, which are higher order analogues of the classical conjugate Poisson\nand Poisson kernels, as well as the polyharmonic fundamental solutions, and\ndefine multi-layer potentials in terms of Poisson field and the polyharmonic\nfundamental solutions, in which the former formed by the higher order conjugate\nPoisson and Poisson kernels. Then by the multi-layer potentials, we solve three\nclasses of boundary value problems (i.e., Dirichlet, Neumann and regularity\nproblems) with $L^{p}$ boundary data for polyharmonic equations in Lipschitz\ndomains and give integral representation (or potential) solutions of these\nproblems.\n", "  We study the impact of a spatially homogeneous yet non-stationary dielectric\npermittivity on the dynamical and spectral properties of light. Our choice of\npotential is motivated by the interest in PT-symmetric systems as an extension\nof quantum mechanics. Because we consider a homogeneous and non-stationary\nmedium, PT symmetry reduces to time-reversal symmetry in the presence of\nbalanced gain and loss. We construct the instantaneous amplitude and angular\nfrequency of waves within the framework of Maxwell's equations and demonstrate\nthe modulation of light amplification and attenuation associated with the\nwell-defined temporal domains of gain and loss, respectively. Moreover, we\npredict the splitting of extrema of the angular frequency modulation and\ndemonstrate the associated shrinkage of the modulation period. Our theory can\nbe extended for investigating similar time-dependent effects with matter and\nacoustic waves in PT-symmetric structures.\n", "  Classical chaos is often characterized as exponential divergence of nearby\ntrajectories. In many interesting cases these trajectories can be identified\nwith geodesic curves. We define here the entropy by $S = \\ln \\chi (x)$ with\n$\\chi(x)$ being the distance between two nearby geodesics. We derive an\nequation for the entropy which by transformation to a Ricatti-type equation\nbecomes similar to the Jacobi equation. We further show that the geodesic\nequation for a null geodesic in a double warped space time leads to the same\nentropy equation. By applying a Robertson-Walker metric for a flat\nthree-dimensional Euclidian space expanding as a function of time, we again\nreach the entropy equation stressing the connection between the chosen entropy\nmeasure and time. We finally turn to the Raychaudhuri equation for expansion,\nwhich also is a Ricatti equation similar to the transformed entropy equation.\nThose Ricatti-type equations have solutions of the same form as the Jacobi\nequation. The Raychaudhuri equation can be transformed to a harmonic oscillator\nequation, and it has been shown that the geodesic deviation equation of Jacobi\nis essentially equivalent to that of a harmonic oscillator. The Raychaudhuri\nequations are strong geometrical tools in the study of General Relativity and\nCosmology. We suggest a refined entropy measure applicable in Cosmology and\ndefined by the average deviation of the geodesics in a congruence.\n", "  In this paper, we study the holographic s+p model in 5-dimensional bulk\ngravity with the Gauss-Bonnet term. We work in the probe limit and give the\n$\\Delta$-T phase diagrams at three different values of the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoefficient to show the effect of the Gauss-Bonnet term. We also construct the\nP-T phase diagrams for the holographic system using two different definitions\nof the pressure and compare the results.\n", "  Thin film magnetic heterostructures with competing interfacial coupling and\nZeeman energy pro- vide a fertile ground to study phase transition between\ndifferent equilibrium states as a function of external magnetic field and\ntemperature. A rare-earth (RE) / transition metal (TM) ferro- magnetic\nmultilayer is a classic example where the magnetic state is determined by a\ncompetition between the Zeeman energy and antiferromagnetic interfacial\nexchange coupling energy. Techno- logically, such structures offer the\npossibility to engineer the macroscopic magnetic response by tuning the\nmicroscopic interactions between the layers. We have performed an exhaustive\nstudy of a nickel/gadolinium system by using the element-specific measurement\ntechnique x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and determined the full magnetic\nstate diagrams as a function of temperature and magnetic layer thickness. We\nexplain our result based on a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth formal- ism and provide\nevidence of a thickness-dependent phase transition to a magnetic fan state\nwhich is critical in understanding magnetoresistance effects in RE/TM systems.\nThe results provide im- portant insight for spintronics and superconducting\nspintronics where engineering tunable magnetic inhomogeneity is key for certain\napplications.\n", "  To increase the attention of students, several physics experiments can be\nperformed at school, as well at home, by using the smartphone as laboratory\ntools. In the paper we describe a mechanical model of the smartphone's\naccelerometer, which can be used in classroom to allow students to better\nunderstand the principle of the accelerometer even by students at the beginning\nof the study in physics.\n", "  Diffusing-Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) treats the transport of photons through\nturbid samples as a diffusion process, thereby making it possible to extract\nthe dynamics of scatterers from measured correlation functions. The analysis of\nDWS data requires knowledge of the path length distribution of photons\ntraveling through the sample. While for flat sample cells this path length\ndistribution can be readily expressed in analytical form, no such expression is\navailable for cylindrical sample cells. DWS measurements have therefore\ntypically relied on dedicated setups that use flat sample cells. Here we show\nhow DWS measurements, in particular DWS-based microrheology measurements, can\nbe performed in standard dynamic light scattering setups that use cylindrical\nsample cells. To do so we perform simple random walk simulations which yield\nnumerical predictions of the path length distribution as a function of both the\ntransport mean free path and the detection angle. This information is used in\nexperiments to extract the mean-square displacement of tracer particles in the\nmaterial, as well as the resulting frequency-dependent viscoelastic response.\nAn important advantage of our approach is that by measuring at different\ndetection angles, the average photon path length can be varied. Using a single\nsample cell, this gives access to a wider range of length and time scales than\nobtained in a conventional DWS setup. Such angle-dependent measurements also\noffer an important consistency check, as for all detection angles the DWS\nanalysis should yield the same tracer dynamics, even though the respective path\nlength distributions are very different. We validate our approach by performing\nmeasurements both on aqueous suspensions of tracer particles and on solid-like\ngelatin samples, for which we find our DWS-based microrheology data to be in\nexcellent agreement with rheological measurements.\n", "  A set of thin film Mn$_x$Si$_{1-x}$ alloy samples with different manganese\nconcentration x = 0.44 - 0.63 grown by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method\nonto the Al$_2$O$_3$(0001) substrate was investigated in the temperature range\n4 - 300 K using ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements in the wide range of\nfrequencies (f = 7 - 60 GHz) and magnetic fields (H = 0 - 30 kOe). For samples\nwith x = 0.52 - 0.55, FMR data show clear evidence of ferromagnetism with high\nCurie temperatures T$_\\text{C}$ ~ 300 K. These samples demonstrate complex and\nunusual character of magnetic anisotropy described in the frame of\nphenomenological model as a combination of the essential second order easy\nplane anisotropy contribution and the additional forth order uniaxial\nanisotropy contribution with easy direction normal to the film plane. We\nexplain the obtained results by a polycrystalline (mosaic) structure of the\nfilms caused by the film-substrate lattice mismatch. The existence of extra\nstrains at the crystallite boundaries leads to an essential inhomogeneous\nmagnetic anisotropy in the film plane.\n", "  Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd showed that for a suitably specified $N \\times N$\nmatrix $A$ and $N$-dimensional vector $\\vec{b}$, there is a quantum algorithm\nthat outputs a quantum state proportional to the solution of the linear system\nof equations $A\\vec{x}=\\vec{b}$. If $A$ is sparse and well-conditioned, their\nalgorithm runs in time $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log N, 1/\\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is\nthe desired precision in the output state. We improve this to an algorithm\nwhose running time is polynomial in $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$, exponentially improving\nthe dependence on precision while keeping essentially the same dependence on\nother parameters. Our algorithm is based on a general technique for\nimplementing any operator with a suitable Fourier or Chebyshev series\nrepresentation. This allows us to bypass the quantum phase estimation\nalgorithm, whose dependence on $\\epsilon$ is prohibitive.\n", "  Linear-time invariant (LTI) oscillation systems such as forced mechanical\nvibration, series RLC and parallel RLC circuits can be solved by using simplest\ninitial conditions or employing of Green's function of which knowledge of\ninitial condition of the force term is needed. Here we show a mathematical\nconnection of the LTI system and the Helmholtz equation form of the\ntime-independent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation in quantum mechanical scattering\nproblem. We apply Born approximation in quantum mechanics to obtain LTI general\nsolution in form of infinite Born series which can be expressed as a series of\none-dimensional Feynman graphs.\n  Conditions corresponding to the approximation are given for the case of\nharmonic driving force. The Born series of the harmonic forced oscillation case\nare derived by directly applying the approximation to the LTI system or by\ntransforming the LTI system to Helmholtz equation prior to doing the\napproximation.\n", "  $^{75}$As NMR measurements were performed on a polycrystalline sample of\nspin-1/2 alternating-spin-chain Heisenberg antiferromagnet AgVOAsO$_4$.\nTemperature-dependent NMR shift $K(T)$, which is a direct measure of the\nintrinsic spin susceptibility, agrees very well with the spin-1/2\nalternating-chain model, justifying the assignment of the spin lattice. From\nthe analysis of $K(T)$, magnetic exchange parameters were estimated as follows:\nthe leading exchange $J/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq 38.4$ K, alternation ratio $\\alpha =\nJ'/J \\simeq 0.68$, and spin gap $\\Delta/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq 15$ K. The transferred\nhyperfine coupling between the $^{75}$As nucleus and V$^{4+}$ spins obtained by\ncomparing the NMR shift with bulk susceptibility amounts to $A_{\\rm hf} \\simeq\n3.3$ T/$\\mu_{\\rm B}$. Our temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate\n$1/T_1(T)$ also shows an activated behaviour at low temperatures, thus\nconfirming the presence of a spin gap in AgVOAsO$_4$.\n", "  Backreaction in the cosmological context is a longstanding problem that is\nespecially important in the present era of precise cosmology. The standard\nmodel of a homogeneous background plus density perturbations is most probably\noversimplified and is expected to fail to fully account for the near-future\nobservations of sub-percent precision. From a theoretical point of view, the\nproblem of backreaction is very complicated and deserves careful examination.\nRecently, Green and Wald claimed in a series of papers to have developed a\nformalism to properly describe the influence of density inhomogeneities on\naverage properties of the Universe, i.e., the backreaction effect. A brief\ndiscussion of this framework is presented, focussing on its drawbacks and on\nmisconceptions that have arisen during the \"backreaction debate\".\n", "  Conserved currents of any spin $t>0$ built from bosonic symmetric massless\ngauge fields of arbitrary integer spins in $AdS_4$ are found. Analogously to\nthe case of $4d$ Minkowski space, currents considered in this paper are not\ngauge invariant but generate gauge invariant conserved charges.\n", "  We prove propagation of chaos at explicit polynomial rates in Wasserstein\ndistance W_2 for Kac's N-particle system associated with the spatially\nhomogeneous Boltzmann equation for Maxwell molecules, with and without cutoff.\nOur approach is mainly based on novel probabilistic coupling techniques.\nCombining them with recent stabilization results for the particle system we\nobtain, under suitable moments assumptions on the initial distribution, a\nuniform-in-time estimate of order almost N^{-1/3} for W_2^2.\n", "  For about a decade, the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak at about 105\nMpc/h has provided a standard ruler test of the LCDM cosmological model, a\nmember of the Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) family of\ncosmological models---according to which comoving space is rigid. However,\ngeneral relativity does not require comoving space to be rigid. During the\nvirialisation epoch, when the most massive structures form by gravitational\ncollapse, it should be expected that comoving space evolves inhomogeneous\ncurvature as structure grows. The BAO peak standard ruler should also follow\nthis inhomogeneous evolution if the comoving rigidity assumption is false. This\n\"standard\" ruler has now been detected to be flexible, as expected under\ngeneral relativity.\n", "  We propose a physically based, analytic model for intergalactic filaments\nduring the first gigayear of the universe. The structure of a filament is based\nupon a gravitationally bound, isothermal cylinder of gas. The model\nsuccessfully predicts for a cosmological simulation the total mass per unit\nlength of a filament (dark matter plus gas) based solely upon the sound speed\nof the gas component, contrary to the expectation for collisionless dark matter\naggregation. It argues that the gas, through its hydrodynamic properties, plays\na key role in filament structure rather than being a passive passenger in a\npreformed dark matter potential. The dark matter of a galaxy follows the\nclassic equation of collapse of a spherically symmetric overdensity in an\nexpanding universe. In contrast, the gas usually collapses more slowly. The\nrelative rates of collapse of these two components for individual galaxies can\nexplain the varying baryon deficits of the galaxies under the assumption that\nmatter moves along a single filament passing through the galaxy centre, rather\nthan by spherical accretion. The difference in behaviour of the dark matter and\ngas can be simply and plausibly related to the model. The range of galaxies\nstudied includes that of the so-called \"too big to fail\" galaxies, which are\nthought to be problematic for the standard Lambda-CDM model of the universe.\nThe isothermal-cylinder model suggests a simple explanation for why these\ngalaxies are, unaccountably, missing from the night sky.\n", "  These are lectures on General Theory of Relativity that were given to\nstudents of the Mathematical Faculty of the Higher School of Economics in\nMoscow.\n", "  The general relativistic description of cosmological structure formation is\nan important challenge from both the theoretical and the numerical point of\nviews. In this paper we present a brief prescription for a general relativistic\ntreatment of structure formation and a resulting mass function on galaxy\ncluster scales in a highly generic scenario. To obtain this we use an exact\nscalar averaging scheme together with the relativistic generalization of\nZel'dovich's approximation (RZA) that serves as a closure condition for the\naveraged equations.\n", "  Ring exchange is an elementary interaction for modeling unconventional\ntopological matters which hold promise for efficient quantum information\nprocessing. We report the observation of four-body ring-exchange interactions\nand the topological properties of anyonic excitations within an ultracold atom\nsystem. A minimum toric code Hamiltonian in which the ring exchange is the\ndominant term, was implemented by engineering a Hubbard Hamiltonian that\ndescribes atomic spins in disconnected plaquette arrays formed by two\northogonal superlattices. The ring-exchange interactions were resolved from the\ndynamical evolutions in the spin orders, matching well with the predicted\nenergy gaps between two anyonic excitations of the spin system. A braiding\noperation was applied to the spins in the plaquettes and an induced phase\n$1.00(3)\\pi$ in the four-spin state was observed, confirming\n$\\frac{1}{2}$-anynoic statistics. This work represents an essential step\ntowards studying topological matters with many-body systems and the\napplications in quantum computation and simulation.\n", "  This work is a continuation of our previous paper [Yermolaevetal2015] which\ndescribes the average temporal profiles of interplanetary plasma and field\nparameters in large-scale solar-wind (SW) streams: CIR, ICME (both MC and\nEjecta) and Sheath as well as the interplanetary shock (IS). Like in the\nprevious work we use data of OMNI database, our catalog of large-scale\nsolar-wind phenomena during 1976--2000 [Yermolaevetal2009] and the double\nsuperposed epoch analysis (DSEA) method [Yermolaevetal2010]: re-scaling the\nduration of interval for all types in such a manner that, respectively,\nbeginning and end for all intervals of selected type coincide. We present new\ndetailed results of comparison of two pair phenomena: (1) both types of\ncompression regions (CIR.vs.Sheath) and (2) both types of ICMEs (MC.vs.Ejecta).\nObtained data allows us to suggest that the formation of all types of\ncompression regions has the same physical mechanism irrespective of piston\n(High-Speed Stream (HSS) or ICME) type and differences are connected with\ngeometry (angle between speed gradient in front of piston and satellite\ntrajectory) and full jumps of speed in edges of compression regions. One of\nconsequences of this hypothesis is the conclusion that one of the reasons of\nobserved distinctions of parameters in MC and Ejecta can be fact that at\nmeasurements of Ejecta the satellite passes further from the nose area of ICME,\nthan at measurements of MC. We also discuss the impact of Sheath in\nmagnetospheric activity and its contribution in estimation of Sun's open\nmagnetic flux.\n", "  We present optical and ultraviolet spectra of SN 1885 (S And), visible in\nabsorption against the bulge of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope's STIS spectrograph to probe the three dimensional arrangement\nof the supernova debris. Spectra covering 2900 to 5700 A taken using six 0.2\"\nslit positions in two orientations show broad Ca II absorption with blue and\nred radial velocities out to at least 11,500 km/s, consistent with HST Ca II\nimages of S And. Enhanced Ca II absorption is seen between 2000 to 6000 km/s\nsuggestive of a Ca II-rich shell. The spectra also show strong, asymmetric Ca I\n4227 A absorption extending out to +12,400 km/s, along with weak Fe I 3720 A\nabsorption in a shell with velocities between 2000 and 9000 km/s. Ultraviolet\nspectra obtained revealed weak broad absorption shortward of 3000 A consistent\nwith model predictions. The STIS spectra, together with previous HST images,\nshow a layered structure with a well defined Ca-rich outer edge indicative of a\ndelayed detonation phase. The remnant's clumpy inner Ca-rich shell plus only a\nhandful of Fe-rich plumes is unlike morphologies expected from dynamical or\nviolent merger scenarios. The small number of Fe-rich plumes suggest their\nformation during a deflagration phase by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities but less\nwell developed without extended mixing as expected from hydrodynamic\ncalculations. The suppression of strong Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is\npossibly the result of strong magnetic fields. We propose SN 1885 was an\noff-center, delayed detonation and slightly subluminous SN Ia similar to SN\n1986g.\n", "  The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is a flexible and powerful\ntechnique for rigorously solving Maxwell's equations. However,\nthree-dimensional optical nonlinearity in current commercial and research FDTD\nsoftwares requires solving iteratively an implicit form of Maxwell's equations\nover the entire numerical space and at each time step. Reaching numerical\nconvergence demands significant computational resources and practical\nimplementation often requires major modifications to the core FDTD engine. In\nthis paper, we present an explicit method to include second and third order\noptical nonlinearity in the FDTD framework based on a nonlinear generalization\nof the Lorentz dispersion model. A formal derivation of the nonlinear Lorentz\ndispersion equation is equally provided, starting from the quantum mechanical\nequations describing nonlinear optics in the two-level approximation. With the\nproposed approach, numerical integration of optical nonlinearity and dispersion\nin FDTD is intuitive, transparent, and fully explicit. A strong-field\nformulation is also proposed, which opens an interesting avenue for FDTD-based\nmodelling of the extreme nonlinear optics phenomena involved in laser\nfilamentation and femtosecond micromachining of dielectrics.\n", "  We present a minimal left-right dark matter framework that can simultaneously\nexplain the recently observed 3.55 keV X-ray line from several galaxy clusters\nand gauge coupling unification at high energy scale. Adopting a minimal dark\nmatter strategy, we consider both left and right handed triplet fermionic dark\nmatter candidates which are stable by virtue of a remnant $\\mathcal{Z}_2\\simeq\n(-1)^{B-L}$ symmetry arising after the spontaneous symmetry breaking of\nleft-right gauge symmetry to that of the standard model. A scalar bitriplet\nfield is incorporated whose first role is to allow radiative decay of right\nhanded triplet dark matter into the left handed one and a photon with energy\n3.55 keV. The other role this bitriplet field at TeV scale plays is to assist\nin achieving gauge coupling unification at a high energy scale within a\nnon-supersymmetric $SO(10)$ model while keeping the scale of left-right gauge\nsymmetry around the TeV corner. Apart from solving the neutrino mass problem\nand giving verifiable new contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay and\ncharged lepton flavour violation, the model with TeV scale gauge bosons can\nalso give rise to interesting collider signatures like diboson excess, dilepton\nplus two jets excess reported recently in the large hadron collider data.\n", "  In the framework of Hofstadter`s approach we provide a detailed analysis of a\nrealization of exotic topological states such as the Chern insulator with large\nChern numbers. In a transverse homogeneous magnetic field a one-particle\nspectrum of fermions transforms to an intricate spectrum with a fine\ntopological structure of the subbands. In a weak magnetic field $H$ for a\nrational magnetic flux, a topological phase with a large Chern number is\nrealized near the half filling. There is an abnormal behavior of the Hall\nconductance ${\\sigma_{xy}\\simeq \\frac{e}{2 H}}$. At half-filling, the number of\nchiral Majorana fermion edge states increases sharply forming a new state,\ncalled the chiral Majorana fermion liquid.\n", "  I work on a set of Feynman rules that were derived in order to incorporate\nthe constraint of Gauss's law in the perturbation expansion of gauge field\ntheories and calculate the interaction energy of two static sources. The\nconstraint is implemented via a Lagrange multiplier field, $\\lambda$, which, in\nthe case of the non-Abelian theory, develops a radiatively generated effective\npotential term. After analysing the contributions of various solutions for\n$\\lambda$, the confining properties and the various phases of the theory are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In recent years, the study on the Kondo insulator SmB6, a strongly correlated\nelectron material with decades-long puzzles, has become one of the most\nattractive topics again because the discovery of the coexistence of its unusual\nmetallic surface state with an insulating bulk. Many efforts have been made in\nunderstanding the corresponding physics behind in SmB6, but some puzzles on it,\nbeing hotly debated and argued, has not been solved. In this article, based on\nthe latest progress in our high pressure studies and the accumulating results\nreported by other groups on SmB6, we propose a notion named as accompany-type\nvalence fluctuation state, which possibly coexists with the Kondo ground state\nof SmB6. The purpose of this article is to search a common starting point from\nwhich most of the accumulated low-temperature phenomena observed by different\nexperimental investigations on SmB6 could be understood in a unified way.\nAlthough this notion is only our personal understanding from a phenomenological\npoint of view and may be immature, anyway, we expect that this notion could\nattract rigorous theoretical interpretations and further experimental\ninvestigations, or stimulate better thinking on the physics in SmB6.\n", "  We study inelastic vibration-assisted charge transfer effects in two-site\nmolecular junctions, focusing on signatures of vibrational anharmonicity on the\nelectrical characteristics and the thermoelectric response of the junction. We\nconsider three types of oscillators: harmonic, anharmonic-Morse allowing bond\ndissociation, and harmonic-quartic, mimicking a confinement potential. Using a\nquantum master equation method which is perturbative in the electron-vibration\ninteraction we find that the (inelastic) electrical and thermal conductances\ncan be largely affected by the nature of the vibrational potential. In\ncontrast, the Seebeck coefficient, the thermoelectric figure-of-merit, and the\nthermoelectric efficiency beyond linear response, conceal this information,\nshowing a rather weak sensitivity to vibrational anharmonicity. Our work\nillustrates that anharmonic (many-body) effects, consequential to the\ncurrent-voltage characteristics, are of little effect for the thermoelectric\nperformance.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of extracting energy from a single thermal bath\nusing microcanonical Szil\\'ard engines operating in finite time. This extends\nprevious works on the topic which are restricted to the quasistatic regime. The\nfeedback protocol is implemented based on linear response predictions of the\nexcess work. It is claimed that the underlying mechanism leading to energy\nextraction does not violate Liouville's theorem and preserves ergodicity\nthroughout the cycle. We illustrate our results with several examples including\nan exactly solvable model.\n", "  We revisit the estimation of the combined mass of the Milky Way and Andromeda\n(M31), which dominate the mass of the Local Group. We make use of an ensemble\nof 30,190 halo pairs from the Small MultiDark simulation, assuming a\n$\\Lambda$CDM (Cosmological Constant with Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, to\ninvestigate the relationship between the bound mass and parameters\ncharacterising the orbit of the binary and their local environment with the aid\nof machine learning methods (artificial neural networks, ANN). Results from the\nANN are most successful when information about the velocity shear is provided,\nwhich demonstrates the flexibility of machine learning to model physical\nphenomena and readily incorporate new information as it becomes available. The\nresulting estimate for the Local Group mass, when shear information is\nincluded, is $4.9 \\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$, with an error of $\\pm0.8 \\times\n10^{12} M_\\odot$ from the 68% uncertainty in observables, and a 68% confidence\ninterval of $^{+1.3}_{-1.4} \\times 10^{12}M_\\odot$ from the intrinsic scatter\nfrom the differences between the model and simulation masses. We also consider\na recently reported large transverse velocity of M31 relative to the Milky Way,\nand produce an alternative mass estimate of $3.6\\pm0.3\\pm1.4 \\times\n10^{12}M_\\odot$. Although different methods predict similar values for the most\nlikely mass of the LG, application of ANN compared to the Timing Argument\nreduces the scatter in the log mass by over half when tested on samples from\nthe simulation.\n", "  We propose a general method for constructing a minimal cover of\nhigh-dimensional chaotic attractors by embedded coherent structures, such as\n(but not limited to) periodic orbits. By minimal cover we mean a subset of\navailable coherent structures such that the approximation of chaotic dynamics\nby a minimal cover with a predefined proximity threshold is as good as the\napproximation by the full available set. The proximity measure can be chosen\nwith considerable freedom and adapted to the properties of any given chaotic\nsystem. In the context of a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic attractor, we\ndemonstrate that the minimal cover can be faithfully constructed even when the\nproximity measure is defined within a subspace of dimension much smaller than\nthe dimension of space containing the attractor. We discuss how the minimal\ncover can be used to provide a reduced description of the attractor structure\nand the dynamics on it.\n", "  Rotating scroll waves are self-organising patterns which are found in many\noscillating or excitable systems. Here we show that quasi-periodic (meandering)\nscroll waves, which include the rotors that organise cardiac arrhythmias,\nexhibit filament tension when averaged over the meander cycle. With strong\nfilament curvature or medium thickness gradients, however, scroll wave dynamics\nare governed by phase-locked drift instead of filament tension. Our results are\nvalidated in computational models of cycloidal meander and a cardiac tissue\nmodel with linear core.\n", "  Both inflationary and ekpyrotic scenarios can account for the origin of the\nlarge scale structure of the universe. It is often said that detecting\nprimordial gravitational waves is the key to distinguish both scenarios. We\nshow that this is not true if the gauge kinetic function is present in the\nekpyrotic scenario. In fact, primordial gravitational waves sourced by the\ngauge field can be produced in an ekpyrotic universe. We also study scalar\nfluctuations sourced by the gauge field and show that it is negligible compared\nto primordial gravitational waves. This comes from the fact that the fast roll\ncondition holds in ekpyrotic models.\n", "  \\emph{Hitomi} observations of Perseus with the Soft X-ray Spectrometer (SXS)\nprovide a high-resolution look at the 3.5 keV feature reported by multiple\ngroups in the Perseus cluster. The \\emph{Hitomi} spectrum -- which involves the\nsum of diffuse cluster emission and the point-like central Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) -- does not show any excess at $E \\sim 3.5 {\\rm keV}$, giving an\napparent inconsistency with previous observations of excess diffuse emission.\nWe point out that 2009 \\emph{Chandra} data reveals a strong dip in the AGN\nspectrum at $E = (3.54 \\pm 0.02) {\\rm keV}$ (cluster frame) -- the identical\nenergy to the diffuse excess observed by \\emph{XMM-Newton}. Scaling this dip to\nthe 2016 AGN luminosity and adding it to the diffuse \\emph{XMM-Newton} excess,\nthis predicts an overall dip in the SXS field of view of $(-5.9 \\pm 4.4) \\times\n10^{-6} \\, {\\rm ph} \\, {\\rm cm}^{-2} \\, {\\rm s}^{-1}$ at $E= 3.54$ keV -- a\nprecise match to the \\emph{Hitomi} data when broadened by the dark matter\nvirial velocity. We describe models of Fluorescent Dark Matter that can\nreproduce this physics, in which dark matter absorbs and then re-emits 3.5 keV\nphotons emitted from the central AGN.\n", "  Reduction of the $\\eta$-deformed sigma model on ${\\rm AdS}_5 \\times {\\rm\nS}^5$ to the two-dimensional squashed sphere $({\\rm S}^2)_{\\eta}$ can be viewed\nas a special case of the Fateev sausage model where the coupling constant $\\nu$\nis imaginary. We show that geodesic motion in this model is described by a\ncertain superintegrable mechanical system with four-dimensional phase space.\nThis is done by means of explicitly constructing three integrals of motion\nwhich satisfy the $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ Poisson algebra relations, albeit being\nnon-polynomial in momenta. Further, we find a canonical transformation which\ntransforms the Hamiltonian of this mechanical system to the one describing the\ngeodesic motion on the usual two-sphere. By inverting this transformation we\nmap geodesics on this auxiliary two-sphere back to the sausage model. This\npaper is a tribute to the memory of Prof. Petr Kulish.\n", "  The ability to reason beyond established knowledge allows Organic Chemists to\nsolve synthetic problems and to invent novel transformations. Here, we propose\na model which mimics chemical reasoning and formalises reaction prediction as\nfinding missing links in a knowledge graph. We have constructed a knowledge\ngraph containing 14.4 million molecules and 8.2 million binary reactions, which\nrepresents the bulk of all chemical reactions ever published in the scientific\nliterature. Our model outperforms a rule-based expert system in the reaction\nprediction task for 180,000 randomly selected binary reactions. We show that\nour data-driven model generalises even beyond known reaction types, and is thus\ncapable of effectively (re-) discovering novel transformations (even including\ntransition-metal catalysed reactions). Our model enables computers to infer\nhypotheses about reactivity and reactions by only considering the intrinsic\nlocal structure of the graph, and because each single reaction prediction is\ntypically achieved in a sub-second time frame, our model can be used as a\nhigh-throughput generator of reaction hypotheses for reaction discovery.\n", "  We present the \"Galaxy Cluster Merger Catalog.\" This catalog provides an\nextensive suite of mock observations and related data for N-body and\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy cluster mergers and clusters from\ncosmological simulations. These mock observations consist of projections of a\nnumber of important observable quantities in several different wavebands as\nwell as along different lines of sight through each simulation domain. The web\ninterface to the catalog consists of easily browseable images over epoch and\nprojection direction, as well as download links for the raw data and a JS9\ninterface for interactive data exploration. The data is presented within a\nconsistent format so that comparison between simulations is straightforward.\nAll of the data products are provided in the standard FITS file format. Data is\nbeing stored on the yt Hub (http://hub.yt), which allows for remote access and\nanalysis using a Jupyter notebook server. Future versions of the catalog will\ninclude simulations from a number of research groups and a variety of research\ntopics related to the study of interactions of galaxy clusters with each other\nand with their member galaxies. The catalog is located at http://gcmc.hub.yt.\n", "  We propose a framework in which Weinberg's anthropic explanation of the\ncosmological constant problem also solves the hierarchy problem. The weak scale\nis selected by chiral dynamics that controls the stabilization of an extra\ndimension. When the Higgs vacuum expectation value is close to a fermion mass\nscale, the radius of an extra dimension becomes large, and develops an enhanced\nnumber of vacua available to scan the cosmological constant down to its\nobserved value. At low energies, the radion necessarily appears as an\nunnaturally light scalar, in a range of masses and couplings accessible to\nfifth-force searches as well as scalar dark matter searches with atomic clocks\nand gravitational-wave detectors. The fermion sector that controls the size of\nthe extra dimension consists of a pair of electroweak doublets and several\nsinglets. These leptons satisfy approximate mass relations related to the weak\nscale and are accessible to the LHC and future colliders.\n", "  In view of new experimental data the instability against adiabatic\nnonaxisymmetric perturbations of a Taylor-Couette flow with an axial density\nstratification is considered in dependence of the Reynolds number Re of\nrotation and the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a number Rn of the stratification. The flows\nat and beyond the Rayleigh limit become unstable between a lower and an upper\nReynolds number (for fixed Rn). The rotation can thus be too slow or too fast\nfor the stratorotational instability. The upper Reynolds number above which the\ninstability decays, has its maximum value for the potential flow (driven by\ncylinders rotating according to the Rayleigh limit) and decreases strongly for\nflatter rotation profiles finally leaving only isolated islands of instability\nin the (Rn/Re) map. The maximal possible rotation ratio $\\mu_{\\rm max}$ only\nslightly exceeds the shear value of the quasi-uniform flow with\n$U_\\phi\\simeq$const.\n  Along and between the lines of neutral stability the wave numbers of the\ninstability patterns for all rotation laws beyond the Rayleigh limit are mainly\ndetermined by the Froude number Fr which is defined by the ratio between Re and\nRn. The cells are highly prolate for Fr>1 so that measurements for too high\nReynolds numbers become difficult for axially bounded containers. The\ninstability patterns migrate azimuthally slightly faster than the outer\ncylinder rotates.\n", "  The Ising model in two dimensions with special toroidal boundary conditions\nis analyzed. These boundary condition, which we call duality twisted boundary\nconditions, may be interpreted as inserting a specific defect line (\"seam\") in\nthe system, along non-contractible circles of the cylinder, before closing it\ninto a torus. We derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues of the transfer\nmatrix for the critical ferromagnetic Ising model on the M x N square lattice\nwrapped on the torus with a specific defect line. As result we have obtained\nanalytically the partition function for the Ising model with such boundary\nconditions. In the case of infinitely long cylinders of circumference L with\nduality twisted boundary conditions we obtain the asymptotic expansion of the\nfree energy and the inverse correlation lengths. We find that the ratio of\nsubdominant finite-size correction terms in the asymptotic expansion of the\nfree energy and the inverse correlation lengths should be universal. We verify\nsuch universal behavior in the framework of perturbating conformal approach by\ncalculating the universal structure constant Cn1n for descendent states\ngenerated by the operator product expansion (OPE) of the primary fields. For\nsuch states the calculations of the universal structure constants is difficult\ntask, since its involve the knowledge of the four-point correlation function,\nwhich in general does not fix by conformal invariance except for some\nparticular cases, including the Ising model.\n", "  We study interaction effects, including both long-ranged Coulomb and\nshort-range interactions, in three-dimensional topological triple-Weyl\nsemimetals whose triple-Weyl points are protected by crystal symmetries. By\nperforming Wilsonian renormalization group analysis of the low-energy effective\nfield theory of the minimal model with triple-Weyl nodes, we find that the\nfixed point of noninteracting triple-Weyl fermions is unstable in the presence\nof Coulomb interactions and flows to a nontrivial stable fixed point\nrepresenting marginal Fermi liquids with anisotropic screening effects. We\nfurther discuss relevant unusual physical consequences due to the novel\nbehavior of correlation effects in this system.\n", "  In this paper heavy quark energy loss models are embedded in full\nevent-by-event viscous hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the nuclear\nsuppression factor and azimuthal anisotropy of D$^0$ mesons in PbPb collisions\nat 5.02 TeV in the $p_T$ range 8-40 GeV. In our model calculations, the\n$R_\\text{AA}$ of D$^0$ mesons is consistent with experimental data from the CMS\nexperiment. We present the first calculations of heavy flavor cumulants\n$v_2\\{2\\}$ and $v_3\\{2\\}$ (and also discuss $v_2\\{4\\}$), which is also\nconsistent with experimental data. Event-shape engineering techniques are used\nto compute the event-by-event correlation between the soft hadron $v_n$ and the\nheavy meson $v_n$. We predict a linear correlation between these observables on\nan event-by-event basis.\n", "  We investigate the static and dynamic properties of a weakly polydisperse\nhard sphere system in the deeply supercooled state, i.e. at densities higher\nthan that corresponding to the mode-coupling transition. The structural\nanalysis reveals the emergence of icosahedral locally favoured structures,\npreviously only found in trace quantities. We present a new approach to probe\nthe shape of dynamically heterogeneous regions, which is insensitive to\nparticle packing effects that can hamper such analysis. Our results indicate\nthat the shape of the dynamically heterogeneous regions changes only weakly and\nmoreover hint that the often-used four-point correlation length may exhibit a\ngrowth in excess of that which our method identifies. The growth of the size of\nthe dynamically heterogeneous regions appears instead to be in line with the\none of structural and dynamic propensity correlations.\n", "  We consider a binary Lennard-Jones glassformer whose super-Arrhenius dynamics\nare correlated with the formation of particles organized into icosahedra under\nsimple steady state shear. We recast this glassformer as an effective system of\nicosahedra [Pinney et al. J. Chem. Phys. 143 244507 (2015)]. From the observed\npopulation of icosahedra in each steady state, we obtain an effective\ntemperature which is linearly dependent on the shear rate in the range\nconsidered. Upon shear banding, the system separates into a region of high\nshear rate and a region of low shear rate. The effective temperatures obtained\nin each case show that the low shear regions correspond to a significantly\nlower temperature than the high shear regions. Taking a weighted average of the\neffective temperature of these regions (weight determined by region size)\nyields an estimate of the effective temperature which compares well with an\neffective temperature based on the global mesocluster population of the whole\nsystem.\n", "  The scalar dipole polarizabilities, $\\alpha_{E1}$ and $\\beta_{M1}$, are\nfundamental properties related to the internal dynamics of the nucleon. The\ncurrently accepted values of the proton polarizabilities were determined by\nfitting to unpolarized proton Compton scattering cross section data. The\nmeasurement of the beam asymmetry $\\Sigma_{3}$ in a certain kinematical range\nprovides an alternative approach to the extraction of the scalar\npolarizabilities. At the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) the beam asymmetry was measured\nfor Compton scattering below pion photoproduction threshold for the first time.\nThe results are compared with model calculations and the influence of the\nexperimental data on the extraction of the scalar polarizabilities is\ndetermined.\n", "  A Hamiltonian approach to the equations of general relativity is proposed\nusing the powerful mathematical language of multivector-valued differential\nforms. In the approach, the gravitational coordinates are the 12 spatial\ncomponents of the line interval (the vierbein) including their antisymmetric\nparts, and their 12 conjugate momenta. A feature of the proposed formalism is\nthat it allows Lorentz gauge freedoms to be imposed on the Lorentz connections\nrather than on the vierbein, which may facilitate numerical integration in some\nchallenging problems. The 40 Hamilton's equations comprise 12 + 12 = 24\nequations of motion, 10 constraint equations (first class constraints, which\nmust be arranged on the initial hypersurface of constant time, but which are\nguaranteed thereafter by conservation laws), and 6 identities (second class\nconstraints). The 6 identities define a trace-free spatial tensor that is the\ngravitational analog of the magnetic field of electromagnetism. If the\ngravitational magnetic field is promoted to an independent field satisfying its\nown equation of motion, then the system becomes the WEBB system, which is known\nto be strongly hyperbolic. Some other approaches, including ADM, BSSN, WEBB,\nand Loop Quantum Gravity, are translated into the language of\nmultivector-valued forms, bringing out their underlying mathematical structure.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the p+$i$p superfluid phases in the complex\nvector field holographic p-wave model. We find that in the probe limit, the\np+$i$p phase and the p-wave phase are equally stable, hence the p and $i$p\norders can be mixed with an arbitrary ratio to form more general p+$\\lambda i$p\nphases, which are also equally stable with the p-wave and p+$i$p phases. As a\nresult, the system possesses a degenerate thermal state in the superfluid\nregion. We further study the case with considering the back reaction on the\nmetric, and find that the degenerate ground states will be separated into\np-wave and p+$i$p phases, and the p-wave phase is more stable. Finally, due to\nthe different critical temperature of the zeroth order phase transitions from\np-wave and p+$i$p phases to the normal phase, there is a temperature region\nwhere the p+$i$p phase exists but the p-wave phase doesn't. In this region we\nfind the stable p+$i$p phase for the first time.\n", "  A systematic analysis of the structure of single-baryon correlation functions\ncalculated with lattice QCD is performed, with a particular focus on\ncharacterizing the structure of the noise associated with quantum fluctuations.\nThe signal-to-noise problem in these correlation functions is shown, as long\nsuspected, to result from a sign problem. The log-magnitude and complex phase\nare found to be approximately described by normal and wrapped normal\ndistributions respectively. Properties of circular statistics are used to\nunderstand the emergence of a large time noise region where standard energy\nmeasurements are unreliable. Power-law tails in the distribution of baryon\ncorrelation functions, associated with stable distributions and \"Levy flights\",\nare found to play a central role in their time evolution. A new method of\nanalyzing correlation functions is considered for which the signal-to-noise\nratio of energy measurements is constant, rather than exponentially degrading,\nwith increasing source-sink separation time. This new method includes an\nadditional systematic uncertainty that can be removed by performing an\nextrapolation, and the signal-to-noise problem re-emerges in the statistics of\nthis extrapolation. It is demonstrated that this new method allows accurate\nresults for the nucleon mass to be extracted from the large-time noise region\ninaccessible to standard methods. The observations presented here are expected\nto apply to quantum Monte Carlo calculations more generally. Similar methods to\nthose introduced here may lead to practical improvements in analysis of noisier\nsystems.\n", "  Understanding how spins move in time and space is the aim of both fundamental\nand applied research in modern magnetism. Over the past three decades, research\nin this field has led to technological advances that have had a major impact on\nour society, while improving the understanding of the fundamentals of spin\nphysics. However, important questions still remain unanswered, because it is\nexperimentally challenging to directly observe spins and their motion with a\ncombined high spatial and temporal resolution. In this article, we present an\noverview of the recent advances in X-ray microscopy that allow researchers to\ndirectly watch spins move in time and space at the microscopically relevant\nscales. We discuss scanning X-ray transmission microscopy (STXM) at resonant\nsoft X-ray edges, which is available at most modern synchrotron light sources.\nThis technique measures magnetic contrast through the X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) effect at the resonant absorption edges, while focusing the\nX-ray radiation at the nanometre scale, and using the intrinsic pulsed\nstructure of synchrotron-generated X-rays to create time-resolved images of\nmagnetism at the nanoscale. In particular, we discuss how the presence of spin\ncurrents can be detected by imaging spin accumulation, and how the\nmagnetisation dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films can be directly imaged. We\ndiscuss how a direct look at the phenomena allows for a deeper understanding of\nthe the physics at play, that is not accessible to other, more indirect\ntechniques. Finally, we present an overview of the exciting opportunities that\nlie ahead to further understand the fundamentals of novel spin physics,\nopportunities offered by the appearance of diffraction limited storage rings\nand free electron lasers.\n", "  Parity- and time reversal-violating (PVTV) pion-nucleon couplings govern the\nmagnitude of long-range contributions to nucleon and atomic electric dipole\nmoments. When these couplings arise from chiral symmetry-breaking CP-violating\noperators, such as the QCD $\\theta$-term or quark chromoelectric dipole\nmoments, one may relate hadronic matrix elements entering the PVTV couplings to\nnucleon and pion mass shifts by exploiting the corresponding chiral\ntransformation properties at leading order (LO) in the chiral expansion. We\ncompute the higher-order contributions to the lowest order relations arising\nfrom chiral loops and next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) operators. We find\nthat for the QCD $\\theta$-term the higher order contributions are analytic in\nthe quark masses, while for the quark chromoelectric dipole moments and chiral\nsymmetry-breaking four-quark operators, the matching relations also receive\nnon-analytic corrections. Numerical estimates suggest that for the isoscalar\nPVTV pion-nucleon coupling, the higher order corrections may be as large as\n$\\sim 20\\%$, while for the isovector coupling, more substantial corrections are\npossible.\n", "  We present a method for efficiently enumerating all allowed, topologically\ndistinct, electronic band structures within a given crystal structure. The\nalgorithm applies to crystals with broken time-reversal, particle-hole, and\nchiral symmetries in any dimension. The presented results match the\nmathematical structure underlying the topological classification of these\ncrystals in terms of K-theory, and therefore elucidate this abstract\nmathematical framework from a simple combinatorial perspective. Using a\nstraightforward counting procedure, we classify the allowed topological phases\nin any possible two-dimensional crystal in class A. We also show how the same\nprocedure can be used to classify the allowed phases for any three-dimensional\nspace group. Employing these classifications, we study transitions between\ntopological phases within class A that are driven by band inversions at high\nsymmetry points in the first Brillouin zone. This enables us to list all\npossible types of phase transitions within a given crystal structure, and\nidentify whether or not they give rise to intermediate Weyl semimetallic\nphases.\n", "  We study the asymptotics of the global fluctuations for the difference\nbetween two adjacent levels in the $\\beta$--Jacobi corners process (multilevel\nand general $\\beta$ extension of the classical Jacobi ensemble of random\nmatrices). The limit is identified with the derivative of the $2d$ Gaussian\nFree Field. Our main tools are integral forms for the (Macdonald-type)\ndifference operators originating from the shuffle algebra.\n", "  We study how to suppress multiphoton emission background in QED against\nradiative emission of neutrino pair (RENP) from atoms. We purse the possibility\nof background suppression using the photonic band structure of periodic\ndielectric media, called photonic crystals. The modification of photon emission\nrate in photonic crystal waveguides is quantitatively examined to clarify the\ncondition of background-free RENP.\n", "  We explore nonlinear photoemission in cesium telluride (Cs$_2$Te)\nphotocathodes where an ultrashort ($\\sim 100$ fs full width at half max) 800-nm\ninfrared laser is used as the drive-laser in lieu of the typical $\\sim 266$-nm\nultraviolet laser. An important figure of merit for photocathodes, the quantum\nefficiency, we define here for nonlinear photoemission processes in order to\ncompare with linear photoemission. The charge against drive-laser (infrared)\nenergy is studied for different laser energy and intensity values and\ncross-compared with previously performed similar studies on copper [P. Musumeci\net al., \\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.}, \\textbf{104}, 084801 (2010)], a metallic\nphotocathode. We particularly observe two-photon photoemission in Cs$_2$Te\nusing the infrared laser in contrast to the anticipated three-photon process as\nobserved for metallic photocathodes.\n", "  Recently the AMS-02 collaboration has published the measurement of the cosmic\nantiproton to proton ratio $\\bar{p}/p$ and the $\\bar{p}$ flux with a high\nprecision up to $\\sim 450\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$. In this work, we perform a systematic\nanalysis of the secondary antiproton flux generated by the cosmic ray\ninteraction with the interstellar gas. The uncertainty of the prediction\noriginates from the cosmic ray propagation process and the hadronic interaction\nmodels. Although the cosmic ray propagation parameters have been well\ncontrolled by the AMS-02 $B/C$ ratio data for a specified model, different\npropagation models can not be discriminated by the $B/C$ data. The $\\bar{p}$\nflux is also calculated for several hadronic interaction models, which are\ngenerally adopted by the cosmic ray community. However, the results for\ndifferent hadronic models do not converge. We find the EPOS LHC model, which\nseems to fit the collider data very well, predicts a slightly lower $\\bar{p}/p$\nratio than the AMS-02 data at the high energy end. Finally we derive the\nconstraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section from the AMS-02\n$\\bar{p}/p$ ratio for different propagation and hadronic interaction models.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection in relativistic collisionless plasmas can accelerate\nparticles and power high-energy emission in various astrophysical systems.\nWhereas most previous studies focused on relativistic reconnection in pair\nplasmas, less attention has been paid to electron-ion plasma reconnection,\nexpected in black hole accretion flows and relativistic jets. We report a\ncomprehensive particle-in-cell numerical investigation of reconnection in an\nelectron-ion plasma, spanning a wide range of ambient ion magnetizations\n$\\sigma_i$, from the semirelativistic regime (ultrarelativistic electrons but\nnonrelativistic ions, 0.001<<$\\sigma_i$<<1) to the fully relativistic regime\n(both species are ultrarelativistic, $\\sigma_i$>>1). We investigate how the\nreconnection rate, electron and ion plasma flows, electric and magnetic field\nstructures, electron/ion energy partitioning, and nonthermal particle\nacceleration depend on $\\sigma_i$. Our key findings are: (1) the reconnection\nrate is about 0.1 of the Alfvenic rate across all regimes; (2) electrons can\nform concentrated moderately relativistic outflows even in the\nsemirelativistic, small-$\\sigma_i$ regime; (3) while the released magnetic\nenergy is partitioned equally between electrons and ions in the\nultrarelativistic limit, the electron energy fraction declines gradually with\ndecreased $\\sigma_i$ and asymptotes to about 0.25 in the semirelativistic\nregime; (4) reconnection leads to efficient nonthermal electron acceleration\nwith a $\\sigma_i$-dependent power-law index, $p(\\sigma_i) \\simeq $const$+0.7\n{\\sigma_i}^{-1/2}$. These findings are important for understanding black hole\nsystems and lend support to semirelativistic reconnection models for powering\nnonthermal emission in blazar jets, offering a natural explanation for the\nspectral indices observed in these systems.\n", "  Reconstruction of structure and parameters of an Ising model from binary\nsamples is a problem of practical importance in a variety of disciplines,\nranging from statistical physics and computational biology to image processing\nand machine learning. The focus of the research community shifted towards\ndeveloping universal reconstruction algorithms which are both computationally\nefficient and require the minimal amount of expensive data. We introduce a new\nmethod, Interaction Screening, which accurately estimates the model parameters\nusing local optimization problems. The algorithm provably achieves perfect\ngraph structure recovery with an information-theoretically optimal number of\nsamples, notably in the low-temperature regime which is known to be the hardest\nfor learning. The efficacy of Interaction Screening is assessed through\nextensive numerical tests on synthetic Ising models of various topologies with\ndifferent types of interactions, as well as on a real data produced by a D-Wave\nquantum computer. This study shows that the Interaction Screening method is an\nexact, tractable and optimal technique universally solving the inverse Ising\nproblem.\n", "  The promise of quantum neural nets, which utilize quantum effects to model\ncomplex data sets, has made their development an aspirational goal for quantum\nmachine learning and quantum computing in general. Here we provide new methods\nof training quantum Boltzmann machines, which are a class of recurrent quantum\nneural network. Our work generalizes existing methods and provides new\napproaches for training quantum neural networks that compare favorably to\nexisting methods. We further demonstrate that quantum Boltzmann machines enable\na form of quantum state tomography that not only estimates a state but provides\na perscription for generating copies of the reconstructed state. Classical\nBoltzmann machines are incapable of this. Finally we compare small\nnon-stoquastic quantum Boltzmann machines to traditional Boltzmann machines for\ngenerative tasks and observe evidence that quantum models outperform their\nclassical counterparts.\n", "  We analyze the Chern-Simons-like term generation in the CPT-odd\nLorentz-violating Yang-Mills theory interacting with fermions. Moreover, we\nstudy the anomalies of this model as well as its quantum stability. The whole\nanalysis is performed within the algebraic renormalization theory, which is\nindependent of the renormalization scheme. In addition, all results are valid\nto all orders in perturbation theory. We find that the Chern-Simons-like term\nis not generated by radiative corrections, just like its Abelian version.\nAdditionally, the model is also free of gauge anomalies and quantum stable.\n", "  We study the effect of nonquadrupolar modes in the detection and parameter\nestimation of gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole binaries with\nnonprecessing spins, using Advanced LIGO. We evaluate the loss of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the systematic errors in the estimated\nparameters when a quadrupole-mode template family is used to detect GW signals\nwith all the relevant modes. Target signals including nonquadrupole modes are\nconstructed by matching numerical-relativity simulations of nonprecessing black\nhole binaries describing the late inspiral, merger and ringdown with\npost-Newtonian/effective-one-body waveforms describing the early inspiral. We\nfind that neglecting nonquadrupole modes will, in general, cause unacceptable\nloss in the detection rate and unacceptably large systematic errors in the\nestimated parameters, for the case of massive binaries with large mass ratios.\nFor a given mass ratio, neglecting subdominant modes will result in a larger\nloss in the detection rate for binaries with aligned spins. For binaries with\nantialigned spins, quadrupole-mode templates are more effectual in detection,\nat the cost of introducing a larger systematic bias in the parameter\nestimation. We provide a summary of the regions in the parameter space where\nneglecting nonquadrupole modes will cause an unacceptable loss of detection\nrates and unacceptably large systematic biases in the estimated parameters.\n", "  The SUperluminous Supernova Host galaxIES (SUSHIES) survey aims to provide\nstrong new constraints on the progenitors of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe)\nby understanding the relationship to their host galaxies. We present the\nphotometric properties of 53 H-poor and 16 H-rich SLSN host galaxies out to\n$z\\sim4$. We model their spectral energy distributions to derive physical\nproperties, which we compare with other galaxy populations. At low redshift,\nH-poor SLSNe are preferentially found in very blue, low-mass galaxies with high\naverage specific star-formation rates. As redshift increases, the host\npopulation follows the general evolution of star-forming galaxies towards more\nluminous galaxies. After accounting for secular evolution, we find evidence for\ndifferential evolution in galaxy mass, but not in the $B$-band and the far UV\nluminosity ($3\\sigma$ confidence). Most remarkable is the scarcity of hosts\nwith stellar masses above $10^{10}~M_\\odot$ for both classes of SLSNe. In the\ncase of H-poor SLSNe, we attribute this to a stifled production efficiency\nabove $\\sim0.4$ solar metallicity. However, we argue that, in addition to low\nmetallicity, a short-lived stellar population is also required to regulate the\nSLSN production. H-rich SLSNe are found in a very diverse population of\nstar-forming galaxies. Still, the scarcity of massive hosts suggests a stifled\nproduction efficiency above $\\sim0.8$ solar metallicity. The large dispersion\nof the H-rich SLSNe host properties is in stark contrast to those of gamma-ray\nburst, regular core-collapse SN, and H-poor SLSNe host galaxies. We propose\nthat multiple progenitor channels give rise to this sub-class.\n", "  Variation of the speed of light is quite a debated issue in cosmology with\nsome benefits, but also with some controversial concerns. Many approaches to\ndevelop a consistent varying speed of light (VSL) theory have been developed\nrecently. Although a lot of theoretical debate has sprout out about their\nfeasibility and reliability, the most obvious and straightforward way to\ndiscriminate and check if such theories are really workable has been missed out\nor not fully employed. What is meant here is the comparison of these theories\nwith observational data in a fully comprehensive way. In this paper we try to\naddress this point i.e., by using the most updated cosmological probes, we test\nthree different candidates for a VSL theory (Barrow \\& Magueijo, Avelino \\&\nMartins, and Moffat) signal. We consider many different ans\\\"{a}tze for both\nthe functional form of $c(z)$ (which cannot be fixed by theoretical\nmotivations) and for the dark energy dynamics, in order to have a clear global\npicture from which we extract the results. We compare these results using a\nreliable statistical tool such as the Bayesian Evidence. We find that the\npresent cosmological data is perfectly compatible with any of these VSL\nscenarios, but in one case (Moffat model) we have a higher Bayesian Evidence\nratio in favour of VSL than in the standard $c=$ constant $\\Lambda$CDM\nscenario. Moreover, in such a scenario, the VSL signal can help to strengthen\nconstraints on the spatial curvature (with indication toward an open universe),\nto clarify some properties of dark energy (exclusion of a cosmological constant\nat $2\\sigma$ level) and is also falsifiable in the nearest future due to some\npeculiar issues which differentiate this model from the standard model.\nFinally, we have applied some priors which come from cosmology and, in\nparticular, from information theory and gravitational thermodynamics.\n", "  Two-particle angular correlations were measured in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}\n= 7$ TeV for pions, kaons, protons, and lambdas, for all particle/anti-particle\ncombinations in the pair. Data for mesons exhibit an expected peak dominated by\neffects associated with mini-jets and are well reproduced by general purpose\nMonte Carlo generators. However, for baryon-baryon and anti-baryon--anti-baryon\npairs, where both particles have the same baryon number, a near-side\nanti-correlation structure is observed instead of a peak. This effect is\ninterpreted in the context of baryon production mechanisms in the fragmentation\nprocess. It currently presents a challenge to Monte Carlo models and its origin\nremains an open question.\n", "  The entanglement entropy (EE) of gauge theories in three spacetime dimensions\nis analyzed using manifestly gauge-invariant variables defined directly in the\ncontinuum. Specifically, we focus on the Maxwell, Maxwell-Chern-Simons (MCS),\nand nonabelian Yang-Mills theories. Special attention is paid to the analysis\nof edge modes and their contribution to EE. The contact term is derived without\ninvoking the replica method and its physical origin is traced to the phase\nspace volume measure for the edge modes. The topological contribution to the EE\nfor the MCS case is calculated. For all the abelian cases, the EE presented in\nthis paper agrees with known results in the literature. The EE for the\nnonabelian theory is computed in a gauge-invariant gaussian approximation,\nwhich incoprorates the dynamically generated mass gap. A formulation of the\ncontact term for the nonabelian case is also presented.\n", "  We know that demanding $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry of Lagrangian is\na \"sufficient\" condition to describe electroweak interactions, however, in this\npaper, we have tried to find whether it's a \"necessary\" condition or not. We\nhave used a different approach to describe electroweak interactions without\nusing any $SU(2)_L$ doublet or $SU(2)_L$ generator and incorporate some new\nphysics aspects into theory. In this method, we only need local gauge\ninvariance of Lagrangian under a \"generalised $U(1)_Q$ gauge transformation\",\nwhere $Q$ is electric charge (not to be confused with usual $U(1)$\ntransformation). Under this gauge transformation, all charged fields including\ncharged gauge bosons transform as $H_{(\\mu)}\\rightarrow\nH_{(\\mu)}e^{iq_h\\theta}$ and all neutral gauge bosons transforms as\n$V_\\mu\\rightarrow V_\\mu+\\Lambda \\partial_\\mu \\theta$. Nevertheless, $SU(2)_L$\nsymmetry can be restored by imposing constraints on some parameters and thus\nstandard model can be considered as a special case of this model. Hence, it\nturns out that $SU(2)_L\\times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry is a \"sufficient\" but \"not\nnecessary\" condition for electroweak interactions.\n", "  We investigate whether Effective Field Theory (EFT) approaches, which have\nbeen useful in examining inflation and dark energy, can also be used to\nestablish a systematic approach to inflationary reheating. We consider two\nmethods. First, we extend Weinberg's background EFT to the end of inflation and\nreheating. We establish when parametric resonance and decay of the inflaton\noccurs, but also find intrinsic theoretical limitations, which make it\ndifficult to capture some reheating models. This motivates us to next consider\nCheung, et. al.'s EFT approach, which instead focuses on perturbations and the\nsymmetry breaking induced by the cosmological background. Adapting the latter\napproach to reheating implies some new and important differences compared to\nthe EFT of Inflation. In particular, there are new hierarchical scales, and we\nmust account for inflaton oscillations during reheating, which lead to discrete\nsymmetry breaking. Guided by the fundamental symmetries, we construct the EFT\nof reheating, and as an example of its usefulness we establish a new class of\nreheating models and the corresponding predictions for gravity wave\nobservations. In this paper we primarily focus on the first stages of\npreheating. We conclude by discussing challenges for the approach and future\ndirections. This paper builds on ideas first proposed in the note\narXiv:1507.06651.\n", "  We propose a Monte Carlo algorithm designed to simulate quantum as well as\nclassical systems at equilibrium, bridging the algorithmic gap between quantum\nand classical thermal simulation algorithms. The method is based on a novel\ndecomposition of the quantum partition function that can be viewed as a series\nexpansion about its classical part. We argue that the algorithm is optimally\nsuited to tackle quantum many-body systems that exhibit a range of behaviors\nfrom `fully-quantum' to `fully-classical', in contrast to many existing\nmethods. We demonstrate the advantages of the technique by comparing it against\nexisting schemes. We also illustrate how our method allows for the unification\nof quantum and classical thermal parallel tempering techniques into a single\nalgorithm and discuss its practical significance.\n", "  (abridged) In this paper we revisit the problem of inferring the innermost\nstructure of the Milky Way's nuclear star cluster via star counts, to clarify\nwhether it displays a core or a cusp around the central black hole. Through\nimage stacking and improved PSF fitting we push the completeness limit about\none magnitude deeper than in previous, comparable work. Contrary to previous\nwork, we analyse the stellar density in well-defined magnitude ranges in order\nto be able to constrain stellar masses and ages. The RC and brighter giant\nstars display a core-like surface density profile within a projected radius\nR<0.3 pc of the central black hole, in agreement with previous studies, but\nshow a cusp-like surface density distribution at larger R. The surface density\nof the fainter stars can be described well by a single power-law at R<2 pc. The\ncusp-like profile of the faint stars persists even if we take into account the\npossible contamination of stars in this brightness range by young pre-main\nsequence stars. The data are inconsistent with a core-profile for the faint\nstars.Finally, we show that a 3D Nuker law provides a very good description of\nthe cluster structure. We conclude that the observed stellar density at the\nGalactic Centre, as it can be inferred with current instruments, is consistent\nwith the existence of a stellar cusp around the Milky Way's central black hole,\nSgr A*. This cusp is well developed inside the influence radius of about 3 pc\nof Sgr A* and can be described by a single three-dimensional power-law with an\nexponent gamma=1.23+-0.05. The apparent lack of RC stars and brighter giants at\nprojected distances of R < 0.3 pc (R<8\") of the massive black hole may indicate\nthat some mechanism has altered their distribution or intrinsic luminosity.\n", "  This is the second of three papers that search for the predicted stellar cusp\naround the Milky Way's central black hole, Sagittarius A*, with new data and\nmethods. We aim to infer the distribution of the faintest stellar population\ncurrently accessible through observations around Sagittarius A*. We use\nadaptive optics assisted high angular resolution images obtained with the NACO\ninstrument at the ESO VLT. Through optimised PSF fitting we remove the light\nfrom all detected stars above a given magnitude limit. Subsequently we analyse\nthe remaining, diffuse light density. The analysed diffuse light arises from\nsub-giant and main-sequence stars with KS ~ 19 - 20 with masses of 1 - 2 Msol .\nThese stars can be old enough to be dynamically relaxed. The observed power-law\nprofile and its slope are consistent with the existence of a relaxed stellar\ncusp around the Milky Way's central black hole. We find that a Nuker law\nprovides an adequate description of the nuclear cluster's intrinsic shape\n(assuming spherical symmetry). The 3D power-law slope near Sgr A* is \\gamma =\n1.23 +- 0.05. At a distance of 0.01 pc from the black hole, we estimate a\nstellar mass density of 2.3 +- 0.3 x 10^7 Msol pc^-3 and a total enclosed\nstellar mass of 180 +- 20 Msol. These estimates assume a constant mass-to-light\nratio and do not take stellar remnants into account. The fact that no cusp is\nobserved for bright (Ks 16) giant stars at projected distances of roughly\n0.1-0.3 pc implies that some mechanism has altered their appearance or\ndistribution.\n", "  We explore the effect of using different kinematic tracers (HI and H$\\alpha$)\non reconstructing the encounter parameters of the Mice major galaxy merger (NGC\n4676A/B). We observed the Mice using the SparsePak Integral Field Unit (IFU) on\nthe WIYN telescope, and compared the H$\\alpha$ velocity map with VLA HI\nobservations. The relatively high spectral resolution of our data (R $\\approx$\n5000) allows us to resolve more than one kinematic component in the emission\nlines of some fibers. We separate the H$\\alpha$-[N II] emission of the\nstar-forming regions from shocks using their [N II]/H$\\alpha$ line ratio and\nvelocity dispersion. We show that the velocity of star-forming regions agree\nwith that of the cold gas (HI), particularly, in the tidal tails of the system.\nWe reconstruct the morphology and kinematics of these tidal tails utilizing an\nautomated modeling method based on the Identikit software package. We quantify\nthe goodness of fit and the uncertainties of the derived encounter parameters.\nMost of the initial conditions reconstructed using H$\\alpha$ and HI are\nconsistent with each other, and qualitatively agree with the results of\nprevious works. For example, we find 210$\\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs, and\n180$\\pm^{50}_{40}$ Myrs for the time since pericenter, when modeling H$\\alpha$\nand HI kinematics, respectively. This confirms that in some cases, H$\\alpha$\nkinematics can be used instead of HI kinematics for reconstructing the initial\nconditions of galaxy mergers, and our automated modeling method is applicable\nto some merging systems.\n", "  We consider gauge invariant cosmological perturbations in UV-modified, z=3\nHorava gravity with one scalar matter field, which has been proposed as a\nrenormalizable gravity theory without the ghost problem in four dimensions. In\norder to exhibit its dynamical degrees of freedom, we consider the Hamiltonian\nreduction method and find that, by solving \"all\" the constraint equations, the\ndegrees of freedom are the same as those of Einstein gravity: One scalar and\ntwo tensor (graviton) modes when a scalar matter field presents. However, we\nconfirm that there is no extra graviton modes and general relativity is\nrecovered in IR, which achieves the consistency of the model. From the\nUV-modification terms which break the detailed balance condition in UV, we\nobtain scale-invariant power spectrums for \"non\"-inflationary backgrounds, like\nthe power-law expansions, without knowing the details of early expansion\nhistory of Universe. This could provide a new framework for the Big Bang\ncosmology. Moreover, we find that \"tensor and scalar fluctuations travel\ndifferently in UV, generally\". We present also some clarifying remarks about\nconfusing points in the literatures.\n", "  Hypergraph states are generalizations of graph states where controlled-$Z$\ngates on edges are replaced with generalized controlled-$Z$ gates on\nhyperedges. Hypergraph states have several advantages over graph states. For\nexample, certain hypergraph states, such as the Union Jack states, are\nuniversal resource states for measurement-based quantum computing with only\nPauli measurements, while graph state measurement-based quantum computing needs\nnon-Clifford basis measurements. Furthermore, it is impossible to classically\nefficiently sample measurement results on hypergraph states with a constant\n$L$1-norm error unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level.\nAlthough several protocols have been proposed to verify graph states with only\nsequential single-qubit Pauli measurements, there was no verification method\nfor hypergraph states. In this paper, we propose a method for verifying\nhypergraph states with only sequential single-qubit Pauli measurements. As\napplications, we consider verified blind quantum computing with hypergraph\nstates, and quantum supremacy demonstrations with hypergraph states.\n", "  The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from black hole (BH) mergers\nprovides an inroad toward probing the interior of astrophysical BHs. The\ngeneral-relativistic description of the BH interior is that of empty spacetime\nwith a (possibly) singular core. Recently, however, the hypothesis that the BH\ninterior does not exist has been gaining traction, as it provides a means for\nresolving the BH information-loss problem. Here, we propose a simple method for\nanswering the following question: Does the BH interior exist and, if so, does\nit contain some distribution of matter or is it mostly empty? Our proposal is\npremised on the idea that, similar to the case of relativistic, ultra-compact\nstars, any BH-like object whose interior has some matter distribution should\nsupport fluid modes in addition to the conventional spacetime modes. In\nparticular, the Coriolis-induced Rossby (r-) modes, whose spectrum is mostly\ninsensitive to the composition of the interior matter, should be a universal\nfeature of such BH-like objects. In fact, the frequency and damping time of\nthese modes are determined by only the object's mass and speed of rotation. The\nr-modes oscillate at a lower frequency, decay at a slower rate and produce\nweaker GWs than do modes of the spacetime class. Hence, they imprint a\nmodel-insensitive signature of a non-empty interior in the GW spectrum\nresulting from a BH merger. We find that future GW detectors, such as Advanced\nLIGO with its design sensitivity, have the potential of detecting such r-modes\nif the amount of GWs leaking out quantum mechanically from the interior of a\nBH-like object is sufficiently large.\n", "  The use of four Lagrange points of the Sun/Earth system for fundamental\nphysics experiments in space is presented. L1, L2, L4 and L5 rotating rigidly\ntogether with the Earth form a natural reference frame at the scale of the\ninner solar system. The idea which is discussed in the paper considers the\npossibility of locating four spacecraft in the four cited Lagrange points and\nexchanging electromagnetic pulses among them. Including stations on earth,\nvarious closed paths for the pulses are possible. Time of flight measurements\nwould be performed. The time of flight difference between right- and\nleft-handed circuits is proportional to the angular momentum of the Sun and the\ndetection of the effect would reach accuracies better than 1% depending on the\naccuracy of the clock. The four points could also be used as \"artificial\npulsars\" for a relativistic positioning system at the scale of the solar\nsystem. Additional interesting possibilities include detection of a galactic\ngravito-magnetic field and also, using a global configuration as a zero area\nSagnac contour, detection of gravitational waves. More opportunities are also\nmentioned.\n", "  We report local field strength enhancement of single-cycle terahertz (THz)\npulses in an ultrafast time-resolved x-ray diffraction experiment. We show that\npatterning the sample with gold microstructures increases the THz field without\nchanging the THz pulse shape or drastically affecting the quality of the x-ray\ndiffraction pattern. We find a five-fold increase in THz-induced x-ray\ndiffraction intensity change in the presence of microstructures on a SrTiO3\nthin-film sample.\n", "  The production cross sections of the prompt charmed mesons ${\\rm D^0}$, ${\\rm\nD^+}$, ${\\rm D^{*+}}$ and ${\\rm D_s^+}$ were measured at mid-rapidity in\nproton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV with the\nALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). D mesons were reconstructed\nfrom their decays ${\\rm D}^0 \\to {\\rm K}^-\\pi^+$, ${\\rm D}^+\\to {\\rm\nK}^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$, ${\\rm D}^{*+} \\to {\\rm D}^0 \\pi^+$, ${\\rm D_s^{+}\\to\n\\phi\\pi^+\\to K^-K^+\\pi^+}$, and their charge conjugates. With respect to\nprevious measurements in the same rapidity region, the coverage in transverse\nmomentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) is extended and the uncertainties are reduced by a\nfactor of about two. The accuracy on the estimated total $\\rm c\\overline c$\nproduction cross section is likewise improved. The measured $p_{\\rm\nT}$-differential cross sections are compared with the results of three\nperturbative QCD calculations.\n", "  We present predictions for the outcome of deep galaxy surveys with the\n$James$ $Webb$ $Space$ $Telescope$ ($JWST$) obtained from a physical model of\ngalaxy formation in $\\Lambda$CDM. We use the latest version of the GALFORM\nmodel, embedded within a new ($800$ Mpc)$^{3}$ dark matter only simulation with\na halo mass resolution of $M_{\\rm halo}>2\\times10^{9}$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nFor computing full UV-to-mm galaxy spectral energy distributions, including the\nabsorption and emission of radiation by dust, we use the spectrophotometric\nradiative transfer code GRASIL. The model is calibrated to reproduce a broad\nrange of observational data at $z\\lesssim6$, and we show here that it can also\npredict evolution of the rest-frame far-UV luminosity function for $7\\lesssim\nz\\lesssim10$ which is in good agreement with observations. We make predictions\nfor the evolution of the luminosity function from $z=16$ to $z=0$ in all\nbroadband filters on the Near InfraRed Camera (NIRCam) and Mid InfraRed\nInstrument (MIRI) on $JWST$ and present the resulting galaxy number counts and\nredshift distributions. Our fiducial model predicts that $\\sim1$ galaxy per\nfield of view will be observable at $z\\sim11$ for a $10^4$ s exposure with\nNIRCam. A variant model, which produces a higher redshift of reionization in\nbetter agreement with $Planck$ data, predicts number densities of observable\ngalaxies $\\sim5\\times$ greater at this redshift. Similar observations with MIRI\nare predicted not to detect any galaxies at $z\\gtrsim6$. We also make\npredictions for the effect of different exposure times on the redshift\ndistributions of galaxies observable with $JWST$, and for the angular sizes of\ngalaxies in $JWST$ bands.\n", "  We report the discovery of the quadruply lensed quasar J1433+6007, mined in\nthe SDSS DR12 photometric catalogues using a novel outlier-selection technique,\nwithout prior spectroscopic or UV excess information. Discovery data obtained\nat the Nordic Optical telescope (NOT, La Palma) show nearly identical quasar\nspectra at $z_s=2.74$ and four quasar images in a fold configuration, one of\nwhich sits on a blue arc. The deflector redshift is $z_{l}=0.407,$ from\nKeck-ESI spectra. We describe the selection procedure, discovery and follow-up,\nimage positions and $BVRi$ magnitudes, and first results and forecasts from\nsimple lens models.\n", "  The X-ray light curves of the early afterglow phase from gamma-ray bursts\npresent a puzzling variability, including flares. The origin of these flares is\nstill debated, and often associated with a late activity of the central engine.\nWe discuss an alternative scenario where the central engine remains short-lived\nand flares are produced by the propagation of a long-lived reverse shock in a\nstratified ejecta. Here we focus on the hydrodynamics of the shock\ninteractions. We perform one-dimensional ultrarelativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations with different initial internal structure in the gamma-ray burst\nejecta. We use them to extract bolometric light curves and compare with a\nprevious study based on a simplified ballistic model. We find a good agreement\nbetween both approaches, with similar slopes and variability in the light\ncurves, but identify several weaknesses in the ballistic model: the density is\nunderestimated in the shocked regions, and more importantly, late shock\nreflections are not captured. With accurate dynamics provided by our\nhydrodynamic simulations, we confirm that internal shocks in the ejecta lead to\nthe formation of dense shells. The interaction of the long-lived reverse shock\nwith a dense shell then produces a fast and intense increase of the dissipated\npower. Assuming that the emission is due to the synchrotron radiation from\nshock-accelerated electrons, and that the external forward shock is radiatively\ninefficient, we find that this results in a bright flare in the X-ray\nlightcurve, with arrival times, shapes, and duration in agreement with the\nobserved properties of X-ray flares in GRB afterglows.\n", "  We Consider a cosmological model based on a generalization of the equation of\nstate proposed by Nojiri and Odintsov [46] and \\v{S}tefan\\v{c}i'c [47], [48].\nWe argue that this model works as a dark fluid model which can interpolate\nbetween dust equation of state and the dark energy equation of state. We show\nhow the asymptotic behavior of the equation of state constrained the parameters\nof the model. The causality condition for the model is also studied to\nconstrain the parameters and the fixed points are tested to determine different\nsolution classes. Observations of Hubble diagram of SNe Ia supernovae are used\nto further constrain the model. We present an exact solution of the model and\ncalculate the luminosity distance and the energy density evolution. We also\ncalculate the deceleration parameter to test the state of the universe\nexpansion.\n", "  Ten weeks of daily imaging of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) has yielded 41 nova light curves of unprecedented quality\nfor extragalactic cataclysmic variables. We have recently used these light\ncurves to demonstrate that the observational scatter in the so-called\nMaximum-Magnitude Rate of Decline (MMRD) relation for classical novae is so\nlarge as to render the nova-MMRD useless as a standard candle. Here we\ndemonstrate that a modified Buscombe - de Vaucouleurs hypothesis, namely that\nnovae with decline times t2 > 10 days converge to nearly the same absolute\nmagnitude about two weeks after maximum light in a giant elliptical galaxy, is\nsupported by our M87 nova data. For 13 novae with daily-sampled light curves,\nwell determined times of maximum light in both the F606W and F814W filters, and\ndecline times $t2 > 10 days we find that M87 novae display M(606W,15) = -6.37\n+/- 0.46 and M(814W,15) = -6.11 +/- 0.43. If very fast novae with decline times\nt2 < 10 days are excluded, the distances to novae in elliptical galaxies with\nstellar binary populations similar to those of M87 should be determinable with\n1 sigma accuracies of +/-20% with the above calibrations.\n", "  The orientation of small anisotropic particles settling in a turbulent fluid\ndetermines some essential properties of the suspension. We show that the\norientation distribution of small heavy spheroids settling through turbulence\ncan be accurately predicted by a simple Gaussian statistical model that takes\ninto account particle inertia and provides a quantitative understanding of the\norientation distribution on the problem parameters when fluid inertia is\nnegligible. Our results open the way to a parameterisation of the distribution\nof ice-crystals in clouds, and potentially leads to an improved understanding\nof radiation reflection, or particle aggregation through collisions in clouds.\n", "  The direct detection of gravitational wave by Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory indicates the coming of the era of\ngravitational-wave astronomy and gravitational-wave cosmology. It is expected\nthat more and more gravitational-wave events will be detected by currently\nexisting and planned gravitational-wave detectors. The gravitational waves open\na new window to explore the Universe and various mysteries will be disclosed\nthrough the gravitational-wave detection, combined with other cosmological\nprobes. The gravitational-wave physics is not only related to gravitation\ntheory, but also is closely tied to fundamental physics, cosmology and\nastrophysics. In this review article, three kinds of sources of gravitational\nwaves and relevant physics will be discussed, namely gravitational waves\nproduced during the inflation and preheating phases of the Universe, the\ngravitational waves produced during the first-order phase transition as the\nUniverse cools down and the gravitational waves from the three phases:\ninspiral, merger and ringdown of a compact binary system, respectively. We will\nalso discuss the gravitational waves as a standard siren to explore the\nevolution of the Universe.\n", "  Numerical evidence is presented that the Poisson-Israel mass inflation\ninstability at the inner horizon of an accreting, rotating black hole is\ngenerically followed by Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz oscillatory collapse to\na spacelike singularity. The computation involves following all 6 degrees of\nfreedom of the gravitational field. To simplify the problem, the computation\ntakes as initial conditions the conformally separable solutions of\narXiv:1010.1269, arXiv:1010.1271 just above the inner horizon of a slowly\naccreting, rotating black hole, and integrates the equations inward along\nsingle latitudes.\n", "  We present estimates of transverse single spin asymmetry (TSSA) in\n$p+p^\\uparrow \\rightarrow J/\\psi+X$ within the colour evaporation model of\ncharmonium production in a generalized parton model (GPM) framework, using the\nrecently obtained best fit parameters for the gluon Sivers function (GSF)\nextracted from PHENIX data on TSSA in $p+p^\\uparrow \\to \\pi^0+X$ at\nmidrapidity. We calculate asymmetry at $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV, and compare the\nresults with PHENIX data on TSSA in the process $p + p^\\uparrow \\to J/\\psi+X$.\nWe also present estimates for asymmetry at $\\sqrt{s} = 115 $ GeV corresponding\nto the proposed fixed target experiment AFTER@LHC and at $\\sqrt{s} = 500$ GeV\ncorresponding to the higher RHIC energy. Finally, we investigate the effect of\nthe transverse momentum dependent (TMD) evolution of the densities involved, on\nthe asymmetry.\n", "  The deconfined quantum critical point (QCP), separating the N\\'eel and\nvalence bond solid phases in a 2D antiferromagnet, was proposed as an example\nof $2+1$D criticality fundamentally different from standard\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson-Fisher {criticality}. In this work we present multiple\nequivalent descriptions of deconfined QCPs, and use these to address the\npossibility of enlarged emergent symmetries in the low energy limit. The\neasy-plane deconfined QCP, besides its previously discussed self-duality, is\ndual to $N_f = 2$ fermionic quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has its own\nself-duality and hence may have an O(4)$\\times Z_2^T$ symmetry. We propose\nseveral dualities for the deconfined QCP with ${\\mathrm{SU}(2)}$ spin symmetry\nwhich together make natural the emergence of a previously suggested $SO(5)$\nsymmetry rotating the N\\'eel and VBS orders. These emergent symmetries are\nimplemented anomalously. The associated infra-red theories can also be viewed\nas surface descriptions of 3+1D topological paramagnets, giving further insight\ninto the dualities. We describe a number of numerical tests of these dualities.\nWe also discuss the possibility of \"pseudocritical\" behavior for deconfined\ncritical points, and the meaning of the dualities and emergent symmetries in\nsuch a scenario.\n", "  Interaction-free measurement (IFM), just as its name implies, can enable one\nto detect an object without interacting with it, i.e., substantially reducing\nthe damage to the object. With the help of quantum channel theory, we\ninvestigate the general model of \"quantum-Zeno-like\" IFM, whose optics setup is\na Mach-Zehnder like interferometer utilizing the quantum Zeno effect, where the\nobject to be detected is semitransparent and the interrogation cycle number $N$\nis finite. And we define two important probabilities $P_{\\rm loss}$ and $P_{\\rm\nerror}$ to evaluate the IFM process, which describe the photon loss rate and\nthe error of discriminating the presenece/absence of the object respectively.\nThe minimum values of these two probabilities and the corresponding initial\ninput states to reach them are attained via this model. And we find that when\nthe interrogation cycle $N$ approaches infinity, the object can be perfectly\ndetected, where the minimum values of these two probabilities are both zero and\nthe initial input state to reach them becomes the same state $|1\\rangle$ in our\nsystem. In addition, we also study whether quantum correlation can benefit IFM\nor not, but the answer is no, in the sense that the entangled photon input\nstate cannot minimize $P_{\\rm loss}$, $P_{\\rm error}$ more than single photon\ninput state. Our work provides principal theoretic support for the practical\nrealization of IFM and the employed analysis technique can be applied to other\nquantum facilitating scenarios.\n", "  Why is it difficult to refold a previously folded sheet of paper? We show\nthat even crease patterns with only one designed folding motion inevitably\ncontain an exponential number of `distractor' folding branches accessible from\na bifurcation at the flat state. Consequently, refolding a sheet requires\nfinding the ground state in a glassy energy landscape with an exponential\nnumber of other attractors of higher energy, much like in models of protein\nfolding (Levinthal's paradox) and other NP-hard satisfiability (SAT) problems.\nAs in these problems, we find that refolding a sheet requires actuation at\nmultiple carefully chosen creases. We show that seeding successful folding in\nthis way can be understood in terms of sub-patterns that fold when cut out\n(`folding islands'). Besides providing guidelines for the placement of active\nhinges in origami applications, our results point to fundamental limits on the\nprogrammability of energy landscapes in sheets.\n", "  Astrobiology is usually defined as the study of the origin, evolution,\ndistribution, and future of life in the universe. As such it is inherently\ninterdisciplinary and cannot help but engender a worldview infused by cosmic\nand evolutionary perspectives. Both these attributes of the study of\nastrobiology are, and will increasingly prove to be, beneficial to society\nregardless of whether extraterrestrial life is discovered or not.\n", "  Axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons can quantum mechanically interconvert\nwhen propagating through magnetic fields, and ALP-photon conversion may induce\noscillatory features in the spectra of astrophysical sources. We use deep (370\nks), short frame time Chandra observations of the bright nucleus at the centre\nof the radio galaxy M87 in the Virgo cluster to search for signatures of light\nALPs. The absence of substantial irregularities in the X-ray power-law spectrum\nleads to a new upper limit on the photon-ALP coupling, $g_{a\\gamma}$: using a\nconservative model of the cluster magnetic field consistent with Faraday\nrotation measurements from M87 and M84, we find $g_{a \\gamma} <\n2.6\\times10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence level for ALP masses $m_a \\leq\n10^{-13}$ eV. Other consistent magnetic field models lead to stronger limits of\n$g_{a \\gamma} \\lesssim 1.1$--$1.5 \\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$. These bounds are\nall stronger than the limit inferred from the absence of a gamma-ray burst from\nSN1987A, and rule out a substantial fraction of the parameter space accessible\nto future experiments such as ALPS-II and IAXO.\n", "  Context. The observation of >100 MeV {\\gamma}-rays in the minutes to hours\nfollowing solar flares suggests that high-energy particles interacting in the\nsolar atmosphere can be stored and/or accelerated for long time periods. The\noccasions when {\\gamma}-rays are detected even when the solar eruptions\noccurred beyond the solar limb as viewed from Earth provide favorable viewing\nconditions for studying the role of coronal shocks driven by coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) in the acceleration of these particles.\n  Aims: In this paper, we investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of the\ncoronal shocks inferred from stereoscopic observations of behind-the-limb\nflares to determine if they could be the source of the particles producing the\n{\\gamma}-rays.\n  Methods: We analyzed the CMEs and early formation of coronal shocks\nassociated with {\\gamma}-ray events measured by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) from three eruptions behind the solar limb as viewed from Earth on 2013\nOct. 11, 2014 Jan. 06 and Sep. 01. We used a 3D triangulation technique, based\non remote-sensing observations to model the expansion of the CME shocks from\nabove the solar surface to the upper corona. Coupling the expansion model to\nvarious models of the coronal magnetic field allowed us to derive the\ntime-dependent distribution of shock Mach numbers and the magnetic connection\nof particles produced by the shock to the solar surface visible from Earth.\n  Results: The reconstructed shock fronts for the three events became\nmagnetically connected to the visible solar surface after the start of the\nflare and just before the onset of the >100 MeV {\\gamma}-ray emission. The\nshock surface at these connections also exhibited supercritical Mach numbers\nrequired for significant particle energization.\n  [...] (Abridged)\n", "  We show that the theoretical predictions on high energy behavior of the\nphotoionization cross section of fullerenes depends crucially on the form of\nthe function $V(r)$ which approximates the fullerene field. The shape of the\nhigh energy cross section is obtained without solving of the wave equation. The\ncross section energy dependence is determined by the analytical properties of\nthe function $V(r)$.\n", "  We propose using the frequency-domain bootstrap (FDB) to estimate errors of\nmodeling parameters when the modeling error is itself a major source of\nuncertainty. Unlike the usual bootstrap or the simple $\\chi^2$ analysis, the\nFDB can take into account correlations between errors. It is also very fast\ncompared to the the Gaussian process Bayesian estimate as often implemented for\ncomputer model calibration. The method is illustrated drop model of nuclear\nbinding energies. We find that the FDB gives a more conservative estimate of\nthe uncertainty in liquid drop parameters in better accord with more empirical\nestimates. For the nuclear physics application, there no apparent obstacle to\napply the method to the more accurate and detailed models based on\ndensity-functional theory.\n", "  Robo-AO is an autonomous laser guide star adaptive optics system recently\ncommissioned at the Kitt Peak 2.1-m telescope. Now operating every clear night,\nRobo-AO at the 2.1-m telescope is the first dedicated adaptive optics\nobservatory. This paper presents the imaging performance of the adaptive optics\nsystem in its first eighteen months of operations. For a median seeing value of\n$1.31^{\\prime\\prime}$, the average Strehl ratio is 4\\% in the $i^\\prime$ band\nand 29\\% in the J band. After post-processing, the contrast ratio under\nsub-arcsecond seeing for a $2\\leq i^{\\prime} \\leq 16$ primary star is five and\nseven magnitudes at radial offsets of $0.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ and\n$1.0^{\\prime\\prime}$, respectively. The data processing and archiving pipelines\nrun automatically at the end of each night. The first stage of the processing\npipeline shifts and adds the data using techniques alternately optimized for\nstars with high and low SNRs. The second \"high contrast\" stage of the pipeline\nis eponymously well suited to finding faint stellar companions.\n", "  Spin transfer - the transfer of angular momentum from spin-polarized\nelectrical current to magnetic materials - has been extensively researched as\nan efficient mechanism for the electronic manipulation of the static and\ndynamic states in nanomagnetic systems, advancing our understanding of\nnanomagnetism and electronic transport, and enabling the development of\nenergy-efficient magnetic nanodevices. Our present understanding of spin\ntransfer is based on the classical approximation for the magnetization, even\nthough the spin-polarized electrons mediating spin transfer are treated\nquantum-mechanically. Here, we utilize a nanoscale magnetic spin-valve\nstructure to demonstrate that quantum zero-point fluctuations of magnetization,\nneglected in the existing theories of spin transfer, provide the dominant\ncontribution to this effect at cryogenic temperatures, and remain\nnon-negligible even at room temperature. The demonstrated quantum spin transfer\n(QST) is distinguished by a non-smooth piecewise-linear dependence of the\nfluctuation intensity on current, and can be driven not only by the directional\nflows of electrons, but also by their thermal motion. This effect can enhance\ncurrent-induced phenomena, overcoming the efficiency limitations that are\npresently perceived as fundamental to the spin transfer mechanism.\n", "  NMDC-Palatini cosmology in slow-roll regime is of our interests. We present\nflat FLRW cosmological NMDC-Palatini field equations and acceleration\ncondition. Late time trajectory is approximated. Chaotic inflation potential is\nconsidered here as it is viable in a range of positive coupling constant as\nconstrained by CMB results. Phase portraits show that the NMDC-Palatini gives\nnew saddle-point solutions. In $V \\propto \\phi^2$ potential, the NMDC-Palatini\neffect enlarges the acceleration-allowed region from that of GR case.\n", "  A previous work found that a nonminimally coupled theory of gravity can,\nunder appropriate conditions, give rise to an additional contribution to the\nfield equations interpreted as dark matter [1]: in particular, the density of\nthis dark matter component was found to scale as a power of the density of\nvisible matter. However, no explicit solution for the modified field equations\nwas provided, so that a direct computation of the specific density profile\nfollowed by visible matter is missing.\n  This question is now addressed: analytical solutions to the modified field\nequations are derived in the appropriate perturbative regime and characterised,\nwith an emphasis on directly obtaining the visible matter profile in a\nself-consistent way. We compare with known profiles for visible and dark matter\nand obtain constraints on the parameters of the model.\n", "  We present accurate mass and thermodynamic profiles for a sample of 56 galaxy\nclusters observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We investigate the\neffects of local gravitational acceleration in central cluster galaxies, and we\nexplore the role of the local free-fall time (t$_{\\rm ff}$) in thermally\nunstable cooling. We find that the local cooling time (t$_{\\rm cool}$) is as\neffective an indicator of cold gas, traced through its nebular emission, as the\nratio of t$_{\\rm cool}$/t$_{\\rm ff}$. Therefore, t$_{\\rm cool}$ alone\napparently governs the onset of thermally unstable cooling in hot atmospheres.\nThe location of the minimum t$_{\\rm cool}$/t$_{\\rm ff}$, a thermodynamic\nparameter that simulations suggest may be key in driving thermal instability,\nis unresolved in most systems. As a consequence, selection effects bias the\nvalue and reduce the observed range in measured t$_{\\rm cool}$/t$_{\\rm ff}$\nminima. The entropy profiles of cool-core clusters are characterized by broken\npower-laws down to our resolution limit, with no indication of isentropic\ncores. We show, for the first time, that mass isothermality and the $K \\propto\nr^{2/3}$ entropy profile slope imply a floor in t$_{\\rm cool}$/t$_{\\rm ff}$\nprofiles within central galaxies. No significant departures of t$_{\\rm\ncool}$/t$_{\\rm ff}$ below 10 are found, which is inconsistent with many recent\nfeedback models. The inner densities and cooling times of cluster atmospheres\nare resilient to change in response to powerful AGN activity, suggesting that\nthe energy coupling between AGN heating and atmospheric gas is gentler than\nmost models predict.\n", "  We calculate a dipole-dipole potential between fermions mediated by a light\npseudoscalar, axion, paying a particular attention to the overall sign. While\nthe sign of the potential is physical and important for experiments to discover\nor constrain the axion coupling to fermions, there is often a sign error in the\nliterature. The purpose of this short note is to clarify the sign issue of the\naxion-mediated dipole-dipole potential. As a by-product, we find a sign change\nof the dipole-dipole potenital due to the different spin of the mediating\nparticle.\n", "  Two-electron charged self-assembled quantum dot molecules exhibit a\ndecoherence-avoiding singlet-triplet qubit subspace and an efficient\nspin-photon interface. We demonstrate quantum entanglement between emitted\nphotons and the spin-qubit after the emission event. We measure the overlap\nwith a fully entangled state to be $69.5\\pm2.7\\,\\%$, exceeding the threshold of\n$50\\,\\%$ required to prove the non-separability of the density matrix of the\nsystem. The photonic qubit is encoded in two photon states with an energy\ndifference larger than the timing resolution of existing detectors. We devise a\nnovel heterodyne detection method, enabling projective measurements of such\nphotonic color qubits along any direction on the Bloch sphere.\n", "  OSIRIS-REx will return pristine samples of carbonaceous asteroid Bennu. This\narticle describes how pristine was defined based on expectations of Bennu and\non a realistic understanding of what is achievable with a constrained schedule\nand budget, and how that definition flowed to requirements and implementation.\nTo return a pristine sample, the OSIRIS- REx spacecraft sampling hardware was\nmaintained at level 100 A/2 and <180 ng/cm2 of amino acids and hydrazine on the\nsampler head through precision cleaning, control of materials, and vigilance.\nContamination is further characterized via witness material exposed to the\nspacecraft assembly and testing environment as well as in space. This\ncharacterization provided knowledge of the expected background and will be used\nin conjunction with archived spacecraft components for comparison with the\nsamples when they are delivered to Earth for analysis. Most of all, the\ncleanliness of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft was achieved through communication\namong scientists, engineers, managers, and technicians.\n", "  We parametrize the Stillinger-Weber potential for 156 two-dimensional atomic\ncrystals. Parameters for the Stillinger-Weber potential are obtained from the\nvalence force field model following the analytic approach (Nanotechnology 26,\n315706 (2015)), in which the valence force constants are determined by the\nphonon spectrum. The Stillinger-Weber potential is an efficient nonlinear\ninteraction, and is applicable for numerical simulations of nonlinear physical\nor mechanical processes. The supplemental resources for all simulations in the\npresent work are available online in Ref. 1, including a fortran code to\ngenerate crystals' structures, files for molecular dynamics simulations using\nLAMMPS, files for phonon calculations with the Stillinger-Weber potential using\nGULP, and files for phonon calculations with the valence force field model\nusing GULP.\n", "  We consider a multi-string configuration that provides a new way to compute\nthe expectation value of the Polyakov loop in a five-dimensional framework\nknown as AdS/QCD. The obtained results are in reasonably good agreement with\nthose obtained by lattice simulations for pure SU(3) gauge theory and also by\nthe usual single string configuration.\n", "  The extraordinary properties and the novel applications of black phosphorene\ninduce the research interest on the monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides. Here\nusing the first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the\nelectronic, transport and optical properties of monolayer $\\alpha-$ and\n$\\beta-$GeSe, the latter of which was recently experimentally realized. We\nfound that, monolayer $\\alpha-$GeSe is a semiconductor with direct band gap of\n1.6 eV, and $\\beta-$GeSe displays indirect semiconductor with the gap of 2.47\neV, respectively. For monolayer $\\beta-$GeSe, the electronic/hole transport is\nanisotropic with an extremely high electron mobility of 7.84\n$\\times10^4$$cm^2/V\\cdot {s}$ along the zigzag direction, comparable to that of\nblack phosphorene. Furthermore, for $\\beta-$GeSe, robust band gaps nearly\ndisregarding the applied tensile strain along the zigzag direction is observed.\nBoth monolayer $\\alpha-$ and $\\beta-$GeSe exhibit anisotropic optical\nabsorption in the visible spectrum.\n", "  Vector boson dark matter (DM) appears in $SU(2)_N$ extension ($N$ stands for\nneutral) of Standard Model (SM) where an additional global $U(1)_P$ symmetry is\nassumed and results in a generalized lepton number defined as: $L=P+T_{3N}$.\nBreaking of $U(1)_P$ leads to the breaking of $L$ to $(-1)^L$, thus stabilizing\nDM through modified $R=(-1)^{3B+L+2J}$. This model, already discussed in\nliterature, offers several novel features to elaborate upon. For example,\n$t$-channel annihilation and dominant $s$-channel direct search, along with\nco-annihilation, helps the DM to evade stringent direct search bounds from LUX\nand XENON1T after satisfying relic density constraints. On the other hand, the\nexotic particles of the model can be produced at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) yielding multilepton final states. Hadronically quiet four lepton signal\nwith large missing energy, in specific, is shown to provide a smoking gun\nsignature of such a framework. We study the details of $E(6) \\to SM \\otimes\nSU(2)_N$ breaking patterns (through D-parity odd/even cases) which yield\nimportant phenomenological consequences.\n", "  We construct two simple error correction schemes adapted to amplitude damping\nnoise for Bacon-Shor codes and investigate their prospects for fault-tolerant\nimplementation. Both consist solely of Clifford gates and require far fewer\nqubits, relative to the standard method, to achieve correction to a desired\norder in the damping rate. The first, employing one-bit teleportation and\nsingle-qubit measurements, needs only one fourth as many physical qubits, while\nthe second, using just stabilizer measurements and Pauli corrections, needs\nonly half. We show that existing fault-tolerance methods can be employed for\nthe latter, while the former can be made to avoid potential catastrophic errors\nand can easily cope with damping faults in ancilla qubits.\n", "  We address the deficiency of odd-Z elements P, Cl, K and Sc in galactic\nchemical evolution models through an investigation of the nucleosynthesis of\ninteracting convective O- and C shells in massive stars. 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations of O-shell convection with moderate C-ingestion rates show no\ndramatic deviation from spherical symmetry. We derive a spherically averaged\ndiffusion coefficient for 1D nucleosynthesis simulations which show that such\nconvective-reactive ingestion events can be a production site for P, Cl, K and\nSc. An entrainment rate of $10^{-3}{{\\rm M}_\\odot}$/s features overproduction\nfactors $OP_\\mathrm{s} \\approx 7$. Full O-C shell mergers in our 1D stellar\nevolution massive star models have overproduction factors $OP_\\mathrm{m}>1\n\\mathrm{dex}$ but for such cases 3D hydrodynamic simulations suggest deviations\nfrom spherical symmetry. p-process species can be produced with overproduction\nfactors of $OP_\\mathrm{m}>1 \\mathrm{dex}$, e.g. for $^{130,132}Ba$. Using the\nuncertain prediction of the $15{{\\rm M}_\\odot}$, $Z=0.02$ massive star model\n($OP_\\mathrm{m} \\approx 15$) as representative for merger or entrainment\nconvective-reactive events involving O- and C-burning shells, and assume that\nsuch events occur in more than 50% of all stars, our chemical evolution models\nreproduce the observed Galactic trends of the odd-Z elements.\n", "  We demonstrated that the spin injection/extraction efficiency is enhanced by\nan ultrathin Mg insertion layer (<= 2 nm) in Fe/Mg/MgO/n+-Si tunnel junctions.\nIn diode-type vertical three-terminal devices fabricated on a Si substrate, we\nobserved the narrower three-terminal Hanle (N-3TH) signals indicating true spin\ninjection into Si, and estimated the spin polarization in Si to be 16% when the\nthickness of the Mg insertion layer is 1 nm, whereas no N-3TH signal was\nobserved without Mg insertion. This means that the spin injection/extraction\nefficiency is enhanced by suppressing the formation of a magnetically-dead\nlayer at the Fe/MgO interface. We have also observed clear spin transport\nsignals, such as non-local Hanle signals and spin-valve signals, in a lateral\nfour-terminal device with the same Fe/Mg/MgO/n+-Si tunnel junctions fabricated\non a Si-on-insulator substrate. It was found that both the intensity and\nlinewidth of the spin signals are affected by the geometrical effects (device\ngeometry and size). We have derived analytical functions taking into account\nthe device structures, including channel thickness and electrode size, and\nestimated important parameters; spin lifetime and spin polarizations. Our\nanalytical functions well explain the experimental results. Our study shows the\nimportance of suppressing a magnetically-dead layer, and provides a unified\nunderstanding of spin injection/detection signals in different device\ngeometries.\n", "  We investigate the elliptic integrable model introduced by Deguchi and\nMartin, which is an elliptic extension of the Perk-Schultz model. We introduce\nand study a class of partition functions of the elliptic model by using the\nIzergin-Korepin analysis. We show that the partition functions are expressed as\na product of elliptic factors and elliptic Schur-type symmetric functions. This\nresult resembles the recent works by number theorists in which the\ncorrespondence between the partition functions of trigonometric models and the\nproduct of the deformed Vandermonde determinant and Schur functions were\nestablished.\n", "  One of the primary open questions of astrobiology is whether there is extant\nor extinct life elsewhere the Solar System. Implicit in much of this work is\nthat we are looking for microbial or, at best, unintelligent life, even though\ntechnological artifacts might be much easier to find. SETI work on searches for\nalien artifacts in the Solar System typically presumes that such artifacts\nwould be of extrasolar origin, even though life is known to have existed in the\nSolar System, on Earth, for eons. But if a prior technological, perhaps\nspacefaring, species ever arose in the Solar System, it might have produced\nartifacts or other technosignatures that have survived to present day, meaning\nSolar System artifact SETI provides a potential path to resolving\nastrobiology's question. Here, I discuss the origins and possible locations for\ntechnosignatures of such a $prior$ $indigenous$ $technological$ $species$,\nwhich might have arisen on ancient Earth or another body, such as a\npre-greenhouse Venus or a wet Mars. In the case of Venus, the arrival of its\nglobal greenhouse and potential resurfacing might have erased all evidence of\nits existence on the Venusian surface. In the case of Earth, erosion and,\nultimately, plate tectonics may have erased most such evidence if the species\nlived Gyr ago. Remaining indigenous technosignatures might be expected to be\nextremely old, limiting the places they might still be found to beneath the\nsurfaces of Mars and the Moon, or in the outer Solar System.\n", "  We report the results of the numerical study of the non-dissipative quantum\nJosephson junction chain with the focus on the statistics of many-body wave\nfunctions and local energy spectra. The disorder in this chain is due to the\nrandom offset charges. This chain is one of the simplest physical systems to\nstudy many-body localization. We show that the system may exhibit three\ndistinct regimes: insulating, characterized by the full localization of\nmany-body wavefunctions, fully delocalized (metallic) one characterized by the\nwavefunctions that take all the available phase volume and the intermediate\nregime in which the volume taken by the wavefunction scales as a non-trivial\npower of the full Hilbert space volume. In the intermediate, non-ergodic regime\nthe Thouless conductance (generalized to many-body problem) does not change as\na function of the chain length indicating a failure of the conventional\nsingle-parameter scaling theory of localization transition. The local spectra\nin this regime display the fractal structure in the energy space which is\nrelated with the fractal structure of wave functions in the Hilbert space. A\nsimple theory of fractality of local spectra is proposed and a new scaling\nrelationship between fractal dimensions in the Hilbert and energy space is\nsuggested and numerically tested.\n", "  We reinvestigate a claimed sample of 22 X-ray detected active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) at redshifts z > 4, which has reignited the debate as to whether young\ngalaxies or AGN reionized the Universe. These sources lie within the\nGOODS-S/CANDELS field, and we examine both the robustness of the claimed X-ray\ndetections (within the Chandra 4Ms imaging) and perform an independent analysis\nof the photometric redshifts of the optical/infrared counterparts. We confirm\nthe reality of only 15 of the 22 reported X-ray detections, and moreover find\nthat only 12 of the 22 optical/infrared counterpart galaxies actually lie\nrobustly at z > 4. Combining these results we find convincing evidence for only\n7 X-ray AGN at z > 4 in the GOODS-S field, of which only one lies at z > 5. We\nrecalculate the evolving far-UV (1500 Angstrom) luminosity density produced by\nAGN at high redshift, and find that it declines rapidly from z = 4 to z = 6, in\nagreement with several other recent studies of the evolving AGN luminosity\nfunction. The associated rapid decline in inferred hydrogen-ionizing emissivity\ncontributed by AGN falls an order-of-magnitude short of the level required to\nmaintain hydrogen ionization at z ~ 6. We conclude that all available evidence\ncontinues to favour a scenario in which young galaxies reionized the Universe,\nwith AGN making, at most, a very minor contribution to cosmic hydrogen\nreionization.\n", "  The classical ground state magnetic response of the Heisenberg model when\nrotationally invariant exchange interactions of integer order q>1 are added is\nfound to be discontinuous, even though the interactions lack magnetic\nanisotropy. This holds even in the case of bipartite lattices which are not\nfrustrated, as well as for the frustrated triangular lattice. The total number\nof discontinuities is associated with even-odd effects as it depends on the\nparity of q via the relative strength of the bilinear and higher order exchange\ninteractions, and increases with q. These results demonstrate that the precise\nform of the microscopic interactions is important for the ground state\nmagnetization response.\n", "  We address the superconducting singlet state of anisotropic Dirac fermions\nthat disperse linearly in one direction and parabolically in the other. For\nsystems that have uniaxial anisotropy, we show that the electromagnetic\nresponse to an external magnetic flux is extremely anisotropic near the quantum\ncritical point of the superconducting order. In the quantum critical regime and\nabove a critical magnetic field, we show that the superconductor may form a\nnovel exotic smectic state, with a stripe pattern of flux domains.\n", "  We demonstrate evidences of electronic transport via topological Dirac\nsurface states in a thin film of strained HgTe. At high perpendicular magnetic\nfields, we show that the electron transport reaches the quantum Hall regime\nwith vanishing resistance. Furthermore, quantum Hall transport spectroscopy\nreveals energy splittings of relativistic Landau levels specific to coupled\nDirac surface states. This study provides new insights in the quantum Hall\neffect of topological insulator (TI) slabs, in the cross-over regime between\ntwo- and three-dimensional TIs, and in the relevance of thin TI films to\nexplore novel circuit functionalities in spintronics and quantum\nnanoelectronics.\n", "  We construct the one-loop and two-loop scotogenic models for Dirac neutrino\nmass generation in the context of $U(1)_{B-L}$ extensions of standard model. It\nis indicated that the total number of intermediate fermion singlets is uniquely\nfixed by anomaly free condition and the new particles may have exotic $B-L$\ncharges so that the direct SM Yukawa mass term\n$\\bar{\\nu}_L\\nu_R\\overline{\\phi^0}$ and the Majorana mass term\n$(m_N/2)\\overline{\\nu_R^C}\\nu_R$ are naturally forbidden. After the spontaneous\nbreaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, the discrete $Z_{2}$ or $Z_{3}$ symmetry\nappears as the residual symmetry and give rise to the stability of\nintermediated fields as DM candidate. Phenomenological aspects of lepton flavor\nviolation, DM, leptogenesis and LHC signatures are discussed.\n", "  We calculate the probabilities of various charmed meson molecules for\n$X(4260)$ under the framework of ${}^3P_0$ model. The results indicate that\neven though heavy quark spin symmetry forbids $S$ wave coupling of $D_1\\bar{D}$\nto the ${}^3S_1$ charmonia ($\\psi(nS)$), the $D$ wave coupling is allowed and\nnot negligible. Under this symmetry, the $D_1\\bar{D}$ can couple to ${}^3D_1$\ncharmonia ($\\psi(nD)$) via both $S$ and $D$ wave, and the overall coupling is\naround three times larger than that of $\\psi(nS)$. The $X(4260)$ cannot be a\npure molecule but a mixture of a charmonium and various charmed meson\ncomponents. Since the $D_1\\bar{D}$ couples strongly to $\\psi(nD)$, our results\nsuggest that in the $D_1\\bar{D}$ molecular picture, the charmonium core of\n$X(4260)$ is $\\psi(nD)$ instead of $\\psi(nS)$. As a result, the experimental\nfact that the $R$ ratio has a dip around 4.26 GeV can be understood in the\n$D_1\\bar{D}$ molecular picture of the $X(4260)$.\n", "  We use deep Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the distribution of specific\nblack hole accretion rates ($L_X$ relative to the stellar mass of the galaxy)\nand thus trace AGN activity within star-forming and quiescent galaxies, as a\nfunction of stellar mass (from $10^{8.5}-10^{11.5} M_\\odot$) and redshift (to\n$z \\sim 4$). We adopt near-infrared selected samples of galaxies from the\nCANDELS and UltraVISTA surveys, extract X-ray data for every galaxy, and use a\nflexible Bayesian method to combine these data and to measure the probability\ndistribution function of specific black hole accretion rates,\n$\\lambda_{sBHAR}$. We identify a broad distribution of $\\lambda_{sBHAR}$ in\nboth star-forming and quiescent galaxies---likely reflecting the stochastic\nnature of AGN fuelling---with a roughly power-law shape that rises toward lower\n$\\lambda_{sBHAR}$, a steep cutoff at $\\lambda_{sBHAR} \\gtrsim 0.1-1$ (in\nEddington equivalent units), and a turnover or flattening at $\\lambda_{sBHAR}\n\\lesssim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. We find that the probability of a star-forming\ngalaxy hosting a moderate $\\lambda_{sBHAR}$ AGN depends on stellar mass and\nevolves with redshift, shifting toward higher $\\lambda_{sBHAR}$ at higher\nredshifts. This evolution is truncated at a point corresponding to the\nEddington limit, indicating black holes may self-regulate their growth at high\nredshifts when copious gas is available. The probability of a quiescent galaxy\nhosting an AGN is generally lower than that of a star-forming galaxy, shows\nsigns of suppression at the highest stellar masses, and evolves strongly with\nredshift. The AGN duty cycle in high-redshift ($z\\gtrsim2$) quiescent galaxies\nthus reaches $\\sim$20 per cent, comparable to the duty cycle in star-forming\ngalaxies of equivalent stellar mass and redshift.\n", "  Simulating quantum systems constructively furthers our understanding of\nqualitative and quantitative features which may be analytically intractable. In\nthis letter, we directly simulate and explore the entanglement structure\npresent in a paradigmatic example of quantum information: Shor's wavefunction.\nThe methodology employed is a dynamical tensor network which is initially\nconstructed as a tree tensor network, inspired by the modular exponentiation\nquantum circuit, and later efficiently mapped to a matrix product state.\nUtilizing the Schmidt number as a local entanglement metric, our construction\nexplicitly captures the wavefunction's non-local entanglement structure and an\nentanglement scaling relation is discovered. Specifically, we see that\nentanglement across a bipartition grows exponentially in the number of qubits\nbefore saturating at a critical scale which is proportional to the modular\nperiodicity.\n", "  We show that the DCSD (distinguishable clusters with all singles and doubles)\ncorrelation method permits the calculation of vibrational spectra at\nnear-CCSD(T) quality but at no more than CCSD cost, and with comparatively\ninexpensive analytical gradients. For systems dominated by a single reference\nconfiguration, even MP2.5 is a viable alternative, at MP3 cost. MP2.5\nperformance for vibrational frequencies is comparable to double hybrids such as\nDSD-PBEP86-D3BJ, but without resorting to empirical parameters. DCSD is also\nquite suitable for computing zero-point vibrational energies in computational\nthermochemistry.\n", "  Complementary auxiliary basis sets for F12 explicitly correlated calculations\nappear to be more transferable between orbital basis sets than has been\ngenerally assumed. We also find that aVnZ-F12 basis sets, originally developed\nwith anionic systems in mind, appear to be superior for noncovalent\ninteractions as well, and propose a suitable CABS sequence for them.\n", "  We present a systematic and robust approach to nonlinear gravitational\nperturbations of vacuum spacetimes. This approach provides a basis for a theory\nof nonlinear gravitational waves. In particular, we show that the system of\nperturbative Einstein equations reduces at each perturbation order to two (for\neach gravitational mode in 3 + 1 dimensions on which our study is focused)\nscalar wave equations, and then we show how the metric perturbations can be\nexplicitly obtained, once the solutions to these scalar wave equations are\nknown. These results show that the concept of polarization of a gravitational\nwave does make sense also beyond the linear approximation.\n", "  Tests of gravity at the galaxy scale are in their infancy. As a first step to\nsystematically uncovering the gravitational significance of galaxies, we map\nthree fundamental gravitational variables -- the Newtonian potential,\nacceleration and curvature -- over the galaxy environments of the local\nuniverse to a distance of approximately 200 Mpc. Our method combines the\ncontributions from galaxies in an all-sky redshift survey, halos from an N-body\nsimulation hosting low-luminosity objects, and linear and quasi-linear modes of\nthe density field. We use the ranges of these variables to determine the extent\nto which galaxies expand the scope of generic tests of gravity and are capable\nof constraining specific classes of model for which they have special\nsignificance. Finally, we investigate the improvements afforded by upcoming\ngalaxy surveys.\n", "  We explore the accuracy of the clustering-based redshift inference within the\nMICE2 simulation. This method uses the spatial clustering of galaxies between a\nspectroscopic reference sample and an unknown sample. The goal of this study is\nto give a preview of the redshift accuracy one can reach with this method. To\ndo so, we first highlight the requirements of this technique in term of number\nof objects in both the reference and unknown samples. We also confirm that this\nmethod does not require a representative spectroscopic sample for calibration.\n  We estimate that a density of spectroscopic objects of $10^{-5}$\narcmin$^{-2}$ per redshift bin of width $\\delta z = 0.01$ over $9000 \\\n\\text{deg}^{2}$ allows to reach 0.1 \\% accuracy in the mean redshift for a\ngalaxy density compatible with next generation of cosmological surveys. This\nnumber is compatible with the density of the Quasi Stellar Objects in BOSS.\nSecond we demonstrate our ability to measure individual redshifts for galaxies\nindependently from the photometric redshifts procedure. The resulting\nindividual clustering redshifts have a bias=$-0.001$, an outlier fraction of\n$\\eta=3.57\\%$ and a scatter of $\\sigma=0.027$ to $i<25$. The advantage of this\nprocedure is threefold: i) it allows the use of clustering redshifts for any\nfield in astronomy, ii) it allows the possibility to combine photometric and\nclustering based redshifts to get an improved redshift estimation, iii) it\nallows the use of cluster-$z$ to define tomographic bins for weak lensing.\nFinally we explore this last option and build 5 clustering redshift selected\ntomographic bins from redshift 0.2 to 1. We found a bias on the mean redshift\nestimate of $0.002$ per bin.\n", "  The mass spectrum of the kaon family is analyzed by the {modified}\nGodfrey-Isgur model with a color screening effect approximating the kaon as a\nheavy-light meson system. This analysis gives us the structure and possible\nassignments of the observed kaon candidates, which can be tested by comparing\nthe theoretical results of their two-body strong decays with the experimental\ndata. Additionally, prediction of some partial decay widths is made on the\nkaons still missing in experiment. This study is crucial to establishing the\nkaon family and searching for their higher excitations in the future.\n", "  Observations of the CMB today allow us to answer detailed questions about the\nproperties of our Universe, targeting both standard and non-standard physics.\nIn this paper, we study the effects of varying fundamental constants (i.e., the\nfine-structure constant, $\\alpha_{\\rm EM}$, and electron rest mass, $m_{\\rm\ne}$) around last scattering using the recombination codes CosmoRec and\nRecfast++. We approach the problem in a pedagogical manner, illustrating the\nimportance of various effects on the free electron fraction, Thomson visibility\nfunction and CMB power spectra, highlighting various degeneracies. We\ndemonstrate that the simpler Recfast++ treatment (based on a three-level atom\napproach) can be used to accurately represent the full computation of CosmoRec.\nWe also include explicit time-dependent variations using a phenomenological\npower-law description. We reproduce previous Planck 2013 results in our\nanalysis. Assuming constant variations relative to the standard values, we find\nthe improved constraints $\\alpha_{\\rm EM}/\\alpha_{\\rm EM,0}=0.9993\\pm 0.0025$\n(CMB only) and $m_{\\rm e}/m_{\\rm e,0}= 1.0039 \\pm 0.0074$ (including BAO) using\nPlanck 2015 data. For a redshift-dependent variation, $\\alpha_{\\rm\nEM}(z)=\\alpha_{\\rm EM}(z_0)\\,[(1+z)/1100]^p$ with $\\alpha_{\\rm\nEM}(z_0)\\equiv\\alpha_{\\rm EM,0}$ at $z_0=1100$, we obtain $p=0.0008\\pm 0.0025$.\nAllowing simultaneous variations of $\\alpha_{\\rm EM}(z_0)$ and $p$ yields\n$\\alpha_{\\rm EM}(z_0)/\\alpha_{\\rm EM,0} = 0.9998\\pm 0.0036$ and $p = 0.0006\\pm\n0.0036$. We also discuss combined limits on $\\alpha_{\\rm EM}$ and $m_{\\rm e}$.\nOur analysis shows that existing data is not only sensitive to the value of the\nfundamental constants around recombination but also its first time derivative.\nThis suggests that a wider class of varying fundamental constant models can be\nprobed using the CMB.\n", "  A possibility of the topological Kosterlitz-Thouless~(KT) transition in the\nPokrovsky-Talapov~(PT) model is investigated by using the functional\nrenormalization-group (RG) approach by Wetterich. Our main finding is that the\nnonzero misfit parameter of the model, which can be related with the linear\ngradient term (Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction), makes such a transition\nimpossible, what contradicts the previous consideration of this problem by\nnon-perturbative RG methods. To support the conclusion the initial PT model is\nreformulated in terms of the 2D theory of relativistic fermions using an\nanalogy between the 2D sine-Gordon and the massive Thirring models. In the new\nformalism the misfit parameter corresponds to an effective gauge field that\nenables to include it in the RG procedure on an equal footing with the other\nparameters of the theory. The Wetterich equation is applied to obtain flow\nequations for the parameters of the new fermionic action. We demonstrate that\nthese equations reproduce the KT type of behavior if the misfit parameter is\nzero. However, any small nonzero value of the quantity rules out a possibility\nof the KT transition. To confirm the finding we develop a description of the\nproblem in terms of the 2D Coulomb gas model. Within the approach the breakdown\nof the KT scenario gains a transparent meaning, the misfit gives rise to an\neffective in-plane electric field that prevents a formation of bound\nvortex-antivortex pairs.\n", "  The second and the third order anisotropic flow, $V_{2}$ and $V_3$, are\nmostly determined by the corresponding initial spatial anisotropy coefficients,\n$\\varepsilon_{2}$ and $\\varepsilon_{3}$, in the initial density distribution.\nIn addition to their dependence on the same order initial anisotropy\ncoefficient, higher order anisotropic flow, $V_n$ ($n > 3$), can also have a\nsignificant contribution from lower order initial anisotropy coefficients,\nwhich leads to mode-coupling effects. In this Letter we investigate the linear\nand non-linear modes in higher order anisotropic flow $V_n$ for $n=4$, $5$, $6$\nwith the ALICE detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurements are done\nfor particles in the pseudorapidity range $|\\eta| < 0.8$ and the transverse\nmomentum range $0.2 < p_{\\rm T} < 5.0$ GeV/$c$ as a function of collision\ncentrality. The results are compared with theoretical calculations and provide\nimportant constraints on the initial conditions, including initial spatial\ngeometry and its fluctuations, as well as the ratio of the shear viscosity to\nentropy density of the produced system.\n", "  Tidal disruption events (TDEs) observed in massive galaxies with inferred\ncentral black hole masses $M_h > 10^8 \\ M_\\odot$ are presumptive candidates for\nTDEs by lower mass secondaries in binary systems. We use hydrodynamic\nsimulations to quantify the characteristics of such TDEs, focusing on extreme\nmass ratio binaries and mpc separations where the debris stream samples the\nbinary potential. The simulations are initialised with disruption trajectories\nfrom 3-body integrations of stars with parabolic orbits with respect to the\nbinary center of mass. The most common outcome is found to be the formation of\nan unbound debris stream, with either weak late-time accretion or no accretion\nat all. A substantial fraction of streams remain bound, however, and these\ncommonly yield structured fallback rate curves that exhibit multiple peaks or\nsharp drops. We apply our results to the superluminous supernova candidate\nASASSN-15lh and show that its features, including its anomalous rebrightening\nat $\\sim 100$ days after detection, are consistent with the tidal disruption of\na star by a supermassive black hole in a binary system.\n", "  We present the first ever measurements of femtoscopic correlations between\nthe K$^0_{\\rm S}$ and K$^{\\rm \\pm}$ particles. The analysis was performed on\nthe data from Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV measured by the\nALICE experiment. The observed femtoscopic correlations are consistent with\nfinal-state interactions proceeding via the $a_0(980)$ resonance. The extracted\nkaon source radius and correlation strength parameters for K$^0_{\\rm S}$K$^{\\rm\n-}$ are found to be equal within the experimental uncertainties to those for\nK$^0_{\\rm S}$K$^{\\rm +}$. Comparing the results of the present study with those\nfrom published identical-kaon femtoscopic studies by ALICE, mass and coupling\nparameters for the $a_0$ resonance are constrained. Our results are also\ncompatible with the interpretation of the $a_0$ having a tetraquark structure\nover that of a diquark.\n", "  The parameterised post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism has enabled stringent tests\nof static weak-field gravity in a theory-independent manner. Here we\nincorporate screening mechanisms of modified gravity theories into the\nframework by introducing an effective gravitational coupling and defining the\nPPN parameters as functions of position. To determine these functions we\ndevelop a general method for efficiently performing the post-Newtonian\nexpansion in screened regimes. For illustration, we derive all the PPN\nfunctions for a cubic galileon and a chameleon model. We also analyse the\nShapiro time delay effect for these two models and find no deviations from\nGeneral Relativity insofar as the signal path and the perturbing mass reside in\na screened region of space.\n", "  The possible spectra of one-particle reduced density matrices that are\ncompatible with a pure multipartite quantum system of finite dimension form a\nconvex polytope. We introduce a new construction of inner- and outer-bounding\npolytopes that constrain the polytope for the entire quantum system. The outer\nbound is sharp. The inner polytope stems only from doubly excited states. We\nfind all quantum systems, where the bounds coincide giving the entire polytope.\nWe show, that those systems are: i) any system of two particles ii) $L$ qubits,\niii) three fermions on $N\\leq 7$ levels, iv) any number of bosons on any number\nof levels and v) fermionic Fock space on $N\\leq 5$ levels. The methods we use\ncome from symplectic geometry and representation theory of compact Lie groups.\nIn particular, we study the images of proper momentum maps, where our method\ndescribes momentum images for all representations that are spherical.\n", "  We utilise a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of\ngalaxy formation to investigate the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV)\nslope, beta, and the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV luminosity (IRX) in\nthe spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. We employ dust radiative\ntransfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate\nthrough the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the\norigin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of\nsimplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the\nessential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic\ndeviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular\npopulations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that\nhave young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting\nregions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard\nMeurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models.\nScatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older\nstellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local\nstarbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex\ngeometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue\nUV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction\ncurves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV\nextinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive\na fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the\ncanonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an\nunderstanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of\ngalaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z~2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z>5 star\nforming galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the FLRW type cosmology of the Induced Dark Energy model and\nillustrate that the extra terms emerging from the fifth dimension can play the\nrole of dark energy. The model predicts the expansion with deceleration at\nearly time and acceleration in late time for an open universe.\n", "  We provide an in-depth investigation of parameter estimation in Nested\nMach-Zehnder interferometers (NMZIs) using two information measures: the\nShannon mutual information and the classical Fisher information. Protocols for\ncounterfactual communition (CFC) have, so far, been based on two different\ndefinitions of counterfactuality. In particular, some schemes have been based\non NMZI devices, but have recently been subject to criticism. We provide a\nmethodology for evaluating the counterfactuality of these protocols, based on\nan information theoretical framework. More specifically, we make the assumption\nthat any realistic quantum channel in MZI structures will have some weak\nuncontrolled interaction, and we use the Fisher information to measure\ncounterfactual violations. The measure is used to evaluate the suggested\ncounterfactual communication protocol by Salih et al. \\cite{Salih13}. The\nprotocol of Arvidsson-Shukur and Barnes \\cite{ArvShukur16}, based on a\ndifferent definition, is evaluated with a probability measure. Our results show\nthat the definition of Arvidsson-Shukur and Barnes is satisfied by their\nscheme, whilst that of Salih et al. is only satisfied by perfect quantum\nchannels. For realistic devices the latter protocol does not achieve its\nobjective.\n", "  Of the roughly 3000 neutron stars known, only a handful have sub-stellar\ncompanions. The most famous of these are the low-mass planets around the\nmillisecond pulsar B1257+12. New evidence indicates that observational biases\ncould still hide a wide variety of planetary systems around most neutron stars.\nWe consider the environment and physical processes relevant to neutron star\nplanets, in particular the effect of X-ray irradiation and the relativistic\npulsar wind on the planetary atmosphere. We discuss the survival time of planet\natmospheres and the planetary surface conditions around different classes of\nneutron stars, and define a neutron star habitable zone. Depending on as-yet\npoorly constrained aspects of the pulsar wind, both Super-Earths around\nB1257+12 could lie within its habitable zone.\n", "  We consider the first order form of the Einstein-Hilbert action and quantize\nit using the path integral. Two gauge fixing conditions are imposed so that the\ngraviton propagator is both traceless and transverse. It is shown that these\ntwo gauge conditions result in two complex Fermionic vector ghost fields and\none real Bosonic vector ghost field. All Feynman diagrams to any order in\nperturbation theory can be constructed from two real Bosonic fields, two\nFermionic ghost fields and one real Bosonic ghost field that propagate. These\nfive fields interact through just five three point vertices and one four point\nvertex.\n", "  Photometry from the Kepler mission is optimized to detect small, short\nduration signals like planet transits at the expense of long-term trends. This\nlong-term variability can be recovered in photometry from the Full Frame Images\n(FFIs), a set of calibration data collected approximately monthly during the\nKepler mission. Here, we present f3, an open-source package to perform\nphotometry on the Kepler FFIs in order to detect changes in the brightness of\nstars in the Kepler field of view over long time baselines. We apply this\npackage to a sample of 4,000 Sun-like stars with measured rotation periods. We\nfind $\\approx 10\\%$ of these targets have long-term variability in their\nobserved flux. For the majority of targets we identify the luminosity\nvariations are either correlated or anticorrelated with the short-term\nvariability due to starspots on the stellar surface. We find a transition\nbetween anticorrelated (starspot-dominated) variability and correlated\n(facula-dominated) variability between rotation periods of 15 and 25 days,\nsuggesting the transition between the two modes is complete for stars at the\nage of the Sun. We also identify a sample of stars with apparently complete\ncycles, as well as a collection of short-period binaries with extreme\nphotometric variation over the Kepler mission.\n", "  Supermassive primordial stars forming in atomically-cooled halos at $z\n\\sim15-20$ are currently thought to be the progenitors of the earliest quasars\nin the Universe. In this picture, the star evolves under accretion rates of\n$0.1 - 1$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ until the general relativistic instability\ntriggers its collapse to a black hole at masses of $\\sim10^5$ $M_\\odot$.\nHowever, the ability of the accretion flow to sustain such high rates depends\ncrucially on the photospheric properties of the accreting star, because its\nionising radiation could reduce or even halt accretion. Here we present new\nmodels of supermassive Population III protostars accreting at rates $0.001 -\n10$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, computed with the GENEVA stellar evolution code\nincluding general relativistic corrections to the internal structure. We use\nthe polytropic stability criterion to estimate the mass at which the collapse\noccurs, which has been shown to give a lower limit of the actual mass at\ncollapse in recent hydrodynamic simulations. We find that at accretion rates\nhigher than $0.001$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ the stars evolve as red, cool\nsupergiants with surface temperatures below $10^4$ K towards masses $>10^5$\n$M_\\odot$, and become blue and hot, with surface temperatures above $10^5$ K,\nonly for rates $\\lesssim0.001$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Compared to previous\nstudies, our results extend the range of masses and accretion rates at which\nthe ionising feedback remains weak, reinforcing the case for direct collapse as\nthe origin of the first quasars.\n", "  The rarefied effect of gas flow in microchannel is significant and cannot be\nwell described by traditional hydrodynamic models. It has been know that\ndiscrete Boltzmann model (DBM) has the potential to investigate flows in a\nrelatively wider range of Knudsen number because of its intrinsic kinetic\nnature inherited from Boltzmann equation. It is crucial to have a proper\nkinetic boundary condition for DBM to capture the velocity slip and the flow\ncharacteristics in the Knudsen layer. In this paper, we present a DBM combined\nwith Maxwell-type boundary condition model for slip flow. The tangential\nmomentum accommodation coefficient is introduced to implement a gas-surface\ninteraction model. Both the velocity slip and the Knudsen layer under various\nKnudsen numbers and accommodation coefficients can be well described. Two kinds\nof slip flows, including Couette flow and Poiseuille flow, are simulated to\nverify the model. To dynamically compare results from different models, the\nrelation between the definition of Knudsen number in hard sphere model and that\nin BGK model is clarified.\n", "  A quantum representation of holonomies and exponentiated fluxes of a $U(1)$\ngauge theory that contains the Pullin-Dittrich-Geiller (DG) vacuum is presented\nand discussed. Our quantization is performed manifestly in a continuum theory,\nwithout any discretization. The discretness emerges on the quantum level as a\nproperty of the spectrum of the quantum holonomy operators. The new type of a\ncylindrical consistency present in the DG approach, now follows easily and\nnaturally. A generalization to the non--Abelian case seems possible.\n", "  We present temperature dependent inelastic neutron scattering measurments,\naccompanied byab-initio calculations of phonon spectra and elastic properties\nas a function of pressure to understand anharmonicity of phonons and to study\nthe mechanism of negative thermal expansion and negative linear compressibility\nbehaviour of ZnAu2(CN)4. The mechanism is identified in terms of specific\nanharmonic modes that involve bending of the Zn(CN)4-Au- Zn(CN)4 linkage. The\nhigh-pressure phase transition at about 2 GPa is also investigated and found to\nbe related to softening of a phonon mode at the L-point at the Brillouin zone\nboundary and its coupling with a zone-centre phonon and an M-point phonon in\nthe ambient pressure phase. Although the phase transition is primarily driven\nby a L-point soft phonon mode, which usually leads to a second order transition\nwith a 2 x 2 x 2 supercell, in the present case the structure is close to an\nelastic instability that leads to a weakly first order transition.\n", "  We introduce $Recursive~Jigsaw~Reconstruction$, a technique for analyzing\nreconstructed particle interactions in the presence of kinematic and\ncombinatoric unknowns associated with unmeasured and indistinguishable\nparticles, respectively. By factorizing missing information according to decays\nand rest frames of intermediate particles, an interchangeable and configurable\nset of $Jigsaw~Rules$, algorithms for resolving these unknowns, are applied to\napproximately reconstruct decays with arbitrarily many particles, in their\nentirety.\n  That the Recursive Jigsaw Reconstruction approach can be used to analyze\n$any$ event topology of interest, with any number of ambiguities, is\ndemonstrated through a twelve different simulated LHC physics examples. These\ninclude the production and decay of $W$, $Z$, Higgs bosons, and supersymmetric\nparticles including gluinos, stop quarks, charginos, and neutralinos.\n", "  Fragmentation of a spiral arm is thought to drive the formation of giant\nclumps in galaxies. Using linear perturbation analysis for self-gravitating\nspiral arms, we derive an instability parameter and define the conditions for\nclump formation. We extend our analysis to multi-component systems that consist\nof gas and stars in an external potential. We then perform numerical\nsimulations of isolated disc galaxies with isothermal gas, and compare the\nresults with the prediction of our analytic model. Our model describes\naccurately the evolution of the spiral arms in our simulations, even when\nspiral arms dynamically interact with one another. We show that most of the\ngiant clumps formed in the simulated disc galaxies satisfy the instability\ncondition. The clump masses predicted by our model are in agreement with the\nsimulation results, but the growth time-scale of unstable perturbations is\noverestimated by a factor of a few. We also apply our instability analysis to\nderive scaling relations of clump properties. The expected scaling relation\nbetween the clump size, velocity dispersion, and circular velocity is slightly\ndifferent from that given by the Toomre instability analysis, but neither is\ninconsistent with currently available observations. We argue that the\nspiral-arm instability is a viable formation mechanism of giant clumps in\ngas-rich disc galaxies.\n", "  We propose a general way to complete supersymmetric theories with operators\nbelow the unitarity bound, adding gauge-singlet fields which enforce the\ndecoupling of such operators. This makes it possible to perform all usual\ncomputations, and to compactify on a circle. We concentrate on a duality\nbetween an $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory and the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $A_3$\nArgyres-Douglas [1,2], mapping the moduli space and chiral ring of the\ncompleted $\\mathcal{N}=1$ theory to those of the $A_3$ model. We reduce the\ncompleted gauge theory to $3d$, finding a $3d$ duality with $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nSQED with two flavors. The naive dimensional reduction is instead\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SQED. Crucial is a concept of chiral ring stability, which\nmodifies the superpotential and allows for a $3d$ emergent global symmetry.\n", "  We study the symmetry energy and the core-crust transition in neutron stars\nusing the finite-range Gogny nuclear interaction and examine the deduced\ncrustal thickness and crustal moment of inertia. We start by analyzing the\nsecond-, fourth- and sixth-order coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the\nenergy per particle in powers of the isospin asymmetry for Gogny forces. These\ncoefficients provide information about the departure of the symmetry energy\nfrom the widely used parabolic law. The neutron star core-crust transition is\nevaluated by looking at the onset of thermodynamical instability of the liquid\ncore. The calculation is performed with the exact (i.e., without Taylor\nexpansion) Gogny EoS for the core, and also with its Taylor expansion in order\nto assess the influence of isospin expansions on locating the inner edge of\nneutron star crusts. It is found that the properties of the core-crust\ntransition derived from the exact EoS differ from the predictions of the Taylor\nexpansion even when the expansion is carried through sixth order in the isospin\nasymmetry. Gogny forces, using the exact EoS, predict the ranges $0.094 \\text{\nfm}^{-3} \\lesssim \\rho_t \\lesssim 0.118\\text{ fm}^{-3}$ for the transition\ndensity and $0.339 \\text{ MeV fm}^{-3} \\lesssim P_t \\lesssim 0.665 \\text{ MeV\nfm}^{-3}$ for the transition pressure. The transition densities show an\nanticorrelation with the slope parameter $L$ of the symmetry energy. The\ntransition pressures are not found to correlate with $L$. Neutron stars\nobtained with Gogny forces have maximum masses below $1.74M_\\odot$ and\nrelatively small moments of inertia. The crustal mass and moment of inertia are\nevaluated and comparisons are made with the constraints from observed glitches\nin pulsars.\n", "  A method for calculating the one-way quantum deficit is developed. It\ninvolves a careful study of post-measured entropy shapes.\n  We discovered that in some regions of X-state space the post-measured entropy\n$\\tilde S$ as a function of measurement angle $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi/2]$ exhibits a\nbimodal behavior inside the open interval $(0,\\pi/2)$, i.e., it has two\ninterior extrema: one minimum and one maximum. Furthermore, cases are found\nwhen the interior minimum of such a bimodal function\n  $\\tilde S(\\theta)$ is less than that one at the endpoint $\\theta=0$ or\n$\\pi/2$.\n  This leads to the formation of a boundary between the phases of one-way\nquantum deficit via\n  {\\em finite} jumps of optimal measured angle from the endpoint to the\ninterior minimum. Phase diagram is built up for a two-parameter family of X\nstates. The subregions with variable optimal measured angle are around 1$\\%$ of\nthe total region, with their relative linear sizes achieving $17.5\\%$, and the\nfidelity between the states of those subregions can be reduced to $F=0.968$.\n  In addition, a correction to the one-way deficit due to the interior minimum\ncan achieve\n  $2.3\\%$. Such conditions are favorable to detect the subregions with variable\noptimal measured angle of one-way quantum deficit in an experiment.\n", "  Interfacial instability is highly relevant to many important biological\nprocesses. A key example arises in wound healing experiments, which observe\nthat an epithelial layer with an initially straight edge does not heal\nuniformly. We consider the phenomenon in the context of active fluids.\nImproving upon the approximation used in J. Zimmermann, M. Basan and H. Levine,\nEuro. Phys. J.: Special Topics 223, 1259 (2014), we perform a linear stability\nanalysis on a two dimensional incompressible hydrodynamic model of an active\nfluid with an open interface. We categorise the stability of the model and find\nthat for experimentally relevant parameters, fingering stability is always\nabsent in this minimal model. Our results point to the crucial importance of\ndensity variation in the fingering instability in tissue regeneration.\n", "  We explore the origin of fast molecular outflows that have been observed in\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Previous numerical studies have shown that it is\ndifficult to create such an outflow by accelerating existing molecular clouds\nin the host galaxy, as the clouds will be destroyed before they can reach the\nhigh velocities that are observed. In this work, we consider an alternative\nscenario where molecules form in-situ within the AGN outflow. We present a\nseries of hydro-chemical simulations of an isotropic AGN wind interacting with\na uniform medium. We follow the time-dependent chemistry of 157 species,\nincluding 20 molecules, to determine whether molecules can form rapidly enough\nto produce the observed molecular outflows. We find H$_2$ outflow rates up to\n140 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is sensitive to density, AGN luminosity, and\nmetallicity. We compute emission and absorption lines of CO, OH and warm (a few\nhundred K) H$_2$ from the simulations in post-processing. The CO-derived\noutflow rates and OH absorption strengths at solar metallicity agree with\nobservations, although the maximum line of sight velocities from the model CO\nspectra are a factor $\\approx$2 lower than is observed. We derive a CO (1-0) to\nH$_2$ conversion factor of $\\alpha_{\\rm{CO} (1-0)}$ = 0.13 M$_\\odot$ (K km\ns$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$, 6 times lower than is commonly assumed in observations\nof such systems. We find strong emission from the mid-infrared lines of H$_2$.\nThe mass of H$_2$ traced by this infrared emission is within a few per cent of\nthe total H$_2$ mass. This H$_2$ emission may be observable by JWST.\n", "  If a component of dark matter has dissipative interactions, it can cool to\nform compact astrophysical objects with higher density than that of\nconventional cold dark matter (sub)haloes. Dark matter annihilations might then\nappear as point sources, leading to novel morphology for indirect detection. We\nexplore dissipative models where interaction with the Standard Model might\nprovide visible signals, and show how such objects might give rise to the\nobserved excess in gamma rays arising from the galactic center.\n", "  Annihilating dark matter (DM) models offer promising avenues for future DM\ndetection, in particular via modification of astrophysical signals. However\nwhen modelling such potential signals at high redshift the emergence of both\ndark matter and baryonic structure, as well as the complexities of the energy\ntransfer process, need to be taken into account. In the following paper we\npresent a detailed energy deposition code and use this to examine the energy\ntransfer efficiency of annihilating dark matter at high redshift, including the\neffects on baryonic structure. We employ the PYTHIA code to model\nneutralino-like DM candidates and their subsequent annihilation products for a\nrange of masses and annihilation channels. We also compare different density\nprofiles and mass-concentration relations for 10^5-10^7 M_sun haloes at\nredshifts 20 and 40. For these DM halo and particle models, we show radially\ndependent ionisation and heating curves and compare the deposited energy to the\nhaloes' gravitational binding energy. We use the \"filtered\" annihilation\nspectra escaping the halo to calculate the heating of the circumgalactic medium\nand show that the mass of the minimal star forming object is increased by a\nfactor of 2-3 at redshift 20 and 4-5 at redshift 40 for some DM models.\n", "  We have found that in two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow a single\nspatially-localized turbulence (SLT) exists stably and travels with a constant\nspeed on average switching the moving direction randomly and intermittently for\nmoderate values of control parameters: Reynolds number and the flow rate. We\ndefine the coarse-grained position and velocity of an SLT and separate the\nmotion of the SLT from its internal turbulent dynamics by introducing a\nco-moving frame. The switching process of an SLT represented by the\ncoarse-grained velocity seems to be a random telegraph signal. Focusing on the\nasymmetry of the internal turbulence we introduce two coarse-grained variables\ncharacterizing the internal dynamics. These quantities follow the switching\nprocess reasonably. This suggests that the twin attracting invariant sets each\nof which corresponds to a one-way traveling SLT are embedded in the attractor\nof the moving SLT and the connection of the two sets is too complicated to be\nrepresented by a few degrees of freedom but the motion of an SLT is controlled\nby the internal turbulent dynamics.\n", "  We consider a dilute fluorinated graphene nanoribbon as a spin-active\nelement. The fluorine adatoms introduce a local spin-orbit Rashba interaction\nthat induces spin-precession for electron passing by. In the absence of the\nexternal magnetic field the transport is dominated by multiple scattering by\nadatoms which cancels the spin precession effects, since the direction of the\nspin precession depends on the electron momentum. Accumulation of the spin\nprecession effects is possible provided that the Fermi level electron passes\nmany times near the same adatom with the same momentum. In order to arrange for\nthese conditions a circular n-p junction can be introduced to the ribbon by\ne.g. potential of the tip of an atomic force microscope. In the quantum Hall\nconditions the electron current gets confined along the junction. The electron\nspin interaction with the local Rashba field changes with the lifetime of the\nquasi-bound states that is controlled with the coupling of the junction to the\nedge of the ribbon. We demonstrate that the spin-flip probability can be\nincreased in this manner by as much as three orders of magnitude.\n", "  We report on the discovery of three especially bright candidate $z_{phot}\n\\gtrsim 8$ galaxies. Five sources were targeted for follow-up with HST/WFC3,\nselected from a larger sample of 16 bright ($24.8 \\lesssim H\\lesssim25.5$~mag)\ncandidate $z\\gtrsim 8$ LBGs identified over the 1.6 degrees$^2$ of the\nCOSMOS/UltraVISTA field. These were identified as Y and J dropouts by\nleveraging the deep (Y-to-$K_{S} \\sim 25.3-24.8$~mag, $5\\sigma$) NIR data from\nthe UltraVISTA DR3 release, deep ground based optical imaging from the CFHTLS\nand Subaru Suprime Cam programs and Spitzer/IRAC mosaics combining observations\nfrom the SMUVS and SPLASH programs. Through the refined spectral energy\ndistributions, which now also include new HyperSuprime Cam g, r, i, z and Y\nband data, we confirm that 3/5 galaxies have robust $z_{phot}\\sim8.0-8.7$,\nconsistent with the initial selection. The remaining 2/5 galaxies have a\nnominal $z_{phot}\\sim2$. However, if we use the HST data alone, these objects\nhave increased probability of being at $z\\sim9$. Furthermore, we measure mean\nUV continuum slopes $\\beta=-1.91\\pm0.26$ for the three $z\\sim8-9$ galaxies,\nmarginally bluer than similarly luminous $z\\sim4-6$ in CANDELS but consistent\nwith previous measurements of similarly luminous galaxies at $z\\sim7$. The\ncircularized effective radius for our brightest source is $0.9\\pm0.2$ kpc,\nsimilar to previous measurements for a bright $z\\sim11$ galaxy and bright\n$z\\sim7$ galaxies. Finally, enlarging our sample to include the six brightest\n$z\\sim8$ LBGs identified over UltraVISTA (i.e., including three other sources\nfrom Labbe et al. 2017, in prep.) we estimate for the first time the volume\ndensity of galaxies at the extreme bright ($M_{UV}\\sim-22$~mag) end of the\n$z\\sim8$ UV LF. Despite this exceptional result, the still large statistical\nuncertainties do not allow us to discriminate between a Schechter and a double\npower-law form.\n", "  Half-metallicity and low magnetic damping are perpetually sought for in\nspintronics materials and full Heusler alloys in this respect provide\noutstanding properties. However, it is challenging to obtain the well-ordered\nhalf-metallic phase in as-deposited full Heusler alloys thin films and theory\nhas struggled to establish a fundamentals understanding of the temperature\ndependent Gilbert damping in these systems. Here we present a study of the\ntemperature dependent Gilbert damping of differently ordered as-deposited\nCo2FeAl full Heusler alloy thin films. The sum of inter- and intraband electron\nscattering in conjunction with the finite electron lifetime in Bloch states\ngovern the Gilbert damping for the well-ordered phase in contrast to the\ndamping of partially-ordered and disordered phases which is governed by\ninterband electronic scattering alone. These results, especially the ultralow\nroom temperature intrinsic damping observed for the well-ordered phase provide\nnew fundamental insights to the physical origin of the Gilbert damping in full\nHeusler alloy thin films.\n", "  Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often\nnon-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic --- spots move on the stellar surface and\nhave finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in\nphase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a\nrotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces\nhave many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate\nor high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate\neffective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel\nfunction. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior\nprobability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalising over the\nother kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test\nthe effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated\nstellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces\nperiods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an\nautocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real\ndata, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously\nmeasured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these 1132 Kepler\nobjects of interest and their posterior probability density function samples.\nBecause this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will\nenable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those\ninvolving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in\nexoplanet systems, or characterising star-planet interactions. The code used to\nimplement this method is available online.\n", "  We propose in this work new systems of equations which we call $p$-Euler\nequations and $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. $p$-Euler equations are derived as\nthe Euler-Lagrange equations for the action represented by the Benamou-Brenier\ncharacterization of Wasserstein-$p$ distances, with incompressibility\nconstraint. $p$-Euler equations have similar structures with the usual Euler\nequations but the `momentum' is the signed ($p-1$)-th power of the velocity. In\nthe 2D case, the $p$-Euler equations have streamfunction-vorticity formulation,\nwhere the vorticity is given by the $p$-Laplacian of the streamfunction. By\nadding diffusion presented by $\\gamma$-Laplacian of the velocity, we obtain\nwhat we call $p$-Navier-Stokes equations. If $\\gamma=p$, the {\\it a priori}\nenergy estimates for the velocity and momentum have dual symmetries. Using\nthese energy estimates and a time-shift estimate, we show the global existence\nof weak solutions for the $p$-Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ for\n$\\gamma=p$ and $p\\ge d\\ge 2$ through a compactness criterion.\n", "  Nonequilibrium dynamics in correlated materials has attracted attention due\nto the possibility of characterizing, tuning, and creating complex ordered\nstates. To understand the photoinduced microscopic dynamics, especially the\nlinkage under realistic pump conditions between transient states and remnant\nelementary excitations, we performed nonperturbative simulations of various\ntime-resolved spectroscopies. We used the Mott antiferromagnetic insulator as a\nmodel platform. The transient dynamics of multi-particle excitations can be\nattributed to the interplay between Floquet virtual states and a modification\nof the density of states, in which interactions induce a spectral weight\ntransfer. Using an autocorrelation of the time-dependent spectral function, we\nshow that resonance of the virtual states with the upper Hubbard band in the\nMott insulator provides the route towards manipulating the electronic\ndistribution and modifying charge and spin excitations. Our results link\ntransient dynamics to the nature of many-body excitations and provide an\nopportunity to design nonequilibrium states of matter via tuned laser pulses.\n", "  Using electromagnetism to study analogue space-times is tantamount to\nconsidering consistency conditions for when a given (meta-)material would\nprovide an analogue space-time model or --- vice versa --- characterizing which\ngiven metric could be modelled with a (meta-)material. While the consistency\nconditions themselves are by now well known and studied, the form the metric\ntakes once they are satisfied is not. This question is mostly easily answered\nby keeping the formalisms of the two research fields here in contact as close\nto each other as possible. While fully covariant formulations of the\nelectrodynamics of media have been around for a long while, they are usually\nabandoned for (3+1)- or 6-dimensional formalisms. Here we shall use the fully\nunified and fully covariant approach. This enables us even to generalize the\nconsistency conditions for the existence of an effective metric to arbitrary\nbackground metrics beyond flat space-time electrodynamics. We also show how the\nfamiliar matrices for permittivity $\\epsilon$, permeability $\\mu^{-1}$, and\nmagneto-electric effects $\\zeta$ can be seen as the three independent pieces of\nthe Bel decomposition for the constitutive tensor $Z^{abcd}$, i.e., the\ncomponents of an orthogonal decomposition with respect to a given observer with\nfour-velocity $V^a$. Finally, we shall use the Moore--Penrose pseudo-inverse\nand the closely related pseudo-determinant to then gain the desired\nreconstruction of the effective metric in terms of the permittivity tensor\n$\\epsilon^{ab}$, the permeability tensor $[\\mu^{-1}]^{ab}$, and the\nmagneto-electric tensor $\\zeta^{ab}$, as an explicit function\n$g_{\\text{eff}}(\\epsilon,\\mu^{-1},\\zeta)$.\n", "  We witness multipartite entanglement in the Kitaev chain -- a benchmark model\nof one dimensional topological insulator -- also with variable-range pairing,\nusing the quantum Fisher information. Phases having a finite winding number,\nboth for short- and long-range pairing, are characterized by a power-law\ndiverging finite-size scaling of multipartite entanglement. Moreover the\noccurring quantum phase transitions are sharply marked by the divergence of the\nderivative of the quantum Fisher information, even in the absence of a closing\nenergy gap.\n", "  We present high-field electron spin resonance (ESR) studies of the\nhoneycomb-lattice material $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a prime candidate to exhibit\nKitaev physics. Two modes of antiferromagnetic resonance were detected in the\nzigzag ordered phase, with magnetic field applied in the $ab$ plane. A very\nrich excitation spectrum was observed in the field-induced quantum paramagnetic\nphase. The obtained data are compared with results of recent numerical\ncalculations, strongly suggesting a very unconventional multiparticle character\nof the spin dynamics in $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The frequency-field diagram of the\nlowest-energy ESR mode is found consistent with the behavior of the\nfield-induced energy gap, revealed by thermodynamic measurements.\n", "  The spin galvanic effect (SGE) describes the conversion of a non-equilibrium\nspin polarization into a transverse charge current. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated a large conversion efficiency for the two-dimensional electron gas\nformed at the interface between two insulating oxides, LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$.\nHere we analyze the SGE for oxide interfaces within a three-band model for the\nTi t$_{2g}$ orbitals which displays an interesting variety of effective\nspin-orbit couplings in the individual bands that contribute differently to the\nspin-charge conversion. Our analytical approach is supplemented by a numerical\ntreatment where we also investigate the influence of disorder and temperature,\nwhich turns out to be crucial to provide an appropriate description of the\nexperimental data.\n", "  Coherent control of the resonant response in spatially extended\noptomechanical structures is complicated by the fact that the optical drive is\naffected by the back-action from the generated phonons. Here we report a new\napproach to coherent control based on stimulated Raman-like scattering, in\nwhich the optical pressure can remain unaffected by the induced vibrations even\nin the regime of strong optomechanical interactions. We demonstrate\nexperimentally coherent control of flexural vibrations simultaneously along the\nwhole length of a dual-nanoweb fiber, by imprinting steps in the relative phase\nbetween the components of a two-frequency pump signal,the beat frequency being\nchosen to match a flexural resonance. Furthermore, sequential switching of the\nrelative phase at time intervals shorter than the lifetime of the vibrations\nreduces their amplitude to a constant value that is fully adjustable by tuning\nthe phase-modulation depth and switching rate. The results may trigger new\ndevelopments in silicon photonics, since such coherent control uniquely\ndecouples the amplitude of optomechanical oscillations from power-dependent\nthermal effects and nonlinear optical loss.\n", "  Superfluidity in coupled electron-hole sheets of bilayer graphene is\npredicted here to be multicomponent because of the conduction and valence\nbands. We investigate the superfluid crossover properties as functions of the\ntunable carrier densities and the tunable energy band gap $E_g$. For small band\ngaps there is a significant boost in the two superfluid gaps, but the\ninteraction driven excitations from the valence to the conduction band can\nweaken the superfluidity, even blocking the system from entering the BEC regime\nat low densities. At a given larger density, a band gap $E_g\\sim 40$-$60$ meV\ncan carry the system into the strong-pairing multiband BCS-BEC crossover\nregime, the optimal range for realization of high-$T_c$ superfluidity.\n", "  Many reports on stimulated Raman scattering in mixtures of Raman-active and\nnoble gases indicate that the addition of a dispersive buffer gas increases the\nphase-mismatch to higher-order Stokes and antiStokes sidebands, resulting in\npreferential conversion to the first few Stokes lines, accompanied by a\nsignificant reduction in Raman gain due to collisions with buffer gas\nmolecules. Here we report that, provided the dispersion can be precisely\ncontrolled, the effective Raman gain in gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal\nfiber (PCF) can actually be significantly enhanced when a buffer gas is added.\nThis counterintuitive behavior occurs when the nonlinear coupling between the\ninteracting fields is strong, and can result in a performance similar to that\nof a pure Raman-active gas, but at much lower total gas pressure, allowing\ncompeting effects such as Raman backscattering to be suppressed. We report high\nmodal purity in all the emitted sidebands, along with anti-Stokes conversion\nefficiencies as high as 5% in the visible and 2% in the ultraviolet. The\nresults point to a new class of gas-based waveguide device in which the\npressure-tunable nonlinear optical response is beneficially adjusted by the\naddition of other gases.\n", "  Cosmological parameter constraints from observations of time-delay lenses are\nbecoming increasingly precise. However, there may be significant bias and\nscatter in these measurements due to, among other things, the so-called\nmass-sheet degeneracy. To estimate these uncertainties, we analyze strong\nlenses from the largest EAGLE hydrodynamical simulation. We apply a mass-sheet\ntransformation to the radial density profiles of lenses, and by selecting\nlenses near isothermality, we find that the bias on H0 can be reduced to 5%\nwith an intrinsic scatter of 10%, confirming previous results performed on a\ndifferent simulation data set. We further investigate whether combining lensing\nobservables with kinematic constraints helps to minimize this bias. We do not\ndetect any significant dependence of the bias on lens model parameters or\nobservational properties of the galaxy, but depending on the source--lens\nconfiguration, a bias may still exist. Cross lenses provide an accurate\nestimate of the Hubble constant, while fold (double) lenses tend to be biased\nlow (high). With kinematic constraints, double lenses show bias and intrinsic\nscatter of 6% and 10%, respectively, while quad lenses show bias and intrinsic\nscatter of 0.5% and 10%, respectively. For lenses with a reduced $\\chi^2 > 1$,\na power-law dependence of the $\\chi^2$ on the lens environment (number of\nnearby galaxies) is seen. Lastly, we model, in greater detail, the cases of two\ndouble lenses that are significantly biased. We are able to remove the bias,\nsuggesting that the remaining biases could also be reduced by carefully taking\ninto account additional sources of systematic uncertainty.\n", "  In this paper, the holographic superconductor model with two s-wave orders\nfrom 4+1 dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is explored in the probe\nlimit. At different values of the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient $\\alpha$, we study\nthe influence of tuning the mass and charge parameters of the bulk scalar field\non the free energy curve of condensed solution with signal s-wave order, and\ncompare the difference of tuning the two different parameters while the changes\nof the critical temperature are the same. Based on the above results, it is\nindicated that the two free energy curves of different s-wave orders can have\none or two intersection points, where two typical phase transition behaviors of\nthe s+s coexistent phase, including the reentrant phase transition near the\nChern-Simons limit $\\alpha=0.25$, can be found. We also give an explanation to\nthe nontrivial behavior of the $T_c-\\alpha$ curves near the Chern-Simons limit,\nwhich might be heuristic to understand the origin of the reentrant behavior\nnear the Chern-Simons limit.\n", "  X-ray absorption spectroscopy measured at the $L$-edge of transition metals\n(TMs) is a powerful element-selective tool providing direct information about\nthe correlation effects in the $3d$ states. The theoretical modeling of the\n$2p\\rightarrow3d$ excitation processes remains to be challenging for\ncontemporary \\textit{ab initio} electronic structure techniques, due to strong\ncore-hole and multiplet effects influencing the spectra. In this work we\npresent a realization of the method combining the density-functional theory\nwith multiplet ligand field theory, proposed in Haverkort et al.\n(https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.165113), Phys. Rev. B 85, 165113\n(2012). In this approach a single-impurity Anderson model (SIAM) is\nconstructed, with almost all parameters obtained from first principles, and\nthen solved to obtain the spectra. In our implementation we adopt the language\nof the dynamical mean-field theory and utilize the local density of states and\nthe hybridization function, projected onto TM $3d$ states, in order to\nconstruct the SIAM. The developed computational scheme is applied to calculate\nthe $L$-edge spectra for several TM monoxides. A very good agreement between\nthe theory and experiment is found for all studied systems. The effect of\ncore-hole relaxation, hybridization discretization, possible extensions of the\nmethod as well as its limitations are discussed.\n", "  The distance between two point light sources is difficult to estimate if that\ndistance is below the diffraction (Rayleigh's) resolution limit of the imaging\ndevice. A recently proposed technique enhances the precision of this estimation\nby exploiting the source-separation-dependent coupling of light into\nhigher-order $\\rm{TEM}$ modes, particularly the $\\rm{TEM}_{01}$ mode of the\nimage. We theoretically analyze the estimation of the source separation by\nmeans of homodyne or heterodyne detection with a local oscillator in the\n$\\rm{TEM}_{01}$ mode, which is maximally sensitive to the separation in the\nsub-Rayleigh regime. We calculate the per-photon Fisher information associated\nwith this estimation and compare it with direct imaging. For thermal sources,\nthe per-photon Fisher information depends on the average photon number per\nthermal mode of the image; it surpasses the Fisher information for direct\nimaging (in the interesting sub-Rayleigh regime) when the average photon number\nexceeds two for homodyne detection and four for heterodyne detection.\n", "  We investigate the thickness-dependent electronic structure of ultrathin\nSrIrO$_3$ and discover a transition from a semimetallic to a correlated\ninsulating state below 4 unit cells. Low-temperature magnetoconductance\nmeasurements show that spin fluctuations in the semimetallic state are\nsignificantly enhanced while approaching the transition point. The electronic\nstructure is further studied by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, showing that 4\nunit cells SrIrO$_3$ is on the verge of a gap opening. Our density functional\ntheory calculations reproduce the critical thickness of the transition and show\nthat the opening of a gap in ultrathin SrIrO$_3$ is accompanied by\nantiferromagnetic order.\n", "  We study the stability of the electroweak vacuum in low-scale inflation\nmodels whose Hubble parameter is much smaller than the instability scale of the\nHiggs potential. In general, couplings between the inflaton and Higgs are\npresent, and hence we study effects of these couplings during and after\ninflation. We derive constraints on the couplings between the inflaton and\nHiggs by requiring that they do not lead to catastrophic electroweak vacuum\ndecay, in particular, via resonant production of the Higgs particles.\n", "  A vector field is called a Beltrami vector field, if $B\\times(\\nabla\\times\nB)=0$. In this paper we construct two unique Beltrami vector fields\n$\\mathfrak{I}$ and $\\mathfrak{Y}$, such that\n$\\nabla\\times\\mathfrak{I}=\\mathfrak{I}$,\n$\\nabla\\times\\mathfrak{Y}=\\mathfrak{Y}$, and such that both have an\norientation-preserving icosahedral symmetry. Both of them have an additional\nsymmetry with respect to a non-trivial automorphism of the number field\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\,\\sqrt{5}\\,)$.\n", "  Upon reduction of the film thickness we observe a metal-insulator transition\nin epitaxially stabilized, spin-orbit coupled SrIrO$_3$ ultrathin films. By\ncomparison of the experimental electronic dispersions with density functional\ntheory at various levels of complexity we identify the leading microscopic\nmechanisms, i.e., a dimensionality-induced re-adjustment of octahedral\nrotations, magnetism, and electronic correlations. The astonishing resemblance\nof the band structure in the two-dimensional limit to that of bulk\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$ opens new avenues to unconventional superconductivity by \"clean\"\nelectron doping through electric field gating.\n", "  In this work maximum entropy distributions in the space of steady states of\nmetabolic networks are defined upon constraining the first and second moment of\nthe growth rate. Inherent bistability of fast and slow phenotypes, akin to a\nVan-Der Waals picture, emerges upon considering control on the average growth\n(optimization/repression) and its fluctuations (heterogeneity). This is applied\nto the carbon catabolic core of E.coli where it agrees with some stylized facts\non the persisters phenotype and it provides a quantitative map with metabolic\nfluxes, opening for the possibility to detect coexistence from flux data.\nPreliminary analysis on data for E.Coli cultures in standard conditions shows,\non the other hand, degeneracy for the inferred parameters that extend in the\ncoexistence region.\n", "  Quasiparticle excitations in FeSe were studied by means of specific heat\n($C$) measurements on a high-quality single crystal under rotating magnetic\nfields. The field dependence of $C$ shows three-stage behavior with different\nslopes, indicating the existence of three gaps ($\\Delta_1$, $\\Delta_2$, and\n$\\Delta_3$). In the low-temperature and low-field region, the azimuthal-angle\n($\\phi$) dependence of $C$ shows a four-fold symmetric oscillation with sign\nchange. On the other hand, the polar-angle ($\\theta$) dependence manifests as\nan anisotropy-inverted two-fold symmetry with unusual shoulder behavior.\nCombining the angle-resolved results and the theoretical calculation, the\nsmaller gap $\\Delta_1$ is proved to have two vertical-line nodes or gap minima\nalong the $k_z$ direction, and is determined to reside on the electron-type\n$\\varepsilon$ band. $\\Delta_2$ is found to be related to the electron-type\n$\\delta$ band, and is isotropic in the $ab$-plane but largely anisotropic out\nof the plane. $\\Delta_3$ residing on the hole-type $\\alpha$ band shows a small\nout-of-plane anisotropy with a strong Pauli-paramagnetic effect.\n", "  There are many geometric calibration methods for \"standard\" cameras. These\nmethods, however, cannot be used for the calibration of telescopes with large\nfocal lengths and complex off-axis optics. Moreover, specialized calibration\nmethods for the telescopes are scarce in literature. We describe the\ncalibration method that we developed for the Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging\nSystem (CaSSIS) telescope, on board of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).\nAlthough our method is described in the context of CaSSIS, with camera-specific\nexperiments, it is general and can be applied to other telescopes. We further\nencourage re-use of the proposed method by making our calibration code and data\navailable on-line.\n", "  Ballistic point contact (BPC) with zigzag edges in graphene is a main\ncandidate of a valley filter, in which the polarization of the valley degree of\nfreedom can be selected by using a local gate voltage. Here, we propose to\ndetect the valley filtering effect by Andreev reflection. Because electrons in\nthe lowest conduction band and the highest valence band of the BPC possess\nopposite chirality, the inter-band Andreev reflection is strongly suppressed,\nafter multiple scattering and interference. We draw this conclusion by both the\nscattering matrix analysis and the numerical simulation. The Andreev reflection\nas a function of the incident energy of electrons and the local gate voltage at\nthe BPC is obtained, by which the parameter region for a perfect valley filter\nand the direction of valley polarization can be determined. The Andreev\nreflection exhibits an oscillatory decay with the length of the BPC, indicating\na negative correlation to valley polarization.\n", "  We show that the dynamics of the Higgs field during inflation is not affected\nby metric fluctuations if the Higgs is an energetically subdominant light\nspectator. For Standard Model parameters we find that couplings between Higgs\nand metric fluctuations are suppressed by $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$. They are\nnegligible compared to both pure Higgs terms in the effective potential and the\nunavoidable non-minimal Higgs coupling to background scalar curvature. The\nquestion of the electroweak vacuum instability during high energy scale\ninflation can therefore be studied consistently using the Jordan frame action\nin a Friedmann--Lema\\^itre--Robertson--Walker metric, where the Higgs-curvature\ncoupling enters as an effective mass contribution. Similar results apply for\nother light spectator scalar fields during inflation.\n", "  We report theoretical and experimental work on the development of a Josephson\nvortex qubit based on a confocal annular Josephson tunnel junction (CAJTJ). The\nkey ingredient of this geometrical configuration is a periodically variable\nwidth that generates a spatial vortex potential with bistable states. This\nintrinsic vortex potential can be tuned by an externally applied magnetic field\nand tilted by a bias current. The two-state system is accurately modeled by a\none-dimensional sine-Gordon like equation by means of which one can numerically\ncalculate both the magnetic field needed to set the vortex in a given state as\nwell as the vortex depinning currents. Experimental data taken at 4.2K on\nhigh-quality Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb CAJTJs with an individual trapped fluxon advocate\nthe presence of a robust and finely tunable double-well potential for which\nreliable manipulation of the vortex state has been classically demonstrated.\nThe vortex is prepared in a given potential by means of an externally applied\nmagnetic field, while the state readout is accomplished by measuring the\nvortex-depinning current in a small magnetic field. Our proof of principle\nexperiment convincingly demonstrates that the proposed vortex qubit based on\nCAJTJs is robust and workable.\n", "  We present measurements of the resonant microwave absorption by the Rydberg\nenergy levels of surface state electrons on the surface of superfluid liquid\nhelium, in the frequency range 165 - 220 GHz. The resonant frequency was\nstrongly temperature dependent from 0.1 to 2 K. The experiments are in\nagreement with recent theoretical calculations of the renormalisation of the\nelectron energy levels due to zero-point and thermal ripplons, analogous to a\ncondensed matter Lamb shift. The temperature-dependent contribution to the\nlinewidth for excitation to the first excited state at 189.6 GHz is compared\nwith other measurements and theoretical predictions.\n", "  The cosmic ray energy distributions contain spectral features, that is narrow\nenergy regions where the slope of the spectrum changes rapidly. The\nidentification and study of these features is of great importance to understand\nthe astrophysical mechanisms of acceleration and propagation that form the\nspectra. In first approximation a spectral feature in often described as a\ndiscontinuous change in slope, however very valuable information is also\ncontained in its width, that is the length of the interval in logarithm of\nenergy where the change in spectral index develops. In this work we discuss the\nbest way to define and parametrize the width a spectral feature, and for\nillustration discuss some of the most prominent known structures.\n", "  We study the shift of the energy levels of electrons on helium surface due to\nthe coupling to the quantum field of surface vibrations. As in quantum\nelectrodynamics, the coupling is known, and it is known to lead to an\nultraviolet divergence of the level shifts. We show that there are diverging\nterms of different nature and use the Bethe-type approach to show that they\ncancel each other, to the leading-order. This resolves the long-standing\ntheoretical controversy and explains the existing experiments. The results\nallow us to study the temperature dependence of the level shift. The\npredictions are in good agreement with the experimental data.\n", "  We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a method to characterize\n\\textit{any} pure spatial qudit of arbitrary dimension $d$, which is based on\nthe classic phase shift interferometry technique. In the proposed scheme a\ntotal of only $4 d$ measurement outcomes are needed, implying a significant\nreduction with respect to the standard schemes for quantum state tomography\nwhich require of the order of $d^2$. By using this technique, we have\nexperimentally reconstructed a large number of states ranging from $d=2$ up to\n$14$ with mean fidelity values higher than $0.97$. For that purpose the qudits\nwere codified in the discretized transverse momentum-position of single\nphotons, once they are sent through an aperture with $d$ slits. We provide an\nexperimental implementation of the method based in a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer, which allows to reduce the number of measurement settings to 4\nsince the $d$ slits can be measured simultaneously. Furthermore, it can be\nadapted to consider the reconstruction of the unknown state from the outcome\nfrequencies of $4d-3$ fixed projectors independently of the encoding or the\nnature of the quantum system, allowing to implement the reconstruction method\nin a general experiment.\n", "  A generalized Heisenberg-Euler formula is given for an Abelian gauge theory\nhaving vector as well as axial vector couplings to a massive fermion. So, the\nformula is applicable to a parity-violating theory. The gauge group is chosen\nto be $U(1)$. The formula is quite similar to that in quantum electrodynamics,\nbut there is a complexity in which one factor (related to spin) is expressed in\nterms of the expectation value. The expectation value is evaluated by the\ncontraction with the one-dimensional propagator in a given background field.\nThe formula affords a basis to the vacuum magnetic birefringence experiment,\nwhich aims to probe the dark sector, where the interactions of the light\nfermions with the gauge fields are not necessarily parity conserving.\n", "  The baryon-acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest is\none of the key probes of the cosmic expansion rate at redshifts z~2.5, well\nbefore dark energy is believed to have become dynamically significant. A key\nadvantage of the BAO as a standard ruler is that it is a sharp feature and\nhence is more robust against broadband systematic effects than other\ncosmological probes. However, if the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest transmission is\nsensitive to the initial streaming velocity of the baryons relative to the dark\nmatter, then the BAO peak position can be shifted. Here we investigate this\nsensitivity using a suite of hydrodynamic simulations of small regions of the\nintergalactic medium with a range of box sizes and physics assumptions; each\nsimulation starts from initial conditions at the kinematic decoupling era\n(z~1059), undergoes a discrete change from neutral gas to ionized gas thermal\nevolution at reionization (z~8), and is finally processed into a Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest transmitted flux cube. Streaming velocities suppress small-scale\nstructure, leading to less violent relaxation after reionization. The changes\nin the gas distribution and temperature-density relation at low redshift are\nmore subtle, due to the convergent temperature evolution in the ionized phase.\nThe change in the BAO scale is estimated to be of the order of 0.12% at z=2.5;\nsome of the major uncertainties and avenues for future improvement are\ndiscussed. The predicted streaming velocity shift would be a subdominant but\nnot negligible effect (of order $0.26\\sigma$) for the upcoming DESI\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest survey, and exceeds the cosmic variance floor. It is\nhoped that this study will motivate additional theoretical work on the\nmagnitude of the BAO shift, both in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest and in other\ntracers of large-scale structure.\n", "  Radiation from accelerating mirrors in a Minkowski spacetime provides\ninsights into the nature of horizons, black holes, and entanglement entropy. We\nintroduce new, simple, symmetric and analytic moving mirror solutions and study\ntheir particle, energy, and entropy production. This includes an asymptotically\nstatic case with finite emission that is the black hole analog of complete\nevaporation. The total energy, total entropy, total particles, and spectrum are\nthe same on both sides of the mirror. We also study its asymptotically\ninertial, drifting analog (which gives a black hole remnant) to explore\ndifferences in finite and infinite production.\n", "  We consider the advection-diffusion transport of tracers in a one-parameter\nfamily of plane periodic flows where the patterns of streamlines feature\nregions of confined circulation in the shape of \"cat's eyes\", separated by\nmeandering jets with ballistic motion inside them. By varying the parameter, we\nproceed from the regular two-dimensional lattice of eddies without jets to the\nsinusoidally modulated shear flow without eddies. When a weak thermal noise is\nadded, i.e. at large P\\'eclet numbers, several intermediate time scales arise,\nwith qualitatively and quantitatively different transport properties: depending\non the parameter of the flow, the initial position of a tracer, and the aging\ntime, motion of the tracers ranges from subdiffusive to super-ballistic.\nExtensive numerical simulations of the aged mean squared displacement for\ndifferent initial conditions are compared to a theory based on a L\\'evy walk\nthat describes the intermediate-time ballistic regime. Interplay of the walk\nprocess with internal circulation dynamics in the trapped state results at\nintermediate time scale in non-monotonic characteristics of aging.\n", "  We exploit the first \\gaia data release to study the properties of the\nGalactic stellar halo as traced by RR Lyrae. We demonstrate that it is possible\nto select a pure sample of RR Lyrae using only photometric information\navailable in the Gaia+2MASS catalogue. The final sample contains about 21600 RR\nLyrae covering an unprecedented fraction ($\\sim60\\%$) of the volume of the\nGalactic inner halo ($\\text{R}<28$ kpc). We study the morphology of the stellar\nhalo by analysing the RR Lyrae distribution with parametric and non-parametric\ntechniques. Taking advantage of the uniform all-sky coverage, we test halo\nmodels more sophisticated than usually considered in the literature, such as\nthose with varying flattening, tilt and/or offset of the halo with respect to\nthe Galactic disc. A consistent picture emerges: the inner halo is well\nreproduced by a smooth distribution of stars settled on triaxial ellipsoids.\nThe minor axis is perpendicular to the Milky Ways disc, while the major axis is\nmisaligned by $\\sim20^{\\circ}$ from the Galactic Y axis. The elongation along\nthe major axis is mild ($\\text{p}=1.27$), and the vertical flattening is shown\nto evolve from a squashed state with $\\text{q}\\approx0.57$ in the centre to a\nmore spherical $\\text{q}\\approx0.75$ at the outer edge of our dataset. The\ndensity slope is well approximated by a single power-law with exponent\n$\\alpha=-2.96$. Within the range probed, we see no significant evidence for a\nchange of the radial density slope, out of the plane tilt or an offset of the\nhalo with respect to the Galaxy's centre.\n", "  Atoms in transversely pumped optical cavities \"self-organize\" by forming a\ndensity wave and emitting superradiantly into the cavity mode(s). For a\nsingle-mode cavity, the properties of this self-organization transition are\nwell characterized both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we explore the\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the presence of two cavity\nmodes---a system that was recently experimentally realized [Leonard \\emph{et\nal.}, \\emph{Nature} {\\bf 543}, 87 (2017)]. We argue that this system can\nexhibit a \"vestigially ordered\" phase in which neither cavity mode exhibits\nsuperradiance but the cavity modes are mutually phase-locked by the atoms. We\nargue that this vestigially ordered phase should generically be present in\nmultimode cavity geometries.\n", "  We generalize the translation invariant tensor-valued Minkowski Functionals\nwhich are defined on two-dimensional flat space to the unit sphere. We apply\nthem to level sets of random fields. The contours enclosing boundaries of level\nsets of random fields give a spatial distribution of random smooth closed\ncurves. We obtain analytic expressions for the ensemble expectation values for\nthe matrix elements of the tensor-valued Minkowski Functionals for isotropic\nGaussian and Rayleigh fields. We elucidate the way in which the elements of the\ntensor Minkowski Functionals encode information about the nature and\nstatistical isotropy (or departure from isotropy) of the field. We then\nimplement our method to compute the tensor-valued Minkowski Functionals\nnumerically and demonstrate how they encode statistical anisotropy and\ndeparture from Gaussianity by applying the method to maps of the Galactic\nforeground emissions from the PLANCK data.\n", "  We present observational analysis of two successive two-sided loop jets\nobserved by the ground-based New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and the\nspace-borne Solar Dynamics Observatory ( SDO). The two successive two-sided\nloop jets manifested similar evolution process and both were associated with\nthe interaction of two small-scale adjacent filamentary threads, magnetic\nemerging and cancellation processes at the jet's source region. High temporal\nand high spatial resolution observations reveal that the two adjacent ends of\nthe two filamentary threads are rooted in opposite magnetic polarities within\nthe source region. The two threads approached to each other, and then an\nobvious brightening patch is observed at the interaction position.\nSubsequently, a pair of hot plasma ejections are observed heading to opposite\ndirections along the paths of the two filamentary threads, and with a typical\nspeed of two-sided loop jets of the order 150 km/s. Close to the end of the\nsecond jet, we report the formation of a bright hot loop structure at the\nsource region, which suggests the formation of new loops during the\ninteraction. Based on the observational results, we propose that the observed\ntwo-sided loop jets are caused by the magnetic reconnection between the two\nadjacent filamentary threads, largely different from the previous scenario that\na two-sided loop jet is generated by magnetic reconnection between an emerging\nbipole and the overlying horizontal magnetic fields.\n", "  The propagation of light beams is well described using the paraxial\napproximation, where field components along the propagation direction are\nusually neglected. For strongly inhomogeneous or shaped light fields, however,\nthis approximation may fail, leading to intriguing variations of the\nlight-matter interaction. This is the case of twisted light having opposite\norbital and spin angular momenta. We compare experimental data for the\nexcitation of a quadrupole transition in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion by\nSchmiegelow et al, Nat.\\ Comm.\\ 7, 12998 (2016), with a complete model where\nlongitudinal components of the electric field are taken into account. Our model\nmatches the experimental data and excludes by 11 standard deviations the\napproximation of complete transverse field. This demonstrates the importance of\nall field components in the interaction of twisted light with matter.\n", "  Heterotic $M$-theory consists of a five-dimensional manifold of the form\n$S^1/\\mathbf{Z}_2 \\times M_{4}$. It has been shown that one of the two orbifold\nplanes, the \"observable\" sector, can have a low energy particle spectrum which\nis precisely the $N=1$ supersymmetric standard model with three right-handed\nneutrino chiral supermultiplets. The other orbifold plane constitutes a\n\"hidden\" sector which, since its communication with the observable sector is\nsuppressed, will be ignored in this paper. However, the finite fifth-dimension\nallows for the existence of three-brane solitons which, in order to render the\nvacuum anomaly free, must appear. That is, heterotic $M$-theory provides a\nnatural framework for brane-world cosmological scenarios coupled to realistic\nparticle physics. The complete worldvolume action of such three-branes is\nunknown. Here, treating these solitons as probe branes, we construct their\nscalar worldvolume Lagrangian as a derivative expansion of the heterotic DBI\naction. In analogy with similar calculations in the $M_{5}$ and $AdS_{5}$\ncontext, this leads to the construction of \"heterotic Galileons\". However,\nrealistic vacua of heterotic $M$-theory are necessarily $N=1$ supersymmetric in\nfour dimensions. Hence, we proceed to supersymmetrize the three-brane\nworldvolume action, first in flat superspace and then extend the results to\n$N=1$ supergravity. Such a worldvolume action may lead to interesting\ncosmology, such as \"bouncing\" universe models, by allowing for the violation of\nthe Null Energy Condition (NEC).\n", "  The distribution of metals in the intra-cluster medium encodes important\ninformation about the enrichment history and formation of galaxy clusters. Here\nwe explore the metal content of clusters in IllustrisTNG - a new suite of\ngalaxy formation simulations building on the Illustris project. Our cluster\nsample contains 20 objects in TNG100 - a ~(100 Mpc)^3 volume simulation with\n2x1820^3 resolution elements, and 370 objects in TNG300 - a ~(300 Mpc)^3 volume\nsimulation with 2x2500^3 resolution elements. The z=0 metallicity profiles\nagree with observations, and the enrichment history is consistent with\nobservational data going beyond z~1, showing nearly no metallicity evolution.\nThe abundance profiles vary only minimally within the cluster samples,\nespecially in the outskirts with a relative scatter of ~15%. The average\nmetallicity profile flattens towards the center, where we find a logarithmic\nslope of -0.1 compared to -0.5 in the outskirts. Cool core clusters have more\ncentrally peaked metallicity profiles (~0.8 solar) compared to non-cool core\nsystems (~0.5 solar), similar to observational trends. Si/Fe and O/Fe radial\nprofiles follow positive gradients. The outer abundance profiles do not evolve\nbelow z~2, whereas the inner profiles flatten towards z=0. More than ~80% of\nthe metals in the intra-cluster medium have been accreted from the\nproto-cluster environment, which has been enriched to ~0.1 solar already at\nz~2. We conclude that the intra-cluster metal distribution is uniform among our\ncluster sample, nearly time-invariant in the outskirts for more than 10 Gyr,\nand forms through a universal enrichment history.\n", "  We analyze scaling relations and evolution histories of galaxy sizes in\nTNG100, part of the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Observational qualitative\ntrends of size with stellar mass, star-formation rate and redshift are\nreproduced, and a quantitative comparison of projected r-band sizes at 0~<z<~2\nshows agreement to much better than 0.25dex. We follow populations of z=0\ngalaxies with a range of masses backwards in time along their main progenitor\nbranches, distinguishing between main-sequence and quenched galaxies. Our main\nfindings are as follows. (i) At M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun, the evolution of the\nmedian main progenitor differs, with quenched galaxies hardly growing in median\nsize before quenching, whereas main-sequence galaxies grow their median size\ncontinuously, thus opening a gap from the progenitors of quenched galaxies.\nThis is partly because the main-sequence high-redshift progenitors of quenched\nz=0 galaxies are drawn from the lower end of the size distribution of the\noverall population of main-sequence high-redshift galaxies. (ii) Quenched\ngalaxies with M_{*,z=0}>~10^{9.5}Msun experience a steep size growth on the\nsize-mass plane after their quenching time, but with the exception of galaxies\nwith M_{*,z=0}>~10^{11}Msun, the size growth after quenching is small in\nabsolute terms, such that most of the size (and mass) growth of quenched\ngalaxies (and its variation among them) occurs while they are still on the\nmain-sequence. After they become quenched, the size growth rate of quenched\ngalaxies as a function of time, as opposed to versus mass, is similar to that\nof main-sequence galaxies. Hence, the size gap is retained down to z=0.\n", "  We present the spectral/timing properties of the bare Seyfert galaxy Ark 120\nthrough a deep ~420ks XMM-Newton campaign plus recent NuSTAR observations and a\n~6-month Swift monitoring campaign. We investigate the spectral decomposition\nthrough fractional rms, covariance and difference spectra, finding the mid- to\nlong-timescale (~day-year) variability to be dominated by a relatively smooth,\nsteep component, peaking in the soft X-ray band. Additionally, we find evidence\nfor variable FeK emission red-ward of the FeK-alpha core on long timescales,\nconsistent with previous findings. We detect a clearly-defined power spectrum\nwhich we model with a power law with a slope of alpha ~ 1.9. By extending the\npower spectrum to lower frequencies through the inclusion of Swift and RXTE\ndata, we find tentative evidence of a high-frequency break, consistent with\nexisting scaling relations. We also explore frequency-dependent Fourier time\nlags, detecting a negative ('soft') lag for the first time in this source with\nthe 0.3-1 keV band lagging behind the 1-4 keV band with a time delay of ~900s.\nFinally, we analyze the variability in the optical and UV bands using the\nOptical/UV Monitor on-board XMM-Newton and the UVOT on-board Swift and search\nfor time-dependent correlations between the optical/UV/X-ray bands. We find\ntentative evidence for the U-band emission lagging behind the X-rays with a\ntime delay of 2.4 +/- 1.8 days, which we discuss in the context of disc\nreprocessing.\n", "  The measurement of azimuthal correlations of charged particles is presented\nfor Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 2.76 TeV and p-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider. These correlations are measured for the second, third and fourth\norder flow vector in the pseudorapidity region $|\\eta|<0.8$ as a function of\ncentrality and transverse momentum $p_{\\rm T}$ using two observables, to search\nfor evidence of $p_{\\rm T}$-dependent flow vector fluctuations. For Pb-Pb\ncollisions at 2.76 TeV, the measurements indicate that $p_{\\rm T}$-dependent\nfluctuations are only present for the second order flow vector. Similar results\nhave been found for p-Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. These measurements are\ncompared to hydrodynamic model calculations with event-by-event geometry\nfluctuations in the initial state to constrain the initial conditions and\ntransport properties of the matter created in Pb-Pb and p-Pb collisions.\n", "  We compute the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to the\nhadronic decay rates of the pseudoscalar quarkonia, at the lowest order in\nvelocity expansion. The validity of NRQCD factorization for inclusive\nquarkonium decay process, for the first time, is verified to relative order\n$\\alpha_s^2$. As a byproduct, the renormalization group equation (RGE) of the\nleading NRQCD 4-fermion operator ${\\cal O}_1({}^1S_0)$ is also deduced to this\nperturbative order. By incorporating this new piece of correction together with\navailable relativistic corrections, we find that there exists severe tension\nbetween the state-of-the-art NRQCD predictions and the measured $\\eta_c$\nhadronic width, and in particular the branching fraction of $\\eta_c\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$. NRQCD appears to be capable of accounting for $\\eta_b$ hadronic\ndecay to a satisfactory degree, and our most refined prediction is ${\\rm\nBr}(\\eta_b\\to \\gamma\\gamma) = (4.8\\pm 0.7)\\times 10^{-5}$.\n", "  Aims: We predict the exoplanet yield of a space-based mid-infrared nulling\ninterferometer using Monte Carlo simulations. We quantify the number and\nproperties of detectable exoplanets and identify those target stars that have\nthe highest or most complete detection rate. We investigate how changes in the\nunderlying technical assumptions and uncertainties in the underlying planet\npopulation impact the scientific return. Methods: We simulated $2'000$\nexoplanetary systems, based on planet occurrence statistics from Kepler with\nrandomly orientated orbits and uniformly distributed albedos around each of\n$326$ nearby ($d < 20~\\text{pc}$) stars. Assuming thermal equilibrium and\nblackbody emission, together with the limiting spatial resolution and\nsensitivity of our simulated instrument in the three specific bands $5.6$,\n$10.0$, and $15.0~\\mu\\text{m}$, we quantified the number of detectable\nexoplanets as a function of their radii and equilibrium temperatures. Results:\nApproximately $\\sim315_{-77}^{+113}$ exoplanets, with radii $0.5~R_\\text{Earth}\n\\leq R_\\text{p} \\leq 6~R_\\text{Earth}$, were detected in at least one band and\nhalf were detected in all three bands during $\\sim0.52$ years of mission time\nassuming throughputs $3.5$ times worse than those for the James Webb Space\nTelescope and $\\sim40\\%$ overheads. Accounting for stellar leakage and\n(unknown) exozodiacal light, the discovery phase of the mission very likely\nrequires $2$ - $3$ years in total. Roughly $85$ planets could be habitable\n($0.5~R_\\text{Earth} \\leq R_\\text{p} \\leq 1.75~R_\\text{Earth}$ and\n$200~\\text{K} \\leq T_\\text{eq} \\leq 450~\\text{K}$) and are prime targets for\nspectroscopic observations in a second mission phase.\n", "  Using a sample of $447.9\\times 10^6$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with the\nBESIII detector in 2009 and 2012, we study the decays $\\chi_{c0,2}\\to$\n$\\eta'\\eta'$ and $\\eta\\eta'$. The decays $\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta'\\eta'$,\n$\\chi_{c0}\\to\\eta\\eta'$ and $\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta\\eta'$ are observed for the first\ntime with statistical significances of $9.6\\sigma$, $13.4\\sigma$ and\n$7.5\\sigma$, respectively. The branching fractions are determined to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0}\\to\\eta'\\eta') =(2.19\\pm0.03\\pm0.14)\\times10^{-3}$,\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta'\\eta') = (4.76\\pm0.56\\pm0.38)\\times10^{-5}$,\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0}\\to\\eta\\eta') = (8.92\\pm0.84\\pm0.65)\\times10^{-5}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c2}\\to\\eta\\eta') = (2.27\\pm0.43\\pm0.25)\\times10^{-5}$, where\nthe first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The\nprecision for the measurement of $\\mathcal{B}(\\chi_{c0}\\to\\eta'\\eta')$ is\nsignificantly improved compared to previous measurements. Based on the measured\nbranching fractions, the role played by the doubly and singly\nOkubo-Zweig-Iizuka disconnected transition amplitudes for $\\chi_{c0,2}$ decays\ninto pseudoscalar meson pairs can be clarified.\n", "  We carried out the comparative study of the signal from the decay of double\n$K$-shell vacancy production that follows after single $K$-shell electron\ncapture of $^{81}$Kr and double $K$-shell electron capture of $^{78}$Kr. The\nradiative decay of a the double $1s$ vacancy state was identified by detecting\nthe triple coincidence of two $K$ X-rays and several Auger electrons in the\n$ECEC$-decay, or by detecting two $K$ X-rays and (Auger electrons + ejected\n$K$-shell electron) in the $EC$ decay. The number of $K$-shell vacancies per\nthe $K$-electron capture, produced as a result of the shake-off process, has\nbeen measured for the decay of $^{81}$Kr. The probability for this decay was\nfound to be $P_{KK}=(5.7\\pm0.8)\\times10^{-5}$ with a systematic error of\n$(\\Delta P_{KK})_{syst}=\\pm0.4 \\times10^{-5}$. For the $^{78}{\\rm{Kr}}(2\\nu2K)$\ndecay, the comparative study of single- and double-capture decays allowed us to\nobtain the signal-to-background ratio to be 15/1. The half-life\n$T_{1/2}^{2\\nu2K}(g.s. \\rightarrow g.s.) =\n[1.9^{+1.3}_{-0.7}(stat)\\pm0.3(syst)]\\times 10^{22}$ y is determined from the\nanalysis of data that have been accumulated over 782 days of live measurements\nin the experiment that used samples consisted of 170.6 g of $^{78}$Kr.\n", "  The transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) spectra and elliptic flow coefficient\n($v_2$) of deuterons and anti-deuterons at mid-rapidity ($|y|<0.5$) are\nmeasured with the ALICE detector at the LHC in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV. The measurement of the $p_{\\rm T}$ spectra of\n(anti-)deuterons is done up to 8 GeV/$c$ in 0-10% centrality class and up to\nGeV/$c$ in 10-20% and 20-40% centrality classes. The $v_2$ is measured in the\n$0.8 <p_{\\rm T} <5$ GeV/$c$ interval and in six different centrality intervals\n(0-5%, 5-10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40% and 40-50%) using the scalar product\ntechnique. Measured $\\pi^{\\pm}$, K$^{\\pm}$ and p+$\\overline{\\mathrm{p}}$\ntransverse-momentum spectra and $v_2$ are used to predict the deuteron $p_{\\rm\nT}$ spectra and $v_2$ within the Blast-Wave model. The predictions are able to\nreproduce the $v_2$ coefficient in the measured $p_{\\rm T}$ range and the\ntransverse-momentum spectra for $p_{\\rm T}>1.8$ GeV/$c$ within the experimental\nuncertainties. The measurement of the coalescence parameter $B_2$ is performed,\nshowing a $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence in contrast with the simplest coalescence\nmodel, which fails to reproduce also the measured $v_2$ coefficient. In\naddition, the coalescence parameter $B_2$ and the elliptic flow coefficient in\nthe 20-40% centrality interval are compared with the AMPT model which is able,\nin its version without string melting, to reproduce the measured $v_2$($p_{\\rm\nT}$) and the $B_2$($p_{\\rm T}$) trend.\n", "  In this work we study the imprints of bubble nucleation on primordial\ninflationary perturbations. We assume that the bubble is formed via the\ntunneling of a spectator field from the false vacuum of its potential to its\ntrue vacuum. We consider the configuration in which the observable CMB sphere\nis initially outside of the bubble. As the bubble expands, more and more\nregions of the exterior false vacuum, including our CMB sphere, fall into the\ninterior of the bubble. The modes which leave the horizon during inflation at\nthe time when the bubble wall collides with the observable CMB sphere are\naffected the most. The bubble wall induces non-trivial anisotropic and scale\ndependent corrections in the two point function of the curvature perturbation.\nThe corrections in the curvature perturbation and the diagonal and off-diagonal\nelements of CMB power spectrum are estimated.\n", "  Many statistical properties of X-ray aperiodic variability from accreting\ncompact objects can be explained by the propagating fluctuations model applied\nto the accretion disc. The mass accretion rate fluctuations originate from\nvariability of viscosity, which arises at every radius and causes local\nfluctuations of the density. The fluctuations diffuse through the disc and\nresult in local variability of the mass accretion rate, which modulates the\nX-ray flux from the inner disc in the case of black holes, or from the surface\nin the case of neutron stars. A key role in the theoretical explanation of fast\nvariability belongs to the description of the diffusion process. The\npropagation and evolution of the fluctuations is described by the diffusion\nequation, which can be solved by the method of Green functions. We implement\nGreen functions in order to accurately describe the propagation of fluctuations\nin the disc. For the first time we consider both forward and backward\npropagation. We show that (i) viscous diffusion efficiently suppress\nvariability at time scales shorter than the viscous time, (ii) local\nfluctuations of viscosity affect the mass accretion rate variability both in\nthe inner and the outer parts of accretion disc, (iii) propagating fluctuations\ngive rise not only to hard time lags as previously shown, but also produce soft\nlags at high frequency similar to those routinely attributed to reprocessing,\n(iv) deviation from the linear rms-flux relation is predicted for the case of\nvery large initial perturbations. Our model naturally predicts bumpy power\nspectra.\n", "  We discuss the possibility of obtaining Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) from the\ninterior of supernovae, in particular SN 1986J. Young neutron stars are\ninvolved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has\nbeen suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be\nproduced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using\nVLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact\ncomponent not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the\nfirst time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr\nold) supernova. We show that at age 30 yr, any FRB signal at ~1 GHz would still\nbe largely absorbed by the ejecta. By the time the ejecta have expanded so that\na 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN\nejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion\nmeasures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to\npropagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at\ndistances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc. We conclude that\nif FRBs originate in Type II SNe/SNRs, they would likely not become visible\ntill 60 ~ 200 yr after the SN explosion.\n", "  We present a technique that permits the analysis of stellar population\ngradients in a relatively low cost way compared to IFU surveys analyzing a\nvastly larger samples as well as out to larger radii. We developed a technique\nto analyze unresolved stellar populations of spatially resolved galaxies based\non photometric multi-filter surveys. We derived spatially resolved stellar\npopulation properties and radial gradients by applying a Centroidal Voronoi\nTesselation and performing a multi-color photometry SED fitting. This technique\nhas been applied to a sample of 29 massive (M$_{\\star}$ > 10$^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$), early-type galaxies at $z$ < 0.3 from the ALHAMBRA survey. We\nproduced detailed 2D maps of stellar population properties (age, metallicity\nand extinction). Radial structures have been studied and luminosity-weighted\nand mass-weighted gradients have been derived out to 2 - 3.5 R$_\\mathrm{eff}$.\nWe find the gradients of early-type galaxies to be on average flat in age\n($\\nabla$log Age$_\\mathrm{L}$ = 0.02 $\\pm$ 0.06 dex/R$_\\mathrm{eff})$ and\nnegative in metallicity ($\\nabla$[Fe/H]$_\\mathrm{L}$ = - 0.09 $\\pm$ 0.06\ndex/R$_\\mathrm{eff}$). Overall, the extinction gradients are flat\n($\\nabla$A$_\\mathrm{v}$ = - 0.03 $\\pm$ 0.09 mag/R$_\\mathrm{eff}$ ) with a wide\nspread. These results are in agreement with previous studies that used standard\nlong-slit spectroscopy as well as with the most recent integral field unit\n(IFU) studies. According to recent simulations, these results are consistent\nwith a scenario where early-type galaxies were formed through major mergers and\nwhere their final gradients are driven by the older ages and higher metallicity\nof the accreted systems. We demonstrate the scientific potential of\nmulti-filter photometry to explore the spatially resolved stellar populations\nof local galaxies and confirm previous spectroscopic trends from a\ncomplementary technique.\n", "  In the framework of the one-boson-exchange model, we explore whether the\nintermediate and short-range forces from $\\sigma/\\omega$-exchange can be strong\nenough to bind heavy molecular states. $\\Lambda_cD(\\bar{D})$, and\n$\\Lambda_c\\Lambda_c(\\bar{\\Lambda}_c)$ systems have been studied and compared.\nWe find that the force from $\\sigma$-exchange is attractive and dominant,\nwhereas the $\\omega$-exchange force not. As a consequence, the S-wave\n$\\Lambda_cD$, $\\Lambda_c\\Lambda_c$, and $\\Lambda_c\\bar{\\Lambda}_c$ can be\npossible molecular candidates. We further indicate that one hadron-hadron\nsystem with more light quarks $(u,d)$ can be easier to form a bound state. As a\nbyproduct, by studying the heavy-quark mass dependence for the\n$\\Lambda_cD(\\bar{D})$-like and $\\Lambda_c\\Lambda_c(\\bar{\\Lambda}_c)$-like\nsystems, we find that the charm/bottom sector can easily accommodates molecular\nstates. Finally, the $\\Lambda_cN(\\bar{N})$ and $\\Lambda_bN(\\bar{N})$ systems\nare investigated. Our results indicate that they are also likely to form bound\nstates. By including one-$\\pi$-exchange forces providing additional attraction\nwhen coupled channels are included, we expect many molecular states in heavy\nquark sectors.\n", "  Nanostructures have the immense potential to supplant the traditional\nmetallic structure as they show enhanced mechanical properties through strain\nhardening. In this paper, the effect of grain size on the hardening mechanism\nof Al-Cu nanostructure is elucidated by molecular dynamics simulation. Al-Cu\n(50-54% Cu by weight) nanostructure having an average grain size of 4.57 to\n7.26 nm are investigated for tensile simulation at different strain rate using\nembedded atom method (EAM) potential at a temperature of 50~500K. It is found\nthat the failure mechanism of the nanostructure is governed by the temperature,\ngrain size as well as strain rate effect. At the high temperature of 300-500K,\nthe failure strength of Al-Cu nanostructure increases with the decrease of\naverage grain size following Hall-Petch relation. Dislocation motions are\nhindered significantly when the grain size is decreased which play a vital role\non the hardening of the nanostructure. The failure is always found to initiate\nat a particular Al grain due to its weak link and propagates through grain\nboundary (GB) sliding, diffusion, dislocation nucleation and propagation. We\nalso visualize the dislocation density at different grain size to show how the\ndislocation affects the material properties at the nanoscale. These results\nwill further aid investigation on the deformation mechanism of nanostructure.\n", "  We study the ladder operator on scalar fields, mapping a solution of the\nKlein-Gordon equation onto another solution with a different mass, when the\noperator is at most first order in derivatives. Imposing the commutation\nrelation between the d'Alembertian, we obtain the general condition for the\nladder operator, which contains a non-trivial case which was not discussed in\nthe previous work [V. Cardoso, T. Houri and M. Kimura, Phys.Rev.D 96, 024044\n(2017), arXiv:1706.07339]. We also discuss the relation with supersymmetric\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  Exomoons represent an outstanding challenge in modern astronomy, with the\npotential to provide rich insights into planet formation theory and\nhabitability. In this work, we stack the phase-folded transits of 284 viable\nmoon hosting Kepler planetary candidates, in order to search for satellites.\nThese planets range from Earth-to-Jupiter sized and from ${\\sim}$0.1-to-1.0 AU\nin separation - so-called \"warm\" planets. Our data processing includes two-pass\nharmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection and careful\ndata quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with an r.m.s. of 5.1 ppm.\nWe find that the occurrence rate of Galilean-analog moon systems for planets\norbiting between ${\\sim}$0.1 and 1.0 AU can be constrained to be $\\eta<0.38$ to\n95% confidence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3% confidence interval of\n$\\eta=0.16_{-0.10}^{+0.13}$. A single-moon model of variable size and\nseparation locates a slight preference for a population of short-period moons\nwith radii ${\\sim}0.5$ $R_{\\oplus}$ orbiting at 5-10 planetary radii. However,\nwe stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be\ntreated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various\nphysically-motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of\nGalilean-analogs around warm planets places the first strong constraint on\nexomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon\ncandidate Kepler-1625b I, which we briefly describe ahead of scheduled\nobservations of the target with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n", "  We study the robustness of non-local string order in two paradigmatic\ndisordered spin-chain models, a spin-1/2 cluster-Ising and a spin-1 XXZ\nHeisenberg chain. In the clean case, they both display a transition from\nantiferromagnetic to string order. Applying a disorder which preserves the\nHamiltonian symmetries, we find that the transition persists in both models. In\nthe disordered cluster-Ising model we can study the transition analytically --\nby applying the strongest coupling renormalization group -- and numerically --\nby exploiting integrability to study the antiferromagnetic and string order\nparameters. We map the model into a quadratic fermion chain, where the\ntransition appears as a change in the number of zero-energy edge modes. We also\nexplore its zero-temperature-singularity behavior and find a transition from a\nnon-singular to a singular region, at a point that is different from the one\nseparating non-local and local ordering.} The disordered Heisenberg chain can\nbe treated only numerically: by means of MPS-based simulations, we are able to\nlocate the existence of a transition between antiferromagnetic and\nstring-ordered phase, through the study of order parameters. Finally we discuss\npossible connections of our findings with many body localization.\n", "  The relaxion mechanism provides a potentially elegant solution to the\nhierarchy problem without resorting to anthropic or other fine-tuning\narguments. This mechanism introduces an axion-like field, dubbed the relaxion,\nwhose expectation value determines the electroweak hierarchy as well as the QCD\nstrong CP violating $\\bar{\\theta}$ parameter. During an inflationary period,\nthe Higgs mass squared is selected to be negative and hierarchically small in a\ntheory which is consistent with 't Hooft's technical naturalness criteria.\nHowever, in the original model proposed by Graham, Kaplan and Rajendran (2015),\nthe relaxion does not solve the strong CP problem, and in fact contributes to\nit, as the coupling of the relaxion to the Higgs field and the introduction of\na linear potential for the relaxion produces large strong CP violation. We\nresolve this tension by considering inflation with a Hubble scale which is\nabove the QCD scale but below the weak scale, and estimating the Hubble\ntemperature dependence of the axion mass. The relaxion potential is thus very\ndifferent during inflation than it is today. We find that provided the\ninflationary Hubble scale is between the weak scale and about 3 GeV, the\nrelaxion resolves the hierarchy, strong CP, and dark matter problems in a way\nthat is technically natural.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the finite-temperature Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(KT) and vortex-antivortex lattice (VAL) melting transitions in two-dimensional\nFermi gases with $p$- or $d$-wave pairing. For both pairings, when the\ninteraction is tuned from weak to strong attractions, we observe a quantum\nphase transition from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity to the\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of difermions. The KT and VAL transition\ntemperatures increase during this BCS-BEC transition and approach constant\nvalues in the deep BEC region. The BCS-BEC transition is characterized by the\nnon-analyticities of the chemical potential, the superfluid order parameter,\nand the sound velocities as functions of the interaction strength at both zero\nand finite temperatures; however, the temperature effect tends to weaken the\nnon-analyticities comparing to the zero temperature case. The effect of\nmismatched Fermi surfaces on the $d$-wave pairing is also studied.\n", "  We use the Cluster-EAGLE simulations to explore the velocity bias introduced\nwhen using galaxies, rather than dark matter particles, to estimate the\nvelocity dispersion of a galaxy cluster, a property known to be tightly\ncorrelated with cluster mass. The simulations consist of 30 clusters spanning a\nmass range $14.0 \\le \\log_{10}(M_{\\rm 200c}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot}) \\le 15.4$, with\ntheir sophisticated sub-grid physics modelling and high numerical resolution\n(sub-kpc gravitational softening) making them ideal for this purpose. We find\nthat selecting galaxies by their total mass results in a velocity dispersion\nthat is 5-10 per cent higher than the dark matter particles. However, selecting\ngalaxies by their stellar mass results in an almost unbiased ($<5$ per cent)\nestimator of the velocity dispersion. This result holds out to $z=1.5$ and is\nrelatively insensitive to the choice of cluster aperture, varying by less than\n5 per cent between $r_{\\rm 500c}$ and $r_{\\rm 200m}$. We show that the velocity\nbias is a function of the time spent by a galaxy inside the cluster\nenvironment. Selecting galaxies by their total mass results in a larger bias\nbecause a larger fraction of objects have only recently entered the cluster and\nthese have a velocity bias above unity. Galaxies that entered more than $4 \\,\n\\mathrm{Gyr}$ ago become progressively colder with time, as expected from\ndynamical friction. We conclude that velocity bias should not be a major issue\nwhen estimating cluster masses from kinematic methods.\n", "  We report on the \\nustar{} observation of the Z-type neutron star low-mass\nX-ray binary Cygnus X--2 performed on 7 January 2015. During this observation,\nthe source exhibited sudden decrease in count rate (dips) and stronger\nvariability in $3-79\\kev$ X-ray lightcurve. The hardness-intensity diagram\nshows that the source remained in the so-called \\quotes{normal branch} of the\nZ-track, although an extended \\quotes{flaring branch} is observed during the\ndips. The source was in a soft spectral state with the $3-45\\kev$ luminosity of\n$L\\simeq(0.5-1.1)\\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, assuming a distance of 8 kpc.\nBoth the non-dip and dip X-ray spectra are well represented by models in which\nthe soft band is dominated by the emission from the disc, while the hard X-ray\nband is dominated by the Comptonized emission from the boundary layer/corona\nand its reflected emission from the disc. The X-ray spectrum also revealed a\nbroad Fe K$\\alpha$ emission line which is nearly symmetric at the higher flux\nand asymmetric when the flux is reduced by a factor of $\\sim 2$. The\nrelativistic reflection model predicts the inner radius of the accretion disc\nas $R_{in}\\simeq2.5-6.0\\:R_{ISCO}\\:(\\simeq30-73$ Km) for the non-dip state and\n$R_{in}\\simeq2.0-2.6\\:R_{ISCO}\\:(\\simeq24-32$ Km) for the dip state. If the\ninner disc is truncated due to the pressure arising from a magnetic field, this\nimplies an upper limit of the magnetic field strength of $\\leq7.6\\times10^{9}$\nG at the magnetic poles which is consistent with other estimates.\n", "  We propose a quantum heat engine composed of two superconducting transmission\nline resonators interacting with each other via an optomechanical-like\ncoupling. One resonator is periodically excited by a thermal pump. The\nincoherently driven resonator induces coherent oscillations in the other one\ndue to the coupling. A limit cycle, indicating finite power output, emerges in\nthe thermodynamical phase space. The system implements an all-electrical analog\nof a photonic piston. Instead of mechanical motion, the power output is\nobtained as a coherent electrical charging in our case. We explore the\ndifferences between the quantum and classical descriptions of our system by\nsolving the quantum master equation and classical Langevin equations.\nSpecifically, we calculate the mean number of excitations, second-order\ncoherence, as well as the entropy, temperature, power and mean energy to reveal\nthe signatures of quantum behavior in the statistical and thermodynamic\nproperties of the system. We find evidence of a quantum enhancement in the\npower output of the engine at low temperatures.\n", "  Recently, Su et al. (2016) propose a telescope design, referred as the \"SYZ\"\ndesign, for Chinese new project of a 12m optical-infrared telescope. The SYZ\ntelescope design consists of three aspheric mirrors with non-zero power,\nincluding a relay mirror below the primary mirror. SYZ design yields a good\nimaging quality and has a relatively flat field curvature at Nasmyth focus. To\nevaluate the science-compatibility of this three-mirror telescope, in this\npaper, we thoroughly compare the performance of SYZ design with that of\nRitchey-Chr\\'etien (RC) design, a conventional two-mirror telescope design.\nFurther, we propose the Observing Information Throughput ($OIT$) as a metric\nfor quantitatively evaluating the telescopes' science performance. We find that\nalthough a SYZ telescope yields a superb imaging quality over a large field of\nview, a two-mirror (RC) telescope design holds a higher overall throughput, a\nbetter diffraction-limited imaging quality in the central field of view\n(FOV$<5'$) which is better for the performance of extreme Adaptive Optics (AO),\nand a generally better scientific performance with a higher $OIT$ value.\n", "  Euclidean two-point correlators of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) in SU(3)\ngauge theory on the lattice are studied on the basis of the Yang-Mills gradient\nflow. The entropy density and the specific heat obtained from the two-point\ncorrelators are shown to be in good agreement with those from the one-point\nfunctions of EMT. These results constitute a first step toward the first\nprinciple simulations of the transport coefficients with the gradient flow.\n", "  We extend some solutions for black holes in the Randall-Sundrum theory with a\nsingle brane. We consider a generalised version of the extremal black hole on\nthe brane in n + 1 dimensions and determine an asymptotic value of the geometry\nfor large black holes.\n", "  We report a novel spin injection and detection mechanism via the anomalous\nHall effect in a ferromagnetic metal. The anomalous spin Hall effect (ASHE)\nrefers to the transverse spin current generated within the ferromagnet. We\nutilize the ASHE and its reciprocal effect to electrically inject and detect\nmagnons in a magnetic insulator in a non-local geometry. Our experiments reveal\nthat permalloy can have a higher spin injection and detection efficiency to\nthat of platinum, owing to the ASHE. We also demonstrate the tunability of the\nASHE via the orientation of the permalloy magnetization, thus creating new\npossibilities for spintronic applications.\n", "  A colossal magnetoresistance ($\\sim 100\\times10^3\\%$) and an extremely large\nmagnetoresistance ($\\sim 1\\times10^6\\%$) have been previously explored in\nmanganite perovskites and Dirac materials, respectively. However, the\nrequirement of an extremely strong magnetic field (and an extremely low\ntemperature) makes them not applicable for realistic devices. In this work, we\npropose a device that can generate even larger changes in resistance in a\nzero-magnetic field and at a high temperature. The device is composed of a\ngraphene under two strips of yttrium iron garnet (YIG), where two gate voltages\nare applied to cancel the heavy charge doping in the YIG-induced half-metallic\nferromagnets. By calculations using the Landauer-B\\\"{u}ttiker formalism, we\ndemonstrate that, when a proper gate voltage is applied on the free\nferromagnet, changes in resistance up to $305\\times10^6\\%$ ($16\\times10^3\\%$)\ncan be achieved at the liquid helium (nitrogen) temperature and in a zero\nmagnetic field. We attribute such a remarkable effect to a gate-induced\nfull-polarization reversal in the free ferromagnet, which results in a\nmetal-state to insulator-state transition in the device. We also find that, the\nproposed effect can be realized in devices using other magnetic insulators such\nas EuO and EuS. Our work should be helpful for developing a realistic switching\ndevice that is energy saving and CMOS-technology compatible.\n", "  A current bottleneck for quantum computation is the realization of\nhigh-fidelity two-qubit quantum operations between two and more quantum bits in\narrays of coupled qubits. Gates based on parametrically driven tunable couplers\noffer a convenient method to entangle multiple qubits by selectively activating\ndifferent interaction terms in the effective Hamiltonian. Here, we study\ntheoretically and experimentally a superconducting qubit setup with two\ntransmon qubits connected via a capacitively coupled tunable bus. We develop a\ntime-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and derive analytic expressions\nfor exchange-interaction gates swapping excitations between the qubits (iSWAP)\nand for two-photon gates creating and annihilating simultaneous two-qubit\nexcitations (bSWAP). We find that the bSWAP gate is generally slower than the\nmore commonly used iSWAP gate, but features favorable scalability properties\nwith less severe frequency crowding effects, which typically degrade the\nfidelity in multi-qubit setups. Our theoretical results are backed by\nexperimental measurements as well as exact numerical simulations including the\neffects of higher transmon levels and dissipation.\n", "  Non-Gaussianities of dynamical origin are disentangled from primordial ones\nusing the formalism of large deviation statistics with spherical collapse\ndynamics. This is achieved by relying on accurate analytical predictions for\nthe one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and the two-point\nclustering of spherically-averaged cosmic densities (sphere bias). Sphere bias\nextends the idea of halo bias to intermediate density environments and voids as\nunderdense regions. In the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity, sphere bias\ndisplays a strong scale dependence relevant for both high and low density\nregions, which is predicted analytically. The statistics of densities in\nspheres are built to model primordial non-Gaussianity via an initial skewness\nwith a scale-dependence that depends on the bispectrum of the underlying model.\nThe analytical formulas with the measured nonlinear dark matter variance as\ninput are successfully tested against numerical simulations. For local\nnon-Gaussianity with a range from $f_{\\rm NL}=-100$ to $+100$ they are found to\nagree within 2\\% or better for densities $\\rho\\in[0.5,3]$ in spheres of radius\n15 Mpc$/h$ down to $z=0.35$. The validity of the large deviation statistics\nformalism is thereby established for all observationally relevant local-type\ndepartures from perfectly Gaussian initial conditions. The corresponding\nestimators for the amplitude of the nonlinear variance $\\sigma_8$ and\nprimordial skewness $f_{\\rm NL}$ are validated using a fiducial joint maximum\nlikelihood experiment. The influence of observational effects and the prospects\nfor a future detection of primordial non-Gaussianity from joint one- and\ntwo-point densities-in-spheres statistics are discussed.\n", "  We present a measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the\ncross-correlation of quasars with the Ly$\\alpha$-forest flux-transmission at a\nmean redshift $z=2.40$. The measurement uses the complete SDSS-III data sample:\n168,889 forests and 234,367 quasars from the SDSS Data Release DR12. In\naddition to the statistical improvement on our previous study using DR11, we\nhave implemented numerous improvements at the analysis level allowing a more\naccurate measurement of this cross-correlation. We also developed the first\nsimulations of the cross-correlation allowing us to test different aspects of\nour data analysis and to search for potential systematic errors in the\ndetermination of the BAO peak position. We measure the two ratios\n$D_{H}(z=2.40)/r_{d} = 9.01 \\pm 0.36$ and $D_{M}(z=2.40)/r_{d} = 35.7 \\pm 1.7$,\nwhere the errors include marginalization over the non-linear velocity of\nquasars and the metal - quasar cross-correlation contribution, among other\neffects. These results are within $1.8\\sigma$ of the prediction of the\nflat-$\\Lambda$CDM model describing the observed CMB anisotropies. We combine\nthis study with the Ly$\\alpha$-forest auto-correlation function\n[2017A&A...603A..12B], yielding $D_{H}(z=2.40)/r_{d} = 8.94 \\pm 0.22$ and\n$D_{M}(z=2.40)/r_{d} = 36.6 \\pm 1.2$, within $2.3\\sigma$ of the same\nflat-$\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  Side-by-side comparison of detailed kinetic models using a new tool to aid\nrecognition of species structures reveals significant discrepancies in the\npublished rates of many reactions and thermochemistry of many species. We\npresent a first automated assessment of the impact of these varying parameters\non observable quantities of interest---in this case, autoignition delay---using\nliterature experimental data. A recent kinetic model for the isomers of butanol\nwas imported into a common database. Individual reaction rate and thermodynamic\nparameters of species were varied using values encountered in combustion models\nfrom recent literature. The effects of over 1600 alternative parameters were\nconsidered. Separately, experimental data were collected from recent\npublications and converted into the standard YAML-based ChemKED format. The\nCantera-based model validation tool, PyTeCK, was used to automatically simulate\nautoignition using the generated models and experimental data, to judge the\nperformance of the models. Taken individually, most of the parameter\nsubstitutions have little effect on the overall model performance, although a\nhandful have quite large effects, and are investigated more thoroughly.\nAdditionally, models varying multiple parameters simultaneously were evolved\nusing a genetic algorithm to give fastest and slowest autoignition delay times,\nshowing that changes exceeding a factor of 10 in ignition delay time are\npossible by cherry-picking from only accepted, published parameters. All data\nand software used in this study are available openly.\n", "  Non-helical tracks are the smoking gun signature of charged and/or colored\nquirks, which are pairs of particles bound by a new, long-range confining\nforce. We propose a method to efficiently search for these non-helical tracks\nat the LHC, without the need to fit their trajectories. We show that the hits\ncorresponding to quirky trajectories can be selected efficiently by searching\nfor co-planar hits in the inner layers of the ATLAS and CMS trackers, even in\nthe presence of on average 50 pile-up vertices. We further argue that\nbackgrounds from photon conversions and unassociated pile-up hits can be\nremoved almost entirely, while maintaining a signal reconstruction efficiency\nas high as 70%. With the 300 fb$^{-1}$ dataset, this implies a discovery\npotential for string tension between 100 eV and 30 keV, and colored\n(electroweak charged) quirks as heavy as 1600 (650) GeV may be discovered.\n", "  A perturbation series solution is constructed in terms of Airy functions for\na nonlinear two-point boundary-value problem arising in an established model of\nsteady electrodiffusion in one dimension, for two ionic species carrying equal\nand opposite charges. The solution includes a formal determination of the\nassociated electric field, which is known to satisfy a form of the Painlev\\'e\nII differential equation. Comparisons with the numerical solution of the\nboundary-value problem show excellent agreement following termination of the\nseries after a sufficient number of terms, for a much wider range of values of\nthe parameters in the model than suggested by previously presented analysis, or\nadmitted by previously presented approximation schemes. These surprising\nresults suggest that for a wide variety of cases, a convergent series expansion\nis obtained in terms of Airy functions for the Painlev\\'e transcendent\ndescribing the electric field. A suitable weighting of error measures for the\napproximations to the field and its first derivative provides a monotonically\ndecreasing overall measure of the error in a subset of these cases. It is\nconjectured that the series does converge for this subset.\n", "  We study the linear and non-linear development of the Kruskal-Schwarzchild\nInstability in a relativisitically expanding striped wind. This instability is\nthe generalization of Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. It has been suggested to produce a self-sustained acceleration mechanism\nin strongly magnetized outflows found in active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray\nbursts, and micro-quasars. The instability leads to magnetic reconnection, but\nin contrast with steady-state Sweet-Parker reconnection, the dissipation rate\nis not limited by the current layer's small aspect ratio. We performed\ntwo-dimensional (2D) relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations\nfeaturing two cold and highly magnetized ($1\\leq\\sigma\\leq10^{3}$) plasma\nlayers with an anti-parallel magnetic field separated by a thin layer of\nrelativistically hot plasma with a local effective gravity induced by the\noutflow's acceleration. Our simulations show how the heavier relativistically\nhot plasma in the reconnecting layer drips out and allows oppositely oriented\nmagnetic field lines to reconnect. The instability's growth rate in the linear\nregime matches the predictions of linear stability analysis. We find turbulence\nrather than an ordered bulk flow near the reconnection region, with turbulent\nvelocities up to $\\sim0.1$c, largely independent of model parameters. However,\nthe magnetic energy dissipation rate is found to be much slower, corresponding\nto an effective ordered bulk velocity inflow into the reconnection region\n$v_{\\rm in}=\\beta_{\\rm in}c$, of $10^{-3}\\lesssim\\beta_{\\rm in}\\lesssim\n5\\times10^{-3}$. This occurs due to the slow evacuation of hot plasma from the\ncurrent layer, largely because of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability experienced\nby the dripping plasma. 3D RMHD simulations are needed to further investigate\nthe non-linear regime.\n", "  The unimodular version of the ghost-free higher derivative gravity is\nobtained. It is the unimodular reduction of some particular lagrangians\nquadratic in curvature.\n", "  We propose a method for stably removing noise from measurements of a quantum\nmany-body system. The question is cast to a linear inverse problem by using a\nquantum Fischer information metric as figure of merit. This requires the\nability to compute the adjoint of the noise channel with respect to the metric,\nwhich can be done analytically when the metric is evaluated at a Gaussian\n(quasi-free) state. This approach can be applied effectively to n-point\nfunctions of a quantum field theory. For translation invariant noise, this\nyields a stable deconvolution method on the first moments of the field which\ndiffers from what one would obtain from a purely classical analysis.\n", "  We present a newly discovered correlation between the wind outflow velocity\nand the X-ray luminosity in the luminous ($L_{\\rm bol}\\sim10^{47}\\,\\rm\nerg\\,s^{-1}$) nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar PDS\\,456. All the contemporary\nXMM-Newton, NuSTAR and Suzaku observations from 2001--2014 were revisited and\nwe find that the centroid energy of the blueshifted Fe\\,K absorption profile\nincreases with luminosity. This translates into a correlation between the wind\noutflow velocity and the hard X-ray luminosity (between 7--30\\,keV) where we\nfind that $v_{\\rm w}/c \\propto L_{7-30}^{\\gamma}$ where $\\gamma=0.22\\pm0.04$.\nWe also show that this is consistent with a wind that is predominately\nradiatively driven, possibly resulting from the high Eddington ratio of\nPDS\\,456.\n", "  We present two different versions of the consistent theory of massive\ngravitons in arbitrary spacetimes which are simple enough for practical\napplications. The theory is described by a non-symmetric rank-2 tensor whose\nequations of motion imply six algebraic and five differential constraints\nreducing the number of independent components to five. The theory reproduces\nthe standard description of massive gravitons in Einstein spaces. In generic\nspacetimes it does not show the massless limit and always propagates five\ndegrees of freedom, even for the vanishing mass parameter. We illustrate these\nfeatures by an explicit calculation for a homogeneous and isotropic\ncosmological background. We find that the gravitons are stable if they are\nsufficiently massive, hence they may be a part of Dark Matter at present. We\ndiscuss also other possible applications.\n", "  We point out that the CP asymmetries in the decays $D^0\\rightarrow K_{S}\nK^{*0}$ and $D^0\\rightarrow K_{S} \\overline{K}{}^{*0}$ are potential discovery\nchannels for charm CP violation in the Standard Model. We stress that no flavor\ntagging is necessary, the untagged CP asymmetry $a_{CP}^{\\mathrm{dir}}(D \\to\nK_S K^{*0})$ is essentially equal to the tagged one, so that the untagged\nmeasurement comes with a significant statistical gain. Depending on the\nrelevant strong phase, $\\vert a_{CP}^{\\text{dir, untag}}\\vert$ can be as large\nas $0.003$. The CP asymmetry is dominantly generated by exchange diagrams and\ndoes not require non-vanishing penguin amplitudes. While the CP asymmetry is\nsmaller than in the case of $D^0\\rightarrow K_SK_S$, the experimental analysis\nis more efficient due to the prompt decay $K^{*0}\\rightarrow K^+\\pi^-$. One may\nfurther search for favourable strong phases in the Dalitz plot in the vicinity\nof the $K^{*0}$ peak.\n", "  Tin-vacancy (SnV) color centers were created in diamond by ion implantation\nand subsequent high temperature annealing up to 2100 {\\deg}C at 7.7 GPa. The\nfirst-principles calculation suggests that the large atom of tin can be\nincorporated into the diamond lattice with a split-vacancy configuration, in\nwhich a tin atom sits on an interstitial site with two neighboring vacancies.\nThe SnV center shows a sharp zero phonon line at 619 nm at room temperature.\nThis line splits into four peaks at cryogenic temperatures with a larger ground\nstate splitting of ~850 GHz than those of color centers based on other IV group\nelements, silicon-vacancy (SiV) and germanium vacancy (GeV) centers. The\nexcited state lifetime was estimated to be ~5 ns by Hanbury Brown-Twiss\ninterferometry measurements on single SnV quantum emitters. The order of the\nexperimentally obtained optical transition energies comparing with the SiV and\nGeV centers is good agreement with the theoretical calculations.\n", "  We study a switching synchronization phenomenon taking place in\none-dimensional memristive networks when the memristors switch from the high to\nlow resistance state. It is assumed that the distributions of threshold\nvoltages and switching rates of memristors are arbitrary. Using the Laplace\ntransform, a set of non-linear equations describing the memristors dynamics is\nsolved exactly, without any approximations. The time dependencies of\nmemristances are found and it is shown that the voltage falls across memristors\nare proportional to their threshold voltages. A compact expression for the\nnetwork switching time is derived.\n", "  We explore the evolution of wave-function statistics on a finite Bethe\nlattice (Cayley tree) from the central site (\"root\") to the boundary\n(\"leaves\"). We show that the eigenfunction moments $P_q=N\n\\left<|\\psi|^{2q}(i)\\right>$ exhibit a multifractal scaling $P_q\\propto\nN^{-\\tau_q}$ with the volume (number of sites) $N$ at $N\\to\\infty$. The\nmultifractality spectrum $\\tau_q$ depends on the strength of disorder and on\nthe parameter $s$ characterizing the position of the observation point $i$ on\nthe lattice. Specifically, $s= r/R$, where $r$ is the distance from the\nobservation point to the root, and $R$ is the \"radius\" of the lattice. We\ndemonstrate that the exponents $\\tau_q$ depend linearly on $s$ and determine\nthe evolution of the spectrum with increasing disorder, from delocalized to the\nlocalized phase. Analytical results are obtained for the $n$-orbital model with\n$n \\gg 1$ that can be mapped onto a supersymmetric $\\sigma$ model. These\nresults are supported by numerical simulations (exact diagonalization) of the\nconventional ($n=1$) Anderson tight-binding model.\n", "  Massive stars are the key agents of feedback. Consequently, quantitative\nanalysis of massive stars are required to understand how the feedback of these\nobjects shapes/ creates the large scale structures of the ISM. The giant HII\nregion N206 in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains an OB association that\npowers a X-ray superbubble, serving as an ideal laboratory in this context. We\nobtained optical spectra with the muti-object spectrograph FLAMES at the\nESO-VLT. When possible, the optical spectroscopy was complemented by UV spectra\nfrom the HST, IUE, and FUSE archives. Detailed spectral classifications are\npresented for our sample Of-type stars. For the quantitative spectroscopic\nanalysis we use the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The\nphysical parameters and nitrogen abundances of our sample stars are determined\nby fitting synthetic spectra to the observations. The stellar and wind\nparameters of nine Of-type stars are used to construct wind momentum,luminosity\nrelationship. We find that our sample follows a relation close to the\ntheoretical prediction, assuming clumped winds. The most massive star in the\nN206 association is an Of supergiant which has a very high mass-loss rate. Two\nobjects in our sample reveal composite spectra, showing that the Of primaries\nhave companions of late O subtype. All stars in our sample have an evolutionary\nage less than 4 million years, with the O2-type star being the youngest. All\nthese stars show a systematic discrepancy between evolutionary and\nspectroscopic masses. All stars in our sample are nitrogen enriched. Nitrogen\nenrichment shows a clear correlation with increasing projected rotational\nvelocities. The mechanical energy input from the Of stars alone is comparable\nto the energy stored in the N206 superbubble as measured from the observed\nX-ray and H alpha emission.\n", "  We consider ballistic SQUIDs with spin filtering inside half-metallic\nferromagnetic arms. A singlet Cooper pair cannot pass through an arm in this\ncase, so the Josephson current is entirely due to the Cooper pair splitting,\nwith two electrons going to different interferometer arms. In order to\nelucidate the mechanisms of Josephson transport due to split Cooper pairs, we\nassume the arms to be single-channel wires in the short-junction limit.\nDifferent geometries of the system (determined by the length of the arms and\nthe phases acquired by quasiparticles during splitting between the arms) lead\nto qualitatively different behavior of the SQUID characteristics (the Andreev\nlevels, the current-phase relation, and the critical Josephson current) as a\nfunction of two control parameters, the external magnetic flux and\nmisorientation of the two spin filters. The current-phase relation can change\nits amplitude and shape, in particular, turning to a pi-junction form or\nacquiring additional zero crossings. The critical current can become a\nnonmonotonic function of the misorientation of the spin filters and the\nmagnetic flux (on half of period). Periodicity with respect to the magnetic\nflux is doubled, in comparison to conventional SQUIDs.\n", "  Chondrules in primitive meteorites likely formed by recrystallisation of dust\naggregates that were flash-heated to nearly complete melting. Chondrules may\nrepresent the building blocks of rocky planetesimals and protoplanets in the\ninner regions of protoplanetary discs, but the source of ubiquitous thermal\nprocessing of their dust aggregate precursors remains elusive. Here we\ndemonstrate that escape of positrons released in the decay of the short-lived\nradionuclide $^{26}$Al leads to a large-scale charging of dense pebble\nstructures, resulting in neutralisation by lightning discharge and\nflash-heating of dust and pebbles. This charging mechanism is similar to a\nnuclear battery where a radioactive source charges a capacitor. We show that\nthe nuclear battery effect operates in circumplanetesimal pebble discs. The\nextremely high pebble densities in such discs are consistent with conditions\nduring chondrule heating inferred from the high abundance of sodium within\nchondrules. The sedimented mid-plane layer of the protoplanetary disc may also\nbe prone to charging by the emission of positrons, if the mass density of small\ndust there is at least an order of magnitude above the gas density. Our results\nimply that the decay energy of $^{26}$Al can be harvested to drive intense\nlightning activity in protoplanetary discs. The total energy stored in positron\nemission is comparable to the energy needed to melt all solids in the\nprotoplanetary disc. The efficiency of transferring the positron energy to the\nelectric field nevertheless depends on the relatively unknown distribution and\nscale-dependence of pebble density gradients in circumplanetesimal pebble discs\nand in the protoplanetary disc mid-plane layer.\n", "  Ferromagnetic-ferroelectric nanocomposites are of interest for realizing\nstrong strain mediated coupling between electric and magnetic subsystems due to\nhigh surface area-to-volume ratio. This report is on the synthesis of nickel\nferrite (NFO) -barium titanate (BTO) core-shell nano-fibers, magnetic field\nassisted assembly into superstructures, and studies on magneto-electric (ME)\ninteractions. Electrospinning techniques were used to prepare coaxial fibers of\n0.5-1.5 micron in diameter. The core-shell structure of annealed fibers was\nconfirmed by electron microscopy and scanning probe microscopy. The fibers were\nassembled into discs and films in a uniform magnetic field or a field gradient.\nStudies on ME coupling in the assembled films and discs were done by magnetic\nfield H induced polarization, magneto-dielectric effects at low frequencies and\nat 16-24 GHz, and low frequency ME voltage coefficients (MEVC). We measured 2~\n2-7% change in remnant polarization and in the permittivity for H = 7 kOe, and\na MEVC of 0.4 mV/cm Oe at 30 Hz. A model has been developed for low-frequency\nME effects in an assembly of fibers and takes into account dipole-dipole\ninteractions between the fibers and fiber discontinuity. Theoretical estimates\nfor the low-frequency MEVC have been compared with the data. These results\nindicate strong ME coupling in superstructures of the core-shell fibers.\n", "  We present results from general-relativistic (GR) three-dimensional (3D)\ncore-collapse simulations with approximate neutrino transport for three\nnon-rotating progenitors (11.2, 15, and 40 Msun) using different nuclear\nequations of state (EOSs). We find that the combination of progenitor's higher\ncompactness at bounce and the use of softer EOS leads to stronger activity of\nthe standing accretion shock instability (SASI). We confirm previous\npredications that the SASI produces characteristic time modulations both in\nneutrino and gravitational-wave (GW) signals. By performing a correlation\nanalysis of the SASI-modulated neutrino and GW signals, we find that the\ncorrelation becomes highest when we take into account the time-delay effect due\nto the advection of material from the neutrino sphere to the proto-neutron star\ncore surface. Our results suggest that the correlation of the neutrino and GW\nsignals, if detected, would provide a new signature of the vigorous SASI\nactivity in the supernova core, which can be hardly seen if neutrino-convection\ndominates over the SASI.\n", "  In order to best improve constraints on cosmological parameters and on models\nof modified gravity using current and future galaxy surveys it is necessary\nmaximally exploit the available data. As redshift-space distortions mean\nstatistical translation invariance is broken for galaxy observations, this will\nrequire measurement of the monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole of not just\nthe galaxy power spectrum, but also the galaxy bispectrum. A recent (2015)\npaper by Scoccimarro demonstrated how the standard bispectrum estimator may be\nexpressed in terms of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to afford an extremely\nefficient algorithm, allowing the bispectrum multipoles on all scales and\ntriangle shapes to be measured in comparable time to those of the power\nspectrum. In this paper we present a suite of alternative proxies to measure\nthe three-point correlation multipoles. In particular, we describe a modal (or\nplane wave) decomposition to capture the information in each multipole in a\nseries of basis coefficients, and also describe three compressed estimators\nformed using the skew-spectrum, the line correlation function and the\nintegrated bispectrum, respectively. As well as each of the estimators offering\na different measurement channel, and thereby a robustness check, it is expected\nthat some (especially the modal estimator) will offer a vast data compression,\nand so a much reduced covariance matrix. This compression may be vital to\nreduce the computational load involved in extracting the available three-point\ninformation.\n", "  Nearby type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), such as SN 2017cbv, are useful events to\naddress the question of what the elusive progenitor systems of the explosions\nare. Hosseinzadeh et al. (2017) suggested that the early blue excess of the\nlightcurve of SN 2017cbv could be due to the supernova ejecta interacting with\na non-degenerate companion star. Some SN Ia progenitor models suggest the\nexistence of circumstellar (CS) environments in which strong outflows create\nlow density cavities of different radii. Matter deposited at the edges of the\ncavities, should be at distances at which photoionisation due to early\nultraviolet (UV) radiation of SNe Ia causes detectable changes to the\nobservable Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption lines. To study possible narrow\nabsorption lines from such material, we obtained a time-series of\nhigh-resolution spectra of SN 2017cbv at phases between $-14.8$ and $+83$ days\nwith respect to $B$-band maximum, covering the time at which photoionisation is\npredicted to occur. Both narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K are detected in all\nspectra, with no measurable changes between the epochs. We use photoionisation\nmodels to rule out the presence of Na I and Ca II gas clouds along the\nline-of-sight of SN 2017cbv between $\\sim8\\times10^{16}$--$2\\times10^{19}$~cm\nand $\\sim10^{15}$--$10^{17}$~cm, respectively. Assuming typical abundances, the\nmass of a homogenous spherical CS gas shell with radius $R$ must be limited to\n$M^{\\rm CSM}_{\\rm HI}<3\\times10^{-4}\\times(R/10^{17}[{\\rm cm}])^2$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThe bounds point to progenitor models that deposit little gas in their CS\nenvironment.\n", "  We model the triggering of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in galaxy clusters\nusing the semi- analytic galaxy formation model SAGE (?). We prescribe\ntriggering methods based on the ram pressure galaxies experience as they move\nthroughout the intracluster medium, which is hypothesized to trigger star\nformation and AGN activity. The clustercentric radius and velocity distribution\nof the simulated active galaxies produced by these models are compared with\nthat of AGN and galaxies with intense star formation from a sample of\nlow-redshift, relaxed clusters from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The ram\npressure triggering model that best explains the clustercentric radius and\nvelocity distribution of these observed galaxies has AGN and star formation\ntriggered if $2.5\\times10^{-14} < P_{ram} < 2.5\\times10^{-13}$ Pa and $P_{ram}\n> 2P_{internal}$; this is consistent with expectations from hydrodynamical\nsimulations of ram-pressure induced star formation. Our results show that ram\npressure is likely to be an important mechanism for triggering star formation\nand AGN activity in clusters.\n", "  \"Punchets\" are hybrids between ratchets and pumps, combining a spatially\nperiodic static potential, typically asymmetric under space inversion, with a\nlocal driving that breaks time-reversal invariance, and are intended to model\nmetal or semiconductor surfaces irradiated by a collimated laser beam. Their\ncrucial feature is irregular driven scattering between asymptotic regions\nsupporting periodic (as opposed to free) motion. With all binary\nspatio-temporal symmetries broken, scattering in punchets typically generates\ndirected currents. We here study the underlying nonlinear transport mechanisms,\nfrom chaotic scattering to the parameter dependence of the currents, in three\ntypes of Hamiltonian models, (i) with spatially periodic potentials where only\nin the driven scattering region, spatial and temporal symmetries are broken,\nand (ii), spatially asymmetric (ratchet) potentials with a driving that only\nbreaks time-reversal invariance. As more realistic models of laser-irradiated\nsurfaces, we consider (iii), a driving in the form of a running wave confined\nto a compact region by a static envelope. In this case, the induced current can\neven run against the direction of wave propagation, drastically evidencing of\nits nonlinear nature. Quantizing punchets is indicated as a viable research\nperspective.\n", "  Current induced spin wave excitations in spin transfer torque nano-contacts\nare known as a promising way to generate exchange-dominated spin waves at the\nnano-scale. It has been shown that when these systems are magnetized in the\nfilm plane, broken spatial symmetry of the field around the nano-contact\ninduced by the Oersted field opens the possibility for spin wave mode\nco-existence including a non-linear self-localized spin-wave bullet and a\npropagating mode. By means of micromagnetic simulations, here we show that in\nsystems with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in the free layer,\ntwo propagating spin wave modes with different frequency and spatial\ndistribution can be excited simultaneously. Our results indicate that in-plane\nmagnetized spin transfer nano-contacts in PMA materials do not host a solitonic\nself-localized spin-wave bullet, which is different from previous studies for\nsystems with in plane magnetic anisotropy. This feature renders them\ninteresting for nano-scale magnonic waveguides and crystals since magnon\ntransport can be configured by tuning the applied current.\n", "  The equivalence of the Bott index and the Chern number is established in the\nthermodynamic limit for a gapped, short ranged and bounded Hamiltonian on a two\ndimensional torus of linear size $ L $. A Kubo formula as an exact operatorial\nidentity is provided in real space and used to show the quantization of the\ntransverse conductance within corrections of order $L^{-1}$. In doing so the\nphysical foundations of the theory that introduces the Bott index in the realm\nof condensed matter as proposed by Hastings and Loring in J. Math. Phys. (51),\n015214, (2010) and Annals of Physics 326 (2011) 1699-1759 are recalled.\n", "  We present an \\emph{ab initio} study of the role of interference effects in\nthe thermal conductance of single-molecule junctions. To be precise, using a\nfirst-principles transport method based on density functional theory, we\nanalyze the coherent phonon transport in single-molecule junctions based on\nseveral benzene and oligo-phenylene-ethynylene derivatives. We show that the\nthermal conductance of these junctions can be tuned via the inclusion of\nsubstituents, which induces destructive interference effects and results in a\ndecrease of the thermal conductance with respect to the unmodified molecules.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that these interference effects manifest as\nantiresonances in the phonon transmission, whose energy positions can be\ncontrolled by varying the mass of the substituents. Our work provides clear\nstrategies for the heat management in molecular junctions and more generally in\nnanostructured metal-organic hybrid systems, which are important to determine,\nhow these systems can function as efficient energy-conversion devices such as\nthermoelectric generators and refrigerators.\n", "  The existence of neutron stars with $2M_\\odot$ requires the strong stiffness\nof the equation of state (EoS) of neutron-star matter. We introduce a\nmulti-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) working universally among 3- and\n4-baryons to stiffen the EoS. Its strength is restricted by analyzing the\nnucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix folding model. The EoSs are\nderived using the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) and the cluster variational\nmethod (CVM) with the nuclear interactions ESC and AV18. The mass-radius\nrelations are derived by solving the Tolmann-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV)\nequation, where the maximum masses over $2M_\\odot$ are obtained on the basis of\nthe terrestrial data. Neutron-star radii $R$ at a typical mass $1.5M_\\odot$ are\npredicted to be $12.3\\!\\sim\\!13.0$ km. The uncertainty of calculated radii is\nmainly from the ratio of 3- and 4-pomeron coupling constants, which cannot be\nfixed by any terrestrial experiment. Though values of $R(1.5M_\\odot)$ are not\ninfluenced by hyperon-mixing effects, finely-observed values for them indicate\ndegrees of EoS softening by hyperon mixing in the region of\n$M\\!\\sim\\!2M_\\odot$. If $R(1.5M_\\odot)$ is less than about 12.4 km, the\nsoftening of EoS by hyperon mixing has to be weak. Useful information can be\nexpected by the space mission NICER offering precise measurements for\nneutron-star radii within $\\pm 5\\%$.\n", "  Based on the gedanken experiment for black hole complementarity in the\nSchwarzschild black hole, we calculate the energy required to duplicate\ninformation in the BTZ black hole under the assumption of absorbing boundary\ncondition and its dual solution of the black string, respectively, in order to\njustify the validity of the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics. For the\nBTZ black hole, the required energy for the duplication of information can be\nmade fairly small, whereas for the black string it exceeds the total mass of\nthe black string, although they are related to each other under the dual\ntransformation. So, the duplication of information might be possible in the BTZ\nblack hole in contrast to the case of the black string, so that the no-cloning\ntheorem could be violated for the former case. To save the duplication of\ninformation for the BTZ black hole, we perform an improved gedanken experiment\nby using the local thermodynamic quantities near the horizon rather than those\ndefined at infinity, and show that the no-cloning theorem could be made valid\neven in the BTZ black hole. We also discuss how this local treatment for the\nno-cloning theorem can be applied to the black string as well as the\nSchwarzschild black hole innocuously.\n", "  It is generically believed that higher-order curvature corrections to the\nEinstein-Hilbert action might cure the curvature singularities that plague\ngeneral relativity. Here we consider Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the\nonly four-dimensional, ghost-free theory with quadratic curvature terms. For\nany choice of the coupling function and of the scalar potential, we show that\nthe theory does not allow for bouncing solutions in the flat and open Friedmann\nuniverse. For the case of a closed universe, using a reverse-engineering\nmethod, we explicitly provide a bouncing solution which is nevertheless\nlinearly unstable in the scalar gravitational sector. Moreover, we show that\nthe expanding, singularity-free, early-time cosmologies allowed in the theory\nare unstable. These results rely only on analyticity and finiteness of\ncosmological variables at early times.\n", "  The search for exotic topological effects of phonons has attracted enormous\ninterest for both fundamental science and practical applications. By studying\nphonons in a Kekul\\'e lattice, we find a new type of pseudospins characterized\nby quantized Berry phases and pseudoangular momenta, which introduces various\nnovel topological effects, including topologically protected\npseudospin-polarized interface states and a phonon pseudospin Hall effect. We\nfurther demonstrate a pseudospin-contrasting optical selection rule and a\npseudospin Zeeman effect, giving a complete generation-manipulation-detection\nparadigm of the phonon pseudospin. The pseudospin and topology-related physics\nrevealed for phonons is general and applicable for electrons, photons and other\nparticles.\n", "  The thermal fluctuations contribution to magnetization and\nmagneto-conductivity of type II layered superconductor is calculated in the\nframework of Lawrence-Doniach model. For numerous high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors, it was discovered that the magnetization dependence on\ntemperature in wide range of fields exhibits an intersection point at a\ntemperature slightly below $T_{c}$. We notice a similar intersection point of\nthe magneto-conductivity curves at the approximate same temperature. The\nphenomenon is explained by strong (non-gaussian) thermal fluctuations with\ninteractions treated using a self-consistent theory. All higher Landau levels\nshould be included. Dimensionality of the fluctuations is defined and the 2D-3D\ndimensional crossover is the key for the existence of intersection points.\n", "  We use the recently developed generalized double-copy procedure to construct\nan integrand for the five-loop four-point amplitude of N=8 supergravity. This\nconstruction starts from a naive double copy of the previously computed\ncorresponding amplitude of N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory. This is then\nsystematically modified by adding contact terms generated in the context of the\nmethod of maximal unitarity cuts. For the simpler generalized cuts, whose\ncorresponding contact terms tend to be the most complicated, we derive a set of\nformulas relating the contact contributions to the violations of the dual\nJacobi identities in the relevant gauge-theory amplitudes. For more complex\ngeneralized unitarity cuts, which tend to have simpler contact terms associated\nwith them, we use the method of maximal cuts more directly. The five-loop\nfour-point integrand is a crucial ingredient towards future studies of\nultraviolet properties of N=8 supergravity at five loops and beyond. We also\npresent a nontrivial check of the consistency of the integrand, based on modern\napproaches for integrating over the loop momenta in the ultraviolet region.\n", "  We discuss the entropy carried by a quark-antiquark pair, in particular\nacross the deconfinement transition. We therefore rely on a self-consistent\nsolution to Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, capable of mimicking essential\nfeatures of QCD. In particular we introduce a novel model that still captures\nwell the QCD confinement and deconfinement phases, while allowing the\nintroduction of a temperature in a phase which resembles the confined phase,\nthis thanks to it being dual to a small black hole. We pay due attention to\nsome subtleties of such model. We confirm the lattice picture of a strong\nbuild-up of thermal entropy towards the critical temperature T_c, both coming\nfrom below or above T_c. We also include a chemical potential, confirming this\nentropic picture and we consider its effect on the speed of sound. Moreover,\nthe temperature dependent confinement phase from the holography side allows us\nto find a string tension that does not vanish at T_c, a finding also supported\nby lattice QCD.\n", "  Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are used in several ongoing and upcoming\nsurveys (SDSS-IV/eBOSS, DESI) as tracers of the dark matter distribution. Using\na new galaxy formation model, we explore the characteristics of [OII] emitters,\nwhich dominate optical ELG selections at $z\\simeq 1$. Model [OII] emitters at\n$0.5<z<1.5$ are selected to mimic the DEEP2, VVDS, eBOSS and DESI surveys. The\nluminosity functions of model [OII] emitters are in reasonable agreement with\nobservations. The selected [OII] emitters are hosted by haloes with $M_{\\rm\nhalo}\\geq 10^{10.3}h^{-1}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$, with ~90% of them being central\nstar-forming galaxies. The predicted mean halo occupation distributions of\n[OII] emitters has a shape typical of that inferred for star-forming galaxies,\nwith the contribution from central galaxies, $\\langle N\n\\rangle_{\\left[OII\\right]\\, cen}$, being far from the canonical step function.\nThe $\\langle N \\rangle_{\\left[OII\\right]\\, cen}$ can be described as the sum of\nan asymmetric Gaussian for disks and a step function for spheroids, which\nplateaus below unity. The model [OII] emitters have a clustering bias close to\nunity, which is below the expectations for eBOSS and DESI ELGs. At $z\\sim 1$, a\ncomparison with observed g-band selected galaxy, which are expected to be\ndominated by [OII] emitters, indicates that our model produces too few [OII]\nemitters that are satellite galaxies. This suggests the need to revise our\nmodelling of hot gas stripping in satellite galaxies.\n", "  We study the superfluid properties of a system of fully polarized dipolar\nbosons moving in the $xy$ plane. We focus on the general case where the\npolarization field forms an arbitrary angle $\\alpha$ with respect to the $z$\naxis, while the system is still stable. We use the diffusion Monte Carlo and\nthe path integral ground state methods to evaluate the one-body density matrix\nand the superfluid fractions in the region of the phase diagram where the\nsystem forms stripes. Despite its oscillatory behavior, the presence of a\nfinite large-distance asymptotic value in the $s$-wave component of the\none-body density matrix indicates the existence of a Bose condensate. The\nsuperfluid fraction along the stripes direction is always close to 1, while in\nthe $y$ direction decreases to a small value that is nevertheless different\nfrom zero. These two facts confirms that the stripe phase of the dipolar Bose\ngas in 2D is superfluid.\n", "  The lowest dimension three-gluon currents that couple to the exotic\n$0^{\\pm-}$ glueballs have been constructed using the helicity formalism. Based\non the constructed currents, we obtain new QCD SRs that have been used to\nextract the masses and the decay constants of the scalar exotic $0^{\\pm-}$\nglueballs. We estimate the masses for the scalar state and for the pseudoscalar\nstate to be ${m_+=9.8^{+1.3}_{-1.4}}$ GeV and $m_-=6.8^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ GeV.\n", "  X-ray diffraction studies of nanoporous gold face the poorly understood\ndiffraction scenario where large coherent crystals are riddled with nanoscale\nholes. Theoretical considerations derived in this study show that the ligament\nsize of the porous network influences the scattering despite being quasi single\ncrystalline. Virtual diffraction of artificially generated samples confirms the\nresults but also shows a loss of long-range coherency and the appearance of\nmicrostrain due to thermal relaxation. Subsequently, a large set of laboratory\nX-ray investigations of nanoporous gold fabricated by different approaches and\nsynthesis parameters reveal a clear correlation between ligament size and size\nof the coherent scattering domains as well as extremely high microstrains in\nsamples with ligament sizes below 10 nm.\n", "  The stellar disk of the Milky Way shows complex spatial and abundance\nstructure that is central to understanding the key physical mechanisms\nresponsible for shaping our Galaxy. In this study, we use six very high\nresolution cosmological zoom simulations of Milky Way-sized haloes to study the\nprevalence and formation of chemically distinct disc components. We find that\nour simulations develop a clearly bimodal distribution in the $[\\rm \\alpha/Fe]$\n-- $[\\rm Fe/H]$ plane. We find two main pathways to creating this dichotomy\nwhich operate in different regions of the galaxies: a) an early ($z>1$) and\nintense high-$\\rm[\\alpha/Fe]$ star formation phase in the inner region\n($R\\lesssim 5$ kpc) induced by gas-rich mergers, followed by more quiescent\nlow-$\\rm[\\alpha/Fe]$ star formation; and b) an early phase of\nhigh-$\\rm[\\alpha/Fe]$ star formation in the outer disc followed by a shrinking\nof the gas disc owing to a temporarily lowered gas accretion rate, after which\ndisc growth resumes. In process b), a double-peaked star formation history\naround the time and radius of disc shrinking accentuates the dichotomy. If the\nearly star formation phase is prolonged (rather than short and intense),\nchemical evolution proceeds as per process a) in the inner region, but the\ndichotomy is less clear. In the outer region, the dichotomy is only evident if\nthe first intense phase of star formation covers a large enough radial range\nbefore disc shrinking occurs; otherwise, the outer disc consists of only\nlow-$\\rm[\\alpha/Fe]$ sequence stars. We discuss the implication that both\nprocesses occurred in the Milky Way.\n", "  The \"kinematic\" morphology-density relation for early-type galaxies posits\nthat those galaxies with low angular momentum are preferentially found in the\nhighest-density regions of the universe. We use a large sample of galaxy groups\nwith halo masses 10^12.5 < M_halo < 10^14.5 M_sun/h observed with the Mapping\nNearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey to examine whether there is a correlation\nbetween local environment and rotational support that is independent of stellar\nmass. We find no compelling evidence for a relationship between the angular\nmomentum content of early-type galaxies and either local overdensity or radial\nposition within the group at fixed stellar mass.\n", "  NaFe$_{0.5}$Cu$_{0.5}$As represents a rare exception in the metallic iron\npnictide family, in which a small insulating gap is opened. Based on\nfirst-principles study, we provide a comprehensive theoretical characterization\nof this insulating compound. The Fe$^{3+} $spin degree of freedom is quantified\nas a quasi-1D $S=\\frac{5}{2}$ Heisenberg model. The itinerant As hole state is\ndownfolded to a $p_{xy}$-orbital hopping model on a square lattice. A unique\norbital-dependent Hund's coupling between the spin and the hole is revealed.\nSeveral important material properties are analyzed, including (a) factors\naffecting the small $p-d$ charge-transfer gap; (b) role of the extra interchain\nFe; and (c) the quasi-1D spin excitation in the Fe chains. The experimental\nmanifestations of these properties are discussed.\n", "  We analyze recent magnetar light-curve modeling of 38 hydrogen-poor\nsuperluminous supernovae (SLSNe), and find that the energies of the explosions\nthemselves, that take place before the magnetar energy is released, are more\nthan what the neutrino-driven explosion mechanism can supply for about half of\nthe systems. These SLSNe must have been exploded by a different process than\nthe delayed neutrino mechanism, most likely the jet feedback mechanism (JFM).\nThe conclusion for magnetar modeling of SLSNe is that jets launched at magnetar\nbirth cannot be ignored, not at the explosion itself and not later when mass\nfall-back might occur. More generally, the present analysis strengthens the\ncall for a paradigm shift from neutrino-driven to jet-driven explosion models\nof all core collapse supernovae.\n", "  Compact stellar binaries are expected to survive in the dense environment of\nthe Galactic Center. The stable binaries may undergo Kozai-Lidov oscillations\ndue to perturbations from the central supermassive black hole (Sgr A*), yet the\nGeneral Relativistic precession can suppress the Kozai-Lidov oscillations and\nkeep the stellar binaries from merging. However, it is challenging to resolve\nthe binary sources and distinguish them from single stars. The close separation\nof the stable binaries allow higher eclipse probabilities. Here, we consider\nthe massive star SO2 as an example and calculate the probability of detecting\neclipses, assuming it is a binary. We find that the eclipse probability is ~\n30-50%, reaching higher values when the stellar binary is more eccentric or\nhighly inclined relative to its orbit around Sgr A*.\n", "  A detailed formulation for the effects of the surface integrity, i.e. surface\ntopography, surface metallurgy, and surface mechanical properties, on the\nmechanics of ultra-thin films is proposed in the framework of linear\nelasticity. In this formulation, the ultra-thin film is modeled as a material\nbulk covered with two altered layers and two rough surfaces as distinct phases.\nTwo versions of the proposed formulation are developed. In the first version,\nthe governing equations are obtained depending on the general form of the\nsurface topography. In the second version, the governing equations are\nreformulated utilizing the average parameters of the surface topography. In the\nproposed formulation, measures are incorporated to account for the effects of\nthe surface topography, i.e. waviness and roughness, surface metallurgy, i.e.\naltered layer, and surface excess energy on the mechanics of ultra-thin films.\nA case study for the static bending of clamped-clamped ultra-thin films is\nanalytically solved. A parametric study on the effects of the surface\nroughness, waviness, altered layers, and film size on the static bending of\nultra-thin films is presented. In this study, new size-dependent behaviors are\nrevealed where the mechanics of ultra-thin films can be significantly altered\nfor the small variations in the surface integrity.\n", "  We show that the tensor rank of tensor product of two three-qubit W states is\nnot less than eight. Combining this result with the recent result of M.\nChristandl, A. K. Jensen, and J. Zuiddam that the tensor rank of tensor product\nof two three-qubit W states is at most eight, we deduce that the tensor rank of\ntensor product of two three-qubit W states is eight. We also construct the\nupper bound of the tensor rank of tensor product of many three-qubit W states.\n", "  Triply degenerate points (TDPs) in band structure of a crystal can generate\nnovel TDP fermions without high-energy counterparts. Although identifying ideal\nTDP semimetals, which host clean TDP fermions around the Fermi level ($E_F$)\nwithout coexisting of other quasiparticles, is critical to explore the\nintrinsic properties of this new fermion, it is still a big challenge and has\nnot been achieved up to now. Here, we disclose an effective approach to search\nfor ideal TDP semimetals via selective band crossing between antibonding $s$\nand bonding $p$ orbitals along a line in the momentum space with $C_{3v}$\nsymmetry. Applying this approach, we have successfully identified the\nNaCu$_3$Te$_2$ family of compounds to be ideal TDP semimetals, where two and\nonly two pairs of TDPs are located around the $E_F$. Moreover, we reveal an\ninteresting mechanism to modulate energy splitting between a pair of TDPs, and\nillustrate the intrinsic features of TDP Fermi arcs in these ideal TDP\nsemimetals.\n", "  Optical clocks benefit from tight atomic confinement enabling extended\ninterrogation times as well as Doppler- and recoil-free operation. However,\nthese benefits come at the cost of frequency shifts that, if not properly\ncontrolled, may degrade clock accuracy. Numerous theoretical studies have\npredicted optical lattice clock frequency shifts that scale nonlinearly with\ntrap depth. To experimentally observe and constrain these shifts in an\n$^{171}$Yb optical lattice clock, we construct a lattice enhancement cavity\nthat exaggerates the light shifts. We observe an atomic temperature that is\nproportional to the optical trap depth, fundamentally altering the scaling of\ntrap-induced light shifts and simplifying their parametrization. We identify an\n\"operational\" magic wavelength where frequency shifts are insensitive to\nchanges in trap depth. These measurements and scaling analysis constitute an\nessential systematic characterization for clock operation at the $10^{-18}$\nlevel and beyond.\n", "  The modern semiclassical theory of a Bloch electron in a magnetic field\nencompasses the orbital magnetization and geometric phase. Beyond this\nsemiclassical theory lies the quantum description of field-induced tunneling\nbetween semiclassical orbits, known as magnetic breakdown. Here, we synthesize\nthe modern semiclassical notions with quantum tunneling -- into a single\nBohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule that is predictive of magnetic energy levels.\nThis rule is applicable to a host of topological solids with \\emph{unremovable}\ngeometric phase, that also \\emph{unavoidably} undergo breakdown. A notion of\ntopological invariants is formulated that nonperturbatively encode tunneling,\nand is measurable in the de-Haas-van-Alphen effect. Case studies are discussed\nfor topological metals near a metal-insulator transition and over-tilted Weyl\nfermions.\n", "  With the aim of exploring the properties of the class of FR0 radio galaxies,\nwe selected a sample of 108 compact radio sources, called FR0CAT, by combining\nobservations from the NVSS, FIRST, and SDSS surveys. The catalog includes\nsources with z$\\leq 0.05$, with a radio size $\\lesssim$ 5 kpc, and with an\noptical spectrum characteristic of low-excitation galaxies. Their 1.4-GHz radio\nluminosities range $10^{38} \\lesssim \\nu L_{1.4} \\lesssim 10^{40}$ erg/s. The\nFR0CAT hosts are mostly (86%) luminous ($-21 \\gtrsim M_r \\gtrsim -23$) red\nearly-type galaxies with black hole masses $10^8 \\lesssim M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim\n10^9 M_\\odot$: similar to the hosts of FRI radio galaxies, but they are on\naverage a factor $\\sim$1.6 less massive. The number density of FR0CAT sources\nis $\\sim$5 times higher than that of FRIs, and thus they represent the dominant\npopulation of radio sources in the local Universe. Different scenarios are\nconsidered to account for the smaller sizes and larger abundance of FR0s with\nrespect to FRIs. An age-size scenario that considers FR0s as young radio\ngalaxies that will all eventually evolve into extended radio sources cannot be\nreconciled with the large space density of FR0s. However, the radio activity\nrecurrence, with the duration of the active phase covering a wide range of\nvalues and with short active periods strongly favored with respect to longer\nones, might account for their large density number. Alternatively, the jet\nproperties of FR0s might be intrinsically different from those of the FRIs, the\nformer class having lower bulk Lorentz factors, possibly due to lower black\nhole spins. Our study indicates that FR0s and FRI/IIs can be interpreted as two\nextremes of a continuous population of radio sources that is characterized by a\nbroad distribution of sizes and luminosities of their extended radio emission,\nbut shares a single class of host galaxies.\n", "  We consider the interaction of one- and two-photon pulses in a waveguide with\ntwo two-level systems (TLS) that are also able to interact directly either\nthrough an exchange- or a dipole-type interaction. We focus on the system's\ntransport properties and show how the presence of a second TLS increases the\ncontrol options, especially when direct interactions are also allowed. We also\nobtain, within a Markov (long pulse) approximation, exact results for the\nnonlinear or entangled terms that arise in the two-photon case, and discuss\nboth their potential applications and ways to minimize their effects.\n", "  While it is possible to build causal sets that approximate spacetime\nmanifolds, most causal sets are not at all manifold-like. We show that a\nLorentzian path integral with the Einstein-Hilbert action has a phase in which\none large class of non-manifold-like causal sets is strongly suppressed, and\nsuggest a direction for generalization to other classes. While we cannot yet\nshow our argument holds for all non-manifold-like sets, our results make it\nplausible that the path integral might lead to emergent manifold-like behavior\nwith no need for further conditions.\n", "  The question of correlations among empirical equation of state (EoS)\nparameters constrained by nuclear observables is addressed in a fully empirical\nmeta-modeling approach. A recently proposed meta-modeling for the nuclear EoS\nin nuclear matter, is augmented with a single finite size term to produce a\nminimal unified EoS functional able to describe the smooth part of the nuclear\nground state properties. This meta-model can reproduce the predictions of a\nlarge variety of models, and interpolate continuously between them. The\nparameter space is sampled and filtered through the constraint of nuclear mass\nreproduction. We show that this simple analytical meta-modeling has a\npredictive power on masses, radii, and skins comparable to full HF or ETF\ncalculations with realistic energy functionals. The covariance analysis on the\nposterior distribution shows that no physical correlation is present between\nthe different EoS parameters. Concerning nuclear observables, a strong\ncorrelation between the slope of the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is\nobserved, in agreement with previous studies.\n", "  We use Herschel data to analyze the size of the far-infrared 70micron\nemission for z<0.06 local samples of 277 hosts of Swift-BAT selected active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), and 515 comparison galaxies that are not detected by\nBAT. For modest far-infrared luminosities 8.5<log(LFIR)<10.5, we find large\nscatter of half light radii Re70 for both populations, but a typical Re70 <~ 1\nkpc for the BAT hosts that is only half that of comparison galaxies of same\nfar-infrared luminosity. The result mostly reflects a more compact distribution\nof star formation (and hence gas) in the AGN hosts, but compact AGN heated dust\nmay contribute in some extremely AGN-dominated systems. Our findings are in\nsupport of an AGN-host coevolution where accretion onto the central black hole\nand star formation are fed from the same gas reservoir, with more efficient\nblack hole feeding if that reservoir is more concentrated. The significant\nscatter in the far-infrared sizes emphasizes that we are mostly probing spatial\nscales much larger than those of actual accretion, and that rapid accretion\nvariations can smear the distinction between the AGN and comparison categories.\nLarge samples are hence needed to detect structural differences that favour\nfeeding of the black hole. No size difference AGN host vs. comparison galaxies\nis observed at higher far-infrared luminosities log(LFIR)>10.5 (star formation\nrates >~ 6 Msun/yr), possibly because these are typically reached in more\ncompact regions in the first place.\n", "  We describe the general inflationary dynamics that can arise with a single,\ncanonically coupled field where the inflaton potential is a 4-th order\npolynomial. This scenario yields a wide range of combinations of the empirical\nspectral observables, $n_s$, $r$ and $\\alpha_s$. However, not all combinations\nare possible and next-generation cosmological experiments have the ability to\nrule out all inflationary scenarios based on this potential. Further, we\nconstruct inflationary priors for this potential based on physically motivated\nchoices for its free parameters. These can be used to determine the degree of\ntuning associated with different combinations of $n_s$, $r$ and $\\alpha_s$ and\nwill facilitate treatments of the inflationary model selection problem.\nFinally, we comment on the implications of these results for the naturalness of\nthe overall inflationary paradigm. We argue that ruling out all simple\npotentials would not necessarily imply that the inflationary paradigm itself\nwas unnatural, but that this eventuality would increase the importance of\nbuilding inflationary scenarios in the context of broader paradigms of\nultra-high energy physics.\n", "  The polarization of the $\\Upsilon(1S)$, $\\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)\n$mesons, produced in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$=7\nand 8TeV, is measured using data samples collected by the LHCb experiment,\ncorresponding to integrated luminosities of 1 and 2fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The\nmeasurements are performed in three polarization frames, using\n$\\Upsilon\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ decays in the kinematic region of the transverse\nmomentum $p_{T}(\\Upsilon)<30GeV/c$, and rapidity $2.2<y(\\Upsilon)<4.5$. No\nlarge polarization is observed.\n", "  In the framework of Keldysh-Usadel kinetic theory, we study the temperature\ndependence of flux-flow conductivity (FFC) in diffusive superconductors. By\nusing self-consistent vortex solutions we find the exact values of\ndimensionless parameters that determine the diffusion-controlled FFC both in\nthe limit of the low temperatures and close to the critical one. Taking into\naccount the electron-phonon scattering we study the transition between\nflux-flow regimes controlled either by the diffusion or the inelastic\nrelaxation of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. We demonstrate that the inelastic\nelectron-phonon relaxation leads to the strong suppression of FFC as compared\nto the previous estimates making it possible to obtain the numerical agreement\nwith experimental results.\n", "  Electron capture (EC) isotopes are known to provide constraints on the low\nenergy behavior of cosmic rays (CRs), such as re-acceleration. Here we study\nthe EC isotopes within the framework of the dynamic spiral-arms CR propagation\nmodel in which most of the CR sources reside in the galactic spiral arms. The\nmodel was previously used to explain the B/C and sub-Fe/Fe ratios\n\\citep{BoverC,Iron}. We show that the known inconsistency between the\n$^{49}$Ti/$^{49}$V and $^{51}$V/$^{51}$Cr ratios remains also in the\nspiral-arms model. On the other hand, unlike the general wisdom in which the\nisotope ratios depend primarily on reacceleration, we find here that the ratio\nalso depends on the halo size ($z_\\mathrm{h}$) and in spiral-arms models also\non the time since the last spiral arm passage ($\\tau_\\mathrm{arm}$). Namely, EC\nisotopes can in principle provide interesting constraints on the diffusion\ngeometry. However, with the present uncertainties in the lab measurements of\nboth the electron attachment rate and the fragmentation cross-sections, no\nmeaningful constraint can be placed.\n", "  Massive stars with solar metallicity lose important amounts of rotational\nangular momentum through their winds. When a magnetic field is present at the\nsurface of a star, efficient angular momentum losses can still be achieved even\nwhen the mass-loss rate is very modest, at lower metallicities, or for\nlower-initial-mass stars. In a close binary system, the effect of wind magnetic\nbraking also interacts with the influence of tides, resulting in a complex\nevolution of rotation. We study the interactions between the process of wind\nmagnetic braking and tides in close binary systems. We discuss the evolution of\na 10 M$_\\odot$ star in a close binary system with a 7 M$_\\odot$ companion using\nthe Geneva stellar evolution code. The initial orbital period is 1.2 days. The\n10 M$_\\odot$ star has a surface magnetic field of 1 kG. Various initial\nrotations are considered. We use two different approaches for the internal\nangular momentum transport. In one of them, angular momentum is transported by\nshear and meridional currents. In the other, a strong internal magnetic field\nimposes nearly perfect solid-body rotation. The evolution of the primary is\ncomputed until the first mass-transfer episode occurs. The cases of different\nvalues for the magnetic fields and for various orbital periods and mass ratios\nare briefly discussed. We show that, independently of the initial rotation rate\nof the primary and the efficiency of the internal angular momentum transport,\nthe surface rotation of the primary will converge, in a time that is short with\nrespect to the main-sequence lifetime, towards a slowly evolving velocity that\nis different from the synchronization velocity. (abridged).\n", "  Many organisms can remember locations they have previously visited during a\nsearch. Visual search experiments have shown exploration is guided away from\nthese locations, reducing the overlap of the search path before finding a\nhidden target. We develop and analyze a two-layer neural field model that\nencodes positional information during a search task. A position-encoding layer\nsustains a bump attractor corresponding to the searching agent's current\nlocation, and search is modeled by velocity input that propagates the bump. A\nmemory layer sustains persistent activity bounded by a wave front, whose edges\nexpand in response to excitatory input from the position layer. Search can then\nbe biased in response to remembered locations, influencing velocity inputs to\nthe position layer. Asymptotic techniques are used to reduce the dynamics of\nour model to a low-dimensional system of equations that track the bump position\nand front boundary. Performance is compared for different target-finding tasks.\n", "  Open quantum systems exhibiting initial system-environment correlations are\nnotoriously difficult to simulate. We point out that given a sufficiently long\nsample of the exact short-time evolution of the open system dynamics, one may\nemploy transfer tensors for the further propagation of the reduced open system\nstate. This approach is numerically advantageous and allows for the simulation\nof quantum correlation functions in hardly accessible regimes. We benchmark\nthis approach against analytically exact solutions and exemplify it with the\ncalculation of emission spectra of multichromophoric systems as well as for the\nreverse temperature estimation from simulated spectroscopic data. Finally, we\nemploy our approach for the detection of spectral signatures of\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency in open three-level systems.\n", "  A supertube is a supersymmetric configuration in string theory which occurs\nwhen a pair of branes spontaneously polarizes and generates a new dipole charge\nextended along a closed curve. The dipole charge of a codimension-2 supertube\nis characterized by the U-duality monodromy as one goes around the supertube.\nFor multiple codimension-2 supertubes, their monodromies do not commute in\ngeneral. In this paper, we construct a supersymmetric solution of\nfive-dimensional supergravity that describes two supertubes with such\nnon-Abelian monodromies, in a certain perturbative expansion. In supergravity,\nthe monodromies are realized as the multi-valuedness of the scalar fields,\nwhile in higher dimensions they correspond to non-geometric duality twists of\nthe internal space. The supertubes in our solution carry NS5 and 5$_2^2$ dipole\ncharges and exhibit the same monodromy structure as the SU(2) Seiberg-Witten\ngeometry. The perturbative solution has $\\mathrm{AdS}_2\\times S^2$ asymptotics\nand vanishing four-dimensional angular momentum. We argue that this solution\nrepresents a microstate of four-dimensional black holes with a finite horizon\nand that it provides a clue for the gravity realization of a pure-Higgs branch\nstate in the dual quiver quantum mechanics.\n", "  Bilayer graphene (BLG) offers a rich platform for broken symmetry states\nstabilized by interactions. In this work we study the phase diagram of BLG in\nthe quantum Hall regime at filling factor $\\nu=0$ within the Hartree-Fock\napproximation. In the simplest non-interacting situation this system has eight\n(nearly) degenerate Landau levels near the Fermi energy, characterized by spin,\nvalley, and orbital quantum numbers. We incorporate in our study two effects\nnot previously considered: (i) the nonperturbative effect of trigonal warping\nin the single-particle Hamiltonian, and (ii) short-range SU(4)\nsymmetry-breaking interactions that distinguish the energetics of the orbitals.\nWe find within this model a rich set of phases, including ferromagnetic,\nlayer-polarized, canted antiferromagnetic, Kekul\\'e, a \"spin-valley entangled\"\nstate, and a \"broken U(1) $\\times$ U(1)\" phase. This last state involves\nindependent spontaneous symmetry breaking in the layer and valley degrees of\nfreedom, and has not been previously identified. We present phase diagrams as a\nfunction of interlayer bias $D$ and perpendicular magnetic field $B_{\\perp}$\nfor various interaction and Zeeman couplings, and discuss which are likely to\nbe relevant to BLG in recent measurements. Experimental properties of the\nvarious phases and transitions among them are also discussed.\n", "  A binary neutron star merger produces a rapidly and differentially rotating\ncompact remnant whose lifespan heavily affects the electromagnetic and\ngravitational emissions. Its stability depends on both the equation of state\n(EOS) and the rotation law and it is usually investigated through numerical\nsimulations. Nevertheless, by means of a sufficient criterion for secular\ninstability, equilibrium sequences can be used as a computationally inexpensive\nway to estimate the onset of dynamical instability, which, in general, is close\nto the secular one. This method works well for uniform rotation and relies on\nthe location of turning points: stellar models that are stationary points in a\nsequence of equilibrium solutions with constant rest mass or angular momentum.\nHere, we investigate differentially rotating models (using a large number of\nequations of state and different rotation laws) and find that several universal\nrelations between properly scaled gravitational mass, rest mass and angular\nmomentum of the turning-point models that are valid for uniform rotation, are\ninsensitive to the degree of differential rotation, to high accuracy.\n", "  We explore the structure and star formation history of the open cluster NGC\n2264 (~3 Myr). We combined spectroscopic data from the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES)\nwith multi-wavelength photometry from the Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of\nNGC 2264 (CSI 2264). We examined a sample of 655 cluster members, including\nboth disk-bearing and disk-free young stars. We find a significant age spread\nof 4-5 Myr among cluster members. Disk-bearing objects are statistically\nassociated with younger isochronal ages than disk-free sources. The cluster has\na hierarchical structure, with two main blocks. The northern half develops\naround the O-type binary star S Mon; the southern half, close to the tip of the\nCone Nebula, contains the most embedded regions of NGC 2264, populated mainly\nby objects with disks and ongoing accretion. The median ages of objects at\ndifferent locations within the cluster, and the spatial distribution of disked\nand non-disked sources, suggest that star formation began in the north of the\ncluster, over 5 Myr ago, and was ignited in its southern region a few Myr\nlater. Star formation is likely still ongoing in the most embedded regions of\nthe cluster, while the outer regions host a widespread population of more\nevolved objects. We find a detectable lag between the typical age of\ndisk-bearing objects and that of accreting objects in the inner regions of NGC\n2264: the first tend to be older than the second, but younger than disk-free\nsources at similar locations within the cluster. This supports earlier findings\nthat the characteristic timescales of disk accretion are shorter than those of\ndisk dispersal, and smaller than the average age of NGC 2264 (i.e., < 3 Myr).\nAt the same time, disks in the north of the cluster tend to be shorter-lived\n(~2.5 Myr) than elsewhere; this may reflect the impact of massive stars within\nthe region (notably S Mon), that trigger rapid disk dispersal.\n", "  We present high angular resolution multi-wavelength data of the 3C 298\nradio-loud quasar host galaxy (z=1.439) taken using the W.M. Keck Observatory\nOSIRIS integral field spectrograph with adaptive optics, Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3, and\nthe Very Large Array (VLA). Extended emission is detected in the rest-frame\noptical nebular emission lines H$\\beta$, [OIII], H$\\alpha$, [NII], and [SII],\nas well as molecular lines CO (J=3-2) and (J=5-4). Along the path of 3C 298's\nrelativistic jets we detect conical outflows of ionized gas with velocities up\nto 1700 km s$^{-1}$ and outflow rate of 450-1500 M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$. Near the\nspatial center of the conical outflow, CO (J=3-2) emission shows a molecular\ngas disc with a total molecular mass ($\\rm M_{H_{2}}$) of\n6.6$\\pm0.36\\times10^{9}$M$_{\\odot}$. On the molecular disc's blueshifted side\nwe observe a molecular outflow with a rate of 2300 M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$ and\ndepletion time scale of 3 Myr. We detect no narrow H$\\alpha$ emission in the\noutflow regions, suggesting a limit on star formation of 0.3\nM$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$. Quasar driven winds are evacuating the molecular\ngas reservoir thereby directly impacting star formation in the host galaxy. The\nobserved mass of the supermassive black hole is $10^{9.37-9.56}$M$_{\\odot}$ and\nwe determine a dynamical bulge mass of 1-1.7$\\rm\\times10^{10}\\frac{R}{1.6 kpc}$\nM$_{\\odot}$. The bulge mass of 3C 298 resides 2-2.5 orders of magnitude below\nthe expected value from the local M$\\rm_{bulge}-M_{BH}$ relationship. A second\ngalactic disc observed in nebular emission is offset from the quasar by 9 kpc\nsuggesting the system is an intermediate stage merger. These results show that\ngalactic scale negative feedback is occurring early in the merger phase of 3C\n298, well before the coalescence of the galactic nuclei and assembly on the\nlocal relationship.\n", "  Studying extreme events and how they evolve in a changing climate is one of\nthe most important current scientific challenges. Starting from complex climate\nmodels, a key difficulty is to be able to run long enough simulations in order\nto observe those extremely rare events. In physics, chemistry, and biology,\nrare event algorithms have recently been developed to compute probabilities of\nevents that cannot be observed in direct numerical simulations. Here we propose\nsuch an algorithm, specifically designed for extreme heat or cold waves, based\non statistical physics approaches. This gives an improvement of more than two\norders of magnitude in the sampling efficiency. We describe the dynamics of\nevents that would not be observed otherwise. We show that European extreme heat\nwaves are related to a global teleconnection pattern involving North America\nand Asia. This tool opens a full range of studies, so far impossible, aimed at\nassessing quantitatively climate change impacts.\n", "  We have developed a new basis set family, denoted aug-cc-pVnZ-F12 (or\naVnZ-F12 for short), for explicitly correlated calculations. The sets included\nin this family were constructed by supplementing the corresponding cc-pVnZ-F12\nsets with additional diffuse functions on the higher angular momenta (i.e.,\nadditional d-h functions on non-hydrogen atoms, and p-g on hydrogen), optimized\nfor the MP2-F12 energy of the relevant atomic anions. The new basis sets have\nbeen benchmarked against electron affinities of the first- and second-row\natoms, the W4-17 dataset of total atomization energies, the S66 dataset of\nnoncovalent interactions, the BEGDB water clusters subset, and the WATER23\nsubset of the GMTKN24 and GMTKN30 benchmark suites. The aVnZ-F12 basis sets\ndisplayed excellent performance, not just for electron affinities but also for\nnoncovalent interaction energies of neutral and anionic species. Appropriate\nCABS (complementary auxiliary basis sets) were explored for the S66 noncovalent\ninteractions benchmark: between similar-sized basis sets, CABS were found to be\nmore transferable than generally assumed.\n", "  We demonstrate that the compact, thick disc formed in a tidal disruption\nevent may be unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations in the form of the\nPapaloizou-Pringle instability. We show this can lead to rapid redistribution\nof angular momentum that can be parameterised in terms of an effective\nShakura-Sunyaev $\\alpha$ parameter. For remnants that have initially weak\nmagnetic fields, this may be responsible for driving mass accretion prior to\nthe onset of the magneto-rotational instability. For tidal disruptions around a\n$10^6$ M$_{\\odot}$ black hole, the measured accretion rate is super-Eddington\nbut is not sustainable over many orbits. We thus identify a method by which the\ntorus formed in tidal disruption event may be significantly accreted before the\nmagneto-rotational instability is established.\n", "  Star clusters, particularly those objects in the disk-bulge-halo interface\nare as of yet poorly charted, albeit carrying important information about the\nformation and the structure of the Milky Way. Here, we present a detailed\nchemical abundance study of the recently discovered object Gaia 1. Photometry\nhas previously suggested it as an intermediate-age, moderately metal-rich\nsystem, although the exact values for its age and metallicity remained\nambiguous in the literature. We measured detailed chemical abundances of 14\nelements in four red giant members, from high-resolution (R=25000) spectra that\nfirmly establish Gaia 1 as an object associated with the thick disk. The\nresulting mean Fe abundance is $-0.62\\pm$0.03(stat.)$\\pm$0.10(sys.) dex, which\nis more metal-poor than indicated by previous spectroscopy from the literature,\nbut it is fully in line with values from isochrone fitting. We find that Gaia 1\nis moderately enhanced in the $\\alpha$-elements, which allowed us to\nconsolidate its membership with the thick disk via chemical tagging. The\ncluster's Fe-peak and neutron-capture elements are similar to those found\nacross the metal-rich disks, where the latter indicate some level of\n$s$-process activity. No significant spread in iron nor in other heavy elements\nwas detected, whereas we find evidence of light-element variations in Na, Mg,\nand Al. Nonetheless, the traditional Na-O and Mg-Al (anti-)correlations,\ntypically seen in old globular clusters, are not seen in our data. This\nconfirms that Gaia 1 is rather a massive and luminous open cluster than a\nlow-mass globular cluster. Finally, orbital computations of the target stars\nbolster our chemical findings of Gaia 1's present-day membership with the thick\ndisk, even though it remains unclear, which mechanisms put it in that place.\n", "  It was shown by Jacobson in 1995 that the Einstein equation can be derived as\na local constitutive equation for an equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics. With\nthe aim to understand if such thermodynamical description is an intrinsic\nproperty of gravitation, many attempts have been done so far to generalise this\ntreatment to a broader class of gravitational theories. Here we consider the\ncase of the Einstein-Cartan theory as a prototype of theories with\nnon-propagating torsion. In doing so, we study the properties of Killing\nhorizons in the presence of torsion, establish the notion of local causal\nhorizon in Riemann-Cartan spacetimes, and derive the generalised Raychaudhuri\nequation for this kind of geometries. Then, starting with the entropy that can\nbe associated to these local causal horizons, we derive the Einstein-Cartan\nequation by implementing the Clausius equation. We outline two ways of\nproceeding with the derivation depending on whether we take torsion as a\ngeometric field or as a matter field. In both cases we need to add internal\nentropy production terms to the Clausius equation as the shear and twist cannot\nbe taken to be zero a priori for our setup. This fact implies the necessity of\na non-equilibrium thermodynamics treatment for the local causal horizon.\nFurthermore, it implies that a non-zero twist at the horizon will in general\ncontribute to the Hartle-Hawking tidal heating for black holes with possible\nimplications for future observations.\n", "  The large-scale computer simulation of a system of physical fields governed\nby partial differential equations requires some means of approximating the\nmathematical limit of continuity. For example, conservation laws are often\ntreated with a `finite-volume' approach in which space is partitioned into a\nlarge number of small `cells,' with fluxes through cell faces providing an\nintuitive discretization modeled on the mathematical definition of the\ndivergence operator. Here we describe and make available Fortran 2003 classes\nfurnishing extensible object-oriented implementations of simple meshes and the\nevolution of generic conserved currents thereon, along with individual `unit\ntest' programs and larger example problems demonstrating their use. These\nclasses inaugurate the Mathematics division of our developing astrophysics\nsimulation code GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System), which will\nbe expanded over time to include additional meshing options, mathematical\noperations, solver types, and solver variations appropriate for many\nmultiphysics applications.\n", "  The unprecedented depth and area surveyed by the Subaru Strategic Program\nwith the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC-SSP) have enabled us to construct and publish\nthe largest distant cluster sample out to $z\\sim 1$ to date. In this\nexploratory study of cluster galaxy evolution from $z=1$ to $z=0.3$, we\ninvestigate the stellar mass assembly history of brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCGs), evolution of stellar mass and luminosity distributions, stellar mass\nsurface density profile, as well as the population of radio galaxies. Our\nanalysis is the first high redshift application of the top N richest cluster\nselection, which is shown to allow us to trace the cluster galaxy evolution\nfaithfully. Over the 230 deg$^2$ area of the current HSC-SSP footprint,\nselecting the top 100 clusters in each of the 4 redshift bins allows us to\nobserve the buildup of galaxy population in descendants of clusters whose\n$z\\approx 1$ mass is about $2\\times 10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$. Our stellar mass is\nderived from a machine-learning algorithm, which is found to be unbiased and\naccurate with respect to the COSMOS data. We find very mild stellar mass growth\nin BCGs (about 35% between $z=1$ and 0.3), and no evidence for evolution in\nboth the total stellar mass-cluster mass correlation and the shape of the\nstellar mass surface density profile. We also present the first measurement of\nthe radio luminosity distribution in clusters out to $z\\sim 1$, and show hints\nof changes in the dominant accretion mode powering the cluster radio galaxies\nat $z\\sim 0.8$.\n", "  The microscopic theory of superconductivity raised the disruptive idea that\nelectrons couple through the elusive exchange of virtual phonons, overcoming\nthe strong Coulomb repulsion to form Cooper pairs. Light is also known to\ninteract with atomic vibrations, as for example in the Raman effect. We show\nthat photon pairs exchange virtual vibrations in transparent media, leading to\nan effective photon-photon interaction identical to that for electrons in BCS\ntheory of supercondutivity, in spite of the fact that photons are bosons. In\nthis scenario, photons may exchange energy without matching a quantum of\nvibration of the medium. As a result, pair correlations for photons scattered\naway from the Raman resonances are expected to be enhanced. Experimental\ndemonstration of this effect is provided here by time correlated Raman\nmeasurements in different media. The experimental data confirm our theoretical\ninterpretation of a photonic Cooper pairing, without the need for any fitting\nparameters.\n", "  We study the dynamical behaviour of gauge-invariant linear perturbations in\nspherically symmetric dust cosmologies including a cosmological constant. In\ncontrast to spatially homogeneous FLRW models, the reduced degree of spatial\nsymmetry causes a non-trivial dynamical coupling of gauge-invariant quantities\nalready at first order perturbation theory and the strength and influence of\nthis coupling on the spacetime evolution is investigated here. We present\nresults on the underlying dynamical equations augmented by a cosmological\nconstant and integrate them numerically. We also present a method to derive\ncosmologically relevant initial variables for this setup. Estimates of angular\npower spectra for each metric variable are computed and evaluated on the\ncentral observer's past null cone. By comparing the full evolution to the\nfreely evolved initial profiles, the coupling strength will be determined for a\nbest fit radially inhomogeneous patch obtained in previous works (see Redlich\net. al. (2014)). We find that coupling effects are not noticeable within the\ncosmic variance limit and can therefore safely be neglected for a relevant\ncosmological scenario. On the contrary, we find very strong coupling effects in\na best fit spherical void model matching the distance redshift relation of SNe\nwhich is in accordance with previous findings using parametric void models.\n", "  We present the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances of up to\n10 chemical species in a sample of 59 very metal-poor (VMP, -4 < [Fe/H] < -2)\nstars in seven dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and in the Milky Way (MW)\nhalo. Our results are based on high-resolution spectroscopic datasets and\nhomogeneous and accurate atmospheric parameters determined in PaperI. We show\nthat once the NLTE effects are properly taken into account, all massive\ngalaxies in our sample, that is, the MW halo and the classical dSphs Sculptor,\nUrsa Minor, Sextans, and Fornax, reveal a similar plateau at [alpha/Fe] ~ 0.3\nfor each of the alpha-process elements: Mg, Ca, and Ti. We put on a firm ground\nthe evidence for a decline in alpha/Fe with increasing metallicity in the\nBootesI ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD), that is most probably due to the ejecta\nof type Ia supernovae. For Na/Fe, Na/Mg, and Al/Mg, the MW halo and all dSphs\nreveal indistinguishable trends with metallicity, suggesting that the processes\nof Na and Al synthesis are identical in all systems, independent of their mass.\nThe dichotomy in the [Sr/Ba] versus [Ba/H] diagram is observed in the classical\ndSphs, similarly to the MW halo, calling for two different nucleosynthesis\nchannels for Sr. We show that Sr in the massive galaxies is well correlated\nwith Mg suggesting a strong link to massive stars and that its production is\nessentially independent of Ba, for most of the [Ba/H] range. Our three UFDs:\nBootesI, UMaII, and LeoIV are depleted in Sr and Ba relative to Fe and Mg, with\nvery similar ratios of [Sr/Mg] ~ -1.3 and [Ba/Mg] ~ -1 on the entire range of\ntheir Mg abundances. The subsolar Sr/Ba ratios of Bootes I and UMa II indicate\na common r-process origin of their neutron-capture elements. Sculptor remains\nthe classical dSph, in which the evidence for inhomogeneous mixing in the early\nevolution stage, at [Fe/H] < -2, is the strongest.\n", "  In this paper we study the Einstein-Boltzmann system for Israel particles\nwith a positive cosmological constant. We consider spatially homogeneous\nsolutions of Bianchi types except IX and obtain future global existence and\nasymptotic behaviour of solutions to the Einstein-Boltzmann system. The result\nshows that the solutions converge to the de Sitter solution at late times.\n", "  The chemical and physical properties of interstellar dust in the densest\nregions of the Galaxy are still not well understood. X-rays provide a powerful\nprobe since they can penetrate gas and dust over a wide range of column\ndensities (up to $10^{24}\\ \\rm{cm}^{-2}$). The interaction (scattering and\nabsorption) with the medium imprints spectral signatures that reflect the\nindividual atoms which constitute the gas, molecule, or solid. In this work we\ninvestigate the ability of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy to probe the\nproperties of cosmic grains containing iron. Although iron is heavily depleted\ninto interstellar dust, the nature of the Fe-bearing grains is still largely\nuncertain. In our analysis we use iron K-edge synchrotron data of minerals\nlikely present in the ISM dust taken at the European Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility. We explore the prospects of determining the chemical composition and\nthe size of astrophysical dust in the Galactic centre and in molecular clouds\nwith future X-ray missions. The energy resolution and the effective area of the\npresent X-ray telescopes are not sufficient to detect and study the Fe K-edge,\neven for bright X-ray sources. From the analysis of the extinction cross\nsections of our dust models implemented in the spectral fitting program SPEX,\nthe Fe K-edge is promising for investigating both the chemistry and the size\ndistribution of the interstellar dust. We find that the chemical composition\nregulates the X-ray absorption fine structures in the post edge region, whereas\nthe scattering feature in the pre-edge is sensitive to the mean grain size.\nFinally, we note that the Fe K-edge is insensitive to other dust properties,\nsuch as the porosity and the geometry of the dust.\n", "  We present the results of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of\nthe Weibel instability in two counter-streaming hot relativistic plasma flows,\ne.g. flows of electron-proton plasma having rest-mass density $\\rho \\sim\n10^{-4}\\; \\text{g}\\, \\text{cm}^{-3}$, Lorentz factors $\\Gamma \\sim 10$ and\nproper temperature $T \\sim 10^{13}\\; \\text{K}$. The instability growth rate and\nthe filament size at the linear stage are found analytically, and are in\nqualitative agreement with results of three-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations. In the simulations, incoherent synchrotron emission and pair\nphotoproduction in electromagnetic fields are taken into account. If the plasma\nflows are dense, fast and/or hot enough, the overall energy of synchrotron\nphotons can be much larger than the energy of generated electromagnetic fields.\nFurthermore, a sizable number of positrons can be produced due to the pair\nphotoproduction in the generated magnetic field. We propose a rough criterion\nfor judging copious pair production and synchrotron losses. By means of this\ncriterion we conclude that incoherent synchrotron emission and pair production\nduring the Weibel instability can have implications for the collapsar model of\ngamma-ray bursts.\n", "  Like most perovskites, SrRuO$_3$ exhibits structural phase transitions\nassociated with rotations of the RuO$_6$ octahedra. The application of moderate\nmagnetic fields in the ferromagnetically ordered state allows one to fully\ncontrol these structural distortions, although the ferromagnetic order occurs\nat six times lower temperature than the structural distortion. Our neutron\ndiffraction and macroscopic measurements unambiguously show that magnetic\nfields rearrange structural domains, and that for the field along a cubic\n[110]$_c$ direction a fully detwinned crystal is obtained. Subsequent heating\nabove the Curie temperature causes a magnetic shape-memory effect, where the\ninitial structural domains recover.\n", "  We calculate the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) in Euclidean\nasymptotic AdS3 spacetime using surgery. The treatment is intrinsically\nthree-dimensional. In the BTZ black hole background, several different\nbipartitions are applied. For the bipartition along the horizon between two\nsingle-sided black holes, TEE is exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which\nsupports the ER=EPR conjecture in the Euclidean case. For other bipartitions,\nwe derive an Entangling-Thermal relation for each single-sided black hole,\nwhich is of topological origin. After summing over genus-one classical\ngeometries, we compute TEE in the high-temperature regime. In the case where\nk=1, we find that TEE is the same as that for a Moonshine double state, given\nby the maximally-entangled superposition of 194 types of \"anyons\" in the 3d\nbulk, labeled by the irreducible representations of the Monster group. We\npropose this as the bulk analogue of the thermofield double state in the\nEuclidean spacetime. Comparing the TEE between thermal AdS3 and BTZ solutions,\nwe discuss the implication of TEE on the Hawking-Page transition in 3d.\n", "  There are a growing number of nearby SNe for which the progenitor star is\ndetected in archival pre-explosion imaging. From these images it is possible to\nmeasure the progenitor's brightness a few years before explosion, and\nultimately estimate its initial mass. Previous work has shown that II-P and\nII-L supernovae (SNe) have Red Supergiant (RSG) progenitors, and that the range\nof initial masses for these progenitors seems to be limited to $<$17M$_\\odot$.\nThis is in contrast with the cutoff of 25-30M$_\\odot$ predicted by evolutionary\nmodels, a result which is termed the 'Red Supergiant Problem'. Here we\ninvestigate one particular source of systematic error present in converting\npre-explosion photometry into an initial mass, that of the bolometric\ncorrection (BC) used to convert a single-band flux into a bolometric\nluminosity. We show, using star clusters, that RSGs evolve to later spectral\ntypes as they approach SN, which in turn causes the BC to become larger.\nFailure to account for this results in a systematic underestimate of a star's\nluminosity, and hence its initial mass. Using our empirically motivated BCs we\nreappraise the II-P and II-L SNe that have their progenitors detected in\npre-explosion imaging. Fitting an initial mass function to these updated masses\nresults in an increased upper mass cutoff of $M_{\\rm\nhi}$=$19.0^{+2.5}_{-1.3}$M$_\\odot$, with a 95% upper confidence limit of\n$<$27M$_\\odot$. Accounting for finite sample size effects and systematic\nuncertainties in the mass-luminosity relationship raises the cutoff to $M_{\\rm\nhi}$=25M$_\\odot$ ($<$33M$_\\odot$, 95% confidence). We therefore conclude that\nthere is currently no strong evidence for `missing' high mass progenitors to\ncore-collapse SNe.\n", "  We study the properties of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs)\nwith sine-square deformation (SSD). We show that there are no eigenstates of\nfinite norm for the Hamiltonian of a unitary CFT with SSD, except for the\nzero-energy vacuum state $|0\\rangle$. We then introduce a regularized version\nof the SSD Hamiltonian which is related to the undeformed Hamiltonian via a\nunitary transformation corresponding to the Mobius quantization. The unitary\nequivalence of the two Hamiltonians allows us to obtain zero-energy states of\nthe deformed Hamiltonian in a systematic way. The regularization also provides\na way to compute the expectation values of observables in zero-energy states\nthat are not necessarily normalizable.\n", "  V746 Cas is known to be a triple system composed of a close binary with an\nalternatively reported period of either 25.4d or 27.8d and a third component in\na 62000d orbit. The object was also reported to exhibit multiperiodic light\nvariations with periods from 0.83d to 2.50d, on the basis of which it was\nclassified as a slowly pulsating B star. Interest in further investigation of\nthis system was raised by the detection of a variable magnetic field. Analysing\nspectra from four instruments, earlier published radial velocities, and several\nsets of photometric observations, we arrived at the following conclusions: (1)\nThe optical spectrum is dominated by the lines of the B-type primary\n(Teff1~16500(100) K), contributing 70% of the light in the optical region, and\na slightly cooler B tertiary (Teff3~13620(150) K). The lines of the low-mass\nsecondary are below our detection threshold; we estimate that it could be a\nnormal A or F star. (2) We resolved the ambiguity in the value of the inner\nbinary period and arrived at a linear ephemeris of T_super.conj.=HJD\n2443838.78(81)+25.41569(42)xE. (3) The intensity of the magnetic field\nundergoes a~sinusoidal variation in phase with one of the known photometric\nperiods, namely 2.503867(19)d, which we identify with the rotational period of\nthe tertiary. (4) The second photometric 1.0649524(40)d period is identified\nwith the rotational period of the B-type primary, but this interpretation is\nmuch less certain and needs further verification. (5) If our interpretation of\nphotometric periods is confirmed, the classification of the object as a slowly\npulsating B star should be revised. (6) Applying an N-body model to different\ntypes of available observational data, we constrain the orbital inclination of\nthe inner orbit to ~60 deg to 85 deg even in the absence of eclipses, and\nestimate the probable properties of the triple system and its components.\n", "  CONTEXT. It is theoretically possible for rings to have formed around\nextrasolar planets in a similar way to that in which they formed around the\ngiant planets in our solar system. However, no such rings have been detected to\ndate.\n  AIMS: We aim to test the possibility of detecting rings around exoplanets by\ninvestigating the photometric and spectroscopic ring signatures in\nhigh-precision transit signals.\n  METHODS: The photometric and spectroscopic transit signals of a ringed planet\nis expected to show deviations from that of a spherical planet. We used these\ndeviations to quantify the detectability of rings. We present SOAP3.0 which is\na numerical tool to simulate ringed planet transits and measure ring\ndetectability based on amplitudes of the residuals between the ringed planet\nsignal and best fit ringless model.\n  RESULTS: We find that it is possible to detect the photometric and\nspectroscopic signature of near edge-on rings especially around planets with\nhigh impact parameter. Time resolution $\\leq$ 7 mins is required for the\nphotometric detection, while 15 mins is sufficient for the spectroscopic\ndetection. We also show that future instruments like CHEOPS and ESPRESSO, with\nprecisions that allow ring signatures to be well above their noise-level,\npresent good prospects for detecting rings.\n", "  We present spectroscopic follow-up observations of CR7 with ALMA, targeted at\nconstraining the infrared (IR) continuum and [CII]$_{158 \\mu \\rm m}$\nline-emission at high spatial resolution matched to the HST/WFC3 imaging. CR7\nis a luminous Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxy at $z=6.6$ that consists of three\nseparated UV-continuum components. Our observations reveal several\nwell-separated components of [CII] emission. The two most luminous components\nin [CII] coincide with the brightest UV components (A and B), blue-shifted by\n$\\approx 150$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the peak of Ly$\\alpha$ emission.\nOther [CII] components are observed close to UV clumps B and C and are\nblue-shifted by $\\approx300$ and $\\approx80$ km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the\nsystemic redshift. We do not detect FIR continuum emission due to dust with a\n3$\\sigma$ limiting luminosity L$_{\\rm IR} (T_d = 35 \\rm \\, K) <\n3.1\\times10^{10}$ L$_{\\odot}$. This allows us to mitigate uncertainties in the\ndust-corrected SFR and derive SFRs for the three UV clumps A, B and C of 28, 5\nand 7 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. All clumps have [CII] luminosities consistent\nwithin the scatter observed in the local relation between SFR and L$_{\\rm\n[CII]}$, implying that strong Ly$\\alpha$ emission does not necessarily\nanti-correlate with [CII] luminosity. Combining our measurements with the\nliterature, we show that galaxies with blue UV slopes have weaker [CII]\nemission at fixed SFR, potentially due to their lower metallicities and/or\nhigher photoionisation. Comparison with hydrodynamical simulations suggests\nthat CR7's clumps have metallicities of $0.1<\\rm Z/Z_{\\odot}<0.2$. The observed\nISM structure of CR7 indicates that we are likely witnessing the build up of a\ncentral galaxy in the early Universe through complex accretion of satellites.\n", "  We report measurements of the dynamics of isolated $^{8}$Li$^{+}$ in single\ncrystal rutile TiO$_{2}$ using $\\beta$-detected NMR. From spin-lattice\nrelaxation and motional narrowing, we find two sets of thermally activated\ndynamics: one below 100 K; and one at higher temperatures. At low temperature,\nthe activation barrier is $26.8(6)$ meV with prefactor $1.23(5) \\times 10^{10}$\ns$^{-1}$. We suggest this is unrelated to Li$^{+}$ motion, and rather is a\nconsequence of electron polarons in the vicinity of the implanted\n$^{8}$Li$^{+}$ that are known to become mobile in this temperature range. Above\n100 K, Li$^{+}$ undergoes long-range diffusion as an isolated uncomplexed\ncation, characterized by an activation energy and prefactor of $0.32(2)$ eV and\n$1.0(5) \\times 10^{16}$ s$^{-1}$, in agreement with macroscopic diffusion\nmeasurements. These results in the dilute limit from a microscopic probe\nindicate that Li$^{+}$ concentration does not limit the diffusivity even up to\nhigh concentrations, but that some key ingredient is missing in the\ncalculations of the migration barrier. The anomalous prefactors provide further\ninsight into both Li$^{+}$ and polaron motion.\n", "  Direct detection of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) via the red-shifted 21-cm\nline will have unprecedented implications on the study of structure formation\nin the infant Universe. To fulfill this promise, current and future 21-cm\nexperiments need to detect this weak EoR signal in the presence of foregrounds\nthat are several orders of magnitude larger. This requires extreme noise\ncontrol and improved wide-field high dynamic-range imaging techniques. We\npropose a new imaging method based on a maximum likelihood framework which\nsolves for the interferometric equation directly on the sphere, or equivalently\nin the $uvw$-domain. The method uses the one-to-one relation between spherical\nwaves and spherical harmonics (SpH). It consistently handles signals from the\nentire sky, and does not require a $w$-term correction. The spherical-harmonics\ncoefficients represent the sky-brightness distribution and the visibilities in\nthe $uvw$-domain, and provide a direct estimate of the spatial power spectrum.\nUsing these spectrally-smooth SpH coefficients, bright foregrounds can be\nremoved from the signal, including their side-lobe noise, which is one of the\nlimiting factors in high dynamics range wide-field imaging. Chromatic effects\ncausing the so-called \"wedge\" are effectively eliminated (i.e. deconvolved) in\nthe cylindrical ($k_{\\perp}, k_{\\parallel}$) power spectrum, compared to a\npower spectrum computed directly from the images of the foreground visibilities\nwhere the wedge is clearly present. We illustrate our method using simulated\nLOFAR observations, finding an excellent reconstruction of the input EoR signal\nwith minimal bias.\n", "  Though usually treated in isolation, the magnetorotational and gravitational\ninstabilities (MRI and GI) may coincide at certain radii and evolutionary\nstages of protoplanetary discs and active galactic nuclei. Their mutual\ninteractions could profoundly influence several important processes, such as\naccretion variability and outbursts, fragmentation and disc truncation, or\nlarge-scale magnetic field production. Direct numerical simulations of both\ninstabilities are computationally challenging and remain relatively unexplored.\nIn this paper, we aim to redress this neglect via a set of 3D vertically\nstratified shearing-box simulations, combining self-gravity and magnetic\nfields. We show that gravito-turbulence greatly weakens the zero-net-flux MRI.\nIn the limit of efficient cooling (and thus enhanced GI), the MRI is completely\nsuppressed, and yet strong magnetic fields are sustained by the\ngravitoturbulence. This turbulent `spiral wave' dynamo may have widespread\napplication, especially in galactic discs. Finally, we present preliminary work\nshowing that a strong net-vertical-flux revives the MRI and supports a\nmagnetically dominated state, in which the GI is secondary.\n", "  We present the discovery of the giant planet KELT-19Ab, which transits the\nmoderately bright $(\\mathrm{V} \\sim 9.9)$ A8V star TYC 764-1494-1 with an\norbital period of 4.61 days. We confirm the planetary nature of the companion\nvia a combination of radial velocities, which limit the mass to $<\n4.1\\,\\mathrm{M_J}$ $(3\\sigma)$, and a clear Doppler tomography signal, which\nindicates a retrograde projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\\lambda =\n-179.7^{+3.7}_{-3.8}$ degrees. Global modeling indicates that the $\\rm{T_{eff}}\n=7500 \\pm 110\\,\\mathrm{K}$ host star has $\\mathrm{M_*} =\n1.62^{+0.25}_{-0.20}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $\\mathrm{R_*} = 1.83 \\pm\n0.10\\,\\mathrm{R_\\odot}$. The planet has a radius of $\\mathrm{R_P}=1.91 \\pm\n0.11\\,\\mathrm{R_J}$ and receives a stellar insolation flux of $\\sim 3.2\\times\n10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}}$, leading to an inferred equilibrium\ntemperature of $\\rm{T_{EQ}} = \\sim 1935\\,\\rm{K}$ assuming zero albedo and\ncomplete heat redistribution. With a $v\\sin{I_*}=84.8\\pm\n2.0\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$, the host is relatively slowly rotating compared to\nother stars with similar effective temperatures, and it appears to be enhanced\nin metallic elements but deficient in calcium, suggesting that it is likely an\nAm star. KELT-19A would be the first detection of an Am host of a transiting\nplanet of which we are aware. Adaptive optics observations of the system reveal\nthe existence of a companion with late G9V/early K1V spectral type at a\nprojected separation of $\\approx 160\\,\\mathrm{AU}$. Radial velocity\nmeasurements indicate that this companion is bound. Most Am stars are known to\nhave stellar companions, which are often invoked to explain the relatively slow\nrotation of the primary. In this case, the stellar companion is unlikely to\nhave caused the tidal braking of the primary. However, it may have emplaced the\ntransiting planetary companion via the Kozai-Lidov mechanism.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally that the long-range hydrodynamic interactions\nin an incompressible quasi 2D isotropic fluid result in an anisotropic viscous\ndrag acting on elongated particles. The anisotropy of the drag is increasing\nwith increasing ratio of the particle length to the hydrodynamic scale given by\nthe Saffman-Delbr\\\"uck length. The micro-rheology data for translational and\nrotational drags collected over three orders of magnitude of the effective\nparticle length demonstrate the validity of the current theoretical approaches\nto the hydrodynamics in restricted geometry. The results also demonstrate\ncrossovers between the hydrodynamical regimes determined by the characteristic\nlength scales.\n", "  Lifetimes of complexes formed during ultracold collisions are of current\nexperimental interest as a possible cause of trap loss in ultracold gases of\nalkali-dimers. Microsecond lifetimes for complexes formed during ultracold\nelastic collisions of K2 with Rb are reported, from numerically-exact\nquantum-scattering calculations. The reported lifetimes are compared with those\ncalculated using a simple density-of-states approach, which are shown to be\nreasonable. Long-lived complexes correspond to narrow scattering resonances\nwhich we examine for the statistical signatures of quantum chaos, finding that\nthe positions and widths of the resonances follow the Wigner-Dyson and\nPorter-Thomas distributions respectively.\n", "  We mapped the kinetic temperature structure of the Orion molecular cloud 1\nwith para-H2CO(303-202, 322-221, and 321-220) using the APEX 12m telescope.\nThis is compared with the temperatures derived from the ratio of the\nNH3(2,2)/(1,1) inversion lines and the dust emission. Using the RADEX non-LTE\nmodel, we derive the gas kinetic temperature modeling the measured averaged\nline ratios of para-H2CO 322-221/303-202 and 321-220/303-202. The gas kinetic\ntemperatures derived from the para-H2CO line ratios are warm, ranging from 30\nto >200 K with an average of 62 K at a spatial density of 10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$.\nThese temperatures are higher than those obtained from NH3(2,2)/(1,1) and\nCH3CCH(6-5) in the OMC-1 region. The gas kinetic temperatures derived from\npara-H2CO agree with those obtained from warm dust components measured in the\nmid infrared (MIR), which indicates that the para-H2CO(3-2) ratios trace dense\nand warm gas. The cold dust components measured in the far infrared (FIR) are\nconsistent with those measured with NH3(2,2)/(1,1) and the CH3CCH(6-5) line\nseries. With dust at MIR wavelengths and para-H2CO(3-2) on one side and dust at\nFIR wavelengths, NH3(2,2)/(1,1), and CH3CCH(6-5) on the other, dust and gas\ntemperatures appear to be equivalent in the dense gas of the OMC-1 region, but\nprovide a bimodal distribution, one more directly related to star formation\nthan the other. The non-thermal velocity dispersions of para-H2CO are\npositively correlated with the gas kinetic temperatures in regions of strong\nnon-thermal motion (Mach number >2.5) of the OMC-1, implying that the higher\ntemperature traced by para-H2CO is related to turbulence on a 0.06 pc scale.\nCombining the temperature measurements with para-H2CO and NH3(2,2)/(1,1) line\nratios, we find direct evidence for the dense gas along the northern part of\nthe OMC-1 10 km s$^{-1}$ filament heated by radiation from the central Orion\nnebula.\n", "  Context: In the last six years, the VVV survey mapped 562 sq. deg. across the\nbulge and southern disk of the Galaxy. However, a detailed study of these\nregions, which includes $\\sim 36$ globular clusters (GCs) and thousands of open\nclusters is by no means an easy challenge. High differential reddening and\nsevere crowding along the line of sight makes highly hamper to reliably\ndistinguish stars belonging to different populations and/or systems. Aims: The\naim of this study is to separate stars that likely belong to the Galactic GC\nNGC 6544 from its surrounding field by means of proper motion (PM) techniques.\nMethods: This work was based upon a new astrometric reduction method optimized\nfor images of the VVV survey. Results: Photometry over the six years baseline\nof the survey allowed us to obtain a mean precision of $\\sim0.51$ mas/yr, in\neach PM coordinate, for stars with Ks < 15 mag. In the area studied here,\ncluster stars separate very well from field stars, down to the main sequence\nturnoff and below, allowing us to derive for the first time the absolute PM of\nNGC 6544. Isochrone fitting on the clean and differential reddening corrected\ncluster color magnitude diagram yields an age of $\\sim$ 11-13 Gyr, and\nmetallicity [Fe/H] = -1.5 dex, in agreement with previous studies restricted to\nthe cluster core. We were able to derive the cluster orbit assuming an\naxisymmetric model of the Galaxy and conclude that NGC 6544 is likely a halo\nGC. We have not detected tidal tail signatures associated to the cluster, but a\nremarkable elongation in the galactic center direction has been found. The\nprecision achieved in the PM determination also allows us to separate bulge\nstars from foreground disk stars, enabling the kinematical selection of bona\nfide bulge stars across the whole survey area. Our results show that VVV data\nis perfectly suitable for this kind of analysis.\n", "  We estimate the smallest branching ratio for the Higgs decay channel $h\n\\rightarrow \\mu \\tau$, which can be probed at an $e^+e^-$ collider and compare\nit with the projected reach at the high-luminosity run of the LHC. Using a\nmodel-independent approach, Higgs production is considered in two separate\ncases. In the first case, $hWW$ and $hZZ$ couplings are allowed to be scaled by\na factor allowed by the latest experimental limits on $hWW$ and $hZZ$\ncouplings. In the second case, we have introduced higher-dimensional effective\noperators for these interaction vertices. Keeping BR($h\\to\\mu\\tau$) as a purely\nphenomenological quantity, we find that this branching ratio can be probed down\nto $\\approx 2.69\\times 10^{-3}$ and $\\approx 5.83\\times 10^{-4}$ respectively,\nat the 250 GeV and 1000 GeV run of an $e^+e^-$ collider.\n", "  We study a gauged $B-L$ extension of the standard model where the new\nfermions with fractional $B-L$ charges that play the role of keeping the model\nanomaly free can also explain the origin of neutrino mass at one loop level as\nwell as dark matter. We discuss two different versions of the model to realise\nfermion and scalar dark matter, both of which guarantee the dark matter\nstability by a remnant discrete symmetry to which $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge symmetry\ngets spontaneously broken down to. Apart from giving rise to the observed\nneutrino mass and dark matter abundance, the model also has tantalising\nsignatures at variety of experiments operating at cosmic, intensity and energy\nfrontiers, particularly direct and indirect detection experiments of dark\nmatter, rare decay experiments looking for charged lepton flavour violation as\nwell as collider experiments. The model also predicts vanishing lightest\nneutrino mass that can be tested at experiments sensitive to the absolute\nneutrino mass scale.\n", "  We present microlensing planet OGLE-2017-BLG-0173Lb, with planet-host mass\nratio either $q\\simeq 2.5\\times 10^{-5}$ or $q\\simeq 6.5\\times 10^{-5}$, the\nlowest or among the lowest ever detected. The planetary perturbation is\nstrongly detected, $\\Delta\\chi^2\\sim 10,000$, because it arises from a bright\n(therefore, large) source passing over and enveloping the planetary caustic: a\nso-called \"Hollywood\" event. The factor $\\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ arises because\nof a previously unrecognized discrete degeneracy between Hollywood events in\nwhich the caustic is fully enveloped and those in which only one flank is\nenveloped, which we dub \"Cannae\" and \"von Schlieffen\", respectively. This\ndegeneracy is \"accidental\" in that it arises from gaps in the data.\nNevertheless, the fact that it appears in a $\\Delta\\chi^2=10,000$ planetary\nanomaly is striking. We present a simple formalism to estimate the sensitivity\nof other Hollywood events to planets and show that they can lead to detections\nclose to, but perhaps not quite reaching, the Earth/Sun mass ratio of $3\\times\n10^{-6}$. This formalism also enables an analytic understanding of the factor\n$\\sim 2.5$ offset in $q$ between the Cannae and von Schlieffen solutions. The\nBayesian estimates for the host-mass, system distance, and planet-host\nprojected separation are $M=0.39^{+0.40}_{-0.24}\\,M_\\odot$,\n$D_L=4.8^{+1.5}_{-1.8}\\,\\kpc$, and $a_\\perp=3.8\\pm 1.6\\,\\au$. The two estimates\nof the planet mass are $m_p=3.3^{+3.8}_{-2.1}\\,M_\\oplus$ and\n$m_p=8^{+11}_{-6}\\,M_\\oplus$. The measured lens-source relative proper motion\n$\\mu=6\\,\\masyr$ will permit imaging of the lens in about 15 years or at first\nlight on adaptive-optics imagers on next-generation telescopes. These will\nallow to measure the host mass but probably cannot resolve the planet-host\nmass-ratio degeneracy.\n", "  We present a multi-polytrope approach to describe high-mass twins fulfilling\nchiral effective field theory estimations of the neutron star equation state\nand test it against the appearance of mixed phases at the hadron-quark\ninterface. In addition, we discuss astrophysical applications of this method\nand expected future measurements that shall further constrain neutron star\nmatter and the understanding of the QCD phase diagram.\n", "  We explore the physics of relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMSs) in\nthe regime where photon advection dominates over photon generation. For this\npurpose, a novel iterative method for deriving a self-consistent steady-state\nstructure of RRMS is developed, based on a Monte-Carlo code that solves the\ntransfer of photons subject to Compton scattering and pair\nproduction/annihilation. Systematic study is performed by imposing various\nupstream conditions which are characterized by the following three parameters:\nthe photon-to-baryon inertia ratio $\\xi_{u *}$, the photon-to-baryon number\nratio $\\tilde{n}$, and the shock Lorentz factor $\\gamma_u$. We find that the\nproperties of RRMSs vary considerably with these parameters. In particular,\nwhile a smooth decline in the velocity, accompanied by a gradual temperature\nincrease is seen for $\\xi_{u*} \\gg 1$, an efficient bulk Comptonization, that\nleads to a heating precursor, is found for $\\xi_{u*} \\lesssim 1$. As a\nconsequence, although particle acceleration is highly inefficient in these\nshocks, a broad non-thermal spectrum is produced in the latter case. The\ngeneration of high energy photons through bulk Comptonization leads, in certain\ncases, to a copious production of pairs that provide the dominant opacity for\nCompton scattering. We also find that for certain upstream conditions a weak\nsubshock appears within the flow. For a choice of parameters suitable to\ngamma-ray bursts, the radiation spectrum within the shock is found to be\ncompatible with that of the prompt emission, suggesting that subphotospheric\nshocks may give rise to the observed non-thermal features despite the absence\nof accelerated particles.\n", "  We study the stochastic thermodynamics of resetting systems. Violation of\nmicroreversibility means that the well known derivations of fluctuations\ntheorems break down for dynamics with resetting. Despite that we show that\nstochastic resetting systems satisfy two integral fluctuation theorems. The\nfirst is the Hatano-Sasa relation describing the transition between two steady\nstates. The second integral fluctuation theorem involves a functional that\nincludes both dynamical and thermodynamic contributions. We find that the\nsecond law-like inequality found by Fuchs et al. for resetting systems [EPL,\n113, (2016)] can be recovered from this integral fluctuation theorem with the\nhelp of Jensen's inequality.\n", "  Aims. We use accurate data on distances and radial velocities of galaxies\naround the Local Group, as well as around 14 other massive nearby groups, to\nestimate their radius of the zero-velocity surface, $R_0$, which separates any\ngroup against the global cosmic expansion.\n  Methods. Our $R_0$ estimate was based on fitting the data to the velocity\nfield expected from the spherical infall model, including effects of the\ncosmological constant. The reported uncertainties were derived by a Monte Carlo\nsimulation.\n  Results. Testing various assumptions about a location of the group\nbarycentre, we found the optimal estimates of the radius to be\n$0.91\\pm0.05$~Mpc for the Local Group, and $0.93\\pm0.02$~Mpc for a synthetic\ngroup stacked from 14 other groups in the Local Volume. Under the standard\nPlanck model parameters, these quantities correspond to the total mass of the\ngroup $\\sim (1.6\\pm0.2) 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$. Thus, we are faced with the\nparadoxical result that the total mass estimate on the scale of $R_0 \\approx\n(3- 4) R_{vir}$ is only $~60$% of the virial mass estimate. Anyway, we conclude\nthat wide outskirts of the nearby groups do not contain a large amount of\nhidden mass outside their virial radius.\n", "  Recent quantum-gas microscopy of ultracold atoms and scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy of the cuprates reveal new detailed information about doped Mott\nantiferromagnets, which can be compared with calculations. Using cellular\ndynamical mean-field theory, we map out the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model as a function of interaction strength $U$, hole\ndoping $\\delta$ and temperature $T$. The N\\'eel phase boundary is non-monotonic\nas a function of $U$ and $\\delta$. Frustration induced by second-neighbor\nhopping reduces N\\'eel order more effectively at small $U$. The doped AF is\nstabilized at large $U$ by kinetic energy and at small $U$ by potential energy.\nThe transition between the AF insulator and the doped metallic AF is\ncontinuous. At large $U$, we find in-gap states similar to those observed in\nscanning tunneling microscopy. We predict that, contrary to the Hubbard bands,\nthese states are only slightly spin polarized.\n", "  $\\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ has recently been shown to realize in its low-temperature\nphase the type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM). We investigated by time- and angle-\nresolved photoelectron spectroscopy (tr-ARPES) the possible influence of the\nWeyl points in the electron dynamics above the Fermi level $\\mathrm{E_F}$, by\ncomparing the ultrafast response of $\\mathrm{MoTe_2}$ in the trivial and\ntopological phases. In the low-temperature WSM phase, we report an enhanced\nrelaxation rate of electrons optically excited to the conduction band, which we\ninterpret as a fingerprint of the local gap closure when Weyl points form. By\ncontrast, we find that the electron dynamics of the related compound\n$\\mathrm{WTe_2}$ is slower and temperature-independent, consistent with a\ntopologically trivial nature of this material. Our results shows that tr-ARPES\nis sensitive to the small modifications of the unoccupied band structure\naccompanying the structural and topological phase transition of\n$\\mathrm{MoTe_2}$.\n", "  The properties of a phase at finite interactions can be significantly\ninfluenced by the underlying dispersion of the non-interacting Hamiltonian. We\ndemonstrate this by studying the repulsive Hubbard model on the $2$D Lieb\nlattice, which has a flat band for vanishing interaction $U$. We perform\nreal-space dynamical mean-field theory calculations at different temperatures\nand dopings using a continuous time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver.\nStudying the frequency dependence of the self-energy, we show that a finite\ntemperature non-magnetic non-Fermi liquid behavior is a concomitant of the flat\nband singularity. At half-filling we also find a magnetically ordered region,\nwhere the order parameter varies linearly with the interaction strength, and a\nstrongly correlated Mott insulating phase. The double occupancy decreases\nsharply for small $U$, highlighting the flat band contribution. Away from\nhalf-filling, we observe the stripe order, i.e. an inhomogeneous spin and\ncharge density wave of finite wavelength which turns into a sub-lattice\nordering at higher temperatures.\n", "  A set of strongly magnetized accreting white dwarfs (polars) shows\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) with frequency about a Hz in their optical\nluminosity. These Hz-frequency QPOs are thought to be generated by intensity\nvariations of the emitted radiation originating at the post-shock accretion\ncolumn. Thermal instability in the post-shock region, triggered by efficient\ncooling process at the base, is believed to be the primary reason behind the\ntemporal variability. Here we study the structure and the dynamical properties\nof the post-shock accretion column including the effects of bremsstrahlung and\ncyclotron radiation. We find that the presence of significant cyclotron\nemission in optical band reduces the overall variability of the post-shock\nregion. In the case of a larger post-shock region above the stellar surface,\nthe effects of stratification due to stellar gravity becomes important. An\naccretion column, influenced by the strong gravity, has a smaller variability\nas the strength of the thermal instability at the base of the column is\nreduced. On the other hand, the cool, dense plasma, accumulated just above the\nstellar surface, may enhance the post-shock variability due to the propagation\nof magnetic perturbations. These characteristics of the post-shock region are\nconsistent with the observed properties of V834~Cen and in general with\nCataclysmic Variable sources that exhibit QPO frequency of about a Hz.\n", "  We illustrate and examine diverse approaches to the quantum matter-gravity\nsystem which refer to the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) method. In particular we first\nexamine a quantum geometrodynamical approach introduced by other authors in a\nmanner analogous to that previously employed by us, so as to include back\nreaction and non-adiabatic contributions. On including such effects it is seen\nthat the unitarity violating effects previously found disappear. A quantum loop\nspace formulation (based on a hybrid quantisation, polymer for gravitation and\ncanonical for matter) also refers to the BO method. It does not involve the\nclassical limit for gravitation and has a highly peaked initial scalar field\nstate. We point out that it does not resemble in any way to our traditional BO\napproach. Instead it does resemble an alternative, canonically quantised, non\nBO approach which we have also previously discussed.\n", "  We investigate the influence of self-energy diagrams beyond the two-particle\nvertex level within dual fermion theory. Specifically, we calculate the local\nthree-particle vertex and construct from it selected dual fermion self-energy\ncorrections to dynamical mean field theory. For the two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodel, the thus obtained self-energy corrections are small in the parameter\nspace where dual fermion corrections based on the two-particle vertex only are\nsmall. However, in other parts of the parameter space, they are of a similar\nmagnitude and qualitatively different from standard dual fermion theory. The\nhigh-frequency behaviour of the self-energy correction is - surprisingly - even\ndominated by corrections stemming from the three-particle vertex.\n", "  Knowledge of the number density of H$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies is vital for\nassessing the scientific impact of the Euclid and WFIRST missions. In this work\nwe present predictions from a galaxy formation model, Galacticus, for the\ncumulative number counts of H$\\alpha$-emitting galaxies. We couple Galacticus\nto three different dust attenuation methods and examine the counts using each\nmethod. A $\\chi^2$ minimisation approach is used to compare the model\npredictions to observed galaxy counts and calibrate the dust parameters. We\nfind that weak dust attenuation is required for the Galacticus counts to be\nbroadly consistent with the observations, though the optimum dust parameters\nreturn large values for $\\chi^2$, suggesting that further calibration of\nGalacticus is necessary. The model predictions are also consistent with\nobserved estimates for the optical depth and the H$\\alpha$ luminosity function.\nFinally we present forecasts for the redshift distributions and number counts\nfor two Euclid-like and one WFIRST-like survey. For a Euclid-like survey with\nredshift range $0.9\\leqslant z\\leqslant 1.8$ and H$\\alpha+{\\rm [NII]}$ blended\nflux limit of $2\\times 10^{-16}{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$ we\npredict a number density between 3900--4800 galaxies per square degree. For a\nWFIRST-like survey with redshift range $1\\leqslant z\\leqslant 2$ and blended\nflux limit of $1\\times 10^{-16}{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm cm}^{-2}$ we\npredict a number density between 10400--15200 galaxies per square degree.\n", "  In this paper, we address the issue of enhancing coherence of a state under\nstochastic strictly incoherent operations. Based on the $l_1$ norm of\ncoherence, we obtain the maximal value of coherence that can be achieved for a\nstate undergoing a stochastic strictly incoherent operation and the maximal\nprobability of obtaining the maximal coherence. Our findings indicate that a\npure state can be transformed into a maximally coherent state under a\nstochastic strictly incoherent operation if and only if all the components of\nthe pure state are nonzero while a mixed state can never be transformed into a\nmaximally coherent state under a stochastic strictly incoherent operation.\n", "  In the last few years several experiments have shown that the cosmic ray\nspectrum below the knee is not a perfect power-law. In particular, the proton\nand helium spectra show a spectral hardening by ~ 0.1-0.2 in spectral index at\nparticle energies of ~ 200-300 GeV/nucleon. Moreover, the helium spectrum is\nfound to be harder than that of protons by ~ 0.1 and some evidence for a\nsimilar hardening was also found in the spectra of heavier elements. Here we\nconsider the possibility that the hardening may be the result of a dispersion\nin the slope of the spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated at supernova remnant\nshocks. Such a dispersion is indeed expected within the framework of non-linear\ntheories of diffusive shock acceleration, which predict steeper (harder)\nparticle spectra for larger (smaller) cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies.\n", "  In this study, we present a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations of\nan isolated galaxy to test a sub-grid framework to consistently follow the\nformation and dissociation of H$_2$ with non-equilibrium chemistry. The latter\nis solved via the package KROME, coupled to the mesh-less hydrodynamic code\nGIZMO. We include the effect of star formation (SF), modelled with a physically\nmotivated prescription independent of H$_2$, supernova feedback and mass losses\nfrom low-mass stars, extragalactic and local stellar radiation, and dust and\nH$_2$ shielding, to investigate the emergence of the observed correlation\nbetween H$_2$ and SF rate surface densities. We present two different sub-grid\nmodels and compare them with on-the-fly radiative transfer (RT) calculations,\nto assess the main differences and limits of the different approaches. We also\ndiscuss a sub-grid clumping factor model to enhance the H$_2$ formation,\nconsistent with our SF prescription, which is crucial, at the achieved\nresolution, to reproduce the correlation with H$_2$. We find that both sub-grid\nmodels perform very well relative to the RT simulation, giving comparable\nresults, with moderate differences, but at much lower computational cost. We\nalso find that, while the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation for the total gas is not\nstrongly affected by the different ingredients included in the simulations, the\nH$_2$-based counterpart is much more sensitive, because of the crucial role\nplayed by the dissociating radiative flux and the gas shielding.\n", "  I present an optical characterization of the Galactic X-ray transient source\nMAXI J1957$+$032. This system flares by a factor of $\\gtrsim10^{4}$ every\nfew-hundred days, with each flare lasting $\\sim5$ days. I identify its\nquiescent counterpart to be a late-K/early-M dwarf star at a distance of\n$5\\pm2$ kpc. This implies that the peak $0.5-10$ keV luminosity of the system\nis $10^{36.4\\pm0.4}$ erg s$^{-1}$. As found by Mata Sanchez et al., the\noutburst properties of MAXI J1957$+$032 are most consistent with the sample of\naccreting millisecond pulsars. However, the low inferred accretion rate, and\nthe lack of evidence for a hydrogen-rich accretion flow, are difficult to\nreconcile with the late-K/early-M dwarf counterpart being the mass donor.\nInstead, the observations are best described by a low-mass hydrogen- and\npossibly helium-poor mass donor, such as a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, forming a\ntight interacting binary with a neutron star. The observed main-sequence\ncounterpart would then likely be in a wide orbit around the inner binary.\n", "  We present a methodology for the determination of empirical masses of single\nstars through the combination of three direct observables with Gaia and TESS:\n(i) the surface gravity via granulation-driven variations in the TESS light\ncurve, (ii) the bolometric flux at Earth via the broadband spectral energy\ndistribution, and (iii) the distance via the Gaia parallax. We demonstrate the\nmethod using 525 Kepler stars for which these measures are available in the\nliterature, and show that the stellar masses can be measured with this method\nto a precision of $\\sim$25\\%, limited by the surface-gravity precision of the\ngranulation \"flicker\" method ($\\sim$0.1~dex) and by the parallax uncertainties\n($\\sim$10\\% for the Kepler sample). We explore the impact of expected\nimprovements in the surface gravity determinations---through the application of\ngranulation background fitting and the use of recently published\ngranulation-metallicity relations---and improvements in the parallaxes with the\narrival of the Gaia second data release. We show that the application of this\nmethodology to stars that will be observed by TESS should yield radii good to a\nfew percent and masses good to $\\approx$10\\%. Importantly, the method does not\nrequire the presence of an orbiting, eclipsing, or transiting body, nor does it\nrequire spatial resolution of the stellar surface. Thus we can anticipate the\ndetermination of fundamental, accurate stellar radii and masses for hundreds of\nthousands of bright single stars---across the entire sky and spanning the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram---including those that will ultimately be found to\nhost planets.\n", "  We have investigated a highly energetic H-ingestion event during shell He\nburning leading to H-burning luminosities of $\\log(L_\\mathrm{H}/\\mathrm{\\Lsun})\n\\sim 13$ in a $45 \\Msun$ Pop III massive stellar model. In order to track the\nnucleosynthesis which may occur in such an event, we run a series of\nsingle-zone nucleosynthesis models for typical conditions found in the stellar\nevolution model. Such nucleosynthesis conditions may lead to\n$\\textit{i}-$process neutron densities of up to $ \\sim 10^{13}\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The resulting simulation abundance pattern, where Mg comes\nfrom He burning and Ca from the $\\textit{i}$ process, agrees with the general\nobserved pattern of the most iron-poor star currently known, SMSS\nJ031300.36-670839.3. However, Na is also efficiently produced in these $i$\nprocess conditions, and the prediction exceeds observations by $\\sim 2.5\n\\unitstyle{dex}$. While this probably rules out this model for SMSS\nJ031300.36-670839.3, the typical $\\textit{i}-$process signature of combined He\nburning and $\\textit{i}$ process of higher than solar [Na/Mg], [Mg/Al] and low\n[Ca/Mg] is reproducing abundance features of the two next most iron-poor stars\nHE\\,1017-5240 and HE\\,1327-2326 very well. The $i$ process does not reach Fe\nwhich would have to come from a low level of additional enrichment.\n$\\textit{i}$ process in hyper-metal poor or Pop III massive stars may be able\nto explain certain abundance patterns observed in some of the most-metal poor\nCEMP-no stars.\n", "  In natural foraging, many organisms seem to perform two different types of\nmotile search: directed search (taxis) and random search. The former is\nobserved when the environment provides cues to guide motion towards a target.\nThe latter involves no apparent memory or information processing and can be\nmathematically modeled by random walks. We show that both types of search can\nbe generated by a common mechanism in which L\\'evy flights or L\\'evy walks\nemerge from a second-order gradient-based search with noisy observations. No\nexplicit switching mechanism is required -- instead, continuous transitions\nbetween the directed and random motions emerge depending on the Hessian matrix\nof the cost function. For a wide range of scenarios the L\\'evy tail index is\n$\\alpha=1$, consistent with previous observations in foraging organisms. These\nresults suggest that adopting a second-order optimization method can be a\nuseful strategy to combine efficient features of directed and random search.\n", "  Based on XMM--Newton X-ray observations IGR J19552+0044 appears to be either\na pre-polar or an asynchronous polar. We conducted follow-up optical\nobservations to identify the sources and periods of variability precisely and\nto classify this X-ray source correctly. Extensive multicolor photometric and\nmedium- to high-resolution spectroscopy observations were performed and period\nsearch codes were applied to sort out the complex variability of the object. We\nfound firm evidence of discording spectroscopic (81.29+/-0.01m) and photometric\n(83.599+/-0.002m) periods that we ascribe to the white dwarf (WD)\\ spin period\nand binary orbital period, respectively. This confirms that IGR J19552+0044 is\nan asynchronous polar. Wavelength-dependent variability and its continuously\nchanging shape point at a cyclotron emission from a magnetic WD with a\nrelatively low magnetic field below 20 MG.\n  The difference between the WD spin period and the binary orbital period\nproves that IGR J19552+0044 is a polar with the largest known degree of\nasynchronism (0.97 or 3%).\n", "  We present a four-category classification algorithm for the solar wind, based\non Gaussian Process. The four categories are the ones previously adopted in Xu\n& Borovsky [2015]: ejecta, coronal hole origin plasma, streamer belt origin\nplasma, and sector reversal origin plasma. The algorithm is trained and tested\non a labeled portion of the OMNI dataset. It uses seven inputs: the solar wind\nspeed $V_{sw}$, the temperature standard deviation $\\sigma_T$, the sunspot\nnumber $R$, the $f_{10.7}$ index, the Alfven speed $v_A$, the proton specific\nentropy $S_p$ and the proton temperature $T_p$ compared to a velocity-dependent\nexpected temperature. The output of the Gaussian Process classifier is a four\nelement vector containing the probabilities that an event (one reading from the\nhourly-averaged OMNI database) belongs to each category. The probabilistic\nnature of the prediction allows for a more informative and flexible\ninterpretation of the results, for instance being able to classify events as\n'undecided'. The new method has a median accuracy larger than $90\\%$ for all\ncategories, even using a small set of data for training. The Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic curve and the reliability diagram also demonstrate the excellent\nquality of this new method. Finally, we use the algorithm to classify a large\nportion of the OMNI dataset, and we present for the first time transition\nprobabilities between different solar wind categories. Such probabilities\nrepresent the 'climatological' statistics that determine the solar wind\nbaseline.\n", "  We show that, away from the axis of symmetry, no continuous degeneration\nexists between the shadows of observers at any point in the exterior region of\nany Kerr-Newman black hole spacetime of unit mass. Therefore, except possibly\nfor discrete changes, an observer can, by measuring the black holes shadow,\ndetermine the angular momentum and the charge of the black hole under\nobservation, as well as the observer's radial position and angle of elevation\nabove the equatorial plane. Furthermore, his/her relative velocity compared to\na standard observer can also be measured. On the other hand, the black hole\nshadow does not allow for a full parameter resolution in the case of a\nKerr-Newman-Taub-NUT black hole, as a continuous degeneration relating specific\nangular momentum, electric charge, NUT charge and elevation angle exists in\nthis case.\n", "  We introduce Bell inequalities based on covariance, one of the most common\nmeasures of correlation. Explicit examples are discussed, and violations in\nquantum theory are demonstrated. A crucial feature of these covariance Bell\ninequalities is their nonlinearity; this has nontrivial consequences for the\nderivation of their local bound, which is not reached by deterministic local\ncorrelations. For our simplest inequality, we derive analytically tight bounds\nfor both local and quantum correlations. An interesting application of\ncovariance Bell inequalities is that they can act as \"shared randomness\nwitnesses\": specifically, the value of the Bell expression gives\ndevice-independent lower bounds on both the dimension and the entropy of the\nshared random variable in a local model.\n", "  The interaction of qubits via microwave frequency photons enables\nlong-distance qubit-qubit coupling and facilitates the realization of a\nlarge-scale quantum processor. However, qubits based on electron spins in\nsemiconductor quantum dots have proven challenging to couple to microwave\nphotons. In this theoretical work we show that a sizable coupling for a single\nelectron spin is possible via spin-charge hybridization using a magnetic field\ngradient in a silicon double quantum dot. Based on parameters already shown in\nrecent experiments, we predict optimal working points to achieve a coherent\nspin-photon coupling, an essential ingredient for the generation of long-range\nentanglement. Furthermore, we employ input-output theory to identify observable\nsignatures of spin-photon coupling in the cavity output field, which may\nprovide guidance to the experimental search for strong coupling in such\nspin-photon systems and opens the way to cavity-based readout of the spin\nqubit.\n", "  The second most significant detection of the Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich\nsurvey, PLCK~G287.0+32.9 ($z=0.385$) boasts two similarly bright radio relics\nand a radio halo. One radio relic is located $\\sim 400$ kpc northwest of the\nX-ray peak and the other $\\sim 2.8$ Mpc to the southeast. This large difference\nsuggests that a complex merging scenario is required. A key missing puzzle for\nthe merging scenario reconstruction is the underlying dark matter distribution\nin high resolution. We present a joint Subaru Telescope and {\\it Hubble Space\nTelescope} weak-lensing analysis of the cluster. Our analysis shows that the\nmass distribution features four significant substructures. Of the\nsubstructures, a primary cluster of mass\n$M_{200\\text{c}}=1.59^{+0.25}_{-0.22}\\times 10^{15} \\ h^{-1}_{70} \\\n\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ dominates the weak-lensing signal. This cluster is likely to\nbe undergoing a merger with one (or more) subcluster whose mass is\napproximately a factor of 10 lower. One candidate is the subcluster of mass\n$M_{200\\text{c}}=1.16^{+0.15}_{-0.13}\\times 10^{14} \\ h^{-1}_{70} \\\n\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ located $\\sim 400$ kpc to the southeast. The location of this\nsubcluster suggests that its interaction with the primary cluster could be the\nsource of the NW radio relic. Another subcluster is detected $\\sim 2$ Mpc to\nthe SE of the X-ray peak with mass $M_{200\\text{c}}=1.68^{+0.22}_{-0.20}\\times\n10^{14} \\ h^{-1}_{70} \\ \\text{M}_{\\odot}$. This SE subcluster is in the\nvicinity of the SE radio relic and may have created the SE radio relic during a\npast merger with the primary cluster. The fourth subcluster,\n$M_{200\\text{c}}=1.87^{+0.24}_{-0.22}\\times 10^{14} \\ h^{-1}_{70} \\\n\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, is northwest of the X-ray peak and beyond the NW radio\nrelic.\n", "  Observations of soft gamma rays emanating from the Milky Way from\nSPI/\\textit{INTEGRAL} reveal the annihilation of $\\sim2\\times10^{43}$ positrons\nevery second in the Galactic bulge. The origin of these positrons, which\nannihilate to produce a prominent emission line centered at 511 keV, has\nremained mysterious since their discovery almost 50 years ago. A plausible\norigin for the positrons is in association with the intense star formation\nongoing in the Galactic center. Moreover, there is strong evidence for a\nnuclear outflow in the Milky Way. We find that advective transport and\nsubsequent annihilation of positrons in such an outflow cannot simultaneously\nreplicate the observed morphology of positron annihilation in the Galactic\nbulge and satisfy the requirement that $90$ per cent of positrons annihilate\nonce the outflow has cooled to $10^4\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n", "  We present the largest catalogue of HI single dish observations of isolated\ngalaxies to date and the corresponding HI scaling relations, as part of the\nmulti-wavelength project AMIGA (Analysis of the interstellar Medium in Isolated\nGAlaxies). Despite numerous studies of the HI content of galaxies, no revision\nhas been made for the most isolated L* galaxies since 1984. In total we have\nmeasurements or constraints on the HI masses of 844 galaxies from the Catalogue\nof Isolated Galaxies (CIG), obtained with our own observations at Arecibo,\nEffelsberg, Nancay and GBT, and spectra from the literature. Cuts are made to\nthis sample to ensure isolation and a high level of completeness. We then fit\nHI scaling relations based on luminosity, optical diameter and morphology. Our\nregression model incorporates all the data, including upper limits, and\naccounts for uncertainties in both variables, as well as distance\nuncertainties. The scaling relation of HI mass with optical diameter is in good\nagreement with that of Haynes & Giovanelli 1984, but our relation with\nluminosity is considerably steeper. This is attributed to the large\nuncertainties in the luminosities, which introduce a bias when using OLS\nregression (used previously), and the different morphology distributions of the\nsamples. We find that the main effect of morphology on the relations is to\nincrease the intercept and flatten the slope towards later types. These trends\nwere not evident in previous works due to the small number of detected\nearly-type galaxies. The HI scaling relations of the AMIGA sample define an\nup-to-date metric of the HI content of almost \"nurture free\" galaxies. These\nrelations allow the expected HI mass, in the absence of interactions, of a\ngalaxy to be predicted to within 0.25 dex, and are thus suitable for use as\nstatistical measures of the impact of interactions on the neutral gas content\nof galaxies. (Abridged)\n", "  Let $\\Delta_{\\Omega_\\varepsilon}$ be the Dirichlet Laplacian in the domain\n$\\Omega_\\varepsilon:=\\Omega\\setminus\\left(\\cup_i D_{i \\varepsilon}\\right)$.\nHere $\\Omega\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\{D_{i \\varepsilon}\\}_{i}$ is a family of\ntiny identical holes (\"ice pieces\") distributed periodically in $\\mathbb{R}^n$\nwith period $\\varepsilon$. We denote by $\\mathrm{cap}(D_{i \\varepsilon})$ the\ncapacity of a single hole. It was known for a long time that\n$-\\Delta_{\\Omega_\\varepsilon}$ converges to the operator $-\\Delta_{\\Omega}+q$\nin strong resolvent sense provided the limit $q:=\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\to 0}\n\\mathrm{cap}(D_{i\\varepsilon}) \\varepsilon^{-n}$ exists and is finite. In the\ncurrent contribution we improve this result deriving estimates for the rate of\nconvergence in terms of operator norms. As an application, we establish the\nuniform convergence of the corresponding semi-groups and (for bounded $\\Omega$)\nan estimate for the difference of the $k$-th eigenvalue of\n$-\\Delta_{\\Omega_\\varepsilon}$ and $-\\Delta_{\\Omega_\\varepsilon}+q$. Our proofs\nrelies on an abstract scheme for studying the convergence of operators in\nvarying Hilbert spaces developed previously by the second author.\n", "  We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust orbiting the\npre-main sequence hierarchical triple star system GW Ori. A forward-modeling of\nthe ${}^{13}$CO and C${}^{18}$O $J$=2-1 transitions permits a measurement of\nthe total stellar mass in this system, $5.29 \\pm 0.09\\,M_\\odot$, and the\ncircum-triple disk inclination, $137.6 \\pm 2.0^\\circ$. Optical spectra spanning\na 35 year period were used to derive new radial velocities and, coupled with a\nspectroscopic disentangling technique, revealed that the A and B components of\nGW Ori form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a $241.50\\pm0.05$ day\nperiod; a tertiary companion orbits that inner pair with a $4218\\pm50$ day\nperiod. Combining the results from the ALMA data and the optical spectra with\nthree epochs of astrometry in the literature, we constrain the individual\nstellar masses in the system ($M_\\mathrm{A} \\approx 2.7\\,M_\\odot$,\n$M_\\mathrm{B} \\approx 1.7\\,M_\\odot$, $M_\\mathrm{C} \\approx 0.9\\,M_\\odot$) and\nfind strong evidence that at least one (and likely both) stellar orbital planes\nare misaligned with the disk plane by as much as $45^\\circ$. A $V$-band light\ncurve spanning 30 years reveals several new $\\sim$30 day eclipse events\n0.1-0.7~mag in depth and a 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation that is clearly\nphased with the AB-C orbital period. Taken together, these features suggest\nthat the A-B pair may be partially obscured by material in the inner disk as\nthe pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit. Lastly, we conclude\nthat stellar evolutionary models are consistent with our measurements of the\nmasses and basic photospheric properties if the GW Ori system is $\\sim$1 Myr\nold.\n", "  Jupiter's tropospheric ammonia (NH\\textsubscript{3}) abundance is studied\nusing spatially-resolved 5-\\textmu m observations from CRIRES, a high\nresolution spectrometer at the European Southern Observatory's Very Large\nTelescope. The high resolving power (R=96,000) allows the line shapes of three\nNH\\textsubscript{3} absorption features to be resolved. We find that within the\n1--4 bar pressure range, the NH\\textsubscript{3} abundance decreases with\naltitude. The instrument slit was aligned north-south along Jupiter's central\nmeridian, allowing us to search for latitudinal variability. There is\nconsiderable uncertainty in the large-scale latitudinal variability, as the\nincrease in cloud opacity in zones compared to belts can mask absorption\nfeatures. However, we do find evidence for a strong NH\\textsubscript{3}\nenhancement at 4--6$^{\\circ}$N, consistent with a localised `ammonia plume' on\nthe southern edge of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt.\n", "  We present laboratory spectra of the $3p$--$3d$ transitions in Fe$^{14+}$ and\nFe$^{15+}$ excited with a mono-energetic electron beam. In the energy dependent\nspectra obtained by sweeping the electron energy, resonant excitation is\nconfirmed as an intensity enhancement at specific electron energies. The\nexperimental results are compared with theoretical cross sections calculated\nbased on fully relativistic wave functions and the distorted-wave\napproximation. Comparisons between the experimental and theoretical results\nshow good agreement for the resonance strength. A significant discrepancy is,\nhowever, found for the non-resonant cross section in Fe$^{14+}$. %, which can\nbe considered as a fundamental cause of the line intensity ratio problem that\nhas often been found in both observatory and laboratory measurements. This\ndiscrepancy is considered to be the fundamental cause of the previously\nreported inconsistency of the model with the observed intensity ratio between\nthe $^3\\!P_2$ -- $^3\\!D_3$ and $^1\\!P_1$ -- $^1\\!D_2$ transitions.\n", "  We report on multiwavelength observations of nova SMCN 2016-10a. The present\nobservational set is one of the most comprehensive for any nova in the Small\nMagellanic Cloud, including: low, medium, and high resolution optical\nspectroscopy and spectropolarimetry from SALT, FLOYDS, and SOAR; long-term OGLE\n$V$- and $I$- bands photometry dating back to six years before eruption; SMARTS\noptical and near-IR photometry from $\\sim$ 11 days until over 280 days\npost-eruption; $Swift$ satellite X-ray and ultraviolet observations from $\\sim$\n6 days until 319 days post-eruption. The progenitor system contains a bright\ndisk and a main sequence or a sub-giant secondary. The nova is very fast with\n$t_2 \\simeq$ 4.0 $\\pm$ 1.0 d and $t_3 \\simeq$ 7.8 $\\pm$ 2.0 d in the $V$-band.\nIf the nova is in the SMC, at a distance of $\\sim$ 61 $\\pm$ 10 kpc, we derive\n$M_{V,\\mathrm{max}} \\simeq - 10.5$ $\\pm$ 0.5, making it the brightest nova ever\ndiscovered in the SMC and one of the brightest on record. At day 5\npost-eruption the spectral lines show a He/N spectroscopic class and a FWHM of\n$\\sim$ 3500 kms$^{-1}$ indicating moderately high ejection velocities. The nova\nentered the nebular phase $\\sim$ 20 days post-eruption, predicting the imminent\nsuper-soft source turn-on in the X-rays, which started $\\sim$ 28 days\npost-eruption. The super-soft source properties indicate a white dwarf mass\nbetween 1.2 M$_{\\odot}$ and 1.3 M$_{\\odot}$ in good agreement with the optical\nconclusions.\n", "  We analyse the properties of circumgalactic gas around simulated galaxies in\nthe redshift range z >= 3, utilising a new sample of cosmological zoom\nsimulations. These simulations are intended to be representative of the\nobserved samples of Lyman-alpha emitters recently obtained with the MUSE\ninstrument (halo masses ~10^10-10^11 solar masses). We show that supernova\nfeedback has a significant impact on both the inflowing and outflowing\ncircumgalactic medium by driving outflows, reducing diffuse inflow rates, and\nby increasing the neutral fraction of inflowing gas. By temporally stacking\nsimulation outputs we find that significant net mass exchange occurs between\ninflowing and outflowing phases: none of the phases are mass-conserving. In\nparticular, we find that the mass in neutral outflowing hydrogen declines\nexponentially with radius as gas flows outwards from the halo centre. This is\nlikely caused by a combination of both fountain-like cycling processes and\ngradual photo/collisional ionization of outflowing gas. Our simulations do not\npredict the presence of fast-moving neutral outflows in the CGM. Neutral\noutflows instead move with modest radial velocities (~ 50 kms^-1), and the\nmajority of the kinetic energy is associated with tangential rather than radial\nmotion.\n", "  We characterize the water repartition within the partially saturated\n(two-phase) zone (PSZ) during evaporation out of mixed wettable porous media by\ncontrolling the wettability of glass beads, their sizes, and as well the\nsurrounding relative humidity. Here, Capillary numbers are low and under these\nconditions, the percolating front is stabilized by gravity. Using experimental\nand numerical analyses, we find that the PSZ saturation decreases with the Bond\nnumber, where packing of smaller particles have higher saturation values than\npacking made of larger particles. Results also reveal that the extent (height)\nof the PSZ, as well as water saturation in the PSZ, both increase with\nwettability. We also numerically calculate the saturation exclusively contained\nin connected liquid films and results show that values are less than the\nexpected PSZ saturation. These results strongly reflect that the two-phase zone\nis not solely made up of connected capillary networks, but also made of\ndisconnected water clusters or pockets. Moreover, we also find that global\nsaturation (PSZ + full wet zone) decreases with wettability, confirming that\ngreater quantity of water is lost via evaporation with increasing\nhydrophilicity. These results show that connected liquid films are favored in\nmore hydrophilic systems while disconnected water pockets are favored in less\nhydrophilic systems.\n", "  The superconductor PdTe$_2$ was recently classified as a Type II Dirac\nsemimetal, and advocated to be an improved platform for topological\nsuperconductivity. Here we report magnetic and transport measurements conducted\nto determine the nature of the superconducting phase. Surprisingly, we find\nthat PdTe$_2$ is a Type I superconductor with $T_c = 1.64$ K and a critical\nfield $\\mu_0 H_c (0) = 13.6$ mT. Our crystals also exhibit the intermediate\nstate as demonstrated by the differential paramagnetic effect. For $H > H_c$ we\nobserve superconductivity of the surface sheath. This calls for a close\nexamination of superconductivity in PdTe$_2$ in view of the presence of\ntopological surface states.\n", "  The interacting boson-fermion model (IBFM), with parameters determined from\nthe microscopic Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, based on the\nparametrization D1M of the Gogny energy density functional (EDF), is employed\nto study the structural evolution in odd-mass $\\gamma$-soft nuclei. The\ndeformation energy surfaces of even-even nuclei, single-particle energies and\noccupation probabilities of the corresponding odd-mass systems have been\nobtained within the constrained HFB approach. Those building blocks are then\nused as a microscopic input to build the IBFM Hamiltonian. The coupling\nconstants of the boson-fermion interaction terms are taken as free parameters,\nfitted to reproduce experimental low-lying spectra. The diagonalization of the\nIBFM Hamiltonian provides the spectroscopic properties for the studied odd-mass\nnuclei. The procedure has been applied to compute low-energy excitation spectra\nand electromagnetic transition rates, in the case of the $\\gamma$-soft odd-mass\nsystems $^{129-137}$Ba, $^{127-135}$Xe, $^{129-137}$La and $^{127-135}$Cs. The\ncalculations provide a reasonable agreement with the available experimental\ndata and agree well with previous results based on the relativistic mean-field\napproximation.\n", "  The BL Lac object 3C66A is one of the most luminous extragalactic sources at\nTeV $\\gamma$-rays (VHE, i.e. $E >100$ GeV). Since TeV $\\gamma$-ray radiation is\nabsorbed by the extragalactic background light (EBL), it is crucial to know the\nredshift of the source in order to reconstruct its original spectral energy\ndistribution, as well as to constrain EBL models. However, the optical spectrum\nof this BL\\,Lac is almost featureless, so a direct measurement of $z$ is very\ndifficult; in fact, the published redshift value for this source ($z=0.444$)\nhas been strongly questioned. Based on EBL absorption arguments, several\nconstraints to its redshift, in the range $0.096 < z < 0.5$, were proposed.\n  Since these AGNs are hosted, typically, in early type galaxies that are\nmembers of groups or clusters, we have analysed spectro-photometrically the\nenvironment of 3C66A, with the goal of finding the galaxy group hosting this\nblazar. This study was made using optical images of a $5.5 \\times\n5.5$\\,arcmin$^{2}$ field centred on the blazar, and spectra of 24 sources\nobtained with Gemini/GMOS-N multi-object spectroscopy.\n  We found spectroscopic evidence of two galaxy groups along the blazar's line\nof sight: one at $z \\simeq 0.020$ and a second one at $z \\simeq 0.340$. The\nfirst one is consistent with a known foreground structure, while the second\ngroup here presented has six spectroscopically confirmed members. Their\nlocation along a red sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram allows us to\nidentify 34 additional candidate members of the more distant group. The\nblazar's spectrum shows broad absorption features that we identify as arising\nin the intergalactic medium, thus allowing us to tentatively set a redshift\nlower limit at $z_{3C66A} \\ge 0.33$. As a consequence, we propose that 3C66A is\nhosted in a galaxy that belongs to a cluster at $z=0.340$.\n", "  The mechanism for producing polarized emission from protostellar disks at\n(sub)millimeter wavelengths is currently uncertain. Classically, polarization\nis expected from non-spherical grains aligned with the magnetic field.\nRecently, two alternatives have been suggested. One polarization mechanism is\ncaused by self-scattering from dust grains of sizes comparable to the\nwavelength while the other mechanism is due to grains aligned with their short\naxes along the direction of radiation anisotropy. The latter has recently been\nshown as a likely mechanism for causing the dust polarization detected in HL\nTau at 3.1 mm. In this paper, we present ALMA polarization observations of HL\nTau for two more wavelengths: 870 $\\mu$m and 1.3 mm. The morphology at 870\n$\\mu$m matches the expectation for self-scattering, while that at 1.3 mm shows\na mix between self-scattering and grains aligned with the radiation anisotropy.\nThe observations cast doubt on the ability of (sub)millimeter continuum\npolarization to probe disk magnetic fields for at least HL Tau. By showing two\ndistinct polarization morphologies at 870 $\\mu$m and 3.1 mm and a transition\nbetween the two at 1.3 mm, this paper provides definitive evidence that the\ndominant (sub)millimeter polarization mechanism transitions with wavelength. In\naddition, if the polarization at 870 $\\mu$m is due to scattering, the lack of\npolarization asymmetry along the minor axis of the inclined disk implies that\nthe large grains responsible for the scattering have already settled into a\ngeometrically thin layer, and the presence of asymmetry along the major axis\nindicates that the HL Tau disk is not completely axisymmetric.\n", "  In this paper we study ATLAS results on underlying event in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s}$=0.9, 7 and 13 TeV. We show that the center-of-mass energy\ndependences of the charged-particle production sensitive to the underlying\nevent (\"transverse\" region) and to the hardest partonic interaction (\"towards\"\nand \"away\" regions) in pp collisions can be both understood in terms of the\nchange of the inclusive average multiplicity. Within uncertainties, the\ncorresponding particle production as a function of the leading charged particle\nshows no significant $\\sqrt{s}$-dependence for the three regions once they are\nscaled according to the relative change in multiplicity. The scaling properties\nreported here are well reproduced by PYTHIA 8.212 tune Monash 2013 and suggest\nan universality of the underlying event in hadronic interactions at high\n$\\sqrt{s}$. Based on the simulations, we observed that the same scaling\nproperties are also present in the average number of multi-partonic\ninteractions as a function of the leading charged particle. Moreover, the\nmultiplicity distributions associated to the underlying event exhibit a KNO\nscaling.\n", "  The relativistic effective mass $M^*$, and Fermi momentum, $k_F$, are\nimportant ingredients in the determination of the nuclear equation of state,\nbut they have rarely been extracted from experimental data below saturation\ndensity where translationally invariant nuclear matter becomes unstable against\nclusterization into the existing atomic nuclei. Using a novel kind of\nsuperscaling analysis of the quasielastic cross section electron scattering\ndata involving a suitable selection criterion and $^{12}$C as a reference\nnucleus, the global scaling properties of the resulting set of data for 21\nnuclei ranging from $^2$H to $^{238}$U are then analyzed. We find that a subset\nof a third of the about $20000$ data approximately scales to an universal\nsuperscaling function with a more constrained uncertainty band than just the\nreference $^{12}$C case and provides $M^*$ as a function of $k_F$.\n", "  The frustrated one-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet LiCuSbO$_4$ is one rare\nrealization of the $J_1-J_2$ spin chain model with an easily accessible\nsaturation field, formerly estimated to 12~T. Exotic multipolar nematic phases\nwere theoretically predicted in such compounds just below the saturation field,\nbut without unambiguous experimental observation so far. In this paper we\npresent extensive experimental research of the compound in the wide temperature\n(30mK$-$300K) and field (0$-$13.3T) range by muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR),\n$^7$Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic susceptibility (SQUID).\n$\\mu$SR experiments in zero magnetic field demonstrate the absence of long\nrange 3D ordering down to 30mK. Together with former heat capacity data [S.E.\nDutton \\emph{et al}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 187206 (2012)], magnetic\nsusceptibility measurements suggest short range correlated vector chiral phase\nin the field range $0-4$T. In the intermediate field values (5$-$12T), the\nsystem enters in a 3D ordered spin density wave phase with 0.75$\\mu_B$ per\ncopper site at lowest temperatures (125mK), estimated by NMR. At still higher\nfield, the magnetization is found to be saturated above 13T where the spin\nlattice $T_1^{-1}$ relaxation reveals a spin gap estimated to 3.2(2)K. We\nnarrow down the possibility of observing a multipolar nematic phase to the\nrange 12.5$-$13T.\n", "  PSR J2032+4127 is a young and rapidly rotating pulsar on a highly eccentric\norbit around the high-mass Be star MT91 213. X-ray monitoring of the binary\nsystem over a $\\sim$4000 day period with Swift has revealed an increase of the\nX-ray luminosity which we attribute to the synchrotron emission of the shocked\npulsar wind. We use Swift X-ray observations to infer a clumpy stellar wind\nwith $r^{-2}$ density profile and constrain the Lorentz factor of the pulsar\nwind to $10^5<\\gamma_w<10^6$. We investigate the effects of an axisymmetric\nstellar wind with polar gradient on the X-ray emission. Comparison of the X-ray\nlight curve hundreds of days before and after the periastron can be used to\nexplore the polar structure of the wind.\n", "  The circumstellar envelope of the hypergiant star IRC+10420 has been traced\nas far out in SiO J=2-1 as in CO J = 1-0 and CO J = 2-1, in dramatic contrast\nwith the centrally condensed (thermal) SiO- but extended CO-emitting envelopes\nof giant and supergiant stars. Here, we present an observation of the\ncircumstellar envelope in SiO J=1-0 that, when combined with the previous\nobservation in {\\sioii}, provide more stringent constraints on the density of\nthe SiO-emitting gas than hitherto possible. The emission in SiO peaks at a\nradius of $\\sim$2\\arcsec\\ whereas that in SiO J=2-1 emission peaks at a smaller\nradius of $\\sim$1\\arcsec, giving rise to their ring-like appearances. The ratio\nin brightness temperature between SiO J=1-0 and SiO J=2-1 decreases from a\nvalue well above unity at the innermost measurable radius to about unity at\nradius of $\\sim$2\\arcsec, beyond which this ratio remains approximately\nconstant. Dividing the envelope into three zones as in models for the CO J =\n1-0 and CO J = 2-1 emission, we show that the density of the SiO-emitting gas\nis comparable with that of the CO-emitting gas in the inner zone, but at least\nan order of magnitude higher by comparison in both the middle and outer zones.\nThe SiO-emitting gas therefore originates from dense clumps, likely associated\nwith the dust clumps seen in scattered optical light, surrounded by more\ndiffuse CO-emitting interclump gas. We suggest that SiO molecules are released\nfrom dust grains due to shock interactions between the dense SiO-emitting\nclumps and the diffuse CO-emitting interclump gas.\n", "  It has been suggested that short gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have shorter or\nundetectable spectral lags than long GRB because in the former, the observer's\nline of sight makes a larger angle with the GRB jet axis than for the latter.\nIt is proposed that simultaneous gravitational wave - short GRB events could\nprovide a simple test of this hypothesis. Multimessenger astronomy eventually\nmay test whether event horizons are a necessary ingredient for GRB.\n", "  The discovery of the first electromagnetic counterpart to a gravitational\nwave signal has generated follow-up observations by over 50 facilities\nworld-wide, ushering in the new era of multi-messenger astronomy. In this\npaper, we present follow-up observations of the gravitational wave event\nGW170817 and its electromagnetic counterpart SSS17a/DLT17ck (IAU label\nAT2017gfo) by 14 Australian telescopes and partner observatories as part of\nAustralian-based and Australian-led research programs. We report early- to\nlate-time multi-wavelength observations, including optical imaging and\nspectroscopy, mid-infrared imaging, radio imaging, and searches for fast radio\nbursts. Our optical spectra reveal that the transient source afterglow cooled\nfrom approximately 6400K to 2100K over a 7-day period and produced no\nsignificant optical emission lines. The spectral profiles, cooling rate, and\nphotometric light curves are consistent with the expected outburst and\nsubsequent processes of a binary neutron star merger. Star formation in the\nhost galaxy probably ceased at least a Gyr ago, although there is evidence for\na galaxy merger. Binary pulsars with short (100 Myr) decay times are therefore\nunlikely progenitors, but pulsars like PSR B1534+12 with its 2.7 Gyr\ncoalescence time could produce such a merger. The displacement (about 2.2 kpc)\nof the binary star system from the centre of the main galaxy is not unusual for\nstars in the host galaxy or stars originating in the merging galaxy, and\ntherefore any constraints on the kick velocity imparted to the progenitor are\npoor.\n", "  During a compact binary merger involving at least one neutron star, a small\nfraction of the gravitational energy could be liberated in such a way to\naccelerate a small fraction (~ 10^-6) of the neutron star mass in an isotropic\nor quasi-isotropic way. In presence of certain conditions, a pair-loaded\nfireball can form, which undergoes accelerated expansion reaching relativistic\nvelocities. As in the standard fireball scenario, internal energy is partly\ntransformed into kinetic energy. At the photospheric radius, the internal\nradiation can escape, giving rise to a pulse that lasts for a time equal to the\ndelay time since the merger. The subsequent interaction with the interstellar\nmedium can then convert part of the remaining kinetic energy back into\nradiation in a weak isotropic afterglow at all wavelengths. This scenario does\nnot require the presence of a jet: the associated isotropic prompt and\nafterglow emission should be visible for all NS-NS and BH-NS mergers within 90\nMpc, independent of their inclination. The prompt emission is similar to that\nexpected from an off-axis jet, either structured or much slower than usually\nassumed (Gamma ~ 10), or from the jet cocoon. The predicted afterglow emission\nproperties can discriminate among these scenarios.\n", "  The LIGO/VIRGO collaboration has recently announced the detection of\ngravitational waves from a neutron star-neutron star merger (GW170817) and the\nsimultaneous measurement of an optical counterpart (the gamma-ray burst GRB\n170817A). The close arrival time of the gravitational and electromagnetic waves\nlimits the difference in speed of photons and gravitons to be less than about\none part in $10^{15}$. This has three important implications for cosmological\nscalar-tensor gravity theories that are often touted as dark energy candidates\nand alternatives to $\\Lambda$CDM. First, for the most general scalar-tensor\ntheories---beyond Horndeski models---three of the five parameters appearing in\nthe effective theory of dark energy can now be severely constrained on\nastrophysical scales; we present the results of combining the new gravity wave\nresults with galaxy cluster observations. Second, the combination with the lack\nof strong equivalence principle violations exhibited by the supermassive black\nhole in M87, constrains the quartic galileon model to be cosmologically\nirrelevant. Finally, we derive a new bound on the disformal coupling to photons\nthat implies that such couplings are irrelevant for the cosmic evolution of the\nfield.\n", "  Multi-messenger gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has commenced with the\ndetection of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and its associated\nelectromagnetic counterparts. The almost coincident observation of both signals\nplaces an exquisite bound on the GW speed $|c_g/c-1|\\leq5\\cdot10^{-16}$. We use\nthis result to probe the nature of dark energy (DE), showing that a large class\nof scalar-tensor theories and DE models are highly disfavored. As an example we\nconsider the covariant Galileon, a cosmologically viable, well motivated\ngravity theory which predicts a variable GW speed at low redshift. Our results\neliminate any late-universe application of these models, as well as their\nHorndeski and most of their beyond Horndeski generalizations. Three\nalternatives (and their combinations) emerge as the only possible scalar-tensor\nDE models: 1) restricting Horndeski's action to its simplest terms, 2) applying\na conformal transformation which preserves the causal structure and 3)\ncompensating the different terms that modify the GW speed (to be robust, the\ncompensation has to be independent on the background on which GWs propagate).\nOur conclusions extend to any other gravity theory predicting varying $c_g$\nsuch as Einstein-Aether, Ho\\v{r}ava gravity, Generalized Proca, TeVeS and other\nMOND-like gravities.\n", "  We study the chaotic and secular evolution of hierarchical quadruple systems\nin the $3+1$ configuration, focusing on the evolution of mutual inclination of\nthe inner binaries as the system undergoes coupled Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations. We include short-range forces (SRF; such as those due to tidal\nand rotational distortions) that control the eccentricity excitation of the\ninner binary. The evolution of mutual inclination is described, a priori, by\ntwo dimensionless parameters, $\\pazocal{R}_0$, the ratio between the inner and\nouter LK time-scales and $\\epsilon_{SRF}$, the ratio between the SRF precession\nand the inner LK precession rates. We find that the chaotic zones for the\nmutual inclination depend mainly on $\\pazocal{R}_0$, while $\\epsilon_{SRF}$\ncontrols mainly the range of eccentricity excitation. The mutual inclination\nevolves chaotically for $1\\lesssim \\pazocal{R}_0\\lesssim 10$, leading to large\nmisalignments. For $0.4 \\lesssim \\pazocal{R}_0 \\lesssim 0.8$, the system could\nbe weakly excited and produce bimodal distribution of mutual inclination\nangles. Our results can be applied to exomoons-planets in stellar binaries and\nWarm/Hot Jupiters in stellar triples. Such systems could develop large mutual\ninclination angles if the inner binary is tight enough, and also high\neccentricities, depending of the strength of the short-range forces. Future\ndetections of tilted Warm/Hot Jupiters and exomoons could put our mechanism\nunder observational tests.\n", "  Time delay lensing is a mature and competitive cosmological probe. However,\nit is limited in accuracy by the well-known problem of the mass-sheet\ndegeneracy: too rigid assumptions on the density profile of the lens can\npotentially bias the inference on cosmological parameters. I investigate the\ndegeneracy between the choice of the lens density profile and the inference on\nthe Hubble constant, focusing on double image systems. By expanding lensing\nobservables in terms of the local derivatives of the lens potential around the\nEinstein radius, and assuming circular symmetry, I show that three degrees of\nfreedom in the radial direction are necessary to achieve a few percent accuracy\nin the time-delay distance. Additionally, while the time delay is strongly\ndependent on the second derivative of the potential, observables typically used\nto constrain lens models in time-delay studies, such as image position and\nradial magnification information, are mostly sensitive to the first and third\nderivatives, making it very challenging to accurately determine time-delay\ndistances with lensing data alone. Tests on mock observations show that the\nassumption of a power-law density profile results in a 5% average bias on\n$H_0$, with a 6% scatter. Using a more flexible model and adding unbiased\nvelocity dispersion constraints allows to obtain an inference with 1% accuracy.\nA power-law model can still provide 3% accuracy if velocity dispersion\nmeasurements are used to constrain its slope. Although this work is based on\nthe assumption of axisymmetry, its main findings can be generalized to cases\nwith moderate ellipticity.\n", "  The light curve of GW170817 is surprisingly blue and bright. Assuming that\nthe event is a binary neutron star merger, we argue that blueness and\nbrightness of the light curve is the result of ejecta that contains an\nsubstantial amount of thermal energy. To achieve this, the ejecta must be\nreheated at a substantial distance (1 to 2000 solar radii) from the merger to\navoid losing the energy to adiabatic cooling. We show that this reheating can\noccur if the merger occurs in a hierarchical triple system where the outer star\nhas evolved and filled its Roche lobe. The outer star feeds mass to the inner\nbinary, forming a circumbinary disc, driving the inner binary to merge. Because\nthe outer star fills its Roche lobe, a substantial fraction of the dynamical\nejecta collides with the evolved star, reheating the ejecta in the process. We\nsuggest that the process of mass transfer in heirarchical triples tends to form\ncoplanar triple systems such as PSR J0337+1715, and may provide electromagnetic\ncounterparts to binary black hole mergers.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the optical functionality of a semiconducting\nquantum ring manipulated by two electrostatic lateral gates used to induce a\ndouble quantum well along the ring. The well parameters and corresponding\ninter-level spacings, which lie in the THz range, are highly sensitive to the\ngate voltages. Our analysis shows that selection rules for inter-level dipole\ntransitions, caused by linearly polarized excitations, depend on the\npolarization angle with respect to the gates. In striking difference from the\nconventional symmetric double well potential, the ring geometry permits\npolarization-dependent transitions between the ground and second excited\nstates, allowing the use of this structure in a three-level lasing scheme.\n", "  Using the event-chain Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm, we investigate phase\ntransitions of the stacked Kagome Heisenberg systems with classical vector\nspins including up to the 3rd-nearest-neighbor couplings. In particular, we\nfocus on two types of non-coplanar spin orders ---cuboc1 and cuboc2 orders,\nboth of which have twelve-sublattice structures accompanying the\ntranslational-symmetry breaking. We perform event-chain MC simulations up to\nL=72, where L represents the linear dimension of the stacked Kagome lattice,\nand then find that the cuboc1 transition shows 2nd-order-transition behaviors\nwith a tendency to a weak-1st-order transition up to L=72, while the cuboc2\ntransition is basically described by the 1st-order transition. We then discuss\nthe above transitions in connection with the effective Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson\ntheory with the O(3)xO(3) symmetry.\n", "  We show that in conventional one-dimensional insulators excess charges\ncreated close to the boundaries of the system can be expressed in terms of the\nBerry phases associated with the electronic Bloch wave functions. Using this\ncorrespondence, we uncover a link between excess charges and the topological\ninvariants of the recently classified one-dimensional topological phases\nprotected by spatial symmetries. Excess charges can be thus used as a probe of\ncrystalline topologies.\n", "  The detection of an electromagnetic counterpart (GRB 170817A) to the\ngravitational wave signal (GW170817) from the merger of two neutron stars opens\na completely new arena for testing theories of gravity. We show that this\nmeasurement allows us to place stringent constraints on general scalar-tensor\nand vector-tensor theories, while allowing us to place an independent bound on\nthe graviton mass in bimetric theories of gravity. These constraints severely\nreduce the viable range of cosmological models that have been proposed as\nalternatives to general relativistic cosmology.\n", "  The luminosity distance measurement of GW170817 derived from GW analysis in\nAbbott et al. 2017 (here, A17:H0) is highly correlated with the measured\ninclination of the NS-NS system. To improve the precision of the distance\nmeasurement, we attempt to constrain the inclination by modeling the broad-band\nX-ray-to-radio emission from GW170817, which is dominated by the interaction of\nthe jet with the environment. We update our previous analysis and we consider\nthe radio and X-ray data obtained at $t<40$ days since merger. We find that the\nafterglow emission from GW170817 is consistent with an off-axis relativistic\njet with energy $10^{48}\\,\\rm{erg}<E_{k}\\le 3\\times 10^{50} \\,\\rm{erg}$\npropagating into an environment with density $n\\sim10^{-2}-10^{-4}\n\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}$, with preference for wider jets (opening angle $\\theta_j=15$\ndeg). For these jets, our modeling indicates an off-axis angle $\\theta_{\\rm\nobs}\\sim25-50$ deg. We combine our constraints on $\\theta_{\\rm obs}$ with the\njoint distance-inclination constraint from LIGO. Using the same $\\sim 170$\nkm/sec peculiar velocity uncertainty assumed in A17:H0 but with an inclination\nconstraint from the afterglow data, we get a value of $H_0=$$74.0 \\pm\n\\frac{11.5}{7.5}$ $\\mbox{km/s/Mpc}$, which is higher than the value of\n$H_0=$$70.0 \\pm \\frac{12.0}{8.0}$ $\\mbox{km/s/Mpc}$ found in A17:H0. Further,\nusing a more realistic peculiar velocity uncertainty of 250 km/sec derived from\nprevious work, we find $H_0=$$75.5 \\pm \\frac{11.6}{9.6}$ km/s/Mpc for H0 from\nthis system. We note that this is in modestly better agreement with the local\ndistance ladder than the Planck CMB, though a significant such discrimination\nwill require $\\sim 50$ such events. Future measurements at $t>100$ days of the\nX-ray and radio emission will lead to tighter constraints.\n", "  We present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of pairs of planets\nmigrating simultaneously in the Type I regime in a protoplanetary disc.\nConvergent migration naturally leads to the trapping of these planets in\nmean-motion resonances. Once in resonance the planets' eccentricity grows\nrapidly, and disc-planet torques cause the planets to escape resonance on a\ntime-scale of a few hundred orbits. The effect is more pronounced in highly\nviscous discs, but operates efficiently even in inviscid discs. We attribute\nthis resonance-breaking to overstable librations driven by moderate\neccentricity damping, but find that this mechanism operates differently in\nhydrodynamic simulations than in previous analytic calculations. Planets\nescaping resonance in this manner can potentially explain the observed paucity\nof resonances in Kepler multi-transiting systems, and we suggest that\nsimultaneous disc-driven migration remains the most plausible means of\nassembling tightly-packed planetary systems.\n", "  The dominant mechanism of low-energy positron annihilation in polyatomic\nmolecules is through positron capture in vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR).\nIn this paper we investigate theoretically the effect of anharmonic terms in\nthe vibrational Hamiltonian on the positron annihilation rates. Such\ninteractions enable positron capture in VFRs associated with multiquantum\nvibrational excitations, leading to enhanced annihilation. Mode coupling can\nalso lead to faster depopulation of VFRs, thereby reducing their contribution\nto the annihlation rates. To analyze this complex picture, we use\ncoupled-cluster methods to calculate the anharmonic vibrational spectra and\ndipole transition amplitudes for chloroform, chloroform-$d_1$,\n1,1-dichloroethylene, and methanol, and use these data to compute positron\nresonant annihilation rates for these molecules. Theoretical predictions are\ncompared with the annihilation rates measured as a function of incident\npositron energy. The results demonstrate the importance of mode coupling in\nboth enhancement and suppression of the VFR. There is also experimental\nevidence for the direct excitation of multimode VFR. Their contribution is\nanalyzed using a statistical approach, with an outlook towards more accurate\ntreatment of this phenomenon.\n", "  We present an analysis of all available time-resolved photometry from the\nliterature and new light curves obtained in 2013-2014 for the old nova RR\nPictoris. The well-known hump light curve phased with the orbital period\nreveals significant variations over the last 42 years in shape, amplitude and\nother details which apparently are caused by long-term variations in the disc\nstructure. In addition we found evidence for the presence of superhumps in\n2007, with the same period (~9% longer than the orbital period), as reported\nearlier by other authors from observations in 2005. Possibly, superhumps arise\nquickly in RR Pic, but are sporadic events, because in all the other observing\nruns analysed no significant superhump signal was detected. We also determined\nan actual version of the Stolz--Schoembs relation between superhump period and\norbital period, analysing separately dwarf novae, classical novae and nova-like\nstars, and conclude that this relation is of general validity for all\nsuperhumpers among the cataclysmic variables (CVs), in spite of small but\nsignificant differences among the sub-types mentioned above. We emphasize the\nimportance of such a study in context with the still open question of the\ninterrelation between the different sub-classes of CVs, crucial for our\nunderstanding of the long-term CV evolution.\n", "  Galactic outflows regulate the amount of gas galaxies convert into stars.\nHowever, it is difficult to measure the mass outflows remove because they span\na large range of temperatures and phases. Here, we study the rest-frame\nultraviolet spectrum of a lensed galaxy at z~2.9 with prominent interstellar\nabsorption lines from O I, tracing neutral gas, up to O VI, tracing\ntransitional phase gas. The O VI profile mimics weak low-ionization profiles at\nlow velocities, and strong saturated profiles at high velocities. These trends\nindicate that O VI gas is co-spatial with the low-ionization gas. Further, at\nvelocities blueward of -200 km/s the column density of the low-ionization\noutflow rapidly drops while the O VI column density rises, suggesting that O VI\nis created as the low-ionization gas is destroyed. Photoionization models do\nnot reproduce the observed O VI, but adequately match the low-ionization gas,\nindicating that the phases have different formation mechanisms. Photoionized\noutflows are more massive than O VI outflows for most of the observed\nvelocities, although the O VI mass outflow rate exceeds the photoionized\noutflow at velocities above the galaxy's escape velocity. Therefore, most gas\ncapable of escaping the galaxy is in a hot outflow phase. We suggest that the O\nVI absorption is a temporary by-product of conduction transferring mass from\nthe photoionized phase to an unobserved hot wind, and discuss how this\nmass-loading impacts the observed circum-galactic medium.\n", "  We present and analyse quasi-simultaneous multi-epoch spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of seven reverberation-mapped AGNs for which accurate\nblack hole mass measurements and suitable archival data are available from the\n'AGN Watch' monitoring programs. We explore the potential of optical-UV and\nX-ray data, obtained within 2 days, to provide more accurate SED-based\nmeasurements of individual AGN and quantify the impact of source variability on\nkey measurements typically used to characterise the black hole accretion\nprocess plus on bolometric correction factors at 5100 {\\AA}, 1350 {\\AA} and for\nthe 2-10 keV X-ray band, respectively. The largest SED changes occur on long\ntimescales (>1 year). For our small sample, the 1 micron to 10 keV integrated\naccretion luminosity typically changes by 10% on short time-scales (over 20\ndays), by ~30% over a year, but can change by 100% or more for individual AGN.\nThe EUV gap is the most uncertain part of the intrinsic SED, introducing a ~25%\nuncertainty in the accretion-induced luminosity, relative to the model\nindependent interpolation method that we adopt. That aside, our analysis shows\nthat the uncertainty in the accretion-induced luminosity, the Eddington\nluminosity ratio and the bolometric correction factors can be reduced (by a\nfactor of two or more) by use of SEDs built from data obtained within 20 days.\nHowever, mass accretion rate and mass accretion efficiency are mostly limited\nby the unknown EUV emission and the unknown details of the central engine and\nour aspect angle.\n", "  We study radiative neutrino pair emission in deexcitation process of atoms\ntaking into account coherence effect in a macroscopic target system. In the\ncourse of preparing the coherent initial state to enhance the rate, a spatial\nphase factor is imprinted in the macroscopic target. It is shown that this\ninitial spatial phase changes the kinematics of the radiative neutrino pair\nemission. We investigate effects of the initial spatial phase in the photon\nspectrum of the process. It turns out that the initial spatial phase provides\nus significant improvements in exploring neutrino physics such as the\nDirac-Majorana distinction and the cosmic neutrino background.\n", "  Fomalhaut is a nearby stellar system and has been found to be a triple based\non astrometric observations. With new radial velocity and astrometric data, we\nstudy the association between Fomalhaut A, B, and C in a Bayesian framework\nfinding that the system is gravitationally bound or at least associated. Based\non simulations of the system, we find that Fomalhaut C can be easily\ndestabilized through combined perturbations from the Galactic tide and stellar\nencounters. Considering that observing the disruption of a triple is probably\nrare in the solar neighbourhood, we conclude that Fomalhaut C is a so-called\n\"gravitational pair\" of Fomalhaut A and B. Like the Cooper pair mechanism in\nsuperconductors, this phenomena only appears once the orbital energy of a\ncomponent becomes comparable with the energy fluctuations caused by the\nenvironment. Based on our simulations we find (1) an upper limit of 8 km/s\nvelocity difference is appropriate when selecting binary candidates and (2) an\nempirical formula for the escape radius, which is more appropriate than tidal\nradius when measuring the stability of wide binaries.\n", "  We develop an alternative description of the procedure of vertical\nintegration based on the observation that amplitudes can be written in BRST\nexact form in the large Hilbert space. We relate this approach to the\ndescription of vertical integration given by Sen and Witten.\n", "  We present an analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak gravitational lensing (GGL) in\nchameleon $f(R)$ gravity - a leading candidate of non-standard gravity models.\nFor the analysis we have created mock galaxy catalogues based on dark matter\nhaloes from two sets of numerical simulations, using a halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD) prescription which allows a redshift dependence of galaxy\nnumber density. To make a fairer comparison between the $f(R)$ and $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodels, their HOD parameters are tuned so that the galaxy two-point correlation\nfunctions in real space (and therefore the projected two-point correlation\nfunctions) match. While the $f(R)$ model predicts an enhancement of the\nconvergence power spectrum by up to $\\sim30\\%$ compared to the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model with the same parameters, the maximum enhancement of GGL is\nonly half as large and less than 5\\% on separations above $\\sim1$-$2h^{-1}$Mpc,\nbecause the latter is a cross correlation of shear (or matter, which is more\nstrongly affected by modified gravity) and galaxy (which is weakly affected\ngiven the good match between galaxy auto correlations in the two models)\nfields. We also study the possibility of reconstructing the matter power\nspectrum by combination of GGL and galaxy clustering in $f(R)$ gravity. We find\nthat the galaxy-matter cross correlation coefficient remains at unity down to\n$\\sim2$-$3h^{-1}$Mpc at relevant redshifts even in $f(R)$ gravity, indicating\njoint analysis of GGL and galaxy clustering can be a powerful probe of matter\ndensity fluctuations in chameleon gravity. The scale dependence of the model\ndifferences in their predictions of GGL can potentially allow to break the\ndegeneracy between $f(R)$ gravity and other cosmological parameters such as\n$\\Omega_m$ and $\\sigma_8$.\n", "  The paper presents analytic expressions of minimax (worst-case) estimates for\nsolutions of linear abstract Neumann problems in Hilbert space with uncertain\n(not necessarily bounded!) inputs and boundary conditions given incomplete\nobservations with stochastic noise. The latter is assumed to have uncertain but\nbounded correlation operator. It is demonstrated that the minimax estimate is\nasymptotically exact under mild assumptions on observations and bounding sets.\nA relationship between the proposed estimates and a robust pseudo-inversion of\ncompact operators is revealed. This relationship is demonstrated on an academic\nnumerical example: homogeneous Neumann problem for Poisson equation in two\nspatial dimensions.\n", "  Gravitational-wave observation together with a large number of\nelectromagnetic observations shows that the source of the latest\ngravitational-wave event, GW170817, detected primarily by advanced LIGO, is the\nmerger of a binary neutron star. We attempt to interpret this observational\nevent based on our results of numerical-relativity simulations performed so far\npaying particular attention to the optical and infra-red observations. We\nfinally reach a conclusion that this event is described consistently by the\npresence of a long-lived hypermassive or supramassive neutron star as the\nmerger remnant, because (i) significant contamination by lanthanide elements\nalong our line of sight to this source can be avoided by the strong neutrino\nirradiation from it and (ii) it could play a crucial role to produce an ejecta\ncomponent of appreciable mass with fast motion in the post-merger phase. We\nalso point out that (I) the neutron-star equation of state has to be\nsufficiently stiff (i.e., the maximum mass of cold spherical neutron stars,\nM_max, has to be appreciably higher than 2M_sun in order that a long-lived\nmassive neutron star can be formed as the merger remnant for the binary systems\nof GW170817, for which the initial total mass is >~ 2.73M_sun and (II) no\ndetection of relativistic optical counterpart suggests a not-extremely high\nvalue of M_max approximately as 2.15-2.25M_sun.\n", "  Recent X-ray observations of merger shocks in galaxy clusters have shown that\nthe post-shock plasma is two-temperature, with the protons hotter than the\nelectrons. By means of two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we study\nthe physics of electron irreversible heating in perpendicular low Mach number\nshocks, for a representative case with sonic Mach number of 3 and plasma beta\nof 16. We find that two basic ingredients are needed for electron entropy\nproduction: (i) an electron temperature anisotropy, induced by field\namplification coupled to adiabatic invariance; and (ii) a mechanism to break\nthe electron adiabatic invariance itself. In shocks, field amplification occurs\nat two major sites: at the shock ramp, where density compression leads to an\nincrease of the frozen-in field; and farther downstream, where the shock-driven\nproton temperature anisotropy generates strong proton cyclotron and mirror\nmodes. The electron temperature anisotropy induced by field amplification\nexceeds the threshold of the electron whistler instability. The growth of\nwhistler waves breaks the electron adiabatic invariance, and allows for\nefficient entropy production. We find that the electron heating efficiency\ndisplays only a weak dependence on mass ratio (less than 30 percent drop, as we\nincrease the mass ratio from 49 up to 1600). We develop an analytical model of\nelectron irreversible heating and show that it is in excellent agreement with\nour simulation results.\n", "  Understanding the nature and energy distribution of optical resonances is of\ncentral importance in low-dimensional materials$^{1-4}$ and its knowledge is\ncritical for designing efficient optoelectronic devices. Ruddlesden-Popper\nhalide perovskites are 2D solution-processed quantum wells with a general\nformula A$_2$A'$_{n-1}$M$_n$X$_{3n+1}$, where optoelectronic properties can be\ntuned by varying the perovskite layer thickness (n value), and have recently\nemerged as efficient semiconductors with technologically relevant stability.\nHowever, fundamental questions concerning the nature of optical resonances\n(excitons or free-carriers) and the exciton reduced mass, and their scaling\nwith quantum well thickness remains unresolved. Here, using optical\nspectroscopy and 60-Tesla magneto-absorption supported by modelling, we\nunambiguously demonstrate that the optical resonances arise from tightly bound\nexcitons with unexpectedly high exciton reduced mass (0.20 m0) and binding\nenergies varying from 470 meV to 125 meV with increasing thickness from n=1 to\n5. Our work demonstrates the dominant role of Coulomb interactions in 2D\nsolution-processed quantum wells and presents unique opportunities for\nnext-generation optoelectronic and photonic devices.\n", "  We investigate effects of the presence of a magnetic field on tidal\ndissipation in rotating fluid bodies. We consider a simplified model consisting\nof a rigid core and a fluid envelope, permeated by a background magnetic field\n(either a dipolar field or a uniform axial field). The wavelike tidal responses\nin the fluid layer are in the form of magnetic-Coriolis waves, which are\nrestored by both the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force. Energy dissipation\noccurs through viscous damping and Ohmic damping of these waves. Our numerical\nresults show that the tidal dissipation can be dominated by Ohmic damping even\nwith a weak magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field smooths out the\ncomplicated frequency-dependence of the dissipation rate, and broadens the\nfrequency spectrum of the dissipation rate, depending on the strength of the\nbackground magnetic field. However, the frequency-averaged dissipation is\nindependent of the strength and structure of the magnetic field, and of the\ndissipative parameters, in the approximation that the wave-like response is\ndriven only by the Coriolis force acting on the non-wavelike tidal flow.\nIndeed, the frequency-averaged dissipation quantity is in good agreement with\nprevious analytical results in the absence of magnetic fields. Our results\nsuggest that the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation of the wavelike\nperturbations is insensitive to detailed damping mechanisms and dissipative\nproperties.\n", "  Although the electrical injection, transport and detection of spins in\nsilicon have been achieved, the induced spin accumulation was much smaller than\nexpected and desired, limiting the potential impact of Si-based spintronic\ndevices. Here, using non-local spin-transport devices with an n-type Si channel\nand Fe/MgO magnetic tunnel contacts, we demonstrate that it is possible to\ncreate a giant spin accumulation in Si, with the spin splitting reaching 13 meV\nat 10 K and 3.5 meV at room temperature. The non-local spin signals are in good\nagreement with a numerical evaluation of spin injection and diffusion that\nexplicitly takes the size of the injector contact into account. The giant spin\naccumulation originates from the large tunnel spin polarization of the Fe/MgO\ncontacts (53 % at 10 K and 18 % at 300 K), and the spin density enhancement\nachieved by using a spin injector with a size comparable to the spin-diffusion\nlength of the Si. The ability to induce a giant spin accumulation enables the\ndevelopment of Si spintronic devices with a large magnetic response.\n", "  The processes that led to the formation of the planetary bodies in the Solar\nSystem are still not fully understood. Using the results obtained with the\ncomprehensive suite of instruments on-board ESA's Rosetta mission, we present\nevidence that comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko likely formed through the gentle\ngravitational collapse of a bound clump of mm-sized dust aggregates\n(\"pebbles\"), intermixed with microscopic ice particles. This formation scenario\nleads to a cometary make-up that is simultaneously compatible with the global\nporosity, homogeneity, tensile strength, thermal inertia, vertical temperature\nprofiles, sizes and porosities of emitted dust, and the steep increase in\nwater-vapour production rate with decreasing heliocentric distance, measured by\nthe instruments on-board the Rosetta spacecraft and the Philae lander. Our\nfindings suggest that the pebbles observed to be abundant in protoplanetary\ndiscs around young stars provide the building material for comets and other\nminor bodies.\n", "  Neutron stars are ideal to probe, not only nuclear physics, but also\nstrong-field gravity. Approximate universal relations insensitive to the star's\ninternal structure exist among certain observables and are useful in testing\nGeneral Relativity, as they project out the uncertainties in the equation of\nstate. One such set of universal relations between the moment of inertia $(I)$,\nthe tidal Love number and the quadrupole moment $(Q)$ has been studied both in\nGeneral Relativity and in modified theories. In this paper, we study the\nrelations in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity, a well-motivated, parity-violating\neffective field theory, extending previous work in various ways. First, we\nstudy how projected constraints on the theory using the I-Love relation depend\non the measurement accuracy of $I$ with radio observations and that of the Love\nnumber with gravitational-wave observations. Provided these quantities can be\nmeasured with future observations, we find that the latter could place bounds\non dynamical Chern-Simons gravity that are six orders of magnitude stronger\nthan current bounds. Second, we study the I-Q and Q-Love relations in this\ntheory by constructing slowly-rotating neutron star solutions to quadratic\norder in spin. We find that the approximate universality continues to hold in\ndynamical Chern-Simons gravity, and in fact, it becomes stronger than in\nGeneral Relativity, although its existence depends on the normalization of the\ndimensional coupling constant of the theory. Finally, we study the variation of\nthe eccentricity of isodensity contours inside a star and its relation to the\ndegree of universality. We find that, in most cases, the eccentricity variation\nis smaller in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity than in General Relativity,\nproviding further support to the idea that the approximate self-similarity of\nisodensity contours is responsible for universality.\n", "  Spin-relaxation is conventionally discussed using two different approaches\nfor materials with and without inversion symmetry. The former is known as the\nElliott-Yafet (EY) theory and for the latter the D'yakonov-Perel' (DP) theory\napplies, respectively. We discuss herein a simple and intuitive approach to\ndemonstrate that the two seemingly disparate mechanisms are closely related. A\ncompelling analogy between the respective Hamiltonian is presented and that the\nusual derivation of spin-relaxation times, in the respective frameworks of the\ntwo theories, can be performed. The result also allows to obtain the less\ncanonical spin-relaxation regimes; the generalization of the EY when the\nmaterial has a large quasiparticle broadening and the DP mechanism in ultrapure\nsemiconductors. The method also allows a practical and intuitive numerical\nimplementation of the spin-relaxation calculation, which is demonstrated for\nMgB$_2$ that has anomalous spin-relaxation properties.\n", "  Zigzag phosphorene nanoribbons are metallic owing to the edge states, whose\nenergies are inside the gap and far from the bulk bands. We show that --\nthrough electrical manipulation of edge states -- electron propagation can be\nrestricted to one of the ribbon edges or, in case of bilayer phosphorene\nnanoribbons, to one of the layers. This finding implies that edge and layer can\nbe regarded as tunable equivalents of the spin-one-half degree of freedom,\ni.e., the pseudospin. In both layer- and edge-pseudospin schemes, we propose\nand characterize a pseudospin field-effect transistor, which can generate\npseudospin-polarized current. Also, we propose edge- and layer-pseudospin\nvalves that operate analogously to conventional spin valves. The performance of\nvalves in each pseudospin scheme is benchmarked by the pseudomagnetoresistance\n(PMR) ratio. The edge-pseudospin valve shows a nearly perfect PMR, with\nremarkable robustness against device parameters and disorder. These results may\ninitiate new developments in pseudospin electronics.\n", "  Observations of rotational modulations of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets\nallow the characterization of condensate cloud properties. As of now rotational\nspectral modulations have only been seen in three L-type brown dwarfs. We\nreport here the discovery of rotational spectral modulations in LP261-75B, an\nL6-type intermediate surface gravity companion to an M4.5 star. As a part of\nthe Cloud Atlas Treasury program we acquired time-resolved Wide Field Camera 3\ngrism spectroscopy (1.1--1.69~$\\mu$m) of LP261-75B. We find gray spectral\nvariations with the relative amplitude displaying only a weak wavelength\ndependence and no evidence for lower-amplitude modulations in the 1.4~$\\mu$m\nwater band than in the adjacent continuum. The likely rotational modulation\nperiod is 4.78$\\pm$0.95 h, although the rotational phase is not well sampled.\nThe minimum relative amplitude in the white light curve measured over the whole\nwavelength range is 2.41$\\pm$0.14\\%. We report an unusual light curve with\nseemingly three peaks approximately evenly distributed in rotational phase. The\nspectral modulations suggests that the upper atmosphere cloud properties in\n{LP261-75B} are similar to two other mid-L dwarfs of typical infrared colors,\nbut differ from that of the extremely red L-dwarf WISE0047.\n", "  A polymer repelled by unfavorable interactions with a uniform flat surface\nmay still be pinned to attractive edges and corners. This is demonstrated by\nconsidering adsorption of a two-dimensional ideal polymer to an attractive\ncorner of a repulsive wedge. The well-known mapping between the statistical\nmechanics of an ideal polymer and the quantum problem of a particle in a\npotential is then used to analyze the singular behavior of the unbinding\ntransition of the polymer. The divergence of the localization length is found\nto be governed by an exponent that varies continuously with the angle (when\nreflex). Numerical treatment of the discrete (lattice) version of such an\nadsorption problem confirms this behavior.\n", "  We present VIRAC version 1, a near-infrared proper motion and parallax\ncatalogue of the VISTA VVV survey for 312,587,642 unique sources averaged\nacross all overlapping pawprint and tile images covering 560 deg$^2$ of the\nbulge of the Milky Way and southern disk. The catalogue includes 119 million\nhigh quality proper motion measurements, of which 47 million have statistical\nuncertainties below 1 mas yr$^{-1}$. In the 11$<K_s<$14 magnitude range the\nhigh quality motions have a median uncertainty of 0.67 mas yr$^{-1}$. The\ncatalogue also includes 6,935 sources with quality-controlled 5 $\\sigma$\nparallaxes with a median uncertainty of 1.1 mas. The parallaxes show reasonable\nagreement with the TYCHO-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS), though caution is\nadvised for data with modest significance. The SQL database housing the data is\nmade available via the web. We give example applications for studies of\nGalactic structure, nearby objects (low mass stars and brown dwarfs, subdwarfs,\nwhite dwarfs) and kinematic distance measurements of YSOs. Nearby objects\ndiscovered include LTT 7251 B, an L7 benchmark companion to a G dwarf with over\n20 published elemental abundances, a bright L sub-dwarf, VVV 1256-6202, with\nextremely blue colours and nine new members of the 25 pc sample. We also\ndemonstrate why this catalogue remains useful in the era of Gaia. Future\nversions will be based on profile fitting photometry, use the Gaia absolute\nreference frame and incorporate the longer time baseline of the VVV extended\nsurvey (VVVX).\n", "  The transient neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J0556$-$332\nprovides a rare opportunity to study NS crust heating and subsequent cooling\nfor multiple outbursts of the same source. We examine {\\it MAXI}, {\\it Swift},\n{\\it Chandra}, and {\\it XMM-Newton} data of MAXI J0556$-$332 obtained during\nand after three accretion outbursts of different durations and brightness. We\nreport on new data obtained after outburst III. The source has been tracked up\nto $\\sim$1800 d after the end of outburst I. Outburst I heated the crust\nstrongly, but no significant reheating was observed during outburst II. Cooling\nfrom $\\sim$333 eV to $\\sim$146 eV was observed during the first $\\sim$1200 d.\nOutburst III reheated the crust up to $\\sim$167 eV, after which the crust\ncooled again to $\\sim$131 eV in $\\sim$350 d. We model the thermal evolution of\nthe crust and find that this source required a different strength and depth of\nshallow heating during each of the three outbursts. The shallow heating\nreleased during outburst I was $\\sim$17 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$ and outburst III\nrequired $\\sim$0.3 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$. These cooling observations could not be\nexplained without shallow heating. The shallow heating for outburst II was not\nwell constrained and could vary from $\\sim$0--2.2 MeV nucleon$^{-1}$, i.e.,\nthis outburst could in principle be explained without invoking shallow heating.\nWe discuss the nature of the shallow heating and why it may occur at different\nstrengths and depths during different outbursts.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) exhibit a wide diversity of peak luminosities and\nlight curve shapes: the faintest SNe Ia are 10 times less luminous and evolve\nmore rapidly than the brightest SNe Ia. Their differing characteristics also\nextend to their stellar age distributions, with fainter SNe Ia preferentially\noccurring in old stellar populations and vice versa. In this Letter, we\nquantify this SN Ia luminosity - stellar age connection using data from the\nLick Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS). Our binary population synthesis\ncalculations agree qualitatively with the observed trend in the >1 Gyr-old\npopulations probed by LOSS if the majority of SNe Ia arise from prompt\ndetonations of sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs (WDs) in double WD systems.\nUnder appropriate assumptions, we show that double WD systems with less massive\nprimaries, which yield fainter SNe Ia, interact and explode at older ages than\nthose with more massive primaries. We find that prompt detonations in double WD\nsystems are capable of reproducing the observed evolution of the SN Ia\nluminosity function, a constraint that any SN Ia progenitor scenario must\nconfront.\n", "  We study the behavior of a two-component plasma made up of non-additive hard\ndisks with a logarithmic Coulomb interaction. Due to the Coulomb repulsion,\nlong-wavelength total density fluctuations are suppressed and the system is\nglobally hyperuniform. Short-range volume effects lead to phase separation or\nto hetero-coordination for positive or negative non-additivities, respectively.\nThese effects compete with the hidden long-range order imposed by\nhyperuniformity. As a result, the critical behavior of the mixture is modified,\nwith long-wavelength concentration fluctuations partially damped when the\nsystem is charged. It is also shown that the decrease of configurational\nentropy due to hyperuniformity originates from contributions beyond the\ntwo-particle level. Finally, despite global hyperuniformity, we show that in\nour system, the spatial configuration associated with each component separately\nis not hyperuniform, i.e., the system is not \"multihyperuniform.\"\n", "  The electric field gradient (EFG) tensor at the $^{75}$As site couples to the\norbital occupations of the As p-orbitals and is a sensitive probe of local\nnematicity in BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We use nuclear magnetic resonance to measure the\nnuclear quadrupolar splittings and find that the EFG asymmetry responds\nlinearly to the presence of a strain field in the paramagnetic phase. We\nextract the nematic susceptibility from the slope of this linear response as a\nfunction of temperature and find that it diverges near the structural\ntransition in agreement with other measures of the bulk nematic susceptibility.\nOur work establishes an alternative method to extract the nematic\nsusceptibility which, in contrast to transport methods, can be extended inside\nthe superconducting state.\n", "  The intriguing WN4b star WR6 has been known to display epoch-dependent\nspectroscopic, photometric and polarimetric variability for several decades. In\nthis paper, we set out to verify if a simplified analytical model in which\nCorotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) threading an otherwise spherical wind is\nable to reproduce the many broadband continuum light curves from the literature\nwith a reasonable set of parameters.\n  We modified the optically thin model we developed in Ignace, St-Louis &\nProulx-Giraldeau (2015) to approximately account for multiple scattering and\nused it to fit 13 separate datasets of this star. By including two CIRs in the\nwind, we obtained reasonable fits for all datasets with coherent values for the\ninclination of the rotation axis ($i_0=166^{\\circ}$) and for its orientation in\nthe plane of the sky, although in the latter case we obtained two equally\nacceptable values ($\\psi=63^{\\circ}$ and $\\psi=152^{\\circ}$) from the\npolarimetry.\n  Additional line profile variation simulations using the Sobolev approximation\nfor the line transfer allowed us to eliminate the $\\psi=152^{\\circ}$ solution.\nWith the adopted configuration ($i_0=166^{\\circ}$ and $\\psi=63^{\\circ}$), we\nwere able to reproduce all datasets relatively well with two CIRs located near\nthe stellar equator and always separated by $\\sim 90^{\\circ}$ in longitude. The\nepoch-dependency comes from the fact that these CIRs migrate along the surface\nof the star. Density contrasts smaller than a factor of two and large opening\nangles for the CIR ($\\beta \\geq 35^{\\circ}$) were found to best reproduce the\ntype of spectroscopic variability reported in the literature.\n", "  When two particles collide at the horizon of a black hole and one of them\nsatisfies some critical conditions, the relative velocity between them can be\narbitrarily large, thus the energy of the center-of-mass will reach infinity.\nSuch a process is called BSW mechanism which can accelerate a particle to\narbitrarily high energy. There are also some studies showing that a Kerr naked\nsingularity can be more qualified as a particle accelerator for arbitrarily\nhigh energy. Previous researchers mainly concentrate on geodesic motion of\nparticles. In this paper, we will take spinning particles which won't move\nalong a timelike geodesic and carry more parameters into our consideration. By\nemploying the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equation, we will prove that for a\nspinning particle in hyper-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom or Kerr spacetime where\nexists a naked singularity at $r=0$, its Effective Potential\n$V_{eff}=-\\dot{r}^2$ must be able to reach zero within the interval $0 < r <\nM$, thus an ingoing particle will be able to turn back and then collide with\nanother ingoing particle at $r=M$. If the spacetime is ${\\bf slightly}$\nhyper-extremal, the energy of center of mass $E_{cm}$ will be arbitrarily high.\n", "  The K2 mission is targeting large numbers of nearby (d<100 pc) GKM dwarfs\nselected from the SUPERBLINK proper motion survey (mu>40 mas yr^-1, V<20).\nAdditionally, the mission is targeting low-mass, high proper motion stars\nassociated with the local (d<500 pc) Galactic halo population also selected\nfrom SUPERBLINK. K2 campaigns 0 through 8 monitored a total of 27,382 of these\ncool main-sequence stars. We used the auto-correlation function to search for\nfast rotators by identifying short-period photometric modulations in the K2\nlight curves. We identified 508 candidate fast rotators with rotation periods\n<4 days that show light curve modulations consistent with star spots. Their\nkinematics show low average transverse velocities, suggesting they are part of\nthe young disk population. A subset (13) of the fast rotators are found among\nthose targets with colors and kinematics consistent with the local Galactic\nhalo population and may represent stars spun up by tidal interactions in close\nbinary systems. We further demonstrate the M dwarf fast rotators selected from\nthe K2 light curves are significantly more likely to have UV excess, and\ndiscuss the potential of the K2 mission to identify new nearby young GKM dwarfs\non the basis of their fast rotation rates. Finally, we discuss the possible use\nof local halo stars as fiducial, non-variable sources in the Kepler fields.\n", "  We model X-ray reflection from white dwarfs (WD) in magnetic cataclysmic\nvariables (mCVs) with a Monte Carlo simulation. A point source with a power-law\nspectrum or a realistic post-shock accretion column (PSAC) source irradiates a\ncool and spherical WD. The PSAC source emits thermal spectra of various\ntemperatures stratified along the column according to the PSAC model. In the\npoint source simulation, we confirm (1) a source harder and nearer to the WD\nenhances the reflection, (2) higher iron abundance enhances the equivalent\nwidths (EWs) of fluorescent iron K${\\alpha}_{1,2}$ lines and their Compton\nshoulder, and increases cut-off energy of a Compton hump, and (3) significant\nreflection appears from an area that is more than 90 deg apart from the\nposition right under the point X-ray source because of the WD curvature. The\nPSAC simulation reveals that (1) a more massive WD basically enhances the\nintensities of the fluorescent iron K${\\alpha}_{1,2}$ lines and the Compton\nhump, except for some specific accretion rate, because the more massive WD\nmakes the hotter PSAC from which higher energy X-rays are preferentially\nemitted, (2) a larger specific accretion rate monotonically enhances the\nreflection because it makes the hotter and shorter PSAC, and (3) the intrinsic\nthermal component hardens by occultation of the cool base of the PSAC by the\nWD. We quantitatively evaluate influences of the parameters on the EWs and the\nCompton hump with both types of sources. We also calculate X-ray modulation\nprofiles brought about by the WD spin. They depend on angles of the spin axis\nfrom the line of sight and from the PSAC, and whether the two PSACs can be\nseen. The reflection spectral model and the modulation model involve the\nfluorescent lines and the Compton hump and can directly be compared to the data\nwhich allow us to evaluate these geometrical parameters with unprecedented\naccuracy.\n", "  We present time-resolved photometry and spectroscopy of the recently\nclassified polar MASTER OT J132104.04+560957.8. The spectrum shows a smooth,\nnon-thermal continuum at the time of maximum light, without any individually\ndiscernible cyclotron harmonics. Using homogeneous cyclotron modeling, we\ninterpret this as cyclotron radiation whose individual harmonics have blended\ntogether, and on this basis, we loosely constrain the magnetic field strength\nto be less than ~30 MG. In addition, for about one-tenth of the orbital period,\nthe Balmer and He I emission lines transition into absorption features, with He\nII developing an absorption core. We use our observations of this phenomenon to\ntest theoretical models of the accretion curtain and conclude that the H and He\nI lines are produced throughout the curtain, in contravention of theoretical\npredictions of separate H and He I line-forming regions. Moreover, a\nsignificant amount of He II emission originates within the accretion curtain,\nimplying that the curtain is significantly hotter than expected from theory.\nFinally, we comment on the object's long-term photometry, including evidence\nthat it recently transitioned into a prolonged, exceptionally stable high state\nfollowing a potentially decades-long low state.\n", "  We detail the calculation of two-loop all-plus helicity amplitudes for pure\nYang-Mills theory. The four dimensional unitarity methods and augmented\nrecursion techniques we have developed, together with a knowledge of the\nsingular structure of the amplitudes allow us to compute these in compact\nanalytic forms. Specifically we present the computation and analytic results\nfor the six- and seven-gluon leading colour two-loop amplitudes these being the\nfirst QCD two-loop amplitudes beyond five-points.\n", "  Context: The CARMENES survey is a high-precision radial velocity (RV)\nprogramme that aims to detect Earth-like planets orbiting low-mass stars.\n  Aims: We develop least-squares fitting algorithms to derive the RVs and\nadditional spectral diagnostics implemented in the SpEctrum Radial Velocity\nAnalyser (SERVAL), a publicly available python code.\n  Methods: We measured the RVs using high signal-to-noise templates created by\ncoadding all available spectra of each star.We define the chromatic index as\nthe RV gradient as a function of wavelength with the RVs measured in the\nechelle orders. Additionally, we computed the differential line width by\ncorrelating the fit residuals with the second derivative of the template to\ntrack variations in the stellar line width.\n  Results: Using HARPS data, our SERVAL code achieves a RV precision at the\nlevel of 1m/s. Applying the chromatic index to CARMENES data of the active star\nYZ CMi, we identify apparent RV variations induced by stellar activity. The\ndifferential line width is found to be an alternative indicator to the commonly\nused full width half maximum.\n  Conclusions: We find that at the red optical wavelengths (700--900 nm)\nobtained by the visual channel of CARMENES, the chromatic index is an excellent\ntool to investigate stellar active regions and to identify and perhaps even\ncorrect for activity-induced RV variations.\n", "  We present a new, publicly available library of dust spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs). These SEDs are characterized by only three parameters:\nthe dust mass (Mdust), the dust temperature (Tdust), and the mid-to-total\ninfrared color (IR8=LIR/L8). The latter measures the relative contribution of\nPAH molecules to the LIR. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies\nat 0.5<z<4 in the CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks\nof Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z=0 using the\nHerschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was found\nindependent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift. We found trends of\nincreasing Tdust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the SFR--Mstar main\nsequence (MS), and quantified for the first time their intrinsic scatter. Half\nof the observed variation of these parameters was captured by these empirical\nrelations, with residual scatters of 12% and 0.18 dex, respectively. Second\norder variations with stellar mass are discussed. Building on these results, we\nconstructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the accuracy of LIR\nand Mdust determined from a single flux measurement. Using a single JWST MIRI\nband, we found that LIR is typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of\n0.25 dex when probing the rest-frame 8 um, and this is not significantly\nimpacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the other hand, we found that\nALMA bands 8-to-7 and 6-to-3 measure Mdust at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex,\nrespectively, and independently of redshift, while bands 9-to-6 only measure\nLIR at better than 0.2 dex at z>1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7, respectively. Starburst\ngalaxies above the MS have LIR significantly underestimated and Mdust\noverestimated. These results can be used immediately to interpret more\naccurately the large amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA.\n[abridged]\n", "  We derive maps of the observed velocity of ionized gas, the oxygen abundance,\nand the extinction (Balmer decrement) across the area of the four spiral\ngalaxies NGC36, NGC180, NGC6063, and NGC7653 from integral field spectroscopy\nobtained by the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey. We\nsearched for spiral arms through Fourier analysis of the spatial distribution\nof three tracers (non-circular motion, enhancement of the oxygen abundance, and\nof the extinction) in the discs of our target galaxies. The spiral arms\n(two-armed logarithmic spirals in the deprojected map) are shown in each target\ngalaxy for each tracer considered. The pitch angles of the spiral arms in a\ngiven galaxy obtained with the three different tracers are close to each other.\nThe enhancement of the oxygen abundance in the spiral arms as compared to the\nabundance in the interarm regions at a given galactocentric distance is small;\nwithin a few per cent. We identified a metallicity gradient in our target\ngalaxies. Both barred galaxies in our sample show flatter gradients than the\ntwo galaxies without bars. Galactic inclination, position angle of the major\naxis, and the rotation curve were also obtained for each target galaxy using\nthe Fourier analysis of the two-dimensional velocity map.\n", "  We study the classification and composite spectra of galaxy in the fourth\ndata release (DR4) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic\nTelescope (LAMOST). We select 40,182 spectra of galaxies from LAMOST DR4, which\nhave photometric in- formation but no spectroscopic observations in the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey(SDSS). These newly observed spectra are re-calibrated and\nclassified into six classes, i.e. pas- sive, H{\\alpha}-weak, star-forming,\ncomposite, LINER and Seyfert using the line intensity (H\\b{eta},\n[OIII]{\\lambda}5007, H{\\alpha} and [NII]{\\lambda}6585). We also study the\ncorrelation between spectral classes and morphological types through three\nparameters: concentration index, (u - r) color, and D4000n index. We calculate\ncomposite spectra of high signal-to-noise ra- tio(S/N) for six spectral\nclasses, and using these composites we pick out some features that can\ndifferentiate the classes effectively, including H\\b{eta}, Fe5015, H{\\gamma}A,\nHK, and Mg2 band etc. In addition, we compare our composite spectra with the\nSDSS ones and analyse their difference. A galaxy catalogue of 40,182 newly\nobserved spectra (36,601 targets) and the composite spectra of the six classes\nare available online.\n", "  With the progress of cancer, the macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, lipids,\netc. inside cells undergo spatial structural rearrangements and alterations.\nMesoscopic physics based optical partial wave spectroscopy (PWS) was recently\nintroduced to quantify changes in the nanoscale structural disorder in\nbiological cells. The measurement is done in a parameter termed as disorder\nstrength ( Ld) which represents the degree of nanoscale structural disorder\ninside the cells. It was shown that cancerous cells have higher disorder\nstrength than the normal cells. In this work, using the PWS technique, we\nanalyzed the hierarchy of different types of prostate cancer cells by\nquantifying their average disorder strengths. The results showed that increase\nin the tumorigenicity level of prostate cancer is correlated with the increase\nin the disorder strength Ld. Furthermore, using the Ld parameter we also\nanalyzed docetaxel chemo-resistance attribute of these prostate cancer cells,\nin comparison to docetaxel chemo-sensitive cancer cells. Our results show that\nchemo drug resistive cancer cells have mutations to more aggressive, or\nincreased in Ld values relative to the chemo sensitive cancer cells. Potential\napplications of the Ld parameter for determining the effectiveness of the\nchemotherapy drug on cancer cells are discussed.\n", "  ALFABURST has been searching for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) commensally with\nother projects using the Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA) receiver at the\nArecibo Observatory since July 2015. We describe the observing system and\nreport on the non-detection of any FRBs from that time until August 2017 for a\ntotal observing time of 518 hours. With current FRB rate models, along with\nmeasurements of telescope sensitivity and beam size, we estimate that this\nsurvey probed redshifts out to about 3.4 with an effective survey volume of\naround 600,000 Mpc$^3$. Based on this, we would expect, at the 99% confidence\nlevel, to see at most two FRBs. We discuss the implications of this\nnon-detection in the context of results from other telescopes and the\nlimitation of our search pipeline. During the survey, single pulses from 17\nknown pulsars were detected. We also report the discovery of a Galactic radio\ntransient with a pulse width of 3 ms and dispersion measure of 281 pc\ncm$^{-3}$, which was detected while the telescope was slewing between fields.\n", "  We examine the properties of a sample of 35 nearby passive spiral galaxies in\norder to determine their dominant quenching mechanism(s). All five low mass\n($\\textrm{M}_{\\star} < 1 \\times 10^{10} \\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$) passive spiral\ngalaxies are located in the rich Virgo cluster. This is in contrast to low mass\nspiral galaxies with star formation, which inhabit a range of environments. We\npostulate that cluster-scale gas stripping and heating mechanisms operating\nonly in rich clusters are required to quench low mass passive spirals, and\nram-pressure stripping and strangulation are obvious candidates. For higher\nmass passive spirals, while trends are present, the story is less clear. The\npassive spiral bar fraction is high: 74$\\pm$15%, compared with 36$\\pm$5% for a\nmass, redshift, and T-type matched comparison sample of star forming spiral\ngalaxies. The high mass passive spirals occur mostly, but not exclusively, in\ngroups, and can be central or satellite galaxies. The passive spiral group\nfraction of 74$\\pm$15% is similar to that of the comparison sample of star\nforming galaxies at 61$\\pm$7%. We find evidence for both quenching via internal\nstructure and environment in our passive spiral sample, though some galaxies\nhave evidence of neither. From this, we conclude no one mechanism is\nresponsible for quenching star formation in passive spiral galaxies - rather, a\nmixture of mechanisms are required to produce the passive spiral distribution\nwe see today.\n", "  Twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed in several low-mass\nX-ray binary systems containing neutron stars (NSs). Timing analysis of X-ray\nfluxes of more than dozen of such systems reveals remarkable correlations\nbetween the frequencies of two characteristic peaks present in the power\ndensity spectra. The individual correlations clearly differ, but they roughly\nfollow a common individual pattern. High values of measured QPO frequencies and\nstrong modulation of the X-ray flux both suggest that the observed correlations\nare connected to orbital motion in the innermost part of an accretion disc.\nSeveral attempts to model these correlations with simple geodesic orbital\nmodels or phenomenological relations have failed in the past. We find and\nexplore a surprisingly simple analytic relation that reproduces individual\ncorrelations for a group of several sources through a single parameter. When an\nadditional free parameter is considered within our relation, it well reproduces\nthe data of a large group of 14 sources. The very existence and form of this\nsimple relation supports the hypothesis of the orbital origin of QPOs and\nprovides the key for further development of QPO models. We discuss a possible\nphysical interpretation of our relation's parameters and their links to\nconcrete QPO models.\n", "  The propagation of particles accelerated at supernova remnant shocks and\nescaping the parent remnants is likely to proceed in a strongly non-linear\nregime, due to the efficient self-generation of Alfv\\'en waves excited through\nstreaming instability near the sources. Depending on the amount of neutral\nhydrogen present in the regions around the sites of supernova explosions,\ncosmic rays may accumulate an appreciable grammage in the same regions and get\nself-confined for non-negligible times, which in turn results in an enhanced\nrate of production of secondaries. Here we calculate the contribution to the\ndiffuse gamma-ray background due to the overlap along lines of sight of several\nof these extended halos as due to pion production induced by self-confined\ncosmic rays. We find that if the density of neutrals is low, the halos can\naccount for a substantial fraction of the diffuse emission observed by\nFermi-LAT, depending on the orientation of the line of sight with respect to\nthe direction of the Galactic centre.\n", "  We consider an interface separating the Moore-Read state and Halperin 331\nstate in a half filled Landau level, which can be realized in a double quantum\nwell system with varying inter-well tunneling and/or interaction strength. We\nfind in the presence of electron tunneling and strong Coulomb interaction\nacross the interface, all charge modes localize and the only propagating mode\nleft is a chiral Majorana fermion mode. Methods to probe this neutral mode are\nproposed. Quantum phase transition between the Moore-Read and Halperin 331\nstates is described by a network of such Majorana fermion modes. In addition to\na direct transition, they may also be separated by a phase in which the\nMajorana fermions are delocalized, realizing an incompressible state which\nexhibits quantum Hall charge transport and bulk heat conduction.\n", "  With Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we investigate the progenitor population\nand formation mechanisms of the intracluster light (ICL) for 23 galaxy groups\nand clusters ranging from 3$\\times10^{13}<$M$_{500,c}$\n[M$_\\odot$]$<9\\times10^{14}$ at 0.29$<$z$<$0.89. The color gradients of the\nBCG+ICL become bluer with increasing radius out to 53-100 kpc for all but one\nsystem, suggesting that violent relaxation after major mergers with the BCG\ncannot be the dominant source of ICL. For clusters the BCG+ICL luminosity at\nr$<$100 kpc (0.08-0.13 r$_{500,c}$) is 1.2-3.5$\\times 10^{12}$L$_\\odot$; for\nthe groups, BCG+ICL luminosities within 100 kpc (0.17-0.23 r$_{500,c}$) range\nbetween 0.7-1.3$\\times 10^{12}$ L$_\\odot$. The BCG+ICL stellar mass in the\ninner 100 kpc increases with total cluster mass as\nM$_\\bigstar\\propto$M$_{500,c}$$^{0.37\\pm0.05}$. This steep slope implies that\nthe BCG+ICL is a higher fraction of the total mass in groups than in clusters.\nThe BCG+ICL luminosities and stellar masses are too large for the ICL stars to\ncome from the dissolution of dwarf galaxies alone, implying instead that the\nICL grows from the stripping of more massive galaxies. Using the colors of\ncluster members from the CLASH sample, we place conservative lower limits on\nthe luminosities of galaxies from which the ICL could originate. We find that\nat 10 kpc the ICL has a color similar to massive, passive cluster galaxies\n($>10^{11.6}$ M$_\\odot$), while by 100 kpc this colour is equivalent to that of\na 10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ galaxy. Additionally, we find 75% of the total BCG+ICL\nluminosity is consistent in color of galaxies with L$>$0.2 L$_*$\n(log(M$_\\bigstar$[M$_\\odot$])$>$10.4), assuming conservatively that these\ngalaxies are completely disrupted. We conclude that tidal stripping of massive\ngalaxies is the likely source of the intracluster light from 10-100 kpc\n(0.008-0.23 r$_{500,c}$) for galaxy groups and clusters.\n", "  Recently, many superflares on solar-type stars have been discovered as\nwhite-light flares (WLFs). The statistical study found a correlation between\ntheir energies ($E$) and durations ($\\tau$): $\\tau \\propto E^{0.39}$ (Maehara\net al. 2017 $EP\\& S$, 67, 59), similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray\nflares: $\\tau \\propto E^{0.2-0.33}$. This indicates a universal mechanism of\nenergy release on solar and stellar flares, i.e., magnetic reconnection. We\nhere carried out a statistical research on 50 solar WLFs observed with\n\\textit{SDO}/HMI and examined the correlation between the energies and\ndurations. As a result, the $E$--$\\tau$ relation on solar WLFs ($\\tau \\propto\nE^{0.38}$) is quite similar to that on stellar superflares ($\\tau \\propto\nE^{0.39}$). However, the durations of stellar superflares are one order of\nmagnitude shorter than those expected from solar WLFs. We present the following\ntwo interpretations for the discrepancy. (1) In solar flares, the cooling\ntimescale of WLFs may be longer than the reconnection one, and the decay time\nof solar WLFs can be elongated by the cooling effect. (2) The distribution can\nbe understood by applying a scaling law ($\\tau \\propto E^{1/3}B^{-5/3}$)\nderived from the magnetic reconnection theory. In this case, the observed\nsuperflares are expected to have 2-4 times stronger magnetic field strength\nthan solar flares.\n", "  Our Galaxy's bar makes the Galaxy's potential distinctly non-axisymmetric.\nAll orbits are affected by non-axisymmetry, and significant numbers are\nqualitatively changed by being trapped at a resonance with the bar. Orbital\ntori are used to compute these effects. Thick-disc orbits are no less likely to\nbe trapped by corotation or a Lindblad resonance than thin-disc orbits.\nPerturbation theory is used to create non-axisymmetric orbital tori from\nstandard axisymmetric tori, and both trapped and untrapped orbits are recovered\nto surprising accuracy. Code is added to the TorusModeller library that makes\nit as easy to manipulate non-axisymmetric tori as axisymmetric ones. The\naugmented TorusModeller is used to compute the velocity structure of the solar\nneighbourhood for bars of different pattern speeds and a simple action-based\ndistribution function. The technique developed here can be applied to any\nnon-axisymmetric potential that is stationary in a rotating from - hence also\nto classical spiral structure.\n", "  In the development of atomic clocks, some atomic transition frequencies are\nmeasured with remarkable precision. These measured spectra may include effects\nof a new force mediated by a weakly interacting boson. Such effects might be\ndistilled out from possible violation of a linear relation in isotope shifts\nbetween two transitions, as known as King's linearity, with relatively\nsuppressed theoretical uncertainties. We discuss the experimental sensitivity\nto a new force in the test of the linearity as well as the linearity violation\nowing to higher order effects within the Standard Model. The sensitivity to new\nphysics is limited by such effects. We have found that for Yb$^+$, the higher\norder effect is in the reach of future experiments. The sensitivity to a heavy\nmediator is also discussed. It is analytically clarified that the sensitivity\nbecomes weaker than that in the literature. Our numerical results of the\nsensitivity are compared with other weak force search experiments.\n", "  The strong and electromagnetic corrections to $\\rho-\\omega$ mixing are\ncalculated using a SU(2) version of resonance chiral theory up to\nnext-to-leading orders in $1/N_C$ expansion, respectively. Up to our accuracy,\nthe effect of the momentum dependence of $\\rho-\\omega$ mixing is incorporated\ndue to the inclusion of loop contributions. We analyze the impact of\n$\\rho-\\omega$ mixing on the pion vector form factor by performing numerical fit\nto the data extracted from $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$ and $\\tau\\rightarrow\n\\nu_{\\tau}2\\pi$, while the decay width of $\\omega\\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$ is\ntaken into account as a constraint. It is found that the momentum dependence is\nsignificant in a good description of the experimental data. In addition, based\non the fitted values of the involved parameters, we analyze the decay width of\n$\\omega \\rightarrow \\pi^+\\pi^-$, which turns out to be highly dominated by the\n$\\rho-\\omega$ mixing effect.\n", "  We present a method for measuring internal stellar structure based on\nasteroseismology that we call \"inversions for agreement.\" The method accounts\nfor imprecise estimates of stellar mass and radius as well as the relatively\nlimited oscillation mode sets that are available for distant stars. By\nconstruction, the results of the method are independent of stellar models. We\napply this method to measure the isothermal sound speeds in the cores of the\nsolar-type stars 16 Cyg A and B using asteroseismic data obtained from Kepler\nobservations. We compare the asteroseismic structure that we deduce against\nbest-fitting evolutionary models and find that the sound speeds in the cores of\nthese stars exceed those of the models.\n", "  The fluence distribution of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) population (the\n\"source counts\" distribution, $N(>F) \\propto F^\\alpha$), is a crucial\ndiagnostic of its distance distribution, and hence the progenitor evolutionary\nhistory. We critically reanalyse current estimates of the FRB source counts\ndistribution. We demonstrate that the Lorimer burst (FRB 010724) is subject to\ndiscovery bias, and should be excluded from all statistical studies of the\npopulation. We re-examine the evidence for flat, $\\alpha >-1$, source counts\nestimates based on the ratio of single-beam to multiple-beam detections with\nthe Parkes multi-beam receiver, and show that current data implies only a very\nweak constraint of $\\alpha \\lesssim -1.3$. A maximum likelihood analysis\napplied to the portion of the Parkes FRB population detected above the\nobservational completeness fluence of 2 Jy ms yields $\\alpha =\n-2.6_{-1.3}^{+0.7}$. Uncertainties in the location of each FRB within the\nParkes beam render estimates of the Parkes event rate uncertain in both\nnormalising survey area and the estimated post-beam-corrected completeness\nfluence; this uncertainty needs to be accounted for when comparing the event\nrate against event rates measured at other telescopes.\n", "  We develop a semi-analytic model to explore different prescriptions of\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) fuelling. This model utilises a merger-triggered\nburst mode in concert with two possible implementations of a long-lived steady\nmode for assembling the mass of the black hole in a galactic nucleus. We\nimprove modelling of the galaxy-halo connection in order to more realistically\ndetermine the evolution of a halo's velocity dispersion. We use four model\nvariants to explore a suite of observables: the M-sigma relation, mass\nfunctions of both the overall and broad-line quasar population, and luminosity\nfunctions as a function of redshift. We find that \"downsizing\" is a natural\nconsequence of our improved velocity dispersion mappings, and that high-mass\nSMBHs assemble earlier than low-mass SMBHs. The burst mode of fuelling is\nsufficient to explain the assembly of SMBHs to z=2, but an additional steady\nmode is required to both assemble low-mass SMBHs and reproduce the low-redshift\nluminosity function. We discuss in detail the trade-offs in matching various\nobservables and the interconnected modelling components that govern them. As a\nresult, we demonstrate the utility as well as the limitations of these\nsemi-analytic techniques.\n", "  In this paper we study a set of twelve pulsars that previously had not been\ncharacterized. Our timing shows that eleven of them are \"normal\" isolated\npulsars, with rotation periods between 0.22 and 2.65 s, characteristic ages\nbetween 0.25 Myr and 0.63 Gyr, and estimated magnetic fields ranging from 0.05\nto 3.8x 10^{12} G. The youngest pulsar in our sample, PSR~J0627+0706, is\nlocated near the Monoceros supernova remnant (SNR G205.5+0.5), but it is not\nthe pulsar most likely to be associated with it. We also confirmed the\nexistence of a candidate from an early Arecibo survey, PSR~J2053+1718, its\nsubsequent timing and polarimetry are also presented here. It is an isolated\npulsar with a spin period of 119 ms, a relatively small magnetic field of\n5.8x10^9 G and a characteristic age of 6.7 Gyr; this suggests the pulsar was\nmildly recycled by accretion from a companion star which became unbound when\nthat companion became a supernova. We report the results of single-pulse and\naverage Arecibo polarimetry at both 327 and 1400 MHz aimed at understanding the\nbasic emission properties and beaming geometry of these pulsars. Three of them\n(PSRs~J0943+2253, J1935+1159 and J2050+1259) have strong nulls and sporadic\nradio emission, several others exhibit interpulses (PSRs J0627+0706 and\nJ0927+2345) and one shows regular drifting subpulses (J1404+1159).\n", "  We present a seismological method to probe the solar atmosphere above sunspot\numbrae with three-minute oscillations. Our technique allows us to estimate both\nthe vertical distance between atmospheric layers and the wave-propagation speed\nwithout specifying any extra parameters, in particular, the phase speed of the\nwave or the emission formation heights. Our method uses the projected wave\npaths of slow MHD waves propagating through the atmospheric layers of different\nheights and guided by the magnetic field. The length of the projected wave path\ndepends upon the distance between the layers and the inclination angle of the\nmagnetic field with respect to the line of sight, allowing us to estimate the\ndistance between the layers from measured projected wave paths and the local\nmagnetic-field vector. In turn, the wave-propagation delay registered at\ndifferent heights allows for the calculation of the phase speed. We estimated\nthe vertical distance between the emission layers at the temperature minimum\n(1600 {\\AA}) and transition region (304 {\\AA}), as well as the average phase\nspeed above the sunspot umbrae, for three active regions. We found that the\ndistance between the 1600 {\\AA} emission layer and the transition region above\nthe sunspot umbrae lies in the range of 500 -- 800 km. The average phase speed\nbetween these layers was found to be about 30 km/s giving the sound speed of 6\nkm/s. The temperature between the layers has been roughly estimated as 3000 K\nand corresponds to the region of the temperature minimum. The results obtained\nare consistent with the semiempirical model of the sunspot umbrae atmosphere by\nFontenla, 2009.\n  The manuscript has been accepted for publication in Solar Physics journal.\n", "  We present one-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium time-dependent\nradiative transfer simulations (using CMFGEN) of two sub-Chandrasekhar\n(sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$), one $M_{\\rm Ch}$ and one super-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ Type Ia SN\nejecta models. Three originate from $M_{\\rm Ch}$ delayed detonation models, and\nthe fourth is a sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ detonation model. Ejecta masses are 1.02,\n1.04, 1.40, and 1.70 M$_\\odot$, and all models have 0.62 M$_\\odot$ of\n$^{56}{\\rm Ni}$. Sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ model light curves evolve faster, reaching\nbolometric maximum 2--3 days earlier and having 3--4 days shorter bolometric\nhalf light widths. The models vary by $\\sim$12 per cent at maximum bolometric\nluminosity and by 0.17 mag in $B_{\\rm max}$. While $\\Delta M_{15}(B)$ increases\nwith ejecta mass it only varies by $\\sim$5 per cent around 1 mag. Sub-$M_{\\rm\nCh}$ models are 0.25 mag bluer in $B-R$ at $B_{\\rm max}$. Optical spectra share\nmany similarities, but lower mass models exhibit less UV line blanketing during\nthe photospheric phase. At nebular times, significant NIR spectroscopic\ndifferences are seen. In particular, emission lines of the Ca II NIR triplet;\n[S III] $\\lambda\\lambda$9068,9530; [Ca II] $\\lambda\\lambda$7291,7324; [Ar III]\n$\\lambda\\lambda$7135,7751; and [Ni II] 1.939 $\\mu$m are stronger in higher mass\nmodels. The [Ni II] 1.939 $\\mu$m line is absent in the sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$\ndetonation model, and provides a valuable potential tool to distinguish\nsub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ explosions from $M_{\\rm Ch}$ explosions. In general, the\nnebular phase models are too highly ionized. We attribute this to the neglect\nof clumping and/or the distribution of intermediate mass and iron group\nelements. The two sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ models, while exploded by different\nmechanisms, can be distinguished in the $J$ and $H$ bands at late times (e.g.,\n$+200$ days).\n", "  Regions of disc galaxies with widespread star formation tend to be both\ngravitationally unstable and self-shielded against ionizing radiation, whereas\nextended outer discs with little or no star formation tend to be stable and\nunshielded on average. We explore what drives the transition between these two\nregimes, specifically whether discs first meet the conditions for\nself-shielding (parameterized by dust optical depth, $\\tau$) or gravitational\ninstability (parameterized by a modified version of Toomre's instability\nparameters, $Q_{\\rm thermal}$, which quantifies the stability of a gas disc\nthat is thermally supported at $T=10^4$ K). We first introduce a new metric\nformed by the product of these quantities, $Q_{\\rm thermal}\\tau$, which\nindicates whether the conditions for disk instability or self-shielding are\neasier to meet in a given region of a galaxy, and we discuss how $Q_{\\rm\nthermal}\\tau$ can be constrained even in the absence of direct gas information.\nWe then analyse a sample of 13 galaxies with resolved gas measurements and find\nthat on average galaxies will reach the threshold for disk instabilities\n($Q_{\\rm thermal}<1$) before reaching the threshold for self-shielding\n($\\tau>1$). Using integral field spectroscopic observations of a sample of 236\ngalaxies from the MaNGA survey, we find that the value of $Q_{\\rm thermal}\\tau$\nin star-forming discs is consistent with similar behavior. These results\nsupport a scenario where disc fragmentation and collapse occurs before\nself-shielding, suggesting that gravitational instabilities are the primary\ncondition for widespread star formation in galaxy discs. Our results support\nsimilar conclusions based on recent galaxy simulations.\n", "  In the coming LSST era, we will observe $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ of lensed\nsupernovae (SNe). In this paper, we investigate possibility for predicting time\nand sky position of a supernova using strong lensing. We find that it will be\npossible to predict the time and position of the fourth image of SNe which\nproduce four images by strong lensing, with combined information from the three\nprevious images. It is useful to perform multi-messenger observations of the\nvery early phase of supernova explosions including the shock breakout.\n", "  In this paper, we explore the evolution of sunspot latitude distribution and\nexplore its relations with the cycle strength. With the progress of the solar\ncycle, the distributions in two hemispheres from mid-latitudes propagate toward\nthe equator and then (before the usual solar minimum) these two distributions\ntouch each other. By visualizing the evolution of the distributions in two\nhemispheres, we separate the solar cycles by excluding this hemispheric\noverlap. From these isolated solar cycles in two hemispheres, we generate\nlatitude distributions for each cycle, starting from cycle 8 to cycle 23. We\nfind that the parameters of these distributions, namely, the central latitude\n($C$), width ($\\delta$) and height ($H$) evolve with the cycle number and they\nshow some hemispheric asymmetries. Although the asymmetries in these parameters\npersist for a few successive cycles, they get corrected within a few cycles and\nthe new asymmetries appear again. In agreement with the previous study, we find\nthat distribution parameters are correlated with the strengths of the cycles,\nalthough these correlations are significantly different in two hemispheres. The\ngeneral trend that stronger cycles begin sunspot eruptions at relatively higher\nlatitudes and have wider bands of sunspot emergence latitudes are confirmed\nwhen combining the data from two hemispheres. We explore these features using a\nflux transport dynamo model with stochastic fluctuations. We find that these\nfeatures are correctly reproduced in this model. The solar cycle evolution of\nthe distribution center is also in good agreement with observations. Possible\nexplanations of the observed features based on this dynamo model are presented.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength study of star formation within the nearby M101\nGroup, including new deep H$\\alpha$ imaging of M101 and its two companions. We\nperform a statistical analysis of the H$\\alpha$ to FUV flux ratios in HII\nregions located in three different environments: M101's inner disk, M101's\nouter disk, and M101's lower mass companion galaxy NGC~5474. We find that, once\nbulk radial trends in extinction are taken into account, both the median and\nscatter in F$_{\\rm H\\alpha}/$F$_{\\rm FUV}$ in HII regions are invariant across\nall of these environments. Also, using Starburst99 models, we are able to\nqualitatively reproduce the distributions of F$_{\\rm H\\alpha}/$F$_{\\rm FUV}$\nthroughout these different environments using a standard Kroupa IMF, hence we\nfind no need to invoke truncations in the upper mass end of the IMF to explain\nthe young star-forming regions in the M101 Group even at extremely low surface\ndensity. This implies that star formation in low density environments differs\nfrom star formation in high density environments only by intensity and not by\ncloud-to-cloud physics.\n", "  We present optical photometric (upto $\\sim$410 days since $B$$_{max}$) and\nspectroscopic (upto $\\sim$157 days since $B$$_{max}$) observations of a Type\nIax supernova (SN) 2014dt located in M61. SN 2014dt is one of the brightest and\nclosest (D $\\sim$ 20 Mpc) discovered Type Iax SN. SN 2014dt best matches the\nlight curve evolution of SN 2005hk and reaches a peak magnitude of $M$$_B$\n$\\sim$-18.13$\\pm$0.04 mag with $\\Delta m_{15}$ $\\sim$1.35$\\pm 0.06$ mag. The\nearly spectra of SN 2014dt are similar to other Type Iax SNe, whereas the\nnebular spectrum at 157 days is dominated by narrow emission features with less\nblending as compared to SNe 2008ge and 2012Z. The ejecta velocities are between\n5000 to 1000 km sec$^{-1}$ which also confirms the low energy budget of Type\nIax SN 2014dt as compared to normal Type Ia SNe. Using the peak bolometric\nluminosity of SN 2005hk we estimate $^{56}$Ni mass of $\\sim$0.14 M$_{\\odot}$\nand the striking similarity between SN 2014dt and SN 2005hk implies that a\ncomparable amount of $^{56}$Ni would have been synthesized in the explosion of\nSN 2014dt.\n", "  Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR) has a periphery which clearly deviates from\nspherical shape bash on the X-ray and radio observations. The forward shock\nfrom the southeast to the north of the remnant has a relatively deformed\noutline with a depression in the east, although in the west it is generally\nround and smooth. Moreover, at some locations of the shell, the supernova\nejecta distributes closely to the forward shock to produce protrusions. Using\n3D hydrodynamical simulation, the dynamical evolution of the supernova ejecta\nin an inhomogeneous medium and the formation process of the profile of the\nforward shock can be studied. To reproduce the peculiar periphery of the\nremnant, we propose a model in which the supernova ejecta has evolved in a\ncavity blown by a latitude-dependent outflow. The results indicate that, with\nthe assumptions of the wind bubble driven by the anisotropic wind with a mass\nloss rate of $\\sim10^{-7} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$~yr$^{-1}$, a pole velocity of $\\sim\n100$~km s$^{-1}$, a duration of $\\sim10^5$~yr just before the supernova\nexplosion, and a spatial velocity of $\\sim 30$~km s$^{-1}$ of the progenitor\nwith respect to the circumstellar medium, the depression to the east and the\nprotrusion to the southeast on the observed periphery of the remnant can be\ngenerally reproduced. In conclusion, an explanation to the peculiar shape of\nthe periphery of Tycho's SNR is the supernova ejecta evolved in the cavity\ndriven by the latitude-dependent wind.\n", "  In high energy heavy-ion collisions, the degrees of freedom at the very early\nstage can be effectively represented by strong classical gluonic fields within\nthe Color Glass Condensate framework. As the system expands, the strong gluonic\nfields eventually become weak such that an equivalent description using the\ngluonic particle degrees of freedom starts to become valid. We revisit the\nspectrum of these gluonic particles by solving the classical Yang-Mills\nequations semi-analytically with the solutions having the form of power series\nexpansions in the proper time. We propose a different formula for the gluon\nspectrum which is consistent with energy density during the whole time\nevolution. We find that the chromo-electric fields have larger contributions to\nthe gluon spectrum than the chromo-magnetic fields do. Furthermore, the large\nmomentum modes take less time to reach the weak-field regime while smaller\nmomentum modes take more time. The resulting functional form of the gluon\nspectrum is exponential in nature and the spectrum is close to a thermal\ndistrubtion with effective temperatures around $0.6$ to $0.9\\, Q_s$ late in the\nGlasma evolution. The sensitiveness of the gluon spectrum to the infrared and\nthe ultraviolet cut-offs are discussed.\n", "  Based on the experimental evidence that impurities contribute to the\ndissipation properties of solid-state open quantum systems, we provide here a\ndescription in terms of nonlinear quantum Langevin equations of the role played\nby two-level systems in the dynamics of a bosonic degree of freedom. Our\nstarting point is represented by the description of the system/environment\ncoupling in terms of coupling to two separate reservoirs, modelling the\ninteraction with external bosonic modes and two level systems, respectively.\nFurthermore, we show how this model represents a specific example of a class of\nopen quantum systems that can be described by nonlinear quantum Langevin\nequations. Our analysis offers a potential explanation of the parametric\neffects recently observed in circuit-QED cavity optomechanics experiments.\n", "  In standard accretion discs, outward angular momentum transfer by viscous\nforces is compensated by the inward motion of the accreting matter. However,\nthe vertical structure of real accretion discs leads to meridional circulation\nwith comparable amplitudes of poloidal velocities. Using thin-disc\napproximation, we consider different regimes of disc accretion with different\nvertical viscosity scalings. We show that, while gas-pressure-dominated discs\ncan easily have a midplane outflow, standard thin radiation-pressure-dominated\ndisc is normally moving inwards at all the heights. However, quasi-spherical\nscaling for pressure ($p\\propto \\varpi^{-5/2}$) leads to a midplane outflow for\na very broad range of parameters. It particular, this may lead to a reversed,\noutward heat advection in geometrically thick discs when the temperature\ndecreases rapidly enough with height. While the overall direction of heat\nadvection depends on the unknown details of vertical structure and viscosity\nmechanisms, existence of the midplane counterflow in quasi-spherical flows is a\nrobust result weakly dependent on the parameters and the assumptions of the\nmodel. Future models of thick radiatively inefficient flows should take\nmeridional circulation into account.\n", "  We present optical photometric and spectroscopic results of supernova SN\n2004ab, a highly reddened normal type Ia supernova. The total reddening is\nestimated as $E(B-V)$ = 1.70 $\\pm$ 0.05 mag. The intrinsic decline rate\nparameter, $\\Delta m_{15}(B)_\\text{true}$ is 1.27 $\\pm$ 0.05, and $B$-band\nabsolute magnitude at maximum $M_{B}^{\\text{max}}$ is $-$19.31 $\\pm$ 0.25 mag.\nThe host galaxy NGC 5054 is found to exhibit anomalous extinction with very low\nvalue of $R_V$ = 1.41 $\\pm$ 0.06 in the direction of SN 2004ab. Peak bolometric\nluminosity is derived as $\\log L_\\text{bol}^\\text{max}$ = 43.10 $\\pm$ 0.07\nerg\\,s$^{-1}$. The photospheric velocity measured from absorption minimum of\nSi\\,{\\sc ii} $\\lambda$6355 line shows a velocity gradient of $\\dot{v}$ = 90\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$\\,d$^{-1}$, indicating that SN 2004ab is a member of the high\nvelocity gradient (HVG) subgroup. The ratio of strength of Si\\,{\\sc ii}\n$\\lambda$5972 and $\\lambda$6355 absorption lines, $\\cal R$(Si\\,{\\sc ii}) is\nestimated as 0.37, while their pseudo equivalent widths suggest that SN 2004ab\nbelongs to broad line (BL) type subgroup.\n", "  In this paper, we report our multiwavelength observations of the simultaneous\ntransverse and longitudinal oscillations in a quiescent prominence on 2015 June\n29. A C2.4 flare took place in active region 12373, which was associated with a\npair of short ribbons and a remote ribbon. During the impulsive phase of the\nflare, a coronal jet spurted out of the primary flare site and propagated in\nthe northwest direction at an apparent speed of $\\sim$224 km s$^{-1}$. Part of\nthe jet stopped near the remote ribbon. The remaining part continued moving\nforward before stopping to the east of prominence. Once the jet encountered the\nprominence, it pushed the prominence to oscillate periodically. The transverse\noscillation of the eastern part (EP) of prominence can be divided into two\nphases. In phase I, the initial amplitude, velocity, period, and damping\ntimescale are $\\sim$4.5 Mm, $\\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$, $\\sim$25 minutes, and\n$\\sim$7.5 hr, respectively. In phase II, the initial amplitude increases to\n$\\sim$11.3 Mm while the initial velocity halves to $\\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. The\nperiod increases by a factor of $\\sim$3.5. The western part (WP) of prominence\nalso experienced transverse oscillation. The initial amplitude is only $\\sim$2\nMm and the velocity is less than 10 km s$^{-1}$. The period ($\\sim$27 minutes)\nis slightly longer than that of EP in phase I. To the east of prominence, a\nhandful of horizontal threads experienced longitudinal oscillation. The initial\namplitude, velocity, period, and damping timescale are $\\sim$52 Mm, $\\sim$50 km\ns$^{-1}$, $\\sim$99 minutes, and 2.5 hr, respectively. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first report of simultaneous transverse and longitudinal prominence\noscillations triggered by a coronal jet.\n", "  A faint dwarf irregular galaxy has been discovered in the HST/ACS field of LV\nJ1157+5638. The galaxy is resolved into individual stars, including the\nbrightest magnitude of the red giant branch. The dwarf is very likely a\nphysical satellite of LV J1157+5638.The distance modulus of LV J1157+5638 using\nthe tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) distance indicator is 29.82+-0.09 mag (D\n= 9.22+-0.38 Mpc). The TRGB distance modulus of LV J1157+5638 sat is\n29.76+-0.11 mag (D = 8.95+-0.42 Mpc). The distances to the two galaxies are\nconsistent within the uncertainties. The projected separation between them is\nonly 3.9 kpc. LVJ1157+5638 has a total absolute V-magnitude of -13.26+-0.10 and\nlinear Holmberg diameter of 1.36 kpc, whereas its faint satellite LV J1157+5638\nsat has M_V = -9.38+-0.13 mag and Holmberg diameter of 0.37 kpc. Such a faint\ndwarf was discovered for the first time beyond the nearest 4 Mpc from us. The\npresence of main sequence stars in both galaxies unambiguously indicates the\nclassification of the objects as dwarf irregulars (dIrrs) with recent or\nongoing star formation events in both galaxies.\n", "  The star formation rate in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is an order of\nmagnitude lower than predicted according to star formation relations that have\nbeen calibrated in the disc of our own and nearby galaxies. Understanding how\nand why star formation appears to be different in this region is crucial if we\nare to understand the environmental dependence of the star formation process.\nHere, we present the detection of a sample of high-mass cores in the CMZ's\n\"dust ridge\" that have been discovered with the Submillimeter Array as part of\nthe CMZoom survey. These cores range in mass from ~ 50 - 2150 Msun within radii\nof 0.1 - 0.25 pc. All appear to be young (pre-UCHII), meaning that they are\nprime candidates for representing the initial conditions of high-mass stars and\nsub-clusters. We report that at least two of these cores ('c1' and 'e1')\ncontain young, high-mass protostars. We compare all of the detected cores with\nhigh-mass cores in the Galactic disc and find that they are broadly similar in\nterms of their masses and sizes, despite being subjected to external pressures\nthat are several orders of magnitude greater - ~ 10^8 K/cm^3, as opposed to ~\n10^5 K/cm^3. The fact that > 80% of these cores do not show any signs of\nstar-forming activity in such a high-pressure environment leads us to conclude\nthat this is further evidence for an increased critical density threshold for\nstar formation in the CMZ due to turbulence.\n", "  We present a thermal emission spectrum of the bloated hot Jupiter HAT-P-32Ab\nfrom a single eclipse observation made in spatial scan mode with the Wide Field\nCamera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectrum covers\nthe wavelength regime from 1.123 to 1.644 microns which is binned into 14\neclipse depths measured to an averaged precision of 104 parts-per million. The\nspectrum is unaffected by a dilution from the close M-dwarf companion\nHAT-P-32B, which was fully resolved. We complemented our spectrum with\nliterature results and performed a comparative forward and retrieval analysis\nwith the 1D radiative-convective ATMO model. Assuming solar abundance of the\nplanet atmosphere, we find that the measured spectrum can best be explained by\nthe spectrum of a blackbody isothermal atmosphere with Tp = 1995 +/- 17K, but\ncan equally-well be described by a spectrum with modest thermal inversion. The\nretrieved spectrum suggests emission from VO at the WFC3 wavelengths and no\nevidence of the 1.4 micron water feature. The emission models with temperature\nprofiles decreasing with height are rejected at a high confidence. An\nisothermal or inverted spectrum can imply a clear atmosphere with an absorber,\na dusty cloud deck or a combination of both. We find that the planet can have\ncontinuum of values for the albedo and recirculation, ranging from high albedo\nand poor recirculation to low albedo and efficient recirculation. Optical\nspectroscopy of the planet's day-side or thermal emission phase curves can\npotentially resolve the current albedo with recirculation degeneracy.\n", "  The tight correlation between total galaxy stellar mass and star formation\nrate (SFR) has become known as the star forming main sequence. Using ~487,000\nspaxels from galaxies observed as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mapping\nGalaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we confirm previous\nresults that a correlation also exists between the surface densities of star\nformation (Sigma_SFR) and stellar mass (Sigma_mass) on kpc scales, representing\na `resolved' main sequence. Using a new metric (Delta Sigma_SFR), which\nmeasures the relative enhancement or deficit of star formation on a\nspaxel-by-spaxel basis relative to the resolved main sequence, we investigate\nthe SFR profiles of 864 galaxies as a function of their position relative to\nthe global star forming main sequence (Delta SFR). For galaxies above the\nglobal main sequence (positive Delta SFR) Delta Sigma_SFR is elevated\nthroughout the galaxy, but the greatest enhancement in star formation occurs at\nsmall radii (< 3 kpc, or 0.5 R_e). Moreover, galaxies that are at least a\nfactor of three above the main sequence show diluted gas phase metallicities\nout to 2 R_e, indicative of metal-poor gas inflows accompanying the starbursts.\nFor quiescent/passive galaxies that lie at least a factor of 10 below the star\nforming main sequence there is an analogous deficit of star formation\nthroughout the galaxy with the lowest values of Delta Sigma_SFR in the central\n3 kpc. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the `compaction' scenario\nin which a central starburst leads to mass growth in the bulge and may\nultimately precede galactic quenching from the inside-out.\n", "  We present two measurements of the temperature-density relationship (TDR) of\nthe intergalactic medium (IGM) in the redshift range $2.55 < z < 2.95$ using a\nsample of 13 high-quality quasar spectra and high resolution numerical\nsimulations of the IGM. Our approach is based on fitting the neutral hydrogen\ncolumn density $N_{HI}$ and the Doppler parameter $b$ of the absorption lines\nin the \\mlya\\ forest. The first measurement is obtained using a novel Bayesian\nscheme which takes into account the statistical correlations between the\nparameters characterising the lower cut-off of the $b-N_{HI}$ distribution and\nthe power-law parameters $T_0$ and $\\gamma$ describing the TDR. This approach\nyields $T_0/ 10^3\\, {\\rm K}=15.6 \\pm 4.4 $ and $\\gamma=1.45 \\pm 0.17$\nindependent of the assumed pressure smoothing of the small scale density field.\nIn order to explore the information contained in the overall $b-N_{HI}$\ndistribution rather than only the lower cut-off, we obtain a second measurement\nbased on a similar Bayesian analysis of the median Doppler parameter for\nseparate column-density ranges of the absorbers. In this case we obtain $T_0/\n10^3\\, {\\rm K}=14.6 \\pm 3.7$ and $\\gamma=1.37 \\pm 0.17$ in good agreement with\nthe first measurement. Our Bayesian analysis reveals strong anti-correlations\nbetween the inferred $T_0$ and $\\gamma$ for both methods as well as an\nanti-correlation of the inferred $T_0$ and the pressure smoothing length for\nthe second method, suggesting that the measurement accuracy can in the latter\ncase be substantially increased if independent constraints on the smoothing are\nobtained. Our results are in good agreement with other recent measurements of\nthe thermal state of the IGM probing similar (over-)density ranges.\n", "  We present high-resolution smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of a\nregion of gas flowing in a spiral arm and identify dense gas clouds to\ninvestigate their kinematics with respect to a Milky Way model. We find that,\non average, the gas in the arms can have a net radial streaming motion of $v_R\n\\approx -9 \\,\\mathrm{km/s}$ and rotate $\\approx 6 \\,\\mathrm{km/s}$ slower than\nthe circular velocity. This translates to average peculiar motions towards the\nGalaxy centre and opposite to Galactic rotation. These results may be sensitive\nto the assumed spiral arm perturbation, which is $\\approx 3\\%$ of the disc\npotential in our model. We compare the actual distance and the kinematic\nestimate and we find that streaming motions introduce systematic offsets of\n$\\approx 1$ kpc. We find that the distance error can be as large as $\\pm 2$ kpc\nand the recovered cloud positions have distributions that can extend\nsignificantly into the inter-arm regions. We conclude that this poses a\ndifficulty in tracing spiral arm structure in molecular cloud surveys.\n", "  As planning for the next generation of high contrast imaging instruments\n(e.g. WFIRST, HabEx, and LUVOIR, TMT-PFI, EELT-EPICS) matures, and\nsecond-generation ground-based extreme adaptive optics facilities (e.g.\nVLT-SPHERE, Gemini-GPI) are halfway through their principal surveys, it is\nimperative that the performance of different designs, post-processing\nalgorithms, observing strategies, and survey results be compared in a\nconsistent, statistically robust framework. In this paper, we argue that the\ncurrent industry standard for such comparisons -- the contrast curve -- falls\nshort of this mandate. We propose a new figure of merit, the \"performance map,\"\nthat incorporates three fundamental concepts in signal detection theory: the\ntrue positive fraction (TPF), false positive fraction (FPF), and detection\nthreshold. By supplying a theoretical basis and recipe for generating the\nperformance map, we hope to encourage the widespread adoption of this new\nmetric across subfields in exoplanet imaging.\n", "  We present the results of an optical spectroscopic survey of 46 heavily\nobscured quasar candidates. Objects are selected using their mid-infrared\n(mid-IR) colours and magnitudes from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer\n(WISE) and their optical magnitudes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).\nCandidate Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are selected to have mid-IR colours\nindicative of quasar activity and lie in a region of mid-IR colour space\noutside previously published X-ray based selection regions. We obtain optical\nspectra for our sample using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph on the Southern\nAfrican Large Telescope. Thirty objects (65%) have identifiable emission lines,\nallowing for the determination of spectroscopic redshifts. Other than one\nobject at $z\\sim2.6$, candidates have moderate redshifts ranging from $z=0.1$\nto $0.8$ with a median of 0.3. Twenty-one (70%) of our objects with identified\nredshift (46% of the whole sample) are identified as AGNs through common\noptical diagnostics. We model the spectral energy distributions of our sample\nand found that all require a strong AGN component, with an average intrinsic\nAGN fraction at 8$\\,\\mu$m of 0.91. Additionally, the fits require large\nextinction coefficients with an average $E(B-V)_\\textrm{AGN} = 17.8$ (average\n$A(V)_\\textrm{AGN} = 53.4$). By focusing on the area outside traditional mid-IR\nphotometric cuts, we are able to capture and characterise a population of\ndeeply buried quasars that were previously unattainable through X-ray surveys\nalone.\n", "  We present an asteroseismological analysis of four ZZ Ceti stars observed\nwith \\emph{Kepler}: GD 1212, SDSS J113655.17+040952.6, KIC 11911480 and KIC\n4552982, based on a grid of full evolutionary models of DA white dwarf stars.\nWe employ a grid of carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs models, characterized by a\ndetailed and consistent chemical inner profile for the core and the envelope.\nIn addition to the observed periods, we take into account other information\nfrom the observational data, as amplitudes, rotational splittings and period\nspacing, as well as photometry and spectroscopy. For each star, we present an\nasteroseismological model that closely reproduce their observed properties. The\nasteroseismological stellar mass and effective temperature of the target stars\nare (0.632 +/- 0.027 Msun, 10737 +/- 73 K) for GD 1212, (0.745 +/- 0.007 Msun,\n11110 +/- 69 K) for KIC 4552982, (0.5480 +/- 0.01 Msun, 12721 +/- 228 K) for\nKIC1191480 and (0.570 +/- 0.01 Msun, 12060 +/- 300 K) for SDSS\nJ113655.17+040952.6. In general, the asteroseismological values are in good\nagreement with the spectroscopy. For KIC 11911480 and SDSS J113655.17+040952.6\nwe derive a similar seismological mass, but the hydrogen envelope is an order\nof magnitude thinner for SDSS J113655.17+040952.6, that is part of a binary\nsystem and went through a common envelope phase.\n", "  We observed the newly discovered hyperbolic minor planet 1I/`Oumuamua (2017\nU1) on 2017 October 30 with Lowell Observatory's 4.3-m Discovery Channel\nTelescope. From these observations, we derived a partial lightcurve with\npeak-to-trough amplitude of at least 1.2 mag. This lightcurve segment rules out\nrotation periods less than 3 hr and suggests that the period is at least 5 hr.\nOn the assumption that the variability is due to a changing cross section, the\naxial ratio is at least 3:1. We saw no evidence for a coma or tail in either\nindividual images or in a stacked image having an equivalent exposure time of\n9000 s.\n", "  We study the dimensional aspect of the geometry of quantum spaces.\nIntroducing a physically motivated notion of the scaling dimension, we study in\ndetail the model based on a fuzzy torus. We show that for a natural choice of a\ndeformed Laplace operator, this model demonstrates quite non-trivial behaviour:\nthe scaling dimension flows from 2 in IR to 1 in UV. Unlike another model with\nthe similar property, the so-called Horava-Lifshitz model, our construction\ndoes not have any preferred direction. The dimension flow is rather achieved by\na rearrangement of the degrees of freedom. In this respect the number of\ndimensions is deceptive. Some physical consequences are discussed.\n", "  We present results of a joint {\\sl Chandra} and {\\sl XMM-Newton} analysis of\nthe Fornax Cluster, the nearest galaxy cluster in the southern sky. Signatures\nof merger-induced gas sloshing can be seen in the X-ray image. We identify four\nsloshing cold fronts in the intracluster medium, residing at radii of 3\\,kpc\n(west), 10\\,kpc (northeast), 30\\,kpc (southwest) and 200\\,kpc (east). Despite\nspanning over two orders of magnitude in radius, all four cold fronts fall onto\nthe same spiral pattern that wraps around the BCG NGC~1399, likely all\ninitiated by the infall of NGC~1404. The most evident front is to the\nnortheast, 10\\,kpc from the cluster center, which separates low-entropy\nhigh-metallicity gas and high-entropy low-metallicity gas. The metallicity map\nsuggests that gas sloshing, rather than an AGN outburst, is the driving force\nbehind the redistribution of the enriched gas in this cluster. The innermost\ncold front resides within the radius of the strong cool core. The sloshing time\nscale within the cooling radius, calculated from the Brunt-V$\\ddot{\\rm\na}$s$\\ddot{\\rm a}$l$\\ddot{\\rm a}$ frequency, is an order of magnitude shorter\nthan the cooling time. It is plausible that gas sloshing can contribute to the\nheating of the cool core, provided that gas of different entropies can be mixed\neffectively via Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The estimated age of the\noutermost front suggests that this is not the first infall of NGC~1404.\n", "  The mass growth rate of mass-accreting white dwarfs (WDs) is a key factor in\nbinary evolution scenarios toward Type Ia supernovae. Many authors have\nreported very different WD mass increasing rates. In this review, we clarify\nthe reasons for such divergence, some of which come from a lack of numerical\ntechniques, usage of old opacities, different assumptions for binary\nconfigurations, inadequate initial conditions, and unrealistic mass-loss\nmechanisms. We emphasize that these assumptions should be carefully chosen in\ncalculating the long-term evolution of accreting WDs. Importantly, the\nmass-loss mechanism is the key process determining the mass retention\nefficiency: the best approach involves correctly incorporating the optically\nthick wind because it is supported by the multiwavelength light curves of\nnovae.\n", "  We have presented the results for the single and double spin asymmetries in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings for proton in a light front\nquark-diquark model. The asymmetries generated by the T-even TMDs are discussed\nhere. The model predictions are found to agree with the available data. We also\npresent our model predictions for the Collins asymmetry for the future\nelectron-ion collider experiments.\n", "  We present new radio and optical images of the nearest radio galaxy Centaurus\nA and its host galaxy NGC 5128. We focus our investigation on the northern\ntransition region, where energy is transported from the ~5 kpc (~5 arcmin)\nscales of the Northern Inner Lobe (NIL) to the ~30 kpc (~30 arcmin) scales of\nthe Northern Middle Lobe (NML). Our Murchison Widefield Array observations at\n154 MHz and our Parkes radio telescope observations at 2.3 GHz show diffuse\nradio emission connecting the NIL to the NML, in agreement with previous\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array observations at 1.4 GHz. Comparison of these\nradio data with our widefield optical emission line images show the\nrelationship between the NML radio emission and the ionised filaments that\nextend north from the NIL, and reveal a new ionised filament to the east,\npossibly associated with a galactic wind. Our deep optical images show clear\nevidence for a bipolar outflow from the central galaxy extending to\nintermediate scales, despite the non-detection of a southern radio counterpart\nto the NML. Thus, our observational overview of Centaurus A reveals a number of\nfeatures proposed to be associated with AGN feedback mechanisms, often cited as\nlikely to have significant effects in galaxy evolution models. As one of the\nclosest galaxies to us, Centaurus A therefore provides a unique laboratory to\nexamine feedback mechanisms in detail.\n", "  It is observed that hypervelocity space dust, which is continuously\nbombarding the Earth, creates immense momentum flows in the atmosphere. Some of\nthis fast space dust inevitably will interact with the atmospheric system,\ntransferring energy and moving particles around, with various possible\nconsequences. This paper examines, with supporting estimates, the possibility\nthat through collisions, the Earth-grazing component of space dust can\nfacilitate planetary escape of atmospheric particles, whether they be the atoms\nand molecules forming the atmosphere or bigger sized particles. As one\ninteresting outcome, floating in the Earth's atmosphere are a variety of\nparticles containing the telltale signs of Earth's organic story, including\nmicrobial life and life essential molecules. This paper will assess the ability\nfor this space dust collision mechanism to propel some of these biological\nconstituents into space.\n", "  Accretion-induced collapse (AIC) is widely accepted to be one of the\nformation channels for millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Since the MSPs have high\nspindown luminosities, they can immediately start to evaporate their companion\nstars after birth. In this paper we present a detailed investigation on the\nevolution of the post-AIC binaries, taking into account the effect of\nevaporation both before and during the Roche-lobe overflow process. We discuss\nthe possible influence of the input parameters including the evaporation\nefficiency, the initial spin period and the initial surface magnetic field of\nthe newborn neutron star. We compare the calculated results with the\ntraditional low-mass X-ray binary evolution, and suggest that they may\nreproduce at least part of the observed redbacks and black widows in the\ncompanion mass - orbital period plane depending on the mechanisms of angular\nmomentum loss associated with evaporation.\n", "  We show how dense compact discrete shells of circumstellar gas immediately\noutside the red supergiants affect the optical light curves of type II-P/II-L\nSNe taking the example of SN 2013ej. The earlier efforts in the literature had\nused an artificial circumstellar medium (CSM) stitched to the surface of an\nevolved star which had not gone through a phase of late-stage heavy mass loss,\nwhich in essence, is the source of the CSM to begin with. In contrast we allow\nenhanced mass loss rate from the modeled star during the $^{16}$O and $^{28}$Si\nburning stages and construct the CSM from the resulting mass-loss history in a\nself-consistent way. Once such evolved pre-SN stars are exploded, we find that\nthe models with early interaction between the shock and the dense CSM reproduce\nthe light curves far better than those without that mass loss and hence having\nno dense, nearby CSM. The required explosion energy for the progenitors with a\ndense CSM is reduced by almost a factor of two compared to those without the\nCSM. Our model, with a more realistic CSM profile and presupernova and\nexplosion parameters, fits observed data much better throughout the rise,\nplateau and radioactive tail phases compared to previous studies. This points\nto an intermediate class of supernovae between type II-P/II-L and type II-n SNe\nwith the characteristics of simultaneous UV and optical peak, slow decline\nafter peak and a longer plateau.\n", "  We present a high resolution dissection of the two-dimensional total mass\ndistribution in the core of the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS\nJ0416.1-2403, at z ~ 0.396. We exploit HST/WFC3 near-IR (F160W) imaging,\nVLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and Chandra data to separate the stellar, hot gas, and\ndark-matter mass components in the inner 300 kpc of the cluster. We combine the\nrecent results of our refined strong lensing analysis, which includes the\ncontribution of the intracluster gas, with the modeling of the surface\nbrightness and stellar mass distributions of 193 cluster members, of which 144\nare spectroscopically confirmed. We find that moving from 10 to 300 kpc from\nthe cluster center the stellar to total mass fraction decreases from 12% to 1%\nand the hot gas to total mass fraction increases from 3% to 9%, resulting in a\nbaryon fraction of approximately 10% at the outermost radius. We measure that\nthe stellar component represents ~ 30%, near the cluster center, and 15%, at\nlarger clustercentric distances, of the total mass in the cluster\nsubstructures. We subtract the baryonic mass component from the total mass\ndistribution and conclude that within 30 kpc (~ 3 times the effective radius of\nthe BCG) from the cluster center the surface mass density profile of the total\nmass and global (cluster plus substructures) dark-matter are steeper and that\nof the diffuse (cluster) dark-matter is shallower than a NFW profile. Our\ncurrent analysis does not point to a significant offset between the cluster\nstellar and dark-matter components. This detailed and robust reconstruction of\nthe inner dark-matter distribution in a larger sample of galaxy clusters will\nset a new benchmark for different structure formation scenarios.\n", "  Radio-bright regions near the solar poles are frequently observed in Nobeyama\nRadioheliograph (NoRH) maps at 17 GHz, and often in association with coronal\nholes. However, the origin of these polar brightening has not been established\nyet. We propose that small magnetic loops are the source of these bright\npatches, and present modeling results that reproduce the main observational\ncharacteristics of the polar brightening within coronal holes at 17 GHz. The\nsimulations were carried out by calculating the radio emission of the small\nloops, with several temperature and density profiles, within a 2D coronal hole\natmospheric model. If located at high latitudes, the size of the simulated\nbright patches are much smaller than the beam size and they present the\ninstrument beam size when observed. The larger bright patches can be generated\nby a great number of small magnetic loops unresolved by the NoRH beam. Loop\nmodels that reproduce bright patches contain denser and hotter plasma near the\nupper chromosphere and lower corona. On the other hand, loops with increased\nplasma density and temperature only in the corona do not contribute to the\nemission at 17 GHz. This could explain the absence of a one-to-one association\nbetween the 17 GHz bright patches and those observed in extreme ultraviolet.\nMoreover, the emission arising from small magnetic loops located close to the\nlimb may merge with the usual limb brightening profile, increasing its\nbrightness temperature and width.\n", "  Using covariant methods, we construct and explore the Wetterich equation for\na non-minimal coupling $F(\\phi)R$ of a quantized scalar field to the Ricci\nscalar of a prescribed curved space. This includes the often considered\nnon-minimal coupling $\\xi \\phi^2 R$ as a special case. We consider the\ntruncations without and with scale- and field-dependent wave function\nrenormalization in dimensions between four and two. Thereby the main emphasis\nis on analytic and numerical solutions of the fixed point equations and the\nbehavior in the vicinity of the corresponding fixed points. We determine the\nnon-minimal coupling in the symmetric and spontaneously broken phases with\nvanishing and non-vanishing average fields, respectively. Using functional\nperturbative renormalization group methods, we discuss the leading universal\ncontributions to the RG flow below the upper critical dimension $d=4$.\n", "  We present the observations of a blowout jet that experienced two distinct\nejection stages. The first stage started from the emergence of a small positive\nmagnetic polarity, which cancelled with the nearby negative magnetic field and\ncaused the rising of a mini-filament and its confining loops. This further\nresulted in a small jet due to the magnetic reconnection between the rising\nconfining loops and the overlying open field. The second ejection stage was\nmainly due to the successive removal of the confining field by the\nreconnection. Thus that the filament erupted and the erupting cool filament\nmaterial directly combined with the hot jet originated form the reconnection\nregion and therefore formed the cool and hot components of the blowout jet.\nDuring the two ejection stages, cool H{\\alpha} jets are also observed cospatial\nwith their coronal counterparts, but their appearance times are earlier than\nthe hot coronal jets a few minutes. Therefore, the hot coronal jets are\npossibly caused by the heating of the cool H{\\alpha} jets, or the rising of the\nreconnection height from chromosphere to the corona. The scenario that magnetic\nreconnection occurred between the confining loops and the overlying open loops\nare supported by many observational facts, including the bright patches on the\nboth sides of the mini-filament, hot plasma blobs along the jet body, and\nperiodic metric radio type III bursts at the very beginnings of the two stages.\nThe evolution and characteristics of these features manifest the detailed\nnon-linear process in the magnetic reconnection.\n", "  Phobos and Deimos are the two small Martian moons, orbiting almost on the\nequatorial plane of Mars. Recent works have shown that they can accrete within\nan impact-generated inner dense and outer light disk, and that the same impact\npotentially forms the Borealis basin, a large northern hemisphere basin on the\ncurrent Mars. However, there is no a priori reason for the impact to take place\nclose to the north pole (Borealis present location) nor to generate a debris\ndisk in the equatorial plane of Mars (in which Phobos and Deimos orbit). In\nthis paper, we investigate these remaining issues on the giant impact origin of\nthe Martian moons. First, we show that the mass deficit created by the Borealis\nimpact basin induces a global reorientation of the planet to realign its main\nmoment of inertia with the rotation pole (True Polar Wander). This moves the\nlocation of the Borealis basin toward its current location. Next, using\nanalytical arguments, we investigate the detailed dynamical evolution of the\neccentric inclined disk from the equatorial plane of Mars that is formed by the\nMartian-moon-forming impact. We find that, as a result of precession of disk\nparticles due to the Martian dynamical flattening $J_{2}$ term of its gravity\nfield and particle-particle inelastic collisions, eccentricity and inclination\nare damped and an inner dense and outer light equatorial circular disk is\neventually formed. Our results strengthen the giant impact origin of Phobos and\nDeimos that can finally be tested by a future sample return mission such as\nJAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission.\n", "  Several rotational transitions of water have been identified toward evolved\nstars in the ground vibrational state as well as in the first excited state of\nthe bending mode. In the latter vibrational state of water, the 658 GHz J =\n1_1,0-1_0,1 rotational transition is often strong and seems to be widespread in\nlate-type stars. Our main goals are to better characterize the nature of the\n658 GHz emission, compare the velocity extent of the 658 GHz emission with SiO\nmaser emission to help locate the water layers and, more generally, investigate\nthe physical conditions prevailing in the excited water layers of evolved\nstars. Another goal is to identify new 658 GHz emission sources and contribute\nin showing that this emission is widespread in evolved stars. Eleven evolved\nstars were extracted from our mini-catalog of existing and potential 658 GHz\nsources for observations with the APEX telescope equipped with the SEPIA\nreceiver. The 13CO J=6-5 line was placed in the same receiver sideband for\nsimultaneous observation with the 658 GHz line of water. We have compared the\n658 GHz line properties with our H2O radiative transfer models in stars and we\nhave compared the velocity ranges of the 658 GHz and SiO J=2-1, v=1 maser\nlines. All stars show 658 GHz emission with a peak flux density in the range\n50-70 Jy to 2000-3000 Jy. We have shown that the 658 GHz line is masing and we\nfound that the 658 GHz velocity extent tends to be correlated with that of the\nSiO maser suggesting that both emission lines are excited in circumstellar\nlayers close to the central star. Broad and stable line profiles are observed\nat 658 GHz. This could indicate maser saturation although we have tentatively\nprovided first information on time variability at 658 GHz.\n", "  HD 49798/RX J0648.0--4418 is a peculiar X-ray binary with a hot subdwarf\n(sdO) mass donor. The nature of the accreting compact object is not known, but\nits spin period $P=13.2$~s and $\\dot P =-2.15 \\times 10^{-15}$s~s$^{-1}$, prove\nthat it can be only either a white dwarf or a neutron star. The spin-up has\nbeen very stable for more than 20 years. We demonstrate that the continuous\nstable spin-up of the compact companion of HD 49798 can be best explained by\ncontraction of a young white dwarf with an age $\\sim 2$~Myrs. This allows us to\ninterpret all the basic parameters of the system in the framework of an\naccreting white dwarf. We present examples of binary evolution which result in\nsuch systems. If correct, this is the first direct evidence for a white dwarf\ncontraction on early evolutionary stages.\n", "  We report the discovery of a ~100 kpc ionized nebula associated with the\nradio quiet type 2 quasar (QSO2) nicknamed the \"Teacup\" (z=0.085). The giant\nnebula is among the largest known around active galaxies at any z. We propose\nthat it is part of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the QSO2 host, which has\nbeen populated with tidal debris by galactic interactions. This rich gaseous\nmedium has been rendered visible due to the illumination by the powerful active\nnucleus (AGN). Subsolar abundances (~0.5Z(sun)) are tentatively favored by AGN\nphotoionization models. We also report the detection of coronal emission (Fe+6)\nfrom the NE bubble, at ~9 kpc from the AGN. The detection of coronal lines at\nsuch large distances from the AGN and the [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha,\n[OI]/Halpha optical emission line ratios of the giant nebula are consistent\nwith the fading quasar scenario proposed by Gagne et al. (2014). The fading\nrate appears to have been faster in the last ~46,000 yr. Deep wide field\nintegral field spectroscopy of giant nebulae around powerful AGN such as the\n\"Teacup's\" with instruments such as MUSE on VLT opens up a way to detect and\nstudy the elusive material from the CGM around massive active galaxies thanks\nto the illumination by the luminous AGN.\n", "  We present sixteen occultation and three transit light curves for the\nultra-short period hot Jupiter WASP-103 b, in addition to five new radial\nvelocity measurements. We combine these observations with archival data and\nperform a global analysis of the resulting extensive dataset, accounting for\nthe contamination from a nearby star. We detect the thermal emission of the\nplanet in both the $z'$ and $K_{\\mathrm{S}}$-bands, the measured occultation\ndepths being 699$\\pm$110 ppm (6.4-$\\sigma$) and $3567_{-350}^{+400}$ ppm\n(10.2-$\\sigma$), respectively. We use these two measurements together with\nrecently published HST/WFC3 data to derive joint constraints on the properties\nof WASP-103 b's dayside atmosphere. On one hand, we find that the $z'$-band and\nWFC3 data are best fit by an isothermal atmosphere at 2900 K or an atmosphere\nwith a low H$_2$O abundance. On the other hand, we find an unexpected excess in\nthe $K_{\\mathrm{S}}$-band measured flux compared to these models, which\nrequires confirmation with additional observations before any interpretation\ncan be given. From our global data analysis, we also derive a broad-band\noptical transmission spectrum that shows a minimum around 700 nm and increasing\nvalues towards both shorter and longer wavelengths. This is in agreement with a\nprevious study based on a large fraction of the archival transit light curves\nused in our analysis. The unusual profile of this transmission spectrum is\npoorly matched by theoretical spectra and is not confirmed by more recent\nobservations at higher spectral resolution. Additional data, both in emission\nand transmission, are required to better constrain the atmospheric properties\nof WASP-103 b.\n", "  Faraday rotation and synchrotron emission from extragalactic radio sources\ngive evidence for the presence of magnetic fields extending over ~Mpc scales.\nHowever, the origin of these fields remains elusive. With new high-resolution\ngrid simulations we studied the growth of magnetic fields in a massive galaxy\ncluster that in several aspects is similar to the Coma cluster. We investigated\nmodels in which magnetic fields originate from primordial seed fields with\ncomoving strengths of 0.1 nG at redshift z=30. The simulations show evidence of\nsignificant magnetic field amplification. At the best spatial resolution (3.95\nkpc), we are able to resolve the scale where magnetic tension balances the\nbending of magnetic lines by turbulence. This allows us to observe the final\ngrowth stage of the small-scale dynamo. To our knowledge this is the first time\nthat this is seen in cosmological simulations of the intracluster medium. Our\nmock observations of Faraday Rotation provide a good match to observations of\nthe Coma cluster. However, the distribution of magnetic fields shows strong\ndepartures from a simple Maxwellian distribution, suggesting that the\nthree-dimensional structure of magnetic fields in real clusters may be\nsignificantly different than what is usually assumed when inferring magnetic\nfield values from rotation measure observations.\n", "  The signatures of planets hosted by M dwarfs are more readily detected with\ntransit photometry and radial velocity methods than those of planets around\nlarger stars. Recently, transit photometry was used to discover seven planets\norbiting the late-M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Three of TRAPPIST-1's planets fall in the\nHabitable Zone, a region where liquid water could exist on the planetary\nsurface given appropriate planetary conditions. We aim to investigate the\nhabitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets by studying the star's activity and its\neffect on the planets. We analyze previously-published space- and ground-based\nlight curves and show the photometrically-determined rotation period of\nTRAPPIST-1 appears to vary over time due to complicated, evolving surface\nactivity. The dramatic changes of the surface of TRAPPIST-1 suggest that\nrotation periods determined photometrically may not be reliable for this and\nsimilarly active stars. While the activity of the star is low, we use the\npremise of the \"cosmic shoreline\" to provide evidence that the TRAPPIST-1\nenvironment has potentially led to the erosion of possible planetary\natmospheres by extreme ultraviolet stellar emission.\n", "  Gravity darkening induced by rapid stellar rotation provides us with a unique\nopportunity to characterize the spin-orbit misalignment of a planetary system\nthrough analysis of its photometric transit. We use the gravity-darkened\ntransit modeling code simuTrans to reproduce the transit light curve of\nKepler-13Ab by separately analyzing phase-folded transits for 12 short-cadence\nKepler quarters. We verify the temporal change in impact parameter indicative\nof spin-orbit precession identified by Szab\\'o et al. (2012) and Masuda (2015),\nreporting a rate of change $db/dt = (-4.1 \\pm 0.2) \\times 10^{-5}$ day$^{-1}$.\nWe further investigate the effect of light dilution on the fitted impact\nparameter and find that less than 1% of additional light is sufficient to\nexplain the seasonal variation seen in the Kepler quarter data. We then extend\nour precession analysis to the phase curve data from which we report a rate of\nchange $db/dt = (-3.2 \\pm 1.3) \\times 10^{-5}$ day$^{-1}$. This value is\nconsistent with that of the transit data at a lower significance and provides\nthe first evidence of spin-orbit precession based solely on the temporal\nvariation of the secondary eclipse.\n", "  We present a coupled 3-D atmospheric dynamics and radiative transfer model to\npredict the disk-integrated thermal emission spectra of transiting exoplanets\nin edge-on orbits. We calculate spectra at high resolution to examine the\nextent to which high-resolution emission spectra are influenced by 3-D\natmospheric dynamics and planetary rotation, and to determine whether and how\nwe can constrain thermal structures and atmospheric dynamics through\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy. This study represents the first time that the\nline-of-sight geometry and resulting Doppler shifts from winds and rotation\nhave been treated self-consistently in an emission spectrum radiative transfer\nmodel, which allow us to assess the impact of the velocity field on thermal\nemission spectra. We apply our model to predict emission spectra as a function\nof orbital phase for three hot Jupiters, HD 209458b, WASP-43b and HD 189733b.\nWe find net Doppler shifts in modeled spectra due to a combination of winds and\nrotation at a level of 1-3 km/s. These Doppler signatures vary in a\nquasi-sinusoidal pattern over the course of the planets' orbits as the hot\nspots approach and recede from the observer's viewpoint. We predict that\nWASP-43b produces the largest Doppler shift due to its fast rotation rate. We\nfind that the net Doppler shift in an exoplanet's disk-integrated thermal\nemission spectrum results from a complex combination of winds, rotation, and\nthermal structure. However, we offer a simple method that estimates the\nmagnitude of equatorial wind speeds in hot Jupiters through measurements of net\nDoppler shifts and lower resolution thermal phase curves.\n", "  We here present the spectroscopic follow-up observations with VLT/X-shooter\nof the Swift long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 160804A at z = 0.737. Typically,\nGRBs are found in low-mass, metal-poor galaxies which constitute the\nsub-luminous population of star-forming galaxies. For the host galaxy of the\nGRB presented here we derive a stellar mass of $\\log(M_*/M_{\\odot}) = 9.80\\pm\n0.07$, a roughly solar metallicity (12+log(O/H) = $8.74\\pm 0.12$) based on\nemission line diagnostics, and an infrared luminosity of $M_{3.6/(1+z)} =\n-21.94$ mag, but find it to be dust-poor ($E(B-V) < 0.05$ mag). This\nestablishes the galaxy hosting GRB 160804A as one of the most luminous, massive\nand metal-rich GRB hosts at z < 1.5. Furthermore, the gas-phase metallicity is\nfound to be representative of the physical conditions of the gas close to the\nexplosion site of the burst. The high metallicity of the host galaxy is also\nobserved in absorption, where we detect several strong FeII transitions as well\nas MgII and MgI. While host galaxy absorption features are common in GRB\nafterglow spectra, we detect absorption from strong metal lines directly in the\nhost continuum (at a time when the afterglow was contributing to < 15%).\nFinally, we discuss the possibility that the geometry and state of the\nabsorbing and emitting gas is indicative of a galactic scale outflow expelled\nat the final stage of two merging galaxies.\n", "  The early X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually well\ndescribed by absorbed power laws. However, in some cases, additional thermal\ncomponents have been identified. The origin of this emission is debated, with\nproposed explanations including supernova shock breakout, emission from a\ncocoon surrounding the jet, as well as emission from the jet itself. A larger\nsample of detections is needed in order to place constraints on these different\nmodels. Here we present a time-resolved spectral analysis of 74 GRBs observed\nby Swift XRT in a search for thermal components. We report six detections in\nour sample, and also confirm an additional three cases that were previously\nreported in the literature. The majority of these bursts have a narrow range of\nblackbody radii around ~ 2 x 10^{12} cm, despite having a large range of\nluminosities (L ~ 10^{47} - 10^{51} erg s^{-1}). This points to an origin\nconnected to the progenitor stars, and we suggest that emission from a cocoon\nbreaking out from a thick wind may explain the observations. For two of the\nbursts in the sample, an explanation in terms of late prompt emission from the\njet is instead more likely. We also find that these thermal components are\npreferentially detected when the X-ray luminosity is low, which suggests that\nthey may be hidden by bright afterglows in the majority of GRBs.\n", "  We present a proof of concept on the coupling of radio astronomical receivers\nand spectrometers with chemical reactorsand the performances of the resulting\nsetup for spectroscopy and chemical simulations in laboratory astrophysics.\nSeveral experiments including cold plasma generation and UV photochemistry were\nperformed in a 40\\,cm long gas cell placed in the beam path of the Aries 40\\,m\nradio telescope receivers operating in the 41-49 GHz frequency range interfaced\nwith fast Fourier transform spectrometers providing 2 GHz bandwidth and 38 kHz\nresolution.\n  The impedance matching of the cell windows has been studied using different\nmaterials. The choice of the material and its thickness was critical to obtain\na sensitivity identical to that of standard radio astronomical observations.\n  Spectroscopic signals arising from very low partial pressures of CH3OH,\nCH3CH2OH, HCOOH, OCS,CS, SO2 (<1E-03 mbar) were detected in a few seconds. Fast\ndata acquisition was achieved allowing for kinetic measurements in\nfragmentation experiments using electron impact or UV irradiation. Time\nevolution of chemical reactions involving OCS, O2 and CS2 was also observed\ndemonstrating that reactive species, such as CS, can be maintained with high\nabundance in the gas phase during these experiments.\n", "  We describe polarization of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect associated\nwith electron pressure anisotropy likely present in the intracluster medium\n(ICM). The ICM is an astrophysical example of a weakly collisional plasma where\nthe Larmor frequencies of charged particles greatly exceed their collision\nfrequencies. This permits formation of pressure anisotropies, driven by\nevolving magnetic fields via adiabatic invariance, or by heat fluxes. SZ\npolarization arises in the process of Compton scattering of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons off the thermal ICM electrons due to the\ndifference in the characteristic thermal velocities of the electrons along two\nmutually orthogonal directions in the sky plane. The signal scales linearly\nwith the optical depth of the region containing large-scale correlated\nanisotropy, and with the degree of anisotropy itself. It has the same spectral\ndependence as the polarization induced by cluster motion with respect to the\nCMB frame (kinematic SZ effect polarization), but can be distinguished by its\nspatial pattern. { For the illustrative case of a galaxy cluster with a cold\nfront, where electron transport is mediated by Coulomb collisions, we estimate\nthe CMB polarization degree at the level of 10$^{-8}$ ($\\sim 10$ nK). An\nincrease of the effective electron collisionality due to plasma instabilities\nwill reduce the effect. Such polarization, therefore, may be an independent\nprobe of the electron collisionality in the ICM, which is one of the key\nproperties of a high-$\\beta$ weakly collisional plasma from the point of view\nof both astrophysics and plasma theory.\n", "  Transitional millisecond pulsars are systems that alternate between an\naccreting low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) state, and a non-accreting radio pulsar\nstate. When at the LMXB state, their X-ray and optical light curves show rapid\nflares and dips, origin of which is not well understood. We present results\nfrom our optical and NIR observing campaign of PSR J1023+0038, a transitional\nmillisecond pulsar observed in an accretion state. Our wide band optical\nphotopolarimetry indicates that the system shows intrinsic linear polarisation,\nthe degree of which is anticorrelated with optical emission, i.e. the\npolarisation could be diluted during the flares. However, the change in\nposition angle during the flares suggests an additional emerging polarised\ncomponent during the flares. We also find, based on our H$_\\alpha$ spectroscopy\nand Doppler tomography, that there is indication for change in the accretion\ndisc structure/emission during the flares, possibly due to a change in\naccretion flow. This, together with changing polarisation during the flares,\ncould mark the existence of magnetic propeller mass ejection process in the\nsystem. Furthermore, our analysis of flare profiles in both optical and NIR\nshows that NIR flares are at least as powerful as the optical ones and both can\nexhibit transition time scales less than 3 sec. The optical/NIR flares\ntherefore seem to originate from a separate, polarised transient component,\nwhich might be due to Thomson scattering from propeller ejected matter.\n", "  A semiclassical approach that incorporates quantum mechanical behavior of\nheat capacity in direct caloric effect simulations is proposed. Application of\nthis methodology to study electrocaloric effect in prototypical ferroelectrics\n${ \\rm PbTiO_3 }$, and ${ \\rm BaTiO_3 }$, reveals severe underestimation of\nelectrocaloric response at lowest temperatures by classical simulations. The\ndiscrepancy between semiclassical and classical results are found to be largest\nin ferroics with Debye temperature exceeding the Curie point. A route to\nenhance electrocaloric effect by tuning the Debye temperature in composite\nmaterials is proposed.\n", "  We present Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray, VLA radio, and optical observations\nof three candidate Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio galaxies. CSS sources are\ngalactic scale and are presumably driving a shock through the ISM of their host\ngalaxy. B3 1445+410 is a low excitation emission line CSS radio galaxy with\npossibly a hybrid Fanaroff-Riley FRI/II (or Fat Double) radio morphology. The\nChandra observations reveal a point-like source which is well fit with a power\nlaw consistent with emission from a Doppler boosted core. 3C 268.3 is a CSS\nbroad line radio galaxy whose Chandra data are consistent spatially with a\npoint source centered on the nucleus and spectrally with a double power-law\nmodel. PKS B1017-325 is a low excitation emission line radio galaxy with a bent\ndouble radio morphology. While from our new spectroscopic redshift, PKS\nB1017-325 falls outside the formal definition of a CSS, the XMNM-Newton\nobservations are consistent with ISM emission with either a contribution from\nhot shocked gas or non-thermal jet emission. We compile selected radio and\nX-ray properties of the nine bona fide CSS radio galaxies with X-ray detections\nso far. We find that 2/9 show X-ray spectroscopic evidence for hot shocked gas.\nWe note that the counts in the sources are low and the properties of the 2\nsources with evidence for hot shocked gas are typical of the other CSS radio\ngalaxies. We suggest that hot shocked gas may be typical of CSS radio galaxies\ndue to their propagation through their host galaxies.\n", "  We present new HST ACS observations and detailed models for a recently\ndiscovered edge-on protoplanetary disk around ESO H$\\alpha$ 569 (a low-mass T\nTauri star in the Cha I star forming region). Using radiative transfer models\nwe probe the distribution of the grains and overall shape of the disk\n(inclination, scale height, dust mass, flaring exponent and surface/volume\ndensity exponent) by model fitting to multiwavelength (F606W and F814W) HST\nobservations together with a literature compiled spectral energy distribution.\nA new tool set was developed for finding optimal fits of MCFOST radiative\ntransfer models using the MCMC code emcee to efficiently explore the high\ndimensional parameter space. It is able to self-consistently and simultaneously\nfit a wide variety of observables in order to place constraints on the physical\nproperties of a given disk, while also rigorously assessing the uncertainties\nin those derived properties. We confirm that ESO H$\\alpha$ 569 is an optically\nthick nearly edge-on protoplanetary disk. The shape of the disk is well\ndescribed by a flared disk model with an exponentially tapered outer edge,\nconsistent with models previously advocated on theoretical grounds and\nsupported by millimeter interferometry. The scattered light images and spectral\nenergy distribution are best fit by an unusually high total disk mass (gas+dust\nassuming a ratio of 100:1) with a disk-to-star mass ratio of 0.16.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD)\nfrom redshift z=20 to z=0 and compare it with the observational one by Madau\nand Dickinson derived from recent compilations of UV and IR data. The\ntheoretical SFRD(z) and its evolution are obtained using a simple model which\nfolds together the star formation histories of prototype galaxies designed to\nrepresent real objects of different morphological type along the Hubble\nsequence and the hierarchical growing of structures under the action of gravity\nfrom small perturbations to large scale objects in \\Lambda-CDM cosmogony, i.e.\nthe number density of dark matter halos N(M,z). Although the overall model is\nvery simple and easy to set up, it provides results that well mimic those\nobtained from large scale N-body simulations of great complexity. The\nsimplicity of our approach allows us to test different assumptions for the star\nformation law in galaxies, the effects of energy feedback from stars to\ninterstellar gas and the efficiency of galactic winds, and also the effect of\nN(M,z). The result of our analysis is that in the framework of the hierarchical\nassembly of galaxies the so-called time-delayed star formation under plain\nassumptions mainly for the energy feedback and galactic winds can reproduce the\nobservational SFRD(z).\n", "  A more fine-tuned method for probing planet-forming regions, such as\nprotoplanetary discs, could be rovibrational molecular spectroscopy observation\nof particular premineral molecules instead of more common but ultimately less\nrelated volatile organic compounds. Planets are created when grains aggregate,\nbut how molecules form grains is an ongoing topic of discussion in astrophysics\nand planetary science. Using the spectroscopic data of molecules specifically\ninvolved in mineral formation could help to map regions where planet formation\nis believed to be occurring in order to examine the interplay between gas and\ndust. Four atoms are frequently associated with planetary formation: Fe, Si,\nMg, and O. Magnesium, in particular, has been shown to be in higher relative\nabundance in planet-hosting stars. Magnesium oxide crystals comprise the\nmineral periclase making it the chemically simplest magnesium-bearing mineral\nand a natural choice for analysis. The monomer, dimer, and trimer forms of\n(MgO)_n with n = 1 - 3 are analyzed in this work using high-level quantum\nchemical computations known to produce accurate results. Strong vibrational\ntransitions at 12.5 {\\mu}m, 15.0 {\\mu}m, and 16.5 {\\mu}m are indicative of\nmagnesium oxide monomer, dimer, and trimer making these wavelengths of\nparticular interest for the observation of protoplanetary discs and even\npotentially planet-forming regions around stars. If such transitions are\nobserved in emission from the accretion discs or absorptions from stellar\nspectra, the beginning stages of mineral and, subsequently, rocky body\nformation could be indicated.\n", "  Recent sub-millimeter observations show non-axisymmetric brightness\ndistributions with a horseshoe-like morphology for more than a dozen transition\ndisks. The most accepted explanation for the observed asymmetries is the\naccumulation of dust in large-scale vortices. Protoplanetary disks vortices can\nform by the excitation of Rossby-wave instability in the vicinity of a steep\npressure gradient, which can develop at the edges of a giant planet carved gap\nor at the edges of an accretionally inactive zone. We studied the formation and\nevolution of vortices formed in these two distinct scenarios by means of\ntwo-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamic simulations. We found that the\nvortex formed at the edge of a planetary gap is short-lived, unless the disk is\nnearly inviscid. In contrast, the vortex formed at the outer edge of a dead\nzone is long-lived. The vortex morphology can be significantly different in the\ntwo scenarios: the vortex radial and azimuthal extensions are ~1.5 and ~3.5\ntimes larger for the dead zone edge compared to gap models. In some particular\ncases, the vortex aspect ratios can be similar in the two scenarios, however,\nthe vortex azimuthal extensions can be used to distinguish the vortex formation\nmechanisms. We calculate predictions for vortex observability in the\nsub-millimeter continuum with ALMA. We found that the azimuthal and radial\nextent of brightness asymmetry correlates with vortex formation process, within\nthe limitations of alpha-viscosity prescription.\n", "  The first four gravitational wave events detected by LIGO were all\ninterpreted as merging black hole binaries (BHBs), opening a new perspective on\nthe study of such systems. Here we use our new population-synthesis code MOBSE,\nan upgraded version of BSE (Hurley et al. 2002), to investigate the demography\nof merging BHBs. MOBSE includes metallicity-dependent prescriptions for mass\nloss of massive hot stars. It also accounts for the impact of the\nelectron-scattering Eddington factor on mass loss. We perform >10^8 simulations\nof isolated massive binaries, with 12 different metallicities, to study the\nimpact of mass loss, core-collapse supernovae and common envelope on merging\nBHBs. Accounting for the dependence of stellar winds on the Eddington factor\nleads to the formation of black holes (BHs) with mass up to 65 Msun at\nmetallicity Z~0.0002. However, most BHs in merging BHBs have masses <40 Msun.\nWe find merging BHBs with mass ratios in the 0.1 - 1.0 range, even if mass\nratios >0.6 are more likely. We predict that systems like GW150914, GW170814\nand GW170104 can form only from progenitors with metallicity Z<=0.006, Z<=0.008\nand Z<=0.012, respectively. Most merging BHBs have gone through a common\nenvelope phase, but up to ~17 per cent merging BHBs at low metallicity did not\nundergo any common envelope phase. We find a much higher number of mergers from\nmetal-poor progenitors than from metal-rich ones: the number of BHB mergers per\nunit mass is ~10^-4 Msun^-1 at low metallicity (Z = 0.0002 - 0.002) and drops\nto ~10^-7 Msun^-1 at high metallicity (Z ~ 0.02).\n", "  Spiral arms have been observed in nearly a dozen protoplanetary discs in\nnear-infrared scattered light and recently also in the sub-millimetre\ncontinuum. While one of the most compelling explanations is that they are\ndriven by planetary or stellar companions, in all but one cases such companions\nhave not yet been detected and there is even ambiguity on whether the planet\nshould be located inside or outside the spirals. Here we use 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations to study the morphology of spiral density waves launched by\nembedded planets taking into account the vertical temperature gradient, a\nnatural consequence of stellar irradiation. Our simulations show that the pitch\nangle of the spirals in thermally stratified discs is the lowest in the disc\nmid-plane and increases towards the disc surface. We combine the hydrodynamic\nsimulations with 3D radiative transfer calculations to predict that the\npitch-angle of planetary spirals observed in the near-infrared is higher than\nin the sub-millimetre. We also find that in both cases the spirals converge\ntowards the planet. This provides a new powerful observational method to\ndetermine if the perturbing planet is inside our outside the spirals, as well\nas map the thermal stratification of the disc.\n", "  Important insights into the formation and evolution of the Galactic disc(s)\nare contained in the chemical compositions of stars. We analysed\nhigh-resolution and high signal to noise HARPS spectra of 79 solar twin stars\nin order to obtain precise determinations of their atmospheric parameters, ages\n($\\sigma$$\\sim$0.4 Gyr) and chemical abundances ($\\sigma$$<$0.01~dex) of 12\nneutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, and Dy).\nThis valuable dataset allows us to study the [X/Fe]-age relations over a time\ninterval of $\\sim$10 Gyr and among stars belonging to the thin and thick discs.\nThese relations show that i) the $s$-process has been the main channel of\nnucleosynthesis of $n$-capture elements during the evolution of the thin disc;\nii) the thick disc is rich in $r$-process elements which suggests that its\nformation has been rapid and intensive. %; iii) a chemical continuity between\nthe thin and thick discs is evident in the abundances of Ba. In addition, the\nheavy (Ba, La, Ce) and light (Sr, Y, Zr) $s$-process elements revealed details\non the dependence between the yields of AGB stars and the stellar mass or\nmetallicity. Finally, we confirmed that both [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al] ratios can be\nemployed as stellar clocks, allowing ages of solar twin stars to be estimated\nwith an average precision of $\\sim$0.5~Gyr.\n", "  Hydrogen, being the most abundant element, is the driver of many if not most\nreactions occurring on interstellar dust grains. In hydrogen atom addition\nreactions, the rate is usually determined by the surface kinetics of the\nhydrogen atom instead of the other reaction partner. Three mechanisms exist to\nexplain hydrogen addition reactions on surfaces: Langmuir-Hinshelwood,\nEley-Rideal, and hot-atom. In gas-grain models, which mechanism is assumed\ngreatly affects the simulation results. In this work, we quantify the\ntemperature dependence of the rates of atomic hydrogen addition reactions by\nstudying the reaction of H+O$_3$$\\rightarrow$O$_2$+OH on the surface of a film\nof non-porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW) in the temperature range from 10 K\nto 50 K. The reaction rate is found to be temperature independent. This\ndisagrees with the results of simulations with a network of rate equations that\nassume Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism through either thermal diffusion or\ntunneling diffusion; the reaction rates assuming such mechanism possesses a\nstrong temperature dependence, either explicitly or implicitly, that is not\nseen experimentally. We suggest that the Eley-Rideal and/or hot-atom mechanism\nplay a key role in hydrogen atom addition reactions, and should be included in\ngas-grain models. We also suggest that our newly developed time-resolved\nreactive scattering can be utilized to measure the chemical desorption\nefficiency in grain surface reactions.\n", "  We study the spiral arm morphology of a sample of the local spiral galaxies\nin the Illustris simulation and explore the supermassive black hole - galaxy\nconnection beyond the bulge (e.g., spiral arm pitch angle, total stellar mass,\ndark matter mass, and total halo mass), finding good agreement with other\ntheoretical studies and observational constraints. It is important to study the\nproperties of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies through both\nobservations and simulations and compare their results in order to understand\ntheir physics and formative histories.We find that Illustris prediction for\nsupermassive black hole mass relative to pitch angle is in rather good\nagreement with observations and that barred and non-barred galaxies follow\nsimilar scaling relations. Our work shows that Illustris presents very tight\ncorrelations between supermassive black hole mass and large-scale properties of\nthe host galaxy, not only for early-type galaxies but also low-mass, blue and\nstar-forming galaxies. These tight relations beyond the bulge suggest that halo\nproperties determine those of a disc galaxy and its supermassive black hole.\n", "  We apply the GC3 stream-finding method to RR Lyrae stars (RRLS) in the\nCatalina survey. We find two RRLS stream candidates at $>4\\sigma$ confidence\nand another 12 at $>3.5\\sigma$ confidence over the Galactocentric distance\nrange $4 < D/{\\rm kpc} < 26$. Of these, only two are associated with known\nglobular clusters (NGC 1261 and Arp2). The remainder are candidate `orphan'\nstreams, consistent with the idea that globular cluster streams are most\nvisible close to dissolution. Our detections are likely a lower bound on the\ntotal number of dissolving globulars in the inner galaxy, since many globulars\nhave few RRLS while only the brightest streams are visible over the Galactic\nRRLS background, particularly given the current lack of kinematical\ninformation. We make all of our candidate streams publicly available and\nprovide a new GALSTREAMS Python library for the footprints of all known streams\nand overdensities in the Milky Way.\n", "  We present a high angular resolution ($\\sim 0.2^{\\prime\\prime}$), high\nsensitivity ($\\sigma \\sim 0.2$ mJy) survey of the 870 $\\mu$m continuum emission\nfrom the circumstellar material around 49 pre-main sequence stars in the $\\rho$\nOphiuchus molecular cloud. Because most millimeter instruments have resided in\nthe northern hemisphere, this represents the largest high-resolution,\nmillimeter-wave survey of the circumstellar disk content of this cloud. Our\nsurvey of 49 systems comprises 63 stars; we detect disks associated with 29\nsingle sources, 11 binaries, 3 triple systems and 4 transition disks. We\npresent flux and radius distributions for these systems; in particular, this is\nthe first presentation of a reasonably complete probability distribution of\ndisk radii at millimeter-wavelengths. We also compare the flux distribution of\nthese protoplanetary disks with that of the disk population of the\nTaurus-Auriga molecular cloud. We find that disks in binaries are both\nsignificantly smaller and have much less flux than their counterparts around\nisolated stars. We compute truncation calculations on our binary sources and\nfind that these disks are too small to have been affected by tidal truncation\nand posit some explanations for this. Lastly, our survey found 3 candidate\ngapped disks, one of which is a newly identified transition disk with no\nsignature of a dip in infrared excess in extant observations.\n", "  Black holes, anywhere in the stellar-mass to supermassive range, are often\nassociated with relativistic jets. Models suggest that jet production may be a\nuniversal process common in all black hole systems regardless of their mass.\nAlthough in many cases observations support such hypotheses for microquasars\nand Seyfert galaxies, little is known on whether boosted blazar jets also\ncomply with such universal scaling laws. We use uniquely rich multiwavelength\nradio light curves from the F-GAMMA program and the most accurate Doppler\nfactors available to date to probe blazar jets in their emission rest frame\nwith unprecedented accuracy. We identify for the first time a strong\ncorrelation between the blazar intrinsic broad-band radio luminosity and black\nhole mass, which extends over $\\sim$ 9 orders of magnitude down to microquasars\nscales. Our results reveal the presence of a universal scaling law that bridges\nthe observing and emission rest frames in beamed sources and allows us to\neffectively constrain jet models. They consequently provide an independent\nmethod for estimating the Doppler factor, and for predicting expected radio\nluminosities of boosted jets operating in systems of intermediate or\ntens-of-solar mass black holes, immediately applicable to cases as those\nrecently observed by LIGO.\n", "  We present detailed modeling of the spatial distributions of gas and dust in\n57 circumstellar disks in the Upper Scorpius OB Association observed with ALMA\nat sub-millimeter wavelengths. We fit power-law models to the dust surface\ndensity and CO $J$ = 3-2 surface brightness to measure the radial extent of\ndust and gas in these disks. We found that these disks are extremely compact:\nthe 25 highest signal-to-noise disks have a median dust outer radius of 21 au,\nassuming an $R^{-1}$ dust surface density profile. Our lack of CO detections in\nthe majority of our sample is consistent with these small disk sizes assuming\nthe dust and CO share the same spatial distribution. Of seven disks in our\nsample with well-constrained dust and CO radii, four appear to be more extended\nin CO, although this may simply be due to higher optical depth of the CO.\nComparison of the Upper Sco results with recent analyses of disks in Taurus,\nOphiuchus, and Lupus suggests that the dust disks in Upper Sco may be $\\sim3$\ntimes smaller in size than their younger counterparts, although we caution that\na more uniform analysis of the data across all regions is needed. We discuss\nthe implications of these results for disk evolution.\n", "  We revisit the classical theory of a relativistic massless charged point\nparticle with spin and interacting with an external electromagnetic field. In\nparticular, we give a proper definition of its kinetic energy and its total\nenergy, the latter being conserved when the external field is stationary. We\nalso write the conservation laws for the linear and angular momenta. Finally,\nwe find that the particle's velocity may differ from $c$ as a result of the\nspin---electromagnetic field interaction, without jeopardizing Lorentz\ninvariance.\n", "  The first observation of the resolved Mims electron-nuclear double resonance\n(ENDOR) spectra from the nearby and remote nuclei of 19F and 7Li nuclei on\nimpurity Ce3+ ions in LiYF4 crystal is reported. It shows that LiYF4:Ce3+\nsystem can be exploited as a convenient matrix for performing spin\nmanipulations and adjusting quantum computation protocols while ENDOR technique\ncould be used for the investigation of electron-nuclear interaction with all\nthe nuclei of the system and exploited for the electron-nuclear spin\nmanipulations.\n", "  The Magellanic Stream, a gaseous tail that trails behind the Magellanic\nClouds, could replenish the Milky Way with a tremendous amount of gas if it\nreaches the Galactic disk before it evaporates into the halo. To determine how\nthe Magellanic Stream's properties change along its length, we have conducted\nan observational study of the H-alpha emission, along with other optical warm\nionized gas tracers, toward 39 sight lines. Using the Wisconsin H-alpha Mapper\ntelescope, we detect H-alpha emission brighter than 30 - 50 mR in 26 of our 39\nsight lines. This H-alpha emission extends more than 2-degree away from the HI\nemission. By comparing H-alpha and [OI] intensities, we find that regions with\nlog NHI = 19.5 - 20.0 are 16 - 67% ionized. Most of the H-alpha intensities\nalong the Magellanic Stream are much higher than expected if the primary\nionization source is photoionization from Magellanic Clouds, the Milky Way, and\nthe extragalactic background. We find that the additional contribution from\nself ionization through a \"shock cascade\" that results as the Stream plows\nthrough the halo might be sufficient to reproduce the underlying level of\nH-alpha emission along the Stream. In the sparsely sampled region below the\nSouth Galactic Pole, there exists a subset of sight lines with\nuncharacteristically bright emission, which suggest that gas is being ionized\nfurther by an additional source that could be a linked to energetic processes\nassociated with the Galactic center.\n", "  We present a spectral and timing study of the NuSTAR and Swift observations\nof the black hole candidate IGR J17091-3624 in the hard state during its\noutburst in 2016. Disk reflection is detected in each of the NuSTAR spectra\ntaken in three epochs. Fitting with relativistic reflection models reveals that\nthe accretion disk is truncated during all epochs with $R_{\\rm in}>10~r_{\\rm\ng}$, with the data favoring a low disk inclination of $\\sim\n30^{\\circ}-40^{\\circ}$. The steepening of the continuum spectra between epochs\nis accompanied by a decrease in the high energy cut-off: the electron\ntemperature $kT_{\\rm e}$ drops from $\\sim 64$ keV to $\\sim 26$ keV, changing\nsystematically with the source flux. We detect type-C QPOs in the power spectra\nwith frequency varying between 0.131 Hz and 0.327 Hz. In addition, a secondary\npeak is found in the power spectra centered at about 2.3 times the QPO\nfrequency during all three epochs. The nature of this secondary frequency is\nuncertain, however a non-harmonic origin is favored. We investigate the\nevolution of the timing and spectral properties during the rising phase of the\noutburst and discuss their physical implications.\n", "  In this chapter I give an overall description of the structure and evolution\nof stars of different masses, and review the main ingredients included in\nstate-of-the-art calculations aiming at reproducing observational features. I\ngive particular emphasis to processes where large uncertainties still exist as\nthey have strong impact on stellar properties derived from large compilations\nof tracks and isochrones, and are therefore of fundamental importance in many\nfields of astrophysics.\n", "  The optimal source-finding strategy for linear polarization data is an\nunsolved problem, with many inhibitive factors imposed by the\ntechnically-challenging nature of polarization observations. Such an algorithm\nis essential for Square Kilometre Array (SKA) pathfinder surveys, such as the\nMultifrequency Snapshot Sky Survey (MSSS) with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR),\nas data volumes are significant enough to prohibit manual inspection. We\npresent a new strategy of `Faraday Moments' for source-finding in linear\npolarization with LOFAR, using the moments of the frequency-dependent\nfull-Stokes data (i.e. the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess\nkurtosis). Through simulations of the sky, we find that moments can identify\npolarized sources with a high completeness: 98.5% at a signal-to-noise of 5.\nWhile the method has low reliability, Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis can be\napplied per candidate source to filter out instrumental and spurious\ndetections. This combined strategy will result in a complete and reliable\ncatalogue of polarized sources that includes the full sensitivity of the\nobservational bandwidth. We find that the technique can reduce the number of\npixels on which RM Synthesis needs to be performed by a factor of\n$\\approx1\\times10^{5}$ for source distributions anticipated with modern radio\ntelescopes. Through tests on LOFAR data, we find that the technique works\neffectively in the presence of diffuse emission. Extensions of this method are\ndirectly applicable to other upcoming radio surveys such as the POlarization\nSky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) with the Australia Square\nKilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and the SKA itself.\n", "  Kinetic jet power estimates based exclusively on observed monochromatic radio\nluminosities are highly uncertain due to confounding variables and a lack of\nknowledge about some aspects of the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).\nWe propose a new methodology to calculate the jet powers of the largest, most\npowerful radio sources based on combinations of their size, lobe luminosity and\nshape of their radio spectrum; this approach avoids the uncertainties\nencountered by previous relationships. The outputs of our model are calibrated\nusing hydrodynamical simulations and tested against independent X-ray\ninverse-Compton measurements. The jet powers and lobe magnetic field strengths\nof radio sources are found to be recovered using solely the lobe luminosity and\nspectral curvature, enabling the intrinsic properties of unresolved\nhigh-redshift sources to be inferred. By contrast, the radio source ages cannot\nbe estimated without knowledge of the lobe volumes. The monochromatic lobe\nluminosity alone is incapable of accurately estimating the jet power or source\nage without knowledge of the lobe magnetic field strength and size\nrespectively. We find that, on average, the lobes of the 3C radio sources have\nmagnetic field strengths approximately a factor three lower than the\nequipartition value, inconsistent with equal energy in the particles and the\nfields at the 5$\\sigma$ level. The particle content of 3C radio lobes is\ndiscussed in the context of complementary observations; we do not find evidence\nfavouring an energetically-dominant proton population.\n", "  There is evidence for coronal plasma flows to break down into fragments and\nto be laminar. We investigate this effect by modeling flows confined along\nmagnetic channels. We consider a full MHD model of a solar atmosphere box with\na dipole magnetic field. We compare the propagation of a cylindrical flow\nperfectly aligned to the field to that of another one with a slight\nmisalignment. We assume a flow speed of 200 km/s, and an ambient magnetic field\nof 30 G. We find that while the aligned flow maintains its cylindrical symmetry\nwhile it travels along the magnetic tube, the misaligned one is rapidly\nsquashed on one side, becoming laminar and eventually fragmented because of the\ninteraction and backreaction of the magnetic field. This model could explain an\nobservation of erupted fragments that fall back as thin and elongated strands\nand end up onto the solar surface in a hedge-like configuration, made by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The\ninitial alignment of plasma flow plays an important role in determining the\npossible laminar structure and fragmentation of flows while they travel along\nmagnetic channels.\n", "  In the core of the Fornax cluster, on the West side of NGC1399, we have\ndetected a previously unknown region of intra-cluster light (ICL). It is made\nup by several faint ($\\mu_r \\simeq 28 - 29$~mag/arcsec$^2$) {\\it patches} of\ndiffuse light. The bulk of the ICL is located in between the three bright\ngalaxies in the core, NGC1387, NGC1379 and NGC1381, at $10\\leq R \\leq40$~arcmin\n($\\sim 58 - 230$~kpc) from the central galaxy NGC~1399. We show that the ICL is\nthe counterpart in the diffuse light of the known over-density in the\npopulation of blue globular clusters (GCs). The total g-band luminosity of the\nICL is $L_g\\simeq 8.3 \\times 10^{9}$ $L_{\\odot}$, which is $\\sim5\\%$ of the\ntotal luminosity of NGC1399. This is consistent with the fraction of the blue\nGCs in the same region of the cluster. The ICL has $g-r \\sim 0.7$~mag, which is\nsimilar to the colors in the halo of the bright galaxies in the cluster core.\nThe new findings were compared with theoretical predictions for the ICL\nformation and they support a scenario in which the intra-cluster population\ndetected in the core of the Fornax cluster is build up by the tidal stripping\nof material (stars and GCs) from galaxy outskirts in a close passage with the\ncD. Moreover, the diffuse form of the ICL and its location close to the core of\nthe cluster is expected in a dynamically evolved cluster as Fornax.\n", "  In a recent paper (Leibowitz 2017) I have shown that the 39 large X-ray\nflares of Sgr A* that were recorded by Chandra observatory in the year 2012,\nare concentrated preferably around tick marks of an equi-distance grid on the\ntime axis. The period of this grid as found in L1 is 0.1033 days. In this work\nI show that the effect can be found among all the large X-ray flares recoded by\nChandra and XMM-Newton along 15 years. The midpoints of all the 71 large flares\nrecorded between the years 2000 and 2014 are also tightly grouped around tick\nmarks of a grid with this period, or more likely, 0.1032 day. This result is\nobtained with a confidence level of at least 3.27{\\sigma} and very likely of\n4.62{\\sigma}. I find also a possible hint that a similar grid is underlying IR\nflares of the object. I suggest that the pacemaker in the occurrences of the\nlarge X-ray flares of Sgr A* is a mass of the order of a low mass star or a\nsmall planet, in a slightly eccentric Keplerian orbit around the SMBH at the\ncentre of the Galaxy. The radius of this orbit is about 6.6 Schwarzschild radii\nof the BH.\n", "  The neutron excess at the time of explosion provides a powerful discriminant\namong models of Type Ia supernovae. Recent calculations of the carbon simmering\nphase in single degenerate progenitors have disagreed about the final neutron\nexcess. We find that the treatment of mixing in convection zones likely\ncontributes to the difference. We demonstrate that in MESA models, heating from\nexothermic weak reactions plays a significant role in raising the temperature\nof the WD. This emphasizes the important role that the convective Urca process\nplays during simmering. We briefly summarize the shortcomings of current models\nduring this phase. Ultimately, we do not pinpoint the difference between the\nresults reported in the literature, but show that the results are consistent\nwith different net energetics of the convective Urca process. This problem\nserves as an important motivation for the development of models of the\nconvective Urca process suitable for incorporation into stellar evolution\ncodes.\n", "  The ultrasoft X-ray flare 2XMMi J184725.1-631724 was serendipitously detected\nin two XMM-Newton observations in 2006 and 2007, with a peak luminosity of\n6X10^43 erg/s. It was suggested to be a tidal disruption event (TDE) because\nits position is consistent with the center of an inactive galaxy. It is the\nonly known X-ray TDE candidate whose X-ray spectra showed evidence of a weak\nsteep powerlaw component besides a dominant supersoft thermal disk. We have\ncarried out multiwavelength follow-up observations of the event. Multiple X-ray\nmonitorings show that the X-ray luminosity has decayed significantly after\n2011. Especially, in our deep Chandra observation in 2013, we detected a very\nfaint counterpart that supports the nuclear origin of 2XMMi J184725.1-631724\nbut had an X-ray flux a factor of ~1000 lower than in the peak of the event.\nCompared with follow-up UV observations, we found that there might be some\nenhanced UV emission associated with the TDE in the first XMM-Newton\nobservation. We also obtained a high-quality UV-optical spectrum with the SOAR\nand put a very tight constraint on the persistent nuclear activity, with a\npersistent X-ray luminosity expected to be lower than the peak of the flare by\na factor of >2700. Therefore, our multiwavelength follow-up observations\nstrongly support the TDE explanation of the event.\n", "  We characterize the influence that inclination has on the shape and\nnormalization in average dust attenuation curves derived from a sample of\n~10,000 local star-forming galaxies. To do this we utilize aperture-matched\nmulti-wavelength data from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and the Two Micron All-Sky\nSurvey. We separate our sample into groups according to axial ratio (b/a) and\nobtain an estimate of their average total-to-selective attenuation\n$k(\\lambda)$. The attenuation curves are found to be shallower at UV\nwavelengths with increasing inclination, whereas the shape at longer\nwavelengths remains unchanged. The highest inclination subpopulation (b/a<0.42)\nexhibits a NUV excess in its average selective attenuation, which, if\ninterpreted as a 2175\\AA\\ feature, is best fit with a bump strength of 17-26%\nof the MW value. No excess is apparent in the average attenuation curve of\nlower inclination galaxies. The differential reddening between the stellar\ncontinuum and ionized gas is found to decrease with increasing inclination. We\nfind that higher inclination galaxies have slightly higher values of $R_V$,\nalthough this is poorly constrained given the uncertainties. We outline\npossible explanations for these trends within a two component dust model (dense\ncloud+diffuse dust) and find that they can be naturally explained if carriers\nof the 2175\\AA\\ feature are preferentially destroyed in star-forming regions\n(UV-bright regions).\n", "  We present observations of a small-scale Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave that\nwas associated with a mini-filament eruption and a GOES B1.9 micro-fare in the\nquiet Sun region. The initiation of the event was due to the photospheric\nmagnetic emergence and cancellation in the eruption source region, which first\ncaused the ejection of a small plasma ejecta, then the ejecta impacted on a\nnearby mini-filament and thereby led to the filament's eruption and the\nassociated fare. During the filament eruption, an EUV wave at a speed of 182 {\n317 km/s was formed ahead of an expanding coronal loop, which propagated faster\nthan the expanding loop and showed obvious deceleration and refection during\nthe propagation. In addition, the EUV wave further resulted in the transverse\noscillation of a remote filament whose period and damping time are 15 and 60\nminutes, respectively. Based on the observational results, we propose that the\nsmall-scale EUV wave should be a fast-mode magnetosonic wave that was driven by\nthe the expanding coronal loop. Moreover, with the application of filament\nseismology, it is estimated that the radial magnetic field strength is about 7\nGauss. The observations also suggest that small-scale EUV waves associated with\nminiature solar eruptions share similar driving mechanism and observational\ncharacteristics with their large-scale counterparts.\n", "  Asteroseismic inference from pressure modes (p modes) and buoyancy, or\ngravity, modes (g modes) is ubiquitous for stars across the\nHertzsprung--Russell diagram. Until now, however, discussion of r modes (global\nRossby waves) has been rare. Here we derive the expected frequency ranges of r\nmodes in the observational frame by considering the visibility of these modes.\nWe find that the frequencies of r modes of azimuthal order $m$ appear as groups\nat slightly lower frequency than $m$ times the rotation frequency. Comparing\nthe visibility curves for r modes with Fourier amplitude spectra of Kepler\nlight curves of upper main-sequence B, A and F stars, we find that r modes are\npresent in many $\\gamma$ Dor stars (as first discovered by Van Reeth et al.\n2016), spotted stars, and so-called Heartbeat stars, which are highly eccentric\nbinary stars. We also find a signature of r modes in a frequently bursting Be\nstar observed by Kepler. In the amplitude spectra of moderately to rapidly\nrotating $\\gamma$ Dor stars, r-mode frequency groups appear at lower frequency\nthan prograde g-mode frequency groups, while in the amplitude spectra of\nspotted early A to B stars, groups of symmetric (with respect to the equator)\nr-mode frequencies appear just below the frequency of a structured peak that we\nsuggest represents an approximate stellar rotation rate. In many Heartbeat\nstars, a group of frequencies can be fitted with symmetric $m=1$ r modes, which\ncan be used to obtain rotation frequencies of these stars.\n", "  We present X-ray observations of PWN G16.73+0.08/SNR G16.7+0.1 using archival\ndata of {\\it Chandra} ACIS. The X-ray emission peak location of this pulsar\nwind nebula is found to be offset by 24 arcsec from the centre of the 1.4-GHz\nemission of this nebula. The X-ray nebula is elongated in the direction from\nthe X-ray peak to the 1.4-GHz emission centre. This offset suggests that\nG16.73+0.08 is an evolved pulsar wind nebula interacting with the supernova\nremnant reverse shock. We identify a point source, CXO J182058.16-142001.5,\nnear the location of the X-ray peak. The spectrum of the X-ray nebula can be\ndescribed by an absorbed power law of photon index $0.98^{+0.79}_{-0.71}$ and\nhydrogen column density $N_{\\rm H}=4.99^{+2.75}_{-2.28}\\times 10^{22}$\ncm$^{-2}$. CXO J182058.16-142001.5 is likely a pulsar. We estimate its\nspin-down power to be about $2.6\\times 10 ^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Assuming its age\nat 3000 and 10,000 years, its dipole magnetic field strength at the polar\nsurface is estimated to be about $4.2 \\times 10^{13}$ G and $1.3 \\times\n10^{13}$ G, respectively.\n", "  Peptide bonds (N-C=O) play a key role in metabolic processes since they link\namino acids into peptide chains or proteins. Recently, several molecules\ncontaining peptide-like bonds have been detected across multiple environments\nin the interstellar medium (ISM), growing the need to fully understand their\nchemistry and their role in forming larger pre-biotic molecules. We present a\ncomprehensive study of the chemistry of three molecules containing peptide-like\nbonds: HNCO, NH$_2$CHO, and CH$_3$NCO. We also included other CHNO isomers\n(HCNO, HOCN), and C$_2$H$_3$NO isomers (CH$_3$OCN, CH$_3$CNO) to the study. We\nhave used the \\uclchem gas-grain chemical code and included in our chemical\nnetwork all possible formation/destruction pathways of these peptide-like\nmolecules recently investigated either by theoretical calculations or in\nlaboratory experiments. Our predictions are compared to observations obtained\ntoward the proto-star IRAS16293$-$2422 and the L1544 pre-stellar core. Our\nresults show that some key reactions involving the CHNO and C$_2$H$_3$NO\nisomers need to be modified to match the observations. Consistently with recent\nlaboratory findings, hydrogenation is unlikely to produce NH$_2$CHO on grain\nsurfaces, while a combination of radical-radical surface reactions and\ngas-phase reactions is a better alternative. In addition, better results are\nobtained for NH$_2$CHO when a slightly higher activation energy of 25$\\,$K is\nconsidered for the gas-phase reaction $\\rm NH_2 + H_2CO \\rightarrow NH_2CHO +\nH$. Finally, our modelling shows that the observed correlation between\nNH$_2$CHO and HNCO in star-forming regions may come from the fact that HNCO and\nNH$_2$CHO react to temperature in the same manner rather than from a direct\nchemical link between the two species.\n", "  Dark matter haloes in which galaxies reside are likely to have a significant\nimpact on their evolution. We investigate the link between dark matter haloes\nand their constituent galaxies by measuring the angular two-point correlation\nfunction of radio sources, using recently released 3 GHz imaging over $\\sim 2 \\\n\\mathrm{deg}^2$ of the COSMOS field. We split the radio source population into\nStar Forming Galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), and further\nseparate the AGN into radiatively efficient and inefficient accreters.\nRestricting our analysis to $z<1$, we find SFGs have a bias, $b = 1.5\n^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, at a median redshift of $z=0.62$. On the other hand, AGN are\nsignificantly more strongly clustered with $b = 2.1\\pm 0.2$ at a median\nredshift of 0.7. This supports the idea that AGN are hosted by more massive\nhaloes than SFGs. We also find low-accretion rate AGN are more clustered ($b =\n2.9 \\pm 0.3$) than high-accretion rate AGN ($b = 1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.5}$) at the\nsame redshift ($z \\sim 0.7$), suggesting that low-accretion rate AGN reside in\nhigher mass haloes. This supports previous evidence that the relatively hot gas\nthat inhabits the most massive haloes is unable to be easily accreted by the\ncentral AGN, causing them to be inefficient. We also find evidence that\nlow-accretion rate AGN appear to reside in halo masses of $M_{h} \\sim 3-4\n\\times 10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ at all redshifts. On the other hand, the\nefficient accreters reside in haloes of $M_{h} \\sim 1-2 \\times\n10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ at low redshift but can reside in relatively lower\nmass haloes at higher redshifts. This could be due to the increased prevalence\nof cold gas in lower mass haloes at $z \\ge 1$ compared to $z<1$.\n", "  There is considerable observational evidence of implosion of magnetic loop\nsystems inside solar coronal active regions following high energy events like\nsolar flares. In this work, we propose that such collapse can be modeled in\nthree dimensions quite accurately within the framework of ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics. We furthermore argue that the dynamics of loop implosion\nis only sensitive to the transmitted disturbance of one or more of the system\nvariables, e.g. velocity generated at the event site. This indicates that to\nunderstand loop implosion, it is sensible to leave the event site out of the\nsimulated active region. Towards our goal, a velocity pulse is introduced to\nmodel the transmitted disturbance generated at the event site. Magnetic field\nlines inside our simulated active region are traced in real time, and it is\ndemonstrated that the subsequent dynamics of the simulated loops closely\nresemble observed imploding loops. Our work highlights the role of plasma\n$\\beta$ in regards to the rigidity of the loop systems and how that might\naffect the imploding loops' dynamics. Compressible magnetohydrodynamic modes\nsuch as kink and sausage are also shown to be generated during such processes,\nin accordance with observations.\n", "  Accurately predicting the demographics of dark matter (DM) substructure is of\nparamount importance for many fields of astrophysics, including gravitational\nlensing, galaxy evolution, halo occupation modeling, and constraining the\nnature of dark matter. Because of its strongly non-linear nature, DM\nsubstructure is typically modeled using N-body simulations, which reveal that\nlarge fractions of DM subhaloes undergo complete disruption. In this paper we\nuse both analytical estimates and idealized numerical simulations to\ninvestigate whether this disruption is mainly physical, due to tidal heating\nand stripping, or numerical (i.e., artificial). We show that, contrary to naive\nexpectation, subhaloes that experience a tidal shock $\\Delta E$ that exceeds\nthe subhalo's binding energy, $|E_{\\rm b}|$, do not undergo disruption, even\nwhen $\\Delta E/|E_{\\rm b}|$ is as large as 100. Along the same line, and\ncontrary to existing claims in the literature, instantaneously stripping matter\nfrom the outskirts of a DM subhalo also does not result in its complete\ndisruption, even when the instantaneous remnant has positive binding energy. In\naddition, we show that tidal heating due to high-speed (impulsive) encounters\nwith other subhaloes (`harassment'), is negligible compared to the tidal\neffects due to the host halo. Hence, we conclude that, in the absence of\nbaryonic processes, the complete, physical disruption of CDM substructure is\nextremely rare, and that most disruption in numerical simulations therefore\nmust be artificial. We discuss various processes that have been associated with\nnumerical overmerging, and conclude that inadequate force-softening is the most\nlikely culprit.\n", "  The evolution of the luminosity distance in a contracting universe is\nstudied. It is shown that for quite a lot of natural dynamical evolutions, its\nbehavior is far from trivial and its value can even decrease with an increasing\ntime interval between events. The consequences are investigated and it is\nunderlined that this could both put stringent consistency conditions on\nbouncing models and open a new observational window on \"pre Big Bang\" physics\nusing standard gravitational waves.\n", "  In the subset of luminous, early-type stars with strong, large-scale magnetic\nfields and moderate to rapid rotation, material from the star's radiatively\ndriven stellar wind outflow becomes trapped by closed magnetic loops, forming a\ncentrifugally supported, co-rotating magnetosphere. We present here a\nsemi-analytic analysis of how this quasi-steady accumulation of wind mass can\nbe balanced by losses associated with a combination of an outward,\ncentrifugally driven drift in the region beyond the Kepler co-rotation radius,\nand an inward/outward diffusion near this radius. We thereby derive scaling\nrelations for the equilibrium spatial distribution of mass, and the associated\nemission measure for observational diagnostics like Balmer line emission. We\ndiscuss the potential application of these relations for interpreting surveys\nof the emission line diagnostics for OB stars with centrifugally supported\nmagnetospheres. For a specific model of turbulent field-line-wandering rooted\nin surface motions associated with the iron opacity bump, we estimate values\nfor the associated diffusion and drift coefficients.\n", "  We present optical spectroscopy secured at the 10m Gran Telescopio Canarias\nof the counterparts of 20 extragalactic gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi\nsatellite. The observations allow us to investigate the nature of these sources\nand to determine their redshift. We find that all optical counterparts have a\nspectrum that is consistent with a BL Lac object nature. We are able to\ndetermine the redshift for 11 objects and set spectroscopic redshift limits for\nfive targets. Only for four sources the optical spectrum is found featureless.\nIn the latter cases we can set lower limits on the redshift based on the\nassumption that they are hosted by a typical massive elliptical galaxy whose\nspectrum is diluted by the non thermal continuum. The observations allow us to\nunveil the nature of these gamma-ray sources and provide a sanity check of a\ntool to discover the counterparts of gamma-ray emitters/blazars based on their\nmultiwavelength emission.\n", "  We report the first high-significance GeV gamma-ray detections of supernova\nremnants HESS J1731-347 and SN 1006, both of which have been previously\ndetected by imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes above 1 TeV. Using 8 years\nof Fermi Pass 8 data at energies between 1 GeV and 2 TeV, we detect emission at\nthe position of HESS J1731-347 with a significance of $\\sim 5\\sigma$ and a\nspectral index of $\\Gamma = 1.66 \\pm 0.16_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.12_{\\rm syst}$. The\nhardness of the index and the good connection with the TeV spectrum of HESS\nJ1731-347 support an association between the two sources. We also confirm the\ndetection of SN 1006 at $\\sim 6\\sigma$ with a spectral index of $\\Gamma = 1.79\n\\pm 0.17_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.27_{\\rm syst}$. The northeast (NE) and southwest (SW)\nlimbs of SN 1006 were also fit separately, resulting in the detection of the NE\nregion ($\\Gamma = 1.47 \\pm 0.26_{\\rm stat}$) and the non-detection of the SW\nregion. The significance of different spectral components for the two limbs is\n$3.6\\sigma$, providing first indications of an asymmetry in the GeV\n$\\gamma$-ray emission.\n", "  We performed a search for eclipsing and dipping sources in the archive of the\nEXTraS project - a systematic characterization of the temporal behaviour of\nXMM-Newton point sources. We discovered dips in the X-ray light curve of 3XMM\nJ004232.1+411314, which has been recently associated with the hard X-ray source\ndominating the emission of M31. A systematic analysis of XMM-Newton\nobservations revealed 13 dips in 40 observations (total exposure time $\\sim$0.8\nMs). Among them, four observations show two dips, separated by $\\sim$4.01 hr.\nDip depths and durations are variable. The dips occur only during\nlow-luminosity states (L$_{0.2-12}<1\\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$), while the\nsource reaches L$_{0.2-12}\\sim2.8\\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We propose this\nsystem to be a new dipping Low-Mass X-ray Binary in M31 seen at high\ninclination (60$^{\\circ}$-80$^{\\circ}$), the observed dipping periodicity is\nthe orbital period of the system. A blue HST source within the Chandra error\ncircle is the most likely optical counterpart of the accretion disk. The high\nluminosity of the system makes it the most luminous dipper known to date.\n", "  The galaxy pairwise velocity dispersion (PVD) can provide important tests of\nnon-standard gravity and galaxy formation models. We describe measurements of\nthe PVD of galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey as a function\nof projected separation and galaxy luminosity. Due to the faint magnitude limit\n($r < 19.8$) and highly-complete spectroscopic sampling of the GAMA survey, we\nare able to reliably measure the PVD to smaller scales ($r_\\bot = 0.01$ Mpc/h)\nthan previous work. The measured PVD at projected separations $r_\\bot <~ 1$\nMpc/h increases near-monotonically with increasing luminosity from $\\sigma\n\\approx 200$ km/s at $M_r = -17$ mag to $\\sigma \\approx 600$ km/s at $M_r\n\\approx -22$ mag. Analysis of the Gonzalez-Perez (2014) GALFORM semi-analytic\nmodel yields no such trend of PVD with luminosity: the model over-predicts the\nPVD for faint galaxies. This is most likely a result of the model placing too\nmany low-luminosity galaxies in massive halos.\n", "  The photodesorption of icy grain mantles has been claimed to be responsible\nfor the abundance of gas-phase molecules toward cold regions. Being water a\nubiquitous molecule, it is crucial to understand its role in photochemistry and\nits behavior under an ultraviolet field. We report new measurements on the\nUV-photodesorption of water ice and its H$_2$, OH, and O$_2$ photoproducts\nusing a calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Solid water was deposited\nunder ultra-high-vacuum conditions and then UV-irradiated at various\ntemperatures starting from 8 K with a microwave discharged hydrogen lamp.\nDeuterated water was used for confirmation of the results. We found a\nphotodesorption yield of 1.3 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ molecules per incident photon\nfor water, and 0.7 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ molecules per incident photon for\ndeuterated water at the lowest irradiation temperature, 8 K. The\nphotodesorption yield per absorbed photon is given and comparison with\nastrophysical scenarios, where water ice photodesorption could account for the\npresence of gas-phase water toward cold regions in the absence of a thermal\ndesorption process is addressed.\n", "  We explore the occurrence and detectability of planet-planet occultations\n(PPOs) in exoplanet systems. These are events during which a planet occults the\ndisk of another planet in the same system, imparting a small photometric signal\nas its thermal or reflected light is blocked. We focus on the planets in\nTRAPPIST-1, whose orbital planes we show are aligned to within 0.3 degrees at\n90% confidence. We present a photodynamical model for predicting and computing\nPPOs in TRAPPIST-1 and other systems for various assumptions of the planets'\natmospheric states. When marginalizing over the uncertainties on all orbital\nparameters, we find that the rate of PPOs in TRAPPIST-1 is about 1.4 per day.\nWe investigate the prospects for detection of these events with the James Webb\nSpace Telescope, finding that ~10-20 occultations per year of b and c should be\nabove the noise level at 12-15 microns. Joint modeling of several of these PPOs\ncould lead to a robust detection. Alternatively, observations with the proposed\nOrigins Space Telescope should be able to detect individual PPOs at high\nsignal-to-noise. We show how PPOs can be used to break transit timing variation\ndegeneracies, imposing strong constraints on the eccentricities and masses of\nthe planets, as well as to constrain the longitudes of nodes and thus the\ncomplete three-dimensional structure of the system. We further show how\nmodeling of these events can be used to reveal a planet's day/night temperature\ncontrast and construct crude surface maps. We make our photodynamical code\navailable on github.\n", "  We present analysis of the first Chandra observation of PSO J334.2028+01.4075\n(PSO J334), targeted as a binary-AGN candidate based on periodic variations of\nthe optical flux. With no prior targeted X-ray coverage for PSO J334, our new\n40 ksec Chandra observation allows for the opportunity to differentiate between\na single or binary-AGN system, and if a binary, can characterize the mode of\naccretion. Simulations show that the two expected accretion disk morphologies\nfor binary-AGN systems are (i) a \"cavity\", where the inner region of the\naccretion disk is mostly empty and emission is truncated blueward of the\nwavelength associated with the temperature of the innermost ring, or (ii)\n\"minidisks\", where there is substantial accretion from the cirumbinary disk\nonto one or both of the members of the binary, each with their own shock-heated\nthin-disk accretion system. We find the X-ray emission to be well-fit with an\nabsorbed power-law, incompatible with the simple cavity scenario. Further, we\nconstruct an SED of PSO J334 by combining radio through X-ray observations and\nfind that the SED agrees well with that of a normal AGN, most likely\nincompatible with the minidisk scenario. Other analyses, such as locating the\nquasar on IR color-color diagrams and analyzing the quasar mass predicted by\nthe fundamental plane of black hole activity, further highlight the similarity\nof PSO J334 with respect to normal AGN. On the multi-wavelength fronts we\ninvestigated, we find no evidence supporting PSO J334 as a binary-AGN system,\nthough our analysis remains insensitive to some binary configurations.\n", "  We present the first constraints on stellar mass-to-light ratio gradients in\nan early-type galaxy (ETG) using multiple dynamical tracer populations to model\nthe dark and luminous mass structure simultaneously. We combine the kinematics\nof the central starlight, two globular cluster populations and satellite\ngalaxies in a Jeans analysis to obtain new constraints on M87's mass structure,\nemploying a flexible mass model which allows for radial gradients in the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio. We find that, in the context of our model, a\nradially declining stellar-mass-to-light ratio is strongly favoured. Modelling\nthe stellar mass-to-light ratio as following a power law, $\\Upsilon_{\\star}\n\\sim R^{-\\mu}$, we infer a power-law slope $\\mu = -0.54 \\pm 0.05$; equally,\nparameterising the stellar-mass-to-light ratio via a central mismatch parameter\nrelative to a Salpeter IMF, $\\alpha$, and scale radius $R_M$, we find $\\alpha >\n1.48$ at $95\\%$ confidence and $R_M = 0.35 \\pm 0.04$ kpc. We use stellar\npopulation modelling of high-resolution 11-band HST photometry to show that\nsuch a steep gradient cannot be achieved by variations in only the metallicity,\nage, dust extinction and star formation history if the stellar initial mass\nfunction (IMF) remains spatially constant. On the other hand, the stellar\nmass-to-light ratio gradient that we find is consistent with an IMF whose inner\nslope changes such that it is Salpeter-like in the central $\\sim 0.5$ kpc and\nbecomes Chabrier-like within the stellar effective radius. This adds to recent\nevidence that the non-universality of the IMF in ETGs may be confined to their\ncore regions, and points towards a picture in which the stars in these central\nregions may have formed in fundamentally different physical conditions.\n", "  Upon entering a star system, light sails are subject to both gravitational\nforces and radiation pressure, and can use both in concert to modify their\ntrajectory. Moreover, stars possess significant magnetic fields, and if the\nsail is in any way charged, it will feel the Lorentz force also.\n  We investigate the dynamics of so-called \"photogravimagnetic assists\" of\nsailcraft around $\\alpha$ Centauri A, a potential first destination en route to\nProxima Centauri (the goal of the Breakthrough Starshot program). We find that\na 10m$^2$ sail with a charge-to-mass-ratio of around 10 $\\mu$C/g or higher will\nneed to take account of magnetic field effects during orbital maneouvres. The\nmagnetic field can provide an extra source of deceleration and deflection, and\nallow capture onto closer orbits around a target star.\n  However, flipping the sign of the sailcraft's charge can radically change\nresulting trajectories, resulting in complex loop-de-loops around magnetic\nfield lines and essentially random ejection from the star system. Even on\nwell-behaved trajectories, the field can generate off-axis deflections at\n$\\alpha$ Centauri that, while minor, can result in very poor targetting of the\nfinal destination (Proxima) post-assist.\n  Fortunately for Breakthrough Starshot, nanosails are less prone to charging\nen route than their heavier counterparts, but can still accrue relatively high\ncharge at both the origin and destination, when travelling at low speeds.\nPhotogravimagnetic assists are highly non-trivial, and require careful course\ncorrection to mitigate against unwanted changes in trajectory.\n", "  It has recently been recognized that the convective velocities achieved in\nthe current solar convection simulations might be over-estimated. The\nnewly-revealed effects of the prevailing small-scale magnetic field within the\nconvection zone may offer possible solutions to this problem. The small-scale\nmagnetic fields can reduce the convective amplitude of small-scale motions\nthrough the Lorentz-force feedback, which concurrently inhibits the turbulent\nmixing of entropy between upflows and downflows. As a result, the effective\nPrandtl number may exceed unity inside the solar convection zone. In this\npaper, we propose and numerically confirm a possible suppression mechanism of\nconvective velocity in the effectively high-Prandtl number regime. If the\neffective horizontal thermal diffusivity decreases (the Prandtl number\naccordingly increases), the subadiabatic layer which is formed near the base of\nthe convection zone by continuous depositions of low entropy transported by\nadiabatically downflowing plumes is enhanced and extended. The global\nconvective amplitude in the high-Prandtl thermal convection is thus reduced\nespecially in the lower part of the convection zone via the change in the mean\nentropy profile which becomes more subadiabatic near the base and less\nsuperadiabatic in the bulk.\n", "  In this paper, we study an anisotropic universe model with Bianchi-I metric\nusing Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) sample of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia).\nBecause light-curve parameters of SNe Ia vary with different cosmological\nmodels and SNe Ia samples, we fit the SNe Ia light-curve parameters and\ncosmological parameters simultaneously employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmethod. Therefore, the results on the amount of deviation from isotropy of the\ndark energy equation of state ($\\delta$), and the level of anisotropy of the\nlarge-scale geometry ($\\Sigma_0$) at present, are totally model-independent.\nThe constraints on the skewness and cosmic shear are $-0.101<\\delta<0.071$ and\n$-0.007<\\Sigma_0<0.008$. This result is consistent with a standard isotropic\nuniverse ($\\delta=\\Sigma_0=0$). However, a moderate level of anisotropy in the\ngeometry of the Universe and the equation of state of dark energy, is allowed.\nBesides, there is no obvious evidence for a preferred direction of anisotropic\naxis in this model.\n", "  On the basis of the SDSS survey and spectral observations with the 6-m\ntelescope of SAO RAS, we have peformed a detailed study of SDSS J170745+302056.\nBy combination of its characteristics -- exponential surface brightness\ndistribution, central surface brightness of stellar disk $\\mu_0(B) =\n23.25\\,^m/\\square\"$, blue colors, low metallicity and low star formation rate\n-- the galaxy is a typical low surface brightness spiral galaxy. Exponential\nscalelength of the galaxy is $\\approx$3 kpc, its optical diameter exceeds 20\nkpc. SDSS J170745+302056 is a member of a group of five galaxies and probably\nit is in interaction with UGC 10716. The existence of a large low surface\nbrightness galaxy in such a dense environment is very unusual.\n", "  At only 90 Mpc, ASASSN-14li is one of the nearest tidal disruption event\n(TDE) ever discovered, and because of this, it has been observed by several\nobservatories at many wavelengths. In this paper, we present new results on\narchival XMM-Newton observations, three of which were taken at early times\n(within 40 days of the discovery), and three of which were taken at late times,\nabout one year after the peak. We find that, at early times, in addition to the\n~1e5 K blackbody component that dominates the X-ray band, there is evidence for\na broad, P Cygni-like absorption feature at around 0.7 keV in all XMM-Newton\ninstruments (CCD detectors and grating spectrometers), and that this feature\ndisappears (or at least diminishes) in the late-time observations. We perform\nphotoionization modelling with XSTAR and interpret this absorption feature as\nblueshifted OVIII, from an ionized outflow with a velocity of 0.2c. As the TDE\ntransitions from high to low accretion rate, the outflow turns off, thus\nexplaining the absence of the absorption feature during the late-time\nobservations.\n", "  The recent discovery by Pan-STARRS1 of 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua), on an unbound\nand hyperbolic orbit, offers a rare opportunity to explore the planetary\nformation processes of other stars, and the effect of the interstellar\nenvironment on a planetesimal surface. 1I/`Oumuamua's close encounter with the\ninner Solar System in 2017 October was a unique chance to make observations\nmatching those used to characterize the small-body populations of our own Solar\nSystem. We present near-simultaneous g$^\\prime$, r$^\\prime$, and J photometry\nand colors of 1I/`Oumuamua from the 8.1-m Frederick C. Gillett Gemini North\nTelescope, and $gri$ photometry from the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope. Our\ng$^\\prime$r$^\\prime$J observations are directly comparable to those from the\nhigh-precision Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS),\nwhich offer unique diagnostic information for distinguishing between outer\nSolar System surfaces. The J-band data also provide the highest signal-to-noise\nmeasurements made of 1I/`Oumuamua in the near-infrared. Substantial, correlated\nnear-infrared and optical variability is present, with the same trend in both\nnear-infrared and optical. Our observations are consistent with 1I/`Oumuamua\nrotating with a double-peaked period of $8.10 \\pm 0.42$ hours and being a\nhighly elongated body with an axial ratio of at least 5.3:1, implying that it\nhas significant internal cohesion. The color of the first interstellar\nplanetesimal is at the neutral end of the range of Solar System $g-r$ and $r-J$\nsolar-reflectance colors: it is like that of some dynamically excited objects\nin the Kuiper belt and the less-red Jupiter Trojans.\n", "  Plasma accreted onto the surface of a neutron star can ignite due to unstable\nthermonuclear burning and produce a bright flash of X-ray emission called a\nType-I X-ray burst. Such events are very common; thousands have been observed\nto date from over a hundred accreting neutron stars. The intense, often\nEddington-limited, radiation generated in these thermonuclear explosions can\nhave a discernible effect on the surrounding accretion flow that consists of an\naccretion disk and a hot electron corona. Type-I X-ray bursts can therefore\nserve as direct, repeating probes of the internal dynamics of the accretion\nprocess. In this work we review and interpret the observational evidence for\nthe impact that Type-I X-ray bursts have on accretion disks and coronae. We\nalso provide an outlook of how to make further progress in this research field\nwith prospective experiments and analysis techniques, and by exploiting the\ntechnical capabilities of the new and concept X-ray missions ASTROSAT, NICER,\nHXMT, eXTP, and STROBE-X.\n", "  We present an implementation of an adaptive ray tracing (ART) module in the\nAthena hydrodynamics code that accurately and efficiently handles the radiative\ntransfer involving multiple point sources on a three-dimensional Cartesian\ngrid. We adopt a recently proposed parallel algorithm that uses non-blocking,\nasynchronous MPI communications to accelerate transport of rays across the\ncomputational domain. We validate our implementation through several standard\ntest problems including the propagation of radiation in vacuum and the\nexpansions of various types of HII regions. Additionally, scaling tests show\nthat the cost of a full ray trace per source remains comparable to that of the\nhydrodynamics update on up to $\\sim 10^3$ processors. To demonstrate\napplication of our ART implementation, we perform a simulation of star cluster\nformation in a marginally bound, turbulent cloud, finding that its star\nformation efficiency is $12\\%$ when both radiation pressure forces and\nphotoionization by UV radiation are treated. We directly compare the radiation\nforces computed from the ART scheme with that from the M1 closure relation.\nAlthough the ART and M1 schemes yield similar results on large scales, the\nlatter is unable to resolve the radiation field accurately near individual\npoint sources.\n", "  We use more than a decade of radial velocity measurements for $\\alpha$ Cen A,\nB, and Proxima Centauri from HARPS, CHIRON, and UVES to identify the $M \\sin i$\nand orbital periods of planets that could have been detected if they existed.\nAt each point in a mass-period grid, we sample a simulated, Keplerian signal\nwith the precision and cadence of existing data and assess the probability that\nthe signal could have been produced by noise alone. Existing data places\ndetection thresholds in the classically defined habitable zones at about $M\n\\sin i$ of 53 M$_{\\oplus}$ for $\\alpha$ Cen A, 8.4 M$_{\\oplus}$ for $\\alpha$\nCen B, and 0.47 M$_{\\oplus}$ for Proxima Centauri. Additionally, we examine the\nimpact of systematic errors, or \"red noise\" in the data. A comparison of white-\nand red-noise simulations highlights quasi-periodic variability in the radial\nvelocities that may be caused by systematic errors, photospheric velocity\nsignals, or planetary signals. For example, the red-noise simulations show a\npeak above white-noise simulations at the period of Proxima Centauri b. We also\ncarry out a spectroscopic analysis of the chemical composition of the $\\alpha$\nCentauri stars. The stars have super-solar metallicity with ratios of C/O and\nMg/Si that are similar to the Sun, suggesting that any small planets in the\n$\\alpha$ Cen system may be compositionally similar to our terrestrial planets.\nAlthough the small projected separation of $\\alpha$ Cen A and B currently\nhampers extreme-precision radial velocity measurements, the angular separation\nis now increasing. By 2019, $\\alpha$ Cen A and B will be ideal targets for\nrenewed Doppler planet surveys.\n", "  We present a study of comet C/2017 K2 (PANSTARRS) using prediscovery archival\ndata taken from 2013 to 2017. Our measurements show that the comet has been\nmarginally increasing in activity since at least 2013 May (heliocentric\ndistance of $r_{\\mathrm{H}} = 23.7$ AU pre-perihelion). We estimate the\nmass-loss rate during the period 2013--2017 as $\\overline{\\dot{M}} \\approx\n\\left(2.4 \\pm 1.1 \\right) \\times 10^{2}$ kg s$^{-1}$, which requires a minimum\nactive surface area of $\\sim$10--10$^2$ km$^{2}$ for sublimation of\nsupervolatiles such as CO and CO$_2$, by assuming a nominal cometary albedo\n$p_V = 0.04 \\pm 0.02$. The corresponding lower limit to the nucleus radius is a\nfew kilometers. Our Monte Carlo dust simulations show that dust grains in the\ncoma are $\\gtrsim0.5$ mm in radius, with ejection speeds from $\\sim$1--3 m\ns$^{-1}$, and have been emitted in a protracted manner since 2013, confirming\nestimates by Jewitt et al. (2017). The current heliocentric orbit is\nhyperbolic. Our N-body backward dynamical integration of the orbit suggests\nthat the comet is most likely (with a probability of $\\sim$98\\%) from the Oort\nspike. The calculated median reciprocal of the semimajor axis 1 Myr ago was\n$a_{\\mathrm{med}}^{-1} = \\left( 3.61 \\pm 1.71 \\right) \\times 10^{-5}$ AU$^{-1}$\n(in a reference system of the solar-system barycentre).\n", "  We study the stability of large amplitude, circularly polarized Alfv\\'en\nwaves in an anisotropic plasma described by the double-adiabatic/CGL closure,\nand in particular the effect of a background thermal pressure anisotropy on the\nwell-known properties of Alfv\\'en wave parametric decay in Magnetohydrodynamics\n(MHD). Anisotropy allows instability over a much wider range of values of\nparallel plasma beta ($\\beta_\\parallel$) when $\\xi=p_{0\\bot}/p_{0\\parallel} >\n1$. When the pressure anisotropy exceeds a critical value, $\\xi\\geq\\xi^*$ with\n$\\xi^*\\simeq2.7$, there is a new regime in which the parametric instability is\nno longer quenched at high $\\beta_\\parallel$ and in the limit\n$\\beta_\\parallel\\gg1$ the growth rate becomes independent of $\\beta_\\parallel$.\nIn the opposite case of $\\xi< \\xi^*$, the instability is strongly suppressed\nwith increasing parallel plasma beta, similarly to the MHD case. We analyze\nmarginal stability conditions for parametric decay in the\n$(\\xi,\\,\\beta_\\parallel)$ parameter space, and discuss possible implications\nfor Alfv\\'enic turbulence in the solar wind.\n", "  We present 151 planet candidates orbiting 141 stars from K2 campaigns 5-8\n(C5-C8), identified through a systematic search of K2 photometry. In addition,\nwe identify 16 targets as likely eclipsing binaries, based on their light curve\nmorphology. We obtained follow-up optical spectra of 105/141 candidate host\nstars and 8/16 eclipsing binaries to improve stellar properties and to identify\nspectroscopic binaries. Importantly, spectroscopy enables measurements of host\nstar radii with $\\approx$10% precision, compared to $\\approx$40% precision when\nonly broadband photometry is available. The improved stellar radii enable\nimproved planet radii. Our curated catalog of planet candidates provides a\nstarting point for future efforts to confirm and characterize K2 discoveries.\n", "  We investigate the star formation processes operating in a mid-infrared\nbubble N49 site, which harbors an O-type star in its interior, an ultracompact\nHII region, and a 6.7 GHz methanol maser at its edges. The 13CO line data\nreveal two velocity components (at velocity peaks ~88 and ~95 km/sec) in the\ndirection of the bubble. An elongated filamentary feature (length >15 pc) is\ninvestigated in each molecular cloud component, and the bubble is found at the\ninterface of these two filamentary molecular clouds. The Herschel temperature\nmap traces all these structures in a temperature range of ~16-24 K. In the\nvelocity space of 13CO, the two molecular clouds are separated by ~7 km/sec,\nand are interconnected by a lower intensity intermediate velocity emission\n(i.e. a broad bridge feature). A possible complementary molecular pair at [87,\n88] km/sec and [95, 96] km/sec is also observed in the velocity channel maps.\nThese observational signatures are in agreement with the outcomes of\nsimulations of the cloud-cloud collision process. There are also noticeable\nembedded protostars and Herschel clumps distributed toward the filamentary\nfeatures including the intersection zone of the two molecular clouds. In the\nbubble site, different early evolutionary stages of massive star formation are\nalso present. Together, these observational results suggest that in the bubble\nN49 site, the collision of the filamentary molecular clouds appears to be\noperated about 0.7 Myr ago, and may have triggered the formation of embedded\nprotostars and massive stars.\n", "  We perform a spatially resolved spectroscopic analysis of X-ray emission from\nthe supernova remnant (SNR) IC 443 with Suzaku. All the spectra are well\nreproduced by a model consisting of a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE)\nand two recombining plasma (RP) components. Although previous X-ray studies\nfound an RP in the northeastern region, this is the first report on RPs in the\nother parts of the remnant. The electron temperature $kT_e$ of the CIE\ncomponent is almost uniform at $\\sim 0.2$ keV across the remnant. The CIE\nplasma has metal abundances consistent with solar and is concentrated toward\nthe rim of the remnant, suggesting that it is of shocked interstellar medium\norigin. The two RP components have different $kT_e$: one in the range of\n0.16$-$0.28 keV and the other in the range of 0.48$-$0.67 keV. The electron\ntemperatures of both RP components decrease toward the southeast, where the SNR\nshock is known to be interacting with a molecular cloud. We also find the\nnormalization ratio of the lower-$kT_e$ RP to higher-$kT_e$ RP components\nincreases toward the southeast. Both results suggest the X-ray emitting plasma\nin the southeastern region is significantly cooled by some mechanism. One of\nthe plausible cooling mechanisms is thermal conduction between the hot plasma\nand the molecular cloud. If the cooling proceeds faster than the recombination\ntimescale of the plasma, the same mechanism can account for the recombining\nplasma as well.\n", "  We derive a positivity bound on the right-chiral tensor coupling Im $g_R$ in\npolarized top quark decay by analyzing the angular decay distribution of the\nthree-body polarized top quark decay $t(\\uparrow)\\to b+\\ell^+ +\\nu_\\ell$ in NLO\nQCD. We obtain the bound $-0.0420 \\le$ Im $g_R \\le 0.0420$.\n", "  We investigate the flux-tube joining two equal and opposite electric charges\nusing the dual Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity. The model is\nsupplemented with an additional scalar field carrying a non-Abelian global\nsymmetry, broken in the vortex cores. The presence of orientational moduli\nmakes the flux tube non-Abelian. We perform a detailed study of the low energy\ntheory of this soliton. We also analyze the solution representing\nsuperconducting droplets in the presence of the monopole anti - monopole pair.\n", "  Mrk\\,622 is a Compton Thick AGN and a double-peaked narrow emission line\ngalaxy, thus a dual AGN candidate. In this work, new optical long-slit\nspectroscopic observations clearly show that this object is rather a triple\npeaked narrow emission line galaxy, with both blue and red shifted narrow\nemission lines, as well as a much narrower emission line centred at the host\ngalaxy systemic velocity. The average velocity offset between the blue and red\nshifted components is $\\sim$500 km\\,s$^{-1}$, which is producing the apparent\ndouble-peaked emission lines. These two components are in the loci of AGN in\nthe Baldwin, Phillips \\& Terlevich (BPT) diagrams and are found to be spatially\nseparated by $\\sim$76 pc. Analysis of the optical spatially resolved\nspectroscopic observations presented in this work favours that Mrk\\,622 is a\nsystem consisting of a Composite AGN amidst a binary AGN candidate, likely the\nresult of a recent merger. This notwithstanding, outflows from a starburst, or\nsingle AGN could also explain the triple nature of the emission lines.\n", "  The Monoceros Ring (MRi) structure is an apparent stellar overdensity that\nhas been postulated to entirely encircle the Galactic plane and has been\nvariously described as being due to line-of-sight effects of the Galactic warp\nand flare or of extragalactic origin (via accretion). Despite being intensely\nscrutinised in the literature for more than a decade, no studies to-date have\nbeen able to definitively uncover its origins. Here we use $N$-body simulations\nand a genetic algorithm to explore the parameter space for the initial\nposition, orbital parameters and, for the first time, the final location of a\nsatellite progenitor. We fit our models to the latest Pan-STARRS data to\ndetermine whether an accretion scenario is capable of producing an in- Plane\nring-like structure matching the known parameters of the MRi. Our simulations\nproduce streams that closely match the location, proper motion and kinematics\nof the MRi structure. However, we are not able to reproduce the mass estimates\nfrom earlier studies based on Pan-STARRS data. Furthermore, in contrast with\nearlier studies our best-fit models are those for progenitors on retrograde\norbits. If the MRi was produced by satellite accretion, we find that its\nprogenitor has an initial mass upper limit of ~$10^{10}$M$_\\odot$ and the\nremnant is likely located behind the Galactic bulge, making it diffcult to\nlocate observationally. While our models produce realistic MRi-like structures\nwe cannot definitively conclude that the MRi was produced by the accretion of a\nsatellite galaxy.\n", "  As endpoints of the hierarchical mass-assembly process, the stellar\npopulations of local early-type galaxies encode the assembly history of\ngalaxies over cosmic time. We use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation, to study the merger histories of local early-type galaxies and\ntrack how the morphological mix of their progenitors evolves over time. We\nprovide a framework for alleviating `progenitor bias' -- the bias that occurs\nif one uses only early-type galaxies to study the progenitor population.\nEarly-types attain their final morphology at relatively early epochs -- by\n$z\\sim1$, around 60 per cent of today's early-types have had their last\nsignificant merger. At all redshifts, the majority of mergers have one\nlate-type progenitor, with late-late mergers dominating at $z>1.5$ and\nearly-early mergers becoming significant only at $z<0.5$. Progenitor bias is\nsevere at all but the lowest redshifts -- e.g. at $z\\sim0.6$, less than 50 per\ncent of the stellar mass in today's early-types is actually in progenitors with\nearly-type morphology, while, at $z\\sim2$, studying only early-types misses\nalmost all (80 per cent) of the stellar mass that eventually ends up in local\nearly-type systems. At high redshift, almost all massive late-type galaxies,\nregardless of their local environment or star-formation rate, are progenitors\nof local early-type galaxies, as are lower-mass (M$_\\star$ $<$ 10$^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) late-types as long as they reside in high density environments. In\nthis new era of large observational surveys (e.g. LSST, JWST), this study\nprovides a framework for studying how today's early-type galaxies have been\nbuilt up over cosmic time.\n", "  The high brightness temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{b}\\gtrsim 10^{13}$ K, detected\nin several active galactic nuclei by RadioAstron space VLBI observations\nchallenge theoretical limits. Refractive scattering by the interstellar medium\nmay affect such measurements. We quantify the scattering properties and the\nsub-mas scale source parameters for the quasar B0529+483. Using RadioAstron\ncorrelated flux density measurements at 1.7, 4.8, and 22 GHz on projected\nbaselines up to 240,000 km we find two characteristic angular scales in the\nquasar core, about 100 $\\mu$as and 10 $\\mu$as. Some indications of scattering\nsubstructure are found. Very high brightness temperatures, $T_\\mathrm{b}\\geq\n10^{13}$ K, are estimated at 4.8 GHz and 22 GHz even taking into account the\nrefractive scattering. Our findings suggest a clear dominance of the particle\nenergy density over the magnetic field energy density in the core of this\nquasar.\n", "  The age and evolutionary status of MWC349A, the unique emission line star\nwith maser and laser radiation in hydrogen recombination lines, remain unknown\nbecause the spectrum of the star is veiled by bright emission from the ionized\ndisk and wind. The major argument for this massive ($>$10 M_sun) star being\nevolved is its association with a close-by (2.4 arcsec) companion, MWC349B,\nwhose B0III spectrum implies an age of a few Myrs. However, newly obtained\nhigh-resolution spectra of MWC349B reveal a difference $\\approx$ 35 km/s in the\nradial velocities of the two stars, which makes their being gravitationally\nbound highly improbable. An estimate of the relative proper motion of the two\nstars seems to confirm this conclusion. This reopens the previously suggested\npossibility that MWC349A is a young massive star in a region of active star\nformation close to the Cyg OB2 association. MWC349B, which moves with a speed\n$\\geq$ 35 km/s relative to Cyg OB2, may be a runaway star from this\nassociation.\n", "  The Atacama Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Phasing Project (APP) has\ndeveloped and deployed the hardware and software necessary to coherently sum\nthe signals of individual ALMA antennas and record the aggregate sum in Very\nLong Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Data Exchange Format. These beamforming\ncapabilities allow the ALMA array to collectively function as the equivalent of\na single large aperture and participate in global VLBI arrays. The inclusion of\nphased ALMA in current VLBI networks operating at (sub)millimeter wavelengths\nprovides an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity, as well as\nenhancements in u-v coverage and north-south angular resolution. The\navailability of a phased ALMA enables a wide range of new ultra-high angular\nresolution science applications, including the resolution of supermassive black\nholes on event horizon scales and studies of the launch and collimation of\nastrophysical jets. It also provides a high-sensitivity aperture that may be\nused for investigations such as pulsar searches at high frequencies. This paper\nprovides an overview of the ALMA Phasing System design, implementation, and\nperformance characteristics.\n", "  We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations at 0.2\" (25 au) resolution of\nElias 2-24, one of the largest and brightest protoplanetary disks in the\nOphiuchus Molecular Cloud, and report the presence of three partially resolved\nconcentric gaps located at ~20, 52, and 87 au from the star. We perform\nradiative transfer modeling of the disk to constrain its surface density and\ntemperature radial profile and place the disk structure in the context of\nmechanisms capable of forming narrow gaps such as condensation fronts and\ndynamical clearing by actively forming planets. In particular, we estimate the\ndisk temperature at the locations of the gaps to be 23, 15, and 12 K (at 20,\n52, and 87 au respectively), very close to the expected snow-lines of CO (23-28\nK) and N2 (12-15 K). Similarly, by assuming that the widths of the gaps\ncorrespond to 4-8 x the Hill radii of forming planets (as suggested by\nnumerical simulations), we estimate planet masses in the range of 0.2-1.5\nM_Jup, 1.0-8.0 M_Jup, and 0.02-0.15 M_Jup for the inner, middle, and outer gap,\nrespectively. Given the surface density profile of the disk, the amount of\n\"missing mass\" at the location of each one of these gaps (between 4 and 20\nM_Jup) is more than sufficient to account for the formation of such planets.\n", "  A series of recent theoretical atomic diffusion studies has address the\nchallenging problem of predicting inhomogeneous vertical and horizontal\nchemical element distributions in the atmospheres of magnetic ApBp stars. Here\nwe critically assess the most sophisticated of such diffusion models - based on\na time-dependent treatment of the atomic diffusion in a magnetised stellar\natmosphere - by direct comparison with observations as well by testing the\nwidely used surface mapping tools with the spectral line profiles predicted by\nthis theory. We show that the mean abundances of Fe and Cr are grossly\nunderestimated by the time-dependent theoretical diffusion model, with\ndiscrepancies reaching a factor of 1000 for Cr. We also demonstrate that\nDoppler imaging inversion codes, based either on modelling of individual metal\nlines or line-averaged profiles simulated according to theoretical\nthree-dimensional abundance distribution, are able to reconstruct correct\nhorizontal chemical spot maps despite ignoring the vertical abundance\nvariation. These numerical experiments justify a direct comparison of the\nempirical two-dimensional Doppler maps with theoretical diffusion calculations.\nThis comparison is generally unfavourable for the current diffusion theory, as\nvery few chemical elements are observed to form overabundance rings in the\nhorizontal field regions as predicted by the theory and there are numerous\nexamples of element accumulations in the vicinity of radial field zones, which\ncannot be explained by diffusion calculations.\n", "  We present near infrared high-precision photometry for eight transiting hot\nJupiters observed during their predicted secondary eclipses. Our observations\nwere carried out using the staring mode of the WIRCam instrument on the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We present the observing strategies and\ndata reduction methods which delivered time series photometry with statistical\nphotometric precisionas low as 0.11%. We performed a Bayesian analysis to model\nthe eclipse parameters and systematics simultaneously. The measured\nplanet-to-star flux ratios allowed us to constrain the thermal emission from\nthe day side of these hot Jupiters, as we derived the planet brightness\ntemperatures. Our results combined with previously observed eclipses reveal an\nexcess in the brightness temperatures relative to the blackbody prediction for\nthe equilibrium temperatures of the planets for a wide range of heat\nredistribution factors. We find a trend that this excess appears to be larger\nfor planets with lower equilibrium temperatures. This may imply some additional\nsources of radiation, such as reflected light from the host star and/or thermal\nemission from residual internal heat from the formation of the planet.\n", "  We report modelling follow-up of recently-discovered gravitational-lens\ncandidates in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. Lens modelling\nwas done by a small group of specially-interested volunteers from the\nSpaceWarps citizen-science community who originally found the candidate lenses.\nModels are categorised according to seven diagnostics indicating (a) the image\nmorphology and how clear or indistinct it is, (b) whether the mass map and\nsynthetic lensed image appear to be plausible, and (c) how the lens-model mass\ncompares with the stellar mass and the abundance-matched halo mass. The lensing\nmasses range from ~10^11 Msun to >10^13 Msun. Preliminary estimates of the\nstellar masses show a smaller spread in stellar mass (except for two lenses): a\nfactor of a few below or above ~10^11 Msun. Therefore, we expect the\nstellar-to-total mass fraction to decline sharply as lensing mass increases.\nThe most massive system with a convincing model is J1434+522 (SW05). The two\nlow-mass outliers are J0206-095 (SW19) and J2217+015 (SW42); if these two are\nindeed lenses, they probe an interesting regime of very low star-formation\nefficiency. Some improvements to the modelling software (SpaghettiLens), and\ndiscussion of strategies regarding scaling to future surveys with more and\nfrequent discoveries, are included.\n", "  The detection of three black hole binary coalescence events by Advanced LIGO\nallows the science benefits of future detectors to be evaluated. In this paper\nwe report the science benefits of one or two 8km arm length detectors based on\nthe doubling of key parameters in an advanced LIGO type detector, combined with\nrealisable enhancements. It is shown that the total detection rate for sources\nsimilar to those already detected, would increase to $\\sim$ 10$^{3}$--10$^{5}$\nper year. Within 0.4Gpc we find that around 10 of these events would be\nlocalizable to within $\\sim 10^{-1}$ deg$^2$. This is sufficient to make unique\nassociations or to rule out a direct association with the brightest galaxies in\noptical surveys (at r-band magnitudes of 17 or above) or for deeper limits\n(down to r-band magnitudes of 20) yield statistically significant associations.\nThe combination of angular resolution and event rate would benefit precision\ntesting of formation models, cosmic evolution and cosmological studies.\n", "  We present VLA 9 mm (33 GHz) observations of the HD 141569 system from\nsemester 16A. The observations achieve a resolution of 0.25 arcsec ($\\sim28$\nau) and a sensitivity of $4.7~\\mu \\rm Jy~beam^{-1}$. We find (1) a $52\\pm\n5~\\mu$Jy point source at the location of HD 141569A that shows potential\nvariability, (2) the detected flux is contained within the SED-inferred central\nclearing of the disc meaning the spectral index of the dust disc is steeper\nthan previously inferred, and (3) the M dwarf companions are also detected and\nvariable. Previous lower-resolution VLA observations (semester 14A) found a\nhigher flux density, interpreted as solely dust emission. When combined with\nALMA observations, the VLA 14A observations suggested the spectral index and\ngrain size distribution of HD 141569's disc was shallow and an outlier among\ndebris systems. Using archival ALMA observations of HD 141569 at 0.87 mm and\n2.9 mm we find a dust spectral index of $\\alpha_{\\rm mm} = 1.81\\pm 0.20$. The\nVLA 16A flux corresponds to a brightness temperature of $\\sim5\\times10^{6}$ K,\nsuggesting strong non-disc emission is affecting the inferred grain properties.\nThe VLA 16A flux density of the M2V companion HD 141569B is $149\\pm9~\\mu$Jy,\ncorresponding to a brightness temperature of $\\sim2\\times10^{8}$ K and\nsuggesting significant stellar variability when compared to the VLA14A\nobservations, which are smaller by a factor of $\\sim6$.\n", "  We present an optical to X-ray spectral analysis of four 'hypervariable' AGN\n(HVAs) discovered by comparing Pan-STARRS data to that from SDSS over a 10 year\nbaseline (Lawrence et al 2016). There is some evidence that these objects are\nX-ray loud for their corresponding UV luminosities, but given that we measured\nthem in a historic high state, it is not clear whether to take the high-state\nor low-state as typical of the properties of these HVAs. We estimate black hole\nmasses based on MgII and H$\\alpha$ emission line profiles, and either the high\nand low state luminosities, finding mass ranges $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}) =\n8.2-8.8$ and $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}) = 7.9-8.3$ respectively. We then fit\nenergy conserving models to the SEDs, obtaining strong constraints on the\nbolometric luminosity and $\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$. We compare the SED properties with\na larger, X-ray selected AGN sample for both of these scenarios, and observe\ndistinct groupings in spectral shape versus luminosity parameter space. In\ngeneral, the SED properties are closer to normal if we assume that the\nlow-state is representative. This supports the idea that the large slow\noutbursts may be due to extrinsic effects (for example microlensing) as opposed\nto accretion rate changes, but a larger sample of HVAs is needed to be\nconfident of this conclusion.\n", "  We have compared the occurrence of 6.7-GHz and 12.2-GHz methanol masers with\n22-GHz water masers and 6035-MHz excited-state OH masers in the 100 square\ndegree region of the southern Galactic plane common to the Methanol Multibeam\n(MMB) and H2O southern Galactic Plane surveys (HOPS). We find the most populous\nstar formation species to be 6.7-GHz methanol, followed by water, then 12.2-GHz\nand, finally, excited-state OH masers. We present association statistics, flux\ndensity (and luminosity where appropriate) and velocity range distributions\nacross the largest, fully surveyed portion of the Galactic plane for four of\nthe most common types of masers found in the vicinity of star formation\nregions.\n  Comparison of the occurrence of the four maser types with far-infrared dust\ntemperatures shows that sources exhibiting excited-state OH maser emission are\nwarmer than sources showing any of the other three maser types. We further find\nthat sources exhibiting both 6.7-GHz and 12.2-GHz methanol masers are warmer\nthan sources exhibiting just 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission. These findings\nare consistent with previously made suggestions that both OH and 12.2-GHz\nmethanol masers generally trace a later stage of star formation compared to\nother common maser types.\n", "  We conducted multi-epoch VLBA phase reference observations of LS I +61 303 in\norder to study its precessing radio jet. Compared to similar observations in\n2006, we find that the observed elliptical trajectory of emission at 8.4 GHz\nrepeats after the 9-year gap. The accurate alignment of the emission patterns\nyields a precession period of 26.926 +- 0.005 d, which is consistent with that\ndetermined by Lomb-Scargle analysis of the radio light curve. We analytically\nmodel the projection on the sky plane of the peak position of a precessing,\nsynchrotron-emitting jet, which traces an elliptical trajectory on the sky.\nComparing the simulation with the VLBA astrometry we improve our knowledge of\nthe geometry of the system.We measure the LS I +61 303 absolute proper motion\nto be -0.150 +- 0.006 mas/yr eastward and -0.264 +- 0.006 mas/yr northward.\nRemoving Galactic rotation, this reveals a small, < 20 km/s, non-circular\nmotion, which indicates a very low kick velocity when the black hole was\nformed.\n", "  We have investigated temporal and spectral properties of a large sample of\nthermonuclear bursts with oscillations from eight different sources with spin\nfrequencies varying from 270 to 620 Hz. For our sample we chose those bursts,\nfor which the oscillation is sufficiently strong and of relatively long\nduration. The emission from the hot-spot that is formed during a thermonuclear\nburst is modulated by several physical processes and the burst oscillation\nprofiles unavoidably carry signatures of these. In order to probe these\nmechanisms, we examined the amplitude and phase lags of the burst oscillations\nwith energy. We also studied the frequency variation of oscillations during\nthese thermonuclear bursts. We observed that the frequency drifts are more\nfrequent in the cases where the spin frequency is lower. We found that the\nphase lag of the burst oscillations shows no systematic evolution with energy\nbetween the bursts, and also in between different sources. In 7 cases, we do\nindeed observe lag of soft energy photons, while there are a significant number\nof cases for which hard lag or no lag is observed.\n", "  Low radio frequencies are favourable for the identification of emission from\nnon-thermal processes such as synchrotron emission. The massive protostellar\njet associated with IRAS 18162-2048 (also known as the HH80-81 system) has been\nimaged at low radio frequencies: 325, 610 and 1300 MHz, using the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope, India. This is the first instance of detection of\nnon-thermal emission from a massive protostellar jet at such low radio\nfrequencies. The central region displays an elongated structure characteristic\nof the jet. In addition, the associated Herbig-Haro objects such as HH80, HH81,\nHH80N, and other condensations along the inner regions of the jet exhibit\nnegative spectral indices. The spectral indices of most condensations are\n~-0.7, higher than the value of -0.3 determined earlier using high frequency\nmeasurements. The magnetic field values derived using radio flux densities in\nthe present work, under the assumption of equipartition near minimum energy\ncondition, lie in the range 116-180 microgauss. We probe into the hard X-ray\nnature of a source that has been attributed to HH80, in an attempt to reconcile\nthe non-thermal characteristics of radio and X-ray measurements. The flux\ndensities of condensations at 610 MHz, measured nearly 11 yrs apart, display\nvariability that could be ascribed to the cooling of condensations, and\nemphasize the importance of coeval or nearly-coeval measurements for estimation\nof spectral indices.\n", "  Optical spectra of the 2006 outburst of RS Ophiuchi beginning one day after\ndiscovery to over a year after the outburst are presented here. The spectral\nevolution is found to be similar to that in previous outbursts. The early phase\nspectra are dominated by hydrogen and helium (I & II) lines. Coronal and\nnebular lines appear in the later phases. Emission line widths are found to\nnarrow with time, which is interpreted as a shock expanding into the red giant\nwind. Using the photoionisation code CLOUDY, spectra at nine epochs spanning 14\nmonths after the outburst peak, thus covering a broad range of ionisation and\nexcitation levels in the ejecta, are modelled. The best-fit model parameters\nindicate the presence of a hot white dwarf source with a roughly constant\nluminosity of 1.26 x 10^{37} erg/s. During first three months, the abundances\n(by number) of He, N, O, Ne, Ar, Fe, Ca, S and Ni are found above solar\nabundances; abundances of these elements decreased in the later phase. Also\npresented are spectra obtained during quiescence. Photoionisation model of the\nquiescence spectrum indicates the presence of a low luminosity accretion disk.\nThe helium abundance is found to be subsolar at quiescence.\n", "  Luminosity of X-ray spectral state transitions in black hole and neutron star\nX-ray binaries can put constraint on the critical mass accretion rate between\naccretion regimes. Previous studies indicate that the hard-to-soft spectral\nstate transitions in some ultracompact neutron star LMXBs have the lowest\nluminosity. With X-ray monitoring observations in the past decade, we were able\nto identify state transitions towards the lowest luminosity limit in 4U\n0614+091, 2S 0918-549 and 4U 1246-588. By analysing corresponding X-ray pointed\nobservations with the Swift/XRT and the RXTE/PCA, we found no hysteresis of\nstate transitions in these sources, and determined the critical mass accretion\nrate in the range of 0.002 - 0.04 $\\dot{\\rm M}_{\\rm Edd}$ and 0.003 - 0.05\n$\\dot{\\rm M}_{\\rm Edd}$ for the hard-to-soft and the soft-to-hard transition,\nrespectively, by assuming a neutron star mass of 1.4 solar masses. This range\nis comparable to the lowest transition luminosity measured in black hole X-ray\nbinaries, indicating the critical mass accretion rate is not affected by the\nnature of the surface of the compact stars. Our result does not support the\nAdvection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF) model which predicts that the\ncritical mass accretion rate in neutron star systems is an order of magnitude\nlower if same viscosity parameters are taken. The low transition luminosity and\ninsignificant hysteresis in these ultracompact X-ray binaries provide further\nevidence that the transition luminosity is likely related to the mass in the\ndisc.\n", "  Optical stochastic cooling (OSC) is expected to enable fast cooling of dense\nparticle beams. Transition from microwave to optical frequencies enables an\nachievement of stochastic cooling rates which are orders of magnitude higher\nthan ones achievable with the classical microwave based stochastic cooling\nsystems. A subsytem critical to the OSC scheme is the focusing optics used to\nimage radiation from the upstream \"pickup\" undulator to the downstream \"kicker\"\nundulator. In this paper, we present simulation results using wave-optics\ncalculation carried out with the {\\sc Synchrotron Radiation Workshop} (SRW).\nOur simulations are performed in support to a proof-of-principle experiment\nplanned at the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) at Fermilab. The\ncalculations provide an estimate of the energy kick received by a 100-MeV\nelectron as it propagates in the kicker undulator and interacts with the\nelectromagnetic pulse it radiated at an earlier time while traveling through\nthe pickup undulator.\n", "  We have carried out a statistical study of the average orientation of the\nmagnetic field in solar filaments with respect to their axes for more than 400\nsamples, based on data taken with daily full-Sun, full-Stokes\nspectropolarimetric observations using the He I 1083.0 nm line. The major part\nof the samples are the filaments in the quiet areas, but those in the active\nareas are included as well. The average orientation of the magnetic field in\nfilaments shows a systematic property depending on the hemisphere; the\ndirection of the magnetic field in filaments in the northern (southern)\nhemisphere mostly deviates clockwise (counterclockwise) from their axes, which\nrun along the magnetic polarity inversion line. The deviation angles of the\nmagnetic field from the axes, are concentrated between 10--30 deg. This\nhemispheric pattern is consistent with that revealed for chirality of filament\nbarbs, filament channels and for other solar features found to possess\nchirality. For some filaments it was confirmed that their magnetic field\ndirection is locally parallel to their structure seen in Halpha images. Our\nresults for the first time confirmed this hemispheric pattern with the direct\nobservation of the magnetic field in filaments. Interestingly, the filaments\nwhich show the opposite magnetic field deviation to the hemispheric pattern,\nare in many cases found above the polarity inversion line whose ambient\nphotospheric magnetic field has the polarity alignment being opposite to that\nof active regions following the Hale-Nicholson law.\n", "  Line coincidence photopumping is a process where the electrons of an atomic\nor molecular species are radiatively excited through the absorption of line\nemission from another species at a coincident wavelength. There are many\ninstances of line coincidence photopumping in astrophysical sources at optical\nand ultraviolet wavelengths, with the most famous example being Bowen\nfluorescence (pumping of O III 303.80 A by He II), but none to our knowledge in\nX-rays. However, here we report on a scheme where a He-like line of Ne IX at\n11.000 A is photopumped by He-like Na X at 11.003 A, which predicts significant\nintensity enhancement in the Ne IX 82.76 A transition under physical conditions\nfound in solar flare plasmas. A comparison of our theoretical models with\npublished X-ray observations of a solar flare obtained during a rocket flight\nprovides evidence for line enhancement, with the measured degree of enhancement\nbeing consistent with that expected from theory, a truly surprising result.\nObservations of this enhancement during flares on stars other than the Sun\nwould provide a powerful new diagnostic tool for determining the sizes of flare\nloops in these distant, spatially-unresolved, astronomical sources.\n", "  Coronal magnetic flux ropes are closely related to large-scale solar\nactivities. Using a 2.5-dimensional time-dependent ideal magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) model in Cartesian coordinates, we carry out numerical simulations to\ninvestigate the evolution of a magnetic system consisting of a flux rope\nembedded in a fully-closed quadrupolar magnetic field with different\nphotospheric flux distributions. It is found that, when the photospheric flux\nis not concentrated too much towards the polarity inversion line (PIL) and the\nconstraint exerted by the background field is not too weak, the equilibrium\nstates of the system are divided into two branches: the rope sticks to the\nphotosphere for the lower branch and levitates in the corona for the upper\nbranch. These two branches are connected by an upward catastrophe (from the\nlower branch to the upper) and a downward catastrophe (from the upper branch to\nthe lower). Our simulations reveal that there exist both upward and downward\ncatastrophes in quadrupolar fields, which may be either force-free or\nnon-force-free. The existence and the properties of these two catastrophes are\ninfluenced by the photospheric flux distribution, and a downward catastrophe is\nalways paired with an upward catastrophe. Comparing the decay indices in\ncatastrophic and non-catastrophic cases, we infer that torus unstable might be\na necessary but not sufficient condition for a catastrophic system.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the X-ray and molecular gas emission in the\nnearby galaxy NGC 34, to constrain the properties of molecular gas, and assess\nwhether, and to what extent, the radiation produced by the accretion onto the\ncentral black hole affects the CO line emission. We analyse the CO Spectral\nLine Energy Distribution (SLED) as resulting mainly from Herschel and ALMA\ndata, along with X-ray data from NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. The X-ray data analysis\nsuggests the presence of a heavily obscured AGN with an intrinsic luminosity of\nL$_{\\rm{1-100\\,keV}} \\simeq 4.0\\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. ALMA high\nresolution data ($\\theta \\simeq 0.2''$) allows us to scan the nuclear region\ndown to a spatial scale of $\\approx 100$ pc for the CO(6-5) transition. We\nmodel the observed SLED using Photo-Dissociation Region (PDR), X-ray-Dominated\nRegion (XDR), and shock models, finding that a combination of a PDR and an XDR\nprovides the best fit to the observations. The PDR component, characterized by\ngas density ${\\rm log}(n/{\\rm cm^{-3}})=2.5$ and temperature $T=30$ K,\nreproduces the low-J CO line luminosities. The XDR is instead characterised by\na denser and warmer gas (${\\rm log}(n/{\\rm cm^{-3}})=4.5$, $T =65$ K), and is\nnecessary to fit the high-J transitions. The addition of a third component to\naccount for the presence of shocks has been also tested but does not improve\nthe fit of the CO SLED. We conclude that the AGN contribution is significant in\nheating the molecular gas in NGC 34.\n", "  In the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of globular clusters, when the locus\nof stars on the horizontal branch (HB) extends to hot temperatures,\ndiscontinuities are observed at colors corresponding to ~12,000 K and ~18,000\nK. The former is the \"Grundahl jump\" that is associated with the onset of\nradiative levitation in the atmospheres of hot subdwarfs. The latter is the\n\"Momany jump\" that has remained unexplained. Using the Space Telescope Imaging\nSpectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have obtained ultraviolet and\nblue spectroscopy of six hot subdwarfs straddling the Momany jump in the\nmassive globular cluster omega Cen. By comparison to model atmospheres and\nsynthetic spectra, we find that the feature is due primarily to a decrease in\natmospheric Fe for stars hotter than the feature, amplified by the temperature\ndependence of the Fe absorption at these effective temperatures.\n", "  We used deep Gemini-South/GMOS g'r'i'z' images to study the globular cluster\n(GC) system of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1395, located in the Eridanus\nsupergroup. The photometric analysis of the GC candidates reveals a clear\ncolour bimodality distribution, indicating the presence of \"blue\" and \"red\" GC\nsubpopulations. While a negative radial colour gradient is detected in the\nprojected spatial distribution of the red GCs, the blue GCs display a shallow\ncolour gradient. The blue GCs also display a remarkable shallow and extended\nsurface density profile, suggesting a significant accretion of low-mass\nsatellites in the outer halo of the galaxy. In addition, the slope of the\nprojected spatial distribution of the blue GCs in the outer regions of the\ngalaxy, is similar to that of the X-ray halo emission. Integrating up to 165\nkpc the profile of the projected spatial distribution of the GCs, we estimated\na total GC population and specific frequency of 6000$\\pm$1100 and\n$S_N$=7.4$\\pm$1.4, respectively. Regarding NGC 1395 itself, the analysis of the\ndeep Gemini/GMOS images shows a low surface brightness umbrella-like structure\nindicating, at least, one recent merger event. Through relations recently\npublished in the literature, we obtained global parameters, such as\n$M_\\mathrm{stellar}=9.32\\times10^{11}$ M$\\odot$ and $M_h=6.46\\times10^{13}$\nM$\\odot$. Using public spectroscopic data, we derive stellar population\nparameters of the central region of the galaxy by the full spectral fitting\ntechnique. We have found that, this region, seems to be dominated for an old\nstellar population, in contrast to findings of young stellar populations from\nthe literature.\n", "  We study the internal structure of the Circum-Galactic Medium (CGM), using 29\nspectra of 13 gravitationally lensed quasars with image separation angles of a\nfew arcseconds, which correspond to 100 pc to 10 kpc in physical distances.\nAfter separating metal absorption lines detected in the spectra into high-ions\nwith ionization parameter (IP) $>$ 40 eV and low-ions with IP $<$ 20 eV, we\nfind that i) the fraction of absorption lines that are detected in only one of\nthe lensed images is larger for low-ions ($\\sim$16%) than high-ions ($\\sim$2%),\nii) the fractional difference of equivalent widths ($EW$s) between the lensed\nimages is almost same (${\\rm d}EW$ $\\sim$ 0.2) for both groups although the\nlow-ions have a slightly larger variation, and iii) weak low-ion absorbers tend\nto have larger ${\\rm d}EW$ compared to weak high-ion absorbers. We construct\nsimple models to reproduce these observed properties and investigate the\ndistribution of physical quantities such as size and location of absorbers,\nusing some free parameters. Our best models for absorbers with high-ions and\nlow-ions suggest that i) an overall size of the CGM is at least $\\sim$ 500 kpc,\nii) a size of spherical clumpy cloud is $\\sim$ 1 kpc or smaller, and iii) only\nhigh-ion absorbers can have diffusely distributed homogeneous component\nthroughout the CGM. We infer that a high ionization absorber distributes almost\nhomogeneously with a small-scale internal fluctuation, while a low ionization\nabsorber consists of a large number of small-scale clouds in the diffusely\ndistributed higher ionized region. This is the first result to investigate the\ninternal small-scale structure of the CGM, based on the large number of\ngravitationally lensed quasar spectra.\n", "  We investigate the relationship between 5 GHz interstellar scintillation\n(ISS) and 15 GHz intrinsic variability of compact, radio-selected AGNs drawn\nfrom the Microarcsecond Scintillation-Induced Variability (MASIV) Survey and\nthe Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) blazar monitoring program. We\ndiscover that the strongest scintillators at 5 GHz (modulation index, $m_5 \\geq\n0.02$) all exhibit strong 15 GHz intrinsic variability ($m_{15} \\geq 0.1$).\nThis relationship can be attributed mainly to the mutual dependence of\nintrinsic variability and ISS amplitudes on radio core compactness at $\\sim\n100\\, \\mu$as scales, and to a lesser extent, on their mutual dependences on\nsource flux density, arcsec-scale core dominance and redshift. However, not all\nsources displaying strong intrinsic variations show high amplitude\nscintillation, since ISS is also strongly dependent on Galactic line-of-sight\nscattering properties. This observed relationship between intrinsic variability\nand ISS highlights the importance of optimizing the observing frequency,\ncadence, timespan and sky coverage of future radio variability surveys, such\nthat these two effects can be better distinguished to study the underlying\nphysics. For the full MASIV sample, we find that Fermi-detected gamma-ray loud\nsources exhibit significantly higher 5 GHz ISS amplitudes than gamma-ray quiet\nsources. This relationship is weaker than the known correlation between\ngamma-ray loudness and the 15 GHz variability amplitudes, most likely due to\njet opacity effects.\n", "  The recently derived distributions for the scattering-matrix elements in\nquantum chaotic systems are not accessible in the majority of experiments,\nwhereas the cross sections are. We analytically compute distributions for the\noff-diagonal cross sections in the Heidelberg approach, which is ap- plicable\nto a wide range of quantum chaotic systems. We thus eventually fully solve a\nproblem which already arose more than half a century ago in compound-nucleus\nscattering. We compare our results with data from microwave and\ncompound-nucleus experiments, particularly addressing the transition from\nisolated resonances towards the Ericson regime of strongly overlapping ones.\n", "  Multi-band phase variations in principle allow us to infer the longitudinal\ntemperature distributions of planets as a function of height in their\natmospheres. For example, 3.6 micron emission originates from deeper layers of\nthe atmosphere than 4.5 micron due to greater water vapor absorption at the\nlonger wavelength. Since heat transport efficiency increases with pressure, we\nexpect thermal phase curves at 3.6 micron to exhibit smaller amplitudes and\ngreater phase offsets than at 4.5 micron; this trend is not observed. Of the\nseven hot Jupiters with full-orbit phase curves at 3.6 and 4.5 micron, all have\ngreater phase amplitude at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, while four of seven\nexhibit a greater phase offset at 3.6 micron. We use a 3D\nradiative-hydrodynamic model to calculate theoretical phase curves of HD\n189733b, assuming thermo-chemical equilibrium. The model exhibits temperature,\npressure, and wavelength dependent opacity, primarily driven by carbon\nchemistry: CO is energetically favored on the dayside, while CH4 is favored on\nthe cooler nightside. Infrared opacity therefore changes by orders of magnitude\nbetween day and night, producing dramatic vertical shifts in the\nwavelength-specific photospheres, which would complicate eclipse or phase\nmapping with spectral data. The model predicts greater relative phase amplitude\nand greater phase offset at 3.6 micron than at 4.5 micron, in agreement with\nthe data. Our model qualitatively explains the observed phase curves, but is in\ntension with current thermo-chemical kinetics models that predict zonally\nuniform atmospheric composition due to transport of CO from the hot regions of\nthe atmosphere.\n", "  In order to search for the evidence of quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in\nblazar, multicolor optical observations of the BL Lacertae object S5 0716+714\nwere performed from 2005 to 2012. For $I$ band on March 19 2010 with low\nvariability amplitude and low flux level, the same quasi-periodic oscillation\n$\\simeq50$ minutes with 99% significance levels is confirmed by ZDCF method,\nLomb-Scargle method, REDFIT and fitting sinusoidal curves. The observed QPO is\nlikely to be explained by accretion disk variability. If the observed QPO\nindicates an innermost stable orbital period from the accretion disk, the QPO\n$\\simeq50$ min corresponds to a black hole mass of $5.03\\times10^6 M_\\odot$ for\na non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole and $3.2\\times10^7 M_\\odot$ for a\nmaximally rotating Kerr black hole.\n", "  Low-mass stars build a significant fraction of their total mass during short\noutbursts of enhanced accretion known as FUor and EXor outbursts. FUor objects\nare characterized by a sudden brightening of ~5 magnitudes at visible\nwavelengths within one year and remain bright for decades. EXor objects have\nlower amplitude outbursts on shorter timescales. Here we discuss a 1.3 mm ALMA\nmini-survey of eight outbursting sources (three FUor, four EXor, and the\nborderline object V1647 Ori) in the Orion Molecular Cloud. While previous\npapers in this series discuss the remarkable molecular outflows observed in the\nthree FUor objects and V1647 Ori, here we focus on the continuum data and the\ndifferences and similarities between the FUor and EXor populations. We find\nthat FUor discs are significantly more massive (~80-600 M_JUP) than the EXor\nobjects (~0.5-40 M_JUP ). We also report that the EXor sources lack the\nprominent outflows seen in the FUor population. Even though our sample is\nsmall, the large differences in disc masses and outflow activity suggest that\nthe two types of objects represent different evolutionary stages. The FUor\nsources seem to be rather compact (Rc < 20-40 au) and to have a smaller\ncharacteristic radius for a given disc mass when compared to T Tauri stars.\nV1118 Ori, the only known close binary systemin our sample, is shown to host a\ndisc around each one of the stellar components. The disc around HBC 494 is\nasymmetric, hinting at a structure in the outer disc or the presence of a\nsecond disc.\n", "  We implemented various DFT+U schemes, including the ACBN0 self-consistent\ndensity-functional version of the DFT+U method [Phys. Rev. X 5, 011006 (2015)]\nwithin the massively parallel real-space time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TDDFT) code Octopus. We further extended the method to the case of the\ncalculation of response functions with real-time TDDFT+U and to the description\nof non-collinear spin systems. The implementation is tested by investigating\nthe ground-state and optical properties of various transition metal oxides,\nbulk topological insulators, and molecules. Our results are found to be in good\nagreement with previously published results for both the electronic band\nstructure and structural properties. The self consistent calculated values of U\nand J are also in good agreement with the values commonly used in the\nliterature. We found that the time-dependent extension of the self-consistent\nDFT+U method yields improved optical properties when compared to the empirical\nTDDFT+U scheme. This work thus opens a different theoretical framework to\naddress the non equilibrium properties of correlated systems.\n", "  We present a kinematic analysis of the dust-lane elliptical NGC 5626 based on\nMUSE observations. These data allow to robustly classify this galaxy as a fast\nrotator and to infer a virial mass of $10^{11.7} M_\\odot$, making it one of the\nmost massive fast rotators known. In addition, the depth and extent of the MUSE\ndata reveal a strong kinematic twist in the stellar velocity field (by up to\n$45$ degrees beyond $1.5R_e$). A comparison with the ATLAS$^\\mathrm{3D}$ sample\nunderlines the rareness of this system, although we show that such a\nlarge-scale kinematic twist could have been missed by the ATLAS$^\\mathrm{3D}$\ndata due to the limited spatial sampling of this survey (typically extending to\n$0.6R_e$ for massive ETGs). MUSE thus has the potential to unveil more examples\nof this type of galaxies. We discuss the environment and possible formation\nhistory of NGC 5626 and finally argue how a merger between the Milky Way and\nAndromeda could produce a galaxy of the same class as NGC 5626.\n", "  We present a measurement of the proper motion of the presumed pulsar in the\nevolved composite supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-56 whose pulsar wind nebula\n(PWN) has been disrupted by the supernova (SN) reverse shock. Using Chandra\nX-ray observations acquired over a baseline of 15 years, we measure a pulsar\nvelocity of 720 (+290/-215) km/s and a direction of motion of 14 +/- 22 degrees\nwest of south. We use this measurement to constrain a hydrodynamical model for\nthe evolution of this system and find that its morphology is well-described by\nan SNR expanding in an ambient density gradient that increases from east to\nwest. The effect of the density gradient and the pulsar's motion is an\nasymmetric interaction between the SN reverse shock and the PWN that displaces\nthe bulk of the PWN material away from the pulsar, towards the northeast. The\nsimulation is consistent with an SNR age of 11,000 years, an SN ejecta mass of\n10 solar masses, and an average surrounding density of 0.4 cm^-3. However, a\ncombination of a higher SN ejecta mass and ambient density can produce a\nsimilar SNR morphology at a later age.\n", "  We consider how dynamical friction acts on black holes that receive a\nvelocity kick while located at the center of a gravitational potential,\nanalogous to a star cluster, due to either a natal kick or the anisotropic\nemission of gravitational waves during a black hole-black hole merger. Our\ninvestigation specifically focuses on how well various Chandrasekhar-based\ndynamical friction models can predict the orbital decay of kicked black holes\nwith $m_{bh} \\lesssim 100 M_\\odot$ due to an inhomogeneous background stellar\nfield. In general, the orbital evolution of a kicked black hole follows that of\na damped oscillator where two-body encounters and dynamical friction serve as\nsources of damping. However, we find models for approximating the effects of\ndynamical friction do not accurately predict the amount of energy lost by the\nblack hole if the initial kick velocity $v_{k}$ is greater than the stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma$. For all kick velocities, we also find that\ntwo-body encounters with nearby stars can cause the energy evolution of a\nkicked BH to stray significantly from standard dynamical friction theory as\nencounters can sometimes lead to an energy gain. For larger kick velocities, we\nfind the orbital decay of a black hole departs from classical theory completely\nas the black hole's orbital amplitude decays linearly with time as opposed to\nexponentially. Therefore, we have developed a linear decay formalism which\nscales linearly with black hole mass and $\\frac{v_{k}}{\\sigma}$ in order to\naccount for the variations in the local gravitational potential.\n", "  While Chandrasekhar-mass ($M_{\\rm Ch}$) models with a low $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$\nyield can match the peak luminosities of fast-declining, 91bg-like Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNe Ia), they systematically fail to reproduce their faster\nlight-curve evolution. Here we illustrate the impact of a low ejecta mass on\nthe radiative display of low-luminosity SNe Ia, by comparing a sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$\nmodel resulting from the pure central detonation of a C-O White Dwarf (WD) to a\n$M_{\\rm Ch}$ delayed-detonation model with the same $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ yield of\n0.12 M$_{\\odot}$. Our sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ model from a 0.90 M$_{\\odot}$ WD\nprogenitor has a $\\sim$5 day shorter rise time in the integrated UV-optical-IR\n(uvoir) luminosity, as well as in the $B$-band, and a $\\sim$20 per cent higher\npeak uvoir luminosity ($\\sim$1 mag brighter peak $M_B$). This sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$\nmodel also displays bluer maximum-light colours due to the larger specific\nheating rate, and larger post-maximum uvoir and $B$-band decline rates. The\nluminosity decline at nebular times is also more pronounced, reflecting the\nenhanced escape of gamma rays resulting from the lower density of the\nprogenitor WD. The deficit of stable nickel in the innermost ejecta leads to a\nnotable absence of forbidden lines of [Ni II] in the nebular spectra. In\ncontrast, the $M_{\\rm Ch}$ model displays a strong line due to [Ni II] 1.939\n$\\mu\\rm{m}$, which could in principle serve to distinguish between different\nprogenitor scenarios. Our sub-$M_{\\rm Ch}$ model offers an unprecedented\nagreement with optical and near-infrared observations of the 91bg-like SN\n1999by, making a strong case for a WD progenitor significantly below the\nChandrasekhar-mass limit for this event and other low-luminosity SNe Ia.\n", "  We present our study on the spatially resolved H_alpha and M_star relation\nfor 536 star-forming and 424 quiescent galaxies taken from the MaNGA survey. We\nshow that the star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR), derived based on\nthe H_alpha emissions, is strongly correlated with the M_star surface density\n(Sigma_star) on kpc scales for star- forming galaxies and can be directly\nconnected to the global star-forming sequence. This suggests that the global\nmain sequence may be a consequence of a more fundamental relation on small\nscales. On the other hand, our result suggests that about 20% of quiescent\ngalaxies in our sample still have star formation activities in the outer region\nwith lower SSFR than typical star-forming galaxies. Meanwhile, we also find a\ntight correlation between Sigma_H_alpha and Sigma_star for LI(N)ER regions,\nnamed the resolved \"LI(N)ER\" sequence, in quiescent galaxies, which is\nconsistent with the scenario that LI(N)ER emissions are primarily powered by\nthe hot, evolved stars as suggested in the literature.\n", "  Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) can manifest itself by an energy-dependent\nvacuum dispersion of light, which leads to arrival-time differences of photons\nwith different energies originating from the same astronomical source. The\nspectral lags of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been widely used to investigate\nthe possible LIV effect. However, all current investigations used lags\nextracted in the observer frame only. In this work, we present, for the first\ntime, an analysis of the LIV effect and its redshift dependence in the\ncosmological rest frame. Using a sample of 56 GRBs with known redshifts, we\nobtain a robust limit on LIV by fitting their rest-frame spectral lag data both\nusing a maximization of the likelihood function and a minimum $\\chi^{2}$\nstatistic. Our analysis indicates that there is no evidence of LIV.\nAdditionally, we test the LIV in different redshift ranges by dividing the full\nsample into four redshift bins. We also find no evidence for the redshift\nvariation of the LIV effect.\n", "  We present a series of near-infrared spectra of Nova Ophiuchus 2017 in the\n$K$ band that record the evolution of the first overtone CO emission in\nunprecedented detail. Starting from 11.7d after maximum, when CO is first\ndetected at great strength, the spectra track the CO emission to +25.6d by\nwhich time it is found to have rapidly declined in strength by almost a factor\nof $\\sim$ 35. The cause for the rapid destruction of CO is examined in the\nframework of different mechanisms for CO destruction viz. an increase in\nphotoionizating flux, chemical pathways of destruction or destruction by\nenergetic non-thermal particles created in shocks. From LTE modelling of the CO\nemission, the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio is determined to be 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.3. This\nis consistent with the expected value of this parameter from nucleosynthesis\ntheory for a nova eruption occuring on a low mass ($\\sim$ 0.6 M$_\\odot$)\ncarbon-oxygen core white dwarf. The present $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C estimate\nconstitutes one of the most secure estimates of this ratio in a classical nova.\n", "  Double-lobed radio galaxies (DLRGs) often have radio lobes which subtend an\nangle of less than 180 degrees, and these bent DLRGs have been shown to\nassociate preferentially with galaxy clusters and groups. In this study, we\nutilize a catalog of DLRGs in SDSS quasars with radio lobes visible in VLA\nFIRST 20 cm radio data. We cross-match this catalog against three catalogs of\ngalaxies over the redshift range $0 < z < 0.70$, obtaining 81 tentative\nmatches. We visually examine each match and apply a number of selection\ncriteria, eventually obtaining a sample of 44 securely detected DLRGs which are\npaired to a nearby massive galaxy, galaxy group, or galaxy cluster. Most of the\nDLRGs identified in this manner are not central galaxies in the systems to\nwhich they are matched. Using this sample, we quantify the projected density of\nthese matches as a function of projected separation from the central galaxy,\nfinding a very steep decrease in matches as the impact parameter increases (for\n$\\Sigma \\propto b^{-m}$ we find $m = 2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$) out to $b \\sim 2$ Mpc.\nIn addition, we show that the fraction of DLRGs with bent lobes also decreases\nwith radius, so that if we exclude DLRGs associated with the central galaxy in\nthe system the bent fraction is 78\\% within 1 Mpc and 56\\% within 2 Mpc,\ncompared to just 29\\% in the field; these differences are significant at\n$3.6\\sigma$ and $2.8\\sigma$ respectively. This behavior is consistent with ram\npressure being the mechanism that causes the lobes to bend.\n", "  Interstellar Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules exist in diverse\nforms depending on the local physical environment. Formation of ionized PAHs\n(anions and cations) is favourable in the extreme conditions of the ISM.\nBesides in their pure form, PAHs are also likely to exist in substituted forms;\nfor example, PAHs with functional groups, dehydrogenated PAHs etc. A\ndehydrogenated PAH molecule might subsequently form fullerenes in the ISM as a\nresult of ongoing chemical processes. This work presents a Density Functional\nTheory (DFT) calculation on dehydrogenated PAH anions to explore the infrared\nemission spectra of these molecules and discuss any possible contribution\ntowards observed IR features in the ISM. The results suggest that\ndehydrogenated PAH anions might be significantly contributing to the 3.3 {\\mu}m\nregion. Spectroscopic features unique to dehydrogenated PAH anions are\nhighlighted that may be used for their possible identification in the ISM. A\ncomparison has also been made to see the size effect on spectra of these PAHs.\n", "  The interstellar extinction law in twenty open star clusters namely Berkeley\n7, Collinder 69, Hogg 10, NGC 2362, Czernik 43, NGC 6530, NGC 6871, Bochum 10,\nHaffner 18, IC 4996, NGC 2384, NGC 6193, NGC 6618, NGC 7160, Collinder 232,\nHaffner 19, NGC 2401, NGC 6231, NGC 6823 and NGC 7380 have been studied in the\noptical and near-IR wavelength ranges. The difference between maximum and\nminimum values of E(B-V) indicates the presence of non-uniform extinction in\nall the clusters except Collinder 69, NGC 2362 and NGC 2384. The colour excess\nratios are consistent with a normal extinction law for the clusters NGC 6823,\nHaffner 18, Haffner 19, NGC 7160, NGC 6193, NGC 2401, NGC 2384, NGC 6871, NGC\n7380, Berkeley 7, Collinder 69 and IC 4996. We found that differential\ncolour-excess which may be due to the occurrence of dust and gas inside the\nclusters, decreases with age of the clusters. A spatial variation of colour\nexcess is found in NGC 6193 in sense that it decreases from east to west in\ncluster region. For cluster Berkeley 7, NGC 7380 and NGC 6871, a dependence of\ncolour excess with spectral class and luminosity is observed. Eight stars in\nCollinder 232, four stars in NGC 6530 and one star in NGC 6231 have colour\nexcess flux in near-IR. This indicates that these stars may have circumstellar\nmaterial around them.\n", "  The recent Planck data on the power spectrum of temperature anisotropies of\nthe cosmic microwave background marginally support deviations from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model at several multipoles. With a view towards current and\nforthcoming observational surveys, we trace these features to other observables\nlike the scalar bispectrum and the tensor power spectrum. A possible detection\nof such bumps in these channels would increase their statistical significance\nshedding light on the ultra violet mechanisms responsible for their appearance\nin the data.\n", "  The majority of stars both host planetary systems and evolve into a white\ndwarf (WD). To understand their post-main-sequence (PMS) planetary system\nevolution, we present a search for transiting/eclipsing planets and other\nSubstellar Bodies (SBs) around WDs using a sample of 1148 WDs observed by K2.\nUsing transit injections, we estimate the completeness of our search. We place\nconstraints on the occurrence of planets and substellar bodies around white\ndwarfs as a function of planet radius and orbital period. For short-period ($P\n< 40$ days) small objects, from asteroid-sized to $1.5 \\ R_{\\oplus}$, these are\nthe strongest constraints known to date. We further constrain the occurrence of\nhot Jupiters ($< 1.5 \\%$), habitable zone Earth-sized planets ($< 28 \\%$), and\ndisintegrating short-period planets ($\\sim 12 \\%$). We blindly recovered all\npreviously known eclipsing objects, providing confidence in our analysis, and\nmake all light curves publicly available.\n", "  Ionic Coulomb blockade in nanopores is a phenomenon that shares some\nsimilarities but also differences with its electronic counterpart. Here, we\ninvestigate extensively this phenomenon using all-atom molecular dynamics of\nionic transport through nanopores of about one nanometer in diameter and up to\nseveral nanometers in length. Our goal is to better understand the role of\natomic roughness and structure of the pore walls in the ionic Coulomb blockade.\nOur numerical results reveal the following general trends. First, the nanopore\nselectivity changes with its diameter, and the nanopore position in the\nmembrane influences the current strength. Second, the ionic transport through\nthe nanopore takes place in a hopping-like fashion over a set of discretized\nstates caused by local electric fields due to membrane atoms. In some cases,\nthis creates a slow-varying \"crystal-like\" structure of ions inside the\nnanopore. Third, while at a given voltage, the resistance of the nanopore\ndepends on its length, the slope of this dependence appears to be independent\nof the molarity of ions. An effective kinetic model that captures the ionic\nCoulomb blockade behavior observed in MD simulations is formulated.\n", "  We report the discovery of coherent radio emission from the young,\nrapidly-rotating magnetic Bp star HD 133880 at a frequency of 610 MHz with the\nGiant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). This is only the second magnetic star\nin which coherent radio emission has been detected. In our observations of HD\n133880 covering the full rotational cycle of the star (except for a phase\nwindow 0.17-0.24), we witness an abrupt order-of-magnitude flux enhancement\nalong with $\\approx100$ percent right circular polarization. We attribute this\nphenomenon to coherent Electron Cyclotron MASER Emission. We attribute the lack\nof left circularly polarised emission to the asymmetric topology of the star's\nmagnetic field. The phase of enhancement, $0.73$, differs from the previously\nreported phase of enhancement, $0.16$, (at 610 MHz Chandra et al. 2015) by\none-half cycle. However, no flux enhancement is found at phase $0.16$ in our\ndata, which could be due to an unstable or drifting emission region, or a\nconsequence of the reported changes of the star's rotational period. Either of\nthese factors could have shifted the enhancement to the above-mentioned phase\nwindow not sampled by our observations.\n", "  We report the discovery of filamentary structures stretched behind the\nbow-shock-producing high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 using the SuperCOSMOS\nH-alpha Survey and present the results of optical spectroscopy of the bow shock\ncarried out with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). The geometry of\nthe detected structures suggests that Vela X-1 has encountered a wedge-like\nlayer of enhanced density on its way and that the shocked material of the layer\npartially outlines a wake downstream of Vela X-1. To substantiate this\nsuggestion, we carried out 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of interaction\nbetween Vela X-1 and the layer for three limiting cases. Namely, we run\nsimulations in which (i) the stellar wind and the interstellar medium (ISM)\nwere treated as pure hydrodynamic flows, (ii) a homogeneous magnetic field was\nadded to the ISM, while the stellar wind was assumed to be unmagnetized, and\n(iii) the stellar wind was assumed to possess a helical magnetic field, while\nthere was no magnetic field in the ISM. We found that although the first two\nsimulations can provide a rough agreement with the observations, only the third\none allowed us to reproduce not only the wake behind Vela X-1, but also the\ngeneral geometry of the bow shock ahead of it.\n", "  We report the discovery of an infrared (IR)-bright dust-obscured galaxy (DOG)\nthat shows a strong ionized-gas outflow but no significant molecular gas\noutflow. Based on detail analysis of their optical spectra, we found some\npeculiar IR-bright DOGs that show strong ionized-gas outflow\n([OIII]$\\lambda$5007) from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN). For one\nof these DOGs (WISE J102905.90+050132.4) at $z_{\\rm spec} = 0.493$, we\nperformed follow-up observations using ALMA to investigate their CO molecular\ngas properties. As a result, we successfully detected $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1) and\n$^{12}$CO($J$=4-3) lines, and the continuum of this DOG. The intensity-weighted\nvelocity map of both lines shows a gradient, and the line profile of those CO\nlines is well-fitted by a single narrow Gaussian, meaning that this DOG has no\nsign of strong molecular gas outflow. The IR luminosity of this object is\n$\\log\\,(L_{\\rm IR}/L_{\\odot})$ = 12.40 that is classified as ultraluminous IR\ngalaxy (ULIRG). We found that (i) the stellar mass and star-formation rate\nrelation and (ii) the CO luminosity and far-IR luminosity relation are\nconsistent with those of typical ULIRGs at similar redshifts. These results\nindicate that the molecular gas properties of this DOG are normal despite that\nits optical spectrum showing a powerful AGN outflow. We conclude that a\npowerful ionized-gas outflow caused by the AGN does not necessarily affect the\ncold interstellar medium in the host galaxy at least for this DOG.\n", "  Over the past 13 years, the Parkes radio telescope has observed a large\nnumber of pulsars using digital filterbank backends with high time and\nfrequency resolution and the capability for Stokes recording. Here we use\narchival data to present polarimetry data at an observing frequency of 1.4 GHz\nfor 600 pulsars with spin-periods ranging from 0.036 to 8.5 s. We comment\nbriefly on some of the statistical implications from the data and highlight the\ndifferences between pulsars with high and low spin-down energy. The dataset,\nimages and table of properties for all 600 pulsars are made available in a\npublic data archive maintained by the CSIRO.\n", "  WASP-39b is a hot Saturn-mass exoplanet with a predicted clear atmosphere\nbased on observations in the optical and infrared. Here we complete the\ntransmission spectrum of the atmosphere with observations in the near-infrared\n(NIR) over three water absorption features with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) G102 (0.8-1.1 microns) and G141 (1.1-1.7\nmicrons) spectroscopic grisms. We measure the predicted high amplitude H2O\nfeature centered at 1.4 microns, and the smaller amplitude features at 0.95 and\n1.2 microns, with a maximum water absorption amplitude of 2.4 planetary scale\nheights. We incorporate these new NIR measurements into previously published\nobservational measurements to complete the transmission spectrum from 0.3-5\nmicrons. From these observed water features, combined with features in the\noptical and IR, we retrieve a well constrained temperature Teq = 1030(+30,-20)\nK, and atmospheric metallicity 151 (+48,-46)x solar which is relatively high\nwith respect to the currently established mass-metallicity trends. This new\nmeasurement in the Saturn-mass range hints at further diversity in the planet\nformation process relative to our solar system giants.\n", "  We present new spectroscopic data for 21 barred spiral galaxies, which we use\nto explore the effect of bars on disk star formation, and to place constraints\non the characteristic lifetimes of bar episodes. The analysis centres on\nregions of heavily suppressed star formation activity, which we term 'star\nformation deserts'. Long-slit optical spectroscopy is used to determine H beta\nabsorption strengths in these desert regions, and comparisons with theoretical\nstellar population models are used to determine the time since the last\nsignificant star formation activity, and hence the ages of the bars. We find\ntypical ages of approx. 1 Gyr, but with a broad range, much larger than would\nbe expected from measurement errors alone, extending from about 0.25 Gyr to\nmore than 4 Gyr. Low-level residual star formation, or mixing of stars from\noutside the 'desert' regions, could result in a doubling of these age\nestimates. The relatively young ages of the underlying populations coupled with\nthe strong limits on the current star formation rule out a gradual exponential\ndecline in activity, and hence support our assumption of an abrupt truncation\nevent.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to better understand the structure of fission\nfragment distributions by investigating the competition between the static\nstructure of the collective manifold and stochastic dynamics. In particular, we\nstudy the characteristics of the tails of yield distributions, which correspond\nto very asymmetric fission. We use the stochastic Langevin framework to\nsimulate the nuclear evolution after the system tunnels through the\nmulti-dimensional potential barrier. For a representative sample of different\ninitial configurations along the outer turning-point line, we define effective\nfission paths by computing a large number of Langevin trajectories. We extract\nthe relative contribution of each such path to the fragment distribution. We\nthen use nucleon localization functions along effective fission pathways to\nanalyze the characteristics of prefragments at pre-scission configurations. We\nfind that non-Newtonian Langevin trajectories, strongly impacted by the random\nforce, produce the tails of the fission fragment distribution. The prefragments\ndeduced from nucleon localizations are formed early and change little as the\nnucleus evolves towards scission. On the other hand, the system contains many\nnucleons that are not localized in the prefragments, even near the scission\npoint. Such nucleons are rapidly distributed at scission to form the final\nfragments. Our study shows that only theoretical models of fission that account\nfor some form of dissipative/stochastic dynamics can give an accurate\ndescription of the structure of fragment distributions. In particular, it\nshould be nearly impossible to predict the tails of these distributions within\nthe standard formulation of time-dependent density functional theory. At the\nsame time, the large number of non-localized nucleons during fission suggests\nthat adiabatic approaches are ill-suited to describe fission fragment\nproperties.\n", "  Motivated by the recent observation of lepton universality violation in the\nflavour changing charged current transitions $b \\to c l \\bar{\\nu}_l$, we intend\nto scrutinize the lepton non-universality effects in rare semileptonic $B$\nmeson decays involving the quark level transitions $b \\to u l \\bar{\\nu}_l$. In\nthis regard, we envisage the model-independent approach and consider the\ngeneralized effective Lagrangian in the presence of new physics and constrain\nthe new parameters by using the experimental branching fractions of $B_u^+ \\to\nl^+ \\nu_l$ and $B^- \\to \\pi^0 \\mu^- \\bar \\nu_\\mu$ processes, where $l=e, \\mu,\n\\tau$. We then estimate the branching ratios and forward-backward asymmetries\nof $B_{(s)} \\to P (V)l \\bar{\\nu}_l$ processes, where $P(=K, \\pi,\n\\eta^{(\\prime)})$ denotes the pseudoscalar meson and $V(=K^*, \\rho)$ is the\nvector meson. We also find out various lepton non-universality parameters in\nthese processes in the presence of new physics.\n", "  The orbital parameters of binaries at intermediate periods ($10^2$--$10^3$ d)\nare difficult to measure with conventional methods and are very incomplete. We\nhave undertaken a new survey, applying our pulsation timing method to {\\it\nKepler} light curves of 2224 main-sequence A/F stars and found 341\nnon-eclipsing binaries. We calculate the orbital parameters for 317 PB1 systems\n(single-pulsator binaries) and 24 PB2s (double-pulsators). The method reaches\ndown to small mass ratios $q=0.02$ and yields a highly homogeneous sample. We\nparametrize the mass-ratio distribution using both inversion and MCMC\nforward-modelling techniques, and find it to be skewed towards low-mass\ncompanions, peaking at $q=0.2$. While solar-type primaries show a brown dwarf\ndesert across intermediate periods, we find a small but significant\n(2.6$\\sigma$) population of extreme-mass-ratio companions ($q<0.1$) to our\nintermediate-mass primaries. Across periods of 100--1500 d and at $q>0.1$, we\nmeasure the binary fraction of current A/F primaries to be 15.4%$\\pm$1.4%,\nthough we find that a large fraction of the companions (21%$\\pm$6%) are white\ndwarfs in post-mass-transfer systems with primaries that are now blue\nstragglers, some of which are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, barium\nstars, symbiotics, and related phenomena. Excluding these white dwarfs, we find\nthe binary fraction of original A/F primaries to be 13.9%$\\pm$2.1% over the\nsame parameter space. Combining literature measurements with ours, we find the\nbinary fraction across these periods is a constant 5% for primaries $M_1<0.8$\nM$_{\\odot}$, but then increases linearly with $\\log M_1$, demonstrating that\nnatal discs around more massive protostars $M_1>1$ M$_{\\odot}$ become\nincreasingly more prone to fragmentation. Finally, we find the eccentricity\ndistribution of the main-sequence pairs to be much less eccentric than the\nthermal distribution.\n", "  New frustrated antiferromagnetic compounds CuRE2Ge2O8 (RE=Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu)\nhave been investigated using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, magnetic and\nheat capacity measurements. These systems show different magnetic lattices\ndepending on rare-earth element. The nonmagnetic Eu compound is a S=1/2\ntwo-dimensional triangular antiferromagnetic lattice oriented in the ac plane\nwith geometrical frustration. On the other hand, the Pr, Nd, and Sm compounds\nshow a three-dimensional honeycomb-tunnel-like lattice made of RE^3+ running\nalong the a axis with the characteristic behavior of frustrated\nantiferromagnets.\n", "  A significant fraction of high-mass X-ray binaries are supergiant fast X-ray\ntransients (SFXTs). The prime model for the physics governing their X-ray\nbehaviour suggests that the winds of donor OB supergiants are magnetized. To\ninvestigate if magnetic fields are indeed present in the optical counterparts\nof such systems, we acquired low-resolution spectropolarimetric observations of\nthe two optically brightest SFXTs, IGR J08408-4503 and IGR J11215-5952 with the\nESO FORS2 instrument during two different observing runs. No field detection at\na significance level of 3sigma was achieved for IGR J08408-4503. For IGR\nJ11215-5952, we obtain 3.2sigma and 3.8sigma detections (<B_z>_hydr =\n-978+-308G and <B_z>_hydr = 416+-110G) on two different nights in 2016. These\nresults indicate that the model involving the interaction of a magnetized\nstellar wind with the neutron star magnetosphere can indeed be considered to\ncharacterize the behaviour of SFXTs. We detected long-term spectral variability\nin IGR J11215-5952, while for IGR J08408-4503 we find an indication of the\npresence of short-term variability on a time scale of minutes.\n", "  Centaurus A, with its gas-rich elliptical host galaxy, NGC 5128, is the\nnearest radio galaxy at a distance of 3.8 Mpc. Its proximity allows us to study\nthe interaction between an active galactic nucleus, radio jets, and molecular\ngas in great detail. We present ALMA observations of low J transitions of three\nCO isotopologues, HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, CN, and CCH toward the inner projected\n500 pc of NGC 5128. Our observations resolve physical sizes down to 40 pc. By\nobserving multiple chemical probes, we determine the physical and chemical\nconditions of the nuclear interstellar medium of NGC 5128. This region contains\nmolecular arms associated with the dust lanes and a circumnuclear disk (CND)\ninterior to the molecular arms. The CND is approximately 400 pc by 200 pc and\nappears to be chemically distinct from the molecular arms. It is dominated by\ndense gas tracers while the molecular arms are dominated by $^{12}$CO and its\nrare isotopologues. The CND has a higher temperature, elevated CN/HCN and\nHCN/HNC intensity ratios, and much weaker $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O emission than\nthe molecular arms. This suggests an influence from the AGN on the CND\nmolecular gas. There is also absorption against the AGN with a low velocity\ncomplex near the systemic velocity and a high velocity complex shifted by about\n60 km s$^{-1}$. We find similar chemical properties between the CND in emission\nand both the low and high velocity absorption complexes implying that both\nlikely originate from the CND. If the HV complex does originate in the CND,\nthen that gas would correspond to gas falling toward the supermassive black\nhole.\n", "  We have measured the scintillation properties of 151 young, energetic pulsars\nwith the Parkes radio telescope and have identified two extreme scattering\nevents (ESEs). Towards PSR J1057-5226 we discovered a three-year span of\nstrengthened scattering during which the variability in flux density and the\nscintillation bandwidth decreased markedly. The transverse size of the\nscattering region is ~23 au, and strong flux density enhancement before and\nafter the ESE may arise from refractive focusing. Long observations reveal\nscintillation arcs characteristic of interference between rays scattered at\nlarge angles, and the clearest arcs appear during the ESE. The arcs suggest\nscattering by a screen 100-200 pc from the earth, perhaps ionized filamentary\nstructure associated with the boundary of the local bubble(s).\n  Towards PSR J1740-3015 we observed a \"double dip\" in the measured flux\ndensity similar to ESEs observed towards compact extragalactic radio sources.\nThe observed shape is consistent with that produced by a many-au scale\ndiverging plasma lens with electron density ~500cm$^{-3}$ . The continuing ESE\nis at least 1500 d long, making it the longest detected event to date.\n  These detections, with materially different observational signatures,\nindicate that well-calibrated pulsar monitoring is a keen tool for ESE\ndetection and ISM diagnostics. They illustrate the strong r\\^ole au-scale\nnon-Kolmogorov density fluctuations and the local ISM structure play in such\nevents and are key to understanding both their intrinsic physics and their\nimpact on other phenomena, particularly fast radio bursts.\n", "  Lattice studies of QCD at temperatures above the chiral restoration and QCD\nwith truncated low modes of the Dirac operator indicate approximate and\nexplicit $SU(4)$ degeneracies in hadron spectra, respectively. At the same\ntime, the QCD classical action and the path integral measure are not invariant\nunder $SU(4)$. Here we investigate $SU(4)$ transformations in the continuum\nlimit by deriving corresponding Ward identities. We show that, if there is a\ngap in low-lying modes of the Dirac operator the obtained $SU(4)$ Ward\nidentities are simplified and look like they would be if $SU(4)$ symmetry is\npreserved. Then, we discuss possible consequences for the quark matter at high\ntemperatures.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of the displacements of a molecular motor\nembedded inside a glassy material on its folding characteristic time. We\nobserve two different time regimes. For slow foldings (regime I) the diffusion\nevolves very slowly with the folding time, while for rapid foldings (regime II)\nthe diffusion increases strongly with the folding time suggesting two different\nphysical mechanisms. We find that in regime I the motor displacement during the\nfolding process is counteracted by a reverse displacement during the unfolding,\nwhile in regime II this counteraction is much weaker. We notice that regime I\nbehavior is reminiscent of the scallop theorem that holds for larger motors in\na continuous medium. We find that the difference in the efficiency of the motor\nmotion explains most of the observed difference between the two regimes. For\nfast foldings the motor trajectories differ significantly from the opposite\ntrajectories induced by the following unfolding process, resulting in a more\nefficient global motion than for slow foldings. This result agrees with the\nfluctuation theorems expectation for time reversal mechanisms. In agreement\nwith the fluctuation theorems we find that the motors are unexpectedly more\nefficient when they are generating more entropy, a result that can be used to\nincrease dramatically the motor motion.\n", "  We present high spatial resolution (FWHM$\\sim$0.14'') observations of the\nCO($8-7$) line in GDS-14876, a compact star-forming galaxy at $z=2.3$ with\ntotal stellar mass of $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot})=10.9$. The spatially resolved\nvelocity map of the inner $r\\lesssim1$~kpc reveals a continous velocity\ngradient consistent with the kinematics of a rotating disk with $v_{\\rm\nrot}(r=1\\rm kpc)=163\\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$ and $v_{\\rm rot}/\\sigma\\sim2.5$. The\ngas-to-stellar ratios estimated from CO($8-7$) and the dust continuum emission\nspan a broad range, $f^{\\rm CO}_{\\rm gas}=M_{\\rm gas}/M_{\\star}=13-45\\%$ and\n$f^{\\rm cont}_{\\rm gas}=50-67\\%$, but are nonetheless consistent given the\nuncertainties in the conversion factors. The dynamical modeling yields a\ndynamical mass of$\\log(M_{\\rm dyn}/M_{\\odot})=10.58^{+0.5}_{-0.2}$ which is\nlower, but still consistent with the baryonic mass, $\\log$(M$_{\\rm bar}$=\nM$_{\\star}$ + M$^{\\rm CO}_{\\rm gas}$/M$_{\\odot}$)$=11.0$, if the smallest\nCO-based gas fraction is assumed. Despite a low, overall gas fraction, the\nsmall physical extent of the dense, star-forming gas probed by CO($8-7$),\n$\\sim3\\times$ smaller than the stellar size, implies a strong concentration\nthat increases the gas fraction up to $f^{\\rm CO, 1\\rm kpc}_{\\rm gas}\\sim 85\\%$\nin the central 1 kpc. Such a gas-rich center, coupled with a high\nstar-formation rate, SFR$\\sim$ 500 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, suggests that\nGDS-14876 is quickly assembling a dense stellar component (bulge) in a strong\nnuclear starburst. Assuming its gas reservoir is depleted without\nreplenishment, GDS-14876 will quickly ($t_{\\rm depl}\\sim27$ Myr) become a\ncompact quiescent galaxy that could retain some fraction of the observed\nrotational support.\n", "  Recent experimental work has revealed that the unusually strong, isotropic\nstructural negative thermal expansion in cubic perovskite ionic insulator ScF3\noccurs in excited states above a ground state tuned very near a structural\nquantum phase transition, posing a question of fundamental interest as to\nwhether this special circumstance is related to the anomalous behavior. To test\nthis hypothesis, we report an elastic and inelastic X-ray scattering study of a\nsecond system Hg2I2 also tuned near a structural quantum phase transition while\nretaining stoichiometric composition and high crystallinity. We find similar\nbehavior and significant negative thermal expansion below 100K for dimensions\nalong the body-centered-tetragonal c axis, bolstering the connection between\nnegative thermal expansion and zero temperature structural transitions. We\nidentify the common traits between these systems and propose a set of materials\ndesign principles that can guide discovery of new materials exhibiting negative\nthermal expansion.\n", "  A unified form of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking terms in phononic\ncrystals, leading to nontrivial phononic topology, has been proposed recently,\nbut is contradicted by some other works which introduce gyroscopic effect as\nTRS-breaking. We re-study gyroscopic phononic crystals using Newtonian\nmechanical method, and find the correct TRS-breaking term in consistent with\nthe unified form. Applying this term we calculate the basic topological\nphononics in a honeycomb lattice. Furthermore, we study nonlinear phonon-phonon\nscattering effect on topological phononic edge states by molecular dynamics\nsimulation. Generally edge states are not immune to such scattering effect, but\nunder specific conditions some edge states run into bulk much more slowly,\ndepending on the parameters of the model. This opens up the potential for\neffectively suppressing phonon dissipation by tuning the parameters, thereby\nrealizing near-100% efficiency of one-way phonon transport in phonon devices.\n", "  We present the largest submillimeter images that have been made of the\nextragalactic sky. The Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey\n(H-ATLAS) is a survey of 660 deg$^2$ with the PACS and SPIRE cameras in five\nphotometric bands: 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500{\\mu}m. In this paper we present\nthe images from our two largest fields which account for ~75% of the survey.\nThe first field is 180.1 deg$^2$ in size centered on the North Galactic Pole\n(NGP) and the second field is 317.6 deg$^2$ in size centered on the South\nGalactic Pole. The NGP field serendipitously contains the Coma cluster. Over\nmost (~80%) of the images, the pixel noise, including both instrumental noise\nand confusion noise, is approximately 3.6, and 3.5 mJy/pix at 100 and\n160{\\mu}m, and 11.0, 11.1 and 12.3 mJy/beam at 250, 350 and 500{\\mu}m,\nrespectively, but reaches lower values in some parts of the images. If a\nmatched filter is applied to optimize point-source detection, our total\n1{\\sigma} map sensitivity is 5.7, 6.0, and 7.3 mJy at 250, 350, and 500{\\mu}m,\nrespectively. We describe the results of an investigation of the noise\nproperties of the images. We make the most precise estimate of confusion in\nSPIRE maps to date finding values of 3.12+/-0.07, 4.13+/-0.02 and 4.45+/-0.04\nmJy/beam at 250, 350, and 500{\\mu}m in our un-convolved maps. For PACS we find\nan estimate of the confusion noise in our fast-parallel observations of 4.23\nand 4.62 mJy/beam at 100 and 160{\\mu}m. Finally, we give recipes for using\nthese images to carry out photometry, both for unresolved and extended sources.\n", "  Class I protostars are thought to represent an early stage in the lifetime of\nprotoplanetary disks, when they are still embedded in their natal envelope.\nHere we measure the disk masses of 10 Class I protostars in the Taurus\nMolecular Cloud to constrain the initial mass budget for forming planets in\ndisks. We use radiative transfer modeling to produce synthetic protostar\nobservations and fit the models to a multi-wavelength dataset using a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo fitting procedure. We fit these models simultaneously to our\nnew CARMA 1.3 mm observations that are sensitive to the wide range of spatial\nscales that are expected from protostellar disks and envelopes so as to be able\nto distinguish each component, as well as broadband spectral energy\ndistributions compiled from the literature. We find a median disk mass of 0.018\nM$_{\\odot}$ on average, more massive than the Taurus Class II disks, which have\nmedian disk mass of $\\sim$0.0025 M$_{\\odot}$. This decrease in disk mass can be\nexplained if dust grains have grown by a factor of 75 in grain size, indicating\nthat by the Class II stage, at a few Myr, a significant amount of dust grain\nprocessing has occurred. However, there is evidence that significant dust\nprocessing has occurred even during the Class I stage, so it is likely that the\ninitial mass budget is higher than the value quoted here.\n", "  Galaxies with stellar masses <10^7 Msun and specific star formation rates\nsSFR>10^{-7} yr^{-1} were examined on images of the Hubble Space Telescope\nFrontier Field Parallels for Abell 2744 and MACS J0416.1-02403. They appear as\nunresolved \"Little Blue Dots\" (LBDs). They are less massive and have higher\nsSFR than \"blueberries\" studied by yang et al. (2017) and higher sSFR than\n\"Blue Nuggets\" studied by Tacchella et al.(2016). We divided the LBDs into 3\nredshift bins and, for each, stacked the B435, V606, and I814 images convolved\nto the same stellar point spread function (PSF). Their radii were determined\nfrom PSF deconvolution to be ~80 to ~180 pc. The high sSFR suggest that their\nentire stellar mass has formed in only 1% of the local age of the universe. The\nsSFRs at similar epochs in local dwarf galaxies are lower by a factor of ~100.\nAssuming that the star formation rate is epsilon_ff M_gas/t_ff for efficiency\nepsilon_ff, gas mass M_gas, and free fall time, t_ff, the gas mass and\ngas-to-star mass ratio are determined. This ratio exceeds 1 for reasonable\nefficiencies, and is likely to be ~5 even with a high epsilon_ff of 0.1. We\nconsider whether these regions are forming today's globular clusters. With\ntheir observed stellar masses, the maximum likely cluster mass is ~10^5 M_sun,\nbut if star formation continues at the current rate for ~10t_ff~50 Myr before\nfeedback and gas exhaustion stop it, then the maximum cluster mass could become\n~10^6 M_sun.\n", "  We present the first detection of gas phase S2H in the Horsehead, a\nmoderately UV-irradiated nebula. This confirms the presence of doubly\nsulfuretted species in the interstellar medium and opens a new challenge for\nsulfur chemistry. The observed S2H abundance is ~5x10$^{-11}$, only a factor\n4-6 lower than that of the widespread H2S molecule. H2S and S2H are efficiently\nformed on the UV-irradiated icy grain mantles. We performed ice irradiation\nexperiments to determine the H2S and S2H photodesorption yields. The obtained\nvalues are ~1.2x10$^{-3}$ and <1x10$^{-5}$ molecules per incident photon for\nH2S and S2H, respectively. Our upper limit to the S2H photodesorption yield\nsuggests that photo-desorption is not a competitive mechanism to release the\nS2H molecules to the gas phase. Other desorption mechanisms such as chemical\ndesorption, cosmic-ray desorption and grain shattering can increase the gaseous\nS2H abundance to some extent. Alternatively, S2H can be formed via gas phase\nreactions involving gaseous H2S and the abundant ions S+ and SH+. The detection\nof S2H in this nebula could be therefore the result of the coexistence of an\nactive grain surface chemistry and gaseous photo-chemistry.\n", "  We report the detection of interstellar methoxymethanol (CH$_3$OCH$_2$OH) in\nALMA Bands 6 and 7 toward the MM1 core in the high-mass star-forming region NGC\n6334I at ~0.1\" - 1\" spatial resolution. A column density of 4(2) x $10^{18}$\ncm$^{-2}$ at $T_{ex}$ = 200 K is derived toward MM1, ~34 times less abundant\nthan methanol (CH$_3$OH), and significantly higher than predicted by\nastrochemical models. Probable formation and destruction pathways are\ndiscussed, primarily through the reaction of the CH$_3$OH photodissociation\nproducts, the methoxy (CH$_3$O) and hydroxymethyl (CH$_2$OH) radicals. Finally,\nwe comment on the implications of these mechanisms on gas-phase vs\ngrain-surface routes operative in the region, and the possibility of\nelectron-induced dissociation of CH$_3$OH rather than photodissociation.\n", "  Spectra of 38 candidate or known cataclysmic variables are presented. Most\nare candidate dwarf novae or systems containing possible highly magnetic white\ndwarfs, while a few (KR Aur, LS Peg, V380 Oph and V694 Mon) are previously\nknown objects caught in unusual states. Individual spectra are used to confirm\na dwarf nova nature or other classification while radial velocities of 15\nsystems provide orbital periods and velocity amplitudes that aid in determining\nthe nature of the objects. Our results substantiate a polar nature for four\nobjects, find an eclipsing SW Sex star below the period gap, another as a\nlikely intermediate polar, as well as two dwarf novae with periods in the\nmiddle of the gap.\n", "  AR~Scorpii is an intermediate polar system composed of a magnetic white dwarf\n(WD) and an M-type star, and shows non-thermal, pulsed, and highly linearly\npolarized emission. The radio/optical emission modulates with the WD's spin and\nshow the double peak structure in the light curves. In this paper, we discuss a\npossible scenario for the radiation mechanism of AR~Scorpii. The magnetic\ninteraction on the surface of the companion star produces an outflow from the\ncompanion star, the heating of the companion star surface, and the acceleration\nof electrons to a relativistic energy. The accelerated electrons, whose typical\nLorentz factor is $\\sim 50-100$, from the companion star move along the\nmagnetic field lines toward the WD surface. The electrons injected with the\npitch angle of $\\sin\\theta_{p,0}>0.05$ are subject to the magnetic mirror\neffect and are trapped in the closed magnetic field line region.We find that\nthe emission from the first magnetic mirror points mainly contributes to the\nobserved pulsed emission and the formation of the double-peak structure in the\nlight curve. For the inclined rotator, the pulse peak in the calculated light\ncurve shifts the position in the spin phase, and a Fourier analysis exhibits a\nbeat frequency feature, which are consistent with the optical/UV observations.\nThe pulse profile also evolves with the orbital phase owing to the effect of\nthe viewing geometry. The model also interprets the global features of the\nobserved spectral energy distribution in radio to X-ray energy bands. We also\ndiscuss the curvature radiation and the inverse-Compton scattering process in\nthe outer gap accelerator of the WD in AR Scorpii and discuss the possibility\nof the detection by future high-energy missions.\n", "  The superconducting pyrochlore oxide Cd2Re2O7 is revisited with a particular\nemphasis on the sample-quality issue. The compound has drawn attention as the\nonly superconductor (Tc = 1.0 K) that has been found in the family of\n{\\alpha}-pyrochlore oxides since its discovery in 2001. Moreover, it exhibits\ntwo characteristic structural transitions from the cubic pyrochlore structure,\nwith the inversion symmetry broken at the first one at 200 K. Recently, it has\nattracted increasing attention as a candidate spin-orbit coupled metal (SOCM),\nin which specific Fermi liquid instability is expected to lead to an odd-parity\norder with spontaneous inversion-symmetry breaking [L. Fu, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n115, 026401 (2015)] and parity-mixing superconductivity [V. Kozii and L. Fu:\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 115 (2015) 207002; Y. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. B 93 (2016)\n134512]. We review our previous experimental results in comparison with those\nof other groups in the light of the theoretical prediction of the SOCM, which\nwe consider meaningful and helpful for future progress in understanding this\nunique compound.\n", "  We present late-time observations by Swift and XMM-Newton of the tidal\ndisruption event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi that reveal that the source brightened in\nthe X-rays by a factor of $\\sim10$ one year after its discovery, while it faded\nin the UV/optical by a factor of $\\sim 100$. The XMM-Newton observations\nmeasure a soft X-ray blackbody component with $kT_{\\rm bb} \\sim 45$ eV,\ncorresponding to radiation from several gravitational radii of a central $\\sim\n10^6 M_\\odot$ black hole. The last Swift epoch taken almost 600 days after\ndiscovery shows that the X-ray source has faded back to its levels during the\nUV/optical peak. The timescale of the X-ray brightening suggests that the X-ray\nemission could be coming from delayed accretion through a newly forming debris\ndisk, and that the prompt UV/optical emission is from the prior circularization\nof the disk through stream-stream collisions. The lack of spectral evolution\nduring the X-ray brightening disfavors ionization breakout of a TDE \"veiled\" by\nobscuring material. This is the first time a TDE has been shown to have a\ndelayed peak in soft X-rays relative to the UV/optical peak, which may be the\nfirst clear signature of the real-time assembly of a nascent accretion disk,\nand provides strong evidence for the origin of the UV/optical emission from\ncircularization, as opposed to reprocessed emission of accretion radiation.\n", "  We present the results of photometric observations of six Transneptunian\nobjects and three Centaurs, estimations of their rotational periods and\ncorresponding amplitudes. For six of them we present also lower limits of\ndensity values. All observations were made using 3.6-m TNG telescope (La Palma,\nSpain). For four objects -- (148975) 2001 XA255, (281371) 2008 FC76, (315898)\n2008 QD4, and 2008 CT190 -- the estimation of short-term variability was made\nfor the first time. We confirm rotation period values for two objects: (55636)\n2002 TX300 and (202421) 2005 UQ513, and improve the precision of previously\nreported rotational period values for other three -- (120178) 2003 OP32,\n(145452) 2005 RN43, (444030) 2004 NT33 -- by using both our and literature\ndata. We also discuss here that small distant bodies, similarly to asteroids in\nthe Main belt, tend to have double-peaked rotational periods caused by the\nelongated shape rather than surface albedo variations.\n", "  When quantized, traces of classically chaotic single particle systems include\neigenvalue statistics and scars in eigenfuntions. Since 2001, many theoretical\nand experimental works have argued that classically chaotic single electron\ndynamics influences and controls collective electron transport. For transport\nin semiconductor superlattices under tilted magnetic and electric fields, these\ntheories rely on a reduction to a one-dimensional self-consistent drift model.\nA two-dimensional theory based on self-consistent Boltzmann transport does not\nsupport that single electron chaos influences collective transport. This theory\nagrees with existing experimental evidence of current self-oscillations,\npredicts spontaneous collective chaos via a period doubling scenario and it\ncould be tested unambiguously by measuring the electric potential inside the\nsuperlattice under a tilted magnetic field.\n", "  The rare decays $B_{(s,d)}^*\\to l^+ l^-$ are important to probe the flavour\nsector of the standard model and to search new physics beyond the SM. Unlike\npseudoscalar B meson, the leptonic decays of vector $ B_(s,d)^*$ mesons are not\nchirally supressed which compensates for their short lifetimes, and results\nsignificant branching ratios. In this paper, we estimate the branching ratios\nof $B_{(s,d)}^*\\to l^+ l^-$ $(l=e,\\mu)$ rare decays in Z' model which is an\nextension of the SM with an extra U(1)' gauge symmetry. We find that the\nbranching ratios are increased from their corresponding standard model values\nand vary with the mass of $Z'$ boson. Lower is the mass of $Z'$ boson, higher\nis the branching ratio.\n", "  The destabilizing role of neutrino beams on the Trivelpiece-Gould modes is\nconsidered, assuming electrostatic perturbations in a magnetized plasma\ncomposed by electrons in a neutralizing ionic background, coupled to a neutrino\nspecies by means of an effective neutrino force arising from the electro-weak\ninteraction. The magnetic field is found to significantly improve the linear\ninstability growth rate, as calculated for Supernova type II environments. On\nthe formal level, for wave vector parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield the instability growth rate is found from the unmagnetized case replacing\nthe plasma frequency by the appropriated Trivelpiece-Gould frequency. The\ngrowth rate associated with oblique propagation is also obtained.\n", "  A new transverse mode in a two-stream magnetized quantum plasma is studied by\nmeans of a quantum hydrodynamic model, under non-relativistic and ideal Fermi\ngas assumptions. It is found that Fermi pressure effects induce a minimum\ncutoff wavelength for instability, unlike the classical case which is unstable\nfor larger wavenumbers. The external magnetic field is also shown to produce a\nstabilizing effect. Conditions for the applicability of the model and specific\nparameters for experimental observations are thoroughly discussed.\n", "  We consider the system of massive electrons, possessing nonzero anomalous\nmagnetic moments, which electroweakly interact with background neutrons under\nthe influence of an external magnetic field. The Dirac equation for such\nelectrons is exactly solved. Basing on the obtained solution, we find that a\nnonzero electric current of these electrons can flow along the magnetic field.\nAccounting for the new current in the Maxwell equations, we demonstrate that a\nmagnetic field in this system appears to be unstable. Then we consider a\nparticular case of a degenerate electron gas, which may well exist in a neutron\nstar, and show that a seed magnetic field can be amplified by more than one\norder of magnitude. Finally we discuss the application of our results for the\nexplanation of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by magnetars.\n", "  The equations of Hamiltonian gravity are often considered ugly cousins of the\nelegant and manifestly covariant versions found in the Lagrangian theory.\nHowever, both formulations are fundamental in their own rights because they\nmake different statements about the nature of space-time and its symmetries.\nThese implications, along with the history of their derivation and an\nintroduction of recent mathematical support, are discussed here.\n", "  Probabilistic Spacetime is a simple generalization of the classical model of\nspacetime in General Relativity, such that it allows to consider multiple\nmetric field realizations endowed with probabilities. The motivation for such a\ngeneralization is a possible application in the context of some quantum gravity\napproaches, particularly those using the path integral. It is argued that this\nmodel might be used to describe simplified geometry, resulting e.g. from\ndiscretization, while keeping the continuous manifold; or it may be used as an\neffective description of a probabilistic geometry resulting from a full-fledged\nquantum gravity computation.\n", "  In this work we present ALMA continuum observations at 880 $\\mu$m of 30\nsub-mm cores previously identified with APEX/LABOCA at 870$\\mu$m in the Barnard\n30 cloud. The main goal is to characterize the youngest and lowest mass\npopulation in the cloud. As a result, we report the detection of five (out of\n30) spatially unresolved sources with ALMA, with estimated masses between 0.9\nand 67 M$_{\\rm Jup}$. From these five sources, only two show gas emission. The\nanalysis of multi-wavelength photometry from these two objects, namely B30-LB14\nand B30-LB19, is consistent with one Class II- and one Class I low-mass stellar\nobject, respectively. The gas emission is consistent with a rotating disk in\nthe case of B30-LB14, and with an oblate rotating envelope with infall\nsignatures in the case of LB19. The remaining three ALMA detections do not have\ninfrared counterparts and can be classified as either deeply embedded objects\nor as starless cores if B30 members. In the former case, two of them (LB08 and\nLB31) show internal luminosity upper limits consistent with Very Low Luminosity\nobjects, while we do not have enough information for LB10. In the starless core\nscenario, and taking into account the estimated masses from ALMA and the\nAPEX/LABOCA cores, we estimate final masses for the central objects in the\nsubstellar domain, so they could be classified as pre-BD core candidates.\n", "  Quantum entanglement in mechanical systems is not only a key signature of\nmacroscopic quantum effects, but has wide applications in quantum technologies.\nHere we proposed an effective approach for creating strong steady-state\nentanglement between two directly coupled mechanical oscillators (or a\nmechanical oscillator and a microwave resonator) in a modulated optomechanical\nsystem. The entanglement is achieved by combining the processes of a cavity\ncooling and the two-mode parametric interaction, which can surpass the bound on\nthe maximal stationary entanglement from the two-mode parametric interaction.\nIn principle, our proposal allows one to cool the system from an initial\nthermal state to an entangled state with high purity by a monochromatic driving\nlaser. Also, the obtained entangled state can be used to implement the\ncontinuous-variable teleportation with high fidelity. Moreover, our proposal is\nrobust against the thermal fluctuations of the mechanical modes under the\ncondition of strong optical pumping.\n", "  We investigate theoretically the ground-state property of a two-dimensional\narray of superconducting circuits including the on-site superconducting qubits\n(SQs) with weak anharmonicity. In particular, we analyse the influence of this\nanharmonicity on the Mott insulator to superfluid quantum phase transition. The\ncomplete ground-state phase diagrams are presented under the mean field\napproximation. Interestingly, the anharmonicity of SQs affects the Mott lobes\nenormously, and the single excitation Mott lobe disappears when the\nanharmonicity become zero. Our results can be used to guide the implementations\nof quantum simulations using the superconducting circuits, which have nice\nintegrating and flexibility.\n", "  Using Brownian dynamics simulations we perform a systematic investigation of\nthe shear-induced migration of colloidal particles subject to Poiseuille flow\nin both cylindrical and planar geometry. We find that adding an attractive\ncomponent to the interparticle interaction enhances the migration effect,\nconsistent with recent simulation studies of platelet suspensions.\nMonodisperse, bidisperse and polydisperse systems are studied over a range of\nshear rates, considering both steady states and the transient dynamics arising\nfrom the onset of flow. For bidisperse and polydisperse systems size\nsegregation is observed.\n", "  The recent discovery of a roughly simultaneous periodic variability in the\nlight curves of the BL Lac object PG 1553+113 at several electromagnetic bands\nrepresents the first case of such odd behavior reported in the literature.\nMotivated by this, we analyzed 15 GHz interferometric maps of the parsec-scale\nradio jet of PG 1553+113 to verify the presence of a possible counterpart of\nthis periodic variability. We used the Cross-Entropy statistical technique to\nobtain the structural parameters of the Gaussian components present in the\nradio maps of this source. We kinematically identified seven jet components\nformed coincidentally with flare-like features seen in the $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurve. From the derived jet component positions in the sky plane and their\nkinematics (ejection epochs, proper motions, and sky position angles), we\nmodeled their temporal changes in terms of a relativistic jet that is steadily\nprecessing in time. Our results indicate a precession period in the observer's\nreference frame of $2.24\\pm0.03$ years, compatible with the periodicity\ndetected in the light curves of PG 1553+113. However, the maxima of the jet\nDoppler boosting factor are systematically delayed relative to the peaks of the\nmain $\\gamma$-ray flares. We propose two scenarios that could explain this\ndelay, both based on the existence of a supermassive black hole binary system\nin PG 1553+113. We estimated the characteristics of this putative binary system\nthat also would be responsible for driving the inferred jet precession.\n", "  It is a current important subject to clarify properties of chiral\nthree-nucleon forces (3NFs) not only in nuclear matter but also in scattering\nbetween finite-size nuclei. Particularly for the elastic scattering, this study\nhas just started and the properties are not understood in a wide range of\nincident energies ($E_{\\rm in}$). We investigate basic properties of chiral\n3NFs in nuclear matter with positive energies by using the\nBrueckner-Hartree-Fock method with chiral two-nucleon forces of N$^{3}$LO and\n3NFs of NNLO, and analyze effects of chiral 3NFs on $^{4}$He elastic scattering\nfrom targets $^{208}$Pb, $^{58}$Ni and $^{40}$Ca over a wide range of $30\n\\lesssim E_{\\rm in}/A_{\\rm P} \\lesssim 200$ MeV by using the $g$-matrix folding\nmodel, where $A_{\\rm P}$ is the mass number of projectile. In symmetric nuclear\nmatter with positive energies, chiral 3NFs make the single-particle potential\nless attractive and more absorptive. The effects mainly come from the\nFujita-Miyazawa 2$\\pi$-exchange 3NF and slightly become larger as $E_{\\rm in}$\nincreases. These effects persist in the optical potentials of $^{4}$He\nscattering. As for the differential cross sections of $^{4}$He scattering,\nchiral-3NF effects are large in $E_{\\rm in}/A_{\\rm P} \\gtrsim 60$ MeV and\nimprove the agreement of the theoretical results with the measured ones.\nParticularly in $E_{\\rm in}/A_{\\rm P} \\gtrsim 100$ MeV, the folding model\nreproduces measured differential cross sections pretty well. Cutoff ($\\Lambda$)\ndependence is investigated for both nuclear matter and $^{4}$He scattering by\nconsidering two cases of $\\Lambda=450$ and $550$ MeV. The uncertainty coming\nfrom the dependence is smaller than chiral-3NF effects even at $E_{\\rm\nin}/A_{\\rm P}=175$ MeV.\n", "  We present results from a search for short time-scale white dwarf variability\nusing \\texttt{gPhoton}, a time-tagged database of \\textit{GALEX} photon events\nand associated software package. We conducted a survey of $320$ white dwarf\nstars in the McCook-Sion catalogue, inspecting each for photometric variability\nwith particular emphasis on variability over time-scales less than $\\sim 30$\nminutes. From that survey, we present the discovery of a new pulsating white\ndwarf: WD 2246-069. A Ca II K line is found in archival ESO spectra and an IR\nexcess is seen in WISE $W1$ and $W2$ bands. Its independent modes are\nidentified in follow-up optical photometry and used to model its interior\nstructure. Additionally, we detect UV pulsations in four previously known\npulsating ZZ Ceti-type (DAVs). Included in this group is the simultaneous\nfitting of the pulsations of WD 1401-147 in optical, near-ultraviolet and\nfar-ultraviolet bands using nearly concurrent Whole Earth Telescope and\n\\textit{GALEX} data, providing observational insight into the wavelength\ndependence of white dwarf pulsation amplitudes.\n", "  Data on the reaction $\\gamma p\\to K^+\\Lambda$ from the CLAS experiments are\nused to derive the leading multipoles, $E_{0+}$, $M_{1-}$, $E_{1+}$, and\n$M_{1+}$, from the production threshold to 2180\\,MeV in 24 slices of the\ninvariant mass. The four multipoles are determined without any constraints. The\nmultipoles are fitted using a multichannel $L+P$ model which allows us to\nsearch for singularities and to extract the positions of poles on the complex\nenergy plane in an almost model-independent method. The multipoles are also\nused as additional constraints in an energy-dependent analysis of a large body\nof pion and photo-induced reactions within the Bonn-Gatchina (BnGa) partial\nwave analysis. The study confirms the existence of poles due to nucleon\nresonances with spin-parity $J^P = 1/2^-; 1/2^+$, and $3/2^+$ in the region at\nabout 1.9\\,GeV.\n", "  The nonlinear quantum regime is crucial for implementing interesting quantum\neffects, which have wide applications in modern quantum science. Here we\npropose an effective method to reach the nonlinear quantum regime in a\nmodulated optomechanical system (OMS), which is originally in the weak-coupling\nregime. The mechanical spring constant and optomechanical interaction are\nmodulated periodically. This leads to the result that the resonant\noptomechanical interaction can be effectively enhanced into the single-photon\nstrong-coupling regime by the modulation-induced mechanical parametric\namplification. Moreover, the amplified phonon noise can be suppressed\ncompletely by introducing a squeezed vacuum reservoir, which ultimately leads\nto the realization of photon blockade in a weakly coupled OMS. The reached\nnonlinear quantum regime also allows us to engineer the nonclassical states\n(e.g., Schr\\\"{o}dinger cat states) of cavity field, which are robust against\nthe phonon noise. This work offers an alternative approach to enhance the\nquantum nonlinearity of an OMS, which should expand the applications of cavity\noptomechanics in the quantum realm.\n", "  We study a mechanism of activity sustaining on networks inspired by a\nwell-known model of neuronal dynamics. Our primary focus is the emergence of\nself-sustaining collective activity patterns, where no single node can stay\nactive by itself, but the activity provided initially is sustained within the\ncollective of interacting agents. In contrast to existing models of\nself-sustaining activity that are caused by (long) loops present in the\nnetwork, here we focus on tree--like structures and examine activation\nmechanisms that are due to temporal memory of the nodes. This approach is\nmotivated by applications in social media, where long network loops are rare or\nabsent. Our results suggest that under a weak behavioral noise, the nodes\nrobustly split into several clusters, with partial synchronization of nodes\nwithin each cluster. We also study the randomly-weighted version of the models\nwhere the nodes are allowed to change their connection strength (this can model\nattention redistribution), and show that it does facilitate the self-sustained\nactivity.\n", "  We present the fundamental properties of 87 stars based on angular diameter\nmeasurements from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, 36 of which have\nnot been measured previously using interferometry. Our sample consists of 5\ndwarfs, 3 subgiants, 69 giants, 3 bright giants, and 7 supergiants, and span a\nwide range of spectral classes from B to M. We combined our angular diameters\nwith photometric and distance information from the literature to determine each\nstar's physical radius, effective temperature, bolometric flux, luminosity,\nmass, and age.\n", "  In this work, we propose a family of single-node second-order boundary\nschemes for the lattice Boltzmann method with general collision terms. The\nconstruction of the schemes is quite universal and simple, it does not involve\nconcrete lattice Boltzmann models and uses the half-way bounce-back rule as a\ncentral step. The constructed schemes are all second-order accurate if so is\nthe bounce-back rule. In addition, the proposed schemes have good stability\nthanks to convex combinations. The accuracy and stability of several specific\nschemes are numerically validated for multiple-relaxation-time models in both\n2D and 3D.\n", "  We report on the fabrication and performance of a new kind of tip for\nscanning tunneling microscopy. By fully incorporating a metallic tip on a\nsilicon chip using modern micromachining and nanofabrication techniques, we\nrealize so-called smart tips and show the possibility of device-based STM tips.\nContrary to conventional etched metal wire tips, these can be integrated into\nlithographically defined electrical or photonic circuits, as well as mechanical\nsystems. We experimentally demonstrate that the performance of the smart tips\nis on par with conventional ones, both in stability and resolution. In situ tip\npreparation methods are possible and we verify that they can resolve the\nherringbone reconstruction and Friedel oscillations on Au(111) surfaces. In\naddition, these devices can be made to accommodate two isolated tips with\nsub-50 nm apex-to-apex distance to measure electron correlations at the\nnanoscale using a new type of double-tip experiment described in this letter.\n", "  The method of waveforms cross correlation (WCC) is used to detect signals\nfrom aftershocks of the August 14, 2016 earthquake within Sakhalin Island,\nwhich had local magnitude ML = 6.1. Arrivals of regular P- and S-waves detected\nby the WCC method with various master events at 6 regional stations are\nassociated into a set of seismic events called the cross correlation standard\nevent list (XSEL). We compare the XSEL with the bulletin for the same\naftershock sequence compiled in routine seismological processing. The principal\nadvantage of the XSEL is expressed in the increasing number of found seismic\nevents with three or more associated stations, a slight decrease in the\nmagnitude threshold of catalogue completeness, and more accurate location of\nthe epicentres for even the smallest aftershocks. The improved aftershock\nlocations tend to cluster in a narrow zone corresponding to the western board\nof the Central Sakhalin fault, which defines the boundary between the Okhotsk\nand the Eurasian (Amur) slabs.\n", "  Three-dimensional microwave waveguide cavities are essential tools for many\ncavity quantum electrodynamics experiments. However, the need to control\nquantum emitters with dc magnetic fields inside the cavity often limits such\nexperiments to normal-conducting cavities with relatively low quality factors\nof about $10^4$. Similarly, controlling quantum emitters with dc electric\nfields in normal- and superconducting waveguide cavities has so far been\ndifficult, because the insertion of dc electrodes has strongly limited the\nquality factor. Here, we present a method to apply dc electric fields within a\nsuperconducting waveguide cavity, which is based on the insertion of dc\nelectrodes at the nodes of the microwave electric field. Moreover, we present a\nmethod to apply dc magnetic fields within the same cavity by trapping the\nmagnetic flux in holes positioned in facing walls of the cavity. We demonstrate\nthat the $\\text{TE}_{301}$ mode of such a superconducting, rectangular cavity\nmade from niobium maintains a high internal quality factor of $Q_{\\text{int}}\n\\sim 1.7 \\cdot 10^6$ at the few photon level and a base temperature of\n$3~\\text{K}$. A cloud of Rydberg atoms coupled to the microwave electric field\nof the cavity is used to probe the applied dc electric and magnetic fields via\nthe quadratic Stark effect and the Zeeman effect, respectively.\n", "  We consider the scattering of neutrons and photons on solid volume\nrectangular targets. It is common to treat this problem using the Maxwell\nBoltzmann Transport Equation and to use underlying symmetries to simplify the\ncalculation. For isotropic scattering centers we can introduce a direct\nFredholm integral equation approach to finding the flux. Here we compare a\nMonte Carlo evaluation of the resulting Fredholm equation to a deterministic\niteration method of solution. We include a kernel based method for estimating\nthe overall angular dependence. We find that for simple geometries utilized in\nstudies of radiative dosimetry, of neutron shielding assessments, and\nindirectly of criticality that we get reasonably rapid convergence of flux and\ncurrent values.\n", "  MR images have a magnitude and a phase, but in almost all clinical\napplications only the magnitude images are used, because the phase images have\na smooth but strong background signal that masks useful information. The phase\ncontains information such as the temperature during thermal ablation, and the\niron content of brain tissue. We describe a novel method to suppress the\nbackground that is based on higher order edge detection and sparse image\nrepresentation.\n", "  A key part of planning CO2 storage sites is to devise a monitoring strategy.\nThe aim of this strategy is to fulfill the requirements of legislations and\nlower cost of the operation by avoiding operational problems. If CCS is going\nto be a widespread technology to deliver energy without CO2 emissions,\ncost-efficient monitoring programs will be a key to reduce the storage costs. A\nsimulation framework, previously used to estimate flow parameters at Sleipner\nLayer 9 [1], is here extended and employed to identify how the number of\nmeasurements can be reduced without significantly reducing the obtained\ninformation. The main part of the methodology is based on well-proven, stable\nand robust, simulation technology together with adjoint-based sensitivities and\ndata mining techniques using singular value decomposition (SVD). In particular\nwe combine the simulation framework with time-dependent (seismic) measurements\nof the migrating plume. We also study how uplift data and gravitational data\ngive complementary information.\n  We apply this methodology to the Sleipner project, which provides the most\nextensive data for CO2 storage to date. For this study we utilize a\nvertical-equilibrium (VE) flow model for computational efficiency as\nimplemented in the open-source software MRST-co2lab.\n  However, our methodology for deriving efficient monitoring schemes is not\nrestricted to VE-type flow models, and at the end, we discuss how the\nmethodology can be used in the context of full 3D simulations.\n", "  The amount of non-stoichiometric oxygen in La_{2-x}Sr_xCoO_{4+y} is\ncalculated from Sr doping, x, and the measured stripe incommensurability 2delta\nfor x = 1/4 and x = 1/3 based on a linear or square-root dependence of delta(x,\ny). The results favor the square-root dependence and indicate that the range of\nexcess oxygen extends to x < 0.4 instead of to x < 0.3 as previously thought,\ncoinciding with the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) phase.\n", "  The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes the elementary\nparticles and their interactions at low energies, up to 100 GeV. Beyond this\nscale lies the realm of new physics needed to remedy problems that arise at\nhigher energies, the TeV scale and above. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is the most\nfavored extension of the Standard Model that solves many of its limitations, if\npredicted SUSY particles exist at the TeV scale. The Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC) at CERN has opened a new phase of exploration into new physics at the TeV\nscale after increasing the center-of-mass energy of the proton-proton\ncollisions to 13 TeV. The ATLAS experiment has collected this collision data\nwith over 90% efficiency due to the excellent performance of many of its\nsystems, in particular the data acquisition system. The work described in this\ndissertation ensures the efficient collection of ATLAS data as well as the\nanalysis of this data to search for SUSY. The search for strongly produced\nsupersymmetric particles decaying into final states with multiple energetic\njets and either two leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge\nor at least three leptons was performed using the proton-proton collision\ndataset of 36 fb$^{-1}$ at 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and\n2016. Due to the low Standard Model background, these final states are\nparticularly adapted to searches for gluinos or third generation squarks in\nseveral supersymmetric production topologies determined from a variety of\nsimplified and phenomenological models. The absence of excess over the Standard\nModel prediction is interpreted in terms of limits on the masses of\nsuperpartners derived at 95% confidence level. In the studied decay modes and\ndepending on the decay topology, the existence of gluinos with masses below 1.9\nTeV, sbottoms with masses below 700 GeV, and neutralinos with masses below 1.2\nTeV are excluded.\n", "  In this paper, we address the question as to whether or not measurable\nsources for gravitational waves could possibly be made in the laboratory. Based\non an analogy of the dynamical Casimir effect with the stimulated emission of\nradiation in the laser, our answer to this question is in the affirmative,\nprovided that superconducting radio-frequency cavities in fact possess high\nquality factors for both electromagnetic and gravitational microwave radiation,\nas one would expect due to a quantum-mechanical gravitational Meissner-like\neffect. In order to characterize the response of matter to tensor gravitational\nfields, we introduce a prefactor to the source term of the gravitational wave\nequation, which we call the \"relative gravitational permeativity\" analogous to\nthe \"relative electric permittivity\" and \"relative magnetic permeability\" that\ncharacterize the vector response of matter to applied fields in\nelectromagnetism. This allows for a possibly large quantum mechanical\nenhancement of the response of a superconductor to an incident tensor\ngravitational wave field. Finally, we describe our experimental work with\nhigh-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities, and propose a design for a\ncoupled-cavity system with a flexible superconducting membrane in its middle as\nits amplifying element. This will then allow us to test for a Meissner-like\nexpulsion, and therefore reflection, of incident tensor gravitational wave\nfields, and, above a certain threshold, to generate coherent gravitational\nradiation via the dynamical Casimir effect.\n", "  We introduce notions of information/entropy and information loss associated\nto exponentiable motivic measures. We show that they satisfy appropriate\nanalogs to the Khinchin-type properties that characterize information loss in\nthe context of measures on finite sets.\n", "  Measurements of plasma electric fields are essential to the advancement of\nplasma science and applications. Methods for non-invasive in situ measurements\nof plasma fields on sub-millimeter length scales with high sensitivity over a\nlarge field range remain an outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce and\ndemonstrate a new method for plasma electric field measurement that employs\nelectromagnetically induced transparency as a high-resolution quantum-optical\nprobe for the Stark energy level shifts of plasma-embedded Rydberg atoms, which\nserve as highly-sensitive field sensors with a large dynamic range. The method\nis applied in diagnostics of plasmas photo-excited out of a cesium vapor. The\nplasma electric fields are extracted from spatially-resolved measurements of\nfield-induced shape changes and shifts of Rydberg resonances in rubidium tracer\natoms. Measurement capabilities over a range of plasma densities and\ntemperatures are exploited to characterize plasmas in applied magnetic fields\nand to image electric-field distributions in cyclotron-heated plasmas.\n", "  A new variant of the $(2+1)$-dimensional [$(2+1)d$] Boussinesq equation was\nrecently introduced by J. Y. Zhu, arxiv:1704.02779v2, 2017; see eq. (3). First,\nwe derive in this paper the one-soliton solutions of both bright and dark types\nfor the extended $(2+1)d$ Boussinesq equation by using the traveling wave\nmethod. Second, $N$-soliton, breather, and rational solutions are obtained by\nusing the Hirota bilinear method and the long wave limit. Nonsingular rational\nsolutions of two types were obtained analytically, namely: (i) rogue-wave\nsolutions having the form of W-shaped lines waves and (ii) lump-type solutions.\nTwo generic types of semi-rational solutions were also put forward. The\nobtained semi-rational solutions are as follows: (iii) a hybrid of a\nfirst-order lump and a bright one-soliton solution and (iv) a hybrid of a\nfirst-order lump and a first-order breather.\n", "  We demonstrate continuous-frequency electric field measurements of\nhigh-intensity microwaves via optical spectroscopy in a small atomic vapor\ncell. The spectroscopic response of a room-temperature rubidium atomic vapor in\na glass cell is investigated and employed for absolute measurements of\nK$_a$-band microwave electric fields from $\\sim$200 V/m to $>$1 kV/m over a\ncontinuous frequency range of $\\pm $1 GHz (15% band coverage). It is\nestablished that in strong microwave fields frequency-specific spectral\nfeatures allow for electric field measurements over a large continuous\nfrequency range.\n", "  In this paper, we modeled and simulated uneven current distribution for\non-die interconnect structure. We show significant difference when considering\nuneven current distribution. Finite Element Method approach is used to analyze\nvarious variation effects. Blech length effect and analytical EM lifetime\ncalculation is used to quickly identify on-die EM weak wires. We propose a\nrandom walk based approach to evaluate on-die variation impact on\nelectromigration reliability. Experimental results show substantial EM\ndegradation with variation effects present.\n", "  We describe a thermal atmosphere around a black hole as vacuum excitations\nnear to gravitational radius of a contracting thin black shell, i.e., in terms\nof properties of the physical vacuum of fields around a thin shell of mass $M$\ncollapsing from infinity to the Schwarzschild radius according to an external\nstationary observer. A natural explanation is introduced for the necessary\ncutoff using the equations of motion of the shells. We make a thermodynamic\ndescription of a fermionic field near the gravitational radius. Then a solution\nto the species problem for two fields, scalar one and spinor one, is proposed.\nFinally we get the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as entanglement entropy of a\nthermal atmosphere, independent from number of fields.\n", "  Nanobubbles in liquids are mysterious gaseous objects having exceptional\nstability. They promise a wide range of applications but their production is\nnot well controlled and localized. Alternating polarity electrolysis of water\nis a tool that can control production of bulk nanobubbles in space and time\nwithout generating larger bubbles. Using the schlieren technique a detailed\nthree-dimensional structure of a dense cloud of nanobubbles above the\nelectrodes is visualized. It is demonstrated that the thermal effects produce\ndifferent schlieren pattern and have different dynamics. A localized volume\nenriched with nanobubbles can be separated from the parent cloud and exists on\nits own. This volume demonstrates buoyancy from which the concentration of\nnanobubbles is estimated as 2x10^18 m^-3. This concentration is smaller than\nthat in the parent cloud. Dynamic light scattering shows that the average size\nof nanobubbles during the process is 60-80 nm. The bubbles are observed 15\nminutes after switching off the electrical pulses but their size is shifted to\nlarger values of about 250 nm. Thus, an efficient way to generate and control\nnanobubbles is proposed.\n", "  We report on a laboratory activity carried out together with secondary school\n(high-school) students, with the aim of increasing their interest toward\nhistorical scientific instruments and stimulate their approach to scientific\nknowledge. To this purpose, we propose a hands-on activity that can be\nfruitfully performed at the University scientific museums. We organized a\none-week summer stage at the Historical Collection of Physics Instruments and\nat the Museum of Chemistry of the University of Palermo. A group of selected\nstudents attended it, under the tutoring of university researchers. They were\nshowed some Bunsen burners belonging to the collections, how they are restored,\nhow they work and how they were used in the chemical laboratories. At the end\nof the stage, students introduced museum visitors to these instruments,\ndescribing them and referring about the activities they had carried out.\n", "  In several geophysical applications, such as full waveform inversion and data\nmodelling, we are facing the solution of inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation. The\ndifficulties of solving the Helmholtz equa- tion are two fold. Firstly, in the\ncase of large scale problems we cannot calculate the inverse of the Helmholtz\noperator directly. Hence, iterative algorithms should be implemented. Secondly,\nthe Helmholtz operator is non-unitary and non-diagonalizable which in turn\ndeteriorates the performances of the iterative algorithms (especially for high\nwavenumbers). To overcome this issue, we need to im- plement proper\npreconditioners for a Krylov subspace method to solve the problem efficiently.\nIn this paper we incorporated shifted-Laplace operators to precondition the\nsystem of equations and then generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method used\nto solve the problem iteratively. The numerical results show the performance of\nthe preconditioning operator in improving the convergence rate of the GMRES\nalgorithm for data modelling case. In the companion paper we discussed the\napplication of preconditioned data modelling algorithm in the context of\nfrequency domain full waveform inversion. However, the analysis of the degree\nof suitability of the preconditioners in the solution of Helmholtz equation is\nan ongoing field of study.\n", "  Seismic waves bring information from the physical properties of the earth to\nthe surface. Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a local optimization technique\nwhich tries to invert the recorded wave fields to the physical properties. An\nefficient forward-modelling engine along with local differential algorithm, to\ncompute the gradient and Hessian operators, are two key ingredients of FWI\napproach. FWI can be done in time or frequency domain. Each method has its own\npros and cons. Here, we only discuss frequency domain method with Krylov\nsubspace solvers for time-harmonic wave equation. Nonlinearity of the problem\nrequires good initial macro model of the physical properties and low frequency\ndata. Macro models are built based on the kinematic information of the recorded\nwave fields. Another difficulty is the data modelling algorithm which is hard\nto solve especially for high wavenumbers (high frequencies). Without\nincorporation of high frequencies in the FWI algorithm we are not going to be\nable to update the macro models to high resolution ones. In the companion paper\nwe showed that efficient forward modelling algorithms can be reached via proper\npreconditioners. Here, we will use the preconditioned data modelling engine in\nthe context of local optimization method to solve for model parameters. The\nresults show that we yield better convergence of the method and better quality\nof the inverted models after using the preconditioned FWI.\n", "  This paper develops a Statics Preserving Sparse Radon transform (SPSR)\nalgorithm.The de-coloration power of Radon basis functions depends on different\nfactors. The most important one is statics. Statics decrease the sparsity of\nRadon models. To tackle this problem, it is necessary to include statics into\nthe Radon bases functions. SPSR algorithm includes statics into the Radon bases\nfunctions, allowing for a sparse representation of statics contaminated data in\nthe Radon domain. SPSR algorithm formulated as an $L_2- L_1$ optimization\nproblem and solved via alternating minimization method. Real data examples used\nto test the performance of the proposed method in multiple and noise\nattenuation in the presence of statics.\n", "  We demonstrate that the interfacial exchange coupling in\nferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) systems induces symmetry-breaking of\nthe Spin-Orbit (SO) effects. This has been done by studying the field and angle\ndependencies of anisotropic magnetoresistance and vectorialresolved\nmagnetization hysteresis loops, measured simultaneously and reproduced with\nnumerical simulations. We show how the induced unidirectional magnetic\nanisotropy at the FM/AFM interface results in strong asymmetric transport\nbehaviors, which are chiral around the magnetization hard-axis direction.\nSimilar asymmetric features are anticipated in other SO-driven phenomena.\n", "  We report a successful preparation of a purely honeycomb, graphene-like\nborophene, by using an Al(111) surface as the substrate and molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE) growth in ultrahigh vacuum. Our scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM) reveals perfect monolayer borophene with planar, non-buckled honeycomb\nlattice similar as graphene. Theoretical calculations show that the honeycomb\nborophene on Al(111) is energetically stable. Remarkably, nearly one electron\ncharge is transferred to each boron atom from the Al(111) substrate and\nstabilizes the honeycomb borophene structure, in contrast to the little charge\ntransfer in borophene/Ag(111) case. This work demonstrates that the borophene\nlattice can be manipulated by controlling the charge transfer between the\nsubstrate and the borophene film.\n", "  Chronic stress affects nano to microscale structures of the brain\ncells/tissues due the suppression of neural growths and reconnections, hence\nthe neuronal activities. This results in depression, memory loss and even the\ndeath of the brain cells. Our recently developed novel optical technique,\npartial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy has nanoscale sensitivity, and\nhence, can detect nanoscale changes in brain tissues due to stress. In this\nstudy, we applied this technique to quantify the stress related structural\nchanges in the corticosterone-treated mouse model of stress. Our results show\nthat brains from corticosterone-treated mice showed higher nanoscale structural\ndisorder in the hippocampal region as compared to the brain from normal\n(vehicle) mice. The increase in structural alteration correlates with the\nduration of the stress. We further quantified the relative changes and the\nspatial localization of these changes in this mouse model and found out that\nthe maximum changes occurred nearly symmetrically in both regions of the\nhippocampus. The mRNA for stress-related genes, BDNF and TrkB were also\nsignificantly reduced in the hippocampus of corticosterone-treated mice\ncompared to that in control mice. These results indicate that chronic\ncorticosterone treatment induces nanoscale structural alterations in mouse\nbrain that corresponds to the changes in stress-related gene expression.\n", "  It is argued that the bulk of black holes (BH) in the universe are primordial\n(PBH). This assertion is strongly supported by the recent astronomical\nobservations, which allow to conclude that supermassive BHs with $M= (10^6 -\n10^9) M_\\odot$ \"work\" as seeds for galaxy formation, intermediate mass BHs, $ M\n= (10^3 - 10^4) M_\\odot$, do the same job for globular clusters and dwarf\ngalaxies, while black holes of a few solar masses are the constituents of dark\nmatter of the universe. The mechanism of PBH formation, suggested in 1993,\nwhich predicted such features of the universe, is described. The model leads to\nthe log-normal mass spectrum of PBHs, which is determined by three constant\nparameters. With proper adjustment of these parameters the above mentioned\nfeatures are quantitatively explained. In particular, the calculated density of\nnumerous superheavy BHs in the young universe, $ z = 5 - 10$, nicely fits the\ndata. The puzzling properties of the sources of the LIGO-discovered\ngravitational waves are also naturally explained assuming that these sources\nare PBHs.\n", "  Morphology of the interlayer van der Waals surface and differential tunneling\nconductance in p-Bi2-xSbxTe3-ySey solid solutions were studied by scanning\ntunneling microscopy and spectroscopy in dependence on compositions.\nTopological characteristics of the Dirac fermion surface states were\ndetermined. It is shown that the thermoelectric power factor and the material\nparameter enhance with the shift of the Dirac point to the top of the valence\nband with increasing of atomic substitution in these thermoelectrics.\nCorrelation between topological characteristics, power factor and material\nparameter was found. A growth contribution of the surface states is determined\nby an increase of the Fermi velocity for large atomic substitutions of Bi at\nx>1.5 and small substitutions in the Te sublattice (y=0.06). In compositions\nwith smaller substitutions at x = (1-1.3) and y=(0.06-0.09), similar effect of\nthe surface states is determined by raise of the surface concentration of\ncharge carriers.\n", "  We review the properties of nonlinear, multidimensional localized waves whose\nstationary propagation is sustained by a dynamic equilibrium between\nself-focusing and nonlinear losses. Their finite-energy versions preserve light\nbullet behavior well-beyond the characteristic diffraction or dispersion\ndistances, and rebuild after obstacles. There exists a preferential lossy light\nbullet with maximum intensity and losses, defined solely by the optical\nproperties of the medium, which is the most stable, non-conical localized wave\nsupported by a medium with self-focusing nonlinearity and nonlinear losses.\nThis preferential lossy light bullet acts as an attractor during self-focusing\nof Gaussian-like wave packets when collapse is halted by nonlinear absorption,\na fact that can explain relevant characteristics of the observed light filament\ndynamics in media with anomalous dispersion.\n", "  We comment on mistakes and inaccuracies of a paper by Chen et al. concerning\nthe optical torque from generic optical fields on dipolar chiral particles,\ni.e. on those whose scattering is fully described by the first electric,\nmagnetic and magnetoelectric Mie coefficients.\n", "  We present a detailed numerical study of various blow-up issues in the\ncontext of the focusing Davey-Stewartson II equation. To this end we study\nGaussian initial data and perturbations of the lump and the explicit blow-up\nsolution due to Ozawa. Based on the numerical results it is conjectured that\nthe blow-up in all cases is self similar, and that the time dependent scaling\nis as in the Ozawa solution and not as in the stable blow-up of standard\n$L^{2}$ critical nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations. The blow-up profile is\ngiven by a dynamically rescaled lump.\n", "  A certain degree of inhibition is a common trait of dynamical networks in\nnature, ranging from neuronal and biochemical networks, to social and\ntechnological networks. We study here the role of inhibition in a\nrepresentative dynamical network model, characterizing the dynamics of random\nthreshold networks with both excitatory and inhibitory links. Varying the\nfraction of excitatory links has a strong effect on the network's population\nactivity and its sensitivity to perturbation. The average degree $K$, known to\nhave a strong effect on the dynamics when small, loses its influence on the\ndynamics as its value increases. Instead, the strength of inhibition is a\ndeterminant of dynamics and sensitivity here, allowing for criticality only in\na specific corridor of inhibition. This criticality corridor requires that\nexcitation dominates, while the balance region corresponds to maximum\nsensitivity to perturbation. We develop mean-field approximations of the\npopulation activity and sensitivity and find that the network dynamics is\nindependent of degree distribution for high $K$. In a minimal model of an\nadaptive threshold network we demonstrate how the dynamics remains robust\nagainst changes in the topology. This adaptive model can be extended in order\nto generate networks with a controllable activity distribution and specific\ntopologies.\n", "  We study the spin-parity distribution P(J$^{\\pi}$,E) of $^{156}$Gd excited\nstates above the neutron separation energy $S_{n}=8.536$ MeV\n\\cite{156Gd_list_of_levels} that are expected to be populated via the 1-step\nneutron pickup reaction $^{157}$Gd($^{3}$He,$^{4}$He)$^{156}$Gd. In analogy\nwith the rotor plus particle model \\cite{Bohr&Mottelson-II}, we view excited\nstates in $^{156}$Gd as rotational excitations built on intrinsic states\nconsisting of a neutron hole in the $^{157}$Gd core, that is, a neutron removal\nfrom a deformed Woods-Saxon type single-particle state \\cite{Woods-Saxon:1954}\nin $^{157}$Gd. The particle-core interaction usually dominated by a Coriolis\ncoupling are accounted via first order perturbation theory\n\\cite{VGGueorguiev:07062002}. The reaction cross section to each excited state\nin $^{156}$Gd is calculated as coherent contribution using a standard reaction\ncode \\cite{CHUCK} based on spherical basis states. The spectroscopic factor\nassociated with each state is the expansion coefficient of the deformed neutron\nstate in a spherical Sturmian basis along with the spherical form factors\n\\cite{VGGueorguiev:07062002}. The total cross section, as a function of the\nexcitation energy, is generated using Lorentzian smearing distribution\nfunction. Our calculations show that, within the assumptions and computational\nmodeling, the reaction $^{3}$He+$^{157}$Gd $\\rightarrow$\n$^{4}$He+$^{156}$Gd$^{\\star}$ has a smooth formation probability P(J$^{\\pi}$,E)\nwithin the energy range relevant to the desired reaction $^{155}$Gd+n\n$\\rightarrow$ $^{156}$Gd$^{\\star}$. The formation probability P(J$^{\\pi}$,E)\nresembles a Gaussian distribution with centroids and widths that differ for\npositive and negative parity states.\n", "  The rapid charging and/or discharging of electrochemical cells can lead to\nlocalized depletion of electrolyte concentration. This depletion can\nsignificantly impact the system's time dependent resistance. For systems with\nporous electrodes, electrolyte depletion can limit the rate of charging and\nincrease energy dissipation. Here we propose a theory to control and avoid\nelectrolyte depletion by tailoring the value and spatial distribution of\nresistance in a porous electrode. We explore the somewhat counterintuitive idea\nthat increasing local spatial resistances of the solid electrode itself leads\nto improved charging rate and minimal change in energy loss. We analytically\nderive a simple expression for an electrode resistance profile that leads to\nhighly uniform electrolyte depletion. We use numerical simulations to explore\nthis theory and simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of electrolyte concentration\nin the case of a supercapacitor with various tailored electrode resistance\nprofiles which avoid localized depletion. This increases charging rate up to\naround 2-fold with minimal effect on overall dissipated energy in the system.\n", "  The paper presents a new state estimation algorithm for a bilinear equation\nrepresenting the Fourier- Galerkin (FG) approximation of the Navier-Stokes (NS)\nequations on a torus in R2. This state equation is subject to uncertain but\nbounded noise in the input (Kolmogorov forcing) and initial conditions, and its\noutput is incomplete and contains bounded noise. The algorithm designs a\ntime-dependent gain such that the estimation error converges to zero\nexponentially. The sufficient condition for the existence of the gain are\nformulated in the form of algebraic Riccati equations. To demonstrate the\nresults we apply the proposed algorithm to the reconstruction a chaotic fluid\nflow from incomplete and noisy data.\n", "  We prove the existence and, in certain cases, the uniqueness of functional\nsolutions for two boundary value problems of systems of P.D.E. in divergence\nform motivated by problems of heat and mass transfer. If $\\cc_F$ and $\\cc$\ndenote respectively the set of functional and classical solutions of these\nproblems we settle, in simple cases, the question if $\\cc_F=\\cc$.\n", "  The main goal of our study was investigation of the influence of the\ndeformations (sufficiently large for the establishing the non-zero gap) on\nelectrotransport properties of impure graphene. To achieve this purpose, we\nimplemented the simulation package that allows to perform numerical calculation\nof the conductivity and mobility of graphene samples subjected to two types of\nthe uniaxial strain: along zigzag and armchair edges. All numerical\ncalculations are performed within the Kubo-Greenwood methodology along with a\ntight-binding model. Transport properties are studied in case of a presence of\nimpurity atoms described by the weak short-range scattering potential. Various\ndeformation values are considered. The uniaxial strain acts as an additional\nsource of the electron scattering, herewith, can strongly affect both mobility\nand conductivity of graphene and introduce anisotropy of its electron transport\nproperties.\n", "  The moment of inertia of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is studied\nin the framework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing suitable\nhyperon coupling constants. By this method, we find that the suggested radius\nof the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is in the range $R=12.957\\sim12.246$\nkm by the observation $M$=1.97$\\sim$2.05 M$_\\odot$. We also find that the\nsuggested moment of inertia $I$ of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is\nin the range $I$=1.9073$\\times$10$^{45}\\sim$1.5940$\\times10^{45}$ g.cm$^{2}$ by\nthe observation $M$=1.97$\\sim$2.05 M$_\\odot$. Massive pulsars hint that the\ninteraction inside them should be very \"strong\". Though hyperons considered\nwill reduce the maximum mass, but in principle we may have models predicting\nmaximum masses higher than 2 M${_\\odot}$ by choosing suitable parameters, in a\ndegree of freedom of hadron. Our calculations have proved the above and\nperfectly agree with the results both of Aaron W et al and P\\'etri J et al.\n", "  Whether the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 can become a hyperon star is\nexamined in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory by adjusting\nthe hyperon coupling constants. It is found that at the central baryon number\ndensity of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432, the relative particle\nnumber density of hyperons is smaller than those of neutrons and so it can not\nchange into a hyperon star. In its center, it is mainly composed of $\\Lambda$,\n$\\Xi^{-}$ and a few $\\Xi^{0}$. We also found that for the neutron star with a\nmaximum mass of 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$, it can change into a hyperon star and the\nhyperon star transition density is 0.668 fm$^{-3}$, at which the hyperons are\nonly composed of $\\Lambda$. At its center, the hyperons are also only composed\nof $\\Lambda$ and the ratio of the hyperons is a little larger than that of the\nneutrons. This illustrates that the NS1.4M$_{\\odot}$ has just changed into a\nhyperon star.\n", "  The effect of the mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$ on the surface\ngravitional redshift of the neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is examined in the\nframework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing the suitable\nhyperon coupling constants. We find that compared with that without considering\nthe mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$, the value range of the radius $R$ of\nthe neutron star PSR J0348+0432 would be changed from a narrow range 12.964 km\n$\\sim$ 12.364 km to a wider range 12.941 km $\\sim$ 11.907 km corresponding to\nthe observation mass M=1.97 M$_{\\odot}$$\\sim$2.05 M$_{\\odot}$. We also find\nthat the value range of the surface gravitational redshift $z$ of the neutron\nstar PSR J0348+0432 changes from 0.3469 $\\sim$ 0.3997 to 0.3480 $\\sim$ 0.4263\ncorresponding to the observation mass M=1.97 M$_{\\odot}$$\\sim$2.05 M$_{\\odot}$\nas the mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$ being considered. These mean the\nradius $R$ and the surface gravitational redshift $z$ all will be constrained\nin a wider scope as the mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$ being considered.\nWe also can see that the difference of the radius and the surface gravitational\nredshift is not so large whether the mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$ being\nconsidered or not. This indicates that the mesons $f_{0}(975)$ and $\\phi(1020)$\ndo not play a major role in the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432.\n", "  The properties of the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 is calculated in\nthe framework of the relativistic mean field theory by choosing the suitable\nhyperon coupling constants. It is found that the central energy density\n$\\epsilon_{c}$ and the central pressure $p_{c}$ of the massive neutron star PSR\nJ0348+0432 respectively are 1.5 times larger and 3.6 times larger than those of\nthe canonical mass neutron star. It is also found that in the neutron star PSR\nJ0348+0432 there are five kinds of baryons appearing: n, p, $\\Lambda$,\n$\\Xi^{-}$ and $\\Xi^{0}$ but in the canonical mass neutron star there are only\nthree kinds of particles appearing: n, p and $\\Lambda$. In our models, the\npositive well depth $U_{\\Sigma}^{(N)}$ will restrict the production of the\nhyperons $\\Sigma^{-}$, $\\Sigma^{0}$ and $\\Sigma^{+}$ and therefore either in\nthe neutron star PSR J0348+0432 or in the canonical mass neutron star the\nhyperons $\\Sigma^{-}$, $\\Sigma^{0}$ and $\\Sigma^{+}$ all do not appear. In\naddition, our results also show that the radius $R$ of the massive neutron star\nPSR J0348+0432 is less than that of the canonical mass neutron star while the\ngravitational redshift of the former is larger than that of the latter.\n", "  Whether the massive neutron star PSR J0348+0432 can change into a hyperon\nstar is studied in the framework of the relative mean field theory by choosing\nthe suitable hyperon coupling constants. We find that whether the mesons\n$\\sigma^{*}$ and $\\phi$ being considered or not, the neutron star PSR\nJ0348+0432 all can change into a hyperon star and the hyperon star transition\ndensity are the same for the two cases. We also find that the canonical mass\nneutron star also can change into a hyperon star in a minor hyperon star\ntransition density as the mesons $\\sigma^{*}$ and $\\phi$ are not considered.\nOur results confirms some of recent conclusions.\n", "  A scheme to generate highly collimated $\\gamma$-ray pulse is proposed for the\nproduction of muon and electron pairs in $\\gamma-\\gamma$ collider. The\n$\\gamma$-ray pulse, with high conversion efficiency, can be produced as the\nresult of electron phase-locked acceleration in longitudinal electric field\nthrough the interaction between an ultra-intense laser pulse and a narrow tube\ntarget. Numerical simulation shows that 18\\% energy of a 10-PW laser pulse is\ntransferred into the forward $\\gamma$-rays in a divergence angle less than $\n3^\\circ$. The $\\gamma$-ray pulse is applied in $\\gamma-\\gamma$ collider, in\nwhich muon pairs can be produced and electron pairs can be enhanced by more\nthan 3 orders of magnitude. This scheme, which could be realized with the\ncoming 10PW class laser pulses, would allow the observation of a\n$\\gamma-\\gamma$ collider for electron and muon pairs in laboratory.\n", "  The fields of astronomy and astrophysics are currently engaged in an\nunprecedented era of discovery as recent missions have revealed thousands of\nexoplanets orbiting other stars. While the Kepler Space Telescope mission has\nenabled most of these exoplanets to be detected by identifying transiting\nevents, exoplanets often exhibit additional photometric effects that can be\nused to improve the characterization of exoplanets. The EXONEST Exoplanetary\nExplorer is a Bayesian exoplanet inference engine based on nested sampling and\noriginally designed to analyze archived Kepler Space Telescope and CoRoT\n(Convection Rotation et Transits plan\\'etaires) exoplanet mission data. We\ndiscuss the EXONEST software package and describe how it accommodates\nplug-and-play models of exoplanet-associated photometric effects for the\npurpose of exoplanet detection, characterization and scientific hypothesis\ntesting. The current suite of models allows for both circular and eccentric\norbits in conjunction with photometric effects, such as the primary transit and\nsecondary eclipse, reflected light, thermal emissions, ellipsoidal variations,\nDoppler beaming and superrotation. We discuss our new efforts to expand the\ncapabilities of the software to include more subtle photometric effects\ninvolving reflected and refracted light. We discuss the EXONEST inference\nengine design and introduce our plans to port the current MATLAB-based EXONEST\nsoftware package over to the next generation Exoplanetary Explorer, which will\nbe a Python-based open source project with the capability to employ third-party\nplug-and-play models of exoplanet-related photometric effects.\n", "  In order to prevent velocity, pressure, and temperature spikes at material\ndiscontinuities occurring when the interface-capturing schemes inconsistently\nsimulate compressible multi-material flows(when the specific heats ratio is\nvariable),various non-conservative or quasi-conservative numerical models have\nbeen proposed. However, designing a consistent numerical algorithm, especially\nusing the high-order characteristic flux-split based finite-difference method\n(CFS-FDM) is still an open question. In this study, a systematical analysis of\nprevious algorithms of the consistent implementing the high-order CFS-FDM for\nsuch flows is performed, and the reasons of special treatments in these\nalgorithms are revealed. Based on this analysis, a new general numerical\nmethodology that successfully avoids any special treatments as those required\nin previously reported algorithms, is derived. In this new algorithm, we\nrewrite the non-conservative term as a conservative term with a source term\ncontaining velocity divergence. By consistently treating the advection velocity\nin the conservative term and velocity divergence in the source term by imposing\na new additional criterion, specifically, that a multi-fluid algorithm should\nhave the ability of maintaining a pure single-fluid, we finally derive a new\ngeneral algorithm that does not need any special treatment, and is very\nconvenient to implement. The results of some benchmark tests show that the\nfinal algorithm not only maintains the velocity, pressure, and temperature\nequlibria, but is also suitable for problems regarding the interaction of\ninterfaces and strong shock and rarefaction waves.\n", "  As cities grow, certain neighborhoods experience a particularly high demand\nfor housing, resulting in escalating rents. Despite far-reaching socioeconomic\nconsequences, it remains difficult to predict when and where urban\nneighborhoods will face such changes. To tackle this challenge, we adapt the\nconcept of `bioindicators', borrowed from ecology, to the urban context. The\nobjective is to use an `indicator group' of people to assess the quality of a\ncomplex environment and its changes over time. Specifically, we analyze 92\nmillion geolocated Twitter records across five US cities, allowing us to derive\nsocio-economic user profiles based on individual movement patterns. As a\nproof-of-concept, we define users with a `high-income-profile' as an indicator\ngroup and show that their visitation patterns are a suitable indicator for\nexpected future rent increases in different neighborhoods. The concept of\nindicator groups highlights the potential of closely monitoring only a specific\nsubset of the population, rather than the population as a whole. If the\nindicator group is defined appropriately for the phenomenon of interest, this\napproach can yield early predictions while simultaneously reducing the amount\nof data that needs to be collected and analyzed.\n", "  We reconsider the Schr\\\"oder-Siegel problem of conjugating an analytic map in\n$\\mathbb{C}$ in the neighborhood of a fixed point to its linear part, extending\nit to the case of dimension $n>1$. Assuming a condition which is equivalent to\nBruno's one on the eigenvalues $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n$ of the linear part\nwe show that the convergence radius $\\rho$ of the conjugating transformation\nsatisfies $\\ln \\rho(\\lambda )\\geq -C\\Gamma(\\lambda)+C'$ with $\\Gamma(\\lambda)$\ncharacterizing the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, a constant $C'$ not depending on\n$\\lambda$ and $C=1$. This improves the previous results for $n>1$, where the\nknown proofs give $C=2$. We also recall that $C=1$ is known to be the optimal\nvalue for $n=1$.\n", "  We explore the changes in static structure of a two-dimensional system of\nactive Brownian particles (ABP) with hard-disk interactions, using event-driven\nBrownian dynamics simulations. In particular, the effect of the self-propulsion\nvelocity and the rotational diffusivity on the orientationally-averaged fluid\nstructure factor is discussed. Typically activity increases structural ordering\nand generates a structure factor peak at zero wave vector which is a precursor\nof motility-induced phase separation. Our results provide reference data to\ntest future statistical theories for the fluid structure of active Brownian\nsystems.\n", "  Dynamic networks exhibit temporal patterns that vary across different time\nscales, all of which can potentially affect processes that take place on the\nnetwork. However, most data-driven approaches used to model time-varying\nnetworks attempt to capture only a single characteristic time scale in\nisolation --- typically associated with the short-time memory of a Markov chain\nor with long-time abrupt changes caused by external or systemic events. Here we\npropose a unified approach to model both aspects simultaneously, detecting\nshort and long-time behaviors of temporal networks. We do so by developing an\narbitrary-order mixed Markov model with change points, and using a\nnonparametric Bayesian formulation that allows the Markov order and the\nposition of change points to be determined from data without overfitting. In\naddition, we evaluate the quality of the multiscale model in its capacity to\nreproduce the spreading of epidemics on the temporal network, and we show that\ndescribing multiple time scales simultaneously has a synergistic effect, where\nstatistically significant features are uncovered that otherwise would remain\nhidden by treating each time scale independently.\n", "  A galaxy morphological type is correlated with the color indices, luminosity,\nde Vaucouleurs radius, inverse concentration index etc. To study these\nrelations we have to operate with big samples of galaxies, so the visual\nmorphological inspection is not always possible. We evaluated a new approach.\nNamely, we applied the \"color--concentration index\" diagram and machine\nlearning methods for the morphological classification of galaxies from the SDSS\nat z<0.1. With this aim, we visually identified morphological T-types of about\n1500 galaxies, which formed our training samples. Method 1. We plotted the\ndiagrams of color indices g-i and one of such parameters as the inverse\nconcentration index, absolute magnitude, de Vaucouleurs radius. We discovered\nthat these parameters may be used for galaxy classification into three classes:\nE -- elliptical and lenticular, S -- types Sa-Scd, and L -- types Sd-Sdm and\nirregular s. The accuracy is 98% for E, 88% for S, and 57% for L types. The\ncombinations of \"color indices g-i and inverse concentration index R50/R90' and\n\"color indices g-i and absolute magnitude M_r\" give the best result. We applied\nthis method to classify 317018 galaxies from SDSS DR5 (143263 E, 112 578 S,\n61177 L types). Method 2. We used a training sample classified visually into\ntwo classes: early E (E, S0, S0a) and late L (Sa to Irr) types. We checked\nNaive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifier. We used absolute\nmagnitudes, all the color indices and inverse concentration indexes as the\nattributes of galaxy. To define an accuracy of classifiers we applied the\n5-folds validation and found that Random Forest provides the highest accuracy\n(91% of galaxies were correctly classified (96% for E and 80% for L types)). We\ntested it to classify 60561 galaxies from SDSS DR9 with a good accuracy onto\ntwo classes (47% E and 53% L types of galaxies).\n", "  The erratically variable star RZ Piscium (RZ Psc) displays extreme optical\ndropout events and strikingly large excess infrared emission. To ascertain the\nevolutionary status of this intriguing star, we obtained observations of RZ Psc\nwith the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton), as\nwell as high-resolution optical spectroscopy with the Hamilton Echelle on the\nLick Shane 3 m telescope and with HIRES on the Keck I 10 m telescope. The\noptical spectroscopy data demonstrate that RZ Psc is a pre-main sequence star\nwith an effective temperature of 5600 $\\pm$ 75 K and log g of 4.35 $\\pm$ 0.10.\nThe ratio of X-ray to bolometric luminosity, log L$_{X}$/L$_{bol}$, lies in the\nrange -3.7 to -3.2, consistent with ratios typical of young, solar-mass stars,\nthereby providing strong support for the young star status of RZ Psc. The Li\nabsorption line strength of RZ Psc suggests an age in the range 30-50 Myr,\nwhich in turn implies that RZ Psc lies at a distance of $\\sim$170 pc. Adopting\nthis estimated distance, we find the Galactic space velocity of RZ Psc to be\nsimilar to the space velocities of stars in young moving groups near the Sun.\nOptical spectral features indicative of activity and/or circumstellar material\nare present in our spectra over multiple epochs, which provide evidence for the\npresence of a significant mass of circumstellar gas associated with RZ Psc. We\nsuggest that the destruction of one or more massive orbiting bodies has\nrecently occurred within 1 au of the star, and we are viewing the aftermath of\nsuch an event along the plane of the orbiting debris.\n", "  We study randomly initialized residual networks using mean field theory and\nthe theory of difference equations. Classical feedforward neural networks, such\nas those with tanh activations, exhibit exponential behavior on the average\nwhen propagating inputs forward or gradients backward. The exponential forward\ndynamics causes rapid collapsing of the input space geometry, while the\nexponential backward dynamics causes drastic vanishing or exploding gradients.\nWe show, in contrast, that by adding skip connections, the network will,\ndepending on the nonlinearity, adopt subexponential forward and backward\ndynamics, and in many cases in fact polynomial. The exponents of these\npolynomials are obtained through analytic methods and proved and verified\nempirically to be correct. In terms of the \"edge of chaos\" hypothesis, these\nsubexponential and polynomial laws allow residual networks to \"hover over the\nboundary between stability and chaos,\" thus preserving the geometry of the\ninput space and the gradient information flow. In our experiments, for each\nactivation function we study here, we initialize residual networks with\ndifferent hyperparameters and train them on MNIST. Remarkably, our\ninitialization time theory can accurately predict test time performance of\nthese networks, by tracking either the expected amount of gradient explosion or\nthe expected squared distance between the images of two input vectors.\nImportantly, we show, theoretically as well as empirically, that common\ninitializations such as the Xavier or the He schemes are not optimal for\nresidual networks, because the optimal initialization variances depend on the\ndepth. Finally, we have made mathematical contributions by deriving several new\nidentities for the kernels of powers of ReLU functions by relating them to the\nzeroth Bessel function of the second kind.\n", "  We revisit the fundamental problem of liquid-liquid dewetting and perform a\ndetailed comparison of theoretical predictions based on thin-film models with\nexperimental measurements obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM).\nSpecifically, we consider the dewetting of a liquid polystyrene (PS) layer from\na liquid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) layer, where the thicknesses and the\nviscosities of PS and PMMA layers are similar. The excellent agreement of\nexperiment and theory reveals that dewetting rates for such systems follow no\nuniversal power law, in contrast to dewetting scenarios on solid substrates.\nOur new energetic approach allows to assess the physical importance of\ndifferent contributions to the energy-dissipation mechanism, for which we\nanalyze the local flow fields and the local dissipation rates.\n", "  A van der Waals (vdW) density functional was implemented in the mixed basis\napproach previously developed for studying two dimensional systems, in which\nthe vdW interaction plays an important role. The basis functions here are taken\nto be the localized B-splines for the finite non-periodic dimension and plane\nwaves for the two periodic directions. This approach will significantly reduce\nthe size of the basis set, especially for large systems, and therefore is\ncomputationally efficient for the diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.\nWe applied the present algorithm to calculate the binding energy for the\ntwo-layer graphene case and the results are consistent with data reported\nearlier. We also found that, due to the relatively weak vdW interaction, the\ncharge density obtained self-consistently for the whole bi-layer graphene\nsystem is not significantly different from the simple addition of those for the\ntwo individual one-layer system, except when the interlayer separation is close\nenough that the strong electron-repulsion dominates. This finding suggests an\nefficient way to calculate the vdW interaction for large complex systems\ninvolving the Moire pattern configurations.\n", "  We consider an SU(2) gauge theory in six-dimensions. We show that there\nexists non-trivial structure of gauge vacua in compactified background M4xS2.\nIn this circumstances, there can exist a cosmic string, whose solution is\nrecently constructed by the present authors. We consider the stage of the\nformation of the strings, i.e., the phase transition of the gauge configuration\non the sphere in the `hot' early universe. We find that if SU(2)-doublet\nfermions are the dominant component of the radiation at high temperatures, the\nphase transition successively occurs after the spontaneous-compactification\ntransition. Otherwise, non-trivial vacuum with `monopole' configuration of the\nSU(2) gauge field never appears globally and strings must be formed at the same\ntime as the extra space is compactified.\n", "  The topological superfluids with Majorana zero modes have not yet been\nrealized in ultracold atoms with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Here we show that\nthese phases can be realized with an artificial gauge potential, which can be\nregarded as a site-dependent rotating Zeeman field. This potential breaks the\ninversion symmetry and plays the same role as Rashba spin-orbit coupling. In\nthe inverted bands, this model can open a proper parameter regime for\ntopological superfluids. Strikingly, we find that the interaction near the\nFermi surface is dominated by the dispersion scattering in the same band, thus\ncan realize topological phase with much weaker attractive interaction, as\ncompared with the model with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We find a large regime\nfor the gapped topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superfluids and\nunveil the phase diagram with mean-field theory, which should be credible in\nthe weak interaction regime. In regarding the negligible heating effect in\nrealizing this potential in alkaline and rare-earth atoms, our model has the\npotential to be the first system to realize the long-sought topological FFLO\nphase and the associated Majorana zero modes.\n", "  Inspired by the huge droplets attached on cypress tree leaf tips after rain,\nwe find that a bent fibre can hold significantly more water in the corner than\na horizontally placed fibre (typically up to three times or more). The maximum\nvolume of the liquid that can be trapped is remarkably affected by the bending\nangle of the fibre and surface tension of the liquid. We experimentally find\nthe optimal included angle ($\\sim {36}{^\\circ}$) that holds the most water.\nAnalytical and semi-empirical models are developed to explain these\ncounter-intuitive experimental observations and predict the optimal angle. The\ndata and models could be useful for designing microfluidic and fog harvesting\ndevices.\n", "  Dubrovin [Lecture Notes in Math., Vol. 1620, Springer, Berlin, 1996, 120-348]\nshowed that the Chazy XII equation $y'''- 2yy''+3y'^2 = K(6y'-y^2)^2$, $K \\in\n\\mathbb{C}$, is equivalent to a projective-invariant equation for an affine\nconnection on a one-dimensional complex manifold with projective structure. By\nexploiting this geometric connection it is shown that the Chazy XII solution,\nfor certain values of $K$, can be expressed as $y=a_1w_1+a_2w_2+a_3w_3$ where\n$w_i$ solve the generalized Darboux-Halphen system. This relationship holds\nonly for certain values of the coefficients $(a_1,a_2,a_3)$ and the\nDarboux-Halphen parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$, which are enumerated in\nTable 2. Consequently, the Chazy XII solution $y(z)$ is parametrized by a\nparticular class of Schwarz triangle functions $S(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma; z)$\nwhich are used to represent the solutions $w_i$ of the Darboux-Halphen system.\nThe paper only considers the case where $\\alpha+\\beta+\\gamma<1$. The associated\ntriangle functions are related among themselves via rational maps that are\nderived from the classical algebraic transformations of hypergeometric\nfunctions. The Chazy XII equation is also shown to be equivalent to a\nRamanujan-type differential system for a triple $(\\hat{P}, \\hat{Q},\\hat{R})$.\n", "  Based on the method of finding coronal magnetic field value radial profiles\nB(R) described in (Gopalswamy and Yashiro, 2011), and applied for the\ndirections close to the sky plane, we determined magnetic field value radial\ndistributions along the directions close to the Sun-Earth axis. For this\npurpose, by using the method in (Xue, Wang, and Dou, 2005), from the SOHO/LASCO\ndata, we found 3D characteristics for fast halo coronal mass ejections (HCMEs)\nand for the HCME-related shocks. Through these data, we managed to obtain the\nB(R) distributions as far as 43 solar radii from the Sun center, which is\napproximately by a factor of 2 farther, than those in (Gopalswamy and Yashiro,\n2011). We drew a conclusion that, to improve the accuracy of the\nGopalswamy-Yashiro method to find the coronal magnetic field, one should\ndevelop a technique to detect the CME sites that move in the slow and in the\nfast solar wind. We propose a technique to select the CMEs, whose central\n(paraxial) part moves, indeed, in the slow wind.\n", "  We study the origin of a CME-related shock within the LASCO C3 field-of-view\n(FOV). A shock originates, when a CME body velocity on its axis surpasses the\ntotal velocity $V_A + V_{SW}$, where $V_A$ is the Alfv\\'en velocity, $V_{SW}$\nis the slow solar wind velocity. The formed shock appears collisionless,\nbecause its front width is manifold less, than the free path of coronal plasma\ncharged particles. The Alfv\\'en velocity dependence on the distance was found\nby using characteristic values of the magnetic induction radial component and\nof the proton concentration in the Earth orbit, and by using the known\nregularities of the variations in these solar wind characteristics with\ndistance. A peculiarity of the analyzed CME is its formation at a relatively\nlarge height, and the CME body slow acceleration with distance. We arrived at a\nconclusion that the formed shock is a bow one relative to the CME body moving\nat a super Alfv\\'en velocity. At the same time, the shock formation involves a\nsteeping of the front edge of the coronal plasma disturbed region ahead of the\nCME body, which is characteristic of a piston shock.\n", "  Making use of the system of pulling a spherical intruder in static\nthree-dimensional granular media, we numerically study the scaling law for the\ndrag force $F_{\\rm drag}$ acting on the moving intruder under the influence of\nthe gravity. Suppose if the intruder of diameter $D$ immersed in a granular\nmedium consisting of grains of average diameter $d$ is located at a depth $h$\nand moves with a speed $V$, we find that $F_{\\rm drag}$ can be scaled as\n$(D+d)^{\\phi_\\mu} h^{\\alpha_\\mu}$ with two exponents $\\phi_\\mu$ and\n$\\alpha_\\mu$, which depend on the friction coefficient $\\mu$ and satisfy an\napproximate sum rule $\\phi_\\mu+\\alpha_\\mu\\approx 3$. This scaling law is valid\nfor the arbitrary Froude number (defined by $\\mathrm{Fr}={2\nV}\\sqrt{{2D}/{g}}\\big/(D+d)$), if $h$ is sufficiently deep. We also identify\nthe existence of three regimes (quasistatic, linear, and quadratic) at least\nfor frictional grains in the velocity dependence of drag force. The crossovers\ntake place at $\\mathrm{Fr}\\approx 1$ between the quasistatic to the linear\nregimes and at $\\mathrm{Fr}\\approx 5$ between the linear to the quadratic\nregimes. We also observe that Froude numbers at which these crossovers between\nthe regimes happen are independent of the depth $h$ and the diameter of the\nintruder $D$. We also report the numerical results on the average coordination\nnumber of the intruder and average contact angle as functions of intruder\nvelocity.\n", "  We study miscible Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) fingering instability in\ntwo-dimensional homogeneous porous media, in which the fluid density varies\nnon-monotonically as a function of the solute concentration such that the\nmaximum density lies in the interior of the domain, thus creating a stable and\nan unstable density gradients that evolve in time. With the help of linear\nstability analysis (LSA) as well as nonlinear simulations the effects of\ndensity gradients on the stability of RT fingers are investigated. As diffusion\nrelaxes the concentration gradient, a non-monotonic density profile emerges in\ntime. Our simple mathematical treatment addresses the importance of density\ngradients on the stability of miscible Rayleigh-Taylor fingering. In this\nprocess we identify that RT fingering instabilities are better understood\ncombining Rayleigh number (Ra) with the density gradients--hence defining a new\ndimensionless group, gradient Rayleigh number (Ra$_g$). We show that\ncontrolling the stable and unstable density gradients, miscible Rayleigh-Taylor\nfingers are controllable.\n", "  In NMR experiments, interaction of quantized radio-frequency (rf) field leads\nto entanglement of nuclear spin with the electromagnetic field. In an entangled\nstate, the nuclear spins are depolarized with no net magnetization, which\ncannot give a detectable signal in inductive detection. We show that when the\nelectromagnetic field is in coherent state, inductive detection is just true.\nWe develop the mathematics to study the evolution of a coherent rf-field with a\nsample of all polarized spins. We show that evolution can be solved in closed\nform as a separable state of rf-field and spin ensemble, where spin ensemble\nevolves according to Bloch equations in an rf field. We extend the analysis and\nresults to a spin ensemble with Boltzmann polarization. The rabi frequency and\ncoupling strength of spins to rf-field depends on number state of the rf-field.\nWe show that in interaction with a coherent rf-field, this variation in\ncoupling strength, introduces negligible error.\n", "  In analogy to transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, which have\nwide applications in photoelectricity, piezoelectricity and thermoelectricity,\nJanus MoSSe monolayer has been successfully synthesized by substituting the top\nSe atomic layer in $\\mathrm{MoSe_2}$ by S atoms. In this work, Janus monolayer\nZrSSe is proposed by ab initio calculations. For the electron part, the\ngeneralized gradient approximation (GGA) plus spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is used\nas exchange-correlation potential, while GGA for lattice part. Calculated\nresults show that the ZrSSe monolayer is dynamically and mechanically stable,\nwhich exhibits mechanical flexibility due to small Young's modulus. It is found\nthat ZrSSe monolayer is an indirect-gap semiconductors with band gap of 0.60\neV. The electronic and phonon transports of ZrSSe monolayer are investigated by\nsemiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. In n-type doping, the $ZT_e$ between\nZrSSe and $\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayers is almost the same due to similar\noutlines of conduction bands. The p-type $ZT_e$ of ZrSSe monolayer is lower\nthan that of $\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer, which is due to larger spin-orbit\nsplitting for ZrSSe than $\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer. The room-temperature sheet\nthermal conductance is 33.6 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ for ZrSSe monolayer, which is\nlower than 47.8 $\\mathrm{W K^{-1}}$ of $\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer. Compared to\n$\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer, the low sheet thermal conductance of ZrSSe\nmonolayer is mainly due to small group velocities and short phonon lifetimes of\nZA mode. Considering their $ZT_e$ and lattice thermal conductivities, the ZrSSe\nmonolayer may have better n-type thermoelectric performance than\n$\\mathrm{ZrS_2}$ monolayer. These results can stimulate further experimental\nworks to synthesize ZrSSe monolayer.\n", "  We present a rigorous finite element method to calculate circular dichroism\n(CD) in various systems consisting of nanostructures and oriented chiral\nmolecules with electric quadrupole transitions. The interaction between\noriented molecule materials, which are regarded as anisotropic chiral media,\nand metallic nanostructures has been investigated. Our results show that the\nplasmon-induced CD is sensitive to the orientations of the molecules. In many\ncases, the contribution of molecular electric quadrupole transitions to the\ntotal CD signal can play a key role. More interesting, we have demonstrated\nthat both the quadrupole- and dipole-based CD signals can be improved greatly\nby matching the phases for the electromagnetic fields and their gradients at\ndifferent regions around the nanostructures, which are occupied by the oriented\nchiral molecules. Different regions might produce CD of opposite sign. When\nintegrating over regions with only one side of the proposed nanostructure, we\nfind that the CD-peak may be nearly hundreds-fold over the case of integrating\nboth sides. We believe that these findings would be helpful for realizing\nultrasensitive probing of chiral information for oriented molecules by\nplasmon-based nanotechnology.\n", "  We report here chiroptical amplification effect occurring in the hybrid\nsystems consisting of chiral molecules and Si nanostructures. Under resonant\nexcitation of circularly polarized light, the hybrid systems show strong CD\ninduction signals at optical frequency, which arise from both the electric and\nmagnetic responses of the Si nanostructures. More interestingly, the induced CD\nsignals from Si-based dielectric nanoantennas are always larger than that from\nAu-based plasmonic counterparts. The related physical origin was disclosed.\nFurthermore, compared to the Au-based high-loss plasmonic nanoantenas, Si-based\nlow-loss structures would generate negligible photothermal effect, which makes\nSi nanoantennas become an optimized candidate to amplify molecular CD signals\nwith ultralow thermal damages. Our findings may provide a guideline for the\ndesign of novel chiral nanosensors for applications in the fields of\nbiomedicine and pharmaceutics.\n", "  Recently, there is a great interest in studying ultrasensitive detection and\ncharacterization of biomolecules using plasmonic particles, because they are of\nconsiderable importance in biomedical science and pharmaceutics. So far, all\nthe theories on plasmoninduced circular dichroism (CD) are based on the dipole\napproximation, the electric quadrupolar contribution is generally considered to\nbe relatively small and neglected. Here we demonstrate that the electric\nquadrupolar contribution not only cannot be ignored, but also plays a key role\nin many cases. Particularly, for the chiral medium that possesses preferential\nmolecular orientations and is located at the hotspot of plasmonic\nnanostructures, the plasmonic CD strength contributed by molecular electric\nquadrupoles (EQ) can be two orders of magnitude higher than that contributed by\nmolecular electric/magnetic dipoles. Unlike the case of dipole approximation,\nmolecular EQ associated plasmonic CD activity appears mainly at the plasmonic\nresonance absorptions that facilitate the optically enhanced near-field with\nsteep electric filed gradients, and is correlated with the boosted emission\nrate of a molecular EQ. Based on such physical understandings, we can design\nnanostructures to realize giant chiroptical effect using the EQ contribution\naccording to the requirements,2 which provide a new strategy for ultrasensitive\ndetection and quantification of molecular chirality.\n", "  An analytical theory for the surface-enhanced Raman optical activity (SEROA)\nwith the magnetic response of the substrate particle has been presented. We\nhave demonstrated that the SEROA signal is proportional to the magnetic\npolarizability of the substrate particle, which can be significantly enhanced\ndue to the existence of the magnetic response. At the same time, a large\ncircular intensity difference (CID) for the SEROA can also be achieved in the\npresence of the magnetic response. Taking Si nanoparticles as examples, we have\nfound that the CID enhanced by a Si nanoparticle is 10 times larger than that\nof Au. Furthermore, when the molecule is located in the hotspot of a Si dimer,\nCID can be 60 times larger. The phenomena originate from large magnetic fields\nconcentrated near the nanoparticle and boosted magnetic dipole emission of the\nmolecule. The symmetric breaking of the electric fields caused by the magnetic\ndipole response of the nanoparticle also plays an important role. Our findings\nprovide a new way to tailor theRaman optical activity by designing\nmetamaterials with the strong magnetic response.\n", "  A coupling of a dark photon $A'$ from a $U(1)_{A'}$ with the standard model\n(SM) particles can be generated through kinetic mixing represented by a\nparameter $\\epsilon$. A non-zero $\\epsilon$ also induces a mixing between $A'$\nand $Z$ if dark photon mass $m_{A'}$ is not zero. This mixing can be large when\n$m_{A'}$ is close to $m_Z$ even if the parameter $\\epsilon$ is small. Many\nefforts have been made to constrain the parameter $\\epsilon$ for a low dark\nphoton mass $m_{A'}$ compared with the $Z$ boson mass $m_Z$. We study the\nsearch for dark photon in $e^+e^- \\to \\gamma A' \\to \\gamma \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ for a\ndark photon mass $m_{A'}$ as large as kinematically allowed at future $e^+e^-$\ncolliders. For large $m_{A'}$, care should be taken to properly treat possible\nlarge mixing between $A'$ and $Z$. We obtain sensitivities to the parameter\n$\\epsilon$ for a wide range of dark photon mass at planed $e^+\\;e^-$ colliders,\nsuch as Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), International Linear\nCollider (ILC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). For the dark photon mass\n$20~\\text{GeV}\\lesssim m_{A^{\\prime}}\\lesssim 330~\\text{GeV}$, the $2\\sigma$\nexclusion limits on the mixing parameter are $\\epsilon\\lesssim\n10^{-3}-10^{-2}$. The CEPC with $\\sqrt{s}=240~\\text{GeV}$ and FCC-ee with\n$\\sqrt{s}=160~\\text{GeV}$ are more sensitive than the constraint from current\nLHCb measurement once the dark photon mass $m_{A^{\\prime}}\\gtrsim\n50~\\text{GeV}$. For $m_{A^{\\prime}}\\gtrsim 220~\\text{GeV}$, the sensitivity at\nthe FCC-ee with $\\sqrt{s}=350~\\text{GeV}$ and $1.5~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ is better\nthan that at the 13~TeV LHC with $300~\\text{fb}^{-1}$, while the sensitivity at\nthe CEPC with $\\sqrt{s}=240~\\text{GeV}$ and $5~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ can be even\nbetter than that at 13~TeV LHC with $3~\\text{ab}^{-1}$ for\n$m_{A^{\\prime}}\\gtrsim 180~\\text{GeV}$.\n", "  We report two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics simulations of\ncombined dislocation glide and climb leading to `power-law' creep in a model\naluminum crystal. The approach fully accounts for matter transport due to\nvacancy diffusion and its coupling with dislocation motion. The existence of\nquasi-equilibrium or jammed states under the applied creep stresses enables\nobservations of diffusion and climb over time scales relevant to power-law\ncreep. The predictions for the creep rates and stress exponents fall within\nexperimental ranges, indicating that the underlying physics is well captured.\n", "  The physics of heavy quarks becomes a very reach area of study thanks to an\nexcellent operation of hadron colliders and $B$-factories and exciting results\nfrom them. Experimental data obtained allows to get some information about the\nheavy hadron dynamics. In this case, the models for the heavy hadron\nwave-functions are required to do theoretical predictions for concrete\nprocesses under study. In many cases, the light-cone description is enough to\nobtain theoretical estimates for heavy hadron decays. A discussion of the\nwave-functions of the $B$-meson and heavy bottom baryons in terms of the\nlight-cone distribution amplitudes is given in this paper. Simple models for\nthe distribution amplitudes are presented and their scale dependence is\ndiscussed. Moments of the distribution amplitudes which are entering the\nbranching fractions of radiative, leptonic and semileptonic $B$-mesons decays\nare also briefly discussed.\n", "  Following the advent of electromagnetic metamaterials at the turn of the\ncentury, researchers working in other areas of wave physics have translated\nconcepts of electromagnetic metamaterials to acoustics, elastodynamics, as well\nas to heat, mass and light diffusion processes. In elastodynamics, seismic\nmetamaterials have emerged in the last decade for soft soils structured at the\nmeter scale, and have been tested thanks to full-scale experiments on holey\nsoils five years ago. Born in the soil, seismic metamaterials grow\nsimultaneously on the field of tuned-resonators buried in the soil, around\nbuilding's foundations or near the soil-structure's interface, and on the field\nof above-surface resonators. In this perspective article, we quickly recall\nsome research advances made in all these types of seismic metamaterials and we\nfurther dress an inventory of which material parameters can be achieved and\nwhich cannot, notably from the effective medium theory perspective. We finally\nenvision perspectives on future developments of large scale auxetic\nmetamaterials for building's foundations, forests of trees for seismic\nprotection and metamaterial-like transformed urbanism at the city scale.\n", "  We have carried out dilatant plasticity simulations to investigate the\nprocess of failure inside a shear band. The constitutive model accounts for\npossibly inhomogeneous flow within the band, void rotation and void elongation.\nWe found that the material in the band may soften with no increase in the void\nvolume fraction. For a given matrix hardening capacity, the rate of softening\nwas found to depend strongly on the ratio of shear band width to in-plane void\nspacing. The emergent softening led to complete loss of load bearing capacity\nthereby providing a physical mechanism of failure in shear bands. The mechanism\nis consistent with essential features of shear-fractured specimens in terms of\nsurface roughness, porosity and dimple shape.\n", "  We propose a highly efficient dynamic nuclear polarization technique that is\nrobust against field in-homogeneity. This technique is designed to enhance the\ndetection sensitivity in nano-MRI, where large Rabi field gradients are\nrequired. The proposed technique consists of an adiabatic half passage pulse\nfollowed by an adiabatic linear sweep of the electron Rabi frequency and can be\nconsidered as an adiabatic version of nuclear orientation via electron spin\nlocking (adiabatic-NOVEL). We analyze the spin dynamics of an electron-nuclear\nsystem that is under microwave irradiation at high static magnetic field and at\ncryogenic temperature. The result shows that an amplitude modulation of the\nmicrowave field makes adiabatic-NOVEL highly efficient and robust against both\nthe static and microwave field in-homogeneity.\n", "  Oxygen plasma is a widely used treatment to change the surface properties of\norganic layers. This treatment is particularly interesting to enable the\ndeposition from solution of\npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) on top of\nthe active layer of organic solar cells or photodetectors. However, oxygen is\nknown to be detrimental to organic devices, as the active layer is very\nsensitive to oxygen and photo-oxidation. In this study, we aim to determine the\nimpact of oxygen plasma surface treatment on the performance of organic\nphotodetectors (OPD). We show a significant reduction of the sensitivity as\nwell as a change in the shape of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the\ndevice. Using hole density and conductivity measurements, we demonstrate the\np-doping of the active layer induced by oxygen plasma. Admittance spectroscopy\nshows the formation of trap states approximately 350 meV above the highest\noccupied molecular orbital of the active organic semiconductor layer. Numerical\nsimulations are carried out to understand the impact of p-doping and traps on\nthe electrical characteristics and performance of the OPDs.\n", "  Functionalization of polyoxotungstates with organoarsonate co-ligands\nenabling surface decoration was explored for the triangular cluster\narchitectures of the composition\n[CoII9(H2O)6(OH)3(p-RC6H4AsVO3)2({\\alpha}-PV2WVI15O56)3]25-({Co9(P2W15)3}, R =\nH or NH2), isolated as Na25[Co9(OH)3(H2O)6(C6H5AsO3)2(P2W15O56)3]86H2O (Na-1)\nand Na25[Co9(OH)3(H2O)6(H2NC6H4AsO3)2(P2W15O56)3]86H2O (Na-2). The axially\noriented para-aminophenyl groups in 2 facilitate the formation of\nself-assembled monolayers on gold surfaces, and thus provide a viable molecular\nplatform for charge transport studies of magnetically functionalized\npolyoxometalates. The title systems were isolated and characterized in the\nsolid state and in aqueous solutions, and on metal surfaces. Using conducting\ntip atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), the energies of {Co9(P2W15)3} frontier\nmolecular orbitals in the surface-bound state were found to directly correlate\nwith cyclic voltammetry data in aqueous solution.\n", "  In our previous papers we described the structure of trajectories of the\nsymmetric Toda system on normal real forms of various Lie algebras and showed\nthat it was totally determined by the Hasse diagram of the Bruhat order on the\ncorresponding Weil group. This note deals with the simplest non-split real Lie\nalgebra, $\\mathfrak{so}(2,4)$. It turns out, that the phase diagram in this\ncase is also closely related with the Bruhat order of the relative Weyl group,\nbut a bit more information is necessary to describe the dimensions of the\ntrajectory spaces.\n", "  We report the absorption/transmission properties of thin copper films\nslightly below the percolation limit produced by laser ablation; these samples\nshow randomly positioned islands. Two types of films are grown: in the first\ntype, copper is deposited on glass, and it is shown that as the amount of\ndeposited copper approaches the percolation limit, the samples show enhanced\nlight transmission; in the second set of samples, made of TiO$_2$/Cu/TiO$_2$\nlayers, the presence of titanium oxide inhibits light transmission enhancement,\neven though the same amount of copper has been deposited compared to the\nsamples deposited on glass. We also present numerical calculations based on the\ndiscrete dipole method to simulate the optical behaviour of the copper films.\nThe enhanced light transmission of the samples presented in this work resembles\nthe Extraordinary Optical Transmission (EOT) observed in periodic metallic\nstructures. The similarities and differences between experiment and numerical\ncalculations and the possible use of these films as sensors are discussed.\n", "  We study the interaction of two scattering channels for a simple geometric\nmodel consisting in a double covering of the plane with two branch points,\nequipped with the Euclidean metric. We show that the scattering channels are\nopen in the sense of arXiv:1202.0333 and that this property is stable under\nsuitable perturbations of the metric.\n", "  The distribution of quantum coherence in multipartite systems is one of the\nbasic problems in the resource theory of coherence. While the usual coherence\nmeasures are defined on a single system and cannot capture the nonlocal\ncorrelation between subsystems, in order to deal with the distribution of\ncoherence it is crucial to quantify the coherence in bipartite systems\nproperly. Here, we introduce incoherent-quantum (IQ) coherence measures on\nbipartite systems, which can characterize the correlations between systems.\nAccording to the IQ coherence measures on bipartite systems, we find the\ndistribution of coherence of formation and assistance in bipartite systems: the\ntotal coherence of formation is lower bounded by the sum of coherence of\nformation in each subsystem and the entanglement of formation between the\nsubsystems, while the total coherence of assistance is upper bounded by the sum\nof coherence of assistance in each subsystem and the entanglement of assistance\nbetween subsystems. Besides, we also obtain the tradeoff relation between the\ncoherence cost and entanglement cost, distillable coherence and distillable\nentanglement in bipartite systems. Thus, the IQ coherence measures introduced\nhere truly capture the nonlocal correlation between subsystems and reveal the\ndistribution of coherence in bipartite systems.\n", "  The effect of Si on Fe-rich intermetallics formation and mechanical\nproperties of heat-treated squeeze cast Al-5.0Cu-0.6Mn-0.7Fe alloy was\ninvestigated. Our results show that increasing Si content promotes the\nformation of Al15(FeMn)3(SiCu)2 (${\\alpha}$-Fe), and varying the morphology of\nT (Al20Cu3Mn2) where the size decreases and the amount increases. The major\nreason is that Si promotes heterogeneous nucleation of the intermetallics\nleading to finer precipitates. Si addition significantly enhances ultimate\ntensile strength and yield strength of the alloys. The strengthening effect is\nmainly owing to the dispersoid strengthening by increasing volume fraction of T\nphase and less harmful ${\\alpha}$-Fe with a compact structure, which make the\ncracks more difficult to initiate and propagation during tensile test. The\nsqueeze cast Al-5.0Cu-0.6Mn-0.7Fe alloy with 1.1% Si shows significantly\nimproved mechanical properties than the alloy without Si addition, which has\ntensile strength of 386 MPa, yield strength of 280 MPa and elongation of 8.6%.\n", "  We demonstrate imaging over the visible band using a single planar\ndiffractive lens. This is enabled via multi-level diffractive optics that is\ndesigned to focus over a broad wavelength range, which we refer to as an\nachromatic diffractive lens (ADL). We designed, fabricated and characterized\ntwo ADLs with numerical apertures of 0.05 and 0.18. Diffraction-limited\nfocusing is demonstrated for the NA=0.05 lens with measured focusing efficiency\nof over 40% across the entire visible spectrum (450nm to 750nm). We\ncharacterized the lenses with a monochromatic and a color CMOS sensor, and\ndemonstrated video imaging under natural sunlight and other broadband\nillumination conditions. We use rigorous electromagnetic simulations to\nemphasize that ADLs can achieve high NA (0.9) and large operating bandwidth\n(300nm in the visible spectrum), a combination of metrics that have so far\neluded other flat-lens technologies such as metalenses. These planar\ndiffractive lenses can be cost-effectively manufactured over large areas and\nthereby, can enable the wide adoption of flat, low-cost lenses for a variety of\nimaging applications.\n", "  Identifying blast-wave shocks, which can arise during CME formation, is a\nmuch more complex problem. The difference from piston shocks is that a\nblast-wave shock originates from the explosions that frequently accompany CME\nformation, and further propagates freely without any CME piston effects. The\nbow shock of Earth is a piston shock. Behind the bow shock front there is a\nflow of the modified solar wind plasma: transition layer, which also carries\nthe modified magnetic field of solar wind. Velocity and density of plasma as\nwell as parameters of magnetic field of this current can be estimated if the\nform of the bow shock front and of magnetopause are considered to be known. In\nthis paper we assumed them to be paraboloids of rotation. In this paper we have\ndetermined potential distribution along magnetopause from the balance condition\nof substance coming into transition layer from the solar wind on one side and\nleaving through the gap between magnetosphere and the bow shock front and\nthrough magnetopause on another. To a first approximation this distribution\ndiffers from potential distribution at the BS front only in a constant\nmultiplier. We used the established potential distribution as a boundary\ncondition while solving the problem on potential distribution in the\nmagnetosphere. The first solution harmonic turned out to coincide in the form\nwith the boundary condition on magnetopause. We have constructed the full\nsolution for electric field in the magnetosphere having limited ourselves to\nthe first harmonic and corotation field. We have obtained necessary equations\nto model processes in the region of bow shock.\n", "  Piezoelectric crystals are widely used for acoustic wave resonators of\ndifferent functioning modes and types including BAW and SAW. It is well-known\nthat only some special orientations of crystals will exhibit desirable\nproperties such as mode couplings, thermal sensitivity, acceleration\nsensitivity, and others that are important in design and applications of\nresonators. With extensive studies on physical properties in last decades and\nincreasing industrial needs of novel products, it is necessary to comb the\nknown knowledge of quartz crystal material for novel orientations and better\nproducts as agendas in the industry. With known material properties like\nelastic, piezoelectric, dielectric, and thermal constants, we can establish the\nrelationships between vibrations and bias fields such as temperature to ensure\na resonator immunizing from excessive response to changes causing significant\ndegradation of resonator properties and performances. Since the theoretical\nframework of wave propagation in piezoelectric solids is known, we need to use\nthe existing data and results for the validation of current orientations in\nactual products. The agreement will give us needed confidence of the theory and\nanalytical procedures. Through rotations, we calculated physical properties as\nfunctions of angles and bias fields, enabling the calculation of resonator\nproperties for the identification of optimal cuts. Such a procedure can also be\napplied to similar crystals for a careful examination of possible orientations\nto maximize the potential use of materials in acoustic wave resonators.\n", "  Synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is used to\ndetermine the electronic structure of layered SnSe, which was recently turned\nout to be a potential thermoelectric material. We observe that the top of the\nvalence band consists of two nearly independent hole bands, whose tops differ\nby ~20 meV in energy, indicating the necessity of a multivalley model to\ndescribe the thermoelectric properties. The estimated effective masses are\nanisotropic, with in-plane values of 0.16-0.39 m$_0$ and an out-of-plane value\nof 0.71 m$_0$, where m$_0$ is the rest electron mass. Information of the\nelectronic structure is essential to further enhance the thermoelectric\nperformance of hole-doped SnSe.\n", "  This elementary survey article was prepared for a talk at the 2016\nSuperschool on Derived Categories and D-branes. The goal is to outline an\nidentification of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a\nCalabi-Yau threefold with the D-brane category in B-model topological string\ntheory. This was originally conjectured by Kontsevich. We begin by briefly\nintroducing topological closed string theory to acquaint the reader with the\nbasics of the non-linear sigma model. With the inclusion of open strings, we\nmust specify boundary conditions for the endpoints; these are what we call\nD-branes. After briefly summarizing the necessary homological algebra and sheaf\ncohomology, we argue that one should think of a D-brane as a complex of\ncoherent sheaves, and provide a physical motivation to identify complexes up to\nhomotopy. Finally, we argue that renormalization group (RG) flow on the\nworldsheet provides a physical realization of quasi-isomorphism. This\nidentifies a stable object in the derived category with a universality class of\nD-branes in physics. I aim for this article to be an approachable introduction\nto the subject for both mathematicians and physicists. As such, it is far from\na complete account.\n", "  We use the machine learning techniques, for the first time, to study the\nbackground evolution of the universe in light of 30 cosmic chronometers. From 7\nmachine learning algorithms, using the principle of mean squared error\nminimization on testing set, we find that Bayesian ridge regression is the\noptimal method to extract the information from cosmic chronometers. By use of a\npower-law polynomial expansion, we obtain the first Hubble constant estimation\n$H_0=65.95^{+6.98}_{-6.36}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from machine learning. From\nthe view of machine learning, we may rule out a large number of cosmological\nmodels, the number of physical parameters of which containing $H_0$ is larger\nthan 3. Very importantly and interestingly, we find that the parameter spaces\nof 3 specific cosmological models can all be clearly compressed by considering\nboth their explanation and generalization abilities.\n", "  We revisit the enumeration problems of random discrete surfaces (RDS) based\non solutions of the discrete equations derived from the matrix models. For RDS\nmade of squares, the recursive coefficients of orthogonal polynomials\nassociated with the quartic matrix model satisfy the discrete type I Painlev\\'e\nequation. Through the use of generating function techniques, we show that the\nplanar contribution to the free energy is controlled by the Catalan numbers. We\nalso develop a new systematic scheme of calculating higher-genus contributions\nto the topological expansion of the free energy of matrix models. It is\nimportant that our exact solutions are valid for finite-$N$ matrix models and\nno continuous limits are taken within our approach. To show the advantages of\nour approach, we provide new results of the topological expansion of the free\nenergy for the finite-$N$ cubic matrix model.\n", "  The exactly analytical solutions for the dynamics of the dissipative\nthree-level V-type and $\\Lambda$-type atomic systems in the vacuum Lorentzian\nenvironments are presented. Quantum interference phenomenon between the two\ntransitions in V-type atomic system is studied and the intuitive interference\nconditions are derived. For the dissipative $\\Lambda$-type atomic system, we\ndemonstrate that the similar quantum interference phenomenon does not exist.\nFinally, we study the dynamical evolution of quantum Fisher information,\nquantum entanglement and quantum coherence for the V-type atomic system. We\nfind that quantum interference plays a positive role to the protection of\nquantum entanglement and quantum coherence. The difference between the two\ntypical measures of the quantum coherence is also demonstrated in the\nconsidered systems.\n", "  Quantum transducers can transfer quantum information between different\nsystems. Microwave-optical photon conversion is important for future quantum\nnetworks to interconnect remote superconducting quantum computers with optical\nfibers. Here we propose a high-speed quantum transducer based on a\nsingle-photon emitter in an atomically thin membrane resonator that can couple\nsingle microwave photons to single optical photons. The 2D resonator will be a\nfreestanding van der Waals heterostructure (may consist of graphene, hexagonal\nboron nitride, or other 2D materials) that hosts a quantum emitter. The\nmechanical vibration (phonon) of the 2D resonator interacts with optical\nphotons by shifting the optical transition frequency of the single-photon\nemitter with strain or the Stark effect. The mechanical vibration couples to\nmicrowave photons by shifting the resonant frequency of a LC circuit that\nincludes the membrane. Thanks to the small mass of the 2D resonator, both the\nsingle-photon optomechanical coupling strength and the electromechanical\ncoupling strength can be about 100 MHz. This provides a way for high-speed\nquantum state transfer between a microwave photon, a phonon, and an optical\nphoton.\n", "  2H MoS2 has been intensively studied because of layer-dependent electronic\nstructures and novel physical properties. Though the metastable 1T MoS2 with\nthe [MoS6] octahedron was observed from the microscopic area, the true crystal\nstructure of 1T phase has not been determined strictly. Moreover, the true\nphysical properties have not been demonstrated from experiments due to the\nchallenge for the preparation of pure 1T MoS2 crystals. Here, we successfully\nsynthesized the 1T MoS2 single crystals and re-determined the crystal structure\nof 1T MoS2 from single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 1T MoS2 crystalizes in space\ngroup P-3m1 with a cell of a = b = 3.190(3) {\\AA} and c = 5.945(6) {\\AA}. The\nindividual MoS2 layer consists of MoS6 octahedron sharing edge with each other.\nMore surprisingly, the bulk 1T MoS2 crystals undergo a superconducting\ntransition of Tc = 4 K, which is the first observation of superconductivity in\npure 1T MoS2 phase.\n", "  Notes on holographic renormalization as a tool for UV analysis and derivation\nof the two-point Ward identity encoding symmetry breaking. Goldstone theorem is\nreviewed, discussing in particular the modifications required by its extension\nto non-relativistic field theories. The Ward identity encoding both spontaneous\nand explicit breaking are derived by general principles. Holographic\nrenormalization is presented in a quite operational fashion. The derivation of\nthe Ward identity in holography is illustrated by an example.\n", "  Accurate knowledge of the spectral transmission profile of a Lyot filter is\nimportant, in particular in comparing observations with simulated data. The\npaper summarizes available facts about the transmission profile of the DOT\nH$\\alpha$ Lyot filter pointing to a discrepancy between sidelobe-free\nGaussian-like profile measured spectroscopically and signatures of possible\nleakage of parasitic continuum light in DOT H$\\alpha$ images. We compute\nwing-to-center intensity ratios resulting from convolutions of Gaussian and\nsquare of the sinc function with the H$\\alpha$ atlas profile and compare them\nwith the ratios derived from observations of the quiet Sun chromosphere at disk\ncenter. We interpret discrepancies between the anticipated and observed ratios\nand the sharp limb visible in the DOT H$\\alpha$ image as an indication of\npossible leakage of parasitic continuum light. A method suggested here can be\napplied also to indirect testing of transmission profiles of other Lyot\nfilters. We suggest two theoretical transmission profiles of the DOT H$\\alpha$\nLyot filter which should be considered as the best available approximations.\nConclusive answer can only be given by spectroscopic re-measurement of the\nfilter.\n", "  We analyze the observations of a quiescent prominence acquired by the\nTelescope Heliographique pour l'Etude du Magnetisme et des Instabilites\nSolaires (THEMIS) in the He I 5876 A (He I D3) multiplet aiming to measure the\nspectral characteristics of the He I D3 profiles and to find for them an\nadequate fitting model. The component characteristics of the He I D3 Stokes I\nprofiles are measured by the fitting system approximating them with a double\nGaussian. This model yields an He I D3 component peak intensity ratio of\n$5.5\\pm0.4$, which differs from the value of 8 expected in the optically thin\nlimit. Most of the measured Doppler velocities lie in the interval $\\pm5$ km/s,\nwith a standard deviation of $\\pm1.7$ km/s around the peak value of 0.4 km/s.\nThe wide distribution of the full-width at half maximum has two maxima at 0.25\nA and 0.30 A for the He I D3 blue component and two maxima at 0.22 A and 0.31 A\nfor the red component. The width ratio of the components is $1.04\\pm0.18$. We\nshow that the double-Gaussian model systematically underestimates the blue wing\nintensities. To solve this problem, we invoke a two-temperature multi-Gaussian\nmodel, consisting of two double-Gaussians, which provides a better\nrepresentation of He I D3 that is free of the wing intensity deficit. This\nmodel suggests temperatures of 11.5 kK and 91 kK, respectively, for the cool\nand the hot component of the target prominence. The cool and hot components of\na typical He I D3 profile have component peak intensity ratios of 6.6 and 8,\nimplying a prominence geometrical width of 17 Mm and an optical thickness of\n0.3 for the cool component, while the optical thickness of the hot component is\nnegligible. These prominence parameters seem to be realistic, suggesting the\nphysical adequacy of the multi-Gaussian model with important implications for\ninterpreting He I D3 spectropolarimetry by current inversion codes.\n", "  Perfect state transfer (PST) has great significance due to its applications\nin quantum information processing and quantum computation. In this paper we\npresent a characterization on connected simple Cayley graph $\\Gamma={\\rm\nCay}(G,S)$ having PST. We show that many previous results on periodicity and\nexistence of PST of circulant graphs (where the underlying group $G$ is cyclic)\nand cubelike graphs ($G=(\\mathbb{F}_2^n,+)$) can be derived or generalized to\narbitrary abelian case in unified and more simple ways from our\ncharacterization. We also get several new results including answers on some\nproblems raised before.\n", "  The spectrum of excited baryons in the $N$ = 2 band is reanalys9 pagesed in\nthe $1/N_c$ expansion method, with emphasis on hyperons. Predictions are made\nfor the classification of these excited baryons into SU(3) singlets, octets and\ndecuplets.\n", "  We perform the energy spectra calculating for the $S$-wave $\\bar{Q}Q\\bar{q}q$\n(where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$) system within two constituent quark models. The\nbound states of $B^*\\bar{B}^*$ with $I(J^{PC})=1(0^{++}),~1(1^{+-}),~0(2^{++})$\nand $B\\bar{B}^*$ with isospin $I=1$, or $0$ are obtained in\ncolor-singlet-singlet channel. If considering the coupling of color channels,\napart from the deep bound states appear in $[b\\bar{q}]^{(*)}[q\\bar{b}]^{(*)}$\nscenario, a bound state $[c\\bar{q}]^*[q\\bar{c}]^*$ with $I(J^{PC})=1(0^{++})$\nis also formed. The $B\\bar{B}^*$ and the $B^*\\bar{B}^*$ with quantum number\n$1(1^{+-})$ are well candidates for $Z_b^{\\pm}(10610)$ and $Z_b^{\\pm}(10650)$\nreported by Belle collaboration respectively, while the $B\\bar{B}^*$ with\nisospin $0$ can be interpret as a candidate for $Z_b^{0}(10610)$. A bound state\n$[c\\bar{q}]^*[q\\bar{c}]^*$ with $I(J^{PC})=1(0^{++})$ is comparable with\n$Z_c^{+}(4025)$ announced by BES.\n", "  Far-field polarization vortices were recently found on singlet bands in the\nmomentum-space of two-dimensional photonic lattices, also known as the dark\nstates and bound states in continuum. Here, we theoretically proposed and\nexperimentally verified the existence of the polarization vortices at the\ndegenerate points of photonic dispersions, whose vortex cores can be radiative\nbright states. Half-charged vortices were generated from the Dirac points of\n{\\pi} Berry phase and integer-charged vortices were generated from a quadratic\ndegeneracy. Using a home-made polarization-resolved momentum-space imaging\nspectroscopy, we observed the complete evolution of the splitting from one\nquadratic point to a pair of Dirac cones by tracking the winding of the\npolarization vectors and the full spectrum of iso-frequency contours.\n", "  Here we find the spectral curves, corresponding to the known rational or\nquasi-rational solutions of AKNS hierarchy equations, ultimately connected with\nthe modeling of the rogue waves events in the optical waveguides and in\nhydrodynamics. We also determine spectral curves for the multi-phase\ntrigonometric, hyperbolic and elliptic solutions for the same hierarchy. It\nseams that the nature of the related spectral curves was not sufficiently\ndiscussed in existing literature.\n", "  The classical deflection function is a valuable computational tool to\ninvestigate reaction mechanisms. It provides, at a glance, detailed information\nabout how the reaction is affected by changes in reactant properties (impact\nparameter) and products properties (scattering angle), and, more importantly,\nit also shows how they are correlated. It is also useful to predict the\npresence of quantum phenomena such as interferences. However, rigorously\nspeaking, there is not a quantum analogue as the differential cross section\ndepends on the coherences between the different values of $J$ caused by the\ncross terms in the expansion of partial waves. Therefore, the classical\ndeflection function has a limited use whenever quantum effects become\nimportant. In this article, we present a method to calculate a quantum\ndeflection function that can shed light onto reaction mechanism using just\nquantum mechanical results. Our results show that there is a very good\nagreement between the quantum and classical deflection function as long as\nquantum effects are not all relevant. When this is not the case, it will be\nalso shown that the quantum deflection function is most useful to observe the\nextent of quantum effects such as interferences. The present results are\ncompared with other proposed quantum deflection functions, and the advantages\nand disadvantages of the different formulations will be discussed.\n", "  This paper presents a new generator of chaotic bit sequences with mixed-mode\n(continuous and discrete) inputs. The generator has an improved level of\nchaotic properties in comparison with the existing single source (input)\ndigital chaotic bit generators. The 0-1 test is used to show the improved\nchaotic behavior of our generator having a chaotic continuous input (Chua,\nR\\\"{o}ssler or Lorenz system) intermingled with a discrete input (logistic,\nTinkerbell or Henon map) with various parameters. The obtained sequences of\nchaotic bits show some features of random processes with increased entropy\nlevels, even in the cases of small numbers of bit representations. The\nproperties of the new generator and its binary sequences compare well with\nthose obtained from a truly random binary reference quantum generator, as\nevidenced by the results of the $ent$ tests.\n", "  We present the analysis of the measured orientations of 30 churches of the\nisland of Lanzarote, in the Canarian archipelago, built prior to 1810, as well\nas a few buildings of later times, which represent a nearly complete sample of\nall the island's Christian sanctuaries. Our study indicates that a definite\norientation pattern was followed on the island but, unlike what is often found\nin most of the Christian world, it has two interpretations. On the one hand,\nthe representative orientation to the east (or west) is present. However, the\nsample has also a marked orientation towards north-northeast which is, as far\nas we know, a pattern exclusive to Lanzarote. We discuss the reasons for this\npattern and suggest that one possible explanation could be a rather prosaic\none, namely, that sometimes needs of everyday life are more relevant than --and\npush individuals to make decisions at odds with-- religious beliefs. This work\nis the beginning of the first systematic archaeoastronomical study ever\nconducted with old churches in the Canary Islands [abridged].\n", "  HST and ground-based [OII} and [NII] images obtained from 1996 to 1999 reveal\nthe existence of a ionised optical nebula around the symbiotic binary CH Cyg\nextending out to 5000 A.U. from the central stars. The observed velocity range\nof the nebula, derived from long-slit echelle spectra, is of 130 km/s. In spite\nof its complex appearence, the velocity data show that the basic morphology of\nthe inner regions of the optical nebula is that of a bipolar (or conical)\noutflow extending nearly along the plane of the sky out to some 2000 A.U. from\nthe centre. Even if the extension of this bipolar outflow and its position\nangle are consistent with those of the radio jet produced in 1984 (extrapolated\nto the time of our optical imagery), no obvious counterpart is visible of the\noriginal, dense radio bullets ejected by the system. We speculate that the\noptical bipolar outflow might be the remannt of the interaction of the bullets\nwith a relatively dense circumstellar medium.\n", "  We measure variations in orientation of fourteen dynamic fibrils as a\nfunction of time in a small isolated plage and nearby network using a 10-min\ntime sequence of H-alpha filtergrams obtained by the Dutch Open Telescope. We\nfound motions with average angular velocities of the order of 1 deg/min\nsuggesting systematic turning from one limit position to another, particularly\napparent in the case of fibrils with lifetimes of a few minutes. Shorter\nfibrils tend to turn faster than longer ones, which we interpret as due to\nvortex flows in the underlying granulation that twist magnetic fields.\n", "  We studied the phase behavior of charged and sterically stabilized colloids\nusing confocal microscopy in a less polar solvent (dielectric constant 5.4).\nUpon increasing the colloid volume fraction we found a transition from a fluid\nto a body centered cubic crystal at 0.0415+/-0.0005, followed by re-entrant\nmelting at 0.1165+/-0.0015. A second crystal of different symmetry, random\nhexagonal close-packed, was formed at a volume fraction around 0.5, similar to\nthat of hard spheres. We attribute the intriguing phase behavior to particle\ninteractions that depend strongly on volume fraction, mainly due to changes in\nthe colloid charge. In this low polarity system the colloids acquire charge\nthrough ion adsorption. The low ionic strength leads to fewer ions per colloid\nat elevated volume fractions and consequently a density-dependent colloid\ncharge.\n", "  In this paper we establish a generally and globally valid coordinate system\nin curved space-time with the simultaneous hypersurface orthogonal to the time\ncoordinate. The time coordinate can be preseted according to practical evolving\nprocess and keep synchronous with the evolution of the realistic world. In this\ncoordinate system, it is convenient to express the physical laws and to\ncalculate physical variables with clear geometrical meaning. We call it\n\"natural coordinate system\". The constructing method for the natural coordinate\nsystem is concretely provided, and its physical and geometrical meanings are\ndiscussed in detail. In NCS we make classical approximation of spinor equation\nto get Newtonian mechanics, and then make weak field approximation of\nEinstein's equation and low speed approximation of particles moving in the\nspace-time. From the analysis and examples we find it is a nice coordinate\nsystem to describe the realistic curved space-time, and is helpful to\nunderstand the nature of space-time.\n", "  In this paper, we strictly establish classical concepts and relations\naccording to a Dirac equation with scalar, vector and nonlinear potentials. To\ncalculate classical parameters for moving spinor, the local Lorentz\ntransformations for parameters are derived. The calculation shows that\ndifferent kinds of potentials result in different energy-speed relations, and\nthe energy-speed relations for these potentials are derived in detail. The\nusual mass-energy relation $E = mc^2$ holds only for the linear spinor. The\nenergy-speed relations can be used as fingerprints to identify the interactive\npotentials of a particle by elaborated experiments. The analysis and results of\nthis paper can also provide some natural explanations for the foundation of\nquantum mechanics, and clarify some long-standing puzzles in the theory.\n"]}
