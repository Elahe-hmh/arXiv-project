In contrast, we demonstrate both experimentally\nand theoretically the elimination of spin-exchange relaxation of high magnetic\nmoments (birefringence) in alkali vapor. This elimination originates from the\nnonlinear part of the spin-exchange interaction, as a scattering process of the\nLarmor magnetic moment. We find counter-intuitively that the threshold magnetic\nfield is the same as in the Larmor case, despite the fact that the precession\nfrequency is twice as large.\n", "  While the characteristics of the driven translocation for asymptotically long\npolymers are well understood, this is not the case for finite-sized polymers,\nwhich are relevant for real-world experiments and simulation studies. Most\nnotably, the behavior of the exponent $\\alpha$, which describes the scaling of\nthe translocation time with polymer length, when the driving force $f_p$ in the\npore is changed, is under debate. By Langevin dynamics simulations of regular\nand modified translocation models using the freely-jointed-chain polymer model\nwe find that a previously reported incomplete model, where the {\\it trans} side\nand fluctuations were excluded, gives rise to characteristics that are in stark\ncontradiction with those of the complete model, for which $\\alpha$ increases\nwith $f_p$. Our results suggest that contribution due to fluctuations is\nimportant. We construct a minimal model where dynamics is completely excluded\nto show that close alignment with a full translocation model can be achieved.\nOur findings set very stringent requirements for a minimal model that is\nsupposed to describe the driven polymer translocation correctly.\n", "  We introduce a new topological descriptor of a network called the density\ndecomposition which is a partition of the nodes of a network into regions of\nuniform density. The decomposition we define is unique in the sense that a\ngiven network has exactly one density decomposition. The number of nodes in\neach partition defines a density distribution which we find is measurably\nsimilar to the degree distribution of given real networks (social, internet,\netc.) and measurably dissimilar in synthetic networks (preferential attachment,\nsmall world, etc.).\n", "  Fermion localization in a braneworld model in presence of dilaton coupled\nhigher curvature Gauss-Bonnet bulk gravity is discussed. It is shown that the\nlowest mode of left handed fermions can be naturally localized on the visible\nbrane due to the dilaton coupled higher curvature term without the necessity of\nany external localizing bulk field.\n", "  The Ultra-Fast Flash Observatory pathfinder (UFFO-p) is a new space mission\ndedicated to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and rapidly follow their afterglows\nin order to provide early optical/ultraviolet measurements. A GRB location is\ndetermined in a few seconds by the UFFO Burst Alert & Trigger telescope (UBAT)\nemploying the coded mask imaging technique and the detector combination of\nYttrium Oxyorthosilicate (YSO) scintillating crystals and multi-anode\nphotomultiplier tubes. The results of the laboratory tests of UBAT's\nfunctionality and performance are described in this article. The detector\nsetting, the pixel-to-pixel response to X-rays of different energies, the\nimaging capability for <50 keV X-rays, the localization accuracy measurements,\nand the combined test with the Block for X-ray and Gamma-Radiation Detection\n(BDRG) scintillator detector to check the efficiency of UBAT are all described.\nThe UBAT instrument has been assembled and integrated with other equipment on\nUFFO-p and should be launched on board the Lomonosov satellite in late-2015.\n", "  Published articles concerning the intermediate (third) subgroup of GRBs are\nsurveyed. From a statistical perspective this subgroup may exist, however its\nsignificance depends on which data set is used. Its astrophysical meaning is\nunclear because the occurrence of this subgroup can also be an artificial\nselection effect. Hence, GRBs from this subgroup need not be given by a\nphysically different phenomenon. The aim of this contribution is to search for\nthe answer to the question in the title.\n", "  The non-relativistic covariant framework for fields is extended to\ninvestigate fields and fluids on scale covariant curved backgrounds. The scale\ncovariant Newton-Cartan background is constructed using the localization of\nspacetime symmetries of non-relativistic fields in flat space. Following this,\nwe provide a Weyl covariant formalism which can be used to study scale\ninvariant fluids. By considering ideal fluids as an example, we describe its\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties and explicitly demonstrate that it\nsatisfies the local second law of thermodynamics. As a further application, we\nconsider the low energy description of Hall fluids. Specifically, we find that\nthe gauge fields for scale transformations lead to corrections of the Wen-Zee\nand Berry phase terms contained in the effective action.\n", "  In this paper we compute the corrections to the black-body force (BBF)\npotential due to spacetime geometry and topology. This recently discovered\nattractive force on neutral atoms is caused by the thermal radiation emitted\nfrom black bodies and here we investigate it in relativistic gravitational\nsystems with spherical and cylindrical symmetries. For some astrophysical\nobjects we find that the corrected black-body potential is greater than the\nflat case, showing that this kind of correction can be quite relevant when\ncurved spaces are considered. Then we consider four cases: The Schwarzschild\nspacetime, the global monopole, the non-relativistic infinity cylinder and the\nstatic cosmic string. For the spherically symmetric case of a massive body, we\nfind that two corrections appear: One due to the gravitational modification of\nthe temperature and the other due to the modification of the solid angle\nsubtended by the atom. We apply the found results to a typical neutron star and\nto the Sun. For the global monopole, the modification in the black-body\npotential is of topological nature and it is due to the central solid angle\ndeficit that occurs in the spacetime generated by that object. In the\ncylindrical case, which is locally flat, no gravitational correction to the\ntemperature exists, as in the global monopole case. However, we find the\ncurious fact that the BBF depends on the topology of the spacetime through the\nmodification of the azimuthal angle and therefore of the solid angle. For the\nstatic cosmic string we find that the force is null for the zero thickness\ncase.\n", "  Polymer translocation through a nanometer-scale pore assisted by chaperones\nbinding to the polymer is a process encountered in vivo for proteins. Studying\nthe relevant models by computer simulations is computationally demanding.\nAccordingly, previous studies are either for stiff polymers in three dimensions\nor flexible polymers in two dimensions. Here, we study chaperone-assisted\ntranslocation of flexible polymers in three dimensions using Langevin dynamics.\nWe show that differences in binding mechanisms, more specifically, whether a\nchaperone can bind to a single or multiple sites on the polymer, lead to\nsubstantial differences in translocation dynamics in three dimensions. We show\nthat the single-binding mode leads to dynamics that is very much like that in\nthe constant-force driven translocation and accordingly mainly determined by\ntension propagation on the cis side. We obtain $\\beta \\approx 1.26$ for the\nexponent for the scaling of the translocation time with polymer length. This\nfairly low value can be explained by the additional friction due to binding\nparticles. The multiple-site binding leads to translocation whose dynamics is\nmainly determined by the trans side. For this process we obtain $\\beta \\approx\n1.36$. This value can be explained by our derivation of $\\beta = 4/3$ for\nconstant-bias translocation, where translocated polymer segments form a globule\non the trans side. Our results pave the way for understanding and utilizing\nchaperone-assisted translocation where variations in microscopic details lead\nto rich variations in the emerging dynamics.\n", "  The atom - electromagnetic field interaction is studied in the Dicke model,\nwherein a single field mode is interacting with a collection of two level atoms\nat thermal equilibrium. It is found that in the superradiant phase of the\nsystem, wherein the Bose-Einstein condensation of photons takes place, the\nnotion of photon as an elementary electromagnetic excitation ceases to exist.\nThe phase and intensity excitations of the condensate are found to be the true\nexcitations of electromagnetic field. It is found that in this phase, the atom\ninteracts with these excitations in a distinct coherent transition process,\napart from the known stimulated emission/absorption and spontaneous emission\nprocesses. In the coherent transition it is found that while the atomic state\nchanges in course of the transition process, the state of electromagnetic field\nremains unaffected. It is found that the transition probability of such\ncoherent transition process is macroscopically large compared to other\nstimulated emission/absorption and spontaneous emission processes.\n", "  We give an introduction to the Mathematica packages \"MasterPVA\" and\n\"MasterPVAmulti used to compute lambda-brackets in Poisson vertex algebras,\nwhich play an important role in the theory of infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian\nsystems. As an application, we give an introduction to the Mathematica package\n\"WAlg\" aimed to compute the lambda-brackets among the generators of classical\naffine W-algebras. The use of these packages is shown by providing some\nexplicit examples.\n", "  Context. Most popular algorithms in use to remove the effects of a\ntelescope's point spread function (PSF) in radio astronomy are variants of the\nCLEAN algorithm. Most of these algorithms model the sky brightness using the\ndelta-function basis, which results in undesired artefacts when used on image\nextended emission. The adaptive scale pixel decomposition (Asp-Clean) algorithm\nmodels the sky brightness on a scale-sensitive basis and thus gives a\nsignificantly better imaging performance when imaging fields that contain both\nresolved and unresolved emission.\n  Aims. However, the runtime cost of Asp-Clean is higher than that of\nscale-insensitive algorithms. In this paper, we identify the most expensive\nstep in the original Asp-Clean algorithm and present an efficient\nimplementation of it, which significantly reduces the computational cost while\nkeeping the imaging performance comparable to the original algorithm. The PSF\nsidelobe levels of modern wide-band telescopes are significantly reduced,\nallowing us to make approximations to reduce the computing cost, which in turn\nallows for the deconvolution of larger images on reasonable timescales.\n  Methods. As in the original algorithm, scales in the image are estimated\nthrough function fitting. Here we introduce an analytical method to model\nextended emission, and a modified method for estimating the initial values used\nfor the fitting procedure, which ultimately leads to a lower computational\ncost.\n  Results.The new implementation was tested with simulated EVLA data and the\nimaging performance compared well with the original Asp-Clean algorithm. Tests\nshow that the current algorithm can recover features at different scales with\nlower computational cost.\n", "  The description of the molecular solid phase of O$_2$, especially its\nground-state antiferromagnetic insulating phase, is known to be quite\nunsatisfactory within the conventional local and semilocal density functional\napproximations used in the Kohn-Sham formalism of density functional theory.\nThe recently-developed van der Waals functionals that take into account\nnonlocal correlations have also shown subpar performance in this regard. The\ndifficulty lies in the subtle balance between the van der Waals interactions\nand the exchange coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic\nmolecule pairs in the molecular crystal. Here, we report that the DFT$+U$\napproach used in combination with the vdW-DF functional performs surprisingly\nwell in this regard, and discuss the reasoning behind this behavior. We also\napply this approach to study the recently-reported magnetic field-induced\n$\\theta$ phase of solid O$_2$.\n", "  Here we derive the linear constitutive equations governing the emergent\nelastic behavior of skX under applied mechanical forces as well as other\neffective fields. The linear coefficients appearing in the equations are\nexpressed analytically in terms of the thermodynamic parameters describing the\nmagnetoelastic interaction of the underlying chiral magnet. Through the\ndeduction of equations, we clarify that two types of coupled deformation may\noccur for skX, that is the internal deformation, described by variation of the\nFourier magnitudes, and the lattice deformation, described by the emergent\nelastic strains. We also find that besides mechanical loads, bias magnetic\nfield, spatially periodic magnetic field, spatially periodic mechanical loads,\nand emergent stresses can all lead to deformation of the skX. When homogeneous\nstresses are applied only, the emergent elastic strains are linearly related to\nthe elastic strains through the emergent strain ratio matrix {\\lambda}. We\ncalculate {\\lambda} for the skX in bulk MnSi and discuss its variation with the\ntemperature and magnetic field. In particular, we find that all components of\n{\\lambda} are sensitive to variation of magnetic field b, such that they change\nsign as b increases. Moreover, as b approaches the critical magnetic field of\nthe skX-ferromagnetic phase transition, the dominant components of {\\lambda}\ndiverges. The constitutive equations are of fundamental significance in\nemergent elasticity, a new area studying the variation of internal forces and\ndeformation of emergent crystals and their relation when exposed to effective\nexternal fields.\n", "  The control of a ferromagnet's magnetization via only electric currents\nrequires the efficient generation of current-driven spin-torques. In magnetic\nstructures based on topological insulators (TIs) current-induced spin-orbit\ntorques can be generated. Here we show that the addition of graphene, or\nbilayer graphene, to a TI-based magnetic structure greatly enhances the\ncurrent-induced spin density accumulation and significantly reduces the amount\nof power dissipated. We find that this enhancement can be as high as a factor\nof 100, giving rise to a giant Edelstein effect. Such a large enhancement is\ndue to the high mobility of graphene (bilayer graphene) and to the fact that\nthe graphene (bilayer graphene) sheet very effectively screens charge\nimpurities, the dominant source of disorder in topological insulators. Our\nresults show that the integration of graphene in spintronics devices can\ngreatly enhance their performance and functionalities.\n", "  In the framework of model with Lorentz violation (LV) we discuss a physical\nobservables for $q\\bar{q}$ pair production at lepton-lepton colliders and\ndescribe the experimental signal to be detected. We obtain a conservative\nlimits on Lorentz-violating dimensionless coupling for quark sector from LEP\ndata. We also make a phenomenological prediction for LV model at the future\nlepton collider.\n", "  We study the effects of high magnetic fields on the structure and on the\ngeometry of the crust in neutron stars. We find that the crust geometry is\nsubstantially modified by the magnetic field inside the star. We build\nstationary and axis-symmetric magnetized stellar models by using well-known\nequations of state to describe the neutron star crust, namely the Skyrme model\n(Sky) for the inner crust and the Baym, Pethick, and Sutherland (BPS) equation\nof state for the outer crust. We show that the magnetic field has a dual role,\ncontributing to the crust deformation via the electromagnetic interaction\n(manifested in this case as the Lorentz force) and by contributing to curvature\ndue to the energy stored in it. We also study a direct consequence of the crust\ndeformation due to the magnetic field: the thermal relaxation time. This\nquantity, which is of great importance to the thermal evolution of neutron\nstars is sensitive to the crust properties and, as such, we show that it may be\nstrongly affected by the magnetic field.\n", "  We show how to realize two-component fractional quantum Hall phases in\nmonolayer graphene by optically driving the system. A laser is tuned into\nresonance between two Landau levels, giving rise to an effective tunneling\nbetween these two synthetic layers. Remarkably, because of this coupling, the\ninterlayer interaction at non-zero relative angular momentum can become\ndominant, resembling a hollow-core pseudo-potential. In the weak tunneling\nregime, this interaction favors the formation of singlet states, as we\nexplicitly show by numerical diagonalization, at fillings $\\nu=1/2$ and\n$\\nu=2/3$. We discuss possible candidate phases, including the Haldane-Rezayi\nphase, the interlayer Pfaffian phase, and a Fibonacci phase. This demonstrates\nthat our method may pave the way towards the realization of non-Abelian phases,\nas well as the control of topological phase transitions, in graphene quantum\nHall systems using optical fields and integrated photonic structures.\n", "  We study a q-generalization of the classical Laguerre/Hermite orthogonal\npolynomials. Explicit results include: the recursive coefficients, matrix\nelements of generators for the Heisenberg algebra, and the Hankel determinants.\nThe power of quadratic relation is illustrated by comparing two ways of\ncalculating recursive coefficients. Finally, we derive a q-deformed version of\nthe Toda equations for both q-Laguerre/Hermite ensembles.\n", "  Living things avoid equilibrium using molecular machines. Such microscopic\nsoft-matter objects encounter relatively large friction and fluctuations. We\ndiscuss design principles for effective molecular machine operation in this\nunfamiliar context.\n", "  We study a gauge-singlet vector-like fermion hidden-sector dark matter model,\nin which the communication between the dark matter and the visible standard\nmodel sector is via the Higgs-portal scalar-Higgs mixing, and also via a\nhidden-sector scalar with loop-level couplings to two gluons and also to two\nhypercharge gauge bosons induced by a vector-like quark. We find that the\nHiggs-portal possibility is stringently constrained to be small by the recent\nLHC di-Higgs search limits, and the loop-induced couplings are important to\ninclude. In the model parameter space, we present the dark matter\nrelic-density, the dark-matter-nucleon direct-detection scattering\ncross-section, the LHC diphoton rate from gluon-gluon fusion, and the\ntheoretical upper-bounds on the fermion-scalar couplings from perturbative\nunitarity.\n", "  $\\eta NNN$ and $\\eta NNNN$ bound states are explored in stochastic\nvariational method (SVM) calculations within a pionless effective field theory\n(EFT) approach at leading order. The theoretical input consists of regulated\n$NN$ and $NNN$ contact terms, and a regulated energy dependent $\\eta N$ contact\nterm derived from coupled-channel models of the $N^{\\ast}(1535)$ nucleon\nresonance plus a regulated $\\eta NN$ contact term. A self consistency procedure\nis applied to deal with the energy dependence of the $\\eta N$ subthreshold\ninput, resulting in a weak dependence of the calculated $\\eta$-nuclear binding\nenergies on the EFT regulator. It is found, in terms of the $\\eta N$ scattering\nlength $a_{\\eta N}$, that the onset of binding $\\eta\\,^3$He requires a minimal\nvalue of Re$\\,a_{\\eta N}$ close to 1 fm, yielding then a few MeV $\\eta$ binding\nin $\\eta\\,^4$He. The onset of binding $\\eta\\,^4$He requires a lower value of\nRe$\\,a_{\\eta N}$, but exceeding 0.7 fm.\n", "  Open quantum systems are subject to interaction with their surrounding\nenvironment. In many applications, at low temperatures, quantum environments\nfall into two universality classes of models: Caldeira-Leggett oscillator bath\nmodels and Prokof'ev-Stamp spin bath models. The two classes are commonly\nrecognized to be distinct and to have strikingly different effects on principal\nsystems, except at weak coupling limits. However, I show here, in contrast,\nthat oscillator bath models can simulate the effect of spin bath models in\nstrong coupling limit of the spin bath. I choose parameters of the oscillator\nbath models such that they produce incoherent relaxation, just as in the spin\nbath models, with relaxation rates for a two-state system (a qubit) equivalent\nto those of the spin bath models in the strong coupling limit.\n", "  We revisit the problem of work extraction from a system in contact with a\nheat bath to a work storage system, and the reverse problem of state formation\nfrom a thermal system state in single-shot quantum thermodynamics. A physically\nintuitive and mathematically simple approach using only elementary majorization\ntheory and matrix analysis is developed, and a graphical interpretation of the\nmaximum extractable work, minimum work cost of formation, and corresponding\nsingle-shot free energies is presented. This approach provides a bridge between\ntwo previous methods based respectively on the concept of thermomajorization\nand a comparison of subspace dimensions. In addition, a conceptual\ninconsistency with regard to general work extraction involving transitions\nbetween multiple energy levels of the work storage system is clarified and\nresolved. It is shown that an additional contribution to the maximum\nextractable work in those general cases should be interpreted not as work\nextracted from the system, but as heat transferred from the heat bath. Indeed,\nthe additional contribution is an artifact of a work storage system\n(essentially a suspended \"weight\" that can be raised or lowered) that does not\ntruly distinguish work from heat. The result calls into question the common\nconcept that a work storage system in quantum thermodynamics is simply the\nquantum version of a suspended weight in classical thermodynamics.\n", "  We investigate all geodesics in the entire class of nonexpanding impulsive\ngravitational waves propagating in an (anti-)de Sitter universe using the\ndistributional metric. We extend the regularization approach of part I,\n[SSLP16] to a full nonlinear distributional analysis within the geometric\ntheory of generalized functions. We prove global existence and uniqueness of\ngeodesics that cross the impulsive wave and hence geodesic completeness in full\ngenerality for this class of low regularity spacetimes. This, in particular,\nprepares the ground for a mathematically rigorous account on the 'physical\nequivalence' of the continuous with the distributional `from' of the metric.\n", "  Mechanisms such as ice-shelf hydrofracturing and ice-cliff collapse may\nrapidly increase discharge from marine-based ice sheets. Here, we link a\nprobabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of\nAntarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to\nexplore their influence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and relative sea-level\n(RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment\nand structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas\nemissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected\n21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective\nmeasures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently\nhome to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical\nmodel, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of\nice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of\nsimulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93-243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26-98 cm) is minimal.\nBy 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches\n>10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied\nby 950 million people (vs. 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation\nbetween the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond\nimplies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes.\nThe sensitivity of post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights\nthe need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.\n", "  The validity of the Pauli Exclusion Principle, a building block of Quantum\nMechanics, is tested for electrons. The VIP (VIolation of Pauli exclusion\nprinciple) and its follow-up VIP-2 experiments at the Laboratori Nazionali del\nGran Sasso search for x-rays from copper atomic transition that are prohibited\nby the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The candidate events, if they exist,\noriginate from the transition of a $2p$ orbit electron to the ground state\nwhich is already occupied by two electrons. The present limit on the\nprobability for Pauli Exclusion Principle violation for electrons set by the\nVIP experiment is 4.7 $\\times$ 10 $^{-29}$. We report a first result from the\nVIP-2 experiment improving on the VIP limit, that solidifies the final goal to\nachieve a two order of magnitude gain in the long run.\n", "  A quantitative assessment of the progress of small prototype quantum\nprocessors towards fault-tolerant quantum computation is a problem of current\ninterest in experimental and theoretical quantum information science. We\nintroduce a necessary and fair criterion for quantum error correction (QEC),\nwhich must be achieved in the development of these quantum processors before\ntheir sizes are sufficiently big to consider the well-known QEC threshold. We\napply this criterion to benchmark the ongoing effort in implementing QEC with\ntopological color codes using trapped-ion quantum processors and, more\nimportantly, to guide the future hardware developments that shall be required\nin order to demonstrate beneficial QEC with small topological quantum codes. In\ndoing so, we present a thorough description of a realistic trapped-ion toolbox\nfor QEC, and a physically-motivated error model that goes beyond standard\nsimplifications in the QEC literature. Our large-scale numerical analysis shows\nthat two-species trapped-ion crystals in high-optical aperture segmented traps,\nwith the improvements hereby described, are a very promising candidate for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation.\n", "  We show a surprising link between experimental setups to realize\nhigh-dimensional multipartite quantum states and Graph Theory. In these setups,\nthe paths of photons are identified such that the photon-source information is\nnever created. We find that each of these setups corresponds to an undirected\ngraph, and every undirected graph corresponds to an experimental setup. Every\nterm in the emerging quantum superposition corresponds to a perfect matching in\nthe graph. Calculating the final quantum state is in the complexity class\n#P-complete, thus cannot be done efficiently. To strengthen the link further,\ntheorems from Graph Theory -- such as Hall's marriage problem -- are rephrased\nin the language of pair creation in quantum experiments. We show explicitly how\nthis link allows to answer questions about quantum experiments (such as which\nclasses of entangled states can be created) with graph theoretical methods, and\npotentially simulate properties of Graphs and Networks with quantum experiments\n(such as critical exponents and phase transitions).\n", "  We investigate the rare baryonic ${\\Lambda}_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda}l^+ l^-$\ndecays in a non-universal $Z'$ model, which is one of the well-motivated\nextensions of the standard model (SM). Considering the effects of $Z'$-mediated\nflavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) we analyse the differential decay\nrate, forward-backward asymmetries and lepton polarisation asymmetries for the\n${\\Lambda}_b\\rightarrow{\\Lambda}l^+ l^-$ decays. We find significant deviations\nfrom their SM predictions, which could indicate new physics arising from the\n$Z'$ gauge boson.\n", "  Calorimeters with silicon detectors have many unique features and are\nproposed for several world-leading experiments. We discuss the tests of the\nfirst three 18x18 cm$^2$ layers segmented into 1024 pixels of the technological\nprototype of the silicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter for a future\n$e^+e^-$ collider. The tests have beem performed in November 2015 at CERN SPS\nbeam line.\n", "  We provide a C/C++ software for the shape analysis of deflated elastic\ncapsules in a pendant capsule geometry, which is based on an elastic\ndescription of the capsule material as a quasi two-dimensional elastic membrane\nusing shell theory. Pendant capsule elastometry provides a new in-situ and\nnon-contact method for interfacial rheology of elastic capsules. Given an\nelastic model of the capsule membrane, pendant capsule elastometry determines\noptimal elastic moduli by fitting numerically generated axisymmetric shapes\noptimally to an experimental image. For each digitized image of a deflated\ncapsule elastic moduli can be determined, if another image of its undeformed\nreference shape is provided. Within this paper, we focus on nonlinear Hookean\nelasticity because of its low computational cost its wide applicability, but\nalso discuss and implement alternative constitutive laws. For Hookean\nelasticity, Young's surface modulus (or, alternatively, area compression\nmodulus) and Poisson's ratio are determined; for Mooney-Rivlin elasticity, the\nRivlin modulus and a dimensionless shape parameter are determined; for\nneo-Hookean elasticity, only the Rivlin modulus is determined, using a fixed\ndimensionless shape parameter. Comparing results for different models we find\nthat nonlinear Hookean elasticity is adequate for most capsules. If series of\nimages are available, these moduli can be evaluated as a function of the\ncapsule volume to analyze hysteresis or aging effects depending on the\ndeformation history. An additional wrinkling wavelength measurement allows the\nuser to determine the bending modulus, from which the layer thickness can be\nderived. We verify the method by analyzing several materials, compare the\nresults to available rheological measurements, and review several applications.\nWe make the software available under the GPL license at\ngithub.com/jhegemann/opencapsule.\n", "  At long times residual couplings to the environment become relevant even in\nthe most isolated experiments, creating a crucial difficulty for the study of\nfundamental aspects of many-body dynamics. A particular example is many-body\nlocalization in a cold-atom setting, where incoherent photon scattering\nintroduces both dephasing and particle loss. Whereas dephasing has been studied\nin detail and is known to destroy localization already on the level of\nnon-interacting particles, the effect of particle loss is less well understood.\nA difficulty arises due to the `non-local' nature of the loss process,\ncomplicating standard numerical tools using matrix product decomposition.\nUtilizing symmetries of the Lindbladian dynamics, we investigate the particle\nloss on both the dynamics of observables, as well as the structure of the\ndensity matrix and the individual states. We find that particle loss in the\npresence of interactions leads to dissipation and a strong suppression of the\n(operator space) entanglement entropy. Our approach allows for the study of the\ninterplay of dephasing and loss for pure and mixed initial states to long\ntimes, which is important for future experiments using controlled coupling of\nthe environment.\n", "  The G-degree of colored graphs is a key concept in the approach to Quantum\nGravity via tensor models. The present paper studies the properties of the\nG-degree for the large class of graphs representing singular manifolds\n(including closed PL manifolds). In particular, the complete topological\nclassification up to G-degree 6 is obtained in dimension 3, where all 4-colored\ngraphs represent singular manifolds.\n", "  In this paper, we study a one-dimensional boson system in a superlattice\npotential.This system is experimentally feasible by using ultracold atomic\ngases,and attracts much attention these days. It is expected that the system\nhas a topological phase called topological Mott insulator (TMI). We show that\nin strongly-interacting cases, the competition between the superlattice\npotential and the on-site interaction leads to various TMIs with non-vanishing\ninteger Chern number. Compared to hard-core case, the soft-core boson system\nexhibits rich phase diagrams including various non-trivial TMIs. By using the\nexact diagonalization,we obtain detailed bulk-global phase diagrams including\nthe TMIs with high Chern numbers and also various non-topological phases. We\nalso show that in adiabatic experimental setups, the strongly-interacting\nbosonic TMIs exhibit the topological particle transfer, i.e., topological\ncharge pumping phenomenon, similarly to weakly-interacting systems. The various\nTMIs are characterized by topological charge pumping as it is closely related\nto the Chern number, and therefor the Chern number is to be observed in\nfeasible experiments.\n", "  A plausible explanation for the lightness of neutrino masses is that\nneutrinos are massless at tree level, with their mass (typically Majorana)\nbeing generated radiatively at one or more loops. The new couplings, together\nwith the suppression coming from the loop factors, imply that the new degrees\nof freedom cannot be too heavy (they are typically at the TeV scale).\nTherefore, in these models there are no large mass hierarchies and they can be\ntested using different searches, making their detailed phenomenological study\nvery appealing. In particular, the new particles can be searched for at\ncolliders and generically induce signals in lepton-flavor and lepton-number\nviolating processes (in the case of Majorana neutrinos), which are not\nindependent from reproducing correctly the neutrino masses and mixings. The\nmain focus of the review is on Majorana neutrinos. We order the allowed theory\nspace from three different perspectives: (i) using an effective operator\napproach to lepton number violation, (ii) by the number of loops at which the\nWeinberg operator is generated, (iii) within a given loop order, by the\npossible irreducible topologies. We also discuss in more detail some popular\nradiative models which involve qualitatively different features, revisiting\ntheir most important phenomenological implications. Finally, we list some\npromising avenues to pursue.\n", "  The predictions of Moore's law are considered by experts to be valid until\n2020 giving rise to \"post-Moore's\" technologies afterwards. Energy efficiency\nis one of the major challenges in high-performance computing that should be\nanswered. Superconductor digital technology is a promising post-Moore's\nalternative for the development of supercomputers. In this paper, we consider\noperation principles of an energy-efficient superconductor logic and memory\ncircuits with a short retrospective review of their evolution. We analyze their\nshortcomings in respect to computer circuits design. Possible ways of further\nresearch are outlined.\n", "  Conversion of spin to charge current was observed in SrTiO3 doped with Nd\n(Nd:STO), which exhibited a metallic behavior even with low concentration\ndoping. The obvious variation of DC voltages for Py/Nd:STO, obtained by\ninverting the spin diffusion direction, demonstrated that the detected signals\ncontained the contribution from the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) induced by\nthe spin dependent scattering from Nd impurities with strong spin-orbit\ninteraction. The DC voltages of the ISHE for Nd:STO were measured at different\nmicrowave frequency and power, which revealed that spin currents were\nsuccessfully injected into doped STO layer by spin pumping. The linear relation\nbetween the ISHE resistivity and the resistivity induced by impurities implied\nthat the skew scattering was the dominant contribution in this case, and the\nspin Hall angle was estimated to be 0.17%. This work demonstrated that\nextrinsic spin dependent scattering in oxides can be used in spintroics besides\nthat in heavy elements doped metals.\n", "  We consider the corrections due to quantum fluctuations of fields on charged\nblack holes induced from the energy-momentum trace anomaly. Although the number\nof horizons stays unchanged and their positions receive only finite\ncorrections, the geometry, thermodynamics and formation of RN black holes\nchange seriously in particular for small ones. The entropy receives a\nlogarithmic correction. The line $Q=M$, separating naked singularities from\nphysical solutions is corrected, putting a lower limit on the mass and an upper\nlimit on the temperature of the black hole as a function of its charge. The\nmodifications are highly significant in the cases of near-extremal and small\nblack holes. We also show that for black holes with small mass can stay in\nthermal equilibrium without any constraint on the volume of the container. This\nresult is in contrast to the large black holes that need a finite volume\ncontainer for thermal equilibrium. The minimum of the mass lower limits occurs\nat zero charge, resulting in the extremal Schwarzschild black hole with a\nspecific mass of the order of $M_{p}$ and zero temperature. This state which\nhas only gravitational interaction will be the final stage of Hawking\nradiation. Stability and lack of any interaction but gravitational, makes the\nextremal Schwarzschild black hole a serious candidate for dark matter particle.\n", "  The electroweak production and subsequent decay of single top quarks in the\n$t$-channel is determined by the properties of the $Wtb$ vertex, which can be\ndescribed by the complex parameters of an effective Lagrangian. An analysis of\na triple-differential decay rate in $t$-channel production is used to\nsimultaneously determine five generalised helicity fractions and phases, as\nwell as the polarisation of the produced top quark. The complex parameters are\nthen constrained. This analysis is based on 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton\ncollision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the ATLAS\ndetector at the LHC. The fraction of decays containing transversely polarised\n$W$ bosons is measured to be $f_1=0.30 \\pm 0.05$. The phase between amplitudes\nfor transversely and longitudinally polarised $W$ bosons recoiling against\nleft-handed $b$-quarks, is measured to be $\\delta_- =\n0.002\\pi^{+0.016\\pi}_{-0.017\\pi}$, giving no indication of CP violation. The\nfraction of longitudinal or transverse $W$ bosons accompanied by right-handed\n$b$-quarks are also constrained. Based on these measurements, limits are placed\nat 95% C.L. on the ratio of the complex coupling parameters\nRe$[g_\\mathrm{R}/V_\\mathrm{L}] \\in [-0.12,0.17]$ and\nIm$[g_\\mathrm{R}/V_\\mathrm{L}] \\in [-0.07,0.06]$. Constraints are also placed\non the ratios $|V_\\mathrm{R}/V_\\mathrm{L}|$ and $|g_\\mathrm{L}/V_\\mathrm{L}|$.\nIn addition, the polarisation of single top quarks in the $t$-channel is\nconstrained to be $P > 0.72$ (95% C.L.). None of the above measurements make\nassumptions on the value of any of the other parameters or couplings and all of\nthem are in agreement with the Standard Model.\n", "  Motivated by identifying the origin of the bias dependence of tension\npropagation we investigate methods for measuring tension propagation\nquantitatively in computer simulations of driven polymer translocation. Here\nthe motion of flexible polymer chains through a narrow pore is simulated using\nLangevin dynamics. We measure tension forces, bead velocities, bead distances,\nand bond angles along the polymer at all stages of translocation with\nunprecedented precision. Measurements are done at a standard temperature used\nin simulations and at zero temperature to pin down the effect of fluctuations.\nThe measured quantities were found to give qualitatively similar\ncharacteristics, but the bias dependence could be determined only using tension\nforce. We find that in the scaling relation $\\tau \\sim N^\\beta f_d^\\alpha$ for\ntranslocation time $\\tau$, the polymer length $N$, and the bias force $f_d$ the\nincrease of the exponent $\\beta$ with bias is caused by center-of-mass\ndiffusion of the polymer toward the pore on the \\textit{cis} side. We find that\nthis diffusion also causes the exponent $\\alpha$ to deviate from the ideal\nvalue $-1$. The bias dependence of $\\beta$ was found to result from combination\nof diffusion and pore friction and so be relevant for polymers that are too\nshort to be considered asymptotically long. The effect is relevant in\nexperiments all of which are made using polymers whose lengths are far below\nthe asymptotic limit. Thereby our results also corroborate the theoretical\nprediction by Sakaue's theory [Polymers 8(12), 424 (2016)] that there should\nnot be bias dependence of $\\beta$ for asymptotically long polymers. By\nexcluding fluctuations we also show that monomer crowding at the pore exit\ncannot have a measurable effect on translocation dynamics under realistic\nconditions.\n", "  Consider a 2D composites with non-overlapping equal inclusions imbedded in a\nhost material of the normalized unit conductivity. The conductivity of\ninclusions takes two values $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ with the probabilities\n$p$ and $1-p$, respectively. We prove that the effective conductivity tensor of\nthe considered three-phase random composite is equal to the effective\nconductivity tensor of the two-phase deterministic composite with the same\ninclusions of the conductivity\n$\\sigma=[p(\\sigma_1~-~\\sigma_2)+~\\sigma_2+\\sigma_1\\sigma_2]\n[1+\\sigma_1-p(\\sigma_1-\\sigma_2)]^{-1}$.\n", "  We investigate constraints on scalar dark matter (DM) by analyzing the\nLyman-alpha forest, which probes structure formation at medium and small\nscales, and also by studying its cosmological consequences at high and low\nredshift. For scalar DM that constitutes more than 30% of the total DM density,\nwe obtain a lower limit m >~ 10^{-21} eV for the mass of scalar DM. This\nimplies an upper limit on the initial field displacement (or the decay constant\nfor an axion-like field) of phi <~ 10^{16} GeV. We also derive limits on the\nenergy scale of cosmic inflation and establish an upper bound on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 10^{-3} in the presence of scalar DM.\nFurthermore, we show that there is very little room for ultralight scalar DM to\nsolve the \"small-scale crisis\" of cold DM without spoiling the Lyman-alpha\nforest results. The constraints presented in this paper can be used for testing\ngeneric theories that contain light scalar fields.\n", "  We propose a scenario that can naturally explain the observed dark\nmatter-baryon ratio in the context of bimetric theory with a chameleon field.\nWe introduce two additional gravitational degrees of freedom, the massive\ngraviton and the chameleon field, corresponding to dark matter and dark energy,\nrespectively. The chameleon field is assumed to be non-minimally coupled to\ndark matter, i.e., the massive graviton, through the graviton mass terms. We\nfind that the dark matter-baryon ratio is dynamically adjusted to the observed\nvalue due to the energy transfer by the chameleon field. As a result, the model\ncan explain the observed dark matter-baryon ratio independently from the\ninitial abundance of them.\n", "  The excitation energies of the $\\Lambda_{c}$ and $\\Lambda_{b}$ baryons are\ninvestigated in a finite-size diquark potential model, in which the heavy\nbaryons are treated as bound states of a charm quark and a scalar-isoscalar\ndiquark. The diquark is considered as a sizable object. The quark-diquark\ninteraction is calculated as a sum of the quark-quark interaction which is\nassumed to be half of the quark-antiquark interaction for the color singlet.\nThe potential parameters in the quark-antiquark interaction are fixed so as to\nreproduce the charmonium spectrum. We find the diquark size to be 1.1 fm for\nthe diquark mass 0.5 GeV/c$^{2}$ to reproduce the $1p$ excitation energy of\n$\\Lambda_{c}$. In this model, the $\\Lambda_{c}$ and $\\Lambda_{b}$ excitation\nspectra are reproduced well, while this model does not explain\n$\\Lambda_{c}(2765)$, whose isospin nor spin-parity are unknown yet. Thus, the\ndetailed properties of $\\Lambda_{c}(2765)$ is very important to the presence of\nthe diquark in heavy baryons as a effective constituent. We also discuss the\n$\\Xi_{c}$ spectrum with the scalar strange diquark.\n", "  The FAMU experiment aims to accurately measure the hyperfine splitting of the\nground state of the muonic hydrogen atom. A measurement of the transfer rate of\nmuons from hydrogen to heavier gases is necessary for this purpose. In June\n2014, within a preliminary experiment, a pressurized gas-target was exposed to\nthe pulsed low-energy muon beam at the RIKEN RAL muon facility (Rutherford\nAppleton Laboratory, UK). The main goal of the test was the characterization of\nboth the noise induced by the pulsed beam and the X-ray detectors. The\napparatus, to some extent rudimental, has served admirably to this task.\nTechnical results have been published that prove the validity of the choices\nmade and pave the way for the next steps. This paper presents the results of\nphysical relevance of measurements of the muon transfer rate to carbon dioxide,\noxygen, and argon from non-thermalized excited mu-p atoms. The analysis\nmethodology and the approach to the systematics errors are useful for the\nsubsequent study of the transfer rate as function of the kinetic energy of the\nmu-p currently under way.\n", "  We propose a protocol to simulate the evolution of a non-Markovian open\nquantum system by considering a collisional process with a many-body system,\nwhich plays the role of an environment. As a result of our protocol the\nenvironment spatial correlations are mapped into the time correlations of a\nnoise that drives the dynamics of the open system. Considering the weak\ncoupling limit the open system can also be considered as a probe of the\nenvironment properties. In this regard, when preparing the environment in its\nground state, a measurement of the dynamics of the open system allows to\ndetermine the length of the environment spatial correlations and therefore its\ncritical properties. To illustrate our proposal we simulate the full system\ndynamics with matrix-product-states and compare this with the reduced dynamics\nobtained with an approximated variational master equation.\n", "  We investigate current and future prospects for coincident detection of\nhigh-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves (GWs). Short gamma-ray bursts\n(SGRBs) are believed to originate from mergers of compact star binaries\ninvolving neutron stars. We estimate high-energy neutrino fluences from prompt\nemission, extended emission, X-ray flares, and plateau emission, and show that\nneutrino signals associated with the extended emission are the most promising.\nAssuming that the cosmic-ray loading factor is $\\sim10$ and the Lorentz factor\ndistribution is lognormal, we calculate the probability of neutrino detection\nfrom extended emission by current and future neutrino detectors, and find that\nthe quasi-simultaneous detection of high-energy neutrinos, gamma rays, and GWs\nis possible with future instruments or even with current instruments for nearby\nSGRBs having extended emission. We also discuss stacking analyses that will\nalso be useful with future experiments such as IceCube-Gen2.\n", "  The topological phases of matter provide the opportunity to observe many\nexotic properties, like the existence of two dimensional topological surface\nstates in the form of Dirac cone in topological insulators, chiral transport\nthrough open Fermi arc in Weyl semimetals etc. However, these properties can\nonly affect the transport characteristics and therefore can be useful for\napplications only if the topological phenomena occur near the Fermi level.\nCaAgAs is a promising candidate, wherein the ab-initio calculations predict\nline-node at the Fermi level which on including spin-orbit coupling transforms\ninto a topological insulator. In this report, we study the electronic structure\nof CaAgAs with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), ab-initio\ncalculations and transport measurements. The ARPES results show that the bulk\nvalence band crosses the Fermi energy at gamma-point and the band dispersion\nmatches the ab-initio calculations closely on shifting the Fermi energy by -0.5\neV. ARPES results are in good agreement with our transport measurements which\nshow abundant p-type carriers.\n", "  We rewrite Poynting's theorem, already used in a previous publication\n(Treumann & Baumjohann 2017) to derive relations between the turbulent magnetic\nand electric power spectral densities, to make explicit where the mechanical\ncontributions enter. We then make explicit use of the relativistic\ntransformation of the turbulent electric fluctuations to obtain expressions\nwhich depend only on the magnetic and velocity fluctuations. Any electric\nfluctuations play just an intermediate role. Equations are constructed for the\nturbulent conductivity spectrum in Alfv\\'enic and non-Alfv\\'enic turbulence in\nextension of the results in the above citation. An observation-based discussion\nof their use in application to solar wind turbulence is given. The inertial\nrange solar wind turbulence exhibits signs of chaos and self-organisation.\n", "  It has been proposed that the pseudogap state of underdoped cuprate\nsuperconductors may be due to a transition to a phase which has circulating\ncurrents within each unit cell. Here, we use polarized neutron diffraction to\nsearch for the corresponding orbital moments in two samples of underdoped\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ with doping levels $p=0.104$ and 0.123. In contrast to\nsome other reports using polarized neutrons, but in agreement with nuclear\nmagnetic resonance and muon spin rotation measurements, we find no evidence for\nthe appearance of magnetic order below 300 K. Thus, our experiment suggests\nthat such order is not an intrinsic property of high-quality cuprate\nsuperconductor single crystals. Our results provide an upper bound for a\npossible orbital loop moment which depends on the pattern of currents within\nthe unit cell. For example, for the CC-$\\theta_{II}$ pattern proposed by Varma,\nwe find that the ordered moment per current loop is less than 0.013 $\\mu_B$ for\n$p=0.104$.\n", "  In the derivation of the generating function of the Gaudin Hamiltonians with\nboundary terms, we follow the same approach used previously in the rational\ncase, which in turn was based on Sklyanin's method in the periodic case. Our\nderivation is centered on the quasi-classical expansion of the linear\ncombination of the transfer matrix of the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain and the\ncentral element, the so-called Sklyanin determinant. The corresponding Gaudin\nHamiltonians with boundary terms are obtained as the residues of the generating\nfunction. By defining the appropriate Bethe vectors which yield strikingly\nsimple off-shell action of the generating function, we fully implement the\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz, obtaining the spectrum of the generating function and\nthe corresponding Bethe equations.\n", "  We study the multiplicity fluctuation and correlation of identified mesons\nand baryons formed at the hadronization by the quark combination mechanism in\nthe context of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Based on the\nstatistical method of free quark combination, we derive the two-hadron\nmultiplicity correlations such as meson-meson and meson-baryon correlations,\nand take the effects of quark number fluctuation at hadronization into account\nby a Taylor expansion method. After including the decay contributions, we\ncalculate the dynamical fluctuation observable $\\nu_{dyn}$ for $\\text{K}\\pi$,\n$p\\pi$ and $\\text{K}p$ pairs and discuss what underlying physics can be\nobtained by comparing with the data in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$\nTeV and the simulations from HIJING and AMPT event generators.\n", "  We propose a scheme to simulate the interaction between a two-level system\nand a classical light field. Under the transversal driving of two microwave\ntones, the system Hamiltonian is identical to that of the general\nsemi-classical Rabi model. We experimentally realize this Hamiltonian with a\nsuperconducting transmon qubit. By tuning the strength, phase and frequency of\nthe two microwave driving fields, we simulate the quantum dynamics from weak to\nextremely strong driving regime. The resulting evolutions gradually deviate\nfrom the normal sinusoidal Rabi oscillations with increasing driving strength,\nin accordance with the predictions of the general semi-classical Rabi model far\nbeyond the weak driving limit. Our scheme provides an effective approach to\ninvestigate the extremely strong interaction between a two-level system and a\nclassical light field. Such strong interactions are usually inaccessible in\nexperiments.\n", "  Studies of the reaction $\\gamma\\pi\\to\\pi\\pi$, in the context of the ongoing\nPrimakoff program of the COMPASS experiment at CERN, give access to the\nradiative couplings of the $\\rho(770)$ and $\\rho_3(1690)$ resonances. We\nprovide a vector-meson-dominance estimate of the respective radiative width of\nthe $\\rho_3$, $\\Gamma_{\\rho_3\\to\\pi\\gamma}=48(18)$ keV, as well as its impact\non the $F$-wave in $\\gamma\\pi\\to\\pi\\pi$. For the $\\rho(770)$, we establish the\nformalism necessary to extract its radiative coupling directly from the residue\nof the resonance pole by analytic continuation of the $\\gamma\\pi\\to\\pi\\pi$\namplitude to the second Riemann sheet, without any reference to the\nvector-meson-dominance hypothesis.\n", "  An ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.14 W$\\cdot$ m$^{-1} \\cdot$\nK$^{-1}$ along the $\\vec b$ axis of As$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals was obtained\nat 300 K by first-principles calculations involving the density functional\ntheory and the resolution of the Boltzmann transport equation. This ultralow\nlattice thermal conductivity arises from the combination of two mechanisms: 1)\na cascade-like fall of the low-lying optical modes, which results in avoided\ncrossings of these with the acoustic modes, low sound velocities and increased\nscattering rates of the acoustic phonons; and 2) the repulsion between the\nlone-pair electrons of the As cations and the valence $p$ orbitals of the Se\nanions, which leads to an increase in the anharmonicity of the bonds. The\nphysical origins of these mechanisms lie on the nature of the chemical bonding\nin the material and its strong anisotropy. These results, whose validity has\nbeen addressed by comparison with SnSe, for which excellent agreement between\nthe theoretical predictions and the experiments is achieved, point out that\nAs$_2$Se$_3$ could exhibit improved thermoelectric properties.\n", "  The objective of this work is to improve the robustness and accuracy of\nnumerical simulations of both ideal and non-ideal explosives by introducing\ntemperature dependence in mechanical equations of state for reactants and\nproducts. To this end, we modify existing mechanical equations of state to\nappropriately approximate the temperature in the reaction zone. Mechanical\nequations of state of Mie-Gr\\\"{u}neisen form are developed with extensions,\nwhich allow the temperature to be evaluated appropriately, and the temperature\nequilibrium condition to be applied robustly. Furthermore the snow plow model\nis used to capture the effect of porosity on the reactants equation of state.\nWe apply the methodology to predict the velocity of compliantly confined\ndetonation waves. Once reaction rates are calibrated for unconfined detonation\nvelocities, simulations of confined rate sticks and slabs are performed, and\nthe experimental detonation velocities are matched without further parameter\nalteration, demonstrating the predictive capability of our simulations. We\napply the same methodology to both ideal (PBX9502, a high explosive with\nprincipal ingredient TATB) and non-ideal (EM120D, an ANE or ammonium nitrate\nbased emulsion) explosives.\n", "  Magnetic droplets are dynamical solitons that can be generated by locally\nsuppressing the dynamical damping in magnetic films with perpendicular\nanisotropy. To date, droplets have been observed only in nanocontact\nspin-torque oscillators operated by spin-polarized electrical currents. Here,\nwe experimentally demonstrate that magnetic droplets can be nucleated and\nsustained by pure spin currents in nanoconstriction-based spin Hall devices.\nMicromagnetic simulations support our interpretation of the data, and indicate\nthat in addition to the stationary droplets, propagating solitons can be also\ngenerated in the studied system, which can be utilized for the information\ntransmission in spintronic applications.\n", "  Fluid motion driven by thermal effects, such as that due to buoyancy in\ndifferentially heated three-dimensional (3D) enclosures, arise in several\nnatural settings and engineering applications. It is represented by the\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in conjunction with the thermal\nenergy transport equation represented as a convection-diffusion equation (CDE)\nfor the temperature field. In this study, we develop new 3D lattice Boltzmann\n(LB) methods based on central moments and using multiple relaxation times for\nthe three-dimensional, fifteen velocity (D3Q15) lattice, as well as it subset,\ni.e. the three-dimensional, seven velocity (D3Q7) lattice to solve the 3D CDE\nfor the temperature field in a double distribution function framework. Their\ncollision operators lead to a cascaded structure involving higher order terms\nresulting in improved stability. In this approach, the fluid motion is solved\nby another 3D cascaded LB model from prior work. Owing to the differences in\nthe number of collision invariants to represent the dynamics of flow and the\ntransport of the temperature field, the structure of the collision operator for\nthe 3D cascaded LB formulation for the CDE is found to be markedly different\nfrom that for the NSE. The new 3D cascaded (LB) models for thermal convective\nflows are validated for natural convection of air driven thermally on two\nvertically opposite faces in a cubic cavity enclosure at different Rayleigh\nnumbers against prior numerical benchmark solutions. Results show good\nquantitative agreement of the profiles of the flow and thermal fields, and the\nmagnitudes of the peak convection velocities as well as the heat transfer rates\ngiven in terms of the Nusselt number.\n", "  We investigate properties of self-gravitating isorotating Skyrmions in the\ngeneralized Einstein-Skyrme model with higher-derivative terms in the matter\nfield sector. These stationary solutions are axially symmetric, regular and\nasymptotically flat. We provide a detailed account of the branch structure of\nthe spinning solutions in the topological sector of degree one. We show that\nadditional branches of solutions appear, as the angular frequency increases\nabove some critical value, these \"cloudy\" configurations can be considered as a\nbound system of the spinning Skyrmions and \"pion\" excitations in the\ntopologically trivial sector. Considering the critical behavior of the\nisorotating solitons in the general Einstein-Skyrme model, we point out that\nthere is no isospinning regular solutions in the reduced self-dual\n$\\mathcal{L}_6+\\mathcal{L}_0$ submodel for any non zero value of the angular\nfrequency.\n", "  The theory of multidimensional Poisson vertex algebras (mPVAs) provides a\ncompletely algebraic formalism to study the Hamiltonian structure of PDEs, for\nany number of dependent and independent variables. In this paper, we compute\nthe cohomology of the PVAs associated with two-dimensional, two-components\nPoisson brackets of hydrodynamic type at the third differential degree. This\nallows us to obtain their corresponding Poisson-Lichnerowicz cohomology, which\nis the main building block of the theory of their deformations. Such a\ncohomology is trivial neither in the second group, corresponding to the\nexistence of a class of not equivalent infinitesimal deformation, nor in the\nthird, corresponding to the obstruction to extend such deformations\n", "  We calculate the full counting statistics (FCS) of a subsystem energy in free\nfermionic systems by means of the Grassmann variables. We demonstrate that the\ngenerating function of these systems can be written as a determinant formula\nwith respect to the Hamiltonian couplings and by employing the Bell's\npolynomials, we derive exact formulas for the subsystem energy moments. In\naddition, we discuss the same quantities in the quantum XY spin chain, and we\ndemonstrate that at the critical regimes the fluctuations of the energy moments\ndecay like a power-law as we expect from the conformal field theory arguments,\nwhile in non-critical regimes, the decay is exponential. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss the full counting statistics of subsystem energy in the quantum XX\nchain.\n", "  The first observation of a binary neutron star coalescence by the Advanced\nLIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors offers an unprecedented\nopportunity to study matter under the most extreme conditions. After such a\nmerger, a compact remnant is left over whose nature depends primarily on the\nmasses of the inspiralling objects and on the equation of state of nuclear\nmatter. This could be either a black hole or a neutron star (NS), with the\nlatter being either long-lived or too massive for stability implying delayed\ncollapse to a black hole. Here, we present a search for gravitational waves\nfrom the remnant of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 using data from\nAdvanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We search for short ($\\lesssim1$ s) and\nintermediate-duration ($\\lesssim 500$ s) signals, which includes\ngravitational-wave emission from a hypermassive NS or supramassive NS,\nrespectively. We find no signal from the post-merger remnant. Our derived\nstrain upper limits are more than an order of magnitude larger than those\npredicted by most models. For short signals, our best upper limit on the\nroot-sum-square of the gravitational-wave strain emitted from 1--4 kHz is\n$h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=2.1\\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ at 50% detection\nefficiency. For intermediate-duration signals, our best upper limit at 50%\ndetection efficiency is $h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=8.4\\times 10^{-22}$ Hz$^{-1/2}$ for\na millisecond magnetar model, and $h_{\\rm rss}^{50\\%}=5.9\\times 10^{-22}$\nHz$^{-1/2}$ for a bar-mode model. These results indicate that post-merger\nemission from a similar event may be detectable when advanced detectors reach\ndesign sensitivity or with next-generation detectors.\n", "  Thermal conductivity and shear viscosity of npe$\\mu$ matter in non-superfluid\nneutron star cores are considered in the framework of Brueckner-Hartree-Fock\nmany-body theory. We extend our previous work (Shternin, Baldo and Haensel,\n2013) by analysing different nucleon-nucleon potentials and different\nthree-body forces. We find that the use of different potentials leads up to one\norder of magnitude variations in the values of the nucleon contribution to\ntransport coefficients. The nucleon contribution dominates the thermal\nconductivity, but for all considered models the shear viscosity is dominated by\nleptons.\n", "  We discuss the electromagnetic radiation from newborn binary black holes\n(BBHs). As a consequence of the evolution of massive stellar binaries, a binary\nconsisting of a primary black hole (BH) and a secondary Wolf-Rayet star is\nexpected as a BBH progenitor system. We investigate optical transients from the\nbirth of BBHs powered by the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto the primary\nBH, which occur $\\sim1-10$ Gyr earlier than gravitational wave signals at the\nBH-BH merger. When the secondary massive star collapses into a BH, it may eject\na fraction of its outer material and may form a disk around the primary BH and\ninduces a powerful disk wind. These primary-induced winds can lead to optical\ntransients with a kinetic energy of $\\sim10^{47}-3\\times10^{48}$ erg, an ejecta\nvelocity of $10^8-10^9\\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, a duration of a few days, and an absolute\nmagnitude ranging from about $-11$ to $-14$. The light curves and late-time\nspectra of these transients are distinctive from those of ordinary supernovae,\nand detection of this type of transient is possible by future optical transient\nsurveys if the event rate of this transient is comparable to the merger rate of\nBBHs. This paper focuses on the emissions from disk-driven transients induced\nby the primary BH, different from the first paper that focuses on wind-driven\ntransients from the tidally-locked secondary massive star.\n", "  $ $From June--September, the summer monsoon current (SMC) flows eastward\nsouth of Sri Lanka and bends northeastward to form a swift jet that enters the\nBay of Bengal (BoB). As such, it is a crucial part of the water exchange\nbetween the Arabian Sea (AS) and BoB. The processes that determine the\nevolution, intensification and meandering of the SMC are only partly\nunderstood. They involve both local and remote forcing by the wind, as well as\ninteractions with westward-propagating Rossby waves and eddies. In this study,\nwe investigate these processes using an Indian-Ocean general circulation model\n(MOM4p1) that is capable of simulating the SMC realistcally. Because eddies and\nmeanders are smoothed out in the climatology, our analyses focus on a single\nyear of 2009, a period when a strong anticyclonic bend in the SMC was observed.\nAn eddy-kinetic-energy budget analysis shows the region to be a zone of\nsignificant eddy activity, where both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities\nare active. Based on the analysis, we classify the evolution of SMC into stages\nof onset, intensification, anticyclonic bend, anticyclonic vortex formation,\nmeandering and termination. In addition, analysis of eddy-potential-vorticity\nflux and eddy-enstrophy decay reveal when, where, and how the eddies tend to\ndrive the mean flow. Rossby waves and westward-propagating eddies arriving from\nthe east energize the SMC in June and accelerate the mean flow through an\nup-gradient eddy-potential-vorticity flux. At the same time, local winds also\nstrengthen the flow, by increasing its mean, near-surface, kinetic energy and\nraising isopycnals, the latter building up available potential energy (APE).\nThe baroclinic instability that takes place in late--July and early--August\nreleases APE, thereby generating the SMC meanders.\n", "  The effects of Fe dopants in (Li$_{0.8}$Fe$_{0.2}$OH)FeSe on the electronic\nband structure are investigated by band unfolding ($k$-projection) technique\nbased on first-principles supercell calculations. Doping 20\\% Fe into the LiOH\nlayers has significant effects on the band structure, that is, the Fe\nimpurities doping electrons to the FeSe layers not only shift the Fermi level,\nbut also induce substantial changes in the profile of bands around the Fermi\nlevel. However, the magnetic ordering in the dopants has minor effects on the\nband structure due to the fact that there is only a weak bonding between the\nLiOH and FeSe layers. Electronic bands for the surface FeSe layer show\nnoticeable differences from those for inner layers in both the location of the\nFermi level and details of the bands near the high symmetry points. The band\nstructure for the surface FeSe layer where the Fe atoms are in checkerboard\nantiferromagnetic order is consistent with angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy results. Mn and Co have similar doping effects on the band\nstructure of (LiOH)FeSe.\n", "  We present analytical results for the distribution of shortest cycle lengths\n(DSCL) in random networks. The approach is based on the relation between the\nDSCL and the distribution of shortest path lengths (DSPL). We apply this\napproach to configuration model networks, for which analytical results for the\nDSPL were obtained before. We first calculate the fraction of nodes in the\nnetwork which reside on at least one cycle. Conditioning on being on a cycle,\nwe provide the DSCL over ensembles of configuration model networks with degree\ndistributions which follow a Poisson distribution (Erdos-R\\'enyi network),\ndegenerate distribution (random regular graph) and a power-law distribution\n(scale-free network). The mean and variance of the DSCL are calculated. The\nanalytical results are found to be in very good agreement with the results of\ncomputer simulations.\n", "  Quantum random number generator (QRNG) can produce true randomness by\nutilizing the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Recently, the\nspontaneous-emission quantum phase noise of the laser has been widely deployed\nfor QRNG, due to its high rate, low cost and the feasibility of chip-scale\nintegration. Here, we perform a comprehensive experimental study of phase-noise\nbased QRNG with two independent lasers, each of which operates in either\ncontinuous-wave (CW) or pulsed mode. We implement QRNGs by operating the two\nlasers in three configurations, namely CW+CW, CW+pulsed and pulsed+pulsed, and\ndemonstrate their tradeoffs, strengths and weaknesses.\n", "  We consider the scaling laws, second-order statistics and entropy of the\nconsumed energy of metropolis cities which are hybrid complex systems\ncomprising social networks, engineering systems, agricultural output, economic\nactivity and energy components. We abstract a city in terms of two fundamental\nvariables; $s$ resource cells (of unit area) that represent energy-consuming\ngeographic or spatial zones (e.g. land, housing or infrastructure etc.) and a\npopulation comprising $n$ mobile units that can migrate between these cells. We\nshow that with a constant metropolis area (fixed $s$), the variance and entropy\nof consumed energy initially increase with $n$, reach a maximum and then\neventually diminish to zero as saturation is reached. These metrics are\nindicators of the spatial mobility of the population. Under certain situations,\nthe variance is bounded as a quadratic function of the mean consumed energy of\nthe metropolis. However, when population and metropolis area are endogenous,\ngrowth in the latter is arrested when $n\\leq\\frac{s}{2}\\log(s)$ due to\ndiminished population density. Conversely, the population growth reaches\nequilibrium when $n\\geq {s}\\log{n}$ or equivalently when the aggregate of both\nover-populated and under-populated areas is large. Moreover, we also draw the\nrelationship between our approach and multi-scalar information, when economic\ndependency between a metropolis's sub-regions is based on the entropy of\nconsumed energy. Finally, if the city's economic size (domestic product etc.)\nis proportional to the consumed energy, then for a constant population density,\nwe show that the economy scales linearly with the surface area (or $s$).\n", "  An outstanding problem in the study of networks of heterogeneous dynamical\nunits concerns the development of rigorous methods to probe the stability of\nsynchronous states when the differences between the units are not small. Here,\nwe address this problem by presenting a generalization of the master stability\nformalism that can be applied to heterogeneous oscillators with large\nmismatches. Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of\nthe matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension\nreduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new\nformalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the\noscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where\nall oscillators are completely synchronized. In the case of networks of\nidentically coupled oscillators, this corresponds to breaking the symmetry of\nthe system as a means to preserve the symmetry of the dynamical state---a\nrecently discovered effect termed asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync).\nOur framework enables us to identify communication delay as a new and\npotentially common mechanism giving rise to AISync, which we demonstrate using\nnetworks of delay-coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The results also have\npotential implications for control, as they reveal oscillator heterogeneity as\nan attribute that may be manipulated to enhance the stability of synchronous\nstates.\n", "  In network systems, a local perturbation can amplify as it propagates,\npotentially leading to a large-scale cascading failure. Here we derive a\ncontinuous model to advance our understanding of cascading failures in\npower-grid networks. The model accounts for both the failure of transmission\nlines and the desynchronization of power generators, and incorporates the\ntransient dynamics between successive steps of the cascade. In this framework,\nwe show that a cascade event is a phase-space transition from an equilibrium\nstate with high energy to an equilibrium state with lower energy, which can be\nsuitably described in closed form using a global Hamiltonian-like function.\nFrom this function we show that a perturbed system cannot always reach the\nequilibrium state predicted by quasi-steady-state cascade models, which would\ncorrespond to a reduced number of failures, and may instead undergo a larger\ncascade. We also show that in the presence of two or more perturbations, the\noutcome depends strongly on the order and timing of the individual\nperturbations. These results offer new insights into the current understanding\nof cascading dynamics, with potential implications for control interventions.\n", "  In this work we study theoretically the efficiency of a travelling magnon\nbased microwave to optical photon converter for applications in Quantum\nInformation (QI). The converter employs an epitaxially grown yttrium iron\ngarnet (YIG) film as the medium for propagation of travelling magnons (spin\nwaves). The conversion is achieved through coupling of magnons to guided\noptical modes of the film. The total microwave to optical photon conversion\nefficiency is found to be larger than in a similar process employing a YIG\nsphere by at least 4 orders of magnitude. By creating an optical resonator of a\nlarge length from the film (such that the traveling magnon decays before\nforming a standing wave over the resonator length) one will be able to further\nincrease the efficiency by several orders of magnitude, potentially reaching a\nvalue similar to achieved with opto-mechanical resonators. Also, as a spin-off\nresult, it is shown that isolation of more that 20 dB with direct insertion\nlosses about 5 dBm can be achieved with YIG film based microwave isolators for\napplications in Quantum Information.\n  An important advantage of the suggested concept of the QI devices based on\ntravelling spin waves is a perfectly planar geometry and a possibility of\nimplementing a the device as a hybrid opto-microwave chip.\n", "  We demonstrate an ultralow loss monolithic integrated lithium niobate\nphotonic platform consisting of dry-etched subwavelength waveguides. We show\nmicroring resonators with a quality factor of 10$^7$ and waveguides with\npropagation loss as low as 2.7 dB/m.\n", "  We report on the longitudinal and Hall resistivities of a HgTe quantum well\nwith inverted energy spectrum (dQW = 20.3 nm) measured in the quantum Hall (QH)\nregime at magnetic fields up to 9 T and temperatures 2-50 K. The temperature\ndependence of the QH plateau-plateau transition (PPT) widths and of variable\nrange hopping (VRH) conduction on the Hall plateaus are analyzed. The data are\npresented in a genuine scale form both for PPT regions and for VRH regime.\nEstimations for the degree of the carrier localization length divergence reveal\na decisive role of the long-range random potential (the potential of remote\nionized impurities) in the localization - delocalization processes in the QH\nregime for the system under study.\n", "  We demonstrate that the complete factorization of equations of motion into\nfirst-order differential equations can be obtained for real and complex scalar\nfield theories with non-canonical dynamics.\n", "  We prove a formula for the Hodge numbers of square-free divisors of\nCalabi-Yau threefold hypersurfaces in toric varieties. Euclidean branes\nwrapping divisors affect the vacuum structure of Calabi-Yau compactifications\nof type IIB string theory, M-theory, and F-theory. Determining the\nnonperturbative couplings due to Euclidean branes on a divisor $D$ requires\ncounting fermion zero modes, which depend on the Hodge numbers\n$h^i({\\cal{O}}_D)$. Suppose that $X$ is a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold\nhypersurface in a toric variety $V$, and let $D$ be the restriction to $X$ of a\nsquare-free divisor of $V$. We give a formula for $h^i({\\cal{O}}_D)$ in terms\nof combinatorial data. Moreover, we construct a CW complex $\\mathscr{P}_D$ such\nthat $h^i({\\cal{O}}_D)=h_i(\\mathscr{P}_D)$. We describe an efficient algorithm\nthat makes possible for the first time the computation of sheaf cohomology for\nsuch divisors at large $h^{1,1}$. As an illustration we compute the Hodge\nnumbers of a class of divisors in a threefold with $h^{1,1}=491$. Our results\nare a step toward a systematic computation of Euclidean brane superpotentials\nin Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.\n", "  Quantum technologies could largely benefit from the control of quantum\nemitters in sub-micrometric size crystals. These are naturally prone to the\nintegration in hybrid devices, including heterostructures and complex photonic\ndevices. Currently available quantum emitters sculpted in nanocrystals suffer\nfrom spectral instability, preventing their use as single photon sources e.g.,\nfor most quantum optics operations. In this work we report on unprecedented\nperformances of single-photon emission from organic nanocrystals (average size\nof hundreds \\SI{}{\\nano\\meter}), made of anthracene (Ac) and doped with\ndibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules. The source has hours-long photostability with\nrespect to frequency and intensity, both at room and at cryogenic temperature.\nWhen cooled down to \\SI{3}{K}, the 00-zero phonon line shows linewidth values\n(\\SI{50}{MHz}) close to the lifetime-limit. Such optical properties in a\nnanocrystalline environment make the proposed organic nanocrystals a unique\nsingle-photon source for integrated photonic quantum technologies.\n", "  The heat flux across a nanowire is computed based on the Guyer-Krumhansl\nequation. Slip conditions with a slip length depending on both temperature and\nnanowire radius are introduced at the outer boundary. An explicit expression\nfor the effective thermal conductivity is derived and compared to existing\nmodels across a given temperature range, providing excellent agreement with\nexperimental data for Si nanowires.\n", "  We measured Electron Energy Distribution Functions (EEDFs) from below 200 eV\nto over 8 keV and spanning five orders-of-magnitude in intensity, produced in a\nlow-power, RF-heated, tandem mirror discharge in the PFRC-II apparatus. The\nEEDF was obtained from the x-ray energy distribution function (XEDF) using a\nnovel Poisson-regularized spectrum inversion algorithm applied to pulse-height\nspectra that included both Bremsstrahlung and line emissions. The XEDF was\nmeasured using a specially calibrated Amptek Silicon Drift Detector (SDD)\npulse-height system with 125 eV FWHM at 5.9 keV.\n", "  Ultracold gases are a versatile platform to simulate condensed matter\nphysics, as virtually any parameter is experimentally tunable. In particular,\nhighly anisotropic traps allow the realization of low-dimensional systems,\nwhere the role of quantum fluctuations is enhanced. I investigate the\nparadigmatic model of a one-dimensional Bose gas with contact interactions,\na.k.a the Lieb-Liniger model, using powerful analytical tools such as Bethe\nAnsatz, Conformal Field Theory and the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid formalism, as\nwell as the Bose-Fermi mapping. The effect of an additional harmonic trap in\nthe longitudinal direction is studied within the Local Density Approximation.\nThese methods allow to investigate with high accuracy its ground-state\nthermodynamics of the gas, its excitation spectra and correlation functions,\nfrom the k-body local correlations to the momentum distribution and the\ndynamical structure factor. These quantities characterize the coherence and\nsuperfluidity of the gas. In particular, I study the drag force exerted by a\nweak gaussian barrier stirred into the gas within linear response theory. Then,\nI investigate the appearance of a multimode structure obtained by releasing a\ntransverse trapping, and the dimensional crossover in the limit of an infinite\nnumber of transverse modes.\n", "  By combining cosmological probes at low, intermediate and high redshifts, we\ninvestigate the observational viability of a class of models with interaction\nin the dark sector. We perform a Bayesian analysis using the latest data sets\nof type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, the angular acoustic scale\nof the cosmic microwave background, and measurements of the expansion rate.\nWhen combined with the current measurement of the local expansion rate obtained\nby the Hubble Space Telescope, we find that these observations provide evidence\nin favour of interacting models with respect to the standard cosmology.\n", "  Due to advancements in nanomagnetism and latest nanomagnetic materials and\ndevices, a new potential field has been opened up for research and applications\nwhich was not possible before. We herein propose a new research field and\napplication for nanomagnetism for the visualization of dynamic magnetic fields\nin real-time. In short, Nano Magnetic Vision. A new methodology, technique and\napparatus were invented and prototyped in order to demonstrate and test this\nnew application. As an application example the visualization of the dynamic\nmagnetic field on a transmitting antenna was chosen. Never seen before\nhigh-resolution, photos and real-time color video revealing the actual dynamic\nmagnetic field inside a transmitting radio antenna rod has been captured for\nthe first time. The antenna rod is fed with six hundred volts, orthogonal\npulses. This unipolar signal is in the very low frequency (i.e. VLF) range. The\nsignal combined with an extremely short electrical length of the rod, ensures\nthe generation of a relatively strong fluctuating magnetic field, analogue to\nthe signal transmitted, along and inside the antenna. This field is induced\ninto a ferrolens and becomes visible in real-time within the normal human eyes\nfrequency spectrum. The name we have given to the new observation apparatus is,\nSPIONs Superparamagnetic Ferrolens Microscope (SSFM), a powerful passive\nscientific observation tool with many other potential applications in the near\nfuture.\n", "  We present a translation of the German text of an 1874 article by Valentin\nRose that concerns the possible school of translators that worked in Toledo,\nSpain, from about 1150 to 1250. Rose's article relies significantly on the\nfirst-hand account of the activities in Toledo by the Englishman Daniel of\nMorley. The most prolific translator in Toledo was Gerard of Cremona, who\ntranslated Ptolemy's Almagest from Arabic into Latin with the help of Galib the\nMozarab; this translation was significant to Copernicus's work. Georg Peurbach\nand Regiomontanus based their Epitome of the Almagest (1463) on Gerard's\ntranslation, which in turn introduced Greek astronomy to astronomers in Italy\nand throughout Europe. Copernicus studied in Padua in the first few years of\nthe sixteenth century, where he learned about Ptolemy's Almagest. Copernicus's\nbook De Revolutionibus (1543) also contains two geometrical tools of\nastronomers from thirteenth century Maragha, and his model of the motion of the\nMoon is mathematically identical to that of Ibn al-Shatir (fourteenth century\nDamascus). A Greek language manuscript written prior to 1308, and the residence\nin Padua of Moses Galeano, a Jewish scholar from Constantinople and Crete, who\nwas familiar with the work of Ibn al-Shatir, provide evidence of the\ntransmission of Arabic astronomical ideas to Copernicus. We have only begun to\nunderstand this conduit of transmission.\n", "  Leakage errors damage a qubit by coupling it to other levels. Over the years,\nseveral theoretical approaches to dealing with such errors have been developed\nbased on perturbation arguments. Here we propose a different strategy: we use a\nsequence of finite rotation gates to exactly eliminate leakage errors. The\nstrategy is illustrated by the recently proposed charge quadrupole qubit in a\ntriple quantum dot, where there are two logical states to support the qubit and\none leakage state. We have found an su(2) subalgebra in the three-level system,\nand by using the subalgebra we show that ideal Pauli x and z rotations, which\nare universal for single-qubit gates, can be generated by two or three\npropagators of experimentally-available Hamiltonians. The proposed strategy\ndoes not require additional pulses, is independent of error magnitude, and\npotentially reduces experimental overheads. In addition, the magnitude of\ndetuning fluctuation can be estimated based on the exact solution.\n", "  We consider the relativistic ion-acoustic mode in a plasma composed by cold\nions and an ultra-degenerate electron gas, described the relativistic\nVlasov-Poisson system. A critical examination of popular fluid models for\nrelativistic ion-acoustic waves is provided, comparing kinetic and hydrodynamic\nresults. The kinetic linear dispersion relation is shown to be reproduced by\nthe rigorous relativistic hydrodynamic equations with Chandrasekhar's equation\nof state.\n", "  We introduce the new concept of D-geometry (or \"drum geometry\"), which has\nbeen recently discovered by the author in \\cite{KT-DRUMS} when constructing and\nclassifying isospectral and length equivalent drums under certain constraints.\nWe will show that any pair of length equivalent domains, and in particular any\npair of isospectral domains (which makes one unable to \"hear the shape of\ndrums\") which is constructed by the famous Gassmann-Sunada method, naturally\ndefines a D-geometry, and that each D-geometry gives rise to such domains. One\ngoal of this letter is to show that in the present theory of isospectral and\nlength equivalent drums, many examples are controlled by finite geometrical\nphenomena in a very precise sense.\n", "  Exoplanets smaller than Neptune are numerous, but the nature of the planet\npopulations in the 1-4 Earth radii range remains a mystery. The complete Kepler\nsample of Q1-Q17 exoplanet candidates shows a radius gap at ~ 2 Earth radii, as\nreported by us in January 2017 in LPSC conference abstract #1576 (Zeng et al.\n2017). A careful analysis of Kepler host stars spectroscopy by the CKS survey\nallowed Fulton et al. (2017) in March 2017 to unambiguously show this radius\ngap. The cause of this gap is still under discussion (Ginzburg et al. 2017;\nLehmer & Catling 2017; Owen & Wu 2017). Here we add to our original analysis\nthe dependence of the radius gap on host star type.\n", "  Evidence of a supernova event, discussed in Wallner et al., was discovered in\nthe deep-sea crusts with two signals dating back to 2-3 and 7-9 Myr ago. In\nthis contribution, we place constraints on the birth-site of the supernova\nprogenitors from the ejecta timeline, the initial mass function, and the ages\nof nearby stellar groups. We investigated the Scorpius-Centaurus OB\nAssociation, the nearest site of recent massive star formation, and the moving\ngroup Tucana-Horologium. Using the known stellar mass of the remaining massive\nstars within these subgroups and factoring in travel time for the ejecta, we\nhave constrained the ages and masses of the supernova progenitors by using the\ninitial mass function and then compared the results to the canonical ages of\neach subgroup. Our results identify the Upper Scorpius and Lower Centaurus-Crux\nsubgroups as unlikely birth-sites for these supernovae. We find that\nTucana-Horologium is the likely birth-site of the supernova 7-9 Myr ago and\nUpper Centaurus-Lupus is the likely birth-site for the supernova 2-3 Myr ago.\n", "  We present a novel method for calculating interface curvature on 3D\nunstructured meshes from piecewise-linear interface reconstructions typically\ngenerated in the volume of fluid method. Interface curvature is a necessary\nquantity to calculate in order to model surface tension driven flow. Curvature\nneeds only to be computed in cells containing an interface. The approach\nrequires a stencil containing only neighbors sharing a node with a target cell,\nand calculates curvature from a least-squares paraboloid fit to the interface\nreconstructions. This involves solving a 6x6 symmetric linear system in each\nmixed cell. We present verification tests where we calculate the curvature of a\nsphere, an ellipsoid, and a sinusoid in a 3D domain on regular Cartesian\nmeshes, distorted hex meshes, and tetrahedral meshes. For both regular and\nunstructured meshes, we find in all cases the paraboloid fitting method for\ncurvature to converge between first and second order with grid refinement.\n", "  Ge-on-Si structures with three different dopants (P, As and B) and those\nwithout intentional doping were grown and annealed. Several different materials\ncharacterization methods have been performed to characterize the Ge film\nquality. All samples have a smooth surface (roughness < 1.5 nm), and the Ge\nfilms are almost entirely relaxed. On the other hand, B doped Ge films have\nthreading dislocations above 1 x 10^8 cm-2. While P and As doping can reduce\nthe threading dislocation density to be less than 10^6 cm-2 without annealing.\nThe interdiffusion of Si and Ge of different films have been investigated\nexperimentally and theoretically. A quantitative model of Si-Ge interdiffusion\nunder extrinsic conditions across the full x_Ge range and with the dislocation\nmediated diffusion term was established. The Kirkendall effect has been\nobserved. The results are of technical significance for the structure, doping,\nand process design of Ge-on-Si based devices, especially for photonic\napplications.\n", "  We study a formulation of Burgers equation on the Sierpinski gasket, which is\nthe prototype of a p.c.f. self-similar fractal. One possibility is to implement\nBurgers equation as a semilinear heat equation associated with the Laplacian\nfor scalar functions, just as on the unit interval. Here we propose a second,\ndifferent formulation which follows from the Cole-Hopf transform and is\nassociated with the Laplacian for vector fields. The difference between these\ntwo equations can be understood in terms of different vertex conditions for\nLaplacians on metric graphs. For the second formulation we show existence and\nuniqueness of solutions and verify the continuous dependence on the initial\ncondition. We also prove that solutions on the Sierpinski gasket can be\napproximated in a weak sense by solutions to corresponding equations on\napproximating metric graphs. These results are part of a larger program\ndiscussing nonlinear partial differential equations on fractal spaces.\n", "  We study the mechanism of instability in transition edge sensor (TES)\nbolometers used for ground based observations of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) at 270GHz. The instability limits the range of useful\noperating resistances of the TES down to $\\approx$ 50% of $R_n$, and due to\nvariations in detector properties and optical loading within a column of\nmultiplexed detectors, limits the effective on sky yield. Using measurements of\nthe electrical impedance of the detectors, we show the instability is due to\nthe increased bolometer leg $G$ for higher-frequency detection inducing\ndecoupling of the palladium-gold heat capacity from the thermistor. We\ndemonstrate experimentally that the limiting thermal resistance is due to the\nsmall cross sectional area of the silicon nitride bolometer island, and so is\neasily fixed by layering palladium-gold over an oxide protected TES. The\nresulting detectors can be biased down to a resistance $\\approx$10% of $R_n$.\n", "  A novel mechanism to realize dynamically tunable electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) analogue in the terahertz (THz) regime is proposed. By\nputting the electrically controllable monolayer graphene under the dark\nresonator, the amplitude of the EIT resonance in the metal-based metamaterial\ncan be modulated substantially via altering the Fermi level of graphene. The\namplitude modulation can be attributed to the change in the damping rate of the\ndark mode caused by the recombination effect of the conductive graphene. This\nwork provides an alternative way to achieve tunable slow light effect and has\npotential applications in THz wireless communications.\n", "  The phenomena of strong running coupling and hadron mass generating have been\nstudied in the framework of a QCD-inspired relativistic model of quark-gluon\ninteraction with infrared confined propagators. We derived a meson mass\nequation and revealed a specific new behaviour of the mass-dependent strong\ncoupling $\\hat\\alpha_s(M)$ defined in the time-like region. A new infrared\nfreezing point $\\hat\\alpha_s(0)=1.03198$ at origin has been found and it did\nnot depend on the confinement scale $\\Lambda>0$. Independent and new estimates\non the scalar glueball mass, 'radius' and gluon condensate value have been\nperformed. The spectrum of conventional mesons have been calculated by\nintroducing a minimal set of parameters: the masses of constituent quarks and\n$\\Lambda$. The obtained values are in good agreement with the latest\nexperimental data with relative errors less than 1.8 percent. Accurate\nestimates of the leptonic decay constants of pseudoscalar and vector mesons\nhave been performed.\n", "  We examine here a hitherto unchartered Ericsson motor, operating in the\nquantum domain. The engine is a nanoscopic system of an electron trapped in a\ntwo-dimensional parabolic well and further subjected to an external magnetic\nfield in the third direction. The quantum-coherent cyclotron motion of the\nelectron is de-cohered due to strong interaction with a dissipative quantum\nheat bath.The calculation employs two different approaches - exact functional\nintegral representation of the partition function and quantum Langevin\nequations for the operators of the system. Though in equilibrium, both the\napproaches yield equivalent expressions for the efficiency, the Langevin method\nopens up further avenues for investigating time dependent properties of the\nnano motor.\n", "  An exact formulation of the propagation of a monochromatic wave packet\nimpinging upon a transparent, homogeneous, isotropic and parallel slab at\noblique incidence is presented. Approximate formulas are derived for low\ndivergence Gaussian light beams. These formulas show the presence of anomalous\nrefraction phenomena at any slab thickness, including negative refraction and\nflat lensing effects, induced by the reflection on the rear face.\n", "  In this work, we investigated the feasibility of applying deep learning\ntechniques to solve Poisson's equation. A deep convolutional neural network is\nset up to predict the distribution of electric potential in 2D or 3D cases.\nWith proper training data generated from a finite difference solver, the strong\napproximation capability of the deep convolutional neural network allows it to\nmake correct prediction given information of the source and distribution of\npermittivity. With applications of L2 regularization, numerical experiments\nshow that the predication error of 2D cases can reach below 1.5\\% and the\npredication of 3D cases can reach below 3\\%, with a significant reduction in\nCPU time compared with the traditional solver based on finite difference\nmethods.\n", "  In this paper, we briefly introduce physical foundations of electromigration\n(EM) and present a few classical EMrelated theories. We discuss physical\nparameters affecting EM wire lifetime and we introduce some background related\nto the existing EM physical simulators. In our work, for EM physical simulation\nwe adopt the atomic concentration balance-based model. We discuss the\nsimulation setup and results. We present a variation-aware electromigration\n(EM) analysis tool for power grid wires. The tool considers process variations\ncaused by the chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) and edge placement error\n(EPE). It uses a compact model that features critical region extraction and\nvariation coefficient calculation.\n", "  We developed a method to classify volcanic ash samples by introducing\nstatistically determined grain types. Using more than 10,000 numbers of\nautomatically measured grain data (parameters of grain shape and transparency)\nand the cluster analysis, we made grain types without human eyes. By components\nof the grain type in each samples, we classified samples from types of basaltic\nmonogenetic volcanoes: 1) Funabara scoria cone, Izu Peninsula, Japan (magmatic\neruption origin); 2) Nippana tuff ring, Miyakejima, Japan (phreatomagmatic\neruption origin); and 3) rootless cones in Myvatn, Iceland (rootless eruption\norigin). We tested two cases; using grain shape parameters only, and both of\ngrain shape parameters and transparency values. It is found that the sample\nclassification is more consistent with their eruption style in the case of\nusing both parameters of grain shape and transparency. By sampling several\nlayers of an outcrop, this procedure can be used to interpret changes in\neruption/fragmentation style during a volcanic event. Furthermore, this\nprocedure might be applicable to other aims such as sedimentology and planetary\nscience.\n", "  The ridge signal, which is long-ranged in rapidity, in the di-hadron\ncorrelations in high-multiplicity p-p and p-A collisions opened up a whole new\nresearch area in high-energy QCD. Although the ridge had been observed in A-A\ncollisions and interpreted as a result of the radial flow of quark-gluon\nplasma, it had not appeared until recently in the data of small collision\nsystems such as p-p and p-A, nor had it been predicted theoretically or seen in\nthe event generators. There are two competing approaches that attempt to\nexplain the systematics of the di-hadron ridge signal; hydrodynamics and gluon\nsaturation physics (color glass condensate/glasma). In this work, we present\npredictions for the transverse momentum and rapidity dependence of the\nthree-particle correlation function within the gluon saturation physics.\nTri-hadron correlations can be measured, and the data can possibly rule out one\nof the two alternative approaches.\n", "  The evolution of RHEED reflexes intensity during reconstructed transitions\ncharacterizes (often implicitly) reconstructed surface state peculiarities. The\napproaches of a correct RHEED data interpretation, aimed at obtaining\ninformation about reconstructed transitions kinetics, are considered in the\npresent work. In particular, the nature of RHEED reflexes formation, depending\non such parameters as the average size of reconstructed domains and number of\nsuch domains per area unit, is analyzed within the kinematic approximation of\nthe diffraction theory. This geometrical description is a convenient and\neffective (productive) way of analyzing reconstructed transitions mechanisms\nand parameters. The transformation of the functional dependence between the\nmeasured values (RHEED reflexes intensity picture) and the degree of surface\ncoverage by reconstruction domains, at a change of these domains average size\nand distribution density, is shown. This work provides the community with a\nuseful framework for such type of theoretical studies.\n", "  We show how to describe the diffusion of the quantized angular momentum\nvector of an arbitrarily shaped rigid rotor as induced by its collisional\ninteraction with an environment. We present the general form of the\nLindblad-type master equation and relate it to the orientational decoherence of\nan asymmetric nanoparticle in the limit of small anisotropies. The\ncorresponding diffusion coefficients are derived for gas particles scattering\noff large molecules and for ambient photons scattering off dielectric\nparticles, using the elastic scattering amplitudes.\n", "  Non-thermal magnetospheric processes in the vicinity of supermassive black\nholes have attracted particular attention in recent times. Gap-type particle\nacceleration accompanied by curvature and Inverse Compton radiation could in\nprinciple lead to variable gamma-ray emission that may be detectable with\ncurrent instruments. We shortly comment on the occurrence of magnetospheric\ngaps and the realisation of different potentials. The detection of rapid\nvariability becomes most instructive by imposing a constraint on possible gap\nsizes, thereby limiting extractable gap powers and allowing to assess the\nplausibility of a magnetospheric origin. The relevance of this is discussed for\nthe radio galaxies Cen A, M87 and IC310. The detection of magnetospheric\ngamma-ray emission generally allows for a sensitive probe of the\nnear-black-hole region and is thus of prime interest for advancing our\nunderstanding of the (astro)physics of extreme environments\n", "  The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon by which an electric current\ndevelops in the direction of a magnetic field applied to a material. Recent\ntheoretical research suggests that the CME can be observed in thermal\nequilibrium provided that the magnetic field oscillates with finite frequency\n$\\omega$. Moreover, under certain conditions the amplitude of the electric\ncurrent does not vanish in the adiabatic $\\omega \\to 0$ limit, which we call\nhere the adiabatic CME. In this work, we consider an adiabatic CME in a bounded\nsample. We demonstrate that the presence of the boundary significantly changes\nthe nature of the effect. Using linear response theory, we derive a simple\nformula (conjectured earlier in arXiv:1512.02144) that enables us to describe\nthe CME in a bounded setting based on the knowledge of the energy levels alone.\nWe use this formula to investigate a particularly interesting example of the\nCME completely defined by the boundary effects.\n", "  We study the strong and radiative decays of the radial excitation of the\n$\\rho$ meson, with quantum numbers $n$ $^{2S+1}L_{J}=2$ $^{3}S_{1},$ $I=1$, and\ndenoted as $\\rho_{E}$, by making use of an effective model. We test different\nmasses: $1.45$ GeV, corresponding to well known assignment\n$\\rho_{E}\\equiv\\rho(1450)$ state; $1.25$ GeV for the assignment $\\rho\n_{E}\\equiv\\rho(1250)$ (a resonance whose existence has not yet been confirmed),\nand $1.35$ GeV, which lies just in the middle between them in order to study\nthe dependence of the results on the mass. The decay widths for different decay\nprocesses and two branching ratios of the radially excited meson $\\rho_{E}$\nwere determined and compared to the experimental data reported in the Particle\nData Group.\n", "  The effect of the canting of local anisotropy axes on the ground-state phase\ndiagram and magnetization of a ferrimagnetic chain with regularly alternating\nIsing and Heisenberg spins is exactly examined in an arbitrarily oriented\nmagnetic field. It is shown that individual contributions of Ising and\nHeisenberg spins to the total magnetization basically depend on the spatial\norientation of the magnetic field and the canting angle between two different\nlocal anisotropy axes of the Ising spins.\n", "  Cs2CuCl4 is known to possess a quantum spin liquid phase with\nantiferromagnetic interaction below 2.8 K. We report the observation of a new\nmetastable magnetic phase of the triangular frustrated quantum spin system\nCs2CuCl4 induced by the application of hydrostatic pressure. We measured the\nmagnetic properties of Cs2CuCl4 following the application and release of\npressure after 3 days. We observed a previously unknown ordered magnetic phase\nwith a transition temperature of 9 K. Furthermore, the recovered sample with\nnew magnetic ground state possesses an equivalent crystal structure to the\nuncompressed one with antiferromagnetic quantum spin liquid phase.\n", "  The interface between two-dimensional semiconductors and metal contacts is an\nimportant topic of research of nanoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional\nsemiconducting materials such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). We report\ntransport properties of thin MoS2 flakes in a field-effect transistor geometry\nwith Ti/Au and Al contacts. In contrast to widely used Ti/Au contacts, the\nconductance of flakes with Al contacts exhibits a smaller gate-voltage\ndependence, which is consistent with a substantial electron doping effect of\nthe Al contacts. The temperature dependence of two-terminal conductance for the\nAl contacts is also considerably smaller than for the Ti/Au contacts, in which\nthermionic emission and thermally assisted tunneling play a dominant role. This\nresult is explained in terms of the assumption that the carrier injection\nmechanism at an Al contact is dominated by tunneling that is not thermally\nactivated.\n", "  We present a general purpose, parton-level Monte Carlo program for the\ncalculation of the radiative ($L\\to\\nu\\bar\\nu l+\\gamma$) and rare\n($L\\to\\nu\\bar\\nu l'+ l^+l^-$) muon and tau decays at NLO in the effective Fermi\ntheory. In the case of muon, these processes are irreducible Standard Model\nbackgrounds to searches for lepton flavour violation at the PSI experiments MEG\nand Mu3e as they become indistinguishable from the corresponding signals when\nthe neutrinos carry little energy.\n  Furthermore, we argue that fully differential NLO corrections are very\nimportant for the analysis of measurements aiming at the percent level or\nbetter. This is especally true if very stringent phase-space cuts are applied.\nTo illustrate this, we use a tension between BaBar's recent measurement of the\nradiative tau decay and the Standard Model prediction as an example of such an\nanalysis. Finally, we present the branching ratios of the rare tau decay\n$\\tau\\to\\nu\\bar\\nu l' l^+l^-$ at NLO.\n  We generally find that QED corrections of $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ are very well\npossible.\n", "  New ab-initio surface hopping simulations of the excited state dynamics of\nCS$_2$ including spin-orbit coupling are compared to new experimental\nmeasurements using a multiphoton ionisation probe in a photoelectron\nspectroscopy experiment. The calculations highlight the importance of the\ntriplet states even in the very early time dynamics of the dissociation process\nand allow us to unravel the signatures in the experimental spectrum, linking\nthe observed changes to both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom within\nthe molecule.\n", "  We explore the classical communication over quantum channels with one sender\nand two receivers, or with two senders and one receiver, First, for the quantum\nbroadcast channel (QBC) and the quantum multi-access channel (QMAC), we study\nthe classical communication assisted by non-signalling and\npositive-partial-transpose-preserving codes, and obtain efficiently computable\none-shot bounds to assess the performance of classical communication. Second,\nwe consider the asymptotic communication capability of communication over the\nQBC and QMAC. We derive an efficiently computable strong converse bound for the\ncapacity region, which behaves better than the previous semidefinite\nprogramming strong converse bound for point-to-point channels. Third, we obtain\na converse bound on the one-shot capacity region based on the hypothesis\ntesting divergence between the given channel and a certain class of\nsubchannels. As applications, we analyze the communication performance for some\nbasic network channels, including the classical broadcast channels and a\nspecific class of quantum broadcast channels.\n", "  A new neutrino magnetohydrodynamics (NMHD) model is formulated, where the\neffects of the charged weak current on the electron-ion magnetohydrodynamic\nfluid are taken into account. The model incorporates in a systematic way the\nrole of the Fermi neutrino weak force in magnetized plasmas. A fast\nneutrino-driven short wavelengths instability associated with the magnetosonic\nwave is derived. Such an instability should play a central role in strongly\nmagnetized plasma as occurs in supernovae, where dense neutrino beams also\nexist. In addition, in the case of nonlinear or high frequency waves, the\nneutrino coupling is shown to be responsible for breaking the frozen-in\nmagnetic field lines condition even in infinite conductivity plasmas.\nSimplified and ideal NMHD assumptions were adopted and analyzed in detail.\n", "  The dissociation dynamics of the $\\tilde{A}$-state of ammonia have been\nstudied using a resonant multiphoton ionisation probe in a photoelectron\nspectroscopy experiment. The use of a resonant intermediate in the multiphoton\nionisation process changes the ionisation propensity, allowing access to\ndifferent ion states when compared with equivalent single photon ionisation\nexperiments. Ionisation through the $E'$ $^1$A$_1'$ Rydberg intermediate means\nwe maintain overlap with the ion state for an extended period allowing us to\nmonitor the excited state population for several hundred femtoseconds. The\nvibrational states in the photoelectron spectrum show two distinct timescales,\n200 fs and 320 fs, that we assign to the non-adiabatic and adiabatic\ndissociation processes respectively. The different timescales derive from\ndifferences in the wavepacket trajectories for the two dissociation pathways\nthat resonantly excite different vibrational states in the intermediate Rydberg\nstate. The timescales are similar to those obtained from time resolved ion\nkinetic energy release measurements, suggesting we can measure the different\ntrajectories taken out to the region of conical intersection.\n", "  Hydrogen bonding interactions between biological chromophores and their\nsurrounding protein and solvent environment significantly affect the\nphotochemical pathways of the chromophore and its biological function. A common\nfirst step in the dynamics of these systems is excited state proton transfer\nbetween the non-covalently bound molecules, which stabilises the system against\ndissociation and principally alters relaxation pathways. Despite such\nfundamental importance, studying excited state proton transfer across a\nhydrogen bond has proven difficult, leaving uncertainties about the mechanism.\nThrough time-resolved photoelectron imaging measurements we demonstrate how the\naddition of a single hydrogen bond and the opening of an excited state proton\ntransfer channel dramatically changes the outcome of a photochemical reaction,\nfrom rapid dissociation in the isolated chromophore, to efficient stabilisation\nand ground state recovery in the hydrogen bonded case, and uncover the\nmechanism of excited state proton transfer at a hydrogen bond, which follows\nsequential hydrogen and charge transfer processes.\n", "  Using a variation of the celebrated Volkov solution, the Klein-Gordon\nequation for a charged particle is reduced to a set of ordinary differential\nequations, exactly solvable in specific cases. The new quantum relativistic\nstructures can reveal a localization in the radial direction perpendicular to\nthe wave packet propagation, thanks to a non-vanishing scalar potential. The\nexternal electromagnetic field, the particle current density and the charge\ndensity are determined. The stability analysis of the solutions is performed by\nmeans of numerical simulations. The results are useful for the description of a\ncharged quantum test particle in the relativistic regime, provided spin effects\nare not decisive.\n", "  How many bits of information can a single photon carry? Intuition says \"one\",\nbut this is incorrect. With an alphabet based on the photon's time of arrival,\nenergy, and polarization, several bits can be encoded. In this introduction to\nphoton information efficiency, we explain how to calculate the maximum number\nof bits per photon depending on the number of encoding modes, noise, and\nlosses.\n", "  Data from the NASA Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission are used to\ninvestigate asymmetric magnetic reconnection at the dayside boundary between\nthe Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind (the magnetopause).\nHigh-resolution measurements of plasmas, electric and magnetic fields, and\nwaves are used to identify highly localized (~15 electron Debye lengths)\nstanding wave structures with large electric-field amplitudes (up to 100 mV/m).\nThese wave structures are associated with spatially oscillatory dissipation,\nwhich appears as alternatingly positive and negative values of J dot E\n(dissipation). For small guide magnetic fields the wave structures occur in the\nelectron stagnation region at the magnetosphere edge of the EDR. For larger\nguide fields the structures also occur near the reconnection x-line. This\ndifference is explained in terms of channels for the out-of-plane current\n(agyrotropic electrons at the stagnation point and guide-field-aligned\nelectrons at the x-line).\n", "  Magneto-optical phenomena such as the Faraday and Kerr effects play a\ndecisive role for establishing control over polarization and intensity of\noptical fields propagating through a medium. Intensity effects where the\ndirection of light emission depends on the orientation of the external magnetic\nfield are of particular interest as they can be used for routing the light. We\nreport on a new class of transverse emission phenomena for light sources\nlocated in the vicinity of a surface, where directionality is established\nperpendicularly to the externally applied magnetic field. We demonstrate the\nrouting of emission for excitons in a diluted-magnetic-semiconductor quantum\nwell. The directionality is significantly enhanced in hybrid plasmonic\nsemiconductor structures due to the generation of plasmonic spin fluxes at the\nmetal-semiconductor interface.\n", "  Entropy and order parameter are two key concepts in phase transition theory.\nThis paper proposes an unified method to both find order parameter and estimate\nentropy automatically with unsupervised learning. The contributions of this\npaper are threefold: First, it is shown that the cross-entropy loss of an\noptimum autoencoder could be used to estimate the physical entropy, which also\nexplains why the critical temperature can be identified by the inflection point\nof the reconstruction loss. Second, a series of interpretable autoencoders are\nproposed which reproduce the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (F/AF) order\nparameter in special cases. They provide us an intuitive prototype to\nunderstand the connection between unsupervised learning and phase transition\ntheory. Third, we analyze spin glass phase with our method, the results suggest\na \"distributed\" order parameter to describe spin-glass ground state, which is a\nnatural generalization of F/AF order parameter with respect to the autoencoder.\n", "  The recent concept of {\\em relativistic positioning system} (RPS) has opened\nthe possibility of making Relativity the {\\em general standard frame} in which\nto state any physical problem, theoretical or experimental.\n  Because the velocity of propagation of the information is finite, {\\em\nepistemic relativity} proposes to integrate the physicist as a real component\nof every physical problem, taking into account explicitly {\\em what}\ninformation, {\\em when} and {\\em where}, the physicist is able to know. This\nleads naturally to the concept of {\\em relativistic stereometric system} (RSS),\nallowing to measure the intrinsic properties of physical systems. Together,\nRPSs and RSSs complete the notion of {\\em laboratory} in general relativity,\nallowing to perform experiments in finite regions of any space-time.\n  Epistemic relativity incites the development of relativity in new open\ndirections: advanced studies in RPSs and RSSs, intrinsic characterization of\ngravitational fields, composition laws for them, construction of a\nfinite-differential geometry adapted to RPSs and RSSs, covariant approximation\nmethods, etc. Some of these directions are sketched here, and some open\nproblems are posed. \\end{abstract} \\noindent I want the organizers of this\nseminar, Dirk P\\\"utzfeld and Claus L\\\"ammerzahl, to know how much I appreciated\ntheir inviting me to talk about my ideas on this subject. It is also a pleasure\nto thanks the Wilhelm und Else Heraeus-Stiftung for their kind hospitality.\n", "  (Ga,Mn)As in wurtzite crystal structure, is coherently grown by molecular\nbeam epitaxy on the {1100} side facets of wurtizte (Ga,In)As nanowires and\nfurther encapsulated by (Ga,Al)As and low temperature GaAs. For the first time\na true long-range ferromagnetic magnetic order is observed in non-planar\n(Ga,Mn)As, which is attributed to a more effective hole confinement in the\nshell containing Mn by a proper selection/choice of both the core and outer\nshell materials.\n", "  Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to \"weightless\"\nor reduced gravity conditions experienced in space or on planetary surfaces,\ne.g. the Moon or Mars. These flights facilitate fundamental research - from\nmaterials science to space biology - and testing/validation activities that\nsupport and complement infrequent and costly access to space. While parabolic\nflights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and\nprocessing methods are not widely available - yet are critical for assessing\nthe results of these activities. Here we present a method for collecting,\nanalyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during\na parabolic flight. We validated this method using a commercially available\naccelerometer during a Boeing 727-200F flight with $20$ parabolas. All data and\nanalysis code are freely available. Our solution can be easily integrated with\na variety of experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer\norientation, and allows for unsupervised and repeatable classification of all\nphases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to\nquantifying gravito-intertial accelerations (GIA), or $g$ levels. As academic,\ngovernmental, and commercial use of space increases, data availability and\nvalidated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and\nanalysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus, facilitate future space\nactivities.\n", "  Since the developpment of astronephography, we know that the Sun is about to\nexit the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC). To date, because of its rare\nabsorption signatures and the paucity of suitable neighbour targets, the LIC\ninterface has proved to be elusive to extensive investigations. Comparing the\nspatial distribution of Si III detections found in the litterature along with 3\nnew sigtlines, I show that most detections seem to arise from a cone whose axis\nis parallel to the LIC heliocentric velocity vector. I interpret this result as\nan evidence that the heliosphere is actually interacting with the LIC frontier.\n", "  We describe the program pySecDec, which factorises endpoint singularities\nfrom multi-dimensional parameter integrals and can serve to calculate integrals\noccurring in higher order perturbative calculations numerically. We focus on\nthe new features and on frequently asked questions about the usage of the\nprogram.\n", "  Estimates of the photospheric magnetic, electric and plasma velocity fields\nare essential for studying the dynamics of the solar atmosphere, for example\nthrough the derivative quantities of Poynting and relative helicity flux and by\nusing of the fields to obtain the lower boundary condition for data-driven\ncoronal simulations. In this paper we study the performance of a data\nprocessing and electric field inversion approach that requires only\nhigh-resolution and high-cadence line-of-sight or vector magnetograms -- which\nwe obtain from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO). The approach does not require any photospheric velocity\nestimates, and the lacking velocity information is compensated using ad hoc\nassumptions. We show that the free parameters of these assumptions can be\noptimized to reproduce the time evolution of the total magnetic energy\ninjection through the photosphere in NOAA AR 11158, when compared to the recent\nestimates for this active region. However, we find that the relative magnetic\nhelicity injection is reproduced poorly reaching at best a modest\nunderestimation. We discuss also the effect of some of the data processing\ndetails on the results, including the masking of the noise-dominated pixels and\nthe tracking method of the active region, both of which have not received much\nattention in the literature so far. In most cases the effect of these details\nis small, but when the optimization of the free parameters of the ad hoc\nassumptions is considered a consistent use of the noise mask is required. The\nresults found in this paper imply that the data processing and electric field\ninversion approach that uses only the photospheric magnetic field information\noffers a flexible and straightforward way to obtain photospheric magnetic and\nelectric field estimates suitable for practical applications such as coronal\nmodeling studies.\n", "  Shocks produced by the accretion of infalling gas in the outskirt of galaxy\nclusters are expected in the hierarchical structure formation scenario, as\nfound in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Here, we report the detection\nof a shock front at a large radius in the pressure profile of the galaxy\ncluster A2319 at a significance of $8.6\\sigma$, using Planck thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich data. The shock is located at $(2.93 \\pm 0.05) \\times\nR_{500}$ and is not dominated by any preferential radial direction. Using a\nparametric model of the pressure profile, we derive a lower limit on the Mach\nnumber of the infalling gas, $\\mathcal{M} > 3.25$ at 95\\% confidence level.\nThese results are consistent with expectations derived from hydrodynamical\nsimulations. Finally, we use the shock location to constrain the accretion rate\nof A2319 to $\\dot{M} \\simeq (1.4 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{14}$ M$_\\odot$ Gyr$^{-1}$,\nfor a total mass, $M_{200} \\simeq 10^{15}$ M$_\\odot$.\n", "  Machine learning techniques have led to broad adoption of a statistical model\nof computing. The statistical distributions natively available on quantum\nprocessors are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this\nattribute has the potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning\nrelative to purely classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is\nlearning to hybridize classical computing resources and traditional learning\ntechniques with the emerging capabilities of general purpose quantum\nprocessors. Here, we demonstrate such hybridization by training a 19-qubit gate\nmodel processor to solve a clustering problem, a foundational challenge in\nunsupervised learning. We use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in\nconjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian optimization to train the quantum\nmachine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm shows robustness to realistic\nnoise, and we find evidence that classical optimization can be used to train\naround both coherent and incoherent imperfections.\n", "  We have performed direct numerical simulations (DNS) of compressible\nturbulent channel flow at supercritical pressure with top and bottom isothermal\nwalls kept respectively at a supercritical (Ttop > Tpb) and subcritical\ntemperature (Tbot < Tpb), where Tpb is the pseudoboiling temperature. The DNS\nare conducted using a high-order discretization of the fully compressible\nNavier-Stokes equations in conservative form closed with the Peng-Robinsion\n(PR) state equation. Bulk density is adjusted to obtain a bulk pressure of\napproximately pb = 1.1pcr where pcr is the critical pressure of the working\nfluid. Top-to-bottom temperature differences investigated are DT = 5 K, 10 K,\nand 20 K, where Ttop/bot = Tpb +- DT / 2; buoyancy effects are neglected.\nVarying DT modifies the average location of pseudophase change from ypb/h =\n-0.23 (DT = 5 K) to 0.89 (DT = 20 K), where h is the channel half-height and y\n= 0 the centerline position. Real-fluid effects cause visible deviations from\nclassical scaling laws in the mean velocity profile. Enstrophy generation due\nstretching and tilting decreases with DT. The proximity to the\npseudotransitioning layer inhibits the intensity of the velocity fluctuations,\nwhile enhancing the density and temperature fluctuations. Conditional\nprobability analysis reveals that the sheet of fluid undergoing pseudophase\nchange is characterized by a dramatic reduction in the kurtosis of density\nfluctuations and becomes thinner as DT is increased. Instantaneous\nvisualizations show dense fluid ejections from the pseudoliquid viscous\nsublayer, some reaching the channel core, causing positive values of density\nskewness in the respective buffer-layer region (vice versa for the top wall).\n", "  Assuming the radiation emitted by an accelerating charge follows the Unruh\nradiation, we obtained the characteristics of the de Broglie wave associated\nwith the accelerating charge. The de Broglie wavelength of the accelerating\ncharged particle is found to be inversely proportional to the temperature of\nthe emitted radiation. Merging the Abraham-Lorentz and Unruh formulae shows\nthat the particle de Broglie wavelength is found to vary inversely with its\nacceleration. It is found to have the same structure as that of the Wien's\ndisplacement law relating the maximum wavelength of the Black Body radiation to\nits temperature. A maximum acceleration that a charged particle can attain is\nderived that sets a limit to the the maximum electric field. The\nAbraham-Lorentz force for a black hole radiation is found to be proportional to\nits evaporation rate. The final mass of the black hole left-over is found to be\n$\\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha\\hbar c}{24 \\pi G} }$, where $G$ is the gravitational\nconstant, $c$ the speed of light, $h=2\\pi\\hbar$ is the Planck constant, and\n$\\alpha$ is the fine structure constant. The minimum entropy and spin of the\nblack hole emitting Hawking radiation are, respectively, found to be\n$(\\alpha/6) k_B$ and $(\\alpha/6)\\hbar$. The presently observed universal\nacceleration is a manifestation of the Unruh black body temperature of\n$10^{-29}K$. This agrees with the black body radiation temperature ($T$)\nrelating $TR=const.$ prevailing since the time of the big bang, where $R$ is\nthe universe radius.\n", "  Forecasting the strength of the sunspot cycle is highly important for many\nspace weather applications. Our previous studies have shown the importance of\nsunspot number variability in the declining phase of the current 11-year\nsunspot cycle to predict the strength of the next cycle when the minimum of the\ncurrent cycle has been observed. In this study we continue this approach and\nshow that we can remove the limitation of having to know the minimum epoch of\nthe current cycle, and that we can already provide a forecast of the following\ncycle strength in the early stage of the declining phase of the current cycle.\nWe introduce a method to reliably calculate sunspot number second differences\n(SNSD) in order to quantify the short-term variations of sunspot activity. We\ndemonstrate a steady relationship between the SNSD dynamics in the early stage\nof the declining phase of a given cycle and the strength of the following\nsunspot cycle. This finding may bear physical implications on the underlying\ndynamo at work. From this relation, a relevant indicator is constructed that\ndistinguishes whether the next cycle will be stronger or weaker compared to the\ncurrent one. We demonstrate that within 24-31 months after reaching the maximum\nof the cycle, it can be decided with high probability (0.96) whether the next\ncycle will be weaker or stronger. We predict that sunspot cycle 25 will be\nweaker than the current cycle 24.\n", "  The need for high-throughput, precise, and meaningful methods for measuring\nbehavior has been amplified by our recent successes in measuring and\nmanipulating neural circuitry. The largest challenges associated with moving in\nthis direction, however, are not technical but are instead conceptual: what\nnumbers should one put on the movements an animal is performing (or not\nperforming)? In this review, I will describe how theoretical and data\nanalytical ideas are interfacing with recently-developed computational and\nexperimental methodologies to answer these questions across a variety of\ncontexts, length scales, and time scales. I will attempt to highlight\ncommonalities between approaches and areas where further advances are necessary\nto place behavior on the same quantitative footing as other scientific fields.\n", "  In preparation for deep extragalactic imaging with the James Webb Space\nTelescope, we explore the clustering of massive halos at $z=8$ and $10$ using a\nlarge N-body simulation. We find that halos with masses $10^9$ to $10^{11}$\n$h^{-1}\\;M_\\odot$, which are those expected to host galaxies detectable with\nJWST, are highly clustered with bias factors ranging from 5 and 30 depending\nstrongly on mass, as well as on redshift and scale. This results in correlation\nlengths of 5--10$h^{-1}\\;{\\rm Mpc}$, similar to that of today's galaxies. Our\nresults are based on a simulation of 130 billion particles in a box of\n$250h^{-1}\\;{\\rm Mpc}$ size using our new high-accuracy ABACUS simulation code,\nthe corrections to cosmological initial conditions of (Garrison et al. 2016,\n2016MNRAS.461.4125G), and the Planck 2015 cosmology. We use variations between\nsub-volumes to estimate the detectability of the clustering. Because of the\nvery strong inter-halo clustering, we find that surveys of order\n25$h^{-1}\\;{\\rm Mpc}$ comoving transverse size may be able to detect the\nclustering of $z=8$--$10$ galaxies with only 500-1000 survey objects if the\ngalaxies indeed occupy the most massive dark matter halos.\n", "  Our recent paper [Grauwin et al. Sci. Rep. 7 (2017)] demonstrates that\ncommunity and hierarchical structure of the networks of human interactions\nlargely determines the least and should be taken into account while modeling\nthem. In the present proof-of-concept pre-print the opposite question is\nconsidered: could the hierarchical structure itself be inferred to be best\naligned with the network model? The inference mechanism is provided for both -\nspatial networks as well as complex networks in general - through a model based\non hierarchical and (if defined) geographical distances. The mechanism allows\nto discover hierarchical and community structure at any desired resolution in\ncomplex networks and in particular - the space-independent structure of the\nspatial networks. The approach is illustrated on the example of the interstate\npeople migration network in USA.\n"]}
