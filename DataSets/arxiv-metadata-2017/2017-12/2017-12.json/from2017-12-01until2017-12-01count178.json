A sharp single NQR line is observed at the\nCu and Cl sites, indicating that both Cu and Cl atoms occupy a unique site.\nHowever, the electric field gradient tensors at the Cu, Cl, and La sites do not\nhave axial symmetry. This is incompatible with the reported crystal structure.\nThus the J1-J2 model has to be modified. We propose alternative two-dimensional\ndimer models based on the NMR, NQR, and TEM results. The value of the hyperfine\ncoupling constant at the Cu sites indicates that the spin density is mainly on\nthe d(3z2-r2) orbital (z parallel c). At 1.5 K, Cu- and Nb-NMR signals\ndisappear above the critical field Bc1 = 10.3 T determined from the onset of\nthe magnetization, indicating a field-induced magnetic phase transition at Bc1.\n", "  We report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies in the antiferromagnetic\nstate of the quasi-two-dimensional (CuBr)LaNb2O7. The NMR spectra at zero\nmagnetic field and 4.2 K indicate a unique Cu and Br sites with an internal\nfield of 5.7 T (at Cu) and 16.4 T (at Br), confirming a magnetic order. For the\nlarge internal field at the Br sites to be compatible with the collinear\nantiferromagnetic order observed by neutron diffraction experiments (N. Oba et\nal., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 75, (2006) 113601), the Br atoms must move\nsignificantly off the center of the square of the Cu sublattice so that the Br\nnuclei couple predominantly to two parallel Cu moments. While invalidating the\nfrustrated J1-J2 model defined on a C4-symmetric square lattice, our results\nare compatible with the structural model proposed for (CuCl)LaNb2O7 by Yoshida\net al. (J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76 (2007) 104703).\n", "  We report 51V-NMR study on a high-quality powder sample of volborthite\nCu3V2O7(OH)2/2H2O, a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a distorted kagome\nlattice formed by isosceles triangles. In the magnetic fields below 4.5 T, a\nsharp peak in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 accompanied with\nline broadening revealed a magnetic transition near 1 K. The low temperature\nphase shows anomalies such as a Lorentzian line shape, a 1/T1 propto T behavior\nindicating dense low energy excitations, and a large spin-echo decay rate 1/T2\npointing to unusually slow fluctuations. Another magnetic phase appears above\n4.5 T with less anomalous spectral shape and dynamics.\n", "  We report results of NMR experiments on the ruthenium oxide Hg2Ru2O7 with the\npyrochlore structure, which exhibits a metal-insulator transition at TMI = 107\nK. In the metallic phase above TMI, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate\n1/T1 and the Knight shift at the Hg sites follow the Korringa relation,\nindicating the absence of substantial spatial spin correlation. At low\ntemperatures in the insulating phase, 99,101Ru-NMR signals are observed at zero\nmagnetic field, providing evidence for a commensurate antiferromagnetic order.\nThe estimated ordered moment is about 1 muB per Ru, much smaller than 3 muB\nexpected for the ionic (4d)3plus configuration of Ru5plus. Thus the localized\nspin models are not appropriate for the insulating phase of Hg2Ru2O7. We also\ndiscuss possible antiferromagnetic spin structures.\n", "  We report results of 51V NMR in the field-induced phase of volborthite\nCu3V2O7(OH)dot2H2O, a spin-1/2 antiferromagnet on a distorted kagome lattice.\nIn magnetic fields above 4.5 T, two types of V sites with different spin-echo\ndecay rates are observed. The hyperfine field at the fast decaying sites has a\ndistribution, while it is more homogeneous at the slowly decaying sites. Our\nresults indicate a heterogeneous state consisting of two spatially alternating\nCu spin systems, one of which exhibits anomalous spin fluctuations contrasting\nwith the other showing a conventional static order.\n", "  We report results of 51V NMR experiments on a high-quality powder sample of\nvolborthite Cu3V2O7(OH)2/2H2O, a spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a\ndistorted kagome lattice. Following the previous experiments in magnetic fields\n$B$ below 12 T, the NMR measurements have been extended to higher fields up to\n31 T. In addition to the two already known ordered phases (phases I and II), we\nfound a new high-field phase (phase III) above 25 T, at which a second\nmagnetization step has been observed. The transition from the paramagnetic\nphase to the antiferromagnetic phase III occurs at 26 K, which is much higher\nthan the transition temperatures from the paramagnetic to the lower field\nphases I (B < 4.5 T) and II (4.5 < B < 25 T). At low temperatures, two types of\nthe V sites are observed with different relaxation rates and line shapes in\nphase III as well as in phase II. Our results indicate that both phases II and\nIII exhibit a heterogeneous spin state consisting of two spatially alternating\nCu spin systems, one of which exhibits anomalous spin fluctuations contrasting\nwith the other showing a conventional static order. The magnetization of the\nlatter system exhibits a sudden increase upon entering into phase III,\nresulting in the second magnetization step at 26 T.We discuss the possible spin\nstructure in phase III.\n", "  We have shown the thermodynamic changes in a 2+1-dimensional rotating black\nhole when it absorbs a particle. The microscopic changes which the black hole\nundergoes are interpreted using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Using particle\nabsorption phenomena, we formulate an irreducible mass and black hole entropy\ndirectly related to the particle momenta. We describe the black hole evolution\nthat preserves the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The numbers of microstates which\nevaluate the entropy are analyzed at each of the black hole evolution stages.\n", "  The use of levitated nanospheres represents a new paradigm for the\noptomechanical cooling of a small mechanical oscillator, with the prospect of\nrealising quantum oscillators with unprecedentedly high quality factors. We\ninvestigate the dynamics of this system, especially in the so-called\nself-trapping regimes, where one or more optical fields simultaneously trap and\ncool the mechanical oscillator. The determining characteristic of this regime\nis that both the mechanical frequency $\\omega_M$ and single-photon\noptomechanical coupling strength parameters $g$ are a function of the optical\nfield intensities, in contrast to usual set-ups where $\\omega_M$ and $g$ are\nconstant for the given system. We also measure the characteristic transverse\nand axial trapping frequencies of different sized silica nanospheres in a\nsimple optical standing wave potential, for spheres of radii $r=20-500$\\,nm,\nillustrating a protocol for loading single nanospheres into a standing wave\noptical trap that would be formed by an optical cavity. We use this data to\nconfirm the dependence of the effective optomechanical coupling strength on\nsphere radius for levitated nanospheres in an optical cavity and discuss the\nprospects for reaching regimes of strong light-matter coupling. Theoretical\nsemiclassical and quantum displacement noise spectra show that for larger\nnanospheres with $r \\gtrsim 100$\\,nm a range of interesting and novel dynamical\nregimes can be accessed. These include simultaneous hybridization of the two\noptical modes with the mechanical modes and parameter regimes where the system\nis bistable. We show that here, in contrast to typical single-optical mode\noptomechanical systems, bistabilities are independent of intracavity intensity\nand can occur for very weak laser driving amplitudes.\n", "  We report results of magnetic susceptibility and 51V- and 63,65Cu-NMR\nmeasurements on a high-quality powder sample of vesignieite BaCu3V2O8(OH)2, a\ncandidate for the spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet. We observed a twostep\nmagnetic transition: the appearance of spatially inhomogeneous static moments\nbelow 13 K and a long-range order below 9 K. The NMR data indicate a Q = 0\nmagnetic structure at 1.4 K with the in-plane spin components of three\nsublattices oriented at nearly 120 degrees to each other and the magnitude of\nthe ordered moments of at least 0.6 muB\n", "  The exterior gravitational field of a slowly-rotating neutron star can be\ncharacterized by its multipole moments, the first few being the neutron star\nmass, moment of inertia, and quadrupole moment to quadratic order in spin. In\nprinciple, all of these quantities depend on the neutron star's internal\nstructure, and thus, on unknown nuclear physics at supra-nuclear energy\ndensities. We here find relations between the moment of inertia, the Love\nnumbers and the quadrupole moment (I-Love-Q relations) that do not depend\nsensitively on the neutron star's internal structure. Three important\nconsequences derive from these I-Love-Q relations. On an observational\nastrophysics front, the measurement of a single member of the I-Love-Q trio\nwould automatically provide information about the other two, even when the\nlatter may not be observationally accessible. On a gravitational wave front,\nthe I-Love-Q relations break the degeneracy between the quadrupole moment and\nthe neutron-star spins in binary inspiral waveforms, allowing second-generation\nground-based detectors to determine the (dimensionless) averaged spin to\n$\\mathcal{O}(10)%$, given a sufficiently large signal-to-noise ratio detection.\nOn a fundamental physics front, the I-Love-Q relations allow for tests of\nGeneral Relativity in the neutron-star strong-field that are both theory- and\ninternal structure-independent. As an example, by combining gravitational-wave\nand electromagnetic observations, one may constrain dynamical Chern-Simons\ngravity in the future by more than 6 orders of magnitude more stringently than\nSolar System and table-top constraints.\n", "  We use a two-orbital double-exchange model including Jahn-Teller lattice\ndistortions, superexchange interactions, and long-range Coulomb (LRC)\ninteractions to investigate the origin of magnetically disordered interfaces\nbetween ferromagnetic metallic (FM) and antiferromagnetic insulating (AFI)\nmanganites in FM/AFI superlattices. The induced magnetic moment in the AFI\nlayer varies non-monotonically with increasing AFI layer width as seen in the\nexperiment. We provide a framework for understanding this non-monotonic\nbehavior which has a one-to-one correspondence with the magnetization of the FM\ninterface. The obtained insights provide a basis for improving the tunneling\nmagnetoresistance in FM/AFI manganite superlattices by avoiding a magnetic dead\nlayer (MDL) in the FM manganite.\n", "  We present a generalisation of the double-logarithmic equation for the\nanomalous dimension of the non-singlet unpolarized twist-2 operators in QCD.\nUsing the known three-loop result, this generalisation allows to predict a\nsmall x expansion of the four-loop non-singlet splitting functions in QCD for\nall powers of logarithms up to the single-logarithm term.\n", "  High-velocity features (HVF), especially of Ca II, are frequently seen in\nType Ia supernova observed prior to B-band maximum (Bmax). These HVF evolve in\nvelocity from more than 25,000 km/s, in the days after first light, to about\n18,000 km/s near Bmax. To recreate the evolution of the Ca II near-infrared\ntriplet (CaNIR) HVF in SN 2011fe, we consider the interaction between a model\nType Ia supernova and compact circumstellar shells with masses between 0.003\nsolar masses and 0.012 solar masses. We fit the observed CaNIR feature using\nsynthetic spectra generated from the models using syn++. The CaNIR feature is\nbetter explained by the supernova model interacting with a shell than the model\nwithout a shell, with a shell of mass 0.005 solar masses tending to be better\nfitting than the other shells. The evolution of the optical depth of CaNIR\nsuggests that the ionization state of calcium within the ejecta and shell is\nnot constant. We discuss the method used to measure the observed velocity of\nCaNIR and other features and conclude that HVF or other components can be\nfalsely identified. We briefly discuss the possible origin of the shells and\nthe implications for the progenitor system of the supernova.\n", "  We use present cosmological observations and forecasts of future experiments\nto illustrate the power of large-scale structure (LSS) surveys in probing dark\nmatter (DM) microphysics and unveiling potential deviations from the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM scenario. To quantify this statement, we focus on an extension of\n$\\Lambda$CDM with DM-neutrino scattering, which leaves a distinctive imprint on\nthe angular and matter power spectra. After finding that future CMB experiments\n(such as COrE+) will not significantly improve the constraints set by the\nPlanck satellite, we show that the next generation of galaxy clustering surveys\n(such as DESI) could play a leading role in constraining alternative\ncosmologies and even have the potential to make a discovery. Typically we find\nthat DESI would be an order of magnitude more sensitive to DM interactions than\nPlanck, thus probing effects that until now have only been accessible via\n$N$-body simulations.\n", "  All the possible CP-conserving non-linear operators up to the $p^4$-order in\nthe Lagrangian expansion are clearly and completely listed for the case of an\nemerging new physics field content in the nature, more specifically, from\nspin-1 resonances sourced by the straightforward extension of the SM local\ngauge symmetry to the larger local group $SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes\nU(1)_{B-L}$, within a non-linear electroweak chiral context coupled to a light\ndynamical Higgs. The physical effects induced by integrating out the right\nhanded fields from the physical spectrum are briefly analysed. The relevant set\nof effective operators have been identified at low energies.\n", "  New physics field content in the nature, more specifically, from spin-1\nresonances sourced by the extension of the SM local gauge symmetry to the\nlarger local group $SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$, may induce\nCP-violation signalling NP effects from higher energy regimes. In this work we\ncompletely list and study all the CP-violating operators up to the $p^4$-order\nin the Lagrangian expansion, for a non-linear left-right electroweak chiral\ncontext and coupled to a light dynamical Higgs. Heavy right handed fields can\nbe integrated out from the physical spectrum, inducing thus a physical impact\nin the effective gauge couplings, fermionic electric dipole moment, and\nCP-violation in the decay $h\\rightarrow ZZ^*\\rightarrow 4\\,l$ that are briefly\nanalysed. The final relevant set of effective operators have also been\nidentified at low energies.\n", "  The chaotic behavior of the modified Rayleigh-Duffing oscillator with $\n\\phi^6$ potential and external excitation which modeles ship rolling motions\nare investigated both analytically and numerically. Melnikov method is applied\nand the conditions for the existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic chaos are\nobtained. The effects of nonlinear damping on roll motion of ships are analyzed\nin detail. As it is known, nonlinear roll damping is a very important parameter\nin estimating ship reponses. The predictions are tested numerical simulations\nbased on the basin of attraction. We conclude that certains quadratic damping\neffects are contrary to cubic damping effect.\n", "  The Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) effect, at the quantum level, is essentially an\ninterference of one particle with another, as opposed to interference of a\nparticle with itself. Conventional treatments of identical particles encounter\ndifficulties while dealing with entanglement. A recently introduced label-free\napproach to indistinguishable particles is described, and is used to analyze\nthe HBT effect. Quantum wave-packets have been used to provide a better\nunderstanding of the quantum interpretation of the HBT effect. The effect is\ndemonstrated for two independent particles governed by Bose-Einstein or\nFermi-Dirac statistics. The HBT effect is also analyzed for pairs of entangled\nparticles. Surprisingly, entanglement has almost no effect on the interference\nseen in the HBT effect. In the light of the results, an old quantum optics\nexperiment is reanalyzed, and it is argued that the interference seen in that\nexperiment is not a consequence of non-local correlations between the photons,\nas is commonly believed.\n", "  We study the instability of charged anti-de Sitter black holes in four or\nhigher-dimension under fragmentation. The instability of fragmentation breaks\nthe black hole into two black holes. We have found that the region near\nextremal or massive black holes become unstable under fragmentation. These\nregions depend not only on the mass and charge of initial black hole but also\nthose of the fragmented one. The instability in higher-dimension is\nqualitatively similar to that of four-dimension. The detailed instabilities are\nnumerically investigated.\n", "  We have shown that changes occur in a (2+1)-dimensional charged black hole by\nadding a charged probe. The particle increases the entropy of the black hole\nand guarantees the second law of thermodynamics. The first law of\nthermodynamics is derived from the change in the black hole mass. Using the\nparticle absorption, we test the extremal black hole and find out that the mass\nof the extremal black hole increases more than the electric charge. Therefore,\nthe outer horizon of the black hole still exists. However, the extremal\ncondition becomes non-extremal.\n", "  The entangled states that include every physical properties of particles\nwould be important for both theoretical and applied physics. However, the\nexistence and properties of such entangled states are unclear at present. Here\nwe theoretically show that a particle-antiparticle pair can form the so-called\npackaged entangled states which encapsulate all the necessary physical\nquantities for completely identifying the particles. The particles in the\npackaged entangled states are indeterminate and exhibit unusual properties.\nThereafter, we discussed the possible applications of these new entangled\nstates, i.e., the protocol for teleporting the entire quantum state of a\nparticle (or an antiparticle) to an arbitrarily large distance without a\nclassical channel, transfer of the new entangled states from a particle pair to\nanother particle pair, and new interpretation to the matter-antimatter\nasymmetry of the observable universe.\n", "  Whether live cell membranes show miscibility phase transitions (MPTs), and if\nso, how they fluctuate near the transitions remain outstanding unresolved\nissues in physics and biology alike.\n  Motivated by these questions we construct a generic hydrodynamic theory for\nlipid membranes {{that are active, due for instance, to the molecular motors in\nthe surrounding cytoskeleton, or active protein components in the membrane\nitself}}. We use this to uncover a direct correspondence between membrane\nfluctuations and MPTs. Several testable predictions are made: (i) generic {\\em\nactive stiffening} with orientational long range order (flat membrane) or {\\em\nsoftening} with crumpling of the membrane, controlled by the {\\em active\ntension} and (ii) for mixed lipid membranes, capturing the nature of putative\nMPTs by measuring the membrane conformation fluctuations. Possibilities of both\nfirst and second order MPTs in mixed active membranes are argued for. Near\nsecond order MPTs, active stiffening (softening) manifests as a {\\em\nsuper-stiff (super-soft) membrane}. Our predictions are testable in a variety\nof {\\em in-vitro} systems, e.g., live cytoskeletal extracts deposited on\nliposomes and lipid membranes containing active proteins embedded in a passive\nfluid.\n", "  The main focus of this paper is a nonparametric filtering technique for the\nestimation of interface geometry in bulk materials obtainable from modern\nimaging measurements. The filtering methodology relies on an assumed hierarchy\nof topological features present in a typical interface network, such as foam\ninterfaces and grain boundary networks in polycrystalline materials. Each type\nof topological feature is treated in order of rank in the hierarchy, with the\nlower-level feature being filtered subject to the positional constraints\nimposed by the higher-level features. Such a scheme is an alternative to\nexisting surface smoothing/estimation techniques in microstructural materials\nscience, in which the explicit treatment of different elements of the network\ntopology is absent, or at best arbitrarily parameterized. We describe the\nramifications of this technique in the usual microstructural applications in\nwhich the computation of important physical quantities is predicated on the\nprecise estimation of the interface features. As an additional application, we\ndescribe a novel front-tracking algorithm for quantifying the transport of such\ninterfaces.\n", "  We have investigated the upper bound of the radiation energy in the head-on\ncollision of two Myers-Perry black holes. Initially, the two black holes are\nfar away from each other, and they become one black hole after the collision.\nWe have obtained the upper bound of the radiation energy thermodynamically\nallowed in the process. The upper bound of the radiation energy is obtained in\ngeneral dimensions. The radiation bound depends on the alignments of rotating\naxes for a given initial condition due to spin-spin interaction. We have found\nthat the collision may not be occurred for a initially ultra-spinning black\nhole.\n", "  The ability to probe symmetry breaking transitions on their natural time\nscales is one of the key challenges in nonequilibrium physics. Stripe ordering\nrepresents an intriguing type of broken symmetry, where complex interactions\nresult in atomic-scale lines of charge and spin density. Although phonon\nanomalies and periodic distortions attest the importance of electron-phonon\ncoupling in the formation of stripe phases, a direct time-domain view of\nvibrational symmetry breaking is lacking. We report experiments that track the\ntransient multi-THz response of the model stripe compound\nLa$_{1.75}$Sr$_{0.25}$NiO$_{4}$, yielding novel insight into its electronic and\nstructural dynamics following an ultrafast optical quench. We find that\nalthough electronic carriers are immediately delocalized, the crystal symmetry\nremains initially frozen - as witnessed by time-delayed suppression of\nzone-folded Ni-O bending modes acting as a fingerprint of lattice symmetry.\nLongitudinal and transverse vibrations react with different speeds, indicating\na strong directionality and an important role of polar interactions. The hidden\ncomplexity of electronic and structural coupling during stripe melting and\nformation, captured here within a single terahertz spectrum, opens new paths to\nunderstanding symmetry breaking dynamics in solids.\n", "  Results of the measurements with cosmic muons for the light yield of 2-meter\nlong extruded scintillation bar (strip) as a function of distance for different\noptions for light collection technique are presented. Scintillation strip cross\nsection geometry was a triangle made on polystyrene plastic scintillator with\ndopants of 2% PTP and 0.03% POPOP, extruded with 2.6 mm diameter hole and\nproduced at ISMA (Kharkov, Ukraine). It was shown that the insertion of the\noptical transparent resin (BC 600 or CKTN MED(E)) by special technique into the\nco-extruded hole with 1.0 mm or 1.2 mm wave-length shifter (WLS) fiber Kuraray\nY11 (200) MC in it significantly improves light collection by factor of\n1.6...1.9 against of the 'dry' case.\n", "  We use a single squeezed state to represent a qubit, which can be coherently\nprocessed in a deconvolution picture (DP) in the presence of noise. We avail\nourselves of the fact that when evolution is governed by a quadratic\ndissipative equation, there exists a basis of squeezed states that evolves to\nanother basis of such states in the DP. An operator acts as an impurity filter,\nrestoring the coherence lost from the inexorable interactions of the qubit with\nits surroundings.\n", "  Herein we present open problems and survey examples and theorems concerning\nsequences of Riemannian manifolds with uniform lower bounds on scalar curvature\nand their limit spaces. Examples of Gromov and of Ilmanen which naturally ought\nto have certain limit spaces do not converge with respect to smooth or\nGromov-Hausdorff convergence. Thus we focus here on the notion of Intrinsic\nFlat convergence, developed jointly with Wenger. This notion has been applied\nsuccessfully to study sequences that arise in General Relativity. Gromov has\nsuggested it should be applied in other settings as well. We first review\nintrinsic flat convergence, its properties, and its compactness theorems,\nbefore presenting the applications and the open problems.\n", "  Motivated by considerations of euclidean quantum gravity, we investigate a\ncentral question of spectral geometry, namely the question of\nreconstructability of compact Riemannian manifolds from the spectra of their\nLaplace operators. To this end, we study analytic paths of metrics that induce\nisospectral Laplace-Beltrami operators over oriented compact surfaces without\nboundary. Applying perturbation theory, we show that sets of conformally\nequivalent metrics on such surfaces contain no nontrivial convex subsets. This\nindicates that cases where the manifolds cannot be reconstructed from their\nspectra are highly constrained.\n", "  We present a study of mono(benzene)TM and bis(benzene)TM systems, where\nTM={Mo,W}. We calculate the binding energies by quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\napproaches and compare the results with other methods and available\nexperiments. The orbitals for the determinantal part of each trial wave\nfunction were generated from several types of DFT in order to optimize for\nfixed-node errors. We estimate and compare the size of the fixed-node errors\nfor both the Mo and W systems with regard to the electron density and degree of\nlocalization in these systems. For the W systems we provide benchmarking\nresults of the binding energies, given that experimental data is not available.\n", "  The half-BPS boundary conditions preserving $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ and\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetry in 3d $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge\ntheories are examined. The BPS equations admit decomposition of the bulk\nsupermultiplets into specific boundary supermultiplets of preserved\nsupersymmetry. Nahm-like equations arise in the vector multiplet BPS boundary\ncondition preserving $\\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetry and Robin-type boundary\nconditions appear for the hypermultiplet coupled to vector multiplet when\n$\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ supersymmetry is preserved. The half-BPS boundary\nconditions are realized in the brane configurations of Type IIB string theory.\n", "  While piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics are playing a key role in many\neveryday applications, there are still a number of open questions related to\nthe physics of those materials. In order to foster the understanding of\npiezoelectrics and ferroelectric and pave the way to future applications, the\nnanoscale characterization of these materials is essential. In this light, we\nhave developed a novel AFM based mode that obtains a direct quantitative\nanalysis of the piezoelectric coefficient d33. This nanoscale tool is capable\nof detecting and reveal piezo-charge generation through the direct\npiezoelectric effect at the surface of the piezoelectric and ferroelectric\nmaterials. We report the first nanoscale images of the charge generated in a\nthick single crystal of Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) and a Bismuth\nFerrite (BiFO3) thin film by applying a force and recording the current\nproduced by the materials. The quantification of both d33 coefficients for PPLN\nand BFO are 13 +- 2 pC/N and 46 +- 7 pC/N respectively, in agreement with the\nvalues reported in the literature. This new mode can operate simultaneously\nwith PFM mode providing a powerful tool for the electromechanical and\npiezo-charge generation characterization of ferroelectric and piezoelectric\nmaterials.\n", "  We review important ideas on nuclear and quark matter description on the\nbasis of high- temperature field theory concepts, like resummation, dimensional\nreduction, interaction scale separation and spectral function modification in\nmedia. Statistical and thermodynamical concepts are spotted in the light of\nthese methods concentrating on the - partially still open - problems of the\nhadronization process.\n", "  The Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a macroscopic manifestation of\nfundamental chiral anomaly in a many-body system of chiral fermions, and\nemerges as anomalous transport current in the fluid dynamics framework.\nExperimental observation of CME is of great interest and has been reported in\nDirac and Weyl semimetals. Significant efforts have also been made to look for\nCME in heavy ion collisions. Critically needed for such search, is the\ntheoretical prediction for CME signal. In this paper we report a first\nquantitative modeling framework, the Anomalous Viscous Fluid Dynamics (AVFD),\nwhich computes the evolution of fermion currents on top of realistic bulk\nevolution in heavy ion collisions and simultaneously accounts for both\nanomalous and normal viscous transport effects. The AVFD allows a quantitative\nunderstanding of the generation and evolution of CME-induced charge separation\nduring hydrodynamic stage as well as its dependence on theoretical ingredients.\nWith reasonable estimates of key parameters, the AVFD simulations provide the\nfirst phenomenologically successful explanation of the measured signal in\n200AGeV AuAu collisions.\n", "  In this paper, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the\ntwo-dimensional packing process of both monosized and random size particles\nwith radii ranging from $1.0 \\, \\mu m$ to $7.0 \\, \\mu m$. The system was\nallowed to settle under gravity towards the bottom of a $300 \\, \\mu m \\times\n500 \\, \\mu m$ rectangular box. The initial positions as well as the radii of\nfive thousand fine particles were defined along the box by using a random\nnumber generator. Both the translational and the rotational movement of each\nparticle were considered in the simulations. In order to deal with interacting\nfine particles, we take into account both the contact forces and the long-range\ndispersive forces. We account for normal and static/sliding tangential friction\nforces between particles and between particle and wall by means of a linear\nmodel approach, while the long-range dispersive forces are computed by using a\nLennard-Jones like potential. The packing processes were studied assuming\ndifferent long- range interaction strengths. We carry out statistical\ncalculations of the different quantities studied such as packing density, mean\ncoordination number and time derivative of the kinetic energy as the system\nevolves over time. A size spectral analysis was employed to obtain the radial\ndistribution function (RDF) of the random close-packed structures (RCPS) for\nthe case of random size particles. We find that the long-range dispersive\nforces can strongly influence the packing process dynamics as they might form\nlarge particle clusters, depending on the intensity of the long-range\ninteraction strength. However, the general shape of the RDFs for the RCPS is\nseen to be more influenced by the hardness of the particles than by the\nlong-range dispersive forces.\n", "  We present several methods to accurately estimate Lagrangian bias parameters\nand substantiate them using simulations. In particular, we focus on the\nquadratic terms, both the local and the non local ones, and show the first\nclear evidence for the latter in the simulations. Using Fourier space\ncorrelations, we also show for the first time, the scale dependence of the\nquadratic and non-local bias coefficients. For the linear bias, we fit for the\nscale dependence and demonstrate the validity of a consistency relation between\nlinear bias parameters. Furthermore we employ real space estimators, using both\ncross-correlations and the Peak-Background Split argument. This is the first\ntime the latter is used to measure anisotropic bias coefficients. We find good\nagreement for all the parameters among these different methods, and also good\nagreement for local bias with ESP$\\tau$ theory predictions. We also try to\nexploit possible relations among the different bias parameters. Finally, we\nshow how including higher order bias reduces the magnitude and scale dependence\nof stochasticity of the halo field.\n", "  Rotating relativistic stars have been studied extensively in recent years,\nboth theoretically and observationally, because of the information they might\nyield about the equation of state of matter at extremely high densities and\nbecause they are considered to be promising sources of gravitational waves. The\nlatest theoretical understanding of rotating stars in relativity is reviewed in\nthis updated article. The sections on equilibrium properties and on\nnonaxisymmetric oscillations and instabilities in $f$-modes and $r$-modes have\nbeen updated. Several new sections have been added on equilibria in modified\ntheories of gravity, approximate universal relationships, the one-arm spiral\ninstability, on analytic solutions for the exterior spacetime, rotating stars\nin LMXBs, rotating strange stars, and on rotating stars in numerical relativity\nincluding both hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic studies of these objects.\n", "  We define and study a certain relative tensor product of subfactors over a\nmodular tensor category. This gives a relative tensor product of two completely\nrational heterotic full local conformal nets with trivial superselection\nstructures over a common chiral representation category. In particular, we have\na new realization of fusion rules of modular invariants. This also gives a\nmathematical definition of a composition of two gapped domain walls between\ntopological phases.\n", "  We derive the off-shell nilpotent symmetries of the two (1+1)-dimensional\n(2D) non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory by using the theoretical techniques of the\ngeometrical superfield approach to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism.\nFor this purpose, we exploit the augmented version of superfield approach\n(AVSA) and derive theoretically useful nilpotent (anti-)BRST, (anti-)co-BRST\nsymmetries and Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions for the self-interacting 2D\nnon-Abelian 1-form gauge theory (where there is no interaction with matter\nfields). The derivation of the (anti-)co-BRST symmetries and all possible\nCF-type restrictions are completely novel results within the framework of AVSA\nto BRST formalism where the ordinary 2D non-Abelian theory is generalized onto\nan appropriately chosen (2, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. The latter is\nparameterized by the superspace coordinates Z^{M} = (x^{\\mu}, \\theta,\n\\bar\\theta) where x^{\\mu } (with \\mu = 0,1) are the bosonic coordinates and a\npair of Grassmannian variables (\\theta, \\bar\\theta) obey the relationships:\n\\theta^{2} = \\bar\\theta^{2} = 0, \\theta\\bar\\theta + \\bar\\theta\\theta = 0.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate the generation and radiation of coherent\nnanoplasmons powered by a single three-level quantum emitter on a plasmonic\nnanoresonator. By pumping the three-level emitter in a Raman configuration, we\nshow a pathway to achieve macroscopic accumulation of nanoplasmons due to\nstimulated emission in the nanoresonator despite their fast relaxation. Thanks\nto the antenna effect of the nanoresonator, the system acts as an efficient and\nbright nanoscopic coherent light source with a photon emission rate of hundreds\nof Terahertz and could be realized with solid-state emitters at room\ntemperatures in pulse mode. We provide physical interpretations of the results\nand discuss their realization and implications for ultra-compact integration of\noptoelectronics.\n", "  We formulate off-shell N=1 superconformal higher spin multiplets in four\nspacetime dimensions and briefly discuss their coupling to conformal\nsupergravity. As an example, we explicitly work out the coupling of the\nsuperconformal gravitino multiplet to conformal supergravity. The corresponding\naction is super-Weyl invariant for arbitrary supergravity backgrounds. However,\nit is gauge invariant only if the supersymmetric Bach tensor vanishes. This is\nsimilar to linearised conformal supergravity in curved background.\n", "  We use publicly available data for the Millennium Simulation to explore the\nimplications of the recent detection of assembly bias and splashback signatures\nin a large sample of galaxy clusters. These were identified in the SDSS/DR8\nphotometric data by the redMaPPer algorithm and split into high- and\nlow-concentration subsamples based on the projected positions of cluster\nmembers. We use simplified versions of these procedures to build cluster\nsamples of similar size from the simulation data. These match the observed\nsamples quite well and show similar assembly bias and splashback signals.\nPrevious theoretical work has found the logarithmic slope of halo density\nprofiles to have a well-defined minimum whose depth decreases and whose radius\nincreases with halo concentration. Projected profiles for the observed and\nsimulated cluster samples show trends with concentration which are opposite to\nthese predictions. In addition, for high-concentration clusters the minimum\nslope occurs at significantly smaller radius than predicted. We show that these\ndiscrepancies all reflect confusion between splashback features and features\nimposed on the profiles by the cluster identification and concentration\nestimation procedures. The strong apparent assembly bias is not reflected in\nthe three-dimensional distribution of matter around clusters. Rather it is a\nconsequence of the preferential contamination of low-concentration clusters by\nforeground or background groups.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBH) have been shown to arise from high peaks in the\nmatter power spectra of multi-field models of inflation. Here we show, with a\nsimple toy model, that it is also possible to generate a peak in the curvature\npower spectrum of single-field inflation. We assume that the effective dynamics\nof the inflaton field presents a near-inflection point which slows down the\nfield right before the end of inflation and gives rise to a prominent spike in\nthe fluctuation power spectrum at scales much smaller than those probed by\nCosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) observations.\nThis peak will give rise, upon reentry during the radiation era, to PBH via\ngravitational collapse. The mass and abundance of these PBH is such that they\ncould constitute the totality of the Dark Matter today. We satisfy all CMB and\nLSS constraints and predict a very broad range of PBH masses. Some of these PBH\nare light enough that they will evaporate before structure formation, leaving\nbehind a large curvature fluctuation on small scales. This broad mass\ndistribution of PBH as Dark Matter will be tested in the future by AdvLIGO and\nLISA interferometers.\n", "  We theoretically investigate charge transport through electronic bands of a\nmesoscopic one-dimensional system, where inter-band transitions are coupled to\na confined cavity mode, initially prepared close to its vacuum. This coupling\nleads to light-matter hybridization where the dressed fermionic bands interact\nvia absorption and emission of dressed cavity-photons. Using a self-consistent\nnon-equilibrium Green's function method, we compute electronic transmissions\nand cavity photon spectra and demonstrate how light-matter coupling can lead to\nan enhancement of charge conductivity in the steady-state. We find that\ndepending on cavity loss rate, electronic bandwidth, and coupling strength, the\ndynamics involves either an individual or a collective response of Bloch\nstates, and explain how this affects the current enhancement. We show that the\ncharge conductivity enhancement can reach orders of magnitudes under\nexperimentally relevant conditions.\n", "  We numerically demonstrate an ultrafast method to create $\\textit{single}$\nskyrmions in a $\\textit{collinear}$ ferromagnetic sample by applying a\npicosecond (effective) magnetic field pulse in the presence of\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. For small samples the applied magnetic field\npulse could be either spatially uniform or nonuniform while for large samples a\nnonuniform and localized field is more effective. We examine the phase diagram\nof pulse width and amplitude for the nucleation. Our finding could ultimately\nbe used to design future skyrmion-based devices.\n", "  We derive conservation laws for Dirac-harmonic maps and their extensions to\nmanifolds that have isometries, where we mostly focus on the spherical case. In\naddition, we discuss several geometric and analytic applications of the latter.\n", "  Assessing whether a given network is typical or atypical for a random-network\nensemble (i.e., network-ensemble comparison) has widespread applications\nranging from null-model selection and hypothesis testing to clustering and\nclassifying networks. We develop a framework for network-ensemble comparison by\nsubjecting the network to stochastic rewiring. We study two rewiring processes,\nuniform and degree-preserved rewiring, which yield random-network ensembles\nthat converge to the Erdos-Renyi and configuration-model ensembles,\nrespectively. We study convergence through von Neumann entropy (VNE), a network\nsummary statistic measuring information content based on the spectra of a\nLaplacian matrix, and develop a perturbation analysis for the expected effect\nof rewiring on VNE. Our analysis yields an estimate for how many rewires are\nrequired for a given network to resemble a typical network from an ensemble,\noffering a computationally efficient quantity for network-ensemble comparison\nthat does not require simulation of the corresponding rewiring process.\n", "  In the framework of quantum information geometry we investigate the\nrelationship between monotone metric tensors uniquely defined on the space of\nquantum tomograms, once the tomographic scheme chosen, and monotone quantum\nmetrics on the space of quantum states, classified by operator monotone\nfunctions, according to Petz classification theorem. We show that different\nmetrics can be related through a change of the tomographic map and prove that\nthere exists a bijective relation between monotone quantum metrics associated\nwith different operator monotone functions. Such bijective relation is uniquely\ndefined in terms of solutions of a first order second degree differential\nequation for the parameters of the involved tomographic maps. We first exhibit\nan example of a non-linear tomographic map which connects a monotone metric\nwith a new one which is not monotone. Then we provide a second example where\ntwo monotone metrics are uniquely related through their tomographic parameters.\n", "  The polarizations of $\\Lambda$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$ hyperons are important\nquantities in extracting the fluid vorticity of the strongly coupled quark\ngluon plasma and the magnitude of the magnetic field created in off-central\nheavy-ion collisions, through the spin-vorticity and spin-magnetic coupling. We\ncomputed the energy dependence of the global $\\Lambda$ polarization in\noff-central Au+Au collisions in the energy range $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7-200$ GeV\nusing a multiphase transport model. The observed polarizations with two\ndifferent impact parameters agree quantitatively with recent STAR measurements.\nThe energy dependence of the global $\\Lambda$ polarization is decomposed as\nenergy dependence of the $\\Lambda$ distribution at hadronization and the\nspace-time distribution of the fluid-vorticity field. The visualization of both\nthe $\\Lambda$ distribution and the fluid-vorticity field show a smaller tilt at\nhigher collisional energies, which indicates that the smaller global\npolarization at higher collisional energies is caused by a smaller angular\nmomentum deposition at midrapidity.\n", "  We study an economical model of weakly-interacting massive particle dark\nmatter (DM) which has spin 3/2 and interacts with the 125-GeV Higgs boson via\neffective scalar and pseudoscalar operators. We apply constraints on the model\nfrom the relic density data, LHC measurements of the Higgs boson, and direct\nand indirect searches for DM, taking into account the effective nature of the\nDM-Higgs couplings. We show that this DM is currently viable in most of the\nmass region from about 58 GeV to 2.3 TeV and will be probed more stringently by\nongoing and upcoming experiments. Nevertheless, the presence of the DM-Higgs\npseudoscalar coupling could make parts of the model parameter space elusive\nfrom future tests. We find that important aspects of this scenario are quite\nsimilar to those of its more popular spin-1/2 counterpart.\n", "  In this contribution we analyze a parties' vote share distribution across the\npolling stations during the Lithuanian parliamentary elections of 1992, 2008\nand 2012. We find that the distribution is rather well fitted by the Beta\ndistribution. To reproduce this empirical observation we propose a simple\nmulti-state agent-based model of the voting behavior. In the proposed model\nagents change the party they vote for either idiosyncratically or due to a\nlinear recruitment mechanism. We use the model to reproduce the vote share\ndistribution observed during the election of 1992. We discuss model extensions\nneeded to reproduce the vote share distribution observed during the other\nelections.\n", "  We demonstrate the fabrication of photonic crystal nanobeam cavities with\nrectangular cross section into bulk diamond. In simulation, these cavities have\nan unloaded quality factor (Q) of over 1 million. Measured cavity resonances\nshow fundamental modes with spectrometer-limited quality factors larger than\n14,000 within 1nm of the NV center's zero phonon line at 637nm. We find high\ncavity yield across the full diamond chip with deterministic resonance trends\nacross the fabricated parameter sweeps.\n", "  The polymer representations, which are partially motivated by loop quantum\ngravity, have been suggested as alternative schemes to quantize the matter\nfields. Here we apply a version of the polymer representations to the free\nelectromagnetic field, in a reduced phase space setting, and derive the\ncorresponding effective (i.e., semiclassical) Hamiltonian. We study the\npropagation of an electromagnetic pulse and we confront our theoretical results\nwith gamma ray burst observations. This comparison reveals that the\ndimensionless polymer scale must be smaller than $4\\times 10^{-35}$, casting\ndoubts on the possibility that the matter fields are quantized with the polymer\nrepresentation we employed.\n", "  We highlight how the existence of an ultraviolet completion for interacting\nStandard-Model type matter puts constraints on the viable microscopic dynamics\nof asymptotically safe quantum gravity within truncated Renormalization Group\nflows. A first constraint -- the weak-gravity bound -- is rooted in the\ndestruction of quantum scale-invariance in the matter system by strong\nquantum-gravity fluctuations. A second constraint arises by linking\nPlanck-scale dynamics to the dynamics at the electroweak scale. Specifically,\nwe delineate how to extract a prediction of the top quark mass from\nasymptotically safe gravity and stress that a finite top mass could be\ndifficult to accommodate in a significant part of the gravitational coupling\nspace.\n", "  The micromotion of ion crystals confined in Paul traps is usually considered\nan inconvenient nuisance, and is thus typically minimised in high-precision\nexperiments such as high-fidelity quantum gates for quantum information\nprocessing. In this work, we introduce a particular scheme where this behavior\ncan be reversed, making micromotion beneficial for quantum information\nprocessing. We show that using laser-driven micromotion sidebands, it is\npossible to engineer state-dependent dipole forces with a reduced effect of\noff-resonant couplings to the carrier transition. This allows one, in a certain\nparameter regime, to devise entangling gate schemes based on geometric phase\ngates with both a higher speed and a lower error, which is attractive in light\nof current efforts towards fault-tolerant quantum information processing. We\ndiscuss the prospects of reaching the parameters required to observe this\nmicromotion-enabled improvement in experiments with current and future trap\ndesigns.\n", "  Light Axionic Dark Matter, motivated by string theory, is increasingly\nfavored for the \"no-WIMP era\". Galaxy formation is suppressed below a Jeans\nscale, of $\\simeq 10^8 M_\\odot$ by setting the axion mass to, $m_B \\sim\n10^{-22}$eV, and the large dark cores of dwarf galaxies are explained as\nsolitons on the de-Broglie scale. This is persuasive, but detection of the\ninherent scalar field oscillation at the Compton frequency, $\\omega_B= (2.5{\\rm\n\\, months})^{-1}(m_B/10^{-22}eV)$, would be definitive. By evolving the coupled\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson equation for a Bose-Einstein condensate, we predict the\ndark matter is fully modulated by de-Broglie interference, with a dense soliton\ncore of size $\\simeq 150pc$, at the Galactic center. The oscillating field\npressure induces General Relativistic time dilation in proportion to the local\ndark matter density and pulsars within this dense core have detectably large\ntiming residuals, of $\\simeq 400nsec/(m_B/10^{-22}eV)$. This is encouraging as\nmany new pulsars should be discovered near the Galactic center with planned\nradio surveys. More generally, over the whole Galaxy, differences in dark\nmatter density between pairs of pulsars imprints a pairwise Galactocentric\nsignature that can be distinguished from an isotropic gravitational wave\nbackground.\n", "  We study the $J/\\psi$ production based on coalescence model at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 and 5.02 TeV Pb-Pb collisions. With the colliding energy\nincreasing from 2.76 TeV to 5.02 TeV, the number of charm pairs is enhanced by\nmore than 50%. However, the ratio of $J/\\psi$ inclusive nuclear modification\nfactors $R^{5.02TeV}_{AA}/R^{2.76TeV}_{AA}$ is only about 1.1 $\\sim$ 1.2. We\nfind that the regeneration of $J/\\psi$ is proportional to the densities of\ncharm and anti-charm quarks, instead of their total numbers. The charm quark\ndensity is diluted by the strong expansion of quark gluon plasma, which\nsuppresses the combination probability of heavy quarks and $J/\\psi$\nregeneration. This effect is more important in higher colliding energies where\nQGP expansion is strong. We also propose the ratio $N_{J/\\psi}/(N_D)^2$ as a\nmeasurement of $c$ and $\\bar c$ coalescence probability, which is only affected\nby the heavy quark diffusions in QGP, and does not depend on the inputs such as\ncold nuclear matter effects and cross sections of charm quark production.\nFurther more, we give the predictions at the energy of Future Circular Collider\n($\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 39 TeV).\n", "  Low-energy spin excitations in any long-range ordered magnetic system in the\nabsence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy are gapless Goldstone modes emanating\nfrom the ordering wave vectors. In helimagnets, these modes hybridize into the\nso-called helimagnon excitations. Here we employ neutron spectroscopy supported\nby theoretical calculations to investigate the magnetic excitation spectrum of\nthe isotropic Heisenberg helimagnet ZnCr2Se4 with a cubic spinel structure, in\nwhich spin-3/2 magnetic Cr3+ ions are arranged in a geometrically frustrated\npyrochlore sublattice. Apart from the conventional Goldstone mode emanating\nfrom the (0 0 q) ordering vector, low-energy magnetic excitations in the\nsingle-domain proper-screw spiral phase show soft helimagnon modes with a small\nenergy gap of ~0.17 meV, emerging from two orthogonal wave vectors (q 0 0) and\n(0 q 0) where no magnetic Bragg peaks are present. We term them\npseudo-Goldstone magnons, as they appear gapless within linear spin-wave theory\nand only acquire a finite gap due to higher-order quantum-fluctuation\ncorrections. Our results are likely universal for a broad class of symmetric\nhelimagnets, opening up a new way of studying weak magnon-magnon interactions\nwith accessible spectroscopic methods.\n", "  We study the changes of opinions about vaccination together with the\nevolution of a disease. In our model we consider a multiplex network consisting\nof two layers. One of the layers corresponds to a social network where people\nshare their opinions and influence others opinions. The social model that rules\nthe dynamic is the M-model, which takes into account two different processes\nthat occurs in a society: persuasion and compromise. This two processes are\nrelated through a parameter $r$, $r<1$ describes a moderate and committed\nsociety, for $r>1$ the society tends to have extremist opinions, while $r=1$\nrepresents a neutral society. This social network may be of real or virtual\ncontacts. On the other hand, the second layer corresponds to a network of\nphysical contacts where the disease spreading is described by the SIR-Model. In\nthis model the individuals may be in one of the following four states:\nSusceptible ($S$), Infected($I$), Recovered ($R$) or Vaccinated ($V$). A\nSusceptible individual can: i) get vaccinated, if his opinion in the other\nlayer is totally in favor of the vaccine, ii) get infected, with probability\n$\\beta$ if he is in contact with an infected neighbor. Those $I$ individuals\nrecover after a certain period $t_r=6$. Vaccinated individuals have an\nextremist positive opinion that does not change. We consider that the vaccine\nhas a certain effectiveness $\\omega$ and as a consequence vaccinated nodes can\nbe infected with probability $\\beta (1 - \\omega)$ if they are in contact with\nan infected neighbor. In this case, if the infection process is successful, the\nnew infected individual changes his opinion from extremist positive to totally\nagainst the vaccine. We find that depending on the trend in the opinion of the\nsociety, which depends on $r$, different behaviors in the spread of the\nepidemic occurs. An epidemic threshold was found.\n", "  We present phase diagrams, free-energy landscapes, and order-parameter\ndistributions for a model spin-crossover material with a two-step transition\nbetween the high-spin and low-spin states (a square-lattice Ising model with\nantiferromagnetic-like nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic-like long-range\ninteractions) [P. A. Rikvold et al., Phys. Rev. B 93, 064109 (2016)]. The\nresults are obtained by a recently introduced, macroscopically constrained\nWang-Landau Monte Carlo simulation method [C. H. Chan, G. Brown, and P. A.\nRikvold, Phys. Rev. E 95, 053302 (2017)]. The method's computational efficiency\nenables calculation of thermodynamic quantities for a wide range of\ntemperatures, applied fields, and long-range interaction strengths. For\nlong-range interactions of intermediate strength, tricritical points in the\nphase diagrams are replaced by pairs of critical end points and mean-field\ncritical points that give rise to horn-shaped regions of metastability. The\ncorresponding free-energy landscapes offer insights into the nature of\nasymmetric, multiple hysteresis loops that have been experimentally observed in\nspin-crossover materials characterized by competing short-range interactions\nand long-range elastic interactions.\n", "  We consider a system associated to Klein-Gordon equations with homogeneous\ntime-dependent electric fields. The upper and lower boundaries of a\ntime-evolution propagator for this system were proven by Veseli\\'c in 1991 for\nelectric fields that are independent of time. We extend this result to\ntime-dependent electric fields.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states, bound states that form\naround magnetic scatterers in superconductors, to the presence of nonmagnetic\ndisorder in both two and three dimensional systems. We formulate a scattering\napproach to this problem and reduce the effects of disorder to two\ncontributions: disorder-induced normal reflection and a random phase of the\namplitude for Andreev reflection. We find that both of these are small even for\nmoderate amounts of disorder. In the dirty limit in which the disorder-induced\nmean free path is smaller than the superconducting coherence length, the\nvariance of the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state remains small in the ratio\nof the Fermi wavelength and the mean free path. This effect is more pronounced\nin three dimensions, where only impurities within a few Fermi wavelengths of\nthe magnetic scatterer contribute. In two dimensions the energy variance is\nlarger by a logarithmic factor because impurities contribute up to a distance\nof the order of the superconducting coherence length.\n", "  Highly sensitive nuclear spin detection is crucial in many scientific areas\nincluding nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), imaging (MRI) and\nquantum computing. The tiny thermal nuclear spin polarization represents a\nmajor obstacle towards this goal which may be overcome by Dynamic Nuclear Spin\nPolarization (DNP) methods. The latter often rely on the transfer of the\nthermally polarized electron spins to nearby nuclear spins, which is limited by\nthe Boltzmann distribution of the former. Here we demonstrate the polarization\nand read out of a nuclear spin bath consisting of $^{13}$C nuclear spins in\ndiamond by using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. Our method utilizes\nmicrowave dressed states to transfer the NV's high ($>$~92~\\%) non-equilibrium\nelectron spin polarization induced by short laser pulses to the surrounding\ncarbon nuclear spins, where the NV is repeatedly repolarized optically, thus\nproviding an effectively infinite polarization reservoir. A saturation of the\npolarization in the nuclear \"frozen core\" is achieved, which is confirmed by\nthe decay of the polarization transfer signal and shows an excellent agreement\nwith theoretical simulations. Hereby we introduce the Polarization Read Out by\nPolarization Inversion (PROPI) method as a quantitative magnetization measure\nof the nuclear spin bath. Moreover, we show that using the integrated solid\neffect both for single and double quantum transitions a nuclear spin\npolarization can be achieved even when the static magnetic field is not aligned\nalong the NV's crystal axis. This opens a path for the application of our DNP\ntechnique to spins in and outside of nanodiamonds, enabling their application\nas MRI tracers.\n", "  The Fermi bubbles, two giant gamma-ray bubbles above and below the Galactic\ncenter (GC), are among the most important findings of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope. Because of the proximity, spatially resolved, multi-wavelength\nobservations offer excellent opportunities to learn about the physical origin\nof the bubbles. One of the unique features of the observed bubbles is that\ntheir gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ~110 GeV and the\noverall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy\nspectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin as it could be a signature\nof synchrotron and inverse-Compton (IC) cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons;\nhowever, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should\nbe spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the formation of the Fermi\nbubble in the leptonic jet scenario using a newly implemented CRSPEC module in\nFLASH that allows us to track the evolution of CR spectrum on-the-fly during\nthe simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast\nsynchrotron and IC cooling near the GC when the jets were first launched. After\nthe jets propagate away from the GC, the dynamical timescale of the jets become\nthe shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is\nessentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the\nbubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of\nthe bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at early stage\nof the bubble expansion. We find that the CR spatial and spectral distribution\npredicted by the leptonic jet model can simultaneously match the normalization,\nspectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and\ntheir spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely\nmechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles.\n", "  In quantum wires, such as metallic nanotubes, the optical absorption of the\ntransverse polarization is controlled by the depolarization effect which stems\nfrom the redistribution of conduction electrons around the circumference of the\nsystem. The traditional electrostatics treatment of the depolarization effect\nrelies on approximating the system by a cylinder with some effective dielectric\npermittivity. We demonstrate that this simple intuitive picture does not\nadequately describe optical absorption near its threshold, as the\ndepolarization effect becomes dominated by many-body correlations which\nstrongly modify the spectral dependence of absorption.\n", "  Phenomena involving electron transfer are ubiquitous in nature,\nphotosynthesis and enzymes or protein activity being prominent examples. Their\ndeep understanding thus represents a mandatory scientific goal. Moreover,\ncontrolling the separation of photogenerated charges is a crucial prerequisite\nin many applicative contexts, including quantum electronics,\nphoto-electrochemical water splitting, photocatalytic dye degradation, and\nenergy conversion. In particular, photoinduced charge separation is the pivotal\nstep driving the storage of sun light into electrical or chemical energy. If\nproperly mastered, these processes may also allow us to achieve a better\ncommand of information storage at the nanoscale, as required for the\ndevelopment of molecular electronics, optical switching, or quantum\ntechnologies, amongst others. In this Topical review we survey recent progress\nin the understanding of ultrafast charge separation from photoexcited states.\nWe report the state-of-the-art of the observation and theoretical description\nof charge separation phenomena in the ultrafast regime mainly focusing on\nmolecular- and nano-sized solar energy conversion systems. In particular, we\nexamine different proposed mechanisms driving ultrafast charge dynamics, with\nparticular regard to the role of quantum coherence and electron-nuclear\ncoupling, and link experimental observations to theoretical approaches based\neither on model Hamiltonians or on first principles simulations.\n", "  We study two-dimensional (2D) matter-wave solitons in spinor Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) under the action of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\nopposite signs of the self- and cross-interactions. Stable 2D two-component\nsolitons of the mixed-mode (MM) type are found if the cross-interaction between\nthe components is attractive, while the self-interaction is repulsive in each\ncomponent. Stable solitons of the semi-vortex type are formed in the opposite\ncase, under the action of competing self-attraction and cross-repulsion. The\nsolitons exist with the total norm taking values below a collapse threshold.\nFurther, in the case of the repulsive self-interaction and inter-component\nattraction, stable 2D self-trapped modes, which may be considered as quantum\ndroplets (QDs), are created if the beyond-mean-field Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) terms\nare added to the self-repulsion in the underlying system of coupled\nGross-Pitaevskii equations. Stable QDs of the MM type, of a large size with an\nanisotropic density profile, exist with arbitrarily large values of the norm,\nas the LHY terms eliminate the collapse. The effect of the SOC term on\ncharacteristics of the QDs is systematically studied. We also address the\nexistence and stability of QDs in the case of SOC with mixed Rashba and\nDresselhaus terms, which makes the density profile of the QD more isotropic.\nThus, QDs in the spin-orbit-coupled binary BEC are for the first time studied\nin the present work.\n", "  We establish a correspondence among simple objects of the relative commutant\nof a full fusion subcategory in a larger fusion category in the sense of\nDrinfeld, irreducible half-braidings of objects in the larger fusion category\nwith respect to the fusion subcategory, and minimal central projections in the\nrelative tube algebra. Based on this, we explicitly compute certain relative\nDrinfeld commutants of fusion categories arising from $\\alpha$-induction for\nbraided subfactors. We present examples arising from chiral conformal field\ntheory.\n", "  The scaling of plasmoid instability maximum linear growth rate with respect\nto Lundquist number $S$ in a Sweet-Parker current sheet, $\\gamma_{max}\\sim\nS^{1/4}$, indicates that at high $S$, the current sheet will break apart before\nit approaches the Sweet-Parker width. Therefore, a proper description for the\nonset of the plasmoid instability must incorporate the evolving process of the\ncurrent sheet. We carry out a series of two-dimensional simulations and develop\ndiagnostics to separate fluctuations from an evolving background. It is found\nthat the fluctuation amplitude starts to grow only when the linear growth rate\nis sufficiently large ($\\gamma_{max}\\tau_{A}>O(1)$) to overcome convective\nlosses. The linear growth rate continues to rise until the sizes of plasmoids\nbecome comparable to the inner layer width of the tearing mode. At this point\nthe current sheet is disrupted and the instability enters the early nonlinear\nregime. The growth rate suddenly decreases, but the fluctuation amplitude\ncontinues to grow until it reaches nonlinear saturation. We identify important\ntime scales of the instability development, as well as scalings for the linear\ngrowth rate, current sheet width, and dominant wavenumber at current sheet\ndisruption. These scalings depend on not only the Lundquist number, but also\nthe initial noise amplitude. A phenomenological model that reproduces scalings\nfrom simulation results is proposed. The model incorporates the effect of\nreconnection outflow, which is crucial for yielding a critical Lundquist number\n$S_{c}$ below which disruption does not occur. The critical Lundquist number\n$S_{c}$ is not a constant value but has a weak dependence on the noise\namplitude.\n", "  We introduce a predictive algorithm for the smart growth of cities with\npopulations upward of 100,000, allowing for extensive simulations of growth\nplans and their effects upon an urban populous. A smart growth metric is\ncalculated to evaluate the progress of a city at each phase of its adaptation\nof the growth plan, which is measured using a weighted entropy method. The\npredictive algorithm itself is built from a unique differential model, which\ncalculates the growth of a city from smart growth proposals that are\nindividually assessed by a logistic weight model. These proposals are then\nsorted based on effectiveness and efficiency observed from the simulations,\ngiving insight into the best approach to providing the target cities with a\nhopeful future.\n", "  From the non-extensive statistical mechanics, we investigate the chiral phase\ntransition at finite temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\\mu_B$ in\nthe framework of the linear sigma model. The corresponding non-extensive\ndistribution, based on Tsallis' statistics, is characterized by a dimensionless\nnon-extensive parameter, $q$, and the results in the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs case\nare recovered when $q\\to 1$. The thermodynamics of the linear sigma model and\nits correspodning phase diagram are analysed. At high temperature region, the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ is shown to decrease with increasing $q$ from the\nphase diagram in the $(T,~\\mu)$ plane. However, larger values of $q$ causes the\nrise of $T_c$ at low temperature but high chemical potential. Moreover, it is\nfound that $\\mu$ different from zero corresponds to a first-order phase\ntransition while $\\mu=0$ to a crossover one. The critical endpoint (CEP)\ncarries higher chemical potential but lower temperature with $q$ increasing due\nto the non-extensive effects.\n", "  Entropy production of an active particle in an external potential is\nidentified through a thermodynamically consistent minimal lattice model that\nincludes the chemical reaction providing the propulsion and ordinary\ntranslational noise. In the continuum limit, a unique expression follows,\ncomprising a direct contribution from the active process and an indirect\ncontribution from ordinary diffusive motion. From the corresponding Langevin\nequation, this physical entropy production cannot be inferred through the\nconventional, yet here ambiguous, comparison of forward and time-reversed\ntrajectories. Generalizations to several interacting active particles and\npassive particles in a bath of active ones are presented explicitly, further\nones are briefly indicated.\n", "  Controllable, coherent many-body systems can provide insights into the\nfundamental properties of quantum matter, enable the realization of new quantum\nphases and could ultimately lead to computational systems that outperform\nexisting computers based on classical approaches. Here we demonstrate a method\nfor creating controlled many-body quantum matter that combines\ndeterministically prepared, reconfigurable arrays of individually trapped cold\natoms with strong, coherent interactions enabled by excitation to Rydberg\nstates. We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable\ninteractions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe\nphase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete\nsymmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and\ninvestigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms.\nIn particular, we observe robust manybody dynamics corresponding to persistent\noscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a\nsudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of\nexploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could\nenable realizations of new quantum algorithms.\n", "  In 5d transition metal oxides, novel properties arise from the interplay of\nelectron correlations and spin--orbit interactions. Na4IrO4, where 5d\ntransition-metal Ir atom occupies the center of the square-planar coordination\nenvironment, is synthesized. Based on density functional theory, we calculate\nits electronic and magnetic properties. Our numerical results show that the\nIr-5d bands are quite narrow, and the bands around the Fermi level are mainly\ncontributed by d_{xy},d_{yz} and d_{zx} orbitals. The magnetic easy-axis is\nperpendicular to the IrO4 plane, and the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of\nNa4IrO4 is found to be very giant. We estimate the magnetic parameters by\nmapping the calculated total energy for different spin configurations onto a\nspin model. The next nearest neighbor exchange interaction J2 is much larger\nthan other intersite exchange interactions and results in the magnetic ground\nstate configuration. Our study clearly demonstrates that the huge MAE comes\nfrom the single-ion anisotropy rather than the anisotropic interatomic spin\nexchange. This compound has a large spin gap but very narrow spin-wave\ndispersion, due to the large single-ion anisotropy and relatively small\nexchange couplings. Noticing this remarkable magnetic feature originated from\nits highly isolated IrO4 moiety, we also explore the possiblity to further\nenhance the MAE.\n", "  We generalize the derivative expansion (DE) approach to the interaction\nbetween almost-flat smooth surfaces, to the case of surfaces which are\noptimally described in cylindrical coordinates. As in the original form of the\nDE, the obtained method does not depend on the nature of the interaction. We\napply our results to the study of the static, zero-temperature Casimir effect\nbetween two cylindrical surfaces, obtaining approximate expressions which are\nreliable under the assumption that the distance between those surfaces is\nalways much smaller than their local curvature radii. To obtain the zero-point\nenergy, we apply known results about the thermal Casimir effect for a planar\ngeometry. To that effect, we relate the time coordinate in the latter to the\nangular variable in the cylindrical case, as well as the temperature to the\nradius of the cylinders. We study the dependence of the applicability of the DE\non the kind of interaction, considering the particular cases where Dirichlet or\nNeumann conditions are applied to a scalar field.\n", "  The essential ingredients of nuclear astrophysics are the thermonuclear\nreactions which shape the life and death of stars and which are responsible for\nthe synthesis of the chemical elements in the Universe. Deep underground in the\nGran Sasso Laboratory the cross sections of the key reactions responsible for\nthe hydrogen burning in stars have been measured with two accelerators of 50\nand 400 kV voltage right down to the energies of astrophysical interest. As a\nmatter of fact, the main advantage of the underground laboratory is the\nreduction of the background. Such a reduction has allowed, for the first time,\nto measure relevant cross sections at the Gamow energy. The qualifying features\nof underground nuclear astrophysics are exhaustively reviewed before discussing\nthe current LUNA program which is mainly devoted to the study of the Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis and of the synthesis of the light elements in AGB stars and\nclassical novae. The main results obtained during the study of reactions\nrelevant to the Sun are also reviewed and their influence on our understanding\nof the properties of the neutrino, of the Sun and of the Universe itself is\ndiscussed. Finally, the future of LUNA during the next decade is outlined. It\nwill be mainly focused on the study of the nuclear burning stages after\nhydrogen burning: helium and carbon burning. All this will be accomplished\nthanks to a new 3.5 MV accelerator able to deliver high current beams of\nproton, helium and carbon which will start running under Gran Sasso in 2019. In\nparticular, we will discuss the first phase of the scientific case of the 3.5\nMV accelerator focused on the study of $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C and of the two\nreactions which generate free neutrons inside stars:\n$^{13}$C($\\alpha$,n)$^{16}$O and $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg.\n", "  We discuss the design and construction of a novel target array of nonmagnetic\ntest masses used in a neutron polarimetry measurement made in search for new\npossible exotic spin dependent neutron-atom interactions of Nature at\nsub\\,-$mm$ length scales. This target was designed to accept and efficiently\ntransmit a transversely polarized slow neutron beam through a series of long\nopen parallel slots bounded by flat rectangular plates. These openings\npossessed equal atom density gradients across the slots from the flat test\nmasses with dimensions optimized to achieve maximum sensitivity to an exotic\nspin-dependent interaction from vector boson exchanges with ranges in the\nmillimeter to micron regime. The parallel slots were oriented differently in\nfour quadrants that can be rotated about the neutron beam axis using a Geneva\ndrive. The spin rotation signals from the 4 quadrants were measured using a\nsegmented neutron ion chamber in parallel to suppress possible systematic\nerrors from stray magnetic fields in the target region. Design constraints and\nsystematic effects are discussed.\n", "  The Young double-slit interference pattern produced by quantum objects, like\nphotons, that move through a double-slit is regarded, by the conventional\nCopenhagen interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, as the evidence of the\nwave-like behaviour potentially contained in the wave function. On the\ncontrary, a more realistic view of this phenomenon considers the quantum object\na particle accompanied by a pilot wave which would be the cause of the\ninterference fringes. This paper proposes a feasible experiment, based on an\neasy variation of the nowadays common double-slit experimental set-ups, aimed\nat detecting the effects of the pilot wave once 'detached' from the particles\nthat it steers. Besides, a further realistic idea, based on the geometrical\nviolation of Local Lorentz Invariance (LLI), is put forward as to the intrinsic\nnature of the photon. This new idea along with the possibly positive results of\nthe experiment would allow us to shed new light on the real nature of quantum\nobjects in term of the geometrical violation of LLI.\n", "  The two-dimensional boron monolayers were reported to be metallic both in\nprevious theoretical predictions and experimental observations, however, we\nhave firstly found a family of boron monolayers with the novel semiconducting\nproperty as confirmed by the first-principles calculations with the\nquasi-particle G0W0 approach. We demonstrate that the vanished metallicity\ncharacterized by the pz-derived bands cross the Fermi level is attributed to\nthe motif of a triple-hexagonal-vacancy, with which various semiconducting\nboron monolayers are designed to realize the band-gap engineering for the\npotential applications in electronic devices. The semiconducting boron\nmonolayers in our predictions are expected to be synthesized on the proper\nsubstrates, due to the similar stabilities to the ones observed experimentally.\n", "  Various social, financial, biological and technological systems can be\nmodeled by interdependent networks. It has been assumed that in order to remain\nfunctional, nodes in one network must receive the support from nodes belonging\nto different networks. So far these models have been limited to the case in\nwhich the failure propagates across networks only if the nodes lose all their\nsupply nodes. In this paper we develop a more realistic model for two\ninterdependent networks in which each node has its own supply threshold, i.e.,\nthey need the support of a minimum number of supply nodes to remain functional.\nIn addition, we analyze different conditions of internal node failure due to\ndisconnection from nodes within its own network. We show that several local\ninternal failure conditions lead to similar nontrivial results. When there are\nno internal failures the model is equivalent to a bipartite system, which can\nbe useful to model a financial market. We explore the rich behaviors of these\nmodels that include discontinuous and continuous phase transitions. Using the\ngenerating functions formalism, we analytically solve all the models in the\nlimit of infinitely large networks and find an excellent agreement with the\nstochastic simulations.\n", "  It is presented an exact solution of straight spinning cosmic strings in\nBrans-Dicke theory of gravitation. The possibility of the existence of closed\ntimelike curves around these cosmic strings is analyzed. Furthermore, the\nstability about the formation of the topological defect discussed here is\nchecked. It is shown the existence of a suitable choice for the integration\nconstants in which closed timelike curves are not allowed. We also verify if it\nis possible that the obtained spacetime can be the source that describes the\nobserved rotational curves in some galaxies.\n", "  We investigate the precision with which a neutron star gravitational binding\nenergy can be measured through the supernova neutrino signal, without assuming\nany prior such as the energy equipartition hypothesis, mean energies hierarchy\nor constraints on the pinching parameters that characterize the neutrino\nspectra. We consider water Cherenkov detectors and prove that combining inverse\nbeta decay with elastic scattering on electrons is sufficient to reach $11\\%$\nprecision on the neutron star gravitational binding energy already with\nSuper-Kamiokande. The inclusion of neutral current events on oxygen in the\nanalysis does not improve the precision further. We show that $3\\%$ precision\ncan be achieved if priors are introduced, such as energy equipartition. We\ndiscuss the implications of our findings on the properties of the newly formed\nneutron star, in particular concerning the assessment of the compactness or\nmass--radius relation.\n", "  Van-der-Waals heterostructures have become a paradigm for designing new\nmaterials and devices, in which specific functionalities can be tailored by\ncombining the properties of the individual 2D layers. A single layer of\ntransition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is an excellent complement to graphene\n(Gr), since the high quality of charge and spin transport in Gr is enriched\nwith the large spin-orbit coupling of the TMD via proximity effect. The\ncontrollable spin-valley coupling makes these heterostructures particularly\nattractive for spintronic and opto-valleytronic applications. In this work, we\nstudy spin precession in a monolayer MoSe2/Gr heterostructure and observe an\nunconventional, dramatic modulation of the spin signal, showing one order of\nmagnitude longer lifetime of out-of-plane spins (40 ps) compared with that of\nin-plane spins (3.5 ps). This demonstration of a large spin lifetime anisotropy\nin TMD/Gr heterostructures, is a direct evidence of induced spin-valley\ncoupling in Gr and provides an accessible route for manipulation of spin\ndynamics in Gr, interfaced with TMDs.\n", "  We present the design of an inductively shunted transmon qubit with\nflux-tunable coupling to an embedded harmonic mode. This circuit construction\noffers the possibility to flux-choose between pure transverse and pure\nlongitudinal coupling, that is coupling to the $\\sigma_x$ or $\\sigma_z$ degree\nof freedom of the qubit. While transverse coupling is the coupling type that is\nmost commonly used for superconducting qubits, the inherently different\nlongitudinal coupling has some remarkable advantages both for readout and for\nthe scalability of a circuit. Being able to choose between both kinds of\ncoupling in the same circuit provides the flexibility to use one for coupling\nto the next qubit and one for readout, or vice versa. We provide a detailed\nanalysis of the system's behavior using realistic parameters, along with a\nproposal for the physical implementation of a prototype device.\n", "  Memory-assisted measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution\n(MA-MDI-QKD) is a promising scheme that aims to improve the\nrate-versus-distance behavior of a QKD system by using the state-of-the-art\ndevices. It can be seen as a bridge between current QKD links to quantum\nrepeater based networks. While, similar to quantum repeaters, MA-MDI-QKD relies\non quantum memory (QM) units, the requirements for such QMs are less demanding\nthan that of probabilistic quantum repeaters. Here, we present a variant of\nMA-MDI-QKD structure that relies on only a single physical QM: a\nnitrogen-vacancy center embedded into a cavity where its electronic spin\ninteracts with photons and its nuclear spin is used for storage. This enables\nus to propose a simple but efficient MA-MDI-QKD scheme resilient to memory\nerrors and capable of beating, in terms of rate and reach, existing QKD\ndemonstrations. We also show how we can extend this setup to a quantum repeater\nsystem, reaching, thus, larger distances.\n", "  We analyzed the high-resolution spectra of a large sample of AGB and RGB\nstars in the Galactic globular clusters (GCs) NGC 104, NGC 6121, and NGC 6809\nobtained with FLAMES/GIRAFFE at ESO/VLT, and determined their Na abundances.\nThis is the first time that the AGB stars in NGC 6809 are targeted. Moreover,\nwe reanalyzed with the same method the data archive for NGC 6752. To\ninvestigate the dependence of AGB Na abundance dispersion on GC parameters, we\ncompared the AGB [Na/H] distributions we obtained (including NGC 2808 presented\nin the first paper of this series) with literature data for four other GCs,\ni.e., a total of nine GCs, covering a wide range of GC parameters. We find that\nNGC 104 and NGC 6809 have comparable AGB and RGB Na abundance distributions\nrevealed by the K-S test, while NGC 6121 shows a lack of very Na-rich AGB star.\nBy analyzing all the nine GCs, the Na abundances and multiple populations of\nAGB stars show a complex picture. In some GCs, AGB stars have similar Na\nabundances and/or second-population fractions as their RGB counterparts, while\nsome GCs do not have Na-rich second-population AGB star, and various cases\nexist between the two extremes. In addition, the fitted relations between\nfractions of AGB second population and GC global parameters show that AGB\nsecond-population fraction slightly anticorrelates with GC central\nconcentration, while no robust dependency can be confirmed with other GC\nparameters. Current data roughly support the prediction of FRMS scenario.\nHowever, considering the weak observational and theoretical trends where\nscatter and exceptions exist, the fraction of second-population AGB stars can\nbe affected by more than one or two factors, and may even be a result of\nstochasticity.\n", "  To study the effect of parity-violation on the rate of complexity growth, by\nusing \"Complexity=Action\" conjecture, we find the complexity growth rates in\ndifferent solutions of the chiral theory of Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG)\nand parity-preserving theory of New Massive Gravity (NMG). Using the results,\none can see that decreasing the parameter $\\mu$, which increases the effect of\nChern-Simons term and increases chirality, would increase the rate of growth of\ncomplexity. Also one can observe a stronger correlation between complexity\ngrowth and temperature rather than complexity growth and entropy. At the end we\ncomment on the possible meaning of the deforming term of chiral Liouville\naction for the rate of complexity growth of warped CFTs in the Tensor Network\nRenormalization picture.\n", "  We study the correlators of the 2d W_N minimal model in the semiclassical\nregime with large central charge from bulk viewpoint by utilizing open Wilson\nlines in sl(N) Chern-Simons gauge theory. We extend previous works for the tree\nlevel of bulk theory to incorporate loop corrections in this paper. We offer a\nway to regularize divergences associated with loop diagrams such that three\npoint functions with two scalars and a higher spin current agree with the\nvalues fixed by the boundary W_N symmetry. With the prescription, we reproduce\nthe conformal weight of the operator corresponding to a bulk scalar up to the\ntwo loop order for explicit examples with N=2,3.\n", "  We considered the semiclassical Rabi model, that is, a two-level system\ninteracting with a single-mode, classical field. In resonance and for an\narbitrary initial state of the system, we obtained a simple, approximate, and\nanalytic solution that takes into account the counterrotating terms and that is\naccurate as long as the Rabi frequency is smaller than or equal to 1/2 (1/4) of\nthe angular frequency of the field and 1 (10) Rabi oscillations are considered.\nIn addition, the approximate solution has the same level of complexity as that\nobtained with the rotating-wave-approximation (RWA) and allows one to describe\nthe evolution of the Bloch vector of the system in terms of a\n\\textit{slow-precessional} and a \\textit{fast-nutational} motion similar to\nthat of a symmetric top with one point fixed. Finally, the approximate solution\nalso leads to a simple criterion that allows one to determine the accuracy of\nthe solution in the RWA.\n", "  Using scaling arguments and the property of self-similarity we derive the\nCasimir energies of Sierpinski triangles and Sierpinski rectangles. The\nHausdorff-Besicovitch dimension (fractal dimension) of the Casimir energy is\nintroduced and the Berry-Weyl conjecture is discussed for these geometries. We\npropose that for a class of fractals, comprising of compartmentalized cavities,\nit is possible to establish a finite value to the Casimir energy even while the\nCasimir energy of the individual cavities consists of divergent terms.\n", "  The generation of the plasma current resulting from Bremsstrahlung absorption\nis considered. It is shown that the electric current is higher than the naive\nestimates assuming that electrons absorb only the photon momentum and using the\nSpitzer conductivity would suggest. The current enhancement is in part because\nelectrons get the recoil momentum from the Coulomb field of ions during the\nabsorption and in part because the electromagnetic power is absorbed\nasymmetrically within the electron velocity distribution space.\n", "  A statistical model description of heavy ion induced fusion-fission reactions\nis presented where shell effects, collective enhancement of level density,\ntilting away effect of compound nuclear spin and dissipation are included. It\nis shown that the inclusion of all these effects provides a consistent picture\nof fission where fission hindrance is required to explain the experimental\nvalues of both pre-scission neutron multiplicities and evaporation residue\ncross-sections in contrast to some of the earlier works where a fission\nhindrance is required for pre-scission neutrons but a fission enhancement for\nevaporation residue cross-sections.\n", "  This paper presents single lepton and dilepton kinematic distributions\nmeasured in dileptonic $t\\bar{t}$ events produced in 20.2 fb$^{-1}$ of\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collisions recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.\nBoth absolute and normalised differential cross-sections are measured, using\nevents with an opposite-charge $e\\mu$ pair and one or two $b$-tagged jets. The\ncross-sections are measured in a fiducial region corresponding to the detector\nacceptance for leptons, and are compared to the predictions from a variety of\nMonte Carlo event generators, as well as fixed-order QCD calculations,\nexploring the sensitivity of the cross-sections to the gluon parton\ndistribution function. Some of the distributions are also sensitive to the top\nquark pole mass; a combined fit of NLO fixed-order predictions to all the\nmeasured distributions yields a top quark mass value of $m_t^{\\rm\npole}=173.2\\pm 0.9\\pm0.8\\pm1.2$ GeV, where the three uncertainties arise from\ndata statistics, experimental systematics, and theoretical sources.\n", "  Charged-particle multiplicity distributions are an interesting tool to study\nboth soft- and hard-QCD processes in hadronic collisions. Since last century a\nsignificant range of center-of-mass energies has been probed, ranging from a\nfew GeV to 13 TeV in the latest LHC run. Common analysis of multiplicity\ndistributions at different energies, in different phase space regions and from\nsufficiently different experiments provides a way to systematize and review\nexisting phenomenological models of multiple particle production. In this work\na phenomenological model is suggested, that can describe simultaneously\ncharged-particle multiplicity distributions in different restricted\npseudorapidity intervals for proton-proton collisions. The model is\nsuccessfully applied to experimental results of ALICE experiment at LHC.\n", "  We present the results of the systematic study of all magnetar outbursts\nobserved to date, through a reanalysis of data acquired in about 1100 X-ray\nobservations. We track the temporal evolution of the outbursts soft X-ray\nspectral properties and the luminosities of the single spectral components as\nwell as of the total emission. We model empirically all outburst light curves,\nand estimate the characteristic decay time-scales as well as the energetics\ninvolved. We investigate the link between different parameters (e.g. the\nluminosity at the peak of the outburst and in quiescence, the maximum\nluminosity increase, the decay time-scale and energy of the outburst, the\nneutron star surface dipolar magnetic field and characteristic age, etc.), and\nunveil several correlations among these quantities. We discuss our results in\nthe context of the internal crustal heating and twisted bundle models for\nmagnetar outbursts. This study is complemented by the Magnetar Outburst Online\nCatalogue (http://magnetars.ice.csic.es), an interactive data base where the\nuser can plot any combination of the parameters derived in this work, and\ndownload all data.\n", "  We present the clustering properties and halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nmodelling of very low redshift, hard X-ray-detected active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) using cross-correlation function measurements with Two-Micron All Sky\nSurvey galaxies. Spanning a redshift range of $0.007 < z < 0.037$, with a\nmedian $z=0.024$, we present a precise AGN clustering study of the most local\nAGN in the Universe. The AGN sample is drawn from the SWIFT/BAT 70-month and\nINTEGRAL/IBIS eight year all-sky X-ray surveys and contains both type I and\ntype II AGN. We find a large-scale bias for the full AGN sample of\n$b=1.04^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$, which corresponds to a typical host dark matter halo\nmass of $M_{\\rm h}^{\\rm typ}=12.84^{+0.22}_{-0.30}\\,h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$. When\nsplit into low and high X-ray luminosity and type I and type II AGN subsamples,\nwe detect no statistically significant differences in the large-scale bias\nparameters. However, there are differences in the small-scale clustering which\nare reflected in the full HOD model results. We find that low and high X-ray\nluminosity AGN, as well as type I and type II AGN, occupy dark matter haloes\ndifferently, with 3.4$\\sigma$ and 4.0$\\sigma$ differences in their mean halo\nmasses, respectively, when split by luminosity and type. The latter finding\ncontradicts a simple orientation-based AGN unification model. As a by-product\nof our cross-correlation approach, we also present the first HOD model of 2MASS\ngalaxies.\n", "  We determine polarized parton distribution functions (PPDFs) and structure\nfunctions from recent experimental data of polarized deep inelastic scattering\n(DIS) on nuleons at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) approximation in\nperturbative quantum chromodynamic (pQCD). The nucleon polarized structure\nfunctions are computed using the Jacobi polynomial approach while target mass\ncorrections (TMCs) are included in our fitting procedure. Having extracted the\npolarized spin structure functions, we extend our study to describe $^3{\\mathrm\nHe}$ and $^3{\\mathrm H}$ polarized structure functions, as well as the Bjorken\nsum rule. We also explore the importance of the nuclear corrections on the\npolarized nuclear structure functions at small and large values of $x$. Our\nresults are compared with the recent available and high precision polarized\n$^3{\\mathrm He}$ and $^3{\\mathrm H}$ experimental data.\n", "  We explore the simplification of widely used meta-generalized-gradient\napproximation (mGGA) exchange-correlation functionals to the Laplacian level of\nrefinement by use of approximate kinetic energy density functionals (KEDFs).\nSuch deorbitalization is motivated by the prospect of reducing computational\ncost while recovering a strictly Kohn-Sham local potential framework (rather\nthan the usual generalized Kohn-Sham treatment of mGGAs). A KEDF that has been\nrather successful in solid simulations proves to be inadequate for\ndeorbitalization but we produce other forms which, with parametrization to\nKohn-Sham results (not experimental data) on a small training set, yield rather\ngood results on standard molecular test sets when used to deorbitalize the\nmeta-GGA made very simple, TPSS, and SCAN functionals. We also study the\ndifference between high-fidelity and best-performing deorbitalizations and\ndiscuss possible implications for use in ab initio molecular dynamics\nsimulations of complicated condensed phase systems.\n", "  This paper introduces the Sheffield Magnetohydrodynamics Algorithm Using GPUs\n(SMAUG+), an advanced numerical code for solving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nproblems, using multi-GPU systems. Multi-GPU systems facilitate the development\nof accelerated codes and enable us to investigate larger model sizes and/or\nmore detailed computational domain resolutions. This is a significant\nadvancement over the parent single-GPU MHD code, SMAUG (Griffiths, M., Fedun,\nV., and Erd\\'elyi, R. (2015). A fast MHD code for gravitationally stratified\nmedia using graphical processing units: SMAUG. Journal of Astrophysics and\nAstronomy,36(1):197-223). Here, we demonstrate the validity of the SMAUG+ code,\ndescribe the parallelisation techniques and investigate performance benchmarks.\nThe initial configuration of the Orszag-Tang vortex simulations are distributed\namong 4, 16, 64 and 100 GPUs. Furthermore, different simulation box resolutions\nare applied: $1000 \\times 1000$, $2044 \\times 2044$, $4000 \\times 4000$ and\n$8000 \\times 8000$. We also tested the code with the Brio-Wu shock tube\nsimulations with model size of 800 employing up to 10 GPUs. Based on the test\nresults, we observed speed ups and slow downs, depending on the granularity and\nthe communication overhead of certain parallel tasks. The main aim of the code\ndevelopment is to provide massively parallel code without the memory limitation\nof a single GPU. By using our code, the applied model size could be\nsignificantly increased. We demonstrate that we are able to successfully\ncompute numerically valid and large 2D MHD problems.\n", "  Dynamic mode decomposition has emerged as a leading technique to identify\nspatiotemporal coherent structures from high-dimensional data, benefiting from\na strong connection to nonlinear dynamical systems via the Koopman operator. In\nthis work, we integrate and unify two recent innovations that extend DMD to\nsystems with actuation [Proctor et al., 2016] and systems with heavily\nsubsampled measurements [Brunton et al., 2015]. When combined, these methods\nyield a novel framework for compressive system identification [code is publicly\navailable at: https://github.com/zhbai/cDMDc]. It is possible to identify a\nlow-order model from limited input-output data and reconstruct the associated\nfull-state dynamic modes with compressed sensing, adding interpretability to\nthe state of the reduced-order model. Moreover, when full-state data is\navailable, it is possible to dramatically accelerate downstream computations by\nfirst compressing the data. We demonstrate this unified framework on two model\nsystems, investigating the effects of sensor noise, different types of\nmeasurements (e.g., point sensors, Gaussian random projections, etc.),\ncompression ratios, and different choices of actuation (e.g., localized,\nbroadband, etc.). In the first example, we explore this architecture on a test\nsystem with known low-rank dynamics and an artificially inflated state\ndimension. The second example consists of a real-world engineering application\ngiven by the fluid flow past a pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. This\nexample provides a challenging and realistic test-case for the proposed method,\nand results demonstrate that the dominant coherent structures are well\ncharacterized despite actuation and heavily subsampled data.\n", "  We carried out an optical polarimetric study in the direction of the RCW95\nstar forming region in order to probe the sky-projected magnetic field\nstructure by using the distribution of linear polarization segments which seem\nto be well aligned with the more extended cloud component. A mean polarization\nangle of $\\theta=49.8^o\\pm7.7^o$ was derived. Through the spectral dependence\nanalysis of polarization it was possible to obtain the total-to-selective\nextinction ratio ($R_V$) by fitting the Serkowski function, resulting in a mean\nvalue of $R_V=2.93\\pm0.47$. The foreground polarization component was estimated\nand is in agreement with previous studies in this direction of the Galaxy.\nFurther, near-infrared images from Vista Variables in the Via L\\'actea (VVV)\nsurvey were collected to improve the study of the stellar population associated\nwith the HII region. The Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis (ASteCA) algorithm\nwas employed to derive structural parameters for two clusters in the region,\nand a set of PAdova and TRieste Stellar Evolution Code (PARSEC) isochrones was\nsuperimposed on the decontaminated colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to estimate\nan age of about 3 Myr for both clusters. Finally, from the near-infrared\nphotometry study combined with spectra obtained with the Ohio State Infrared\nImager and Spectrometer (OSIRIS) mounted at the Southern Astrophysics Research\nTelescope (SOAR) we derived the spectral classification of the main ionizing\nsources in the clusters associated with IRAS 15408$-$5356 and IRAS\n15412$-$5359, both objects classified as O4 V stars.\n", "  It is shown that the notion of Conformal Mass can be defined within a given\nanti-de Sitter (AdS) branch of a Lovelock gravity theory as long as the\ncorresponding vacuum is not degenerate. Indeed, conserved charges obtained by\nthe addition of Kounterterms to the bulk action turn out to be proportional to\nthe electric part of the Weyl tensor, when the fall-off of a generic solution\nin that AdS branch is considered. The factor of proportionality is the\ndegeneracy condition for the vacua in the particular Lovelock AdS theory under\nstudy. This last feature explains the obstruction to define Conformal Mass in\nthe degenerate case.\n", "  In a micro ring of a superconductor with a spin-triplet equal-spin pairing\nstate, a fluxoid, a combined object of magnetic flux and circulating\nsupercurrent, can penetrate as half-integer multiples of the flux quantum. A\ncandidate material to investigate such half-quantum fluxoids is\nSr$_\\mathsf{2}$RuO$_\\mathsf{4}$. We fabricated Sr$_\\mathsf{2}$RuO$_\\mathsf{4}$\nmicro rings using single crystals and measured their resistance behavior under\nmagnetic fields controlled with a three-axes vector magnet. Proper Little-Parks\noscillations in the magnetovoltage as a function of an axially applied field,\nassociated with fluxoid quantization are clearly observed, for the first time\nusing bulk single crystalline superconductors. We then performed magnetovoltage\nmeasurements with additional in-plane magnetic fields. By carefully analyzing\nboth the voltages $V_+$ ($V_-$) measured at positive (negative) current, we\nfind that, above an in-plane threshold field of about 10 mT, the magnetovoltage\nmaxima convert to minima. We interpret this behavior as the peak splitting\nexpected for the half-quantum fluxoid states.\n", "  Computing properties of the set of precursors of a given configuration is a\ncommon problem underlying many important questions about cellular automata.\nUnfortunately, such computations quickly become intractable in dimension\ngreater than one. This paper presents an algorithm --- incremental aggregation\n--- that can compute aggregate properties of the set of precursors\nexponentially faster than na{\\\"i}ve approaches. The incremental aggregation\nalgorithm is demonstrated on two problems from the two-dimensional binary Game\nof Life cellular automaton: precursor count distributions and higher-order mean\nfield theory coefficients. In both cases, incremental aggregation allows us to\nobtain new results that were previously beyond reach.\n", "  The phase uncertainty of an unseeded nonlinear interferometer, where the\noutput of one nonlinear crystal is transmitted to the input of a second crystal\nthat analyzes it, is commonly said to be below the shot-noise level but highly\ndependent on detection and internal loss. Unbalancing the gains of the first\n(source) and second (analyzer) crystals leads to a configuration that is\ntolerant against detection loss. However, in terms of sensitivity, there is no\nadvantage in choosing a stronger analyzer over a stronger source, and hence the\ncomparison to a shot-noise level is not straightforward. Internal loss breaks\nthis symmetry and shows that it is crucial whether the source or analyzer is\ndominating. Based on these results, claiming a Heisenberg scaling of the\nsensitivity is more subtle than in a balanced setup.\n", "  The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope with its main instrument on-board, the\nLarge Area Telescope (LAT), opened a new era in the study of high-energy\nemission from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). When combined with contemporaneous\nground- and space-based observations, Fermi-LAT achieves its full capability to\ncharacterize the jet structure and the emission mechanisms at work in\nradio-loud AGN with different black hole mass and accretion rate, from flat\nspectrum radio quasars to narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies.\n  Here, I discuss important findings regarding the blazar population included\nin the third LAT catalog of AGN and the gamma-ray emitting NLSy1. Moreover, the\ndetection of blazars at redshift beyond three in gamma rays allows us to\nconstrain the growth and evolution of heavy black holes over cosmic time,\nsuggesting that the radio-loud phase may be important for a fast black hole\ngrowth in the early Universe. Finally, results on extragalactic objects from\nthe third catalog of hard LAT sources are presented.\n", "  Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) are the cornerstone of the hyperlens, which\nbrings the superresolution effect from the near-field to the far-field zone.\nFor effective application of the hyperlens it should operate in so-called\ncanalization regime, when the phase advancement of the propagating fields is\nmaximally supressed, and thus field broadening is minimized. For conventional\nhyperlenses it is relatively straightforward to achieve canalization by tuning\nthe anisotropic permittivity tensor. However, for a dark-field hyperlens\ndesigned to image weak scatterers by filtering out background radiation\n(dark-field regime) this approach is not viable, because design requirements\nfor such filtering and elimination of phase advancement i.e. canalization, are\nmutually exclusive. Here we propose the use of magnetic ($\\mu$-positive and\nnegative) HMMs to achieve phase cancellation at the output equivalent to the\nperformance of a HMM in the canalized regime. The proposed structure offers\nadditional flexibility over simple HMMs in tuning light propagation. We show\nthat in this ``pseudocanalizing'' configuration quality of an image is\ncomparable to a conventional hyperlens, while the desired filtering of the\nincident illumination associated with the dark-field hyperlens is preserved.\n", "  In the context of the gauge/gravity duality applications, we study and\ncompute the entanglement entropy of gauge theories corresponding to string/M\ntheories on D3-, M2- and M5-brane backgrounds. This is achieved using the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula. We obtain the entanglement entropy for the general\ncases of the D3-, M2- and M5-brane backgrounds and also for the near horizon\nAdS limit, as well as the non-conformal flat space limit in each case.\n", "  We present a method for calculating the dynamical degree of a mapping with\nunconfined singularities. It is based on a method introduced by Halburd for the\ncomputation of the growth of the iterates of a rational mapping with confined\nsingularities. In particular, we show through several examples how simple\ncalculations, based on the singularity patterns of the mapping, allow one to\nobtain the exact value of the dynamical degree for nonintegrable mappings that\ndo not possess the singularity confinement property. We also study linearisable\nmappings with unconfined singularities to show that in this case our method\nindeed yields zero algebraic entropy.\n", "  We introduce two-dimensional borane, a single-layered material of BH\nstoichiometry, with promising electronic properties. We show that, according to\nDensity Functional Theory calculations, two-dimensional borane is semimetallic,\nwith two symmetry-related Dirac cones meeting right at the Fermi energy $E_f$.\nThe curvature of the cones is lower than in graphene, thus closer to the ideal\nlinear dispersion. Its structure, formed by a puckered trigonal boron network\nwith hydrogen atoms connected to each boron atom, can be understood as\ndistorted, hydrogenated borophene (Science \\textbf{350}, 1513 (2015)). Chemical\nbonding analysis reveals the boron layer in the network being bound by\ndelocalized four-center two-electron ${\\sigma}$ bonds. Finally, we suggest\nhigh-pressure could be a feasible route to synthesise two-dimensional borane.\n", "  In the recently-published paper \"Gold Nanobipyramid-Enhanced Hydrogen Sensing\nwith Plasmon Red Shifts Reaching 140 nm at 2 vol% Hydrogen Concentration\" by\nYip et al.,[1] the authors claimed that the tuning of catalytic activities of\nthe synthesized Au nanobipyramids(NBP)@Pd nanostructures was mainly due to the\nelectronic effect. Here, we show that this claim is unsupported and an\nimportant reference was mis-cited in this commented publication.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that the relatively inert, highly symmetric,\nneutral flavor singlet scalar hadron made of uuddss quarks may have a mass < 2\n(m_p + m_e). This is consistent with QCD theory, and with existing accelerator\nand non-accelerator constraints. For mass in the 1.5-1.8 GeV range, the\nobserved DM relic abundance and the observed DM to ordinary matter ratio can\nemerge naturally. Dark matter freezes out before primordial nucleosynthesis and\ndoes not significantly impact primordial abundances, so the conventional\nargument that DM is non-baryonic does not apply. The interaction cross section\nbetween DM and the gas in the Galaxy is such that the dark matter in our local\nneighborhood is naturally co-rotating with the solar system, to a sufficient\ndegree that DM may not have enough energy to be detected in applicable DM\nexperiments. Interaction with the gas in galactic disks provides the first\n(non-MONDian) explanation for the striking correlation in the small-scale\nstructure of rotation curves and the inhomogeneous distribution of gas, and\nalso accounts (unlike MOND) for instances of galaxies not exhibiting such\ncorrelations. Depending on the cross-section, a DM-baryon interaction can\nproduce a dark matter disk as suggested by recent studies, and has many or all\nvirtues of self-interacting DM (SIDM) for removing inconsistencies of LCDM. Lab\nexperiments to discover this particle are discussed.\n", "  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of 10^9-10^10 Msun were already in place ~13\nGyr ago, at z>6. Super-Eddington growth of low-mass BH seeds (~100 Msun) or\nless extreme accretion onto ~10^5 Msun seeds have been recently considered as\nthe main viable routes to these SMBHs. Here we study the statistics of these\nSMBH progenitors at z~6. The growth of low- and high-mass seeds and their host\ngalaxies are consistently followed using the cosmological data constrained\nmodel GAMETE/QSOdust, which reproduces the observed properties of high-z\nquasars, like SDSS J1148+5251. We show that both seed formation channels can be\nin action over a similar redshift range, 15 < z < 18 and are found in dark\nmatter halos with comparable mass, ~5x10^7 Msun. However, as long as the\nsystems evolve in isolation (i.e. no mergers occur), noticeable differences in\ntheir properties emerge: at z>= 10 galaxies hosting high-mass seeds have\nsmaller stellar mass and metallicity, the BHs accrete gas at higher rates and\nstar formation proceeds less efficiently than in low-mass seeds hosts. At z<10\nthese differences are progressively erased, as the systems experience minor or\nmajor mergers and every trace of the BH origin gets lost.\n", "  Characterization of the primary events involved in the $cis-trans$\nphotoisomerization of the rhodopsin retinal chromophore was approximated by a\nminimum one-dimensional quantum-classical model. The developed mathematical\nmodel is identical to that obtained using conventional quantum-classical\napproaches, and multiparametric quantum-chemical or molecular dynamics (MD)\ncomputations were not required. The quantum subsystem of the model includes\nthree electronic states for rhodopsin: (i) the ground state, (ii) the excited\nstate, and (iii) the primary photoproduct in the ground state. The resultant\nmodel is in perfect agreement with experimental data in terms of the quantum\nyield, the time required to reach the conical intersection and to complete the\nquantum evolution, the range of the characteristic low frequencies active\nwithin the primary events of the $11-cis$ retinal isomerization, and the\ncoherent character of the photoreaction. An effective redistribution of excess\nenergy between the vibration modes of rhodopsin was revealed by analysis of the\ndissipation process. The results confirm the validity of the minimal model,\ndespite its one-dimensional character. The fundamental nature of the\nphotoreaction was therefore demonstrated using a minimum mathematical model for\nthe first time.\n", "  We introduce a novel jet substructure method which exploits the variation of\nobservables with respect to a sampling of phase-space boundaries quantified by\nthe variability. We apply this technique to identify boosted W boson and top\nquark jets using telescoping subjets which utilizes information coming from\nsubjet topology and that coming from subjet substructure. We find excellent\nperformance of the variability, in particular its robustness against finite\ndetector resolution. The extension to telescoping jet grooming and other\ntelescoping jet substructure observables is also straightforward. This method\nprovides a new direction in heavy particle tagging and suggests a systematic\napproach to the decomposition of jet substructure.\n", "  We present the explicit dark-bright three soliton solution and the associated\nspectral problem for the variable coefficient integrable coupled NLS equation.\nUsing asymptotic analysis as well as graphical analysis we study the\ninteractions in soliton complexes. We present a correlation between the soliton\nparameters and the interaction pattern in three soliton complexes. Using\nasymptotic analysis, we present a few interesting features of complex three\nsoliton bound state and interaction of dark-bright two soliton complex with a\nregular soliton. Using three soliton interactions we have shown that the energy\nsharing take place between soliton even when the soliton do not collide with\neach other. The results found by us might be useful for the development of\nsoliton control, all optical gates as well as all optical switching devices. We\nhope that the analysis of three soliton complexes would be useful for a better\nunderstanding of soliton interactions in nonlinear fiber as well as in a bulk\nmedium.\n", "  Starting from type IIB string theory on an $ADE$ singularity, the (2,0)\nlittle string arises when one takes the string coupling $g_s$ to 0. In this\nsetup, we give a unified description of the codimension-two defects of the\nlittle string, for any simple Lie algebra ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. Geometrically,\nthese are D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles of the singularity. Equivalently, the\ndefects are specified by a certain set of weights of $^L {\\mathfrak{g}}$, the\nLanglands dual of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$. As a first application, we show that the\npartition function of the ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-type quiver gauge theory on the\ndefect is equal to the 3-point conformal block of the ${\\mathfrak{g}}$-type\n$q$-deformed Toda theory in the Coulomb gas formalism. As a second application,\nwe make contact with Bala--Carter theory to show that in the CFT limit, the\nCoulomb branch of the defects flows to a nilpotent orbit of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$,\nand that all nilpotent orbits of ${\\mathfrak{g}}$ arise in this way.\n", "  The Tunka Radio Extension (Tunka-Rex) is an array of 63 antennas located in\nthe Tunka Valley, Siberia. It detects radio pulses in the 30-80 MHz band\nproduced during the air-shower development. As shown by Tunka-Rex, a sparse\nradio array with about 200 m spacing is able to reconstruct the energy and the\ndepth of the shower maximum with satisfactory precision using simple methods\nbased on parameters of the lateral distribution of amplitudes. The LOFAR\nexperiment has shown that a sophisticated treatment of all individually\nmeasured amplitudes of a dense antenna array can make the precision comparable\nwith the resolution of existing optical techniques. We develop these ideas\nfurther and present a method based on the treatment of time series of measured\nsignals, i.e. each antenna station provides several points (trace) instead of a\nsingle one (amplitude or power). We use the measured shower axis and energy as\ninput for CoREAS simulations: for each measured event we simulate a set of\nair-showers with proton, helium, nitrogen and iron as primary particle (each\nprimary is simulated about ten times to cover fluctuations in the shower\nmaximum due to the first interaction). Simulated radio pulses are processed\nwith the Tunka-Rex detector response and convoluted with the measured signals.\nA likelihood fit determines how well the simulated event fits to the measured\none. The positions of the shower maxima are defined from the distribution of\nchi-square values of these fits. When using this improved method instead of the\nstandard one, firstly, the shower maximum of more events can be reconstructed,\nsecondly, the resolution is increased. The performance of the method is\ndemonstrated on the data acquired by the Tunka-Rex detector in 2012-2014.\n", "  We consider propagation of a probe pulse in an atomic medium characterized by\na combined tripod and Lambda ($\\Lambda$) atom-light coupling scheme. The scheme\ninvolves three atomic ground states coupled to two excited states by five light\nfields. It is demonstrated that dark states can be formed for such an\natom-light coupling. This is essential for formation of the electromagnetically\ninduced transparency (EIT) and slow light. In the limiting cases the scheme\nreduces to conventional $\\Lambda$- or $N$-type atom-light couplings providing\nthe EIT or absorption, respectively. Thus the atomic system can experience a\ntransition from the EIT to the absorption by changing the amplitudes or phases\nof control lasers. Subsequently the scheme is employed to analyze the nonlinear\npulse propagation using the coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations. It is shown that\ngeneration of stable slow light optical solitons is possible in such a\nfive-level combined tripod and $\\Lambda$ atomic system.\n", "  First principles phase diagram calculations, that included van der Waals\ninteractions, were performed for the bulk transition metal dichalcogenide\nsystem $(1-X) \\cdot WS_{2} - (X) \\cdot WTe_{2}$. To obtain a converged phase\ndiagram, a series of cluster expansion calculations were performed with\nincreasing numbers of structure-energies, ($N_{Str}$) up to $N_{Str}=435$, used\nto fit the cluster expansion Hamiltonian. All calculated formation energies are\npositive and all ground-state analyses predict that formation energies for\nsupercells with 16 or fewer anion sites are positive; but when $\\approx 150\nN_{Str} \\leq 376$, false ordered ground-states are predicted. With $N_{Str}\n\\geq 399$, only a miscibility gap is predicted, but one with dramatic asymmetry\nopposite to what one expects from size-effect considerations; i.e. the\ncalculations predict more solubility on the small-ion S-rich side of the\ndiagram and less on the large-ion Te-rich side. This occurs because S-rich\nlow-energy metastable ordered configurations have lower energies than their\nTe-rich counterparts.\n", "  In the field of rehabilitation and neuroscience shape memory alloys play a\ncrucial role as lightweight actuators. Devices are exploiting the shape memory\neffect by transforming heat into mechanical work. In rehabilitation\napplications, dynamic loading of the respective device occurs, which in turn\ninfluences the mechanical consequences of the phase transforming alloy. Hence\nin this work, dynamic thermomechanical material behavior of temperature\ntriggered phase transforming NiTi shape memory alloy wires with different\nchemical compositions and geometries is experimentally investigated. Storage\nmodulus and mechanical loss factor of NiTi alloys at different temperatures and\nloading frequencies are analyzed under force controlled conditions.\nCounterintuitive storage modulus and loss factor dependent trends regarding the\nloading frequency dependency of the mechanical properties on the materials\ncomposition and geometry are hence obtained. It could be revealed that loss\nfactors show a pronounced loading frequency dependency, whereas the storage\nmodulus was not affected. It is shown that force controlled conditions lead to\na lower storage modulus than expected. Further it turned out that a simple\nempirical relation can capture the characteristic temperature dependency of the\nstorage modulus, which is an important input relation for modeling the\nrehabilitation device behavior under different dynamic and temperature loading\nconditions, taking directly into account the material behavior of the shape\nmemory alloy.\n", "  This paper reviews and suggests a resolution of the problem of definite\noutcomes of measurement. This problem, also known as \"Schrodinger's cat,\" has\nlong posed an apparent paradox because the state resulting from a measurement\nappears to be a quantum superposition in which the detector is in two\nmacroscopically distinct states (alive and dead in the case of the cat)\nsimultaneously. Many alternative interpretations of the quantum mathematical\nformalism, and several alternative modifications of the theory, have been\nproposed to resolve this problem, but no consensus has formed supporting any\none of them. Applying standard quantum theory to the measurement state,\ntogether with the analysis and results of decades of nonlocality experiments\nwith pairs of entangled systems, this paper shows the entangled measurement\nstate is not a paradoxical macroscopic superposition of states. It is instead a\nphase-dependent superposition of correlations between states of the subsystems.\nThus Schrodinger's cat is a non-paradoxical \"macroscopic correlation\" in which\none of the two correlated systems happens to be a detector. This insight\nresolves the problem of definite outcomes but it does not entirely resolve the\nmeasurement problem because the entangled state is still reversible.\n", "  We demonstrate an x-ray beam splitter with high performances for\nmulti-kilo-electron-volt photons. The device is based on diffraction on\nkinoform structures, which overcome the limitations of binary diffraction\ngratings. This beam splitter achieves a dynamical splitting ratio in the range\n0-99.1% by tilting the optics and is tunable, here shown in a photon energy\nrange of 7.2-19 keV. High diffraction efficiency of 62.6% together with an\nextinction ratio of 0.6% is demonstrated at 12.4 keV, with angular separation\nfor the split beam of 0.5 mrad. This device can find applications in beam\nmonitoring at synchrotrons, at x-ray free electron lasers for online\ndiagnostics and beamline multiplexing and, possibly, as key elements for delay\nlines or ultrashort x-ray pulses manipulation.\n", "  Neutrino oscillation physics has entered the precision era and the potential\nforthcoming experiments Hyper-Kamiokande and Deep Under-ground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE) are expected to lead this endeavor. In this paper we perform\na comprehensive study of the octant, mass hierarchy and CP discovery\nsensitivities of DUNE, T2HK & T2HKK in their individual capacity and\ninvestigate the synergies of the aforementioned experiments with the on going\nT2K and NO$\\nu$A experiments. We present a comparative account of the\nprobabilities at the three baselines and explore in detail the physics issues\nwhich can cause the discrepancies in the sensitivities among the different\nexperiments. We also find out the optimal exposure required by these\nexperiments for achieving $5\\sigma$ hierarchy and octant sensitivity and to\ndiscover CP violation at $3\\sigma$ for 60\\% values of $\\delta_{CP}$. In\naddition we vary the neutrino-antineutrino runtime ratios for T2HK & T2HKK and\ncheck if the sensitivities are affected significantly due to this.\n", "  The MAJORANA Collaboration has assembled an array of high purity Ge detectors\nto search for neutrinoless double-beta decay in $^{76}$Ge with the goal of\nestablishing the required background and scalability of a Ge-based\nnext-generation ton-scale experiment. The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR consists of 44\nkg of high-purity Ge (HPGe) detectors (30 kg enriched in $^{76}$Ge) with a\nlow-noise p-type point contact (PPC) geometry. The detectors are split between\ntwo modules which are contained in a single lead and high-purity copper shield\nat the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. Following a\ncommissioning run that started in June 2015, the full detector array has been\nacquiring data since August 2016. We will discuss the status of the MAJORANA\nDEMONSTRATOR and initial results from the first physics run; including current\nbackground estimates, exotic low-energy physics searches, projections on the\nphysics reach of the DEMONSTRATOR, and implications for a ton-scale Ge-based\nneutrinoless double-beta decay search.\n", "  Heart disease is one of leading causes of mortality worldwide. Healthy heart\nvalves are key for proper heart function. When these valves dysfunction, a\nreplacement is often necessary in severe cases. The current study presents an\ninvestigation of the pulsatile blood flow through a bileaflet mechanical heart\nvalve (BMHV) where one leaflet is healthy and can fully open and the other\nleaflet cannot fully open with different levels of dysfunction. To better\nunderstand the implications that a dysfunctional leaflet has on the blood flow\nthrough these valves, analysis of flow characteristics such as velocity,\npressure drop, wall shear stress and vorticity profiles was performed. Results\nsuggested that leaflet dysfunction caused increased local velocities,\nseparation regions and wall shear stresses. For example, the maximum velocity\nincreased from 2.53 m/s to 4.9 m/s when dysfunction increased from 0% to 100%.\nThe pressure drop increased (by up to 300%) with dysfunctionality. Results\nsuggested that leaflet dysfunction also caused increased wall shear stresses on\nthe valve frame where higher stresses developed around the hinges (at 75% and\n100% dysfunctions). Analysis also showed that increased dysfunctionality of one\nleaflet led to higher net shear forces on both the healthy and dysfunctional\nleaflets (by up to 200% and 600%, respectively).\n", "  Machine Learning techniques have been used to teach computer programs how to\nplay games as complicated as Chess and Go. These were achieved using powerful\ntools such as Neural Networks and Parallel Computing on Supercomputers. In this\npaper, we define a model of populational growth and evolution based on the idea\nof Reinforcement Learning, but using only the 3 sources stated in the title\nprocessed on a low-tier laptop. The model correctly predicts the development of\na population around food sources and their migration in search of a new one\nwhen the known ones become saturated. Additionally, we compared our model to a\npure random one and the population number was fitted to a logistic function for\ntwo interesting evolutions of the system.\n", "  Near-field optical microscopy can be used as a viable route to understand the\nnanoscale material properties below the diffraction limit. On the other hand,\natomically thin two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nare the materials of recent interest to study the spatial confinement of charge\ncarriers, photon, and phonons. Heterostructures based on Mo or W based\nmonolayer TMDs form type-II band alignment, and hence the optically excited\ncarriers can be easily separated for applications pertaining to photonics and\nelectronics. Mapping these spatially confined carriers or photons in a\nheterostructure with nanoscale resolution as well as their recombination\nbehavior at the interfaces are necessary for the effective use of these\nmaterials in future high performance optoelectronics. We performed tip-enhanced\nphotoluminescence (TEPL) imaging to increase the spatial resolution on\nmulti-junction monolayer MoSe2-WSe2 lateral heterostructures grown by chemical\nvapor deposition (CVD) method. The near-field nano-PL emission map was used to\ndistinguish the presence of distinct crystalline boundaries and the\nheterogeneities across the interfaces. This method significantly improves the\nnanoscale resolution of 2D materials, especially for understanding the PL\nemission properties at the vicinity of hetero-interfaces.\n", "  The current paper summarizes the content of a talk given on vacuum Cherenkov\nradiation emitted by Lorentz-violating fermions that are described in the\ncontext of the Standard-Model Extension. The decay rate will be obtained for\nvarious sets of controlling coefficients that will subsequently be constrained\nusing cosmic-ray data.\n", "  Two-dimensional boron sheets (borophenes) have been successfully synthesized\nin experiments and are expected to exhibit intriguing transport properties such\nas the emergence of superconductivity and Dirac Fermions. However, quantitative\nunderstanding of intrinsic electrical transport of borophene has not been\nachieved. Here, we report a comprehensive first-principles study on\nelectron-phonon driven intrinsic electrical resistivity (\\r{ho}) of emerging\nborophene structures. We find that the resistivity is highly dependent on the\natomic structures and electron density of borophene. Low-temperature\nresistivity of borophene \\r{ho} exhibits a universal scaling behavior, which\nincreases rapidly with temperature T (\\r{ho}~T^4), while \\r{ho} increases\nlinearly for a large temperature window T > 100 K. It is observed that this\nuniversal behavior of intrinsic resistivity is well described by\nBloch-Gr\\\"unesisen model. Different from graphene and conventional\nthree-dimensional metals, the intrinsic resistivity of borophenes can be easily\ntuned by adjusting carrier densities while the Bloch-Gr\\\"unesisen temperature\nis nearly fixed at ~100 K. Our work suggests monolayer boron can serve as an\nintriguing platform for realizing high-tunable two-dimensional electronic\ndevices.\n", "  Random fiber laser (RFL) based on random distributed feedback and Raman gain\nhas earned much attention in recent years. In this presentation, we demonstrate\na powerful linearly polarized RFL with spectral adjustment, in which the\ncentral wavelength and the linewidth of the spectrum can be tuned independently\nthrough a bandwidth-adjustable tunable optical filter (BA-TOF). As a result,\nthe central wavelength can be continuously tuned from 1095 to 1115 nm, while\nthe full width at half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth has a maximal tuning range from\n~0.6 to more than 2 nm. This laser provides a flexible tool for scenes where\nthe temporal coherence property accounts, such as coherent\nsensing/communication and nonlinear frequency conversion. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first demonstration of a high power linearly polarized\nRFL with both wavelength and linewidth tunability.\n", "  We report the first experimental two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectra of\nnovel molecular photonic excitations - vibrational-polaritons. The application\nof advanced 2D IR spectroscopy onto novel vibrational-polariton challenges and\nadvances our understanding in both fields. From spectroscopy aspect, 2D IR\nspectra of polaritons differ drastically from free uncoupled molecules; from\nvibrational-polariton aspects, 2D IR uniquely resolves hybrid light-matter\npolariton excitations and unexpected dark states in a state-selective manner\nand revealed hidden interactions between them. Moreover, 2D IR signals\nhighlight the role of vibrational anharmonicities in generating non-linear\nsignals. To further advance our knowledge on 2D IR of vibrational polaritons,\nwe develop a new quantum-mechanical model incorporating the effects of both\nnuclear and electrical anharmonicities on vibrational-polaritons and their 2D\nIR signals. This work reveals polariton physics that is difficult or impossible\nto probe with traditional linear spectroscopy and lays the foundation for\ninvestigating new non-linear optics and chemistry of molecular\nvibrational-polaritons.\n", "  We theoretically study the conditional counting statistics of electron\ntransport through a system consisting of a single quantum dot (SQD) or\ncoherently coupled double quantum dots (DQD's) monitored by a nearby quantum\npoint contact (QPC) using the generating functional approach with the maximum\neigenvalue of the evolution equation matrix method, the quantum trajectory\ntheory method (Monte Carlo method), and an efficient method we develop. The\nconditional current cumulants that are significantly different from their\nunconditional counterparts can provide additional information and insight into\nthe electron transport properties of mesoscopic nanostructure systems. The\nefficient method we develop for calculating the conditional counting statistics\nis numerically stable, and is capable of calculating the conditional counting\nstatistics for a more complex system than the maximum eigenvalue method and for\na wider range of parameters than the quantum trajectory method. We apply our\nmethod to investigate how the QPC shot noise affects the conditional counting\nstatistics of the SQD system, going beyond the treatment and parameter regime\nstudied in the literature. We also investigate the case when the interdot\ncoherent coupling is comparable to the dephasing rate caused by the back action\nof the QPC in the DQD system, in which there is considerable discrepancy in the\ncalculated conditional current cumulants between the population rate (master-)\nequation approach of sequential tunneling and the full quantum master-equation\napproach of coherent tunneling.\n", "  Even the most sophisticated artificial neural networks are built by\naggregating substantially identical units called neurons. A neuron receives\nmultiple signals, internally combines them, and applies a non-linear function\nto the resulting weighted sum. Several attempts to generalize neurons to the\nquantum regime have been proposed, but all proposals collided with the\ndifficulty of implementing non-linear activation functions, which is essential\nfor classical neurons, due to the linear nature of quantum mechanics. Here we\npropose a solution to this roadblock in the form of a small quantum circuit\nthat naturally simulates neurons with threshold activation. Our quantum circuit\ndefines a building block, the \"quantum neuron\", that can reproduce a variety of\nclassical neural network constructions while maintaining the ability to process\nsuperpositions of inputs and preserve quantum coherence and entanglement. In\nthe construction of feedforward networks of quantum neurons, we provide\nnumerical evidence that the network not only can learn a function when trained\nwith superposition of inputs and the corresponding output, but that this\ntraining suffices to learn the function on all individual inputs separately.\nWhen arranged to mimic Hopfield networks, quantum neural networks exhibit\nproperties of associative memory. Patterns are encoded using the simple Hebbian\nrule for the weights and we demonstrate attractor dynamics from corrupted\ninputs. Finally, the fact that our quantum model closely captures (traditional)\nneural network dynamics implies that the vast body of literature and results on\nneural networks becomes directly relevant in the context of quantum machine\nlearning.\n", "  Molecular polaritons have gained considerable attention due to their\npotential to control nanoscale molecular processes by harnessing\nelectromagnetic coherence. Although recent experiments with liquid-phase\nvibrational polaritons have shown great promise for exploiting these effects,\nsignificant challenges remain in interpreting their spectroscopic signatures.\nIn this letter, we develop a quantum-mechanical theory of pump-probe\nspectroscopy for this class of polaritons based on the quantum Langevin\nequations and the input-output theory. Comparison with recent experimental data\nshows good agreement upon consideration of the various vibrational\nanharmonicities that modulate the signals. Finally, a simple and intuitive\ninterpretation of the data based on an effective mode-coupling theory is\nprovided. Our work provides a solid theoretical framework to elucidate\nnonlinear optical properties of molecular polaritons as well as to analyze\nfurther multidimensional spectroscopy experiments on these systems.\n", "  The initial results from timing observations of PSR J1141-6545, a\nrelativistic pulsar white-dwarf binary system, are presented. Predictions from\nthe timing baseline hint at the most stringent test of gravity by an asymmetric\nbinary yet. The timing precision has been hindered by the dramatic variations\nof the pulse profile due to geodetic precession, a pulsar glitch and red timing\nnoise. Methods to overcome such timing irregularities are briefly presented\nalong with preliminary results from the test of the General Theory of\nRelativity (GR) from this pulsar\n", "  Upon photo- or electrical-excitation, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are often\nfound in multi-carrier states due to multi-photon absorption and photo-charging\nof the QDs. While many of these multi-carrier states are observed in single-dot\nspectroscopy, their properties are not well studied due to random\ncharging/discharging, emission intensity intermittency, and uncontrolled\nsurface defects of single QD. Here we report in-situ deciphering the charging\nstatus, and precisely assessing the absorption cross section, and determining\nthe absolute emission quantum yield of mono-exciton and biexciton states for\nneutral, positively-charged, and negatively-charged single core/shell CdSe/CdS\nQD. We uncover very different photon statistics of the three charge states in\nsingle QD and unambiguously identify their charge sign together with the\ninformation of their photoluminescence decay dynamics. We then show their\ndistinct photoluminescence saturation behaviors and evaluated the absolute\nvalues of absorption cross sections and quantum efficiencies of monoexcitons\nand biexcitons. We demonstrate that addition of an extra hole or electron in a\nQD changes not only its emission properties but also varies its absorption\ncross section.\n", "  We construct periodic solutions of nonlinear wave equations using analytic\ncontinuation. The construction applies in particular to Einstein equations,\nleading to infinite-dimensional families of time-periodic solutions of the\nvacuum, or of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-scalar\nfields-Yang-Mills-Higgs-Chern-Simons-$f(R)$ equations, with a negative\ncosmological constant.\n", "  A nanometric needle sensor mounted in an Atomic Force Microscopy allows\nsystematic picometer-range distance measurements. This force sensing device is\nused in Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) as a distance sensor, by employing\nthe cantilever spring constant as the conversion factor opening a pathway to\nexplore the piezoelectric effect at the nanoscale. The force-distance\nequivalence is achieved if the force sensor does not disturb the system to\nstudy, solely. In this manuscript we report a systematic study in which\ndifferent Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) materials, having different d33 values,\nare measured following the standard theory available for PFM. Both in resonance\nand out of resonance measurements demonstrate that PFM cannot be considered\nquantitative. After performing the measurements, we propose a correction of the\nstandard theory employed in PFM by considering the force exerted by the\nmaterial as a variable. The g33 parameter, inherent to piezoelectricity,\ngoverns the amount of force available from the system. A comparison of\npiezoelectric stiffness for the case of a nanoscale site contact region,\nsimilar to the one it is found while performing PFM, is provided. Such\nstiffness is well below the cantilever stiffness, limiting and diminishing the\nmaterial movement, as the piezoelectric material does not have enough stroke to\ninduce the intended displacement. A correction factor, named Open\nPiezopotential Gauge, accounts for these effects, which is used to correct the\nmeasurements carried out in PZT materials towards a real quantitative PFM.\n", "  The A/F-type stars and pulsators ($\\delta$ Scuti-$\\gamma$ Dor) are in a\ncritical regime where they experience the transition from radiative to\nconvective transport of energy in their envelopes. Such stars can pulsate in\nboth gravity and acoustic modes. Hence, the knowledge of their fundamental\nparameters along with their observed pulsation characteristics can help in\nimproving the stellar models. When residing in a binary system, these pulsators\nprovide more accurate and less model dependent stellar parameters than in the\ncase of their single counterparts. We present a light curve model for the\neclipsing system KIC 6048106 based on the \\textit{Kepler} photometry and the\ncode PHOEBE. We aim to obtain accurate physical parameters and tough\nconstraints for the stellar modelling of this intermediate-mass hybrid\npulsator. We performed a separate modelling of three light curve segments that\nshow a distinct behaviour due to a difference in activity. We also analysed the\n\\textit{Kepler} ETVs. KIC 6048106 is an Algol-type binary with F5-K5\ncomponents, a near-circular orbit and a 1.56-d period undergoing variations of\nthe order of $\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\simeq 3.60\\times10^{-7}$ in $287\\pm7$ days.\nThe primary component is a main-sequence star with\n$M_{1}=1.55\\pm0.11M_{\\odot}$,~$R_{1}=1.57\\pm0.12R_{\\odot}$. The secondary is a\nmuch cooler subgiant with $M_{2}=0.33\\pm0.07M_{\\odot}$,~$R_{2}=1.77\n\\pm0.16R_{\\odot}$. Many small near-polar spots are active on its surface. The\nsecond quadrature phase shows a brightness modulation on a time scale $290\\pm7$\ndays, in good agreement with the ETV modulation. This study reveals a stable\nbinary configuration along with clear evidence of a long-term activity of the\nsecondary star.\n", "  We present Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the magnetic interactions\nbetween a solar type star and short period hot Jupiter exoplanets, using the\npublicly available MHD code PLUTO. It has been predicted that emission due to\nmagnetic interactions such as the electron cyclotron maser instability (ECMI)\nwill be observable. In our simulations, a planetary outflow, due to UV\nevaporation of the exoplanets atmosphere, results in the build-up of\ncircumplanetary material. We predict the ECMI emission and determine that the\nemission is prevented from escaping from the system. This is due to the\nevaporated material leading to a high plasma frequency in the vicinity of the\nplanet, which inhibits the ECMI process.\n", "  Reconnection physics at micro-scales is investigated in an electron\nmagnetohydrodynamics frame. A new process of collapse of the neutral current\nsheet is demonstrated by means of analytical and numerical solutions. It shows\nhow at scales smaller than ion inertia length a compression of the sheet\ntriggers an explosive evolution of current perturbation. Collapse results in\nthe formation of a intense sub-sheet and then an X-point structure embedded\ninto the equilibrium sheet. Hall currents associated with this structure\nsupport high reconnection rates. Nonlinear static solution at scales of the\nelectron skin reveals that electron inertia and small viscosity provide an\nefficient mechanism of field lines breaking. The reconnection rate does not\ndepend on the actual value of viscosity, while the maximum current is found to\nbe restricted even for space plasmas with extremely rare collisions. The\nresults obtained are verified by a two-fluid large-scale numerical simulation.\n", "  We present results of 3D numerical simulations of magnetically confined,\nradiatively driven stellar winds of massive stars, conducted using the\nastrophysical MHD code Pluto, with a focus on understanding the rotational\nvariability of radio and sub-mm emission. Radiative driving is implemented\naccording to the Castor, Abbott and Klein theory of radiatively driven winds.\nMany magnetic massive stars posses a magnetic axis which is inclined with\nrespect to the rotational axis. This misalignment leads to a complex wind\nstructure as magnetic confinement, centrifugal acceleration and radiative\ndriving act to channel the circumstellar plasma into a warped disk whose\nobservable properties should be apparent in multiple wavelengths. This\nstructure is analysed to calculate free-free thermal radio emission and\ndetermine the characteristic intensity maps and radio light curves.\n", "  We theoretically investigate multiphonons resonance Raman scattering between\nthe Landau levels in graphene on the polar substrate using the Huang-Rhys's\nmodel. We not only present the single and multiple surface optical (SO) phonons\nscattering, but also propose the combined multiphonons scattering (CMS), which\nis composed of the SO phonon and longitudinal acoustic phonon. We find that the\nCMS has a blue-shift behavior with increasing the magnetic field, differing\nfrom these SO phonon resonance scattering at a special magnetic field. This\nbehavior may be used to explain the changing shoulder of the Raman spectrum of\noptical phonon resonance scattering in experiments. The theoretical model could\nbe expanded to analyze the fine structure of Raman spectrum in two-dimensional\nmaterials.\n", "  Low metallicity massive stars hold the key to interpret numerous processes in\nthe past Universe including re-ionization, starburst galaxies, high-redshift\nsupernovae and GRBs. The Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy (SagDIG,\n12+log(O/H)=7.37) represents an important landmark in the quest for analogues\naccessible with 10-m class telescopes. This paper presents low-resolution\nspectroscopy executed with the Gran Telescopio Canarias that confirms that\nSagDIG hosts massive stars. The observations unveiled three OBA-type stars and\none red supergiant candidate. Pending confirmation from high-resolution\nfollow-up studies, these could be the most metal-poor massive stars of the\nLocal Group.\n", "  We give a new expression for the law of the eigenvalues of the discrete\nAnderson model on the finite interval $[0,N]$, in terms of two random processes\nstarting at both ends of the interval. Using this formula, we deduce that the\ntail of the eigenvectors behaves approximatelylike $\\exp(\\sigma\nB\\_{|n-k|}-\\gamma\\frac{|n-k|}{4})$ where $B\\_{s}$ is the Brownian motion and\n$k$ is uniformly chosen in $[0,N]$ independentlyof $B\\_{s}$. A similar result\nhas recently been shown by B. Rifkind and B. Virag in the critical case, that\nis, when the random potential is multiplied by a factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$\n", "  Meteorites contain minerals from Solar System asteroids with different\nproperties (like size, presence of water, core formation). We provide new\nmid-IR transmission spectra of powdered meteorites to obtain templates of how\nmid-IR spectra of asteroidal debris would look like. This is essential for\ninterpreting mid-IR spectra of past and future space observatories, like the\nJames Webb Space Telescope. We show that the transmission spectra of wet and\ndry chondrites, carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and achondrite and\nchondrite meteorites are distinctly different in a way one can distinguish in\nastronomical mid-IR spectra. The two observables that spectroscopically\nseparate the different meteorites groups (and thus the different types of\nparent bodies) are the pyroxene-olivine feature strength ratio and the peak\nshift of the olivine spectral features due to an increase in the iron\nconcentration of the olivine.\n", "  Influence of the exchange interaction on the properties of the spin-electron\nacoustic waves at the oblique propagation of waves relatively to the external\nmagnetic field in the magnetically ordered metals is studied. The spectra of\nthe Langmuir wave and the Trivelpiece-Gould wave are also considered. It is\nwell-known that there are two branches of spectrum of the spin-electron\nacoustic waves in this regime. Change their properties under influence of the\nexchange interaction is studied. The quantum Bohm potential is included either.\nThe exchange interaction and quantum Bohm potential gives opposite\ncontributions, but they do not compensate each other since they have different\ndependence on the wave vector. This competition creates a non-monotonical\nbehavior of the Trivelpiece-Gould wave spectrum. The concavity changes in the\nmonotonic spectra of the Langmuir wave and the SEAWs are found.\n", "  During the peak of their accretion phase, supermassive black holes in\ngalactic cores are known to emit very high levels of ionizing radiation,\nbecoming visible over intergalactic distances as quasars or active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). Here, we quantify the extent to which the activity of the\nsupermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A*\n(Sgr A*), may have affected the habitability of Earth-like planets in our\nGalaxy. We focus on the amount of atmospheric loss and on the possible\nbiological damage suffered by planets exposed to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet\n(XUV) radiation produced during the peak of the active phase of Sgr A*. We find\nthat terrestrial planets could lose a total atmospheric mass comparable to that\nof present day Earth even at large distances (~1 kiloparsec) from the galactic\ncenter. Furthermore, we find that the direct biological damage caused by Sgr A*\nto surface life on planets not properly screened by an atmosphere was probably\nsignificant during the AGN phase, possibly hindering the development of complex\nlife within a few kiloparsecs from the galactic center.\n", "  The main purpose of scattering experiments is to unveil the underlying\nstructure of the colliding particles and their interaction. Typically one\nmeasures scattering observables (cross sections and polarizations) at discrete\nangles and energies and mutually consistent data may validate or falsify\nproposed theories or models. However, the accumulation of data from different\nlaboratories while potentially improves the statistical significance it may\nsometimes generate mutually inconsistent data as a side-effect. Thus, some\ndecision has to be made on what are the maximal amount of data which are\nmutually compatible. We show elastic $\\pi N $ and $NN$ scattering as prominent\nexamples where this selection is called for. We discuss how it can be done in a\nself-consistent manner invoking a principle of maximal consensus of the\ndatabase and with the help of a sufficiently flexible model involving a minimal\nnumber of theoretical assumptions. In the NN case this has become possible with\na combination of long distance field theoretical constraints at the hadronic\nlevel such as pion exchanges and electromagnetic effects and a coarse graining\nof the unknown interaction over the shortest de Broglie wavelength being probed\nin the scattering process.\n", "  In the present paper the result of numerical simulations of the model based\non the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism with bistability between hidden and rare\nattractors in the presence of noise are studied.\n", "  Human ability to visualize an image is usually hindered by optical\nscattering. Recent extensive studies have promoted imaging technique through\nturbid materials to a reality where color image can be restored behind\nscattering media in real time. The big challenge now is to recover a 3D object\nin a large field of view with depth resolving ability. Here, we reveal a new\nphysical relationship between speckles generated from objects at different\nplanes. With a single given point spread function, 3D imaging through\nscattering media is achieved even beyond the depth of field (DOF). Experimental\ntesting of standard scattering media shows that the original DOF can be\nextended up to 5 times and the physical mechanism is depicted. This extended 3D\nimaging is expected to have important applications in science, technology,\nbio-medical, security and defense.\n", "  Helicity is the scalar product between velocity and vorticity and, just like\nenergy, its integral is an in-viscid invariant of the three-dimensional\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations. However, space-and time-discretization\nmethods typically corrupt this property, leading to violation of the inviscid\nconservation principles. This work investigates the discrete helicity\nconservation properties of spectral and finite-differencing methods, in\nrelation to the form employed for the convective term. Effects due to\nRunge-Kutta time-advancement schemes are also taken into consideration in the\nanalysis. The theoretical results are proved against inviscid numerical\nsimulations, while a scale-dependent analysis of energy, helicity and their\nnon-linear transfers is performed to further characterize the discretization\nerrors of the different forms in forced helical turbulence simulations.\n", "  First results on the experimental realisation of a 2x2 programmable phase\nplate for electrons are presented. The design consists of an array of\nelectrostatic einzel lenses that influence the phase of electron waves passing\nthrough 4 separately controllable aperture holes. This functionality is\ndemonstrated in a conventional transmission electron microscope operating at\n300~kV and results are in very close agreement with theoretical predictions.\nThe dynamic creation of a set of electron probes with different phase symmetry\nis demonstrated, thereby bringing adaptive optics in TEM one step closer to\nreality. The limitations of the current design and how to overcome these in the\nfuture are discussed. Simulations show how further evolved versions of the\ncurrent proof of concept might open new and exciting application prospects for\nbeam shaping and aberration correction.\n", "  Determining the relative brightness of the solar corona is one of the most\ncritical stages in solar eclipse studies. For this purpose, images taken with\ndifferent exposures and polarization angles in white-light observations are\nused. The composite image of each polarization angle is produced by combining\nthe images of different exposures. With the help of the intensity calibration\nfunction of these images, the relative intensity of the corona can be\ncalculated. The total brightness of the solar corona is calculated using Stokes\nparameters obtained from intensity values of three polarization angles. In this\nstudy, two methods are presented: the first is used to obtain the intensity\ncalibration function of the photographic material using calibration images, and\nthe second is used to calculate the combined intensity values of images taken\nwith different polarization angles.\n", "  A brief review about the Newman-Penrose formalism and the asymptotic\nstructure of the spacetime is given. The goal of this review is to describe the\nlatest developments in these topics and make a summary of the most important\narticles published by Newman and collaborators. Additionally, we discuss some\naspects of this approach, and we compute the spin coefficients and the Weyl\nscalars for a general stationary axisymmetric spacetimes in a tetrad basis\ndifferent from that defined by the principal null geodesic directions.\n", "  In this work, the dynamic of isolated systems in general relativity is\ndescribed when gravitational radiation and electromagnetic fields are present.\nIn this construction, the asymptotic fields received at null infinity together\nwith the regularized null cone cuts equation, and the center of mass of an\nasymptotically flat Einstein-Maxwell spacetime are used. A set of equations are\nderived in the low speed regime, linking their time evolution to the emitted\ngravitational radiation and to the Maxwell fields received at infinity. These\nequations should be useful when describing the dynamic of compact sources, such\nas the final moments of binary coalescence and the evolution of the final black\nhole. Additionally, we compare our equations with those coming from a similar\napproach given by Newman, finding some differences in the motion of the center\nof mass and spin of the gravitational system.\n", "  The investigation of the magnetic phase transitions in the parent compounds\nof Fe-based superconductors is regarded essential for an understanding of the\npairing mechanism in the related superconducting compounds. Even though the\nchemical and electronic properties of these materials are often strongly\ninhomogeneous on a nanometer length scale, studies of the magnetic phase\ntransitions using spatially resolved experimental techniques are still scarce.\nHere, we present a real space spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy\ninvestigation of the surface of Fe$_{1+y}$Te single crystals with different\nexcess Fe content, $y$, which are continuously driven through the magnetic\nphase transition. For Fe$_{1.08}$Te, the transition into the low-temperature\nmonoclinic commensurate antiferromagnetic phase is accompanied by the sudden\nemergence of ordering into four rotational domains with different orientations\nof the monoclinic lattice and of the antiferromagnetic order, showing how\nstructural and magnetic order are intertwined. In the low-temperature phase of\nFe$_{1.12}$Te one type of the domain boundaries disappears, and the transition\ninto the paramagnetic phase gets rather broad, which is assigned to the\nformation of a mixture of orthorhombic and monoclinic phases.\n", "  High-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations of the X-ray flux comming from\nblack-hole binaries have the potential to provide precise estimates of the mass\nand the spin of the central black hole, if an adequate model for them was\navailable. There are several models in the literature but none of them is\ncommonly accepted. One way to test the available models is to confront their\npredictions for the masses of black holes with results obtained through other\nmethods. Here, we study the mass bounds that nine of the most commonly used\nmodels provide for the three microquasars with known masses GRS 1915+105, GRO\n1655-40 and XTE 1550-564 which display high-frequency quasiperiodic\noscillations in their X-ray spectra. We also propose a statistical method for\nthe assessment of the average success of the models. The results allow us to\ndiscard five of them. Here, \"the mass problem\" designates the conflict between\ntheir predictions and the reference masses.\n", "  Sulphur-bearing species are often used to probe the evolution of hot cores\nsince their abundances are particularly sensitive to physical and chemical\nvariations. However, the chemistry of sulphur is not well understood in these\nregions, notably because observations of several hot cores displayed a large\nvariety of sulphur compositions, and because the reservoir of sulphur in dense\nclouds, in which hot cores form, is still poorly constrained. In order to help\ndisentangled its complexity, we present a fresh comprehensive review of sulphur\nchemistry in hot cores along with a study of its sensibility to temperature and\npre-collapse chemical composition. In parallel, we analyse the discrepencies\nthat result from the use of two different types of models (static and dynamic)\nto highlight the sensitivity to the choice of model to be used in astrochemical\nstudies. Our results show that the pre-collapse chemical composition is a\ncritical parameter for sulphur chemistry in hot cores and could explain the\ndifferent sulphur compositions observed. We also report that differences in\nabundances for a given species between the static and dynamic models can reach\nsix orders of magnitude in the hot core, which reveals the key role of the\nchoice of model in astrochemical studies.\n", "  In this paper, we study the formation process of a soap bubble by blowing\nsoap film. Both bubble diameter and formation position were investigated in\nexperiments. We found that the ratio between bubble size and soap film column\nis constant, and that the formation position increases linearly within a\ncritical length-range. We used the theory of Rayleigh-Plateau instability to\nexplain these findings. The theoretical explanations are consistent with the\nexperimental data.\n", "  We present a new parametrization of the cosmic-ray flux and its mass\ncomposition over an energy range from 10 GeV to $10^{11}$ GeV. Our approach is\ndata-driven and relies on theoretical assumptions as little as possible. We\ncombine measurements of the flux of individual elements from high-precision\nsatellites and balloon experiments with indirect measurements of mass groups\nfrom the leading air shower experiments. To our knowledge, we provide the first\nfit of this kind that consistently takes both statistical and systematic\nuncertainties into account. The uncertainty on the energy scales of individual\nexperiments is handled explicitly in our mathematical approach. Part of our\nresults is a common energy scale and adjustment factors for the energy scales\nof the participating experiments. Our fit has a reduced $\\chi^2$-value of 0.5,\nshowing that experimental data are in good agreement, if systematic\nuncertainties are considered. Our model may serve as a world-average of the\nmeasured fluxes for individual elements from proton to iron from 10 GeV to\n$10^{11}$ GeV. It is useful as an input for simulations or theoretical\ncomputations based on cosmic rays. The experimental uncertainties of the input\ndata are captured in a covariance matrix, which can be propagated into derived\nquantities.\n", "  Stratosphere circulation is important to interpret abundances of\nphoto-chemically produced compounds like ozone that we aim to observe to assess\nhabitability of exoplanets. We thus investigate a tidally locked ExoEarth\nscenario for TRAPPIST-1b, TRAPPIST-1d, Proxima Centauri~b and GJ 667 C~f with a\nsimplified 3D atmosphere model and for different stratospheric wind breaking\nassumptions.\n  These planets are representatives for different circulation regimes for\norbital periods: $P_{orb}=1-100$~days. The circulation of exoplanets with\n$P_{orb} \\leq $ 25~days can be dominated by the standing tropical Rossby wave\nin the troposphere and also in the stratosphere: It leads to a strong\nequatorial eastward wind jet and to 'Anti-Brewer-Dobson'-circulation that\nconfines air masses to the stratospheric equatorial region. Thus, the\ndistribution of photo-chemically produced species and aerosols may be limited\nto an 'equatorial transport belt'. In contrast, planets with $P_{orb}>25$~days,\nlike GJ~667~C~f, exhibit efficient thermally driven circulation in the\nstratosphere that allows for a day side-wide distribution of air masses.\n  The influence of the standing tropical Rossby waves on tidally locked\nExoEarths with $P_{orb} \\leq 25$~days can, however, be circumvented with deep\nstratospheric wind breaking alone - allowing for equator-to-pole transport like\non Earth. For planets with $3 \\leq P_{orb} \\leq 6$~days, the extratropical\nRossby wave acts as an additional safe-guard against the tropical Rossby wave\nin case of shallow wind breaking. Therefore, TRAPPIST-1d is less prone to have\nan equatorial transport belt in the stratosphere than Proxima~Centauri~b.\n  Even our Earth model shows an equatorial wind jet, if stratosphere wind\nbreaking is inefficient.\n", "  We review the component Lagrangian construction of the supersymmetric higher\nspin models in three dimensional (3D) Minkowski and anti de Sitter (AdS)\nspaces. The approach is based on the frame-like gauge invariant formulation,\nwhere massive higher spin fields are realized through a system of massless\nones. We develop a supersymmetric generalization of this formulation to the\nLagrangian construction of the on-shell N=1, 3D higher spin supermultiplets. In\n3D Minkowski space we show that the massive supermultiplets can be constructed\nfrom one extended massless supermultiplet by adding the mass terms to the\nLagrangian and the corresponding corrections to the supertransformations of the\nfermionic fields. In 3D AdS space we construct massive supermultiplets using a\nformulation of the massive fields in terms of the set of gauge invariant\nobjects (curvatures) in the process of their consistent supersymmetric\ndeformation.\n", "  The equivalence principle (EP), as well as Schiff's conjecture, are discussed\n(en passant), and the connection between the EP and quantum mechanics is then\nbriefly analyzed. Two semiclassical violations of the classical equivalence\nprinciple (CEP) but not of the weak one (WEP), i.e. Greenberger gravitational\nBohr atom and the tree-level scattering of different quantum particles by an\nexternal weak higher-order gravitational field, are thoroughly investigated\nafterwards. Next, two quantum examples of systems that agree with the WEP but\nnot with the CEP, namely COW experiment and free fall in a constant\ngravitational field of a massive object described by its wave-function $\\Psi$,\nare discussed in detail. Keeping in mind that among the four examples focused\non this work only COW experiment is based on an experimental test, some\nimportant details related to it, are presented as well.\n", "  A comparative analysis of two Raman line-shape functions has been carried out\nto validate the true representation of experimentally observed Raman scattering\ndata for semiconducting nanomaterials. A modified form of already existing\nphonon confinement model incorporates two basic considerations, phonon momentum\nconservation and shift in zone centre phonon frequency. After incorporation of\nthe above mentioned two factors, a rather symmetric Raman line-shape is\ngenerated which is in contrary to the usual asymmetric Raman line-shapes\nobtained from nanostructured semiconductor. By fitting an experimentally\nobserved Raman scattering data from silicon nanostructures, prepared by metal\ninduced etching, it can be established that the Raman line-shape obtained\nwithin the framework of phonon confinement model is a true representative Raman\nline-shape of sufficiently low dimensions semiconductors.\n", "  In the quantum version of prisoners' dilemma, each prisoner is equipped with\na single qubit that the interrogator can entangle. We enlarge the available\nHilbert space by introducing a third qubit that the interrogator can entangle\nwith the other two. We discuss an enhanced interrogation technique based on\ntripartite entanglement and analyze Nash equilibria. We show that for\ntripartite entanglement approaching a W-state, there exist Nash equilibria that\ncoincide with the Pareto optimal choice where both prisoners cooperate. Upon\ncontinuous variation between a W-state and a pure bipartite entangled state,\nthe game is shown to have a surprisingly rich structure. The role of bipartite\nand tripartite entanglement is explored to explain that structure.\n", "  The Hubble Catalog of Variables (HCV) project aims to identify the variable\nsources in the Hubble Source Catalog (HSC), which includes about 92 million\nobjects with over 300 million measurements detected by the WFPC2, ACS and WFC3\ncameras on board of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), by using an automated\npipeline containing a set of detection and validation algorithms. All the HSC\nsources with more than a predefined number of measurements in a single\nfilter/instrument combination are pre-processed to correct systematic effect\nand to remove the bad measurements. The corrected data are used to compute a\nnumber of variability indexes to determine the variability status of each\nsource. The final variable source catalog will contain variables stars, active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs), supernovae (SNs) or even new types of variables,\nreaching an unprecedented depth (V$\\leq$27 mag). At the end of the project, the\nfirst release of the HCV will be available at the Mikulski Archive for Space\nTelescopes (MAST) and the ESA Hubble Science Archives. The HCV pipeline will be\ndeployed at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) so that an updated\nHCV may be generated following future releases of HSC.\n", "  We provide a natural answer to Lewis Carroll's pillow problem of what is the\nprobability that a triangle is obtuse, Prob(Obtuse). This arises by\nstraightforward combination of a) Kendall's Theorem - that the space of all\ntriangles is a sphere - and b) the natural map sending triangles in space to\npoints in this shape sphere. The answer is 3/4. Our method moreover readily\ngeneralizes to a wider class of problems, since a) and b) both have many\napplications and admit large generalizations: Shape Theory. An elementary and\nthus widely accessible prototype for Shape Theory is thereby desirable, and\nextending Kendall's already-notable prototype a) by demonstrating that b)\nreadily solves Lewis Carroll's well-known pillow problem indeed provides a\nmemorable and considerably stronger prototype. This is a prototype of, namely,\nmapping flat geometry problems directly realized in a space to shape space,\nwhere differential-geometric tools are readily available to solve the problem\nand then finally re-interpret it in the original `shape-in-space' terms. We\nillustrate this program's versatility by posing and solving a number of\nvariants of the pillow problem. We first find Prob(Isosceles is Obtuse). We\nsubsequently define tall and flat triangles, as bounded by regular triangles\nwhose base-to-median ratio is that of the equilateral triangle. These\ndefinitions have Jacobian and Hopfian motivation as well as entering Kendall's\nown considerations of `splinters': almost-collinear triangles. We find that\nProb(Tall) = 1/2 = Prob(Flat) is immediately apparent from regularity's\nsymmetric realization in shape space. However, Prob(Obtuse and Flat),\nProb(Obtuse is Flat) and all other nontrivial expressions concerning having any\ntwo of the properties mentioned above, or having one of these conditioned on\nanother, constitute nontrivial variants of the pillow problem, and we solve\nthem all.\n", "  \"Brane supersymmetry breaking\" is a peculiar phenomenon that can occur in\nperturbative orientifold vacua. It results from the simultaneous presence, in\nthe vacuum, of non-mutually BPS sets of BPS branes and orientifolds, which\nleave behind a net tension and thus a runaway potential, but no tachyons. In\nthe simplest ten-dimensional realization, the low-lying modes combine the\nclosed sector of type-I supergravity with an open sector including USp(32)\ngauge bosons, fermions in the antisymmetric 495 and an additional singlet\nplaying the role of a goldstino. We review some properties of this system and\nof other non-tachyonic models in ten dimensions with broken supersymmetry, and\nwe illustrate some puzzles that their very existence raises, together with some\napplications that they have stimulated.\n", "  Coupled-channel effects are taken into account for the study of scalar form\nfactors in semi-leptonic $D\\to\\pi\\bar{\\ell}\\nu_\\ell$ and $D\\to\n\\bar{K}\\bar{\\ell}\\nu_\\ell$ decays, by solving the Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es\nintegral equations. As inputs, we employ the unitarized amplitudes taken from\nchiral effective theory for the region not far away from thresholds, while, at\nhigher energies of the Goldstone bosons, proper asymptotic conditions are\nemployed. Within Muskhelishvili-Omn\\`es formalism, the scalar form factors are\nrepresented in terms of Omn\\`es matrix multiplied by a vector of polynomials.\nWe reduce the number of subtraction constants by matching to the scalar form\nfactors derived in chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order. The\nrecent lattice QCD data by ETM collaboration for ${D\\to\\pi}$ and\n${D\\to\\bar{K}}$ scalar form factors are simultaneously well described. The\nscalar form factors for $D\\to\\eta$, $D_s\\to \\bar{K}$ and $D_s\\to \\eta$\ntransitions are predicted in their whole kinematical regions. Using our fitting\nparameters, we also extract the following Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa elements:\n$|V_{cd}|=0.243(_{-12}^{+11})_{\\rm sta.}({3})_{\\rm sys.}(3)_{\\rm exp.}$ and\n$|V_{cs}|=0.950(_{-40}^{+39})_{\\rm sta.}(1)_{\\rm sys.}(7)_{\\rm exp.}$. The\napproach used in this work can be straightforwardly extended to the\nsemileptonic $B$ decays.\n", "  Supernovae Type-Ia (SNeIa) play a significant role in exploring the history\nof the expansion of the Universe, since they are the best-known standard\ncandles with which we can accurately measure the distance to the objects.\nFinding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics\nhave become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods\nrelied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova\ncandidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of\ntemporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch\nobservations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a\nnovel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images\nwithout any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the\nstate-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric\napproach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating\nthe luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another\nneural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and\nobservation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural\nnetworks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa\ndirectly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness\nof the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to\nexisting photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.\n", "  We consider the propagation of totally symmetric bosonic fields on generic\nbackground spacetimes. The mutual compatibility of the dynamical equations and\nconstraints severely constrains the set of geometries where consistent\npropagation is possible. To enlarge this set in this article we allow several\nbackground fields to be turned on. We were able to show that massive fields of\nspin s greater than or equal to three may consistently propagate in a large set\nof non-trivial spacetimes, such as asymptotically de-Sitter, flat and\nanti-de-Sitter black holes geometries, as long as certain conditions between\nthe various background fields are met. For the special case of massive spin-2\nfields the set of allowed spacetimes is larger and includes domain-wall-type\ngeometries, such as the Freedman-Robertson-Walker metric. We comment on the\nassumptions underlying our study and on possible applications of our results.\n", "  We consider Boltzmann-Gibbs measures associated with log-correlated Gaussian\nfields as potentials and study their multifractal properties which exhibit\nphase transitions. In particular, the pre-freezing and freezing phenomena of\nthe annealed exponent, predicted by Fyodorov using a modified\nreplica-symmetry-breaking ansatz, are generalised to arbitrary dimension and\nverified using results from Gaussian multiplicative chaos theory.\n", "  We discuss a non-perturbative $T$-matrix approach to investigate the\nmicroscopic structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Utilizing an effective\nHamiltonian which includes both light- and heavy-parton degrees of freedoms.\nThe basic two-body interaction includes color-Coulomb and confining\ncontributions in all available color channels, and is constrained by\nlattice-QCD data for the heavy-quark free energy. The in-medium $T$-matrices\nand parton spectral functions are computed selfconsistently with full account\nof off-shell properties encoded in large scattering widths. We apply the\n$T$-matrices to calculate the equation of state (EoS) for the QGP, including a\nladder resummation of the Luttinger-Ward functional using a matrix-log\ntechnique to account for the dynamical formation of bound states. It turns out\nthat the latter become the dominant degrees of freedom in the EoS at low QGP\ntemperatures indicating a transition from parton to hadron degrees of freedom.\nThe calculated spectral properties of one- and two-body states confirm this\npicture, where large parton scattering rates dissolve the parton quasiparticle\nstructures while broad resonances start to form as the pseudocritical\ntemperature is approached from above. Further calculations of transport\ncoefficients reveal a small viscosity and heavy-quark diffusion coefficient.\n", "  The purpose of this study is to provide data for the primitive model of the\nelectrical double layer, where ions are modeled as charged hard spheres, the\nsolvent as an implicit dielectric background (with dielectric constant\n$\\epsilon= 78.5$), and the electrode as a smooth, uniformly charged, hard wall.\nWe use canonical and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations to compute the\nconcentration profiles, from which the electric field and electrostatic\npotential profiles are obtained by solving Poisson's equation. We report data\nfor an extended range of parameters including 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 electrolytes at\nconcentrations $c=0.0001-1$ M near electrodes carrying surface charges up to\n$\\sigma=\\pm 0.5$ Cm$^{-2}$. The anions are monovalent with a fixed diameter\n$d_{-}=3$ {\\AA}, while the charge and diameter of cations are varied in the\nrange $z_{+}=1$, 2, 3 and $d_{+}=1.5$, 3, 6, and 9 {\\AA} (the temperature is\n$298.15$ K). We provide all the raw data in the Supporting Information.\n", "  We study possible many body phenomena in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system of\nweakly interacting spinor bosons in a square lattice. There are various novel\nspin-bond correlated superfluids (SF) and quantum or topological phase\ntransitions among these SF phases. One transition is a first order one driven\nby roton droppings ( but with non-zero gaps $ \\Delta_R $ ) tuned by the Zeeman\nfield $ h $. Another is a second order bosonic Lifshitz transition with the\ndynamic exponents $ z_x=z_y=2 $ and an accompanying $ [C_4 \\times C_4]_D $\nsymmetry breaking. It is driven by the softening of the superfluid Goldstone\nmode tuned by the ratio of spin-orbit coupled (SOC) strength over the hopping\nstrength. The two phase boundaries meet at a topological tri-critical (TT)\npoint which separates the $ h=0 $ line into two SF phases with $ N=2 $ and $\nN=4 $ condensation momenta respectively. At the $ h=0 $ line where the system\nhas an anti-unitary $ Z_2 $ Reflection symmetry, there are infinite number of\nclassically degenerate family of states on both sides. We perform a systematic\norder from quantum disorder analysis to find the quantum ground states, also\ncalculate the roton gaps $ \\Delta_R $ generated by the order from disorder\nmechanism on both sides of the TT point. The $ N=2 $ and $ N=4 $ SF phases have\nthe same spin-orbital XY-AFM spin structure, respect the anti-unitary symmetry\nand break the $ [C_4 \\times C_4]_D $ symmetry, so they be distinguished only by\nthe different topology of the BEC condensation momenta instead of by any\ndifferences in the symmetry breaking patterns. All these novel quantum or\ntopological phenomena can be probed in the recent experimentally realized\nweakly interacting Quantum Anomalous Hall (QAH) model of $ ^87 Rb $ by Wu, {\\sl\net.al}, Science 354, 83-88 (2016).\n", "  This paper examines the cosmic ray He and C nuclei spectra below ~1 GeV/nuc,\nas well as the very rapid increase in the He/C ratio below ~100 MeV/nuc,\nmeasured by Voyager 1 beyond the heliopause. Using a simple Leaky Box Model\n(LBM) for galactic propagation we have not been able to simultaneously\nreproduce the individual He and C nuclei spectra and the large increase in He/C\nratio that is observed at low energies. However, using a truncated LBM with\ndifferent truncation parameters for each nucleus that are related to their rate\nof energy loss by ionization which is ~Z2/A, these different features can be\nmatched. This suggests that we are observing the effects of the source\ndistribution of cosmic rays in the galaxy on the low energy spectra of cosmic\nray nuclei and that there may be a paucity of nearby sources. In this\npropagation model we start very specific source spectra for He and C which are\n~dj/dP = P-2.24, the same for each nucleus and also for all rigidities. These\nsource spectra become spectra with spectral indices ~-2.69 at high rigidities\nfor both charges as a result of a rigidity dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient governing the propagation which is taken to be ~P-0.45. This\nexponent is determined directly from the B/C ratio measured by AMS-2. These\npropagated P-2.69 spectra, when extended to high energies, predict He and C\nintensities and a He/C ratio that are within +3-5% of the intensities and ratio\nrecently measured by AMS-2 in the energy range from 10 to 1000 GeV/nuc.\n"]}
