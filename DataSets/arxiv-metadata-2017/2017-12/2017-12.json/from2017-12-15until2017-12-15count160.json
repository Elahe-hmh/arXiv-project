This gives us the necessary tools to handle the SO(2,3) Yang-Mills\ngauge theory for gravity. New here is the derivation of the conservation laws.\nFinally possible solutions of the field equations are discussed. They depend on\nthe scale of the de Sitter length. Solutions to the anti-de Sitter field\nequations are given in the case of a Schwarzschild and FRW-geometry.\n", "  The authors demonstrated that L21-ordered full-Heusler Co2FeSi (CFS) alloy\nfilm with thickness of 100 nm were formed by facing targets sputtering (FTS)\nmethod at a substrate temperature TS = 300 deg C. Degrees of L21- and B2- order\nfor the film were 0.37, and 0.96, respectively. Furthermore, full-Heusler CFS\nalloy thin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by\nMgO-interface magnetic anisotropy were successfully formed by the FTS method.\nThe CFS/MgO stacking layers showed PMA when dCFS was 0.6 nm <= dCFS <= 1.0 nm.\nThe PMA in these structures resulted from the CFS/MgO interfacial perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy.\n", "  I model the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) randomly heated and shocked\nby supernovae, with gravity, differential rotation and other parameters we\nunderstand to be typical of the solar neighbourhood. The simulations are 3D\nextending horizontally 1 x 1 kpc squared and vertically 2 kpc, symmetric about\nthe galactic mid-plane. They routinely span gas number densities 1/10000 to 100\nper cubic cm, temperatures 100 to 100 MK, speeds up to 10000 km/s and Mach\nnumber up to 25. Radiative cooling is applied from two widely adopted\nparameterizations, and compared directly to assess the sensitivity of the\nresults to cooling. There is strong evidence to describe the ISM as comprising\nwell defined cold, warm and hot regions, which are statistically close to\nthermal and total pressure equilibrium. This result is not sensitive to the\nchoice of parameters considered here. The distribution of the gas density\nwithin each can be robustly modelled as lognormal. Appropriate distinction is\nrequired between the properties of the gases in the supernova active mid-plane\nand the more homogeneous phases outside this region. The connection between the\nfractional volume of a phase and its various proxies is clarified. An exact\nrelation is then derived between the fractional volume and the filling factors\ndefined in terms of the volume and probabilistic averages. These results are\ndiscussed in both observational and computational contexts. The correlation\nscale of the random flows is calculated from the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction; it is of order 100 pc and tends to grow with distance from the\nmid-plane. The origin and structure of the magnetic fields in the ISM is also\ninvestigated in non-ideal MHD simulations. A seed magnetic field, with volume\naverage of roughly 4 nG, grows exponentially to reach a statistically steady\nstate within 1.6 Gyr.\n", "  As a result of the deep modifications of the French physics and chemistry\ncurricula in upper secondary school during these last three years, the physics\ndepartment of the Universit\\'e Paris Diderot (France) wished to develop a\nrenovation project concerning its methods of teachings. As science education\nresearchers we took part in this project questioning 104 university academics\nof this department through 23 exploratory interviews and 81 questionnaires.\nThey have been asked about the possible and desirable changes concerning\npedagogical methods and organization (with respect to current difficulties met\nby the students). This study has enabled us to pinpoint elements of their\nprofessional identity as teachers. This identity has been explored according to\nvarious directions: rules which govern their profession, qualities and skills\nfor the practice, values of the profession, as well as a didactic dimension,\ndealing specifically with physics' teaching. The analysis of the collected data\nallows us to identify major trends among university academics' conceptions\nabout teaching, such as: a good teacher is above all a good physicist, or,\nteaching has to favor interactions with students. It also allows us to bring to\nlight tensions between what university academics would like to do in their\nteaching and what they declare to do in practice or think feasible\n", "  Topological constraints play a key role in the self-organizing processes that\ncreate structures in macro systems. In fact, if all possible degrees of freedom\nare actualized on equal footing without constraint, the state of\n\"equipartition\" may bear no specific structure. Fluid turbulence is a typical\nexample - while turbulent mixing seems to increase entropy, a variety of\nsustained vortical structures can emerge. In Hamiltonian formalism, some\ntopological constraints are represented by Casimir invariants (for example,\nhelicities of a fluid or a plasma), and then, the effective phase space is\nreduced to the Casimir leaves. However, a general constraint is not necessarily\nintegrable, which precludes the existence of an appropriate Casimir invariant;\nthe circulation is an example of such an invariant. In this work, we formulate\na systematic method to embed a Hamiltonian system in an extended phase space;\nwe introduce phantom fields and extend the Poisson algebra. A phantom field\ndefines a new Casimir invariant, a cross helicity, which represents a\ntopological constraint that is not integrable in the original phase space.\nChanging the perspective, a singularity of the extended system may be viewed as\na subsystem on which the phantom fields (though they are actual fields, when\nviewed from the extended system) vanish, i.e., the original system. This\nhierarchical relation of degenerate Poisson manifolds enables us to see the\n\"interior\" of a singularity as a sub Poisson manifold. The theory can be\napplied to describe bifurcations and instabilities in a wide class of general\nHamiltonian systems [Yoshida & Morrison, Fluid Dyn. Res. 46 (2014), 031412].\n", "  The main result of this paper is a rigorous computation of Wilson loop\nexpectations in strongly coupled $SO(N)$ lattice gauge theory in the large $N$\nlimit, in any dimension. The formula appears as an absolutely convergent sum\nover trajectories in a kind of string theory on the lattice, demonstrating an\nexplicit gauge-string duality. The generality of the proof technique may allow\nit to be extended other gauge groups.\n", "  The destruction of a chaotic attractor leading to rough changes in the\ndynamics of a dynamical system is studied. Local bifurcations are characterised\nby a single or a pair of characteristic exponents crossing the imaginary axis.\nThe approach of such bifurcations in the presence of noise can be inferred from\nthe slowing down of the correlation decay. On the other hand, little is known\nabout global bifurcations involving high-dimensional attractors with positive\nLyapunov exponents.\n  The global stability of chaotic attractors may be characterised by the\nspectral properties of the Koopman or the transfer operators governing the\nevolution of statistical ensembles. It has recently been shown that a boundary\ncrisis in the Lorenz flow coincides with the approach to the unit circle of the\neigenvalues of these operators associated with motions about the attractor, the\nstable resonances. A second type of resonances, the unstable resonances, is\nresponsible for the decay of correlations and mixing on the attractor. In the\ndeterministic case, those cannot be expected to be affected by general boundary\ncrises.\n  Here, however, we give an example of chaotic system in which slowing down of\nthe decay of correlations of some observables does occur at the approach of a\nboundary crisis. The system considered is a high-dimensional, chaotic climate\nmodel of physical relevance. Moreover, coarse-grained approximations of the\ntransfer operators on a reduced space, constructed from a long time series of\nthe system, give evidence that this behaviour is due to the approach of\nunstable resonances to the unit circle. That the unstable resonances are\naffected by the crisis can be physically understood from the fact that the\nprocess responsible for the instability, the ice-albedo feedback, is also\nactive on the attractor. Implications regarding response theory and the design\nof early-warning signals are discussed.\n", "  We study the effect of charged excitations in the AdS spacetime on the first\nlaw of entanglement thermodynamics. It is found that `boosted' AdS black holes\ngive rise to a more general form of first law which includes chemical potential\nand charge density. To obtain this result we have to resort to a second order\nperturbative calculation of entanglement entropy for small size subsystems. At\nfirst order the form of entanglement law remains unchanged even in the presence\nof charged excitations. But the thermodynamic quantities have to be\nappropriately `renormalized' at the second order due to the corrections. We\nwork in the perturbative regime where $T_{thermal}\\ll T_E$.\n", "  The possibility of extending the quantum mechanical superposition principle\nto free parameters such as the cosmological constant appearing in the\nLagrangian of physical theories is examined. If the cosmological constant is\nsubject to a quantum mechanical superposition principle, its observed value is\na weighted average of its two natural values, one at the Planck scale and the\nother at zero. As zero and nonzero values of the cosmological constant leads to\ntopologically distinct spacetimes, the amplitude for the cosmological constant\nto take a Planck scale value is weighted over a topological Euclidean action\nand the expectation value of the cosmological constant is found to be of the\norder of its present observed value.\n", "  Although there is a broad consensus on the fact that critical behavior in\nstacked triangular Heisenberg antiferromagnets --an example of frustrated\nmagnets with competing interactions-- is described by a Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson\nHamiltonian with O(3)$\\times$O(2) symmetry, the nature of the phase transition\nin three dimensions is still debated. We show that spin-one Bose gases provide\nus with a simulator of the O(3)$\\times$O(2) model. Using a\nrenormalization-group approach, we argue that the transition is weakly first\norder and shows pseudoscaling behavior, and give estimates of the\npseudocritical exponent $\\nu$ in $^{87}$Rb, $^{41}$K and $^7$Li atom gases\nwhich can be tested experimentally.\n", "  For extremal black holes, one can construct simpler, limiting spacetimes that\ndescribe the geometry near degenerate horizons. Since these spacetimes are\nknown to have enhanced symmetry, the limiting objects coincide for different\nsolutions. We show that this occurs for strongly magnetised Kerr-Newman\nsolution, and how this is related to physical Meissner effect of expulsion of\nmagnetic fields from extremal black holes.\n", "  We report an experimental investigation of spreading then shrinking of a\nsurfactant droplet at the air-water interface with fingering instability\nappearing at the edge of the droplet stain. We find out that a droplet of a\nsurfactant on the water shows three regimes of spreading, shrinking and resting\nat the appropriate parameters values. These regimes can be distinguished by\nmeasuring the mean square displacement of the droplet parts, fractal dimension\nof stain, or radius of fingerless part of the stain (to measure it, we define\nthe angular box-counting dimension), versus time. The shrinking regime is a\nnovel phenomenon.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-sandwiched R\\'enyi divergence satisfies the data processing\ninequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum operations, for $\\alpha\\geq 1/2$.\nIn this article, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for\nequality in the data processing inequality for the $\\alpha$-sandwiched R\\'enyi\ndivergence for all $\\alpha\\geq 1/2$. For the range $\\alpha\\in [1/2,1)$, our\nresult provides the only condition for equality obtained thus far. To prove our\nresult, we first consider the special case of partial trace, and derive a\ncondition for equality based on the original proof of the data processing\ninequality by Frank and Lieb [J. Math. Phys. 54.12 (2013), p. 122201] using a\nstrict convexity/concavity argument. We then generalize to arbitrary quantum\noperations via the Stinespring Representation Theorem. As applications of our\ncondition for equality in the data processing inequality, we deduce conditions\nfor equality in various entropic inequalities. We formulate a R\\'enyi version\nof the Araki-Lieb inequality and analyze the case of equality, generalizing a\nresult by Carlen and Lieb [Lett. Math. Phys. 101.1 (2012), pp. 1-11] about\nequality in the original Araki-Lieb inequality. Furthermore, we prove a general\nlower bound on a R\\'enyi version of the entanglement of formation, and observe\nthat it is attained by states saturating the R\\'enyi version of the Araki-Lieb\ninequality. Finally, we prove that the known upper bound on the entanglement\nfidelity in terms of the usual fidelity is saturated only by pure states.\n", "  The conservation of the enstrophy ($L^2$ norm of the vorticity $\\omega$)\nplays an essential role in the physics and mathematics of two-dimensional (2D)\nEuler fluids. Generalizing to compressible ideal (inviscid and barotropic)\nfluids, the generalized enstrophy $\\int_{\\Sigma(t)} f(\\omega/\\rho)\\rho\\, d^2\nx$, ($f$ an arbitrary smooth function, $\\rho$ the density, and $\\Sigma(t)$ an\narbitrary 2D domain co-moving with the fluid) is a constant of motion, and\nplays the same role. On the other hand, for the three-dimensional (3D) ideal\nfluid, the helicity $\\int_{M} {V}\\cdot\\omega\\,d^3x$, ($V$ the flow velocity,\n$\\omega=\\nabla\\times V$, and ${M}$ the three-dimensional domain containing the\nfluid) is conserved. Evidently, the helicity degenerates in a 2D system, and\nthe (generalized) enstrophy emerges as a compensating constant. This transition\nof the constants of motion is a reflection of an essential difference between\n2D and 3D systems, because the conservation of the (generalized) enstrophy\nimposes stronger constraints, than the helicity, on the flow. In this paper, we\nmake a deeper inquiry into the helicity-enstrophy interplay: the ideal fluid\nmechanics is cast into a Hamiltonian form in the phase space of Clebsch\nparameters, generalizing 2D to a wider category of epi-2D flows (2D embedded in\n3D has zero helicity, while the converse is not true -- our epi-2D category\nencompasses a wider class of zero-helicity flows); how helicity degenerates and\nis substituted by a new constant is delineated; and how a further generalized\nenstrophy is introduced as a constant of motion applying to epi-2D flow is\ndescribed.\n", "  We show how to realize quantum state transfer between distant qubits using\nthe chiral edge states of a two-dimensional topological spin system. Our\nimplementation based on Rydberg atoms allows to realize the quantum state\ntransfer protocol in state of the art experimental setups. In particular, we\nshow how to adapt the standard state transfer protocol to make it robust\nagainst dispersive and disorder effects.\n", "  Recent DNS results [Gerolymos G.A., Vallet I. : J. Fluid Mech. 807 (2016)\n386--418] have provided data for the terms in the transport equations for the\ncomponents of the dissipation tensor $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ in low-Reynolds\nturbulent plane channel flow. The present paper extends the previous results by\na detailed analysis of the behaviour of various mechanisms in the\n$\\varepsilon_{ij}$-transport equations (production, diffusion, redistribution,\ndestruction), with particular emphasis on the component-by-component comparison\nwith the corresponding mechanisms in the transport equations for the\nReynolds-stresses $r_{ij}$. The splitting of the pressure terms for the\nwall-normal components into redistribution and pressure-diffusion reveals\nsubstantially different behaviour near the wall. The wall-asymptotics of\ndifferent terms in the transport equations are studied in detail, and examined\nusing the DNS data. Both DNS data and wall-asympotic analysis show that the\nanisotropy of the destruction-of-dissipation tensor\n$\\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_{ij}}$ is fundamentally different from that of\n$r_{ij}$ or $\\varepsilon_{ij}$, never approaching the 2-component (2-C) state\nat the solid wall.\n", "  The rattleback is a boat-shaped top with an asymmetric preference in spin.\nIts dynamics can be described by nonlinearly coupled pitching, rolling, and\nspinning modes. The chirality, designed into the body as a skewed mass\ndistribution, manifests itself in the quicker transition of $+$spin\n$\\rightarrow$ pitch $\\rightarrow$ $-$spin than that of $-$spin $\\rightarrow$\nroll $\\rightarrow$ $+$spin. The curious guiding idea of this work is that we\ncan formulate the dynamics as if a symmetric body were moving in a chiral\nspace. By elucidating the duality of matter and space in the Hamiltonian\nformalism, we attribute asymmetry to space. The rattleback is shown to live in\nthe space dictated by the Bianchi type ${\\rm VI}_{h < -1}$ (belonging to class\nB) algebra; this particular algebra is used here for the first time in a\nmechanical example. The class B algebra has a singularity that separates the\nspace (Poisson manifold) into mirror-asymmetric subspaces, breaking the\ntime-reversal symmetry of nearby orbits.\n", "  In this Article, we review a novel, rapidly developing field of modern light\nscience named all-dielectric nanophotonics. This branch of nanophotonics is\nbased on the properties of high-index dielectric nanoparticles which allow for\ncontrolling both magnetic and electric responses of a nanostructured matter.\nHere, we discuss optical properties of high-index dielectric nanoparticles,\nmethods of their fabrication, and recent advances in practical applications,\nincluding the quantum source emission engineering, Fano resonances in\nall-dielectric nanoclusters, surface enhanced spectroscopy and sensing,\ncoupled-resonator optical waveguides, metamaterials and metasurfaces, and\nnonlinear nanophotonics.\n", "  The skin effect is analyzed to provide the numerous measurements of the\npenetration depth of the electromagnetic field in superconducting materials\nwith a theoretical basis. Both the normal and anomalous skin effects are\naccounted for within a single framework. The emphasis is laid on the conditions\nrequired for the penetration depth to be equal to London's length, which\nenables us to validate an assumption widely used in the interpretation of all\ncurrent experimental results.\n", "  A frustration-free local Hamiltonian has the property that its ground state\nminimises the energy of all local terms simultaneously. In general, even\ndeciding whether a Hamiltonian is frustration-free is a hard task, as it is\nclosely related to the QMA1-complete quantum satisfiability problem (QSAT) --\nthe quantum analogue of SAT, which is the archetypal NP-complete problem in\nclassical computer science. This connection shows that the frustration-free\nproperty is not only relevant to physics but also to computer science. The\nQuantum Lov\\'asz Local Lemma (QLLL) provides a sufficient condition for\nfrustration-freeness. A natural question is whether there is an efficient way\nto prepare a frustration-free state under the conditions of the QLLL. Previous\nresults showed that the answer is positive if all local terms commute. In this\nwork we improve on the previous constructive results by designing an algorithm\nthat works efficiently for non-commuting terms as well, assuming that the\nsystem is \"uniformly\" gapped, by which we mean that the system and all its\nsubsystems have an inverse polynomial energy gap. Also, our analysis works\nunder the most general condition for the QLLL, known as Shearer's bound.\nSimilarly to the previous results, our algorithm has the charming feature that\nit uses only local measurement operations corresponding to the local\nHamiltonian terms.\n", "  We study an analog quantum simulator coupled to a reservoir with a known\nspectral density. The reservoir perturbs the quantum simulation by causing\ndecoherence. The simulator is used to measure an operator average, which cannot\nbe calculated using any classical means. Since we cannot predict the result, it\nis difficult to estimate the effect of the environment. Especially, it is\ndifficult to resolve whether the perturbation is small or if the actual result\nof the simulation is in fact very different from the ideal system we intend to\nstudy. Here, we show that in specific systems a measurement of additional\ncorrelators can be used to verify the reliability of the quantum simulation.\nThe procedure only requires additional measurements on the quantum simulator\nitself. We demonstrate the method theoretically in the case of a single spin\nconnected to a bosonic environment.\n", "  A null fluid with radial pressure is proposed as the source generating Vaidya\nspacetime. The fluid is anisotropic with no transversal pressures and $p =\n\\rho/3$ as its equation of state, where $p$ is the isotropic pressure and\n$\\rho$ is the energy density. The radial energy flux is inward directed when\n$\\dot{m} > 0$ and the total energy flow crossing a surface of constant $r$\nresembles the Brown-York quasilocal energy. A modified Vaidya metric removes\nthe singularity at the origin and the corresponding QLE is investigated in\nterms of both $r$ and the mass $m(v)$ of the object.\n", "  Developing students' ability to troubleshoot is an important learning outcome\nfor many undergraduate physics lab courses, especially electronics courses. In\nother work, metacognition has been identified as an important feature of\ntroubleshooting. However, that work has focused primarily on individual\nstudents' metacognitive processes or troubleshooting abilities. In contrast,\nelectronics courses often require students to work in pairs, and hence\nstudents' in-class experiences likely have significant social dimensions that\nare not well understood. In this work, we use an existing framework for\nsocially mediated metacognition to analyze audiovisual data from think-aloud\nactivities in which eight pairs of students from two institutions attempted to\ndiagnose and repair a malfunctioning electric circuit. In doing so, we provide\ninsight into some of the social metacognitive dynamics that arise during\ncollaborative troubleshooting. We find that students engaged in socially\nmediated metacognition at multiple key transitions during the troubleshooting\nprocess. Reciprocated metacognitive dialogue arose when students were\ncollectively strategizing about which measurements to perform, or reaching a\nshared understanding of the circuit's behavior. In addition to elaborating upon\nthese findings, we discuss implications for instruction, and we identify areas\nfor potential future investigation.\n", "  Coherent effects manifested in light scattering from cold, optically dense\nand disordered atomic systems are reviewed from a primarily theoretical point\nof view. Development of the basic theoretical tools is then elaborated through\nseveral physical atomic physics based processes which have been at least partly\nexplored experimentally. These include illustrations drawn from the coherent\nbackscattering effect, random lasing in atomic gases, quantum memories and\nlight-atoms interface assisted by the light trapping mechanism. Current\nunderstanding and challenges associated with the transition to high atomic\ndensities and cooperativity in the scattering process is also discussed in some\ndetail.\n", "  Since the 1940's there has been an interest in the question why social\nnetworks often give rise to two antagonistic factions. Recently a dynamical\nmodel of how and why such a balance might occur was developed. This note\nprovides an introduction to the notion of social balance and a new (and\nsimplified) analysis of that model. This new analysis allows us to choose\ngeneral initial conditions, as opposed to the symmetric ones previously\nconsidered. We show that for general initial conditions, four factions will\nevolve instead of two. We characterize the four factions, and we give an idea\nof their relative sizes.\n", "  Aiming for the simulation of colloidal droplets in microfluidic devices, we\npresent here a numerical method for two-fluid systems subject to surface\ntension and depletion forces among the suspended droplets. The algorithm is\nbased on an efficient solver for the incompressible two-phase Navier-Stokes\nequations, and uses a mass-conserving level set method to capture the fluid\ninterface. The four novel ingredients proposed here are, firstly, an\ninterface-correction level set (ICLS) method; global mass conservation is\nachieved by performing an additional advection near the interface, with a\ncorrection velocity obtained by locally solving an algebraic equation, which is\neasy to implement in both 2D and 3D. Secondly, we report a second-order\naccurate geometric estimation of the curvature at the interface and, thirdly,\nthe combination of the ghost fluid method with the fast pressure-correction\napproach enabling an accurate and fast computation even for large density\ncontrasts. Finally, we derive a hydrodynamic model for the interaction forces\ninduced by depletion of surfactant micelles and combine it with a multiple\nlevel set approach to study short-range interactions among droplets in the\npresence of attracting forces.\n", "  One way to foster a supportive culture in physics departments is for\ninstructors to provide students with personal attention regarding their\nacademic difficulties. To this end, we have developed the Guided Reflection\nForm (GRF), an online tool that facilitates student reflections and\npersonalized instructor responses. In the present work, we report on the\nexperiences and practices of two instructors who used the GRF in an\nintroductory physics lab course. Our analysis draws on two sources of data: (i)\npost-semester interviews with both instructors and (ii) the instructors'\nwritten responses to 134 student reflections. Interviews focused on the\ninstructors' perceptions about the goals and framing of the GRF activity, and\ncharacteristics of good or bad feedback. Their GRF responses were analyzed for\nthe presence of up to six types of statement: encouraging statements,\nnormalizing statements, empathizing statements, strategy suggestions, resource\nsuggestions, and feedback to the student on the structure of their reflection.\nWe find that both instructors used all six response types, in alignment with\ntheir perceptions of what counts as good feedback. This exploratory qualitative\ninvestigation demonstrates that the GRF can serve as a mechanism for\ninstructors to pay personal attention to their students. In addition, it opens\nthe door to future work about the impact of the GRF on student-teacher\ninteractions.\n", "  We study a spinor (two-component) Bose gas confined in a one-dimensional\ndouble-valley optical lattice which has a double-well structure in momentum\nspace. Based on field theory analysis, it is found that spinor bosons in the\ndouble-valley band may form a spin-charge mixed chiral spin quasicondensate\nunder certain conditions. Our numerical calculations in a concrete $\\pi$-flux\ntriangular ladder system confirm the robustness of the chiral spin order\nagainst interactions and quantum fluctuations. This exotic atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensate exhibits spatially staggered spin loop currents without any charge\ndynamics despite the complete absence of spin-orbit coupling in the system,\ncreating an interesting approach to atom spintronics. The entanglement entropy\nscaling allows us to extract conformal-field-theory central charge and\nestablish the low-energy effective field theory for the chiral spin condensate\nas a two-component Luttinger liquid. Our predictions should be detectable in\natomic experiments through spin-resolved time-of-flight techniques.\n", "  First-principles-based materials screening is systematically performed to\ndiscover new combinations of chemical elements possibly making shape-memory\nalloys (SMAs). The B2, D03, and L21 crystal structures are considered as the\nparent phases, and the 2H and 6M structures are considered as the martensitic\nphases. 3,384 binary and 3,243 ternary alloys (6,627 in total) with\nstoichiometric composition ratios are investigated by the materials screening\nin terms of energetic and dynamical stabilities of the martensitic phases as\nwell as structural compatibility between the parent and the martensitic phases.\n187 alloys are found to survive after the screening. Some of the surviving\nalloys are constituted by the chemical elements already widely used in SMAs,\nbut other various metallic elements are also found in the surviving alloys. The\nenergetic stability of the surviving alloys is further analyzed by comparison\nwith the data in Materials Project Database (MPD) to examine the alloys which\nmay occur phase separation or transition.\n", "  Broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) are a subclass of rare core\ncollapse SNe whose energy source is debated in the literature. Recently a\nseries of investigations on SNe Ic-BL with the magnetar (plus 56Ni) model were\ncarried out. Evidence for magnetar formation was found for the well-observed\nSNe Ic-BL 1998bw and 2002ap. In this paper we systematically study a large\nsample of SNe Ic-BL not associated with gamma-ray bursts. We use photospheric\nvelocity data determined in a homogeneous way. We find that the magnetar+56Ni\nmodel provides a good description of the light curves and velocity evolution of\nour sample of SNe Ic-BL, although some SNe (not all) can also be described by\nthe pure-magnetar model or by the two-component pure-56Ni model (3 out of 12\nare unlikely explained by two-component model). In the magnetar+56Ni model, the\namount of 56Ni required to explain their luminosity is significantly reduced,\nand the derived initial explosion energy is, in general, in accordance with\nneutrino heating. Some correlations between different physical parameters are\nevaluated and their implications regarding magnetic field amplification and the\ntotal energy reservoir are discussed.\n", "  Encoding quantum information in the photon temporal mode (TM) offers a robust\nplatform for high-dimensional quantum protocols. The main practical challenge,\nhowever, is to design a device that operates on single photons in specific TMs\nand all coherent superpositions. The quantum pulse gate (QPG) is a\nmode-selective sum-frequency generation designed for this task. Here, we\nperform a full modal characterisation of a QPG using weak coherent states in\nwell-defined TMs. We reconstruct a full set of measurement operators, which\nshow an average fidelity of 0.85 to a theoretically ideal device when operating\non a 7-dimensional space. Then we use these characterised measurement operators\nof the QPG to calibrate the device. Using the calibrated device and a\ntomographically complete set of measurements, we show that the QPG can perform\nhigh-dimensional TM state tomography with 0.99 fidelity.\n", "  We define a family of quantum invariants of closed oriented $3$-manifolds\nusing spherical multi-fusion categories. The state sum nature of this invariant\nleads directly to $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories\n($\\text{TQFT}$s), which generalize the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury\n($\\text{TVBW}$) $\\text{TQFT}$s from spherical fusion categories. The invariant\nis given as a state sum over labeled triangulations, which is mostly parallel\nto, but richer than the $\\text{TVBW}$ approach in that here the labels live not\nonly on $1$-simplices but also on $0$-simplices. It is shown that a\nmulti-fusion category in general cannot be a spherical fusion category in the\nusual sense. Thus we introduce the concept of a spherical multi-fusion category\nby imposing a weakened version of sphericity. Besides containing the\n$\\text{TVBW}$ theory, our construction also includes the recent higher gauge\ntheory $(2+1)$-$\\text{TQFT}$s given by Kapustin and Thorngren, which was not\nknown to have a categorical origin before.\n", "  We propose a new type of electromagnetic transients associated with the birth\nof binary black holes (BBHs), which may lead to merger events accompanied by\ngravitational waves in $\\sim0.1-1$ Gyr. We consider the newborn BBHs formed\nthrough the evolution of isolated massive stellar binaries. For a close massive\nbinary, consisting of a primary black hole (BH) and a secondary Wolf-Rayet (WR)\nstar that are orbiting around each other, the spin period of the WR star can be\ntidally synchronized to its orbital period. Then, the angular momentum of the\nouter material of the WR star is large enough to form an accretion disk around\na newborn, secondary BH, following its core-collapse. This disk may produce an\nenergetic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\\sim10^{50}-10^{52}$ erg and an\noutflow velocity of $\\sim10^{10}\\rm~cm~s^{-1}$, resulting in an optical\ntransient with an absolute magnitude from $\\sim -14$ to $\\sim-17$ with a\nduration of around a day. This type of transient also produces detectable radio\nsignals $\\sim1-10$ years after the birth of BBHs, via synchrotron emission from\nnon-thermal electrons accelerated at external shocks. The predicted optical\ntransients have a shorter duration than ordinary core-collapse supernovae.\nDedicated optical transient surveys can detect them, and distinguish it from\nordinary SNe using the different features of its light curve and late-time\nspectrum. In the paper I, we investigate disk-driven outflows from the\nsecondary BH, whereas possible signals from the primary BH will be discussed in\nthe paper II.\n", "  We present a study of the lower critical field, \\hc1, of \\STO as a function\nof carrier concentration with the aim of quantifying the superfluid density. At\nlow carrier concentration (i.e. the underdoped side), superfluid density and\nthe carrier concentration in the normal state are equal within experimental\nmargin. A significant deviation between the two numbers starts at optimal\ndoping and gradually increases with doping. The inverse of the penetration\ndepth and the critical temperature follow parallel evolutions as in the case of\ncuprate superconductors. In the overdoped regime, the zero-temperature\nsuperfluid density becomes much lower than the normal-state carrier density\nbefore vanishing all together. We show that the density mismatch and the\nclean-to-dirty crossover are concomitant. Our results imply that the\ndiscrepancy between normal and superconducting densities is expected whenever\nthe superconducting gap becomes small enough to put the system in the dirty\nlimit. A quantitative test of the dirty BCS theory is not straightforward, due\nto he multiplicity of the bands in superconducting strontium titanate.\n", "  Without actively aligning the reference frames, the\nreference-frame-independent quantum key distribution (RFI-QKD) can generate\nsecure keys even when the reference frames drift slowly. Here, we propose a new\nscheme on the decoy-state RFI-QKD, where the basis assignments of two\nlegitimate parties are biased, reducing the fraction of mismatched-basis data.\nWhen accounting for statistical fluctuations under different misalignments of\nreference frames, we investigate the performance of biased decoy-state RFI-QKD\nwith full parameter optimization. We also make a clear comparison between the\nnew scheme with other practical schemes, e.g., unbiased decoy-state RFI-QKD and\nbiased decoy-state BB84-QKD. Simulation results demonstrate that the new\nproposed biased decoy-state RFI-QKD can significantly improve the performance\n(secret key rate and secure transmission distance) of practical QKD systems.\n", "  We study how superconducting Tc is affected as an electronic system in a\ntetragonal environment is tuned to a nematic quantum critical point (QCP).\nIncluding coupling of the electronic nematic variable to the relevant lattice\nstrain restricts criticality only to certain high symmetry directions. This\nallows a weak-coupling treatment, even at the QCP. We develop a criterion\ndistinguishing weak and strong Tc enhancements upon approaching the QCP. We\nshow that negligible Tc enhancement occurs only if pairing is dominated by a\nnon-nematic interaction away from the QCP, and simultaneously if the\nelectron-strain coupling is sufficiently strong. We argue this is the case of\nthe iron superconductors.\n", "  Thermodynamics is usually formulated on the presumption that the observer has\ncomplete information about the system he/she deals with: no parasitic current,\nexact evaluation of the forces that drive the system. For example, the\nacclaimed Fluctuation Relation (FR), relating the probability of time-forward\nand time-reversed trajectories, assumes that the measurable transitions suffice\nto characterize the process as Markovian (in our case, a continuous-time jump\nprocess). However, most often the observer only measures a marginal current. We\nshow that he/she will nonetheless produce an effective description that does\nnot dispense with the fundamentals of thermodynamics, including the FR and the\n2nd law. Our results stand on the mathematical construction of a hidden time\nreversal of the dynamics, and on the physical requirement that the observed\ncurrent only accounts for a single transition in the configuration space of the\nsystem. We employ a simple abstract example to illustrate our results and to\ndiscuss the feasibility of generalizations.\n", "  System of a two-flavor mixture of ultra-cold fermions confined in a\none-dimensional harmonic trap is studied in the frame of the center of mass. We\npresent a numerical method of obtaining energetic spectra in this frame for an\narbitrary mass ratio of fermionic species. We identify a specific invariant\nencoded in many-body correlations which enable one to determine an eigenstate\nof the Hamiltonian and to label excitations of the center of mass. The tool\npresented may be particularly useful in experimental analysis of the\ninterparticle interactions which do not affect the center of mass excitations\nin a harmonic potential.\n", "  The diffusion-driven growth of a foam ball is a phenomenon that appears in\nmany manufacturing process as well as in a variety of geological phenomena.\nUsually these processes are greatly affected by gravity, as foam is much\nlighter than the surrounding liquid. However, the growth of the foam free of\ngravity effects is still very relevant, as it is connected to manufacturing in\nspace and to the forma- tion of rocks in meteorites and other small celestial\nbodies. The aim of this research is to investigate experimentally the growth of\na bubble cloud growing in a gas-supersaturated liquid in microgravity\nconditions. Here, we describe the ex- periments carried out in the drop tower\nof the Center of Ap- plied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM). In few\nwords, a foam seed is formed with spark-induced cavitation in carbonated water,\nwhose time evolution is recorded with two high-speed cameras. Our preliminary\nresults shed some light on how the size of the foam ball scales with time, in\nparticular at times much longer than what could be studied in normal\nconditions, i.e. on the surface of the Earth, where the dynamics of the foam is\nalready dominated by gravity after several milliseconds.\n", "  It has been widely argued that Type-I super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are\ndriven by powerful central engines with a long-lasting energy injection after\nthe core-collapse of massive progenitors. One of the popular hypotheses is that\nthe hidden engines are fast-rotating pulsars with a magnetic field of\n$B\\sim{10}^{13}-{10}^{15}$ G. Murase, Kashiyama & Meszaros (2016) showed that\nquasi-steady radio/submm emission from non-thermal electron-positron pairs in\nnascent pulsar wind nebulae can be used as a counterpart of such pulsar-driven\nsupernovae (SNe). In this work, focusing on the nascent SLSN-I remnants, we\nexamine constraints that can be placed by radio emission. We show that the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimetre Array (ALMA) can detect the radio nebula\nfrom SNe at $D_{\\rm L} \\sim 1 \\ \\rm Gpc$ in a few years after the explosion,\nwhile the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) can also detect the counterpart in a\nfew decades. The proposed radio followup observation could solve the parameter\ndegeneracy in the pulsar-driven SN model for optical/UV light curves, and could\nalso give us clues to young neutron star scenarios for SLSNe-I and fast radio\nbursts.\n", "  Recent experimental work on the nephrotoxicity of contaminants in drinking\nwater using laboratory mice, motivated by the need to understand the origin of\nchronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology is examined within our\nunderstanding of the hydration of ions and proteins. Qualitative considerations\nbased on Hofmeister-type action of these ions, as well as quantitative\nelectrochemical models for the Gibbs free-energy change for ion-pair formation\nare used to explain why Cd$^{2+}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and water hardness\ndue to Mg$^{2+}$ ions (but not Ca$^{2+}$) can be expected to be more\nnephrotoxic, while AsO$_3^{3-}$ in the presence of F$^-$ and hardness may be\nexpected to be less nephrotoxic. The analysis is applied to a variety of ionic\nspecies typically found in water to predict their likely combined\nelectro-chemical action. These results clarify the origins of chronic kidney\ndisease in the north-central province of Sri Lanka. The conclusion is further\nstrengthened by a study of the dietary load of Cd and As, where the dietary\nloads are found to be safe, especially when the mitigating effects of\nmicronutrient ionic forms of Zn and Se, as well as corrections for\nbio-availability are taken in to account. The resulting aetiological picture\nsupports the views that F$^-$, Cd$^{2+}$ (to a lesser extent), and Mg$^{2+}$\nions found in stagnant household well water act together with enhanced\ntoxicity, becoming the most likely causative factor of the disease. Similar\nincidence of CKDu found in other tropical climates may have similar geological\norigins.\n", "  Majorana fermions can be realized as quasiparticles in topological\nsuperconductors, with potential applications in topological quantum computing.\nRecently, lattices of magnetic adatoms deposited on the surface of s-wave\nsuperconductors - Shiba lattices - have been proposed as a new platform for\ntopological superconductivity. These systems possess the great advantage that\nthey are accessible via scanning-probe techniques, and thus enable the local\nmanipulation and detection of Majorana modes. Realizing quantum bits on this\nbasis will rely on the creation of nanoscopic Shiba lattices, so-called Shiba\nislands. Here, we demonstrate that the topological Majorana edge modes of such\nislands display universal electronic and transport properties. Most remarkably,\nthese Majorana modes possess a quantized charge conductance that is\nproportional to the topological Chern number, C, and carry a supercurrent whose\nchirality reflects the sign of C. These results establish nanoscopic Shiba\nislands as promising components in future topology-based devices.\n", "  Quantum field theory (QFT) is supposed to be gauge invariant. However it has\nbeen well established that a direct calculation of the vacuum polarization\ntensor produces a non-gauge invariant result. In this paper it will be shown\nthat this problem is due to the fact that there is a lower bound to the free\nfield energy in QFT. The vacuum polarization tensor will be calculated in 1+1\ndimensional space-time and is shown not to be gauge invariant. The gauge\ninvariance of the theory can be restored through a regularization procedure\nwhich eliminates the non-gauge invariant terms. However it will be shown that\nthis will impact the free field energy. If the free field energy is defined so\nthat the vacuum state has an energy of zero then the impact of regularization\nis to introduce states whose free field energy is less than zero.\n", "  We propose an alternative analytical expression for the density of states of\na clean graphene in the nearest-neighbor approximation. In contrast to the\npreviously known expression, it can be written as a single formula valid for\nthe whole energy range. The correspondence with the previously known expression\nis shown and the limiting cases are analyzed.\n", "  Despite the fact that experimentally with a high degree of statistical\nsignificance only a single Standard Model--like Higgs boson is discovered at\nthe LHC, extended Higgs sectors with multiple scalar fields not excluded by\ncombined fits of the data are more preferable theoretically for internally\nconsistent realistic models of particle physics. We analyze the inflationary\nscenarios which could be induced by the two-Higgs doublet potential of the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) where five scalar fields have\nnonminimal couplings to gravity. Observables following from such MSSM-inspired\nmultifield inflation are calculated and a number of consistent inflationary\nscenarios are constructed. Cosmological evolution with different initial\nconditions for the multifield system leads to consequences fully compatible\nwith observational data on the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio.\nIt is demonstrated that the strong coupling approximation is precise enough to\ndescribe such inflationary scenarios.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments with proximitized nanowires, we study a\nmesoscopic s-wave superconductor connected via point contacts to normal-state\nleads. We demonstrate that at energies below the charging energy the system is\ndescribed by the two-channel Kondo model, which can be brought to the quantum\ncritical regime by varying the gate potential and conductances of the contacts.\n", "  Quantum oscillations, conventionally thought to be a metallic property, have\nrecently been shown to arise in certain kinds of insulators, with properties\nvery different from those in metals. All departures from the canonical behavior\nfound so far arise only in the amplitude and the phase but not in the\nfrequency. Here I show that such robustness in the behavior of the frequency is\nonly valid for a particle-hole symmetric insulator; in a strongly particle-hole\nasymmetric insulator, de Haas-van Alphen oscillations (oscillations in\nmagnetization and susceptibility) and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations\n(oscillations in the density of states) exhibit different frequencies, with the\nfrequency of the latter changing with temperature. I demonstrate these effects\nwith numerical calculations on a lattice model, and provide a theory to account\nfor the unusual behavior.\n", "  We construct a four-dimensional SU(5) grand unified theory in which the\nproton is stable. The Standard Model leptons reside in the 5 and 10 irreps of\nSU(5), whereas the quarks live in the 40 and 50 irreps. The SU(5) gauge\nsymmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation values of the scalar 24 and 75\nirreps. All non-Standard Model fields are heavy. Stability of the proton\nrequires three relations between the parameters of the model to hold. However,\nabandoning the requirement of absolute proton stability, the model fulfills\ncurrent experimental constraints without fine-tuning.\n", "  The dynamical response of spin-S (S=1, 3/2, 2, 3) Ising ferromagnet to the\nplane propagating wave , standing magnetic field wave and uniformly oscillating\nfield with constant frequency are studied separately in two dimensions by\nextensive Monte Carlo simulation. Depending upon the strength of the magnetic\nfield and the value of the spin state of the Ising spin lattice two different\ndynamical phases are observed. For a fixed value of S and the amplitude of the\npropagating magnetic field wave the system undergoes a dynamical phase\ntransition from propagating phase to pinned phase as the temperature of the\nsystem is cooled down. Similarly in case with standing magnetic wave the system\nundergoes dynamical phase transition from high temperature phase where spins\noscillates coherently in alternate bands of half wavelength of the standing\nmagnetic wave to the low temperature pinned or spin frozen phase. For a fixed\nvalue of the amplitude of magnetic field oscillation the transition temperature\nis observed to decrease to a limiting value as the value of spin S is\nincreased. The time averaged magnetisation over a full cycle of the magnetic\nfield oscillation plays the role of the dynamic order parameter. A\ncomprehensive phase boundary is drawn in the plane of magnetic field amplitude\nand dynamic transition temperature. It is found that the phase boundary shrinks\ninwards for high value of spin state S. Also in the low temperature (and high\nfield) region the phase boundaries are closely spaced.\n", "  In this letter, we study the pion momentum distribution of a coherent source\nand investigate the influences of coherent emission on the pion\ntransverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectrum and elliptic anisotropy. With a partially\ncoherent source, constructed by a conventional viscous hydrodynamics model\n(chaotic part) and a parameterized expanding coherent source model, we\nreproduce the pion $p_T$ spectrum and elliptic anisotropy coefficient\n$v_2(p_T)$ in the peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. It\nis found that the influences of coherent emission on the pion $p_T$ spectrum\nand $v_2(p_T)$ are related to the initial size and shape of the coherent\nsource, largely due to the interference effect. However, the effect of source\ndynamical evolution on coherent emission is relatively small. The results of\nthe partially coherent source with 33% coherent emission and 67% chaotic\nemission are consistent with the experimental measurements of the pion $p_T$\nspectrum, $v_2(p_T)$, and especially four-pion Bose-Einstein correlations.\n", "  A numerical solver for the elastic wave eigenmodes in acoustic waveguides of\ninhomogeneous cross-section is presented. Operating under the assumptions of\nlinear, isotropic materials, it utilizes a finite-difference method on a\nstaggered grid to solve for the acoustic eigenmodes of the vector-field elastic\nwave equation. Free, fixed, symmetry, and anti-symmetry boundary conditions are\nimplemented, enabling efficient simulation of acoustic structures with\ngeometrical symmetries and terminations. Perfectly matched layers are also\nimplemented, allowing for the simulation of radiative (leaky) modes. The method\nis analogous to eigenmode solvers ubiquitously employed in electromagnetics to\nfind waveguide modes, and enables design of acoustic waveguides as well as\nseamless integration with electromagnetic solvers for optomechanical device\ndesign. The accuracy of the solver is demonstrated by calculating\neigenfrequencies and mode shapes for common acoustic modes in several simple\ngeometries and comparing the results to analytical solutions where available or\nto numerical solvers based on more computationally expensive methods.\n", "  We perform a comprehensive Weinberg eigenvalue analysis of a representative\nset of modern nucleon-nucleon interactions derived within chiral effective\nfield theory. Our set contains local, semilocal, and nonlocal potentials,\ndeveloped by Gezerlis, Tews et al. (2013); Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei{\\ss}ner\n(2015); and Entem, Machleidt, and Nosyk (2017) as well as Carlsson, Ekstr\\\"om\net al. (2016), respectively. The attractive eigenvalues show a very similar\nbehavior for all investigated interactions, whereas the magnitudes of the\nrepulsive eigenvalues sensitively depend on the details of the regularization\nscheme of the short- and long-range parts of the interactions. We demonstrate\nthat a direct comparison of numerical cutoff values of different interactions\nis in general misleading due to the different analytic form of regulators; for\nexample, a cutoff value of $R=0.8$ fm for the semilocal interactions\ncorresponds to about $R=1.2$ fm for the local interactions. Our detailed\ncomparison of Weinberg eigenvalues provides various insights into\nidiosyncrasies of chiral potentials for different orders and partial waves.\nThis shows that Weinberg eigenvalues could be used as a helpful monitoring\nscheme when constructing new interactions.\n", "  In large-$N_c$ conformal field theories with classical holographic duals,\ninverse coupling constant corrections are obtained by considering\nhigher-derivative terms in the corresponding gravity theory. In this work, we\nuse type IIB supergravity and bottom-up Gauss-Bonnet gravity to study the\ndynamics of boost-invariant Bjorken hydrodynamics at finite coupling. We\nanalyze the time-dependent decay properties of non-local observables (scalar\ntwo-point functions and Wilson loops) probing the different models of Bjorken\nflow and show that they can be expressed generically in terms of a few field\ntheory parameters. In addition, our computations provide an analytically\nquantifiable probe of the coupling-dependent validity of hydrodynamics at early\ntimes in a simple model of heavy-ion collisions, which is an observable closely\nanalogous to the hydrodynamization time of a quark-gluon plasma. We find that\nto third order in the hydrodynamic expansion, the convergence of hydrodynamics\nis improved and that generically, as expected from field theory considerations\nand recent holographic results, the applicability of hydrodynamics is delayed\nas the field theory coupling decreases.\n", "  We present the charged-particle multiplicity distributions over a wide\npseudorapidity range ($-3.4<\\eta<5.0$) for pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=$ 0.9, 7,\nand 8 TeV at the LHC. Results are based on information from the Silicon Pixel\nDetector and the Forward Multiplicity Detector of ALICE, extending the\npseudorapidity coverage of the earlier publications and the high-multiplicity\nreach. The measurements are compared to results from the CMS experiment and to\nPYTHIA, PHOJET and EPOS LHC event generators, as well as IP-Glasma\ncalculations.\n", "  A search for the decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson into a $b\\bar{b}$\npair when produced in association with a $W$ or $Z$ boson is performed with the\nATLAS detector. The analysed data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n36.1 fb$^{-1}$, were collected in proton-proton collisions in Run 2 of the\nLarge Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Final states\ncontaining zero, one and two charged leptons (electrons or muons) are\nconsidered, targeting the decays $Z\\to\\nu\\nu$, $W\\to\\ell\\nu$ and\n$Z\\to\\ell\\ell$. For a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, an excess of events over the\nexpected background from other Standard Model processes is found with an\nobserved significance of 3.5 standard deviations, compared to an expectation of\n3.0 standard deviations. This excess provides evidence for the Higgs boson\ndecay into $b$-quarks and for its production in association with a vector\nboson. The combination of this result with that of the Run 1 analysis yields a\nratio of the measured signal events to the Standard Model expectation equal to\n$0.90 \\pm 0.18 \\rm{(stat.)} ^{+0.21}_{-0.19} \\rm{(syst.)}$. Assuming the\nStandard Model production cross-section, the results are consistent with the\nvalue of the Yukawa coupling to $b$-quarks in the Standard Model.\n", "  We present a study of terahertz frequency magnetoelectric effect in\nferrimagnetic pyroelectric CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$ and its Ni-doped variants. The\nterahertz absorption spectrum of these materials consists of spin excitations\nand low-frequency infrared-active phonons. We studied the\nmagnetic-field-induced changes in the terahertz refractive index and absorption\nin magnetic fields up to 17 T. We find that the magnetic field modulates the\nstrength of infrared-active optical phonons near 1.2 and 1.6 THz. We use the\nLorentz model of the dielectric function to analyze the measured magnetic-field\ndependence of the refractive index and absorption. We propose that most of the\nmagnetoelectric effect is contributed by the optical phonons near 1.6 THz and\nhigher-frequency resonances. Our experimental results can be used to construct\nand validate more detailed theoretical descriptions of magnetoelectricity in\nCaBaCo$_{4-x}$Ni$_x$O$_7$.\n", "  The study of correlations with no definite causal order has revealed a rich\nstructure emerging when more than two parties are involved. This motivates the\nconsideration of multipartite \"noncausal\" correlations that cannot be realised\neven if noncausal resources are made available to a smaller number of parties.\nHere we formalise this notion: genuinely N-partite noncausal correlations are\nthose that cannot be produced by grouping N parties into two or more subsets,\nwhere a causal order between the subsets exists. We prove that such\ncorrelations can be characterised as lying outside a polytope, whose vertices\ncorrespond to deterministic strategies and whose facets define what we call\n\"2-causal\" inequalities. We show that genuinely multipartite noncausal\ncorrelations arise within the process matrix formalism, where quantum mechanics\nholds locally but no global causal structure is assumed, although for some\ninequalities no violation was found. We further introduce two refined\ndefinitions that allow one to quantify, in different ways, to what extent\nnoncausal correlations correspond to a genuinely multipartite resource.\n", "  CUORE is a tonne-scale cryogenic detector operating at the Laboratori\nNazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS) that uses tellurium dioxide bolometers to\nsearch for neutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{130}$Te. CUORE is also suitable\nto search for low energy rare events such as solar axions or WIMP scattering,\nthanks to its ultra-low background and large target mass. However, to conduct\nsuch sensitive searches requires improving the energy threshold to 10 keV. In\nthis paper, we describe the analysis techniques developed for the low energy\nanalysis of CUORE-like detectors, using the data acquired from November 2013 to\nMarch 2015 by CUORE-0, a single-tower prototype designed to validate the\nassembly procedure and new cleaning techniques of CUORE. We explain the energy\nthreshold optimization, continuous monitoring of the trigger efficiency, data\nand event selection, and energy calibration at low energies in detail. We also\npresent the low energy background spectrum of CUORE-0 below 60keV. Finally, we\nreport the sensitivity of CUORE to WIMP annual modulation using the CUORE-0\nenergy threshold and background, as well as an estimate of the uncertainty on\nthe nuclear quenching factor from nuclear recoils in CUORE-0.\n", "  Recently, a physical derivation of the Alday-Gaiotto-Tachikawa correspondence\nhas been put forward. A crucial role is played by the complex Chern-Simons\ntheory arising in the 3d-3d correspondence, whose boundary modes lead to Toda\ntheory on a Riemann surface. We explore several features of this derivation and\nsubsequently argue that it can be extended to a generalization of the AGT\ncorrespondence. The latter involves codimension two defects in six dimensions\nthat wrap the Riemann surface. We use a purely geometrical description of these\ndefects and find that the generalized AGT setup can be modeled in a pole region\nusing generalized conifolds. Furthermore, we argue that the ordinary conifold\nclarifies several features of the derivation of the original AGT\ncorrespondence.\n", "  Motivated by an analogy with the spherical model of a ferromagnet, the three\nArcetri models are defined. They present new universality classes, either for\nthe growth of interfaces, or else for lattice gases. They are distinct from the\ncommon Edwards-Wilkinson and Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality classes. Their\nnon-equilibrium evolution can be studied from the exact computation of their\ntwo-time correlators and responses. The first model, in both interpretations,\nhas a critical point in any dimension and shows simple ageing at and below\ncriticality. The exact universal exponents are found. The second and third\nmodel are solved at zero temperature, in one dimension, where both show\nlogarithmic sub-ageing, of which several distinct types are identified.\nPhysically, the second model describes a lattice gas and the third model\ninterface growth. A clear physical picture on the subsequent time- and\nlength-scales of the sub-ageing process emerges.\n", "  The present work investigates several models of a single real scalar field,\nengendering kinetic term of the Dirac-Born-Infeld type. Such theories introduce\nnonlinearities to the kinetic part of the Lagrangian, which presents a square\nroot restricting the field evolution and including additional powers in\nderivatives of the scalar field, controlled by a real parameter. In order to\nobtain topological solutions analytically, we propose a first-order framework\nthat simplifies the equation of motion ensuring solutions that are linearly\nstable. This is implemented using the deformation method, and we introduce\nexamples presenting two categories of potentials, one having polynomial\ninteractions and the other with nonpolynomial interactions. We also explore how\nthe Dirac-Born-Infeld kinetic term affects the properties of the solutions. In\nparticular, we note that the kinklike solutions are similar to the ones\nobtained through models with standard kinetic term and canonical potential, but\ntheir energy densities and stability potentials vary according to the parameter\nintroduced to control the new models.\n", "  Superfluid vortex dynamics on an infinite cylinder differs significantly from\nthat on a plane. The requirement that a condensate wave function be single\nvalued upon once encircling the cylinder means that such a single vortex cannot\nremain stationary. Instead, it acquires one of a series of quantized\ntranslational velocities around the circumference, the simplest being $\\pm\n\\hbar/(2MR)$, with $M$ the mass of the superfluid particles and $R$ the radius\nof the cylinder. A generalization to a finite cylinder automatically includes\nthese quantum-mechanical effects through the pairing of the single vortex and\nits image in either the top or bottom end of the surface. The dynamics of a\nsingle vortex on this surface provides a hydrodynamic analog of Laughlin\npumping. The interaction energy for two vortices on an infinite cylinder is\nproportional to the classical stream function $\\chi({\\bf r}_{12})$, and it\ncrosses over from logarithmic to linear when the intervortex separation ${\\bf\nr}_{12}$ becomes larger than the cylinder radius. An Appendix summarizes the\nconnection to an earlier study of Ho and Huang for one or more vortices on an\ninfinite cylinder. A second Appendix reviews the topologically equivalent\nplanar annulus, where such quantized vortex motion has no offset, but Laughlin\npumping may be more accessible to experimental observation.\n", "  We present an investigation of inkjet printed strain gauges based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) materials. The technology leverages water-based and\nbiocompatible inks to fabricate strain measurement devices on flexible\nsubstrates such as paper. We demonstrate that the device performance and\nsensitivity are strongly dependent on the printing parameter (i.e., drop-\nspacing, number of printing passes, etc.). We show that values of the Gauge\nFactor up to 125 can be obtained, with large sensitivity (>20%) even when small\nstrains (0.3%) are applied. Furthermore, we provide preliminary examples of\nheterostructure-based strain sensors, enabled by the inkjet printing\ntechnology.\n", "  We show that a CP-violating interaction induced by a derivative coupling\nbetween the running vacuum and a non-conserving baryon current may dynamically\nbreak CPT and trigger baryogenesis through an effective chemical potential. By\nassuming a non-singular class of running vacuum cosmologies which provides a\ncomplete cosmic history (from an early inflationary de Sitter stage to the\npresent day quasi-de Sitter acceleration), it is found that an acceptable\nbaryon asymmetry is generated for many different choices of the model\nparameters. It is interesting that the same ingredient (running vacuum energy\ndensity) addresses several open cosmological questions/problems: avoids the\ninitial singularity, provides a smooth exit for primordial inflation,\nalleviates both the coincidence and the cosmological constant problems, and,\nfinally, is also capable of explaining the generation of matter-antimatter\nasymmetry in the very early Universe.\n", "  Experiments on optical and STM injection of carriers in layered\n$\\mathrm{MX_2}$ materials revealed the formation of nanoscale patterns with\nnetworks and globules of domain walls. This is thought to be responsible for\nthe metallization transition of the Mott insulator and for stabilization of a\n\"hidden\" state. In response, here we present studies of the classical charged\nlattice gas model emulating the superlattice of polarons ubiquitous to the\nmaterial of choice $1T-\\mathrm{TaS_2}$. The injection pulse was simulated by\nintroducing a small random concentration of voids which subsequent evolution\nwas followed by means of Monte Carlo cooling. Below the detected phase\ntransition, the voids gradually coalesce into domain walls forming locally\nconnected globules and then the global network leading to a mosaic\nfragmentation into domains with different degenerate ground states. The\nobtained patterns closely resemble the experimental STM visualizations. The\nsurprising aggregation of charged voids is understood by fractionalization of\ntheir charges across the walls' lines.\n", "  We calculate a class of three-loop Feynman diagrams which contribute to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic approximation for the width difference\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_{s}$ in the $B_s-\\bar{B}_s$ system. The considered diagrams\ncontain a closed fermion loop in a gluon propagator and constitute the order\n$\\alpha_s^2 N_f$, where $N_f$ is the number of light quarks. Our results entail\na considerable correction in that order, if $\\Delta\\Gamma_{s}$ is expressed in\nterms of the pole mass of the bottom quark. If the $\\overline{MS}$ scheme is\nused instead, the correction is much smaller. As a result, we find a decrease\nof the scheme dependence. Our result also indicates that the usually quoted\nvalue of the NLO renormalization scale dependence underestimates the\nperturbative error.\n", "  We consider two coupled quantum tops with angular momentum vectors\n$\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{M}$. The coupling Hamiltonian defines the\nFeinberg-Peres model which is a known paradigm of quantum chaos. We show that\nthis model has a nonstandard symmetry with respect to the Altland-Zirnbauer\ntenfold symmetry classification of quantum systems which extends the well-known\nthreefold way of Wigner and Dyson (referred to as `standard' symmetry classes\nhere). We identify that the nonstandard symmetry classes BD$I_0$ (chiral\northogonal class with no zero modes), BD$I_1$ (chiral orthogonal class with one\nzero mode) and C$I$ (antichiral orthogonal class) as well as the standard\nsymmetry class A$I$ (orthogonal class). We numerically analyze the specific\nspectral quantum signatures of chaos related to the nonstandard symmetries. In\nthe microscopic density of states and in the distribution of the lowest\npositive energy eigenvalue we show that the Feinberg-Peres model follows the\npredictions of the Gaussian ensembles of random-matrix theory in the\nappropriate symmetry class if the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic.\nIn a crossover to mixed and near-integrable classical dynamics we show that\nthese signatures disappear or strongly change.\n", "  The compound Sr$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$FBiS$_{2}$ belongs to the intensively\nstudied family of layered BiS$_2$ superconductors. It attracts special\nattention because superconductivity at $T_{sc} = 2.8$ K was found to coexist\nwith local-moment ferromagnetic order with a Curie temperature $T_C = 7.5$ K.\nRecently it was reported that upon replacing S by Se $T_C$ drops and\nferromagnetism becomes of an itinerant nature (Thakur et al., Sci. Reports 6,\n37527 (2016)). At the same time $T_{sc}$ increases and it was argued\nsuperconductivity coexists with itinerant ferromagnetism. Here we report a muon\nspin rotation and relaxation study ($\\mu$SR) conducted to investigate the\ncoexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetic order in\nSr$_{0.5}$Ce$_{0.5}$FBiS$_{2-x}$Se$_x$ with $x=0.5$ and $1.0$. By inspecting\nthe muon asymmetry function we find that both phases do not coexist on the\nmicroscopic scale, but occupy different sample volumes. For $x=0.5$ and $x=1.0$\nwe find a ferromagnetic volume fraction of $\\sim \\, 8 \\%$ and $\\sim \\, 30 \\%$\nat $T=0.25$ K, well below $T_{C} = 3.4$ K and $T_C = 3.3$ K, respectively. For\n$x=1.0$ ($T_{sc} = 2.9$ K) the superconducting phase occupies the remaining\nsample volume ($\\sim \\, 70 \\%$), as shown by transverse field experiments that\nprobe the Gaussian damping due to the vortex lattice. We conclude\nferromagnetism and superconductivity are macroscopically phase separated.\n", "  Adopting two independent approaches (a) Lorentz-invariance of physical laws\nand (b) local phase invariance of quantum field theory applied to the Dirac\nLagrangian for massive electrically neutral Dirac particles, we rediscovered\nthe fundamental field equations of Heaviside Gravity (HG) of 1893 and\nMaxwellian Gravity (MG), which look different from each other due to a sign\ndifference in some terms of their respective field equations. However, they are\nshown to represent two mathematical representations of a single physical theory\nof vector gravity that we name here as Heaviside-Maxwellian Gravity (HMG), in\nwhich the speed of gravitational waves in vacuum is uniquely found to be equal\nto the speed of light in vacuum. We also corrected a sign error in Heaviside's\nspeculative gravitational analogue of the Lorentz force law. This spin-1 HMG is\nshown to produce attractive force between like masses under static condition,\ncontrary to the prevalent view of field theorists. Galileo's law of\nuniversality of free fall is a consequence of HMG, without any initial\nassumption of the equality of gravitational mass with velocity-dependent mass.\nWe also note a new set of Lorentz-Maxwell's equations having the same physical\neffects as the standard set - a byproduct of our present study.\n", "  We have revisited the nucleation process based on the Lifshitz-Kagan theory,\nwhich is the underlying mechanism of conversion of a pulsar constituted of\nhadronic matter to a quark star. We have selected appropriate models that have\nbeen tested against experimental and observational constraints to restrict the\nmodel arbitrariness present in previous investigations. The phase transition\npressures and chemical potentials have been identified and afterwards, the\ntunneling probabilities and the nucleation time were computed. The critical\npressures for which the half life of the metastable hadronic phase is one year\nwere obtained. Even with the restrictions imposed to the selection of models,\nthe results remained model dependent, but we found that the tunneling that\nmakes possible the appearance of stable matter requires an overpressure that is\npractically independent of the quark matter bag constant. Finally, we have\nconfirmed that the nucleation process can be one of the causes of gamma-ray\nbursts.\n", "  We use computational approaches to explore the role of a\nhigh-refractive-index dielectric TiO2 grating with deep subwavelength thickness\non InSb as a tunable coupler for THz surface plasmons. We find a series of\nresonances as the grating couples a normally-incident THz wave to standing\nsurface plasmon waves on both thin and thick InSb layers. In a marked contrast\nwith previously-explored metallic gratings, we observe the emergence of a much\nstronger additional resonance. The mechanism of this giant plasmonic resonance\nis well interpreted by the dispersion of surface plasmon excited in the\nair\\TiO2\\InSb trilayer system. We demonstrate that both the frequency and the\nintensity of the giant resonance can be tuned by varying dielectric grating\nparameters, providing more flexible tunability than metallic gratings. The\nphase and amplitude of the normally-incident THz wave are spatially modulated\nby the dielectric grating to optimize the surface plasmon excitation. The giant\nsurface plasmon resonance gives rise to strong enhancement of the electric\nfield above the grating structure, which can be useful in sensing and\nspectroscopy applications.\n", "  We investigate a special class of the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum models\nbeing perfectly invisible zero-gap systems with a unique bound state at the\nvery edge of continuous spectrum of scattering states. The family includes the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-regularized two particle Calogero systems (conformal quantum\nmechanics models of de Alfaro-Fubini-Furlan) and their rational extensions\nwhose potentials satisfy equations of the KdV hierarchy and exhibit,\nparticularly, a behaviour typical for extreme waves. We show that the two\nsimplest Hamiltonians from the Calogero subfamily determine the fluctuation\nspectra around the $\\mathcal{PT}$-regularized kinks arising as traveling waves\nin the field-theoretical Liouville and $SU(3)$ conformal Toda systems. Peculiar\nproperties of the quantum systems are reflected in the associated exotic\nnonlinear supersymmetry in the unbroken or partially broken phases. The\nconventional $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry is extended here to the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ nonlinear supersymmetry that involves two bosonic generators\ncomposed from Lax-Novikov integrals of the subsystems, one of which is the\ncentral charge of the superalgebra. Jordan states are shown to play an\nessential role in the construction.\n", "  The radioactive noble gas $^{222}$Rn, which can be dissolved in water, is an\nimportant background source for JUNO. In this paper, based on the water system\nof JUNO prototype, two kinds of high sensitivity radon detectors have been\nproposed and developed. The sensitivity of Si-PIN Rn detector, which uses a\nSi-PIN photodiode to detect the $\\alpha$ from $^{214}$Po decay, is\n$\\sim$9.0~mBq/m$^3$. The sensitivity of LS Rn detector, which uses liquid\nscintillator to detect the coincident signals of $\\beta$ from $^{214}$Bi decay\nand $\\alpha$ from $^{214}$Po decay, is $\\sim$64.0~mBq/m$^3$. Both of the two\nkinds of Rn detector have the potential to be developed as an online Rn\nconcentration monitoring equipment for JUNO veto detector.\n", "  We study the conductivities $\\sigma$ of (i) the equilibrium isochoric state\n($\\sigma_{\\rm is}$), (ii) the equilibrium isobaric state ($\\sigma_{\\rm ib}$),\nand also the (iii) non-equilibrium ultrafast matter (UFM) state ($\\sigma_{\\rm\nuf}$) with the ion temperature $T_i$ less than the the electron temperature\n$T_e$. Aluminum, lithium and carbon are considered, being increasingly complex\nwarm dense matter (WDM) systems, with carbon having transient covalent bonds.\nFirst-principles calculations, i.e., neutral-pseudoatom (NPA) calculations and\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) with molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations, are\ncompared where possible with experimental data to characterize $\\sigma_{\\rm\nic}, \\sigma_{\\rm ib}$ and $\\sigma_{\\rm uf}$. The NPA $\\sigma_{\\rm ib}$ are\nclosest to the available experimental data when compared to results from\nDFT+MD, where simulations of about 64-125 atoms are typically used. The\npublished conductivities for Li are reviewed and the value at a temperature of\n4.5 eV is examined using supporting X-ray Thomson scattering calculations. A\nphysical picture of the variations of $\\sigma$ with temperature and density\napplicable to these materials is given. The insensitivity of $\\sigma$ to $T_e$\nbelow 10 eV for carbon, compared to Al and Li, is clarified.\n", "  We determine atomic and electronic structure, formation energy, stability and\nmagnetic properties of native point defects, such as Gallium (Ga) and Nitrogen\n(N) vacancies in bulk and at non-polar (10$\\overline{1}$0) surface of wurtzite\nGallium Nitride (\\textit w-GaN) using, first-principles calculations based on\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT). Under both Ga-rich and N-rich conditions,\nformation energy of N-vacancies is significantly lower than that of\nGa-vacancies in bulk and at (10$\\overline{1}$0) surface. Experimental evidence\nof the presence of N-vacancies was noted from electron energy loss spectroscopy\nmeasurements which further correlated with the high electrical conductivity\nobserved in GaN nanowall network. We find that the Fermi level pins at 0.35\n$\\pm$0.02 eV below Ga derived surface state. Presence of atomic steps in the\nnanostructure due to formation of N-vacancies at the (10$\\overline{1}$0)\nsurface makes its electronic structure metallic. Clustering of N-vacancies and\nGa-Ga metallic bond formation near these vacancies, is seen to be another\nsource of electrical conductivity of faceted GaN nanostructure that is observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  Pipelined algorithms implemented in field programmable gate arrays are being\nextensively used for hardware triggers in the modern experimental high energy\nphysics field and the complexity of such algorithms are increases rapidly. For\ndevelopment of such hardware triggers, algorithms are developed in\n$\\texttt{C++}$, ported to hardware description language for synthesizing\nfirmware, and then ported back to $\\texttt{C++}$ for simulating the firmware\nresponse down to the single bit level. We present a $\\texttt{C++}$ software\nframework which automatically simulates and generates hardware description\nlanguage code for pipelined arithmetic algorithms.\n", "  Comet composition provides critical information on the chemical and physical\nprocesses that took place during the formation of the Solar system. We report\nhere on millimetre spectroscopic observations of the long-period bright comet\nC/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) using the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) band 1\nreceiver between 2015 January UT 16.948 to 18.120, when the comet was at\nheliocentric distance of 1.30 AU and geocentric distance of 0.53 AU. Bright\ncomets allow for sensitive observations of gaseous volatiles that sublimate in\ntheir coma. These observations allowed us to detect HCN, CH3OH (multiple\ntransitions), H2CO and CO, and to measure precise molecular production rates.\nAdditionally, sensitive upper limits were derived on the complex molecules\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and formamide (NH2CHO) based on the average of the\nstrongest lines in the targeted spectral range to improve the signal-to-noise\nratio. Gas production rates are derived using a non-LTE molecular excitation\ncalculation involving collisions with H2O and radiative pumping that becomes\nimportant in the outer coma due to solar radiation. We find a depletion of CO\nin C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) with a production rate relative to water of 2 per cent,\nand relatively low abundances of Q(HCN)/Q(H2O), 0.1 per cent, and\nQ(H2CO)/Q(H2O), 0.2 per cent. In contrast the CH3OH relative abundance\nQ(CH3OH)/Q(H2O), 2.2 per cent, is close to the mean value observed in other\ncomets. The measured production rates are consistent with values derived for\nthis object from other facilities at similar wavelengths taking into account\nthe difference in the fields of view. Based on the observed mixing ratios of\norganic molecules in four bright comets including C/2014 Q2, we find some\nsupport for atom addition reactions on cold dust being the origin of some of\nthe molecules.\n", "  Bypass rewiring improves connectivity and robustness of networks against\nremoval of nodes including failures and attacks. A concept of bypass rewiring\non directed networks is proposed, and random bypass rewiring on infinite\ndirected random networks is analytically and numerically investigated with\nsimulations. As a result, random bypass rewiring makes infinite directed\n(undirected) random networks extremely robust for arbitrary occupation\nprobabilities if and only if in-degree of every node except a fixed number of\nnodes is equal to the out-degree (every node except a finite number of nodes\nhas even degree); bypass rewiring makes the percolation threshold 0.\nConsequently, a finite network has a strongly connected spanning subnetwork\nwhich has an Eulerian path or cycle if and only if there exists an way of\nbypass rewiring to make the finite network extremely robust for every\ncombination of removed nodes; Eulerian networks are extremely robust for every\ncombination of removed nodes.\n", "  Experimental observations at the LHC of the collective effects in small\nsystems such as $pp$--scattering suggest introduction of the centrality\nvariable to classify collision events similar to the case of nucleus--nucleus\ncollisions. We discuss this issue with reference to the existing measurements\nat the LHC and the asymptotical energy region.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is thought to drive a wide variety of dynamic phenomena\nin the solar atmosphere. Yet the detailed physical mechanisms driving\nreconnection are difficult to discern in the remote sensing observations that\nare used to study the solar atmosphere. In this paper we exploit the\nhigh-resolution instruments Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and\nthe new CHROMIS Fabry-Perot instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST)\nto identify the intermittency of magnetic reconnection and its association with\nthe formation of plasmoids in so-called UV bursts in the low solar atmosphere.\nThe Si IV 1403A UV burst spectra from the transition region show evidence of\nhighly broadened line profiles with often non-Gaussian and triangular shapes,\nin addition to signatures of bidirectional flows. Such profiles had previously\nbeen linked, in idealized numerical simulations, to magnetic reconnection\ndriven by the plasmoid instability. Simultaneous CHROMIS images in the\nchromospheric Ca II K 3934A line now provide compelling evidence for the\npresence of plasmoids, by revealing highly dynamic and rapidly moving\nbrightenings that are smaller than 0.2 arcsec and that evolve on timescales of\norder seconds. Our interpretation of the observations is supported by detailed\ncomparisons with synthetic observables from advanced numerical simulations of\nmagnetic reconnection and associated plasmoids in the chromosphere. Our results\nhighlight how subarcsecond imaging spectroscopy sensitive to a wide range of\ntemperatures combined with advanced numerical simulations that are realistic\nenough to compare with observations can directly reveal the small-scale\nphysical processes that drive the wide range of phenomena in the solar\natmosphere.\n", "  Despite much anticipation of valleytronics as a candidate to replace the\nageing CMOS-based information processing, its progress is severely hindered by\nthe lack of practical ways to manipulate valley polarization all-electrically\nin an electrostatic setting. Here we propose a class of all-electric-controlled\nvalley filter, valve and logic gate based on the valley-contrasting transport\nin a merging Dirac cones system. The central mechanism of these devices lies on\nthe pseudospin-assisted quantum tunneling which effectively quenches the\ntransport of one valley when its pseudospin configuration mismatches that of a\ngate-controlled scattering region. The valley polarization can be abruptly\nswitched into different states and remains stable over semi-infinite\ngate-voltage windows. Colossal tunneling valley-pseudo-magnetoresistance ratio\nof over 10,000\\% can be achieved in a valley-valve setup. We further propose a\nvalleytronic-based logic gate capable of covering all 16 types of two-input\nBoolean logics. Remarkably, the valley degree of freedom can be harnessed to\nresurrect logical-reversibility in two-input universal Boolean gate. The (2+1)\npolarization states -- two distinct valleys plus a null polarization --\nre-establish one-to-one input-to-output mapping, a crucial requirement for\nlogical-reversibility, and significantly reduce the complexity of reversible\ncircuits due to the built-in nature of valley degree of freedom. Our results\nsuggest that the synergy of valleytronics and digital logics may provide new\nparadigms for valleytronic-based information processing and reversible\ncomputing.\n", "  The twisting deformation of mechanically stretched DNA molecules is studied\nby a coarse grained Hamiltonian model incorporating the fundamental\ninteractions that stabilize the double helix and accounting for the radial and\nangular base pair fluctuations. The latter are all the more important at short\nlength scales in which DNA fragments maintain an intrinsic flexibility. The\npresented computational method simulates a broad ensemble of possible molecule\nconformations characterized by a specific average twist and determines the\nenergetically most convenient helical twist by free energy minimization. As\nthis is done for any external load, the method yields the characteristic\ntwist-stretch profile of the molecule and also computes the changes in the\nmacroscopic helix parameters i.e. average diameter and rise distance. It is\npredicted that short molecules under stretching should first over-twist and\nthen untwist by increasing the external load. Moreover, applying a constant\nload and simulating a torsional strain which over-twists the helix, it is found\nthat the average helix diameter shrinks while the molecule elongates, in\nagreement with the experimental trend observed in kilo-base long sequences. The\nquantitative relation between percent relative elongation and superhelical\ndensity at fixed load is derived. The proposed theoretical model and\ncomputational method offer a general approach to characterize specific DNA\nfragments and predict their macroscopic elastic response as a function of the\neffective potential parameters of the mesoscopic Hamiltonian.\n", "  Although compelling assessments have been examined in recent years, more\nstudies are required to yield a better understanding of the several methods\nwhere assessment techniques significantly affect student learning process. Most\nof the educational research in this area does not consider demographics data,\ndiffering methodologies, and notable sample size. To address these drawbacks,\nthe objective of our study is to analyse student learning outcomes of multiple\nassessment formats for a web-facilitated in-class section with an asynchronous\nonline class of a core data communications course in the Undergraduate IT\nprogram of the Information Sciences and Technology (IST) Department at George\nMason University (GMU). In this study, students were evaluated based on course\nassessments such as home and lab assignments, skill-based assessments, and\ntraditional midterm and final exams across all four sections of the course. All\nsections have equivalent content, assessments, and teaching methodologies.\nStudent demographics such as exam type and location preferences are considered\nin our study to determine whether they have any impact on their learning\napproach. Large amount of data from the learning management system (LMS),\nBlackboard (BB) Learn, had to be examined to compare the results of several\nassessment outcomes for all students within their respective section and\namongst students of other sections. To investigate the effect of dissimilar\nassessment formats on student performance, we had to correlate individual\nquestion formats with the overall course grade. The results show that\ncollective assessment formats allow students to be effective in demonstrating\ntheir knowledge.\n", "  To enhance student learning, we demonstrate an experimental study to analyze\nstudent learning outcomes in online and in-class sections of a core data\ncommunications course of the Undergraduate IT program in the Information\nSciences and Technology (IST) Department at George Mason University (GMU). In\nthis study, student performance is evaluated based on course assessments. This\nincludes home and lab assignments, skill-based assessment, and traditional\nmidterm exam across all 4 sections of the course. All sections have analogous\ncontent, assessment plan and teaching methodologies. Student demographics such\nas exam type and location preferences that may play an important role in their\nlearning process are considered in our study. We had to collect vast amount of\ndata from the learning management system (LMS), Blackboard (BB) Learn, in order\nto compare and study the results of several assessment outcomes for all\nstudents within their respective section and amongst students of other\nsections. We then tried to understand whether demographics have any influence\non student performance by correlating individual student survey response to\nhis/her performance in the class. The numerical results up to mid-semester\nreveal remarkable insights on student success in the online and face-to-face\n(F2F) sections.\n", "  Silicon carbide (SiC) is a wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor with promising\napplications in high-power and high-frequency electronics. Among its many\nuseful properties, the high thermal conductivity is crucial. In this letter,\nthe anisotropic thermal conductivity of three SiC samples: n-type 4H-SiC\n(N-doped 1x10^19 cm-3), unintentionally doped (UID) semi-insulating (SI)\n4H-SiC, and SI 6H-SiC (V-doped 1x10^17 cm-3), is measured using femtosecond\nlaser based time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) over a temperature range from\n250 K to 450 K. We simultaneously measure the thermal conductivity parallel to\n(k_r) and across the hexagonal plane (k_z) for SiC by choosing the appropriate\nlaser spot radius and the modulation frequency for the TDTR measurements. For\nboth k_r and k_z, the following decreasing order of thermal conductivity value\nis observed: SI 4H-SiC > n-type 4H-SiC > SI 6H-SiC. This work serves as an\nimportant benchmark for understanding thermal transport in WBG semiconductors.\n", "  The characterization of non-local correlations with respect to the causal\norder of events in spacetime is still an open question. We systematically\ninvestigate the polytope of relativistic causal boxes in the three-party Bell\nscenario and compute the complete set of extremal boxes in the (3,2,2) scenario\nwith three parties each performing two binary measurements. We highlight the\ndifference with the usual no-signaling polytope by computing the dimension of\nthe RC polytope and contrasting the RC bounds for some well-known multi-player\ngames. We show that no two-party Bell inequality obeys a monogamy relation when\nconstrained only by causality as opposed to the no-signaling conditions. We\nidentify multi-party Bell inequalities and measurement configurations where\ntrade-off relations do exist, showing that device-independent cryptography\nagainst adversaries constrained only by relativistic causality is still not\nexcluded.\n", "  We investigate the gravitational form factors (GFFs) and the longitudinal\nmomentum densities ($p^+$ densities) for proton in a light-front quark-diquark\nmodel. The light-front wave functions are constructed from the soft-wall\nAdS/QCD prediction. The contributions from both the scalar and the axial vector\ndiquarks are considered here. The results are compared with the consequences of\na parametrization of nucleon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the\nlight of recent MRST measurements of parton distribution functions (PDFs) and a\nsoft-wall AdS/QCD model. The spatial distribution of angular momentum for up\nand down quarks inside the nucleon has been presented. At the density level, we\nillustrate different definitions of angular momentum explicitly for an up and\ndown quark in the light-front quark-diquark model inspired by AdS/QCD.\n", "  We have developed an avalanche transistor-based pulse generator for driving\nthe photocathode of an image intensifier, which comprises a mainly capacitive\nload on the order of 100 pF. The circuit produces flat-top pulses with rise\ntime of 2 ns, FWHM of 10 ns and amplitude of tens of V at a high repetition\nrate in the range of tens of MHz. The generator is built of identical avalanche\ntransistor sections connected in parallel and triggered in a sequence,\nsynchronized to a reference rf signal. The described circuit and mode of\noperation overcome the power dissipation limit of avalanche transistor\ngenerators and enable a significant increase of pulse repetition rates. Our\napproach is naturally suited for synchronized imaging applications at low light\nlevels.\n", "  We study dynamics of drift waves in the pair plasma of pulsar magnetosphere.\nIt is shown that nonlinear of the drift waves with plasma particles leads to\nthe formation of small scale structures. We show that cyclotron instability\ndeveloped within these nonlinear structures can be responsible for the\nformation of nanoshots discovered in the radio emission of the Crab pulsar.\n", "  The Hypatia Catalog Database (www.hypatiacatalog.com) is the largest database\nof high resolution stellar abundances for stars within the solar neighborhood.\nIt currently offers 72 elements and species within 5,986 stars, 347 of which\nhost planets. The Hypatia Catalog Database features an interactive table and\nmultiple plotting interfaces that allow easy access and exploration of stellar\nabundance data and properties within the Hypatia Catalog (Hinkel et al. 2014,\n2016, 2017). The Hypatia Catalog is a multidimensional, amalgamate dataset\ncomprised of stellar abundance measurements for FGKM-type stars within 150 pc\nof the Sun from carefully culled literature sources, currently totaling 161\ndatasets, that measured both [Fe/H] and at least one other element. In addition\nto abundances, stellar properties and planetary properties, where applicable,\nhave been made available within the online Hypatia Catalog Database. Data and\nplots can also be downloaded through the website for use in personal code or\npresentations, respectively. The Hypatia Catalog and Hypatia Catalog Database\nwill continue to be routinely updated in order to incorporate the most recent\nstellar abundance data published within the literature.\n", "  White dwarfs are often found in binary systems with orbital periods ranging\nfrom tens of minutes to hours in which they can accrete gas from their\ncompanion stars. In about 15% of these binaries, the magnetic field of the\nwhite dwarf is strong enough ($\\geq 10^6$ Gauss) to channel the accreted matter\nalong field lines onto the magnetic poles. The remaining systems are referred\nto as \"non-magnetic\", since to date there has been no evidence that they have a\ndynamically significant magnetic field. Here we report an analysis of archival\noptical observations of the \"non-magnetic\" accreting white dwarf in the binary\nsystem MV Lyrae (hereafter MV Lyr), whose lightcurve displayed quasi-periodic\nbursts of $\\approx 30$ minutes duration every $\\approx 2$ hours. The\nobservations indicate the presence of an unstable magnetically-regulated\naccretion mode, revealing the existence of magnetically gated accretion, where\ndisk material builds up around the magnetospheric boundary (at the co-rotation\nradius) and then accretes onto the white dwarf, producing bursts powered by the\nrelease of gravitational potential energy. We infer a surface magnetic field\nstrength for the white dwarf in MV Lyr between $2 \\times 10^4 \\leq B \\leq 10^5$\nGauss, too low to be detectable by other current methods. Our discovery\nprovides a new way of studying the strength and evolution of magnetic fields in\naccreting white dwarfs and extends the connections between accretion onto white\ndwarfs, young stellar objects and neutron stars, for which similar magnetically\ngated accretion cysles have been identified.\n", "  Quantum error correction provides a path to large-scale quantum computers,\nbut is built on challenging assumptions about the characteristics of the\nunderlying errors. In particular, the mathematical assumption of independent\nerrors in quantum logic operations is at odds with realistic environments where\nerror-sources may exhibit strong temporal correlations. We present experiments\nenabling the identification of error correlations between operations in quantum\ncircuits, using only projective measurements at the end of the circuit. Using a\nsingle trapped ion qubit and engineered noise with tunable temporal\ncorrelations, we identify a clear signature of error correlations between\nsequential gates in randomly composed quantum circuits, and extract\nquantitative measures linked to the underlying noise correlation length. By\nreplacing all gates in these circuits with \"virtual\" dynamically corrected\ngates (DCGs), we demonstrate that even in the presence of strongly correlated\nnoise the signatures of error correlations between sequential gates appear\nsimilar to standard gates exposed to uncorrelated noise. A theoretical model\napplied to our experiments reveals that common DCGs suppress the correlated\nerror component by over $270\\times$ with $95\\%$ confidence. Using\nblock-correlated noise, we explore the scaling of the effective error\ncorrelation length at the virtual level, and show that DCGs exhibit error\ncorrelations indistinguishable from those arising from uncorrelated noise.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables unconditionally secure communication\nensured by the laws of physics, opening a promising route to security\ninfrastructure for the coming age of quantum computers. QKD's demonstrated\nsecret-key rates (SKRs), however, fall far short of the gigabit-per-second\nrates of classical communication, hindering QKD's widespread deployment. QKD's\nlow SKRs are largely due to existing single-photon-based protocols'\nvulnerability to channel loss. Floodlight QKD (FL-QKD) boosts SKR by\ntransmitting many photons per encoding, while offering security against\ncollective attacks. Here, we report an FL-QKD experiment operating at a 1.3\nGbit/s SKR over a 10-dB-loss channel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst QKD demonstration that achieves a gigabit-per-second-class SKR,\nrepresenting a critical advance toward high-rate QKD at metropolitan-area\ndistances.\n", "  Recent detection of suborbital gamma-ray variability of Flat Spectrum Radio\nQuasar (FSRQ) 3C 279 by Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is in severe conflict\nwith established models of blazar emission. This paper presents the results of\nsuborbital analysis of the Fermi/LAT data for the brightest gamma-ray flare of\nanother FSRQ blazar 3C 454.3 in November 2010 (MJD 55516-22). Gamma-ray light\ncurves are calculated for characteristic time bin lengths as short as 3 min.\nThe measured variations of the 0.1-10 GeV photon flux are tested against the\nhypothesis of steady intraorbit flux. In addition, the structure function is\ncalculated for absolute photon flux differences and for their significances.\nSignificant gamma-ray flux variations are measured only over time scales longer\nthan ~5h, which is consistent with the standard blazar models.\n", "  An increasing number of experimental data indicates the breaking of axial\nsymmetry in many heavy nuclei already in the valley of stability: Multiple\nCoulomb excitation analysed in a rotation invariant way, gamma transition rates\nand energies in odd nuclei, mass predictions, the splitting of Giant Resonances\n(GR), the collective enhancement of nuclear level densities and Maxwellian\naveraged neutron capture cross sections. For the interpretation of these\nexperimental observations the axial symmetry breaking shows up in nearly all\nheavy nuclei as predicted by Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations [1] ;\nthis indicates a nuclear Jahn-Teller effect. We show that nearly no parameters\nremain free to be adjusted by separate fitting to level density or giant\nresonance data, if advance information on nuclear deformations, radii etc. are\ntaken from such calculations with the force parameters already fixed. The data\nanalysis and interpretation have to include the quantum mechanical requirement\nof zero point oscillations and the distinction between static vs. dynamic\nsymmetry breaking has to be regarded.\n", "  Human beings are talkative. What advantage did their ancestors find in\ncommunicating so much? Numerous authors consider this advantage to be \"obvious\"\nand \"enormous\". If so, the problem of the evolutionary emergence of language\namounts to explaining why none of the other primate species evolved anything\neven remotely similar to language. What I propose here is to reverse the\npicture. On closer examination, language resembles a losing strategy. Competing\nfor providing other individuals with information, sometimes striving to be\nheard, makes apparently no sense within a Darwinian framework. At face value,\nlanguage as we can observe it should never have existed or should have been\ncounter-selected. In other words, the selection pressure that led to language\nis still missing. The solution I propose consists in regarding language as a\nsocial signaling device that developed in a context of generalized insecurity\nthat is unique to our species. By talking, individuals advertise their\nalertness and their ability to get informed. This hypothesis is shown to be\ncompatible with many characteristics of language that otherwise are left\nunexplained.\n", "  A spectrum of the quiescent counterpart of the Recurrent Nova candidate M31N\n1966-08a (= M31N 1968-10c) obtained with LRS2 on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope\nreveals the object to be a foreground Galactic dMe flare star, and not a nova\nin M31.\n", "  Polarized infrared emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is\nimportant for testing the basic physics of alignment of ultrasmall grains and\npotentially offers a new way to trace magnetic fields. In this paper, a new\nmodel of polarized PAH emission is presented, taking into account the effect of\nPAH alignment with the magnetic field. The polarization level of PAH emission\nfeatures, for the different phases of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) is\ndiscussed. We find that negatively charged smallest PAHs in the reflection\nnebula can be excited to slightly suprathermal rotation due to enhanced ion\ncollisional excitation, which enhances the degree of PAH alignment and the\npolarization level of PAH emission. The polarization level and polarization\nangle predicted by our model including PAH alignment are supported by the first\ndetection of the polarization of $p\\sim 2\\%$ at 11.3 $\\mu$m PAH feature from\nMWC 1080 nebula by Zhang et al. The theoretical and observational progress\nreveals that PAHs can be aligned with the magnetic field, resulting in a\nmoderate polarization level of spinning dust emission. Polarized infrared PAH\npolarization would be useful for tracing the magnetic fields.\n", "  Two-player games have had a long and fruitful history of applications\nstretching across the social, biological, and physical sciences. Most\napplications of two-player games assume synchronous decisions or moves even\nwhen the games are iterated. But different strategies may emerge as preferred\nwhen the decisions or moves are sequential, or the games are iterated.\nZero-determinant strategies developed by Press and Dyson are a new class of\nstrategies that have been developed for synchronous two-player games, most\nnotably the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Here we apply the Press-Dyson analysis\nto sequential or asynchronous two-player games. We focus on the asynchronous\nprisoner's dilemma. As a first application of the Press-Dyson analysis of the\nasynchronous prisoner's dilemma, tit-for-tat is shown to be an efficient\ndefense against extortionate zero-determinant strategies. Nice strategies like\ntit-for-tat are also shown to lead to Pareto optimal payoffs for both players\nin repeated prisoner's dilemma.\n", "  We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates.\nUtilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are\nsuper-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than t^(1/2) in all\ndirections. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in\nother cell types: run and tumble behavior with L\\'{e}vy-distributed run times,\nand ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We\ndevelop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the\npredictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities\nsuch as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions\nare equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures\nthe short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability\ndistribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that\nincludes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs,\nwhich correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the\nrun times are not L\\'{e}vy distributed. The analysis tools developed here\nshould be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for\nsuperdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.\n", "  We present a multiwavelength study of the cometary \\hii region G12.21--0.10\nusing the VLA and OVRO. Both radio continuum (0.3, 0.7, 2 and 3.6~cm) and\nspectral lines of H41$\\alpha$, $^{13}$CS(2$-$1) \\& (1$-$0), and NH$_{\\rm\n3}$(2,2) \\& (4,4) observations are included. We find two 3~mm continuum peaks\ntoward G12.21--0.10, one of them is spatially coincident with the UC~H~II\nregion, while the other coincides spatially with a molecular clump. We also\nfind that the 0.7, 2 and 3.6~cm continuum and H41$\\alpha$ line are only\ndetected toward the UC~H~II region, while the $^{13}$CS, and NH$_{\\rm 3}$ is\nspatially associated with the molecular clump. Based on the morphology, kinetic\ntemperature ($\\sim$86~K), volumetric density\n($\\sim$1.5$\\times$10$^6$~cm$^{-3}$) and linear size ($\\sim$0.22~pc) of the\nmolecular clump, we suggest this source is consistent with a hot molecular\ncore.\n", "  We provide definitions of renormdynamic motion equations and some properties\nof renormdynamic functions with examples.

For example, starspots have been\ndirectly imaged on the surface of an active giant star using optical\ninterferometry, and magnetic fields have been detected in numerous slowly\nrotating giants and even on supergiants. Here, I review what is currently known\nof the magnetism in cool giant and supergiant stars, and discuss the origin of\nthese fields and what is theoretically known about them.\n", "  The characterization of intermittent, multiscale and transient dynamics using\ndata-driven analysis remains an open challenge. We demonstrate an application\nof the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with sparse sampling for the diagnostic\nanalysis of multiscale physics. The DMD method is an ideal spatiotemporal\nmatrix decomposition that correlates spatial features of computational or\nexperimental data to periodic temporal behavior. DMD can be modified into a\nmultiresolution analysis to separate complex dynamics into a hierarchy of\nmultiresolution timescale components, where each level of the hierarchy divides\ndynamics into distinct background (slow) and foreground (fast) timescales. The\nmultiresolution DMD is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in\nan equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into\nlow-rank spatial modes and their temporal Fourier dynamics. Moreover, these\nmultiresolution DMD modes can be used to determined sparse sampling locations\nwhich are nearly optimal for dynamic regime classification and full state\nreconstruction. Specifically, optimized sensors are efficiently chosen using QR\ncolumn pivots of the DMD library, thus avoiding an NP-hard selection process.\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of the method on several examples, including global\nsea-surface temperature data, and show that only a small number of sensors are\nneeded for accurate global reconstructions and classification of El Ni\\~no\nevents.\n", "  In this paper, we firstly give the definition of the coupled Hall-Littlewood\nfunction and its realization in terms of vertex operators. Then we construct\nthe representation of the two-site generalized $q$-boson model in the algebra\nof coupled Hall-Littlewood functions. Finally, we find that the vertex\noperators which generate coupled Hall-Littlewood functions can also be used to\nobtain the partition function of the A-model topological string on the\nconifold.\n", "  Community detection is one of the pivotal tools for discovering the structure\nof complex networks. Majority of community detection methods rely on\noptimization of certain quality functions characterizing the proposed community\nstructure. Perhaps, the most commonly used of those quality functions is\nmodularity. Many heuristics are claimed to be efficient in modularity\nmaximization, which is usually justified in relative terms through comparison\nof their outcomes with those provided by other known algorithms. However as all\nthe approaches are heuristics, while the complete brute-force is not feasible,\nthere is no known way to understand if the obtained partitioning is really the\noptimal one. In this article we address the modularity maximization problem\nfrom the other side --- finding an upper-bound estimate for the possible\nmodularity values within a given network, allowing to better evaluate suggested\ncommunity structures. Moreover, in some cases when then upper bound estimate\nmeets the actually obtained modularity score, it provides a proof that the\nsuggested community structure is indeed the optimal one. We propose an\nefficient algorithm for building such an upper-bound estimate and illustrate\nits usage on the examples of well-known classical and synthetic networks, being\nable to prove the optimality of the existing partitioning for some of the\nnetworks including well-known Zachary's Karate Club.\n", "  The properties of cuprate high-temperature superconductors are largely shaped\nby competing phases whose nature is often a mystery. Chiefly among them is the\npseudogap phase, which sets in at a doping $p^*$ that is material-dependent.\nWhat determines $p^*$ is currently an open question. Here we show that the\npseudogap cannot open on an electron-like Fermi surface, and can only exist\nbelow the doping $p_{FS}$ at which the large Fermi surface goes from hole-like\nto electron-like, so that $p^*$ $\\leq$ $p_{FS}$. We derive this result from\nhigh-magnetic-field transport measurements in\nLa$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ under pressure, which reveal a large and\nunexpected shift of $p^*$ with pressure, driven by a corresponding shift in\n$p_{FS}$. This necessary condition for pseudogap formation, imposed by details\nof the Fermi surface, is a strong constraint for theories of the pseudogap\nphase. Our finding that $p^*$ can be tuned with a modest pressure opens a new\nroute for experimental studies of the pseudogap.\n", "  SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) films are known to exhibit insulating behavior as their\nthickness approaches four unit cells. We employ electron energy$-$loss (EEL)\nspectroscopy to probe the spatially resolved electronic structures of both\ninsulating and conducting SRO to correlate them with the metal$-$insulator\ntransition (MIT). Importantly, the central layer of the ultrathin insulating\nfilm exhibits distinct features from the metallic SRO. Moreover, EEL near edge\nspectra adjacent to the SrTiO$_3$ (STO) substrate or to the capping layer are\nremarkably similar to those of STO. The site$-$projected density of states\nbased on density functional theory (DFT) partially reflects the characteristics\nof the spectra of these layers. These results may provide important information\non the possible influence of STO on the electronic states of ultrathin SRO.\n", "  Known Majorana fermions models are considered as promising ones for the\npurposes of quantum computing robust to decoherence. One of the most expecting\nbut unachieved goals is an effective control for braiding of Majoranas. Another\none is to describe ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$ topological semimetals, APRES spectra of\nwhich testify on eight-fold degenerate chiral fermions with $SU(2)$ holonomy of\nwave functions, whereas the last can not be reproduced within existing models.\nQuasi-relativistic theory of non-abelian quantum charge transport in\ntopological semimetals is developed for a model with a number of flavors equal\nthree. Majorana-like quasi-particle excitations in the model are described with\naccounting of dynamic mass term arising due to relativistic exchange\ninteractions. Such exotic features of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ semimetals as splitting\nzero-conductance peaks, longitudinal magnetoresistance, minimal direct current\nconductivity, negative differential conductivity have been calculated in\nperfect agreement with experimental data. We propose a new scheme of braiding\nfor three flavor Majorana-like fermions with new non-trivial braiding operator.\nWe demonstrate that in this model, the presence of chiral Majorana-like bound\nstates is controlled as emergence of three pairs of resonance-antiresonance in\nfrequency dependence of dielectric permeability.\n", "  The molecular structure of neutral n-triacontanol mesophases at the n-hexane\n- water interface has been studied by diffuse X-ray scattering using\nsynchrotron radiation. According to the experimental data, a transition to the\nmultilayer adsorption of alkanol occurs at a temperature below the transition\nfrom a gas phase to a liquid Gibbs monolayer.\n", "  Recent theoretical developments of relativistic hydrodynamics applied to\nultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are briefly reviewed. In particular, the\nconcept of a formal gradient expansion is discussed, which is a tool to compare\ndifferent hydrodynamic models with underlying microscopic theories.\n", "  We reply to Comment by J. Gemmer, L. Knipschild, R. Steinigeweg\n(arXiv:1712.02128) on our paper Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 100601 (2017).\n", "  Quasars are among the most luminous sources characterized by their broad band\nspectra ranging from radio through optical to X-ray band, with numerous\nemission and absorption features. Using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\nBoroson & Green (1992) were able to show significant correlations between the\nmeasured parameters. Among the significant correlations projected, the leading\ncomponent, related to Eigenvector 1 (EV1) was dominated by the anti-correlation\nbetween the Fe${\\mathrm{II}}$ optical emission and [OIII] line where the EV1\nalone contained 30% of the total variance. This introduced a way to define a\nquasar main sequence, in close analogy to the stellar main sequence in the\nHertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram (Sulentic et. al 2001). Which of the basic\ntheoretically motivated parameters of an active nucleus (Eddington ratio, black\nhole mass, accretion rate, spin, and viewing angle) is the main driver behind\nthe EV1 yet remains to be answered. We currently limit ourselves to the optical\nwaveband, and concentrate on theoretical modelling the Fe${\\mathrm{II}}$ to\nH$\\mathrm{\\beta}$ ratio, and test the hypothesis that the physical driver of\nEV1 is the maximum of the accretion disk temperature, reflected in the shape of\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED). We performed computations of the\nH$\\mathrm{\\beta}$ and optical Fe${\\mathrm{II}}$ for a broad range of SED peak\nposition using CLOUDY photoionisation code. We assumed that both\nH$\\mathrm{\\beta}$ and Fe${\\mathrm{II}}$ emission come from the Broad Line\nRegion represented as a constant density cloud in a plane-parallel geometry. We\ncompare the results for two different approaches: (1) considering a fixed\nbolometric luminosity for the SED; (2) considering $\\mathrm{L_{bol}/L_{Edd}}$ =\n1.\n", "  The discovery of the proton-radius puzzle and the subsequent deuteron-radius\npuzzle is fueling an on-going debate on possible explanations for the\ndifference in the observed radii obtained from muonic atoms and from\nelectron-nucleus systems. Atomic nuclei have a complex internal structure that\nmust be taken into account when analyzing experimental spectroscopic results.\nAb initio nuclear structure theory provided the so far most precise estimates\nof important corrections to the Lamb shift in muonic atoms and is well poised\nto also investigate nuclear structure corrections to the hyperfine splitting in\nmuonic atoms. Independently on whether the puzzle is due to\nbeyond-the-standard-model physics or not, nuclear structure corrections are a\nnecessary theoretical input to any experimental extraction of electric and\nmagnetic radii from precise muonic atom measurements.\n  Here, we review the status of the calculations performed by the TRIUMF-Hebrew\nUniversity group, focusing on the deuteron, and discuss preliminary results on\nmagnetic sum rules calculated with two-body currents at next-to-leading order.\nTwo-body currents will be an important ingredient in future calculations of\nnuclear structure corrections to the hyperfine splitting in muonic atoms.\n", "  Nd2Hf2O7, belonging to the family of geometrically frustrated cubic rare\nearth pyrochlore oxides, was recently identified to order antiferromagnetically\nbelow T_N = 0.55 K with an all-in/all-out arrangement of Nd3+ moments, however\nwith a much reduced ordered state moment. Herein we investigate the spin\ndynamics and crystal field states of Nd2Hf2O7 using muon spin relaxation (muSR)\nand inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. Our muSR study confirms\nthe long range magnetic ordering and shows evidence for coexisting persistent\ndynamic spin fluctuations deep inside the ordered state down to 42 mK. The INS\ndata show the crytal electric field (CEF) excitations due to the transitions\nboth within the ground state multiplet and to the first excited state\nmultiplet. The INS data are analyzed by a model based on CEF and crystal field\nstates are determined. Strong Ising-type anisotropy is inferred from the ground\nstate wavefunction. The CEF parameters indicate the CEF-split Kramers doublet\nground state of Nd3+ to be consistent with the dipolar-octupolar character.\n", "  Cellular Automata (CAs) are computational models that can capture the\nessential features of systems in which global behavior emerges from the\ncollective effect of simple components, which interact locally. During the last\ndecades, CAs have been extensively used for mimicking several natural processes\nand systems to find fine solutions in many complex hard to solve computer\nscience and engineering problems. Among them, the shortest path problem is one\nof the most pronounced and highly studied problems that scientists have been\ntrying to tackle by using a plethora of methodologies and even unconventional\napproaches. The proposed solutions are mainly justified by their ability to\nprovide a correct solution in a better time complexity than the renowned\nDijkstra's algorithm. Although there is a wide variety regarding the\nalgorithmic complexity of the algorithms suggested, spanning from simplistic\ngraph traversal algorithms to complex nature inspired and bio-mimicking\nalgorithms, in this chapter we focus on the successful application of CAs to\nshortest path problem as found in various diverse disciplines like computer\nscience, swarm robotics, computer networks, decision science and biomimicking\nof biological organisms' behaviour. In particular, an introduction on the first\nCA-based algorithm tackling the shortest path problem is provided in detail.\nAfter the short presentation of shortest path algorithms arriving from the\nrelaxization of the CAs principles, the application of the CA-based shortest\npath definition on the coordinated motion of swarm robotics is also introduced.\nMoreover, the CA based application of shortest path finding in computer\nnetworks is presented in brief. Finally, a CA that models exactly the behavior\nof a biological organism, namely the Physarum's behavior, finding the\nminimum-length path between two points in a labyrinth is given.\n", "  In this paper we focus on the Cauchy problem for the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equation with a rough external force. If the given rough external\nforce is small, we prove the local-in-time existence of this system for any\ninitial data belonging to the critical Besov space\n$\\dot{B}_{p,p}^{-1+\\frac{3}{p}}$, where $3<p<\\infty$. Moreover, We show the\nlong-time behavior of the priori global solutins constructed by us. Also, we\ngive three kinds of uniqueness results of the forced Navier-Stokes equations.\n", "  A brief introduction to the statistical hadronization approach to particle\nproduction in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is given. In the context of\nfluid dynamics modeling various aspects of hadron emission at the freeze-out\nare discussed. Practical applications of the presented concepts are presented\nwithin the THERMINATOR Monte-Carlo hadron generator.\n", "  In the framework of the $(B-L)$ Supersymmetric Standard Model (BLSSM), we\nassess the ability of ground and space based experiments to establish the\nnature of its prevalent Dark Matter (DM) candidate, the sneutrino, which could\neither be CP-even or -odd. Firstly, by benchmarking this theory construct\nagainst the results obtained by the Planck spacecraft, we extract the portions\nof the BLSSM parameter space compliant with relic density data. Secondly, we\nshow that, based on current sensitivities of the Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(FermiLAT) and their future projections, the study of high-energy $\\gamma$-ray\nspectra will eventually enable us to extract evidence of this DM candidate\nthrough its annihilations into $W^+W^-$ pairs (in turn emitting photons), in\nthe form of both an integrated flux and a differential energy spectrum which\ncannot be reconciled with the assumption of DM being fermionic (like, e.g., a\nneutralino), although it should not be possible to distinguish between the\nscalar and pseudoscalar hypotheses. Thirdly, we show that, while underground\ndirect detection experiments will have little scope in testing sneutrino DM,\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may be able to do so in a variety of\nmulti-lepton signatures, with and without accompanying jets (plus missing\ntransverse energy), following data collection during Run 2 and 3.\n", "  Purpose: Experimental measurements of bone mineral density distributions\n(BMDDs) enable a determination of secondary mineralisation kinetics in bone,\nbut the maximum degree of mineralisation and how this maximum is approached\nremain uncertain. We thus test computationally different hypotheses on late\nstages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions.\nMaterials and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that\naccounts for mineralisation and remodelling processes was extended to limit\nmineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities of bone. Simulated BMDDs\nobtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under\ndifferent assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with\nexperimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an\nabrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a\npile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally.\nWith a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium\ncapacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover\nBMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a\ndistinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover rate and maximum\ncalcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental\nBMDDs between trabecular bone (high turnover) and femoral cortical bone (low\nturnover). Conclusions: Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop\nabruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium content greater than 30 wt% Ca.\nThe similar mineral heterogeneity seen in trabecular and femoral cortical bones\nat different peak locations was unexplained by turnover differences tested.\n", "  Based on a theory of extra dimensional confinement of quantum particles [E.\nR. Hedin, Physics Essays 25, 2 (2012)], a simple model of a nucleon-nucleon\n(NN) central potential is derived which quantitatively reproduces the radial\nprofile of other models, without adjusting any free parameters. It is\npostulated that a higher-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator confining\npotential localizes particles into 3d space, but allows for an evanescent\npenetration of the particles into two higher spatial dimensions. Producing an\neffect identical with the relativistic quantum phenomenon of zitterbewegung,\nthe higher-dimensional oscillations of amplitude h/(2{\\pi}mc) can be\nalternatively viewed as a localized curvature of 3d space back and forth into\nthe higher dimensions. The overall spatial curvature is proportional to the\nparticle`s extra dimensional ground state wave function in the higher\ndimensional harmonic confining potential well. Minimizing the overlapping\ncurvature (proportional to the energy) of two particles in proximity to each\nother, subject to the constraint that for the two particles to occupy the same\nspatial location one of them must be excited into the first excited state of\nthe harmonic potential well, gives the desired NN potential. Specifying only\nthe nucleon masses, the resulting potential well and repulsive core reproduces\nthe radial profile of several published NN central potential models. In\naddition, the predicted height of the repulsive core, when used to estimate the\nmaximum neutron star mass, matches well with the best estimates from\nrelativistic theory incorporating standard nuclear matter equations of state.\nNucleon spin, Coulomb interactions, and internal nucleon structure are not\nconsidered in the theory as presented in this article.\n", "  We provide general arguments regarding the connection between low-energy\ntheories (gravity and quantum field theory) and a hypothetical fundamental\ntheory of quantum gravity, under the assumptions of (i) validity of the\nholographic bound and (ii) preservation of unitary evolution at the level of\nthe fundamental theory. In particular, the appeal to the holographic bound\nimposed on generic physical systems by the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy implies\nthat both classical geometry and quantum fields propagating on it should be\nregarded as phenomena emergent from the dynamics of the fundamental theory. The\nreshuffling of the fundamental degrees of freedom during the unitary evolution\nthen leads to an entanglement between geometry and quantum fields. The\nconsequences of such scenario are considered in the context of black hole\nevaporation and the related information-loss issue: we provide a simplistic toy\nmodel in which an average loss of information is obtained as a consequence of\nthe geometry-field entanglement.\n", "  A review on current observations of high-mass star formation is given, with a\nlittle bit of theoretical background. Particular emphasis is given to the, in\nmy opinion, most important observations to put strong constraints on models of\nhigh-mass star formation: the existence and properties of high-mass starless\ncores, the existence or not of isolated high-mass stars, the possible support\nmechanisms of starless cores, the role of filaments in the mass transport to\nhigh-mass cores, ways of characterizing cores, the binary properties, and the\nproperties of disks around high-mass stars.\n", "  Large quantum simulators, with sufficiently many qubits to be impossible to\nsimulate classically, become hard to experimentally validate. We propose two\ntests of a quantum simulator with Heisenberg interaction in a linear chain of\nspins. In the first, we propagate half of a singlet state through a chain of\nspin with a ferromagnetic interaction and subsequently recover the state with\nan antiferromagnetic interaction. The antiferromagnetic interaction is\nintrinsic to the system while the ferromagnetic one can be simulated by a\nsequence of time-dependent controls of the antiferromagnetic interaction and\nSuzuki-Trotter approximations. In the second test, we use the same technique to\ntransfer a spin singlet state from one end of a spin chain to the other. We\nshow that the tests are robust against parametric errors in operation of the\nsimulator and may be applicable even without error correction.\n", "  We present a terahertz (THz) frequency-domain spectroscopic (FDS)\nellipsometer design which suppresses formation of standing waves by use of\nstealth technology approaches. The strategy to suppress standing waves consists\nof three elements \\textit{geometry}, \\textit{coating} and \\textit{modulation}.\nThe instrument is based on the rotating analyzer ellipsometer principle and can\nincorporate various sample compartments, such as a superconducting magnet,\n\\textit{in-situ} gas cells or resonant sample cavities, for example. A backward\nwave oscillator and three detectors are employed, which permit operation in the\nspectral range of 0.1--1~THz (3.3--33~cm$^{-1}$ or 0.4--4~meV). The THz\nfrequency-domain ellipsometer allows for standard and generalized ellipsometry\nat variable angles of incidence in both reflection and transmission\nconfigurations. The methods used to suppress standing waves and strategies for\nan accurate frequency calibration are presented. Experimental results from\ndielectric constant determination in anisotropic materials, and free charge\ncarrier determination in optical Hall effect, resonant-cavity enhanced optical\nHall effect and \\textit{in-situ} optical Hall effect experiments are discussed.\nExamples include silicon and sapphire optical constants, free charge carrier\nproperties of two dimensional electron gas in group-III nitride high electron\nmobility transistor structure, and ambient effects on free electron mobility\nand density in epitaxial graphene.\n", "  We demonstrate that a large class of first-order quantum phase transitions\ncan be described as a condensation in the space of states. Given a system\nhaving Hamiltonian $H=K+gV$, where $K$ and $V$ are hopping and potential\noperators acting on the space of states $\\mathbb{F}$, we may always write\n$\\mathbb{F}=\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond} \\oplus \\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{norm}$ where\n$\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}$ is the subspace which spans the eigenstates of $V$\nwith minimal eigenvalue and\n$\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{norm}=\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}^\\perp$. If, in the\nthermodynamic limit, $M_\\mathrm{cond}/M \\to 0$, where $M$ and $M_\\mathrm{cond}$\nare, respectively, the dimensions of $\\mathbb{F}$ and\n$\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}$, the above decomposition of $\\mathbb{F}$ becomes\neffective, in the sense that the ground state energy per particle of the\nsystem, $\\epsilon$, coincides with the smaller between $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{cond}$\nand $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{norm}$, the ground state energies per particle of the\nsystem restricted to the subspaces $\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}$ and\n$\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{norm}$, respectively. It may then happen that, as a\nfunction of the parameter $g$, the energies $\\epsilon_\\mathrm{cond}$ and\n$\\epsilon_\\mathrm{norm}$ cross at $g=g_\\mathrm{c}$. In this case, a first-order\nquantum phase transition takes place between a condensed phase (system\nrestricted to the small subspace $\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}$) and a normal phase\n(system spread over the large subspace $\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{norm}$). Since, in\nthe thermodynamic limit, $M_\\mathrm{cond}/M \\to 0$, the confinement into\n$\\mathbb{F}_\\mathrm{cond}$ is actually a condensation in which the system falls\ninto a ground state orthogonal to that of the normal phase, something\nreminiscent of Andersons' orthogonality catastrophe. The outlined mechanism is\ntested on a variety of benchmark lattice models.\n", "  We present a novel reconstruction algorithm based on a general cone-beam CT\nforward model which is capable of incorporating the blur and noise correlations\nthat are exhibited in flat-panel CBCT measurement data. Specifically, the\nproposed model may include scintillator blur, focal-spot blur, and noise\ncorrelations due to light spread in the scintillator. The proposed algorithm\n(GPL-BC) uses a Gaussian Penalized-Likelihood objective function which\nincorporates models of Blur and Correlated noise. In a simulation study, GPL-BC\nwas able to achieve lower bias as compared to deblurring followed by FDK as\nwell as a model-based reconstruction method without integration of measurement\nblur. In the same study, GPL-BC was able to achieve better line-pair\nreconstructions (in terms of segmented-image accuracy) as compared to\ndeblurring followed by FDK, a model based method without blur, and a model\nbased method with blur but not noise correlations. A prototype extremities\nquantitative cone-beam CT test bench was used to image a physical sample of\nhuman trabecular bone. These data were used to compare reconstructions using\nthe proposed method and model based methods without blur and/or correlation to\na registered {\\mu}CT image of the same bone sample. The GPL-BC reconstructions\nresulted in more accurate trabecular bone segmentation. Multiple trabecular\nbone metrics, including Trabecular Thickness (Tb.Th.) were computed for each\nreconstruction approach as well as the {\\mu}CT volume. The GPL-BC\nreconstruction provided the most accurate Tb.Th. measurement, 0.255 mm, as\ncompared to the {\\mu}CT derived value of 0.193 mm, followed by the GPL-B\nreconstruction, the GPL-I reconstruction, and then the FDK reconstruction\n(0.271 mm, 0.309 mm, and 0.335 mm, respectively).\n", "  The energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the form of radiation,\nwinds, or radio plasma jets, is known to impact on the surrounding interstellar\nmedium. The result of these processes, known as AGN (negative) feedback, is\nsuggested to prevent gas, in and around galaxies, from cooling, and to remove,\nor at least redistribute, gas by driving massive and fast outflows, hence\nplaying a key role in galaxy evolution. Given its importance, a large effort is\ndevoted by the astronomical community to trace the effects of AGN on the\nsurrounding gaseous medium and to quantify their impact for different types of\nAGN. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent observational results\nobtained in different wavebands, tracing different phases of the gas. I also\nsummarize the new insights they have brought, and the constraints they provide\nto numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. The recent addition\nof deep observations of cold gas and, in particular, of cold molecular gas, has\nbrought some interesting surprises and has expanded our understanding of AGN\nand AGN feedback.\n", "  Materials that exhibit a low work function and therefore easily emit\nelectrons into vacuum form the basis of electronic devices used in applications\nranging from satellite communications to thermionic energy conversion. W-Ba-O\nis the canonical materials system that functions as the thermionic electron\nemitter used commercially in a range of high power electron devices. However,\nthe work functions, surface stability, and kinetic characteristics of a\npolycrystalline W emitter surface are still not well understood or\ncharacterized. In this study, we examined the work function and surface\nstability of the eight lowest index surfaces of the W-Ba-O system using Density\nFunctional Theory methods. We found that under the typical thermionic cathode\noperating conditions of high temperature and low oxygen partial pressure, the\nmost stable surface adsorbates are Ba-O species with compositions in the range\nof Ba0.125O to Ba0.25O per surface W atom, with O passivating all dangling W\nbonds and Ba creating work function-lowering surface dipoles. Wulff\nconstruction analysis reveals that the presence of O and Ba significantly\nalters the surface energetics and changes the proportions of surface facets\npresent under equilibrium conditions. Analysis of previously published data on\nW sintering kinetics suggests that fine W particles in the size range of\n100-500 nm may be at or near equilibrium during cathode synthesis, and thus may\nexhibit surface orientation fractions well-described by the calculated Wulff\nconstruction.\n", "  LiSr was produced in a heat-pipe oven and its thermal emission spectrum\naround 9300 cm$^{-1}$ was recorded by a high resolution Fourier transform\nspectrometer. In addition, selected lines of the spectrum of deeply bound\nvibrational levels of the $1^2\\Sigma^+$ and $2^2\\Sigma^+$ states were studied\nusing laser excitation to facilitate the assignment of the lines. The ground\nstate could be described for $v^{\\prime\\prime} =$ 0 - 2, $N^{\\prime\\prime}$ up\nto 105 and the $2^2\\Sigma^+$ state for $v^{\\prime} = 0$ up to $N^\\prime = 68$.\nFor both states, Dunham coefficients, spin-rotation parameters and potential\nenergy curves were evaluated. A coupling of the $2^2\\Sigma^+$ state to the\n$1^2\\Pi$ state was observed, allowing a local description with Dunham\ncoefficients of the $1^2\\Pi$ state and an approximate evaluation of the\ncoupling strength.\n", "  Recent Developments in computing very specific helicity amplitudes in two\nloop QCD are presented. The techniques focus upon the singular structure of the\namplitude rather than on a diagramatic and integration approach\n", "  Linear chains of about 10-13 carbon atoms were predicted to be the most\nfavorable phase on different metal surfaces prior to graphene nucleation.\nHowever, unlike the graphene that widely studied both theoretically and\nexperimentally, carbon chains on metal surfaces were not directly studied by\nSTM yet. Here we fill in the gap and report on STM experiments of linear carbon\nchains synthesized on Ni(111) through on-surface coupling of dehydrogenated\npropene molecules. Identification of chains was supported with DFT calculations\nand the proposed models consist of 12 carbon atoms, possibly covered by\nhydrogen atoms. Heating to 580 K leads to dramatic decrease of carbon chains\nand new phase appearance - graphene nucleus coexisted with nickel carbide.\nAfter flash annealing to 773 K (temperature of graphene synthesis), a small\nnumber of chains were presented on the Ni(111) surface, together with graphene\nislands and nickel carbide. The carbon chains are stable at room temperature\nand their mobility was directly observed by STM.\n", "  This work deals with form factors of the energy-momentum tensor (EMT) of\nspin-0 particles and the unknown particle property D-term related to the EMT,\nand is divided into three parts.\n  The first part explores free, weakly and strongly interacting theories to\nstudy EMT form factors with the following findings. (i) The free Klein-Gordon\ntheory predicts for the D-term D = -1. (ii) Even infinitesimally small\ninteractions can drastically impact D. (iii) In strongly interacting theories\none can encounter large negative D though notable exceptions exist, which\nincludes Goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry breaking. (iv) Contrary to common\nbelief one cannot arbitrarily add \"total derivatives\" to the EMT. Rather the\nEMT must be defined in an unambiguous way.\n  The second part deals with the interpretation of EMT form factors in terms of\n3D-densities with following results. (i) The 3D-density formalism is internally\nconsistent. (ii) The description is subject to relativistic corrections which\nare acceptably small in phenomenologically relevant situations including\nnucleon and nuclei. (iii) The free field result D=-1 persists when a spin-0\nboson is not point-like but \"heuristically given some internal structure.\"\n  The third part investigates the question, whether such \"giving of an extended\nstructure\" can be implemented dynamically, and has the following insights. (i)\nWe construct a consistent microscopic theory which, in a certain parametric\nlimit, interpolates between extended and point-like solutions. (ii) This theory\nis exactly solvable which is rare in 3+1 dimensions, admits non-topological\nsolitons of Q-ball-type, and has a Gaussian field amplitude. (iii) The\ninteraction of this theory belongs to a class of logarithmic potentials which\nwere discussed in literature, albeit in different contexts including beyond\nstandard model phenomenology, cosmology, and Higgs physics.\n", "  KCa was produced in a heatpipe oven and its thermal emission spectrum around\n8900 cm$^{-1}$ was recorded by a high resolution Fourier transform\nspectrometer. In addition, many selected transitions of this spectrum between\ndeeply bound vibrational levels of the $\\mathrm{X}(1)^2\\Sigma^+$ and\n$(2)^2\\Sigma^+$ states were studied using laser excitation to facilitate the\nassignment of the lines. The ground state is described for $v^{\\prime\\prime} =$\n0 - 5 and the $(2)^2\\Sigma^+$ state for $v^{\\prime} =0$ - 8 with rotational\nlevels up to 175. For both states, Dunham coefficients, spin-rotation\nparameters and potential energy curves are derived.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the clogging and jamming of interacting\nparamagnetic colloids driven through a quenched disordered landscape of fixed\nobstacles. When the particles are forced to cross a single aperture between two\nobstacles, we find an intermittent dynamics characterized by an exponential\ndistribution of burst size. At the collective level, we observe that quenched\ndisorder decreases the particle ow, but it also greatly enhances the \"faster is\nslower\" effect, that occurs when increasing the particle speed. Further, we\nshow that clogging events may be controlled by tuning the pair interactions\nbetween the particles during transport, such that the colloidal ow decreases\nfor repulsive interactions, but increases for anisotropic attraction. We\nprovide an experimental test-bed to investigate the crucial role of disorder on\nclogging and jamming in driven microscale matter.\n", "  Range separated hybrid density functionals are very successful in describing\na wide range of molecular and solid state properties accurately. Range\nseparated hybrid functionals are designed from spherically averaged or system\naveraged reversed engineered exchange hole. In the present attempt, we employ\nscreened range separated hybrid functional scheme to the meta-GGA rung by using\nTao-Mo semilocal exchange hole (or functional). The hybrid functional proposed\nhere utilizes the spherically averaged density matrix expansion based exchange\nhole in range separation scheme. For slowly varying density correction, we\nemploy range separation scheme only through the local density approximation\n(LDA) based exchange hole coupled with the slowly varying Tao-Mo enhancement\nfactor through the conventional wisdom technique. Comprehensive performance and\ntesting of the present functional shows, it accurately describes several\nmolecular properties. The most appealing feature of this present screened\nhybrid functional is that it will be practically very useful in describing\nsolid state properties in meta-GGA level.\n", "  Reference system approach of non-relativistic electron fluid theory was\nadapted for calculation of characteristics of the electron-nuclear model at the\ndensities typical of degenerate dwarfs. Two- and three correlation functions of\ndegenerate relativistic electron gas have been calculated in the\nmomentum-frequency representation in the local field approximation. Main\ncontributions of the Coulomb interactions to the energy and equation of state\nof the model at $T=0$ K have been calculated in the adiabatic approximation.\n", "  Peculiarities of interparticle interactions between methanol molecules in the\nmethanol vapor are investigated. The bare potential is considered as a sum of\nrepulsive, dispersive and electrostatic forces. It is supposed that H-bond is\nof electrostatic nature (the irreducible contribution caused by overlapping of\nelectronic shells is unessential). The dispersive interaction is approximated\nwith London's formula, the electrostatic interaction is modelled by a multipole\nexpansion up to dipole-octupole contribution. The multipole moments are assumed\nto be equal to their experimental values or to quantum chemical calculations.\nThe repulsion is modelled by power potential, whose parameters are fitted to\nthe second virial coefficient and to the parameters of dimers. Along with the\nbare potential, the averaged potential of interparticle interaction is\nanalyzed. It is shown that the repulsive potential has an exponent $n=28$. The\nmultipole potential, presented in this paper, is scrupulously compared with the\npotential known as the OPLS.\n", "  The scaled particle theory is developed for the description of\nthermodynamical properties of a mixture of hard spheres and hard\nspherocylinders. Analytical expressions for free energy, pressure and chemical\npotentials are derived. From the minimization of free energy, a nonlinear\nintegral equation for the orientational singlet distribution function is\nformulated. An isotropic-nematic phase transition in this mixture is\ninvestigated from the bifurcation analysis of this equation. It is shown that\nwith an increase of concentration of hard spheres, the total packing fraction\nof a mixture on phase boundaries slightly increases. The obtained results are\ncompared with computer simulations data.\n", "  Despite recent progress, laminar-turbulent coexistence in transitional planar\nwall-bounded shear flows is still not well understood. Contrasting with the\nprocesses by which chaotic flow inside turbulent patches is sustained at the\nlocal (minimal flow unit) scale, the mechanisms controlling the obliqueness of\nlaminar-turbulent interfaces typically observed all along the coexistence range\nare still mysterious. An extension of Waleffe's approach [Phys. Fluids 9 (1997)\n883--900] is used to show that, already at the local scale, drift flows\nbreaking the problem's spanwise symmetry are generated just by slightly\ndetuning the modes involved in the self-sustainment process. This opens\nperspectives for theorizing the formation of laminar-turbulent patterns.\n", "  In their \"How proper are Bayesian models in the astronomical literature?\"\n[arXiv:1712.03549], Hyungsuk Tak, Sujit K. Ghosh and Justin A. Ellis criticised\nmy work with false statements. This is an infamous case of straw man fallacy.\nThey give the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while they refute\nan argument that was not presented.\n", "  Using the self-consistent field approach, the effect of asymmetry of the coil\nblock on the microphase separation is focused in ABC coil-rod-coil triblock\ncopolymers. For different fractions of the rod block $f_{\\text B}$, some stable\nstructures are observed, i.e., lamellae, cylinders, gyroid, and core-shell\nhexagonal lattice, and the phase diagrams are constructed. The calculated\nresults show that the effect of the coil block fraction $f_{\\text A}$ is\ndependent on $f_{\\text B}$. When $f_{\\text B}=0.2$, the effect of asymmetry of\nthe coil block is similar to that of the ABC flexible triblock copolymers; When\n$f_{\\text B}=0.4$, the self-assembly of ABC coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers\nbehaves like rod-coil diblock copolymers under some condition. When $f_{\\text\nB}$ continues to increase, the effect of asymmetry of the coil block reduces.\nFor $f_{\\text B}=0.4$, under the symmetrical and rather asymmetrical\nconditions, an increase in the interaction parameter between different\ncomponents leads to different transitions between cylinders and lamellae. The\nresults indicate some remarkable effect of the chain architecture on\nself-assembly, and can provide the guidance for the design and synthesis of\ncopolymer materials.\n", "  Nonlinear ion-acoustic waves are analyzed in a non-relativistic magnetized\nquantum plasma with arbitrary degeneracy of electrons. Quantum statistics is\ntaken into account by means of the equation of state for ideal fermions at\narbitrary temperature. Quantum diffraction is described by a modified Bohm\npotential consistent with finite temperature quantum kinetic theory in the long\nwavelength limit. The dispersion relation of the obliquely propagating\nelectrostatic waves in magnetized quantum plasma with arbitrary degeneracy of\nelectrons is obtained. Using the reductive perturbation method, the\ncorresponding Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation is derived, describing obliquely\npropagating two-dimensional ion-acoustic solitons in a magnetized quantum\nplasma with degenerate electrons having arbitrary electron temperature. It is\nfound that in the dilute plasma case only electrostatic potential hump\nstructures are possible, while in dense quantum plasma in principle both hump\nand dip soliton structures are obtainable, depending on the electron plasma\ndensity and its temperature. The results are validated by comparison with the\nquantum hydrodynamic model including electron inertia and magnetization\neffects. Suitable physical parameters for observations are identified.\n", "  Isothermal-isobaric molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to\nexamine an ample set of properties of the model water-N,N-dimethylformamide\n(DMF) mixture as a function of composition. The SPC-E and TIP4P-Ew water models\ntogether with two united atom models for DMF [Chalaris M., Samios J., J. Chem.\nPhys., 2000, 112, 8581; Cordeiro J., Int. J. Quantum Chem., 1997, 65, 709] were\nused. Our principal analyses concern the behaviour of structural properties in\nterms of radial distribution functions, and the number of hydrogen bonds\nbetween molecules of different species as well as thermodynamic properties.\nNamely, we explore the density, excess mixing molar volume and enthalpy, the\nheat capacity and excess mixing heat capacity. Finally, the self-diffusion\ncoefficients of species and the dielectric constant of the system are\ndiscussed. In addition, surface tension of water-DMF mixtures has been\ncalculated and analyzed.\n", "  We numerically investigate the effects of disorder on the quantum Hall effect\n(QHE) and the quantum phase transitions in silicene based on a lattice model.\nIt is shown that for a clean sample, silicene exhibits an unconventional QHE\nnear the band center, with plateaus developing at $\\nu=0,\\pm2,\\pm6,\\ldots,$ and\na conventional QHE near the band edges. In the presence of disorder, the Hall\nplateaus can be destroyed through the float-up of extended levels toward the\nband center, in which higher plateaus disappear first. However, the center\n$\\nu=0$ Hall plateau is more sensitive to disorder and disappears at a\nrelatively weak disorder strength. Moreover, the combination of an electric\nfield and the intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) can lead to quantum phase\ntransitions from a topological insulator to a band insulator at the charge\nneutrality point (CNP), accompanied by additional quantum Hall conductivity\nplateaus.\n", "  We assume that the mass of the heavy standard particles ($Z,W,t,...$) arises\nfrom a special coupling with dark matter and that this implies a corresponding\npeculiar connection of these particles to the dark sector. We give examples of\npossible tests of this assumption in $e^+e^-\\to Z+X,~ W^+W^-+X, ~t\\bar t+X$ and\nwe mention other possible studies.\n", "  Magnetoresistance as a tool of basic parameters determination of minority\ncharge carriers and the ratio of minority charge carriers conductivity to\nmajority ones in solid matter has been considered within the framework of the\nphenomenological two-band model. The criterion of the application of this model\nhas been found. As examples of these equations usage the conductor,\nsemiconductor and superconductor have been introduced. From the obtained\ntemperature dependences of the aforementioned values in superconductor, a\nsupposition of a deciding role of minority charge carriers in the emergence of\nsuperconductivity state has been made.\n", "  (abridged) This study revolves around dmB, a new distance- and\nextinction-independent measure of the contribution by stellar populations older\nthan 9 Gyr to the mean r-band surface brightness of the bulge component in 135\nlate-type galaxies (LTGs) from the CALIFA survey, spanning a range of 2.6 dex\nand 3 dex in total and bulge stellar mass (M*T~10^(8.9-11.5) M_solar and\nM*B~10^(8.3-11.3) M_solar, respectively). The main insight from this study is\nthat LTG bulges form a continuous sequence of increasing dmB with increasing\nM*T, M*B, stellar mass surface density S* and mass-weighted age and\nmetallicity: high-dmB bulges are the oldest, densest and most massive ones, and\nvice versa. Furthermore, we find that the bulge-to-disk age and metallicity\ncontrast, as well as the bulge-to-disk mass ratio increase with M*T, raising\nfrom, respectively, ~0 Gyr, 0 dex and 0.25 to ~3 Gyr, ~0.3 dex and 0.67 across\nthe mass range covered by our sample. Whereas gas excitation in lower-mass\nbulges is invariably dominated by star formation (SF), LINER- and\nSeyfert-specific emission-line ratios were exclusively documented in high-mass,\nhigh-S* bulges. The continuity both in the properties of LTG bulges themselves\nand in their age and metallicity contrast to their parent disks suggests that\nthese components evolve alongside in a concurrent process that leads to a\ncontinuum of physical and evolutionary characteristics. Our results are\nconsistent with a picture where bulge growth in LTGs is driven by a\nsuperposition of quick-early and slow-secular processes, the relative\nimportance of which increases with M*T. These processes, which presumably\ncombine in situ SF in the bulge and inward migration of material from the disk,\nare expected to lead to a non-homologous radial growth of S* and a trend for an\nincreasing Sersic index with increasing galaxy mass.\n", "  A method is proposed for determining the temperature of hot electrons in a\nmetallic nanoparticle embedded in a dielectric matrix under ultrashort laser\npulses irradiation. The amplitude and power of the longitudinal spherical\nacoustic oscillations as functions of density and elastic properties of the\nmedium, the laser pulse duration, the electron temperature, radii of particles,\nand the electron-phonon coupling constant are obtained. The efficiency of the\nelectron energy transfer from heated noble nanoparticles to a surrounding\nenvironment is estimated for different electron temperatures.\n", "  A spherical quantum dot (QD) heterosystem CdS/SiO$_2$ has been studied. Each\nQD has a hydrogen-like impurity in its center. Besides that, it has been\naccounted that a polarization trap for electron exists at the interfaces due to\nthe difference between the QD and matrix dielectric permittivity. It has been\ndefined that for small QD radii there are surface electron states. For\ndifferent radii, partial contributions of the surface states into the electron\nenergy caused by the electron-ion and electron-polarization charges interaction\nhave been defined. The linear light absorption coefficient of noninteracting\nQDs has been calculated taking into account the QD dispersion by the size. It\nis shown that the surface states can be observed into different ranges of an\nelectromagnetic spectrum.\n", "  The theory of renormalized energy spectrum of localized quasi-particle\ninteracting with polarization phonons at finite temperature is developed within\nthe Feynman-Pines diagram technique. The created computer program effectively\ntakes into account multi-phonon processes, exactly defining all diagrams of\nmass operator together with their analytical expressions in arbitrary order\nover the coupling constant. Now it is possible to separate the pole and\nnon-pole mass operator terms and perform a partial summing of their main terms.\nThe renormalized spectrum of the system is obtained within the solution of\ndispersion equation in the vicinity of the main state where the high- and\nlow-energy complexes of bound states are observed. The properties of the\nspectrum are analyzed depending on the coupling constant and the temperature.\n", "  The model of NH$_3$CH$_2$COOH$\\cdot$H$_2$PO$_3$, modified by taking into\naccount the piezoelectric coupling between the ordering structure elements and\nthe strains $\\varepsilon_i$, $\\varepsilon_j$, is used for investigation of the\neffects that appear under external pressures. Within two-particle cluster\napproximation, the components of polarization vector and static dielectric\npermittivity tensor of the mechanically clamped and free crystals, their\npiezoelectric and thermal characteristics are calculated. The effect of\nhydrostatic pressure on the phase transition and the calculated physical\ncharacteristics of the crystal is studied. A good quantitative description of\nexperimental data for these crystals is obtained.\n", "  In this letter, we describe the stabilization of indium antimonide (InSb) in\nthe high-pressure orthorhombic phase (InSb-III) at ambient conditions. Until\nnow, InSb-III has only been observed above 9 GPa, or at around 3 GPa as a\nmetastable structure during the phase transition from cubic zinc blende\n(InSb-I) to orthorhombic InSb-IV. The crystalline phase transition from InSb-I\nto InSb-III was driven by an ultrashort, laser-generated, non-hydrostatic\npressure pulse. The transition occurred in preferred orientations locked to the\ninitial orientation of the InSb-I crystal, breaking the symmetry of the InSb-I\ncubic cell to form the InSb-III orthorhombic cell.\n", "  The electronic properties of TiO$_2$ nanostructure are explored using density\nfunctional theory. The adsorption properties of acetone on TiO$_2$\nnanostructure are studied in terms of adsorption energy, average energy gap\nvariation and Mulliken charge transfer. The density of states spectrum and the\nband structure clearly reveals the adsorption of acetone on TiO$_2$\nnanostructures. The variation in the energy gap and changes in the density of\ncharge are observed upon adsorption of acetone on n-type TiO$_2$ base material.\nThe results of DOS spectrum reveal that the transfer of electrons takes place\nbetween acetone vapor and TiO$_2$ base material. The findings show that the\nadsorption property of acetone is more favorable on TiO$_2$ nanostructure.\nSuitable adsorption sites of acetone on TiO$_2$ nanostructure are identified at\natomistic level. From the results, it is confirmed that TiO$_2$ nanostructure\ncan be efficiently utilized as a sensing element for the detection of acetone\nvapor in a mixed environment.\n", "  An approximate analytical solution to the fluctuation potential problem in\nthe modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory of electrolyte solutions in the\nrestricted primitive model is presented. The solution is valid for all\ninter-ionic distances, including contact values. The fluctuation potential\nsolution is implemented in the theory to describe the structure of the\nelectrolyte in terms of the radial distribution functions, and to calculate\nsome aspects of thermodynamics, viz., configurational reduced energies, and\nosmotic coefficients. The calculations have been made for symmetric valence 1:1\nsystems at the physical parameters of ionic diameter $4.25 \\times 10^{-10}$ m,\nrelative permittivity 78.5, absolute temperature 298 K, and molar\nconcentrations 0.1038, 0.425, 1.00, and 1.968. Radial distribution functions\nare compared with the corresponding results from the symmetric\nPoisson-Boltzmann, and the conventional and modified Poisson-Boltzmann\ntheories. Comparisons have also been done for the contact values of the radial\ndistributions, reduced configurational energies, and osmotic coefficients as\nfunctions of electrolyte concentration. Some Monte Carlo simulation data from\nthe literature are also included in the assessment of the thermodynamic\npredictions. Results show a very good agreement with the Monte Carlo results\nand some improvement for osmotic coefficients and radial distribution functions\ncontact values relative to these theories. The reduced energy curve shows\nexcellent agreement with Monte Carlo data for molarities up to 1 mol/dm$^{3}$.\n", "  Two non-harmonic canonical-dissipative limit cycle oscillators are considered\nthat oscillate in one-dimensional Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials. It is\nshown that the standard approach of the canonical-dissipative framework to\nintroduce dissipative forces leads naturally to a coupling force between the\noscillators that establishes synchronization. The non-harmonic character of the\nlimit cycles in the context of anchoring, the phase difference between the\nsynchronized oscillators, and the degree of synchronization are studied in\ndetail.\n", "  This paper considers the potential impact that the nascent technology of\nquantum computing may have on society. It focuses on three areas: cryptography,\noptimization, and simulation of quantum systems. We will also discuss some\nethical aspects of these developments, and ways to mitigate the risks.\n", "  The study of cataclysmic variable stars has long been a fruitful area of\nco-operation between amateur and professional astronomers. In this Presidential\nAddress, I shall take stock of our current understanding of these fascinating\nbinary systems, highlighting where amateurs can still contribute to pushing\nback the frontiers of knowledge. I shall also consider the sky surveys that are\nalready coming on stream, which will provide near continuous and exquisitely\nprecise photometry of these systems. I show that whilst these surveys might be\nperceived as a threat to amateur observations, they will actually provide new\nopportunities, although the amateur community shall need to adapt and focus its\nefforts. I will identify areas where amateurs equipped for either visual\nobserving or CCD photometry can make scientifically useful observations.\n", "  The BAA Variable Star Section is the world's longest established organisation\nfor the systematic observation of variable stars, having been formed in 1890.\nIts database contains nearly 3 million measurements going back to 1840 and is\nan important resource for researchers. The aim of this Presidential Address is\nto reveal some of the lesser known tales that lie deep within the database.\nThis includes bringing to life stories about some of the people that were\ninvolved, especially in the early years, including Joseph Baxendell, Mary Adela\nBlagg and Arthur Stanley Williams, as well as shedding light on some of the\nstars that have been observed. Finally we look to the future as the Variable\nStar Section builds on the legacy of its forebears, ensuring that it shall\nalways stay ahead of the curve.\n", "  We introduce swordfish, a Monte-Carlo-free Python package to predict expected\nexclusion limits, the discovery reach and expected confidence contours for a\nlarge class of experiments relevant for particle- and astrophysics. The tool is\napplicable to any counting experiment, supports general correlated background\nuncertainties, and gives exact results in both the signal- and\nsystematics-limited regimes. Instead of time-intensive Monte Carlo simulations\nand likelihood maximization, it internally utilizes new approximation methods\nthat are built on information geometry. Out of the box, swordfish provides\nstraightforward methods for accurately deriving many of the common sensitivity\nmeasures. In addition, it allows one to examine experimental abilities in great\ndetail by employing the notion of information flux. This new concept\ngeneralizes signal-to-noise ratios to situations where background uncertainties\nand component mixing cannot be neglected. The user interface of swordfish is\ndesigned with ease-of-use in mind, which we demonstrate by providing typical\nexamples from indirect and direct dark matter searches as jupyter notebooks.\n"]}
