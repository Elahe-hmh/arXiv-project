the particle inertia against\nvelocity change has increased at higher velocity values. This increase has been\npredicted in principle in the framework of special theory of relativity.\nHowever, any comparison of the corresponding prediction with experimental data\nobtained already in the first half of the past century has not been provided\nuntil now.It will be shown in the presented paper that quite arbitrary inertia\nmass increase with velocity may be described also in the framework of the\nclassical physics on the basis of Hamilton's equations if the force law of\nNewton will be generalized; i.e., if time change of particle momentum (not\ndirectly acceleration) will be determined by corresponding force. More general\nvelocity-dependent formulas (containing some free parameters) for kinetic\nenergy, momentum and force will be then derived. It will be further shown that\nthis generalized Hamiltonian mechanics describing general mass increase with\nvelocity may be reduced to known result of classical physics of Newton if mass\nvalue is taken to be constant, and also that the result of special theory of\nrelativity may be derived if the given increasing function is taken as\npredicted in this theory.\n", "  Let g be a semi-simple Lie algebra. In this paper we study the spaces of\nbased quasi-maps from the projective line P^1 to the flag variety of g (it is\nwell-known that their singularities are supposed to model the singularities of\nthe so called semi-infinite Schubert varieties which are hard to define\ndirectly). In the first part of the paper we show that the above spaces are\nnormal and in the case when g is simply laced they are also Gorenstein and have\nrational singularities. In the second part of the paper we compute the\ncharacter of the ring of functions on the above spaces; in view of the above\nresults this computation can be thought of as a computation of the\n(equivariant) K-theoretic J-function of the flag variety of g. We show that\nwhen g is simply laced the above characters satisfy the \"fermionic recursion\"\nversion of the difference quantum Toda lattice (due to B.Feigin, E.Feigin,\nM.Jimbo, T.Miwa and E.Mukhin). As a byproduct we show that the equivariant\nK-theoretic J-function of the flag variety of a simply laced Lie algebra g is\nthe universal eigen-function of the difference quantum Toda lattice, thus\nproving a conjecture of Givental and Lee. Some modification of this result is\nalso shown to hold for non-simply laced g.\n  We also discuss an extension of the above results to the case when g is an\naffine Lie algebra (this extension is conjectural except when g=sl(N)).\n", "  The notion of singular reduction modules, i.e., of singular modules of\nnonclassical (conditional) symmetry, of differential equations is introduced.\nIt is shown that the derivation of nonclassical symmetries for differential\nequations can be improved by an in-depth prior study of the associated singular\nmodules of vector fields. The form of differential functions and differential\nequations possessing parameterized families of singular modules is described up\nto point transformations. Singular cases of finding reduction modules are\nrelated to lowering the order of the corresponding reduced equations. As\nexamples, singular reduction modules of evolution equations and second-order\nquasi-linear equations are studied. Reductions of differential equations to\nalgebraic equations and to first-order ordinary differential equations are\nconsidered in detail within the framework proposed and are related to previous\nno-go results on nonclassical symmetries.\n", "  We take the viewpoint that the physically acceptable solutions of the\nLorentz--Dirac equation for radiation back-reaction are actually determined by\na second order equation of motion, the self-force being given as a function of\nspacetime location and velocity. We propose three different methods to obtain\nthis self-force function. For two example systems, we determine the second\norder equation of motion exactly in the nonrelativistic regime via each of\nthese three methods, the three methods leading to the same result. We reveal\nthat, for both systems considered, back-reaction induces a damping proportional\nto velocity and, in addition, it decreases the effect of the external force.\n", "  Transient phenomena are interesting and potentially highly revealing of\ndetails about the processes under observation and study that could otherwise go\nunnoticed. It is therefore important to maximize the sensitivity of the method\nused to identify such events. In this article, we present a general procedure\nbased on the use of the likelihood function for identifying transients which is\nparticularly suited for real-time applications because it requires no grouping\nor pre-processing of the data. The method makes use of all the information that\nis available in the data throughout the statistical decision-making process,\nand is suitable for a wide range of applications. Here we consider those most\ncommon in astrophysics, which involve searching for transient sources, events\nor features in images, time series, energy spectra, and power spectra, and\ndemonstrate the use of the method in the case of a weak X-ray flare in a time\nseries and a short-lived quasi-periodic oscillation in a power spectrum. We\nderive a fit statistic that is ideal for fitting arbitrarily shaped models to a\npower density distribution, which is of general interest in all applications\ninvolving periodogram analysis.\n", "  Future weak lensing surveys potentially hold the highest statistical power\nfor constraining cosmological parameters compared to other cosmological probes.\nThe statistical power of a weak lensing survey is determined by the sky\ncoverage, the inverse of the noise in shear measurements, and the galaxy number\ndensity. The combination of the latter two factors is often expressed in terms\nof $n_{\\rm eff}$ -- the \"effective number density of galaxies used for weak\nlensing measurements\". In this work, we estimate $n_{\\rm eff}$ for the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project, the most powerful ground-based\nlensing survey planned for the next two decades. We investigate how the\nfollowing factors affect the resulting $n_{\\rm eff}$ of the survey with\ndetailed simulations: (1) survey time, (2) shear measurement algorithm, (3)\nalgorithm for combining multiple exposures, (4) inclusion of data from multiple\nfilter bands, (5) redshift distribution of the galaxies, and (6) masking and\nblending. For the first time, we quantify in a general weak lensing analysis\npipeline the sensitivity of $n_{\\rm eff}$ to the above factors.\n  We find that with current weak lensing algorithms, expected distributions of\nobserving parameters, and all lensing data ($r$- and $i$-band, covering 18,000\ndegree$^{2}$ of sky) for LSST, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx37$ arcmin$^{-2}$ before\nconsidering blending and masking, $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx31$ arcmin$^{-2}$ when\nrejecting seriously blended galaxies and $n_{\\rm eff} \\approx26$ arcmin$^{-2}$\nwhen considering an additional 15% loss of galaxies due to masking. With future\nimprovements in weak lensing algorithms, these values could be expected to\nincrease by up to 20%. Throughout the paper, we also stress the ways in which\n$n_{\\rm eff}$ depends on our ability to understand and control systematic\neffects in the measurements.\n", "  We describe a new type of hair on supersymmetric black string and black ring\nsolutions, which produces the largest known violation of black hole uniqueness,\nparameterized by an arbitrary function and hence an infinite number of\ncontinuous parameters. The new solutions can have non-trivial density profiles\nfor the electric fields along the horizon, and yet have a geometry that is\nregular, although generically not infinitely differentiable, at the horizon.\nBoth neutral and charged probes can cross the horizon without experiencing\ndivergent forces. We also find restricted examples, parameterized by a few\narbitrary continuous parameters, where the charge densities fluctuate but the\nmetric does not and hence is completely differentiable. Our new class of\nsolutions owes its existence to a mechanism reminiscent of the Q-ball: in the\nsimplest examples the metric has more symmetry than the matter that supports\nit.\n", "  We study what we call the all-loop anisotropic bosonized Thirring sigma\nmodel. This interpolates between the WZW model and the non-Abelian T-dual of\nthe principal chiral model for a simple group. It has an invariance involving\nthe inversion of the matrix parametrizing the coupling constants. We compute\nthe general renormalization group flow equations which assume a remarkably\nsimple form and derive its properties. For symmetric couplings, they\nconsistently truncate to previous results in the literature. One of the\nexamples we provide gives rise to a first order system of differential\nequations interpolating between the Lagrange and the Darboux-Halphen integrable\nsystems.\n", "  We are undertaking a detailed investigation, based on the available evidence,\nof the sequence of events that led to the historical discovery of the first\nQuasar 3C273.\n", "  We find the Euler-Lagrangian equation by maximising the total entropy. Hence\nwe obtain an expression for mass of the spherically symmetric system by solving\nthe Euler-Lagrangian equation where the Homotopy Perturbation Method has been\nemployed. With the help of this expression and the Einstein field equations we\nobtain an interior solution set. Thereafter, we explain different aspects of\nthe solution describing the system in connection to the mass, density,\npressures, energy, stability, mass-radius ratio, compactness factor and surface\nredshift. This analysis shows that all the physical properties, in connection\nto brown dwarf stars, are valid with the observed features.\n", "  Using superposition and numerical approximations of a published analytical\nexpression for the magnetic field generated by a finite solenoid, we show that\nthe magnetic field external to parallel identical solenoids can be nearly\nuniform and substantial, even when the solenoids have lengths that are large\ncompared to their radii. We study two arrangements of solenoids---a ring of\nparallel solenoids whose surfaces are tangent to a common cylindrical surface\nand to nearest neighbours, and a large finite hexagonal array of parallel\nsolenoids---and summarize how the magnitude and uniformity of the resultant\nexternal field depend on the solenoid length and distances between solenoids.\nWe also report some novel results about single solenoids, e.g., that the energy\nstored in the internal magnetic field exceeds the energy stored in the\nspatially infinite external magnetic field for even short solenoids. These\nresults should be broadly interesting to undergraduates learning about\nelectricity and magnetism as novel examples of superposition based on a\nfamiliar source of magnetic fields.\n", "  Above two dimensions, diffusion of a particle in a medium with quenched\nrandom traps is believed to be well-described by the annealed continuous time\nrandom walk (CTRW). We propose an approximate expression for the\nfirst-passage-time (FPT) distribution in a given sample that enables detailed\ncomparison of the two problems. For a system of finite size, the number and\nspatial arrangement of deep traps yield significant sample-to-sample variations\nin the FPT statistics. Numerical simulations of a quenched trap model with\npower-law sojourn times confirm the existence of two characteristic time scales\nand a non-self-averaging FPT distribution, as predicted by theory.\n", "  A recent theoretical prediction of a breaking of axial symmetry in quasi all\nheavy nuclei is confronted to a new critical analysis of photon strength\nfunctions of nuclei in the valley of stability. For the photon strength in the\nisovector giant dipole resonance (IVGDR) regime a parameterization of GDR\nshapes by the sum of three Lorentzians (TLO) is extrapolated to energies below\nand above the IVGDR. The impact of non-GDR modes adding to the low energy slope\nof photon strength is discussed including recent data on photon scattering and\nother radiative processes. These are shown to be concentrated in energy regions\nwhere various model calculations predict intermediate collective strength; thus\nthey are obviously separate from the IVGDR tail. The triple Lorentzian (TLO)\nansatz for giant dipole resonances is normalized in accordance to the dipole\nsum rule. The nuclear droplet model with surface dissipation accounts well for\npositions and widths without local, nuclide specific, parameters. Very few and\nonly global parameters are needed when a breaking of axial symmetry already in\nthe valley of stability is admitted and hence a reliable prediction for\nelectric dipole strength functions also outside of it is expected.\n", "  We consider Activated Random Walk (ARW), a model which generalizes the\nStochastic Sandpile, one of the canonical examples of self organized\ncriticality. Informally ARW is a particle system on $\\mathbb{Z}$ with mass\nconservation. One starts with a mass density $\\mu>0$ of initially active\nparticles, each of which performs a symmetric random walk at rate one and falls\nasleep at rate $\\lambda>0$. Sleepy particles become active on coming in contact\nwith other active particles. We investigate the question of\nfixation/non-fixation of the process, and show for small enough $\\lambda$, the\ncritical mass density for fixation is strictly less than one. Moreover, the\ncritical density goes to zero as $\\lambda$ tends to zero. This settles a long\nstanding open question.\n", "  The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) for N particles on a ring with\nL sites may be analyzed using the Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we provide a\nrigorous proof that the Bethe ansatz is complete for the periodic ASEP. More\nprecisely, we show that for all but finitely many values of the hopping rate,\nthe solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations do indeed yield all L choose N\neigenstates. The proof follows ideas of Langlands and Saint-Aubin, which draw\nupon a range of techniques from algebraic geometry, topology and enumerative\ncombinatorics.\n", "  In this study, we present some general features of gamma-ray spectra from\ndark matter. We find that the spectrum with sharp features could appear in a\nwide class of dark matter models and mimic the gamma line signals. If all other\nphysical degrees of freedom are heavy or effectively decoupled, the resulting\ngamma ray from dark matter decay or annihilation would generally have\npolynomial-type spectra or power-law with positive index. We illustrate our\nfindings in a model-independent framework with generic kinematic analysis.\nSimilar results can also apply for cosmic ray or neutrino cases.\n", "  We report the structural and magnetic characterization of La-substituted\nGd$_{1-x}$La$_x$RhIn$_5$ ($x\\leq$ 0.50) antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds. The\nmagnetic responses of pure GdRhIn$_5$ are well described by a $S=7/2$\nHeisenberg model. When Gd$^{3+}$ ions are substituted by La$^{3+}$, the maximum\nof the susceptibility and the inflection point of the magnetic specific heat\nare systematically shifted to lower temperatures accompanied by a broadening of\nthe transition. The data is qualitatively explained by a phenomenological model\nwhich incorporates a distribution of magnetic regions with different transition\ntemperatures ($T_N$). The universal behaviour of the low temperature specific\nheat is found for La (vacancies) concentrations below $x=0.40$ which is\nconsistent with spin wave excitations. For $x=0.5$ this universal behaviour is\nlost. The sharp second order transition of GdRhIn$_5$ is destroyed, as seen in\nthe specific heat data, contrary to what is expected for a Heisenberg model.\nThe results are discussed in the context of the magnetic behavior observed for\nthe La-substituted (Ce,Tb,Nd)RhIn$_5$ compounds.\n", "  Rocks are important examples for solid materials where, in various\nengineering situations, elastic, thermal expansion, rheological/viscoelastic\nand plastic phenomena each may play a remarkable role. Nonequilibrium continuum\nthermodynamics provides a consistent way to describe all these aspects in a\nunified framework. This we present here in a formulation where the kinematic\nquantities allow arbitrary nonzero initial (e.g., in situ) stresses and such\ninitial configurations which - as a consequence of thermal or remanent stresses\n- do not satisfy the kinematic compatibility condition. The various\ncharacteristic effects accounted by the obtained theory are illustrated via\nexperimental results where loaded solid samples undergo elastic, thermal\nexpansion and plastic deformation and exhibit rheological behaviour. From the\nexperimental data, the rheological coefficients are determined, and the\nmeasured temperature changes are also explained by the theory.\n", "  We study the emergence of Heisenberg (Bianchi II) algebra in hyper-K\\\"ahler\nand quaternionic spaces. This is motivated by the r\\^ole these spaces with this\nsymmetry play in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet scalar manifolds. We show how\nto construct related pairs of hyper-K\\\"ahler and quaternionic spaces under\ngeneral symmetry assumptions, the former being a zooming-in limit of the latter\nat vanishing cosmological constant. We further apply this method for the two\nhyper-K\\\"ahler spaces with Heisenberg algebra, which is reduced to $U(1)\\times\nU(1)$ at the quaternionic level. We also show that no quaternionic spaces exist\nwith a strict Heisenberg symmetry -- as opposed to $\\text{Heisenberg} \\ltimes\nU(1)$. We finally discuss the realization of the latter by gauging appropriate\n$Sp(2,4)$ generators in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ conformal supergravity.\n", "  This paper has presented inversely determining the resonant configuration of\nthe bilateral nanostructures for periodic metallic slits with extraordinary\noptical transmission performance. The topology optimization approach is\nutilized to implement the inverse design procedure. Several geometrical\nconfigurations of the bilateral nanostructures are derived for periodic\nmetallic slits. The resonant performance of the derived nanostructures are\ndemonstrated by the transmission spectra, where the transmission peak is\npresented at the specified wavelength in the inverse design procedure. This\nprovides an approach to control the red or blue shift of the transmission peak\nor localize the resonant performance at a desired frequency, by specifying the\ndesired incident wavelength in the inverse design procedure. The inverse design\nmethod is extended to make the periodic metallic slits to be less sensitive to\nthe incident wavelength. This research can be further extended to inversely\nfind the resonant subwavelength structures for extraordinary optical absorption\nand other surface palsmon polariton based photonic devices. The inverse design\nof three dimensional apertures for extraordinary optical transmission will be\ninvestigated in our future researches.\n", "  The Cauchy horizon inside a perturbed Kerr black hole develops an instability\nthat transforms it into a curvature singularity. We solve for the linearized\nWeyl scalars $\\psi_0$ and $\\psi_4$ and for the curvature scalar\n$R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}$ along outgoing null\nrays approaching the Cauchy horizon in the interior of perturbed Kerr black\nholes using the Teukolsky equation, and compare our results with those found in\nperturbation analysis. Our results corroborate the previous perturbation\nanalysis result that at its early parts the Cauchy horizon evolves into a\ndeformationally-weak, null, scalar-curvature singularity. We find excellent\nagreement for $\\psi_0(u={\\rm const},v)$, where $u,v$ are advanced and retarded\ntimes, respectively. We do find, however, that the exponential growth rate of\n$R_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}R^{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma\\delta}(u={\\rm const},v)$\napproaching the singularity is dramatically slower than that found in\nperturbation analysis, and that the angular frequency is in excellent\nagreement.\n", "  Recent experiments allowed concluding that Bell-type inequalities are indeed\nviolated thus it is important to understand what it means and how can we\nexplain the existence of strong correlations between outcomes of distant\nmeasurements. Do we have to announce that: Einstein was wrong, Nature is\nnonlocal and nonlocal correlations are produced due to the quantum magic and\nemerge, somehow, from outside space time? Fortunately such conclusions are\nunfounded because if supplementary parameters describing measuring instruments\nare correctly incorporated in a theoretical model then Bell-type inequalities\nmay not be proven .We construct a simple probabilistic model explaining these\ncorrelations in a locally causal way. In our model measurement outcomes are\nneither predetermined nor produced in irreducibly random way. We explain in\ndetail why, contrary to the general belief; an introduction of setting\ndependent parameters does not restrict experimenters' freedom of choice. Since\nthe violation of Bell-type inequalities does not allow concluding that Nature\nis nonlocal and that quantum theory is complete thus the Bohr-Einstein quantum\ndebate may not be closed. The continuation of this debate is not only important\nfor a better understanding of Nature but also for various practical\napplications of quantum phenomena.\n", "  A relativistic quantum field theory with nontrivial background fields is\ndeveloped and applied to study waves in plasmas. The effective action of the\nelectromagnetic 4-potential is calculated ab initio from the standard action of\nscalar QED using path integrals. The resultant effective action is gauge\ninvariant and contains nonlocal interactions, from which gauge bosons acquire\nmasses without breaking the local gauge symmetry. To demonstrate how the\ngeneral theory can be applied, we study a cold unmagnetized plasma and a cold\nuniformly magnetized plasma. Using these two examples, we show that all linear\nwaves well-known in classical plasma physics can be recovered from relativistic\nquantum results when taking the classical limit. In the opposite limit,\nclassical wave dispersion relations are modified substantially. In unmagnetized\nplasmas, longitudinal waves propagate with nonzero group velocities even when\nplasmas are cold. In magnetized plasmas, anharmonically spaced Bernstein waves\npersist even when plasmas are cold. These waves account for cyclotron\nabsorption features observed in spectra of X-ray pulsars. Moreover, cutoff\nfrequencies of the two non-degenerate electromagnetic waves are redshifted by\ndifferent amounts. These corrections need to be taken into account in order to\ncorrectly interpret diagnostic results in laser plasma experiments.\n", "  A summary of number structure scaling is followed by a description of the\neffects of number scaling in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The description\nextends earlier work to include the effects on the states of two or more\ninteracting particles. Emphasis is placed on the effects on entangled states.\nThe resulting scaling field is generalized to describe the effects on these\nstates. It is also seen that one can use fiber bundles with fibers associated\nwith single locations of the underlying space to describe the effects of\nscaling on arbitrary numbers of particles.\n", "  We have investigated the onset of collective motion in systems of model\nmicroswimmers, by performing a comprehensive analysis of the binary collision\ndynamics using three dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) with fully\nresolved hydrodynamics. From this data, we have constructed a simplified binary\ncollision model (BCM) which accurately reproduces the collective behavior\nobtained from the DNS for most cases. Thus, we show that global alignment can\nmostly arise solely from binary collisions. Although the agreement between both\nmodels (DNS and BCM) is not perfect, the parameter range in which notable\ndifferences appear is also that for which strong density fluctuations are\npresent in the system (where pseudo-sound mound can be observed[1]).\n", "  We realize non-universal couplings between Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and\nbulk Standard Model (SM) vectors in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model by including\nboth UV and IR brane-localised gauge kinetic terms. We find that such kinetic\nterms can reduce the couplings of KK gravitons to SM gauge bosons and also\nensure the KK vector masses are consistent with electroweak precision\nconstraints.\n", "  In three spacetime dimensions, (super)conformal geometry is controlled by the\n(super) Cotton tensor. We present a new duality transformation for N-extended\nsupersymmetric theories formulated in terms of the linearised super-Cotton\ntensor or its higher spin extensions for the cases N=2, 1, 0. In the N=2 case,\nthis transformation is a generalisation of the linear-chiral duality, which is\nknown to provide a dual description in terms of chiral superfields for general\nmodels of self-interacting N=2 vector multiplets in three dimensions and N=1\ntensor multiplets in four dimensions. For superspin-1 (gravitino multiplet),\nsuperspin-3/2 (supergravity multiplet) and higher superspins s>3/2, the duality\ntransformation relates a higher-derivative theory to one containing at most two\nderivatives at the component level. In the N=1 case, we introduce gauge\nprepotentials for higher spin superconformal gravity and construct the\ncorresponding super-Cotton tensors, as well as the higher spin extensions of\nthe linearised N=1 conformal supergravity action. Our N=1 duality\ntransformation is a higher spin extension of the known superfield duality\nrelating the massless N=1 vector and scalar multiplets. In the\nnon-supersymmetric (N=0) case, the gauge prepotentials for higher spin\nconformal geometry (both bosonic and fermionic) and the corresponding Cotton\ntensors can be obtained from their N=1 counterparts by carrying out N=1 --> N=0\nreduction. In the bosonic sector, this reduction is shown to lead to the Cotton\ntensors for higher spins constructed by Pope and Townsend, and by Damour and\nDeser in the spin-3 case. Our N=0 duality transformation is a higher spin\nextension of the vector-scalar duality.\n", "  We discuss formulation of QCD in Minkowski-spacetime and effect of an\noperator product expansion by means of normal ordering of fields in the QCD\nLagrangian. The formulation of QCD in the Minkowski-spacetime allows us to\nsolve a constraint equation and decompose the gauge field propagator in the sum\nof an instantaneous part, which forms a bound state, and a retarded part, which\ncontains the relativistic corrections. In Quantum Field Theory, for a\nLagrangian with unordered operator fields, one can make normal ordering by\nmeans of the operator product expansion, then the gluon condensate appear. This\ngives us a natural way of obtaining a dimensional parameter in QCD, which is\nmissing in the QCD Lagrangian. We derive a Schwinger-Dyson equation for a\nquark, which is studied both numerically and analytically. The critical value\nof the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s = 4/{\\pi}$, above which a nontrivial\nsolution appears and a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs, is found.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the considered model describes only one flavor\nmassless quark, but the methods can be used in more general case. The\nFourier-sine transform of a function with log-power asymptotic was performed.\n", "  We study the entanglement in momentum space of the ground state of a\ndisordered one-dimensional fermion lattice model with attractive interaction.\nWe observe two components in the entanglement spectrum, one of which is related\nto paired-fermion entanglement and contributes to the long-range correlation in\nposition space. The vanishing point of it indicates the localization phenomenon\nin the ground state of this model. Additionally, by method of entanglement\nspectrum, we provide a new evidence to show the transition of two phases\ninduced by interaction, and fnd that this phase transition is not infuenced by\nthe disorder. Our result show key characteristics in entanglement for different\nphases in the system, and provide a novel perspective to understand\nlocalization phenomena.\n", "  We report on an experimental observation of classical diffusion\ndistinguishing between structural universality classes of disordered systems in\none dimension. Samples of hyperuniform and short-range disorder were designed,\ncharacterized by the statistics of the placement of $\\mu$m-thin parallel\npermeable barriers, and the time-dependent diffusion coefficient was measured\nby NMR methods over three orders of magnitude in time. The relation between the\nstructural exponent, characterizing disorder universality class, and the\ndynamical exponent of the diffusion coefficient is experimentally verified. The\nexperimentally established relation between structure and transport exemplifies\nthe hierarchical nature of structural complexity --- dynamics are mainly\ndetermined by the universality class, whereas microscopic parameters affect the\nnon-universal coefficients. These results open the way for non-invasive\ncharacterization of structural correlations in porous media, complex materials,\nand biological tissues via a bulk diffusion measurement.\n", "  A numerical study of suspension plasma spraying (SPS) is presented in the\ncurrent work. The liquid suspension jet is replaced with a train of droplets\ncontaining the suspension particles injected into the plasma flow. Atomization,\nevaporation, and melting of different components are considered for droplets\nand particles as they travel towards the substrate. Effect of different\nparameters on particle conditions during flight and upon impact on the\nsubstrate are investigated. Initially, influence of the torch operating\nconditions such as inlet flow rate and power are studied. Additionally, effect\nof injector parameters like injection location, flow rate, and angle are\nexamined. The model used in current study takes high temperature gradients and\nnon-continuum effects into account. Moreover, the important effect of change in\nphysical properties of suspension droplets as a result of evaporation is\nincluded in the model. These mainly include variations in heat transfer\nproperties and viscosity. Utilizing this improved model, several test cases\nhave been considered to better evaluate the effect of different parameters on\nthe quality of particles during flight and upon impact on the substrate.\n", "  The Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole solution in a generic cosmological\nconstant background in the the context of Rastall gravity is obtained. It is\nshown that the cosmological constant arises naturally from the consistency of\nthe non-vacuum field equations of the Rastall theory for a spherical symmetric\nspacetime, rather than its {\\it ad-hoc} introduction in the usual Einstein and\nEinstein-Maxwell field equations. The usual Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om, Schwarzschild\nand Schwarzschild-(anti)de Sitter black hole solutions in the framework of this\ntheory are also addressed as the special independent subclasses of the obtained\ngeneral solution.\n", "  Composite Higgs Models are often constructed including fermionic top partners\nwith a mass around the TeV scale, with the top partners playing the role of\nstabilizing the Higgs potential and enforcing partial compositeness for the top\nquark. A class of models of this kind can be formulated in terms of fermionic\nstrongly coupled gauge theories. A common feature they all share is the\npresence of specific additional scalar resonances, namely two neutral singlets\nand a colored octet, described by a simple effective Lagrangian. We study the\nphenomenology of these scalars, both in a model independent and model dependent\nway, including the bounds from all the available searches in the relevant\nchannels with di-boson and di-top final states. We develop a generic framework\nwhich can be used to constrain any model containing pseudo-scalar singlets or\noctets. Using it, we find that such signatures provide strong bounds on the\ncompositeness scale complementary to the traditional EWPT and Higgs couplings\ndeviations. In many cases a relatively light scalar can be on the verge of\ndiscovery as a first sign of new physics.\n", "  This paper provides a novel approach to solving the transmission of electrons\nthrough large graphene nano-structures, which is shown to be accurate both at\nhigh and low speeds. The model for graphene being solved is the continuum model\ngoverned by an analogue to the Dirac equation. For a solution, the Dirac\nequation is scalarised using the Foldy-Wouthuysen expansion approximation, to\nreduce the problem of calculating the electron wave propagation to a scalar\ndifferential equation. Also transformed is the exact solution of the Dirac\nequation in homogeneous space for the calculation of the propagation of\nelectron waves. By analytically calculating the boundary conditions of the\ntransformed wave functions, we have been able to generate transfer matrices for\nthe scalar propagation equations. Furthermore, we have implemented the\nscattering matrix method upon these transfer matrices. implementing the\nscattering matrix method makes a numerical stable propagation of the waves\nthrough the graphene. Finally we test the convergence and accuracy of the new\nmethod against analytic solutions. Also included is a rich appendix detailing\nthe results of our research into relativistic Green's functions. We uncover and\nresolve an apparent Green's function paradox. Furthermore, in the main-text, we\nmake use of our Green's function theory to develop a high order WKB\napproximation.\n", "  In this paper we describe physical properties arising in the vicinity of two\ncoupled quantum phase transitions. We consider a phenomenological model based\non two scalar order parameter fields locally coupled biquadratically and having\na common quantum critical point as a function of a quantum tuning parameter\nsuch as pressure or magnetic field. A self-consistent treatment suggests that\nthe uniform static susceptibilities of the two order parameter fields may have\nthe same qualitative form at low temperature even where the forms differ\nsharply in the absence of the biquadratic coupling. The possible limitations of\nthe self-consistent analysis leading to this prediction are considered.\n", "  We study the magnetic field and current structure associated with a coronal\nloop. Through this we investigate to what extent the assumptions of a\nforce-free magnetic field break down and where they might be justified. We\nanalyse a 3D MHD model of the solar corona in an emerging active region with\nthe focus on the structure of the forming coronal loops. The lower boundary of\nthis simulation is taken from a model of an emerging active region. As a\nconsequence of the emerging magnetic flux and the horizontal motions at the\nsurface a coronal loop forms self-consistently. We investigate the current\ndensity along magnetic field inside (and outside) this loop and study the\nmagnetic and plasma properties in and around it. We find that the total current\nalong the loop changes its sign from being antiparallel to parallel to the\nmagnetic field. This is caused by the inclination of the loop together with the\nfootpoint motion. Around the loop the currents form a complex non-force-free\nhelical structure. This is directly related to a bipolar current structure at\nthe loop footpoints at the base of the corona and a local reduction of the\nbackground magnetic field (i.e. outside the loop) caused by the plasma flow\ninto and along the loop. The locally reduced magnetic pressure in the loop\nallows the loop to sustain a higher density, which is crucial for the emission\nin extreme UV. The acting of the flow on the magnetic field hosting the loop\nturns out to be also responsible for the observed squashing of the loop. The\ncomplex magnetic field and current system surrounding it can be modeled only in\n3D MHD models where the magnetic field has to balance the plasma pressure. A 1D\ncoronal loop model or a force-free extrapolation can not capture the current\nsystem and the complex interaction of the plasma and the magnetic field in the\ncoronal loop, despite the fact that the loop is under low-$\\beta$ conditions.\n", "  We study the quantum propagation of a Skyrmion in chiral magnetic insulators\nby generalizing the micromagnetic equations of motion to a finite-temperature\npath integral formalism, using field theoretic tools. Promoting the center of\nthe Skyrmion to a dynamic quantity, the fluctuations around the Skyrmionic\nconfiguration give rise to a time-dependent damping of the Skyrmion motion.\nFrom the frequency dependence of the damping kernel, we are able to identify\nthe Skyrmion mass, thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic\nproperties of Skyrmions. When defects are present or a magnetic trap is\napplied, the Skyrmion mass acquires a finite value proportional to the\neffective spin, even at vanishingly small temperature. We demonstrate that a\nSkyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a\nmassive particle owing to its quasi-one-dimensional confinement. An additional\nquantum mass term is predicted, independent of the effective spin, with an\nexplicit temperature dependence which remains finite even at zero temperature.\n", "  We briefly summarize the BRITE observations of classical Cepheids. Possible\ndetection of modulation in a fundamental mode Cepheid, T Vul, and of additional\nnon-radial modes in first overtone Cepheids, DT Cyg and V1334 Cyg, are\nreported.\n", "  Macroscopic mechanical qubits are fundamental both to test the\nclassical-quantum boundary and present suitable candidates for quantum\ninformation processing. Motivated by these, we propose a feasible probabilistic\nscheme to generate an on-demand mechanical qubit, as well as Schr\\\"{o}dinger's\ncat and Fock number states. In order to accomplish this proposal, we study an\nopen dispersive spin-mechanical system in the absence of any external driving.\nThe procedure is solely based on spin post-selection in the weak coupling\nregime. Through this scheme we demonstrate that the achieved superposition is\nclosely related to the amplification of the mean values of the mechanical\nquadratures as they are associated to the maximum quantum coherence.\n", "  We classify Minkowski$_4$ solutions in type IIA supergravity, with N=2\nsupersymmetry and an SU(2) R-symmetry of a certain type. Many subcases can be\nreduced to relatively simple PDEs, among which we recover various intersecting\nbrane systems, and AdS$_d$ solutions, $d=5,6,7$, and in particular the recently\nfound general massive AdS$_7$ solutions. Imposing compactness of the internal\nsix-manifold we obtain promising solutions with localized D-branes and\nO-planes.\n", "  Proposals to reach the next generation of laser intensities through Raman or\nBrillouin backscattering have centered on optical frequencies. Higher\nfrequencies are beyond the range of such methods mainly due to the wave damping\nthat accompanies the higher density plasmas necessary for compressing higher\nfrequency lasers. However, we find that an external magnetic field transverse\nto the direction of laser propagation can reduce the required plasma density.\nUsing parametric interactions in magnetized plasmas to mediate pulse\ncompression both reduces the wave damping and alleviates instabilities, thereby\nenabling higher frequency or lower intensity pumps to produce pulses at higher\nintensity and longer duration. In addition to these theoretical advantages, our\nnew method, in which strong uniform magnetic fields lessen the need for\nhigh-density uniform plasmas, also lessens key engineering challenges, or at\nleast exchanges them for different challenges.\n", "  We show that the distillable coherence---which is equal to the relative\nentropy of coherence---is, up to a constant factor, always bounded by the\n$\\ell_1$-norm measure of coherence (defined as the sum of absolute values of\noff diagonals). Thus the latter plays a similar role as logarithmic negativity\nplays in entanglement theory and this is the best operational interpretation\nfrom a resource-theoretic viewpoint. Consequently the two measures are\nintimately connected to another operational measure, the robustness of\ncoherence. We find also relationships between these measures, which are tight\nfor general states, and the tightest possible for pure and qubit states. For a\ngiven robustness, we construct a state having minimum distillable coherence.\n", "  A unified equation of state for quark-hadron matter is presented in the\ngeneralized Beth-Uhlenbeck form. It follows from a $\\Phi-$derivable approach to\nthe thermodynamic potential where the ansatz for the $\\Phi$ functional contains\nall 2PI diagrams at two-loop order formed with quark cluster Green's functions\nfor quark, diquark, meson and baryon propagators. We present numerical results\nusing an effective model for the generic behaviour of hadron masses and phase\nshifts at finite temperature which shares basic features with recent\ndevelopments within the PNJL model for correlations in quark matter. We obtain\nthe transition between a hadron resonance gas phase and the quark gluon plasma\nwhere the Mott dissociation of hadrons is encoded in the hadronic phase shifts.\nThe resulting thermodynamics is in very good agreement with recent lattice QCD\nsimulations.\n", "  We investigate the necessary conditions for the emergence of complex,\nnoncoplanar magnetic configurations in a Kondo lattice model with classical\nlocal moments on the geometrically frustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice and\ntheir evolution in an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that\ntopologically nontrivial spin textures, including a new canted flux state, with\nnonzero scalar chirality arise dynamically from realistic short-range\ninteractions. Our results establish that a finite Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction is necessary for the emergence of these novel magnetic states when\nthe system is at half filling, for which the ground state is insulating. We\nidentify the minimal set of DM vectors that are necessary for the stabilization\nof chiral magnetic phases. The noncoplanarity of such structures can be tuned\ncontinually by applying an external magnetic field. This is the first part in a\nseries of two papers; in the following paper the effects of frustration,\nthermal fluctuations, and magnetic field on the emergence of novel noncollinear\nstates at metallic filling of itinerant electrons are discussed. Our results\nare crucial in understanding the magnetic and electronic properties of the\nrare-earth tetraboride family of frustrated magnets with separate spin and\ncharge degrees of freedom.\n", "  We explore the magnetic phases in a Kondo lattice model on the geometrically\nfrustrated Shastry-Sutherland lattice at metallic electron densities, searching\nfor noncollinear and noncoplanar spin textures. Motivated by experimental\nobservations in many rare-earth-based frustrated metallic magnets, we treat the\nlocal moments as classical spins and set the coupling between the itinerant\nelectrons and local moments as the largest energy scale in the problem. Our\nresults show that a noncollinear flux state is stabilized over an extended\nrange of Hamiltonian parameters. These spin states can be quenched efficiently\nby external fields like temperature and magnetic field as well as by varying\nthe degree of frustration in the electronic itinerancy and exchange coupling\nbetween local moments. Interestingly, unlike insulating electron densities that\nwe discussed in paper I of this sequence, a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\nbetween the local moments is not essential for the emergence of their\nnoncollinear ordering.\n", "  One of the challenging goals in the studies of many-body physics with\nultracold atoms is the creation of a topological $p_{x} + ip_{y}$ superfluid\nfor identical fermions in two dimensions (2D). The expectations of reaching the\ncritical temperature $T_c$ through p-wave Feshbach resonance in spin-polarized\nfermionic gases have soon faded away because on approaching the resonance, the\nsystem becomes unstable due to inelastic-collision processes. Here, we consider\nan alternative scenario in which a single-component degenerate gas of fermions\nin 2D is paired via phonon-mediated interactions provided by a 3D BEC\nbackground. Within the weak-coupling regime, we calculate the critical\ntemperature $T_c$ for the fermionic pair formation, using Bethe-Salpeter\nformalism, and show that it is significantly boosted by higher-order\ndiagramatic terms, such as phonon dressing and vertex corrections. We describe\nin detail an experimental scheme to implement our proposal, and show that the\nlong-sought p-wave superfluid is at reach with state-of-the-art experiments.\n", "  The Fourier coefficients v[2] and v[3] characterizing the anisotropy of the\nazimuthal distribution of charged particles produced in PbPb collisions at\nsqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV are measured with data collected by the CMS experiment.\nThe measurements cover a broad transverse momentum range, 1 < pT < 100 GeV. The\nanalysis focuses on pT > 10 GeV range, where anisotropic azimuthal\ndistributions should reflect the path-length dependence of parton energy loss\nin the created medium. Results are presented in several bins of PbPb collision\ncentrality, spanning the 60% most central events. The v[2] coefficient is\nmeasured with the scalar product and the multiparticle cumulant methods, which\nhave different sensitivities to the initial-state fluctuations. The values of\nboth methods remain positive up to pT of about 60-80 GeV, in all examined\ncentrality classes. The v[3] coefficient, only measured with the scalar product\nmethod, tends to zero for pT greater than or equal to 20 GeV. Comparisons\nbetween theoretical calculations and data provide new constraints on the\npath-length dependence of parton energy loss in heavy ion collisions and\nhighlight the importance of the initial-state fluctuations.\n", "  We present a Bayesian analysis for a new class of realistic models of\ntwo-phase equations of state (EoS) for hybrid stars and demonstrate that the\nobservation of a pair of high-mass twin stars would have a sufficient\ndiscriminating power to favor hybrid EoS with a strong first order phase\ntransition over alternative EoS. Such a measurement would provide evidence for\nthe existence of a critical endpoint in the QCD phase diagram.\n", "  Recent evidence for high masses ($\\sim 2~ M_\\odot$) pulsars PSR J1614-2230\nand PSR J0348-0432 requires neutron star matter to have a stiff equation of\nstate (EoS). The thermal evolution of compact stars (CS) with stiff hadronic\nEoS necessitates the application of the \"nuclear medium cooling\" scenario with\na selection of appropriate proton gap profiles together with in-medium effects\n(like pion softening) on cooling mechanisms in order to achieve a satisfactory\nexplanation of all existing observational data for the temperature-age relation\nof CS. Here we focus on two examples from \\cite{Grigorian:2016leu} for a stiff\nhadronic EoS without (DD2 EoS) and with (DD2vex) excluded volume correction.\n", "  The rich club organization (the presence of highly connected hub core in a\nnetwork) influences many structural and functional characteristics of networks\nincluding topology, the efficiency of paths and distribution of load. Despite\nits major role, the literature contains only a very limited set of models\ncapable of generating networks with realistic rich club structure. One possible\nreason is that the rich club organization is a divisive property among complex\nnetworks which exhibit great diversity, in contrast to other metrics (e.g.\ndiameter, clustering or degree distribution) which seem to behave very\nsimilarly across many networks. Here we propose a simple yet powerful\ngeometry-based growing model which can generate realistic complex networks with\nhigh rich club diversity by controlling a single geometric parameter. The\ngrowing model is validated against the Internet, protein-protein interaction,\nairport and power grid networks.\n", "  The current work focuses on the process of vacuum Cherenkov radiation for\nLorentz-violating fermions that are described by the minimal Standard-Model\nExtension (SME). To date, most considerations of this important hypothetical\nprocess have been restricted to Lorentz-violating photons, as the necessary\ntheoretical tools for the SME fermion sector have not been available. With\ntheir development in a very recent paper, we are now in a position to compute\nthe decay rates based on a modified Dirac theory. Two realizations of the\nCherenkov process are studied. In the first scenario, the spin projection of\nthe incoming fermion is assumed to be conserved, and in the second, the spin\nprojection is allowed to flip. The first type of process is shown to be still\nforbidden for the dimensionful $a$ and $b$ coefficients where there are strong\nindications that it is energetically disallowed for the $H$ coefficients, as\nwell. However, it is rendered possible for the dimensionless $c$, $d$, $e$,\n$f$, and $g$ coefficients. For large initial fermion energies, the decay rates\nfor the $c$ and $d$ coefficients were found to grow linearly with momentum and\nto be linearly suppressed by the smallness of the Lorentz-violating coefficient\nwhere for the $e$, $f$, and $g$ coefficients this suppression is even\nquadratic. The decay rates vanish in the vicinity of the threshold, as\nexpected. The decay including a fermion spin flip plays a role for the\nspin-nondegenerate operators and it was found to occur for the dimensionful $b$\nand $H$ coefficients as well as for the dimensionless $d$ and $g$. The\ncharacteristics of this process differ much from the properties of the\nspin-conserving one, e.g., there is no threshold. Based on experimental data of\nultra-high-energy cosmic rays, new constraints on Lorentz violation in the\nquark sector are obtained from the thresholds.\n", "  Charge separation is a critical process for achieving high efficiencies in\norganic photovoltaic cells. The initial tightly bound excitonic electron-hole\npair has to dissociate fast enough in order to avoid photocurrent generation\nand thus power conversion efficiency loss via geminate recombination. Such\nprocess takes place assisted by transitional states that lie between the\ninitial exciton and the free charge state. Due to spin conservation rules these\nintermediate charge transfer states typically have singlet character. Here we\npropose a donor-acceptor model for a generic organic photovoltaic cell in which\nthe process of charge separation is modulated by a magnetic field which tunes\nthe energy levels. The impact of a magnetic field is to intensify the\ngeneration of charge transfer states with triplet character via inter-system\ncrossing. As the ground state of the system has singlet character, triplet\nstates are recombination-protected, thus leading to a higher probability of\nsuccessful charge separation. Using the open quantum systems formalism we\ndemonstrate that not only the population of triplet charge transfer states\ngrows in the presence of a magnetic field, but also how the power outcome of an\norganic photovoltaic cell is in that way increased.\n", "  Nuclear clustering describes the appearance of structures resembling smaller\nnuclei such as alpha particles (4He nuclei) within the interior of a larger\nnucleus. While clustering is important for several well-known examples, much\nremains to be discovered about the general nature of clustering in nuclei. In\nthis letter we present lattice Monte Carlo calculations based on chiral\neffective field theory for the ground states of helium, beryllium, carbon, and\noxygen isotopes. By computing model-independent measures that probe three- and\nfour-nucleon correlations at short distances, we determine the shape of the\nalpha clusters and the entanglement of nucleons comprising each alpha cluster\nwith the outside medium. We also introduce a new computational approach called\nthe pinhole algorithm, which solves a long-standing deficiency of\nauxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations in computing density correlations\nrelative to the center of mass. We use the pinhole algorithm to determine the\nproton and neutron density distributions and the geometry of cluster\ncorrelations in 12C, 14C, and 16C. The structural similarities among the carbon\nisotopes suggest that 14C and 16C have excitations analogous to the well-known\nHoyle state resonance in 12C.\n", "  Various hypotheses exist about the paths used for communication between the\nnodes of complex networks. Most studies simply suppose that communication goes\nvia shortest paths, while others have more explicit assumptions about how\nrouting (alternatively navigation or search) works or should work in real\nnetworks. However, these assumptions are rarely checked against real data. Here\nwe directly analyze the structure of operational paths using real measurements.\nFor this purpose we use existing and newly created datasets having both the\ntopology of the network and a sufficient number of empirically-determined paths\nover it. Such datasets are processed for air transportation networks, the human\nbrain, the Internet and the fit-fat-cat word ladder game. Our results suggest\nthat from the great number of possible paths, nature seems to pick according to\nsome simple rules, which we will refer to as routing policies. First we\nconfirm, that the preference of short paths is an inevitable policy element,\nhowever the observed stretch of the paths suggests that there are other\npolicies at work simultaneously. We identify two additional policies common in\nour networks: the \"conform hierarchy\", meaning that the paths should obey the\nstructural hierarchy of the network, and the \"prefer downstream\" policy which\npromotes avoiding the network core if possible. Building upon these simple\npolicies, we propose a synthetic routing policy which can recover the basic\nstatistical properties of the operational paths in networks. Our results can be\nhelpful in estimating the reaction of complex systems for stress coming from\nthe outside more accurately than the shortest path assumption permits.\n", "  We present a cylindrically symmetric, Petrov type D, nonexpanding, shear free\nand vorticity free solution of Einstein's field equations. The spacetime is\nasymptotically flat radially and regular everywhere except on the symmetry axis\nwhere it possesses a naked curvature singularity. The energy momentum tensor of\nthe spacetime is that for an anisotropic fluid which satisfies the different\nenergy conditions. This spacetime is used to generate a rotating spacetime\nwhich admits closed timelike curves and may represent a Cosmic Time Machine.\n", "  Image resolvability is the primary concern in imaging. This paper reports an\nestimation of the full width at half maximum of the point spread function from\na Fourier domain plot of real sample images by neither using test objects, nor\ndefining a threshold criterion. We suggest that this method can be applied to\nany type of image, independently of the imaging modality.\n", "  Over the recent years, the Petersen diagram for classical pulsators, Cepheids\nand RR Lyr stars, populated with a few hundreds of new multiperiodic variables.\nWe review our analyses of the OGLE data, which resulted in the significant\nextension of the known, and in the discovery of a few new and distinct forms of\nmultiperiodic pulsation. The showcase includes not only radial mode pulsators,\nbut also radial-non-radial pulsators and stars with significant modulation\nobserved on top of the beat pulsation. First theoretical models explaining the\nnew forms of stellar variability are briefly discussed.\n", "  H$_2^+$ is an ideal candidate for a detailed study of strong field coherent\ncontrol strategies inspired by basic mechanisms referring to some specific\nphotodissociation resonances. Two of them are considered in this work, namely:\nZero-width resonances (ZWR) on one hand, and coalescing pairs of resonances at\nexceptional points (EP) on the other hand. An adiabatic transport theory based\non Floquet Hamiltonian formalism is developed within the challenging context of\nmultiphoton dynamics involving nuclear continua. It is shown that a rigorous\ntreatment is only possible for ZWRs, whereas adiabatic transport mediated by\nEPs is subjected to restrictions. Numerical maps of resonance widths and\nnon-adiabatic couplings in the laser parameter plane help in optimally shaping\ncontrol pulses. Full time-dependent wavepacket dynamics shows the possibility\nof selective, robust filtration and vibrational population transfers, within\nexperimental feasibility criteria.\n", "  A photonic circuit is generally described as a structure in which light\npropagates by unitary exchange and transfers reversibly between channels. In\ncontrast, the term `diffusive' is more akin to a chaotic propagation in\nscattering media, where light is driven out of coherence towards a thermal\nmixture. Based on the dynamics of open quantum systems, the combination of\nthese two opposites can result in novel techniques for coherent light control.\nThe crucial feature of these photonic structures is dissipative coupling\nbetween modes, via an interaction with a common reservoir. Here, we demonstrate\nexperimentally that such systems can perform optical equalisation to smooth\nmultimode light, or act as a distributor, guiding it into selected channels.\nQuantum thermodynamically, these systems can act as catalytic coherent\nreservoirs by performing perfect non-Landauer erasure. For lattice structures,\nlocalised stationary states can be supported in the continuum, similar to\ncompacton-like states in conventional flat band lattices.\n", "  When taking the model error into account in data assimilation, one needs to\nevaluate the prior distribution represented by the Onsager--Machlup functional.\nThrough numerical experiments, this study clarifies how the prior distribution\nshould be incorporated into cost functions for discrete-time estimation\nproblems. Consistent with previous theoretical studies, the divergence of the\ndrift term is essential in weak-constraint 4D-Var (w4D-Var), but it is not nec\nessary in Markov chain Monte Carlo with the Euler scheme. Although the former\nproperty may cause difficulties when implementing w4D-Var in large systems,\nthis paper proposes a new technique for estimating the divergence term and its\nderivative.\n", "  We present the first combination of NLO QCD matrix elements for di-Higgs\nproduction, retaining the full top quark mass dependence, with a parton shower.\nResults are provided within both the POWHEG-BOX and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO Monte\nCarlo frameworks. We assess in detail the theoretical uncertainties and provide\ndifferential results. We find that, as expected, the shower effects are\nrelatively large for observables like the transverse momentum of the Higgs\nboson pair, which are sensitive to extra radiation. However, these shower\neffects are still much smaller than the differences between the Born-improved\nHEFT approximation and the full NLO calculation in the tails of the\ndistributions.\n", "  Searching large databases is an important problem with broad applications.\nThe Grover search algorithm provides a powerful method for quantum computers to\nperform searches with a quadratic speedup in the number of required database\nqueries over classical computers. It is an optimal search algorithm for a\nquantum computer, and has further applications as a subroutine for other\nquantum algorithms. Searches with two qubits have been demonstrated on a\nvariety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have\nonly been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results\nfor a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum\ncomputing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical\nperformance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result\noracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking\nare used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental\ndemonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is\ndirectly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical\nsearch. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical\ncounterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate,\nwhich is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these\ngates have process fidelities of 70.5% and 89.6%, respectively.\n", "  The Bell-KS theorem and the more recent $\\psi$-epistemic \\emph{no-go}\ntheorems of QM are discussed in the context of Entropic Dynamics. In doing so\nwe find that the Bell-KS theorem allows for, a perhaps overlooked,\nhybrid-contextual model of QM in which one set of commuting observables\n(position in this case) is non-contextual and all other observables are\ncontextual. Entropic Dynamics is in a unique position as compared to other\nfoundational theories of QM because it derives QM using standard techniques in\nBayesian probability theory. In this formalism, position is the preferred basis\nfrom which inferences about other contextual operators are made. This leads to\nthe interpretation that Entropic Dynamics is a hybrid-contextual model of QM,\nwhich we show to be consistent with the Bell-KS theorem and QM.\n", "  A macroscopically constrained Wang-Landau Monte Carlo method was recently\nproposed to calculate the joint density of states (DOS) for systems with\nmultiple order parameters. Here we demonstrate results for a nearest-neighbor\nIsing antiferromagnet with ferromagnetic long-range interactions (a model\nspin-crossover material). Its two relevant order parameters are the\nmagnetization $M$ and the staggered magnetization $M_{\\rm s}$. The joint DOS,\n$g(E,M,M_{\\rm s})$ where $E$ is the total system energy, is calculated for zero\nexternal field and long-range interaction strength, and then obtained for\narbitrary values of these two field-like model parameters by a simple\ntransformation of $E$. Illustrations are shown for several parameter sets.\n", "  In this Letter, it is shown that interactions can facilitate the emergence of\ntopological edge states of quantum-degenerate bosonic systems in the presence\nof a harmonic potential. This effect is demonstrated with the concrete model of\na hexagonal lattice populated by spin-one bosons under a synthetic gauge field.\nIn fermionic or noninteracting systems, the presence of a harmonic trap can\nobscure the observation of edge states. For our system with weakly interacting\nbosons in the Thomas--Fermi regime, we can clearly see a topological band\nstructure with a band gap traversed by edge states. We also find that the\nnumber of edge states crossing the gap is increased in the presence of a\nharmonic trap, and the edge modes experience an energy shift while traversing\nthe first Brillouin zone which is related to the topological properties of the\nsystem. We find an analytical expression for the edge-state energies and our\ncomparison with numerical computation shows excellent agreement.\n", "  Conducting polymers have become standard engineering materials, used in\nmanyelectronic devices. Despite this, there is a lack of understanding of the\nmicroscopicorigin of the conducting properties, especially at realistic device\nfield strengths. Wepresent simulations of doped poly(p-phenylene) (PPP) using a\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) tight-binding model, with the electric field included\nin the Hamiltonian througha time-dependent vector potential via Peierls\nsubstitution of the phase factor. We findthat polarons typically break down\nwithin less than a picosecond after the field hasbeen switched on, already for\nelectric fields as low as around 1.6 mV/{\\AA}. This is a fieldstrength common\nin many flexible organic electronic devices. Our results challenge therelevance\nof the polaron as charge carrier in conducting polymers for a wide range\nofapplications.\n", "  The spatial morphological study of studied clusters is carried out through\nthe identified probable members within them. The field stars decontamination is\nperformed by the statistical cleaning approach (depends on the magnitude and\ncolour of stars within the field and cluster regions). The CMRD (colour\nmagnitude ratio diagram) approach is used to separate stellar sequences of the\ncluster systems. The age, distance and reddening of each cluster are estimated\nthrough the visual inspection of best fitted isochrone in colour magnitude\ndiagrams(CMDs). The mean proper motion values of clusters are obtained through\nthe extracted data from PPMXL and UCAC4 catalogs. Moreover, these values are\nvarying according to the extracted data-set from these catalogues. This\nvariation is occurred due to their different estimation efficiency of proper\nmotions. The TCR (two colour ratio) and TCMR (two colour magnitude ratio)\nvalues of each cluster are determined by utilizing the WISE and PPMXL\ncatalogues, these values are found abnormal for TEUTSCH 106. In addition, the\nTCMR values are similar to TCR values at longer wavelength, whereas both values\nare far away to each other at shorter wavelength. The fraction of young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) is also computed for each cluster.\n", "  We present improved Mars Odyssey Neutron Spectrometer (MONS) maps of\nnear-surface Water-Equivalent Hydrogen (WEH) on Mars that have intriguing\nimplications for the global distribution of \"excess\" ice, which occurs when the\nmass fraction of water ice exceeds the threshold amount needed to saturate the\npore volume in normal soils. We have refined the crossover technique of Feldman\net al. (2011) by using spatial deconvolution and Gaussian weighting to create\nthe first globally self-consistent map of WEH. At low latitudes, our new maps\nindicate that WEH exceeds 15% in several near-equatorial regions, such as\nArabia Terra, which has important implications for the types of hydrated\nminerals present at low latitudes. At high latitudes, we demonstrate that the\ndisparate MONS and Phoenix Robotic Arm (RA) observations of near surface WEH\ncan be reconciled by a three-layer model incorporating dry soil over fully\nsaturated pore ice over pure excess ice: such a three-layer model can also\npotentially explain the strong anticorrelation of subsurface ice content and\nice table depth observed at high latitudes. At moderate latitudes, we show that\nthe distribution of recently formed impact craters is also consistent with our\nlatest MONS results, as both the shallowest ice-exposing crater and deepest\nnon-ice-exposing crater at each impact site are in good agreement with our\npredictions of near-surface WEH. Overall, we find that our new mapping is\nconsistent with the widespread presence at mid-to-high Martian latitudes of\nrecently deposited shallow excess ice reservoirs that are not yet in\nequilibrium with the atmosphere.\n", "  In this article, we tentatively assign the $\\Lambda_c(2860)$,\n$\\Lambda_c(2880)$, $\\Xi_c(3055)$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)$ to be the D-wave baryon\nstates with the spin-parity $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^+$, ${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$,\n${\\frac{3}{2}}^+$ and ${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$, respectively, and study their masses\nand pole residues with the QCD sum rules in a systematic way by constructing\nthree-types interpolating currents with the quantum numbers\n$(L_\\rho,L_\\lambda)=(0,2)$, $(2,0)$ and $(1,1)$, respectively. The present\npredictions favor assigning the $\\Lambda_c(2860)$, $\\Lambda_c(2880)$,\n$\\Xi_c(3055)$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)$ to be the D-wave baryon states with the quantum\nnumbers $(L_\\rho,L_\\lambda)=(0,2)$ and $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^+$,\n${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$, ${\\frac{3}{2}}^+$ and ${\\frac{5}{2}}^+$, respectively. While\nthe predictions for the masses of the $(L_\\rho,L_\\lambda)=(2,0)$ and $(1,1)$\nD-wave $\\Lambda_c$ and $\\Xi_c$ states can be confronted to the experimental\ndata in the future.\n", "  Large amplitude waves in magnetized plasmas, generated either by external\npumps or internal instabilities, can scatter via three-waves interactions.\nWhile three-wave scatterings in either forward or backward geometry are\nwell-known, what happens when waves propagate at angles with one another in\nmagnetized plasmas remains largely unknown, mainly due to the analytical\ndifficulty of this problem. In this paper, we overcome this analytical\ndifficulty and find a convenient formula for three-wave coupling coefficients\nin cold, uniform, magnetized plasmas in the most general geometry. This is\nachieved by systematically solving the fluid-Maxwell model to second order\nusing a multiscale perturbative expansion. The general formula for the coupling\ncoefficient becomes transparent when we reformulate it as the S matrix element\nof a quantized Lagrangian. Using the quantized Lagrangian, it is possible to\nbypass the perturbative solution and directly obtain the nonlinear coupling\ncoefficient from the linear response of plasmas. To illustrate how to evaluate\nthe cold coupling coefficient, we give a set of examples where the\nparticipating waves are either quasi-transverse or quasi-longitudinal. In these\nexamples, we determine the angular dependence of three-wave scattering, and\ndemonstrate that backscattering is not necessarily the strongest scattering\nchannel in magnetized plasmas, in contrast to what happens in unmgnetized\nplasmas. Our approach gives a more complete picture, beyond the simple\ncollimated geometry, of how injected waves can decay in magnetic confinement\ndevices, as well as how lasers can be scattered in magnetized plasma targets.\n", "  Topological defects (kinks) in a relativistic $\\phi^{4}$ scalar field theory\nin $D=(1+1)$ are studied using the matrix product state tensor network. The one\nkink state is approximated as a matrix product state and the kink mass is\ncalculated. The approach used is quite general and can be applied to a variety\nof theories and tensor networks. Additionally, the contribution of\nkink-antikink excitations to the ground state is examined and a general method\nto estimate the scalar mass from equal time ground state observables is\nprovided. The scalar and kink mass are compared at strong coupling and behave\nas expected from universality arguments. This suggests that the matrix product\nstate can adequately capture the physics of defect-antidefect excitations and\nthus provides a promising technique to study challenging non-equilibrium\nphysics such as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect formation.\n", "  Ionization with ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime can\nbe used to prepare an ion in a superposition of spin--orbit substates. In this\nwork, we study the coherence properties of such a superposition, created by\nionizing xenon atoms using two phase-locked XUV pulses at different\nfrequencies. In general, if the duration of the driving pulse exceeds the\nquantum beat period, dephasing will occur. If however, the frequency difference\nof the two pulses matches the spin--orbit splitting, the coherence can be\nefficiently increased and dephasing does not occur.\n", "  We study the emergence of two-dimensional conformal symmetry in critical\nquantum spin chains on the finite circle. Our goal is to characterize the\nconformal field theory (CFT) describing the universality class of the\ncorresponding quantum phase transition. As a means to this end, we propose and\ndemonstrate automated procedures which, using only the lattice Hamiltonian $H =\n\\sum_j h_j$ as an input, systematically identify the low-energy eigenstates\ncorresponding to Virasoro primary and quasiprimary operators, and assign the\nremaining low-energy eigenstates to conformal towers. The energies and momenta\nof the primary operator states are needed to determine the primary operator\nscaling dimensions and conformal spins -- an essential part of the conformal\ndata that specifies the CFT. Our techniques use the action, on the low-energy\neigenstates of $H$, of the Fourier modes $H_n$ of the Hamiltonian density\n$h_j$. The $H_n$ were introduced as lattice representations of the Virasoro\ngenerators by Koo and Saleur [Nucl. Phys. B 426, 459 (1994)]. In this paper we\ndemonstrate that these operators can be used to extract conformal data in a\nnonintegrable quantum spin chain.\n", "  It is well known that a sequence of two non-collinear pure Lorentz\ntransformations (boosts) is not a boost again, but involves a spatial rotation,\nthe Wigner or Thomas-Wigner rotation. The formation of this rotation is\nvisually illustrated by moving a Born-rigid object on a closed trajectory in\nseveral sections. Within each section the boost's proper time duration is\nassumed to be the same and the object's centre accelerates uniformly.\nBorn-rigidity implies that the stern of this object accelerates faster than its\nbow. It is shown that at least five boosts are required to return the object's\ncentre to its start position. With these assumptions, the Thomas-Wigner\nrotation angle depends on a single parameter only, the maximum speed reached\nwithin each boost section. The visualization highlights the close relationship\nbetween the Thomas-Wigner rotation and the relativity of simultaneity.\nFurthermore, it is illustrated that accelerated motion implies the formation of\nan event horizon. The event horizons associated with the five boosts constitute\na boundary to the rotated Born-rigid object and ensure its finite size.\n", "  In the framework of the littlest Higgs Model with T-parity, we discuss the\ntop partner production at future $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. We calculate the cross\nsections of the top partner production processes and associated production\nprocesses of Higgs and top partner under current constraints. Then, we\ninvestigate the observability of the T-odd top partner pair production through\nthe process $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow T_{-}\\bar{T}_{-}\\rightarrow\nt\\bar{t}A_{H}A_{H}$ in the $t\\bar{t}$ di-lepton channel for two T-odd top\npartner mass $m_{T_{-}}$=603(708) GeV at $\\sqrt{s}$=1.5 TeV. We analyze the\nsignal significance depending on the integrated luminosity and find this signal\nis promising at the future high energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider.\n", "  We present calculations showing how electron rest mass influences entropy\nflow, neutrino decoupling, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in the early\nuniverse. To elucidate this physics and especially the sensitivity of BBN and\nrelated epochs to electron mass, we consider a parameter space of rest mass\nvalues larger and smaller than the accepted vacuum value. Electromagnetic\nequilibrium, coupled with the high entropy of the early universe, guarantees\nthat significant numbers of electron-positron pairs are present, and dominate\nover the number of ionization electrons to temperatures much lower than the\nvacuum electron rest mass. Scattering between the electrons-positrons and the\nneutrinos largely controls the flow of entropy from the plasma into the\nneutrino seas. Moreover, the number density of electron-positron-pair targets\ncan be exponentially sensitive to the effective in-medium electron mass. This\nentropy flow influences the phasing of scale factor and temperature, the\ncharged current weak-interaction-determined neutron-to-proton ratio, and the\nspectral distortions in the relic neutrino energy spectra. Our calculations\nshow the sensitivity of the physics of this epoch to three separate effects:\nfinite electron mass, finite-temperature quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects\non the plasma equation of state, and Boltzmann neutrino energy transport. The\nratio of neutrino to plasma component energy scales manifests in Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) observables, namely the baryon density and the\nradiation energy density, along with the primordial helium and deuterium\nabundances. Our results demonstrate how the treatment of in-medium electron\nmass (i.e., QED effects) could translate into an important source of\nuncertainty in extracting neutrino and beyond-standard-model physics limits\nfrom future high-precision CMB data.\n", "  The symmetric splitting of two spin-wave branches in an antiferromagnetic\nresonance (AFR) experiment has been an essential measurement of\nantiferromagnets for over half a century. In this work, circularly polarized\ntime-domain THz spectroscopy experiments performed on the low symmetry\nmultiferroic h-HoMnO$_3$ reveal an AFR of the Mn sublattice to split\nasymmetrically in applied magnetic field, with an $\\approx$ 50\\% difference in\n$g$-factors between the high and low energy branches of this excitation. The\ntemperature dependence of the $g$-factors, including a drastic renormalization\nat the Ho spin ordering temperature, reveals this asymmetry to unambiguously\nstem from Ho-Mn interactions. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the AFR\nasymmetry is not explained by conventional Ho-Mn exchange mechanisms alone and\nare only reproduced if quartic spin interactions are also included in the spin\nHamiltonian. Our results provide a paradigm for the optical study of such novel\ninteractions in hexagonal manganites and low symmetry antiferromagnets in\ngeneral.\n", "  Semi-holographic models of non-Fermi liquids have been shown to have\ngenerically stable generalised quasi-particles on the Fermi surface. Although\nthese excitations are broad and exhibit particle-hole asymmetry, they were\nargued to be stable from interactions at the Fermi surface. In this work, we\nuse this observation to compute the density response and collective behaviour\nin these systems.\n  Compared to the Fermi liquid case, we find that the boundaries of the\nparticle-hole continuum are blurred by incoherent contributions. However, there\nis a region inside this continuum, that we call inner core, within which\nsalient features of the Fermi liquid case are preserved. A particularly\nstriking prediction of our work is that these systems support a plasmonic\ncollective excitation which is well-defined at large momenta, has an\napproximately linear dispersion relation and is located in the low-energy tail\nof the particle-hole continuum.\n  Furthermore, the dynamic screening potential shows deep attractive regions as\na function of the distance at higher frequencies which might lead to long-lived\npair formation depending on the behaviour of the pair susceptibility. We also\nfind that Friedel oscillations are present in these systems but are highly\nsuppressed.\n", "  We describe global embeddings of fractional D3 branes at orientifolded\nsingularities in type IIB flux compactifications. We present an explicit\nCalabi-Yau example where the chiral visible sector lives on a local\norientifolded quiver while non-perturbative effects, $\\alpha'$ corrections and\na T-brane hidden sector lead to full closed string moduli stabilisation in a de\nSitter vacuum. The same model can also successfully give rise to inflation\ndriven by a del Pezzo divisor. Our model represents the first explicit\nCalabi-Yau example featuring both an inflationary and a chiral visible sector.\n", "  In collinear factorization, light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are\nkey ingredients to calculate the production rate of a hadron in high energy\nexclusive processes. For a doubly-heavy meson system (such as $B_c, J/\\psi,\n\\Upsilon$ etc), the LCDAs contain perturbative scales that can be integrated\nout and then are re-factorized into products of perturbatively calculable\ndistribution parts and non-relativistic QCD matrix elements. In this\nre-factorization scheme, the LCDAs are known at next-to-leading order in the\nstrong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ and at leading order in the velocity\nexpansion. In this work, we calculate the ${\\cal O}( { v}^2)$ corrections to\ntwist-2 LCDAs of S-wave $B_c$ mesons. These results are applicable to heavy\nquarkonia like $\\eta_{c,b}$, $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$ by setting $m_b=m_c$. We\napply these relativistically corrected LCDAs to study their inverse moments and\na few Gegenbauer moments which are important for phenomenological study. We\npoint out that the relativistic corrections are sizable, and comparable with\nthe next-to-leading order radiative corrections. These results for LCDAs are\nuseful in future theoretical analyses of the productions of heavy quarkonia and\n$B_c$ mesons.\n", "  Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) for atomistic simulations are a promising\nalternative to conventional classical potentials. Current approaches rely on\ndescriptors of the local atomic environment with dimensions that increase\nquadratically with the number of chemical species. In this article, we\ndemonstrate that such a scaling can be avoided in practice. We show that a\nmathematically simple and computationally efficient descriptor with constant\ncomplexity is sufficient to represent transition-metal oxide compositions and\nbiomolecules containing 11 chemical species with a precision of around 3\nmeV/atom. This insight removes a perceived bound on the utility of MLPs and\npaves the way to investigate the physics of previously inaccessible materials\nwith more than ten chemical species.\n", "  We study operator insertions into 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in N = 6 ABJM theory\nand investigate their two-point correlators. In this framework, the energy\nemitted by a heavy moving probe can be exactly obtained from some two-point\ncoefficients of bosonic and fermionic insertions. This allows us to confirm an\nearly proposal for computing the Bremsstrahlung function in terms of certain\nsupersymmetric circular Wilson loops, whose value might be accessible to\nlocalization techniques. In the derivation of this result we also elucidate the\nstructure of protected multiplets in the relevant superconformal defect theory\nand perform an explicit two-loop calculation.\n", "  We study properties of magnetic nanoparticles adsorbed on the halloysite\nsurface. For that a distinct magnetic Hamiltonian with random distribution of\nspins on a cylindrical surface was solved by using a nonequilibrium Monte Carlo\nmethod. The parameters for our simulations: anisotropy constant, nanoparticle\nsize distribution, saturated magnetization and geometrical parameters of the\nhalloysite template were taken from recent experiments. We calculate the\nhysteresis loops and temperature dependence of the zero field cooling (ZFC)\nsusceptibility, which maximum determines the blocking temperature. It is shown\nthat the dipole-dipole interaction between nanoparticles moderately increases\nthe blocking temperature and weakly increases the coercive force. The obtained\nhysteresis loops (e.g., the value of the coercive force) for Ni nanoparticles\nare in reasonable agreement with the experimental data. We also discuss the\nsensitivity of the hysteresis loops and ZFC susceptibilities to the change of\nanisotropy and dipole-dipole interaction, as well as the 3d-shell occupation of\nthe metallic nanoparticles; in particular we predict larger coercive force for\nFe, than for Ni nanoparticles.\n", "  We study the ground state and excitations of a one-dimensional trapped\npolarized Fermi gas interacting with a single impurity. First, we study the\ntunnelling dynamics of the impurity through a potential barrier, such as one\neffectively created by a double-well trap. To this end, we perform an exact\ndiagonalization of the full few-body Hamiltonian and analyze the results in a\nLocal Density Approximation. Off-diagonal and one-particle correlation matrices\nare studied and are shown to be useful for discerning between different\nsymmetries of the states. Second, we consider a radio-frequency (RF)\nspectroscopy of our system and the resulting spectral function. These\ncalculations can motivate future experiments, which can provide a further\ninsight into the physics of a Fermi polaron.\n", "  According to common lore, Equations of State of field theories with gravity\nduals tend to be soft, with speeds of sound either below or around the\nconformal value of $v_s=1/\\sqrt{3}$. This has important consequences in\nparticular for the physics of compact stars, where the detection of two solar\nmass neutron stars has been shown to require very stiff equations of state. In\nthis paper, we show that no speed limit exists for holographic models at finite\ndensity, explicitly constructing examples where the speed of sound becomes\narbitrarily close to that of light. This opens up the possibility of building\nhybrid stars that contain quark matter obeying a holographic equation of state\nin their cores.\n", "  We study electroweak scale Dark Matter (DM) whose interactions with baryonic\nmatter are mediated by a heavy anomalous $Z'$. We emphasize that when the DM is\na Majorana particle, its low-velocity annihilations are dominated by loop\nsuppressed annihilations into the gauge bosons, rather than by p-wave or\nchirally suppressed annihilations into the SM fermions. Because the $Z'$ is\nanomalous, these kinds of DM models can be realized only as effective field\ntheories (EFTs) with a well-defined cutoff, where heavy spectator fermions\nrestore gauge invariance at high energies. We formulate these EFTs, estimate\ntheir cutoff and properly take into account the effect of the Chern-Simons\nterms one obtains after the spectator fermions are integrated out. We find\nthat, while for light DM collider and direct detection experiments usually\nprovide the strongest bounds, the bounds at higher masses are heavily dominated\nby indirect detection experiments, due to strong annihilation into $W^+W^-$,\n$ZZ$, $Z\\gamma$ and possibly into $gg$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$. We emphasize that\nthese annihilation channels are generically significant because of the\nstructure of the EFT, and therefore these models are prone to strong indirect\ndetection constraints. Even though we focus on selected $Z'$ models for\nillustrative purposes, our setup is completely generic and can be used for\nanalyzing the predictions of any anomalous $Z'$-mediated DM model with\narbitrary charges.\n", "  Within a Ginzburg-Landau formalism we establish analytically the necessary\nand sufficient conditions to realize a doubly degenerate superconducting ground\nstate with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) in a multi-band superconductor.\nUsing these results we analyze the ground state of a three-band superconductor\nin the cylindrical geometry in an external magnetic field. We show that\ndepending on the interband coupling constants, a magnetic flux can induce\ncurrent density jumps in such superconducting geometries that are related to\nadiabatic or non-adiabatic transitions from BTRS to time-reversal symmetric\nstates and vice versa. This unusual current induced magnetic flux response can\nin principle be used experimentally to detect superconducting BTRS ground\nstates as well as corresponding metastable excited states.\n", "  We show that minimal models of nondegenerated hypersufaces defined by Laurent\npolynomials with a $d$-dimensional Newton polytope $\\Delta$ are Calabi-Yau\nvarieties $X$ if and only if the Fine interior of $\\Delta$ consists of a single\nlattice point. We give a combinatorial formula for computing the stringy Euler\nnumber of $X$. This formula allows to test mirror symmetry in cases when\n$\\Delta$ is not a reflexive polytope. In particular we apply this formula to\npairs of lattice polytopes $(\\Delta, \\Delta^{\\vee})$ that appear in the\nMavlyutov's generalization of the polar duality for reflexive polytopes. Some\nexamples of Mavlyutov's dual pairs $(\\Delta, \\Delta^{\\vee})$ show that the\nstringy Euler numbers of the corresponding Calabi-Yau varieties $X$ and\n$X^{\\vee}$ may not satisfy the expected topological mirror symmetry test:\n$e_{\\rm st}(X) = (-1)^{d-1} e_{\\rm st}(X^{\\vee})$. This shows the necessity of\nan additional condition on Mavlyutov's pairs $(\\Delta, \\Delta^\\vee)$.\n", "  We present a conjectured family of SIC-POVMs which have an additional\nsymmetry group whose size is growing with the dimension. The symmetry group is\nrelated to Fibonacci numbers, while the dimension is related to Lucas numbers.\nThe conjecture is supported by exact solutions for dimensions\nd=4,8,19,48,124,323, as well as a numerical solution for dimension d=844.\n", "  Calculations in the sd and pf shells reported some time ago by Satu\\l a\\etal\\\n[Phys.~Lett.~B~407, 103 (1997)] are redone for an extended analysis of the\nresults. As in the original work, we do calculations for one mass number in\neach shell and consider in each case the sequence of lowest energies for\nisospins 0, 2, and 4, briefly the symmetry spectrum. Following further the\noriginal work we study how this spectrum changes when parts of the two-nucleon\ninteraction are turned off. The variation of its width is explored in detail. A\ndifferential combination $\\epsilon_\\text{W}$ of the three energies was taken in\nthe original work as a measure of the so-called Wigner term in semi-empirical\nmass formulas, and it was found to decrease drastically when the two-nucleon\ninteraction in the channel of zero isospin is turned off. Our analysis shows\nthat the width of the symmetry spectrum experiences an equally drastic\ndecrease, which can be explained qualitatively in terms of schematic\napproximations. We therefore suggest that the decrease of $\\epsilon_\\text{W}$\nbe seen mainly as a side effect of a narrowing of the symmetry spectrum rather\nthan an independent manifestation of the two-nucleon interaction in the channel\nof zero isospin.\n", "  Entanglement in angular momentum degrees of freedom is a precious resource\nfor quantum metrology and control. Here we study the conversions of this\nresource, focusing on Bell pairs of spin-J particles, where one particle is\nused to probe unknown rotations and the other particle is used as reference.\nWhen a large number of pairs are given, we show that every rotated spin-J Bell\nstate can be reversibly converted into an equivalent number of rotated spin\none-half Bell states, at a rate determined by the quantum Fisher information.\nThis result provides the foundation for the definition of an elementary unit of\ninformation about rotations in space, which we call the Cartesian refbit. In\nthe finite copy scenario, we design machines that approximately break down Bell\nstates of higher spins into Cartesian refbits, as well as machines that\napproximately implement the inverse process. In addition, we establish a\nquantitative link between the conversion of Bell states and the simulation of\nunitary gates, showing that the fidelity of probabilistic state conversion\nprovides upper and lower bounds on the fidelity of deterministic gate\nsimulation. The result holds not only for rotation gates, but also to all sets\nof gates that form finite-dimensional representations of compact groups. For\nrotation gates, we show how rotations on a system of given spin can simulate\nrotations on a system of different spin.\n", "  The Kepler-Heisenberg problem is that of determining the motion of a planet\naround a sun in the sub-Riemannian Heisenberg group. The sub-Riemannian\nHamiltonian provides the kinetic energy, and the gravitational potential is\ngiven by the fundamental solution to the sub-Laplacian. This system is known to\nadmit closed orbits, which all lie within a fundamental integrable subsystem.\nHere, we develop a computer program which finds these closed orbits using Monte\nCarlo optimization with a shooting method, and applying a recently developed\nsymplectic integrator for nonseparable Hamiltonians. Our main result is the\ndiscovery of a family of flower-like periodic orbits with previously unknown\nsymmetry types. We encode these symmetry types as rational numbers and provide\nevidence that these periodic orbits densely populate a one-dimensional set of\ninitial conditions parametrized by the orbit's angular momentum. We provide\nlinks to all code developed.\n", "  A measurement of the differential cross sections for a W boson produced in\nassociation with jets in the muon decay channel is presented. The measurement\nis based on 13 TeV proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 2.2 inverse femtobarns, recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC.\nThe cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet\ntransverse momentum pT, jet rapidity, the scalar pT sum of the jets, and\nangular correlations between the muon and the jet for different jet\nmultiplicities. The measured cross sections are in agreement with predictions\nthat include multileg leading-order (LO) and next-to-LO matrix element\ncalculations interfaced with parton showers, as well as a next-to-next-to-LO\ncalculation for the W boson and one jet production.\n", "  Since Lorentz invariance plays an important role in modern physics, it is of\ninterest to test the possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). The time-lag\n(the arrival time delay between light curves in different energy bands) of\nGamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively used to this end. However, to our\nbest knowledge, one or more particular cosmological models were assumed {\\it a\npriori} in (almost) all of the relevant works in the literature. So, this makes\nthe results on LIV in those works model-dependent and hence not so robust in\nfact. In the present work, we try to avoid this problem by using a\nmodel-independent approach. We calculate the time delay induced by LIV with the\ncosmic expansion history given in terms of cosmography, without assuming any\nparticular cosmological model. Then, we constrain the possible LIV with the\nobservational data, and find weak hints for LIV.\n", "  A multi-parameter integrable deformation of the principal chiral model is\npresented. The Yang-Baxter and bi-Yang-Baxter sigma-models, the principal\nchiral model plus a Wess-Zumino term and the TsT transformation of the\nprincipal chiral model are all recovered when the appropriate deformation\nparameters vanish. When the Lie group is SU(2), we show that this\nfour-parameter integrable deformation of the SU(2) principal chiral model\ncorresponds to the Lukyanov model.\n", "  We study a question of presence of Kohn points, yielding at low temperatures\nnon-analytic momentum dependence of magnetic susceptibility near its maximum,\nin electronic spectum of some three-dimensional systems. In particular, we\nconsider one-band model on face centered cubic lattice with hopping between\nnearest and next-nearest neighbors, which models some aspects of the dispersion\nof ZrZn$_2$, and the two-band model on body centered cubic lattice, modeling\nthe dispersion of chromium. For the former model it is shown that Kohn points\nyielding maxima of susceptibility exist in a certain (sufficiently wide) region\nof electronic concentrations; the dependence of the wave vectors, corresponding\nto the maxima, on the chemical potential is investigated. For the two-band\nmodel we show existence of the lines of Kohn points, yielding maximum of the\nsusceptibility, which position agrees with the results of band structure\ncalculations and experimental data on the wave vector of antiferromagnetism of\nchromium.\n", "  We produce ${^{84}\\mathrm{Sr}_2}$ molecules using Bose-enhanced Raman\nphotoassociation. We apply the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)\ntechnique on a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to produce more than $8 \\times\n10^3$ ultracold molecules. This chemical reaction is only made possible because\nof the Bose enhancement of the optical transition dipole moment between the\ninitial atomic state and an intermediate molecular state. We study the effect\nof Bose enhancement by measuring the transition Rabi frequency in a BEC and by\ncomparing it with measurements for two atoms in sites of a Mott insulator. By\nbreaking the dimers' bond and directly observing the separated atoms, we\nmeasure the molecular inelastic collision rate parameters. We discuss the\npossibility of applying Bose-enhanced STIRAP to convert a BEC of atoms into a\nBEC of molecules, and argue that the required efficiency for STIRAP is within\nexperimental reach.\n", "  Certain alternative theories of gravity predict that gravitational waves will\ndisperse as they travel from the source to the observer. The recent binary\nblack hole observations by Advanced-LIGO have set limits on a modified\ndispersion relation from the constraints on their effects on gravitational-wave\npropagation. Using an identical modified dispersion, of the form\n$E^2=p^2c^2+{\\mathbb A}\\; p^{\\alpha} c^{\\alpha}$, where ${\\mathbb A}$ denotes\nthe magnitude of dispersion and $E$ and $p$ are the energy and momentum of the\ngravitational wave, we estimate the projected constraints on the modified\ndispersion from observations of compact binary mergers by third- generation\nground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer as\nwell as the space-based detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. We find\nthat third-generation detectors would bound dispersion of gravitational waves\nmuch better than their second-generation counterparts. The Laser Interferometer\nSpace Antenna, with its extremely good low-frequency sensitivity, would place\nstronger constraints than the ground-based detectors for $\\alpha \\leq 1$,\nwhereas for $\\alpha > 1$, the bounds are weaker. We also study the effect of\nthe spins of the compact binary constituents on the bounds.\n", "  We present a thorough classification of the isotropic quantum walks on\nlattices of dimension $d=1,2,3$ for cell dimension $s=2$. For $d=3$ there exist\ntwo isotropic walks, namely the Weyl quantum walks presented in Ref. [G. M.\nD'Ariano and P. Perinotti, Phys. Rev. A 90, 062106 (2014)], resulting in the\nderivation of the Weyl equation from informational principles. The present\nanalysis, via a crucial use of isotropy, is significantly shorter and avoids a\nsuperfluous technical assumption, making the result completely general.\n", "  In this work we present the results of our investigation about the\nthermodynamics of SU(2) gauge theory. We employ a Symanzik improved action to\nreduce strongly the discretisations effects, and we use the scaling relations\nto take into account the finite volume effects close to the critical\ntemperature. We determine the beta-function for this particular theory and we\nuse it in the determination of different thermodynamic observables. Finally we\ncompare our results with previous works where only the standard Wilson action\nwas considered. We confirm the relevance of using the improved action to access\neasily the correct continuum thermodynamics of the theory.\n", "  Above a certain solid fraction, dense granular suspensions in water exhibit\nnon-Newtonian behavior, including impact-activated solidification. Although it\nhas been suggested that solidification depends on boundary interactions,\nquantitative experiments on the boundary forces have not been reported. Using\nhigh-speed video, tracer particles, and photoelastic boundaries, we determine\nthe impactor kinematics and the magnitude and timings of impactor-driven events\nin the body and at the boundaries of cornstarch suspensions. We observe mass\nshocks in the suspension during impact. The shockfront dynamics are strongly\ncorrelated to those of the intruder. However, the total momentum associated\nwith this shock never approaches the initial impactor momentum. We also observe\na faster second front, associated with the propagation of pressure to the\nboundaries of the suspension. The two fronts depend differently on the initial\nimpactor speed, $v_0$, and the suspension packing fraction. The speed of the\npressure wave is at least an order of magnitude smaller than (linear)\nultrasound speeds obtained for much higher frequencies, pointing to complex\namplitude and frequency response of cornstarch suspensions to compressive\nstrains.\n", "  We study the non-leptonic two-body weak decays of $\\Lambda_c^+(2286)\\to {\\bf\nB}_n M$ with ${\\bf B}_n$ ($M$) representing as the baryon (meson) states. Based\non the $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry, we can describe most of the data reexamined by\nthe BESIII Collaboration with higher precisions. However, our result of ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to p\\pi^0)=(5.6\\pm 1.5)\\times 10^{-4}$ is larger than the\ncurrent experimental limit of $3\\times10^{-4}$ (90\\% C.L.) by BESIII. In\naddition, we find that ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to \\Sigma^+ K^0)=(8.0\\pm\n1.6)\\times 10^{-4}$, ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to \\Sigma^+\n\\eta^\\prime)=(1.0^{+1.6}_{-0.8})\\times 10^{-2}$, and ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_c^+ \\to\np \\eta^\\prime)=(12.2^{+14.3}_{-\\,\\,\\,8.7})\\times 10^{-4}$, which are accessible\nto the BESIII experiments.\n", "  We show that for a system of two entangled particles, there is a dual\ndescription to the particle equations in terms of classical theory of\nconformally stretched spacetime. We also connect these entangled particle\nequations with Finsler geometry. We show that this duality translates strongly\ncoupled quantum equations in the pilot-wave limit to weakly coupled geometric\nequations.\n", "  Chiral effective field theory is a framework to derive systematic nuclear\ninteractions. It is based on the symmetries of quantum chromodynamics and\nincludes long-range pion physics explicitly, while shorter-range physics is\nexpanded in a general operator basis. The number of low-energy couplings at a\nparticular order in the expansion can be reduced by exploiting the fact that\nnucleons are fermions and therefore obey the Pauli exclusion principle. The\nantisymmetry permits the selection of a subset of the allowed contact operators\nat a given order. When local regulators are used for these short-range\ninteractions, however, this \"Fierz rearrangement freedom\" is violated. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of this violation at leading order (LO) in the\nchiral expansion. We construct LO and next-to-leading order (NLO) potentials\nfor all possible LO-operator pairs and study their reproduction of phase\nshifts, the ${}^4$He ground-state energy, and the neutron-matter energy at\ndifferent densities. We demonstrate that the Fierz rearrangement freedom is\npartially restored at NLO where subleading contact interactions enter. We also\ndiscuss implications for local chiral three-nucleon interactions.\n", "  In power system operation, characterizing the stochastic nature of wind power\nis an important albeit challenging issue. It is well known that distributions\nof wind power forecast errors often exhibit significant variability with\nrespect to different forecast values. Therefore, appropriate probabilistic\nmodels that can provide accurate information for conditional forecast error\ndistributions are of great need. On the basis of Gaussian mixture model, this\npaper constructs analytical conditional distributions of forecast errors for\nmultiple wind farms with respect to forecast values. The accuracy of the\nproposed probabilistic models is verified by using historical data. Thereafter,\na fast sampling method is proposed to generate scenarios from the conditional\ndistributions which are non-Gaussian and interdependent. The efficiency of the\nproposed sampling method is verified.\n", "  We present a parametrization for the Dark Energy Equation of State \"EoS\"\nwhich has a rich structure, performing a transition at pivotal redshift $z_T$\nbetween the present day value $w_0$ to an early time $w_i=w_a+w_0\\equiv\nw(z\\gg0)$ with a steepness given in terms of $q$ parameter. The proposed\nparametrization is $w=w_0+w_a(z/z_T)^q/(1+(z/z_T))^q$, with $w_0$, $w_i$, $q $\nand $z_T$ constant parameters. It reduces to the widely used EoS\n$w=w_0+w_a(1-a)$ for $z_T=q=1$. This transition is motivated by scalar field\ndynamics such as for example quintessence models. We study if a late time\ntransition is favored by BAO measurements combined with local determination of\n$H_0$ and information from the CMB. According to our results, an EoS with a\npresent value of $w_0 = -0.92$ and a high redshift value $w_i =-0.99$,\nfeaturing a transition at $z_T = 0.28$ with an exponent $q = 9.97$ was favored\nby data coming from local dynamics of the Universe (BAO combined with $H_0$\ndetermination). We find that a dynamical DE model allows to simultaneously fit\n$H_0$ from local determinations and Planck CMB measurements, alleviating the\ntension obtained in a $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n  Additionally to this analysis we solved numerically the evolution of matter\nover-densities in the presence of dark energy both at background level and when\nits perturbations were considered. We show that the presence of a steep\ntransition in the DE EoS gets imprinted into the evolution of matter\noverdensities and that the addition of an effective sound speed term does not\nerase such feature.\n", "  The negatively-charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^-$) color center in diamond has\nrecently emerged as a promising system for quantum photonics. Its\nsymmetry-protected optical transitions enable creation of indistinguishable\nemitter arrays and deterministic coupling to nanophotonic devices. Despite\nthis, the longest coherence time associated with its electronic spin achieved\nto date ($\\sim 250$ ns) has been limited by coupling to acoustic phonons. We\ndemonstrate coherent control and suppression of phonon-induced dephasing of the\nSiV$^-$ electronic spin coherence by five orders of magnitude by operating at\ntemperatures below 500 mK. By aligning the magnetic field along the SiV$^-$\nsymmetry axis, we demonstrate spin-conserving optical transitions and\nsingle-shot readout of the SiV$^-$ spin with 89% fidelity. Coherent control of\nthe SiV$^-$ spin with microwave fields is used to demonstrate a spin coherence\ntime $T_2$ of 13 ms and a spin relaxation time $T_1$ exceeding 1 s at 100 mK.\nThese results establish the SiV$^-$ as a promising solid-state candidate for\nthe realization of scalable quantum networks.\n", "  With the fast growth of wind power penetration, power systems need additional\nflexibility to cope with wind power ramping. Several electricity markets have\nestablished requirements for flexible ramping capacity (FRC) reserves. This\npaper addresses two crucial issues that have rarely been discussed in the\nliterature: 1) how to characterize wind power ramping under different forecast\nvalues and 2) how to achieve a reasonable trade-off between operational risks\nand FRC costs. Regarding the first issue, this paper proposes a concept of\nconditional distributions of wind power ramping, which is empirically verified\nby using simulation and real-world data. For the second issue, this paper\ndevelops an adjustable chance-constrained approach to optimally allocate FRC\nreserves. Equivalent tractable forms of the original problem are devised to\nimprove computational efficiency. Tests carried out on a modified IEEE 118-bus\nsystem demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\n", "  A search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson or dark matter candidates\nproduced in association with a leptonically decaying $Z$ boson in\nproton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV is presented. This search uses\n36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider. No significant deviation from the expectation of the Standard Model\nbackgrounds is observed. Assuming the Standard Model $ZH$ production\ncross-section, an observed (expected) upper limit of 67% (39%) at the 95%\nconfidence level is set on the branching ratio of invisible decays of the Higgs\nboson with mass $m_H = $ 125 GeV. The corresponding limits on the production\ncross-section of the $ZH$ process with the invisible Higgs boson decays are\nalso presented. Furthermore, exclusion limits on the dark matter candidate and\nmediator masses are reported in the framework of simplified dark matter models.\n", "  Relativistic invariance is a physical law verified in several domains of\nphysics. The impossibility of faster than light influences is not questioned by\nquantum theory. In quantum electrodynamics, in quantum field theory and in the\nstandard model relativistic invariance is incorporated by construction. Quantum\nmechanics predicts strong long range correlations between outcomes of spin\nprojection measurements performed in distant laboratories. In spite of these\nstrong correlations marginal probability distributions should not depend on\nwhat was measured in the other laboratory what is called shortly:\nnon-signalling. In several experiments, performed to test various Bell-type\ninequalities, some unexplained dependence of empirical marginal probability\ndistributions on distant settings was observed . In this paper we demonstrate\nhow a particular identification and selection procedure of paired distant\noutcomes is the most probable cause for this apparent violation of\nno-signalling principle. Thus this unexpected setting dependence does not prove\nthe existence of superluminal influences and Einsteinian no-signalling\nprinciple has to be tested differently in dedicated experiments. We propose a\ndetailed protocol telling how such experiments should be designed in order to\nbe conclusive. We also explain how magical quantum correlations may be\nexplained in a locally causal way.\n", "  Starting from the Vlasov-Maxwell equations describing the dynamics of various\nspecies in a quasi-neutral plasma, an exact relativistic hydrodynamic closure\nfor a special type of water-bag distributions satisfying the Vlasov equation\nhas been derived. It has been shown that the set of equations for the\nmacroscopic hydrodynamic variables coupled to the wave equations for the\nself-consistent electromagnetic field is fully equivalent to the Vlasov-Maxwell\nsystem.\n  Based on the method of multiple scales, a system comprising a vector\nnonlinear Schrodinger equation for the transverse envelopes of the\nself-consistent plasma wakefield, coupled to a scalar nonlinear Schrodinger\nequation for the electron current velocity envelope, has been derived.\n  Using the method of formal series of Dubois-Violette, a traveling wave\nsolution of the derived set of coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations in the\ncase of circular wave polarization has been obtained. This solution is\nrepresented as a ratio of two formal Volterra series. The terms of these series\ncan be calculated explicitly to every desired order.\n", "  We have considered a model of Dark Minimal Flavour Violation (DMFV), in which\na triplet of dark matter particles couple to right-handed up-type quarks via a\nheavy colour-charged scalar mediator. By studying a large spectrum of possible\nconstraints, and assessing the entire parameter space using a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC), we can place strong restrictions on the allowed parameter\nspace for dark matter models of this type.\n", "  Single crystals have high atomic electric fields as much as 10^{11} V/m,\nwhich correspond to magnetic fields of \\sim 10^3 T. These fields can be\nutilized to convert X rays into Axion Like Particles (ALPs) coherently similar\nto X-ray diffraction. In this paper, we perform the first theoretical\ncalculation of the Laue-case conversion in crystals based on the Darwin\ndynamical theory of X-ray diffraction. The calculation shows that the Laue-case\nconversion has longer interaction length than the Bragg case, and that ALPs in\nthe keV range can be resonantly converted by tuning an incident angle of X\nrays. ALPs with mass up to O(10 keV) can be searched by\nLight-Shining-through-a-Wall (LSW) experiments at synchrotron X-ray facilities.\n", "  Recently reported [Eur. Phys. J. C., ${\\bf 77}$, 549 (2017)]\ngravitoelectromagnetic equations of Ummarino and Gallerati (UG) in their\nlinearized version of General Relativity (GR) are shown to match with (a) our\npreviously reported special relativistic Maxwellian Gravity equations in the\nnon-relativistic limit and with (b) the non-relativistic equations derived\nhere, when the speed of gravity $c_g$ (an undetermined parameter of the theory\nhere) is set equal to $c$ (the speed of light in vacuum). Seen in the light of\nour new results, the UG equations satisfy the Correspondence Principle (cp),\nwhile many other versions of linearized GR equations that are being (or may be)\nused to interpret the experimental data defy the cp. Such new findings assume\nsignificance and relevance in the contexts of recent detection of gravitational\nwaves and the gravitomagnetic field of the spinning earth and their\ninterpretations. Being well-founded and self-consistent, the equations may be\nof interest and useful to researchers exploring the phenomenology of\ngravitomagnetism, gravitational waves and the novel interplay of gravity with\ndifferent states of matter in flat space-time like UG's interesting work on\nsuperconductors in weak gravitational fields.\n", "  We calculate the quantum correlator in Schwarzschild black hole space-time.\nWe perform the calculation for a scalar field in three different quantum\nstates: Boulware, Unruh and Hartle-Hawking, and for points along a timelike\ncircular geodesic. The results show that the correlator presents a global\nfourfold singularity structure, which is state-independent. Our results also\nshow the different correlations in the three different quantum states arising\nin-between the singularities.\n", "  Plastic scintillator detectors have been studied as dosimeters, since they\nprovide a cost-effective alternative to conventional ionization chambers. On\nthe other hand, several articles have reported undesired response dependencies\non beam energy and temperature, which enhances the necessity to determine\nappropriate correction factors. In this work, we studied the light yield\ntemperature dependency of four plastic scintillators (BCF-10, BCF-60, BC-404\nand RP-200A) and two clear fibers (BCF-98 and SK-80). Measurements were made\nusing a 50 kVp X-ray beam to produce the scintillation and/or radioluminescence\nsignal. The 0 to 40 degrees celsius range was scanned for each scintillator,\nand temperature coefficients obtained.\n", "  We report on an 800 nm femtosecond laser beam induced giant refractive index\nmodulation and enhancement of near-infrared transparency in topological\ninsulator material Bi2Te3 thin films. An ultrahigh refractive index of up to\n5.9 was observed in the Bi2Te3 thin film in near-infrared frequency. The\nrefractive index dramatically decreases by a factor of ~ 3 by an exposure to\nthe 800 nm femtosecond laser beam. Simultaneously, the transmittance of the\nBi2Te3 thin films markedly increases to ~ 96% in the near-infrared frequency.\nThe Raman spectra provides strong evidences that the observed both refractive\nindex modulation and transparency enhancement result from laser beam induced\nphotooxidation effects in the Bi2Te3 thin films. The Bi2Te3 compound transfers\ninto Bi2O3 and TeO2 under the laser beam illumination. These experimental\nresults pave the way towards the design of various optical devices, such as\nnear-infrared flat lenses, waveguide and holograms, based on topological\ninsulator materials.\n", "  The one-dimensional time-independent Green's function $G_0$ of a quantum\nsimple harmonic oscillator system ($V_0(x)=m \\omega^2 x^2/2$) can be obtained\nby solving the equation directly. It has a compact expression, which gives\ncorrect eigenvalues and eigenfunctions easily. The Green's function $G$ with an\nadditional delta-function potential can be obtained readily. The same technics\nof solving the Green's function $G_0$ can be used to solve the eigenvalue\nproblem of the simple harmonic oscillator with an generic delta-function\npotential at an arbitrary site, i.e. $V_1(x)\\propto \\delta(x-a)$. The\nWronskians play an important and interesting role in the above studies.\nFurthermore, the approach can be easily generalized to solve the quantum system\nof a simple harmonic oscillator with two or more generic delta-function\npotentials. We give the solutions of the case with two additional\ndelta-functions for illustration.\n", "  Recently, a cooling scheme for ultracold atoms in a bilayer optical lattice\nhas been proposed [A. Kantian et al., arXiv:1609.03579]. In their scheme, the\nenergy offset between the two layers is increased dynamically such that the\nentropy of one layer is transferred to the other layer. Using the\nfull-Hilbert-space approach, we compute cooling dynamics subjected to the\nscheme in order to show that their scheme fails to cool down two-component\nfermions. We develop an alternative cooling scheme for two-component fermions,\nin which the spin-exchange interaction of one layer is significantly reduced.\nUsing both full-Hilbert-space and matrix-product-state approaches, we find that\nour scheme can decrease the temperature of the other layer by roughly half.\n", "  We present a microfluidic platform for two-dimensional manipulation of water\ndroplets immersed in bulk oil-based ferrofluid. Although non-magnetic, the\ndroplets are exclusively controlled by magnetic fields, without any\npressure-driven flow. The diphasic fluid layer is trapped in a submillimeter\nHele-Shaw chamber that includes permalloy tracks on its substrate. An in-plane\nrotating magnetic field magnetizes the permalloy tracks, thus producing local\nmagnetic gradients, while an orthogonal magnetic field magnetizes the bulk\nferrofluid. To minimize the magnetostatic energy of the system, droplets are\nattracted towards the locations of the tracks where ferrofluid is repelled.\nUsing this technique, we demonstrate synchronous generation and propagation of\nwater droplets, analyze PIV data of the bulk ferrofluid flow and study the\nkinematics of propagation. In addition, we show controlled break-up of droplets\nand droplet-to-droplet interactions. Finally, we discuss future applications\nowing to the potential biocompatibility of the droplets.\n", "  This memo contains a collection of formulas describing the electromagnetic\nenergy, momentum and spin distribution of an optical field formed in dielectric\nmedia separated by a plane interface when an incident monochromatic plane wave\nis totally reflected. The formulas are based on the Abraham momentum definition\nand include the momentum decomposition into the orbital (canonical) and spin\nparts as well as explicit dual-symmetric separation of the electric and\nmagnetic contributions. This material was prepared in February 2013 but it had\nnot been finalized and published because of the difficulties in physical\ninterpretation of singular terms in the spin and orbital momentum expressions\nassociated with the sharp interface. Meanwhile, it has become clear that the\n\"naive\" Abraham approach is not correct for this problem and the\nelectromagnetic spin and momentum in inhomogeneous media are better\ncharacterized by the more elaborated relations based on the Minkowski paradigm\n[see, e.g., Phys. Rev. A 83, 013823 (2011); 86, 055802 (2012);\narXiv:1706.05493]. In application to the total-reflection situation this\nMinkowski-based description was recently illustrated in arXiv:1706.06263, so\nthe present material is mainly of historical interest. However, it seems useful\nto make it known for a wide audience, at least for comparison with the recent\nimproved approaches and for suitable references. The last section, treating the\nponderomotive action experienced by a Mie particle in the evanescent wave, is\nindependent of the Abraham - Minkowski controversy. The numerical calculations\npreserve their validity, and association of the various force and torque\ncomponents with corresponding components of the optical momentum and spin\nremains legal in the Minkowski pattern. The results of the last section were\npartly used in other published works [e.g., Nature Commun. 5, 3300 (2014)].\n", "  By studying an explicit analytical solution of the Coulomb problem on the\nlattice we demonstrate a breakdown of perturbative matching for the description\nof the Coulomb artifacts in lattice NRQCD, which leads to a large systematic\nerror in the predictions for the heavy quarkonium spectrum. The breakdown is a\nresult of a fine interplay between the short and long distance effects specific\nto the lattice regularization of NRQCD. We show how the problem can be solved\nwithin the Schrodinger matching procedure.\n", "  Motivated by the physics of Pr-based cobaltites, we study the effect of the\nexternal magnetic field in the hole-doped two-band Hubbard model close to\ninstabilities toward the excitonic condensation and ferromagnetic ordering.\nUsing the dynamical mean-field theory we observe a field-driven suppression of\nthe excitonic condensate. The onset of a magnetically ordered phase at the\nfixed chemical potential is accompanied by a sizable change of the electron\ndensity. This leads us to predict that Pr$^{3+}$ abundance increases on the\nhigh-field side of the transition.\n", "  Surges often appear as a result of the emergence of magnetized plasma from\nthe solar interior. Traditionally, they are observed in chromospheric lines\nsuch as H$\\alpha$ 6563 \\AA and Ca II 8542 \\AA. However, whether there is a\nresponse to the surge appearance and evolution in the Si IV lines or, in fact,\nin many other transition region lines has not been studied. In this paper we\nanalyze a simultaneous episode of an H$\\alpha$ surge and a Si IV burst that\noccurred on 2016 September 03 in active region AR12585. To that end, we use\ncoordinated observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS)\nand the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). For the first time, we report\nemission of Si IV within the surge, finding profiles that are brighter and\nbroader than the average. Furthermore, the brightest Si IV patches within the\ndomain of the surge are located mainly near its footpoints. To understand the\nrelation between the surges and the emission in transition region lines like Si\nIV, we have carried out 2.5D radiative MHD (RMHD) experiments of magnetic flux\nemergence episodes using the Bifrost code and including the non-equilibrium\nionization of silicon. Through spectral synthesis we explain several features\nof the observations. We show that the presence of Si IV emission patches within\nthe surge, their location near the surge footpoints and various observed\nspectral features are a natural consequence of the emergence of magnetized\nplasma from the interior to the atmosphere and the ensuing reconnection\nprocesses.\n", "  Super-massive black holes weighing up to $\\sim 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$\nare in place by $z \\sim 7$, when the age of the Universe is $\\lesssim 1 \\,\n\\mathrm{Gyr}$. This implies a time crunch for their growth, since such high\nmasses cannot be easily reached in standard accretion scenarios. Here, we\nexplore the physical conditions that would lead to optimal growth wherein\nstable super-Eddington accretion would be permitted. Our analysis suggests that\nthe preponderance of optimal conditions depends on two key parameters: the\nblack hole mass and the host galaxy central gas density. In the high-efficiency\nregion of this parameter space, a continuous stream of gas can accrete onto the\nblack hole from large to small spatial scales, assuming a global isothermal\nprofile for the host galaxy. Using analytical initial mass functions for black\nhole seeds, we find an enhanced probability of high-efficiency growth for seeds\nwith initial masses $\\gtrsim 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. Our picture suggests\nthat a large population of high-$z$ lower-mass black holes that formed in the\nlow-efficiency region, with low duty cycles and accretion rates, might remain\nundetectable as quasars, since we predict their bolometric luminosities to be\n$\\lesssim 10^{41} \\, \\mathrm{erg \\, s^{-1}}$. The presence of these sources\nmight be revealed only via gravitational wave detections of their mergers.\n", "  The coarse-graining approach to deriving the quantum Markovian master\nequation is revisited, with close attention given to the underlying\napproximations. It is further argued that the time interval over which the\ncoarse-graining is performed is a free parameter that can be given a physical\nmeasurement-based interpretation. In the case of the damping of composite\nsystems to reservoirs of different temperatures, currently of much interest in\nthe study of quantum thermal machines with regard to the validity of `local'\nand `global' forms of these equations, the coupling of the subsystems leads to\na further timescale with respect to which the coarse-graining time interval can\nbe chosen. Different choices lead to different master equations that correspond\nto the local and global forms. These can be then understood as having different\nphysical interpretations based on the role of the coarse-graining, as well as\ndifferent limitations in application.\n", "  We present the first detailed study of the Electron Capture Supernova Channel\n(ECSN Channel) for a primary star in a close binary star system. Progenitors of\nECSN occupy the lower end of the mass spectrum of supernovae progenitors and\nare thought to form the transition between white dwarfs progenitors and core\ncollapse progenitors. The mass range for ECSN from close binary systems is\nthought to be wider than the range for single stars, because of the effects of\nmass transfer on the helium core. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we\nexplored the parameter space of initial primary masses between 8 $M_\\odot$ and\n17 $M_\\odot$, using a large grid of models. We find that the initial primary\nmass and the mass transfer evolution are important factors in the final fate of\nstars in this mass range. Mass transfer due to Roche Lobe overflow during and\nafter carbon burning causes the core to cool down so that it avoids neon\nignition, even in helium-free cores with masses up to 1.52 $M_\\odot$, which in\nsingle stars would ignite neon. If the core is able to contract to high enough\ndensities for electron captures to commence, we find that, for the adopted\nLedoux convection criterion, the initial mass range for the primary to evolve\ninto an ECSN is between 13.5 $M_\\odot$ and 17.6 $M_\\odot$. The mass ratio,\ninitial period, and mass loss efficiency only marginally affect the predicted\nranges.\n", "  We review some of the recent progress in our knowledge about high-energy\ncosmic rays, with an emphasis on the interpretation of the different\nobservational results. We discuss the effects that are relevant to shape the\ncosmic ray spectrum and the explanations proposed to account for its features\nand for the observed changes in composition. The physics of air-showers is\nsummarized and we also present the results obtained on the proton-air cross\nsection and on the muon content of the showers. We discuss the cosmic ray\npropagation through magnetic fields, the effects of diffusion and of magnetic\nlensing, the cosmic ray interactions with background radiation fields and the\nproduction of secondary neutrinos and photons. We also consider the cosmic ray\nanisotropies, both at large and small angular scales, presenting the results\nobtained from the TeV up to the highest energies and discuss the models\nproposed to explain their origin.\n", "  We report experimental measurements and theoretical analysis of Shubnikov-de\nHaas (SdH) oscillations in a Dirac cone system: the a-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 organic\nmetal under hydrostatic pressure. The measured SdH oscillations reveal\nanomalies at high magnetic fields B where the 1/B oscillations periodicity is\nlost above 7 T. We interpret these unusual results within a theoretical model\nthat takes into account intrinsic distortions of the a-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 Dirac\ncones such as a parabolic particle-hole asymmetric correction. Others possible\ncauses, such as a cone tilting or a Zeeman effect, are carefully ruled out. The\nobservations are consistent among a-(BEDT-TTF)2I3 samples with different Fermi\nlevels.\n", "  The radial velocity method is one of the most successful techniques for\ndetecting exoplanets. It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced\nby the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity\nalong our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star. As\nastronomical instrumentation has improved, radial velocity surveys have become\nsensitive to low-mass planets that cause their host star to move with radial\nvelocities of 1 m/s or less. While analysis of a time series of stellar spectra\ncan in theory reveal such small radial velocities, in practice intrinsic\nstellar variability (e.g., star spots, convective motion, pulsations) affects\nthe spectra and often mimics a radial velocity signal. This signal\ncontamination makes it difficult to reliably detect low mass planets and\nplanets orbiting magnetically active stars. A principled approach to recovering\nplanet radial velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed\nby Rajpaul et al. (2015) and involves the use of a multivariate Gaussian\nprocess model to jointly capture time series of the apparent radial velocity\nand multiple indicators of stellar activity. We build on this work in two ways:\n(i) we propose using dimension reduction techniques to construct more\ninformative stellar activity indicators that make use of a larger portion of\nthe stellar spectrum; (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a\nlarger class of models and use a model comparison procedure to select the best\nmodel for the particular stellar activity indicators at hand. By combining our\nhigh-information stellar activity indicators, Gaussian process models, and\nmodel selection procedure, we achieve substantially improved planet detection\npower compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.\n", "  InGaAs/InP single-photon detectors (SPDs) are the key devices for\napplications requiring near-infrared single-photon detection. Gating mode is an\neffective approach to synchronous single-photon detection. Increasing gating\nfrequency and reducing module size are important challenges for the design of\nsuch detector system. Here we present for the first time an InGaAs/InP SPD with\n1.25 GHz sine wave gating using a monolithically integrated readout circuit\n(MIRC). The MIRC has a size of 15 mm * 15 mm and implements the miniaturization\nof avalanche extraction for high-frequency sine wave gating. In the MIRC,\nlow-pass filters and a low-noise radio frequency amplifier are integrated based\non the technique of low temperature co-fired ceramic, which can effectively\nreduce the parasitic capacitance and extract weak avalanche signals. We then\ncharacterize the InGaAs/InP SPD to verify the functionality and reliability of\nMIRC, and the SPD exhibits excellent performance with 27.5 % photon detection\nefficiency, 1.2 kcps dark count rate, and 9.1 % afterpulse probability at 223 K\nand 100 ns hold-off time. With this MIRC, one can further design miniaturized\nhigh-frequency SPD modules that are highly required for practical applications.\n", "  We use our semi-analytic solution of the nonlinear force-free field equation\nto construct three-dimensional magnetic fields that are applicable to the solar\ncorona and study their statistical properties for estimating the degree of\nbraiding exhibited by these fields. We present a new formula for calculating\nthe winding number and compare it with the formula for the crossing number. The\ncomparison is shown for a toy model of two helices and for realistic cases of\nnonlinear force-free fields; conceptually the formulae are nearly the same but\nthe resulting distributions calculated for a given topology can be different.\nWe also calculate linkages, which are useful topological quantities that are\nindependent measures of the contribution of magnetic braiding to the total free\nenergy and relative helicity of the field. Finally, we derive new analytical\nbounds for the free energy and relative helicity for the field configurations\nin terms of the linking number. These bounds will be of utility in estimating\nthe braided energy available for nano-flares or for eruptions.\n", "  We study a model that extends the Georgi-Machacek model by the addition of an\ninert doublet, $\\Phi_2$. This allows for the model to contain a natural dark\nmatter candidate, $H^0$. For a number of benchmark points at two DM candidate\nmasses ($m_{H^0} \\in \\{70,\\,250\\}$ GeV), we determine the relic abundance,\ndirect detection cross section, and collider constraints. We find that the\ncollider studies used do not constrain the model. For the parameter region\nchosen, the points are ruled out by direct detection experimental results. At\nthe lower mass point, we do not find a viable parameter point, while at the\nhigher mass we do find an additional point that satisfies all the applied\nconstraints.\n", "  We report a non-perturbative study of the effects of shear flows on\nturbulence reduction in a decaying turbulence in two dimensions. By considering\ndifferent initial power spectra and shear flows (zonal flows, combined zonal\nflows and streamers), we demonstrate how shear flows rapidly generate small\nscales, leading to a fast damping of turbulence amplitude. In particular, a\ndouble exponential decrease in turbulence amplitude is shown to occur due to an\nexponential increase in wavenumber. The scaling of the effective dissipation\ntime scale $\\tau_{e}$, previously taken to be a hybrid time scale $\\tau_{e}\n\\propto \\tau_{\\Omega}^{{2/3}} \\tau_{\\eta}$, is shown to depend on types of\ndepend on the type of shear flow as well as the initial power spectrum. Here,\n$\\tau_{\\Omega}$ and $\\tau_{\\eta}$ are shearing and molecular diffusion times,\nrespectively. Furthermore, we present time-dependent Probability Density\nFunctions (PDFs) and discuss the effect of enhanced dissipation on PDFs and a\ndynamical time scale $\\tau(t)$, which represents the time scale over which a\nsystem passes through statistically different states.\n", "  Within wall turbulence, there is a sublayer where the mean velocity and the\nvariance of velocity fluctuations vary logarithmically with the height from the\nwall. This logarithmic scaling is also known for the mean concentration of a\npassive scalar. By using heat as such a scalar in a laboratory experiment of a\nturbulent boundary layer, the existence of the logarithmic scaling is shown\nhere for the variance of fluctuations of the scalar concentration. It is\nreproduced by a model of energy-containing eddies that are attached to the\nwall.\n", "  Misinformation and rumor can spread rapidly and widely through online social\nnetworks and therefore rumor controlling has become a critical issue. It is\noften assumed that there is a single authority whose goal is to minimize the\nspread of rumor by generating a positive cascade. In this paper, we study a\nmore realistic scenario when there are multiple positive cascades generated by\ndifferent agents. For the multiple-cascade diffusion, we propose the P2P\nindependent cascade (PIC) model for private social communications. The main\npart of this paper is an analysis of the rumor blocking effect (i.e. the number\nof the users activated by rumor) when the agents non-cooperatively generate the\npositive cascades. We show that the rumor blocking effect provided by the Nash\nequilibrium will not be arbitrarily worse even if the positive cascades are\ngenerated non-cooperatively. In addition, we give a discussion on how the\ncascade priority and activation order affect the rumor blocking problem. We\nexperimentally examine the Nash equilibrium of the proposed games by\nsimulations done on real social network structures.\n", "  In order to allow a better understanding of the origin of Galactic field\npopulations, dynamical equivalence of stellar-dynamical systems has been\npostulated by Kroupa and Belloni et al. to allow mapping of solutions of the\ninitial conditions of embedded clusters such that they yield, after a period of\ndynamical processing, the Galactic field population. Dynamically equivalent\nsystems are defined to initially and finally have the same distribution\nfunctions of periods, mass ratios and eccentricities of binary stars. Here we\nsearch for dynamically equivalent clusters using the {\\sc mocca} code. The\nsimulations confirm that dynamically equivalent solutions indeed exist. The\nresult is that the solution space is next to identical to the radius--mass\nrelation of Marks \\& Kroupa, $\\left( r_h/{\\rm pc} \\right)=\n0.1^{+0.07}_{-0.04}\\, \\left( M_{\\rm ecl}/{\\rm M}_\\odot \\right)^{0.13\\pm0.04}$.\nThis relation is in good agreement with the observed density of molecular cloud\nclumps. According to the solutions, the time-scale to reach dynamical\nequivalence is about 0.5~Myr which is, interestingly, consistent with the\nlifetime of ultra-compact HII regions and the time-scale needed for gas\nexpulsion to be active in observed very young clusters as based on their\ndynamical modelling.\n", "  A superconductor of paired protons is thought to form in the core of neutron\nstars soon after their birth. Minimum energy conditions suggest magnetic flux\nis expelled from the superconducting region due to the Meissner effect, such\nthat the neutron star core is largely devoid of magnetic fields for some\nnuclear equation of state and proton pairing models. We show via neutron star\ncooling simulations that the superconducting region expands faster than flux is\nexpected to be expelled because cooling timescales are much shorter than\ntimescales of magnetic field diffusion. Thus magnetic fields remain in the bulk\nof the neutron star core for at least 10^6-10^7 yr. We estimate the size of\nflux free regions at 10^7 yr to be <~ 100 m for a magnetic field of 10^11 G and\npossibly smaller for stronger field strengths. For proton pairing models that\nare narrow, magnetic flux may be completely expelled from a thin shell of\napproximately the above size after 10^5 yr. This shell may insulate lower\nconductivity outer layers, where magnetic fields can diffuse and decay faster,\nfrom fields maintained in the highly conducting deep core.\n", "  Ultrafast emission rates obtained from quantum emitters coupled to plasmonic\nnanoantennas have recently opened fundamentally new possibilities in quantum\ninformation and sensing applications. Plasmonic nanoantennas greatly improve\nthe brightness of quantum emitters by dramatically shortening their\nfluorescence lifetimes. Gap plasmonic nanocavities that support strongly\nconfined modes are of particular interest for such applications. We demonstrate\nsingle-photon emission from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds\ncoupled to nanosized gap plasmonic cavities with internal mode volumes about 10\n000 times smaller than the cubic vacuum wavelength. The resulting structures\nfeatures sub-nanosecond NV excited-state lifetimes and detected photon rates up\nto 50 million counts per second. Analysis of the fluorescence saturation allows\nthe extraction of the multi-order excitation rate enhancement provided by the\nnanoantenna. Efficiency analysis shows that the NV center is producing up to\n0.25 billion photons per second in the far-field.\n", "  Based on the first-principles study, we report a new set of topological\nsemimetals (TiS, TiSe, TiTe, HfS, HfSe, HfTe and ZrS) which show the\nco-existence of a nodal-ring and triply-degenerate points. The two-fold\ndegenerate one-dimensional nodal ring structure in the bulk Brillouin zone\nexhibits the characteristic drumhead surface states. In addition to this, a\npeculiar band crossing along the $k_z$ direction takes place consisting of a\npoint-crossing with three-fold band degeneracy. These triply-degenerate points\ngive rise to \"nexus\" fermions as quasiparticles having no analogous elementary\nparticle of the standard model. In this article, we simulate angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy to obtain the exotic topological surface states and\nthe characteristic Fermi arcs, and explain the evolution and separation of\ntriple-points with the magnitude of spin-orbit coupling. This intermediate\nlinearly dispersive degeneracy between Weyl and Dirac points may offer\nprospective candidates for quantum transport applications.\n", "  We propose a connection between the butterfly velocity and the complexity\ngrowth rate in the context of thermodynamics of black holes where the\ncosmological constant is interpreted as thermodynamic pressure. Moreover, we\nstudy the bound on the diffusion coefficient by comparing with the bound on\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio in order to obtain a relationship\nbetween the diffusion coefficient times pressure with the shear viscosity. Our\nresult shows that there is the upper bound on complexity growth rate with\nrespect to the shear viscosity and thermodynamical variables.\n", "  The modulation transfer function (MTF) represents the frequency domain\nresponse of imaging modalities. Here, we report a method for estimating the MTF\nfrom sample images. Test images were generated from a number of images,\nincluding those taken with an electron microscope and with an observation\nsatellite. These original images were convolved with point spread functions\n(PSFs) including those of circular apertures. The resultant test images were\nsubjected to a Fourier transformation. The logarithm of the squared norm of the\nFourier transform was plotted against the squared distance from the origin.\nLinear correlations were observed in the logarithmic plots, indicating that the\nPSF of the test images can be approximated with a Gaussian. The MTF was then\ncalculated from the Gaussian-approximated PSF. The obtained MTF closely\ncoincided with the MTF predicted from the original PSF. The MTF of an x-ray\nmicrotomographic section of a fly brain was also estimated with this method.\nThe obtained MTF showed good agreement with the MTF determined from an edge\nprofile of an aluminum test object. We suggest that this approach is an\nalternative way of estimating the MTF, independently of the image type.\n", "  In this paper we employ the Horava-Lifshitz black holes solutions and obtain\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian. It helps us to take new variables and it will be\nwritten by harmonic oscillator form. This leads us to apply non-commutative\ngeometry to the new Hamiltonian and obtain the corresponding Lagrangian. And\nthen, we take some information from Finsler geometry and write the Lagrangian\nof the different kinds of Horava-Lifshitz black holes. We show that the\ncorresponding Lagrangian in non-commutative and Finsler geometry for above\nmentioned black holes completely coincidence together with some specification\nof parameters. But in case of rotation, the place of center of mass energy\ncompletely different, so the particle goes to inside of black hole rapidly\nwithout falling into singularity. So in that case, two Lagrangians cover each\nother at $0<r<r_h.$\n", "  Experimental and theoretical results of the $P_{\\mathrm{CN}}$ fusion\nprobability of reactants in the entrance channel and the $W_{\\mathrm{sur}}$\nsurvival probability against fission at deexcitation of the compound nucleus\nformed in heavy-ion collisions are discussed. The theoretical results for a set\nof nuclear reactions leading to formation of compound nuclei (CNs) with the\ncharge number $Z=102\\text{--}122$ reveal a strong sensitivity of\n$P_{\\mathrm{CN}}$ to the characteristics of colliding nuclei in the entrance\nchannel, dynamics of the reaction mechanism, and excitation energy of the\nsystem. We discuss the validity of assumptions and procedures for analysis of\nexperimental data, and also the limits of validity of theoretical results\nobtained by the use of phenomenological models. The comparison of results\nobtained in many investigated reactions reveals serious limits of validity of\nthe data analysis and calculation procedures.\n", "  We propose to relate dark matter stability to the possible Dirac nature of\nneutrinos. The idea is illustrated in a simple scheme where small Dirac\nneutrino masses arise from a type-I seesaw mechanism as a result of a $Z_4$\ndiscrete lepton number symmetry. The latter implies the existence of a viable\nWIMP dark matter candidate, whose stability arises from the same symmetry which\nensures the Diracness of neutrinos. The symmetry groups $\\Delta_{27}$ and $A_4$\nare then used to extract a rich variety of flavour predictions.\n", "  The positive parity $\\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ charmonium states are expected to lie\naround the 3.9 GeV/$c^2$ energy region, according to the predictions of quark\nmodels. However, a plethora of states with difficult assignment and\nunconventional properties have been discovered over the years, i.e., the\n$X(3872)$, $X(3940)$, $Y(3940)$, $X(3915)$, $X(3860)$ and the $X(3930)$\nresonances, which complicates the description of this intriguing region.\n  In this work we analyze the $0^{++}$ and $2^{++}$ sectors, employing a\ncoupled-channels formalism successfully applied to the $1^{++}$ sector, where\nthe $X(3872)$ was described as a $D\\bar D^\\ast+h.c.$ molecule with a sizable\n$c\\bar c$ $(2^3P_1)$ component. This coupled-channels formalism is based on a\nwidely-used Constituent Quark Model, which describes the quark-quark\ninteractions, and the $^3P_0$ quark pair creation mechanism, used to couple the\ntwo and four quark sectors.\n  The recent controversy about the quantum numbers of the $X(3915)$ state, the\nproperties of the $X(3930)$ one and the nature of the new $X(3860)$ resonance\nare analyzed in a unified theoretical framework, being all the parameters\ncompletely constrained from previous calculations in the low-lying heavy\nquarkonium phenomenology.\n", "  The DAMPE experiment has recently reported strong indications for the\nexistence of an excess of high-energy electrons and positrons. If interpreted\nin terms of the annihilation of dark matter, the DAMPE result restricts the\ndark matter mass and possible annihilation channels to a few case. In this\npaper we explain the DAMPE result with the electron-flavored $Z^\\prime$-portal\nfermionic dark matter. We show that the Dirac dark matter scenario is promising\nto explain the excess via the process $\\bar \\chi \\chi \\to\\mathbf{Z}'\\to \\bar e\ne$. The reduced annihilation cross section is limited in a range of\n$10^{-26}\\sim 10^{-24}~{\\rm cm^3 s^{-1}}$ to interpret the excess.\n", "  We explain the electron-positron excess reported by the DAMPE collaboration\nrecently in a radiative Dirac seesaw model where a dark $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry\ncan (i) forbid the tree-level Yukawa couplings of three right-handed neutrinos\nto the standard model lepton and Higgs doublets, (ii) predict the existence of\nthree dark fermions for the gauge anomaly cancellation, (iii) mediate a\ntestable scattering of the lightest dark fermion off the nucleons. Our model\ncan also accommodate a successful leptogenesis to generate the cosmic baryon\nasymmetry.\n", "  With several new large-scale surveys on the horizon, including LSST, TESS,\nZTF, and Evryscope, faster and more accurate analysis methods will be required\nto adequately process the enormous amount of data produced. Deep learning, used\nin industry for years now, allows for advanced feature detection in minimally\nprepared datasets at very high speeds; however, despite the advantages of this\nmethod, its application to astrophysics has not yet been extensively explored.\nThis dearth may be due to a lack of training data available to researchers.\nHere we generate synthetic data loosely mimicking the properties of acoustic\nmode pulsating stars and we show that two separate paradigms of deep learning -\nthe Artificial Neural Network And the Convolutional Neural Network - can both\nbe used to classify this synthetic data effectively. And that additionally this\nclassification can be performed at relatively high levels of accuracy with\nminimal time spent adjusting network hyperparameters.\n", "  An overview of recent measurements of inclusive and differential single top\nquark cross sections at 13 TeV with the CMS experiment is given in this note.\nThis includes measurements targeting the $t$-channel and tW production modes\nresulting in inclusive cross sections of\n$\\sigma_{t\\mathrm{\\mbox{-}ch.}}=238\\pm32~\\mathrm{pb}$ and\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{tW}=63.1\\pm6.6~\\mathrm{pb}$ respectively. In addition, the\n$t$-channel cross section has been measured differentially as a function of the\ntop quark transverse momentum and rapidity. The results are found in agreement\nwith the standard model expectations. Furthermore, a search for single top\nquark production in association with a Z boson is detailed which yields an\nobserved (expected) significance of 3.7 (3.1) standard deviations.\n", "  We illustrate the use of the theory of $qq$-characters by deriving the BPZ\nand KZ-type equations for the partition functions of certain surface defects in\nquiver ${\\mathcal N}=2$ theories. We generate a surface defect in the linear\nquiver theory by embedding it into a theory with additional node, with specific\nmasses of the fundamental hypermultiplets. We prove that the supersymmetric\npartition function of this theory with $SU(2)^{r-3}$ gauge group verifies the\ncelebrated Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov equation of two dimensional Liouville\ntheory. We also study the $SU(N)$ theory with $2N$ fundamental hypermultiplets\nand the theory with adjoint hypermultiplet. We show that the regular orbifold\ndefect in this theory solves the KZ-like equation of the WZW theory on a four\npunctured sphere and one-punctured torus, respectively. In the companion paper\nthese equations will be mapped to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations\n", "  Systems Engineering (SE) is the set of processes and documentation required\nfor successfully realising large-scale engineering projects, but the classical\napproach is not a good fit for software-intensive projects, especially when the\nneeds of the different stakeholders are not fully known from the beginning, and\nrequirement priorities might change. The SKA is the ultimate software-enabled\ntelescope, with enormous amounts of computing hardware and software required to\nperform its data reduction. We give an overview of the system and software\nengineering processes in the SKA1 development, and the tension between\nclassical and agile SE.\n", "  A computational and experimental approach based on a natural vibration of a\nfree prismatic thick beam with square cross-section is suggested. Three\nvariants of the beam sample were used (one with skin and two without skin).\nFrom 13 to 16 lowest resonant frequencies of longitudinal, torsional and\nflexural vibration of each beam were analyzed. A rule for dependence of Young's\nmodulus on the average foam density was derived from the sample without skin.\nIt is shown that the skin presence causes known anisotropy that the stiffness\nin transverse direction is about 50% greater than that in the longitudinal\ndirection. It has also been shown that the seeming frequency dependence of the\nYoung's module can be explained by non-uniform distribution of mass density in\nthe sample. Agreement among experimental and numerical data is excellent in\nmost cases. The rule is also verified on solution of two lowest resonant\nfrequencies of the free foam plates with various mass densities (from 400 to\n1350 kg/m3). Agreement among experimental and numerical frequencies is\nacceptable.\n", "  Surveys of young star-forming regions have discovered a growing population of\nplanetary-mass (<13 M_Jup) companions around young stars. There is an ongoing\ndebate as to whether these companions formed like planets (that is, from the\ncircumstellar disk), or if they represent the low-mass tail of the star\nformation process. In this study we utilize high-resolution spectroscopy to\nmeasure rotation rates of three young (2-300 Myr) planetary-mass companions and\ncombine these measurements with published rotation rates for two additional\ncompanions to provide a look at the spin distribution of these objects. We\ncompare this distribution to complementary rotation rate measurements for six\nbrown dwarfs with masses <20 M_Jup, and show that these distributions are\nindistinguishable. This suggests that either that these two populations formed\nvia the same mechanism, or that processes regulating rotation rates are\nindependent of formation mechanism. We find that rotation rates for both\npopulations are well below their break-up velocities and do not evolve\nsignificantly during the first few hundred million years after the end of\naccretion. This suggests that rotation rates are set during late stages of\naccretion, possibly by interactions with a circumplanetary disk. This result\nhas important implications for our understanding of the processes regulating\nthe angular momentum evolution of young planetary-mass objects, and of the\nphysics of gas accretion and disk coupling in the planetary-mass regime.\n", "  The LSST software systems make extensive use of Python, with almost all of it\ninitially being developed solely in Python 2. Since LSST will be commissioned\nwhen Python 2 is end-of-lifed it is critical that we have all our code support\nPython 3 before commissioning begins. Over the past year we have made\nsignificant progress in migrating the bulk of the code from the Data Management\nsystem onto Python 3. This paper presents our migration methodology, and the\ncurrent status of the port, with our eventual aim to be running completely on\nPython 3 by early 2018. We also discuss recent modernizations to our Python\ncodebase.\n", "  We classify three fold isolated quotient Gorenstein singularity $C^3/G$.\nThese singularities are rigid, i.e. there is no non-trivial deformation, and we\nconjecture that they define 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs which do not have a\nCoulomb branch.\n", "  Most theoretical and simulation studies on charged particles suspensions are\nat infinite dilution conditions. Hence these studies have been focused on the\nelectrolyte structure around an isolated central particle (or elctrode), where\nphenomena as charge reversal, charge inversion and overcharging have been shown\nto be relevant. However, experimental studiesat finite volume fraction exhibit\ninteresting phenomenology which imply very long-range correlations. Inthis\npaper we apply an integral equation theory to a simple model for a charged\nmacroions suspension, at finite volume fraction, and find two new effects of\nlong-range overcharging and long-range charge reversal. These new effects are\ndifferent from the classical overcharging and charge reversal in that they\noccur at finite macroion's volume fraction, far away from the central macroion,\nare much more intense, and increase, not decrease, as a function of the\ndistance to the central particle, which is indicative of correlations at large\nseparations. We find our results to be qualitative consistent with existing\nexperimental results, and Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Relationships between current theories, and relationships between current\ntheories and the sought theory of quantum gravity (QG), play an essential role\nin motivating the need for QG, aiding the search for QG, and defining what\nwould count as QG. Correspondence is the broad class of inter-theory\nrelationships intended to demonstrate the necessary compatibility of two\ntheories whose domains of validity overlap, in the overlap regions. The variety\nof roles that correspondence plays in the search for QG are illustrated, using\nexamples from specific QG approaches. Reduction is argued to be a special case\nof correspondence, and to form part of the definition of QG. Finally, the\nappropriate account of emergence in the context of QG is presented, and\ncompared to conceptions of emergence in the broader philosophy literature. It\nis argued that, while emergence is likely to hold between QG and general\nrelativity, emergence is not part of the definition of QG, and nor can it serve\nusefully in the development and justification of the new theory.\n", "  The polymer (PBDTTT-c) p-doped with the molecular dopant (Mo(tfd-COCF3)3)\nexhibits a decline in transport properties at high doping concentrations, which\nlimits the performance attainable through organic semiconductor doping.\nScanning Electron Microscopy is used to correlate the evolution of hole\nconductivity and hopping transport activation energy with the formation of\naggregates in the layer. Transmission Electron Microscopy with\nenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis along with liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance experiments are carried out to determine the composition of the\naggregates. This study offers an explanation to the limited efficiency of\ndoping at high dopant concentrations and reinforces the need to increase doping\nefficiency in order to be able to reduce the dopant concentration and not\nnegatively affect conductivity.\n", "  In this work we present an alternative to the use of PEDOT:PSS as hole\ntransport and electron blocking layer in organic photodetectors processed by\nsolution. As PEDOT:PSS is known to be sensitive to humidity, oxygen and UV,\nremoving this layer is essential for lifetime improvements. As a first step to\nachieving this goal, we need to find an alternative layer that fulfills the\nsame role in order to obtain a working diode with similar or better\nperformance. As a replacement, a layer of\nPoly((4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b)dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexanoyl)-thieno(3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-6-diyl))\n(PBDTTT-c) p-doped with the dopant\ntris-(1-(trifluoroethanoyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)ethane-1,2-dithiolene)\n(Mo(tfd-COCF3)3) is used. This p-doped layer effectively lowers the hole\ninjection barrier, and the low electron affinity of the polymer prevents the\ninjection of electrons in the active layer. We show similar device performance\nunder light and the improvements of detection performance with the doped layer\nin comparison with PEDOT:PSS, leading to a detectivity of 1.9x1E13\ncm(Hz)1/2(W)-1, competitive with silicon diodes used in imaging applications.\nMoreover, contrary to PEDOT:PSS, no localization of the p-doped layer is\nneeded, leading to a diode active area defined by the patterned electrodes.\n", "  High average current, transportable energy recovery linacs (ERLs) can be very\nattractive tools for a number of applications including next generation\nhigh-luminosity, compact light sources. Conventional ERLs are based on an\nelectron beam circulating through the same set of rf cavity cells. This leads\nto an accumulation of high-order modes inside the cavity cells, resulting in\nthe development of a beam breakup (BBU) instability, unless the beam current is\nkept below the BBU start current. This limits the maximum current which can be\ntransported through the ERL and hence the intensity of the photon beam\ngenerated. It has recently been proposed that splitting the accelerating and\ndecelerating stages, tuning them separately and coupling them via a resonance\ncoupler can increase the BBU start current. The paper presents the first\nexperimental rf studies of a dual axis 7-cell asymmetric cavity and confirms\nthe properties predicted by the theoretical model. The field structures of the\nsymmetric and asymmetric modes are measured and good agreement with the\nnumerical predictions is demonstrated. The operating mode field flatness was\nalso measured and discussed. A novel approach based on the coupled mode\n(Fano-like) model has been developed for the description of the cavity\nEigenmode spectrum and good agreement between analytical theory, numerical\npredictions and experimental data is shown. Numerical and experimental results\nobserved are analyzed, discussed and a good agreement between theory and\nexperiment is demonstrated.\n", "  This paper describes the cryogenic system for the Cryomodule Test Stand\n(CMTS) at the new Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF) located at Fermilab. CMTS is\ndesigned for production testing of the 1.3 GHz and 3.9 GHz cryomodules to be\nused in the Linac Coherent Light Source II (LCLSII), which is an upgrade to an\nexisting accelerator at Stanford Linear Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC). This\npaper will focus on the cryogenic system that extends from the helium\nrefrigeration plant to the CMTS cave. Topics covered will include component\ndesign, installation and commissioning progress, and operational plans. The\npaper will conclude with a description of the heat load measurement plan.\n", "  Generation of nonclassical light is an essential tool for quantum optics\nresearch and applications in quantum information technology. We present\nrealization of the source of nonclassically correlated photon pairs based on\nthe process of spontaneous four-wave-mixing in warm atomic vapor. Atoms are\nexcited only by a single laser beam in retro-reflected configuration and\nnarrowband frequency filtering is employed for selection of correlated photon\npairs. Nonclassicality of generated light fields is proved by analysis of their\nstatistical properties. Measured parameters of the presented source promise\nfurther applicability for efficient interaction with atomic ensembles.\n", "  A comprehensive study on the effects of energetic protons on carbon-fiber\ncomposites and compounds under consideration for use as low-Z pion production\ntargets in future high-power accelerators and low-impedance collimating\nelements for intercepting TeV-level protons at the Large Hadron Collider has\nbeen undertaken addressing two key areas, namely, thermal shock absorption and\nresistance to irradiation damage.\n", "  Supermassive black holes at centers of clusters of galaxies strongly interact\nwith their host environment via AGN feedback. Key tracers of such activity are\nX-ray cavities -- regions of lower X-ray brightness within the cluster. We\npresent an automatic method for detecting, and characterizing X-ray cavities in\nnoisy, low-resolution X-ray images. We simulate clusters of galaxies, insert\ncavities into them, and produce realistic low-quality images comparable to\nobservations at high redshifts. We then train a custom-built convolutional\nneural network to generate pixel-wise analysis of presence of cavities in a\ncluster. A ResNet architecture is then used to decode radii of cavities from\nthe pixel-wise predictions. We surpass the accuracy, stability, and speed of\ncurrent visual inspection based methods on simulated data.\n", "  The nitrocarburization of the AISI-H13 tool steel by ion beam assisted\ndeposition is reported. In this technique, a carbon film is continuously\ndeposited over the sample by the ion beam sputtering of a carbon target while a\nsecond ion source is used to bombard the sample with low energy nitrogen ions.\nThe results show that the presence of carbon has an important impact on the\ncrystalline and microstructural properties of the material without modification\nof the case depth.\n", "  A graphene-based spin-diffusive (GrSD) neural network is presented in this\nwork that takes advantage of the locally tunable spin transport of graphene and\nthe non-volatility of nanomagnets. By using electrostatically gated graphene as\nspintronic synapses, a weighted summation operation can be performed in the\nspin domain while the weights can be programmed using circuits in the charge\ndomain. Four-component spin/charge circuit simulations coupled to magnetic\ndynamics are used to show the feasibility of the neuron-synapse functionality\nand quantify the analog weighting capability of the graphene under different\nspin relaxation mechanisms. By realizing transistor-free weight implementation,\nthe graphene spin-diffusive neural network reduces the energy consumption to\n0.08-0.32 fJ per cell-synapse and achieves significantly better scalability\ncompared to its digital counterparts, particularly as the number and bit\naccuracy of the synapses increases.\n", "  We report an unambiguous phonon resonance effect originating from germanium\nnanoparticles embedded in silicon matrix. Our approach features the combination\nof phonon wave-packet method with atomistic dynamics and finite element method\nrooted in continuum theory. We find that multimodal phonon resonance, caused by\ndestructive interference of coherent lattice waves propagating through and\naround the nanoparticle, gives rise to sharp and significant transmittance\ndips, blocking the lower-end frequency range of phonon transport that is hardly\ndiminished by other nanostructures. The resonance is sensitive to the phonon\ncoherent length, where the finiteness of the wave packet width weakens the\ntransmittance dip even when coherent length is longer than the particle\ndiameter. Further strengthening of transmittance dips are possible by arraying\nmultiple nanoparticles that gives rise to the collective vibrational mode.\nFinally, it is demonstrated that these resonance effects can significantly\nreduce thermal conductance in the lower-end frequency range.\n", "  We propose a unified model for the nucleosynthesis of heavy (A > 57) elements\nin stars. The neutron flux can be set to describe neutron capture in arbitrary\nneutron flux. Our approach solves the coupled differential equations, that\ndescribe the neutron capture and decays of 2696 nuclei, numerically without\ntruncating those to include only either capture or decay as traditionally\nassumed in weak neutron flux (s process). As a result the synthesis of heavy\nnuclei always evolves along a wide band in the valley of stable nuclei. The\nobserved abundances in the Solar system are reproduced reasonably already in\nthe simplest version of the model. The model predicts that the nucleosynthesis\nin weak or modest neutron flux produces elements that are traditionally assumed\nto result in the high neutron flux of supernovae explosions (r process).\n", "  With 78.7 days of observations for PG 0112+104, a pulsating DB star, from\nCampaign 8 of $Kepler$ 2 mission, Hermes et al. made a detailed mode\nidentification. A reliable mode identification, with 5 $l$ = 1 modes, 3 $l$ = 2\nmodes, and 3 $l$ = 1 or 2 modes, was identified. Grids of DBV star models are\nevolved by \\texttt{WDEC} with element diffusion effect of pure Coulomb\npotential and screened Coulomb potential. Fitting the identified modes of PG\n0112+104 by the calculated ones, we studied the difference of element diffusion\neffect between adopting pure Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.\nOur aim is to reduce the fitting error by studying new input physics. The\nstarting models including their chemical composition profile are from white\ndwarf models evolved by \\texttt{MESA}. They were calculated following the\nstellar evolution from the main sequence to the start of the white dwarf\ncooling sequences. The optimal parameters are basically consistent with that of\nprevious spectroscopic and asteroseismological studies. The pure and screened\nCoulomb potential lead to different composition profiles of the C/O-He\ninterface area. High $k$ modes are very sensitive to the area. However, most of\nthe observed modes for PG 0112+104 are low $k$ modes. The $\\sigma_{RMS}$ taking\nthe screened Coulomb potential is reduced by 4\\% compared with taking the pure\nCoulomb potential when fitting the identified low $k$ modes of PG 0112+104.\nFitting the $Kepler$ 2 data with our models improved the $\\sigma_{RMS}$ of the\nfit by 27\\%.\n", "  The nature of the far-IR source HOPS 108 has been a matter of debate in the\nlast years. Previous radio observations detected a 3.6 cm source (VLA 12),\ncoincident with HOPS 108, that was interpreted as a radio jet from this\nprotostar. We present new multi-wavelength (0.7-5 cm), multi-configuration VLA\nobservations as well as archive data (3.6 cm) that reveal VLA 12 as three knots\nof non-thermal emission, with HOPS 108 close to the central knot. We show that\nthese knots have not been ejected by HOPS 108. We propose that the VLA 12 knots\nare actually part of a radio jet driven by VLA 11 (HOPS 370), a strong nearby\nsource clearly elongated in the direction of the knots. The position of HOPS\n108 in the path of the VLA 11-VLA 12 jet suggests an appealing new scenario:\nthe triggered formation of HOPS 108 by the interaction of the jet with the\nsurrounding medium.\n", "  We report our study of two proto-brown dwarf candidates in Taurus, [GKH94]~41\nand IRAS~04191+1523B. Based on continuum maps at 102~GHz (or 2.9~mm), spectral\ntypes and the spectral energy distribution of both targets, we confirmed the\nclass I evolutionary stage of [GKH94]~41 and IRAS~04191+1523B, and estimated\nthe upper limit to the final masses to be 49$^{+56}_{-27}$~$M_{\\rm J}$ and\n75$^{+40}_{-26}$~$M_{\\rm J}$ for [GKH94]~41 and IRAS~04191+1523B, respectively.\nThis indicates that they will likely end up as brown dwarfs or very low-mass\nstars. The existence of these class I very low-mass objects strongly supports\nthe scenario that brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars have the same formation\nstages as low-mass stars.\n", "  Hibonite-pyroxene spherules are an extremely rare kind of refractory\ninclusion that show a wide range of exotic isotopic properties despite their\ndefining similarity and simplicity in morphology and mineralogy. One such,\nrelatively large (about 120 micron diameter), inclusion has been found in one\nof the most pristine meteorites, Allan Hills 77307 (a carbonaceous chondrite of\nthe Ornans group; Petrologic type 3.03). The inclusion consists of two central\nhibonite laths of about 30x15 micron surrounded by Al, Ca-rich pyroxene. The\nhibonite laths have uniform composition. The composition of pyroxene\nsurrounding the hibonite is radially homogenously Al,-Ca rich up to about 50-60\nmicrons which transitions to Mg, -Ti rich at the outer boundary.\nHibonite-pyroxene spherule found in ALHA 77307 shares many similarities with\nthe other previously found hibonite-pyroxene spherules. A distinguishing\nfeature of the inclusion in ALHA77307 is the presence of two slivers/ wedges at\nthe opposite outer edge of the hibonite- pyroxene spherule that consist of\nrapidly, poorly crystalized, sub-micron minerals with pristine textures. The\npristine petrography and mineralogy of this inclusion allow discernment of the\nexpected general trend of formation and alteration amongst hibonite-pyroxene\nspherules.\n", "  Recent \\herschel\\ and \\planck\\ observations of submillimeter dust emission\nrevealed the omnipresence of filamentary structures in the interstellar medium\n(ISM). The ubiquity of filaments in quiescent clouds as well as in star-forming\nregions indicates that the formation of filamentary structures is a natural\nproduct of the physics at play in the magnatized turbulent cold ISM.\n  An analysis of more than 270 filaments observed with {\\it Herschel} in 8\nregions of the Gould Belt, shows that interstellar filaments are characterized\nby a narrow distribution of central width, while they span a wide column\ndensity range.\n  Molecular line observations of a sample of these filaments show evidence of\nan increase in the velocity dispersion of dense filaments with column density,\nsuggesting an evolution in mass per unit length due to accretion of surrounding\nmaterial onto these star-forming filaments.\n  The analyses of \\planck\\ dust polarization observations show that the mean\nmagnetic field along the filaments is different from that of their surrounding\nclouds. This points to a coupling between the matter and the $\\vec{B}$-field in\nthe filament formation process. These observational results, derived from dust\nand gas tracers in total and polarized intensity, set strong constraints on\ntheoretical models for filament formation and evolution. They also provide\nimportant hints on the initial conditions of the star formation process from\nthe fragmentation of dense (supercritical) filaments. Higher resolution dust\npolarization observations and large scale molecular line mapping are\nnevertheless required to investigate in more details the internal structure of\ninterstellar filaments.\n", "  It has been found a simple procedure for the general solution of the\ntime-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation (SE) with the help of quantization of\npotential area in one dimension without making any approximation. Energy values\nare not dependent on wave functions, so to find the energy values; it is enough\nto find the classic turning points of the potential function. Two different\nsolutions were obtained, namely, symmetric and antisymmetric at bound states.\nThese normalized wave functions are always periodic. It is enough to take the\nintegral of the square root of the potential energy function to find the\nnormalized wave functions. If these calculations cannot be made analytically,\nit should then be performed by numerical methods. SE has been solved for a\nparticle in many one-dimension and the spherical symmetric central potential\nwell as examples. It has been found their energies and normalized wave\nfunctions as examples. These solutions were also applied to the theories of\nscattering and alpha decay. The results obtained with the experimental values\nwere compared with the calculated values. One has been seen to be very fit.\n", "  We present far-infrared observations of Monoceros R2 (a giant molecular cloud\nat approximately 830 pc distance, containing several sites of active star\nformation), as observed at 70 {\\mu}m, 160 {\\mu}m, 250 {\\mu}m, 350 {\\mu}m, and\n500 {\\mu}m by the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and\nSpectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instruments on the Herschel\nSpace Observatory as part of the Herschel imaging survey of OB young stellar\nobjects (HOBYS) Key programme. The Herschel data are complemented by SCUBA-2\ndata in the submillimetre range, and WISE and Spitzer data in the mid-infrared.\nIn addition, C18O data from the IRAM 30-m Telescope are presented, and used for\nkinematic information. Sources were extracted from the maps with getsources,\nand from the fluxes measured, spectral energy distributions were constructed,\nallowing measurements of source mass and dust temperature. Of 177 Herschel\nsources robustly detected in the region (a detection with high signal-to-noise\nand low axis ratio at multiple wavelengths), including protostars and starless\ncores, 29 are found in a filamentary hub at the centre of the region (a little\nover 1% of the observed area). These objects are on average smaller, more\nmassive, and more luminous than those in the surrounding regions (which\ntogether suggest that they are at a later stage of evolution), a result that\ncannot be explained entirely by selection effects. These results suggest a\npicture in which the hub may have begun star formation at a point significantly\nearlier than the outer regions, possibly forming as a result of feedback from\nearlier star formation. Furthermore, the hub may be sustaining its star\nformation by accreting material from the surrounding filaments.\n", "  The paper overviews our recent work on the synthesis of metasurfaces and\nrelated concepts and applications. The synthesis is based on generalized sheet\ntransition conditions (GSTCs) with a bianisotropic surface susceptibility\ntensor model of the metasurface structure. We first place metasurfaces in a\nproper historical context and describe the GSTC technique with some fundamental\nsusceptibility tensor considerations. Upon this basis, we next provide an\nin-depth development of our susceptibility-GSTC synthesis technique. Finally,\nwe present five recent metasurface concepts and applications, which cover the\ntopics of birefringent transformations, bianisotropic refraction, light\nemission enhancement, remote spatial processing and nonlinear second-harmonic\ngeneration.\n", "  The product of the gluon dressing function and the square of the ghost\ndressing function in the Landau gauge can be regarded to represent, apart from\nthe inverse power corrections $1/Q^{2 n}$, a nonperturbative generalization\n$A(Q^2)$ of the perturbative QCD running coupling $a(Q^2)$ ($\\equiv\n\\alpha_s(Q^2)/\\pi$). Recent large volume lattice calculations for these\ndressing functions strongly indicate that such a generalized coupling goes to\nzero as $A(Q^2) \\sim Q^2$ when the squared momenta $Q^2$ go to zero ($Q^2 \\ll 1\n\\ {\\rm GeV}^2$). We construct such a QCD coupling $A(Q^2)$ which fulfills also\nvarious other physically motivated conditions. At high momenta it becomes the\nunderlying perturbative coupling $a(Q^2)$ to a very high precision. And at\nintermediately low momenta $Q^2 \\sim 1 \\ {\\rm GeV}^2$ it gives results\nconsistent with the data of the semihadronic $\\tau$ lepton decays as measured\nby OPAL and ALEPH. The coupling is constructed in a dispersive way, ensuring as\na byproduct the holomorphic behavior of $A(Q^2)$ in the complex $Q^2$-plane\nwhich reflects the holomorphic behavior of the spacelike QCD observables.\nApplication of the Borel sum rules to $\\tau$-decay V + A spectral functions\nallows us to obtain values for the gluon (dimension-4) condensate and the\ndimension-6 condensate, which reproduce the measured OPAL and ALEPH data to a\nsignificantly better precision than the perturbative MSbar coupling (+OPE)\napproach. The comparison with the experimental V-channel Adler function,\nrelated with the $e^+ e^- \\to$ hadrons ratio, at low $Q^2 \\sim 1 \\ {\\rm\nGeV}^2$, also gives results considerably better than with the usual MSbar\npQCD+OPE approach.\n", "  We study the process of quantum telecloning of $d$-dimensional pure quantum\nstates using partially entangled pure states as quantum channel. This process\nefficiently mixes optimal universal symmetric cloning with quantum\nteleportation. It is shown that it is possible to implement universal symmetric\ntelecloning in a probabilistic way using unambiguous state discrimination and\nquantum state separation schemes. It is also shown that other strategies, such\nas minimum error discrimination, lead to a decrease in the fidelity of the\ncopies and that certain partially entangled pure states with maximal Schmidt\nrank lead to an average telecloning fidelity which is always above the optimal\nfidelity of measuring and preparation of quantum states. We also discuss the\ncase of partially entangled pure states with non-maximal Schmidt rank. The\nresults presented here are valid for arbitrary numbers of copies of a single\ninput qudit state of any dimension.\n", "  A liquid crystal continuum modeling framework for icosahedra bacteriophage\nviruses is developed and tested. The main assumptions of the model are the\nchromonic columnar hexagonal structure of confined DNA, the high resistance to\nbending and the phase transition from solid to fluid-like states as the\nconcentration of DNA in the capsid decreases during infection. The model\npredicts osmotic pressure inside the capsid and the ejection force of the DNA\nas well as the size of the isotropic volume at the center of the capsid.\nExtensions of the model are discussed.\n", "  We show that, for a Quantum Markov Semigroup (QMS) with a faithful normal\ninvariant state, the atomicity of the decoherence-free subalgebra and\nenvironmental decoherence are equivalent. Moreover, we characterize the set of\nreversible states and explicitly describe the relationship between the\ndecoherence-free subalgebra and the fixed point subalgebra for QMSs with the\nabove equivalent properties.\n", "  We present results of a large, high resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulation\nof the surface layers of a DA white dwarf (WD) with $T_{\\rm eff}=11800$ K and\n$\\log(g)=8$ using the ANTARES code, the widest and deepest such simulation to\ndate. Our simulations are in good agreement with previous calculations in the\nSchwarzschild-unstable region and in the overshooting region immediately\nbeneath it. Farther below, in the wave-dominated region, we find that the rms\nhorizontal velocities decay with depth more rapidly than the vertical ones.\nSince mixing requires both vertical and horizontal displacements, this could\nhave consequences for the size of the region that is well mixed by convection,\nif this trend is found to hold for deeper layers. We discuss how the size of\nthe mixed region affects the calculated settling times and inferred\nsteady-state accretion rates for WDs with metals observed in their atmospheres.\n", "  When an infection spreads in a community, an individual's probability of\nbecoming infected depends on both her susceptibility and exposure to the\ncontagion through contact with others. While one often has knowledge regarding\nan individual's susceptibility, in many cases, whether or not an individual's\ncontacts are contagious is unknown. We study the problem of predicting if an\nindividual will adopt a contagion in the presence of multiple modes of\ninfection (exposure/susceptibility) and latent neighbor influence. We present a\ngenerative probabilistic model and a variational inference method to learn the\nparameters of our model. Through a series of experiments on synthetic data, we\nmeasure the ability of the proposed model to identify latent spreaders, and\npredict the risk of infection. Applied to a real dataset of 20,000 hospital\npatients, we demonstrate the utility of our model in predicting the onset of a\nhealthcare associated infection using patient room-sharing and nurse-sharing\nnetworks. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks and provides actionable\ninsights for the design and implementation of targeted interventions to curb\nthe spread of infection.\n", "  We construct two examples of invariant manifolds that despite being locally\nunstable at every point in the transverse direction are globally stable. Using\nnumerical simulations we show that these invariant manifolds temporarily repel\nnearby trajectories but act as global attractors. We formulate an explanation\nfor such global stability in terms of the `rate of rotation' of the stable and\nunstable eigenvectors spanning the normal subspace associated with each point\nof the invariant manifold. We discuss the role of this rate of rotation on the\ntransitions between the stable and unstable regimes.\n", "  While smart city innovations seem to be a common and necessary response to\nincreasing challenges of urbanization, foreseeing their impact on complex urban\nsystem is critical for informed decision making. Moreover, often the effect of\nurban interventions goes beyond the original expectations, including multiple\nindirect impacts. The present study considers the impact of two urban\ndeployments, Citi Bike (bike sharing system) and LinkNYC kiosks, on the local\ncommercial activity in the affected neighborhoods of New York City. The study\nuses anonymized and aggregated insights provided through a grant from the\nMastercard Center for Inclusive Growth in order to provide initial data-driven\nevidence towards the hypothesis that proximity of Citi Bike stations\nincentivizes local sales at eating places, while LinkNYC kiosks help people,\nespecially visitors, to navigate local businesses and thus incentivize\ncommercial activity in different business categories.\n", "  Kant put forward the notion of the Transcendental Aesthetic (TA) in his\nmanuscript ${\\it A\\; Critique\\; of\\; Pure\\; Reason}$. In this note I review the\nTA in light of the detection of gravitational wave radiation. While the notion\nof the TA has been refuted in many different ways since its introduction, I\nargue that this simple proof by contradiction is of interest pedagogically and\nphilosophically. I hope this elucidation may be useful in introductory science\ncourses and in science communication more generally.\n", "  Community structure is pervasive in various real-world networks, portraying\nthe strong local clustering of nodes. Unveiling the community structure of a\nnetwork is deemed to a crucial step towards understanding the dynamics on the\nnetwork. Actually, most of the real-world networks are dynamic and their\ncommunity structures are evolutionary over time accordingly. How to revealing\nthe dynamical communities has recently become a pressing issue. Here, we\npresent an evolutionary method for accurately identifying dynamical communities\nin the networks. In this method, we first introduced a fitness function that is\na compound of asymptotic surprise values on the current and previous snapshots\nof the network. Second, we developed ad hoc merging and splitting operators,\nwhich allows for large-scale searching while preserving low cost. Third, this\nlarge-scale searching coupled with local mutation and crossover enhanced\nrevealing a better solution to each snapshot of the network. This method does\nnot require specifying the number of communities advanced, and free from\nresolution limit while satisfying temporal smooth constraint. Experimental\nresults on both model and real dynamic networks show that the method can find a\nbetter solution compared with state-of-art approaches.\n", "  In recent years, the use of adjoint vectors in Computational Fluid Dynamics\n(CFD) has seen a dramatic rise. Their utility in numerous applications,\nincluding design optimization, data assimilation, and mesh adaptation has\nsparked the interest of both researchers and practitioners alike. In many of\nthese fields, the concept of an adjoint is explained differently, with various\nnotations and motivations employed. Further complicating matters is the\nexistence of two seemingly different types of adjoints -- \"continuous\" and\n\"discrete\" -- as well as the more formal definition of adjoint operators\nemployed in linear algebra and functional analysis. These issues can make the\nfundamental concept of an adjoint difficult to pin down. In these notes, we\nhope to clarify some of the ideas surrounding adjoint vectors and to provide a\nuseful reference for both continuous and discrete adjoints alike. In\nparticular, we focus on the use of adjoints within the context of output-based\nmesh adaptation, where the goal is to achieve accuracy in a particular quantity\n(or \"output\") of interest by performing targeted adaptation of the\ncomputational mesh. While this is our application of interest, the ideas\ndiscussed here apply directly to design optimization, data assimilation, and\nmany other fields where adjoints are employed.\n", "  The search of secondary pulsations is carried out to understand the possible\nrelations among the known parameters of variables of the cluster, NGC 6866.\nThese pulsations arise due to the various ongoing physical phenomena of the\nvariables. Moreover, pulsations of the variables are identified through the\nvisual inspection of their frequency-amplitude distributions. A total of 18\nvariables among the 28 known variables are showing the secondary pulsation\nmodes. Furthermore, these pulsation modes do not occur for PV, EA, EB,\nElliptical and semi-regular. In addition, the field variables seem to be the\nred-component-stars (RCS) for the studied cluster. The smoothness of the\nfrequency-amplitude curves, signal to noise ratio and the significant limits\nare play major role for deciding the real peak or frequency values. We are not\nrejected those amplitude peak of parabolic patterns, for which, the amplitude\nis greater than then significant limit of variables. The weight of pulsation\nfrequencies is given to be 0.5 for non full cyclic variation but the amplitude\nis greater than significant limit. Similarly, our present analysis does not\nsupport the HADS characteristics of previous known HADS stars within stellar\ncluster NGC 6866. We are also proposed to new correlation between the secondary\npulsation modes (depending frequencies) and the absolute magnitude of known\nvariables.\n", "  A nonlocal diffuse interface model is used to study bubble assemblies in\nternary systems. As model parameters vary, a large number of morphological\nphases appear as stable stationary states. One open question related to the\npolarity direction of double bubble assemblies is answered numerically.\nMoreover, the average size of bubbles in a single bubble assembly depends on\nthe sum of the minority constituent areas and the long range interaction\ncoefficients. One identifies the ranges for area fractions and the long range\ninteraction coefficients for double bubble assemblies.\n", "  Period searches in event data have traditionally used the Rayleigh statistic,\n$R^2$. For X-ray pulsars, the standard has been the $Z^2$ statistic, which sums\nover more than one harmonic. For $\\gamma$-rays, the $H$-test, which optimizes\nthe number of harmonics to sum, is often used. These periodograms all suffer\nfrom the same problem, namely artefacts caused by correlations in the Fourier\ncomponents that arise from testing frequencies with a non-integer number of\ncycles. This article addresses this problem. The modified Rayleigh statistic is\ndiscussed, its generalization to any harmonic, $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$, is\nformulated, and from the latter, the modified $Z^2$ statistic, $\\mathcal{Z}^2$,\nis constructed. Versions of these statistics for binned data and point\nmeasurements are derived, and it is shown that the variance in the\nuncertainties can have an important influence on the periodogram. It is shown\nhow to combine the information about the signal frequency from the different\nharmonics to estimate its value with maximum accuracy. The methods are applied\nto an $\\textit{XMM-Newton}$ observation of the Crab pulsar for which a\ndecomposition of the pulse profile is presented, and shows that most of the\npower is in the second, third, and fifth harmonics. The statistical detection\npower of the $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ statistic is superior to the FFT and equivalent\nto the Lomb-Scargle (LS). Response to gaps in the data is assessed, and it is\nshown that the LS does not protect against the distortions they cause. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the classical $R^2$ and $Z^2$ should be\nreplaced by $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ and $\\mathcal{Z}^2$ in all applications with\nevent data, and the LS should be replaced by the $\\mathcal{R}^2_k$ when the\nuncertainty varies from one point measurement to another.\n", "  We report on our latest results in the calculation of the two--mass\ncontributions to 3--loop operator matrix elements (OMEs). These OMEs are needed\nto compute the corresponding contributions to the deep-inealstic scattering\nstructure functions and to generalize the variable flavor number scheme by\nincluding both charm and bottom quarks. We present the results for the\nnon-singlet and $A_{gq,Q}$ OMEs, and compare the size of their contribution\nrelative to the single mass case. Results for the gluonic OME $A_{gg,Q}$ are\ngiven in the physical case, going beyond those presented in a previous\npublication where scalar diagrams were computed. We also discuss our recently\npublished two--mass contribution to the pure singlet OME, and present an\nalternative method of calculating the corresponding diagrams.\n", "  The conditional version of sandwiched Tsallis relative entropy (CSTRE) is\nemployed to study the bipartite separability of one parameter family of N-qudit\nWerner- Popescu states in their 1 : N-1 partition. For all N, the strongest\nlimitation on bipartite separability is realized in the limit q tending to\ninfinity and is found to match exactly with the separability range obtained\nusing an algebraic method which is both necessary and sufficient. The\ntheoretical superiority of using CSTRE criterion to find the bipartite\nseparability range over the one using Abe- Rajagopal (AR) q-conditional entropy\nis illustrated by comparing the convergence of the parameter x with respect to\nq, in the implicit plots of AR q-conditional entropy and CSTRE.\n", "  Emerging in the 1950s, the multiband superconductivity has been considered\nfor a long time as an approximate model in the form of a generalization of the\nBCS theory to the case of two bands for a more accurate quantitative\ndescription of the properties and characteristics of such superconductors as\ncuprates, heavy fermions compounds, metal boron carbides, fullerides, strontium\nruthenate etc. due to their complex piecewise-continuous Fermi surfaces.\nHowever the discovery of the multiband structure of the superconducting state\nin magnesium diboride in 2001 and iron oxypnictides and chalcogenides in 2008\nled to the appearance of many papers in which effects and different dependences\nwell known for conventional single-band s-wave superconductors were reexamined.\nThe main purpose of these studies was to reveal the symmetry type of the order\nparameter, which provides an important information about the mechanism of\nCooper pairing in these superconductors. One of the most effective methods of\nobtaining information on the symmetry properties of the order parameter in the\nmultiband superconductors is phase-sensitive techniques. This review summarizes\nthe results of theoretical and experimental studies of the proximity and\nJosephson effects in systems based on multiband superconductors in contact with\nnormal metals, insulators and other superconductors.\n", "  The trade-off between accuracy and computational cost as a function of the\nsize and number of simulation boxes was studied for large-scale phase-field\nsimulations. For this purpose, a reference simulation box was incrementally\npartitioned. We have considered diffusion-controlled precipitation of delta\nprime in a model Al-Li system from the growth stage until early ripening. The\nresults of the simulations show that decomposition of simulation box can be a\nvaluable computational technique to accelerate simulations without substantial\nloss of accuracy. In the current case study, the precipitate density was found\nto be the key controlling parameter. For a pre-set accuracy, it turned out that\nlarge-scale simulations of the reference domain can be replaced by a\ncombination of smaller simulations. This shortens the required simulation time\nand improves the memory usage of the simulation considerably, and thus\nsubstantially increases the efficiency of massive parallel computation for\nphase-field applications.\n", "  Determining the energy transport mechanisms in flares remains a central goal\nin solar flares physics that is still not adequately answered by the 'standard\nflare model'. In particular, the relative roles of particles and/or waves as\ntransport mechanisms, the contributions of low energy protons and ions to the\noverall flare budget, and the limits of low energy non-thermal electron\ndistribution are questions that still cannot be adequately reconciled with\ncurrent instrumentation. In this 'White Paper' submitted in response to the\ncall for inputs to the Next Generation Solar Physics Mission review process\ninitiated by JAXA, NASA and ESA in 2016, we outline the open questions in this\narea and possible instrumentation that could provide the required observations\nto help answer these and other flare-related questions.\n", "  The discovery of relativistic spin-1/2 fermions such as Dirac and Weyl\nfermions in condensed-matter or artificial systems opens a new era in modern\nphysics. An interesting but rarely explored question is whether other\nrelativistic spinal excitations could be realized with artificial systems.\nHere, we construct twoand three-dimensional tight-binding models realizable\nwith cold fermionic atoms in optical lattices, where the low energy excitations\nare effectively described by the spin-1 Maxwell equations in the Hamiltonian\nform. These relativistic (linear dispersion) excitations with unconventional\ninteger pseudospin, beyond the Dirac-Weyl-Majorana fermions, are an exotic kind\nof fermions named asMaxwell fermions.We demonstrate that the systems have rich\ntopological features. For instance, the threefold degenerate points called\nMaxwell points may have quantized Berry phases and anomalous quantum Hall\neffects with spin-momentum locking may appear in topological Maxwell insulators\nin the two-dimensional lattices. In three dimensions,Maxwell points may have\nnontrivial monopole charges of \\pm2 with two Fermi arcs connecting them, and\nthe merging of the Maxwell points leads to topological phase transitions.\nFinally, we propose realistic schemes for realizing the model Hamiltonians and\ndetecting the topological properties of the emergent Maxwell quasiparticles in\noptical lattices.\n", "  ZrSiS is the most intensively studied topological nodal-line semimetal\ncandidate, which is proposed to host multiple nodal lines in its bulk\nelectronic structure. However, previous angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) experiments with vacuum ultraviolet lights mainly probed\nthe surface states. Here using bulk-sensitive soft X-ray ARPES, we acquire the\nbulk electronic states of ZrSiS without any interference from surface states.\nOur results clearly show two groups of three-dimensional bulk nodal lines\nlocated on high-symmetry planes and along high-symmetry lines in the bulk\nBrillouin zone, respectively. The nodal lines on high-symmetry planes are\nenforced to pin at the Fermi level by carrier compensation and constitute the\nwhole Fermi surfaces. This means that the carriers in ZrSiS are entirely\ncontributed by nodal-line fermions, suggesting that ZrSiS is a remarkable\nplatform for studying physical properties related to nodal lines.\n", "  We use large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the isomerizations of\nazobenzene molecules diluted inside a simple molecular material, to investigate\nthe effect of a modification of the cis isomer shape on the induced diffusion\nmechanism. To this end we simulate incomplete isomerizations, modifying the\namplitude of the trans to cis isomerization. We find thresholds in the\nevolution of the host molecules mobility with the isomerization amplitude, a\nresult predicted by the cage- breaking mechanism hypothesis (Teboul, V.;\nSaiddine, M.; Nunzi, J.M.; Accary, J.B. J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 134, 114517) and\nby the gradient pressure mechanism theory (Barrett, C.J.; Rochon, P.L.;\nNatansohn, A.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 109, 1505-1516. ). Above the threshold the\ndiffusion then increases linearly with the variation of the chromophore size\ninduced by the isomerization.\n", "  Plasma wakefield acceleration studies currently rely considerably on\nsimulating this effect numerically using highly specialized software.\nExorbitant computational difficulty of the problem requires simplifying models\nand methods,limiting such software applicability. Quasistatic approximation,\nfor example, utilizes a plasma model that does not include trapping plasma\nelectrons by the wakefield. This article presents a method that reuses a\nquasistatic plasma-beam solver to calculate parameters of wakefield-trapped\nplasma electrons.\n", "  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that\ndoes not use ionizing radiation, with application both in environmental\nsciences and in health. Image reconstruction is performed by solving an inverse\nproblem and ill-posed. Evolutionary Computation and Swarm Intelligence have\nbecome a source of methods for solving inverse problems. Fish School Search\n(FSS) is a promising search and optimization method, based on the dynamics of\nschools of fish. In this article the authors present a method for\nreconstruction of EIT images based on FSS and Non-Blind Search (NBS). The\nmethod was evaluated using numerical phantoms consisting of electrical\nconductivity images with subjects in the center, between the center and the\nedge and on the edge of a circular section, with meshes of 415 finite elements.\nThe authors performed 20 simulations for each configuration. Results showed\nthat both FSS and FSS-NBS were able to converge faster than genetic algorithms.\n", "  We study a simple and versatile diatomic potential function coined to prevent\ncrystallization in supercooled liquids. We show that the corresponding liquid\ndoes not crystallize even with very long simulation runs at the lowest\ntemperature that we can access with ergodic simulations. The medium displays\nthe usual features of supercooled materials and a non-Arrhenius dependence of\nthe diffusion coefficient and alpha relaxation time with temperature. We also\nobserve the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation at low temperatures.\n", "  Optoelectronic excitations in monolayer MoS2 manifest from a hierarchy of\nelectrically tunable, Coulombic free-carrier and excitonic many-body phenomena.\nInvestigating the fundamental interactions underpinning these phenomena -\ncritical to both many-body physics exploration and device applications -\npresents challenges, however, due to a complex balance of competing\noptoelectronic effects and interdependent properties. Here, optical detection\nof bound- and free-carrier photoexcitations is used to directly quantify\ncarrier-induced changes of the quasiparticle band gap and exciton binding\nenergies. The results explicitly disentangle the competing effects and\nhighlight longstanding theoretical predictions of large carrier-induced band\ngap and exciton renormalization in 2D semiconductors.\n", "  The purpose of these notes, based on a series of 4 lectures given by the\nauthor at IHES, is to explain the recent proof of the DOZZ formula for the\nthree point correlation functions of Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT).\nWe first review the probabilistic construction of the $N$ point correlation\nfunctions of LCFT on the Riemann sphere for $N \\geq 3$ (based on a series of\nworks of the author with David, Kupiainen and Rhodes). We then explain the\nconstruction of the two point correlation functions of LCFT, also called\nreflection coefficient. These probabilistic constructions will be justified\nfrom the point of view of Polyakov's path integral formulation of LCFT.\nFinally, we explain the proof of the DOZZ formula for the three point\ncorrelation functions of LCFT (based on 2 papers by the author with Kupiainen\nand Rhodes).\n", "  Inspired by the ever-increasing demand for higher data transmission rates and\nthe tremendous attention toward all-optical signal processing based on\nminiaturized nanophotonics, in this paper, for the first time, we investigate\nthe integrable design of coherent ultrashort light pulse code-division\nmultiple-access (CDMA) technique, also known as femtosecond CDMA, using\nall-dielectric metasurfaces (MSs). In this technique, the data bits are firstly\nmodulated using ultrashort femtosecond optical pulses generated by mode-locked\nlasers, and then by employing a unique phase metamask for each data stream, in\norder to provide the multiple access capability, the optical signals are\nspectrally encoded. This procedure spreads the optical signal in the temporal\ndomain and generates low-intensity pseudo-noise bursts through random phase\ncoding leading to minimized multiple access interference. This paper\ncomprehensively presents the principles and design approach to realize\nfundamental components of a typical femtosecond CDMA encoder, including the\ngrating, lens, and phase mask, by employing high-contrast CMOS-compatible MSs.\nBy controlling the interference between the provided Mie and Fabry-Perot\nresonance modes, we tailor the spectral and spatial responses of the impinging\nlight locally and independently. Accordingly, we design a MS-based grating with\nthe highest possible refracted angle and, in the meantime, the maximized\nefficiency which results in a reasonable diameter for the subsequent lens.\nMoreover, to design our MS-based lens commensurate with the spot size and\ndistance requirements of the pursuant phase mask, we leverage a new\noptimization method which splits the lens structure into central and peripheral\nparts, and then design the peripheral part using a collection of gratings\nconverging the impinging at the subsequent phase mask.\n", "  Cu-Sn-Zn coatings have been widely used in industry for their unique\nproperties, such as good conductivity, high corrosion resistance and excellent\nsolderability. To further improve the mechanical performance of Cu-Sn-Zn\ncoatings, powder-enhanced method was applied in the current study and\nCu-Sn-Zn-TiO2 nano-composite coatings with different TiO2 concentration were\nfabricated. The microstructure of Cu-Sn-Zn-TiO2 nano-composite coatings were\ninvestigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).\nThe mechanical properties of coatings including microhardness and wear\nresistance were studied. The results indicate that the incorporation of TiO2\nnanoparticle can significantly influence the properties of Cu-Sn-Zn coatings.\nThe microhardness of Cu-Sn-Zn coating was increased to 383 HV from 330 HV with\n1g/L TiO2 addition. Also, the corrosion resistance of coating was enhanced. The\neffects of TiO2 nanoparticle concentration on the microstructure, mechanical\nproperties and corrosion resistance of Cu-Sn-Zn-TiO2 nano-composite coatings\nwere discussed.\n", "  We study discretizations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,\nwritten in the newly developed energy-momentum-angular momentum conserving\n(EMAC) formulation. We consider linearizations of the problem, which at each\ntime step will reduce the computational cost, but can alter the conservation\nproperties. We show that a skew-symmetrized linearization delivers the correct\nbalance of (only) energy and that the Newton linearization conserves momentum\nand angular momentum, but conserves energy only up to the nonlinear residual.\nNumerical tests show that linearizing with 2 Newton steps at each time step is\nvery effective at preserving all conservation laws at once, and giving accurate\nanswers on long time intervals. The tests also show that the skew-symmetrized\nlinearization is significantly less accurate. The tests also show that the\nNewton linearization of EMAC finite element formulation compares favorably to\nother traditionally used finite element formulation of the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations in primitive variables.\n", "  Arctic coastal morphology is governed by multiple factors, many of which are\naffected by climatological changes. As the season length for shorefast ice\ndecreases and temperatures warm permafrost soils, coastlines are more\nsusceptible to erosion from storm waves. Such coastal erosion is a concern,\nsince the majority of the population centers and infrastructure in the Arctic\nare located near the coasts. Stakeholders and decision makers increasingly need\nmodels capable of scenario-based predictions to assess and mitigate the effects\nof coastal morphology on infrastructure and land use. Our research uses\nGaussian process models to forecast Arctic coastal erosion along the Beaufort\nSea near Drew Point, AK. Gaussian process regression is a data-driven modeling\nmethodology capable of extracting patterns and trends from data-sparse\nenvironments such as remote Arctic coastlines. To train our model, we use\nannual coastline positions and near-shore summer temperature averages from\nexisting datasets and extend these data by extracting additional coastlines\nfrom satellite imagery. We combine our calibrated models with future climate\nmodels to generate a range of plausible future erosion scenarios. Our results\nshow that the Gaussian process methodology substantially improves yearly\npredictions compared to linear and nonlinear least squares methods, and is\ncapable of generating detailed forecasts suitable for use by decision makers.\n", "  Recently the STAR Collaboration discovered the \"subatomic swirls\", that is,\nthe most vortical fluid flow structures in the quark-gluon plasma produced via\nthe AuAu collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Published in\nNature and featured as a cover story, this discovery attracted significant\ninterest and generated wide enthusiasm. For such an important finding, it is\ncrucial to look for independent evidences of confirmation and to critically\ntest the current interpretation of the global polarization measurement. We\nsuggest that the CuCu and CuAu colliding systems at RHIC provide such\nopportunity. Interestingly, our calculations reveal that the fluid vorticity in\nthe CuCu or CuAu collision is comparable to that in the AuAu Collision.\nSurprisingly, we find the computed $\\Lambda$ hyperon polarization effect is\nstronger in the CuCu and CuAu systems than the AuAu system at the same\ncollisional beam energy and centrality class, with an interesting hierarchy\nCuCu $>$ CuAu $>$ AuAu due to interplay between $\\Lambda$ production timing and\nthe time evolution of the vorticity. These predictions can be readily tested by\nexperimental data.\n", "  A new method to compute correlation functions in AdS$_{d+1}$ in general\ndimension is introduced, considering a particle quantised in the worldline\nformalism of quantum field theory, coupled to bulk fields, in particular\ngravity, quantised in the standard manner. This gives a systematic\ntwo-parameter perturbative expansion organised by small parameters $G_N$ and\nthe inverse mass of the particle, complementary to the usual Witten diagram\nexpansion. This connects closely to CFT language, with the geodesic Witten\ndiagram representation of global conformal blocks emerging naturally, and for\ntwo dimensions gives a bulk representation of the Virasoro block, with a\nsystematic method for computing quantum corrections. The global conformal block\nand other contributions are shown to exponentiate in correlation functions in\nany dimension, corresponding to pieces of Witten diagrams at arbitrary loop\norder.\n", "  We provide an introduction to the mathematics and physics of the deformed\nHermitian-Yang-Mills equation, a fully nonlinear geometric PDE on Kahler\nmanifolds which plays an important role in mirror symmetry. We discuss the\nphysical origin of the equation, and some recent progress towards its solution.\nIn dimension 3 we prove a new Chern number inequality and discuss the\nrelationship with algebraic stability conditions.\n", "  Bulk tellurium (Te) is composed of one-dimensional (1D) helical chains which\nhave been considered to be coupled by van der Waals (vdW) interactions.\nHowever, based on first-principles density-functional theory calculations, we\nhere propose a different bonding nature between neighboring chains: i.e., the\nhelical chains made of normal covalent bonds are connected together by\ncoordinate covalent bonds. It is revealed that the lone pairs of electrons of\nTe atom participate in forming coordinate covalent bonds between neighboring\nchains. Therefore, each Te atom behaves as both electron donor to neighboring\nchains and electron acceptor from neighboring chains. This ligand-metal-like\nbonding nature in bulk Te results in the same order of bulk moduli along the\ndirections parallel and perpendicular to the chains, contrasting with the large\nanisotropy of bulk moduli in vdW crystals. We further find that the electron\neffective masses parallel and perpendicular to the chains are almost the same\neach other, consistent with the observed nearly isotropic electrical\nresistivity. It is thus demonstrated that the normal/coordinate covalent bonds\nparallel/perpendicular to the chains in bulk Te lead to a minor anisotropy in\nstructural and transport properties, distinct from a strong anisotropy observed\nin the typical two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials such as graphite and MoS$_2$.\n", "  An accurate method is developed to extract the spin-orbit effective fields\nthrough analysis of the results of harmonic Hall voltage measurements by\nderiving detailed analytical equations, in which both the z-component of the\napplied magnetic field and the second-order perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nare taken into account. The method is tested by analyzing the results of a\nmacrospin simulation. The spin-orbit effective fields extracted from the\nanalysis are found to be in excellent agreement with the input spin-orbit\neffective fields used for the macrospin simulation over the entire range of the\npolar magnetization angle and a wide range (0-2) of the ratio of the planar to\nthe anomalous Hall voltage considered in this study. The accuracy of the\nproposed method is demonstrated more clearly via a systematic study involving a\ncomparison of its results with those of the conventional analytical method.\n", "  High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are neutral or ionised gas clouds in the vicinity\nof the Milky Way that are characterised by high radial velocities inconsistent\nwith participation in the regular rotation of the Galactic disc. Previous\nattempts to create a homogeneous all-sky HI map of HVCs have been hampered by a\ncombination of poor angular resolution, limited surface brightness sensitivity\nand suboptimal sampling. Here, a new and improved HI map of Galactic HVCs based\non the all-sky HI4PI survey is presented. The new map is fully sampled and\nprovides significantly better angular resolution (16.2 versus 36 arcmin) and\ncolumn density sensitivity (2.3 versus 3.7 * 10^18 cm^-2 at the native\nresolution) than the previously available LAB survey. The new HVC map resolves\nmany of the major HVC complexes in the sky into an intricate network of narrow\nHI filaments and clumps that were not previously resolved by the LAB survey.\nThe resulting sky coverage fraction of high-velocity HI emission above a column\ndensity level of 2 * 10^18 cm^-2 is approximately 15 per cent, which reduces to\nabout 13 per cent when the Magellanic Clouds and other non-HVC emission are\nremoved. The differential sky coverage fraction as a function of column density\nobeys a truncated power law with an exponent of -0.93 and a turnover point at\nabout 5 * 10^19 cm^-2. HI column density and velocity maps of the HVC sky are\nmade publicly available as FITS images for scientific use by the community.\n", "  We propose a quasi-degenerate dark matter scenario to simultaneously explain\nthe $1.4\\,\\textrm{TeV}$ peak in the high-energy cosmic-ray electron-positron\nspectrum reported by the DAMPE collaboration very recently and the\n$3.5\\,\\textrm{keV}$ X-ray line observed in galaxies clusters and from the\nGalactic centre and confirmed by the Chandra and NuSTAR satellites. We consider\na dark $SU(2)'\\times U(1)'$ gauge symmetry under which the dark matter is a\nDirac fermion doublet composed of two $SU(2)'$ doublets with non-trivial\n$U(1)'$ charges. At one-loop level the two dark fermion components can have a\nmass split as a result of the dark gauge symmetry breaking. Through the\nexchange of a mediator scalar doublet the two quasi-degenerate dark fermions\ncan mostly annihilate into the electron-positron pairs at tree level for\nexplaining the $1.4\\,\\textrm{TeV}$ positron anomaly, meanwhile, the heavy dark\nfermion can very slowly decay into the light dark fermion with a photon at\none-loop level for explaining the $3.5\\,\\textrm{keV}$ X-ray line. Our dark\nfermions can be also verified in the direct detection experiments.\n", "  The procedure for deriving the Ward-Takahashi identity is applied to the\npseudovector coupling pion-nucleon system in which the isovector and\naxial-vector current does not conserved. The relation is given in closed form\nalthough it is more complicated than that of the quantum electrodynamics. The\napplication to the propagator has revealed the interesting results.\n", "  We propose two possibilities to explain an excess of electron/positron flux\naround 1.4 TeV recently reported by Dark Matter Explore (DAMPE) in the\nframework of radiative seesaw models where one of them provides a fermionic\ndark matter candidate, and the other one provides a bosonic dark matter\ncandidate. We also show unique features of both models regarding neutrino mass\nstructure.\n", "  The aim of this study was to characterize different calcium phosphate\ncoatings and evaluate in vitro cell response of these materials to ceramics\nimplants. The physical and chemical properties of calcium phosphate coatings\nformed by RF-magnetron sputtering of calcium phosphate tribasic,\nhydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate monobasic, calcium phosphate dibasic\ndihydrate and calcium pyrophosphate powders were characterized. Cell adhesion\nand cell viability were examined on calcium phosphate coatings using\nmesenchymal stem cells. The results of cytotoxicity measurements of the calcium\nphosphate coatings revealed that only the coating obtained by RF-magnetron\nsputtering of the calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate and calcium phosphate\ntribasic powders possessed lower cell viability than the zirconia substrate.\nThe coating formed by sputtering of the calcium phosphate tribasic powder\ndemonstrated more cells adhered onto its surface compared with other calcium\nphosphate coatings.\n", "  The Yajima-Oikawa (YO) system describes the resonant interaction between long\nand short waves under certain condition. In this paper, through the KP\nhierarchy reduction, we construct the breather solutions for the YO system in\none- and two-dimensional cases. Similar to Akhmediev and Kuznetsov-Ma breather\nsolutions (the wavenumber k_i->ik_i) for the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, is\nshown that the YO system have two kinds ofbreather solutions with the relations\np_{2k-1}->ip_{2k-1}, p_{2k}->-ip_{2k}, q_{2k-1}->iq_{2k-1} and\nq_{2k}->-iq_{2k}, in which the homoclinic orbit and dark soliton solutions are\ntwo special cases respectively. Furthermore, taking the long wave limit, we\nderive the rational and rational and rational-exp solutions which contain lump,\nline rogue wave, soliton and their mixed cases. By considering the further\nreduction, such solutions can be reduced to one-dimensional YO system.\n", "  Electrons confined to two dimensions display an unexpected diversity of\nbehaviors as they are cooled to absolute zero. Noninteracting electrons are\npredicted to eventually \"localize\" into an insulating ground state, and it has\nlong been supposed that electron correlations stabilize only one other phase:\nsuperconductivity. However, many two-dimensional (2D) superconducting materials\nhave shown surprising evidence for metallic behavior, where the electrical\nresistivity saturates in the zero-temperature limit, the nature of this\nunexpected metallic state remains under intense scrutiny. We report electrical\ntransport properties for two disordered 2D superconductors, indium oxide and\ntantalum nitride, and observe a magnetic field-tuned transition from a true\nsuperconductor to a metallic phase with saturated resistivity. This metallic\nphase is characterized by a vanishing Hall resistivity, suggesting that it\nretains particle-hole symmetry from the disrupted superconducting state.\n", "  A combination of a steady-state preserving operator splitting method and a\nsemi-implicit integration scheme is proposed for efficient time stepping in\nsimulations of unsteady reacting flows, such as turbulent flames, using\ndetailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. The operator splitting is based on the\nSimpler balanced splitting method, which is constructed with improved stability\nproperties and reduced computational cost. The method is shown to be capable of\nstable and accurate prediction of ignition and extinction for\nreaction-diffusion systems near critical conditions. The ROK4E scheme is\ndesigned for semi-implicit integration of spatially independent chemically\nreacting systems. Being a Rosenbrock-Krylov method, ROK4E utilizes the low-rank\napproximation of the Jacobian to reduce the cost for integrating the system of\nODEs that have relative few stiff components. The efficiency of the scheme is\nfurther improved via the careful choice of coefficients to require three\nright-hand-side evaluations over four stages. Combing these two methods,\nefficient calculation is achieved for large-scale parallel simulations of\nturbulent flames.\n", "  Galaxies with polar rings consist of two subsystems, a disk and a ring, which\nrotate almost in orthogonal planes. In this paper, we analyze the parameters\ncharacterizing the composition of the interstellar medium and star formation in\nstar-forming complexes, belonging to a polar ring galaxy NGC660. We show that\nstar-forming regions in the ring of the galaxy are distinctively different from\nthose in the galaxy disk. They possess substantially lower infrared\nluminosities, indicative of less dust mass in these regions than in a typical\ndisk star-forming region. UV and H$\\alpha$ luminosities also appear to be lower\nin the ring, probably, being a consequence of its relatively recent formation.\n", "  We explore the effect of different galactic disc environments on the\nproperties of star-forming clouds through variations in the background\npotential in a set of isolated galaxy simulations. Rising, falling and flat\nrotation curves expected in halo dominated, disc dominated and Milky Way-like\ngalaxies were considered, with and without an additional two-arm spiral\npotential. The evolution of each disc displayed notable variations that are\nattributed to different regimes of stability, determined by shear and\ngravitational collapse. The properties of a typical cloud were largely\nunaffected by the changes in rotation curve, but the production of small and\nlarge cloud associations was strongly dependent on this environment. This\nsuggests that while differing rotation curves can influence where clouds are\ninitially formed, the average bulk properties are effectively independent of\nthe global environment. The addition of a spiral perturbation made the greatest\ndifference to cloud properties, successfully sweeping the gas into larger,\nseemingly unbound, extended structures and creating large arm-interarm\ncontrasts.\n", "  The hot rotating nuclei could be formed in the complete and incomplete fusion\nreaction of two heavy ions. At low bombarding energies the reaction goes via\ncompound nucleus formation and subsequent evaporation of charged particles,\nneutrons and $\\gamma$-rays. However, with increasing the energy of the\nprojectile, the emission of particles during the equilibration process becomes\nmore and more probable. This effect can be estimated by the Heavy-Ion\nPhase-Space Exploration (HIPSE) code which describes the production of clusters\nof various size from nucleons initially in the target or projectile. This\ndynamic evolution finalizes with the compound nuclei, quasi-fission or\nmulti-fragmentation products. The hot rotating nuclei produced in fusion\nreaction can de-excitate by evaporation of particles and emission of\n$\\gamma$-rays from the Giant Dipole Resonance, or by fission into two\nfragments. These processes, evaporation and fission, are described within\nstatistical codes such as GEMINI++ or in dynamical approaches by solving the\ntransport equations of Langevin type. In the present article we will\nconcentrate on the possible effect of the pre-equilibrium emission on the\nstrength function of the effective Giant Dipole Resonance, which can be\ndescribed within Thermal Shape Fluctuation Model (TSFM) approach.\n", "  In the application of the combustion models based on low-dimensional\nmanifolds (for instance flamelet models) to large-eddy simulation (LES) of\nreactive turbulent flows, the modeling simplifications of the combustion\nprocess is a critical source of uncertainty in addition to those due to the\nturbulent closure model and numerical discretization. The ability to\nquantitatively assess this uncertainty in absence of the reference result is\nvital to the reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion\ndevices.In the present study, the Pareto-efficient combustion (PEC) framework\nis extended to adaptive LES combustion simulations of turbulent flames. The key\ncomponent of the PEC framework is the so-called manifold drift term. Its\nextension LES is proposed to make such assessment by examining the compliance\nof a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest with\nrespect to the underlying flow field representation. With the focus on\nimproving predictions of CO emissions of flamelet-based combustion models, this\nwork employs PEC to augment the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model through\nlocal sub-model assignment of the finite-rate chemistry (FRC) model. To this\nend, a series of LES-PEC calculations are performed on a piloted\npartially-premixed dimethyl ether flame (DME-D), using a combination of FPV and\nFRC models. The drift term is utilized in the PEC framework to the estimate the\nmodel related error for quantities of interest. The PEC approach is\ndemonstrated to be capable of significantly improving the prediction of CO\nemissions compared with the monolithic FPV simulation. The improved accuracy is\nachieved by enriching the FPV model with FRC in regions where the lower-order\nmodel is determined insufficient through the evaluation of drift terms.\n", "  Tunka-Rex (Tunka Radio Extension) is an antenna array for cosmic-ray\ndetection located in Siberia. Previous studies of cosmic rays with Tunka-Rex\nhave shown high precision in determining the energy of the primary particle and\nthe possibility to reconstruct the depth of the shower maximum. The next step\nis the reconstruction of the mass composition and the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays. One of the main problems appearing within this task is to estimate the\ndetection efficiency of the instrument, and the exposure of the observations.\nThe detection efficiency depends on properties of the primary cosmic rays, such\nas energy and arrival direction, as well as on many parameters of the\ninstrument: density of the array, efficiency of the receiving antennas,\nsignal-detection threshold, data-acquisition acceptance, and trigger\nproperties. More than that, the configuration of detector changes with time.\nDuring the measurements some parts of the detector can provide corrupted data\nor sometimes do not operate. All these features should be taken into account\nfor an estimation of the detection efficiency. For each energy and arrival\ndirection we estimate the detection probability and effective area of the\ninstrument. To estimate the detection probability of a shower we use a simple\nMonte Carlo model, which predicts the size of the footprint of the radio\nemission as function of the primary energy and arrival direction (taking into\naccount the geometry of Earth's magnetic field). Combining these approaches we\ncalculate the event statistics and exposure for each run. This is the first\naccurate study of the exposure for irregular large-scale radio arrays taking\ninto account most important features of detection, which will be used for the\nmeasurement of primary cosmic-ray spectra with Tunka-Rex.\n", "  Essential to each other, growth and exploration are jointly observed in\npopulations, be it alive such as animals and cells or inanimate such as goods\nand money. But their ability to move, crucial to cope with uncertainty and\noptimize returns, is tempered by the space/time properties of the environment.\nWe investigate how the environment shape optimal growth and population\ndistribution in such conditions. We uncover a trade-off between risks and\nreturns by revisiting a common growth model over general graphs. Our results\nreveal a rich and nuanced picture: fruitful strategies commonly lead to risky\npositions, but this tension may nonetheless be alleviated by the geometry of\nthe explored space. The applicability of our conclusions is subsequently\nillustrated over an empirical study of financial data.\n", "  We formulate notions of subadditivity and additivity of the Yang-Mills action\nfunctional in noncommutative geometry. We identify a suitable hypothesis on\nspectral triples which proves that the Yang-Mills functional is always\nsubadditive, as per expectation. The additivity property is much stronger in\nthe sense that it implies the subadditivity property. Under this hypothesis we\nobtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the additivity of the\nYang-Mills functional. An instance of additivity is shown for the case of\nnoncommutative $n$-tori. We also investigate the behaviour of critical points\nof the Yang-Mills functional under additivity. At the end we discuss few\nexamples involving compact spin manifolds, matrix algebras, noncommutative\n$n$-torus and the quantum Heisenberg manifolds which validate our hypothesis.\n", "  We adopt a diffusive-Gutzwiller approach to investigate a phase transition in\na quadratically driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard lattice. Diffusive trajectories\nmay lead to lower average entanglement as compared to jump-like trajectories\nand have a natural tendency to approach coherent states, therefore the method\ncan be less prone to the bias induced by the fully uncorrelated Gutzwiller\nansatz. Averaging over trajectories does lead to classical correlations and\nthis allows us to address the correlation length of such 2D lattices of open\nquantum systems which is the main goal of this work. Under this approximations,\nwe find negligible correlation length in the low density phase and apparently\nunbounded length grow in the high density phase. Additionally, we show that the\neffective relaxation times associated to the times scales for synchronisation\nin the high density phase may also diverge suggesting the vanishing of the\nLindbladian gap.\n", "  In the last decades, the number of exotic candidates which are beyond the\nconventional quark model has grown dramatically. At the same time, numerous\ntheoretical interpretations, such as tetraquark, hybrid, hadroquarkonium and\nhadronic molecule, have been proposed to understand their nature. In principle,\nall the configurations with the same quantum numbers can mix with each other.\nThus at present we aim at identifying the prominent component. As an extended\nobject, a hadronic molecule has some distinguishable features from other more\ncompact configurations. In the end, the two $Z_b$ states are used to illustrate\nsome features of the molecular scenario.\n", "  Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is the widest used second generation semiconductor\nwith a direct band gap and increasingly used as nanofilms. However, the\nmagnetic properties of GaAs nanofilms have never been studied. Here we find by\ncomprehensive density functional theory calculations that GaAs nanofilms\ncleaved along the <111> and <100> directions become intrinsically metallic\nfilms with strong surface magnetism and magnetoelectric (ME) effect. The\nsurface magnetism and electrical conductivity are realized via a combined\neffect of transferring charge induced by spontaneous electric-polarization\nthrough the film thickness and spin-polarized surface states. The surface\nmagnetism of <111> nanofilms can be significantly and linearly tuned by\nvertically applied electric field, endowing the nanofilms unexpectedly high ME\ncoefficients, which are tens of times higher than those of ferromagnetic metals\nand transition metal oxides.\n", "  We consider a cosmological setup with the inflaton field in the presence of a\nredshift dependent Lorentz-violating time-like background to address the\ninflationary regime and other phases of the Universe. We also show that the\nregime of dark energy at large distances (low redshifts) is essentially\ndominated by the presence of the Lorentz-violating background.\n", "  [not part of Research Note] We report the discovery of a widely-separated\nlow-mass binary as a candidate member of the $\\sim$40 Myr Argus Association.\nResolved imaging and astrometry with 2MASS and LDSS-3 reveal a common proper\nmotion pair of red sources separated by 4.23''$\\pm$0.11'', with the secondary\nroughly one magnitude fainter at $i$, $z$ and $J$. Resolved spectroscopy\nindicates component types of M8pec and M9pec, the peculiarities arising from\nweak Na I and strong VO absorption characteristic of low gravity sources. With\nits small proper motion and estimated 75$\\pm$25 pc distance, the BANYAN II tool\nindicates a membership probability of 93% in Argus, which would be consistent\nwith a pair of brown dwarfs of mass $\\sim$0.04 M$_{\\odot}$ separated by\n$\\sim$300 AU.\n", "  In highly dissipative collisions between heavy ions, the optimal conditions\nto investigate different de-excitation channels of hot nuclei such as\nevaporation, fission or multifragmentation are well known. One crucial issue\nremains the excitation energy region where fission gives way to\nmultifragmentation. In this paper, the onset of multi-fragment exit channels is\ninvestigated in terms of sequential fission. For the first time, the dynamical\napproach based on solving Langevin transport equations in multidimensional\ncollective coordinate space is used to follow the de-excitation of highly\nexcited (up to E* =223-656 MeV) 248Rf compound nuclei. The sequential fission\nmodel we propose contains two steps: (1) time evolution of the compound nucleus\nup to either scission or residue formation, followed by (2) dynamical\ncalculations of each primary fragment separately. This procedure allows to\nobtain from one to four cold fragments correlated with the light particles\nemitted during the de-excitation process. Experimental data measured with the\nINDRA detector for the 129Xe+ natSn reaction at beam energies 8, 12 and 15\nMeV/nucleon provide strong constraints for this sequential fission scenario.\n", "  The Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) refer to the ripples of material\ndensity in the Universe. As the most direct density tracers in the universe,\ngalaxies have been commonly used in studies of BAO peak detection. The spatial\nnumber density of galaxies, to a certain extent, reflects the distribution of\nthe material density of our Universe. Using galaxies as matter tracers, we can\nconstruct more overlapping empty spheres (DT voids) than the matter tracers,\nvia Delaunay Triangulation technique. We show that their radii excellently\nreflect the galaxy number density round them, and they can serve as reliable\ndifferent density region tracers. Using the data from an unprecedented\nlarge-scale $N$-body simulation \"TianNu\", we conduct some fundamental\nstatistical studies and clustering analysis of the DT voids. We discuss in\ndetail the representative features of two-point correlation functions of\ndifferent DT void populations. We show that the peak, the position of which\ncorresponds to the average radius of data samples, is the most representative\nfeature of the two-point correlation function of the DT voids. In addition, we\nalso construct another voids, the disjoint voids, and investigate their some\nstatistical properties and clustering properties. And we find that the occupied\nspace of all disjoint voids accounts for about $45\\%$ of the volume of the\nsimulation box, regardless of the number density of mock galaxies. We also\ninvestigate the BAO detections based on different tracers, i.e. mock galaxies,\nlow-density region tracers, and high-density region tracers respectively. Our\nresults show that BAO intensities detected by low/high-density region tracers\nare enhanced significantly compared to the BAO detection by mock galaxies, for\nthe mock galaxy catalogue with the number density of $7.52\\times10^{-5}$ $h^3$\nMpc$^{-3}$.\n", "  We present an index for the local sensitivity of spatiotemporal structures in\ncoupled oscillatory systems based on the asymptotic scaling of local-in-space,\nfinite-time Lyapunov Exponents. For a system of nonlocally-coupled R\\\"{o}ssler\noscillators, we show that deviations of this index reflect the sensitivity to\nnoise and the onset of spatial chaos for the patterns where coherence and\nincoherence regions coexist.\n", "  Numerical problems are considered on general synchronization of chaotic\noscillators, through the evaluation of the Lower Bound Error index on two case\nstudies: a Lorenz system unidirectionally coupled to a Duffing system and a\nDuffing system unidirectionally coupled to a Rossler system. It was possible to\nobserve, in each case, that the behavior of the slave's LBE curve tends to\nfollow the behavior of the master's as the value of the coupling constant is\nincreased up to a certain value, and thus, that synchronization can affect\nnumerical calculations.\n", "  The wear of a cylindrical punch composed by two different materials\nalternatively distributed in annular forms is studied with the Method of\nDimensionality Reduction (MDR). The changes in surface topography and pressure\ndistribution during the wear process is obtained and validated by the Boundary\nElement Method (BEM). The pressure in each annular ring approaches constant in\na stationary state where the surface topography does not change any more.\nFurthermore, in an easier way, using the direct integration the limiting\nprofile in steady wear state is theoretically calculated, as well as the root\nmean square (RMS) of its surface gradient which is closely related to the\ncoefficient of friction between this kind of surface and an elastomer. The\ndependence on the wear coefficients and the width of the annular areas of two\nphases is obtained.\n", "  A variety of top quark mass measurements has been made in the recent years by\nthe CMS Collaboration. The most recent measurements performed at 8 TeV are\nreported here, along with a new measurement based on data collected in 2016 at\n13 TeV. The current combination of these measurements has a relative\nuncertainty smaller than 0.3%, making the top quark the most accurately\nmeasured quark.\n", "  We report the synthesis of polycrystalline (poly)-SiGe alloy thin films\nthrough solid state reaction of Si/Ge multilayer thin films on Si and glass\nsubstrates at low temperature of 500 {\\deg}C. The pristine thin film was\ndeposited using electron beam evaporation with optimized in-situ substrate\nheating. Our results show the co-existence of amorphous Si (a-Si) phase along\nwith the poly-SiGe phase in the pristine thin film. The a-Si phase was found to\nsubsume into the SiGe phase upon post deposition annealing in the temperature\nrange from 600 to 800 {\\deg}C. Additionally, dual energy band gaps could be\nobserved in the optical properties of the annealed poly-SiGe thin films. The\nstoichiometric evolution of the pristine thin film and its subsequent effect on\nthe band gap upon annealing are discussed on the basis of diffusion\ncharacteristics of Si in poly-SiGe.\n", "  Seven Earth-sized planets, TRAPPIST-1 system, were discovered in February\n2017. Three of these planets are in the habitable zone (HZ) of their star,\nmaking them potentially habitable planets a mere 40 light years away. Discovery\nof the closest potentially habitable planet to us just a year before --\nProxima~b, and a realization that Earth-type planets in HZ are a common\noccurrence provides the impetus to the pursuit for life outside the Solar\nSystem. The search for life has two goals: Earth similarity and habitability.\nAn index was recently proposed, Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score (CDHS), based\non Cobb-Douglas production function, which computes the habitability score by\nusing measured and estimated planetary parameters like radius, density, escape\nvelocity and surface temperature of a planet. The proposed metric with\nexponents accounting for metric elasticity, is endowed with analytical\nproperties that ensure global optima and can be scaled to accommodate a finite\nnumber of input parameters. We show that the model is elastic, and the\nconditions on elasticity to ensure global maxima can scale as the number of\npredictor parameters increase. K-Nearest Neighbour classification algorithm,\nembellished with probabilistic herding and thresholding restriction, utilizes\nCDHS scores and labels exoplanets to appropriate classes via feature-learning\nmethods. The algorithm works on top of a decision-theoretical model using the\npower of convex optimization and machine learning. A second approach, based on\na novel feature-learning and tree-building method classifies the same planets\nwithout computing the CDHS of the planets and produces a similar outcome. The\nconvergence of the two different approaches indicates the strength of the\nproposed scheme and the likelihood of the potential habitability of the recent\ndiscoveries.\n", "  We study the long-range force arising between two aggregates of ordinary\nmatter due to a neutrino-pair exchange, in the limit of zero neutrino mass.\nEven if matter is neutral of electric charge, it is charged for this weak\nforce. The interaction is described in terms of a coherent charge, which we\ncall the weak flavor charge of aggregated matter. For each one of the\ninteracting aggregates, this charge depends on the neutrino flavor as\n$Q_W^{\\nu_e} = 2Z-N$, $Q_W^{\\nu_\\mu} = Q_W^{\\nu_\\tau} = -N$, where $Z$ is the\nnumber of protons and $N$ the number of neutrons. $Q_W^{\\nu_e}$ depends\nexplicitly on $Z$ because of the charged current contribution to $\\nu_e e$\nelastic scattering, while the $N$ term in the three charges comes from the\nuniversal neutral current contribution. The effective potential describing this\nforce is repulsive and decreases as $r^{-5}$. Due to its specific behavior on\n$(Z,N)$ and $r$, this interaction is distinguishable from both gravitation and\nresidual electromagnetic forces. As neutrinos are massive and mixed, this\npotential is valid for $r\\lesssim 1/m_\\nu$, distances beyond which a\nYukawa-like attenuation kicks in.\n", "  In contrast to WIMPs, light Dark Matter candidates have increasingly come\nunder the focus of scientific interest. In particular the QCD axion is also\nable to solve other fundamental problems such as CP-conservation in strong\ninteractions. Galactic axions, axion-like particles and hidden photons can be\nconverted to photons at boundaries between materials of different dielectric\nconstants under a strong magnetic field. Combining many such surfaces, one can\nenhance this conversion significantly using constructive interference and\nresonances. The proposed MADMAX setup containing 80 high dielectric disks in a\n\\SI{10}{\\tesla} magnetic field would probe the well-motivated mass range of\n$40$--\\SI{400}{\\micro\\electronvolt}, a range which is at present inaccessible\nby existing cavity searches. We present the foundations of this approach and\nits expected sensitivity.\n", "  Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to measure the fundamental properties of\nstars and probe their interiors. This is particularly efficient for red giants\nbecause their modes are well detectable and give information on their deep\nlayers. However, the seismic relations used to infer the mass and radius of a\nstar have been calibrated on the Sun. Therefore, it is crucial to assess their\naccuracy for red giants which are not perfectly homologous to it. We study\neclipsing binaries with a giant component to test their validity. We identified\n16 systems for which we intend to compare the dynamical masses and radii\nobtained by combined photometry and spectroscopy to the values obtained from\nasteroseismology. In the present work, we illustrate our approach on a system\nfrom our sample.\n", "  Tunable plasmonic resonances across the visible and near infrared spectra\nhave provided novel ways to develop next-generation nanophotonic devices. In\nthis study, by using optothermally controllable phase-changing material (PCM),\nwe successfully induced highly tunable charge transfer plasmon (CTP) resonance\nmodes. To this end, we have designed a two-member dimer assembly including gold\ncores and Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) shells in distant, touching, and overlapping\nconditions. We successfully demonstrated that toggling between amorphous\n(dielectric) and crystalline (conductive) phases of GST allows for achieving\ntunable dipolar and CTP resonances along the near-infrared spectrum. The\nproposed dimer structures can help forming optothermally controlled devices\nwithout further geometrical variations in the geometry of the design, and\nhaving strong potential for advanced plasmon modulation and fast data routing.\n", "  Self-irradiation damages resulting from fission processes are common\nphenomena observed in nuclear fuel containing (NFC) materials. Numerous\n$\\alpha$-decays lead to local structure transformations in NFC materials. The\ndamages appearing due to the impacts of heavy nuclear recoils in the subsurface\nlayer can cause detachments of material particles. Such a behaviour is similar\nto sputtering processes observed during a bombardment of the material surface\nby a flux of energetic particles. However, in the NFC material, the impacts are\ninitiated from the bulk. In this work we propose a two-dimensional mesoscopic\nmodel to perform a stochastic simulation of the destruction processes occurring\nin a subsurface region of NFC material. We describe the erosion of the material\nsurface, the evolution of its roughness and predict the detachment of the\nmaterial particles. Size distributions of the emitted particles are obtained in\nthis study. The simulation results of the model are in a qualitative agreement\nwith the size histogram of particles produced from the material containing\nlava-like fuel formed during the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.\n", "  This work aims to present an analytical and numerical study of the\nmagnetocaloric effects (MCE) providing realistic proposals about materials that\nshould be chosen in the design of new refrigerator appliances around the room\ntemperature. Starting from a spin Hamiltonian including the exchange\ninteraction, the single-ion anisotropy and the applied magnetic field terms, we\nhave calculated the partition function at a given temperature and derived a set\nof relevant physical quantities as magnetization, magnetic entropy and specific\nheat and analyzed their behavior with atomic parameters as spin, exchange and\nanisotropy. Using numerical programs that we developed by ourselves, we were\nable to better elucidate the role of each microscopic parameter in order to\nreinforce the relative cooling power (RCP) and give rise to optimal\nperformances of the refrigerant compound. This approach could be extended to\ncomposite materials underscoring a giant MCE at room temperature.\n  Key-words Magnetic refrigeration, Magnetocaloric Effect, Energy efficiency,\nSpin Hamiltonian\n", "  Tissue engineering aims to grow artificial tissues \\emph{in vitro} to replace\nthose in the body that have been damaged through age, trauma or disease. A\nrecent approach to engineer artificial cartilage involves seeding cells within\na scaffold consisting of an interconnected 3D-printed lattice of polymer fibres\ncombined with a cast or printed hydrogel, and subjecting the construct\n(cell-seeded scaffold) to an applied load in a bioreactor. A key question is to\nunderstand how the applied load is distributed throughout the construct. To\naddress this, we employ homogenisation theory to derive equations governing the\neffective macroscale material properties of a periodic, elastic-poroelastic\ncomposite. We treat the fibres as a linear elastic material and the hydrogel as\na poroelastic material, and exploit the disparate length scales (small\ninter-fibre spacing compared with construct dimensions) to derive macroscale\nequations governing the response of the composite to an applied load. This\nhomogenised description reflects the orthotropic nature of the composite. To\nvalidate the model, solutions from finite element simulations of the\nmacroscale, homogenised equations are compared to experimental data describing\nthe unconfined compression of the fibre-reinforced hydrogels. The model is used\nto derive the bulk mechanical properties of a cylindrical construct of the\ncomposite material for a range of fibre spacings, and to determine the local\nmechanical environment experienced by cells embedded within the construct.\n", "  The use of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers is the method of\nchoice for the conversion of solar energy when frequently occurring changes of\nthe current load are an issue. However, this technique requires electrolytes\nwith low pH. All oxygen evolving electrodes working durably and actively in\nacids contain IrOx. Due to their scarcity and high acquisition costs, noble\nelements like Pt, Ru and Ir need to be replaced by earth abundant elements. We\nhave evaluated a cobalt containing steel for use as an oxygen-forming electrode\nin H2SO4. We found that the dissolving of ingredients out of the steel\nelectrode at oxidative potential in sulfuric acid, which is a well-known,\nserious issue, can be substantially reduced when the steel is electro-oxidized\nin LiOH prior to electrocatalysis. Under optimized synthesis conditions a\ncobalt-containing tool steel was rendered into a durable oxygen evolution\nreaction (OER) electrocatalyst (weight loss: 39 mug mm-2 after 50 000 s of\nchronopotentiometry at pH 1) that exhibits overpotentials down to 574 mV at 10\nmA cm-2 current density at pH 1. Focused ion beam SEM FIB-SEM) was successfully\nused to create a structure-stability relationship.\n", "  Analytical theory of large size intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) in\nanharmonic two-atomic chain is presented. It is shown that ILMs with\nfrequencies close to the borders of phonon gap are govern by quartic\nanharmonicity while the effect of cubic anharmonicity is essentially reduced.\nThis reduction effect is a consequence of small amplitude of vibrations of\nevery second atom. As a result, an ILM cannot split down from the optical\nphonon band, in contradiction with the commonly accepted point of view. But it\ncan spit up from the top of the acoustic phonon band making possible the\nexistence of the ILM with the frequencies above the top of this band. It is\npredicted that analogous reduction of cubic anharmonicity should exist\ngenerally for even ILMs with the middle atom being at rest; it may allow the\nexistence of ILMs with the frequencies above the top of the phonon spectrum in\ndifferent lattices with realistic atomic pair-potentials.\n", "  We report on X-ray observations of the radio-intermediate, X-ray bright\nSeyfert 1 galaxy, III Zw 2, obtained with XMM-Newton, Suzaku, and Swift over\nthe past 17-years. The source brightness varies significantly over yearly time\nscales, but more modestly over periods of days. Pointed observations with\nXMM-Newton in 2000 and Suzaku in 2011 show spectral differences despite\ncomparable X-ray fluxes. The Suzaku spectra are consistent with a power law\ncontinuum and a narrow Gaussian emission feature at ~6.4 keV, whereas the\nearlier XMM-Newton spectrum requires a broader Gaussian profile and soft-excess\nbelow ~2 keV. A potential interpretation is that the primary power law\nemission, perhaps from a jet base, preferentially illuminates the inner\naccretion disc in 2000, but the distant torus in 2011. The interpretation could\nbe consistent with the hypothesised precessing radio jet in III Zw 2 that may\nhave originated from disc instabilities due to an ongoing merging event.\n", "  We study the dynamics of expansion of the homogeneous isotropic Universe and\nthe evolution of its components in the model with nonminimally coupled\ndynamical dark energy. Dark energy, like the other components of the Universe,\nis described by the perfect fluid approximation with the equation of state\n(EoS) $p_ {de}=w\\rho_{de}$, where the EoS parameter $w$ depends on time and is\nparameterized via the squared adiabatic sound speed $c_{ a}^2$ which is assumed\nto be constant. On basis of the general covariant conservation equations for\nthe interacting dark energy and dark matter and Einstein equations in\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric we analyze the evolution of energy\ndensities of the hidden components and the dynamics of expansion of the\nUniverse with two types of interaction: proportional to the sum of densities of\nthe hidden components and proportional to their product. For the first\ninteraction the analytical expressions for the densities of dark energy and\ndark matter were obtained and analyzed in detail. For the second one the\nevolution of densities of hidden components of the Universe was analyzed on\nbasis of the numerical solutions of their energy-momentum conservation\nequations. For certain values of the parameters of these models the energy\ndensities of dark components become negative. So to ensure that the densities\nare always positive we put constraints on the interaction parameter for both\nmodels.\n", "  A high-performance gas kinetic solver using multi-level parallelization is\ndeveloped to enable pore-scale simulations of rarefied flows in porous media.\nThe Boltzmann model equation is solved by the discrete velocity method with an\niterative scheme. The multi-level MPI/OpenMP parallelization is implemented\nwith the aim to efficiently utilise the computational resources to allow direct\nsimulation of rarefied gas flows in porous media based on digital rock images\nfor the first time. The multi-level parallel approach is analyzed in details\nconfirming its better performance than the commonly-used MPI processing alone\nfor an iterative scheme. With high communication efficiency and appropriate\nload balancing among CPU processes, parallel efficiency of 94% is achieved for\n1536 cores in the 2D simulations, and 81% for 12288 cores in the 3D\nsimulations. While decomposition in the spatial space does not affect the\nsimulation results, one additional benefit of this approach is that the number\nof subdomains can be kept minimal to avoid deterioration of the convergence\nrate of the iteration process. This multi-level parallel approach can be\nreadily extended to solve other Boltzmann model equations.\n", "  The very recent result of the DAMPE cosmic ray spectrum of electrons shows a\nnarrow bump above the background at around 1.4 TeV. We attempt to explain the\nDAMPE electron excess in a simplified Kaluza-Klein graviton-mediated dark\nmatter model, in which the graviton only interacts with leptons and dark\nmatter. The related phenomenological discussions are given and this simplified\ngraviton-mediated dark matter model has the potential to be cross-tested in\nfuture lepton collider experiments.\n", "  Optical observations cannot resolve the structure of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), and a unified model for AGN was inferred mostly from indirect methods.\nOptical reverberation mapping allowed us to constrain the spatial dimension of\nthe broad emission line region and thereby to measure the mass of supermassive\nblack holes. Recently, reverberation was also applied to the polarized signal\nemerging from different AGN components. In principle, this should allow us to\nmeasure the spatial dimensions of the sub-parsec reprocessing media. We modeled\nscattering-induced polarization and tested different geometries for the\ncircumnuclear dust component. Our tests included the effects of clumpiness and\ndifferent dust prescriptions. To further extend the model, we also explored the\neffects of additional ionized winds stretched along the polar direction, and of\nan equatorial scattering ring that is responsible for the polarization angle\nobserved in pole-on AGN. The simulations were run using a time-dependent\nversion of the {\\sc stokes} code. Our modeling confirms the previously found\npolarization characteristics as a function of the observer`s viewing angle.\nWhen the dust adopts a flared-disk geometry, the lags reveal a clear difference\nbetween type 1 and type 2 AGN. This distinction is less clear for a torus\ngeometry where the time lag is more sensitive to the geometry and optical depth\nof the inner surface layers of the funnel. The presence of a scattering\nequatorial ring and ionized outflows increased the recorded polarization time\nlags, and the polar outflows smooths out dependence on viewing angle. Together\nwith other AGN observables, the polarization time lag places new, independent\nconstraints on the inner geometry of AGN. If we conduct time-dependent\nspectropolarimetric observing campaigns of AGN, this method has a high\npotential for a census of supermassive black holes.\n", "  Over the course of the last decade, the cost of marine robotic platforms has\nsignificantly decreased. In part this has lowered the barriers to entry of\nexploring and monitoring larger areas of the earth's oceans. However, these\nadvances have been mostly focused on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) or\nshallow water autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). One of the main drivers\nfor high cost in the deep water domain is the challenge of localizing such\nvehicles using acoustics. A low cost one-way travel time underwater ranging\nsystem is proposed to assist in localizing deep water submersibles. The system\nconsists of location aware anchor buoys at the surface and underwater nodes.\nThis paper presents a comparison of methods together with details on the\nphysical implementation to allow its integration into a deep sea micro AUV\ncurrently in development. Additional simulation results show error reductions\nby a factor of three.\n", "  We propose and realize a tunable plasmonic nanoantenna design consisting of\ntwo stacked Ag cuboids that are integrated into a rolled-up semiconductor\nmicrotube. The antenna's resonance is tuned by varying the cuboid's distance to\nmatch the photoluminescence emission of an embedded GaAs quantum well.\nSpatially, spectrally and temporally resolved photoluminescence measurements\nreveal a redshift and a reduction in lifetime of the quantum-well emission as\nsignatures for the coupling to the antenna system. By means of finite-element\nelectromagnetic simulations, we assign the coupling to an excitation of a\nhigh-order plasmonic mode inside the Ag cuboids.\n", "  As experimental constraints on DM interactions become ever more sensitive and\npush into new regimes of DM mass, it becomes more and more challenging to\naccurately model the process by which Dark Matter particles lose energy through\nscattering in the Earth's surface or other overburdens. We show that a\ncommonly-used approximation due to Starkman, Gould, Esmailzadeh and Dimopoulos\n(SGED) can fail badly in computing the attenuation, even while being useful for\nan order-of-magnitude estimate of the maximum cross section reach. We introduce\na method of importance sampling which makes Monte-Carlo simulation of energy\nloss feasible, in spite of factor-$10^7$ or greater attenuation. We demonstrate\nthe validity of our new method and expose multiple problems with the SGED\napproximation, this reveals interesting features of the energy loss process. We\nspot-check the recent Emken, Kouvaris and Shoemaker \"$5\\,\\Delta v$\"\nprescription to place limits on cross sections based on a limited-statistics\nanalysis, and find that an accurate simulation yields a factor of\n$\\rm{4.4\\times10^6}$ and $\\rm{2.4\\times10^4}$ larger number of events, for 50\nMeV and 1 GeV DM mass respectively, than if the EKS $5\\,\\Delta v$ prescription\nwere valid.\n", "  General $N$-solitons in three recently-proposed nonlocal nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations are presented. These nonlocal equations include the\nreverse-space, reverse-time, and reverse-space-time nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations, which are nonlocal reductions of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur\n(AKNS) hierarchy. It is shown that general $N$-solitons in these different\nequations can be derived from the same Riemann-Hilbert solutions of the AKNS\nhierarchy, except that symmetry relations on the scattering data are different\nfor these equations. This Riemann-Hilbert framework allows us to identify new\ntypes of solitons with novel eigenvalue configurations in the spectral plane.\nDynamics of $N$-solitons in these equations is also explored. In all the three\nnonlocal equations, a generic feature of their solutions is repeated\ncollapsing. In addition, multi-solitons can behave very differently from\nfundamental solitons and may not correspond to a nonlinear superposition of\nfundamental solitons.\n", "  We consider the effect of phase center motion of mechanically steerable\nhigh-gain parabolic antennas for ground-based and spacecraft-mounted antennas.\nFor spacecrafts on highly elliptic Earth orbits the magnitude of the effect is\nas large as several mm/s in terms of the required velocity correction, both for\nground-based and spacecraft-mounted antennas. We illustrate this with real data\nfrom the RadioAstron spacecraft and also provide results of our simulations for\nthe concept of a possible follow-up space very long baseline radio astronomy\nmission. We also consider a specific configuration of satellite communication\nlinks, with simultaneously operating one-way down link and two-way loop link,\npioneered by the Gravity Probe A experiment. We find that this configuration\nprovides for complete compensation of the phase center motion effect due to the\nonboard antenna and significant compensation of that due to the ground antenna.\nThis result is important for future space-based fundamental physics\nexperiments, primarily those concerned with studies of gravity.\n", "  In the present study, we delineate the effect of introducing flow\nobstructions on streaming potential and energy conversion efficiency in a\nnarrow fluidic confinement taking into consideration the wall hydrodynamic\nslip, finite ionic size, and local permittivity variation effects. We consider\ntwo types of the geometric pattern of flow obstacle between which regular\npattern turns out to be more effective. It is observed that, implementing\nstructured flow obstacles of radii greater than 10% of channel height and\ncharge density ratio (charge density of flow obstacle surface to that of\nchannel wall) greater than or equal to 9 renders significant enhancement of\npower generation efficiency. On the other hand, it is effective to operate at a\ncharge density ratio~1 for obstacles radii less than or equal to 10% of channel\nheight. An effective normalized pitch length of magnitude 0.6 or above has to\nbe maintained in order to obtain optimum energy conversion efficiency. We found\nthat implementation of charged flow obstacle causes a significant enhancement\nof energy conversion efficiency (~18% with regular pattern) comparing to planar\nslit channel (~4%) without considering wall hydrodynamic slip and steric\neffects. Introducing finite ionic size and wall hydrodynamic slip effect,\npertinent to flows in narrow confinement, leads to further enhancement in\nelectrokinetic energy conversion efficiency.\n", "  The two-dimensional electron system in an InAs quantum well has emerged as a\nprime candidate for hosting exotic quasi-particles with non-Abelian statistics\nsuch as Majorana fermions and parafermions. To attain its full promise,\nhowever, the electron system has to be clean enough to exhibit\nelectron-electron interaction phenomena. Here we report the observation of\nfractional quantum Hall effect in a very low disorder InAs quantum well with a\nwell-width of 24 nm, containing a two-dimensional electron system with a\ndensity $n=7.8 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ and low-temperature mobility $1.8\n\\times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs. At a temperature of $\\simeq35$ mK and $B\\simeq24$ T, we\nobserve a deep minimum in the longitudinal resistance, accompanied by a nearly\nquantized Hall plateau at Landau level filling factor $\\nu=4/3$.\n", "  Using the interpretation of certain generalised Donaldson-Thomas invariants,\nincluding stable pairs curve counts, as the monodromy of a flat connection on a\nformal principal bundle, we show that the conjectural Gopakumar-Vafa\ncontributions of all genera to the Gromov-Witten partition function appear in\nthe asymptotics of the corresponding flat sections. The Fourier-Laplace\nintegrals used to produce flat sections lead naturally to the GW/DT change of\nvariable -q = e^{i u}.\n", "  The idea that gauge theory has 'surplus' structure poses a puzzle: in one\nmuch discussed sense, this structure is redundant; but on the other hand, it is\nalso widely held to play an essential role in the theory. In this paper, we\nemploy category-theoretic tools to illuminate an aspect of this puzzle. We\nprecisify what is meant by 'surplus' structure by means of functorial\ncomparisons with equivalence classes of gauge fields, and then show that such\nstructure is essential for any theory that represents a rich collection of\nphysically relevant fields which are 'local' in nature.\n", "  A computing platform based on low temperature superconductors (LTS) has\nalready been proven both theoretically and experimentally. However, qubits\nbased on high Tc superconductors (HTS) are not yet well understood. Here we\nstudy the Andreev bounds states (ABS) in the later materials in order to show\nthat a formal correspondence exists between the Mathieu levels in a Cooper Pair\nBox qubit built with LTS and the Andreev levels in HTS junctions.\n", "  Elasto-plastic models are among the most successful ways to study the\ncritical properties of the plastic yielding transition of amorphous solids.\nTypically these models are studied under a condition of constant transition\nrates from one plastic configuration to another, and in this form they predict\nthe existence of well defined critical exponents that display universality, in\nthe same sense that in standard equilibrium phase transitions. I show however\nthat very naturally the transition rates must not be taken as a constant, but\ndependent of the local stress excess above the critical value. This\nmodification in the model is seen to affect the values of some of the exponents\nof the transition, concretely, of the dynamical exponents that are related to\nthe speed at which the system is driven. I argue about the reason for this\ndependence, claiming that it is due to the quasi-mean field nature of the\nplastic yielding transition originated in the fact that elastic interactions\nare long range.\n", "  The solar dynamo and the solar Global internal Magnetic Structure (GMS)\nappear to be a thin ($\\sim$2 Mm thick) structure near ($\\sim$1 Mm below) the\nsolar surface. Evidence for these properties are found from the amplitude of\nthe torsional oscillations and in their velocity contours relationship to solar\nmagnetogram; the power to the chromosphere; power to the corona and the solar\nwind; the current in the helio-current-sheet measured at the radius of the\norbit of Earth; the calculated size ($\\sim$1 Mm) of the expanding polar flux\nwhen it enters the photosphere; and from the observation that solar magnetic\nactivity is generated near the surface. A thin stable minimum energy state\nseems to be covering most of the solar surface just below the photosphere. The\nmagnetic field lines should be parallel to the solar surface and rotate with\ndistance from the surface for 2$\\pi$ radians in $\\sim$2 Mm. Resistive diffusion\nhelps to push the magnetic fields to the surface and the GMS seems to lose\n$\\pi$ radians every 11 years, causing the observed 180$^\\circ$ flipping of the\nsolar magnetic fields including the flipping of the polar flux. Further\nevidence for this GMS and its loss is that solar prominences are made of thin\nsheets of magnetized plasma, which are, likely, remnants of the lost thin sheet\nof the GMS. The loss process is consistent with the butterfly pattern of the\nsunspots and with the differences observed between solar maximum and solar\nminimum in the corona. The solar dynamo drives current parallel to the polar\nflux, which, in turn, sustains the GMS using cross-field current drive. For\ncompleteness, the formation of sunspots, CMEs and flares is discussed.\n", "  The progress in the field of neural computation hinges on the use of hardware\nmore efficient than the conventional microprocessors. Recent works have shown\nthat mixed-signal integrated memristive circuits, especially their passive\n('0T1R') variety, may increase the neuromorphic network performance\ndramatically, leaving far behind their digital counterparts. The major\nobstacle, however, is relatively immature memristor technology so that only\nlimited functionality has been demonstrated to date. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate operation of one-hidden layer perceptron classifier entirely in the\nmixed-signal integrated hardware, comprised of two passive 20x20 metal-oxide\nmemristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with discrete CMOS components. The\ndemonstrated multilayer perceptron network, whose complexity is almost 10x\nhigher as compared to previously reported functional neuromorphic classifiers\nbased on passive memristive circuits, achieves classification fidelity within 3\npercent of that obtained in simulations, when using ex-situ training approach.\nThe successful demonstration was facilitated by improvements in fabrication\ntechnology of memristors, specifically by lowering variations in their I-V\ncharacteristics.\n", "  For first passage percolation on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. bounded edge\nweights, we consider the upper tail large deviation event; i.e., the rare\nsituation where the first passage time between two points at distance $n$, is\nmacroscopically larger than typical. It was shown by Kesten (1986) that the\nprobability of this event decays as $\\exp (-\\Theta(n^2))$. However the question\nof existence of the rate function i.e., whether the log-probability normalized\nby $n^2$ tends to a limit, had remained open. We show that under some\nadditional mild regularity assumption on the passage time distribution, the\nrate function for upper tail large deviation indeed exists. Our proof can be\ngeneralized to work in higher dimensions and for the corresponding problem in\nlast passage percolation as well. The key intuition behind the proof is that a\nlimiting metric structure which is atypical causes the upper tail large\ndeviation event. The formal argument then relies on an approximate version of\nthe above which allows us to dilate the large deviation environment to compare\nthe upper tail probabilities for various values of $n.$\n", "  CaRuO_3 is perovskite with an orthorhombic distortion and is believed to be\nclose to magnetic ordering. Magnetic studies of single crystal and\npolycrystalline CaRu_{1-x}Cu_xO_3 (0\\le x \\le 15 at.%Cu) reveal that\nspin-glass-like transition develops for x\\le 7 at.%Cu and obtained value for\neffective magnetic moment p_{eff}=3.55 mu_B for x=5 at.% Cu, single crystal,\nindicates presence of Ru^{5+}. At higher Cu concentrations more complex\nmagnetic behaviors are observed. Electrical resistivity measured on\npolycrystalline samples shows metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) at 51 K for\nonly 2 at.% Cu. Charge compensation, which is assumed to be present upon\nCu^{2+/3+} substitution, induces appearance of Ru^{5+} and/or creation of\noxygen vacancies in crystal structure. Since the observed changes in physical\nproperties are completely attributable to the charge compensation, they cannot\nbe related to behaviors of pure compound where no such mechanism is present.\nThis study provides the criterion for \"good\" chemical probes for studying\nRu-based perovskites.\n", "  Dimensional analysis provides many simple and useful tools for various\nsituations in science. The objective of this paper is to investigate its\nrelations to functions, i.e., the dimensions for functions that yield physical\nquantities and those for the arguments of functions. In particular, it is shown\nthat there are three types of functions from a viewpoint of dimensional\nanalysis. Relationships between Planck's constant and dimensional analysis are\nalso considered.\n"]}
