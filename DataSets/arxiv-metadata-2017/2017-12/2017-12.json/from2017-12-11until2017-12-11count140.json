Assuming the peaks originate from atomic discreteness, this agrees with\nthe value of 1.16 G_0 per atom obtained in numerical calculations by Hasmy et\nal.\n", "  Suspended chains consisting of single noble metal and oxygen atoms have been\nformed. We provide evidence that oxygen can react with and be incorporated into\nmetallic one-dimensional atomic chains. Oxygen incorporation reinforces the\nlinear bonds in the chain, which facilitates the creation of longer atomic\nchains. The mechanical and electrical properties of these diatomic chains have\nbeen investigated by determining local vibration modes of the chain and by\nmeasuring the dependence of the average chain-conductance on the length of the\nchain. Additionally, we have performed calculations that give insight in the\nphysical mechanism of the oxygen-induced strengthening of the linear bonds and\nthe conductance of the metal-oxygen chains.\n", "  We present a quantitative analysis of the steady state electronic transport\nin a resistive switching device. The device is composed of a thin film of\nAg$_{2}$S (solid electrolyte) contacted by a Pt nano-contact acting as\nion-blocking electrode, and a large area Ag reference electrode. When applying\na bias voltage both ionic and electronic transport occurs, and depending on the\npolarity it causes an accumulation of ions around the nano-contact. At small\napplied voltages (pre-switching) we observed this as a strongly nonlinear\ncurrent-voltage curve, which have been modeled using the Hebb-Wagner treatment\nfor polarization of a mixed conductor. This model correctly describes the\ntransport of the electrons within the polarized solid electrolyte in the steady\nstate up until the resistance switching, covering the entire range of\nnon-stoichiometries, and including the supersaturation range just before the\ndeposition of elemental silver. In this way, it is a step towards a\nquantitative understanding of the processes that lead to resistance switching.\n", "  We have constructed a spherically symmetric structure model in a cosmological\nbackground filled with perfect fluid with non-vanishing pressure and studied\nits quasi-local characteristics. This is done by using the Lema\\^{i}tre\nsolution of the Einstein equations and suggesting an algorithm to integrate it\nnumerically. The result shows intriguing effects of the pressure inside the\nstructure. The evolution of the central black hole within the FRW universe, its\ndecoupling from the expanding parts of the model, the structure of its\nspace-like apparent horizon, the limiting case of the dynamical horizon tending\nto a slowly evolving horizon, and the decreasing mass in-fall to the black hole\nis also studied. The quasi-local features of this cosmological black hole may\nnot be inferred from the weak field approximation although the gravity outside\nthe structure is very weak.\n", "  The inter-connection between the elasticity of a dielectric film and the\nwetting of a sessile drop on the same, under an applied electrical voltage,\nremains unaddressed. Here, we report the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD)\nbehaviour of sessile drops on dielectric elastomer films of varying\nelasticities- from an apparently rigid dielectric film to a soft, deformable\ndielectric film. Our results reveal that the elasticity of the underlying\ndielectric film provides an additional control over the droplet electrowetting\nbehaviour, which may be best addressed from free energy based consideration,\nleading to a modification of the classical Lippman-Young paradigm. We also\nprovide an explanation on the displacement profiles for the deformation of the\nsoft dielectric surface, due to the interfacial electro-elastocapillary\ninteraction triggered by the electrowetted sessile droplet. These results can\nbe of profound importance in various emerging applications, ranging from the\ndevelopment of soft liquid lenses to drug delivery.\n", "  We study theoretically phonon-assisted relaxation and tunnelling in a system\ncomposed of a quantum dot which is coupled to a quantum well. Within the kp\nmethod combined with the L\\\"owdin elimination, we calculate the electron\nstates. We calculate acoustic phonon-assisted relaxation rates between the\nstates in the quantum well and in the quantum dot and study the resulting\nelectron kinetics. We show that transition efficiency crucially depends on the\nsystem geometry. We show also that under some conditions, transition efficiency\ncan decrease with the temperature.\n", "  One dimensional systems strongly enhance the quantum character of electron\ntransport. Such systems can be realized in 5d transition metals Au, Pt and Ir,\nin the form of suspended monatomic chains between bulk leads. Atomic chains\nbetween ferromagnetic leads would open up many perspectives in the context of\nspin-dependent transport and spintronics, but the evidence suggests that for\npure metals only the mentioned three 5d metals are susceptible to chain\nformation. It has been argued that the stability of atomic chains made up from\nferromagnetic metals is compromised by the same exchange interaction that\nproduces the local moments. Here we demonstrate that magnetic atomic chains can\nbe induced to form in break junctions under the influence of light molecules.\nExplicitly, we find deuterium assisted chain formation in the 3d ferromagnetic\ntransition metals Fe and Ni. Chain lengths up to eight atoms are formed upon\nstretching the ferromagnetic atomic contact in deuterium atmosphere at\ncryogenic temperatures. From differential conductance spectra vibronic states\nof D$_2$ can be identified, confirming the presence of deuterium in the atomic\nchains.\n", "  The patterns of fringes produced by an interferometer have long been\nimportant testbeds for our best contemporary theories of physics. Historically,\ninterference has been used to contrast quantum mechanics to classical physics,\nbut recently experiments have been performed that test quantum theory against\neven more exotic alternatives. A physically motivated family of theories are\nthose where the state space of a two-level system is given by a sphere of\narbitrary dimension. This includes classical bits, and real, complex and\nquaternionic quantum theory. In this paper, we consider relativity of\nsimultaneity (that observers may disagree about the order of events at\ndifferent locations) as applied to a two-armed interferometer, and show that\nthis forbids most interference phenomena more complicated than those of complex\nquantum theory. If interference must depend on some relational property of the\nsetting (such as path difference), then relativity of simultaneity will limit\nstate spaces to standard complex quantum theory, or a subspace thereof. If this\nrelational assumption is relaxed, we find one additional theory compatible with\nrelativity of simultaneity: quaternionic quantum theory. Our results have\nconsequences for current laboratory interference experiments: they have to be\ndesigned carefully to avoid rendering beyond-quantum effects invisible by\nrelativity of simultaneity.\n", "  The process of jet-gap-jet (JGJ) production is briefly described. The JGJ\nscattering amplitude parametrisation is discussed. On the basis of full\namplitude calculations, the parametrisation formulas for the leading\nlogarithmic (LL) and next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximations are\nobtained. For each case a sum over all conformal spins is considered. The\nobtained agreement is better than 0.25% for LL and 1% for NLL.\n", "  Concurrent remote entanglement of distant, non-interacting quantum entities\nis a crucial function for quantum information processing. In contrast with the\nexisting protocols which employ addition of signals to generate entanglement\nbetween two remote qubits, the protocol we present is based on multiplication\nof signals. This protocol can be straightforwardly implemented by a novel\nJosephson junction mixing circuit. Our scheme would be able to generate\nprovable entanglement even in presence of practical imperfections: finite\nquantum efficiency of detectors and undesired photon loss in current\nstate-of-the-art devices.\n", "  We study certain four-graviton amplitudes in exceptional field theory in\ndimensions $D\\geq 4$ up to two loops. As the formulation is manifestly\ninvariant under the U-duality group $E_{11-D}(\\mathbb{Z})$, our resulting\nexpressions can be expressed in terms of automorphic forms. In the low energy\nexpansion, we find terms in the M-theory effective action of type $R^4$,\n$\\nabla^4R^4$ and $\\nabla^6 R^4$ with automorphic coefficient functions in\nagreement with independent derivations from string theory. This provides in\nparticular an explicit integral formula for the exact string theory $\\nabla^6\nR^4$ threshold function. We exhibit moreover that the usual supergravity\nlogarithmic divergences cancel out in the full exceptional field theory\namplitude, within an appropriately defined dimensional regularisation scheme.\nWe also comment on terms of higher derivative order and the role of the section\nconstraint for possible counterterms.\n", "  A quantum field theory in its algebraic description may admit many irregular\nstates. So far, selection criteria to distinguish physically reasonable states\nhave been restricted to free fields (Hadamard condition) or to flat spacetimes\n(e.g. Buchholz-Wichmann nuclearity). We propose instead to use a modular\nl^p-condition, which is an extension of a strengthened modular nuclearity\ncondition to generally covariant theories.\n  The modular nuclearity condition was previously introduced in Minkowski\nspace, where it played an important role in constructive two dimensional\nalgebraic QFT's. We show that our generally covariant extension of this\ncondition makes sense for a vast range of theories, and that it behaves well\nunder causal propagation and taking mixtures. In addition we show that our\nmodular l^p-condition holds for every quasi-free Hadamard state of a free\nscalar quantum field (regardless of mass or scalar curvature coupling).\nHowever, our condition is not equivalent to the Hadamard condition.\n", "  The theory of the inflationary multiverse changes the way we think about our\nplace in the world. According to its most popular version, our world may\nconsist of infinitely many exponentially large parts, exhibiting different sets\nof low-energy laws of physics. Since these parts are extremely large, the\ninterior of each of them behaves as if it were a separate universe, practically\nunaffected by the rest of the world. This picture, combined with the theory of\neternal inflation and anthropic considerations, may help to solve many\ndifficult problems of modern physics, including the cosmological constant\nproblem. In this article I will briefly describe this theory and provide links\nto the some hard to find papers written during the first few years of the\ndevelopment of the inflationary multiverse scenario.\n", "  We consider self-gravitating fluids in cosmological spacetimes with Gowdy\nsymmetry on the torus $T^3$ and, in this class, we solve the singular initial\nvalue problem for the Einstein-Euler system of general relativity, when an\ninitial data set is prescribed on the hypersurface of singularity. We specify\ninitial conditions for the geometric and matter variables and identify the\nasymptotic behavior of these variables near the cosmological singularity. Our\nanalysis of this class of nonlinear and singular partial differential equations\nexhibits a condition on the sound speed, which leads us to the notion of\nsub-critical, critical, and super-critical regimes. Solutions to the\nEinstein-Euler systems when the fluid is governed by a linear equation of state\nare constructed in the first two regimes, while additional difficulties arise\nin the latter one. All previous studies on inhomogeneous spacetimes concerned\nvacuum cosmological spacetimes only.\n", "  We establish the existence of smooth vacuum Gowdy solutions, which are\nasymptotically velocity term dominated (AVTD) and have T3-spatial topology, in\nan infinite dimensional family of generalized wave gauges. These results show\nthat the AVTD property, which is known to hold for solutions in areal\ncoordinates, is stable to perturbations with respect to the gauge source\nfunctions. Our proof is based on an analysis of the singular initial value\nproblem for the Einstein vacuum equations in the generalized wave gauge\nformalism, and provides a framework which we anticipate to be useful for more\ngeneral spacetimes.\n", "  We find a class of minimal hypersurfaces H(k) as the zero level set of\nPfaffians, resp. determinants of real 2k+2 dimensional antisymmetric matrices.\nWhile H(1) and H(2) are congruent to a 6-dimensional quadratic cone resp.\nHsiang's cubic su(4) invariant in R15, H(k>2) (special harmonic\nso(2k+2)-invariant cones of degree>3) seem to be new.\n", "  We demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish two conductance switching\nmechanisms in silver sulfide devices at room temperature. Experiments were\nperformed using a Ag$_2$S thin film deposited on a wide Ag bottom electrode,\nwhich was contacted by the Pt tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. By\napplying a positive voltage on the silver electrode the conductance is seen to\nswitch to a state having three orders of magnitude higher conductance, which is\nrelated to the formation of a conductive path inside the Ag$_2$S thin film. We\nargue this to be composed of a metallic silver nanowire accompanied by a\nmodification of the surrounding lattice structure. Metallic silver nanowires\ndecaying after applying a negative voltage allow observing conductance steps in\nthe breaking traces characteristic for atomic-scale contacts, while the lattice\nstructure deformation is revealed by gradual and continuously decreasing\nconductance traces.\n", "  This short and opinionated review starts with a concept of quantum signals at\nmicrowave frequencies and focuses on the principle of linear parametric\namplification. The amplification process arises from the dispersive\nnonlinearity of Josephson junctions driven with appropriate tones. We discuss\ntwo defining characteristics of these amplifiers: the number of modes receiving\nthe signal, idler and pump waves and the number of independent ports through\nwhich these waves enter into the circuit.\n", "  For a massless free scalar field in a globally hyperbolic space-time we\ncompare the global temperature T, defined for the KMS states $\\omega^T$, with\nthe local temperature $T_{\\omega}(x)$ introduced by Buchholz and Schlemmer. We\nprove the following claims: (1) Whenever $T_{\\omega^T}(x)$ is defined, it is a\ncontinuous, monotonically increasing function of T at every point x. (2)\n$T_{\\omega}(x)$ is defined when the space-time is ultra-static with compact\nCauchy surface and non-trivial scalar curvature $R\\ge 0$, $\\omega$ is\nstationary and a few other assumptions are satisfied. Our proof of (2) relies\non the positive mass theorem. We discuss the necessity of its assumptions,\nproviding counter-examples in an ultra-static space-time with non-compact\nCauchy surface and R<0 somewhere. We interpret the result in terms of a\nviolation of the weak energy condition in the background space-time.\n", "  The determination of maximum possible amplitude of a coherent longitudinal\nplasma oscillation/wave is a topic of fundamental importance in non-linear\nplasma physics. The amplitudes of these large amplitude plasma waves is limited\nby a phenomena called wave breaking which may be induced by several non-linear\nprocesses. It was shown by Coffey [T. P. Coffey, Phys. Fluids 14, 1402 (1971)]\nusing a \"water-bag\" distribution for electrons that, in a warm plasma the\nmaximum electric field amplitude and density amplitude implicitly depend on the\nelectron temperature, known as Coffey's limit. In this paper, the breaking of\nlarge amplitude freely running electron plasma wave in a homogeneous warm\nplasma where electron's velocity distribution is Maxwellian has been studied\nnumerically using 1D Particle in Cell (PIC) simulation method. It is found that\nCoffey's propagating wave solutions, which was derived using a \"water-bag\"\ndistribution for electrons, also represent propagating waves in a Maxwellian\nplasma. Coffey's wave breaking limit is also verified by loading Maxwellian\nvelocity distributions of different initial temperatures. A clear\ncorrespondence between wave breaking and particle trapping is presented. Our\nsimulation results are also compared with the experimental results of B. S.\nBauer, A. Y. Wong, V. K. Decyk and G. Resenthal [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, 3706\n(1992)].\n", "  Remote entanglement of distant, non-interacting quantum entities is a key\nprimitive for quantum information processing. We present a new protocol to\nremotely entangle two stationary qubits by first entangling them with\npropagating ancilla qubits and then performing a joint two-qubit measurement on\nthe ancillas. Subsequently, single-qubit measurements are performed on each of\nthe ancillas. We describe two continuous variable implementations of the\nprotocol using propagating microwave modes. The first implementation uses\npropagating Schr$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$dinger cat-states as the flying ancilla qubits,\na joint-photon-number-modulo-2 measurement of the propagating modes for the\ntwo-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final single-qubit\nmeasurements. The presence of inefficiencies in realistic quantum systems limit\nthe success-rate of generating high fidelity Bell-states. This motivates us to\npropose a second continuous variable implementation, where we use quantum error\ncorrection to suppress the decoherence due to photon loss to first order. To\nthat end, we encode the ancilla qubits in superpositions of Schr\\\"odinger cat\nstates of a given photon-number-parity, use a joint-photon-number-modulo-4\nmeasurement as the two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final\nsingle-qubit measurements. We demonstrate the resilience of our\nquantum-error-correcting remote entanglement scheme to imperfections. Further,\nwe describe a modification of our error-correcting scheme by incorporating\nadditional individual photon-number-modulo-2 measurements of the ancilla modes\nto improve the success-rate of generating high-fidelity Bell-states. Our\nprotocols can be straightforwardly implemented in state-of-the-art\nsuperconducting circuit-QED systems.\n", "  The directed bond percolation process is studied in the presence of com-\npressible velocity fluctuations with long-range correlations. We discuss a\nconstruction of a field theoretic action and a way of obtaining its large scale\nproperties using the perturbative renormalization group. The most interest- ing\nresults for the frozen velocity limit are given.\n", "  With any roughness at the interface of an indirect-bandgap semiconducting\ndot, the phase of the valley-orbit coupling can take on a random value. This\nrandom value, in double quantum dots, causes a large change in the exchange\nsplitting. We demonstrate a simple analytical method to calculate the phase,\nand thus the exchange splitting and singlet-triplet qubit frequency, for an\narbitrary interface. We then show that, with lateral control of the position of\na quantum dot using a gate voltage, the valley-orbit phase can be controlled\nover a wide range, so that variations in the exchange splitting can be\ncontrolled for individual devices. Finally, we suggest experiments to measure\nthe valley phase and the concomitant gate voltage control.\n", "  Crater II is an unusual object among the dwarf satellite galaxies of the\nLocal Group in that it has a very large size for its small luminosity. This\nprovides a strong test of MOND, as Crater II should be in the deep MOND regime\n($g_{in} \\approx 34\\;\\mathrm{km}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kpc}^{-1} \\ll a_0\n= 3700\\;\\mathrm{km}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$). Despite its great\ndistance ($\\approx 120$ kpc) from the Milky Way, the external field of the host\n($g_{ex} \\approx 282\\; \\mathrm{km}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$)\ncomfortably exceeds the internal field. Consequently, Crater II should be\nsubject to the external field effect, a feature unique to MOND. This leads to\nthe prediction of a very low velocity dispersion: $\\sigma_{efe} =\n2.1^{+0.9}_{-0.6}\\;\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n", "  Many fluctuation-driven phenomena in fluids can be analysed effectively using\nthe generalised Lagrangian mean (GLM) theory of Andrews & McIntyre (1978). This\ntheory relies on particle-following averaging to incorporate the constraints\nimposed by the material conservations. It relies implicitly on an Euclidean\nstructure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic\ninterpretation and suffers from undesirable features, including the divergence\nof the Lagrangian-mean velocity for incompressible fluids. Motivated by this,\nwe develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that we formulate intrinsically.\nThe theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; it also establishes a\nclear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency\nand those that depend on particular choices. We show that the Lagrangian mean\nmomentum -- the average of the pull-back of the momentum one-form -- obeys a\nsimple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's circulation,\nirrespective of the mean-flow definition. We discuss four possible definitions\nof the mean flow: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on\noptimal transportation, a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group\nof volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and the glm definition proposed by Soward\n& Roberts (2010). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations, we carry out\norder-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean flow\nand pseudomomentum at leading order. We also show how the wave-action\nconservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting. To make the paper\nself-contained, we introduce the tools of differential geometry and main ideas\nof geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely. We mostly focus on the Euler\nequations for incompressible inviscid fluids but sketch out extensions to the\nrotating-stratified Boussinesq, compressible Euler and magnetohydrodynamic\nequations.\n", "  We present a framework for the solution of Boltzmann's equation in the swarm\nlimit for arbitrary mass ratio, allowing for solutions of electron or ion\ntransport. An arbitrary basis set can be used in the framework, which is\nachieved by using appropriate quadratures to obtain the required matrix\nelements. We demonstrate an implementation using Burnett functions and\nbenchmark the calculations using Monte-Carlo simulations. Even though the\nconvergence in transport quantities is always good, the particle distributions\ndid not always converge, highlighting that simple benchmarks can give\nmisleading confidence in a choice of basis. We postulate a different basis,\nwhich avoids a spherical harmonic expansion, which is better suited to strong\nelectric fields or sharp features such as low-energy attachment processes.\n", "  The superconducting phase in iron based high Tc superconductors (FeSC) as in\nother unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates neighbours a\nmagnetically ordered one in the phase diagram. This proximity hints at the\nimportance of electron correlation effects in these materials, and Hund\nexchange interaction has been suggested to be the dominant correlation effect\nin FeSCs because of their multiband nature. By this reasoning, correlation\nshould be strongest for materials closest to a half filled 3d shell (Mn\ncompounds, hole doped FeSCs) and decrease for systems with both higher\n(electron doped FeSCs) and lower (Cr pnictides) 3d counts. Here we address the\nstrength of correlation effects in BaCr2As2 by means of angle resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and first principles calculations. This\ncombination provides us with two handles on the strength of correlation, First,\na comparison of the experimental and calculated effective masses yields the\ncorrelation induced mass renormalisation. In addition, the lifetime broadening\nof the experimentally observed dispersions provides another measure of the\ncorrelation strength. Both approaches reveal a reduction of electron\ncorrelation in BaCr2As2 with respect to systems with a 3d count closer to five.\nOur results thereby support the theoretical predictions that Hund's exchange\ninteraction is important in these materials.\n", "  The fundamental principles underlying the arrangement of elements into solid\ncompounds with an enormous variety of crystal structures are still largely\nunknown. This study presents a general overview of the structure types\nappearing in an important subset of the solid compounds, i.e., binary and\nternary compounds of the 6A column oxides, sulfides and selenides. It contains\nan analysis of these compounds, including the prevalence of various structure\ntypes, their symmetry properties, compositions, stoichiometries and unit cell\nsizes. It is found that these compound families include preferred\nstoichiometries and structure types that may reflect both their specific\nchemistry and research bias in the available empirical data. Identification of\nnon-overlapping gaps and missing stoichiometries in these structure populations\nmay be used as guidance in the search for new materials.\n", "  We give a detailed account of the so-called \"universal construction\" that\naims to extend invariants of closed manifolds, possibly with additional\nstructure, to topological field theories and show that it amounts to a\ngeneralization of the GNS construction. We apply this construction to an\ninvariant defined in terms of the groupoid cardinality of groupoids of bundles\nto recover Dijkgraaf-Witten theories, including the vector spaces obtained as a\nlinearization of spaces of principal bundles.\n", "  Two electrons in a quantum dot repel each other: their interaction can be\ncharacterized by a positive interaction energy. From the theory of\nsuperconductivity, we also know that mechanical vibrations of the crystal\nlattice can make the electron-electron interaction attractive. Analogously, if\na quantum dot interacts with a mechanical degree of freedom, the effective\ninteraction energy can be negative; that is, the electron-electron interaction\nmight be attractive. In this work, we propose and theoretically study an\nengineered electromechanical system that exhibits electron-electron attraction:\na quantum dot suspended on a nonlinear mechanical resonator, tuned by a bottom\nand a top gate electrode. We focus on the example of a dot embedded in a\nsuspended graphene ribbon, for which we identify conditions for\nelectron-electron attraction. Our results suggest the possibility of electronic\ntransport via tunneling of packets of multiple electrons in such devices,\nsimilar to that in superconducting nanostructures, but without the use of any\nsuperconducting elements.\n", "  We demonstrate that small quantum memories, realized via quantum error\ncorrection in multi-qubit devices, can benefit substantially by choosing a\nquantum code that is tailored to the relevant error model of the system. For a\nbiased noise model, with independent bit and phase flips occurring at different\nrates, we show that a single code greatly outperforms the well-studied Steane\ncode across the full range of parameters of the noise model, including for\nunbiased noise. In fact, this tailored code performs almost optimally when\ncompared with 10,000 randomly selected stabilizer codes of comparable\nexperimental complexity. Tailored codes can even outperform the Steane code\nwith realistic experimental noise, and without any increase in the experimental\ncomplexity, as we demonstrate by comparison in the observed error model in a\nrecent 7-qubit trapped ion experiment.\n", "  The light unflavoured meson $\\eta/\\eta^{\\prime}$ decays are valuable for\ntesting non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics and exploring new physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. This paper describes a series of event generators,\nincluding $\\eta/\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\gamma l^{+}l^{-}$,\n$\\eta/\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\gamma \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$, $\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\omega\ne^{+}e^{-}$, $\\eta\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}$,\n$\\eta/\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$, $\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\eta\\pi\\pi$ and\n$\\eta^{\\prime}\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}/\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$,\nwhich have been developed for investigating $\\eta/\\eta^\\prime$ decay dynamics.\nFor most of these generators, their usability has been validated in BESIII\nanalyses for determining the detection efficiency, and background studies. The\nconsistency between data and Monte Carlo shows that these generators work well\nin the BESIII simulation, and will also be useful for ongoing BESIII analyses\nand other experiments for studying $\\eta/\\eta^\\prime$ physics.\n", "  We present the calculation of the next-to-leading order QCD corrections for\ntop-quark pair production in association with an additional jet at hadron\ncolliders, using the modified minimal subtraction scheme to renormalize the\ntop-quark mass. The results are compared to measurements at the Large Hadron\nCollider run I. In particular, we determine the top-quark running mass from a\nfit of the theoretical results presented here to the LHC data.\n", "  Two major recent developments in theory and computational resources created\nthe favorable conditions for achieving a microscopic description of nuclear\nfission almost eighty years after its discovery in 1939 by Hahn and Strassmann\n(1930). The first major development was in theory, the extension of the\nTime-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) to superfluid fermion systems.\nThe second development was in computing, the emergence of powerful enough\nsupercomputers capable of solving the complex systems of equations describing\nthe time evolution in three dimensions without any restrictions of hundreds of\nstrongly interacting nucleons. Even though the available nuclear energy density\nfunctionals (NEDFs) are phenomenological still, their accuracy is improving\nsteadily and the prospects of being able to perform calculations of the nuclear\nfission dynamics and to predict many properties of the fission fragments,\notherwise not possible to extract from experiments, are within reach, all\nwithout making recourse anymore to uncontrollable assumptions and simplified\nphenomenological models.\n", "  Frustration in magnetic interactions can give rise to disordered ground\nstates with subtle and beautiful properties. The spin ices Ho2Ti2O7 and\nDy2Ti2O7 exemplify this phenomenon, displaying a classical spin liquid state,\nwith fractionalized magnetic--monopole excitations. Recently there has been\ngreat interest in closely-related \"quantum spin ice\" materials, following the\nrealization that anisotropic exchange interactions could convert spin ice into\na massively-entangled, quantum, spin liquid, where magnetic monopoles become\nthe charges of an emergent quantum electrodynamics. Here we show that even the\nsimplest model of a quantum spin ice, the XXZ model on the pyrochlore lattice,\ncan realise a still-richer scenario. Using a combination of classical Monte\nCarlo simulation, semi--classical molecular--dynamics simulation, and analytic\nfield theory, we explore the properties of this model for frustrated transverse\nexchange. We find not one, but three, competing forms of spin liquid, as well\nas a phase with hidden, spin-nematic, order. We explore the experimental\nsignatures of each of these different states, making explicit predictions for\ninelastic neutron scattering. These results show an intriguing similarity to\nexperiments on a range of pyrochlore oxides.\n", "  In many quantum computer architectures, the qubits are in close proximity to\nmetallic device elements. The fluctuating currents in the metal give rise to\nnoisy electromagnetic fields that leak out into the surrounding region. These\nfields are known as evanescent-wave Johnson noise. The noise can decohere the\nqubits. We present the general theory of this effect for charge qubits subject\nto electric noise and for spin and magnetic qubits subject to magnetic noise. A\nmapping of the quantum-mechanical problem onto a problem in classical\nelectrodynamics simplifies the calculations. The focus is on relatively simple\ngeometries in which analytical calculations can be done. New results are\npresented for the local noise spectral density in the vicinity of cylindrical\nconductors such as small antennae, noise from objects that can be treated as\ndipoles, and noise correlation functions for several geometries. We summarize\nthe current state of the comparison of theory with experimental results on\ndecoherence times of qubits. Emphasis is placed on qualitative understanding of\nthe basic concepts and phenomena.\n", "  We consider a complex singlet scalar in the spectral action approach to the\nstandard model. It is shown that there is a range of initial values at the\nunification scale which is able to produce Higgs and top quark masses at low\nenergies. The stability of the vacuum and the deviation of gauge couplings from\nexperimental values are discussed and compared at the two-loop level with a\nreal scalar singlet and the pure standard model.\n", "  We report a study of the charmless hadronic decay of the charged $B$ meson to\nthe three-body final state $K^+ K^- \\pi^+$. The results are based on a data\nsample that contains $772\\times10^6$ $B \\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+ e^-$ collider. The measured inclusive branching fraction and the direct\n$CP$ asymmetry are $(5.38\\pm0.40\\pm0.35)\\times 10^{-6}$ and\n$-0.170\\pm0.073\\pm0.017$, respectively, where the first uncertainties are\nstatistical and the second are systematic. The $K^{+}K^{-}$ invariant mass\ndistribution of the signal candidates shows an excess in the region below $1.5$\nGeV/$c^2$, which is consistent with the previous studies from BaBar and LHCb.\nIn addition, strong evidence of a large direct $CP$ asymmetry is found in the\n$K^{+}K^{-}$ low-invariant-mass region.\n", "  Scanning tunneling microscopes (STM) are used extensively for studying and\nmanipulating matter at the atomic scale. In spite of the critical role of the\nSTM tip, the control of the atomic-scale shape of STM tips remains a poorly\nsolved problem. Here, we present a method for preparing tips {\\it in-situ} and\nfor ensuring the crystalline structure and reproducibly preparing tip structure\nup to the second atomic layer. We demonstrate a controlled evolution of such\ntips starting from undefined tip shapes.\n", "  For the first time, spectral signs of subtle coma activity were observed\nsimultaneously on four main-belt primitive asteroids (145) Adeona, (704)\nInteramnia, (779) Nina, and (1474) Beira around their perihelion distances in\nSeptember 2012, which were interpreted as manifestations of the sublimation of\nH2O ice in/under the surface matter (Busarev et al., 2015a, 2015b). We confirm\nthe phenomenon for Nina when it approached perihelion in September 2016. At the\nsame time, based on results of spectral observations of near-Earth asteroid\n(162173) Ryugu (Vilas, 2008) being a target of Japan's Hayabusa 2 space\nmission, we suspected a periodic similar transient activity on the Cg-type\nasteroid. However, unlike the main-belt primitive asteroids demonstrating\nsublimation of ices close to their perihelion distances, the effect on Ryugu\nwas apparently registered near aphelion. To explain the difference, we\ncalculated the subsolar temperature depending on heliocentric distance of the\nasteroids, considered qualitative models of internal structure of main-belt and\nnear-Earth primitive asteroids including ice and performed some analytical\nestimations. Presumed temporal sublimation/degassing activity of Ryugu points\nto the existence of a residual frozen core in its interior. It could be an\nindication of a relatively recent transition of the asteroid from the main\nasteroid belt to the near-Earth area.\n", "  A statistical combination of searches is presented for massive resonances\ndecaying to WW, WZ, ZZ, WH, and ZH boson pairs in proton-proton collision data\ncollected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The data are taken at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to respective integrated\nluminosities of 19.7 and up to 2.7 inverse femtobarns. The results are\ninterpreted in the context of heavy vector triplet and singlet models that\nmimic properties of composite-Higgs models predicting W' and Z' bosons decaying\nto WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons. A model with a bulk graviton that decays into WW\nand ZZ is also considered. This is the first combined search for WW, WZ, WH,\nand ZH resonances and yields lower limits on masses at 95% confidence level for\nW' and Z' singlets at 2.3 TeV, and for a triplet at 2.4 TeV. The limits on the\nproduction cross section of a narrow bulk graviton resonance with the curvature\nscale of the warped extra dimension k = 0.5, in the mass range of 0.6 to 4.0\nTeV, are the most stringent published to date.\n", "  We present predictions for the prompt-neutrino flux arising from the decay of\ncharmed mesons and baryons produced by the interactions of high-energy cosmic\nrays in the Earth's atmosphere, making use of a QCD approach on the basis of\nthe general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme for the description of charm\nhadroproduction at NLO, complemented by a consistent set of fragmentation\nfunctions. We compare the theoretical results to those already obtained by our\nand other groups with different theoretical approaches. We provide comparisons\nwith the experimental results obtained by the IceCube Collaboration in two\ndifferent analyses and we discuss the implications for parton distribution\nfunctions.\n", "  Shot noise measurements on atomic and molecular junctions provide rich\ninformation about the quantum transport properties of the junctions and on the\ninelastic scattering events taking place in the process. Dissipation at the\nnanoscale, a problem of central interest in nano-electronics, can be studied in\nits most explicit and simplified form. Here, we describe a measurement\ntechnique that permits extending previous noise measurements to a much higher\nfrequency range, and to much higher bias voltage range, while maintaining a\nhigh accuracy in noise and conductance. We also demonstrate the advantages of\nhaving access to the spectral information for diagnostics.\n", "  We examine the momentum and angular-momentum (AM) properties of monochromatic\noptical fields in dispersive and inhomogeneous isotropic media, using the\nAbraham- and Minkowski-type approaches, as well as the kinetic (Poynting-like)\nand canonical (with separate spin and orbital degrees of freedom) pictures.\nWhile the kinetic Abraham-Poynting momentum describes the energy flux and the\ngroup velocity of the wave, the Minkowski-type quantities, with proper\ndispersion corrections, describe the actual momentum and angular momentum\ncarried by the wave. The kinetic Minkowski-type momentum and AM densities agree\nwith phenomenological results derived by Philbin. Using the canonical\nspin-orbital decomposition, previously used for free-space fields, we find the\ncorresponding canonical momentum, spin and orbital AM of light in a dispersive\ninhomogeneous medium. These acquire a very natural form analogous to the\nBrillouin energy density and are valid for arbitrary structured fields. The\ngeneral theory is applied to a non-trivial example of a surface\nplasmon-polariton (SPP) wave at a metal-vacuum interface. We show that the\nintegral momentum of the SPP per particle corresponds to the SPP wave vector,\nand hence exceeds the momentum of a photon in the vacuum. We also provide the\nfirst accurate calculation of the transverse spin and orbital AM of the SPP.\nWhile the intrinsic orbital AM vanishes, the transverse spin can change its\nsign depending on the SPP frequency. Importantly, we present both macroscopic\nand microscopic calculations, thereby proving the validity of the general\nphenomenological results. The microscopic theory also predicts a transverse\nmagnetization in the metal (i.e., a magnetic moment for the SPP) as well as the\ncorresponding direct magnetization current, which explains the difference\nbetween the Abraham and Minkowski momenta.\n", "  An initially knotted light field will stay knotted if it satisfies a set of\nnonlinear, geometric constraints, i.e. the null conditions, for all space-time.\nHowever, the question of when an initially null light field stays null has\nremained challenging to answer. By establishing a mapping between Maxwell's\nequations and transport along the flow of a pressureless Euler fluid, we show\nthat an initially analytic null light field stays null if and only if the flow\nof the initial Poynting field is shear-free, giving a design rule for the\nconstruction of persistently knotted light fields. Furthermore we outline\nmethods for constructing initially knotted null light fields, and initially\nnull, shear-free light fields, and give sufficient conditions for the magnetic\n(or electric) field lines of a null light field to lie tangent to surfaces. Our\nresults pave the way for the design of persistently knotted light fields and\nthe study of their field line structure.\n", "  We find an unusual anisotropy of the inplane field magnetoresistance in\nultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells. The anisotropy depends on the\norientation between the inplane field, $B_\\parallel$, and current, $I$,\nrelative to the crystallographic axes of the sample and is a consequence of the\nintrinsic ridges on the quantum well surface. For the simplest orientations\nbetween current and crystallographic axes, a method of recalculating the\nmagnetoresistance measured at $I\\perp B_\\parallel$ into the one measured at\n$I\\parallel B_\\parallel$ is suggested and is shown to yield results that agree\nwith the experiment.\n", "  In this article, we distinguish the contributions of the positive parity and\nnegative parity $\\Omega_c$ states, study the masses and pole residues of the\n1S, 1P, 2S and 2P $\\Omega_c$ states with the spin $J=\\frac{1}{2}$ and\n$\\frac{3}{2}$ using the QCD sum rules in a consistent way, and revisit the\nassignments of the new narrow excited $\\Omega_c^0$ states. The predictions\nsupport assigning the $\\Omega_c(3000)$ to be the 1P $\\Omega_c$ state with\n$J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^-$, assigning the $\\Omega_c(3090)$ to be the 1P $\\Omega_c$\nstate with $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^-$ or the 2S $\\Omega_c$ state with\n$J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^+$, and assigning $\\Omega_c(3119)$ to be the 2S $\\Omega_c$\nstate with $J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^+$.\n", "  We consider an extension of the Standard Model with the global symmetry\nbreaking pattern SO(5)/SO(4), where the Higgs boson arises as a\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson. The scalar content of the theory consists of a\nStandard-Model-like Higgs field and an extra real scalar field. The flavour\nsector of the model is extended by two right-handed neutrinos compatible with\nthe observed light-neutrino phenomenology, and we find that the correct vacuum\nalignment determines the mass of the heavier neutrino eigenstate to be around\n80 TeV. The new singlet-scalar state generates dynamically a Majorana mass term\nfor the heavy neutrino states. We show how the model leads to the correct\nbaryon asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis in the case of two degenerate\nor hierarchical heavy neutrinos.\n", "  We study fermionic matrix product operator algebras and identify the\nassociated algebraic data. Using this algebraic data we construct fermionic\ntensor network states in two dimensions that have non-trivial\nsymmetry-protected or intrinsic topological order. The tensor network states\nallow us to relate physical properties of the topological phases to the\nunderlying algebraic data. We illustrate this by calculating defect properties\nand modular matrices of supercohomology phases. Our formalism also captures\nMajorana defects as we show explicitly for a class of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry-protected and intrinsic topological phases. The tensor networks states\npresented here are well-suited for numerical applications and hence open up new\npossibilities for studying interacting fermionic topological phases.\n", "  We present a method to certify the presence of Bell correlations in\nexperimentally observed statistics, and to obtain new Bell inequalities. Our\napproach is based on relaxing the conditions defining the set of correlations\nobeying a local hidden variable model, yielding a convergent hierarchy of\nsemidefinite programs (SdP's). Because the size of these SdP's is independent\nof the number of parties involved, this technique allows to characterize\ncorrelations in many-body systems. As an example, we illustrate our method with\nthe experimental data presented in [Science 352, 441 (2016)]\n", "  We prove uniqueness of the near-horizon geometries arising from degenerate\nKerr black holes within the collection of nearby vacuum near-horizon\ngeometries.\n", "  The quantum master equation is an important tool in the study of quantum open\nsystems. It is often derived under a set of approximations, chief among them\nthe Born (factorization) and Markov (neglect of memory effects) approximations.\nIn this article we study the paradigmatic model of quantum Brownian motion of\nan harmonic oscillator coupled to a bath of oscillators with a Drude-Ohmic\nspectral density. We obtain analytically the \\emph{exact} solution of the\nHeisenberg-Langevin equations, with which we study correlation functions in the\nasymptotic stationary state. We compare the \\emph{exact} correlation functions\nto those obtained in the asymptotic long time limit with the quantum master\nequation in the Born approximation \\emph{with and without} the Markov\napproximation. In the latter case we implement a systematic derivative\nexpansion that yields the \\emph{exact} asymptotic limit under the factorization\napproximation \\emph{only}. We find discrepancies that could be significant when\nthe bandwidth of the bath $\\Lambda$ is much larger than the typical scales of\nthe system. We study the \\emph{exact} interaction energy as a \\emph{proxy} for\nthe correlations missed by the Born approximation and find that its dependence\non $\\Lambda$ is similar to the \\emph{discrepancy} between the exact solution\nand that of the quantum master equation in the Born approximation. We quantify\nthe regime of validity of the quantum master equation in the Born approximation\nwith or without the Markov approximation in terms of the system's relaxation\nrate $\\gamma$, its \\emph{unrenormalized} natural frequency $\\Omega$ and\n$\\Lambda$: $\\gamma/\\Omega \\ll 1$ and \\emph{also} $\\gamma \\Lambda/\\Omega^2 \\ll\n1$. The reliability of the Born approximation is discussed within the context\nof recent experimental settings and more general environments.\n", "  We consider partition functions with insertions of surface operators of\ntopologically twisted N=2, SU(2) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, or\nDonaldson-Witten theory for short, on a four-manifold. If the metric of the\ncompact four-manifold has positive scalar curvature, Moore and Witten have\nshown that the partition function is completely determined by the integral over\nthe Coulomb branch parameter $a$, while more generally the Coulomb branch\nintegral captures the wall-crossing behavior of both Donaldson polynomials and\nSeiberg-Witten invariants. We show that after addition of a Q-exact surface\noperator to the Moore-Witten integrand, the integrand can be written as a total\nderivative to the anti-holomorphic coordinate $\\bar a$ using Zwegers'\nindefinite theta functions. In this way, we reproduce G\\\"ottsche's expressions\nfor Donaldson invariants of rational surfaces in terms of indefinite theta\nfunctions for any choice of metric.\n", "  We present a variational method for approximating the ground state of spin\nmodels close to (Richardson-Gaudin) integrability. This is done by\nvariationally optimizing eigenstates of integrable Richardson-Gaudin models,\nwhere the toolbox of integrability allows for an efficient evaluation and\nminimization of the energy functional. The method is shown to return exact\nresults for integrable models and improve substantially on perturbation theory\nfor models close to integrability. For large integrability-breaking\ninteractions, it is shown how (avoided) level crossings necessitate the use of\nexcited states of integrable Hamiltonians in order to accurately describe the\nground states of general non-integrable models.\n", "  The interaction between electrons and the vibrational degrees of freedom of a\nmolecular quantum dot can lead to an exponential suppression of the\nconductance, an effect which is commonly termed Franck-Condon blockade. Here,\nwe investigate this effect in a quantum dot driven by time-periodic gate\nvoltages and tunneling amplitudes using nonequilibrium Green's functions and a\nFloquet expansion. Building on previous results showing that driving can lift\nthe Franck-Condon blockade, we investigate driving protocols which can be used\nto pump charge across the quantum dot. In particular, we show that due to the\nstrongly coupled nature of the system, the pump current at resonance is an\nexponential function of the drive strength.\n", "  Tens of early type galaxies have been recently reported to possess prolate\nrotation, i.e. significant amount of rotation around the major axis, including\ntwo cases in the Local Group. Although expected theoretically, this phenomenon\nis rarely observed and remains elusive. In order to explore its origin we study\nthe population of well-resolved galaxies in the Illustris cosmological\nsimulation. We identify 59 convincing examples of prolate rotators at the\npresent time, more frequently among more massive galaxies, with the number\nvarying very little with redshift. We follow their evolution back in time using\nthe main progenitor branch galaxies of the Illustris merger trees. We find that\nthe emergence of prolate rotation is strongly correlated with the time of the\nlast significant merger the galaxy experienced, although other evolutionary\npaths leading to prolate rotation are also possible. The transition to prolate\nrotation most often happens around the same time as the transition to prolate\nshape of the stellar component. The mergers leading to prolate rotation have\nslightly more radial orbits, higher mass ratios, and occur at more recent times\nthan mergers in the reference sample of twin galaxies we construct for\ncomparison. However, they cover a wide range of initial conditions in terms of\nthe mass ratio, merger time, radiality of the progenitor orbits, and the\nrelative orientations of spins of the progenitors with respect to the orbital\nangular momenta. About half of our sample of prolate rotators were created\nduring gas-rich mergers and the newly formed stars usually support prolate\nrotation.\n", "  Quantization of closed string proceeds with a suitable choice of worldsheet\nvacuum. A priori, the vacuum may be chosen independently for left-moving and\nright-moving sectors. We construct {\\sl ab initio} quantized bosonic string\ntheory with left-right asymmetric worldsheet vacuum and explore its\nconsequences and implications. We critically examine the validity of new vacuum\nand carry out first-quantization using standard operator formalism. Remarkably,\nthe string spectrum consists only of a finite number of degrees of freedom:\nstring gravity (massless spin-two, Kalb-Ramond and dilaton fields) and two\nmassive spin-two Fierz-Pauli fields. The massive spin-two fields have negative\nnorm, opposite mass-squared, and provides a Lee-Wick type extension of string\ngravity. We compute two physical observables: tree-level scattering amplitudes\nand one-loop cosmological constant. Scattering amplitude of four dilatons is\nshown to be a rational function of kinematic invariants, and in $D=26$\nfactorizes into contributions of massless spin-two and a pair of massive\nspin-two fields. The string one loop partition function is shown to perfectly\nagree with one loop Feynman diagram of string gravity and two massive spin-two\nfields. In particular, it does not exhibit modular invariance. We critically\ncompare our construction with recent studies and contrast differences.\n", "  The rare $\\tau^- \\to \\eta^{(\\prime)} \\pi^- \\nu_\\tau$ decays, which are\nsuppressed by $G$-parity in the Standard Model (SM), can be sensitive to the\neffects of new interactions. We study the sensitivity of different observables\nof these decays in the framework of an effective field theory that includes the\nmost general interactions between SM fields up to dimension six, assuming\nmassless neutrinos. Owing to the strong suppression of the SM isospin breaking\namplitudes, we find that the different observables would allow to set\nconstraints on scalar interactions that are stronger than those coming from\nother low-energy observables.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a scattering configuration in Compton\nscattering, in which the orientation of the electron spin is reversed and\nsimultaneously, the photon polarization changes from linear polarization into\ncircular polarization. The intrinsic angular momentum of electron and photon\nare computed along the coincident propagation direction of the incoming and\noutgoing photon. We find that this intrinsic angular momentum is not conserved\nin the considered scattering process. We also discuss the generation of\nentanglement for the considered scattering setup and present an angle dependent\ninvestigation of the corresponding differential cross section, Stokes\nparameters and spin expectation.\n", "  Bose-Einstein correlations of same-sign charged pions, produced in\nproton-proton collisions at a 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy, are studied using a\ndata sample collected by the LHCb experiment. The signature for Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations is observed in the form of an enhancement of pairs of like-sign\ncharged pions with small four-momentum difference squared. The charged-particle\nmultiplicity dependence of the Bose-Einstein correlation parameters describing\nthe correlation strength and the size of the emitting source is investigated,\ndetermining both the correlation radius and the chaoticity parameter. The\nmeasured correlation radius is found to increase as a function of increasing\ncharged-particle multiplicity, while the chaoticity parameter is seen to\ndecrease.\n", "  Recent theoretical work has established the presence of hidden spin and\norbital textures in non-magnetic materials with inversion symmetry. Here, we\npropose that these textures can be detected by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements carried out in the presence of an electric field. In crystals with\nhidden polarizations, a uniform electric field produces a staggered magnetic\nfield that points to opposite directions at atomic sites related by spatial\ninversion. As a result, the NMR resonance peak corresponding to inversion\npartner nuclei is split into two peaks. The magnitude of the splitting is\nproportional to the electric field and depends on the orientation of the\nelectric field with respect to the crystallographic axes and the external\nmagnetic field. As a case study, we present a theory of electric-field-induced\nsplitting of NMR peaks for $^{77}$Se, $^{125}$Te and $^{209}$Bi in Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nand Bi$_2$Te$_3$. In conducting samples with current densities of $\\simeq\n10^6\\, {\\rm A/cm}^2$, the splitting for Bi can reach $100\\, {\\rm kHz}$, which\nis comparable to or larger than the intrinsic width of the NMR lines. In order\nto observe the effect experimentally, the peak splitting must also exceed the\nlinewidth produced by the Oersted field. In Bi$_2$Se$_3$, this requires narrow\nwires of radius $\\lesssim 1\\, \\mu{\\rm m}$. We also discuss other potentially\nmore promising candidate materials, such as SrRuO$_3$ and BaIr$_2$Ge$_2$, whose\ncrystal symmetry enables strategies to suppress the linewidth produced by the\nOersted field.\n", "  The photovoltaic properties of (0001) n-InGaN/p-GaN single heterojunctions\nwere investigated numerically and compared with those of conventional\np-GaN/i-InGaN/n-GaN structures, employing realistic material parameters. This\nalternative device architecture exploits the large polarization fields, and\nhigh efficiency modules are achieved for In-rich, partially relaxed and\ncoherently strained InGaN films. Conversion efficiencies up to 14% under AM1.5G\nillumination can be reached, revealing the true potential of InGaN single\njunction solar cells with proper design.\n", "  We study disorder effects upon the temperature behavior of the upper critical\nmagnetic field in attractive Hubbard model within the generalized $DMFT+\\Sigma$\napproach. We consider the wide range of attraction potentials $U$ - from the\nweak coupling limit, where superconductivity is described by BCS model, up to\nthe strong coupling limit, where superconducting transition is related to Bose\n- Einstein condensation (BEC) of compact Cooper pairs, formed at temperatures\nsignificantly higher than superconducting transition temperature, as well as\nthe wide range of disorder - from weak to strong, when the system is in the\nvicinity of Anderson transition. The growth of coupling strength leads to the\nrapid growth of $H_{c2}(T)$, especially at low temperatures. In BEC limit and\nin the region of BCS - BEC crossover $H_{c2}(T)$ dependence becomes practically\nlinear. Disordering also leads to the general growth of $H_{c2}(T)$. In BCS\nlimit of weak coupling increasing disorder lead both to the growth of the slope\nof the upper critical field in the vicinity of transition point and to the\nincrease of $H_{c2}(T)$ in low temperature region. In the limit of strong\ndisorder in the vicinity of the Anderson transition localization corrections\nlead to the additional growth of $H_{c2}(T)$ at low temperatures, so that the\n$H_{c2}(T)$ dependence becomes concave. In BCS - BEC crossover region and in\nBEC limit disorder only slightly influences the slope of the upper critical\nfield close to $T_{c}$. However, in the low temperature region $H_{c2}(T)$ may\nsignificantly grow with disorder in the vicinity of the Anderson transition,\nwhere localization corrections notably increase $H_{c2}(T=0)$ also making\n$H_{c2}(T)$ dependence concave.\n", "  We consider a chain of regularly-spaced spherical metallic nanoparticles,\nwhere each particle supports three degenerate localized surface plasmons. Due\nto the dipolar interaction between the nanoparticles, the localized plasmons\ncouple to form extended collective modes. Using an open quantum system approach\nin which the collective plasmons are interacting with vacuum electromagnetic\nmodes and which, importantly, readily incorporates retardation via the\nlight-matter coupling, we analytically evaluate the resulting radiative\nfrequency shifts of the plasmonic bandstructure. For subwavelength-sized\nnanoparticles, our analytical treatment provides an excellent quantitative\nagreement with the results stemming from laborious numerical calculations based\non fully-retarded solutions to Maxwell's equations. Indeed, the explicit\nexpressions for the plasmonic spectrum which we provide showcase how including\nretardation gives rise to a logarithmic singularity in the bandstructure of\ntransverse-polarized plasmons. We further study the impact of retardation\neffects on the propagation of plasmonic excitations along the chain. While for\nthe longitudinal modes, retardation has a negligible effect, we find that the\nretarded dipolar interaction can significantly modify the plasmon propagation\nin the case of transverse-polarized modes. Moreover, our results elucidate the\nanalogy between radiative effects in nanoplasmonic systems and the cooperative\nLamb shift in atomic physics.\n", "  Double-soft theorems, like its single-soft counterparts, arises from the\nunderlying symmetry principles that constrain the interactions of massless\nparticles. While single soft theorems can be derived in a non-perturbative\nfashion by employing current algebras, recent attempts of extending such an\napproach to known double soft theorems has been met with difficulties. In this\nwork, we have traced the difficulty to two inequivalent expansion schemes,\ndepending on whether the soft limit is taken asymmetrically or symmetrically,\nwhich we denote as type A and B respectively. We show that soft-behaviour for\ntype A scheme can simply be derived from single soft theorems, and are thus\nnon-preturbatively protected. For type B, the information of the four-point\nvertex is required to determine the corresponding soft theorems, and thus are\nin general not protected. This argument can be readily extended to general\nmulti-soft theorems. We also ask whether unitarity can be emergent from\nlocality together with the two kinds of soft theorems, which has not been fully\ninvestigated before.\n", "  We consider non-ergodic magnetic random Sch\\\"odinger operators with a bounded\nmagnetic vector potential. We prove an optimal Wegner estimate valid at all\nenergies. The proof is an adaptation of the arguments from [Kle13], combined\nwith a recent quantitative unique continuation estimate for eigenfunctions of\nelliptic operators from [BTV15]. This generalizes Klein's result to operators\nwith a bounded magnetic vector potential. Moreover, we study the dependence of\nthe Wegner-constant on the disorder parameter. In particular, we show that\nabove the model-dependent threshold $E_0(\\infty) \\in (0, \\infty]$, it is\nimpossible that the Wegner-constant tends to zero if the disorder increases.\nThis result is new even for the standard (ergodic) Anderson Hamiltonian with\nvanishing magnetic field.\n", "  We point out that recent Verlinde's proposal of emergent gravity suffers from\nsome internal inconsistencies. The main idea in this proposal is to preserve\ngeneral relativity at short scales where numerous tests verified its validity,\nbut modify it on large scales where we meet puzzles raised by observations (in\nparticular dark matter), by using some entropic concepts. We first point out\nthat gravity as a conservative force is very difficult (if possible at all) to\nportray as an entropic force. We then show that the derivation of the MOND\nrelation using the elastic strain idea is not self-consistent. When properly\ndone, Verlinde's elaborate procedure recovers the standard Newtonian gravity\ninstead of MOND.\n", "  Conversion of electric current into heat involves microscopic processes that\noperate on nanometer length-scales and release minute amounts of power. While\ncentral to our understanding of the electrical properties of materials,\nindividual mediators of energy dissipation have so far eluded direct\nobservation. Using scanning nano-thermometry with sub-micro K sensitivity we\nvisualize and control phonon emission from individual atomic defects in\ngraphene. The inferred electron-phonon 'cooling power spectrum' exhibits sharp\npeaks when the Fermi level comes into resonance with electronic quasi-bound\nstates at such defects, a hitherto uncharted process. Rare in the bulk but\nabundant at graphene's edges, switchable atomic-scale phonon emitters define\nthe dominant dissipation mechanism. Our work offers new insights for addressing\nkey materials challenges in modern electronics and engineering dissipation at\nthe nanoscale.\n", "  One often hears that the strong $CP$ problem is the one problem which cannot\nbe solved by anthropic reasoning. We argue that this is not so. Due to\nnonperturbative dynamics, states with a different $CP$ violating paramenter\n$\\theta$ acquire different vacuum energies after the QCD phase transition.\nThese add to the total variation of the cosmological constant in the putative\nlandscape of Universes. An interesting possibility arises when the cosmological\nconstant is mostly cancelled by the membrane nucleation mechanism. If the step\nsize in the resulting discretuum of cosmological constants, $\\Delta \\Lambda$,\nis in the interval $({\\rm meV})^4 < \\Delta \\Lambda < (100 \\, {\\rm MeV})^4$, the\ncancellation of vacuum energy can be assisted by the scanning of $\\theta$. For\n$({\\rm meV})^4 < \\Delta \\Lambda < ({\\rm keV})^4$ this yields $\\theta <\n10^{-10}$, meeting the observational limits. This scenario opens up 24 orders\nof magnitude of acceptable parameter space for $\\Delta \\Lambda$ compared to\nmembrane nucleation acting alone. In such a Universe one may not need a light\naxion to solve the strong $CP$ problem.\n", "  The nuclear force is the heart of nuclear physics and, thus, the significance\nof this force for all of nuclear physics can hardly be overstated. Research on\nthis crucial force has by now spanned eight decades and we are still not done.\n  I will first review the rich history of hope and desperation, which had\nspin-off far beyond just nuclear physics. Next, I will present the current\nstatus in the field which is charcterized by the application of an effective\nfield theory (EFT) that is believed to represent QCD in the low energy regime\ntypical for nuclear physics. During the past two decades, this EFT has become\nthe favorite vehicle to derive nuclear two- and many-body forces. Finally, I\nwill take a look into the future: What developments can we expect from the next\ndecades? Will the 30-year cycles of new and \"better\" ideas for efficiently\ndescribing nuclear forces go on for ever, or is there hope for closure?\n", "  In this work we use the GPU porting task for the operative Japanese weather\nprediction model \"ASUCA\" as an opportunity to examine productivity issues with\nOpenACC when applied to structured grid problems. We then propose \"Hybrid\nFortran\", an approach that combines the advantages of directive based methods\n(no rewrite of existing code necessary) with that of stencil DSLs (memory\nlayout is abstracted). This gives the ability to define multiple\nparallelizations with different granularities in the same code. Without\ncompromising on performance, this approach enables a major reduction in the\ncode changes required to achieve a hybrid GPU/CPU parallelization - as\ndemonstrated with our ASUCA implementation using Hybrid Fortran.\n", "  We explore the star forming properties of late type, low surface brightness\n(LSB) galaxies. The star forming main sequence (SFR-$M_*$) of LSB dwarfs has a\nsteep slope, indistinguishable from unity ($1.04 \\pm 0.06$). They form a\ndistinct sequence from more massive spirals, which exhibit a shallower slope.\nThe break occurs around $M_* \\approx 10^{10}\\;M_{\\odot}$, and can also be seen\nin the gas mass-stellar mass plane. The global Kennicutt-Schmidt law\n(SFR-$M_g$) has a slope of $1.47 \\pm 0.11$ without the break seen in the main\nsequence. There is an ample supply of gas in LSB galaxies, which have gas\ndepletion times well in excess of a Hubble time, and often tens of Hubble\ntimes. Only $\\sim 3\\%$ of this cold gas need be in the form of molecular gas to\nsustain the observed star formation. In analogy with the faint, long-lived\nstars of the lower stellar main sequence, it may be appropriate to consider the\nmain sequence of star forming galaxies to be defined by thriving dwarfs (with\n$M_* < 10^{10}\\;M_{\\odot}$) while massive spirals (with $M_* >\n10^{10}\\;M_{\\odot}$) are weary giants that constitute more of a turn-off\npopulation.\n", "  We present a study of the connection between black hole accretion, star\nformation, and galaxy morphology at z<=2.5. We focus on active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) selected by their mid-IR power-law emission. By fitting optical to\nfar-IR photometry with state-of-the-art spectral energy distribution (SED)\ntechniques, we derive stellar masses, star formation rates, dust properties,\nand AGN contributions in galaxies over the whole COSMOS field. We find that\nobscured AGNs lie within or slightly above the star-forming sequence. We\nconfirm our previous finding about compact host galaxies of obscured AGNs at\nz~1, and find that galaxies with 20-50% AGN contributions tend to have smaller\nsizes, by ~25-50%, compared to galaxies without AGNs. Furthermore, we find that\na high merger fraction of up to 0.5 is appropriate for the most luminous (log\n(LIR/Lsun) ~ 12.5) AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies, but not for the whole\nobscured AGN sample. Moreover, merger fraction depends on the total and\nstar-forming infrared luminosity, rather than the decomposed AGN infrared\nluminosity. Our results suggest that major mergers are not the main driver of\nAGN activity, and therefore obscured AGNs might be triggered by internal\nmechanisms, such as secular processes, disk instabilities, and compaction in a\nparticular evolutionary stage. We make the SED modeling results publicly\navailable.\n", "  The effects of the antenna far-field power pattern limits the imaging\nperformance of modern wide-bandwidth, high-sensitivity interferometric radio\ntelescopes. Given a model for the aperture illumination pattern (AIP) of the\nantenna, referred to as the A-term, the wide-band (WB) A-Projection algorithm\ncorrects for the effects of its time, frequency, and polarization structure.\nThe level to which this correction is possible depends on how accurately the\nA-term, represents the true AIP. In this paper, we describe the A-Solver\nmethodology that combines physical modeling with optimization to holographic\nmeasurements to build an accurate model for the AIP. Using a parametrized\nray-tracing code as the predictor, we solve for the frequency dependence of the\nantenna optics and show that the resulting low-order model for the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (VLA) antenna captures the dominant frequency-dependent\nterms. The A-Solver methodology described here is generic and can be adapted\nfor other types of antennas as well. The parameterization is based on the\nphysical characteristics of the antenna structure and optics and is therefore\narguably a compact representation (minimized degrees of freedom) of the\nfrequency-dependent structure of the antenna A-term. In this paper, we also\nshow that the parameters derived from A-Solver methodology are expected to\nimprove sensitivity and imaging performance out to the first side-lobe of the\nantenna.\n", "  The finite reorient-time of swimmers leads to a finite run length $\\ell$ and\nthe kinetic accumulation boundary layer on the microscopic length scale\n$\\delta$ on a non-penetrating wall. That boundary layer is the microscopic\norigin of the swim pressure, and is impacted by the geometry of the boundary\n[Yan \\& Brady, \\textit{J. Fluid. Mech.}, 2015, \\textbf{785}, R1]. In this work\nwe extend the analysis to analytically solve the boundary layer on an\narbitrary-shaped body distorted by the local mean curvature. The solution gives\nthe swim pressure distribution and the total force (torque) on an arbitrarily\nshaped body immersed in swimmers, with a general scaling of the curvature\neffect $\\Pi^{swim}\\sim\\lambda\\delta^2/L$.\n", "  Strong correlations between electrons and holes can drive the existence of an\nelectron-hole liquid (EHL) state, typically at high carrier densities and low\ntemperatures. The recent emergence of quasi-2D monolayer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) provide ideal systems to explore the EHL state since\nineffective screening of the out of plane field lines in these quasi-2D systems\nallows for stronger charge carrier correlations in contrast to conventional 3D\nbulk semiconductors and enabling the existence of the EHL at high temperatures.\nHere we construct the phase diagram for the photo-induced first-order phase\ntransition from a plasma of electron-hole pairs to a correlated EHL state in\nsuspended monolayer MoS2. We show that quasi-2D nature of monolayer TMDCs and\nthe ineffective screening of the out of plane field lines allow for this phase\ntransition to occur at and above room temperature, thereby opening avenues for\nstudying many-body phenomena without the constraint of cryogenics.\n", "  In the framework of a geometrical model, in which the affine connection of a\nspace is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic field, a possibility of the\nmomentum non-conservation is shown. A toy device with an object moving in a\nmagnetic field is presented for an illustration of the effect.\n", "  Ordering nanoparticles into a desired super-structure is often crucial for\ntheir technological applications. We use molecular dynamics simulations to\nstudy the assembly of nanoparticles in a polymer brush randomly grafted to a\nplanar surface as the solvent evaporates. Initially, the nanoparticles are\ndispersed in a solvent that wets the polymer brush. After the solvent\nevaporates, the nanoparticles are either inside the brush or adsorbed at the\nsurface of the brush, depending on the strength of the nanoparticle-polymer\ninteraction. For strong nanoparticle-polymer interactions, a 2-dimensional\nordered array is only formed when the brush density is finely tuned to\naccommodate a single layer of nanoparticles. When the brush density is higher\nor lower than this optimal value, the distribution of nanoparticles shows large\nfluctuations in space and the packing order diminishes. For weak\nnanoparticle-polymer interactions, the nanoparticles order into a hexagonal\narray on top of the polymer brush as long as the grafting density is high\nenough to yield a dense brush. An interesting healing effect is observed for a\nlow-grafting-density polymer brush that can become more uniform in the presence\nof weakly adsorbed nanoparticles.\n", "  Core-satellite structures are known to exhibit magnetic modes at optical\nfrequencies and their characterization is important for the development of\nmetamaterials and metafluids. We develop a finite-difference time-domain\nelectrodynamics simulation and multipolar analysis approach and apply it to\nidentify the electric and magnetic multipolar nature of modes excited in\ncore-satellite structures composed of silver nanoparticles decorated on\ndielectric spheres. In addition to excitation with linearly polarized scalar\nbeams, we investigate the scattering and multipolar properties induced by\ncylindrical vector beams. In contrast to linearly polarized beams, the nature\nof the polarization state in these beams (radial, azimuthal, or \"shear\") can\nselectively excite, enhance, and rotate a family of multipolar modes.\nDisplacement currents induced in the nanoparticle gaps are investigated to\nbetter understand the nature of these excitations. We show that the efficiency\nof driving these modes depends on nanoparticle density and placement. We\npropose that selective magnetic and electric excitations can be codified as\n\"selection rules\" associated with the symmetries of the beams and particles.\n", "  Trirutile-type LiFe$_2$F$_6$ is a charge-ordered material with\nFe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$ configuration. Here its physical properties, including\nmagnetism, electronic structure, phase transition, and charge ordering, are\nstudied theoretically. On one hand, the charge ordering leads to improper\nferroelectricity with a large polarization. On the other hand, its magnetic\nground state can be tuned from the antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic by\nmoderate compressive strain. Thus, LiFe$_2$F$_6$ can be a rare multiferroic\nwith both large magnetization and polarization. Most importantly, since the\ncharge ordering is the common ingredient for both ferroelectricity and\nmagnetization, the net magnetization may be fully switched by flipping the\npolarization, rendering intrinsically strong magnetoelectric effect and\ndesirable function.\n", "  We present a new explanation for a quantum eraser. Mathematical description\nof the traditional explanation needs quantum-superposition states. However, the\nphenomenon can be explained without quantum-superposition states by introducing\nunobservable potentials which can be identified as an indefinite metric vector.\nIn addition, a delayed choice experiment can also be explained by the\ninterference between the photons and unobservable potentials, which seems like\nan unreal long-range correlation beyond the causality.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of the Baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation (BTFr) for a sample of 32 galaxies with accurate\ndistances based on Cepheids and/or TRGB stars. We make use of homogeneously\nanalysed photometry in 18 bands ranging from the FUV to 160 $\\mu$m, allowing us\nto investigate the effect of the inferred stellar mass-to-light ratio\n$\\Upsilon_{*}$ on the statistical properties of the BTFr. Stellar masses of our\nsample galaxies are derived with four different methods based on full\nSED-fitting, studies of stellar dynamics, near-infrared colours, and the\nassumption of the same $\\Upsilon_{*}^{[3.6]}$ for all galaxies. In addition, we\nuse high-quality, resolved HI kinematics to study the BTFr based on three\nkinematic measures: $W_{50}^{i}$ from the global HI profile, and $V_{max}$ and\n$V_{flat}$ from the rotation curve. We find the intrinsic perpendicular\nscatter, or tightness, of our BTFr to be $\\sigma_{\\perp} = 0.026 \\pm 0.013$\ndex, consistent with the intrinsic tightness of the 3.6 $\\mu$m luminosity-based\nTFr. However, we find the slope of the BTFr to be $2.99 \\pm 0.2$ instead of\n$3.7 \\pm 0.1$ for the luminosity-based TFr at 3.6 $\\mu$m. We use our BTFr to\nplace important observational constraints on theoretical models of galaxy\nformation and evolution by making comparisons with theoretical predictions\nbased on either the $\\Lambda$CDM framework or modified Newtonian dynamics.\n", "  High energy cosmic ray electrons plus positrons (CREs), which lose energy\nquickly during their propagation, provide an ideal probe of Galactic\nhigh-energy processes and may enable the observation of phenomena such as\ndark-matter particle annihilation or decay. The CRE spectrum has been directly\nmeasured up to $\\sim 2$ TeV in previous balloon- or space-borne experiments,\nand indirectly up to $\\sim 5$ TeV by ground-based Cherenkov $\\gamma$-ray\ntelescope arrays. Evidence for a spectral break in the TeV energy range has\nbeen provided by indirect measurements of H.E.S.S., although the results were\nqualified by sizeable systematic uncertainties. Here we report a direct\nmeasurement of CREs in the energy range $25~{\\rm GeV}-4.6~{\\rm TeV}$ by the\nDArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) with unprecedentedly high energy\nresolution and low background. The majority of the spectrum can be properly\nfitted by a smoothly broken power-law model rather than a single power-law\nmodel. The direct detection of a spectral break at $E \\sim0.9$ TeV confirms the\nevidence found by H.E.S.S., clarifies the behavior of the CRE spectrum at\nenergies above 1 TeV and sheds light on the physical origin of the sub-TeV\nCREs.\n", "  Using a suitable stochastic version of the compactness argument of [V. V.\nZhikov, 2000. On an extension of the method of two-scale convergence and its\napplications. Sb. Math., 191(7--8), 973--1014], we develop a probabilistic\nframework for the analysis of heterogeneous media with high contrast. We show\nthat an appropriately defined multiscale limit of the field in the original\nmedium satisfies a system of equations corresponding to the coupled\n\"macroscopic\" and \"microscopic\" components of the field, giving rise to an\nanalogue of the \"Zhikov function\", which represents the effective dispersion of\nthe medium. We demonstrate that, under some lenient conditions within the new\nframework, the spectra of the original problems converge to the spectrum of\ntheir homogenisation limit.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the early-time inflation in a scalar-tensor theory\nof gravity where the scalar field is minimally coupled with the Gauss-Bonnet\nfour dimensional topological invariant. The theory belongs to a class of\nHorndeski models where the field equations are at the second order like in\nGeneral Relativity. A viable inflationary scenario must correctly reproduce the\nlast Plank satellite data. By starting from some simple assumptions on the\nfield and on the coupling function between the field and the Gauss-Bonnet term,\nwe derive the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the model. Once\nthe model is viable, it is finally possible to fully reconstruct its\nLagrangian.\n", "  Imaging technologies have been developed to assist physicians and dentist in\nthe detection of various diseases. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a new imaging\ntechnique that shows great promise to image soft tissues. The prototype of PAI\nsystem in this study utilized a non-ionizing 532nm continue-wave diode laser\nillumination to image oral soft tissue. The aim of this study was to\ninvestigate the effect of diode laser intensity modulation to the Photoacoustic\nimage quality. Samples in this study were oral soft tissues from six Sprague\nDawley rats imaged by using the PAI system. To determine the optimum duty cycle\nof laser intensity modulation, the laser exposure for oral soft tissue imaging\nwas set in various duty cycles.\n", "  We consider the tetrahedral three-loop diagram in $E_d$ exceptional field\ntheory evaluated as a scalar diagram for four external gravitons. At lowest\norder in momenta, this diagram contributes to the $\\nabla^6 R^4$ term in the\nlow-energy effective action for M-theory. We evaluate explicitly the sums over\nthe discrete exceptional field theory loop momenta that become sums over\n1/2-BPS states in the compact exceptional space. These sums can be rewritten as\nEisenstein series that solve the homogeneous differential equations that\nsupersymmetry implies for the $\\nabla^6 R^4$ coupling. We also show how our\nresults, even though sums over 1/2-BPS states, are consistent with expected\n1/4-BPS contributions to the couplings.\n", "  Various observational properties of Ap/Bp stars have been well-established\nsuch as the often-cited 10% incidence rate of strong, organized magnetic fields\namongst all A- and B-type stars. However, these inferences have generally been\ndrawn fromsurveys biased towards the strongest most easily detectable fields. A\nvolume-limited spectropolarimetric survey of all intermediate-mass stars within\n100 pc was initiated in 2007 in order to avoid the biases inherent in previous\nstudies. This workyielded the magnetic properties of a large number of Ap/Bp\nstars in the sample; however, nearly half of the sample remained either\nunobserved or had relatively poor constraints on their field strengths and\ngeometries. We have recently completed thissurvey using measurements obtained\nby ESPaDOnS and NARVAL. We discuss here some of the recent findings of this\nsurvey.\n", "  Hadron decay chains constitute one of the main sources of information on the\nQCD spectrum. We discuss the differences between several partial wave analysis\nformalisms used in the literature to build the amplitudes. We match the\nhelicity amplitudes to the covariant tensor basis. Hereby, we pay attention to\nthe analytical properties of the amplitudes and separate singularities of\nkinematical and dynamical nature. We study the analytical properties of the\nspin-orbit (LS) formalism, and some of the covariant tensor approaches. In\nparticular, we explicitly build the amplitudes for the B -> psi pi K and B ->\nDbar pi pi decays, and show that the energy dependence of the covariant\napproach is model dependent. We also show that the usual recursive construction\nof covariant tensors explicitly violates crossing symmetry, which would lead to\ndifferent resonance parameters extracted from scattering and decay processes.\n", "  Unveiling the relationships between crime and socioeconomic factors is\ncrucial for modeling and preventing these illegal activities. Recently, a\nsignificant advance has been made in understanding the influence of urban\nmetrics on the levels of crime in different urban systems. In this chapter, we\nshow how the dynamics of crime growth rate and the number of crime in cities\nare related to cities' size. We also discuss the role of urban metrics in crime\nmodeling within the framework of the urban scaling hypothesis, where a\ndata-driven approach is proposed for modeling crime. This model provides\nseveral insights into the mechanism ruling the dynamics of crime and can assist\npolicymakers in making better decisions on resource allocation and help crime\nprevention.\n", "  We have obtained the energy spectra of cosmic ray He, B, C, O, Mg, S and Fe\nnuclei in the range 0.5-1.5 GeV/nuc and above using the penetrating particle\nmode of the High Energy Telescope, part of the Cosmic Ray Science (CRS)\nexperiment on Voyagers 1 and 2. The data analysis procedures are the same as\nthose used to obtain similar spectra from the identical V2 HET telescope while\nit was in the heliosphere between about 23 and 54 AU. The time period of\nanalysis includes 4 years of data beyond the heliopause (HP). These new\ninterstellar spectra are compared with various earlier experiments at the same\nenergies at the Earth to determine the solar modulation parameter, phi. These\nnew spectra are also compared with recent measurements of the spectra of the\nsame nuclei measured by the same telescope at low energies. It is found that\nthe ratio of intensities at 100 MeV/nuc to those at 1.0 GeV/nuc are\nsignificantly Z dependent. Some of this Z dependence can be explained by the Z2\ndependence of energy loss by ionization in the 7-10 g/cm2 of interstellar H and\nHe traversed by cosmic rays of these energies in the galaxy; some by the Z\ndependent loss due to nuclear interactions in this same material; some by\npossible differences in the source spectra of these nuclei and some by the\nnon-uniformity of the source distribution and propagation conditions. The\nobserved features of the spectra, also including a Z dependence of the peak\nintensities of the various nuclei, pose interesting problems related to the\npropagation and source distribution of these cosmic rays.\n", "  HD 100546 is a young, early-type star and key laboratory for studying gas\ngiant planet formation. GPI data taken in 2015 and reported by Currie et al.\n(2015) recover the previously-identified protoplanet candidate HD 100546 b and\nidentify a second emission source at ~13--14 au: either a disk hot spot or a\nsecond protoplanetary candidate (HD 100546 \"c\").\n  In this short research note, we update the status of HD 100546 as observed by\nthe Gemini Planet Imager by rereducing our original data using a different PSF\nsubtraction method (KLIP instead of A-LOCI), rereducing recently public GPI\nCampaign Team (GPIES) data, and comparing the quality of the two data sets. Our\nresults support the original findings in Currie et al. (2015).\n", "  A recent analysis of high precision photometry obtained using the Kepler\nspacecraft has revealed two surprising discoveries: (1) over 860 main sequence\nA-type stars -- approximately 40% of those identified in the Kepler field --\nexhibit periodic variability that may be attributable to rotational modulation\nby spots and (2) many of their light curves indicate the presence of a\nmysterious and characteristic power spectral feature. We have been carrying out\nan ongoing analysis designed to expand upon these discoveries and to provide a\npossible explanation for the unusual power spectral features. In the following,\nwe will put these recent discoveries into context as well as discuss the\npreliminary findings yielded by our analysis of the Kepler light curves.\n", "  The influence of temperature is a major problem in Structural Health\nMonitoring diagnosis using guided waves. In this article, two methods for\ntemperature compensation are used to evaluate the temperature of a structure\nmonitored by Piezoceramic Transducers (PZT). The first one consists in a linear\nregression of the static capacity of the PZT (computed with the\nelectromechanical impedance) with the temperature. It allows one to determine\ntemperature of a PZT from any impedance measurement. The second method is based\non the Modes Frequency Shift (MFS) of the frequency response function (FRF)\ncalculated in a pitch-catch mode with an exponential sweep signal. A linear\nregression between the MFS and the temperature is settled for most modes and\nallow the estimation of temperature between two PZT. Experiments on a composite\nplate monitored by 5 PZT patches showed that a $\\pm$2{\\textdegree}C degree\nvariation can easily be identified with both methods. Combined together, those\ntwo methods could replace actual temperature sensors and bring an efficient\nimprovement for temperature compensation in applications where the temperature\nvariation is heterogeneous on a structure.\n", "  Optical modulators are one of the most important elements of photonic\ncircuits. Here, we designed, fabricated and characterized a nanophotonic all\noptical modulator (NOM) in silicon that is an order of magnitude smaller than\nany previous silicon modulators, and exhibits an extinction ratio and operable\nspectrum that are an order of magnitude larger than alternatives. Simulations\nindicate that our device can provide about 9.5dB extinction ratio with a\nbandwidth of 10nm, centered at 1.55um, corresponding to extinction ratio per\ndevice length of about 3.2dB/{\\mu}m. Our device is fully compatible with\nstandard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes.\nThe device is an example of a photonic device designed using multi-state\ntopological optimization and will lead to a new class of ultra-compact and\nmulti-functional active integrated-silicon devices.\n", "  This paper presents the design, the fabrication and the characterization of\nSchottky graphene/silicon photodetectors, operating at both 2 micron and room\ntemperature. The graphene/silicon junction has been carefully: characterized\ndevice shows a non ideal behaviour with the increasing temperature and the\ninterfacial trap density has been measured as 1.1x10^14 eV^-1cm^-2.\nPhotodetectors are characterized by an internal (external) responsivity of 10.3\nmA/W (0.16 mA/W) in an excellent agreement with the theory. Our devices pave\nthe way for developing hybrid graphene-Si free-space illuminated PDs operating\nat 2 micron, for free-space optical communications, optical coherence\ntomography and light-radars.\n", "  We develop a method for the simulation of scalar field theories with complex\nactions which is local, simple to implement and can be used in any number of\nspace-time dimensions. For model systems satisfying the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry\ncondition $L^{*}(\\phi)=L(-\\phi)$, the complex weight problem is reduced to a\nsign problem. The sign problem is eliminated completely for a large subclass of\nthese models; this class includes models within the $i\\phi^{3}$ universality\nclass, and also models with nonzero chemical potential. Simulations of models\nfrom this subclass show a rich set of behaviors. Propagators may exhibit damped\noscillations, indicating a clear violation of spectral positivity. Modulated\nphases occur in some models, exhibiting striping and other pattern-forming\nbehaviors. These field theory models are connected to complex systems where\npattern formation occurs because of competition between interactions at two\ndifferent length scales.\n", "  The Haag-Kastler net of local von Neumann algebras is constructed in the\nultraviolet finite regime of the sine-Gordon model, and its equivalence with\nthe massive Thirring model is proved. In contrast to other authors, we do not\nadd an auxiliary mass term, and we work completely in Lorentzian signature. The\nconstruction is based on the functional formalism for perturbative Algebraic\nQuantum Field Theory together with estimates originally derived within\nConstructive Quantum Field Theory and adapted to Lorentzian signature. The\npaper extends previous work by two of us.\n", "  Stochastic image reconstruction is a key part of modern digital rock physics\nand materials analysis that aims to create numerous representative samples of\nmaterial micro-structures for upscaling, numerical computation of effective\nproperties and uncertainty quantification. We present a method of\nthree-dimensional stochastic image reconstruction based on generative\nadversarial neural networks (GANs). GANs represent a framework of unsupervised\nlearning methods that require no a priori inference of the probability\ndistribution associated with the training data. Using a fully convolutional\nneural network allows fast sampling of large volumetric images.We apply a GAN\nbased workflow of network training and image generation to an oolitic Ketton\nlimestone micro-CT dataset. Minkowski functionals, effective permeability as\nwell as velocity distributions of simulated flow within the acquired images are\ncompared with the synthetic reconstructions generated by the deep neural\nnetwork. While our results show that GANs allow a fast and accurate\nreconstruction of the evaluated image dataset, we address a number of open\nquestions and challenges involved in the evaluation of generative network-based\nmethods.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to provide a mathematical theory for understanding\nthe mechanism behind the double-negative refractive index phenomenon in chiral\nmaterials. The design of double-negative metamaterials generally requires the\nuse of two different kinds of subwavelength resonators, which may limit the\napplicability of double-negative metamaterials. Herein, we rely on media that\nconsist of only a single type of dielectric resonant element, and show how the\nchirality of the background medium induces double-negative refractive index\nmetamaterial, which refracts waves negatively, hence acting as a superlens.\nUsing plasmonic dielectric particles, it is proved that both the effective\nelectric permittivity and the magnetic permeability can be negative near some\nresonant frequencies. A justification of the approximation of a plasmonic\nparticle in a chiral medium by the sum of a resonant electric dipole and a\nresonant magnetic dipole, is provided. Moreover, the set of resonant\nfrequencies is characterized. For an appropriate volume fraction of plasmonic\nparticles with certain conditions on their configuration, a double-negative\neffective medium can be obtained when the frequency is near one of the resonant\nfrequencies.\n", "  The Hanbury Brown Twiss (HBT) interferometer was proposed to observe\nintensity correlations of starlight to measure a star's angular diameter. As\nthe intensity of light that reaches the detector from a star is very weak, one\ncannot usually get a workable signal-to-noise ratio. We propose an improved HBT\ninterferometric scheme introducing optical parametric amplifiers into the\nsystem, to amplify the correlation signal, which is used to calculate the\nangular diameter. With the use of optical parametric amplifiers, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio can be increased up to 400 percent.\n", "  Several works have shown that it is possible to conceive non-linear\nMonte-Carlo algorithms, but these works have remained overlooked so far. It is\ncommonly admitted that in non-linear physics it is necessary to start with a\nlinearization step before then calling on the linear Monte-Carlo method. We\nshow here how it is possible to avoid this linearization step in the particular\ncase of the Boltzmann equation. Our method retains the exact character of the\nMonte-Carlo method (unbiased estimation with a reliable evaluation of its\nuncertainty). We also extend to non-linear transport a very strong property of\nMonte-Carlo algorithms in linear transport: the ability to perform probe\ncalculus (evaluate a quantity at a given position and time without computing\nall the field at previous times). Another striking feature of this algorithm is\nits ability to focus on rare events, however scarce they may be, including very\nhigh energy events that are important from the applicative point of view.\n", "  A quasi-one-dimensional analytic model is proposed for the internal fluid of\nrotating detonation combustors (RDCs). This model uses the shock-tube model\nthat constrains the flow to have only a longitudinal component, while admitting\nthe propagation of the detonation wave in the azimuthal direction. The proposed\nmodel is able to compute the thruster performance and two-dimensional\ndistributions of gas properties. The calculation process of the model excludes\niterative calculation or space discretization. The case calculations of the\nhydrogen-air RDC and the ethylene-oxygen RDC are conducted, and the results\ncalculated by the analytic model are compared with those simulated by\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD). Good agreement has been observed between\nthe results obtained with the proposed model and CFD, in terms of both of the\nqualitative and quantitative comparisons. The proposed model is simple and\nfast, and also maintains the fundamental characteristics of RDCs.\n", "  Over a thousand stars in our Galaxy have been detected as radio emitters, but\nno normal stars are known to possess radio-emitting lobes similar to radio\ngalaxies. Several recent attempts by us and other authors to find such objects\nremained inconclusive. Here we present a further search for double-lobed radio\nstars in two large samples of spectroscopic stars: over 20,000 white dwarves\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR12, and 2.5 million stars from the\nLarge Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). These were\ncross-matched with sources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty\nCentimeters (FIRST) survey at 1.4 GHz to look for source pairs straddling the\nstars with moderate symmetry about the stars. We found only four promising\ncandidates for double-lobed radio stars, confirming they must be extremely\nrare. By comparison with SDSS, we inferred that about 16 per cent of LAMOST\nspectra may have erroneous classifications. We also rediscovered the giant\nradio galaxy J0927+3510 and propose a different, more distant host, suggesting\na much larger radio size of 2.7 Mpc.\n", "  A new approach using a hyperbolic-equation system (HES) is proposed to solve\nfor the electron fluids in quasi-neutral plasmas. The HES approach avoids\ntreatments of cross-diffusion terms which cause numerical instabilities in\nconventional approaches using an elliptic equation (EE). A test calculation\nreveals that the HES approach can robustly solve problems of strong magnetic\nconfinement by using an upwind method. The computation time of the HES approach\nis compared with that of the EE approach in terms of the size of the problem\nand the strength of magnetic confinement. The results indicate that the HES\napproach can be used to solve problems in a simple structured mesh without\nincreasing computational time compared to the EE approach and that it features\nfast convergence in conditions of strong magnetic confinement.\n", "  A flux-splitting method is proposed for the hyperbolic-equation system (HES)\nof magnetized electron fluids in quasi-neutral plasmas. The numerical fluxes\nare split into four categories, which are computed by using an upwind method\nwhich incorporates a flux-vector splitting (FVS) and advection upstream\nsplitting method (AUSM). The method is applied to a test calculation condition\nof uniformly distributed and angled magnetic lines of force. All of the\npseudo-time advancement terms converge monotonically and the conservation laws\nare strictly satisfied in the steady state. The calculation results are\ncompared with those computed by using the elliptic-parabolic-equation system\n(EPES) approach using a magnetic-field-aligned mesh (MFAM). Both qualitative\nand quantitative comparisons yield good agreements of results, indicating that\nthe HES approach with the flux-splitting method attains a high computational\naccuracy.\n", "  Gaseous rotating razor-thin discs are a testing ground for theories of spiral\nstructure that try to explain appearance and diversity of disc galaxy patterns.\nThese patterns are believed to arise spontaneously under the action of\ngravitational instability, but calculations of its characteristics in the gas\nare mostly obscured, presumably due to a difficult outer boundary condition.\nThe paper suggests a new effective method for finding the spiral patterns based\non an expansion of small amplitude perturbations over finite radial elements.\nThe final matrix equation is extracted from the original hydrodynamical\nequations without the use of an approximate theory and has a form of the linear\nalgebraic eigenvalue problem. The method is applied to an exactly solvable\nmodel with finite outer boundary and to a galactic disc model.\n", "  The Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL, ascl.net), established in 1999,\nis a citable online registry of source codes used in research that are\navailable for download; the ASCL's main purpose is to improve the transparency,\nreproducibility, and falsifiability of research. In 2017, improvements to the\nresource included real-time data backup for submissions and newly-published\nentries, improved cross-matching of research papers with software entries in\nADS, and expansion of preferred citation information for the software in the\nASCL.\n", "  To visualize the topography of thin oxide films during growth, thereby\nenabling to study its growth behavior quasi real-time, we have designed and\nintegrated an atomic force microscope (AFM) in a pulsed laser deposition (PLD)\nvacuum setup. The AFM scanner and PLD target are integrated in a single support\nframe, combined with a fast sample transfer method, such that in-situ\nmicroscopy can be utilized after subsequent deposition pulses. The in-situ\nmicroscope can be operated from room temperature (RT) up to 700$^\\circ$C and at\n(process) pressures ranging from the vacuum base pressure of 10$^{-6}$ mbar up\nto 1 mbar, typical PLD conditions for the growth of oxide films. The\nperformance of this instrument is demonstrated by resolving unit cell height\nsurface steps and surface topography under typical oxide PLD growth conditions.\n", "  Hydrogen-release by photoexcitation, excited-state- hydrogen-transfer (ESHT),\nis one of the important photo- chemical processes that occur in aromatic acids\nand is responsible for photoprotection of biomolecules. The mecha- nism is\ndescribed by conversion of the initial state to a charge- separated state along\nthe O(N)-H bond elongation, leading to dissociation. Thus ESHT is not a simple\nH-atom transfer in which a proton and a 1s electron move together. Here we show\nthat the electron-transfer and the proton-motion are decoupled in gas-phase\nESHT. We monitor electron and proton transfer independently by picosecond\ntime-resolved near-infrared and infrared spectroscopy for isolated\nphenol--(ammonia)5, a benchmark molecular cluster. Electron transfer from\nphenol to ammonia occurred in less than 3 picoseconds, while the overall H-atom\ntransfer took 15 picoseconds. The observed electron-proton decoupling will\nallow for a deeper understanding and control of of photochemistry in\nbiomolecules\n", "  We propose a greedy algorithm for the compression of Wannier functions into\nGaussian-polynomials orbitals. The so-obtained compressed Wannier functions can\nbe stored in a very compact form, and can be used to efficiently parameterize\neffective tight-binding Hamiltonians for multilayer 2D materials for instance.\nThe compression method preserves the symmetries (if any) of the original\nWannier function. We provide algorithmic details, and illustrate the\nperformance of our implementation on several examples, including graphene,\nhexagonal boron-nitride, single-layer FeSe, and bulk silicon in the diamond\ncubic structure.\n", "  The evolution of the electron spin dynamics as consequence of carrier\ndelocalization in $n$-type GaAs is investigated by the recently developed\nextended pump-probe Kerr/Faraday rotation spectroscopy. We find that isolated\nelectrons localized on donors demonstrate a prominent difference between the\nlongitudinal and transverse spin relaxation rates in magnetic field, which is\nalmost absent in the metallic phase. The inhomogeneous transverse dephasing\ntime $T_2^*$ of the spin ensemble strongly increases upon electron\ndelocalization as a result of motional narrowing that can be induced by\nincreasing either the donor concentration or the temperature. An unexpected\nrelation between $T_2^*$ and the longitudinal spin relaxation time $T_1$ is\nfound, namely that their product is about constant, as explained by the\nmagnetic field effect on the spin diffusion. We observe a two-stage\nlongitudinal spin relaxation which suggests the establishment of spin\ntemperature in the system of exchange-coupled donor-bound electrons.\n", "  In the present work we have studied the structural and electronic properties\nof recently synthesized elusive free standing triangulene using density\nfunctional theory. Triangulene, which is a type of graphene quantum dot, is a\nmolecule with an even number of electrons and atoms but the structure of\nmolecule is such that it is impossible to pair all these electrons.\n", "  The QCD axion was originally predicted as a dynamical solution to the strong\nCP problem. Axion like particles (ALPs) are also a generic prediction of many\nhigh energy physics models including string theory. Theoretical models for\naxions are reviewed, giving a generic multi-axion action with couplings to the\nstandard model. The couplings and masses of these axions can span many orders\nof magnitude, and cosmology leads us to consider several distinct populations\nof axions behaving as coherent condensates, or relativistic particles. Light,\nstable axions are a mainstay dark matter candidate. Axion cosmology and\ncalculation of the relic density are reviewed. A very brief survey is given of\nthe phenomenology of axions arising from their direct couplings to the standard\nmodel, and their distinctive gravitational interactions.\n", "  According to the current understanding of cosmic structure formation, the\nprecursors of the most massive structures in the Universe began to form shortly\nafter the Big Bang, in regions corresponding to the largest fluctuations in the\ncosmic density field. Observing these structures during their period of active\ngrowth and assembly - the first few hundred million years of the Universe - is\nchallenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the\ndistant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to\ncapture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been\ndetected so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object\nat redshift 6.900 (less than 800 Myr after the Big Bang) that was discovered in\na wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging reveals this source to be a pair\nof extremely massive star-forming galaxies. The larger of these galaxies is\nforming stars at a rate of 2900 solar masses per year, contains 270 billion\nsolar masses of gas and 2.5 billion solar masses of dust, and is more massive\nthan any other known object at a redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star\nformation is probably triggered by its companion galaxy at a projected\nseparation of just 8 kiloparsecs. This merging companion hosts 35 billion solar\nmasses of stars and has a star-formation rate of 540 solar masses per year, but\nhas an order of magnitude less gas and dust than its neighbor and physical\nconditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity galaxies in the nearby\nUniverse. These objects suggest the presence of a dark-matter halo with a mass\nof more than 400 billion solar masses, making it among the rarest dark-matter\nhaloes that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.\n", "  We used 15 GHz multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) polarization\nsensitive observations of 484 sources within a time interval 1996--2016 from\nthe MOJAVE program, and also from the NRAO data archive. We have analyzed the\nlinear polarization characteristics of the compact core features and regions\ndownstream, and their changes along and across the parsec-scale active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) jets. We detected a significant increase of fractional\npolarization with distance from the radio core along the jet as well as towards\nthe jet edges. Compared to quasars, BL Lacs have a higher degree of\npolarization and exhibit more stable electric vector position angles (EVPAs) in\ntheir core features and a better alignment of the EVPAs with the local jet\ndirection. The latter is accompanied by a higher degree of linear polarization,\nsuggesting that compact bright jet features might be strong transverse shocks,\nwhich enhance magnetic field regularity by compression.\n", "  Measurements of 89Y nuclear spin-lattice relaxation in SrY2O4:Ho3+ crystals\nfor the magnetic field B parallel to the crystal c axis show that 89Y at T < 20\nK relaxes due to fluctuating magnetic field created only by Ho13+ transitions\nbetween the ground and the first excited Zeeman sublevels of the 5I8 multiplet.\n", "  Observation shows that the velocities of stars grow by approximately 2 to 3\norders of magnitude when the distances from the centers of the galaxies are in\nthe range of $0.5$ kpc to $82.3$ kpc, before they begin to tend to a constant\nvalue. Up to know, the reason for this behavior is still a matter for debate.\nIn this work, we propose a model which adequately describes this unusual\nbehavior using a (nearly) cylindrical symmetrical solution in the framework of\na scalar-tensor-like (the Brans-Dicke model) theory of gravity.\n", "  We describe ${\\tt ipole}$, a new public ray-tracing code for covariant,\npolarized radiative transport. The code extends the ${\\tt ibothros}$ scheme for\ncovariant, unpolarized transport using two representations of the polarized\nradiation field: in the coordinate frame, it parallel transports the coherency\ntensor; in the frame of the plasma it evolves the Stokes parameters under\nemission, absorption, and Faraday conversion. The transport step is implemented\nto be as spacetime- and coordinate- independent as possible. The emission,\nabsorption, and Faraday conversion step is implemented using an analytic\nsolution to the polarized transport equation with constant coefficients. As a\nresult, ${\\tt ipole}$ is stable, efficient, and produces a physically\nreasonable solution even for a step with high optical depth and Faraday depth.\nWe show that the code matches analytic results in flat space, and that it\nproduces results that converge to those produced by Dexter's ${\\tt grtrans}$\npolarized transport code on a complicated model problem. We expect ${\\tt\nipole}$ will mainly find applications in modeling Event Horizon Telescope\nsources, but it may also be useful in other relativistic transport problems\nsuch as modeling for the IXPE mission.\n", "  We extend the well known phenomenon of magnetoresistance (extra resistivity\nof materials in transverse magnetic field) to a new and unexplored regime where\nin addition to a transverse magnetic field, a transverse AC field of resonant\nfrequency is also applied. In a magnetic field, electron spin levels are Zeeman\nsplit. In a resonant AC field, we uncover a new channel of momentum relaxation\nin which electrons in upper Zeeman level can deexcite to lower Zeeman level by\ngenerating spin fluctuation excitation in the lattice (similar to what happens\nin Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy). An additional resistivity due\nto this novel mechanism is predicted in which momentum randomization of Zeeman\nsplit electrons happen via bosonic excitations (spin fluctuations). An order of\nmagnitude of this additional resistivity is calculated. The whole work is based\nupon an extension of Einstein's derivation of equilibrium Planckian formula to\nnear equilibrium systems.\n", "  In this paper, we establish some general Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorems\nfor any dimensional manifolds with boundary which generalize the results in\n[WW1].\n", "  We demonstrate by computer simulations, laser plasma experiments, and\nanalytic theory that a hitherto unknown instability is excited in the beam\nplasma system with finite transverse size. This instability is responsible for\nthe generation of magnetic fields at scales comparable to the transverse beam\ndimension which can be much longer than the electron skin depth scale. This\ncounterintuitive result arises due to radiative leakage associated with finite\nbeam boundaries which are absent in conventional infinite periodic systems\nconsidered in earlier simulations as well as theoretical analyses and may\ntrigger a reexamination of a hitherto prevalent idea.\n", "  Every linear system of partial differential equations (PDEs) admits a scaling\nsymmetry in its dependent variables. In conjunction with other admitted\nsymmetries of linear type, the associated invariant solution condition poses a\nlinear eigenvalue problem. If this problem is structured such that the spectral\ntheorem applies, then the general solution of the considered linear PDE system\nis obtained by summing or integrating the invariant eigenfunctions (modes) over\nall eigenvalues, depending on whether the spectrum of the operator is discrete\nor continuous. By first studying the 1-D diffusion equation as a demonstrating\nexample, this method is then applied to a relevant 2-D problem from\nhydrodynamic stability analysis. The aim of this study is to draw attention to\nthe following two independent facts that need to be addressed in future studies\nwhen constructing solutions for linear PDEs with the method of Lie-symmetries:\n(i) Although each new symmetry leads to a mathematically different spectral\ndecomposition, they may all be physically redundant to standard ones and do not\nreveal a new physical mechanism behind the overall considered dynamical\nprocess, as incorrectly asserted, for example, in the recent studies by the\ngroup of Oberlack et al. Hence, with regard to linear stability analysis, no\nphysically \"new\" or more \"general\" modes are generated by this method than the\nones already established. (ii) Next to the eigenvalue parameters, each single\nmode can also acquire non-system parameters, depending on the choice of its\nunderlying symmetry. These symmetry-induced parameters, however, are all\nphysically irrelevant, since their effect on a single mode will cancel when\nconsidering all modes collectively. In particular, the collective action of all\nsingle modes is identical for all symmetry-based decompositions and thus\nindistinguishable when considering the full physical fields.\n", "  We investigate the distance and temperatures scale for which the string in\nbaryonic quark configuration approaches the limiting behavior of mesonic\nstrings in pure Yang-Mills SU(3) lattice gauge theory. We calculate and compare\nthe numerical values of the Polyakov loop correlators and the width profile of\nboth diquark-quark $(QQ)Q$ and mesonic $Q\\bar{Q}$ strings. We find the\ndiquark-quark configuration to exhibit an identical behavior to the mesonic\nstring for the potential and energy-density width profile for temperature near\nthe end of QCD plateau. In the vicinity of the deconfinement point; however,\nthe symmetry in the energy-width profile with the meson does not manifest at\nboth short and intermediate distance scales. Moreover, we observe significantly\ndifferent numerical values for Polyakov loop correlators corresponding to each\nsystem. The splitting of the two identical system suggest that, in the high\ntemperature region of the confined phase of QCD, the subsisted baryonic\ndecouplet states overlap with the excited mesonic spectrum yielding the\ndiquark-quark symmetry with the meson inexact in a small enough neighborhood of\nthe critical point $T_{c}$.\n", "  The effect of mesons $f_{0}(975)$ (named as $f$), $\\phi(1020)$ (named as\n$\\phi$) and $\\delta$ on the moment of inertia of the PNS PSR J0348+0432 is\nexamined in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory considering the\nbaryon octet. It is found that the energy density $\\varepsilon$ and pressure\n$p$ will increase considering the mesons $\\delta$ whereas will decrease as the\nmesons $f$ and $\\phi$ being considered. When the mesons $f, \\phi$ and $\\delta$\nare considered, the energy density and pressure will all decrease. It is also\nfound that the contribution of mesons $f$, $\\phi$ and $\\delta$ to the central\nenergy density is only the central energy density's 0.06$\\sim$0.6\\% whereas the\ncontribution of mesons $f$, $\\phi$ and $\\delta$ to the central pressure is the\ncentral pressure's 4$\\sim$7\\%. For the radius, it will decrease when the\ncontributions of mesons $f$, $\\phi$ and $\\delta$ are considered. The moment of\ninertia $I$ will increase considering the mesons $\\delta$ whereas will decrease\nas the mesons $f$ and $\\phi$ being considered. When the mesons $f$, $\\phi$ and\n$\\delta$ are all considered, the moment of inertia will decrease. It is found\nthat the contribution of mesons $f$ and $\\phi$ to moment of inertia is 4$\\sim$9\ntimes larger than that of mesons $\\delta$. Our results show that the mesons\n$f$, $ \\phi$ and $\\delta$ contribute to the moment of inertia's 2$\\sim$5\\%.\n", "  We consider a nonrelativistic cosmological model introduced in [1] and\nderived as the nonrelativistic limit (or approximation at sub-Hubble scales) of\na general relativistic model in [3, 4]. The latter is defined by an\nenergy-momentum tensor containing only dust and a nontrivial energy flow. The\nnonrelativistic limit contains in leading order a 1st-order relativistic\ncontribution to the spatial curvature whose time-dependence drives the\naccelerated expansion of the Universe (we do not need any kind of dark energy).\nAnalytic solutions of the model are fixed by three constants (initial\nconditions). In the present paper we use our model as a toy model by adjusting\nthe three constants in two different ways to a second order polynomial fit by\nMontenari and R\\\"as\\\"anen [5] to the observed expansion rate $H(z)$ for $z\n\\lesssim 2$ (mainly cosmic chronometer data). In scenario 1 we adjust our model\nto this fit and its derivative at the self-consistently determined transition\nredshift $z_t$. In scenario 2 we use the same fit at $z_t$ and in addition\n$H(z)$ at decoupling $(z = 1089)$. The Hubble parameter $H_0$ is taken from the\npolynomial fit in [5]: $H_0 = 64.2 km/s/Mpc$. For both scenarios we obtain a\nsatisfactory agreement between predicted and observed $H(z)$ values. But the\noutcomes for the curvature function $k(z)$ are completely different: In\nscenario 1 we obtain a strong variation of $k(z)$ ranging from $k(0) = - 1.216$\nup to $k(2.33) = 0.718$. On the other hand scenario 2 shows an almost constant\nvalue for $k(z) \\sim - 1$ for all $z \\lesssim 2$ in agreement with the\npolynomial fit to one of the FRW consistency conditions performed in [5].\n", "  Although, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is a widely used material in numerous\napplications, such as micro- or nanofabrication, the method of its selective\netching has not been known up to now. In this work authors present two methods\nof etching the pure, additive-free and cured PDMS as a positive resist\nmaterial.\n  To achieve the chemical modification of the polymer necessary for selective\netching, energetic ions were used. We created 7 um and 45 um thick PDMS layers\nand patterned them by a focused proton microbeam with various, relatively large\nfluences. In this paper authors demonstrate that 30 wt% Potassium Hydroxide\n(KOH) or 30 wt% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 70 oC temperature etch proton\nirradiated PDMS selectively, and remove the chemically sufficiently modified\nareas. In case of KOH development, the maximum etching rate was approximately\n3.5 um/minute and it occurs at about 7.5*10^15 ion*cm-2. In case of NaOH\netching the maximum etching rate is slightly lower, 1.75 um/minute and can be\nfound at the slightly higher fluence of 8.75*10^15 ion*cm-2.\n  These results are of high importance since up to this time it has not been\nknown how to develop the additive-free, cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) in\nlithography as a positive tone resist material.\n", "  In this contribution we present a systematic comparison of the full off-shell\ncalculation for pp -> ttj in the dileptonic decay channel with a description\nbased on the narrow width approximation. The aim of this study is to estimate\nthe size of off-shell and non-resonant contributions to the shape of\ndifferential distributions, that will be utilized in the top quark mass\nextraction using the template fit method.\n", "  We first propose an alternative to Vasiliev's bosonic higher spin gravities\nin any dimension by factoring out a modified sp(2) gauge algebra. We evidence\nperturbative equivalence of the two models, which have the same spectrum of\nFronsdal fields at the linearized level. We then embed the new model into a\nflat Quillen superconnection containing two extra master fields in form degrees\none and two; more generally, the superconnection contains additional degrees of\nfreedom associated to various deformations of the underlying non-commutative\ngeometry. Finally, we propose that by introducing first-quantized sp(2) ghosts\nand duality extending the field content, the Quillen flatness condition can be\nunified with the sp(2) gauge conditions into a single flatness condition that\nis variational with a Frobenius-Chern-Simons action functional.\n", "  While cell crawling on a solid surface is relatively well understood, and\nrelies on substrate adhesion, some cells can also swim in the bulk, through\nmechanisms that are still largely unclear. Here, we propose a minimal model for\nin-bulk self-motility of a droplet containing an isotropic and compressible\ncontractile gel, representing a cell extract containing a disordered actomyosin\nnetwork. In our model, contraction mediates a feedback loop between\nmyosin-induced flow and advection-induced myosin accumulation, which leads to\nclustering and a locally enhanced flow. Interactions of the emerging clusters\nwith the droplet membrane break flow symmetry and set the whole droplet into\nmotion. Depending mainly on the balance between contraction and diffusion, this\nmotion can be either straight or circular. Our simulations and analytical\nresults provide a framework allowing to study in-bulk myosin-driven cell\nmotility in living cells and to design synthetic motile active matter droplets.\n", "  A fundamental result of Solomyak says that the number of negative eigenvalues\nof a Schr\\\"odinger operator on a two-dimensional domain is bounded from above\nby a constant times a certain Orlicz norm of the potential. Here we show that\nin the case of Dirichlet boundary conditions the constant in this bound can be\nchosen independently of the domain.\n", "  On the base of potential theory of light nuclei cluster photodisintegration\nthe characteristics of Lithium nuclei cluster photodisintegration reactions are\nconsidered in the range of low and intermediate energies. For the inverse\nreaction the interference has an opposite character: in forward semisphere it\nis deconstructive, and in backward semisphere it is constructive. In the energy\nrange above several MeV the E2-multipole becomes dominating. The effect of\nappearance of the node structure of the wave function of relative motion has\nbeen considered in the characteristics of Li cluster photodisintegration\nreaction with polarized and non-polarized photons.\n", "  In early April 2017, five weeks before passing through perihelion, the\ndust-poor comet C/2015 ER61 was observed to undergo a major outburst, during\nwhich its intrinsic brightness increased briefly by about 2 mag. Evidence is\npresented in this paper to suggest that the flare-up was in all likelihood a\nproduct of an event of nuclear fragmentation that gave birth to a companion\nnucleus, which was first detected more than nine weeks later, on June 11, and\nremained under observation for 19 days. The companion is found to have\nseparated from the parent nucleus with a velocity of less than 1 m/s;\nsubsequently it was subjected to a nongravitational deceleration of 14 units of\n10^{-5} the Sun's gravitational acceleration. The companion's overall\ndimensions can from this value be estimated al less than one hundred meters\nacross. Unlike the primary nucleus, the companion displayed considerable\nfluctuations in brightness on time scales spanning at least three orders of\nmagnitude, from a fraction of one hour to weeks. The long temporal gap between\nthe companion's birth and first detection appears to be a corollary of the\nbrightness variability. Evidence from the light curve suggests that the\ncompanion became detectable only because of large amounts of debris that it\nstarted shedding as well as increased activity from area newly exposed by\nprogressive fragmentation, the same process that also resulted in the\ncompanion's impending disintegration by the end of June of in early July.\n", "  We show that the KZB connection on the punctured torus and on the\nconfiguration space of points of the punctured torus can be constructed via the\nhomotopy transfer theorem.\n", "  Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and the related compounds Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and\nNb$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ have attracted considerable interest, as these materials may\nbe realizations of unconventional topological superconductors.\nSuperconductivity with T$_c$ ~ 3 K in Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ arises upon\nintercalation of Sr into the layered topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Here\nwe elucidate the anisotropy of the normal and superconducting state of\nSr$_{0.1}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with angular dependent magnetotransport and\nthermodynamic measurements. High resolution x-ray diffraction studies underline\nthe high crystalline quality of the samples. We demonstrate that the normal\nstate electronic and magnetic properties of Sr$_{0.1}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are\nisotropic in the basal plane while we observe a large two-fold in-plane\nanisotropy of the upper critical field in the superconducting state. Our\nresults support the recently proposed odd-parity nematic state characterized by\na nodal gap of $E_u$ symmetry in Sr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n", "  We propose a method to use artificial neural networks to approximate light\nscattering by multilayer nanoparticles. We find the network needs to be trained\non only a small sampling of the data in order to approximate the simulation to\nhigh precision. Once the neural network is trained, it can simulate such\noptical processes orders of magnitude faster than conventional simulations.\nFurthermore, the trained neural network can be used solve nanophotonic inverse\ndesign problems by using back- propogation - where the gradient is analytical,\nnot numerical.\n", "  A conducting bridge of a single hydrogen molecule between Pt electrodes is\nformed in a break junction experiment. It has a conductance near the quantum\nunit, G_0 = 2e^2/h, carried by a single channel. Using point contact\nspectroscopy three vibration modes are observed and their variation upon\nstretching and isotope substitution is obtained. The interpretation of the\nexperiment in terms of a Pt-H_2-Pt bridge is verified by Density Functional\nTheory calculations for the stability, vibrational modes, and conductance of\nthe structure.\n", "  We extend our previous shell effect observation in gold nanowires at room\ntemperature under ultra high vacuum to the other two noble metals: silver and\ncopper. Similar to gold, silver nanowires present two series of exceptionally\nstable diameters related to electronic and atomic shell filling. This\nobservation is in concordance to what was previously found for alkali metal\nnanowires. Copper however presents only electronic shell filling. Remarkably we\nfind that shell structure survives under ambient conditions for gold and\nsilver.\n", "  Nanowires of different nature have been shown to self-assemble as a function\nof stress at the contact between two macroscopic metallic leads. Here we\ndemonstrate for gold wires that the balance between various metastable nanowire\nconfigurations is influenced by the microstructure of the starting materials\nand we discover a new set of periodic structures, which we interpret as due to\nthe atomic discreteness of the contact size for the three principal crystal\norientations.\n", "  We report experimental evidence for atomic chain formation during stretching\nof atomic-sized contacts for gold and silver, that is strongly enhanced due to\noxygen incorporation. While gold has been known for its tendency to form atomic\nchains, for silver this is only observed in the presence of oxygen. With oxygen\nthe silver chains are as long as those for gold, but the conductance drops with\nchain length to about 0.1 conductance quantum. A relation is suggested with\nprevious work on surface reconstructions for silver (110) surfaces after\nchemisorption of oxygen.\n"]}
