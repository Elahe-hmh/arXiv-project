The approximate value of the exponent at the\nextremum on parametric resonance regions was obtained theoretically by\nintroducing the width of time interval, and the exponents were calculated\nnumerically by solving the stochastic differential equations by a symplectic\nnumerical method. The Mathieu-like equation contains a parameter $\\alpha$ that\nis determined by the intensity of noise and the strength of the coupling\nbetween the variable and the noise. The value of $\\alpha$ was restricted not to\nbe negative without loss of generality. It was shown that the exponent\ndecreases with $\\alpha$, reaches a minimum and increases after that. It was\nalso found that the exponent as a function of $\\alpha$ has only one minimum at\n$\\alpha \\neq 0$ on parametric resonance regions of $\\alpha = 0$. This minimum\nvalue is obtained theoretically and numerically. The existence of the minimum\nat $\\alpha \\neq 0$ indicates the suppression of the growth by multiplicative\nwhite noise.\n", "  We study the spectrum of BPS D5-D3-F1 states in type IIB theory, which are\nproposed to be dual to D4-D2-D0 states on the resolved conifold in type IIA\ntheory. We evaluate the BPS partition functions for all values of the moduli\nparameter in the type IIB side, and find them completely agree with the results\nin the type IIA side which was obtained by using Kontsevich-Soibelman's\nwall-crossing formula. Our result is a quite strong evidence for string\ndualities on the conifold.\n", "  In this paper, spectral analysis of fractional Sturm Liouville problem\ndefined on (0,1], having the singularity of type at zero and research the\nfundamental properties of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the operator.\nWe show that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the problem are real and\northogonal, respectively. Furthermore,we give some important theorems and\nlemmas for fractional hydrogen atom equation.\n", "  The decay of the martian atmosphere - which is dominated by carbon dioxide -\nis a component of the long-term environmental change on Mars from a climate\nthat once allowed rivers to flow to the cold and dry conditions of today. The\nminimum size of craters serves as a proxy for palaeopressure of planetary\natmospheres, because thinner atmospheres permit smaller objects to reach the\nsurface at high velocities and form craters. The Aeolis Dorsa region near Gale\ncrater on Mars contains a high density of preserved ancient craters interbedded\nwith river deposits and thus can provide constraints on atmospheric density\naround the time of fluvial activity. Here we use high-resolution orthophotos\nand digital terrain models from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to identify\nancient craters in Aeolis Dorsa that date to about 3.6 Gyr ago and compare\ntheir size distribution with models of atmospheric filtering of impactors. We\nobtain an upper limit of 0.9$\\pm$0.1 bar, rising to 1.9$\\pm$0.2 bar if rimmed\ncircular mesas - interpreted to be erosionally-resistant fills of floors of\nimpact craters - are excluded. We assume target properties appropriate for\ndesert alluvium: if sediment had rock-like rock-mass strength similar to\nbedrock at the time of impact, the upper limit increases by a factor of up to\ntwo. If Mars did not have a stable multibar atmosphere at the time that the\nrivers were flowing - as suggested by our results - then the warm and wet\nCO2/H2O greenhouse is ruled out, and long-term average temperatures were most\nlikely below freezing.\n", "  We introduce a new statistic, 'spectral goodness of fit' (SGOF) to measure\nhow well a network model explains the structure of an observed network. SGOF\nprovides an absolute measure of fit, analogous to the standard R-squared in\nlinear regression. Additionally, as it takes advantage of the properties of the\nspectrum of the graph Laplacian, it is suitable for comparing network models of\ndiverse functional forms, including both fitted statistical models and\nalgorithmic generative models of networks. After introducing, defining, and\nproviding guidance for interpreting SGOF, we illustrate the properties of the\nstatistic with a number of examples and comparisons to existing techniques. We\nshow that such a spectral approach to assessing model fit fills gaps left by\nearlier methods and can be widely applied.\n", "  Ghost-free theories beyond the Horndeski class exhibit a partial breaking of\nthe Vainshtein mechanism inside non-relativistic sources of finite extent. We\nexploit this breaking to identify new and novel astrophysical probes of these\ntheories. Non-relativistic objects feel a gravitational force that is weaker\nthan that predicted by general relativity. The new equation of hydrostatic\nequilibrium equation is derived and solved to predict the modified behaviour of\nstars. It is found that main-sequence stars are dimmer and cooler than their\ngeneral relativity counterparts but the red giant phase is largely\nindistinguishable. The rotation curves and lensing potential of Milky Way-like\ngalaxies are calculated. The circular velocities are smaller than predicted by\ngeneral relativity at fixed radius and the lensing mass is larger than the\ndynamical mass. We discuss potential astrophysical probes of these theories and\nidentify strong lensing as a particularly promising candidate.\n", "  We investigate dark and visible matter distribution in the Coma cluster in\nthe case of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. A toy model where all\ngalaxies in the cluster are concentrated inside a sphere of an effective radius\n$R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is considered. It enables us to obtain the mean velocity\ndispersion as a function of $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. We show that, within the\nobservation accuracy of the NFW parameters, the calculated value of\n$R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ can be rather close to the observable cutoff of the galaxy\ndistribution. Moreover, the comparison of our toy model with the observable\ndata and simulations leads to the following preferable NFW parameters for the\nComa cluster: $R_{200} \\approx 1.77\\,h^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc} = 2.61\\,\n\\mathrm{Mpc}$, $c=3\\div 4$ and $M_{200}= 1.29h^{-1}\\times10^{15}M_{\\odot}$. In\nthe Coma cluster the most of galaxies are concentrated inside a sphere of the\neffective radius $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\sim 3.7$ Mpc and the line-of-sight velocity\ndispersion is $1004\\, \\mathrm{km}\\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n", "  The most general scalar-tensor theories of gravity predict a weakening of the\ngravitational force inside astrophysical bodies. There is a minimum mass for\nhydrogen burning in stars that is set by the interplay of plasma physics and\nthe theory of gravity. We calculate this for alternative theories of gravity,\nand find that it is always significantly larger than the general relativity\nprediction. The observation of several low mass Red Dwarf stars therefore rules\nout a large class of scalar-tensor gravity theories, and places strong\nconstraints on the cosmological parameters appearing in the effective field\ntheory of dark energy.\n", "  Generic scalar-tensor theories of gravity predict deviations from Newtonian\nphysics inside astrophysical bodies. In this paper, we point out that low mass\nstellar objects, red and brown dwarf stars, are excellent probes of these\ntheories. We calculate two important and potentially observable quantities: the\nradius of brown dwarfs and the minimum mass for hydrogen burning in red dwarfs.\nThe brown dwarf radius can differ significantly from the GR prediction and\nupcoming surveys that probe the mass-radius relation for stars with masses\n$<\\mathcal{O}(0.1M_\\odot)$ have the potential to place new constraints. The\nminimum mass for hydrogen burning can be larger than several presently observed\nRed Dwarf stars. This places a new and extremely stringent constraint on the\nparameters that appear in the effective field theory of dark energy and rules\nout several well-studied dark energy models.\n", "  The Standard Model could be self-consistent up to the Planck scale according\nto the present measurements of the Higgs mass and top quark Yukawa coupling. It\nis therefore possible that new physics is only coupled to the Standard Model\nthrough Planck suppressed higher dimensional operators. In this case the WIMP\nmiracle is a mirage, and instead minimality as dictated by Occam's razor would\nindicate that dark matter is related to the Planck scale, where quantum gravity\nis anyway expected to manifest itself. Assuming within this framework that dark\nmatter is a Planckian Interacting Massive Particle, we show that the most\nnatural mass larger than $0.01\\,\\textrm{M}_p$ is already ruled out by the\nabsence of tensor modes in the CMB. This also indicates that we expect tensor\nmodes in the CMB to be observed soon for this type of minimal dark matter\nmodel. Finally, we touch upon the KK graviton mode as a possible realization of\nthis scenario within UV complete models, as well as further potential\nsignatures and peculiar properties of this type of dark matter candidate. This\nparadigm therefore leads to a subtle connection between quantum gravity, the\nphysics of primordial inflation, and the nature of dark matter.\n", "  We revisit the problem of asymmetric binary hypothesis testing against a\ncomposite alternative hypothesis. We introduce a general framework to treat\nsuch problems when the alternative hypothesis adheres to certain axioms. In\nthis case we find the threshold rate, the optimal error and strong converse\nexponents (at large deviations from the threshold) and the second order\nasymptotics (at small deviations from the threshold). We apply our results to\nfind operational interpretations of various Renyi information measures. In case\nthe alternative hypothesis is comprised of bipartite product distributions, we\nfind that the optimal error and strong converse exponents are determined by\nvariations of Renyi mutual information. In case the alternative hypothesis\nconsists of tripartite distributions satisfying the Markov property, we find\nthat the optimal exponents are determined by variations of Renyi conditional\nmutual information. In either case the relevant notion of Renyi mutual\ninformation depends on the precise choice of the alternative hypothesis. As\nsuch, our work also strengthens the view that different definitions of Renyi\nmutual information, conditional entropy and conditional mutual information are\nadequate depending on the context in which the measures are used.\n", "  In this paper, we establish and employ a local framework to the first order\nof Riemann's curvature tensor in order to develop the corresponding coordinate\nnon commutativity into general manifolds. We also exploit a new translation of\nfunction at the level of quantum mechanics to show that the final correlation\nresult of the generalized non commutativity is a mixture of the Canonical and\nQuadratic formalisms and does not consist only of the Lie algebraic formalism.\nThe basic premise of this article is that the geometry of a four-dimensional\npseudo Riemann manifold representing space time, is homeomorphic to Minkowski\nspace time.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the nested sampling algorithm based on the\nexample of the Potts model. This model, which exhibits a first order phase\ntransition for $q>4$, exemplifies a generic numerical challenge in statistical\nphysics: The evaluation of the partition function and thermodynamic\nobservables, which involve high dimensional sums of sharply structured\nmulti-modal density functions. It poses a major challenge to most standard\nnumerical techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. In this paper we will\ndemonstrate that nested sampling is particularly suited for such problems and\nit has a couple of advantages. For calculating the partition function of the\nPotts model with $N$ sites: a) one run stops after $O(N)$ moves, so it takes\n$O(N^{2})$ operations for the run, b) only a single run is required to compute\nthe partition function along with the assignment of confidence intervals, c)\nthe confidence intervals of the logarithmic partition function decrease with\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$ and d) a single run allows to compute quantities for all\ntemperatures while the autocorrelation time is very small, irrespective of\ntemperature. Thermodynamic expectation values of observables, which are\ncompletely determined by the bond configuration in the representation of\nFortuin and Kasteleyn, like the Helmholtz free energy, the internal energy as\nwell as the entropy and heat capacity, can be calculated in the same single run\nneeded for the partition function along with their confidence intervals. In\ncontrast, thermodynamic expectation values of magnetic properties like the\nmagnetization and the magnetic susceptibility require sampling the additional\nspin degree of freedom. Results and performance are studied in detail and\ncompared with those obtained with multi-canonical sampling. Eventually the\nimplications of the findings on a parallel implementation of nested sampling\nare outlined.\n", "  We prove a determinant formula for a parabolic Verma module of a Lie\nsuperalgebra, previously conjectured by the second author. Our determinant\nformula generalizes the previous results of Jantzen for a parabolic Verma\nmodule of a (non-super) Lie algebra, and of Kac concerning a (non-parabolic)\nVerma module for a Lie superalgebra. The resulting formula is expected to have\na variety of applications in the study of higher-dimensional supersymmetric\nconformal field theories. We also discuss irreducibility criteria for the Verma\nmodule.\n", "  A magnetic skyrmion is a spin whirl with topological protection and high\nmobility to electric current. Intrinsic magnetoelastic coupling in chiral\nmagnets permits manipulation of magnetic skyrmions and their lattice using\nmechanical loads, which is essential for developing future spintronics devices.\nIt is found in experiments that the stability and deformation of skyrmions are\nsensitive to stresses, while the appearance of magnetic skyrmions in turn has a\nsignificant effect on the mechanical properties of the underlying material.\nHowever, a theory which explains these related phenomena within a unified\nframework is not seen. Here we construct a thermodynamic model for B20\nhelimagnets incorporating a magnetoelastic functional with necessary higher\norder interactions derived by group theory. Within the model, we establish the\nmethodology to calculate the phase diagram and equilibrium properties of\nhelimagnets under coupled temperature-magneto-elastic field. Applying the model\nto bulk MnSi, we calculate the temperature-magnetic field phase diagram under\nstress-free condition and its variation when uniaxial compression is applied.\nWe also calculate the variation of all the elastic constants with magnetic\nfield. The results obtained agree quantitatively with corresponding\nexperiments. Our model provides a reliable basis for further theoretical\nstudies concerning any magnetoelastic related phenomena in chiral magnets.\n", "  The analytical solution of the periodic elastic field in chiral magnets\ncaused by presence of periodically distributed eigenstrains is obtained. For\nthe skyrmion phase, both the periodic displacement field and the stress field\nare composed of three \"triple-Q\" structures with different wave numbers. We\nfind that for increasing external magnetic field, one type of \"triple-Q\"\ndisplacement structure and stress structure undergo a configurational reversal,\nwhere the initial and the final field configuration share similar pattern but\nwith opposite direction of all the field vectors. This result is enlightening\nfor designing novel skyrmion-based data-storage devices and microwave\napplications. The solution obtained is of fundamental significance for\nunderstanding the emergent mechanical properties of skyrmions in chiral\nmagnets.\n", "  In non-supersymmetric covariant quantum gravity theory, for each system of\ngravity coupled with single field is one-loop divergent. Since adding other\nfields or other interactions to each system generates more possible\ncounter-Lagrangian terms, there is room for improvement to restore\nrenormalizability. In this paper, we consider Einstein-Maxwell fields coupled\nwith electrically charged scalar which is the simplest model among the systems\nof gravity coupled with multiple fields having their own interaction. First, we\nintroduce how to calculate the possible one-loop diagrams in Einstein-SQED\nsystem and show that this system is non-renormalizable.\n", "  We suggest a microscopic model describing the nonlocal ac response of a pair\nof Majorana states in fermionic superfluids beyond the tunneling approximation.\nThe time-dependent perturbations of quasiparticle transport are shown to excite\nfinite period beating of the wavefunction between the distant Majorana states.\nWe propose an experimental test to measure the characteristic time scales of\nquasiparticle transport through the pair of Majorana states defining, thus,\nquantitative characteristics of nonlocality known to be a generic feature of\nMajorana particles.\n", "  In this paper we present a social network and forensic analysis of the vote\ncounts of Spanish national elections that took place in December 2015 and their\nsequel in June 2016. Vote counts are extracted at the level of municipalities,\nyielding an unusually high resolution dataset with over 8000 samples. We\ninitially consider the phenomenon of Bipartisanship breakdown by analysing\nspatial distributions of several Bipartisanship indices. We find that such\nbreakdown is more prominent close to cosmopolite and largely populated areas\nand less important in rural areas where Bipartisanship still prevails, and its\nevolution mildly consolidates in the 2016 round, with some evidence of\nBipartisanship reinforcement which we hypothesize to be due to psychological\nmechanisms of risk aversion. On a third step we explore to which extent vote\ndata are faithful by applying forensic techniques to vote statistics. We first\nexplore the conformance of first digit distributions to Benford's law for each\nof the main political parties. The results and interpretations are mixed and\nvary across different levels of aggregation, finding a general good\nquantitative agreement at the national scale for both municipalities and\nprecincts but finding systematic nonconformance at the level of individual\nprecincts. As a complementary metric, we further explore the co-occurring\nstatistics of voteshare and turnout, finding a mild tendency in the clusters of\nthe conservative party to smear out towards the area of high turnout and\nvoteshare, what has been previously interpreted as a possible sign of\nincremental fraud. In every case results are qualitatively similar between 2015\nand 2016 elections.\n", "  The generation of realistic spatio-temporal trajectories of human mobility is\nof fundamental importance in a wide range of applications, such as the\ndeveloping of protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks or what-if analysis in urban\necosystems. Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the\nindividuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the\npossibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable\nduration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator),\na framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS\noperates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation\nof the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven\nalgorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the\ntendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a\ntrajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and\npreferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and\ntrajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and\nsynthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating\nDITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show\nthat the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real\ntrajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding\nof the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.\n", "  Social media have great potential to support diverse information sharing, but\nthere is widespread concern that platforms like Twitter do not result in\ncommunication between those who hold contradictory viewpoints. Because users\ncan choose whom to follow, prior research suggests that social media users\nexist in 'echo chambers' or become polarized. We seek evidence of this in a\ncomplete cross section of hyperlinks posted on Twitter, using previously\nvalidated measures of the political slant of news sources to study information\ndiversity. Contrary to prediction, we find that the average account posts links\nto more politically moderate news sources than the ones they receive in their\nown feed. However, members of a tiny network core do exhibit cross-sectional\nevidence of polarization and are responsible for the majority of tweets\nreceived overall due to their popularity and activity, which could explain the\nwidespread perception of polarization on social media.\n", "  In this paper, we would like to systematically explore the implications of\nnon-perturbative effects on entanglement in a many body system. Instead of\npursuing the usual path-integral method in a singular space, we attempt to\nstudy the wavefunctions in detail. We begin with a toy model of multiple\nparticles whose interaction potential admits multiple minima. We study the\nentanglement of the true ground state after taking the tunnelling effects into\naccount and find some simple patterns. Notably, in the case of multiple\nparticle interactions, entanglement entropy generically decreases with\nincreasing number of minima. The knowledge of the subsystem actually increases\nwith the number of minima. The reduced density matrix can also be seen to have\nclose connections with graph spectra. In a more careful study of the two-well\ntunnelling system, we also extract the exponentially suppressed tail\ncontribution, the analogues of instantons. To understand the effects of\nmultiple minima in a field theory, it inspires us to inspect wavefunctions in a\ntoy model of bosonic field describing quasi-particles of two different\ncondensates related by Bogoliubov transformations. We find that the area law is\nnaturally preserved. This is probably a useful set of perspectives that promise\nwider applications.\n", "  The completeness of some classical statistical mechanical (SM) models is a\nrecent result that has been developed by quantum formalism for the partition\nfunctions. In this paper, we consider a 2D classical $\\phi^4$ filed theory\nwhose completeness has been proved in [V. Karimipour and et al, Phys. Rev. A\n85, 032316]. We give a general systematic proof for the completeness of such a\nmodel where, by a few simple steps, we show how the partition function of an\narbitrary classical field theory can be derived from a 2D classical $\\phi^4$\nmodel. To this end, we start from various classical field theories containing\nmodels on arbitrary lattices and also $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories. Then we\nconvert them to a new classical field model on a non-planar bipartite graph\nwith imaginary kinetic terms. After that, we show that any polynomial function\nof the field in the corresponding Hamiltonian can approximately be converted to\na $\\phi^4$ term by adding enough numbers of vertices to the bipartite graph. In\nthe next step, we give a few graphical transformations to convert the final\nnon-planar graph to a 2D rectangular lattice. We also show that the number of\nvertices which should be added grows polynomially with the number of vertices\nin the original model.\n", "  When the temperature of a trapped Bose gas is below the Bose-Einstein\ntransition temperature and above absolute zero, the gas is composed of two\ndistinct components: the Bose-Einstein condensate and the cloud of thermal\nexcitations. The dynamics of the excitations can be described by quantum\nBoltzmann models. We prove that the discrete differential equations for these\nquantum Boltzmann models converge to an equilibrium point. Moreover, this point\nis unique for all initial conditions that satisfy the same conservation laws.\nIn the proof, we establish a connection between quantum Boltzmann models and\nchemical reaction networks, and we show that the question about the convergence\nto equilibrium of quantum kinetic equations is analogous to the global\nattractor conjecture for chemical reaction networks. We then employ a toric\ndynamical system approach, similar to the one used to prove the global\nattractor conjecture, to study the convergence to equilibrium of several types\nof quantum kinetic equations. These convergence results also apply to the weak\nturbulence Boltzmann equation for phonon interactions in anharmonic crystals.\n", "  We consider the Klein-Gordon equation on a static spacetime and minimally\ncoupled to a static electromagnetic potential. We show that it is essentially\nself-adjoint on $C_{\\mathrm{c}}^\\infty$. We discuss various distinguished\ninverses and bisolutions of the Klein-Gordon operator, focusing on the\nso-called Feynman propagator. We show that the Feynman propagator can be\nconsidered the boundary value of the resolvent of the Klein-Gordon operator, in\nthe spirit of the limiting absorption principle known from the theory of\nSchr\\\"odinger operators. We also show that the Feynman propagator is the limit\nof the inverse of the Wick rotated Klein-Gordon operator.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an\ninhomogeneous media with a conductive boundary. First, we discuss the inverse\nconductivity problem of reconstructing the conductivity parameter from\nscattering data. Next, we consider the corresponding interior transmission\neigenvalue problem. This is a new class of eigenvalue problem that is not\nelliptic, not self-adjoint, and non-linear, which gives the possibility of\ncomplex eigenvalues. We investigate the convergence of the eigenvalues as the\nconductivity parameter tends to zero as well as prove existence and\ndiscreteness for the case of an absorbing media. Lastly, several numerical and\nanalytical results support the theory and we show that the inside-outside\nduality method can be used to reconstruct the interior conductive eigenvalues.\n", "  We show that recent multivariate generalizations of the Araki-Lieb-Thirring\ninequality and the Golden-Thompson inequality [Sutter, Berta, and Tomamichel,\nComm. Math. Phys. (2016)] for Schatten norms hold more generally for all\nunitarily invariant norms and certain variations thereof. The main technical\ncontribution is a generalization of the concept of log-majorization which\nallows us to treat majorization with regards to logarithmic integral averages\nof vectors of singular values.\n", "  A method is presented to evaluate the particle-phonon coupling (PC)\ncorrections to the single-particle energies (SPEs) in semi-magic nuclei. In\nsuch nuclei always there is a collective low-lying $2^+$ phonon, and a strong\nmixture of single-particle and particle-phonon states often occurs. As in magic\nnuclei, the so-called $g^2_L$ approximation, where $g_L$ is the vertex of the\n$L$-phonon creation, can be used for finding the PC correction $\\delta\n\\Sigma^{\\rm PC}(\\varepsilon)$ to the initial mass operator $\\Sigma_0$. In\naddition to the usual pole diagram, the phonon \"tadpole\" diagram is also taken\ninto account. In semi-magic nuclei, the perturbation theory in $\\delta\n\\Sigma^{\\rm PC}(\\varepsilon)$ with respect to $\\Sigma_0$ is often invalid for\nfinding the PC corrected SPEs. Instead, the Dyson equation with the mass\noperator $\\Sigma(\\varepsilon){=}\\Sigma_0{+}\\delta \\Sigma^{\\rm PC}(\\varepsilon)$\nis solved directly, without any use of the perturbation theory. Results for a\nchain of semi-magic Pb isotopes are presented.\n", "  The long standing anomaly in the positron flux as measured by the PAMELA and\nAMS-02 experiments could potentially be explained by dark matter (DM)\nannihilations. This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\". Interestingly, structure formation\nconstraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark\nmatter species. We explore possible cosmological and particle physics\nsignatures in a toy model that realizes this scenario.\n", "  The system that describes the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC)\nand the thermal cloud at finite temperature consists of a nonlinear Schrodinger\n(NLS) and a quantum Boltzmann (QB) equations. In such a system of trapped Bose\ngases at finite temperature, the QB equation corresponds to the evolution of\nthe density distribution function of the thermal cloud and the NLS is the\nequation of the condensate. The quantum Boltzmann collision operator in this\ntemperature regime is the sum of two operators $C_{12}$ and $C_{22}$, which\ndescribe collisions of the condensate and the non-condenstate atoms and\ncollisions between non-condensate atoms. Above the BEC critical temperature,\nthe system is reduced to an equation containing only $C_{22}$, which possesses\na blow-up positive radial solution with respect to the $L^\\infty$ norm (cf.\n\\cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}). On the other hand, at the very low\ntemperature regime, the system becomes an equation of $C_{12}$, with a\ndifferent (much higher order) transition probability, which has a unique global\npositive radial solution with weighted $L^1$ norm (cf. \\cite{AlonsoGambaBinh}).\nIn the current temperature regime, we first decouple the QB and NLS equations,\nthen show a global existence and uniqueness result for positive radial\nsolutions to the spatially homogeneous kinetic system. Different from the case\nconsidered in \\cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}, due to the presence of the\nBEC, the collision integrals are associated to sophisticated energy manifolds\nrather than spheres, since the particle energy is approximated by the\nBogoliubov dispersion law. Moreover, the mass of the full system is not\nconserved while it is conserved for the case considered in\n\\cite{EscobedoVelazquez:2015:FTB}. A new theory is then supplied.\n", "  The Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole solution, which has two event\nhorizons, is considered to examine the relation between the quasi-localized\nenergy complexes on ${\\cal M}$ and the heat flows passing through its boundary\n$\\partial {\\cal M}$. Here ${\\cal M}$ is the patch between cosmological event\nhorizon and black hole event horizon of the SdS black hole solution.\nConclusively, the relation, like the Legendre transformation, between the\nquasi-localized Einstein and M{\\o}ller energy complex and the heat flows\npassing through the boundary is obeyed, and these two quasi-localized energy\ncomplexes could be corresponding to thermodynamic potentials.\n", "  We determine exact exponential asymptotics of eigenfunctions and of\ncorresponding transfer matrices of the almost Mathieu operators for all\nfrequencies in the localization regime. This uncovers a universal structure in\ntheir behavior, governed by the continued fraction expansion of the frequency,\nexplaining some predictions in physics literature.\n  In addition it proves the arithmetic version of the frequency transition\nconjecture. Finally, it leads to an explicit description of several\nnon-regularity phenomena in the corresponding non-uniformly hyperbolic\ncocycles, which is also of interest as both the first natural example of some\nof those phenomena and, more generally, the first non-artificial model where\nnon-regularity can be explicitly studied.\n", "  We derive from first principles the existence of a low-frequency plasmon in a\nstrongly coupled three-dimensional homogeneous electron gas (HEG). From its\ndispersion and its satisfaction of the 3rd frequency sum rule we identify it\nwith the conjectured magnetic excitation in the HEG. This excitation, is\nmaintained by the out-of-phase oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down\ndensities of the electron liquid, but governed solely by the Coulomb\ninteraction between the particles. The frequency square of this mode is\nproportional to the overlap ($r=0$) (absolute) value of the spin-up/spin-down\ncorrelation function, and thus slightly affected by, but not contingent upon\nthe degree of polarization of the electron liquid. We estimate the spectral\nweight of the mode: it is expected to be governed by electron-electron\ncollision induced spin drag. The spectral weight is manifest in the partial\nspin-resolved dynamical structure functions and it is proportional to the\nproduct of the densities of the two spin components. An independent derivation\nbased on a generalized Feynman Ansatz corroborates our result. The relationship\nto the recently identified \"spin plasmon\" excitation is discussed. It is\npointed out that a scattering experiment with polarized neutrons or polarized\nX-rays may be possible avenues to observe equilibrium fluctuations associated\nwith these modes and also to provide information on the spin drag coefficient\nin the HEG.\n", "  Recent technical advances have sparked renewed interest in physical systems\nthat couple simultaneously to different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,\nthus enabling transduction of signals between vastly different frequencies at\nthe level of single photons. Such hybrid systems have demonstrated frequency\nconversion of classical signals and have the potential of enabling quantum\nstate transfer, e.g., between superconducting circuits and traveling optical\nsignals. This article describes a simple approach for the theoretical\ncharacterization of the performance of quantum transducers. Given that, in\npractice, one cannot attain ideal one-to-one quantum conversion, we explore how\nwell the transducer performs in scenarios ranging from classical signal\ndetection to applications for quantum information processing. While the\nperformance of the transducer depends on the particular application in which it\nenters, we show that the performance can be characterized by defining two\nsimple parameters: the signal transfer efficiency $\\eta$ and the added noise\n$N$.\n", "  A method is developed to consider the particle-phonon coupling (PC) effects\nin the calculation of the odd-even double mass differences (DMD) in semi-magic\nnuclei starting from the free $NN$-potential. The PC correction $\\delta\n\\Sigma^{\\rm PC}$ to the mass operator $\\Sigma$ is found in\n$g_L^2$-approximation, $g_L$ being the vertex of creating the $L$-phonon. The\ntadpole term of the operator $\\delta \\Sigma^{\\rm PC}$ is taken into account.\nThe method is based on a direct, without any use of the perturbation theory,\nsolution of the Dyson equation with the mass operator\n$\\Sigma(\\epsilon){=}\\Sigma_0{+}\\delta \\Sigma^{\\rm PC}(\\epsilon)$ for finding\nthe single-particle energies and $Z$-factors. In its turn, they are used as an\ninput for finding different PC corrections to the DMD values. Results for a\nchain of even semi-magic nuclei $^{200-206}$Pb show that the inclusion of the\nPC corrections makes agreement with the experimental data significantly better.\n", "  We present a Scanning Hall Probe Microscope operating in ambient conditions.\nOne of the unique features of this microscope is the use of the same stepper\nmotors for both sample positioning as well as scanning, which makes it possible\nto have a large scan range (few mm) in x and y directions, with a scan\nresolution of 0.1 $\\mu$m. Protocols have been implemented to enable scanning at\ndifferent heights from the sample surface. The z range is 35 mm.\nMicrostructured Hall probes of size 1-5 $\\mu$m have been developed. A minimum\nprobe-sample distance \\textless{} 2 $\\mu$m has been obtained by the combination\nof new Hall probes and probe-sample distance regulation using a tuning fork\nbased force detection technique. The system is also capable of recording local\nB(z) profiles. We discuss the application of the microscope for the study of\nmicro-magnet arrays being developed for applications in micro-systems. *\ngorky.shaw@ulg.ac.be.; Present address:\n", "  We analytically evaluate the entanglement spectra of the superconductivity\nstates in graphene, primarily focusing on the s-wave and chiral $\nd_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy} $ superconductivity states. We demonstrate that the\ntopology of the entanglement Hamiltonian can differ from that of the subsystem\nHamiltonian. In particular, the topological properties of the entanglement\nHamiltonian of the chiral $ d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}+id_{xy} $ superconductivity state\nobtained by tracing out one spin direction clearly differ from those of the\ntime-reversal invariant Hamiltonian of noninteracting fermions on the honeycomb\nlattice.\n", "  We establish a connection between an arbitrary Hermitian tight-binding model\nwith chiral (C) symmetry and its non-Hermitian counterpart with chiral-time (CT\n) symmetry.We show that such a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is pseudo-Hermitian.\nThe eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can be easily\nobtained from those of its parent Hermitian Hamiltonian. It provides a way to\ngenerate a class of non-Hermitian models with a tunable full real band\nstructure by means of additional imaginary potentials.We also present an\nillustrative example that could achieve a cone structure from the energy band\nof a two-layer Hermitian square lattice model.\n", "  We study the Majorana bound states arising in quasi-one-dimensional systems\nwith Rashba spin-orbit coupling in the presence of an in-plane Zeeman magnetic\nfield. Using two different methods, first, the numerical diagonalization of the\ntight-binding Hamiltonian, and second, finding the singular points of the\nHamiltonian (see Refs. [1-4]), we obtain the topological phase diagram for\nthese systems as a function of the chemical potential and the magnetic field,\nand we demonstrate the consistency of these two methods. By introducing\ndisorder into these systems we confirm that the states with even number of\nMajorana pairs are not topologically protected. Finally, we show that a formal\ncalculation of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants recovers correctly the\nparity of the number of Majorana bound states pairs, and it is thus fully\nconsistent with the phase diagrams of the disordered systems.\n", "  We derive spectral sum rules in the shear channel for conformal field\ntheories at finite temperature in general $d\\geq 3$ dimensions. The sum rules\nresult from the OPE of the stress tensor at high frequency as well as the\nhydrodynamic behaviour of the theory at low frequencies. The sum rule states\nthat a weighted integral of the spectral density over frequencies is\nproportional to the energy density of the theory. We show that the\nproportionality constant can be written in terms the Hofman-Maldacena variables\n$t_2, t_4$ which determine the three point function of the stress tensor. For\ntheories which admit a two derivative gravity dual this proportionality\nconstant is given by $\\frac{d}{2(d+1)}$. We then use causality constraints and\nobtain bounds on the sum rule which are valid in any conformal field theory.\nFinally we demonstrate that the high frequency behaviour of the spectral\nfunction in the vector and the tensor channel are also determined by the\nHofman-Maldacena variables.\n", "  Confinement of the electron gas along one of the spatial directions opens an\navenue for studying fundamentals of quantum transport along the side of\nnumerous practical electronic applications, with high-electron-mobility\ntransistors being a prominent example. A heterojunction of two materials with\ndissimilar electronic polarisation can be used for engineering of the\nconducting channel. Extension of this concept to single-layer materials leads\nto one-dimensional electron gas (1DEG). MoS2/WS2 lateral heterostructure is\nused as a prototype for the realisation of 1DEG. The electronic polarisation\ndiscontinuity is achieved by straining the heterojunction taking advantage of\ndissimilarities in the piezoelectric coupling between MoS2 and WS2. A complete\ntheory that describes an induced electric field profile in lateral\nheterojunctions of two-dimensional materials is proposed and verified by first\nprinciple calculations.\n", "  Fourth-derivative gravity has two free parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$,\nwhich couple the curvature-squared terms $R^2$ and $R_{\\mu\\nu}^2$. Relativistic\neffects and short-range laboratory experiments can be used to provide upper\nlimits to these constants. In this work we briefly review both types of\nexperimental results in the context of higher-derivative gravity. The strictest\nlimit follows from the second kind of test. Interestingly enough, the bound on\n$\\beta$ due to semiclassical light deflection at the solar limb is only one\norder of magnitude larger.\n", "  We study inverse boundary problems for a one dimensional linear\nintegro-differential equation of the Gurtin--Pipkin type with the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann map as the inverse data. Under natural conditions on the\nkernel of the integral operator, we give the explicit formula for the solution\nof the problem with the observation on the semiaxis $t>0.$\n  For the observation on finite time interval, we prove the uniqueness result,\nwhich is similar to the local Borg--Marchenko theorem for the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation.\n", "  The Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture connects the entanglement entropy in the\nboundary CFT to the area of open co-dimension two minimal surfaces in the bulk.\nEspecially in AdS(4), the latter are two-dimensional surfaces, and, thus,\nsolutions of a Euclidean non-linear sigma model on a symmetric target space\nthat can be reduced to an integrable system via Pohlmeyer reduction. In this\nwork, we invert Pohlmeyer reduction to construct static minimal surfaces in\nAdS(4) that correspond to elliptic solutions of the reduced system, namely the\ncosh-Gordon equation. The constructed minimal surfaces comprise a two-parameter\nfamily of surfaces that include helicoids and catenoids in H(3) as special\nlimits. Minimal surfaces that correspond to identical boundary conditions are\ndiscovered within the constructed family of surfaces and the relevant geometric\nphase transitions are studied.\n", "  I conjecture a high-temperature/low-temperature duality for conformal field\ntheories defined on circle fibrations like $S^3$ and its lens space family. The\nduality is an exchange between the thermal circle and the fiber circle in the\nlimit where both are small. The conjecture is motivated by the fact that\n$\\pi_1(S^3/\\mathbb{Z}_{p\\rightarrow \\infty})=\\mathbb{Z}=\\pi_1(S^1\\times S^2)$\nand the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between $S^3/\\mathbb{Z}_{p\\rightarrow\n\\infty}$ and $S^1/\\mathbb{Z}_{p\\rightarrow \\infty} \\times S^2$ vanishes.\nSeveral checks of the conjecture are provided: free fields, $\\mathcal{N}=1$\ntheories in four dimensions (which shows that the Di Pietro-Komargodski\nsupersymmetric Cardy formula and its generalizations are given exactly by a\nsupersymmetric Casimir energy), $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at strong\ncoupling, and the six-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theory. For all examples\nconsidered, the duality is powerful enough to control the high-temperature\nasymptotics on the unlensed $S^3$, relating it to the Casimir energy on a\nhighly lensed $S^3$.\n", "  The insulating honeycomb magnet $\\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ exhibits fractionalized\nexcitiations that signal its proximity to a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL)\nstate, however, at $T=0$, fragile long-range magnetic order arises from\nnon-Kitaev terms in the Hamiltonian. Spin vacancies in the form of Ir$^{3+}$\nsubstituted for Ru are found to destabilize this long-range order. Neutron\ndiffraction and bulk characterization of Ru$_{1-x}$Ir$_{x}$Cl$_{3}$ show that\nthe magnetic ordering temperature is suppressed with increasing $x$ and\nevidence of zizag magnetic order is absent for $x>0.3$. Inelastic neutron\nscattering demonstrates that the signature of fractionalized excitations is\nmaintained over the full range of $x$ investigated. The depleted lattice\nwithout magnetic order thus hosts a spin-liquid-like ground state that may\nindicate the relevance of Kitaev physics in the magnetically dilute limit of\nRuCl$_{3}$.\n", "  We propose a nonparametric approach for probabilistic prediction of the AL\nindex trained with AL and solar wind ($v B_z$) data. Our framework relies on\nthe diffusion forecasting technique, which views AL and $ v B_z $ data as\nobservables of an autonomous, ergodic, stochastic dynamical system operating on\na manifold. Diffusion forecasting builds a data-driven representation of the\nMarkov semigroup governing the evolution of probability measures of the\ndynamical system. In particular, the Markov semigroup operator is represented\nin an orthonormal basis acquired from data using the diffusion maps algorithm\nand Takens delay embeddings. This representation of the evolution semigroup is\nused in conjunction with a Bayesian filtering algorithm for forecast\ninitialization to predict the probability that the AL index is less than a\nuser-selected threshold over arbitrary lead times and without requiring\nexogenous inputs. We find that the model produces skillful forecasts out to at\nleast two-hour leads despite gaps in the training data.\n", "  A synchrotron radiation beamline in the photon energy range of 18 - 240 eV\nand an electron spectroscopy end station have been constructed at the 3 GeV\nDiamond Light Source storage ring. The instrument features a variable\npolarisation undulator, a high resolution monochromator, a re-focussing system\nto form a beam spot of 50x50 micrometer^2 and an end station for angle-resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) including a 6-degrees-of-freedom cryogenic\nsample manipulator. The beamline design and its performance allow for a highly\nproductive and precise use of the ARPES technique at an energy resolution of 10\n- 15 meV for fast k-space mapping studies with a photon flux up to 2 10^13\nph/sec and well below 3 meV for high resolution spectra.\n", "  Gauge-invariant perturbation theory is an extension of ordinary perturbation\ntheory which describes strictly gauge-invariant states in theories with a\nBrout-Englert-Higgs effect. Such gauge-invariant states are composite operators\nwhich have necessarily only global quantum numbers. As a consequence, flavor is\nexchanged for custodial quantum numbers in the standard model, recreating the\nfermion spectrum in the process. Here, we study the implications of such a\ndescription, possibly also for the generation structure of the standard model.\nIn particular, this implies that scattering processes are essentially\nbound-state-bound-state interactions, and require a suitable description. We\nanalyze the implications for the pair-production process $e^+e^-\\to{\\bar f}f$\nat a linear collider to leading order. We show how ordinary perturbation theory\nis recovered as the leading contribution. Developing a suitable PDF-type\nlanguage, we also assess the impact of sub-leading contributions. We find that\nonly for very heavy fermions in the final state, especially top quarks, sizable\ncorrections could emerge. This gives an interesting, possibly experimentally\ntestable, scenario for the formal field theory underlying the electroweak\nsector of the standard model.\n", "  A scalar model is built, as a quantum field theory defined on toroidal\ntopologies, to describe phase transition in films subjected to periodic\nboundary conditions and influenced by an external and constant magnetic field.\nCriticality is studied and the relations between the critical temperature, the\nfilm thickness, the magnetic field strength and the chemical potential are\ninvestigated. Since the model describes a second-order phase transition a\ncomparison with the Ginzburg-Landau theory is made.\n", "  Given the potential X-ray radiation risk to the patient, low-dose CT has\nattracted a considerable interest in the medical imaging field. The current\nmain stream low-dose CT methods include vendor-specific sinogram domain\nfiltration and iterative reconstruction, but they need to access original raw\ndata whose formats are not transparent to most users. Due to the difficulty of\nmodeling the statistical characteristics in the image domain, the existing\nmethods for directly processing reconstructed images cannot eliminate image\nnoise very well while keeping structural details. Inspired by the idea of deep\nlearning, here we combine the autoencoder, the deconvolution network, and\nshortcut connections into the residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural\nnetwork (RED-CNN) for low-dose CT imaging. After patch-based training, the\nproposed RED-CNN achieves a competitive performance relative to\nthe-state-of-art methods in both simulated and clinical cases. Especially, our\nmethod has been favorably evaluated in terms of noise suppression, structural\npreservation and lesion detection.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a method for implementing the interaction-free\nmeasurement (IFM) with mesoscopic devices fabricated on a high mobility\nGaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, where a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system\nis buried, at low temperature. The IFM is amazing evidence of nonlocality of\nthe quantum mechanics because the IFM offers us the capability to detect the\nexistence of an object without interaction with it. A scheme of Kwiat et al.\nfor realizing the IFM lets a probability that we fail to recognize the presence\nof the object be as small as we like, using the quantum Zeno effect.\nConstructing an interferometer of Kwiat et al. for the IFM, we make use of\ntechniques of electron quantum optics and tunnelling microscopes for the 2DEG.\nWe examine a shot noise of an electric current flowing through the\ninterferometer. Our method for performing the IFM aims at achieving a milestone\nof quantum information processing in mesoscopic systems.\n", "  The wave turbulence equation is an effective kinetic equation that describes\nthe dynamics of wave spectrum in weakly nonlinear and dispersive media. Such a\nkinetic model has been derived by physicists in the sixties, though the\nwell-posedness theory remains open, due to the complexity of resonant\ninteraction kernels. In this paper, we provide a global unique radial strong\nsolution, the first such a result, to the wave turbulence equation for\ncapillary waves.\n", "  Pseudogap phase in superconductors continues to be an outstanding puzzle that\ndifferentiates unconventional superconductors from the conventional ones\n(BCS-superconductors). Employing high resolution photoemission spectroscopy on\na highly dense conventional superconductor, MgB2, we discover an interesting\nscenario. While the spectral evolution close to the Fermi energy is\ncommensurate to BCS descriptions as expected, the spectra in the wider energy\nrange reveal emergence of a pseudogap much above the superconducting transition\ntemperature indicating apparent departure from the BCS scenario. The energy\nscale of the pseudogap is comparable to the energy of E2g phonon mode\nresponsible for superconductivity in MgB2 and the pseudogap can be attributed\nto the effect of electron-phonon coupling on the electronic structure. These\nresults reveal a scenario of the emergence of the superconducting gap within an\nelectron-phonon coupling induced pseudogap.\n", "  We extend the standard effective model of d-wave superconductivity of a\nsingle band tight-binding Hamiltonian with nearest-neighbor attraction to\ninclude finite range periodically modulated pair-hopping. The pair-hopping is\ncharacterized by a fixed wave number $\\pmb{\\mathcal{Q}}=\\mathcal{Q}\\hat{x}$\nbreaking lattice rotational symmetry. Within self-consistent BCS theory we\nstudy the general variational state consisting of two incommensurate singlet\npair amplitudes $\\Delta_{{\\bf Q}_1}$ and $\\Delta_{{\\bf Q}_2}$ and find two\ntypes of near degenerate ground states; of the Larkin-Ovchnnikov (LO) or\npair-density wave (PDW) type with $\\Delta_{{\\bf Q}_1}=\\Delta_{{\\bf Q}_2}$ and\n${\\bf Q}_1=-{\\bf Q}_2\\approx \\mathcal{Q}$ or of the Fulde-Ferrell (FF) type\nwith $\\Delta_{{\\bf Q}_2}=0$ and ${\\bf Q}_1\\approx \\pm \\mathcal{Q}$. An\nanomalous term in the static current operator arising from the pair-hopping\nensures that Bloch's theorem on zero current in the ground state is enforced\nalso for the FF ground state, despite broken time-reversal symmetry without\nspin-population imbalance. We also consider a supercurrent by exploring the\nspace of pair-momenta ${\\bf Q}_1$ and ${\\bf Q}_2$ and identify characteristics\nof a state with multiple finite momentum order-parameters. This includes the\npossibility of phase-separation of current densities and spontaneous\nmirror-symmetry breaking manifested in the directional dependence of the\ndepairing current.\n", "  We investigate quantum parameter estimation based on linear and Kerr-type\nnonlinear controls in an open quantum system, and consider the dissipation rate\nas an unknown parameter. We show that while the precision of parameter\nestimation is improved, it usually introduces a significant deformation to the\nsystem state. Moreover, we propose a multi-objective model to optimize the two\nconflicting objectives: (1) maximizing the Fisher information, improving the\nparameter estimation precision, and (2) minimizing the deformation of the\nsystem state, which maintains its fidelity. Finally, simulations of a\nsimplified {\\epsilon}-constrained model demonstrate the feasibility of the\nHamiltonian control in improving the precision of the quantum parameter\nestimation.\n", "  We present an improved way for imaging the local density of states with a\nscanning tunneling microscope, which consists in mapping the surface topography\nwhile keeping the differential conductance (d$I$/d$V$) constant. When\narchetypical C$_{60}$ molecules on Cu(111) are imaged with this method, these\nso-called iso-d$I$/d$V$ maps are in excellent agreement with theoretical\nsimulations of the isodensity contours of the molecular orbitals. A direct\nvisualization and unambiguous identification of superatomic C$_{60}$ orbitals\nand their hybridization is then possible.\n", "  CaFe2As2 exhibits collapsed tetragonal (cT) structure and varied exotic\nbehavior under pressure at low temperatures that led to debate on linking the\nstructural changes to its exceptional electronic properties like\nsuperconductivity, magnetism, etc. Here, we investigate the electronic\nstructure of CaFe2As2 forming in different structures employing density\nfunctional theory. The results indicate better stability of the cT phase with\nenhancement in hybridization induced effects and shift of the energy bands\ntowards lower energies. The Fermi surface centered around $\\Gamma$ point\ngradually vanishes with the increase in pressure. Consequently, the nesting\nbetween the hole and electron Fermi surfaces associated to the spin density\nwave state disappears indicating a pathway to achieve the proximity to quantum\nfluctuations. The magnetic moment at the Fe sites diminishes in the cT phase\nconsistent with the magnetic susceptibility results. Notably, the hybridization\nof Ca 4s states (Ca-layer may be treated as a charge reservoir layer akin to\nthose in cuprate superconductors) is significantly enhanced in the cT phase\nrevealing its relevance in its interesting electronic properties.\n", "  $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is a leading candidate material for theobservation of\nphysics related to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL). By combined\nsusceptibility, specific-heat, and nuclear-magnetic-resonance measurements, we\ndemonstrate that $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ undergoes a quantum phase transition to a\nQSL in a magnetic field of 7.5 T applied in the $ab$ plane. We show further\nthat this high-field QSL phase has gapless spin excitations over a field range\nup to 16 T. This highly unconventional result, unknown in either Heisenberg or\nKitaev magnets, offers insight essential to establishing the physics of\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.\n", "  In conformal quantum mechanics with the vacuum of a real scaling dimension\nand with a complete orthonormal set of energy eigenstates which is preferable\nunder the unitary evolution, the dilatation expectation value between energy\neigenstates monotonically decreases along the flow from the UV to the IR. In\nsuch conformal quantum mechanics there exist bounds on scaling dimensions of\nthe physical states and the gauge operators.\n", "  Using the global properties of the QCD partition function we determine an all\norder perturbative beta function in the background gauge field method to find\nout that it has a simple expressions whose properties and consequences align\nwith other recent results in the QCD literature. We further compute the\nnon-perturbative beta functions for the coupling constant and the theta angle\nin the background of an instanton field with winding number $n$. We solve for\nthe theta angle in the non-perturbative region to determine that it is\napproximately zero. By extrapolating to the full QCD beta functions our result\nmay constitute a solution to the strong CP problem.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological solutions of the $f(T)$ gravity theory using\nthe method of dynamical systems. For this purpose a general form of the $f(T)$\nfunction is considered and four conditions are defined that they have to\nsatisfy in order to describe the standard cosmological history. We examine the\npower law, and another form of $f(T)$ against these conditions. For a power law\nfunction $f(T)= B(-T)^\\beta$, $\\beta$ must be less than one and unequal to\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ to obtain a consistent cosmological model. We also investigate a\nmodel of inflation in this theory.\n", "  Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries residing at the core of merging\ngalaxies are recently found to be strongly affected by the rotation of their\nhost galaxies. The highly eccentric orbits that form when the host is\ncounterrotating emit strong bursts of gravitational waves that propel rapid\nSMBH binary coalescence. Most prior work, however, focused on planar orbits and\na uniform rotation profile, an unlikely interaction configuration. However, the\ncoupling between rotation and SMBH binary evolution appears to be such a strong\ndynamical process that it warrants further investigation. This study uses\ndirect N-body simulations to isolate the effect of galaxy rotation in more\nrealistic interactions. In particular, we systematically vary the SMBH orbital\nplane with respect to the galaxy rotation axis, the radial extent of the\nrotating component, and the initial eccentricity of the SMBH binary orbit. We\nfind that the initial orbital plane orientation and eccentricity alone can\nchange the inspiral time by an order of magnitude. Because SMBH binary inspiral\nand merger is such a loud gravitational wave source, these studies are critical\nfor the future gravitational wave detector, LISA, an ESA/NASA mission currently\nset to launch by 2034.\n", "  Weakly nonlinear degrees of freedom in dissipative quantum systems tend to\nlocalize near manifolds of quasi-classical states. We present a family of\nanalytical and computational methods for deriving optimal unitary model\ntransformations based on representations of finite dimensional Lie groups. The\ntransformations are optimal in that they minimize the quantum relative entropy\ndistance between a given state and the quasi-classical manifold. This naturally\nsplits the description of quantum states into quasi-classical coordinates that\nspecify the nearest quasi-classical state and a transformed quantum state that\ncan be represented in fewer basis levels. We derive coupled equations of motion\nfor the coordinates and the transformed state and demonstrate how this can be\nexploited for efficient numerical simulation. Our optimization objective\nnaturally quantifies the non-classicality of states occurring in some given\nopen system dynamics. This allows us to compare the intrinsic complexity of\ndifferent open quantum systems.\n", "  We propose an explanation for the experiment by Schemm et al., Phys. Rev. B\n91, 140506 (2015) where the polar Kerr effect (PKE), indicating time-reversal\nsymmetry (TRS) breaking, was observed in the hidden-order (HO) phase of\nURu2Si2. The PKE signal on warmup was seen only if a training magnetic field\nwas present on cool-down. Using a Ginzburg-Landau model for a complex order\nparameter, we show that the system can have a metastable ferromagnetic state\nproducing the PKE, even if the HO ground state respects TRS. We predict that a\nstrong reversed magnetic field should reset the PKE to zero.\n", "  We calculate momentum distributions of neutrons and protons in $^3$He in the\nframework of a model which includes 3N interactions together with 2N\ninteractions. It is shown that contribution of 3N interactions becomes\nessential in comparison with contribution coming from 2N interaction for\ninternal momentum in $^3$He $k>$~250~MeV/c. We also compare calculated momentum\ndistribution of protons with so-called empirical momentum distribution of\nprotons extracted from A$(^3\\mathrm{He},p)$ breakup cross-sections measured for\nprotons emitted at zero degree. It is concluded that 3N interactions cannot\ncompletely explain the disagreement between the available data on the empirical\nmomentum distribution of protons in $^3\\mathrm{He}$ and calculations based on\n2N interaction, which is observed at high momentum region of the momentum\ndistribution, $k>$~250~MeV/c.\n", "  A network epidemics model based on the classical Polya urn scheme is\ninvestigated. Temporal contagion processes are generated on the network nodes\nusing a modified Polya sampling scheme that accounts for spatial infection\namong neighbouring nodes. The stochastic properties and the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the resulting network contagion process are analyzed. Unlike the\nclassical Polya process, the network process is noted to be non-stationary in\ngeneral, although it is shown to be time-invariant in its first and some of its\nsecond-order statistics and to satisfy martingale convergence properties under\ncertain conditions. Three classical Polya processes, one computational and two\nanalytical, are proposed to statistically approximate the contagion process of\neach node, showing a good fit for a range of system parameters. Finally,\nempirical results compare and contrast our model with the well-known discrete\ntime SIS model.\n", "  Angular statistics of cosmological observables are hard to compute. The main\ndifficulty is due to the presence of highly-oscillatory Bessel functions which\nneed to be integrated over. In this paper, we provide a simple and fast method\nto compute the angular power spectrum and bispectrum of any observable. The\nmethod is based on using an FFTlog algorithm to decompose the momentum-space\nstatistics onto a basis of power-law functions. For each power law, the\nintegrals over Bessel functions have a simple analytical solution. This allows\nus to efficiently evaluate these integrals, independently of the value of the\nmultipole $\\ell$. In particular, this method significantly speeds up the\nevaluation of the angular bispectrum compared to existing methods. To\nillustrate our algorithm, we compute the galaxy, lensing and CMB temperature\nangular power spectrum and bispectrum.\n", "  We study the electric transport properties of Lix(NH3)yFe2(TezSe1-z)2 single\ncrystals with z= 0 and 0.6 in the mixed state. Thermally-activated flux-flow,\nvortex glass and flux-flow Hall effect (FFHE) behaviors are observed.\nExperimental results show that there are rich vortex phases existing in these\nsystems and the vortex liquid states occupy broad regions of phase diagrams.\nFurther analysis suggests that thermal fluctuation plays an important role in\nthe vortex phase diagrams of Lix(NH3)yFe2(TezSe1-z)2. Moreover, for\nLix(NH3)yFe2Se2, there is no sigh reversal of FFHE in the mixed state and a\nscaling behavior |rhoxy(mu0H)|=Arhoxx(mu0H)^beta with beta ~ 2.0 is observed.\n", "  Measurements of the nearby pulsars Geminga and B0656+14 by the HAWC and\nMilagro telescopes have revealed the presence of bright TeV-emitting halos\nsurrounding these objects. If young and middle-aged pulsars near the Galactic\nCenter transfer a similar fraction of their energy into TeV photons, then these\nsources could plausibly dominate the emission that is observed by HESS and\nother ground-based telescopes from the innermost $\\sim$$10^2$ parsecs of the\nMilky Way. In particular, both the spectral shape and the angular extent of\nthis emission is consistent with TeV halos produced by a population of pulsars,\nalthough the reported correlation of this emission with the distribution of\nmolecular gas suggests that diffuse hadronic processes also must contribute.\nThe overall flux of this emission requires a birth rate of ~100-1000 neutron\nstars per Myr near the Galactic Center, in good agreement with recent\nestimates.\n", "  We address the estimation of the magnetic field B acting on an ensemble of\natoms with total spin J subjected to collective transverse noise. By preparing\nan initial spin coherent state, for any measurement performed after the\nevolution, the mean-square error of the estimate is known to scale as $1/J$,\ni.e. no quantum enhancement is obtained. Here, we consider the possibility of\ncontinuously monitoring the atomic environment, and conclusively show that\nstrategies based on time-continuous non-demolition measurements followed by a\nfinal strong measurement may achieve Heisenberg-limited scaling $1/{J^2}$ and\nalso a monitoring-enhanced scaling in terms of the interrogation time. We also\nfind that time-continuous schemes are robust against detection losses, as we\nprove that the quantum enhancement can be recovered also for finite measurement\nefficiency. Finally, we analytically prove the optimality of our strategy.\n", "  We report on the formation of a stable quantum degenerate mixture of\nfermionic $^6$Li and bosonic $^{133}$Cs in an optical trap by sympathetic\ncooling near an interspecies Feshbach resonance. New regimes of the quantum\ndegenerate mixtures are identified. With moderate attractive interspecies\ninteractions, we show that a degenerate Fermi gas of Li can be fully confined\nin the Cs condensate without external potentials. For stronger attraction where\nmean-field collapse is expected, no such instability is observed. In this case,\nwe suggest the stability is a result of dynamic equilibrium, where the\ninterspecies three-body loss prevents the collapse. Our picture is supported by\na rate equation model, and the crossover between the thermalization rate and\nthe observed inelastic loss rate in the regime where the mean-field collapse is\nexpected to occur.\n", "  We have measured the quantum depletion of an interacting homogeneous\nBose-Einstein condensate, and confirmed the 70-year old theory of N.N.\nBogoliubov. The observed condensate depletion is reversibly tuneable by\nchanging the strength of the interparticle interactions. Our atomic homogeneous\ncondensate is produced in an optical-box trap, the interactions are tuned via a\nmagnetic Feshbach resonance, and the condensed fraction probed by coherent\ntwo-photon Bragg scattering.\n", "  We grew Lix(NH3)yFe2Te1.2Se0.8 single crystals successfully using the\nlow-temperature ammonothermal method and the onset superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc,onset is increased to 21 K when compared to 14 K in the parent\ncompound FeTe0.6Se0.4. The derived critical current density Jc increases\nremarkably to 2.6*10^5 A/cm^2 at 2 K. Further analysis indicates that the\ndominant pinning mechanism in Lix(NH3)yFe2Te1.2Se0.8 single crystal is the\ninteraction between vortex and surface-like defects with normal core, possibly\noriginating from the stacking faults along the c axis, by variations in the\ncharge-carrier mean free path l near the defects (delta l pinning). Moreover,\nthe flux creep is important to the vortex dynamics of this material.\n", "  Light-matter interaction processes are significantly affected by surrounding\nelectromagnetic environment. Dielectric materials are usually introduced into\nan interaction picture via their classical properties, e.g. permittivity,\nappearing in constitutive relations. While this approach was proven to be\napplicable in many occasions, it might face limitations when an emitter is\nsituated very close to a material boundary. In this case nonlocal extend of a\nquantum wave function of an emitter becomes comparable with a distance to a\nboundary and a lattice constant of a material. Here a semi-classical model,\ntaking into account material's granularity, is developed. In particular,\nspontaneous emission process in the vicinity of flat boundaries is considered.\nThe material boundary is divided into a pair areas - far zone is modeled as a\ncontinuous phase, while the near zone next to a nonlocal emitter is represented\nwith a discrete array of polarizable particles. This array resembles optical\nproperties of the continuous phase under the standard homogenization procedure.\nLocal field effects were shown to lead orders of magnitude corrections to\nspontaneous emission rates in the case of sub-nanometer emitter-surface\nseparation distances. The developed mesoscopic model enables addressing few\naspects of local field corrections in quite complex scenarios, where quantum ab\ninitio techniques yet face challenges owing to involved computational\ncomplexity. The developed method could be utilized for designs of quantum\nsources and networks, enhanced with structured electromagnetic environment.\n", "  We demonstrate the full functionality of a circuit that generates single\nmicrowave photons on demand, with a wave packet that can be modulated with a\nnear-arbitrary shape. We achieve such a high tunability by coupling a\nsuperconducting qubit near the end of a semi-infinite transmission line. A dc\nsuperconducting quantum interference device shunts the line to ground and is\nemployed to modify the spatial dependence of the electromagnetic mode structure\nin the transmission line. This control allows us to couple and decouple the\nqubit from the line, shaping its emission rate on fast time scales. Our\ndecoupling scheme is applicable to all types of superconducting qubits and\nother solid-state systems and can be generalized to multiple qubits as well as\nto resonators.\n", "  Random fields disorder Ising ferromagnets by aligning single spins in the\ndirection of the random field in three space dimensions, or by flipping large\nferromagnetic domains at dimensions two and below. While the former requires\nrandom fields of typical magnitude similar to the interaction strength, the\nlatter Imry-Ma mechanism only requires infinitesimal random fields. Recently,\nit has been shown that for dilute anisotropic dipolar systems a third mechanism\nexists, where the ferromagnetic phase is disordered by finite-size glassy\ndomains at a random field of finite magnitude that is considerably smaller than\nthe typical interaction strength. Using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and\nzero-temperature numerical approaches, we show that this mechanism applies to\ndisordered ferromagnets with competing short-range ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic interactions, suggesting its generality in ferromagnetic\nsystems with competing interactions and an underlying spin-glass phase. A\nfinite-size-scaling analysis of the magnetization distribution suggests that\nthe transition might be first order.\n", "  We point out that a simple inflationary model in which the axionic inflaton\ncouples to a pure Yang-Mills theory may give the scalar spectral index (n_s)\nand tensor-to-scalar ratio (r) in complete agreement with the current\nobservational data.\n", "  The existence of dark matter is undisputed, while the nature of it is still\nunknown. Explaining dark matter with the existence of a new unobserved particle\nis among the most promising possible solutions. Recently dark matter candidates\nin the MeV mass region received more and more interest. In comparison to the\nmass region between a few GeV to several TeV, this region is experimentally\nlargely unexplored. We discuss the application of a RNDR DEPFET semiconductor\ndetector for direct searches for dark matter in the MeV mass region. We present\nthe working principle of the RNDR DEPFET devices and review the performance\nobtained by previously performed prototype measurements. The future potential\nof the technology as dark matter detector is discussed and the sensitivity for\nMeV dark matter detection with RNDR DEPFET sensors is presented. Under the\nassumption of three background events in the region of interest and an exposure\nof one kg$\\cdot$y a sensitivity of $\\bar{\\sigma}_{\\bar{e}} = 10^{-41}$ cm$^{2}$\nfor dark matter particles with a mass of 10 MeV can be reached.\n", "  We present a method for computing the full probability distribution function\nof quadratic observables for the Fermi-Hubbard model within the framework of\ndeterminantal quantum Monte Carlo. Especially, in cold atoms experiments with\nsingle site resolution, such full counting statistics can be obtained from\nrepeated projective measurements. We demonstrate, that the full counting\nstatistics can provide important information on the size of preformed pairs.\nFurthermore, we compute the full counting statistics of the staggered\nmagnetization in the repulsive Hubbard model at half filling and find excellent\nagreement with recent experimental results. We show that current experiments\nare capable of probing the difference between the Hubbard model and the\nlimiting Heisenberg model.\n", "  The light-cone (LC) effect causes the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm\nsignal $T_{\\rm b} (\\hat{\\bf{n}}, \\nu)$ to evolve significantly along the line\nof sight (LoS) direction $\\nu$. In the first part of this paper, we present a\nmethod to properly incorporate the LC effect in simulations of the EoR 21-cm\nsignal that include peculiar velocities. Subsequently, we discuss how to\nquantify the second order statistics of the EoR 21-cm signal in the presence of\nthe LC effect. We demonstrate that the 3D power spectrum $P({\\bf{k}})$ fails to\nquantify the entire information because it assumes the signal to be ergodic and\nperiodic, whereas the LC effect breaks these conditions along the LoS.\nConsidering a LC simulation centered at redshift $8$ where the mean neutral\nfraction drops from $0.65$ to $0.35$ across the box, we find that $P({\\bf{k}})$\nmisses out $\\sim 40 \\%$ of the information at the two ends of the $17.41 \\,\n{\\rm MHz}$ simulation bandwidth. The multi-frequency angular power spectrum\n(MAPS) ${\\mathcal C}_{\\ell}(\\nu_1,\\nu_2)$ quantifies the statistical properties\nof $T_{\\rm b} (\\hat{\\bf{n}}, \\nu)$ without assuming the signal to be ergodic\nand periodic along the LoS. We expect this to quantify the entire statistical\ninformation of the EoR 21-cm signal. We apply MAPS to our LC simulation and\npresent preliminary results for the EoR 21-cm signal.\n", "  Recently a certain $q$-Painlev\\'e type system has been obtained from a\nreduction of the $q$-Garnier system. In this paper it is shown that the\n$q$-Painlev\\'e type system is associated with another realization of the affine\nWeyl group symmetry of type $E_7^{(1)}$ and is different from the well-known\n$q$-Painlev\\'e system of type $E_7^{(1)}$ from the point of view of evolution\ndirections. We also study a connection between the $q$-Painlev\\'e type system\nand the $q$-Painlev\\'e system of type $E_7^{(1)}$. Furthermore determinant\nformulas of particular solutions for the $q$-Painlev\\'e type system are\nconstructed in terms of the terminating $q$-hypergeometric function.\n", "  Single-pixel imaging (SPI) is a novel technique capturing 2D images using a\nphotodiode, instead of conventional 2D array sensors. SPI owns high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, wide spectrum range, low cost, and robustness to light\nscattering. Various algorithms have been proposed for SPI reconstruction,\nincluding the linear correlation methods, the alternating projection method\n(AP), and the compressive sensing based methods. However, there has been no\ncomprehensive review discussing respective advantages, which is important for\nSPI's further applications and development. In this paper, we reviewed and\ncompared these algorithms in a unified reconstruction framework. Besides, we\nproposed two other SPI algorithms including a conjugate gradient descent based\nmethod (CGD) and a Poisson maximum likelihood based method. Both simulations\nand experiments validate the following conclusions: to obtain comparable\nreconstruction accuracy, the compressive sensing based total variation\nregularization method (TV) requires the least measurements and consumes the\nleast running time for small-scale reconstruction; the CGD and AP methods run\nfastest in large-scale cases; the TV and AP methods are the most robust to\nmeasurement noise. In a word, there are trade-offs between capture efficiency,\ncomputational complexity and robustness to noise among different SPI\nalgorithms. We have released our source code for non-commercial use.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to put on solid mathematical grounds the\nso-called Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) transport formalism for open\nsystems. In particular, we derive the Jauho-Meir-Wingreen formula for the\ntime-dependent current through an interacting sample coupled to non-interacting\nleads. Our proof is non-perturbative and uses neither complex-time Keldysh\ncontours, nor Langreth rules of 'analytic continuation'. We also discuss other\ntechnical identities (Langreth, Keldysh) involving various many body Green's\nfunctions. Finally, we study the Dyson equation for the advanced/retarded\ninteracting Green's function and we rigorously construct its (irreducible)\nself-energy, using the theory of Volterra operators.\n", "  Traffic dynamics on single or isolated complex networks has been extensively\nstudied in the past decade. Recently, several coupled network models have been\ndeveloped to describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In\na system of interconnected networks, the coupling links refer to the physical\nlinks between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. Thus, the\ncoupling pattern, i.e., the way coupling links are added, has a profound\ninfluence on the overall traffic performance. In this paper, we employ a\nsimulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the\ncoupling links, which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity\ncompared with random, assortative and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the optimal configuration of coupling links given by the SA\nalgorithm and develop a faster method to select the coupling links.\n", "  The conjugate gradient (CG) method, a standard and vital way of minimizing\nthe energy of a variational state, is applied to solve several problems in\nSkyrmion physics. The single-Skyrmion profile optimizing the energy of a\ntwo-dimensional chiral magnet is found without relying on specific boundary\nconditions. The two-dimensional Skyrmion lattice and three-dimensional hedgehog\ncrystal state is recovered with efficiency using the modified CG (p-GD) method.\nThe p-GD method is proposed as a complement to the traditional Monte Carlo\nannealing method, which still gives better results for the ground state but at\nthe far greater cost in computation time.\n", "  Many studies have shown that either the nearby astrophysical source or dark\nmatter (DM) annihilation/decay is required to explain the origin of high energy\ncosmic ray (CR) $e^\\pm$, which are measured by many experiments, such as PAMELA\nand AMS-02. Recently, the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) collaboration\nhas reported its first result of the total CR $e^\\pm$ spectrum from $25\n\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ to $4.6 \\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ with high precision. In this work, we\nstudy the DM annihilation and pulsar interpretations of the DAMPE high energy\n$e^\\pm$ spectrum. In the DM scenario, the leptonic annihilation channels to\n$\\tau^+\\tau^-$, $4\\mu$, $4\\tau$, and mixed charged lepton final states can well\nfit the DAMPE result, while the $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ channel has been excluded. In\naddition, we find that the mixed charged leptons channel would lead to a sharp\ndrop at $\\sim$ $\\mathrm{TeV}$. However, these DM explanations are almost\nexcluded by the observations of gamma-ray and CMB, unless some complicated DM\nmodels are introduced. In the pulsar scenario, we analyze 21 nearby known\npulsars and assume that one of them is the primary source of high energy CR\n$e^\\pm$.Considering the constraint from the Fermi-LAT observation of the\n$e^\\pm$ anisotropy, we find that two pulsars are possible to explain the DAMPE\ndata. Our results show that it is difficult to distinguish between the DM\nannihilation and single pulsar explanations of high energy $e^\\pm$ with the\ncurrent DAMPE result.\n", "  We study the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state\nof a mean-field-type non-stoquastic Hamiltonian by a semi-classical analysis.\nThe fully connected mean-field model with $p$-body ferromagnetic interactions\nunder a transverse field has a first-order quantum phase transition for $p\\ge\n3$. This first-order transition is known to be reduced to second order for\n$p\\ge 5$ by an introduction of antiferromagnetic transverse interactions, which\nmakes the Hamiltonian non-stoquastic. This reduction of the order of transition\nmeans an exponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic processes\nbecause the first-order transition is shown to have an exponentially small\nenergy gap whereas the second order case does not. We apply a semi-classical\nmethod to analytically derive the explicit expression of the rate of the\nexponential decay of the energy gap at first-order transitions. The result\nreveals how the property of first-order transition changes as a function of the\nsystem parameters. We also derive the exact closed-form expression for the\ncritical point where the first-order transition line disappears within the\nferromagnetic phase. These results help us understand how the antiferromagnetic\ntransverse interactions affect the performance of quantum annealing by\ncontrolling the effects of non-stoquasticity in the Hamiltonian.\n", "  Extending the notion of symmetry protected topological phases to insulating\nantiferromagnets (AFs) described in terms of opposite magnetic dipole moments\nassociated with the magnetic N$\\acute{{\\rm{e}}} $el order, we establish a\nbosonic counterpart of topological insulators in semiconductors. Making use of\nthe Aharonov-Casher effect, induced by electric field gradients, we propose a\nmagnonic analog of the quantum spin Hall effect (magnonic QSHE) for edge states\nthat carry helical magnons. We show that such up and down magnons form the same\nLandau levels and perform cyclotron motion with the same frequency but\npropagate in opposite direction. The insulating AF becomes characterized by a\ntopological ${\\mathbb{Z}}_{2}$ number consisting of the Chern integer\nassociated with each helical magnon edge state. Focusing on the topological\nHall phase for magnons, we study bulk magnon effects such as magnonic spin,\nthermal, Nernst, and Ettinghausen effects, as well as the thermomagnetic\nproperties of helical magnon transport both in topologically trivial and\nnontrivial bulk AFs and establish the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz law. We show\nthat our predictions are within experimental reach with current device and\nmeasurement techniques.\n", "  We determine the nucleon electromagnetic form factors and their uncertainties\nfrom world electron scattering data. The analysis incorporates two-photon\nexchange corrections, constraints on the low-Q2 and high-Q2 behavior, and\nadditional uncertainties to account for tensions between different data sets\nand uncertainties in radiative corrections.\n", "  To analyze dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images, various generic\nmultivariate data analysis techniques have been considered in the literature,\nsuch as principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis\n(ICA), factor analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF).\nNevertheless, these conventional approaches neglect any possible nonlinear\nvariations in the time activity curves describing the kinetic behavior of\ntissues with specific binding, which limits their ability to recover a\nreliable, understandable and interpretable description of the data. This paper\nproposes an alternative analysis paradigm that accounts for spatial\nfluctuations in the exchange rate of the tracer between a free compartment and\na specifically bound ligand compartment. The method relies on the concept of\nlinear unmixing, usually applied on the hyperspectral domain, which combines\nNMF with a sum-to-one constraint that ensures an exhaustive description of the\nmixtures. The spatial variability of the signature corresponding to the\nspecific binding tissue is explicitly modeled through a perturbed component.\nThe performance of the method is assessed on both synthetic and real data and\nis shown to compete favorably when compared to other conventional analysis\nmethods. The proposed method improved both factor estimation and proportions\nextraction for specific binding. Modeling the variability of the specific\nbinding factor has a strong potential impact for dynamic PET image analysis.\n", "  We revisit the flavor-changing processes involving an axion-like particle\n(ALP) in the context of generic ALP effective lagrangian with a discussion of\npossible UV completions providing the origin of the relevant bare ALP\ncouplings. We focus on the minimal scenario that ALP has flavor-conserving\ncouplings at tree level, and the leading flavor-changing couplings arise from\nthe loops involving the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model fermions. We\nnote that such radiatively generated flavor-changing ALP couplings can be\neasily suppressed in field theoretic ALP models with sensible UV completion. We\ndiscuss also the implication of our result for string theoretic ALP originating\nfrom higher-dimensional $p$-form gauge fields, for instance for ALP in large\nvolume string compactification scenario.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between disorder and superconducting pairing for\na one-dimensional $p$-wave superconductor subject to slowly varying\nincommensurate potentials with mobility edges. With amplitude increments of the\nincommensurate potentials, the system can undergo a transition from a\ntopological phase to a topologically trivial localized phase. Interestingly, we\nfind that there are four mobility edges in the spectrum when the strength of\nthe incommensurate potential is below a critical threshold, and a novel\ntopologically nontrivial localized phase emerges in a certain region. We reveal\nthis energy-dependent metal-insulator transition by applying several numerical\ndiagnostic techniques, including the inverse participation ratio, the density\nof states and the Lyapunov exponent. Nowadays, precise control of the\nbackground potential and the $p$-wave superfluid can be realized in the\nultracold atomic systems, we believe that these novel mobility edges can be\nobserved experimentally.\n", "  A consistent theory of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) includes two\nindispensable elements: (i) electronic response of the target system and (ii)\nquantum kinematics of probing electrons. While for the bulk materials and their\nsurfaces separating these two aspects and focusing on the former is the usual\nsatisfactory practice (the energy-loss functions formalism), we show that, for\nquasi-2D crystals, the interplay of the system's electronic response and the\ndetails of the probe's motion affects EEL spectra dramatically, and it must be\ntaken into account for the reliable interpretation of the experiment. To this\nend, we come up with a unified theory which, on the same footing, treats both\nthe long- and short-range scattering, within both the transmission and\nreflection experimental setups. Our calculations performed for graphene reveal\na phenomenon of a strong coupling between the $\\pi+\\sigma$ plasmon excitation\nand elastic {\\it scattering resonances}. Freed from the conventions of the\nenergy-loss functions formalism, our theory serves as a consistent and\nsystematic means of the understanding of the EELS of quasi-2D materials.\n", "  A model calculation of deuteron electrodisintegration is used to explore\nrenormalization group (RG) scale dependence for knock-out reactions. When\nevolved to different resolutions with the similarity RG (SRG), the initial\ndeuteron wave function, the current operator, and the final state interactions\n(FSI) are all modified, but how they combine depends strongly on the kinematic\nregion. In some regions, for example, the FSI are largely unaffected by\nevolution, while elsewhere FSI are greatly reduced. For certain kinematics, the\nimpulse approximation at a high RG resolution gives an intuitive picture in\nterms of a one-body current breaking up a short-range correlated neutron-proton\npair, although FSI distort this simple picture. With evolution to low\nresolution, however, the cross section is unchanged but a very different and\narguably simpler intuitive picture emerges, with the evolved current\nefficiently represented at low momentum through derivative expansions or\nlow-rank singular value decompositions. A consequence is that intuition about\nphysics such as the role of short-range correlations or $D$-state mixing in\nparticular kinematic regimes can be strongly scale dependent.\n", "  We investigate the first-order transition in the spin-1 two-dimensional\nBlume-Capel model in square lattices by revisiting the transfer-matrix method.\nWith large strip widths increased up to the size of 18 sites, we construct the\ndetailed phase coexistence curve which shows excellent quantitative agreement\nwith the recent advanced Monte Carlo results. In the deep first-order area, we\nobserve the exponential system-size scaling of the spectral gap of the transfer\nmatrix from which linearly increasing interfacial tension is deduced with\ndecreasing temperature. We find that the first-order signature at low\ntemperatures is strongly pronounced with much suppressed finite-size influence\nin the examined thermodynamic properties of entropy, non-zero spin population,\nand specific heat. It turns out that the jump at the transition becomes\nincreasingly sharp as it goes deep into the first-order area, which is in\ncontrast to the Wang-Landau results where finite-size smoothing gets more\nsevere at lower temperatures.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the expansion of tree level multitrace\nEinstein-Yang-Mills (EYM) amplitudes. First, we propose two types of recursive\nexpansions of tree level EYM amplitudes with an arbitrary number of gluons,\ngravitons and traces by those amplitudes with fewer traces or/and gravitons.\nThen we give many support evidence, including proofs using the Cachazo-He-Yuan\n(CHY) formula and Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursive relation. As a\nbyproduct, two types of generalized BCJ relations for multitrace EYM are\nfurther proposed, which will be useful in the BCFW proof. After one applies the\nrecursive expansions repeatedly, any multitrace EYM amplitudes can be given in\nthe Kleiss-Kuijf (KK) basis of tree level color ordered Yang-Mills (YM)\namplitudes. Thus the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) numerators, as the expansion\ncoefficients, for all multitrace EYM amplitudes are naturally constructed.\n", "  We report a systematic study of anisotropy resistivity, magnetoresistance and\nHall effect of Li0.32(NH3)yFe2Te1.2Se0.8 single crystals. When compared to the\nparent compound FeTe0.6Se0.4, the Li-NH3 intercalation not only increases the\nsuperconducting transition temperature, but also enhances the electronic\nanisotropy in both normal and superconducting states. Moreover, in contrast to\nthe parent compound, the Hall coefficient RH becomes negative at low\ntemperature, indicating electron-type carriers are dominant due to Li doping.\nOn the other hand, the sign reverse of RH at high temperature and the failure\nof scaling behavior of magnetoresistance imply that hole pockets may be still\ncrossing or just below the Fermi energy level, leading to the multiband\nbehavior in Li0.32(NH3)yFe2Te1.2Se0.8.\n", "  We have studied the dynamics of one and two laser-cooled trapped\n$^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions by applying electric fields of different nature along the\naxial direction of the trap, namely, driving the motion with a harmonic dipolar\nfield, or with white noise. These two types of driving induce distinct motional\nstates of the axial modes; a coherent oscillation with the dipolar field, or an\nenhanced Brownian motion due to an additional contribution to the heating rate\nfrom the electric noise. In both scenarios, the sensitivity of an isolated ion\nand a laser-cooled two-ion crystal has been evaluated and compared. The\nanalysis and understanding of this dynamics is important towards the\nimplementation of a novel Penning-trap mass-spectroscopy technique based on\noptical detection, aiming at improving precision and sensitivity.\n", "  We show how standard Newtonian N-body simulations can be interpreted in terms\nof the weak-field limit of general relativity by employing the recently\ndeveloped Newtonian motion gauge. Our framework allows the inclusion of\nradiation perturbations and the non-linear evolution of matter. We show how to\nconstruct the weak-field metric by combining Newtonian simulations with results\nfrom Einstein-Boltzmann codes. We discuss observational effects on weak lensing\nand ray tracing, identifying important relativistic corrections.\n", "  We consider optical media which feature antilinear symmetries. We show that:\n(i) spectral singularities of such media (if any) are always self-dual, i.e.,\ncorrespond to CPA-lasers; (ii) under the change of a system's parameter the\nself-dual spectral singularity may split into a pair of isolated complex\nconjugate eigenvalues, which corresponds to an unconventional and overlooked in\nthe most of previous studies scenario of the phase transition (known as\n$PT$-symmetry breaking in systems obeying parity-time symmetry); (iii) if the\nantilinear symmetry is local, i.e., does not involve any spatial reflection,\nthen no spectral singularity is possible. Our findings are illustrated with\nseveral examples including a $PT$-symmetric bilayer and other complex\npotentials discussed in recent literature.\n", "  We study the electrodynamics of a chiral medium with electric and magnetic\ncharges using the effective Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory extended to include the\nmagnetic current. The exchange of helicity between the chiral medium and the\nmagnetic field, known as the inverse cascade, is controlled by the chiral\nanomaly equation. In the presence of the magnetic current, the magnetic\nhelicity is dissipated, so that the inverse cascade stops when the magnetic\nhelicity vanishes while the chiral conductivity reaches a non-vanishing\nstationary value satisfying $\\sigma_\\chi^2< 4\\sigma_e\\sigma_m$, where\n$\\sigma_e$, $\\sigma_m$ and $\\sigma_\\chi$ are the electric, magnetic and chiral\nconductivities respectively. We argue that this state is superconducting and\nexhibits the Meissner effect for both electric and magnetic fields. Moreover,\nthis state is stable with respect to small magnetic helicity fluctuations; the\nmagnetic helicity becomes unstable only when the inequality mentioned above is\nviolated.\n", "  A search for the supersymmetric partners of the Standard Model bottom and top\nquarks is presented. The search uses 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data at\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Direct production of pairs of bottom and top squarks ($\\tilde{b}_{1}$\nand $\\tilde{t}_{1}$) is searched for in final states with $b$-tagged jets and\nmissing transverse momentum. Distinctive selections are defined with either no\ncharged leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state, or one charged lepton.\nThe zero-lepton selection targets models in which the $\\tilde{b}_{1}$ is the\nlightest squark and decays via $\\tilde{b}_{1} \\rightarrow b\n\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$, where $\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$ is the lightest neutralino.\nThe one-lepton final state targets models where bottom or top squarks are\nproduced and can decay into multiple channels, $\\tilde{b}_{1} \\rightarrow b\n\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and $\\tilde{b}_{1} \\rightarrow t \\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$,\nor $\\tilde{t}_{1} \\rightarrow t \\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}$ and $\\tilde{t}_{1}\n\\rightarrow b \\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$, where $\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}$ is the\nlightest chargino and the mass difference $m_{\\tilde{\\chi}^{\\pm}_{1}}-\nm_{\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}}$ is set to 1 GeV. No excess above the expected\nStandard Model background is observed. Exclusion limits at 95\\% confidence\nlevel on the mass of third-generation squarks are derived in various\nsupersymmetry-inspired simplified models.\n", "  We construct firstly the complete list of five quantum deformations of $D=4$\ncomplex homogeneous orthogonal Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})\\cong\n\\mathfrak{o}(3;\\mathbb{C})\\oplus \\mathfrak{o}(3;\\mathbb{C})$, describing\nquantum rotational symmetry of four-dimensional complex space-time, in\nparticular we provide the corresponding universal quantum $R$-matrices. Further\napplying four possible reality conditions we obtain all sixteen Hopf-algebraic\nquantum deformations for the real forms of $\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$:\nEuclidean $\\mathfrak{o}(4)$, Lorentz $\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$, Kleinian\n$\\mathfrak{o}(2,2)$ and quaternionic $\\mathfrak{o}^{\\star}(4)$. For\n$\\mathfrak{o}(3,1)$ we only recall well-known results obtained previously by\nthe authors, but for other real Lie algebras (Euclidean, Kleinian,\nquaternionic) as well as for the complex Lie algebra\n$\\mathfrak{o}(4;\\mathbb{C})$ we present new results.\n", "  We report a simple fiber-implemented technique for complete reconstruction of\nintensity profile and phase of ultrashort laser pulses based on processing only\npulse spectrum and two self-phase modulated spectra measured after a short\npiece of optical fiber. Its applicability is shown on an example of a fiber\noptical system in the telecommunication range. A retrieval algorithm in a\ndispersionless approximation and with considering dispersion effects is\ndeveloped. The obtained results are confirmed by independent measurements using\nthe second-harmonic generation frequency-resolved optical gating technique and\nby reconstructing purposely introduced signal features. We also provide\nestimates demonstrating great opportunities for implementing this technique in\nall-waveguide optical systems ranging from optical communications to\nnanophotonics with femtojoule pulses as well as to mid-IR photonics, where\nspecialty fibers with huge optical nonlinearities can be used.\n", "  We study the dynamics of perturbations representing deviations from perfect\nisotropy in the context of the emergent cosmology obtained from the group field\ntheory formalism for quantum gravity. Working in the mean field approximation\nof the group field theory formulation of the Lorentzian EPRL model, we derive\nthe equations of motion for such perturbations to first order. We then study\nthese equations around a specific simple isotropic background, characterised by\nthe fundamental representation of $\\mbox{SU(2)}$, and in the regime of the\neffective cosmological dynamics corresponding to the bouncing region replacing\nthe classical singularity, well approximated by the free GFT dynamics. In this\nparticular example, we identify a region in the parameter space of the model\nsuch that perturbations can be large at the bounce but become negligible away\nfrom it, i.e. when the background enters the non-linear regime. We also study\nthe departures from perfect isotropy by introducing specific quantities, such\nas the surface-area-to-volume ratio and the effective volume per quantum, which\nmake them quantitative.\n", "  We propose a light emitting device with voltage controlled degree of linear\npolarization of emission. The device combines the ability of metasurfaces to\ncontrol light with an energy-tunable light source based on indirect excitons in\ncoupled quantum well heterostructures.\n", "  Dynamic characterization of mechanical properties of dust aggregates has been\none of the most important problems to quantitatively discuss the dust growth in\nprotoplanetary disks. We experimentally investigate the dynamic properties of\ndust aggregates by low-speed ($\\lesssim 3.2$ m s$^{-1}$) impacts of solid\nprojectiles. Spherical impactors made of glass, steel, or lead are dropped onto\na dust aggregate of packing fraction $\\phi=0.35$ under vacuum conditions. The\nimpact results in cratering or fragmentation of the dust aggregate, depending\non the impact energy. The crater shape can be approximated by a spherical\nsegment and no ejecta are observed. To understand the underlying physics of\nimpacts into dust aggregates, the motion of the solid projectile is acquired by\na high-speed camera. Using the obtained position data of the impactor, we\nanalyze the drag-force law and dynamic pressure induced by the impact. We find\nthat there are two characteristic strengths. One is defined by the ratio\nbetween impact energy and crater volume and is $\\simeq 120$ kPa. The other\nstrength indicates the fragmentation threshold of dynamic pressure and is\n$\\simeq 10$ kPa. The former characterizes the apparent plastic deformation and\nis consistent with the drag force responsible for impactor deceleration. The\nlatter corresponds to the dynamic tensile strength to create cracks. Using\nthese results, a simple model for the compaction and fragmentation threshold of\ndust aggregates is proposed. In addition, the comparison of drag-force laws for\ndust aggregates and loose granular matter reveals the similarities and\ndifferences between the two materials.\n", "  Individual colloids often carry a charge as a result of the dissociation (or\nadsorption) of weakly-ionized surface groups. The magnitude depends on the\nprecise chemical environment surrounding a particle, which in a concentrated\ndispersion is a function of the colloid packing fraction $\\eta$. Theoretical\nstudies have suggested that the effective charge $Z_{\\rm{eff}}$ in regulated\nsystems could, in general, decrease with increasing $\\eta$. We test this\nhypothesis for nonpolar dispersions by determining $Z_{\\rm{eff}}(\\eta)$ over a\nwide range of packing fractions ($10^{-5} \\le \\eta \\le 0.3$) using a\ncombination of small-angle X-ray scattering and electrophoretic mobility\nmeasurements. We find a complex dependence of the particle charge as a function\nof the packing fraction, with $Z_{\\rm{eff}}$ initially decreasing at low\nconcentrations before finally increasing at high $\\eta$. We attribute the\nnon-monotonic density dependence to a crossover from concentration-independent\nscreening at low $\\eta$, to a high packing fraction regime in which counterions\noutnumber salt ions and electrostatic screening becomes $\\eta$-dependent. The\nefficiency of charge stabilization at high concentrations may explain the\nunusually high stability of concentrated nanoparticle dispersions which has\nbeen reported.\n", "  In a seminal paper, Alcubierre showed that Einstein's theory of general\nrelativity appears to allow a super-luminal motion. In the present study, we\nuse a recent eternal-warp-drive solution found by Alcubierre to study the\neffect of Hawking radiation upon an observer located within the warp drive in\nthe framework of the quantum tunneling method. We find the same expression for\nthe Hawking temperatures associated with the tunneling of both massive vector\nand scalar particles, and show this expression to be proportional to the\nvelocity of the warp drive. On the other hand, since the discovery of\ngravitational waves, the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes have also been\nextensively studied. With this puprpose in mind, we perform a QNM analysis of\nmassive scalar field perturbations in the background of the\neternal-Alcubierre-warp-drive (EAWD) spacetime. Our analytical analysis shows\nthat massive scalar perturbations lead to stable QNMs.\n", "  We produce synthetic spectra and observations for metal-free stellar\npopulations and high mass X-ray binaries in the Renaissance Simulations at a\nredshift of 15. We extend our methodology from the first paper in the series by\nmodelling the production and extinction of emission lines throughout a dusty\nand metal-enriched interstellar and circum-galactic media extracted from the\nsimulation, using a Monte Carlo calculation. To capture the impact of\nhigh-energy photons, we include all frequencies from hard X-ray to far infrared\nwith enough frequency resolution to discern line emission and absorption\nprofiles. The most common lines in our sample in order of their rate of\noccurrence are Ly$\\alpha$, the C IV $\\lambda\\lambda1548,1551$ doublet,\nH-$\\alpha$, and the Ca II $\\lambda\\lambda\\lambda8498,8542,8662$ triplet. The\nbest scenario for a direct observation of a metal-free stellar population is a\nmerger between two Population III galaxies. In mergers between metal-enriched\nand metal-free stellar populations, some characteristics may be inferred\nindirectly. Single Population III galaxies are too dim to be observed\nphotometrically at $z = 15$. Ly$\\alpha$ emission is discernible by $JWST$ as an\nincrease in $\\rm{J_{200w} - J_{277w}}$ colour off the intrinsic stellar tracks.\nObservations of metal-free stars will be difficult, though not impossible, with\nthe next generation of space telescopes.\n", "  Families of vector-like deformed relativistic quantum phase spaces and\ncorresponding realizations are analyzed. Method for general construction of\nstar product is presented. Corresponding twist, expressed in terms of phase\nspace coordinates, in Hopf algebroid sense is presented. General linear\nrealizations are considered and corresponding twists, in terms of momenta and\nPoincar\\'e-Weyl generators or $\\mathfrak{gl}(n)$ generators, are constructed\nand R-matrix is discussed. Classification of linear realizations leading to\nvector-like deformed phase spaces is given. There are 3 types of spaces: $i)$\ncommutative spaces, $ii)$ $\\kappa$-Minkowski spaces and $iii)$ $\\kappa$-Snyder\nspaces. Corresponding star products are $i)$ associative and commutative (but\nnon-local), $ii)$ associative and non-commutative and $iii)$ non-associative\nand non-commutative, respectively. Twisted symmetry algebras are considered.\nTransposed twists and left-right dual algebras are presented. Finally, some\nphysical applications are discussed.\n", "  A major part of the interactions involved in the assembly and stability of\nicosahedral, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) viruses is\nelectrostatic in nature, as can be inferred from the strong $pH$- and\nsalt-dependence of their assembly phase diagrams. Electrostatic interactions do\nnot act only between the capsid coat proteins (CPs), but just as often provide\na significant contribution to the interactions of the CPs with the genomic RNA,\nmediated to a large extent by positively charged, flexible N-terminal tails of\nthe CPs. In this work, we provide two clear and complementary definitions of an\nN-terminal tail of a protein, and use them to extract the tail sequences of a\nlarge number of CPs of ssRNA+ viruses. We examine the $pH$-dependent interplay\nof charge on both tails and CPs alike, and show that -- in contrast to the\ncharge on the CPs -- the net positive charge on the N-tails persists even to\nvery basic $pH$ values. In addition, we note a limit to the length of the\nwild-type genomes of those viruses which utilize positively charged tails, when\ncompared to viruses without charged tails and similar capsid size. At the same\ntime, we observe no clear connection between the charge on the N-tails and the\ngenome lengths of the viruses included in our study.\n", "  The local properties of the spin one ferromagnetic Blume-Capel model defined\non hierarchical lattices with dimension two and three are obtained by a\nnumerical recursion procedure and studied as functions of the temperature and\nthe reduced crystal-field parameter. The magnetization and the density of sites\nin the configuration S=0 state are carefully investigated at low temperature in\nthe region of the phase diagram that presents the phenomenon of phase\nreentrance. Both order parameters undergo transitions from the ferromagnetic to\nthe ordered paramagnetic phase with abrupt discontinuities that decrease along\nthe phase boundary at low temperatures. The distribution of magnetization in a\ntypical profile was determined on the transition line presenting a broad\nmultifractal spectrum that narrows towards the fractal limit (single point) as\nthe discontinuities of the order parameters grow towards a maximum. The\namplitude of the order-parameter discontinuities and the narrowing of the\nmultifractal spectra were used to delimit the low temperature interval for the\npossible locus of the tricritical point.\n", "  We study the quantum and classical evolution of a system of three harmonic\nmodes interacting via a trilinear Hamiltonian. With the modes prepared in\nthermal states of different temperatures, this model describes the working\nprinciple of an absorption refrigerator that transfers energy from a cold to a\nhot environment at the expense of free energy provided by a high-temperature\nwork reservoir. Inspired by a recent experimental realization with trapped\nions, we elucidate key features of the coupling Hamiltonian that are relevant\nfor the refrigerator performance. The coherent system dynamics exhibits rapid\neffective equilibration of the mode energies and correlations, as well as a\ntransient enhancement of the cooling performance at short times. We find that\nthese features can be fully reproduced in a classical framework.\n", "  In the presence of P-violating interactions, the exchange of vector bosons\nbetween electrons and nucleons induces parity-nonconserving (PNC) effects in\natoms and molecules, while the exchange of vector bosons between nucleons\ninduces anapole moments of nuclei. We perform calculations of such\nvector-mediated PNC effects in Cs, Ba$^+$, Yb, Tl, Fr and Ra$^+$ using the same\nrelativistic many-body approaches as in earlier calculations of standard-model\nPNC effects, but with the long-range operator of the weak interaction. We\ncalculate nuclear anapole moments due to vector boson exchange using a simple\nnuclear model. From measured and predicted (within the standard model) values\nfor the PNC amplitudes in Cs, Yb and Tl, as well as the nuclear anapole moment\nof $^{133}$Cs, we constrain the P-violating vector-pseudovector\nnucleon-electron and nucleon-proton interactions mediated by a generic vector\nboson of arbitrary mass. Our limits improve on existing bounds from other\nexperiments by many orders of magnitude over a very large range of vector-boson\nmasses.\n", "  If light new physics with lepton-flavor-violating couplings exists, the prime\ndiscovery channel might not be $\\ell\\to\\ell'\\gamma$ but rather $\\ell\\to\\ell'\nX$, where the new boson $X$ could be an axion, majoron, familon or Z' gauge\nboson. The most conservative bound then comes from $\\ell\\to\\ell'+\\mathrm{inv}$,\nbut if the on-shell $X$ can decay back into leptons or photons,\ndisplaced-vertex searches could give much better limits. We show that only a\nnarrow region in parameter space allows for displaced vertices in muon decays,\n$\\mu\\to e X, X\\to \\gamma\\gamma, ee$, whereas tauon decays can have much more\ninteresting signatures.\n", "  We study the characteristics of galaxy protoclusters using the latest\nL-galaxies semi-analytic model. Searching for protoclusters on a scale of $\\sim\n10 \\, \\mathrm{cMpc}$ gives an excellent compromise between the completeness and\npurity of their galaxy populations, leads to high distinction from the field in\noverdensity space, and allows accurate determination of the descendant cluster\nmass. This scale is valid over a range of redshifts and selection criteria. We\npresent a procedure for estimating, given a measured galaxy overdensity, the\nprotocluster probability and its descendant cluster mass for a range of\nmodelling assumptions, particularly taking into account the shape of the\nmeasurement aperture. This procedure produces lower protocluster probabilities\ncompared to previous estimates using fixed size apertures. The relationship\nbetween AGN and protoclusters is also investigated, and shows significant\nevolution with redshift; at $z \\sim 2$ the fraction of protoclusters traced by\nAGN is high, but the fraction of all AGN in protoclusters is low, whereas at $z\n\\geqslant 5$ the fraction of protoclusters containing AGN is low, but most AGN\nare in protoclusters. We also find indirect evidence for the emergence of a\npassive sequence in protoclusters at $z \\sim 2$, and note that a significant\nfraction of all galaxies reside in protoclusters at $z \\geqslant 2$,\nparticularly the most massive.\n", "  We introduce xCOLD GASS, a legacy survey providing a census of molecular gas\nin the local Universe. Building upon the original COLD GASS survey, we present\nhere the full sample of 532 galaxies with CO(1-0) measurements from the\nIRAM-30m telescope. The sample is mass-selected in the redshift interval\n$0.01<z<0.05$ from SDSS, and therefore representative of the local galaxy\npopulation with M$_{\\ast}>10^9$M$_{\\odot}$. The CO(1-0) flux measurements are\ncomplemented by observations of the CO(2-1) line with both the IRAM-30m and\nAPEX telescopes, HI observations from Arecibo, and photometry from SDSS, WISE\nand GALEX. Combining the IRAM and APEX data, we find that the CO(2-1) to\nCO(1-0) luminosity ratio for integrated measurements is $r_{21}=0.79\\pm0.03$,\nwith no systematic variations across the sample. The CO(1-0) luminosity\nfunction is constructed and best fit with a Schechter function with parameters\n{$L_{\\mathrm{CO}}^* = (7.77\\pm2.11) \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{K\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,\npc^{2}}$, $\\phi^{*} = (9.84\\pm5.41) \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ and\n$\\alpha = -1.19\\pm0.05$}. With the sample now complete down to stellar masses\nof $10^9$M$_{\\odot}$, we are able to extend our study of gas scaling relations\nand confirm that both molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale vary with\nspecific star formation rate (or offset from the star-formation main sequence)\nmuch more strongly than they depend on stellar mass. Comparing the xCOLD GASS\nresults with outputs from hydrodynamic and semi-analytic models, we highlight\nthe constraining power of cold gas scaling relations on models of galaxy\nformation.\n", "  We investigate under which conditions quantum nonlocal manifestations as\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering or Bell nonlocality can manifest themselves\neven at the macroscopic level of two mechanical resonators in optomechanical\nsystems. We adopt the powerful scheme of reservoir engineering, implemented by\ndriving a cavity mode with a properly chosen two-tone field, to prepare two\nmechanical oscillators into an entangled state. We show that large and robust\n(both one-way and two-way) steering could be achieved in the steady state with\nrealistic parameters. We analyze the mechanism of the asymmetric nature of\nsteering in our system of two-mode Gaussian state. However, unlike steering,\nBell nonlocality is present under much more stringent conditions. We consider\ntwo types of measurements, displaced parity and on-off detection, respectively.\nWe show that for both the measurements Bell violation requires very low\nenvironmental temperature. For the parity detection, large Bell violation is\nobserved only in the transient state when the mechanical modes decouple from\nthe optical mode and with extremely small cavity losses and mechanical damping.\nWhereas for the on-off detection, moderate Bell violation is found in the\nsteady state and robust against cavity losses and mechanical damping. Although\nBell violation with the parity detection seems extremely challenging to be\nexperimentally demonstrated, the conditions required for violating Bell\ninequalities with the on-off detection are much less demanding.\n", "  Measurable quantities that have positive values in classical dynamical\nsystems need not to be positive in quantum theory. For example, consider a free\nquantum mechanical particle in one dimension. There are quantum states in which\nthe particle's velocity is positive with probability 1, but where the\nprobability flux for its position is locally negative; that is, while its\nvelocity points to the right, the particle travels to the left. These effects\nare however small and limited in space and time by certain lower bounds, which\nare called \"quantum inequalities\". Similar effects also appear for a particle\nwhose motion is governed by a Schroedinger equation with a certain class of\npotentials.\n", "  The competition of the free spin state of a paramagnetic impurity on a\nsuperconductor with its screened counterpart is characterized by the energy\nscale of Kondo screening $k_BT_K$ compared to the superconducting pairing\nenergy $\\Delta$. When the experimental temperature suppresses Kondo screening,\nbut preserves superconductivity, i.e., when $\\Delta/k_B > T > T_K$, this\ndescription fails. Here, we explore this temperature range in a set of\nmanganese phthalocyanine molecules decorated with ammonia (MnPc-NH$_3$) on\nPb(111). We show that these molecules suffice the required energy conditions by\nexhibiting weak-coupling Kondo resonances. We correlate the energy of the\nYu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) bound states inside the superconducting energy gap with\nthe intensity of the Kondo resonance. We reveal that the bound state energy\nfollows the expectations for a classical spin on a superconductor. This finding\nis important in view of many theoretical predictions using a classical spin\nmodel, in particular for the description of Majorana bound states in magnetic\nnanostructures on superconducting substrates.\n", "  Non-classical quantum technologies that rely on manipulation of quantum\nstates and exploitation of quantum superposition and entanglement are\napproaching a level of maturity sufficient to contemplate commercialization as\nthe basis of practical devices for sensing, communications, navigation and\nother applications in the relatively near-term. However, realization of such\ntechnologies is dependent upon the development of appropriate Quantum Systems\nEngineering (QSE) approaches. It is clear that whilst traditional systems\nengineering will support much of the integration need, there are aspects\nassociated with system of interest definition, system modelling, and system\nverification where substantial advances in the systems engineering approach are\nrequired. This paper lays out in detail the challenges associated with Quantum\nEnabled Systems and Technologies (QEST) and analyses the adequacy of systems\nengineering processes and tools, as defined by the Systems and Software\nEngineering lifecycle standard (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288), to meet these challenges.\nThe conclusions of this paper provide an outline agenda for systems research in\norder to engineer QEST.\n", "  Simultaneous transport and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip magnetic imaging studies\nin Cr-(Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ modulation-doped films reveal the presence of\nsuperparamagnetic order within the quantum anomalous Hall regime. In contrast\nto the expectation that a long-range ferromagnetic order is required for\nestablishing the quantum anomalous Hall state, superparamagnetic dynamics of\nweakly interacting nanoscale magnetic islands is observed both in the plateau\ntransition regions as well as within the fully quantized C=$\\pm$1 Chern\nplateaus. Modulation doping of the topological insulator films is found to give\nrise to significantly larger superparamagnetic islands as compared to uniform\nmagnetic doping, evidently leading to enhanced robustness of the quantum\nanomalous Hall effect. Nonetheless, even in this more robust quantum state,\nattaining full quantization of transport coefficients requires magnetic\nalignment of at least 95% of the superparamagnetic islands. The\nsuperparamagnetic order is also found within the incipient C=0 zero Hall\nplateau, which may host an axion state if the top and bottom magnetic layers\nare magnetized in opposite directions. In this regime, however, a significantly\nlower level of island alignment is found in our samples, hindering the\nformation of the axion state. Comprehension and control of superparamagnetic\ndynamics is thus a key factor in apprehending the fragility of the quantum\nanomalous Hall state and in enhancing the endurance of the different quantized\nstates to higher temperatures for utilization of robust topological protection\nin novel devices.\n", "  In the widely-studied two-color laser scheme for terahertz (THz) radiation\nfrom a gas, the frequency ratio of the two lasers is usually fixed at\n$\\omega_2/\\omega_1=$1:2. We investigate THz generation with uncommon frequency\nratios. Our experiments show, for the first time, efficient THz generation with\nnew ratios of $\\omega_2/\\omega_1=$1:4 and 2:3. We observe that the THz\npolarization can be adjusted by rotating the longer-wavelength laser\npolarization and the polarization adjustment becomes inefficient by rotating\nthe other laser polarization; the THz energy shows similar scaling laws with\ndifferent frequency ratios. These observations are inconsistent with multi-wave\nmixing theory, but support the gas-ionization model. This study pushes the\ndevelopment of the two-color scheme and provides a new dimension to explore the\nlong-standing problem of the THz generation mechanism.\n", "  The tailoring of the physical properties of semiconductor nanomaterials by\nstrain has been gaining increasing attention over the last years for a wide\nrange of applications such as electronics, optoelectronics and photonics. The\nability to introduce deliberate strain fields with controlled magnitude and in\na reversible manner is essential for fundamental studies of novel materials and\nmay lead to the realization of advanced multi-functional devices. A prominent\napproach consists in the integration of active nanomaterials, in thin epitaxial\nfilms or embedded within carrier nanomembranes, onto\nPb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3-based piezoelectric actuators, which convert electrical\nsignals into mechanical deformation (strain). In this review, we mainly focus\non recent advances in strain-tunable properties of self-assembled InAs quantum\ndots embedded in semiconductor nanomembranes and photonic structures.\nAdditionally, recent works on other nanomaterials like rare-earth and metal-ion\ndoped thin films, graphene and MoS2 or WSe2 semiconductor two-dimensional\nmaterials are also reviewed. For the sake of completeness, a comprehensive\ncomparison between different procedures employed throughout the literature to\nfabricate such hybrid piezoelectric-semiconductor devices is presented. Very\nrecently, a novel class of micro-machined piezoelectric actuators have been\ndemonstrated for a full control of in-plane stress fields in nanomembranes,\nwhich enables producing energy-tunable sources of polarization-entangled\nphotons in arbitrary quantum dots. Future research directions and prospects are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We have investigated a brane world model in which the gravitational field in\nthe bulk is described both by a metric tensor and a minimally coupled scalar\nfield. This scalar field is taken to be a chameleon with an appropriate\npotential function. The scalar field interacts with matter and there is an\nenergy transfer between the two components. We find a late-time asymptotic\nsolution which exhibits late-time accelerating expansion. We also show that the\nUniverse recently crosses the phantom barrier without recourse to any exotic\nmatter. We provide some thermodynamic arguments which constrain both the\ndirection of energy transfer and dynamics of the extra dimension.\n", "  Quantum searching for one of $N$ marked items in an unsorted database of $n$\nitems is solved in $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n/N})$ steps using Grover's algorithm.\nUsing nonlinear quantum dynamics with a Gross-Pitaevskii type quadratic\nnonlinearity, Childs and Young discovered an unstructured quantum search\nalgorithm with a complexity $\\mathcal{O}( \\min \\{ 1/g \\, \\log (g n), \\sqrt{n}\n\\} ) $, which can be used to find a marked item after $o(\\log(n))$ repetitions,\nwhere $g$ is the nonlinearity strength [PhysRevA.93.022314]. In this work we\ndevelop a structured search on a complete graph using a time dependent\nnonlinearity which obtains one of the $N$ marked items with certainty. The\nprotocol has runtime $\\mathcal{O}((N^{\\perp} - N) / (G \\sqrt{N N^{\\perp}}) ) if\nN^{\\perp} > N$, where $N^{\\perp}$ denotes the number of unmarked items and $G$\nis related to the time dependent nonlinearity. If $N^{\\perp} \\leq N$, we obtain\na runtime $\\mathcal{O}( 1 )$. We also extend the analysis to a quantum search\non general symmetric graphs and can greatly simplify the resulting equations\nwhen the graph diameter is less than 5.\n", "  A method to evaluate the particle-phonon coupling (PC) corrections to the\nsingle-particle energies in semi-magic nuclei, based on a direct solving the\nDyson equation with PC corrected mass operator, is used for finding the\nodd-even mass difference between 18 even Pb isotopes and their odd-proton\nneighbors. The Fayans energy density functional (EDF) DF3-a is used which gives\nrather high accuracy of the predictions for these mass differences already on\nthe mean-field level, with the average deviation from the existing experimental\ndata equal to 0.389 MeV. It is only a bit worse than the corresponding value of\n0.333 MeV for the Skyrme EDF HFB-17 which belongs to a family of Skyrme EDFs\nwith the highest overall accuracy in describing the nuclear masses. Account for\nthe PC corrections induced by the low-laying phonons $2^+_1$ and $3^-_1$\nsignificantly diminishes the deviation of the theory from the data till 0.218\nMeV.\n", "  We report our independent GeV gamma-ray study of the young shell-type\nsupernova remnant (SNR) Kes 73 which harbors a central magnetar, and CO-line\nmillimeter observations toward the SNR. Using 7.6 years of Fermi-LAT\nobservation data, we detected an extended gamma-ray source (\"source A\") with\nthe centroid on the west of the SNR, with a significance of 21.6 sigma in\n0.1-300 GeV and an error circle of 5.4 arcminute in angular radius. The\ngamma-ray spectrum cannot be reproduced by a pure leptonic emission or a pure\nemission from the magnetar, and thus a hadronic emission component is needed.\nThe CO-line observations reveal a molecular cloud (MC) at V_LSR~90 km/s, which\ndemonstrates morphological correspondence with the western boundary of the SNR\nbrightened in multiwavelength. The 12CO (J=2-1)/12CO (J=1-0) ratio in the left\n(blue) wing 85-88 km/s is prominently elevated to ~1.1 along the northwestern\nboundary, providing kinematic evidence of the SNR-MC interaction. This SNR-MC\nassociation yields a kinematic distance 9 kpc to Kes 73. The MC is shown to be\ncapable of accounting for the hadronic gamma-ray emission component. The\ngamma-ray spectrum can be interpreted with a pure hadronic emission or a\nmagnetar+hadronic hybrid emission. In the case of pure hadronic emission, the\nspectral index of the protons is 2.4, very similar to that of the\nradio-emitting electrons, essentially consistent with the diffusive shock\nacceleration theory. In the case of magnetar+hadronic hybrid emission, a\nmagnetic field decay rate >= 10^36 erg/s is needed to power the magnetar's\ncurvature radiation.\n", "  In the deterministic realm, both differential equations and symmetry\ngenerators are geometrical objects, and behave properly under changes of\ncoordinates; actually this property is essential to make symmetry analysis\nindependent of the choice of coordinates and applicable. When trying to extend\nsymmetry analysis to stochastic (Ito) differential equations, we are faced with\na problem inherent to their very nature: they are not geometrical object, and\nthey behave in their own way (synthesized by the Ito formula) under changes of\ncoordinates. Thus it is not obvious that symmetries are preserved under a\nchange of coordinates. We will study when this is the case, and when it is not;\nthe conclusion is that this is always the case for so called \\emph{simple}\nsymmetries. We will also note that Kozlov theory relating symmetry and\nintegrability for stochastic differential equations is confirmed by our\nconsiderations and results, as symmetries of the type relevant in it are indeed\nof the type preserved under coordinate changes.\n", "  We have developed a prototype hexagonal light concentrator for the\nLarge-Sized Telescopes of the Cherenkov Telescope Array. To maximize the\nphotodetection efficiency of the focal-plane camera pixels for atmospheric\nCherenkov photons and to lower the energy threshold, a specular film with a\nvery high reflectance of 92-99% has been developed to cover the inner surfaces\nof the light concentrators. The prototype has a relative anode sensitivity\n(which can be roughly regarded as collection efficiency) of about 95 to 105% at\nthe most important angles of incidence. The design, simulation, production\nprocedure, and performance measurements of the light-concentrator prototype are\nreported.\n", "  Analysis of directed flow ($v_1$) of protons, antiprotons and pions in\nheavy-ion collisions is performed in the range of collision energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.7--39 GeV. Simulations have been done within a three-fluid\nmodel employing a purely hadronic equation of state (EoS) and two versions of\nthe EoS with deconfinement transitions: a first-order phase transition and a\nsmooth crossover transition. The crossover EoS is unambiguously preferable for\nthe description of experimental data at lower collision energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\leq$ 20 GeV. However, at higher collision energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\geq$ 20 GeV the purely hadronic EoS again becomes advantageous.\nThis indicates that the deconfinement EoS in the quark-gluon sector should be\nstiffer at high baryon densities than those used in the calculation. The latter\nfinding is in agreement with that discussed in astrophysics in connection with\nexistence of hybrid stars with masses up to about two solar masses.\n", "  We present a numerical model and a set of conservative algorithms for\nNon-Maxwellian plasma kinetics with inelastic collisions. These algorithms\nself-consistently solve for the time evolution of an isotropic electron energy\ndistribution function interacting with an atomic state distribution function of\nan arbitrary number of levels through collisional excitation, deexcitation, as\nwell as ionization and recombination. Electron-electron collisions, responsible\nfor thermalization of the electron distribution, are also included in the\nmodel. The proposed algorithms guarantee mass/charge and energy conservation in\na single step, and is applied to the case of non-uniform gridding of the energy\naxis in the phase space of the electron distribution function. Numerical test\ncases are shown to demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its conservation\nproperties.\n", "  The density profiles and corresponding order parameters of the hard\nellipsoids confined between two hard walls and also in contact with a single\nhard wall are studied using the density functional theory. The Hyper-Netted\nChain (HNC) approximation is used to write excess grand potential of the system\nwith respect to the bulk value. To simplify the calculations we use restricted\norientation model (ROM) for the orientation of ellipsoids to find the density\nprofiles and order parameters. Density functional theory shows that there is a\nuniaxial-biaxial phase transition near a single hard wall and also between two\nhard walls for a fluid consisting of uniaxial hard ellipsoidal particles with\nfinite elongation.\n", "  The Alice far-ultraviolet imaging spectrograph onboard Rosetta observed\nemissions from atomic and molecular species from within the coma of comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko during the entire escort phase of the mission from\n2014 August to 2016 September. The initial observations showed that emissions\nof atomic hydrogen and oxygen close to the surface were produced by energetic\nelectron impact dissociation of H2O. Following delivery of the lander, Philae,\non 2014 November 12, the trajectory of Rosetta shifted to near-terminator\norbits that allowed for these emissions to be observed against the shadowed\nnucleus that, together with the compositional heterogeneity, enabled us to\nidentify unique spectral signatures of dissociative electron impact excitation\nof H2O, CO2, and O2. CO emissions were found to be due to both electron and\nphotoexcitation processes. Thus we are able, from far-ultraviolet spectroscopy,\nto qualitatively study the evolution of the primary molecular constituents of\nthe gaseous coma from start to finish of the escort phase. Our results show\nasymmetric outgassing of H2O and CO2 about perihelion, H2O dominant before and\nCO2 dominant after, consistent with the results from both the in situ and other\nremote sensing instruments on Rosetta.\n", "  Three-wave instability is a fundamental process that has important\napplications in many branches of physics. It is widely accepted that the\nresonant condition $\\omega_{z}\\approx\\omega_{x}+\\omega_{y}$ for participating\nwaves is the criteria for the onset of the instability. We show that this\ncondition is neither sufficient nor necessary, instead, the exact criteria for\nthe onset of the instability is that a positive-action mode resonates with a\nnegative-action mode. This mechanism is imposed by the topology and geometry of\nthe spectral space. Guided by this new theory, additional instability bands\npreviously unknown are discovered.\n", "  We present results from extensive Monte Carlo simulations of polymer models\nwhere each lattice site can be visited by up to $K$ monomers and no restriction\nis imposed on the number of bonds on each lattice edge. These \\textit{multiple\nmonomer per site} (MMS) models are investigated on the square and cubic\nlattices, for $K=2$ and $K=3$, by associating Boltzmann weights $\\omega_0=1$,\n$\\omega_1=e^{\\beta_1}$ and $\\omega_2=e^{\\beta_2}$ to sites visited by 1, 2 and\n3 monomers, respectively. Two versions of the MMS models are considered for\nwhich immediate reversals of the walks are allowed (RA) or forbidden (RF). In\ncontrast to previous simulations of these models, we find the same\nthermodynamic behavior for both RA and RF versions. In three-dimensions, the\nphase diagrams - in space $\\beta_2 \\times \\beta_1$ - are featured by coil and\nglobule phases separated by a line of $\\Theta$ points, as thoroughly\ndemonstrated by the metric $\\nu_t$, crossover $\\phi_t$ and entropic $\\gamma_t$\nexponents. The existence of the $\\Theta$-lines is also confirmed by the second\nvirial coefficient. This shows that no discontinuous collapse transition exists\nin these models, in contrast to previous claims based on a weak bimodality\nobserved in some distributions, which indeed exists in a narrow region very\nclose to the $\\Theta$-line when $\\beta_1 < 0$. Interestingly, in\ntwo-dimensions, only a crossover is found between the coil and globule phases.\n", "  We show that in 3-3-1 models the existence of a Landau-like pole in the\ncoupling constant related to the $U(1)_X$ factor, $g_X$, in a certain value of\n$\\sin^2\\theta_W $, arises only assuming that the condition to match the gauge\ncoupling constants of the standard model, $g_{2L}$, with that of the 3-3-1\nmodel, $g_{3L}$, is valid for all energies. However, if we impose that this\nmatching condition is valid only at a given energy, say $\\mu = M_Z$, the pole\narises when $\\sin^2\\theta_X(\\mu_{LP})=1$, which is the only weak mixing angle\nin the models. The value of $\\mu_{LP} $ depends on the energy scales, $\\mu_m$\nand $\\mu_{331}$, in which the matching and the 3-3-1 symmetry is fully\nrealized, respectively. We also show that $g_{2L} $ and $g_{3L} $ have\ndifferent running with energy. Therefore, differently from what is usually\nassumed in the literature, these couplings can not be considered equal for all\nenergies. As a consequence, the fermion couplings with neutral vector bosons\nare different if we write them in terms of $\\sin\\theta_X$ instead of\n$\\sin\\theta_W $.\n", "  We report on the X-ray and optical properties of two high-mass X-ray binary\nsystems located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Based on the obtained\noptical spectra, we classify the massive companion as a supergiant star in both\nsystems. Timing analysis of the X-ray events collected by XMM-Newton revealed\nthe presence of coherent pulsations (spin period $\\sim$2013 s) for XMMU\nJ053108.3-690923 and fast flaring behaviour for XMMU J053320.8-684122. The\nX-ray spectra of both systems can be modelled sufficiently well by an absorbed\npower-law, yielding hard spectra and high intrinsic absorption from the\nenvironment of the systems. Due to their combined X-ray and optical properties\nwe classify both systems as SgXRBs: the 19$^{\\rm th}$ confirmed X-ray pulsar\nand a probable supergiant fast X-ray transient in the LMC, the second such\ncandidate outside our Galaxy.\n", "  We present high-precision photometry of eight separate transit events in the\nHAT-P-32 planetary system. One transit event was observed simultaneously by two\ntelescopes of which one obtained a simultaneous multi-band light curve in three\noptical bands, giving a total of 11 transit light curves. Due to the filter\nselection and in conjunction with using the defocussed photometry technique we\nwere able to obtain an extremely high precision, ground-based transit in the\n\\textit{u}-band (350\\,nm), with an rms scatter of $\\approx 1$\\,mmag. All 11\ntransits were modelled using \\textsc{prism} and \\textsc{gemc}, and the physical\nproperties of the system calculated. We find the mass and radius of the host\nstar to be $1.182\\pm 0.041\\Msun$ and $1.225\\pm0.015\\Rsun$, respectively. For\nthe planet we find a mass of $0.80\\pm 0.14\\Mjup$, a radius of\n$1.807\\pm0.022\\Rjup$ and a density of $0.126\\pm0.023\\pjup$. These values are\nconsistent with those found in the literature. We also obtain a new orbital\nephemeris for the system $ T_0 = {\\rm BJD/TDB} \\,\\, 2\\,454\\,420.447187 (96) \\,\n+ \\,2.15000800 (10) \\times E $. We measured the transmission spectrum of\nHAT-P-32\\,A\\,b and compared it to theoretical transmission spectra. Our results\nindicate a bimodal cloud particle distribution consisting of Rayleigh--like\nhaze and grey absorbing cloud particles within the atmosphere of\nHAT-P-32\\,A\\,b.\n", "  This article reviews the status of the field of dark matter as of summer\n2017, when it was discussed at 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC\n2017) in Busan, Korea. It is the write-up of a rapporteur talk on the status of\ndark matter searches given at the conference.\n", "  In this review the quenching of the weak axial-vector coupling strength,\n$g_{\\rm A}$, is discussed in nuclear $\\beta$ and double-$\\beta$ decays. On one\nhand, the nuclear-medium and nuclear many-body effects are separated, and on\nthe other hand the quenching is discussed from the points of view of different\nmany-body methods and different $\\beta$-decay and double-$\\beta$-decay\nprocesses. Both the historical background and the present status are reviewed\nand contrasted against each other. The theoretical considerations are tied to\nperformed and planned measurements, and possible new measurements are urged,\nwhenever relevant and doable. Relation of the quenching problem to the\nmeasurements of charge-exchange reactions and muon-capture rates is pointed\nout.\n", "  The connection between multiparton interaction, diffractive processes and\nsaturation effects is discussed. The relation of the rise of the gluon density\nat small longitudinal momentum fractions x with the occurrence of saturation,\ndiffraction and multiparton interaction is being studied both experimentally\nand theoretically. We illustrate key ideas underlying recent progress, and\nstress the role of different theoretical approaches to small-x QCD evolution in\ninvestigations of multiparton interactions.\n", "  We consider the problem of detecting a deformation from a symmetric Gaussian\nrandom $p$-tensor $(p\\geq 3)$ with a rank-one spike sampled from the Rademacher\nprior. Recently in Lesieur et al. (2017), it was proved that there exists a\ncritical threshold $\\beta_p$ so that when the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds\n$\\beta_p$, one can distinguish the spiked and unspiked tensors and weakly\nrecover the prior via the minimal mean-square-error method. On the other side,\nPerry, Wein, and Bandeira (2017) proved that there exists a $\\beta_p'<\\beta_p$\nsuch that any statistical hypothesis test can not distinguish these two\ntensors, in the sense that their total variation distance asymptotically\nvanishes, when the signa-to-noise ratio is less than $\\beta_p'$. In this work,\nwe show that $\\beta_p$ is indeed the critical threshold that strictly separates\nthe distinguishability and indistinguishability between the two tensors under\nthe total variation distance. Our approach is based on a subtle analysis of the\nhigh temperature behavior of the pure $p$-spin model with Ising spin, arising\ninitially from the field of spin glasses. In particular, we identify the\nsignal-to-noise criticality $\\beta_p$ as the critical temperature,\ndistinguishing the high and low temperature behavior, of the Ising pure\n$p$-spin mean-field spin glass model.\n", "  We present the differences between Input-Output formalism (IOF) and\nIncoherent Pumping Mechanism (IPM) derived from Lindblad Master Equation\napproach in terms of the transmission spectrum of Coupled high-Q Cavity with\nQuantum Dot system in the strong coupling regime. Fullwidth- half-maximum\n(FWHM) and the peak transmission of Dipole Induced Transparency (DIT) are\ninquired for detailed comparison in on-resonant and off-resonant conditions. We\nhave found that DIT phenomenon in off-resonant case cannot be explained\nentirely by IPM although both methods can exhibit the same Vacuum Rabi\nsplitting in on-resonant case. We have concluded that polariton having\natomic-like feature in transmission spectrum could not be captured completely\nby IPM.\n", "  The relationship between the populations of optically and X-ray selected\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) has been unclear due to divergent results from\ndifferent studies. Arnold et al. (2009) claim that X-ray AGN are almost\nentirely disjoint from optical AGN, while the Swift-BAT 70-month hard X-ray\nsurvey reported that 553 of their 711 X-ray AGN are optical. In this work, we\nset out to understand this difference by cross-checking between these studies\nand examining their sampling and AGN-selection criteria. We also re-analyze the\nX-ray and optical AGN in 16 groups and clusters reported by Arnold et al. using\nour own optical spectrum fitting techniques. We find that 6 of the 8 X-ray AGN\nin the Arnold et al. sample are also optical AGN, contrary to Arnold et al.'s\nreport that only 1 of the 8 X-ray AGN is also an optical AGN, thereby falsifies\ntheir conclusion that optical and X-ray AGN are nearly disjoint sets.\n", "  This work is a pioneering study of backward-angle omega cross sections\nthrough the exclusive 1H(e,e'p)omega reaction using the missing mass\nreconstruction technique. The extracted cross sections are separated into the\ntransverse (T), longitudinal (L), and LT, TT interference terms. The analyzed\ndata were part of experiment E01-004 (Fpi-2), which used 2.6-5.2GeV electron\nbeams and HMS+SOS spectrometers in Jefferson Lab Hall C. The primary objective\nwas to detect coincidence pion in the forward-angle, where the backward-angle\nomega events were fortuitously detected. The experiment has central Q2 values\nof 1.60 and 2.45GeV2, at W=2.21GeV. There was significant coverage in phi and\nepsilon, which allowed separation of sigma_T,L,LT,TT. The data set has a unique\nu coverage of -u~0, which corresponds to -t>4GeV2.\n  The separated sigma_T result suggest a flat ~1/Q^(1.33+/-1.21) dependence,\nwhereas sigma_L seems to hold a stronger 1/Q^(9.43+/-6.28) dependence. The\nsigma_L/sigma_T ratio indicate sigma_T dominance at Q2=2.45 GeV2 at the ~90%\nconfidence level. After translating the results into the -t space of the\npublished CLAS data, our data show evidence of a backward-angle omega\nelectroproduction peak at both Q2 settings. Previously, this phenomenon showing\nboth forward and backward-angle peaks was only observed in the meson\nphotoproduction data. Through comparison of our sigma_T data with the\nprediction of the Transition Distribution Amplitude (TDA) model, and signs of\nsigma_T dominance, promising indications of the applicability of the TDA\nfactorization are demonstrated at a much lower Q2 value than its preferred\nrange of Q2>10GeV2. These studies have opened a new means to study the\ntransition of the nucleon wavefunction through backward-angle experimental\nobservables.\n", "  We consider a constrained hierarchical opinion dynamics in the case of\nleaders' competition and with complete information among leaders. Each leaders'\ngroup tries to drive the followers' opinion towards a desired state accordingly\nto a specific strategy. By using the Boltzmann-type control approach we analyze\nthe best-reply strategy for each leaders' population. Derivation of the\ncorresponding Fokker-Planck model permits to investigate the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the solution. Heterogeneous followers populations are then\nconsidered where the effect of knowledge impacts the leaders' credibility and\nmodifies the outcome of the leaders' competition.\n", "  We list 4d interacting $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT with minimal flavor central\ncharge from the theory space constructed using 6d $(2,0)$ theory. For $ADE$ and\n$C_N$ flavor groups, our theory saturates the bound found using bootstrap\nmethod, but other cases have higher values. We find interesting rank one SCFTs\nwith $B_3, G_2, F_4, C_4\\times U(1), C_1\\times U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Many\nphysical properties of these theories are also studied.\n", "  Measuring the eye's mechanical properties in vivo and with minimally invasive\ntechniques can be the key for individualized solutions to a number of eye\npathologies. The development of such techniques largely relies on a\ncomputational modelling of the eyeball and, it optimally requires the synergic\ninterplay between experimentation and numerical simulation. In Astrophysics and\nGeophysics the remote measurement of structural properties of the systems of\ntheir realm is performed on the basis of (helio-)seismic techniques. As a\nbiomechanical system, the eyeball possesses normal vibrational modes\nencompassing rich information about its structure and mechanical properties.\nHowever, the integral analysis of the eyeball vibrational modes has not been\nperformed yet. Here we develop a new finite difference method to compute both\nthe spheroidal and, specially, the toroidal eigenfrequencies of the human eye.\nUsing this numerical model, we show that the vibrational eigenfrequencies of\nthe human eye fall in the interval 100 Hz - 10 MHz. We find that compressible\nvibrational modes may release a trace on high frequency changes of the\nintraocular pressure, while incompressible normal modes could be registered\nanalyzing the scattering pattern that the motions of the vitreous humour leave\non the retina. Existing contact lenses with embebed devices operating at high\nsampling frequency could be used to register the microfluctuations of the\neyeball shape we obtain. We advance that an inverse problem to obtain the\nmechanical properties of a given eye (e.g., Young's modulus, Poisson ratio)\nmeasuring its normal frequencies is doable. These measurements can be done\nusing non-invasive techniques, opening very interesting perspectives to\nestimate the mechanical properties of eyes in vivo. Future research might\nrelate various ocular pathologies with anomalies in measured vibrational\nfrequencies of the eye.\n", "  An orbital angular momentum (OAM) detection approach at microwave band is\nproposed. A transmittance function is exploited to model a transmissive\nmetasurface. Then the metasurface is designed to convert an OAM wave to\nmultiple waves, only one of which is gaussian. The radiation direction of the\ngaussian wave is distinguishable according to the order of incident OAM.\nConsequently, by locating the gaussian wave, the incident OAM can be\nconveniently determined. We use a simple field source to simulate the incident\nOAM wave in fullwave simulation. It largely simplifies the simulation process\nwhen an incident wave carrying OAM is needed. Both numerical and full-wave\nsimulation results are provided to validate our design and they show a good\nagreement with each other. Then, the metasurface is optimized for high\ndirectivity. Our work can provide an efficient and effective way for OAM\ndetection in radio communications.\n", "  This work explores a nontrivial temperature behavior of the carriers\nconcentration, which governs graphene channel conductance in the nano-structure\n\"graphene channel on ferroelectric substrate\" that is a basic element for FETs\nin non-volatile memory units of new generation. We revealed the transition from\na single to double antiferroelectric-like hysteresis loop of the concentration\nvoltage dependence that happens with the temperature increase and then exist in\na wide temperature range (from 350 to 500 K). Unexpectedly we revealed the\ndouble loops of polarization and concentration can have irregular shape that\nremains irregular as long as the computation takes place, and the voltage\nposition of the different features (jumps, secondary maxima, etc.) changes from\none period to another, leading to the impression of quasi-chaotic behavior. It\nappeared that these effects originate from the nonlinear screening of\nferroelectric polarization by graphene carriers, as well as it is conditioned\nby the temperature evolution of the domain structure kinetics in ferroelectric\nsubstrate. The nonlinearity rules the voltage behavior of polarization\nscreening by graphene 2D-layer and at the same time induces the motion of\nseparated domain walls accompanied by the motion of p-n junction along the\ngraphene channel (2D-analog of Hann effect). Since the domain walls structure,\nperiod and kinetics can be controlled by varying the temperature, we concluded\nthat the considered nano-structures based on graphene-on-ferroelectric are\npromising for the fabrication of new generation of modulators based on the\ngraphene p-n junctions.\n", "  We introduce a class of bipartite operators acting on $\\mathcal{H} \\otimes\n\\mathcal{H}$ ($\\mathcal{H}$ being an $n$-dimensional Hilbert space) defined by\na set of $n$ Completely Different Permutations CDP. Bipartite operators are of\nparticular importance in quantum information theory to represent states and\nobservables of composite quantum systems. It turns out that any set of CDPs\ngives rise to a certain direct sum decomposition of the total Hilbert space\nwhich enables one simple construction of the corresponding bipartite operator.\nInterestingly, if set of CDPs defines an abelian group then the corresponding\nbipartite operator displays an additional property -- the partially transposed\noperator again corresponds to (in general different) set of CDPs. Therefore,\nour technique may be used to construct new classes of so called PPT states\nwhich are of great importance for quantum information. Using well known\nrelation between bipartite operators and linear maps one use also construct\nlinear maps related to CDPs.\n", "  An analytical solution to the problem of formation and propagation of large\namplitude shock electromagnetic waves in strip transmission line (TL) based on\nthe distributed semiconductor diode was obtained. This solution correctly takes\ninto account non-linearity, time dispersion and dissipation of TL. The results\nof the theory has been used to estimate the parameters of TL as peaker of the\nhigh voltage pulse applied to transmission line input.\n", "  We investigate the dynamic mechanisms for low frequency fluctuations in\nsemiconductor lasers subject to delayed optical feedback, using the\nLang-Kobayashi model. This system of delay differential equations displays\npronounced envelope dynamics, ranging from erratic, so called low frequency\nfluctuations to regular pulse packages, if the time scales of fast oscillations\nand envelope dynamics are well separated. We investigate the parameter regions\nwhere low frequency fluctuations occur and compute their Lyapunov spectrum.\nUsing geometric singular perturbation theory, we study this intermittent\nchaotic behavior and characterize these solutions as bursting slow-fast\noscillations.\n", "  Rogue waves, and their periodic counterparts, have been shown to exist in a\nnumber of integrable models. However, relatively little is known about the\nexistence of these objects in models where an exact formula is unattainable. In\nthis work, we develop a novel numerical perspective towards identifying such\nstates as localized solutions in space-time. Importantly, we illustrate that\nthis methodology in addition to benchmarking known solutions (and confirming\ntheir numerical propagation under controllable error) enables the continuation\nof such solutions over parametric variations to non-integrable models. As a\nresult, we can answer in the positive the question about the parametric\nrobustness of Peregrine-like waveforms and even of generalizations thereof on a\ncnoidal wave background.\n", "  We have carried out axisymmetric numerical simulations of a spatially\ndeveloping hypersonic boundary layer over a sharp 7$^{\\circ{}}$-half-angle cone\nat $M_\\infty=7.5$ inspired by the experimental investigations by Wagner (2015).\nSimulations are first performed with impermeable (or solid) walls with a\none-time broadband pulse excitation applied upstream to determine the most\nconvectively-amplified frequencies resulting in the range 260kHz -- 400kHz,\nconsistent with experimental observations of second-mode instability waves.\nSubsequently, we introduce harmonic disturbances via continuous periodic\nsuction and blowing at 270kHz and 350kHz. For each of these forcing frequencies\ncomplex impedance boundary conditions (IBC), modeling the acoustic response of\ntwo different carbon/carbon (C/C) ultrasonically absorptive porous surfaces,\nare applied at the wall. The IBCs are derived as an output of a pore-scale\naeroacoustic analysis -- the inverse Helmholtz Solver (iHS) -- which is able to\nreturn the broadband real and imaginary components of the surface-averaged\nimpedance. The introduction of the IBCs in all cases leads to a significant\nattenuation of the harmonically-forced second-mode wave. In particular, we\nobserve a higher attenuation rate of the introduced waves with frequency of\n350kHz in comparison with 270kHz, and, along with the iHS impedance results, we\nestablish that the C/C surfaces absorb acoustic energy more effectively at\nhigher frequencies.\n", "  We study optimally doped\nBi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$Ca$_{0.92}$Y$_{0.08}$Cu$_{2}$O$_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi2212) using\nangle-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. Three spectral features\nare resolved near 1.5, 2.7, and 3.6 eV above the Fermi level. By tuning the\nphoton energy, we determine that the 2.7-eV feature arises predominantly from\nunoccupied states. The 1.5- and 3.6-eV features reflect unoccupied states whose\nspectral intensities are strongly modulated by the corresponding occupied\nstates. These unoccupied states are consistent with the prediction from a\ncluster perturbation theory based on the single-band Hubbard model. Through\nthis comparison, a Coulomb interaction strength U of 2.7 eV is extracted. Our\nstudy complements equilibrium photoemission spectroscopy and provides a direct\nspectroscopic measurement of the unoccupied states in cuprates. The determined\nCoulomb U indicates that the charge-transfer gap of optimally doped Bi2212 is\n1.1 eV.\n", "  The one- plus two-body isospin nonconserving nuclear interactions are\nincluded in the prediction of ground state energies of fp shell nuclei using\nspectral distribution theory. This in turn is used to calculate the linear term\nin the isobaric mass-multiplet equation and the predictions are then compared\nto experimental values after the addition of the Coulomb contribution. The\nagreement is found to be reasonable as observed for sd shell nuclei earlier.\nOne also sees that in this method the contribution to the linear term comes\nalmost completely from the one body isovector Hamiltonian and that results in a\nhuge simplification of the problem.\n", "  Metacomposites are a type of engineering composite materials with\nmetamaterial properties. We propose a design of hybrid filler consisting of\nferromagnetic microwire and carbon nanotube to enable a tunable microwire\nmetacomposite. There shows a sophisticated dependency of plasma frequency and\nbandwidth of double negative region on the carbon nanotube coating. Factors\nsuch as coating thickness, uniformity, morphology and number of microwires\nconspire to the formulation of the double negative characteristics. The\nintricate role of CNT on modulating negative {\\epsilon} and {\\mu} is elucidated\nby the plasma frequency formula and split-close paths model based on the\nlayer-like structure of CNT coating.\n", "  We formulate mimetic theory in f(T) teleparallel gravity where T is torsion\nscalar. It is shown that the construction of the mimetic theory in the\nteleparallel gravity requires the vierbeins to be left unchanged and the\nconfomal transformation performed on the Minkowski metric of the tangent space.\nIt is further argued that the conformal degree of freedom in this teleparallel\nmimetic theory becomes dynamical and mimics the behavior of cold dark matter.\nWe also show that it is possible to employ the Lagrange multipliers method to\nformulate the mimetic theory in an f(T) theory without any auxiliary metric.\nThe mimetic f(T) theory is examined by the method of dynamical system and it is\nfound that there are five fixed points representing inflation, radiation,\nmatter, mimetic dark matter and dark energy dominated eras in the theory if\nsome conditions are satisfied. We examined the power-law model and its phase\ntrajectories with these conditions.\n", "  We have revisited the ultraviolet and optical spectra of the blue horizontal\nbranch star Feige 86. The new analysis finds the star cooler and more compact\nthan previously determined. The IUE spectrum of Feige 86 holds numerous\nunidentified spectral lines of heavy metals, indicating efficient atomic\ndiffusion in the atmosphere. Because diffusion plays a key role in the\natmospheres of hot subdwarfs as well, it is indispensable to a better\nunderstanding of subdwarf pulsations and evolution. Feige 86 looks like an\nideal target to confront diffusion theory with observations and test\nspectroscopic techniques. Therefore, to advance our general understanding of\ndiffusion in stellar atmospheres we urge for new ultraviolet spectroscopy of\nFeige 86 at the highest possible resolution with HST/STIS.\n", "  The paper explains why an ontology of permanent point particles that are\nindividuated by their relative positions and that move on continuous\ntrajectories as given by a deterministic law of motion constitutes the best\nsolution to the measurement problem in both quantum mechanics and quantum field\ntheory. This case is made by comparing the Bohmian theory to collapse theories\nsuch as the GRW matter density and the GRW flash theory. It is argued that the\nBohmian theory makes the minimal changes, concerning only the dynamics and\nneither the ontology nor the account of probabilities, that are necessary to\nget from classical mechanics to quantum physics. There is no cogent reason to\ngo beyond these minimal changes.\n", "  Heparins are are sulfated polysaccharides that have tremendous clinical\nimportance as anticoagulant drugs. Monitoring of heparin blood levels can\nimprove patient safety. In clinical practice, heparins are monitored indirectly\nby their inhibtory effect on coagulation proteases. Drawbacks of these\nestablished methods have stimulated the development of simple direct detection\nmethods with cationic dyes that change absorbance or fluorescence upon binding\nof polyanionic heparin. Very few such dyes or assay kits, however, are\ncommercially and widely available to a broad community of researchers and\nclinicians. This study compares the performance of three commercial dyes for\nthe direct quantification of unfractionated heparin and the widely used\nlow-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin. Two traditional metachromatic dyes,\nAzure A and Toluidine Blue, and the more recently developed fluorescent dye\nHeparin Red were applied in a mix-and-read microplate assay to the same\nheparin-spiked human plasma samples. In the clinically most relevant\nconcentration range below 1 IU (international units) per mL, only Heparin Red\nis a useful tool for the determination of both heparins. Heparin Red is at\nleast 9 times more sensitive than the metachromatic dyes which can not reliably\nquantify the heparins in this concentration range. Unfractionated heparin\nlevels between 2 and 10 IU per mL can be determined by all dyes, Heparin Red\nbeing the most sensitive.\n", "  We investigate the deformation and failure mechanisms of phosphorene sheet\nand nanoribbons under uniaxial tensile strain along the zigzag direction using\nthe density functional tight-binding method. Surprisingly, twin-like\ndeformation occurs homogenously across the phosphorene sheet, which\nsignificantly increases its failure strain. Vacancies within the sheet lead to\nthe heterogeneous nucleation of twins at a lower critical strain which,\nsubsequently, propagate across the entire sheet. Twin-like deformation always\noccurs heterogeneously in phosphorene nanoribbons (with or without vacancies).\nPropagation of the twins is interrupted by fracture which initiates along the\nribbon edge. The underlying mechanism is bond breaking between the atoms within\nphosphorene puckers and simultaneous bond formation between the atoms in\nneighboring puckers. This unusual deformation behavior in phosphorene may be\nexploited in novel nano-electronic-mechanical applications.\n", "  We propose to use a soft/hard exchange-spring coupling bilayer magnetic\nstructure to introduce a narrow channel for spin-wave propagation. We show by\nmicromagnetic simulations that broad-band Damon-Eshbach geometry spin waves can\nbe strongly localized into the channel and propagate effectively with a proper\nhigh group velocity. The beamwidth of the bound mode spin waves is almost\nindependent from the frequency and is smaller than 24nm. For a low-frequency\nexcitation, we further investigate the appearance of two other spin beams in\nthe lateral of the channel. In contrast to a domain wall, the channel formed by\nexchange-spring coupling can be easier to realize in experimental scenarios and\nholds stronger immunity to surroundings. This work is expected to open new\npossibilities for energy-efficient spin-wave guiding as well as to help shape\nthe field of beam magnonics.\n", "  This paper provides a characterization for the set of antidegradable qubit\nchannels. The characterization arises from the correspondence between the\nantidegradability of a channel and the symmetric extendibility of its Choi\noperator. Using an inequality derived to describe the set of bipartite qubit\nstates which admit symmetric extension, we are able to characterize the set of\nall antidegradable qubit channels. Using the characterization we investigate\nthe antidegradability of unital qubit channels and arbitrary qubit channels\nwith respect to the dimension of the environment. We additionally provide a\ncondition which describes qubit channels which are simultaneously degradable\nand antidegradable along with a classification of self-complementary qubit\nchannels.\n", "  The magnetic field of molecular clouds (MCs) plays an important role in the\nprocess of star formation: it determins the statistical properties of\nsupersonic turbulence that controls the fragmentation of MCs, controls the\nangular momentum transport during the protostellar collapse, and affects the\nstability of circumstellar disks. In this work, we focus on the problem of the\ndetermination of the magnetic field strength. We review the idea that the MC\nturbulence is super-Alfv\\'{e}nic, and we argue that MCs are bound to be born\nsuper-Alfv\\'{e}nic. We show that this scenario is supported by results from a\nrecent simulation of supernova-driven turbulence on a scale of 250 pc, where\nthe turbulent cascade is resolved on a wide range of scales, including the\ninterior of MCs.\n", "  In this work we study the non-equilibrium Markov state evolution for a\nspatial population model on the space of locally finite configurations\n$\\Gamma^2 = \\Gamma^+ \\times \\Gamma^-$ over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ where particles are\nmarked by spins $\\pm$. Particles of type '+' reproduce themselves independently\nof each other and, moreover, die due to competition either among particles of\nthe same type or particles of different type. Particles of type '-' evolve\naccording to a non-equilibrium Glauber-type dynamics with activity $z$ and\npotential $\\psi$. Let $L^S$ be the Markov operator for '+' -particles and $L^E$\nthe Markov operator for '-' -particles. The non-equilibrium state evolution\n$(\\mu_t^{\\varepsilon})_{t \\geq 0}$ is obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation\nwith Markov operator $L^S + \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}L^E$, $\\varepsilon > 0$, which\nitself is studied in terms of correlation function evolution on a suitable\nchosen scale of Banach spaces. We prove that in the limiting regime\n$\\varepsilon \\to 0$ the state evolution $\\mu_t^{\\varepsilon}$ converges weakly\nto some state evolution $\\overline{\\mu}_t$ associated to the Fokker-Planck\nequation with (heuristic) Markov operator obtained from $L^S$ by averaging the\ninteractions of the system with the environment with respect to the unique\ninvariant Gibbs measure of the environment.\n", "  In heavy quarkonia, hadronic transitions serve as an enlightened probe for\nthe structure and help to establish the understanding of light quark coupling\nwith a heavy degree of freedom. Moreover, in recent years, hadronic transitions\nrevealed remarkable discoveries to identify the new conventional heavy\nquarkonia and extracting useful information about the so called \"XYZ\" exotic\nstates. In this contribution, we present our predictions for heavy quark spin\nsymmetry (HQSS) breaking hadronic transitions of higher $S$ and $D$ wave vector\ncharmonia based on our recently proposed model (inspired by Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\n(NJL) model) to create light meson(s) in heavy quarkonium transitions. We also\nsuggest spectroscopic quantum numbers $(^{2S+1}L_J)$ for several observed\ncharmoniumlike states. Our analysis indicates that the $Y(4360)$ is most likely\nto be a $3D$ dominant state.\n", "  PbSe-doped silicate glasses were studied through wide-angle X-ray diffraction\n(WXRD) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). PbSe nanoparticles in the\nglasses were produced due to the secondary heat treatment at different\ntemperatures and their appearance was established by WXRD, SANS, and TEM\ntechniques with the results for particle sizes in accordance to our recent\noptical studies of this material. The simulation of SANS measurements revealed\nnew structural features of the PbSe nanoparticles. They form fractal aggregates\nas several overlapping spheres up to ~30 nm in full size.\n", "  We predict the dynamics and shapes of nanobubbles growing in a supersaturated\nsolution confined within a tapered, Hele-Shaw device with a small opening angle\n$\\Phi \\ll 1$. Our study is inspired by experimental observations of the growth\nand translation of nanoscale bubbles, ranging in diameter from tens to hundreds\nof nanometers, carried out with liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy.\nIn our experiments, the electron beam plays a dual role: it supersaturates the\nsolution with gaseous radiolysis products, which lead to bubble nucleation and\ngrowth, and it provides a means to image the bubbles in-situ with nanoscale\nresolution. To understand our experimental data, we propose a migration\nmechanism, based on Blake-Haynes theory, which is applicable in the asymptotic\nlimits of zero capillary and Bond numbers and high confinement. Consistent with\nexperimental data, our model predicts that in the presence of confinement,\ngrowth rates are orders of magnitude slower compared to a bubble growing in the\nbulk and that the combination of a tapered channel and contact line pinning\ncreate tear-drop shaped bubbles.\n", "  It is well known that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics presents a clear\nasymmetry between space and time. Much of this asymmetry is attributed to the\nlack of Lorentz invariance of the theory. Nonetheless, a recent work [Phys.\nRev. A \\textbf{95}, 032133 (2017)] showed that even though this is partially\ntrue, there is a broader physical scenario in which space and time can be\nhandled in nonrelativistic quantum theory in a more symmetric way. In this\nspace-time-symmetric formalism, an additional Hilbert space is defined so that\ntime is raised to the status of operator and position becomes a parameter. As a\nconsequence, the Hilbert space now requires a space-conditional quantum state\ngoverned by a new quantum dynamics. In this manuscript, we reveal some physical\nand mathematical properties of the space-time-symmetric formalism such as:\nsymmetries between the Hamilton-Jacobi and the space-conditional equation; the\ngeneral solution for a time-independent potential; and a new Lagrangian for a\nspinless particle in one dimensional. Finally, we present the space-conditional\nequation for a particle under the effect of an electromagnetic field, and the\ngauge invariance of this equation is proved.\n", "  The Majorana Demonstrator is an experiment constructed to search for\nneutrinoless double-beta decays in germanium-76 and to demonstrate the\nfeasibility to deploy a ton-scale experiment in a phased and modular fashion.\nIt consists of two modular arrays of natural and 76Ge-enriched germanium p-type\npoint contact detectors totaling 44.1 kg, located at the 4850 level of the\nSanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, USA. The\nDemonstrator uses custom high voltage cables to bias the detectors, as well as\ncustom signal cables and connectors to read out the charge deposited at the\npoint contact of each detector. These low-mass cables and connectors must meet\nstringent radiopurity requirements while being subjected to thermal and\nmechanical stress. A number of issues have been identified with the currently\ninstalled cables and connectors. An improved set of cables and connectors for\nthe Majorana Demonstrator are being developed with the aim of increasing their\noverall reliability and connectivity. We will discuss some of the issues\nencountered with the current cables and connectors as well as our improved\ndesigns and their initial performance.\n", "  Surface stress, which is always neglected in classical elastic theories, has\nrecently emerged as a key role in the mechanics of highly deformable soft\nsolids. In this paper, the effect of surface stress on the deformation and\ninstability of soft hollow cylinder are analyzed. By incorporating surface\nenergy density function into the constitutive model of a hyper-elastic theory,\nexplicit solutions are obtained for the deformation of soft hollow cylinder\nunder the conditions of uniform pressure loading and geometric everting. It is\nfound that surface tension evidently alters the deformation of the soft\ncylinder. Specifically, the surface stiffness resists the deformation, but the\nresidual surface stress is inclined to larger deformation. Effects of surface\nstress on the instability of the soft hollow cylinder is also explored. For\nboth the pressure loading and geometric everting conditions, significant\nchanges in critical condition of the creases are found by varying the surface\nparameter. The results in this work reveal that surface energy obviously\ninfluences both the deformation and the instability of soft hollow cylinder at\nfinite deformation. The obtained results will be helpful for understanding and\npredicting the mechanical behavior of soft structures accurately.\n", "  Our goal in this paper is to present a generalization of the spectral zeta\nregularization for general Feynman amplitudes. Our method uses complex powers\nof elliptic operators but involves several complex parameters in the spirit of\nthe analytic renormalization by Speer, to build mathematical foundations for\nthe renormalization of perturbative interacting quantum field theories. Our\nmain result shows that spectrally regularized Feynman amplitudes admit an\nanalytic continuation as meromorphic germs with linear poles in the sense of\nthe works of Guo-Paycha and the second author. We also give an explicit\ndetermination of the affine hyperplanes supporting the poles. Our proof relies\non suitable resolution of singularities of products of heat kernels to make\nthem smooth.\n  As an application of the analytic continuation result, we use a universal\nprojection from meromorphic germs with linear poles on holomorphic germs to\nconstruct renormalization maps which subtract singularities of Feynman\namplitudes of Euclidean fields. Our renormalization maps are shown to satisfy\nconsistency conditions previously introduced in the work of\nNikolov-Todorov-Stora in the case of flat space-times.\n", "  Over the past few decades, researchers have developed several approaches such\nas the Reference Phantom Method (RPM) to estimate ultrasound attenuation\ncoefficient (AC) and backscatter coefficient (BSC). AC and BSC can help to\ndiscriminate pathology from normal tissue during in-vivo imaging. In this\npaper, we propose a new RPM model to simultaneously compute AC and BSC for\nharmonic imaging and a normalized score that combines the two parameters as a\nmeasure of disease progression. The model utilizes the spectral difference\nbetween two regions of interest, the first, a proximal, close to the probe and\nsecond, a distal, away from the probe. We have implemented an algorithm based\non the model and shown that it provides accurate and stable estimates to within\n5% of AC and BSC for simulated received echo from post-focal depths of a\nhomogeneous liver-like medium. For practical applications with time gain and\ntime frequency compensated in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data from ultrasound\nscanner, the method has been approximated and generalized to estimate AC and\nBSC for tissue layer underlying a more attenuative subcutaneous layer. The\nangular spectrum approach for ultrasound propagation in biological tissue is\nemployed as a virtual Reference Phantom (VRP). The VRP is calibrated with a\nfixed probe and scanning protocol for application to liver tissue. In a\nfeasibility study with 16 subjects, the method is able to separate 9/11 cases\nof progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from 5 normal. In particular,\nit is able to separate 4/5 cases of non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis and early\nfibrosis (F<=2) from normal tissue. More extensive clinical studies are needed\nto assess the full capability of this model for screening and monitoring\ndisease progression in liver and other tissues.\n", "  BRITE-Constellation has observed the exoplanet host star $\\beta$ Pictoris for\n225 days from November 2016 to June 2017. These data allow for an accurate\ndescription of the pulsational properties and an asteroseismic interpretation.\nThey were also observed as part of an international observing campaign which\naims to detect the transit of $\\beta$ Pictoris b's Hill sphere and study the\ncircumstellar disk around $\\beta$ Pictoris itself.\n", "  Pain perception, trunk mobility in flexion, extension, and lateral flexion,\nand apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) within nucleus pulposus of all lumbar\ndiscs were collected before and after posterior-to-anterior mobilization in 16\nadults with acute low back pain. ADC was computed from diffusion maps and 3\nspecific portions of the nucleus pulposus were investigated: anterior (ADCant\n), middle (ADCmid), and posterior (ADCpost ), and their mean as ADCall , a\nsummary measure of ADC within nucleus pulposus. Pain ratings were significantly\nreduced after mobilization, and mobility of the trunk was significantly\nincreased. Concomitantly, a significant increase in ADCall values was observed.\nThe greatest ADCall changes were observed at the L3-L4 and L4-L5 levels and\nwere mainly explained by changes in ADCant and ADCpost . The simultaneous\nreduction in pain and increase of water diffusion within nucleus pulposus has\nhas been previously observed in subjects with chronic conditions and exists in\nthe acute phase of the disease. Since the largest changes in ADC were observed\nat the periphery of the nucleus pulposus, and taken together with pain\ndecrease, our results suggest that increased peripheral random motion of water\nmolecules is implicated in the modulation of the intervertebral disc\nnociceptive response.\n", "  From 21 independent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements we obtain\nthe following sum of masses of active Dirac or Majorana neutrinos: $\\sum m_\\nu\n= 0.711 - 0.335 \\cdot \\delta h + 0.050 \\cdot \\delta b \\pm 0.063 \\textrm{ eV,}$\nwhere $\\delta h \\equiv (h - 0.678) / 0.009$ and $\\delta b \\equiv (\\Omega_b h^2\n- 0.02226) / 0.00023$. This result may be combined with independent\nmeasurements that constrain the parameters $\\sum m_\\nu$, $h$, and $\\Omega_b\nh^2$. For $\\delta h = \\pm 1$ and $\\delta b = \\pm 1$, we obtain $m_\\nu < 0.43$\neV at 95\\% confidence.\n", "  We observed the recently discovered eccentric eclipsing binary GSC\n04052-01378 in order to improve the light curve parameters and to find further\nevidence of its probable high eccentricity and of apsidal motion. Furthermore,\nwe propose a basic stellar model that fits very well the observations of our\ndataset and where the eccentricity is found to be e = 0.538(6), which\ncorresponds to an high value among this group of binaries.\n", "  Transmission through a quantum point contact (QPC) in the quantum Hall regime\nusually exhibits multiple resonances as a function of gate voltage and high\nnonlinearity in bias. Such behavior is unpredictable and changes sample by\nsample. Here, we report the observation of a sharp transition of the\ntransmission through an open QPC at finite bias, which was observed\nconsistently for all the tested QPCs. It is found that the bias dependence of\nthe transition can be fitted to the Fermi-Dirac distribution function through\nuniversal scaling. The fitted temperature matches quite nicely to the electron\ntemperature measured via shot-noise thermometry. While the origin of the\ntransition is unclear, we propose a phenomenological model based on our\nexperimental results that may help to understand such a sharp transition.\nSimilar transitions are observed in the fractional quantum Hall regime, and it\nis found that the temperature of the system can be measured by rescaling the\nquasiparticle energy with the effective charge ($e^*=e/3$). We believe that the\nobserved phenomena can be exploited as a tool for measuring the electron\ntemperature of the system and for studying the quasiparticle charges of the\nfractional quantum Hall states.\n", "  Generic quantum-circuit simulation appears intractable for conventional\ncomputers and may be unnecessary because useful quantum circuits exhibit\nsignificant structure that can be exploited during simulation. For example,\nGottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called stabilizer\ncircuits, which can be simulated efficiently using group-theory techniques and\ninsights from quantum physics. Realistic circuits enriched with quantum\nerror-correcting codes and fault-tolerant procedures are dominated by\nstabilizer subcircuits and contain a relatively small number of non-Clifford\ncomponents. Therefore, we develop new data structures and algorithms that\nfacilitate parallel simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more\ncompact storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated\nbookkeeping. Our implementation, called Quipu, simulates certain quantum\narithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial time\nand space for equal superpositions of $n$-qubits. On such instances, known\nlinear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the (state-of-the-art)\nBDD-based simulator QuIDDPro, take exponential time. We simulate quantum\nFourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant circuits using Quipu, and the\nresults demonstrate that our stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms\nQuIDDPro in all cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware\nsimulations of quantum circuits were difficult to parallelize, we demonstrate\nthat Quipu can be parallelized with a nontrivial computational speedup.\n", "  It is demonstrated that in fullerene C70 which can be considered as a\ndeformed fullerene C60 in some sense there is a withdrawal of an\nelectrodynamical forbiddance of a strong quadrupole light-molecule interaction\nwhich is realized in the fullerene C60. This situation occurs because of the\nreduction of symmetry of C60 from the icosahedral symmetry group Yh to the\ngroup D5h. The withdrawal results in appearance of the lines in the SERS\nspectra of C70 which are forbidden in usual Raman scattering and are allowed in\ninfrared absorption while such lines are forbidden in the SERS spectrum of the\nfullerene C60 due to the electrodynamical forbiddance. The measured SERS\nspectra of C70 demonstrates existence of such lines that strongly confirms our\nideas about the dipole quadrupole SERS mechanism.\n", "  We construct the differential operators for which bivariate Chebyshev\npolynomials of the first kind, associated with simple Lie algebras $C_2$ and\n$G_2$, are eigenfunctions.\n", "  The rapidly rotating primary component of Regulus A system has been observed,\nfor the first time, using the technique of differential interferometry at high\nspectral resolution. The observations have been performed across the\nBr$_\\gamma$ spectral line with the VLTI/AMBER focal instrument in high spectral\nresolution mode (R $\\approx$ 12000) at $\\approx$ 80-130m (projected on the sky)\nAuxiliary Telescopes triplet baseline configurations. We confirm, within the\nuncertainties, the results previously obtained using the techniques of\nclassical long-baseline interferometry, although the question of anomalous\ngravity darkening remains open for the future study.\n", "  Turbulence driven by small scale instabilities causes large heat and particle\ntransport and is a major limiting factor of current fusion devices. Above a\ncritical value, the ion temperature gradient leads to the growth of a\nmicroinstability -- the ion temperature gradient mode -- that often dominates\nthe ion energy transport. It has recently been discovered that energetic ions\ngenerated by auxiliary heating may reduce the growth of this instability. By\napplying the gyrokinetic formalism and performing linear simulations using the\nlocal continuum gyrokinetic code GS2, we explore the linear physics of this\nstabilising effect. In order to isolate important effects due to the presence\nof fast ions, we make use of the flexibility of GS2 to change the plasma and\nmagnetic geometry parameters independently. We assess the possibility to\nneglect magnetic geometry changes to simplify the analysis, by investigating\nits contribution to the stabilising effect. For the cases studied we find that\nthe Shafranov shift and safety factor profile might have to be taken into\naccount. For fixed fast ion density and temperature a destabilising influence\nof their density gradient is found, while the high fast ion temperature\ngradient is stabilising, both as predicted by theoretical models. A large part\nof the observed stabilisation comes from the fast ion contribution to the\nplasma $\\beta$. In addition, the effect of $\\beta$ is enhanced because of the\nlarge density and temperature gradients of the fast ions. We investigate the\nrole of hot ion mass and charge in order to evaluate the stabilisation of\ndifferent types of hot ions. Also the possibility of adjusting the electron and\nion profiles to account for the presence of fast ions without including them as\na kinetic species, is considered. Finally, quasi-linear theory is invoked for\nlinking linear results to saturated values of the nonlinear heat fluxes.\n", "  While solid-state materials are commonly classified as covalent, ionic, or\nmetallic, there are cases that defy these iconic bonding mechanisms. A\nprominent example is given by phase-change materials (PCMs) for data storage or\nphotonics, which have recently been argued to show 'resonant' bonding; a clear\ndefinition of this mechanism, however, has been lacking until the present day.\nHere we show that these solids are clearly different from resonant bonding in\nthe pi-orbital systems of benzene and graphene. Instead, they exhibit a unique\nmechanism between covalent and metallic bonding, which we call 'metavalent'\nbonding. The materials are on the verge of electron delocalization, which\nexplains their exceptional property portfolio, and we therefore argue that they\nrepresent 'incipient metals'. This yields deeper, fundamental insight into the\nbonding nature of solid-state materials, and is expected to accelerate the\ndiscovery and design of new functional materials including PCMs and\nthermoelectrics.\n", "  We consider the one-dimensional discrete linear Schr\u007fodinger (DLS) equation\nperturbed by a conservative stochastic dynamics, that changes the phase of each\nparticles, conserving the total norm (or number of particles). The resulting\ntotal dynamics is a degenerate hypoelliptic diffusion with a smooth stationary\nstate. We will show that the system has a hydrodynamical limit given by the\nsolution of the heat equation. When it is coupled at the boundaries to two\nLangevin thermostats at two different chemical potentials, we prove that the\nstationary state, in the limit as N ! 1, satisfies the Fourier's law.\n", "  We show that there is an inconsistency in the class of solutions obtained in\nPhys. Rev. D {\\bf 95}, 084037 (2017). This inconsistency is due to the\napproximate relation between lagrangian density and its derivative for\nNon-Linear Electrodynamics. We present an algorithm to obtain new classes of\nsolutions.\n", "  Using long-term gamma-ray spectroscopy with high resolution germanium\ndetectors and a ratio method, the half-lives of 101Rh and 108Agm have been\ndetermined to be 4.07 + 0.05 years and 448 + 27 years, respectively. These\nresults are compared with previously reported values.\n", "  In this paper, a fourth-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) is developed\nfor the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations under the framework of\ntwo-stage fourth-order temporal discretization and Hermite WENO (HWENO)\nreconstruction. Due to the high-order gas evolution model, the GKS provides a\ntime dependent gas distribution function at a cell interface. This time\nevolution solution can be used not only for the flux evaluation across a cell\ninterface and its time derivative, but also time accurate evolution solution at\na cell interface. As a result, besides updating the conservative flow variables\ninside each control volume, the GKS can get the cell averaged slopes inside\neach control volume as well through the differences of flow variables at the\ncell interfaces. So, with the updated flow variables and their slopes inside\neach cell, the HWENO reconstruction can be naturally implemented for the\ncompact high-order reconstruction at the beginning of next step. Therefore, a\ncompact higher-order GKS, such as the two-stages fourth-order compact scheme\ncan be constructed. This scheme is as robust as second-order one, but more\naccurate solution can be obtained. In comparison with compact fourth-order DG\nmethod, the current scheme has only two stages instead of four within each time\nstep for the fourth-order temporal accuracy, and the CFL number used here can\nbe on the order of $0.5$ instead of $0.11$ for the DG method. Through this\nresearch, it concludes that the use of high-order time evolution model rather\nthan the first order Riemann solution is extremely important for the design of\nrobust, accurate, and efficient higher-order schemes for the compressible\nflows.\n", "  The generation of quantum entangled states of many particles is a central\ngoal of quantum information science. Characterizing such states is a complex\ntask that demands exponentially large resources as particles are being added.\nPreviously, we demonstrated a resource efficient source that can generate, in\nprincipal, entanglement between any number of photons. This source recursively\nfuse photon pairs generated by a pulsed laser into a multiphoton entangled\nstate. In the current work, we perform quantum state tomography on the photon\npair source and quantum process tomography on the fusion operation. As a\nresult, the full quantum Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of any number\nof photons can be calculated. We explore the prospects of our scheme and\ncalculate nonlocality and genuine \\textit{N}-photon entanglement thresholds for\nstates with up to twelve photons.\n", "  Long-range correlation, a property of time series exhibiting long-term\nmemory, is mainly studied in the statistical physics domain and has been\nreported to exist in natural language. Using a state-of-the-art method for such\nanalysis, long-range correlation is first shown to occur in long CHILDES data\nsets. To understand why, Bayesian generative models of language, originally\nproposed in the cognitive scientific domain, are investigated. Among\nrepresentative models, the Simon model was found to exhibit surprisingly good\nlong-range correlation, but not the Pitman-Yor model. Since the Simon model is\nknown not to correctly reflect the vocabulary growth of natural language, a\nsimple new model is devised as a conjunct of the Simon and Pitman-Yor models,\nsuch that long-range correlation holds with a correct vocabulary growth rate.\nThe investigation overall suggests that uniform sampling is one cause of\nlong-range correlation and could thus have a relation with actual linguistic\nprocesses.\n", "  A formula of grain growth rate, based on a nonlinear capillarity-driven\nrelation, is derived to predict and interpret realistic growth processes in\npolycrystalline systems. The derived formula reveals how the growth and\nstagnation of grains dominated by the correlated parameters (temperature,\ninterfacial energy, step free energy, grain size and size distribution in\npolycrystalline system etc.). Our study provide a conclusive model of the\ngrowth and stagnation of grains, and thus offers helpful guides for the\nmicrostructural design to optimize the properties of polycrystalline materials.\n", "  The time varying currents in the Ohmic transformer in the SST-1 tokamak\ninduce voltages that drive large eddy currents in the passive structures like\nthe vacuum vessel and cryostat. Since the vacuum vessel and the cryostat are\ntoroidally continuous without electrical breaks in SST- 1, this leads to a\nshielding effect on the flux penetrating the vacuum vessel. This reduces the\nmagnitude of the loop voltage seen by the plasma as also delays its buildup.\nAlso the induced currents alter the null location of magnetic field. This will\nhave serious implications on the plasma breakdown and startup and corrective\nmeasures may be required in case of an insufficient loop voltage or an improper\nnull. Further, the eddy currents distribution will be vital for the plasma\nequilibrium and need to be considered while reconstructing the equilibrium.\nEvolution of the toroidal eddy currents in SST-1 passive structures has been\nstudied using a toroidal-filament model. The model calculations are compared\nwith the measured signals in the magnetic diagnostics like the toroidal flux\nloops and magnetic pick-up coils installed on the SST-1.\n", "  We provide the general solution of problems concerning AC star circuits by\nturning them into geometric problems. We show that one problem is strongly\nrelated to the Fermat-point of a triangle. We present a solution that is well\nadapted to the practical application the problem is based on. Furthermore, we\nsolve a generalization of the geometric situation and discuss the relation to\nnon-symmetric, unbalanced AC star circuits.\n", "  In this contribution we report on the perturbative determination of\n$\\beta$-functions and anomalous dimensions for the chiral Ising, chiral XY and\nchiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model around $D=4$ dimensions at four\nloops and the first Pad\\'e extrapolation of critical exponents at non-trivial,\ninfrared stable fixed points to $D=3$ to this order. This talk is based on Ref.\n[Zerf:2017zqi].\n", "  We present an efficient approach for simulating Coulomb systems confined by\nplanar polarizable surfaces. The method is based on the solution of Poisson\nequation using periodic Green functions. It is shown that the electrostatic\nenergy arising from surface polarization can be decoupled from the energy of\nperiodic replicas. This allows us to combine an efficient Ewald summation\nmethod for the replicas with the polarization contribution calculated using\nGreen function techniques. We apply the method to calculate density profiles of\nions confined between charged dielectric and metal interfaces.\n", "  We investigated the optimal spectral design of periodic structure of narrow\nlines (AFC-structure) within the inhomogeneously broadened atomic transition\nwhich are created for the implementation of broadband AFC photon echo quantum\nmemory.The influence of the spectral design on the suppression of negative\ndispersion effects in the AFC-echo retrieval was studied for different\nspectroscopic parameters of atomic media. The maps of the assigned spectral\nquantum efficiency have been constructed for the created AFC-structures\ncharacterized by different spectral design, finesse and optical depth. Based on\nthe performed analysis, we discuss the possible ways for experimental\nimplementation of highly efficient broadband AFC-protocol.\n", "  We study the two-body decays of the gluino at full one-loop level in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with quark-flavour violation (QFV) in the\nsquark sector. The renormalization is done in the DRbar scheme and hard gluon\nand photon radiations are included by adding the corresponding three-body decay\nwidths. In the numerics the dependence of the gluino decay widths on the QFV\nparameters is discussed with special emphasis put on the separation of the\nelectroweak and the SUSY QCD corrections. The main dependence stems from the\n$\\tilde c_R - \\tilde t_R$ mixing in the decays to up-type squarks because there\nhold strong constraints from B-physics on the other quark-flavour mixing\nparameters. Including the full one-loop corrections, the changes of the gluino\ndecay widths are mostly negative and of the order of about -10%. The QFV part\nstays small in the total width but can vary up to -8% for the decay width into\nthe lightest squark. For the corresponding branching ratio, however, the effect\nis smaller by at least a factor of two. The electroweak corrections can become\n35% of the SUSY QCD corrections.\n", "  A compact, single-etch silicon photonics waveguide crossing based on low\nquality factor cavity and optimized by a genetic algorithm is demonstrated. The\ndevice has 0.1~0.3 dB insertion loss and < -35 dB crosstalk per crossing for\nfundamental TE mode in the 1550-1600 nm wavelength band, with a footprint of 5\nx 5 {\\mu}m$^2$.\n", "  Ideally, the Statistical Hadronization Model (SHM) freeze-out curve should\nreveal the QCD parton-hadron phase transformation line in the ($T$,$\\mu_B$)\nplane. We discuss the effects of various final state interaction phenomena,\nlike baryon-antibaryon annihilation, core-corona effects or QCD critical point\nformation, which shift or deform the SHM freezeout curve. In particular, we\npresent a method to remove the annihilation effects by quantifying them with\nthe microscopic hadron transport model UrQMD. We further discuss the new\naspects of hadronization that could be associated with the relatively broad\ncross-over phase transformation as predicted by lattice-QCD theory at low\n$\\mu_B$. That opens up the possibility that various observables of\nhadronization, e.g. hadron formation or susceptibilities of higher order\n(related to grand canonical fluctuations of conserved hadronic charges) may\nfreeze out at different characteristic temperatures. This puts into question\nthe concept of a universal \\textit{(pseudo-)critical} temperature, as does the\nvery nature of a cross-over phase transformation.\n", "  It is known that convergence of l.s.b. closed symmetric sesquilinear forms\nimplies norm resolvent convergence of the associated self-adjoint operators and\nthis in turn convergence of discrete spectra. In this paper in both cases sharp\nestimates for the rate of convergence are derived. An algorithm for the\nnumerical computation of eigenvalues of generalized Schr\\\"{o}dinger operators\nin $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ is presented and illustrated by explicit examples; the\nmentioned general results on the rate of convergence are applied in order to\nobtain error estimates for these computations. An extension of the results to\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger operators on metric graphs is sketched.\n", "  The atomic scale insights into the interaction of water with oxide surface\nare essential for elucidating the mechanism of physiochemical processes in\nvarious scientific and practical fields, since the water is ubiquitous and\ncoats multifarious material surface under ambient conditions. By utilizing\nperiodic density functional theory calculations with van der Waals corrections,\nherein we report for the first time the energetically and thermodynamically\nfavorable homolytic dissociative adsorption behavior of water over magnesia\n(001) films deposited on metal substrate. The water adsorption on pristine\nmagnesia (001) is quite weak and the heterolytic dissociation is the only\nfragmentation pathway, which is highly endothermic with large activation\nbarrier of 1.167 eV. The binding strength for the molecular and dissociative\nadsorption configurations of water on hybrid MgO(001) films are significantly\nlarger than corresponding configurations on bare magnesia (001). The homolytic\ndissociative adsorption energy of water on monolayer oxide is calculated to be\n-1.192 eV, which is even larger than all the heterolytic dissociative\nadsorption states. With the increase of the oxide thickness, the homolytic\ndissociative adsorption energy decreases promptly, indicating the nanoscale of\noxide film play a crucial role in homolytic splitting of water. The homolytic\ndissociative adsorption structure could be obtained by transformation reaction\nfrom heterolytic dissociative adsorption structure, presenting activation\nbarriers 0.733, 1.103, 1.306, 1.571, and 1.849 eV for reactions on 1 ML to 5 ML\nfilms. It is anticipated that the results here could provide inspiring clue and\nversatile strategy for enhancing chemical reactivity and properties of\ninsulating oxide toward homolytic water splitting processes involved in novel\nand unprecedented applications.\n", "  Proofs of Bell-Kochen-Specker contextuality demonstrate that there exists\nsets of projectors that cannot each be assigned either 0 or 1 such that each\nbasis formed from them contains exactly one 1-assigned projector. Instead, at\nleast some of the projectors must have a valuation that depends on the\n\\emph{context} in which they are measured. This motivates the question of\n\\emph{how many} of the projectors must have contextual valuations. In this\npaper, we demonstrate a bound on what fraction of rank-1 projective\nmeasurements on a quantum system must be considered to have context-dependent\nvaluations as a function of the quantum dimension, and show that quantum\nmechanics is not as contextual, by this metric, as other possible physical\ntheories. Attempts to find quantum mechanical scenarios that yield a high value\nof this figure-of-merit can be thought of as generalisations or extensions of\nthe search for small Kochen-Specker sets. We also extend this result to\nprojector-valued-measures with projectors of arbitrary equal rank.\n", "  Production of deuterons by coalescence has an important influence on the\nmoments of the observed proton number distribution. Therefore, this effect must\nbe taken into account when physics conclusions about baryon number fluctuation\nare drawn from the measurement of proton number fluctuations. We also show that\na measurement of the third and fourth moments of the deuteron number\ndistribution would allow to distinguish whether deuterons are produced\nstatistically or by coalescence.\n", "  In the present paper we consider a discretization of hyperbolic systems of\nexponential type. We proved that, in the case of $2\\times 2$ systems, the\nresulting semi-discrete system is Darboux integrable only if it corresponds to\na Cartan matrix of a semi-simple Lie algebra.\n", "  Automatic source detection and classification tools based on machine learning\n(ML) algorithms are growing in popularity due to their efficiency when dealing\nwith large amounts of data simultaneously and their ability to work in\nmultidimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we present a new, automated\nmethod of outlier selection based on support vector machine (SVM) algorithm\ncalled one-class SVM (OCSVM), which uses the training data as one class to\nconstruct a model of 'normality' in order to recognize novel points. We test\nthe performance of OCSVM algorithm on \\textit{Wide-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE)} data trained on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) sources.\nAmong others, we find $\\sim 40,000$ sources with abnormal patterns which can be\nassociated with obscured and unobscured active galactic nuclei (AGN) source\ncandidates. We present the preliminary estimation of the clustering properties\nof these objects and find that the unobscured AGN candidates are preferentially\nfound in less massive dark matter haloes ($M_{DMH}\\sim10^{12.4}$) than the\nobscured candidates ($M_{DMH}\\sim 10^{13.2}$). This result contradicts the\nunification theory of AGN sources and indicates that the obscured and\nunobscured phases of AGN activity take place in different evolutionary paths\ndefined by different environments.\n", "  The goal of this dissertation is to investigate the PANS model capabilities\nin providing significant improvement over RANS predictions at slightly higher\ncomputational expense and producing LES quality results at significantly lower\ncomputational cost. The objectives of this study are: (i) investigate the model\nfidelity at a fixed level of scale resolution (Generation1-PANS/G1-PANS) for\nsmooth surface separation, (ii) Derive the PANS closure model in regions of\nresolution variation (Generation2-PANS/G2-PANS), and (iii) Validate G2-PANS\nmodel for attached and separated flows. The separated flows considered in this\nstudy have been designated as critical benchmark flows by NASA CFD study group.\n  The key contributions of this dissertation are summarized as follows. The\nturbulence closure model of varying resolution, G2-PANS, is developed by\nderiving mathematically-consistent commutation residues and using energy\nconservation principles. The log-layer recovery and accurate computation of\nReynolds stress anisotropy is accomplished by transitioning from steady RANS to\nscaled resolved simulations using the G2-PANS model. Finally, several\nsmooth-separation flows on the NASA turbulence website have been computed with\nhigh degree of accuracy at a significantly reduced computational effort over\nLES using the G1-PANS and G2-PANS models.\n", "  The author studies structure of space $\\mathbf{L}_{2}(G)$ of vectors -\nfunctions, which are integrable with a square of the module on the bounded\ndomain $G $of three-dimensional space with smooth boundary, and role of the\ngradient of divergence and curl operators in construction of bases in its\northogonal subspaces $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$. The ${\\mathcal{A}}$ and\n${\\mathcal{B}}$ are contain subspaces\n${\\mathcal{A}_{\\gamma}}(G)\\subset{\\mathcal{A}}$ and\n$\\mathbf{V}^{0}(G)\\subset{\\mathcal{B}}$. The gradient of divergence and a curl\noperators have continuations in these subspaces, their expansion\n$\\mathcal{N}_d$ and $S$ are selfadjoint and convertible,and their inverse\noperators $\\mathcal{N}_{d}^{-1}$ and $S^{-1}$ are compact. In each of these\nsubspaces we build ortonormal basis. Uniting these bases, we receive complete\nortonormal basis of whole space $\\mathbf{L}_{2}(G)$, made from eigenfunctions\nof the gradient of divergence and curl operators . In a case, when the domain\n$G$ is a ball $B$, basic functions are defined by elementary functions. The\nspaces $\\mathcal{A}^{s}_{\\mathcal{K}}(B)$ are defined. Is proved, that\ncondition $ \\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathcal{A}^{s}_{\\mathcal {K}}(B)$ is necessary and\nsufficient for convergence of its Fourier series (on eigenfunctions of a\ngradient of divergence)in norm of Sobolev space $ \\mathbf{H}^{s}(B)$. Using\nFourier series of functions $ \\mathbf{f}$ and $ \\mathbf{u}$, the author\ninvestigates solvability(in spaces $\\mathbf{H}^{s}(G)$)boundary value problem:\n$\\nabla\\mathbf{div}\\mathbf{u}+ \\lambda\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{f}$ in $G$,\n$\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}|_{\\Gamma}=g$ on boundary, under condition of\n$\\lambda\\neq0$. In a ball $B$ a boundary value problem:\n$\\nabla\\mathbf{div}\\mathbf{u}+ \\lambda\\mathbf{u}=\\mathbf{f}$ in $B$,\n$\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\mathbf{u}|_S=0$, is solved completely and for any $\\lambda$.\n", "  Advances in machine learning have led to an emergence of new paradigms in the\nanalysis of large data which could assist traditional approaches in the search\nfor new physics amongst the immense Standard Model backgrounds at the Large\nHadron Collider. Deep learning is one such paradigm. In this work, we first\nstudy feature importance ranking of signal-background classification features\nwith deep learning for two Beyond Standard Model benchmark cases: a multi-Higgs\nand a supersymmetry scenario. We find that the discovery reach for the\nmulti-Higgs scenario could still increase with additional features. In\naddition, we also present a deep learning-based approach to construct new\nfeatures to separate signals from backgrounds using the ATLAS detector as a\nspecific example. We show that the constructed feature is more effective in\nsignal-background separation than commonly used features, and thus is better\nfor physics searches in the detector. As a side application, the constructed\nfeature may be used to identify any momentum bias in a detector. We also\nutilize a convolutional neural network as part of the momentum bias checking\napproach.\n", "  Direct prediction of material properties from microstructures through\nstatistical models has shown to be a potential approach to accelerating\ncomputational material design with large design spaces. However, statistical\nmodeling of highly nonlinear mappings defined on high-dimensional\nmicrostructure spaces is known to be data-demanding. Thus, the added value of\nsuch predictive models diminishes in common cases where material samples (in\nforms of 2D or 3D microstructures) become costly to acquire either\nexperimentally or computationally. To this end, we propose a generative machine\nlearning model that creates an arbitrary amount of artificial material samples\nwith negligible computation cost, when trained on only a limited amount of\nauthentic samples. The key contribution of this work is the introduction of a\nmorphology constraint to the training of the generative model, that enforces\nthe resultant artificial material samples to have the same morphology\ndistribution as the authentic ones. We show empirically that the proposed model\ncreates artificial samples that better match with the authentic ones in\nmaterial property distributions than those generated from a state-of-the-art\nMarkov Random Field model, and thus is more effective at improving the\nprediction performance of a predictive structure-property model.\n", "  The initial-boundary value problem for the Kundu--Eckhaus equation on the\nhalf-line is considered in this paper by using the Fokas method. We will show\nthat the solution $u(x,t)$ can be expressed in terms of the solution of a\nmatrix Riemann--Hilbert problem formulated in the complex $k$-plane.\nFurthermore, based on a nonlinear steepest descent analysis of the associated\nRiemann--Hilbert problem, we can give the precise asymptotic formulas for the\nsolution of the Kundu--Eckhaus equation on the half-line.\n", "  Planets and brown dwarfs in close orbits will interact with their host stars,\nas soon as the stars evolve to become red giants. However, the outcome of those\ninteractions is still unclear. Recently, several brown dwarfs have been\ndiscovered orbiting hot subdwarf stars at very short orbital periods of 0.065 -\n0.096 d. More than 8\\% of the close hot subdwarf binaries might have\nsub-stellar companions. This shows that such companions can significantly\naffect late stellar evolution and that sdB binaries are ideal objects to study\nthis influence. Thirty-eight new eclipsing sdB binary systems with cool\nlow-mass companions and periods from 0.05 to 0.5 d were discovered based on\ntheir light curves by the OGLE project. In the recently published catalog of\neclipsing binaries in the Galactic bulge, we discovered 75 more systems. We\nwant to use this unique and homogeneously selected sample to derive the mass\ndistribution of the companions, constrain the fraction of sub-stellar\ncompanions and determine the minimum mass needed to strip off the red-giant\nenvelope. We are especially interested in testing models that predict hot\nJupiter planets as possible companions. Therefore, we started the EREBOS\n(Eclipsing Reflection Effect Binaries from the OGLE Survey) project, which aims\nat analyzing those new HW Vir systems based on a spectroscopic and photometric\nfollow up. For this we were granted an ESO Large Program for ESO-VLT/FORS2.\nHere we give an update on the current status of the project and present some\npreliminary results.\n", "  This chapter describes the development of X-ray Navigation at the Naval\nResearch Laboratory (NRL) within its astrophysics research programs. The\nprospects for applications emerged from early discoveries of X-ray source\nclasses and their properties. Starting around 1988 some NRL X-ray astronomy\nprograms included navigation as one of the motivations. The USA experiment\n(1999) was the first flight payload with an explicit X-ray navigation theme.\nSubsequently, NRL has continued to work in this area through participation in\nDARPA and NASA programs. Throughout, the general concept of X-ray navigation\n(XRNAV) has been broad enough to encompass many different uses of X-ray source\nobservations for attitude determination, position determination, and\ntimekeeping. Pulsar-based X-ray navigation (XNAV) is a special case.\n", "  We argue that a discrete Shilnikov attractor exists in the system of five\nidentical globally coupled phase oscillators with biharmonic coupling. We\nexplain the scenario that leads to birth of this kind of attractor and\nnumerically illustrate the sequence of bifurcations that supports our\nstatement.\n", "  Scholars have increasingly investigated \"crowdsourcing\" as an alternative to\nexpert-based judgment or purely data-driven approaches to predicting the\nfuture. Under certain conditions, scholars have found that crowdsourcing can\noutperform these other approaches. However, despite interest in the topic and a\nseries of successful use cases, relatively few studies have applied empirical\nmodel thinking to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of crowdsourcing in\nreal-world contexts. In this paper, we offer three novel contributions. First,\nwe explore a dataset of over 600,000 predictions from over 7,000 participants\nin a multi-year tournament to predict the decisions of the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States. Second, we develop a comprehensive crowd construction framework\nthat allows for the formal description and application of crowdsourcing to\nreal-world data. Third, we apply this framework to our data to construct more\nthan 275,000 crowd models. We find that in out-of-sample historical\nsimulations, crowdsourcing robustly outperforms the commonly-accepted null\nmodel, yielding the highest-known performance for this context at 80.8% case\nlevel accuracy. To our knowledge, this dataset and analysis represent one of\nthe largest explorations of recurring human prediction to date, and our results\nprovide additional empirical support for the use of crowdsourcing as a\nprediction method.\n", "  This work presents a combined numerical and experimental approach to\ncharacterize the macroscopic transport and acoustic behavior of foam materials\nwith a membrane cellular structure. A direct link between the sound absorption\nbehavior of a membrane foam-based layer and its local microstructural\nmorphology is also investigated. To this regard, we first produce a set of foam\nsamples having the same density and the same monodisperse pore size but\ndifferent values of the closure rate of the windows separating the foam pores.\nThen, the morphology of pore connectivity with membranes is measured directly\non SEM together binocular images. The obtained morphological information is\nused to reconstruct the representative unit cell for computational performance.\nThe knowledge of the computational model of acoustic porous materials obtained\nby a hybrid approach based on the scaling laws and the semi-phenomenological\nJCAL model. For validation purpose, the numerical simulations are further\ncompared with the experimental data obtained from a set of three-microphone\ntube tests, a very good agreement is observed. In acoustic terms, the obtained\nresults point out that for the given high porosity and cell size, we can\narchive a high sound absorbing ability of based-foam layer by controlling the\nmembrane level at a range of 45-85$\\%$. To elaborate these foams, a gelatin\nconcentration in a range of 14-18$\\%$ should be used in the foam making\nprocess. In addition, we can obtain for instance the peak and the average\nvalues of acoustic absorption of a foam layer in a specific frequency range of\ninterest by varying its membrane content. Methodologically, our work proposes\n(i) a systematic approach to characterize directly macroscopic properties from\nthe local microstructure, and (ii) a manufacturing technique that can be used\nto make foams with the desired microstructure.\n", "  We present NMR spectra of remote-magnetized deuterated water, detected in an\nunshielded environment by means of a differential atomic magnetometer. The\nmeasurements are performed in a $\\mu$T field, while pulsed techniques are\napplied -following the sample displacement- in a 100~$\\mu$T field, to tip both\nD and H nuclei by controllable amounts. The broadband nature of the detection\nsystem enables simultaneous detection of the two signals and accurate\nevaluation of their decay times. The outcomes of the experiment demonstrate the\npotential of ultra-low-field NMR spectroscopy in important applications where\nthe correlation between proton and deuteron spin-spin relaxation rates as a\nfunction of external parameters contains significant information.\n", "  We consider the edge statistics of Dyson Brownian motion with deterministic\ninitial data. Our main result states that if the initial data has a spectral\nedge with rough square root behavior down to a scale $\\eta_* \\geq N^{-2/3}$ and\nno outliers, then after times $t \\gg \\sqrt{ \\eta_*}$, the statistics at the\nspectral edge agree with the GOE/GUE. In particular we obtain the optimal time\nto equilibrium at the edge $t = N^{\\varepsilon} / N^{1/3}$ for sufficiently\nregular initial data. Our methods rely on eigenvalue rigidity results similar\nto those appearing in [Lee-Schnelli], the coupling idea of\n[Bourgade-Erd\\H{o}s-Yau-Yin] and the energy estimate of\n[Bourgade-Erd\\H{o}s-Yau].\n", "  Just as natural river networks are known to be globally self-similar, recent\nresearch has shown that human-built urban networks, such as road networks, are\nalso functionally self-similar, and have fractal topology with power-law\nnode-degree distributions (p(k) = a k). Here we show, for the first time, that\nother urban infrastructure networks (sanitary and storm-water sewers), which\nsustain flows of critical services for urban citizens, also show scale-free\nfunctional topologies. For roads and drainage networks, we compared functional\ntopological metrics, derived from high-resolution data (70,000 nodes) for a\nlarge US city providing services to about 900,000 citizens over an area of\nabout 1,000 km2. For the whole city and for different sized subnets, we also\nexamined these networks in terms of geospatial co-location (roads and sewers).\nOur analyses reveal functional topological homogeneity among all the subnets\nwithin the city, in spite of differences in several urban attributes. The\nfunctional topologies of all subnets of both infrastructure types resemble\npower-law distributions, with tails becoming increasingly power-law as the\nsubnet area increases. Our findings hold implications for assessing the\nvulnerability of these critical infrastructure networks to cascading shocks\nbased on spatial interdependency, and for improved design and maintenance of\nurban infrastructure networks.\n", "  To date, endeavors in nanoscale spintronics are dominated by the use of\nsingle-electron or single-spin transistors having at their heart a\nsemiconductor, metallic or molecular quantum dot who's localized states are\nnon-spin-degenerate and can be controlled by an external bias applied via a\ngate electrode. Adjusting the bias of the gate one can realign those states\nwith respect to the chemical potentials of the leads and thus tailor the\nspin-polarized transmission properties of the device. Here we show that similar\nfunctionality can be achieved in a purely metallic junction comprised of a\nmetallic magnetic chains attached to metallic paramagnetic leads and biased by\na gate electrode. Our ab initio calculations of electron transport through\nmixed Pt-Fe (Fe-Pd and Fe-Rh) atomic chains suspended between Pt (Pd and Rh)\nelectrodes show that spin-polarized confined states of the chain can be shifted\nby the gate bias causing a change in the relative contributions of majority and\nminority channels to the nano-contact's conductance. As a result, we observe\nstrong dependence of conductance spin-polarization on the applied gate\npotential. In some cases the spin-polarization of conductance can even be\nreversed in sign upon gate potential application, which is a remarkable and\npromising trait for spintronic applications.\n", "  Tuberculosis relapse is a barrier to shorter treatment. It is thought that\nlipid rich cells, phenotypically resistant to antibiotics, may play a major\nrole. Most studies investigating relapse use sputum samples although tissue\nbacteria may play an important role. We developed a non-destructive, label-free\ntechnique combining wavelength modulated Raman (WMR) spectroscopy and\nfluorescence detection (Nile Red staining) to interrogate Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis cell state. This approach could differentiate single 'dormant'\n(lipid rich, LR) and 'non-dormant' (lipid poor, LP) cells with high sensitivity\nand specificity. We applied this to experimentally infected guinea pig lung\nsections and were able to distinguish both cell types showing that the LR\nphenotype dominates in infected tissue. Both in-vitro and ex-vivo spectra\ncorrelated well, showing for the first time that Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\nlikely to be phenotypically resistant to antibiotics, are present in large\nnumbers in tissue. This is an important step in understanding the pathology of\nrelapse supporting the idea that they may be caused by M. tuberculosis cells\nwith lipid inclusions.\n", "  We discuss some applications of the unquenched quark model which is an\nextension of the CQM that includes the effects of sea quarks via a 3P0\nquark-antiquark pair-creation mechanism. Particular attention is paid to the\nelectromagnetic couplings and beta decays of baryons. It is shown that the\nobserved discrepancies between the experimental data and the predictions of the\nCQM can be accounted for in large part by the effects of sea quarks in the\nunquenched quark model.\n", "  We offer to apply the powerful Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to find\nthe spreading rate variation by comparing profiles of marine magnetic anomalies\nwith the synthetic field constructed by the magnetic polarity reference scale.\nFor the fixed spreading rate and the given interval of the polarity scale we\ngenerate the synthetic magnetic fields which we compare with the field obtained\nfor temporal variations of seafloor spreading rate.\n", "  We present a comprehensive X-ray study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray\nbinary IGR J17062-6143, which has been accreting at low luminosities since its\ndiscovery in $2006$. Analysing NuSTAR, XMM-Newton and Swift observations, we\ninvestigate the very faint nature of this source through three approaches:\nmodelling the relativistic reflection spectrum to constrain the accretion\ngeometry, performing high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy to search for an\noutflow, and searching for the recently reported millisecond X-ray pulsations.\nWe find a strongly truncated accretion disk at $77^{+22}_{-18}$ gravitational\nradii ($\\sim 164$ km) assuming a high inclination, although a low inclination\nand a disk extending to the neutron star cannot be excluded. The\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy reveals evidence for oxygen-rich circumbinary\nmaterial, possibly resulting from a blueshifted, collisionally-ionised outflow.\nFinally, we do not detect any pulsations. We discuss these results in the\nbroader context of possible explanations for the persistent faint nature of\nweakly accreting neutron stars. The results are consistent with both an\nultra-compact binary orbit and a magnetically truncated accretion flow,\nalthough both cannot be unambigiously inferred. We also discuss the nature of\nthe donor star and conclude that it is likely a CO or O-Ne-Mg white dwarf,\nconsistent with recent multi-wavelength modelling.\n", "  As we know, from the Einstein equations the vanishing of the four-divergence\nof the (symmetric) energy-momentum tensor follows. This is the case because the\nfourdivergence of the Einstein tensor (which is also symmetric) vanishes\nidentically. Inverselly, we find that from the vanishing of the four-divergence\nof the energymomentum tensor (consisting in the general case of both symmetric\nand antisymmetric parts) not only the Einstein equations follow (concerning the\nsymmetric part), but also the so-named anti-Einstein equations (concerning the\nantisymmetric part). These equations must be considered as complementary to the\nEinstein equations. Also, while from the Einstein equations the energy density\n(or the pressure) can be found (without using an equation of state), from the\nvanishing of the four-divergence of the (symmetric) energy-momentum tensor the\npressure (or the energy density) can also be found, without having to use an\nadditional (but arbitrary) equation of state.\n"]}
