These clusters are different from the usual\nFortuin-Kasteleyn clusters, and are separated by domain walls that can cross\nand branch. We develop a transfer matrix technique enabling the formulation and\nnumerical study of spin clusters even when Q is not an integer. We further\nidentify geometrically the crossing events which give rise to conformal\ncorrelation functions. This leads to an infinite series of fundamental critical\nexponents h_{l_1-l_2,2 l_1}, valid for 0 </- Q </- 4, that describe the\ninsertion of l_1 thin and l_2 thick domain walls.\n", "  Pulsed laser excitation causes the luminescence of Nitrogen Vacancy centers\nin diamond to unexpectedly decrease with increasing pulse energy. This decrease\nis observed in both the negatively charged and neutral centers and is caused by\nshortening of the luminescence lifetimes of the centers of both types. In\ndarkness, the luminescence does not show any recovery on a time scale of 10\nmicroseconds but as little as three low-intensity pulses can return the\nluminescence to its previous, brighter state. An external magnetic field\nreduces the magnitude of the effect. A possible mechanism for these phenomena\nbased on optical polarisation and depolarisation of an electronic spin is\nproposed.\n", "  The idea of stable, localized bundles of energy has strong appeal as a model\nfor particles. In the 1950s John Wheeler envisioned such bundles as smooth\nconfigurations of electromagnetic energy that he called {\\em geons}, but none\nwere found. Instead, particle-like solutions were found in the late 1960s with\nthe addition of a scalar field, and these were given the name {\\em boson\nstars}. Since then, boson stars find use in a wide variety of models as sources\nof dark matter, as black hole mimickers, in simple models of binary systems,\nand as a tool in finding black holes in higher dimensions with only a single\nkilling vector. We discuss important varieties of boson stars, their dynamic\nproperties, and some of their uses, concentrating on recent efforts.\n", "  We study the effect of parton angular momentum on the twist-four correction\nto the left-right asymmetry in the electron-deuteron parity-violating deep\ninelastic scattering (PVDIS). We show that this higher-twist correction is\ntransparent to the dynamics of parton angular momentum needed to account for\nthe Sivers and Boer-Mulders functions and spin-independent parton distribution\nfunctions. A sufficiently precise measurement of the PVDIS asymmetry may, thus,\nprovide additional information about the parton dynamics responsible for\nnucleon spin.\n", "  Motivated by the S-duality conjecture, we study the Donaldson-Thomas\ninvariants of the 2 dimensional Gieseker stable sheaves on a threefold. These\nsheaves are supported on the fibers of a nonsingular threefold X fibered over a\nnonsingular curve. In the case where X is a K3 fibration, we express these\ninvariants in terms of the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert scheme of points\non the K3 fiber and the Noether-Lefschetz numbers of the fibration. We prove\nthat a certain generating function of these invariants is a vector modular form\nof weight -3/2 as predicted in S-duality.\n", "  Crushing strength of the breeder materials (lithium orthosilicate,\n$\\rm{Li_4SiO_4}$ or OSi) in the form of pebbles to be used for EU solid breeder\nconcept is investigated. The pebbles are fabricated using a melt-spray method\nand hence a size variation in the pebbles produced is expected. The knowledge\nof the mechanical integrity (crush strength) of the pebbles is important for a\nsuccessful design of breeder blanket. In this paper, we present the\nexperimental results of the crush (failure) loads for spherical OSi pebbles of\ndifferent diameters ranging from $250~\\mu$m to $800~\\mu$m. The ultimate failure\nload for each size shows a Weibull distribution. Furthermore, the mean crush\nload increases with increase in pebble diameter. It is also observed that the\nlevel of opacity of the pebble influences the crush load significantly. The\nexperimental data presented in this paper and the associated analysis could\npossibly help us to develop a framework for simulating a crushable polydisperse\npebble assembly using discrete element method.\n", "  In 1887 Woldemar Voigt published the paper \"On Doppler's Principle,\" in which\nhe demanded covariance to the homogeneous wave equation in inertial reference\nframes, assumed the invariance of the speed of light in these frames, and\nobtained a set of spacetime transformations different from the Lorentz\ntransformations. Without explicitly mentioning so, Voigt applied the postulates\nof special relativity to the wave equation. Here, we review the original\nderivation of Voigt's transformations and comment on their conceptual and\nhistorical importance in the context of special relativity. We discuss the\nrelation between the Voigt and Lorentz transformations and derive the former\nfrom the conformal covariance of the wave equation.\n", "  We show that there exist 35 choices for the coordinate transformation each\nleading to a potential for which the stationary Schr\\\"odinger equation is\nexactly solvable in terms of the general Heun functions. Because of the\nsymmetry of the Heun equation with respect to the transposition of its\nsingularities only eleven of these potentials are independent. Four of these\nindependent potentials are always explicitly written in terms of elementary\nfunctions, one potential is given through the Jacobi elliptic sn-function, and\nthe others are in general defined parametrically. Nine of the independent\npotentials possess exactly or conditionally integrable hypergeometric\nsub-potentials for which each of the fundamental solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is written through a single hypergeometric function. Many of the\npotentials possess sub-potentials for which the general solution is written\nthrough fundamental solutions each of which is a linear combination of two or\nmore Gauss hypergeometric functions. We present an example of such a potential\nwhich is a conditionally integrable generalization of the third exactly\nsolvable Gauss hypergeometric potential.\n", "  We propose an approach to detect individual Rydberg molecules with each\nmolecule consisting of two atoms in different Rydberg states. The scheme\nexploits the movement of atoms in the presence of an external force that exerts\nonly on atoms in one Rydberg state. Since the movement of atoms in the other\nRydberg state depends on whether they are bound with atoms directly driven by\nthe applied force, bound atoms can be distinguished from unbound atoms. By\nutilizing electromagnetically induced transparency, it is possible to\nnon-destructively image the positions of molecules. The scheme is sensitive to\na weak force, which is suited to optically detect spatial positions and bond\nstructure of Rydberg molecules.\n", "  Horizon-T is an innovative detector system constructed to study Extensive Air\nShowers (EAS) in the energy range above 10^16 eV coming from a wide range of\nzenith angles (0 - 85 degrees). The system is located at Tien Shan\nhigh-altitude Science Station of Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian\nAcademy of Sciences at approximately 3340 meters above the sea level. It\nconsists of eight charged particle detection points separated by the distance\nup to one kilometer as well as optical detector subsystem to view the\nVavilov-Cerenkov light from the EAS. The time resolution of charged particles\nand Vavilov-Cerenkov light photons passage of the detector system is a few ns.\nThis level of resolution allows conducting research of atmospheric development\nof individual EAS.\n", "  We show that experimental probes of the P-conserving, T-violating triple\ncorrelation in polarized neutron or nuclear $\\beta$-decay provide a unique\nprobe of possible T-violation at the TeV scale in the presence of right-handed\nneutrinos. In contrast to other possible sources of semileptonic T-violation\ninvolving only left-handed neutrinos, those involving right-handed neutrinos\nare relatively unconstrained by present limits on the permanent electric dipole\nmoments of the electron, neutral atoms, and the neutron. On the other hand, LHC\nresults for $pp\\to e+$ missing transverse energy imply that an order of\nmagnitude of improvement in $D$-coefficient sensitivity would be needed for\ndiscovery. Finally, we discuss the interplay with the scale of neutrino mass\nand naturalness considerations.\n", "  We analyze in detail a previous proposal by Dvali and G\\'omez that black\nholes could be treated as consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate of\ngravitons. In order to do so we extend the Einstein-Hilbert action with a\nchemical potential-like term, thus placing ourselves in a grand-canonical\nensemble. The form and characteristics of this chemical potential-like piece\nare discussed in some detail. We argue that the resulting equations of motion\nderived from the action could be interpreted as the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\ndescribing a graviton Bose-Einstein condensate trapped by the black hole\ngravitational field. After this, we proceed to expand the ensuring equations of\nmotion up to second order around the classical Schwarzschild metric so that\nsome non-linear terms in the metric fluctuation are kept. Next we search for\nsolutions and, modulo some very plausible assumptions, we find out that the\ncondensate vanishes outside the horizon but is non-zero in its interior.\nInspired by a linearized approximation around the horizon we are able to find\nan exact solution for the mean-field wave function describing the graviton\nBose-Einstein condensate in the black hole interior. After this, we can\nrederive some of the relations involving the number of gravitons $N$ and the\nblack hole characteristics along the lines suggested by Dvali and G\\'omez.\n", "  In addition to the weak-dipolar state and to the fluctuating-multipolar\nstate, widely discussed in the literature, a third regime has been identified\nin Dormy (2016). It corresponds to a strong-dipolar branch which appears to\napproach, in a numerically affordable regime, the magnetostrophic limit\nrelevant to the dynamics of the Earth's core. We discuss the transitions\nbetween these states and point to the relevance of this strong-dipolar state to\nGeodynamo modelling.\n", "  We investigate the effects of small static defects in the spacetime manifold.\nThe presence of the defects leads to a modification of the scalar field\ntwo-point function in Klein-Gordon theory. We calculate the energy-momentum\ntensor and discuss the possible mass generation for the scalar field in single\nand multiple defect spacetimes. We also extend these results to the photon\nfield and show that, as a result of the interaction with the defects, the\nphoton dispersion relations are modified.\n", "  Bulk superconductors are used in both many applications and material\ncharacterization experiments, being the bulk shape of rectangular prism very\nfrequent. However the magnetization currents are still mostly unknown for this\nkind of three dimensional (3D) shape, specially below the saturation magnetic\nfield. Knowledge of the magnetization currents in this kind of samples is\nneeded to interpret the measurements and the development of bulk materials for\napplications. This article presents a systematic analysis of the magnetization\ncurrents in prisms of square base and several thicknesses. We make this study\nby numerical modeling using a variational principle that enables high number of\ndegrees of freedom. We also compute the magnetization loops and the saturation\nmagnetic field, using a definition that is more relevant for thin prisms than\nprevious ones. The article presents a practical analytical fit for any aspect\nratio. For applied fields below the saturation field, the current paths are not\nrectangular, presenting 3D bending. The thickness-average results are\nconsistent with previous modeling and measurements for thin films. The 3D\nbending of the current lines indicates that there could be flux cutting effects\nin rectangular prisms. The component of the critical current density in the\napplied field direction may play a role, being the magnetization currents in a\nbulk and a stack of tapes not identical.\n", "  We present Chandra observations of hot gas structures, characteristic of gas\nstripping during infall, in the Virgo cluster elliptical galaxy M60 (NGC4649)\nlocated $1$ Mpc east of M87. $0.5-2$ keV Chandra X-ray images show a sharp\nleading edge in the surface brightness $12.4 \\pm 0.1$ kpc north and west of the\ngalaxy center in the direction of M87 characteristic of a merger cold front due\nto M60's motion through the Virgo ICM. We measured a temperature of $1.00 \\pm\n0.02$ keV for abundance $0.5 Z_\\odot$ inside the edge and\n$1.37^{+0.35}_{-0.19}$ keV for abundance $0.1 Z_\\odot$ in the Virgo ICM free\nstream region. We find that the observed jump in surface brightness yields a\ndensity ratio of $6.44^{+1.04}_{-0.67}$ between gas inside the edge and in the\ncluster free stream region. If the edge is a cold front due solely to the\ninfall of M60 in the direction of M87, we find a pressure ratio of\n$4.7^{+1.7}_{-1.4}$ and Mach number $1.7 \\pm 0.3$. For 1.37 keV Virgo gas we\nfind a total infall velocity for M60 of $1030 \\pm 180$ kms$^{-1}$. We calculate\nthe motion in the plane of the sky to be $1012^{+183}_{-192}$ km$^{-1}$\nimplying an inclination angle $\\xi = 11 \\pm 3$ degrees. Surface brightness\nprofiles show the presence of a faint diffuse gaseous tail. We identify\nfilamentary, gaseous wing structures caused by the galaxy's motion through the\nICM. The structure and dimensions of these wings are consistent with\nsimulations of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities as expected if the gas stripping\nis close to inviscid.\n", "  We consider the most general action for gravity which is quadratic in\ncurvature. In this case first order and second order formalisms are not\nequivalent. This framework is a good candidate for a unitary and renormalizable\ntheory of the gravitational field; in particular, there are no propagators\nfalling down faster than $\\tfrac{1}{p^2}$. Calculations are somewhat involved\nwhen all monomials are considered, but we have intended to laid down the\ngeneral case. The interaction between external sources is analyzed; this\ninteraction is conveyed mainly by the three-index connection field. The theory\nas it stands, is in the conformal invariant phase; only when Weyl invariance is\nbroken through the coupling to matter can an Einstein-Hilbert term (and its\ncorresponding Planck mass scale) be generated by quantum corrections.\n", "  We investigate lateral p-n junctions, electrostatically defined in 14 nm-wide\nHgTe-based quantum wells (QWs) with inverted band structure. The p-n junctions\nresistances are close to $h/2e^2$, consistent with some previous experiments on\n8-10 nm QWs, and the current-voltage characteristics are highly linear,\nindicating the transport via ballistic helical edge states. Shot noise\nmeasurements are performed in order to further verify the underlying transport\nmechanism. We discuss the role of unknown inelastic relaxation rates in the\nleads and in the edge channels for the correct interpretation of the noise\ndata. Although the interpretation in favor of the helical edge states seems\nmore consistent, a definite conclusion can not be drawn based on the present\nexperiment. Our approach looks promising for the study of short quasi-ballistic\nedges in topological insulators (TIs) in suitable geometry.\n", "  We investigate Beliaev-Landau scattering in a gas of interacting photons in a\ncoherently driven array of nonlinear dissipative resonators, as described by\nthe 1D driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model. Due to the absence of detailed\nbalance in such an out-of-equilibrium setup, steady-state properties can be\nmuch more sensitive to the underlying microscopic dynamics. As the popular\ntruncated Wigner approximation dramatically fails in capturing this physics, we\npresent an alternative approach, based on a systematic expansion beyond the\nBogoliubov approximation, which includes the third-order correlation functions\nin the dynamics. As experimentally accessible signatures of Beliaev-Landau\nprocesses, we report a small but nonnegligible correction to the Bogoliubov\nprediction for the steady-state momentum distribution showing a characteristic\nseries of peaks and dips, as well as non-Gaussian features in the statistics of\nthe cavity output field.\n", "  Active biological systems reside far from equilibrium, dissipating heat even\nin their steady state, thus requiring an extension of conventional equilibrium\nthermodynamics and statistical mechanics. In this Letter, we have extended the\nemerging framework of stochastic thermodynamics to active matter. In\nparticular, for the active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, we have provided\nconsistent definitions of thermodynamic quantities such as work, energy, heat,\nentropy, and entropy production at the level of single, stochastic trajectories\nand derived related fluctuation relations. We have developed a generalization\nof the Clausius inequality, which is valid even in the presence of the\nnon-Hamiltonian dynamics underlying active matter systems. We have illustrated\nour results with explicit numerical studies.\n", "  Access to collective excitations lies at the heart of our understanding of\nquantum many-body systems. We study the Higgs and Goldstone modes in a\nsupersolid quantum gas that is created by coupling a Bose-Einstein condensate\nsymmetrically to two optical cavities. The cavity fields form a U(1)-symmetric\norder parameter that can be modulated and monitored along both quadratures in\nreal time. This enables us to measure the excitation energies across the\nsuperfluid-supersolid phase transition, establish their amplitude and phase\nnature, as well as characterize their dynamics from an impulse response.\nFurthermore, we can give a tunable mass to the Goldstone mode at the crossover\nbetween continuous and discrete symmetry by changing the coupling of the\nquantum gas with either cavity.\n", "  Recent lattice studies of near-conformal strong dynamics suggest the\nexistence of a light scalar. This provides motivation to consider a simple\nHamiltonian-based bound-state model where the pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and\naxial-vector states are treated on an equal footing. The model interpolates\nbetween the non-relativistic limit and the highly relativistic chiral limit,\nwhere the pseudoscalar mass drops to zero. The fermion mass becomes purely\ndynamical at this point. When the gauge coupling is constant over a moderate\nrange of scales the scalar becomes significantly lighter than the spin 1 states\nas the chiral limit is approached. We relate this result to the behavior of the\nform factors of the respective states and their decay constants. In the\nconformal limit of the model all masses vanish and the theory is characterized\nby scaling dimensions.\n", "  We show that the interplay of chiral effective field theory and lattice QCD\ncan be used in the evaluation of so-called disconnected diagrams, which appear\nin the study of the isoscalar and isovector channels of pion-pion scattering\nand have long been a major challenge for the lattice community. By means of\npartially-quenched chiral perturbation theory, we distinguish and analyze the\neffects from different types of contraction diagrams to the pion-pion\nscattering amplitude, including its scattering lengths and the\nenergy-dependence of its imaginary part. Our results may be used to test the\ncurrent degree of accuracy of lattice calculation in the handling of\ndisconnected diagrams, as well as to set criteria for the future improvement of\nrelevant lattice computational techniques that may play a critical role in the\nstudy of other interesting QCD matrix elements.\n", "  The electronic and magnetic properties of ZrS2 nanoribbons (NRs) are\ninvestigated based on the first-principles calculations. It is found that the\nZrS2 NRs with armchair edges are all indirect-band-gap semiconductors without\nmagnetism and the band-gap exhibits odd-even oscillation behavior with the\nincrease of the ribbon width. For the NRs with zigzag edges, those with both\nedges S-terminated are nonmagnetic direct-band-gap semiconductors and the gap\ndecreases monotonically as a function of the ribbon width. However, the NRs\nwith one edge S-terminated and the other edge Zr-terminated are ferromagnetic\nhalf-metal, while those with both edges Zr-terminated tend to be ferromagnetic\nhalf-metal when the width $N\\geq9$. The magnetism of both systems mainly\noriginates from the unsaturated edge Zr atoms. Depending on the different edge\nconfigurations and ribbon widths, the ZrS2 NRs exhibit versatile electronic and\nmagnetic properties, making them promising candidates for the applications of\nelectronics and spintronics.\n", "  Memristors are nonlinear passive circuit elements which can be thought as\ntime varying resistances. When connected in a complex circuit these exhibit\nvery exotic behavior, typical of disordered systems, such as a universal slow\nrelaxation for intricated circuit topologies, and strong dependence on the\ninitial conditions. Being memristive components part of a circuit, non-local\neffects due to the Kirchhoff constraints are present. In the formalism\ndeveloped recently for a fairly general class of memristive circuits the\nconstraints are contained in a projection operator. We provide exact results\nregarding the fall-off of the elements with the Hamming distance on the\ncircuit, thus elucidating an insofar elusive and open question regarding the\nnon-local effects in crossbar arrays, currently being considered for on-chip\nmachine learning.\n", "  We study the quantum dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model on a ladder formed by\ntwo rings coupled by tunneling effect. By implementing the Bogoliubov\napproximation scheme, we prove that, despite the presence of the inter-ring\ncoupling term, the Hamiltonian decouples in many independent sub-Hamiltonians\n$\\hat{H}_k$ associated to momentum-mode pairs $\\pm k$. Each sub-Hamiltonian\n$\\hat{H}_k$ is then shown to be part of a specific dynamical algebra. The\nproperties of the latter allow us to perform the diagonalization process, to\nfind energy spectrum, the conserved quantities of the model, and to derive the\ntime evolution of important physical observables. We then apply this solution\nscheme to the simplest possible closed ladder, the double trimer. After\nobserving that the excitations of the system are weakly-populated vortices, we\nexplore the corresponding dynamics by varying the initial conditions and the\nmodel parameters. Finally, we show that the inter-ring tunneling determines a\nspectral collapse when approaching the border of the dynamical-stability\nregion.\n", "  Black holes (BHs) in an inspiraling compact binary system absorb the\ngravitational-wave (GW) energy and angular-momentum fluxes across their event\nhorizons and this leads to the secular change in their masses and spins during\nthe inspiral phase. The goal of this paper is to present ready-to-use, 3.5\npost-Newtonian (PN) template families for spinning, non-precessing, binary BH\ninspirals in quasicircular orbits, including the 2.5PN and 3.5PN horizon flux\ncontributions as well as the correction due to the secular change in the BH\nmasses and spins through 3.5PN order, respectively, in phase. We show that, for\nbinary BHs observable by Advanced LIGO with high mass ratio (larger than ~10)\nand large aligned-spins (larger than ~0.7), the mismatch between the\nfrequency-domain template with and without the horizon-flux contribution is\ntypically above the 3% mark. For (supermassive) binary BHs observed by LISA,\neven a moderate mass-ratios and spins can produce a similar level of the\nmismatch. Meanwhile, the mismatch due to the secular time variations of the BH\nmasses and spins is well below the 1% mark in both cases, hence this is truly\nnegligible. We also point out that neglecting the cubic-in-spin, point-particle\nphase term at 3.5PN order would deteriorate the effect of BH absorption in the\ntemplate.\n", "  To run quantum algorithms on emerging gate-model quantum hardware, quantum\ncircuits must be compiled to take into account constraints on the hardware. For\nnear-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is\ncritical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the\napplication of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits\nto newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on\ncompiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor\nconstraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating\nOperator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow\ngreat flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom\nmakes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is\na greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible\ncircuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal\nplanning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA\ncircuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report\ncompilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this\ntest set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning\nis a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.\n", "  Avalanche photodetectors (APDs) are key components in optical communication\nsystems due to their increased photocurrent gain and short response time as\ncompared to conventional photodetectors. A detector design where the\nmultiplication region is implemented in a large bandgap material is desired to\navoid detrimental Zener tunneling leakage currents, a concern otherwise in\nsmaller bandgap materials required for absorption at 1.3/1.55 um.\nSelf-assembled III-V semiconductor nanowires offer key advantages such as\nenhanced absorption due to optical resonance effects, strain-relaxed\nheterostructures and compatibility with main-stream silicon technology. Here,\nwe present electrical and optical characteristics of single InP and InP/InAsP\nnanowire APD structures. Temperature-dependent breakdown characteristics of\np+-n-n+ InP nanowire devices were investigated first. A clear trap-induced\nshift in breakdown voltage was inferred from I-V measurements. An improved\ncontact formation to the p+-InP segment was observed upon annealing, and its\neffect on breakdown characteristics was investigated. The bandgap in the\nabsorption region was subsequently varied from pure InP to InAsP to realize\nspatially separate absorption and multiplication APDs in heterostructure\nnanowires. In contrast to the homojunction APDs, no trap-induced shifts were\nobserved for the heterostructure APDs. A gain of 12 was demonstrated for\nselective optical excitation of the InAsP segment. Additional electron\nbeam-induced current measurements were carried out to investigate the effect of\nlocal excitation along the nanowire on the I-V characteristics. Our results\nprovide important insight for optimization of avalanche photodetector devices\nbased on III-V nanowires.\n", "  Scanning gate microscopy images from measurements made in the vicinity of\nquantum point contacts were originally interpreted in terms of current flow.\nSome recent work has analytically connected the local density of states to\nconductance changes in cases of perfect transmission, and at least\nqualitatively for a broader range of circumstances. In the present paper, we\nshow analytically that in any time-reversal invariant system there are\nimportant deviations that are highly sensitive to imperfect transmission.\nNevertheless, the unperturbed partial local density of states can be extracted\nfrom a weakly invasive scanning gate microscopy experiment, provided the\nquantum point contact is tuned anywhere on a conductance plateau. A\nperturbative treatment in the reflection coefficient shows just how sensitive\nthis correspondence is to the departure from the quantized conductance value\nand reveals the necessity of local averaging over the tip position. It is also\nshown that the quality of the extracted partial local density of states\ndecreases with increasing tip radius.\n", "  Parallelized quantum information processing requires tailored quantum\nmemories to simultaneously handle multiple photons. The spatial degree of\nfreedom is a promising candidate to facilitate such photonic multiplexing.\nUsing a single-photon resolving camera we demonstrate a wavevector multiplexed\nquantum memory based on a cold atomic ensemble. Observation of nonclassical\ncorrelations between Raman scattered photons is confirmed by an average value\nof the second-order correlation function $g_{\\mathrm{{S,AS}}}^{(2)}=72\\pm5$ in\n665 separated modes simultaneously. The proposed protocol utilizing the\nmultimode memory along with the camera will facilitate generation of\nmulti-photon states, which are a necessity in quantum-enhanced sensing\ntechnologies and as an input to photonic quantum circuits.\n", "  The pressure dependence of the structural ($T_s$), antiferromagnetic ($T_m$),\nand superconducting ($T_c$) transition temperatures in FeSe is investigated on\nthe basis of the 16-band $d$-$p$ model. At ambient pressure, a shallow hole\npocket disappears due to the correlation effect, as observed in the\nangular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillation\n(QO) experiments, resulting in the suppression of the antiferromagnetic order,\nin contrast to the other iron pnictides. The orbital-polarization interaction\nbetween the Fe $d$ orbital and Se $p$ orbital is found to drive the\nferro-orbital order responsible for the structural transition without\naccompanying the antiferromagnetic order. The pressure dependence of the Fermi\nsurfaces is derived from the first-principles calculation and is found to well\naccount for the opposite pressure dependences of $T_s$ and $T_m$, around which\nthe enhanced orbital and magnetic fluctuations cause the double-dome structure\nof the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ in the Eliashberg equation, as consistent with that\nof $T_c$ in FeSe.\n", "  A target skyrmion is a flux-closed spin texture that has two-fold degeneracy\nand is promising as a binary state in next generation universal memories.\nAlthough its formation in nanopatterned chiral magnets has been predicted, its\nobservation has remained challenging. Here, we use off-axis electron holography\nto record images of target skyrmions in a 160-nm-diameter nanodisk of the\nchiral magnet FeGe. We compare experimental measurements with numerical\nsimulations, demonstrate switching between two stable degenerate target\nskyrmion ground states that have opposite polarities and rotation senses and\ndiscuss the observed switching mechanism.\n", "  In this paper, we construct generic, spherically symmetric thin-shell\nwormholes and check their stabilities using the unified dark sector, including\ndark energy and dark matter. We give a master equation, from which one can\nrecover, as a special case, other stability solutions for generic spherically\nsymmetric thin-shell wormholes. In this context, we consider a particular\nsolution; namely we construct an effective thin-shell wormhole under Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking. We explore stability analyses using different models of the\nmodified Chaplygin gas with constraints from cosmological observations such as\nseventh-year full Wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe data points, type Ia\nsupernovae, and baryon acoustic oscillation. In all these models we find stable\nsolutions by choosing suitable values for the parameters of the Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking effect.\n", "  We investigate the two lowest-lying weakly bound states of $N \\leq 8$ bosons\nas functions of the strength of two-body Gaussian interactions. We observe the\nlimit for validity of Efimov physics. We calculate energies and second radial\nmoments as functions of scattering length. For identical bosons we find that\ntwo $(N-1)$-body states appear before the $N$-body ground states become bound.\nThis pattern ceases to exist for $N \\geq 7$ where the size of the ground state\nbecomes smaller than the range of the two-body potential. All mean-square-radii\nfor $N \\geq 4$ remain finite at the threshold of zero binding, where they vary\nas $(N-1)^{p}$ with $p=-3/2,-3$ for ground and excited states, respectively.\nDecreasing the mass of one particle we find stronger binding and smaller radii.\nThe identical particles form a symmetric system, while the lighter particle is\nfurther away in the ground states. In the excited states we find the identical\nbosons either surrounded or surrounding the light particle for few or many\nbosons, respectively. We demonstrate that the first excited states for all\nstrengths resemble two-body halos of one particle weakly bound to a dense\n$N$-body system for $N=3,4$. This structure ceases to exist for $N \\geq 5$.\n", "  We construct an unified model of inflation and PeV dark matter which is\nconsistent with the CMB observations and can explain the PeV neutrinos at\nIceCube. A no-scale K\\\"ahler potential and an appropriate choice of gauge\nkinetic function in MSSM superfields can result in Starobinsky like\nHiggs-sneutrino plateau inflation from $D$-term potential. The SUSY breaking at\nthe PeV scale is achieved through the Polonyi field. This sets the scales $m_0,\nm_{\\frac{1}{2}}, A_0$ at the GUT scale in terms of the parameters of the\ntheory. The low energy (PeV scale) spectrum is obtained by running the RGEs. We\nshow that the $\\sim$125 GeV higgs and the gauge coupling unification can be\nachieved in this model. The $6$ PeV bino-type dark matter is a subdominant\nfraction ($\\sim 11\\%$) of the relic density and its decay gives the PeV scale\nneutrino flux observed at IceCube by choosing the couplings of the $R$-parity\nviolating operators.\n", "  The quantum Ising model with random couplings and random transverse fields on\nthe Cayley tree is studied by Real-Space-Renormalization in order to construct\nthe whole set of eigenstates. The renormalization rules are analyzed via large\ndeviations. The phase transition between the paramagnetic and the spin-glass\nMany-Body-Localized phases involves the activated exponent $\\psi=1$ and the\ncorrelation length exponent $\\nu=1$. The spin-glass-ordered cluster containing\n$N_{SG}$ spins is found to be extremely sparse with respect to the total number\n$N$ of spins : its size grows only logarithmically at the critical point\n$N_{SG}^{criti} \\propto \\ln N$, and it is sub-extensive $N_{SG} \\propto\nN^{\\theta}$ in the finite region of the spin-glass phase where the continuously\nvarying exponent $\\theta$ remains in the interval $0<\\theta<1$.\n", "  In earlier work the authors obtained formulas for the probability in the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process that the $m$th particle from the left is at\nsite $x$ at time $t$. They were expressed in general as sums of multiple\nintegrals and, for the case of step initial condition, as an integral involving\na Fredholm determinant. In the present work these results are generalized to\nthe case where the $m$th particle is the left-most one in a contiguous block of\n$L$ particles. The earlier work depended in a crucial way on two combinatorial\nidentities, and the present work begins with a generalization of these\nidentities to general $L$.\n", "  We provide a catalogue of pairs of stars whose periapses are less than 1pc\nwithin the past or future 100 Myr. We use astrometric data from TGAS, Hipparcos\nand radial velocity data from RAVE and XHIP to find the space motions and hence\nthe initial conditions of 229, 441 stars in Galactic coordinates. We simulate\nthe orbits of these stars and focus on the time, distance and velocity at\nperiastron for 8149 pairs using the k-d tree algorithm to find nearest\nneighbors. We find an anisotropy in the directions of encounter pairs caused by\nthe solar apex motion, indicating a role of peculiar motion imposing an\nanisotropic tidal force on planetary systems. We call this effect \"kinematic\ntide\". Among the encounter pairs there are 4 encounters with the Solar System\nwith periapses less than 1 pc and 96 pairs with periapses less than 0.1 pc. We\nalso find 577 close encounters of stars which host planetary systems and/or\ndebris disks. We discuss a range of uses for an encounter catalogue and present\nan example of how the time-varying network of stellar motions will be crucial\nfor efficient interstellar travel between planetary systems. The catalogues are\navailable at http://star.herts.ac.uk/pandora/cep1.\n", "  We analyze a random walk strategy on undirected regular networks involving\npower matrix functions of the type $L^{\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ where $L$ indicates a\n`simple' Laplacian matrix. We refer such walks to as `Fractional Random Walks'\nwith admissible interval $0<\\alpha \\leq 2$. We deduce for the Fractional Random\nWalk probability generating functions (network Green's functions). From these\nanalytical results we establish a generalization of Polya's recurrence theorem\nfor Fractional Random Walks on $d$-dimensional infinite lattices: The\nFractional Random Walk is transient for dimensions $d > \\alpha$ (recurrent for\n$d\\leq\\alpha$) of the lattice. As a consequence for $0<\\alpha< 1$ the\nFractional Random Walk is transient for all lattice dimensions $d=1,2,..$ and\nin the range $1\\leq\\alpha < 2$ for dimensions $d\\geq 2$. Finally, for\n$\\alpha=2$ Polya's classical recurrence theorem is recovered, namely the walk\nis transient only for lattice dimensions $d\\geq 3$. The generalization of\nPolya's recurrence theorem remains valid for the class of random walks with\nL\\'evy flight asymptotics for long-range steps. We also analyze for the\nFractional Random Walk mean first passage probabilities, mean first passage\ntimes, and global mean first passage times (Kemeny constant). For the infinite\n1D lattice (infinite ring) we obtain for the transient regime $0<\\alpha<1$\nclosed form expressions for the fractional lattice Green's function matrix\ncontaining the escape and ever passage probabilities. The ever passage\nprobabilities fulfill Riesz potential power law decay asymptotic behavior for\nnodes far from the departure node. The non-locality of the Fractional Random\nWalk is generated by the non-diagonality of the fractional Laplacian matrix\nwith L\\'evy type heavy tailed inverse power law decay for the probability of\nlong-range moves.\n", "  The post-Newtonian approximation is useful to discuss gravitational waveforms\nfor binary inspirals. In this note, for retrograde circular orbits in the\nequatorial plane, we discuss the region of validity of the post-Newtonian\napproximation by using the gravitational energy flux derived numerically and\nanalytically in the black hole perturbation approach. It is found that the edge\nof the allowable region behaves quite intricately, including prograde orbits\neven if we treat higher post-Newtonian orders.\n", "  We construct transformations which take asymptotically AdS hyperbolic initial\ndata into asymptotically flat initial data, and which preserve relevant\nphysical quantities. This is used to derive geometric inequalities in the\nasymptotically AdS hyperbolic setting from counterparts in the asymptotically\nflat realm, whenever a geometrically motivated system of elliptic equations\nadmits a solution. The inequalities treated here relate mass, angular momentum,\ncharge, and horizon area.\n", "  Using a series of cosmological simulations that includes one dark-matter-only\n(DM-only) run, one gas cooling-star formation-supernovae feedback (CSF) run and\none that additionally includes feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we\nclassify the large-scale structures with both a velocity-shear-tensor code\n(Vweb) and a tidal-tensor code (Pweb). We find that the baryonic processes have\nalmost no impact on large-scale structures -- at least not when classified\nusing aforementioned techniques. More importantly, our results confirm that the\ngas component alone can be used to infer the filamentary structure of the\nUniverse practically un-biased, which could be applied to cosmology constrains.\nIn addition, the gas filaments are classified with its velocity (Vweb) and\ndensity (Pweb) fields, which can theoretically connect to the radio\nobservations, such as HI surveys. This will help us to bias-freely link the\nradio observations with DM distributions at large scale.\n", "  Kinematic correlations for pairs of beauty hadrons, produced in high energy\nproton-proton collisions, are studied. The data sample used was collected with\nthe LHCb experiment at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV and corresponds\nto an integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement is performed using\ninclusive $b\\rightarrow J/\\psi X$ decays in the rapidity range\n$2<y^{J/\\psi}<4.5$. The observed correlations are in good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  In global fits of parton distribution functions (PDFs) a large fraction of\ndata points, mostly from the HERA collider, lies in a region of $x$ and $Q^2$\nthat is sensitive to small-$x$ logarithmic enhancements. Thus, the proper\ntheoretical description of these data requires the inclusion of small-$x$\nresummation. In this work we provide all the necessary ingredients to perform a\nPDF fit to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data which includes small-$x$\nresummation in the evolution of PDFs and in the computation of DIS structure\nfunctions. To this purpose, not only we include the resummation of DIS massless\nstructure functions, but we also consider the production of a massive final\nstate (e.g. a charm quark), and the consistent resummation of mass collinear\nlogarithms through the implementation of a variable flavour number scheme at\nsmall $x$. As a result, we perform the small-$x$ resummation of the matching\nconditions in PDF evolution at heavy flavour thresholds. The resummed results\nare accurate at next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy and matched, for the\nfirst time, to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). Furthermore, we improve on\nour previous work by considering a novel all-order treatment of running\ncoupling contributions. These results, which are implemented in a new release\nof HELL, version 2.0, will allow to fit PDFs from DIS data at the highest\npossible theoretical accuracy, NNLO+NLL, thus providing an important step\nforward towards precision determination of PDFs and consequently precision\nphenomenology at the LHC and beyond.\n", "  We improve limits on the spin-independent scattering cross section of Dark\nMatter on nucleons, for DM in the 300 MeV -- 100 GeV mass range, based on the\nDAMIC and XQC experiments. Our results close the window which previously\nexisted in this mass range, for a DM-nucleon cross section of order $\\approx\n\\mu$b, assuming the standard velocity distribution.\n", "  Semiconductor nanowires offer great potential for realizing broadband\nphotodetectors that are compatible with silicon technology. However, the\nspectral range of such detectors has so far been limited to selected regions in\nthe ultraviolet, visible and near infrared. Here, we report on broadband\nnanowire heterostructure array photodetectors exhibiting a photoresponse from\nthe visible to long-wavelength infrared. In particular, the infrared response\nfrom 3-20 um is enabled by normal incidence excitation of intersubband\ntransitions in low-bandgap InAsP quantum discs synthesized axially within InP\nnanowires. The optical characteristics are explained by the excitation of the\nlongitudinal component of optical modes in the photonic crystal formed by the\nnanostructured portion of the detectors, combined with a non-symmetric\npotential profile of the discs resulting from synthesis. Our results provide a\ngeneralizable insight into how broadband nanowire photodetectors may be\ndesigned, and how engineered nanowire heterostructures open up new fascinating\nopportunities for optoelectronics.\n", "  We provide a classification of the possible flow of two-component\nBose-Einstein condensates evolving from initially discontinuous profiles. We\nconsider the situation where the dynamics can be reduced to the consideration\nof a single polarization mode (also denoted as \"magnetic excitation\") obeying a\nsystem of equations equivalent to the Landau-Lifshitz equation for an\neasy-plane ferro-magnet. We present the full set of one-phase periodic\nsolutions. The corresponding Whitham modulation equations are obtained together\nwith formulas connecting their solutions with the Riemann invariants of the\nmodulation equations. The problem is not genuinely nonlinear, and this results\nin a non-single-valued mapping of the solutions of the Whitham equations with\nphysical wave patterns as well as to the appearance of new elements --- contact\ndispersive shock waves --- that are absent in more standard, genuinely\nnonlinear situations. Our analytic results are confirmed by numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  We consider the inverse Ising problem, i.e. the inference of network\ncouplings from observed spin trajectories for a model with continuous time\nGlauber dynamics. By introducing two sets of auxiliary latent random variables\nwe render the likelihood into a form, which allows for simple iterative\ninference algorithms with analytical updates. The variables are: (1) Poisson\nvariables to linearise an exponential term which is typical for point process\nlikelihoods and (2) P\\'olya-Gamma variables, which make the likelihood\nquadratic in the coupling parameters. Using the augmented likelihood, we derive\nan expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain the maximum likelihood\nestimate of network parameters. Using a third set of latent variables we extend\nthe EM algorithm to sparse couplings via L1 regularization. Finally, we develop\nan efficient approximate Bayesian inference algorithm using a variational\napproach. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on data simulated\nfrom an Ising model. For data which are simulated from a more biologically\nplausible network with spiking neurons, we show that the Ising model captures\nwell the low order statistics of the data and how the Ising couplings are\nrelated to the underlying synaptic structure of the simulated network.\n", "  We study the behavior of strongly interacting matter under a uniform intense\nexternal magnetic field in the context of nonlocal extensions of the\nPolyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. A detailed description of the formalism is\npresented, considering the cases of zero and finite temperature. In particular,\nwe analyze the effect of the magnetic field on the chiral restoration and\ndeconfinement transitions, which are found to occur at approximately the same\ncritical temperatures. Our results show that these models offer a natural\nframework to account for the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis found in\nlattice QCD calculations.\n", "  We numerically investigate dynamical property in the one-dimensional\ntight-binding model with long-range correlated disorder having power spectrum\n  $1/f^\\alpha$ ($\\alpha:$spectrum exponent) generated by Fourier filtering\nmethod. For relatively small $\\alpha<\\alpha_c(=2)$ time-dependence of mean\nsquare displacement (MSD) of the initially localized wavepacket shows ballistic\nspread and localizes as time elapses. It is shown that $\\alpha-$dependence of\nthe dynamical localization length (DLL) determined by the MSD exhibits a simple\nscaling law in the localization regime for the relatively weak disorder\nstrength $W$. Furthermore, scaled MSD by the DLL almost obeys an universal\nfunction from the ballistic to the localization regime in the various\ncombinations of the parameters $\\alpha$ and $W$.\n", "  A finite element approach to solve numerically the Takagi-Taupin equations\nexpressed in a weak form is presented and applied to simulate X-ray\nreflectivity curves, spatial intensity distributions and focusing properties of\nbent perfect crystals in symmetric reflection geometry. The proposed framework\nencompasses a new formulation of the Takagi-Taupin equations, which appears to\nbe promising in terms of robustness and stability and supports the Fresnel\npropagation of the diffracted waves. The presented method is very flexible and\nhas the potential of dealing with dynamical X-ray or neutron diffraction\nproblems related to crystals of arbitrary shapes and deformations. The\nreference implementation based on the commercial COMSOL Multiphysics software\npackage is available to the relevant user community.\n", "  A method is described for the detection and estimation of transient chirp\nsignals that are characterized by smoothly evolving, but otherwise unmodeled,\namplitude envelopes and instantaneous frequencies. Such signals are\nparticularly relevant for gravitational wave searches, where they may arise in\na wide range of astrophysical scenarios. The method uses splines with\ncontinuously adjustable breakpoints to represent the amplitude envelope and\ninstantaneous frequency of a signal, and estimates them from noisy data using\npenalized least squares and model selection. Simulations based on waveforms\nspanning a wide morphological range show that the method performs well in a\nsignal-to-noise ratio regime where the time-frequency signature of a signal is\nhighly degraded, thereby extending the coverage of current unmodeled\ngravitational wave searches to a wider class of signals.\n", "  We revisit the problem of decoherence of a qubit centrally coupled to an\ninteracting spin environment, here modeled by a quantum compass chain or an\nextended XY model in a staggered magnetic field. These two models both support\ndistinct spin liquid phases, adding a new element to the problem. By analyzing\ntheir Loschmidt echoes when perturbed by the qubit we find that a fast\ndecoherence of the qubit is conditioned on the presence of propagating\nquasiparticles which couple to it. Different from expectations based on earlier\nworks on central spin models, our result implies that the closeness of an\nenvironment to a quantum phase transition is neither a sufficient nor a\nnecessary condition for an accelerated decoherence rate of a qubit.\n", "  We propose a Grand Unified Theory of Flavour, based on $SO(10)$ together with\na non-Abelian discrete group $S_4$, under which the unified three quark and\nlepton 16-plets are unified into a single triplet $3'$. The model involves a\nfurther discrete group $ \\mathbb{Z}_4^R\\times \\mathbb{Z}_4^3$ which controls\nthe Higgs and flavon symmetry breaking sectors. The CSD2 flavon vacuum\nalignment is discussed, along with the GUT breaking potential and the\ndoublet-triplet splitting, and proton decay is shown to be under control. The\nYukawa matrices are derived in detail, from renormalisable diagrams, and\nneutrino masses emerge from the type I seesaw mechanism. A full numerical fit\nis performed with 15 input parameters generating 19 presently constrained\nobservables, taking into account supersymmetry threshold corrections. The model\npredicts a normal neutrino mass ordering with a CP oscillation phase of\n$260^{\\circ}$, an atmospheric angle in the first octant and neutrinoless double\nbeta decay with $m_{\\beta \\beta}= 11$ meV. We discuss $N_2$ leptogenesis, which\nfixes the second right-handed neutrino mass to be $M_2\\simeq 2\\times 10^{11}$\nGeV, in the natural range predicted by the model.\n", "  Doubts have been expressed in a comment (Eur. J. Phys., 39, 018001, 2018),\nabout the tenability of the formulation for radiative losses in our recent\npublished work (Eur. J. Phys., 37, 045210, 2016). We provide our reply to the\ncomment. In particular, it is pointed out that one need to clearly distinguish\nbetween the rate of the energy-momentum being carried by the electromagnetic\nradiation to far-off space, and that of the mechanical energy-momentum losses\nbeing incurred by the radiating charge. It is also demonstrated that while the\nPoynting flux is always positive through a spherical surface centred on the\nretarded position of the charge, it could surprisingly be negative through a\nsurface centred on the \"present\" position of the charge. It is further shown\nthat the mysterious Schott term, hitherto thought in literature to arise from\nsome acceleration-dependent energy in fields, is actually nothing but the\ndifference in rate of change of energy in self-fields of the charge between the\nretarded and present times.\n", "  It is well known that the Smarr formula does not hold for black holes in\nnon-linear electrodynamics. The main reason for this is the fact that the trace\nof the energy momentum tensor for nonlinear electrodynamics does not vanish as\nit is for Maxwell's electrodynamics. Starting from the Komar integral, we\nderived a new Smarr-type formula for spherically symmetric static electrically\ncharged black hole solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics. We show that this\ngeneral formula is in agreement with some that are obtained for black hole\nsolutions with nonlinear electrodynamics.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional bosonic gas on a ring lattice, in the presence\nof a localized barrier, and under the effect of an artificial gauge field. By\nmeans of exact diagonalization we study the persistent currents at varying\ninteractions and barrier strength, for various values of lattice filling. While\ngenerically the persistent currents are strongly suppressed in the Mott\ninsulator phase, they show a resonant behaviour when the barrier strength\nbecomes of the order of the interaction energy. We explain this phenomenon\nusing an effective single-particle model. We show that this effect is robust at\nfinite temperature, up the temperature scale where persistent currents vanish.\n", "  The current status of electroweak radiative corrections to the muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment is discussed. Asymptotic expansions for some important\nelectroweak two loop top quark triangle diagrams are illustrated and extended\nto higher order. Results are compared with the more general integral\nrepresentation solution for generic fermion triangle loops coupled to\npseudoscalar and scalar bosons of arbitrary mass. Excellent agreement is found\nfor a broader than expected range of mass parameters.\n", "  We develop an analytical theory for edge states in monolayers of transition\nmetal dichalcogenides based on a general boundary condition for a two-band\n${\\bf kp}$-Hamiltonian in case of uncoupled valleys. Taking into account {\\it\nedge} spin-orbit interaction we reveal that edge states, in general, have\nlinear dispersion that is determined by three real phenomenological parameters\nin the boundary condition. In absence of the edge spin-orbit interaction, edge\nstates are described by a single real parameter whose sign determines whether\ntheir spectra intersect the bulk gap or not. In the former case we show that\nillumination by circularly polarised light results in spin and valley polarised\nphotocurrent along the edge. Flow direction, spin and valley polarisation of\nthe edge photocurrent are determined by the direction of circular polarisation\nof the illuminated light.\n", "  We studied the distribution of dense gas in a filamentary molecular cloud\ncontaining several dense clumps. The center of the filament is given by the\ndense clump WB673. The clumps are high-mass and intermediate-mass star-forming\nregions. We observed CS(2-1), 13CO(1-0), C18O(1-0) and methanol lines at 96GHz\ntoward WB673 with the Onsala Space Observatory 20-m telescope. We found CS(2-1)\nemission in the inter-clump medium so the clumps are physically connected and\nthe whole cloud is indeed a filament. Its total mass is $10^4$ M$_{\\odot}$ and\nmass-to-length ratio is 360 M$_{\\odot}$pc$^{-1}$ from 13CO(1-0) data.\nMass-to-length ratio for the dense gas is $3.4-34$ M$_{\\odot}$pc$^{-1}$ from\nCS(2-1) data. The PV-diagram of the filament is V-shaped. We estimated physical\nconditions in the molecular gas using methanol lines. Location of the filament\non the sky between extended shells suggests that it could be a good example to\ntest theoretical models of formation of the filaments via multiple compression\nof interstellar gas by supersonic waves.\n", "  The inference of Ying et al. [EPL 104, 67005 (2013)] of a composition-induced\nchange from c-axis ordered-moment alignment in a collinear A-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) structure (AFMI) at small x to ab-plane alignment in an\nunknown AFM structure (AFMII) at larger x in Ca(1-x)Sr(x)Co(2-y)As(2) with the\nbody-centered tetragonal ThCr2Si2 structure is confirmed. Our major finding is\nan anomalous magnetic behavior in the crossover region 0.2 < x < 0.3 between\nthese two phases. In this region the magnetic susceptibility versus temperature\nchi_ab(T) measured with magnetic fields H applied in the ab plane exhibit\ntypical AFM behaviors with cusps at the Neel temperatures of about 65 K,\nwhereas chi_c(T) and the low-temperature isothermal magnetization M_c(H) with H\naligned along the c axis exhibit extremely soft ferromagnetic-like behaviors.\n", "  Chirality plays an important role in physics, chemistry, biology, and other\nfields. It describes an essential symmetry in structure. However, chirality\ninvariants are usually complicated in expression or difficult to evaluate. In\nthis paper, we present five general three-dimensional chirality invariants\nbased on the generating functions. And the five chiral invariants have four\ncharacteristics:(1) They play an important role in the detection of symmetry,\nespecially in the treatment of 'false zero' problem. (2) Three of the five\nchiral invariants decode an universal chirality index. (3) Three of them are\nproposed for the first time. (4) The five chiral invariants have low order no\nbigger than 4, brief expression, low time complexity O(n) and can act as\ndescriptors of three-dimensional objects in shape analysis. The five chiral\ninvariants give a geometric view to study the chiral invariants. And the\nexperiments show that the five chirality invariants are effective and\nefficient, they can be used as a tool for symmetry detection or features in\nshape analysis.\n", "  In late 2016 and early 2017 the flat spectrum radio quasar CTA 102 exhibited\na very strong and long-lasting outburst. The event can be described by a\nroughly 2 months long increase of the baseline flux in the monitored energy\nbands (optical to $\\gamma$ rays) by a factor 8, and a subsequent decrease over\nanother 2 months back to pre-flare levels. The long-term trend was superseded\nby short but very strong flares, resulting in a peak flux that was a factor 50\nabove pre-flare levels in the $\\gamma$-ray domain and almost a factor 100 above\npre-flare levels in the optical domain. In this paper we explain the long-term\nevolution of the outburst by the ablation of a gas cloud penetrating the\nrelativistic jet. The slice-by-slice ablation results in a gradual increase of\nthe particle injection until the center of the cloud is reached, after which\nthe injected number of particles decreases again. With reasonable cloud\nparameters we obtain excellent fits of the long-term trend.\n", "  We use spatially resolved spectroscopy from the Calar Alto Legacy Field Area\n(CALIFA) survey to study the nature of the line emitting gas in galaxies of\ndifferent Hubble types, focusing on the separation of star-forming (SF) regions\nfrom those better characterized as diffuse ionized gas (DIG). The diagnosis is\ncarried out in terms of the equivalent width of ${\\rm H}\\alpha$ ($W_{{\\rm\nH}\\alpha}$). Three nebular regimes are identified. Regions where $W_{{\\rm\nH}\\alpha} < 3\\ \\AA$ define what we call the hDIG, the component of the DIG\nwhere photoionization is dominated by hot, low-mass, evolved stars. Regions\nwhere $W_{{\\rm H}\\alpha} > 14\\ \\AA$ trace SF complexes. $W_{{\\rm H}\\alpha}$\nvalues in the intermediate 3--14 $\\AA$ range reflect a mixed regime (mDIG)\nwhere more than one process contributes. This three-tier scheme is inspired\nboth by theoretical and empirical considerations. Its application to CALIFA\ngalaxies of different types and inclinations leads to the following results:\n$\\textit{(i)}$ the hDIG component is prevalent throughout ellipticals and S0's\nas well as in bulges, and explains the strongly bimodal distribution of\n$W_{{\\rm H}\\alpha}$ both among and within galaxies. $\\textit{(ii)}$ Early-type\nspirals have some hDIG in their discs, but this component becomes progressively\nless relevant for later Hubble types. $\\textit{(iii)}$ hDIG emission is also\npresent above and below galactic discs, as seen in several edge-on spirals in\nour sample. $\\textit{(iv)}$ The SF/mDIG proportion grows steadily from early-\nto late-type spirals, and from inner to outer radii. $\\textit{(v)}$ Besides\ncircumventing basic inconsistencies in conventional DIG/SF separation criteria\nbased on the ${\\rm H}\\alpha$ surface brightness, our $W_{{\\rm H}\\alpha}$-based\nmethod produces results in agreement with a classical excitation diagram\nanalysis.\n", "  The deformability of soft condensed matter often requires modelling of\nhydrodynamical aspects to gain quantitative understanding. This, however,\nrequires specialised methods that can resolve the multiscale nature of soft\nmatter systems. We review a number of the most popular simulation methods that\nhave emerged, such as Langevin dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics,\nmulti-particle collision dynamics, sometimes also referred to as stochastic\nrotation dynamics, and the lattice-Boltzmann method. We conclude this review\nwith a short glance at current compute architectures for high-performance\ncomputing and community codes for soft matter simulation.\n", "  We present an interacting model for the electronic and magnetic behavior of a\nstrained $(001)$ atomic layer of Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6,$ which shows room-temperature\nferrimagnetism and magnetoresistance with potential spintronics application in\nthe bulk. We find that the strong spin-orbit coupling in the molybdenum 4$d$\nshell gives rise to a robust ferrimagnetic state with an emergent\nspin-polarized electronic structure consisting of flat bands and four massive\nor massless Dirac dispersions. Based on the spin-wave theory, we demonstrate\nthat the magnetic order remains intact for a wide range of doping, leading to\nthe possibility of exploring flat band physics, such as Wigner crystallization\nin electron-doped Sr$_{2-x}$La$_{x}$FeMoO$_6.$\n", "  The Spin Asymmetries of the Nucleon Experiment (SANE) performed inclusive,\ndouble-polarized electron scattering measurements of the proton at the\nContinuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility at Jefferson Lab. A novel\ndetector array observed scattered electrons of four-momentum transfer $2.5 <\nQ^2< 6.5$ GeV$^2$ and Bjorken scaling $0.3<x<0.8$ from initial beam energies of\n4.7 and 5.9 GeV. Employing a polarized proton target whose magnetic field\ndirection could be rotated with respect to the incident electron beam, both\nparallel and near perpendicular spin asymmetries were measured, allowing\nmodel-independent access to transverse polarization observables $A_1$, $A_2$,\n$g_1$, $g_2$ and moment $d_2$ of the proton. This document summarizes the\noperation and performance of the polarized target, polarized electron beam, and\nnovel detector systems used during the course of the experiment, and describes\nanalysis techniques utilized to access the physics observables of interest.\n", "  A lot of seismic phenomena with small magnitude has been taking place in the\nLadoga lake region. One of them is the earthquake which was recorded on the\n31$^\\text{th}$ of July, 2010 followed by an earthquake swarm near Nikonovsky\ncape. There is only one station in the region that is why it is difficult to\nprocess the data. In this work we propose a new method for obtaining main event\nfocal mechanism and constructing the synthetic seismograms for this event. The\ndata of swarm events is used to test the method of constructing synthetic\nseismograms and the data of close events to determine the parameters of the\nmedia. Since the amplitude of the wave P is close to zero, the location of the\nnodal plane can be submitted. That is the reason why we can find the focal\nmechanism for the earthquake using data of the single seismostation. Resulting\nfault plane has the same inclination as known tectonics line which the\nearthquake source is placed on. Our proposed method is based on Green function\nmethod with using several kinds of sources and temporal $\\delta$-shaped\nsequences.\n", "  With the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) routinely\noperating science flights, we demonstrate that observations with the Faint\nObject infraRed CAmera for the SOFIA Telescope (FORCAST) can provide reliable\nestimates of the internal luminosities, $L_{\\rm int}$, of protostars. We have\ndeveloped a technique to estimate $L_{\\rm int}$ using a pair of FORCAST\nfilters: one \"short-wavelength\" filter centered within 19.7-25.3 $\\mu$m, and\none \"long-wavelength\" filter within 31.5-37.1 $\\mu$m. These $L_{\\rm int}$\nestimates are reliable to within 30-40% for 67% of protostars and to within a\nfactor of 2.3-2.6 for 99% of protostars. The filter pair comprised of\nF25.3$\\mu$m and F37.1$\\mu$m achieves the best sensitivity and most constrained\nresults. We evaluate several assumptions that could lead to systematic\nuncertainties. The OH5 dust opacity matches observational constraints for\nprotostellar environments best, though not perfectly; we find that any improved\ndust model will have a small impact of 5-10% on the $L_{\\rm int}$ estimates.\nFor protostellar envelopes, the TSC84 model yields masses that are twice those\nof the Ulrich model, but we conclude this mass difference does not\nsignificantly impact results at the mid-infrared wavelengths probed by FORCAST.\nThus, FORCAST is a powerful instrument for luminosity studies targeting newly\ndiscovered protostars or suspected protostars lacking detections longward of 24\n$\\mu$m. Furthermore, with its dynamic range and greater angular resolution,\nFORCAST may be used to characterize protostars that were either saturated or\nmerged with other sources in previous surveys using the Spitzer Space Telescope\nor Herschel Space Observatory.\n", "  Fractures are ubiquitous in the subsurface and strongly affect flow and\ndeformation. The physical shape of the fractures, they are long and thin\nobjects, puts strong limitations on how the effect of this dynamics can be\nincorporated into standard reservoir simulation tools. This paper reports the\ndevelopment of an open-source software framework, termed PorePy, which is aimed\nat simulation of flow and transport in three-dimensional fractured reservoirs,\nas well as deformation of the reservoir due to shearing along fracture and\nfault planes. Starting from a description of fractures as polygons embedded in\na 3D domain, PorePy provides semi-automatic gridding to construct a\ndiscrete-fracture-matrix model, which forms the basis for subsequent\nsimulations. PorePy allows for flow and transport in all lower-dimensional\nobjects, including planes (2D) representing fractures, and lines (1D) and\npoints (0D), representing fracture intersections. Interaction between processes\nin neighboring domains of different dimension is implemented as a sequence of\ncouplings of objects one dimension apart. This readily allows for handling of\ncomplex fracture geometries compared to capabilities of existing software. In\naddition to flow and transport, PorePy provides models for rock mechanics,\nporo-elasticity and coupling with fracture deformation models. The software is\nfully open, and can serve as a framework for transparency and reproducibility\nof simulations. We describe the design principles of PorePy from a user\nperspective, with focus on possibilities within gridding, covered physical\nprocesses and available discretizations. The power of the framework is\nillustrated with two sets of simulations; involving respectively coupled flow\nand transport in a fractured porous medium, and low-pressure stimulation of a\ngeothermal reservoir.\n", "  In this study, inspired by the work of K. Nakazato and K. Kitahara [Prog.\nTheor. Phys. 64, 2261 (1980)], we consider the theoretical problem of tracer\nparticle diffusion in an environment of diffusing hardcore interacting crowder\nparticles. The tracer particle has a different diffusion constant from the\ncrowder particles. Based on a transformation of the generating function, we\nprovide an exact formal expansion for the tracer particle probability density,\nvalid for any lattice in the thermodynamic limit. By applying this formal\nsolution to dynamics on regular Bravais lattices we provide a closed form\napproximation for the tracer particle diffusion constant which extends the\nNakazato and Kitahara results to include also b.c.c. and f.c.c. lattices.\nFinally, we compare our analytical results to simulations in two and three\ndimensions.\n", "  In the present work, a combined theoretical and experimental study on\nCo$_{2}$PtGa Heusler alloy shows that it exhibits a martensite transition\naround 1320 K with a small thermal hysteresis (10 K). Dynamical stability of\nCo$_2$PtGa in the tetragonal phase has been established by the theoretically\ncalculated phonon dispersion curves. Magnetization measurements suggest that\nthis alloy is a ferromagnetic material with a saturation magnetic moment of\n2.83 $\\mu_B$/f.u. at 2 K, which is in excellent agreement with the value\nobtained from \\textit{ab-initio} calculations (2.87 $\\mu_B$/f.u.). Our present\nstudy demonstrates that Co$_{2}$PtGa is a promising material for high\ntemperature magnetic shape memory application.\n", "  We discuss the contribution of magnetic Skyrmions to the Hall viscosity and\npropose a simple way to identify it in experiments. The topological Skyrmion\ncharge density has a distinct signature in the electric Hall conductivity that\nis identified in existing experimental data. In an electrically neutral system,\nthe Skyrmion charge density is directly related to the thermal Hall\nconductivity. These results are direct consequences of the field theory Ward\nidentities, which relate various physical quantities based on symmetries and\nhave been previously applied to quantum Hall systems.\n", "  Neutrinos are key astronomical messengers, because they are undeflected by\nmagnetic field and unattenuated by electromagnetic interaction. After the first\ndetection of extraterrestrial neutrinos in the TeV-PeV region by Neutrino\nTelescopes we are entering a new epoch where neutrino astronomy becomes\npossible. In this paper I briefly review the main issues concerning\ncosmological neutrinos and their experimental observation.\n", "  Classical and quantum field theory of dipolar, axisymmetric quadrupolar and\noctupolar Bose gases is considered within a general approach. Dipole,\naxisymmetric quadrupole and octupole interaction potentials in the momentum\nrepresentation are calculated. These results clearly demonstrate attraction and\nrepulsion areas in corresponding gases. Then the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP)\nequation, which plays a key role in the present paper, is derived from the\ncorresponding functional. The zoology of the form factors appearing in GP\nequation is studied in details. The classes of proper for the description of\nspatially non-uniform condensates form factors are chosen. In the Thomas-Fermi\napproximation a general solution of the GP equation with a quasilocal form\nfactor is obtained. This solution has an interesting form in terms of a double\nrapidly converging series that universally includes all the interactions\nconsidered. An important analysis of the condensate stability, in other words\nthe study of condensate excitations, is also performed in this paper. In the\nGaussian approximation (from the GP functional), a functional describing the\nperturbations of the condensate is derived in details. For a probe wave\nfunction in the form of a plane wave, a spectrum of Bogoliubov excitations was\nobtained, from which an equation describing the threshold momentum for the\nemergence of instability was derived. An important result of this paper is the\ndependence of the threshold on the momentum of a stationary condensate. For\ncompleteness of the presentation, the approximating expression in the form of a\nrapidly converging series is obtained for the corresponding dependence.\nFinally, in the conclusion a quantum hydrodynamic theory for dipolar,\naxisymmetric quadrupolar and octupolar gases is briefly presented, giving a\nclue to the experimental determination of the form factors.\n", "  Due to miniaturization of device dimensions, the next generations\nphotodetector based devices are expected to be fabricated from robust\nnanostructured materials. Hence there is an utmost requirement of investigating\nexotic optoelectronic properties of nanodevices fabricated from new novel\nmaterials and testing their performances at harsh conditions. The recent\nadvances on 2D layered materials indicate exciting progress on broad spectral\nphotodetection (BSP) but still there is a great demand for fabricating\nultra-high performance photodetectors made from single material sensing broad\nelectromagnetic spectrum since the detection range 325 nm to 1550 nm is not\ncovered by the conventional Si or InGaAs photodetectors. Alternatively, Bi2Te3\nis a layered material, possesses exciting optoelectronic, thermoelectric,\nplasmonics properties. Here we report robust photoconductivity measurements on\nBi2Te3 nanosheets and nanowires demonstrating BSP from UV to NIR. The\nnanosheets of Bi2Te3 show the best ultra-high photoresponsivity (~74 A/W at\n1550 nm ). Further these nanosheets when transform into nanowires using harsh\nFIB milling conditions exhibit about one order enhancement in the\nphotoresponsivity without affecting the performance of the device even after 4\nmonths of storage at ambient conditions. An ultra-high photoresponsivity and\nBSP indicate exciting robust nature of topological insulator based nanodevices\nfor optoelectronic applications.\n", "  In this paper, a micro-mechanical model is introduce to characterize the\nstress softening phenomenon in double network hydrogels. Damage in polymer\nmatrices under deformation, which appears as the rupture of cross-linking, is\nassumed to result in stress softening. The evolution of a polymer matrix is\ndescribed with the network evolution method by Dargazany and Itskov [Dargazany\nand Itskov, International Journal of Solids and Structures, 2009, 46, 2967].\nThe model includes a number of physically-motivated material parameters and\nobtains good agreement against different sets of experimental data of uniaxial\ncyclic tension tests.\n", "  Charmed and beauty hadrons in matter are discussed within a unitarized\ncoupled-channel model consistent with heavy-quark spin symmetry. We analyse the\nformation of D-mesic states as well as the propagation of charmed and beauty\nhadrons in heavy-ion collisions from LHC to FAIR energies.\n", "  We demonstrate explicitly the correspondence between all protected operators\nin a 2+1 dimensional non-supersymmetric bosonization duality in the\nnon-relativistic limit. Roughly speaking we consider $SU(N)$ Chern-Simons field\ntheory at level $k$ with $N_f$ flavours of fundamental boson, and match its\nchiral sector to that of a $SU(k)$ theory at level $N$ with $N_f$ fundamental\nfermions. We present the matching at the level of indices and individual\noperators, seeing the mechanism of failure for $N_f > N$, and point out that\nthe non-relativistic setting is a particularly friendly setting for studying\ninteresting questions about such dualities.\n", "  We search for microlensing events in the highly reddened areas surrounding\nthe Galactic center using the near-IR observations with the VISTA Variables in\nthe V\\'ia L\\'actea Survey (VVV). We report the discovery of 182 new\nmicrolensing events, based on observations acquired between 2010 and 2015. We\npresent the color-magnitude diagrams of the microlensing sources for the VVV\ntiles b332, b333, and b334, which were independently analyzed, and show good\nqualitative agreement among themselves. We detect an excess of microlensing\nevents in the central tile b333 in comparison with the other two tiles,\nsuggesting that the microlensing optical depth keeps rising all the way to the\nGalactic center. We derive the Einstein radius crossing time for all of the\nobserved events. The observed event timescales range from $t_E = 5$ to $200$\ndays. The resulting timescale distribution shows a mean timescale of\n$<t_E>=30.91$ days for the complete sample ($N = 182$ events), and\n$<t_E>=29.93$ days if restricted only for the red clump (RC) giant sources ($N\n= 96$ RC events). There are 20 long timescale events ($t_E \\geq 100$ days) that\nsuggest the presence of massive lenses (black holes) or disk-disk event. This\nwork demonstrates that the VVV Survey is a powerful tool to detect\nintermediate/long timescale microlensing events in highly reddened areas, and\nit enables a number of future applications, from analyzing individual events to\ncomputing the statistics for the inner Galactic mass and kinematic\ndistributions, in aid of future ground- and space-based experiments.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the spectral properties of the bilayer graphene\nwith the local excitonic pairing interaction between the electrons and holes.\nWe consider the generalized Hubbard model, which includes both intralayer and\ninterlayer Coulomb interaction parameters. The solution of the excitonic gap\nparameter is used to calculate the electronic band structure, single-particle\nspectral functions, the hybridization gap, and the excitonic coherence length\nin the bilayer graphene. We show that the local interlayer Coulomb interaction\nis responsible for the semimetal-semiconductor transition in the double layer\nsystem, and we calculate the hybridization gap in the band structure above the\ncritical interaction value. The formation of the excitonic band gap is reported\nas the threshold process and the momentum distribution functions have been\ncalculated numerically. We show that in the weak coupling limit the system is\ngoverned by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-like pairing state. Contrary,\nin the strong coupling limit the excitonic condensate states appear in the\nsemiconducting phase, by forming the Dirac's pockets in the reciprocal space.\n", "  Developing a theory that can describe everything in the universe is of great\ninterest, and is closely relevant to M-theory, neutrino oscillation and\ncharge-parity (CP) violation. Although M-theory is claimed as a grand unified\ntheory, it has not been tested by any direct experiment. Here we show that\nexisting neutrino oscillation experimental data supports one kind of high\ndimensional unified theory, such as M-theory. We propose a generalization of\nthe tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing ansatz, and we find that the latest neutrino\noscillation experimental data constraints dimension in a range between 10.46\nand 12.93 containing 11, which is an important prediction of M-theory. This\nansatz naturally incorporates the fractal feature of the universe and leptonic\nCP violation into the resultant scenario of \\textit{fractal} nearly\ntri-bimaximal flavor mixing. We also analyze the consequences of this new\nansatze on the latest experimental data of neutrino oscillations, and this\ntheory matches the experimental data. Furthermore, an approach to construct\nlepton mass matrices in fractal universe under permutation symmetry is\ndiscussed. The proposed theory opens an unexpected window on the physics beyond\nthe Standard Model.\n", "  In this report, we present an unsupervised machine learning method for\ndetermining groups of molecular systems according to similarity in their\ndynamics or structures using Ward's minimum variance objective function. We\nfirst apply the minimum variance clustering to a set of simulated tripeptides\nusing the information theoretic Jensen-Shannon divergence between Markovian\ntransition matrices in order to gain insight into how point mutations affect\nprotein dynamics. Then, we extend the method to partition two chemoinformatic\ndatasets according to structural similarity to motivate a train/validation/test\nsplit for supervised learning that avoids overfitting.\n", "  Ice-templating is a well-established processing route for porous ceramics.\nBecause of the structure/properties relationships, it is essential to better\nunderstand and control the solidification microstructures. Ice-templating is\nbased on the segregation and concentration of particles by growing ice\ncrystals. What we understand so far of the process is based on either\nobservations by optical or X-ray imaging techniques, or on the characterization\nof ice-templated materials. However, in situ observations at particle-scale are\nstill missing. Here we show that confocal microscopy can provide multiphase\nimaging of ice growth and the segregation and organization of particles. We\nillustrate the benefits of our approach with the observation of particles and\npore ice in the frozen structure, the dynamic evolution of the freeze front\nmorphology, and the impact of PVA addition on the solidification\nmicrostructures. These results prove in particular the importance of\ncontrolling both the temperature gradient and the growth rate during\nice-templating.\n", "  A new TWOPEG-D version of the event generator TWOPEG was developed. This new\nversion simulates the quasi-free process of double-pion electroproduction off\nthe proton that moves in the deuteron target. The underlying idea is the\nequivalence of the moving proton experiment performed with fixed laboratory\nbeam energy to the proton at rest experiment conducted with effective beam\nenergy different from the laboratory one. This effective beam energy differs\nevent by event and is determined by the boost from the Lab system to the proton\nrest frame. The Fermi momentum of the target proton is generated according to\nthe Bonn potential. The specific aspects of the deuteron target data analysis\nare discussed. The plots that illustrate the performance of TWOPEG-D are given.\nThe link to the code is provided. The generator was tested in the analysis of\nthe CLAS data on electron scattering off the deuteron target.\n", "  This paper presents a discrete time probabilistic dynamic for simulating a\ncontact-based epidemic spreading based on discrete time Markov chain process,\nin particular the attention is addressed to the susceptible-infectious-removed\n(SIR) model and the phase diagram of such model will be presented. Then, this\nreport presents the set of equations that represent the optimal control\nstrategies, by the means of Pontryagin's maximum principle, in two different\ncases a vaccination policy and a combined vaccination-hospitalization policy\nand show a numerical simulation, with the standard forward-backward sweep\nprocedure, for these equations.\n", "  The theory of perfect crystals, founded upon the Bloch theorem, gives an\nunderstanding of extended quantum states grouped into energy bands, and permits\nthe derivation of the dynamics of electrons in those states. The semiconductor\nphysics used to explain the operation of electronic devices treats the\n(imperfect) semiconductor crystal as a uniform effective medium in which\npositively and negatively charged quasi-particles mostly obey Newtonian\ndynamics, and in which the chemistry of impurity atoms is far different from\nthat of those same atoms in free space. The connection between these two\npictures can be made by made by invoking a mathematical transformation that\ntakes the finite-temperature, impure device structure and algebraically\nsubtracts from it a perfect crystal, leaving only the residual differences to\nbe analyzed. This notion of the residual difference offers a conceptual basis\nfor understanding many aspects of semiconductor physics, including the\nproperties of impurity states and heterogeneous interfaces. The mesoscopic\ntransformation that underlies the residual-difference picture provides the\nsystematic way to define a concept that is essential to the understanding of\nsemiconductor devices: a position-dependent band structure.\n", "  This is a write-up of lectures on integrable sigma-models, which covers the\nfollowing topics: (1) Homogeneous spaces, (2) Classical integrability of\nsigma-models in two dimensions, (3) Topological terms, (4) Background-field\nmethod and beta-function, (5) S-matrix bootstrap in the O(N) model, (6)\nSupersymmetric cosets and strings on AdS(d)xX.\n", "  Peculiarities of the focusing and overfocusing of atoms sputtered from the\nsurface of (001) Ni face are studied with the use of molecular dynamics\ncomputer simulations. It is discovered that the numbers of focused and\noverfocused sputtered atoms decrease under the transition of the (001) Ni face\nfrom the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic state. The evolution of the\ntwo-dimensional energy and polar angle resolved distributions of sputtered\natoms when changing the azimuthal angle and the binding energy of atoms at the\nsurface is investigated.\n", "  Active Plasma Resonance Spectroscopy (APRS) is a well known diagnostic\nmethod, where a radio frequency probe is immersed into a plasma and excites\nplasma oscillations. The response of the plasma is recorded as frequency\ndependent spectrum, in which resonance peaks occur. By means of a mathematical\nmodel plasma parameters like the electron density or the electron temperature\ncan be determined from the detected resonances. The majority of all APRS probes\nhave in common, that they are immersed into the plasma and perturb the plasma\ndue to the physical presence of the probe. To overcome this problem, the planar\nMultipole Resonance Probe (pMRP) was invented, which can be integrated into the\nchamber wall of a plasma reactor. Within this paper, the first analytic model\nof the pMRP is presented, which is based on a cold plasma description of the\nelectrons. The general admittance of the probe-plasma system is derived by\nmeans of functional analytic methods and a complete orthonormal set of basis\nfunctions. Explicit spectra for an approximated admittance including a\nconvergence study are shown. The determined resonance frequencies are in good\nagreement with former simulation results.\n", "  Semiconductor lasers capable of generating a vortex beam with a specific\norbital angular momentum (OAM) order are highly attractive for applications\nranging from nanoparticle manipulation, imaging and microscopy to fibre and\nquantum communications. In this work, an electrically pumped OAM laser\noperating at telecom wavelengths is fabricated by monolithically integrating an\noptical vortex emitter with a distributed feedback (DFB) laser on the same\nInGaAsP/InP epitaxial wafer. A single-step dry etching process is adopted to\ncomplete the OAM emitter, equipped with specially designed top gratings. The\nvortex beam emitted by the integrated laser is captured, and its OAM mode\npurity characterized. The electrically pumped OAM laser eliminates the external\nlaser required by silicon- or silicon-on-insulator (SOI)-based OAM emitters,\nthus demonstrating great potential for applications in communication systems\nand quantum domain.\n", "  This paper addresses the problem of regulating the output voltage of a DC-DC\nbuck-boost converter feeding a constant power load,which is a problem of\ncurrent practical interest. Designing a stabilising controller is theoretically\nchallenging because its average model is a bilinear second order system that,\ndue to the presence of the constant power load,is non- minimum phase with\nrespect to both states.Moreover,to design a high performance controller, the\nknowledge of the extracted load power, which is difficult to measure in\nindustrial applications, is required. In this paper, an adaptive\ninterconnection and damping assignment passivity based control that\nincorporates the immersion and invariance parameter estimator for the load\npower is proposed to solve the problem. Some detailed simulations are provided\nto validate the transient behaviour of the proposed controller and compare it\nwith the performance of a classical PD scheme.\n", "  In this paper, we study Hankel determinants generated from a perturbed\nLaguerre weight function, Under the double scaling scheme, we give the uniform\nasymptotic approximations of Hankel determinants in terms of a solution of a\nthird-order nonlinear differential equation, which is equivalent to a\nparticular Painleve V equation. In fact, this Painleve V equation is equivalent\nto the general Painleve III equation. The asymptotic approximations of the\nleading coefficients and the recurrence coefficients for the corresponding\northogonal polynomials also involve the painleve V equation. The asymptotic\nanalysis is based on our earlier results by using the Deift-Zhou nonlinear\nsteepest descent method.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the initial value problem for the complex short\npulse equation with a Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa type Lax pair.\n  We show that the solution to the initial value problem has a parametric\nexpression in terms of the solution of $2\\times 2$-matrix Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem, from which an implicit one-soliton solution is obtained on the\ndiscrete spectrum. While on the continuous spectrum we further establish the\nexplicit long-time asymptotic behavior of the non-soliton solution by using\nDeift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method.\n", "  The anisotropic distribution of satellites around the central galaxy of their\nhost halo is well-documented. However the relative impact of baryons and dark\nmatter in shaping this distribution is still debated. Using the simulation\nHorizon-AGN, the angular distribution of satellite galaxies with respect to\ntheir central counterpart and halo is quantified. Below one Rvir, satellites\ncluster more strongly in the plane of the central, rather than merely tracing\nthe shape of their host halo. This is due to the increased isotropy of inner\nhaloes acquired through their inside-out assembly in vorticity-rich flows along\nthe cosmic web. While the effect of centrals decreases with distance, halos'\ntriaxiality increases, impacting more and more the satellite's distribution.\nEffects become comparable just outside one virial radius. Above this scale, the\nfilamentary infall also impacts the satellites distribution, dominating above\ntwo virial radii. The central's morphology plays a governing role: the\nalignment w.r.t. the central plane is four times stronger in haloes hosting\nstellar discs than in spheroids. But the impact of the galactic plane decreases\nfor lower satellite-to-central mass ratios, suggesting this might not hold for\ndwarf satellites of the Local group. The orientation of the Milky-Way's\nsatellites traces their cosmic filament, their level of coplanarity is\nconsistent with systems of similar mass and cosmic location in Horizon-AGN.\nHowever, the strong impact of galactic planes in massive groups and clusters\nbounds the likelihood of finding a relaxed region where satellites can be used\nto infer halo shape. The minor-to-major axis ratios for haloes with\nlog(M0/Msun)>13.5 is underestimated by 10%. This error soars quickly to 30-40%\nfor individual halo measurements.\n", "  An alternative parameter $R_{J_z}$ is introduced as the ratio of one of two\nkinds of opposite-sign current to the total current and investigate the\nrelationship between the quantity and the hemispheric sign rule of helicity\n(HSR) that is established by a series of previous statistical studies. The\nclassification of current in each hemisphere is according to the following\nrule: If the product of the current and the corresponding longitudinal field\ncomponent contributes a consistent sign with reference to the HSR, it is called\n\"HSR-compliant\" current, or else it is called \"HSR-noncompliant\" current.\nFirstly, the consistence between the butterfly diagram of the $R_{J_z}$ and the\ncurrent helicity was obtained in a statistical study. Active regions with\n$R_{J_z}$ smaller than 0.5 tend to obey the HSR whereas those with $R_{J_z}$\ngreater than 0.5 tend to disobey the HSR. The \"HSR-compliant\" current systems\nhave 60\\% probability of realization compared to 40\\% of \"HSR-noncompliant\"\ncurrent systems. Overall, the HSR is violated for active regions in which the\n\"HSR-noncompliant\" current is greater than the \"HSR-compliant\" current.\nSecondly, the $R_{J_z}$ parameter was subsequently used to study the evolution\nof current systems in the case analyses of flare-productive active regions NOAA\nAR 11158 and 11283. It is found that there were \"$R_{J_z}$-quasi-stationary\"\nphase that is relatively flare quiescent and \"$R_{J_z}$-dynamic\" phase that is\ncovered by the occurrence of large flares.\n", "  Unsteady laminar vortex shedding over a circular cylinder is predicted using\na deep learning technique, a generative adversarial network (GAN), with a\nparticular emphasis on elucidating the potential of learning the solution of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. Numerical simulations at two different Reynolds\nnumbers with different time-step sizes are conducted to produce training\ndatasets of flow field variables. Unsteady flow fields in the future at a\nReynolds number which is not in the training datasets are predicted using a\nGAN. Predicted flow fields are found to qualitatively and quantitatively agree\nwell with flow fields calculated by numerical simulations. The present study\nsuggests that a deep learning technique can be utilized for prediction of\nlaminar wake flow in lieu of solving the Navier-Stokes equations.\n", "  The starting point of all NMR experiments is a spin polarization which\ndevelops when we place the sample in static magnetic field $B_0$. There are\nexcess of spins aligned along $B_0$ (spin up with lower energy) than spins\naligned opposite (spin down with higher energy) to the field $B_0$. A natural\nquestion is what is the source of this excess spin polarization because\nrelaxation mechanisms can flip a up spin to a down spin and vice-versa. The\nanswer lies in the density of states. When a molecule with spin down flips to\nspin up it loses energy. This energy goes into increasing the kinetic energy of\nthe molecule in the gas/solution phase. At this increased kinetic energy, there\nare more rotational-translational states accessible to the molecule than at\nlower energy. This increases the probability the molecule will spend in spin up\nstate (higher kinetic energy state). This is the source of excess polarization.\nIn this paper, we use an argument based on equipartition of energy to\nexplicitly count the excess states that become accessible to the molecule when\nits spin is flipped from down to up. Using this counting, we derive the\nfamiliar Boltzmann distribution of the ratio of up vs down spins. Although\nprima facie, there is nothing new in this paper, we find the mode counting\nargument for excess states interesting. Furthermore, the paper stresses the\nfact that spin polarization arises from higher density of states at increased\nkinetic energy of molecules.\n", "  Globular clusters are large collections of old stars that are orbiting the\ncore of a galaxy. Our Milky Way Galaxy has about 160 known clusters, with\nperhaps more to be discovered. We first accumulated the necessary parameters\nfor 16 clusters and ran a numerical model that predicts the inverse Compton\ngamma-ray flux expected from each cluster. We also reanalysed data from 16\nclusters observed by the H.E.S.S. very-high-energy (> 100 GeV) gamma-ray\ntelescopes. We confirmed the detection of Terzan 5 and found flux upper limits\nfor the remaining 15 sources that were consistent with published results. We\nattempted to constrain some source parameters using X-ray and gamma-ray data.\nWe lastly list the five most promising clusters for future observations by the\nCherenkov Telescope Array.\n", "  A metapopulation structure in landscape ecology comprises a group of\ninteracting spatially separated subpopulations or patches of the same species\nthat may experience several local extinctions. This makes the investigation of\nsurvivability (in the form of global oscillation) of a metapopulation on top of\ndiverse dispersal topologies extremely crucial. However, among various\ndispersal topologies in ecological networks, which one can provide higher\nmetapopulation survivability under local extinction is still not well explored.\nIn this article, we scrutinize the robustness of an ecological network\nconsisting of prey-predator patches having Holling type I functional response,\nagainst progressively extinct population patches. We present a comprehensive\nstudy on this while considering global, small-world and scale-free dispersal of\nthe subpopulations. Furthermore, we extend our work in enhancing survivability\nin the form of sustained global oscillation by introducing asymmetries in the\ndispersal rates of the considered species. Our findings affirm that the\nasynchrony among the patches plays an important role in the survivability of a\nmetapopulation. In order to demonstrate the model independence of the observed\nphenomenon, we perform a similar analysis for patches exhibiting Holling type\nII functional response. On the grounds of the obtained results, our work is\nexpected to provide a better perception of the influence of dispersal\narrangements on the global survivability of ecological networks.\n", "  Detection and identification of lipids are highly coveted for the\ninterrogation of chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and myocardial\ninfarction. Intravascular photoacoustic imaging (IVPA) and deep tissue imaging\nare modern techniques, which rely on complex near infrared (NIR) optical\nparametric oscillators (OPOs) and other high-power solid-state laser systems\nfor the diagnosis, which in turn make the systems bulky and expensive. In this\nwork, we propose a cost-effective directly modulated high pulse energy\nsupercontinuum source (operating in kHz regime) based on a standard optical\nfiber with pulse energy density as high as ~ 26 nJ/nm. We demonstrate how such\nsupercontinuum source combined with a tunable filter can be highly suitable for\nvibration-based photoacoustic imaging and spectroscopy of lipids in the\nmolecular overtone band of lipids (1650-1850 nm). We show the successful\ndiscrimination of two different lipids (cholesterol and lipid in adipose\ntissue) and the photoacoustic cross-sectional scan of lipid-rich adipose tissue\nat three different locations. The proposed high pulse energy supercontinuum\nlaser paves a new direction towards compact, broadband and cost-effective\nsource for multi-spectral spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging.\n", "  We identify all symmetry superalgebras $\\mathfrak{g}$ of near horizon\ngeometries of black holes with a Killing horizon, assuming the solution is\nsmooth and that the spatial cross section of the event horizon is compact\nwithout boundary. This includes all warped AdS$_2$ backgrounds with the most\ngeneral allowed fluxes in 10- and 11-dimensional supergravities. If the index\nof a particular Dirac operator vanishes, we find that the even symmetry\nsubalgebra decomposes as $\\mathfrak{g}_0=\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{R})\\oplus\n\\mathfrak{t}_0$, where $\\mathfrak{t}_0/\\mathfrak{c}$ is the Lie algebra of a\ngroup that acts transitively and effectively on spheres, and $\\mathfrak{c}$ is\nthe center of $\\mathfrak{g}$. If the Dirac operator index does not vanish, then\nthe symmetry superalgebra is nilpotent with one even generator. We also\ndemonstrate that there are no near horizon geometries, and also therefore no\nwarped AdS$_2$ backgrounds, in 10- and 11-dimensions that preserve more than 16\nsupersymmetries.\n", "  The 'double Dirac cone' 2D topological interface states found on the (001)\nfaces of topological crystalline insulators such as Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se\nfeature degeneracies located away from time reversal invariant momenta, and are\na manifestation of both mirror symmetry protection and valley interactions.\nSimilar shifted degeneracies in 1D interface states have been highlighted as a\npotential basis for a topological transistor, but realizing such a device will\nrequire a detailed understanding of the intervalley physics involved. In\naddition, the operation of this or similar devices outside of ultra-high vacuum\nwill require encapsulation, and the consequences of this for the topological\ninterface state must be understood. Here we address both topics for the case of\n2D surface states using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We examine\nbulk Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$Se(001) crystals overgrown with PbSe, realizing\ntrivial/topological heterostructures. We demonstrate that the valley\ninteraction that splits the two Dirac cones at each $\\bar{X}$ is extremely\nsensitive to atomic-scale details of the surface, exhibiting non-monotonic\nchanges as PbSe deposition proceeds. This includes an apparent total collapse\nof the splitting for sub-monolayer coverage, eliminating the Lifshitz\ntransition. For a large overlayer thickness we observe quantized PbSe states,\npossibly reflecting a symmetry confinement mechanism at the buried topological\ninterface.\n", "  We consider the problem of Bayesian inference in the family of probabilistic\nmodels implicitly defined by stochastic generative models of data. In\nscientific fields ranging from population biology to cosmology, low-level\nmechanistic components are composed to create complex generative models. These\nmodels lead to intractable likelihoods and are typically non-differentiable,\nwhich poses challenges for traditional approaches to inference. We extend\nprevious work in \"inference compilation\", which combines universal\nprobabilistic programming and deep learning methods, to large-scale scientific\nsimulators, and introduce a C++ based probabilistic programming library called\nCPProb. We successfully use CPProb to interface with SHERPA, a large code-base\nused in particle physics. Here we describe the technical innovations realized\nand planned for this library.\n", "  This is a book for absolute beginners. If you have heard about random matrix\ntheory, commonly denoted RMT, but you do not know what that is, then welcome!,\nthis is the place for you. Our aim is to provide a truly accessible\nintroductory account of RMT for physicists and mathematicians at the beginning\nof their research career. We tried to write the sort of text we would have\nloved to read when we were beginning Ph.D. students ourselves. Our book is\nstructured with light and short chapters, and the style is informal. The\ncalculations we found most instructive are spelt out in full. Particular\nattention is paid to the numerical verification of most analytical results. Our\nbook covers standard material - classical ensembles, orthogonal polynomial\ntechniques, spectral densities and spacings - but also more advanced and modern\ntopics - replica approach and free probability - that are not normally included\nin elementary accounts on RMT. This book is dedicated to the fond memory of\nOriol Bohigas.\n", "  Computational chemistry is a powerful tool for the discovery of novel\nmaterials. In particular, it is used to simulate ionic liquids in search of\nelectrolytes for electrochemical applications. Herein, the choice of the\ncomputational method is not trivial, as it has to be both efficient and\naccurate. Density functional theory (DFT) methods with appropriate corrections\nfor the systematic weaknesses can give precision close to that of the\npost-Hartree--Fock coupled cluster methods with a fraction of their cost.\nThence, we have evaluated the performance of a recently developed non-empirical\nStrongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional on\nelectronic structure calculations of ionic liquid ion pairs. The performance of\nSCAN and other popular functionals (PBE, M06-L, B2PLYP) among with Grimme's\ndispersion correction and Boys-Bernardi basis set superposition error\ncorrection was compared to DLPNO-CCSD(T)/CBS. We show that SCAN reproduces\ncoupled-cluster results for describing the employed dataset of 48 ion pairs.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically that ultrafast heating of metal nanoparticles by\nthe laser pulse should lead to the generation of coherent terahertz (THz)\nradiation during the heat redistribution process. It is shown that after the\nfemtosecond laser pulse action the time-dependent gradient of the electronic\ntemperature induces low-frequency particle polarization with the characteristic\ntimescale of about fractions of picosecond. In the case of the directed\nmetallic pattern, the THz pulse waveform can be controlled by changing geometry\nof the individual particle. The generation mechanism proposed in this Letter\ncan be used for interpretation of the recent experiments on the THz generation\nfrom metallic nanoparticles and nanostructures.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional Hubbard model with the Rashba type spin-orbit\ncoupling within and beyond the mean-field theory. The antiferromagnetic ground\nstate for the model at half-filling and the Cooper pairing induced by\nantiferromagnetic spin fluctuations near half-filling are examined based on the\nrandom-phase approximation. We show that the antiferromagnetic order is\nsuppressed and the magnetic susceptibility turns out to be anisotropic in the\npresence of the spin-orbit coupling. Energy spectrums of transverse spin\nfluctuations are obtained and the effective interactions between holes mediated\nby antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations are deduced in the case of low hole\ndoping. It seems that the spin-orbit coupling tends to form s+p-wave Cooper\npairs, while the s+d-wave pairing is dominant when the spin-orbit coupling is\nabsent.\n", "  The hallmark of superfluidity is the appearance of metastable flow-states\nthat carry a persistent circulating current. Considering Bose-Hubbard\nsuperfluid rings, we clarify the role of \"quantum chaos\" in this context. We\nshow that the standard Landau and Bogoliubov superfluidity criteria fail for\nsuch low-dimensional circuits. We also discuss the feasibility for a coherent\noperation of a SQUID-like setup. Finally, we address the manifestation of the\nstrong many-body dynamical localization effect.\n", "  As the increasing complexity of large-scale research requires the combined\nefforts of scientists with expertise in different fields, the advantages and\ncosts of interdisciplinary scholarship have taken center stage in current\ndebates on scientific production. Here we conduct a comparative assessment of\nthe scientific success of specialized and interdisciplinary researchers in\nmodern science. Drawing on comprehensive data sets on scientific production, we\npropose a two-pronged approach to interdisciplinarity. For each scientist, we\ndistinguish between background interdisciplinarity, rooted in knowledge\naccumulated over time, and social interdisciplinarity, stemming from exposure\nto collaborators' knowledge. We find that, while abandoning specialization in\nfavor of moderate degrees of background interdisciplinarity deteriorates\nperformance, very interdisciplinary scientists outperform specialized ones, at\nall career stages. Moreover, successful scientists tend to intensify the\nheterogeneity of collaborators and to match the diversity of their network with\nthe diversity of their background. Collaboration sustains performance by\nfacilitating knowledge diffusion, acquisition and creation. Successful\nscientists tend to absorb a larger fraction of their collaborators' knowledge,\nand at a faster pace, than less successful ones. Collaboration also provides\nsuccessful scientists with opportunities for the cross-fertilization of ideas\nand the synergistic creation of new knowledge. These results can inspire\nscientists to shape successful careers, research institutions to develop\neffective recruitment policies, and funding agencies to award grants of\nenhanced impact.\n", "  The valley pseudospin in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nhas been proposed as a new way to manipulate information in various\noptoelectronic devices. This relies on a large valley polarization that remains\nstable over long timescales (hundreds of ns). However, time resolved\nmeasurements report valley lifetimes of only a few ps. This has been attributed\nto mechanisms such as phonon-mediated inter-valley scattering and a precession\nof the valley psedospin through electron-hole exchange. Here we use transient\nspin grating to directly measure the valley depolarization lifetime in\nmonolayer MoSe$_{2}$. We find a fast valley decay rate that scales linearly\nwith the excitation density at different temperatures. This establishes the\npresence of strong exciton-exciton Coulomb exchange interactions enhancing the\nvalley depolarization. Our work highlights the microscopic processes inhibiting\nthe efficient use of the exciton valley pseudospin in monolayer TMDs.\n", "  The luminosity function (LF) for stars is here fitted by a Schechter function\nand by a Gamma probability density function. The dependence of the number of\nstars on the distance, both in the low and high luminosity regions, requires\nthe inclusion of a lower and upper boundary in the Schechter and Gamma LFs.\nThree astrophysical applications for stars are provided: deduction of the\nparameters at low distances, behavior of the average absolute magnitude with\ndistance, and the location of the photometric maximum as a function of the\nselected flux. The use of the truncated LFs allows to model the Malmquist bias.\n", "  We suggest a way to produce higher-energy superposition states in a circular\nsystem of quantum wells. This is inspired by a link to convergence results for\ngeometric transformations of polygons using circulant Hermitian matrices.\n", "  Performing high accuracy hybrid functional calculations for condensed matter\nsystems containing a large number of atoms is at present computationally very\ndemanding - when not out of reach - if high quality basis sets are used. We\npresent a highly efficient multiple GPU implementation of the exact exchange\noperator which allows hybrid functional density-functional theory calculations\nwith systematic basis sets without additional approximations for up to a\nthousand atoms. This method is implemented in a portable real-space-based\nalgorithm, released as an open-source package. With such a framework hybrid DFT\ncalculations of high quality become accessible on state-of-the-art\nsupercomputers within a time-to-solution of the same order of magnitude as\ntraditional semilocal-GGA functionals.\n", "  Residual stresses in a thin film deposited on a substrate results in a\ncurvature of the system, which can be measured using the well known Stoney\nequation. Isotropic elasticity of the substrate along with infinitesimal\nstrains and rotations are two important assumptions used in the derivation of\nthe Stoney equation. However, the transverse deflection in the substrate\ncontributes significantly to the extensional strain in its plane, leading to\nnon-linearity in its deformation. Moreover, Silicon wafers are predominantly\nused as substrate materials to measure the curvature of the system. In this\npaper, relations between normalized substrate curvature and normalized thin\nfilm mismatch are derived in the non-linear deformation regime, for substrates\nmade of single crystal Si(001) and Si(111) wafers. Numerical results of\ncurvature of thin film configurations with Si(001) and Si(111) wafer\nsubstrates, undergoing large deformations are presented and discussed.\n", "  In this work, we examine the main cosmological effects derived from a\ntime-varying coupling ($\\bar{Q}$) between a dark matter (DM) fluid and a dark\nenergy (DE) fluid with time-varying DE equation state (EoS) parameter\n($\\omega_{DE}$), in two different coupled DE models. These scenarios were built\nin terms of Chebyschev polynomials. Our results show that such models within\ndark sector can suffer an instability in their perturbations at early times and\na slight departure on the amplitude of the cosmic structure growth\n($f\\sigma_{8}$) from the standard background evolution of the matter. These\neffects depend on the form of both $\\bar{Q}$ and $\\omega_{DE}$. Here, we also\nperform a combined statistical analysis using current data to put tighter\nconstraints on the parameters space. Finally, we use some selections criteria\nto distinguish our models.\n", "  The Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events (CUORE) is the first\nbolometric experiment searching for neutrinoless double beta decay that has\nbeen able to reach the 1-ton scale. The detector consists of an array of 988\nTeO2 crystals arranged in a cylindrical compact structure of 19 towers. The\nconstruction of the experiment and, in particular, the installation of all\ntowers in the cryostat was completed in August 2016, followed by the cooldown\nto base temperature at the beginning of 2017. The CUORE detector is now\noperational and has been taking science data since Spring 2017. We present here\nthe initial performance of the detector and the preliminary results from the\nfirst detector run.\n", "  Accurate and robust models for the pressure strain correlation are an\nessential component for the success of Reynolds Stress Models in turbulent flow\nsimulations. However replicating the non-local action of pressure using only\nlocal tensors places a large limitation on potential model performance. In this\npaper we outline an approach that extends the tensor basis used for pressure\nstrain correlation modeling to formulate models with improved precision and\nrobustness. This set of additional tensors is analyzed and justified based on\nphysics based arguments and analysis of simulation data. Using these tensors\nmodels for the rapid and slow pressure strain correlation are developed. The\nresulting complete pressure strain correlation model is tested for a wide\nvariety of turbulent flows, while being contrasted against the predictions of\nestablished models. It is shown that the new model provides significant\nimprovement in prediction accuracy.\n", "  The DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is one of the four satellites\nwithin the Strategic Pioneer Research Program in Space Science of the Chinese\nAcademy of Science (CAS). The Silicon-Tungsten Tracker (STK), which is composed\nof 768 singled-sided silicon microstrip detectors, is one of the four\nsubdetectors in DAMPE, providing track reconstruction and charge identification\nfor relativistic charged particles. The charge response of DAMPE silicon\nmicrostrip detectors is complicated, depending on the incident angle and impact\nposition. A new charge reconstruction algorithm for the DAMPE silicon\nmicrostrip detector is introduced in this paper. This algorithm can correct the\ncomplicated charge response, and was proved applicable by the ion test beam.\n", "  We study the interpolation Macdonald functions, remarkable inhomogeneous\ngeneralizations of Macdonald functions, and a sequence $A^1, A^2, \\ldots$ of\ncommuting operators that are diagonalized by them. Such a sequence of operators\narises in the projective limit of finite families of commuting q-difference\noperators studied by Okounkov, Knop and Sahi. The main theorem is an explicit\nformula for the operators $A^k$. Our formula involves the family of\nHall-Littlewood functions and a new family of inhomogeneous Hall-Littlewood\nfunctions, for which we give an explicit construction and identify as a\ndegeneration of the interpolation Macdonald functions in the regime $q\n\\rightarrow 0$. This article is inspired by the recent papers of\nNazarov-Sklyanin on Macdonald and Sekiguchi-Debiard operators, and our main\ntheorem is an extension of their results.\n", "  For a class of $D=5$ holographic models we construct boomerang RG flow\nsolutions that start in the UV at an $AdS_5$ vacuum and end up at the same\nvacuum in the IR. The RG flows are driven by deformations by relevant operators\nthat explicitly break translation invariance. For specific models, such that\nthey admit another $AdS_5$ solution, $AdS_5^c$, we show that for large enough\ndeformations the RG flows approach an intermediate scaling regime with\napproximate conformal invariance governed by $AdS^c_5$. For these flows we\ncalculate the holographic entanglement entropy and the entropic $c$-function\nfor the RG flows. The latter is not monotonic, but it does encapsulate the\ndegrees of freedom in each scaling region. For a different set of models, we\nfind boomerang RG flows with intermediate scaling governed by an\n$AdS_2\\times\\mathbb{R}^3$ solution which breaks translation invariance.\nFurthermore, for large enough deformations these models have interesting and\nnovel thermal insulating ground states for which the entropy vanishes as the\ntemperature goes to zero, but not as a power-law. Remarkably, the thermal\ndiffusivity and the butterfly velocity for these new insulating ground states\nare related via $D=Ev^2_B/(2\\pi T)$, with $E(T)\\to 0.5$ as $T\\to 0$.\n", "  We investigate the role of the bulk eddy-viscosity variation on the\nwell-known log-layer mismatch problem. An analysis of the mean momentum-balance\nshows that the modeled stress term close to the wall can dominate because of\nthe bulk eddy-viscosity. Consequently, the momentum-balance equation lacks a\ndegree-of-freedom and the mean velocity conforms to an incorrect profile to\nsatisfy the momentum-balance. We show that zonal enforcement of the target mass\nflow-rate can be an effective strategy to introduce an additional degree of\nfreedom to the mean momentum-balance, which led to a significant reduction in\nthe log-layer mismatch. When the mass flow-rate is enforced zonally, the\nfiltered velocity field attains its own constant velocity-scale above the\nReynolds-averaged field, supporting the hypothesis that there exists an\nartificial boundary layer above the Reynolds-averaged region. We simulate\nturbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers of 2000 and 5200 on coarse\nmeshes that would put the first point away from the wall well into the\nlogarithmic layer. Second-order turbulence statistics and one-dimensional\nvelocity spectra agree well with the direct numerical simulation benchmark data\nwhen results are normalized by the velocity-scale extracted from the filtered\nvelocity field. Additionally, the error in the skin-friction coefficient for\nfriction Reynolds numbers of 2000 decreased from $14.1\\%$ to $2.5\\%$ when we\nenforced the mass flow-rate zonally.\n", "  The driven double-well Duffing oscillator is a well-studied system that\nmanifests a wide variety of dynamics, from periodic behavior to chaos, and\ndescribing a diverse array of physical systems. It has been shown to be\nrelevant in understanding chaos in the classical to quantum transition. Here we\nexplore the complexity of its dynamics in the classical and semi-classical\nregimes, using the technique of ordinal pattern analysis. This is of particular\nrelevance to potential experiments in the semi-classical regime. We unveil\ndifferent dynamical regimes within the chaotic range, which cannot be detected\nwith more traditional statistical tools. These regimes are characterized by\ndifferent hierarchies and probabilities of the ordinal patterns. Correlation\nbetween the Lyapunov exponent and the permutation entropy is revealed that\nleads to interpret dips in the Lyapunov exponent as transitions in the dynamics\nof the system.\n", "  In his study of tidal stabilization of fully relativistic neutron stars\nThorne showed that the fully relativistic expression for tidal heating is the\nsame as in non-relativistic Newtonian theory. Furthermore, Thorne also noted\nthat the tidal heating must be independent of how one localizes gravitational\nenergy and is unambiguously given by that expression. Purdue and Favata\ncalculated the tidal heating for a number of classical gravitational\npseudotensors including that of Moller, and obtained the result that all of\nthem produced the same (Newtonian) value. However, in a re-examination of the\ncalculation using the Moller pseudotensor we find that there is no tidal\nheating. This leads us to the conclusion that Thorne's assertion needs a minor\nmodification: the relativistic tidal heating is pseudotensor independent only\nif the pseudotensor is derived from a Freud type superpotential.\n", "  The spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is a newly introduced\nextension of snapshot POD that recently gained attention but also brought up\ncontroversial issues. Within the first proposition, the approach was mainly\npresented in a methodological and phenomenological way. The present paper will\ndetail the relations between SPOD and related POD approaches from an analytical\npoint of view. To allow for a better grasp of the approach, an alternative\nformulation is given that is based on the classic idea from Lumley that was\ncarried on by George. As will be shown, SPOD is closely related to POD with a\nprior segmentation and Fourier transformation in time. Moreover, the SPOD is\nshown to be equivalent to snapshot POD combined with time delay embedding.\n", "  Urban transportation systems are vulnerable to congestion, accidents,\nweather, special events, and other costly delays. Whereas typical policy\nresponses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the\nefficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve\nresilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still\nscarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by\nmapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to\nlinks. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S.\nCensus Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays\nusing link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality\nmeasures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road\nsegments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period\nauto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data,\nwith the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the\nchange in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary\nbetween cities, with increased delays due to a 5% random loss of road linkages\nranging from 9.5% in Los Angeles to 56.0% in San Francisco. The results\ndemonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under\nnormal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more\nefficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just\nefficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and\njustify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.\n", "  The art of the scientific presentation -- much like the art of the perfect\nplot, the art of the compelling proposal, and the art of the killer job\napplication -- is generally not something we're taught in school. Therefore, in\nclassic Millennial style, one of the first things I did when I was asked to\nwrite this piece was to ask Google, \"how to give a scientific presentation,\" to\nsee what the Internet had to say. I've attempted to avoid boring you with\nlaundry lists of \"do's\" and \"don'ts,\" as many of the top Google hits did.\nHowever, I have incorporated a wide range of tips -- and some interesting\nvignettes -- both from the online hive mind and from my approximately eight\nyears of regularly giving astronomy and radio-science presentations.\n", "  We discuss the notion of hidden correlations in classical and quantum\nindivisible systems along with such characteristics of the correlations as the\nmutual information and conditional information corresponding to the entropic\nsubadditivity condition and the entropic strong subadditivity condition. We\npresent an analog of the Bayes formula for systems without subsystems, study\nentropic inequality for von Neumann entropy and Tsallis entropy of the\nsingle-qudit state, and discuss the inequalities for qubit and qutrit states as\nan example.\n", "  We consider one-dimensional random Schr\\\"odinger operators with a background\npotential, arising in the inverse problem of scattering. We study the influence\nof the background potential on the essential spectrum of the random\nSchr\\\"odinger operator and obtain Anderson Localization for a larger class of\none-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators. Further, we prove the existence of the\nintegrated density of states and give a formula for it.\n", "  A general approach to the construction of bound states in quantum field\ntheory, called the renormalization group procedure for effective particles\n(RGPEP), was applied recently to single heavy-flavor QCD in order to study its\nutility beyond illustration of its general features. This heavy-flavor QCD is\nchosen as the simplest available context in which the dynamics of quark and\ngluon bound states can be studied with the required rigor using Minkowski-space\nHamiltonian operators in the Fock space, taking the advantage of asymptotic\nfreedom. The effective quarks and gluons differ from the point-like canonical\nones by having a finite size $s$. Their size plays the role of renormalization\ngroup parameter. However, instead of integrating out high-energy degrees of\nfreedom, our RGPEP procedure is based on a transformation of the front-form QCD\nHamiltonian from its canonical form with counterterms to the renormalized,\nscale-dependent operator that acts in the Fock space of effective quanta of\nquark and gluon fields, keeping all degrees of freedom intact but accounting\nfor them in a transformed form. We discuss different behavior of effective\nparticles interacting at different energy scales, corresponding to different\nsize s. Namely, we cover phenomena ranging from asymptotic freedom at highest\nenergies down to the scales at which the formation of bound states occurs. We\nbriefly present recent applications of the RGPEP to quarks and gluons in QCD,\nwhich have been developed using expansion in powers of the Fock-space\nHamiltonian running coupling. After observing that the QCD effective\nHamiltonian satisfies the requirement of producing asymptotic freedom, we\nderive the leading effective interaction between quarks in heavy-flavor QCD. An\neffective confining effect is derived as a result of assuming that the\nnon-Abelian and non-perturbative dynamics causes effective gluons to have mass.\n", "  We study theoretically and experimentally the influence of temporally shaping\nthe light pulses in an atom interferometer, with a focus on the phase response\nof the interferometer. We show that smooth light pulse shapes allow rejecting\nhigh frequency phase fluctuations (above the Rabi frequency) and thus relax the\nrequirements on the phase noise or frequency noise of the interrogation lasers\ndriving the interferometer. The light pulse shape is also shown to modify the\nscale factor of the interferometer, which has to be taken into account in the\nevaluation of its accuracy budget. We discuss the trade-offs to operate when\nchoosing a particular pulse shape, by taking into account phase noise\nrejection, velocity selectivity, and applicability to large momentum transfer\natom interferometry.\n", "  Moisture in the form of humidity has a significant impact on the operation of\nphotovoltaic (PV) cells and panels. Moisture is often diffuse through the\nencapsulant film (Ethylene Vynil Acetate (EVA), PVB, PVF, PMMA) or the\nbreathable back-sheet. Moisture is known to accelerate the degradation and\nreduce the performance of a PV while operating in a wet environment. SCAPS 1 D\nis widely used to simulate and estimate the operation of PV. In this work, we\nshowed the effect of moisture on the operation and performance of a PV, made\nfrom monocrystalline silicon. Namely, the influence of defects and impurities\ngenerated by moisture was investigated. We studied the simultaneous effects of\nSilanlols (Si-OH), Hydrogen ions H$^+$, and the metallic ions generated from\nthe corrosion of contacts, encapsulant and transparent conducting oxide (TCO)\nwhen there is production of acid (Al$^{3+}$; Zn$^{2+}$), or from dust\n(Fe$^{3+}$).\n  The numerical simulation showed that : starting with PV cells without\nmoisture, the Fill Factor (FF) and the Power Conversion Efficiency (PCE) drop\nrespectively from 82.80 $\\%$ to 81.78 $\\%$ and 18.57 $\\%$ to 11.46 $\\%$ , when\nthere is moisture in the cell and PVB used as encapsulant. Further degradation\nof parameters was observed, when the moisture leads to the production of acetic\nacid on the EVA, or when there is dust having iron (Fe). FF and PCE were\nfurther dropped to 79.20 $\\%$ and 7.04 $\\%$ respectively, using the same\ninitial photovoltaic cells. Furthermore, a net decrease in key electrical\nparameters of the PV was observed throughout the study, with maximal power (\nP$_{max}$), the short circuit current ( J$_{SC}$), the current density at\nmaximum power J$_{MP}$ reducing by more than 50\\%. This study paves the way for\nthe improvement of performance, and the understanding of degradation process in\npanels used in wet environments and tropical area.\n", "  With the high bunch-crossing and interaction rates and potentially large\nevent sizes the experiments at the LHC challenge data acquisition and trigger\nsystems. Within the ATLAS experiment, a multi-level trigger system based on\nhardware and software is employed to cope with the task of event-rate\nreduction. This review article gives an overview of the trigger of the ATLAS\nexperiment highlighting the design principles and the implementation of the\nsystem and provides references to more detailed information. In addition, first\ntrigger- performance studies and an outlook on the ATLAS event-selection\nstrategy are presented.\n", "  We study the gauge symmetry breaking of an ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory defined on $M^4\\times S^1$, taking correctly account of the\nvacuum expectation values for the adjoint scalar field $\\vev{\\Sigma}$ in vector\nmultiplet in addition to the Wilson line phases $\\vev{A_y}$. We evaluate the\none-loop effective potential and obtain the vacuum configuration, for which an\nSU(N) gauge symmetry is not broken. In case of an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$, under\nappropriate orbifolding boundary conditions, two Higgs doublets are embedded in\nthe zero modes, $A_y^{(0)}$ and $\\Sigma^{(0)}$. We point out that the\ntree-level scalar potential resulted from the covariant derivative for the\nadjoint scalar field is identical to the $D$-term of the MSSM. We also briefly\nmention the mass spectra of the gauge and Higgs sector in the theory.\n", "  Networks exhibiting \"accelerating\" growth have total link numbers growing\nfaster than linearly with network size and can exhibit transitions from\nstationary to nonstationary statistics and from random to scale-free to regular\nstatistics at particular critical network sizes. However, if for any reason the\nnetwork cannot tolerate such gross structural changes then accelerating\nnetworks are constrained to have sizes below some critical value. This is of\ninterest as the regulatory gene networks of single celled prokaryotes are\ncharacterized by an accelerating quadratic growth and are size constrained to\nbe less than about 10,000 genes encoded in DNA sequence of less than about 10\nmegabases. This paper presents a probabilistic accelerating network model for\nprokaryotic gene regulation which closely matches observed statistics by\nemploying two classes of network nodes (regulatory and non-regulatory) and\ndirected links whose inbound heads are exponentially distributed over all nodes\nand whose outbound tails are preferentially attached to regulatory nodes and\ndescribed by a scale free distribution. This model explains the observed\nquadratic growth in regulator number with gene number and predicts an upper\nprokaryote size limit closely approximating the observed value.\n"]}
