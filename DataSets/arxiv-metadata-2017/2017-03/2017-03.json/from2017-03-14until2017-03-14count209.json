For lower luminosity O-type stars however, derived\nmass-loss rates are orders of magnitude lower than predicted, and are at\npresent unexplained.\n", "  Given a Poisson point process of unit masses (``stars'') in dimension d>=3,\nNewtonian gravity partitions space into domains of attraction (cells) of equal\nvolume. In earlier work, we showed the diameters of these cells have\nexponential tails. Here we analyze the quantitative geometry of the cells and\nshow that their large deviations occur at the stretched-exponential scale. More\nprecisely, the probability that mass exp(-R^gamma) in a cell travels distance R\ndecays like exp(-R^f_d(gamma)) where we identify the functions f_d exactly.\nThese functions are piecewise smooth and the discontinuities of f_d' represent\nphase transitions. In dimension d=3, the large deviation is due to a ``distant\nattracting galaxy'' but a phase transition occurs when f_3(gamma)=1 (at that\npoint, the fluctuations due to individual stars dominate). When d>=5, the large\ndeviation is due to a thin tube (a ``wormhole'') along which the star density\nincreases monotonically, until the point f_d(gamma)=1 (where again fluctuations\ndue to individual stars dominate). In dimension 4 we find a double phase\ntransition, where the transition between low-dimensional behavior (attracting\ngalaxy) and high-dimensional behavior (wormhole) occurs at gamma=4/3.\n  As consequences, we determine the tail behavior of the distance from a star\nto a uniform point in its cell, and prove a sharp lower bound for the tail\nprobability of the cell's diameter, matching our earlier upper bound.\n", "  The present paper is based on the assumption that heavy quarks bound states\nexist in the Standard Model (SM). Considering New Bound States (NBS) of\ntop-anti-top quarks (named T-balls) we have shown that: 1) there exists the\nscalar 1S-bound state of 6t+6\\bar t; 2) the forces which bind the top-quarks\nare very strong and almost completely compensate the mass of the twelve\ntop-anti-top-quarks in the scalar NBS; 3) such strong forces are produced by\nthe Higgs-top-quarks interaction with a large value of the top-quark Yukawa\ncoupling constant g_t\\simeq 1. Theory also predicts the existence of the NBS 6t\n+ 5\\bar t, which is a color triplet and a fermion similar to the t'-quark of\nthe fourth generation. We have also considered the \"b-quark-replaced\" NBS. We\nhave estimated the masses of the lightest fermionic NBS: M_{NBS}\\gtrsim 300\nGeV, and discussed the larger masses of T-balls. Searching for heavy quarks\nbound states at the Tevatron and LHC is discussed.\n", "  A homomorphism height function on the $d$-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{Z}_n^d$\nis a function taking integer values on the vertices of the torus with\nconsecutive integers assigned to adjacent vertices. A Lipschitz height function\nis defined similarly but may also take equal values on adjacent vertices. In\neach model, we consider the uniform distribution over such functions, subject\nto boundary conditions. We prove that in high dimensions, with zero boundary\nvalues, a typical function is very flat, having bounded variance at any fixed\nvertex and taking at most $C(\\log n)^{1/d}$ values with high probability. Our\nresults extend to any dimension $d\\ge 2$, if $\\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ is replaced by an\nenhanced version of it, the torus $\\mathbb{Z}_n^d\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2^{d_0}$ for\nsome fixed $d_0$. This establishes one side of a conjectured roughening\ntransition in $2$ dimensions. The full transition is established for a class of\ntori with non-equal side lengths. We also find that when $d$ is taken to\ninfinity while $n$ remains fixed, a typical function takes at most $r$ values\nwith high probability, where $r=5$ for the homomorphism model and $r=4$ for the\nLipschitz model. Suitable generalizations are obtained when $n$ grows with $d$.\nOur results apply also to the related model of uniform 3-coloring and\nestablish, for certain boundary conditions, that a uniformly sampled proper\n3-coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_n^d$ will be nearly constant on either the even or\nodd sub-lattice.\n  Our proofs are based on a combinatorial transformation and on a careful\nanalysis of the properties of a class of cutsets which we term odd cutsets. For\nthe Lipschitz model, our results rely also on a bijection of Yadin. This work\ngeneralizes results of Galvin and Kahn, refutes a conjecture of Benjamini,\nYadin and Yehudayoff and answers a question of Benjamini, H\\\"aggstr\\\"om and\nMossel.\n", "  Here we ask if it is possible to have string unification in\n$\\mathsf{SU(5)\\times SU(5)}$ gauge group.

We show that only a limited versions of $\\mathsf{SU(5)\\times SU(5)}$\nwith adjoint representation components at intermediated scales, between $M_Z$\nand $\\Lambda$ (unification), are allowed. This is essentially due to the\nlimitation in the parameter space to the gauge coupling constant\n$\\alpha_1^{-1}$ related to hypercharge. Indeed, only the vanishing hypercharge\ndecompositions of $\\mathsf{SU(5)_L}$ subgroup can help to this unification,\nnamely, the fermion and boson triplets, $\\Sigma_3\\sim(1,3)_0$, and the fermion\nand boson octets, $\\Sigma_8\\sim(8,1)_0$. Thus, these intermediate particles are\ncompatible with the so-called Adjoint $\\mathsf{SU(5)}$. The triplets must live\nin TeV region and could be accessible at colliders while the octets must alive\nin very high energy scales. We also show that the non-SUSY unification scenario\nrequires the introduction of an additional $\\mathsf{SU(2)_L}$ scalar color\ntriplet, $\\eta \\sim (3,3)_{-{1}/{3}}$, at relatively low energies ($\\sim\n10^{5-11}$GeV), and it may induce the proton decay.\n", "  We consider the hard-core lattice gas model on Z^d and investigate its phase\nstructure in high dimensions. We prove that when the intensity parameter\nexceeds Cd^{-1/3}(log d)^2, the model exhibits multiple hard-core measures,\nthus improving the previous bound of Cd^{-1/4}(log d)^{3/4} given by Galvin and\nKahn. At the heart of our approach lies the study of a certain class of edge\ncutsets in Z^d, the so-called odd cutsets, that appear naturally as the\nboundary between different phases in the hard-core model. We provide a refined\ncombinatorial analysis of the structure of these cutsets yielding a\nquantitative form of concentration for their possible shapes as the dimension d\ntends to infinity. This analysis relies upon and improves previous results\nobtained by the first author.\n", "  In this article new bounds for the convergence exponent of the two\ndimensional Tarry's problem are given.\n", "  We consider a model of a random height function with long-range constraints\non a discrete segment. This model was suggested by Benjamini, Yadin and\nYehudayoff and is a generalization of simple random walk. The random function\nis uniformly sampled from all graph homomorphisms from the graph P_{n,d} to the\nintegers Z, where the graph P_{n,d} is the discrete segment {0,1,..., n} with\nedges between vertices of different parity whose distance is at most 2d+1. Such\na graph homomorphism can be viewed as a height function whose values change by\nexactly one along edges of the graph P_{n,d}. We also consider a similarly\ndefined model on the discrete torus.\n  Benjamini, Yadin and Yehudayoff conjectured that this model undergoes a phase\ntransition from a delocalized to a localized phase when d grows beyond a\nthreshold c*log(n). We establish this conjecture with the precise threshold\nlog_2(n). Our results provide information on the typical range and variance of\nthe height function for every given pair of n and d, including the critical\ncase when d-log_2(n) tends to a constant.\n  In addition, we identify the local limit of the model, when d is constant and\nn tends to infinity, as an explicitly defined Markov chain.\n", "  We consider the problem of a particular kind of quantum correlation that\narises in some two-party games. In these games, one player is presented with a\nquestion they must answer, yielding an outcome of either 'win' or 'lose'.\nMolina and Watrous (arXiv:1104.1140) studied such a game that exhibited a\nperfect form of hedging, where the risk of losing a first game can completely\noffset the corresponding risk for a second game. This is a non-classical\nquantum phenomenon, and establishes the impossibility of performing strong\nerror-reduction for quantum interactive proof systems by parallel repetition,\nunlike for classical interactive proof systems. We take a step in this article\ntowards a better understanding of the hedging phenomenon by giving a complete\ncharacterization of when perfect hedging is possible for a natural\ngeneralization of the game in arXiv:1104.1140. Exploring in a different\ndirection the subject of quantum hedging, and motivated by implementation\nconcerns regarding loss-tolerance, we also consider a variation of the protocol\nwhere the player who receives the question can choose to restart the game\nrather than return an answer. We show that in this setting there is no possible\nhedging for any game played with state spaces corresponding to\nfinite-dimensional complex Euclidean spaces.\n", "  The tight-binding method is employed to investigate the effects of three\ntypical in-plane electric fields on the electronic structure of a triangular\nzigzag graphene quantum dot. The calculation shows that the single-electron\neigenstates evolute independently in two subspaces no matter how the electric\nfields change. The electric field with fixed-geometry gates chooses several\nscattered parts of the zero-energy eigenspace as the new zero-energy\neigenstates, regardless of the field strength. Moreover, the new zero-energy\neigenstates remain unchanged and the associated levels are linear as the field\nstrength. In contrast, the new nonzero-energy eigenstates mix mutually and the\nassociated levels are nonlinear as the field strength. By comparing the effects\nof three electric fields, we demonstrate that the degeneracy of the zero-energy\neigenstates accounts for the linearity of the associated levels.\n", "  The seemingly stochastic transient dynamics of neocortical circuits observed\nin vivo have been hypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic\ninference. In vitro neurons, on the other hand, exhibit a highly deterministic\nresponse to various types of stimulation. We show that an ensemble of\ndeterministic leaky integrate-and-fire neurons embedded in a spiking noisy\nenvironment can attain the correct firing statistics in order to sample from a\nwell-defined target distribution. We provide an analytical derivation of the\nactivation function on the single cell level; for recurrent networks, we\nexamine convergence towards stationarity in computer simulations and\ndemonstrate sample-based Bayesian inference in a mixed graphical model. This\nestablishes a rigorous link between deterministic neuron models and functional\nstochastic dynamics on the network level.\n", "  We examine the stability of population transfer in two- and three-level\nsystems against unwanted additional transitions. This population inversion is\nachieved by using recently proposed schemes called \"shortcuts to adiabaticity\".\nWe quantify and compare the sensitivity of different schemes to these unwanted\ntransitions. Finally, we provide examples of shortcut schemes which lead to a\nzero transition sensitivity in certain regimes, i.e. which lead to a nearly\nperfect population inversion even in the presence of unwanted transitions.\n", "  Gravitational Wave Inspiral search with a global network of interferometers\nwhen carried in a phase coherent fashion would mimic an effective\nmulti-detector network with synthetic streams constructed by the linear\ncombination of the data from different detectors. For the first time, we\ndemonstrate that the two synthetic data streams pertaining to the two\npolarizations of Gravitational Wave can be derived prior to the\nmaximum-likelihood analysis in a most natural way using the technique of\nsingular-value-decomposition applied to the network signal-to-noise ratio\nvector. We construct the network matched filters in combined network plus\nspectral space which capture both the synthetic streams. We further show that\nthe network LLR is then sum of the LLR of each synthetic stream. The four\nextrinsic parameters are mapped to the two amplitudes and two phases. The\nmaximization over these is a straightforward approach closely linked to the\nsingle detector approach. Towards the end, we connect all the previous works\nrelated to the multi-detector Gravitational Wave inspiral search and express in\nthe same notation in order to bring under the same footing.\n", "  We consider Schr\\\"odinger operators $H=-\\Delta_{g_\\varepsilon} + V$ on a\nfibre bundle $M\\stackrel{\\pi}{\\to}B$ with compact fibres and a metric\n$g_\\varepsilon$ that blows up directions perpendicular to the fibres by a\nfactor ${\\varepsilon^{-1}\\gg 1}$. We show that for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of\nthe fibre-wise part of $H$, satisfying a local gap condition, and every $N\\in\n\\mathbb{N}$ there exists a subspace of $L^2(M)$ that is invariant under $H$ up\nto errors of order $\\varepsilon^{N+1}$. The dynamical and spectral features of\n$H$ on this subspace can be described by an effective operator on the\nfibre-wise $\\lambda$-eigenspace bundle $\\mathcal{E}\\to B$, giving detailed\nasymptotics for $H$.\n", "  We study general quantum waveguides and establish explicit effective\nHamiltonians for the Laplacian on these spaces. A conventional quantum\nwaveguide is an $\\varepsilon$-tubular neighbourhood of a curve in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$ and the object of interest is the Dirichlet Laplacian on this\ntube in the asymptotic limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$. We generalise this by\nconsidering fibre bundles $M$ over a $d$-dimensional submanifold\n$B\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d+k}$ with fibres diffeomorphic to $F\\subset\\mathbb{R}^k$,\nwhose total space is embedded into an $\\varepsilon$-neighbourhood of $B$. From\nthis point of view $B$ takes the role of the curve and $F$ that of the\ndisc-shaped cross-section of a conventional quantum waveguide. Our approach\nallows, among other things, for waveguides whose cross-sections $F$ are\ndeformed along $B$ and also the study of the Laplacian on the boundaries of\nsuch waveguides. By applying recent results on the adiabatic limit of\nSchr\\\"odinger operators on fibre bundles we show, in particular, that for small\nenergies the dynamics and the spectrum of the Laplacian on $M$ are reflected by\nthe adiabatic approximation associated to the ground state band of the normal\nLaplacian. We give explicit formulas for the according effective operator on\n$L^2(B)$ in various scenarios, thereby improving and extending many of the\nknown results on quantum waveguides and quantum layers in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n", "  Liquid salty micro-channels (brine) between growing ice platelets in sea ice\nare an important habitat for $CO_2$ - binding microalgaea with great impact on\npolar ecosystems. The structure formation of ice platelets is microscopically\ndescribed and a phase field model is developed. The pattern formation during\nsolidification of the two-dimensional interstitial liquid is considered by two\ncoupled order parameters, the tetrahedricity as structure of ice and the\nsalinity. The coupling and time-evolution of these order parameters are\ndescribed by a consistent set of three model parameters. They determine the\nvelocity of the freezing process and the structure formation, the phase\ndiagram, the super-cooling and super-heating region, and the specific heat. The\nmodel is used to calculate the short-time frozen micro-structures. The obtained\nmorphological structure is compared with the vertical brine pore space obtained\nfrom Xray computed tomography.\n", "  The dense O(1) loop model is a statistical physics model with connections to\nthe quantum XXZ spin chain, alternating sign matrices, the six-vertex model and\ncritical bond percolation on the square lattice. When cylindrical boundary\nconditions are imposed, the model possesses a commuting family of transfer\nmatrices. The original proof of the commutation property is algebraic and is\nbased on the Yang-Baxter equation. In this paper we give a new proof of this\nfact using a direct combinatorial bijection.\n", "  One-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological superconducting wires of\nthe symmetry class DIII exhibit exotic physics which can be exploited to\nrealize the set of universal operations in topological quantum computing.\nHowever, the verification of DIII-class physics in conventional condensed\nmatter materials is highly nontrivial due to realistic constraints. Here we\npropose a symmetry-protected hard-core boson simulator of the one-dimensional\nDIII topological superconductor. By using the developed dispersive dynamic\nmodulation approach, not only the faithful simulation of this new type of\nspinful superconducting chains is achieved, but also a set of universal quantum\ngates can be realized with the computational basis formed by the degenerate\nground states that are topologically protected against random local\nperturbations. Physical implementation of our scheme based on a Josephson\nquantum circuit is presented, where our detailed analysis pinpoints that this\nscheme is experimentally feasible with the state-of-the-art technology.\n", "  Due to nonuniform aggregation in liquid state, from the thermodynamic point\nof view any glass-forming liquid in the vicinity of the liquid-to-solid phase\ntransition temperature, irrespective of its actual chemical composition, shall\nbe described in terms of a complex multicomponent solution whose comprised of\nthe same chemical elements components have characteristic atomic arrangement\ndeviating to various extent from the thermodynamic ground state with respect to\nthe size, shape, density, structure, and stoichiometry. Therefore, glass\ntransition appears to be a process of non-equilibrium solidification of\nmulticomponent solution upon its rapid cooling. The essential feature of this\nprocess is that the attempts of the liquid and solid phases of the solidifying\nsolution to separate out are largely arrested due to quenching. Thus, the\nsolidification occurs in the absence of solid-liquid interface, so the\nsubstance in the liquid-to-glass transition region is observed behaving like\nfluid with rapidly growing viscosity that reflects the formation of\nmechanically rigid and stable bound configurations. It is shown that glass\ntransition shall be classified as phase transition in multicomponent solutions\nand not a standalone phenomenon.\n", "  We investigate the quantum Calogero-Moser model and reveal its hidden\nsymmetries, i.e., the $W_{1+\\infty}$ and Virasoro-Witt 3-algebras. In the large\n$N$ limit, we note that these two infinite dimensional 3-algebras reduce to the\n$w_{\\infty}$ and special Virasoro-Witt 3-algebras which satisfy the fundamental\nidentity condition, respectively.\n", "  There is a multiplicity of charge ordered, pairing-based or pair density wave\ntheories of the cuprate pseudogap, albeit arising from different microscopic\nmechanisms. For mean field schemes (of which there are many) we demonstrate\nhere that they have precise implications for two body physics in the same way\nthat they are able to address the one body physics of photoemission\nspectroscopy. This follows because the full vertex can be obtained exactly from\nthe Ward-Takahashi identity. As an illustration, we present the spin response\nfunctions, finding that a recently proposed pair density wave (Amperean\npairing) scheme is readily distinguishable from other related scenarios.\n", "  According to the recent results of the neutrino oscillation experiment MINOS,\nthe neutrino mixing angle $\\theta_{23}$ may not be maximal ($45^{\\circ}$). Two\nnearly degenerate solutions are possible, one in the lower octant (LO) where\n$\\theta_{23}<45^{\\circ}$, and one in the higher octant (HO) where\n$\\theta_{23}>45^{\\circ}$. Long baseline experiments measuring the\n$\\nu_{\\mu}\\rightarrow\\nu_{e}$ are capable of resolving this degeneracy. In this\nwork we study the potential of the planned European LBNO experiment to\ndistinguish between the LO and HO solutions.\n", "  We propose shortcuts to adiabaticity which achieve fast and stable control of\nthe state of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. In particular we\ndesign a non-adiabatic change of the magnetic field strength in a Penning trap\nwhich changes the radial spread without final excitations. We apply a\nstreamlined version of the fast-forward formalism as well as an invariant based\ninverse engineering approach. We compare both methods and examine their\nstability.\n", "  We consider two physically and mathematically distinct regularization\nmechanisms of scalar hyperbolic conservation laws. When the flux is convex, the\ncombination of diffusion and dispersion are known to give rise to monotonic and\noscillatory traveling waves that approximate shock waves. The zero-diffusion\nlimits of these traveling waves are dynamically expanding dispersive shock\nwaves (DSWs). A richer set of wave solutions can be found when the flux is\nnon-convex. This review compares the structure of solutions of Riemann problems\nfor a conservation law with non-convex, cubic flux regularized by two different\nmechanisms: 1) dispersion in the modified Korteweg--de Vries (mKdV) equation;\nand 2) a combination of diffusion and dispersion in the mKdV-Burgers equation.\nIn the first case, the possible dynamics involve two qualitatively different\ntypes of DSWs, rarefaction waves (RWs) and kinks (monotonic fronts). In the\nsecond case, in addition to RWs, there are traveling wave solutions\napproximating both classical (Lax) and non-classical (undercompressive) shock\nwaves. Despite the singular nature of the zero-diffusion limit and rather\ndiffering analytical approaches employed in the descriptions of dispersive and\ndiffusive-dispersive regularization, the resulting comparison of the two cases\nreveals a number of striking parallels. In contrast to the case of convex flux,\nthe mKdVB to mKdV mapping is not one-to-one. The mKdV kink solution is\nidentified as an undercompressive DSW. Other prominent features, such as\nshock-rarefactions, also find their purely dispersive counterparts involving\nspecial contact DSWs, which exhibit features analogous to contact\ndiscontinuities. This review describes an important link between two major\nareas of applied mathematics, hyperbolic conservation laws and nonlinear\ndispersive waves.\n", "  An attempt is made to simulate the disclosure of underground soldiers in\nterms of theory of networks. The coupling mechanism between the network nodes\nis the possibility that a disclosed soldier is going to disclose also his\nacquaintances. We calculate the fraction of disclosed soldiers as dependent on\nthe fraction of those who, once disclosed, reveal also their colleagues. The\nsimulation is immersed in the historical context of the Polish Home Army under\nthe communist rule in 1946-49.\n", "  Given a quantum Hamiltonian and its evolution time, the corresponding unitary\nevolution operator can be constructed in many different ways, corresponding to\ndifferent trajectories between the desired end-points and different series\nexpansions. A choice among these possibilities can then be made to obtain the\nbest computational complexity and control over errors. It is shown how a\nconstruction based on Grover's algorithm scales linearly in time and\nlogarithmically in the error bound, and is exponentially superior in error\ncomplexity to the scheme based on the straightforward application of the\nLie-Trotter formula. The strategy is then extended first to simulation of any\nHamiltonian that is a linear combination of two projection operators, and then\nto any local efficiently computable Hamiltonian. The key feature is to\nconstruct an evolution in terms of the largest possible steps instead of taking\nsmall time steps. Reflection operations and Chebyshev expansions are used to\nefficiently control the total error on the overall evolution, without worrying\nabout discretisation errors for individual steps. We also use a digital\nimplementation of quantum states that makes linear algebra operations rather\nsimple to perform.\n", "  We analyse numerically a pinch-type instability in a semi-infinite planar\nlayer of inviscid conducting liquid bounded by solid walls and carrying a\nuniform electric current. Our model is as simple as possible but still captures\nthe salient features of the instability which otherwise may be obscured by the\ntechnical details of more comprehensive numerical models and laboratory\nexperiments. Firstly, we show the instability in liquid metals, which are\nrelatively poor conductors, differs significantly from the\nastrophysically-relevant Tayler instability. In liquid metals, the instability\ndevelops on the magnetic response time scale, which depends on the conductivity\nand is much longer than the Alfv\\'en time scale, on which the Tayler\ninstability develops in well conducting fluids. Secondly, we show that this\ninstability is an edge effect caused by the curvature of the magnetic field,\nand its growth rate is determined by the linear current density and independent\nof the system size. Our results suggest that this instability may affect future\nliquid metal batteries when their size reaches a few meters.\n", "  We constructed a class of non-maximally entangled mixed states \\cite{roy2010}\nand extensively studied its entanglement properties and also their usefulness\nas teleportation channels. In this article, we revisited our constructed state\nand have studied it from three different perspectives. Since every entangled\nstate is associated with an witness operator, we have found a suitable\nentanglement as well as teleportation witness for our non-maximally entangled\nmixed states. We considered the noisy channel's effects on our constructed\nstate and to see whether it affects the states' capacity as teleportation\nchannel. For this purpose we have mainly emphasized on amplitude damping\nchannel. A comparative study with concurrence and quantum discord of the state\nof ref. \\cite{roy2010} has also been carried out here.\n", "  The annular eclipse of Jan 15, 2010 over southern India was studied with a\nnetwork of multi-instrumental observations consisting magnetometer, ionosonde\nand GPS receivers. By selecting the day before and the normal EEJ days as the\ncontrol days, it is intrinsically proved that the regular eastward electric\nfield for the whole day at the equator was not just weakened but actually was\nflipped for several hours by the influence of tides related to the spectacular\nSun-Moon-Earth alignment near the middle of the day. The effect of flipping the\nelectric field was clearly seen in the equatorial ionosonde data and through\nthe large array of GPS receivers that accomplished the TEC data. The main\nimpact of the change in the electric field was the reduced EIA at all\nlatitudes, with the anomaly crest that shifted towards the equator. The\nequatorial F-region density profile was also showing an enhanced F region peak\nin spite of a reduced VTEC. By comparison to the plasma density depletion\nassociated with the temporary lack of photo-ionization during the episode of\neclipse, the electrodynamical consequences of the eclipse were far more\nimportant and influenced the plasma density over a wide range of latitudes.\n", "  We propose a new interferometric setup which displays a completely\ndestructive generalized N-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. The key property\nof this scheme is that is does not require any optical elements like beam\nsplitters or integrated waveguide structures. The interference is intrinsically\nproduced by the evolution of N photons in free space when emitted by N\nidentical statistically independent single photon sources and measured by N\ndetectors in the far field. In this sense the setup is a most simple and\nnatural implementation of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference effect, i.e., of a\ncompletely destructive multi-photon interference produced by statistically\nindependent incoherent sources.\n", "  Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is a very useful tool when simulating turbulent\nflows if we are only interested in its \"larger\" scales. One of the possible\nways to derive the LES equations is to apply a filter operator to the\nNavier-Stokes equations, obtaining a new equation governing the behavior of the\nfiltered velocity. This approach introduces in the equations the so called\nsubgrid-scale tensor, that must be expressed in terms of the filtered velocity\nto close the problem. One of the most popular models is that proposed by\nSmagorinsky, where the subgrid-scale tensor is modeled by introducing an eddy\nviscosity.\n  In this work, we shall propose a new approximation to this problem by\napplying the filter, not to the Navier-Stokes equations, but to a generalized\nversion of them with nonlinear viscosity. That is, we shall introduce a\nnonlinear viscosity, not as a procedure to close the subgrid-scale tensor, but\nas part of the model itself (see below). Consequently, we shall need a\ndifferent method to close the subgrid-scale tensor, and we shall use the Clark\napproximation, where the Taylor expansion of the subgrid-scale tensor is\ncomputed.\n", "  To understand under which conditions thermodynamics emerges from the\nmicroscopic dynamics is the ultimate goal of statistical mechanics. Despite the\nfact that the theory is more than 100 years old, we are still discussing its\nfoundations and its regime of applicability. A point of crucial importance is\nthe definition of the notion of thermal equilibrium, which is given as the\nstate that maximises the von Neumann entropy. Here we argue that it is\nnecessary to propose a new way of describing thermal equilibrium, focused on\nobservables rather than on the full state of the quantum system. We\ncharacterise the notion of thermal equilibrium, for a given observable, via the\nmaximisation of its Shannon entropy and highlight the thermal properties that\nsuch a principle heralds. The relation with Gibbs ensembles is brought to\nlight. Furthermore, we apply such a notion of equilibrium to a closed quantum\nsystems and prove that there is always a class of observables which exhibits\nthermal equilibrium properties and we give a recipe to explicitly construct\nthem. Eventually, we bring to light an intimate connection of such a principle\nwith the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis.\n", "  We consider a system of $N$ bosons confined to a thin waveguide, i.e.\\ to a\nregion of space within an $\\varepsilon$-tube around a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\nWe show that when taking simultaneously the NLS limit $N\\to \\infty$ and the\nlimit of strong confinement $\\varepsilon\\to 0$, the time-evolution of such a\nsystem starting in a state close to a Bose-Einstein condensate is approximately\ncaptured by a non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation in one dimension. The strength\nof the non-linearity in this Gross-Pitaevskii type equation depends on the\nshape of the cross-section of the waveguide, while the \"bending\" and the\n\"twisting\" of the waveguide contribute potential terms. Our analysis is based\non an approach to mean-field limits developed by Pickl.\n", "  This article is a brief review of \"nonfreeness\" and related measures of\n\"correlation\" for many-fermion systems.\n  The many-fermion states we deem \"uncorrelated\" are the gauge-invariant\nquasi-free states. Uncorrelated states of systems of finitely many fermions we\ncall simply \"free\" states. Slater determinant states are free; all other free\nstates are \"substates\" of Slater determinant states or limits of such.\n  The nonfreeness of a many-fermion state equals the minimum of its entropy\nrelative to all free states. Correlation functionals closely related to\nnonfreeness can be defined in terms of R\\'enyi entropies; nonfreeness is the\none that uses Shannon entropy. These correlation functionals all share\ndesirable additivity and monotonicity properties, but nonfreeness has some\nadditional attractive properties.\n", "  A lattice Boltzmann method is proposed based on the expansion of the\nequilibrium distribution function in powers of a new set of generalized\northonormal polynomials which are here presented. The new polynomials are\northonormal under the weight defined by the equilibrium distribution function\nitself. The D-dimensional Hermite polynomials is a sub-case of the present\nones, associated to the particular weight of a gaussian function. The proposed\nlattice Boltzmann method allows for the treatment of semi-classical fluids,\nsuch as electrons in metals under the Drude-Sommerfeld model, which is a\nparticular case that we develop and validate by the Riemann problem.\n", "  We studied the quantum correlations between the nodes in a quantum neural\nnetwork built of an array of quantum dots with dipole-dipole interaction. By\nmeans of the quasiadiabatic path integral simulation of the density matrix\nevolution in a presence of the common phonon bath we have shown the coherence\nin such system can survive up to the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77K and\nabove. The quantum correlations between quantum dots are studied by means of\ncalculation of the entanglement of formation in a pair of quantum dots with the\ntypical dot size of a few nanometers and the interdot distance of the same\norder. We have shown that the proposed quantum neural network can keep the\nmixture of entangled states of QD pairs up to the above mentioned high\ntemperatures.\n", "  Model of noncommutative gravity is constructed by means of Fedosov\ndeformation quantization of endomorphism bundle. The fields describing\nnoncommutativity -- symplectic form and symplectic connection -- are dynamical,\nand the resulting theory is completely coordinate covariant and background\nindependent. Its interpretation in terms of Seiberg-Witten map is provided.\nAlso, new action for ordinary (commutative) general relativity is given, which\nin the present context appears as a commutative limit of noncommutative theory.\n", "  We derive a dielectric function tensor model approach to render the optical\nresponse of monoclinic and triclinic symmetry materials with multiple uncoupled\ninfrared and farinfrared active modes. We apply our model approach to\nmonoclinic $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single crystal samples. Surfaces cut under\ndifferent angles from a bulk crystal, (010) and ($\\bar{2}$01), are investigated\nby generalized spectroscopic ellipsometry within infrared and farinfrared\nspectral regions. We determine the frequency dependence of 4 independent\n$\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Cartesian dielectric function tensor elements by matching\nlarge sets of experimental data using a point by point data inversion approach.\nFrom matching our monoclinic model to the obtained 4 dielectric function tensor\ncomponents, we determine all infared and farinfrared active transverse optic\nphonon modes with $A_u$ and $B_u$ symmetry, and their eigenvectors within the\nmonoclinic lattice. We find excellent agreement between our model results and\nresults of density functional theory calculations. We derive and discuss the\nfrequencies of longitudinal optical phonons in $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. We derive\nand report density and anisotropic mobility parameters of the free charge\ncarriers within the tin doped crystals. We discuss the occurrence of\nlongitudinal phonon plasmon coupled modes in $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and provide\ntheir frequencies and eigenvectors. We also discuss and present monoclinic\ndielectric constants for static electric fields and frequencies above the\nreststrahlen range, and we provide a generalization of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller\nrelation for monoclinic lattices with infrared and farinfrared active modes. We\nfind that the generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is fulfilled\nexcellently for $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.\n", "  The apparent stochasticity of in-vivo neural circuits has long been\nhypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic inference in the\nbrain. More recently, a theoretical framework for neural sampling has been\nproposed, which explains how sample-based inference can be performed by\nnetworks of spiking neurons. One particular requirement of this approach is\nthat the neural response function closely follows a logistic curve.\n  Analytical approaches to calculating neural response functions have been the\nsubject of many theoretical studies. In order to make the problem tractable,\nparticular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually\nmade. However, biologically significant activity regimes exist which are not\ncovered by these approaches: Under strong synaptic bombardment, as is often the\ncase in cortex, the neuron is shifted into a high-conductance state (HCS)\ncharacterized by a small membrane time constant. In this regime, synaptic time\nconstants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.\n  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different \"modes\"\nof spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the\nneuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating\nthe PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst,\nwhile using a diffusion approximation for the latter. We find that our\nprediction of the neural response function closely matches simulation data.\nMoreover, in the HCS scenario, we show that the neural response function\nbecomes symmetric and can be well approximated by a logistic function, thereby\nproviding the correct dynamics in order to perform neural sampling. We hereby\nprovide not only a normative framework for Bayesian inference in cortex, but\nalso powerful applications of low-power, accelerated neuromorphic systems to\nrelevant machine learning tasks.\n", "  We consider spherically symmetric steady states of the Vlasov-Poisson system,\nwhich describe equilibrium configurations of galaxies or globular clusters. If\nthe microscopic equation of state, i.e., the dependence of the steady state on\nthe particle energy (and angular momentum) is fixed, a one-parameter family of\nsuch states is obtained. In the polytropic case the mass of the state along\nsuch a one-parameter family is a monotone function of its radius. We prove that\nfor the King, Woolley-Dickens, and related models this mass-radius relation\ntakes the form of a spiral.\n", "  A generalization of the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation is presented for polar\nvibrations in materials with monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems. The\ngeneralization is derived from an eigen displacement vector summation approach,\nwhich is equivalent to the microscopic Born-Huang description of polar lattice\nvibrations. An expression for a general oscillator strength is also described\nfor materials with monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems. A generalized\nfactorized dielectric response function characteristic for monoclinic and\ntriclinic materials is proposed. The generalized Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation\nis found valid for monoclinic $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, where accurate experimental\ndata became available recently from a comprehensive generalized ellipsometry\ninvestigation. Data for triclinic crystal systems can be measured by\ngeneralized ellipsometry as well, and are anticipated to become available soon\nand results can be compared with the generalized relations presented here\n", "  An accurate and efficient simulation has been devised, employing a new\nnumerical technique to simulate the derivative generalised non-linear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation in all three spatial dimensions and time. The simulation\nmodels all pertinent effects such as self-steepening and plasma for the\nnon-linear propagation of ultrafast optical radiation in bulk material.\nSimulation results are compared to published experimental spectral data of an\nexample ytterbium aluminum garnet system at 3.1um radiation and fits to within\na factor of 5. The simulation shows that there is a stability point near the\nend of the 2 mm crystal where a quasi-light bullet (spatial temporal soliton)\nis present. Within this region, the pulse is collimated at a reduced diameter\n(factor of ~2) and there exists a near temporal soliton at the spatial center.\nThe temporal intensity within this stable region is compressed by a factor of\n~4 compared to the input. This study shows that the simulation highlights new\nphysical phenomena based on the interplay of various linear, non-linear and\nplasma effects that go beyond the experiment and is thus integral to achieving\naccurate designs of white light generation systems for optical applications. An\nadaptive error reduction algorithm tailor made for this simulation will also be\npresented in appendix.\n", "  The main idea of Gyrokinetic dynamical reduction consists in systematical\nremoving of fastest scale of motion (the gyro motion) from plasma's dynamics,\nresulting in a considerable model simplification and gain of computing time.\n  Gyrokinetic Maxwell-Vlasov system is broadly implemented in nowadays\nnumerical experiments for modeling strongly magnetized plasma (both laboratory\nand astrophysical). Different versions of reduced set of equations exist\ndepending on the construction of the Gyrokinetic reduction procedure and\napproximations assumed while their derivation.\n  The purpose of this paper is to explicitly show the connection between the\ngeneral second order gyrokinetic Maxwell-Vlasov system issued from the Modern\nGyrokinetic theory derivation and the model currently implemented in global\nelectromagnetic Particle in Cell code ORB5.\n  Strictly necessary information about the Modern Gyrokinetic formalism is\ngiven together with the consistent derivation of the gyrokinetic Maxwell-Vlasov\nequations from the first principle of dynamics. Variational formulation of\ndynamics is also used for simultaneously obtaining the corresponding exact\nenergy conservation law. The result of that explicit derivation is used for\nverification of the energy conservation diagnostics currently implemented in\nORB5 code.\n  This work subscribes into the context of codes verification project VeriGyro\ncurrently run in IPP Max Planck Institut in collaboration with others European\ninstitutions.\n", "  The W50/SS433 system is an unusual Galactic outflow-driven object of\ndebatable origin. We have used the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to\nobserve a new 198 pointing mosaic, covering $3^\\circ \\times 2^\\circ$, and\npresent the highest-sensitivity full-Stokes data of W50 to date using\nwide-field, wide-band imaging over a 2 GHz bandwidth centred at 2.1 GHz. We\nalso present a complementary H$\\alpha$ mosaic created using the Isaac Newton\nTelescope Photometric H$\\alpha$ Survey of the Northern Galactic Plane (IPHAS).\nThe magnetic structure of W50 is found to be consistent with the prevailing\nhypothesis that the nebula is a reanimated shell-like supernova remnant (SNR),\nthat has been re-energised by the jets from SS433. We observe strong\ndepolarization effects that correlate with diffuse H$\\alpha$ emission, likely\ndue to spatially-varying Faraday rotation measure (RM) fluctuations of $\\ge48$\nto 61 rad m$^{-2}$ on scales $\\le4.5$ to 6 pc. We also report the discovery of\nnumerous, faint, H$\\alpha$ filaments that are unambiguously associated with the\ncentral region of W50. These thin filaments are suggestive of a SNR's shock\nemission, and almost all have a radio counterpart. Furthermore, an RM-gradient\nis detected across the central region of W50, which we interpret as a loop\nmagnetic field with a symmetry axis offset by $\\approx90^{\\circ}$ to the\neast-west jet-alignment axis, and implying that the evolutionary processes of\nboth the jets and the SNR must be coupled. A separate RM-gradient is associated\nwith the termination shock in the Eastern ear, which we interpret as a\nring-like field located where the shock of the jet interacts with the\ncircumstellar medium. Future optical observations will be able to use the new\nH$\\alpha$ filaments to probe the kinematics of the shell of W50, potentially\nallowing for a definitive experiment on W50's formation history.\n", "  Previously [1] it was shown that for a configuration of 2 protons and 2\nneutrons in the g_{9/2}shell there is a certain degeneracy that occurs when the\nquadrupole-quadrupole interaction (Q.Q) is used to to obtain the wave\nfunctions.. We here show 3 other examples of such degenerate pairs, all, as\nbefore, involving T=0 and T=2 states. . More important we discuss an unusual\npeculiarity of the original example. Also we point out that degeneracies can be\nconfusing and steps can be taken to remove them.\n", "  We consider the 1d Schr\\\"odinger operator with random decaying potential and\ncompute the 2nd term asymptotics of the density of states, which shows\nsubstantial differences between the cases $\\alpha > \\frac 12$, $\\alpha < \\frac\n12$ and $\\alpha = \\frac 12$.\n", "  We present a model for the temporal variability of long gamma-ray bursts\nduring the prompt phase (the highly variable first 100 seconds or so), in the\ncontext of a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) around a black hole. In this\nstate, sufficient magnetic flux is held on to the black hole such that it\nstalls the accretion near the inner region of the disk. The system transitions\nin and out of the MAD state, which we relate to the variable luminosity of the\nGRB during the prompt phase, with a characteristic timescale defined by the\nfree fall time in the region over which the accretion is arrested. We present\nsimple analytic estimates of the relevant energetics and timescales, and\ncompare them to gamma-ray burst observations. In particular, we show how this\nmodel can reproduce the characteristic one second time scale that emerges from\nvarious analyses of the prompt emission light curve. We also discuss how our\nmodel can accommodate the potentially physically important correlation between\na burst quiescent time and the duration of its subsequent pulse (Ramirez-Ruiz &\nMerloni 2001).\n", "  We analyse the possible dynamical states emerging for two symmetrically pulse\ncoupled populations of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. In particular, we\nobserve broken symmetry states in this set-up: namely, breathing chimeras,\nwhere one population is fully synchronized and the other is in a state of\npartial synchronization (PS) as well as generalized chimera states, where both\npopulations are in PS, but with different levels of synchronization. Symmetric\nmacroscopic states are also present, ranging from quasi-periodic motions, to\ncollective chaos, from splay states to population anti-phase partial\nsynchronization. We then investigate the influence disorder, random link\nremoval or noise, on the dynamics of collective solutions in this model. As a\nresult, we observe that broken symmetry chimera-like states, with both\npopulations partially synchronized, persist up to 80 \\% of broken links and up\nto noise amplitudes 8 \\% of threshold-reset distance. Furthermore, the\nintroduction of disorder on symmetric chaotic state has a constructive effect,\nnamely to induce the emergence of chimera-like states at intermediate dilution\nor noise level.\n", "  Dissipationless hydrodynamics regularized by dispersion describe a number of\nphysical media including water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. As in the classical theory of hyperbolic equations where a\nnon-convex flux leads to non-classical solution structures, a non-convex linear\ndispersion relation provides an intriguing dispersive hydrodynamic analogue.\nHere, the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, also known as the\nKawahara equation, a classical model for shallow water waves, is shown to be a\nuniversal model of Eulerian hydrodynamics with higher order dispersive effects.\nUtilizing asymptotic methods and numerical computations, this work classifies\nthe long-time behavior of solutions for step-like initial data. For convex\ndispersion, the result is a dispersive shock wave (DSW), qualitatively and\nquantitatively bearing close resemblance to the KdV DSW. For non-convex\ndispersion, three distinct dynamic regimes are observed. For small jumps, a\nperturbed KdV DSW with positive polarity and orientation is generated,\naccompanied by small amplitude radiation from an embedded solitary wave leading\nedge, termed a radiating DSW or RDSW. For moderate jumps, a crossover regime is\nobserved with waves propagating forward and backward from the sharp transition\nregion. For jumps exceeding a critical threshold, a new type of DSW is observed\nwe term a translating DSW or TDSW. The TDSW consists of a traveling wave that\nconnects a partial, non-monotonic, negative solitary wave at the trailing edge\nto an interior nonlinear periodic wave. Its speed, a generalized\nRankine-Hugoniot jump condition, is determined by the far-field structure of\nthe traveling wave. The TDSW is resolved at the leading edge by a harmonic\nwavepacket moving with the linear group velocity. The non-classical TDSW\nexhibits features common to both dissipative and dispersive shock waves.\n", "  In this work, modulation of periodic interfacial waves on a conduit of\nviscous liquid is explored utilizing Whitham theory and Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\n(NLS) theory. Large amplitude periodic wave modulation theory does not require\nintegrability of the underlying model equation, yet in practice, either\nintegrable equations are studied or the full extent of Whitham (wave-averaging)\ntheory is not developed. The governing conduit equation is nonlocal with\nnonlinear dispersion and is not integrable. Via a scaling symmetry, periodic\nwaves can be characterized by their wavenumber and amplitude. In the weakly\nnonlinear regime, both the defocusing and focusing variants of the NLS equation\nare derived, depending on the wavenumber. Dark and bright envelope solitons are\nfound to persist in the conduit equation. Due to non-convex dispersion,\nmodulational instability for periodic waves above a critical wavenumber is\npredicted. In the large amplitude regime, structural properties of the Whitham\nmodulation equations are computed, including strict hyperbolicity, genuine\nnonlinearity, and linear degeneracy. Bifurcating from the NLS critical\nwavenumber at zero amplitude is an amplitude-dependent elliptic region for the\nWhitham equations within which a maximally unstable periodic wave is\nidentified. These results have implications for dispersive shock waves,\nrecently observed experimentally.\n", "  We study the effective theory of soft photons in slowly varying\nelectromagnetic background fields at one-loop order in QED. This is of\nrelevance for the study of all-optical signatures of quantum vacuum\nnonlinearity in realistic electromagnetic background fields as provided by\nhigh-intensity lasers. The central result derived in this article is a new\nanalytical expression for the photon polarization tensor in two linearly\npolarized counter-propagating pulsed Gaussian laser beams. As we treat the peak\nfield strengths of both laser beams as free parameters this field configuration\ncan be considered as interpolating between the limiting cases of a purely\nright- or left-moving laser beam (if one of the peak field strengths is set to\nzero) and the standing-wave type scenario with two counter-propagating beams of\nequal strength.\n", "  The highest-density magnetic storage media will code data in single-atom\nbits. To date, the smallest individually addressable bistable magnetic bits on\nsurfaces consist of 5-12 atoms. Long magnetic relaxation times were\ndemonstrated in molecular magnets containing one lanthanide atom, and recently\nin ensembles of single holmium (Ho) atoms supported on magnesium oxide (MgO).\nThose experiments indicated the possibility for data storage at the fundamental\nlimit, but it remained unclear how to access the individual magnetic centers.\nHere we demonstrate the reading and writing of individual Ho atoms on MgO, and\nshow that they independently retain their magnetic information over many hours.\nWe read the Ho states by tunnel magnetoresistance and write with current pulses\nusing a scanning tunneling microscope. The magnetic origin of the long-lived\nstates is confirmed by single-atom electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) on a\nnearby Fe sensor atom, which shows that Ho has a large out-of-plane moment of\n$(10.1 \\pm 0.1)$ $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ on this surface. In order to demonstrate\nindependent reading and writing, we built an atomic scale structure with two Ho\nbits to which we write the four possible states and which we read out remotely\nby EPR. The high magnetic stability combined with electrical reading and\nwriting shows that single-atom magnetic memory is possible.\n", "  We consider a sparse random network of excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire\nneurons with short-term synaptic depression. Furthermore to mimic the dynamics\nof a brain circuit in its first stages of development we introduce for each\nneuron correlations among in-degree and out-degree as well as among\nexcitability and the corresponding total degree, We analyze the influence of\nsingle neuron stimulation and deletion on the collective dynamics of the\nnetwork. We show the existence of a small group of neurons capable of\ncontrolling and even silencing the bursting activity of the network. These\nneurons form a functional clique since only their activation in a precise order\nand within specific time windows is capable to ignite population bursts.\n", "  The determination of the thermodynamic properties of clusters of galaxies at\nintermediate and high redshift can bring new insights into the formation of\nlarge-scale structures. It is essential for a robust calibration of the\nmass-observable scaling relations and their scatter, which are key ingredients\nfor precise cosmology using cluster statistics. Here we illustrate an\napplication of high resolution $(< 20$ arcsec) thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ)\nobservations by probing the intracluster medium (ICM) of the \\planck-discovered\ngalaxy cluster \\psz\\ at redshift $z = 0.61$, using tSZ data obtained with the\nNIKA camera, which is a dual-band (150 and 260~GHz) instrument operated at the\nIRAM 30-meter telescope. We deproject jointly NIKA and \\planck\\ data to extract\nthe electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core ($R \\sim 0.02\\,\nR_{500}$) to its outskirts ($R \\sim 3\\, R_{500}$) non-parametrically for the\nfirst time at intermediate redshift. The constraints on the resulting pressure\nprofile allow us to reduce the relative uncertainty on the integrated Compton\nparameter by a factor of two compared to the \\planck\\ value. Combining the tSZ\ndata and the deprojected electronic density profile from \\xmm\\ allows us to\nundertake a hydrostatic mass analysis, for which we study the impact of a\nspherical model assumption on the total mass estimate. We also investigate the\nradial temperature and entropy distributions. These data indicate that \\psz\\ is\na massive ($M_{500} \\sim 5.5 \\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$) cool-core cluster.\nThis work is part of a pilot study aiming at optimizing the treatment of the\nNIKA2 tSZ large program dedicated to the follow-up of SZ-discovered clusters at\nintermediate and high redshifts. (abridged)\n", "  We study holographic superconductor model with two scalar fields coupled to\none single Maxwell field in the AdS soliton background away from the probe\nlimit. We disclose properties of phase transitions mostly from the holographic\ntopological entanglement entropy approach. With different sets of parameters,\nwe observe various types of transitions, especially a new first order phase\ntransition between the condensation of different order parameters in the\ninsulator/superconductor system. Our results show that the entanglement entropy\nis a good probe to critical phase transition points and the order of phase\ntransitions in the two-order model. We also conclude that the entanglement\nentropy is useful to some extent in determining the physically supported\nphases. In addition, we investigate properties of the condensation through the\nscalar operator and the charge density in the dual theory. As a summary, we\ndraw the complete phase diagram of the effects of the scalar charge on phase\ntransitions. At last, we give some qualitative understanding and obtain the\nanalytical condition for the first order phase transition to occur.\n", "  Infrared divergences in QED and other theories with massless particles show\nthat in such theories the $S$ matrix cannot be defined in the usual way.\nTypically, this is not viewed as a big problem since one is interested in cross\nsections, in which the divergences cancel. Recently, one particular type of\ndivergences known as soft theorems was connected to a symmetry principle - the\nantipodal matching of large gauge transformations. However, there is a way to\ndefine an IR finite $S$ matrix in QED and similar theories by dropping the\nassumption of trivial asymptotic dynamics. In the present paper we investigate\nthe role of soft theorems and invariance under large gauge transformations in\nthe context of the finite $S$ matrix. Before doing so, the construction of\nasymptotic dynamics is reviewed and extended. The key results are that\nsubleading soft factors can be included in a natural way in the asymptotic\ndynamics. Once this is done, soft modes decouple from the IR finite $S$ matrix\nand this decoupling, which can be understood as a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry, is equivalent to the invariance under large gauge transformations (or\nin other words to the antipodal matching). To show this equivalence a special\nproperty for field operators at null infinity, i.e. for the program of\nasymptotic quantization, is assumed. Finally, we speculate about the\nmodification of the decoupling of soft modes in the presence of black holes.\n", "  Within the framework of Brans-Dicke gravity, we investigate inflation with\nthe quartic potential, $\\lambda\\varphi^4/4$, in the presence of generalized\nBrans-Dicke parameter $\\omega_{\\rm GBD}(\\varphi)$. We obtain the inflationary\nobservables containing the scalar spectral index, the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nthe running of the scalar spectral index and the equilateral non-Gaussianity\nparameter in terms of general form of the potential $U(\\varphi)$ and\n$\\omega_{\\rm GBD}(\\varphi)$. For the quartic potential, our results show that\nthe predictions of the model are in well agreement with the Planck 2015 data\nfor the generalized Brans-Dicke parameters $\\omega_{\\rm\nGBD}(\\varphi)=\\omega_0\\varphi^{n}$ and $\\omega_0e^{b\\varphi}$. This is in\ncontrast with both the Einstein and standard Brans-Dicke gravity, in which the\nresult of quartic potential is disfavored by the Planck data.\n", "  Suspensions of microswimmers are a rich source of fascinating new fluid\nmechanics. Recently we predicted the active pipe flow dispersion of gyrotactic\nmicroalgae, whose orientation is biased by gravity and flow shear. Analytical\ntheory predicts that these active swimmers disperse in a markedly distinct\nmanner from passive tracers (Taylor dispersion). Dispersing swimmers display\nnonzero drift and effective diffusivity that is non-monotonic with P$\\'e$clet\nnumber. Such predictions agree with numerical simulations, but hitherto have\nnot been tested experimentally. Here, to facilitate comparison, we obtain new\nsolutions of the axial dispersion theory accounting both for swimmer negative\nbuoyancy and a local nonlinear response of swimmers to shear, provided by two\nalternative microscopic stochastic descriptions. We obtain new predictions for\nsuspensions of the model swimming alga $\\it Dunaliella\\,salina$, whose motility\nand buoyant mass we parametrise using tracking video microscopy. We then\npresent a new experimental method to measure gyrotactic dispersion using\nfluorescently stained $\\it D. salina$ and provide a preliminary comparison with\npredictions of a nonzero drift above the mean flow for each microscopic\nstochastic description. Finally, we propose further experiments for a full\nexperimental characterisation of gyrotactic dispersion measures and discuss\nimplications of our results for algal dispersion in industrial\nphotobioreactors.\n", "  Despite advances in low-light level detection, single-photon methods such as\nphoton correlation have rarely been used in the context of imaging. The few\ndemonstrations, for example of sub-diffraction limited imaging utilizing\nquantum statistics of photons, have remained in the realm of proof-of-principle\ndemonstrations. This is primarily due to a combination of low values of fill\nfactors, quantum efficiencies, frame rates and signal-to-noise characteristic\nof most available single-photon sensitive imaging detectors. Here we describe\nan imaging device based on a fiber bundle coupled to single-photon avalanche\ndetectors, which combines a large fill factor, a high quantum efficiency, a low\nnoise and scalable architecture. Our device enables localization based\nsuper-resolution microscopy in a non-sparse non-stationary scene, utilizing\ninformation on the number of active emitters, as gathered from non-classical\nphoton statistics.\n", "  We study the localization in the one-dimensional trap model in terms of\nstatistical mechanics of trajectories. By numerically investigating overlap\nbetween trajectories of two particles on a common disordered potential, we find\nthat there is a phase transition in the path ensemble. We characterize the low\ntemperature phase as a replica symmetry breaking phase in trajectory space.\n", "  Milestoning is a computational procedure that reduces the dynamics of complex\nsystems to memoryless jumps between intermediates, or milestones, and only\nretains some information about the probability of these jumps and the time lags\nbetween them. Here we analyze a variant of this procedure, termed optimal\nmilestoning, which relies on a specific choice of milestones to capture exactly\nsome kinetic features of the original dynamical system. In particular, we prove\nthat optimal milestoning permits the exact calculation of the mean first\npassage times (MFPT) between any two milestones. In so doing, we also analyze\nanother variant of the method, called exact milestoning, which also permits the\nexact calculation of certain MFPTs, but at the price of retaining more\ninformation about the original system's dynamics. Finally, we discuss\nimportance sampling strategies based on optimal and exact milestoning that can\nbe used to bypass the simulation of the original system when estimating the\nstatistical quantities used in these methods.\n", "  We present a thorough stability analysis of modified gravity theories in the\npresence of matter fields. We use the Effective Field Theory framework for Dark\nEnergy and Modified Gravity to retain a general approach for the gravity sector\nand a Sorkin-Schutz action for the matter one. Then, we work out the proper\nviability conditions to guarantee in the scalar sector the absence of ghosts,\ngradient and tachyonic instabilities. The absence of ghosts can be achieved by\ndemanding a positive kinetic matrix, while the lack of a gradient instability\nis ensured by imposing a positive speed of propagation for all the scalar\nmodes. In case of tachyonic instability, the mass eigenvalues have been studied\nand we work out the appropriate expressions. For the latter, an instability\noccurs only when the negative mass eigenvalue is much larger, in absolute\nvalue, than the Hubble parameter. We discuss the results for the minimally\ncoupled quintessence model showing for a particular set of parameters two\ntypical behaviours which in turn lead to a stable and an unstable\nconfiguration. Moreover, we find that the speeds of propagation of the scalar\nmodes strongly depend on matter densities, for the beyond Horndeski theories.\nOur findings can be directly employed when testing modified gravity theories as\nthey allow to identify the correct viability space.\n", "  We present a dark sector model based on gauging the $L_\\mu - L_\\tau$ symmetry\nthat addresses anomalies in $b \\rightarrow s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decays and that\nfeatures a particle dark matter candidate. The dark matter particle candidate\nis a vector-like Dirac fermion coupled to the $Z^\\prime$ gauge boson of the\n$L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ symmetry. We compute the dark matter thermal relic density,\nits pair-annihilation cross section, and the loop-suppressed dark\nmatter-nucleon scattering cross section, and compare our predictions with\ncurrent and future experimental results. We demonstrate that after taking into\naccount bounds from $B_s$ meson oscillations, dark matter direct detection, and\nthe CMB, the model is highly predictive: $B$ physics anomalies and a viable\nparticle dark matter candidate, with a mass of $\\sim (5-23)$~GeV, can be\naccommodated only in a tightly-constrained region of parameter space, with\nsharp predictions for future experimental tests. The viable region of parameter\nspace expands if the dark matter is allowed to have $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ charges that\nare smaller than those of the SM leptons.\n", "  The emergence of politically driven divisions in online discussion networks\nhas attracted a wealth of literature, but also one which has thus far been\nlargely limited to single country studies. Hence whilst there is good evidence\nthat these networks do divide and fragment into what are often described as\n\"echo chambers\", we know little about the factors which might explain this\ndivision or make networks more or less fragmented, as studies have been limited\nto a small number of political groupings with limited possibilities for\nsystematic comparison.\n  This paper seeks to remedy this deficit, by providing a systematic large\nscale study of fragmentation on Twitter which considers discussion networks\nsurrounding 90 different political parties in 23 different countries. It shows\nthat political party groupings which are further apart in ideological terms\ninteract less, and that individuals and parties which sit at the extreme ends\nof the ideological scale are particularly likely to form echo chambers. Indeed,\nexchanges between centrist parties who sit on different sides of the left-right\ndivide are more likely than communication between centrist and extremist\nparties who are, notionally, from the same ideological wing. In light of the\nresults, theory about exposure to different ideological viewpoints online is\ndiscussed and enhanced.\n", "  The Sun provides us with the only spatially well-resolved astrophysical\nexample of turbulent thermal convection. While various aspects of solar\nphotospheric turbulence, such as granulation (one-Megameter horizontal scale),\nare well understood, the questions of the physical origin and dynamical\norganization of larger-scale flows, such as the 30-Megameters supergranulation\nand flows deep in the solar convection zone, remain largely open in spite of\ntheir importance for solar dynamics and magnetism. Here, we present a new\ncritical global observational characterization of multiscale photospheric flows\nand subsequently formulate an anisotropic extension of the Bolgiano-Obukhov\ntheory of hydrodynamic stratified turbulence that may explain several of their\ndistinctive dynamical properties. Our combined analysis suggests that\nphotospheric flows in the horizontal range of scales between supergranulation\nand granulation have a typical vertical correlation scale of 2.5 to 4\nMegameters and operate in a strongly anisotropic, self-similar, nonlinear,\nbuoyant dynamical regime. While the theory remains speculative at this stage,\nit lends itself to quantitative comparisons with future high-resolution\nacoustic tomography of subsurface layers and advanced numerical models. Such a\nvalidation exercise may also lead to new insights into the asymptotic dynamical\nregimes in which other, unresolved turbulent anisotropic astrophysical fluid\nsystems supporting waves or instabilities operate.\n", "  We determine the thermal conductance of thin niobium (Nb) wires on a silica\nsubstrate in the temperature range of 0.1 - 0.6 K using electron thermometry\nbased on normal metal-insulator-superconductor tunnel junctions. We find that\nat 0.6 K, the thermal conductance of Nb is two orders of magnitude lower than\nthat of Al in the superconducting state, and two orders of magnitude below the\nWiedemann-Franz conductance calculated with the normal state resistance of the\nwire. The measured thermal conductance exceeds the prediction of the\nBardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, and demonstrates a power law dependence on\ntemperature as $T^{4.5}$, instead of an exponential one. At the same time, we\nmonitor the temperature profile of the substrate along the Nb wire to observe\npossible overheating of the phonon bath. We show that Nb can be successfully\nused for thermal insulation in a nanoscale circuit while simultaneously\nproviding an electrical connection.\n", "  In experiments with superconducting quantum circuits, characterizing the\nphoton statistics of propagating microwave fields is a fundamental task. We\nquantify the $n^{2}\\,{+}\\,n$ photon number variance of thermal microwave\nphotons emitted from a black-body radiator for mean photon numbers\n$0.05\\,{\\lesssim}\\,n\\,{\\lesssim}\\,1.5$. We probe the fields using either\ncorrelation measurements or a transmon qubit coupled to a microwave resonator.\nOur experiments provide a precise quantitative characterization of weak\nmicrowave states and information on the noise emitted by a Josephson parametric\namplifier.\n", "  Given a Lie-Poisson completely integrable bi-Hamiltonian system on\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$, we present a method which allows us to construct, under certain\nconditions, a completely integrable bi-Hamiltonian deformation of the initial\nLie-Poisson system on a non-abelian Poisson-Lie group $G_\\eta$ of dimension\n$n$, where $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the deformation parameter. Moreover, we\nshow that from the two multiplicative (Poisson-Lie) Hamiltonian structures on\n$G_\\eta$ that underly the dynamics of the deformed system and by making use of\nthe group law on $G_\\eta$, one may obtain two completely integrable Hamiltonian\nsystems on $G_\\eta \\times G_\\eta$. By construction, both systems admit\nreduction, via the multiplication in $G_\\eta$, to the deformed bi-Hamiltonian\nsystem in $G_\\eta$. The previous approach is applied to two relevant\nLie-Poisson completely integrable bi-Hamiltonian systems: the Lorenz and Euler\ntop systems.\n", "  We report a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy study of the charge\ndensity wave (CDW) order in 1$T$-TiSe$_2$ and Cu$_{0.08}$TiSe$_2$. In pristine\n1$T$-TiSe$_2$ we observe a long-range coherent commensurate CDW (C-CDW) order.\nIn contrast, Cu$_{0.08}$TiSe$_{2}$ displays an incommensurate CDW (I-CDW) phase\nwith localized C-CDW domains separated by domain walls. Density of states\nmeasurements indicate that the domain walls host an extra population of\nfermions near the Fermi level which may play a role in the emergence of\nsuperconductivity in this system. Fourier transform scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy studies suggest that the dominant mechanism for CDW formation in\nthe I-CDW phase may be electron-phonon coupling.\n", "  We present an experimental and computational study of the nonlinear optical\nresponse of conduction electrons to intense terahertz (THz) electric field. Our\nobservations (saturable absorption and an amplitude-dependent group refractive\nindex) can be understood on the qualitative level as the breakdown of the\neffective mass approximation. However, a predictive theoretical description of\nthe nonlinearity has been missing. We propose a model based on the\nsemiclassical electron dynamics, a realistic band structure, and the free\nelectron Drude parameters to accurately calculate the experimental observables\nin InSb. Our results open a path to predictive modeling of the\nconduction-electron optical nonlinearity in semiconductors, metamaterials, as\nwell as high-field effects in THz plasmonics.\n", "  Counterdiabatic driving (CD) exploits auxiliary control fields to tailor the\nnonequilibrium dynamics of a quantum system, making possible the suppression of\ndissipated work in finite-time thermodynamics and the engineering of optimal\nthermal machines with no friction. We show that while the mean work done by the\nauxiliary controls vanishes, CD leads to a broadening of the work distribution.\nWe derive a fundamental inequality that relates nonequilibrium work\nfluctuations to the operation time and quantifies the thermodynamic cost of CD\nin both critical and noncritical systems.\n", "  Quantum mechanics allows paraparticles with mixed Bose-Fermi statistics that\nhave not been experimentally confirmed. We propose a trapped-ion scheme whose\neffective dynamics are equivalent to a driven para-Bose oscillator of even\norder. Our mapping suggest highly entangled vibrational and internal ion states\nas the laboratory equivalent of quantum simulated parabosons. Furthermore, we\nshow the generation and reconstruction of coherent oscillations and para-Bose\nanalogs of Gilmore-Perelomov coherent states from population inversion\nmeasurements in the laboratory frame. Our proposal, apart from demonstrating an\nanalog quantum simulator of para-Bose oscillators, provides a quantum state\nengineering tool that foreshadows the potential use of paraparticle dynamics in\nthe design of quantum information systems.\n", "  We present an alternative interpretation within the Standard Model of the new\nLHC resonance at $125 \\; GeV$. We further elaborate on our previous proposal\nthat the resonance at 125 GeV could be interpreted as a pseudoscalar meson with\nquantum number $J^{PC} = 0^{- +}$. We develop a phenomenological approach where\nthis pseudoscalar mimics the decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the\nvector boson decay channels. We propose that the true Higgs boson should be a\nheavy resonance with mass of $750 \\, GeV$ as argued in Ref.~\\cite{Cea:2012}. We\ndetermine the most relevant decay modes and estimate the partial decay widths\nand branching ratios. We also discuss briefly the experimental signatures of\nthis heavy Higgs boson. Finally, we attempt a comparison of our theoretical\nexpectations with recent data at $\\sqrt{s} =13 \\,TeV$ from ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments in the so-called golden channel. We find that the available\nexperimental data could be consistent with the heavy Higgs scenario.\n", "  In this article, we introduce the method of urban association rules and its\nuses for extracting frequently appearing combinations of stores that are\nvisited together to characterize shoppers' behaviors. The Apriori algorithm is\nused to extract the association rules (i.e., if -> result) from customer\ntransaction datasets in a market-basket analysis. An application to our\nlarge-scale and anonymized bank card transaction dataset enables us to output\nlinked trips for shopping all over the city: the method enables us to predict\nthe other shops most likely to be visited by a customer given a particular shop\nthat was already visited as an input. In addition, our methodology can consider\nall transaction activities conducted by customers for a whole city in addition\nto the location of stores dispersed in the city. This approach enables us to\nuncover not only simple linked trips such as transition movements between\nstores but also the edge weight for each linked trip in the specific district.\nThus, the proposed methodology can complement conventional research methods.\nEnhancing understanding of people's shopping behaviors could be useful for city\nauthorities and urban practitioners for effective urban management. The results\nalso help individual retailers to rearrange their services by accommodating the\nneeds of their customers' habits to enhance their shopping experience.\n", "  Massive binaries (MBs) play a crucial role in the Universe. Knowing the\ndistributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range\nof topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the\ndistribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no\ndirect measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary\nMonitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial\nvelocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32\nVLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier\nanalysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are\nremarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic\nsamples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects\nare of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is\nfound in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter\n(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible\nwithin error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs\nin 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal\nmass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young\nand massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the\nfact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than\nlatter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the\nincidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar\n($Z_{\\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\\odot}$. This provides the first direct\nconstraints on MB properties in massive star-forming galaxies at the Universes\npeak of star formation at redshifts z~1 to 2, which are estimated to have\n$Z~0.5Z_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We report gate-tunable memristive switching in patterned LaAlO3/SrTiO3\ninterfaces at cryogenic temperatures. The application of voltages in the order\nof a few volts to the back gate of the device allows controlling and\nswitching-on and -off the inherent memory functionality (memristance). For\nlarge and small gate voltages a simple non-linear resistance characteristic is\nobserved while a pinched hysteresis loop and memristive switching occurs in an\nintermediate voltage range. The memristance is further controlled by the\ndensity of oxygen vacancies, which is tuned by annealing the sample at 300\n{\\deg}C in nitrogen atmosphere. Depending on the annealing time the memristance\nat zero gate voltage can be switched on and off leading to normally-on and\nnormally-off memristors. The presented device offers reversible and\nirreversible control of memristive characteristics by gate voltages and\nannealing, respectively, which may allow to compensate fabrication\nvariabilities of memristors that complicate the realization of large\nmemristor-based neural networks.\n", "  An optical microscope is described that reveals contrast in the Mueller\nmatrix images of a thin, transparent or semi-transparent specimen located\nwithin an anisotropic object plane (anisotropic filter). The specimen changes\nthe anisotropy of the filter and thereby produces contrast within the Mueller\nmatrix images. Here we use an anisotropic filter composed of a\nsemi-transparent, nanostructured thin film with sub-wavelength thickness placed\nwithin the object plane. The sample is illuminated as in common optical\nmicroscopy but the light is modulated in its polarization using combinations of\nlinear polarizers and phase plate (compensator) to control and analyze the\nstate of polarization. Direct generalized ellipsometry data analysis approaches\npermit extraction of fundamental Mueller matrix object plane images dispensing\nwith the need of Fourier expansion methods. Generalized ellipsometry model\napproaches are used for quantitative image analyses. We demonstrate the\nanisotropic contrast optical microscope by measuring lithographically defined\nmicro-patterned anisotropic filters, and we quantify the adsorption of an\norganic self-assembled monolayer film onto the anisotropic filter. In our\ncurrent instrument we estimate the limit of detection for organic volumetric\nmass within the object plane of $\\approx$ 49 fg within $\\approx$\n7$\\times$7~$\\mu$m$^2$ object surface area. Compared to a quartz crystal\nmicrobalance with dissipation instrumentation, where contemporary limits\nrequire a total load of $\\approx$ 500~pg for detection, the instrumentation\ndemonstrated here improves sensitivity to a total mass required for detection\nby 4 orders of magnitude. We present further applications to detection of\nnanoparticles, to novel approaches for imaging chromatography, and to new\ncontrast modalities for observations on living cells.\n", "  We consider the scale-invariant inflationary model studied in [1]. The\nLagrangian includes all the scale-invariant operators that can be built with\ncombinations of $R$, $R^2$ and one scalar field. The equations of motion show\nthat the symmetry is spontaneously broken after an arbitrarily long\ninflationary period and a fundamental mass scale is generated. Upon symmetry\nbreaking, and in the Jordan frame, both Hubble function and the scalar field\nundergo damped oscillations that can eventually amplify Standard Model fields\nand reheat the Universe. In the present work, we study in detail inflation and\nthe reheating mechanism of this model in the Einstein frame and we compare some\nof the results with the latest observational data.\n", "  The redistribution of electrical currents in resistor networks after\nsingle-bond failures is analyzed in terms of current-redistribution factors\nthat are shown to depend only on the topology of the network and on the values\nof the bond resistances. We investigate the properties of these\ncurrent-redistribution factors for regular network topologies (e.g.\n$d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices) as well as for small-world networks. In\nparticular, we find that the statistics of the current redistribution factors\nexhibits a fat-tail behavior, which reflects the long-range nature of the\ncurrent redistribution as determined by Kirchhoff's circuit laws.\n", "  The highly variable dynamics of neocortical circuits observed in vivo have\nbeen hypothesized to represent a signature of ongoing stochastic inference but\nstand in apparent contrast to the deterministic response of neurons measured in\nvitro. Based on a propagation of the membrane autocorrelation across spike\nbursts, we provide an analytical derivation of the neural activation function\nthat holds for a large parameter space, including the high-conductance state.\nOn this basis, we show how an ensemble of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with\nconductance-based synapses embedded in a spiking environment can attain the\ncorrect firing statistics for sampling from a well-defined target distribution.\nFor recurrent networks, we examine convergence toward stationarity in computer\nsimulations and demonstrate sample-based Bayesian inference in a mixed\ngraphical model. This points to a new computational role of high-conductance\nstates and establishes a rigorous link between deterministic neuron models and\nfunctional stochastic dynamics on the network level.\n", "  Neutral particles subject to artificial gauge potentials can behave as\ncharged particles in magnetic fields. This fascinating premise has led to\ndemonstrations of one-way waveguides, topologically protected edge states and\nLandau levels for photons. In ultracold neutral atoms effective gauge fields\nhave allowed the emulation of matter under strong magnetic fields leading to\nrealization of Harper-Hofstadter and Haldane models. Here we show that\napplication of perpendicular electric and magnetic fields effects a tuneable\nartificial gauge potential for two-dimensional microcavity exciton polaritons.\nFor verification, we perform interferometric measurement of the associated\nphase accumulated during coherent polariton transport. Since the gauge\npotential originates from the magnetoelectric Stark effect, it can be realized\nfor photons strongly coupled to excitations in any polarizable medium. Together\nwith strong polariton- polariton interactions and engineered polariton\nlattices, artificial gauge fields could play a key role in investigation of\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated photons.\n", "  The Gribov problem in the presence of a background field is analyzed: in\nparticular, we study the Gribov copies equation in the Landau-De Witt gauge as\nwell as the semi-classical Gribov gap equation. As background field, we choose\nthe simplest non-trivial one which corresponds to a constant gauge potential\nwith non-vanishing component along the Euclidean time direction. This kind of\nconstant non-Abelian background fields is very relevant in relation with (the\ncomputation of) the Polyakov loop but it also appears when one considers the\nnon-Abelian Schwinger effect. We show that the Gribov copies equation is\naffected directly by the presence of the background field, constructing an\nexplicit example. The analysis of the Gribov gap equation shows that the larger\nthe background field, the smaller the Gribov mass parameter. These results\nstrongly suggest that the relevance of the Gribov copies (from the path\nintegral point of view) decreases as the size of the background field\nincreases.\n", "  A sigma-Fe54.5Cr45.5 samples irradiated in vacuum with 2 MeV Fe3+ ions at\n300, 400, 475 and 700 deg C to the maximum dose of 12.5 dpa were studied with\nthe conversion electron M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy (CEMS). The analysis of the\nroom temperature CEMS spectra revealed an irradiation-induced redistribution of\nFe atoms viz. their number on B and D sites decreased while on A, C and E sites\nincreased. The degree of the redistribution was found to be proportional to the\nnumber of Fe atoms present on the lattice sites in the non-irradiated samples.\nThe highest degree of the redistribution was revealed in the sample irradiated\nat 300 deg C. No change in the site occupancy was found in the sample\nirradiated at 700 deg C.\n", "  A process which strongly amplifies both quadrature amplitudes of an\noscillatory signal necessarily adds noise. Alternatively, if the information in\none quadrature is lost in phase-sensitive amplification, it is possible to\ncompletely reconstruct the other quadrature. Here we demonstrate such a nearly\nperfect phase-sensitive measurement using a cavity optomechanical scheme,\ncharacterized by an extremely small noise less than 0.2 quanta. We also observe\nmicrowave radiation strongly squeezed by 8 dB below vacuum. A source of bright\nsqueezed microwaves opens up applications in manipulations of quantum systems,\nand noiseless amplification can be used even at modest cryogenic temperatures.\n", "  We compute parameters characterizing many-body quantum chaos for a critical\nFermi surface without quasiparticle excitations. We examine a theory of $N$\nspecies of fermions at non-zero density coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field in two\nspatial dimensions, and determine the Lyapunov rate and the butterfly velocity\nin an extended random-phase approximation. The thermal diffusivity is found to\nbe universally related to these chaos parameters i.e. the relationship is\nindependent of $N$, the gauge coupling constant, the Fermi velocity, the Fermi\nsurface curvature, and high energy details.\n", "  Magnetoelectric properties are studied by a combined experimental and\ntheoretical study of a quasi-two-dimensional material composed of square\ncupolas, Ba(TiO)Cu$_4$(PO$_4$)$_4$. The magnetization is measured up to above\nthe saturation field, and several anomalies are observed depending on the field\ndirections. We propose a $S$=1/2 spin model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions, which well reproduces the full magnetization curves. Elaborating\nthe phase diagram of the model, we show that the anomalies are explained by\nmagnetoelectric phase transitions. Our theory also accounts for the scaling of\nthe dielectric anomaly observed in experiments. The results elucidate the\ncrucial role of the in-plane component of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions,\nwhich is induced by the noncoplanar buckling of square cupola. We also predict\na `hidden' phase and another magnetoelectric response both of which appear in\nnonzero magnetic field.\n", "  While diproton decay was first theorized in 1960 and first measured in 2002,\nit was first observed only in 2012. The measurement of $^{14}$Be in coincidence\nwith two neutrons suggests that $^{16}$Be does decay through the simultaneous\nemission of two strongly correlated neutrons. In this work, we construct a full\nthree-body model of $^{16}$Be (as $^{14}$Be + n + n) in order to investigate\nits configuration in the continuum and in particular the structure of its\nground state. In order to describe the three-body system, effective n-$^{14}$Be\npotentials were constructed, constrained by the experimental information on\n$^{15}$Be. The hyperspherical R-matrix method was used to solve the three-body\nscattering problem, and the resonance energy of $^{16}$Be was extracted from a\nphase shift analysis. In order to reproduce the experimental resonance energy\nof $^{16}$Be within this three-body model, a three-body interaction was needed.\nFor extracting the width of the ground state of $^{16}$Be, we use the full\nwidth at half maximum of the derivative of the three-body phase shifts and the\nwidth of the three-body elastic scattering cross section. Our results confirm a\ndineutron structure for $^{16}$Be, dependent on the internal structure of the\nsubsystem $^{15}$Be.\n", "  Motivated by the fact that, so far, the whole body of evidence for dark\nmatter is of gravitational origin, we study the decays of dark matter into\nStandard Model particles mediated by gravity portals, i.e., through nonminimal\ngravitational interactions of dark matter. We investigate the decays in several\nwidely studied frameworks of scalar and fermionic dark matter where the dark\nmatter is stabilized in flat spacetime via global symmetries. We find that the\nconstraints on the scalar singlet dark matter candidate are remarkably strong\nand exclude large regions of the parameter space, suggesting that an additional\nstabilizing symmetry should be in place. In contrast, the scalar doublet and\nthe fermionic singlet candidates are naturally protected against too fast\ndecays by gauge and Lorentz symmetry, respectively. For a nonminimal coupling\nparameter $\\xi\\sim {\\cal{O}}(1)$, decays through the gravity portal are\nconsistent with observations if the dark matter mass is smaller than $\\sim\n10^5$ GeV, for the scalar doublet, and $\\sim 10^6$ GeV, for the fermionic\nsinglet.\n", "  We study the preparation of entangled pure Gaussian states via reservoir\nengineering. In particular, we consider a chain consisting of $(2\\aleph+1)$\nquantum harmonic oscillators where the central oscillator of the chain is\ncoupled to a single reservoir. We then completely parametrize the class of\n$(2\\aleph+1)$-mode pure Gaussian states that can be prepared by this type of\nquantum harmonic oscillator chain. This parametrization allows us to determine\nthe steady-state entanglement properties of such quantum harmonic oscillator\nchains.\n", "  Supersymmetric composite generalized quantum integrable models solvable by\nthe algebraic Bethe ansatz are studied. Using a coproduct in the bialgebra of\nmonodromy matrix elements and their action on Bethe vectors, formulas for Bethe\nvectors in the composite models with supersymmetry based on the super-Yangians\n$Y[\\mathfrak{gl}(2|1)]$ and $Y[\\mathfrak{gl}(1|2)]$ are derived.\n", "  It is usually assumed that we will need to wait until next-generation surveys\nlike Euclid, LSST and SKA, in order to improve on the current best constraints\non primordial non-Gaussianity from the Planck experiment. We show that two\ncontemporary surveys, with the SKA precursor MeerKAT and the Dark Energy Survey\n(DES), can be combined using the multi-tracer technique to deliver an accuracy\non measurement of $f_{\\rm NL}$ that is up to three times better than Planck.\n", "  Recent observations of Kepler multi-planet systems have revealed a number of\nsystems with planets very close to second-order mean motion resonances (MMRs,\nwith period ratio $1:3$, $3:5$, etc.) We present an analytic study of resonance\ncapture and its stability for planets migrating in gaseous disks. Resonance\ncapture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently\nlarge eccentricity damping timescale $T_e$ and small pre-resonance\neccentricities. We quantify these requirements and find that they can be\nsatisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. For planets\ncaptured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which\neccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances\neccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that this\n\"captured\" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent\nescape of the planets from the resonance. In general, the stability of the\ncaptured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$ and\nthe ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The overstability growth time is\nof order $T_e$, but can be much larger for systems close to the stability\nthreshold. For low-mass planets undergoing type I (non-gap opening) migration,\nconvergent migration requires $q \\lesssim 1$, while the stability of the\ncapture requires $q\\gtrsim 1$. These results suggest that planet pairs stably\ncaptured into second-order MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to\nfirst-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space exists for stable resonance\ncapture. We confirm and extend our analytical results with $N$-body\nsimulations, and show that for overstable capture, the escape time from the MMR\ncan be comparable to the time the planets spend migrating between resonances.\n", "  This paper exposes in a detailed manner the recent findings about the SU(2)\nscenario for the underdoped phase of the Cuprate superconductors. The SU(2)\nsymmetry is formulated as a rotation between the $d$-wave SC phase and a\n$d$-wave charge order. We define the operators responsible for the SU(2)\nrotations and we derive the non-linear $\\sigma$-model associated with it. In\nthis framework, we demonstrate that SU(2) fluctuations are massless in finite\nportions of the Brillouin Zone corresponding to the anti-nodal regions\n($0,$$\\pi$), ($\\pi,0$). We argue that the presence of SU(2) fluctuations in the\nanti-nodal region leads to the opening of Fermi arcs around the Fermi surface\nand to the formation of the pseudo-gap. Moreover, we show that SU(2)\nfluctuations lead, in turn, to the emergence of a finite momentum SC order -or\nPair Density Wave (PDW)- and more importantly to a new kind of excitonic\nparticle-hole pairs liquid, the Resonant Excitonic State (RES), which is made\nof patches of preformed particle-hole pairs with multiple momenta. When the RES\nliquid becomes critical, we demonstrate that electronic scattering through the\ncritical modes leads to anomalous transport properties. This new finding can\naccount for the Strange Metal (SM) phase at finite temperature, on the right\nhand side of the SC dome, shedding light on another notoriously mysterious part\nof the phase diagram of the Cuprates.\n", "  We give evidence for intrinsic, defect-induced bulk paramagnetism in SiC by\nmeans of $^{13}$C and $^{29}$Si nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.\nThe temperature dependence of the internal dipole-field distribution, probed by\nthe spin part of the NMR Knight shift and the spectral linewidth, follows a\nCurie law and scales very well with the macroscopic DC susceptibility. In order\nto quantitatively analyze the NMR spectra, a microscopic model based on\ndipole-dipole interactions was developed. The very good agreement between these\nsimulations and the NMR data establishes a direct relation between the\nfrequency distribution of the spectral intensity and the corresponding\nreal-space volumes of nuclear spins. The presented approach by NMR can be\napplied to a variety of similar materials and, thus, opens a new avenue for the\nmicroscopic exploration and exploitation of diluted bulk magnetism in\nsemiconductors.\n", "  We show there are analogues to the Unruh temperature that can be defined for\nany quantum field theory and region of the space. These local temperatures are\ndefined using relative entropy with localized excitations. We show important\nrestrictions arise from relative entropy inequalities and causal propagation\nbetween Cauchy surfaces. These suggest a large amount of universality for local\ntemperatures, specially the ones affecting null directions. For regions with\nany number of intervals in two space-time dimensions the local temperatures\nmight arise from a term in the modular Hamiltonian proportional to the stress\ntensor. We argue this term might be universal, with a coefficient that is the\nsame for any theory, and check analytically and numerically this is the case\nfor free massive scalar and Dirac fields. In dimensions $d\\ge 3$ the local\nterms in the modular Hamiltonian producing these local temperatures cannot be\nformed exclusively from the stress tensor. For a free scalar field we classify\nthe structure of the local terms.\n", "  We describe and demonstrate the potential of a new and very efficient method\nfor simulating certain classes of modified gravity theories, such as the widely\nstudied $f(R)$ gravity models. High resolution simulations for such models are\ncurrently very slow due to the highly nonlinear partial differential equation\nthat needs to be solved exactly to predict the modified gravitational force.\nThis nonlinearity is partly inherent, but is also exacerbated by the specific\nnumerical algorithm used, which employs a variable redefinition to prevent\nnumerical instabilities. The standard Newton-Gauss-Seidel iterative method used\nto tackle this problem has a poor convergence rate. Our new method not only\navoids this, but also allows the discretised equation to be written in a form\nthat is analytically solvable. We show that this new method greatly improves\nthe performance and efficiency of $f(R)$ simulations. For example, a test\nsimulation with $512^3$ particles in a box of size $512 \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}/h$ is\nnow 5 times faster than before, while a Millennium-resolution simulation for\n$f(R)$ gravity is estimated to be more than 20 times faster than with the old\nmethod. Our new implementation will be particularly useful for running very\nhigh resolution, large-sized simulations which, to date, are only possible for\nthe standard model, and also makes it feasible to run large numbers of lower\nresolution simulations for covariance analyses. We hope that the method will\nbring us to a new era for precision cosmological tests of gravity.\n", "  We calculate the thermal diffusivity $D = \\kappa/c_{\\rho}$ and butterfly\nvelocity $v_B$ in holographic models that flow to AdS$_2 \\times R^{d}$ fixed\npoints in the infra-red. We show that both these quantities are governed by the\nsame irrelevant deformation of AdS$_2$ and hence establish a simple\nrelationship between them. When this deformation corresponds to a universal\ndilaton mode of dimension $\\Delta = 2$ then this relationship is always given\nby $D = v_B^2/(2 \\pi T)$.\n", "  In the framework of the emergent gravity scenario by Verlinde, it was\nrecently observed by Liu and Prokopec that, among other things, an anomalous\npericenter precession would affect the orbital motion of a test particle\norbiting an isolated central body. Here, it is shown that, if it were real, its\nexpected magnitude for the inner planets of the Solar System would be at the\nsame level of the present-day accuracy in constraining any possible deviations\nfrom their standard perihelion precessions as inferred from long data records\nspanning about the last century. The most favorable situation for testing the\nVerlinde-type precession seems to occur for Mars. Indeed, according to recent\nversions of the EPM and INPOP planetary ephemerides, non-standard perihelion\nprecessions, of whatsoever physical origin, which are larger than some $\\approx\n0.02-0.11$ milliarcseconds per century are not admissible, while the putative\nprecession predicted by Liu and Prokopec amounts to $0.09$ milliarcseconds per\ncentury. Other potentially interesting astronomical and astrophysical scenarios\nlike, e.g., the Earth's LAGEOS II artificial satellite, the double pulsar\nsystem PSR J0737-3039A/B and the S-stars orbiting the Supermassive Black Hole\nin Sgr A$^\\ast$ are, instead, not viable because of the excessive smallness of\nthe predicted effects for them.\n", "  We report on an investigation of the redistribution of interlayer coherence\nin the trilayer cuprate Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10. The experiment is performed under the\nsame apical-oxygen phonon excitation discussed in the past for the bilayer\ncuprate YBa2Cu3O6.5. In Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10, we observe a similar spectral weight\nloss at the transverse plasma mode resonance seen in YBa2Cu3O6.5. However, this\nfeature is not accompanied by light-enhanced interlayer coherence that was seen\nin YBa2Cu3O6+x, for which the transverse plasma mode is observed at equilibrium\neven in the normal state. These new observations offer new experimental\nperspective in the context of the physics of light-enhanced interlayer coupling\nin various cuprates.\n", "  Using intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) spectroscopy, we\nstudied SnS contacts in the layered oxypnictide superconductors\nSm$_{1-x}$Th$_x$OFeAs with various thorium doping and critical temperatures\n$T_C = 21-54$ K. We observe a scaling between both superconducting gaps and\n$T_C$. The determined BCS-ratio for the large gap $2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C = 5.0-5.7$\nand its eigen BCS-ratio (in a hypothetical case of zero interband coupling)\n$2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C^L = 4.1-4.6$ both exceeding the weak-coupling limit 3.52, and\nfor the small gap $2\\Delta_S/k_BT_C = 1.2-1.6$ remain nearly constant within\nall the $T_C$ range studied. The temperature dependences $\\Delta_{L,S}(T)$\nagree well with a two-band BCS-like Moskalenko and Suhl model. We prove\nintraband coupling to be stronger than interband coupling, whereas and Coulomb\nrepulsion constants $\\mu^{\\ast}$ are finite in Sm-based oxypnictides.\n", "  We consider the discrete and continuous vector non-linear Schrodinger (NLS)\nmodel. We focus on the case where space-like local discontinuities are present,\nand we are primarily interested in the time evolution on the defect point. This\nin turn yields the time part of a typical Darboux-Backlund transformation.\nWithin this spirit we then explicitly work out the generic Backlund\ntransformation and the dressing associated to both discrete and continuous\nspectrum, i.e. the Darboux transformation is expressed in the matrix and\nintegral representation respectively.\n", "  Understanding the emergence of strong controversial issues in modern\nsocieties is a key issue in opinion studies. A commonly diffused idea is the\nfact that the increasing of homophily in social networks, due to the modern\nICT, can be a driving force for opinion polariation. In this paper we address\nthe problem with a modelling approach following three basic steps. We first\nintroduce a network morphogenesis model to reconstruct network structures where\nhomophily can be tuned with a parameter. We show that as homophily increases\nthe emergence of marked topological community structures in the networks\nraises. Secondly, we perform an opinion dynamics process on homophily dependent\nnetworks and we show that, contrary to the common idea, homophily helps\nconsensus formation. Finally, we introduce a tunable external media pressure\nand we show that, actually, the combination of homophily and media makes the\nmedia effect less effective and leads to strongly polarized opinion clusters.\n", "  The ratio of branching fractions and the difference in $CP$ asymmetries of\nthe decays $B^+\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$ and $B^+\\to J/\\psi K^+$ are measured using a\ndata sample of $pp$ collisions collected by the LHCb experiment, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of $3~{{\\,\\mbox{fb}^{-1}}}$ at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 7 and $8~\\mathrm{\\,Te\\kern -0.1em V}$. The results are\n\\begin{equation*} {\\mathcal{B}(B^+\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+)\\over\\mathcal{B}(B^+\\to\nJ/\\psi K^+)}=(3.83\\pm0.03\\pm0.03)\\times10^{-2}\\,, \\end{equation*}\n\\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{A}^{CP}(B^+\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+)-\\mathcal{A}^{CP}(B^+\\to\nJ/\\psi K^+)=(1.82\\pm0.86\\pm0.14)\\times10^{-2}, \\end{equation*} where the first\nuncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic. Combining this\nresult with a recent LHCb measurement of $\\mathcal{A}^{CP}(B^+\\to J/\\psi K^+)$\nprovides the most precise estimate to date of $CP$ violation in the decay\n$B^+\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+$, \\begin{equation*} \\mathcal{A}^{CP}(B^+\\to J/\\psi \\pi^+)\n=(1.91\\pm0.89\\pm0.16)\\times10^{-2}. \\end{equation*}\n", "  The dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way are distributed in a so-called vast\npolar structure (VPOS) that may be in conflict with Lambda CDM simulations.\nHere, we seek to determine if the VPOS poses a serious challenge to the Lambda\ncold dark matter paradigm on galactic scales. Specifically, we investigate if\nthe VPOS remains coherent as a function of time. Using the measured Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) proper motions and associated uncertainties, we integrate\nthe orbits of the classical Milky Way satellites backwards in time and find\nthat the structure disperses well before a dynamical time. We also examine in\nparticular Leo I and Leo II using their most recent proper motion data, both of\nwhich have extreme kinematic properties, but these satellites do not appear to\ndrive the polar fit that is seen at the present day. We have studied the effect\nof the uncertainties on the HST proper motions on the coherence of the VPOS as\na function of time. We find that 8 of the 11 classical dwarfs have reliable\nproper motions; for these 8, the VPOS also loses significance in less than a\ndynamical time, indicating that the VPOS is not a dynamically stable structure.\nObtaining more accurate proper motion measurements of Ursa Minor, Sculptor, and\nCarina would bolster these conclusions.\n", "  A semi-analytic model for plasma-jet-driven magneto-inertial fusion is\npresented. Compressions of a magnetized plasma target by a spherically\nimploding plasma liner are calculated in one dimension (1D), accounting for\ncompressible hydrodynamics and ionization of the liner material, energy losses\ndue to conduction and radiation, fusion burn and alpha deposition, separate ion\nand electron temperatures in the target, magnetic pressure, and fuel burn-up.\nResults show 1D gains of 3-30 at spherical convergence ratio < 15 and 20-40 MJ\nof liner energy, for cases in which the liner thickness is 1 cm and the initial\nradius of a preheated magnetized target is 4 cm. Some exploration of parameter\nspace and physics settings is presented. The yields observed suggest that there\nis a possibility of igniting additional dense fuel layers to reach high gain.\n", "  Unconventional quantum critical phenomena observed in Yb-based periodic\ncrystals such as YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ and $\\beta$-YbAlB$_4$ have been one of the\ncentral issues in strongly correlated electron systems. The common criticality\nhas been discovered in quasicrystal Yb$_{15}$Au$_{51}$Al$_{34}$, which\nsurprisingly persists under pressure at least up to $P=1.5$ GPa. The $T/H$\nscaling where the magnetic susceptibility can be expressed as a single scaling\nfunction of the ratio of temperature $T$ and magnetic field $H$ has been\ndiscovered in the quasicrystal, which is essentially the same as that observed\nin $\\beta$-YbAlB$_4$. Recently, the $T/H$ scaling as well as the common\ncriticality has been also observed even in the approximant crystal\nYb$_{14}$Au$_{51}$Al$_{35}$ under pressure. The theory of critical Yb-valence\nfluctuation gives a natural explanation for these striking phenomena in a\nunified way.\n", "  A recently proposed covariant chiral effective field theory approach is\napplied to study strangeness $S=-1$ hyperon-nucleon interactions at leading\norder. 12 low energy constants are introduced by Lorentz invariance, which is\ndifferent from the heavy baryon approach, where only five appear. The\nKadyshevsky equation is employed to iterate the chiral potentials. A quite\nsatisfactory description of the 36 hyperon-nucleon scattering data is obtained\nwith $\\chi^2\\simeq 17$, which is comparable with the next-to-leading order\nheavy baryon approach. The results hint at a more efficient way to construct\nthe chiral potentials.\n", "  This paper analyzes pedestrians' behavioral patterns in the pedestrianized\nshopping environment in the historical center of Barcelona, Spain. We employ a\nBluetooth detection technique to capture a large-scale dataset of pedestrians'\nbehavior over a one-month period, including during a key sales period. We\nfocused on comparing particular behaviors before, during, and after the\ndiscount sales by analyzing this large-scale dataset, which is different but\ncomplementary to the conventionally used small-scale samples. Our results\nuncover pedestrians actively exploring a wider area of the district during a\ndiscount period compared to weekdays, giving rise to strong underlying mobility\npatterns.\n", "  We describe a complete list of Casimirs for 2D Euler hydrodynamics on a\nsurface without boundary: we define generalized enstrophies which, along with\ncirculations, form a complete set of invariants for coadjoint orbits of\narea-preserving diffeomorphisms on a surface. We also outline a possible\nextension of main notions to the boundary case and formulate several open\nquestions in that setting.\n", "  In this work we study the critical behavior of a three-state opinion model in\nthe presence of noise. This noise represents the independent behavior, that\nplays the role of social temperature. Each agent on a regular D-dimensional\nlattice has a probability $q$ to act as independent, i.e., he can choose his\nopinion independent of the opinions of his neighbors. Furthermore, with the\ncomplementary probability $1-q$ the agent interacts with a randomly chosen\nnearest neighbor through a kinetic exchange. Our numerical results suggest that\nthe model undergoes nonequilibrium phase transitions at critical points $q_{c}$\nthat depend on the lattice dimension. These transitions are of order-disorder\ntype, presenting the same critical exponents of the Ising model. The results\nalso suggest that the upper critical dimension of the model is $D_{c}=4$, as\nfor the Ising model. From the social point of view, with increasing number of\nsocial connections, it is easier to observe a majority opinion in the\npopulation.\n", "  In this work, the magneto-resistance (MR) of ultra-thin WTe2/BN\nheterostructures far away from electron-hole equilibrium is measured. The\nchange of MR of such devices is found to be determined largely by a single\ntunable parameter, i.e. the amount of imbalance between electrons and holes. We\nalso found that the magnetoresistive behavior of ultra-thin WTe2 devices is\nwell-captured by a two-fluid model. According to the model, the change of MR\ncould be as large as 400,000%, the largest potential change of MR among all\nmaterials known, if the ultra-thin samples are tuned to neutrality when\npreserving the mobility of 167,000 cm2V-1s-1 observed in bulk samples. Our\nfindings show the prospects of ultra-thin WTe2 as a variable magnetoresistance\nmaterial in future applications such as magnetic field sensors, information\nstorage and extraction devices, and galvanic isolators. The results also\nprovide important insight into the electronic structure and the origin of the\nlarge MR in ultra-thin WTe2 samples.\n", "  Hydro-meteorological variables, like precipitation, streamflow are\nsignificantly influenced by various climatic factors and large-scale\natmospheric circulation patterns. Efficient water resources management requires\nan understanding of the effects of climate indices on the accurate\npredictability of precipitation. This study aims at understanding the\nstandalone teleconnection between precipitation across India and the four\nclimate indices, namely, Ni\\~no 3.4, PDO, SOI, and IOD using partial wavelet\nanalysis. The analysis considers the cross correlation between the climate\nindices while estimating the relationship with precipitation. Previous studies\nhave overlooked the interdependence between these climate indices while\nanalysing their effect on precipitation. The results of the study reveal that\nprecipitation is only affected by Ni\\~no 3.4 and IOD and a non-stationary\nrelationship exists between precipitation and these two climate indices.\nFurther, partial wavelet analysis revealed that SOI and PDO do not\nsignificantly affect precipitation, but seems the other way because of their\ninterdependence on Ni\\~no 3.4. It was observed that partial wavelet analysis\nstrongly revealed the standalone relationship of climatic factors with\nprecipitation after eliminating other potential factors. Keywords: Indian\nPrecipitation, wavelet coherency, partial wavelet coherence, teleconnections\npatterns.\n", "  The hallmark of a skyrmion crystal (SkX) is the topological Hall effect\n(THE). In this Article, we predict and explain an unconventional behavior of\nthe topological Hall conductivity in SkXs. In simple terms, the spin texture of\nthe skyrmions causes an inhomogeneous emergent magnetic field whose associated\nLorentz force acts on the electrons. By making the emergent field homogeneous,\nthe THE is mapped onto the quantum Hall effect (QHE). Consequently, each\nelectronic band of the SkX is assigned to a Landau level. This correspondence\nof THE and QHE allows to explain the unconventional behavior of the THE of\nelectrons in SkXs. For example, a skyrmion crystal on a triangular lattice\nexhibits a quantized topological Hall conductivity with steps of $2 \\cdot\ne^2/h$ below and with steps of $1 \\cdot e^2/h$ above the van Hove singularity.\nOn top of this, the conductivity shows a prominent sign change at the van Hove\nsingularity. These unconventional features are deeply connected to the topology\nof the structural lattice.\n", "  We construct a piecewise model that gives a physical viable realization of\nfinite-time future singularity for a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nuniverse within the interacting dark matter--dark energy framework, with the\nlatter one in the form of a variable vacuum energy. The scale factor solutions\nprovided by the model are accommodated in several branches defined in four\nregions delimited by the scale factor and the effective energy density. A\nbranch starts from a big bang singularity and describes an expanding\nmatter-dominated universe until the sudden future singularity occurs. Then, an\nexpanding branch emerges from a past singularity, reaches a maximum, reverses\nits expansion and possibly collapses into itself while another expanding branch\nemerges from the latter singularity and has a stable de Sitter phase which is\nintrinsically stable. We obtain a different piecewise scale factor which\ndescribes a contracting de Sitter universe in the distant past until the\nfinite-time future singularity happens. It emerges and continues in a\ncontracting phase, bounces at the minimum, reverses, and enters into a stable\nde Sitter phase without a dramatic final. Also, we explore the aforesaid cosmic\nscenarios by focusing on the leading contributions of some physical quantities\nnear the sudden future singularity and applying the geometric Tipler and\nKr\\'olak criteria in order to inspect the behavior of timelike geodesic curves\naround such singularity.\n", "  We suggest an extension of the Hilbert Phase Space formalism, which appears\nto be naturally suited for application to the dissipative (open) quantum\nsystems, such as those described by the non-stationary (time-dependent)\nHamiltonians $H(x,p,t)$. A notion of quantum differential is introduced,\nhighlighting the difference between the quantum and classical propagators. The\nequation of quantum dynamics of the generalised Wigner function in the extended\nHilbert phase space is derived, as well as its classical limit, which serves as\nthe generalisation of the classical Liouville equation for the domain of\nnon-stationary Hamiltonian dynamical systems. This classical limit is then\nstudied at some length and it is shown that in the extended phase space the\nenergy plays the role of the coordinate and time that of the conjugated\nmomentum and not the other way around, as might be suggested by the covariant\ntreatment of these quantities arising from the 4-coordinate and 4-momentum in\nthe relativistic context. Furthermore, the canonical form of the equation\nobtained suggests that that which is perceived as motion in the ordinary phase\nspace is an equilibrium configuration in the extended phase space.\n", "  We report compressive mechanical response of graphene foams (GFs) and the\nthermal resistance ($R_{TIM}$) between copper (Cu) and GFs, where GFs were\nprepared by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. We observe that Young's\nmodulus ($E_{GF}$) and compressive strength ($\\sigma_{GF}$) of GFs have a power\nlaw dependence on increasing density ($\\rho_{GF}$) of GFs. The maximum\nefficiency of absorbed energy ($\\eta_{max}$) for all GFs during the compression\nis larger than ~0.39. We also find that a GF with a higher $\\rho_{GF}$ shows a\nlarger $\\eta_{max}$. In addition, we observe that the measured $R_{TIM}$ of\nCu/GFs at room temperature with a contact pressure of 0.25 MP applied increases\nfrom ~50 to ~90 $mm^2K/W$ when $\\rho_{GF}$ increases from 4.7 to 31.9\n$mg/cm^3$.\n", "  We study more deeply the sensitivity of the $ZH$ production process in\ngluon-gluon collisions to the details of a possible Higgs and top quark\ncompositeness. We establish a relation between Higgs and top quark form factors\nwhich would keep the basic cancellation appearing in SM and satisfy the concept\nof CSM. We give illustrations showing the spectacular consequences of various\nchoices preserving or violating this CSM constraint.\n", "  Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are equipped with sensitive\nphotomultiplier tube (PMT) cameras. Exposure to high levels of background\nillumination degrades the efficiency of and potentially destroys these\nphoto-detectors over time, so IACTs cannot be operated in the same\nconfiguration in the presence of bright moonlight as under dark skies. Since\nSeptember 2012, observations have been carried out with the VERITAS IACTs under\nbright moonlight (defined as about three times the night-sky-background (NSB)\nof a dark extragalactic field, typically occurring when Moon illumination >\n35%) in two observing modes, firstly by reducing the voltage applied to the\nPMTs and, secondly, with the addition of ultra-violet (UV) bandpass filters to\nthe cameras. This has allowed observations at up to about 30 times previous NSB\nlevels (around 80% Moon illumination), resulting in 30% more observing time\nbetween the two modes over the course of a year. These additional observations\nhave already allowed for the detection of a flare from the 1ES 1727+502 and for\nan observing program targeting a measurement of the cosmic-ray positron\nfraction. We provide details of these new observing modes and their performance\nrelative to the standard VERITAS observations.\n", "  Transfer matrix method is a well-known and extensively used tool to compute\nthe reflection and transmission coefficients of electromagnetic waves when\ninteracting with a system of layers parallel to each other. We present here a\nmodified form of transfer matrix method including the effects of any possible\nkinetic movements of layers with respect to each other with a constant\nvelocity. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effect of velocity on the\nphase and amplitude of the reflection coefficient as a function of velocity.\nAdditionally, to mimic the flow of liquids on top of layers we also present the\neffect of velocity gradients in the direction normal to the planar layers.\n", "  This paper introduces a new spreadsheet tool for adoption by high school or\ncollege level physics teachers who use common assessments in a\npre-instruction/post-instruction mode to diagnose student learning and teaching\neffectiveness. The spreadsheet creates a simple matrix that identifies the\npercentage of students who select each possible pre-/post-test answer\ncombination on each question of the diagnostic exam. Leveraging analysis of the\nquality of the incorrect answer choices, one can order the answer choices from\nworst to best (i.e., correct), resulting in \"transition matrices\" that can\nprovide deeper insight into student learning and the success or failure of the\npedagogical approach than traditional analyses that employ dichotomous scoring.\n", "  The prompt photon production in hadronic collisions has a long history of\nproviding information on the substructure of hadrons and testing the\nperturbative techniques of QCD. Some valuable information about the parton\ndensities in the nucleon and nuclei, especially of the gluon, can also be\nachieved by analysing the measurements of the prompt photon production cross\nsection whether inclusively or in association with heavy quarks or jets. In\nthis work, we present predictions for the inclusive isolated prompt photon\nproduction in $ pp $ collisions at center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV using\nvarious modern PDF sets. The calculations are presented both as a function of\nphoton transverse energy $ E_\\textrm{T}^\\gamma $ and pseudorapidity $\n\\eta^\\gamma $ for the ATLAS kinematic coverage. We also study in detail the\ntheoretical uncertainty in the cross sections due to the variation of the\nrenormalization, factorization and fragmentation scales. Moreover, we introduce\nand calculate the ratios of photon momenta for different rapidity regions and\nstudy the impact of various input PDFs on such quantity.\n", "  We perform the gauge covariant quantization of the exponential model of\nnonlinear electrodynamics. Magnetically charged black holes, in the framework\nof our model are considered, and the regular black hole solution is obtained in\ngeneral relativity. The asymptotic black hole solution at $r\\rightarrow \\infty$\nis found. We calculate the magnetic mass of the black hole and the metric\nfunction which are expressed via the parameter $\\beta$ of the model and the\nmagnetic charge. The thermodynamic properties and thermal stability of regular\nblack holes are analysed. We calculate the Hawking temperature of black holes\nand their heat capacity at the constant magnetic charge. We find a point where\nthe temperature changes the sign that corresponds to the first-order phase\ntransition. It is shown that at critical point, where the heat capacity\ndiverges, there is a phase transition of the second-order. We obtain the\nparameters of the model when the black hole is stable.\n", "  The hypernucleus production reaction $\\bar p + {}^AZ \\to {}^A_\\Lambda(Z-1) +\n\\bar{\\Lambda}$ in the beam momentum range 1.5-20 GeV/c is addressed\ntheoretically as a coherent process. The calculations are based on a covariant\n$t$-channel meson exchange model for the elementary $\\bar p p \\to \\bar\\Lambda\n\\Lambda$ annihilation amplitude with parameters fixed by comparison with\nempirical data. Besides pseudo-scalar $K$ and vector $K^*$ mesons we also\naccount for correlated $\\pi K$ contributions, modelled by the scalar\n$K^*_0(800)$ or $\\kappa$ meson. Initial and final state nuclear interactions\nare taken into account in eikonal approximation. The bound baryon wave\nfunctions are obtained self-consistently in a covariant mean-field approach. It\nis shown that the hypernucleus production cross sections populating discrete\nstates are dominated by the vector and scalar interaction channels. The\npronounced sensitivity on the scalar $\\kappa$ meson exchange contributions\nindicates that these reactions are well suited as a probe for correlated $\\pi\nK$ exchange in the scalar $\\kappa/K^*_0$ interaction channel.\n", "  I argue that some important elements of the current cosmological model are\n\"conventionalist\" in the sense defined by Karl Popper. These elements include\ndark matter and dark energy; both are auxiliary hypotheses that were invoked in\nresponse to observations that falsified the standard model as it existed at the\ntime. The use of conventionalist stratagems in response to unexpected\nobservations implies that the field of cosmology is in a state of \"degenerating\nproblemshift\" in the language of Imre Lakatos. I show that the \"concordance\"\nargument, often put forward by cosmologists in support of the current paradigm,\nis weaker than the convergence arguments that were made in the past in support\nof the atomic theory of matter or the quantization of energy.\n", "  We give a survey of our joint ongoing work with Ali Chamseddine, Slava\nMukhanov and Walter van Suijlekom. We show how a problem purely motivated by\n\"how geometry emerges from the quantum formalism\" gives rise to a slightly\nnoncommutative structure and a spectral model of gravity coupled with matter\nwhich fits with experimental knowledge.

Collection Mathematical Physics, Springer\n2017\n", "  In this article, we designed and synthesized a novel small molecule acceptor\nof ITCPTC with thiophene-fused ending group by employing a new active methylene\nprecursor of CPTCN. The ITCPTC based polymer solar cells with PBT1-EH as donor\nachieved very high PCEs of up to 11.8% with a remarkably enhanced fill factor\n(FF) of 0.751, a near 20% boost in PCE with respect to the ITIC based control\ndevice. These values are among the highest PCEs and FFs for PSCs. In the whole\nstudy, we made contrasts with ITIC to understand the reasons of excellent\nperformance of ITCPTC-based PSCs through various measurements, such as GIWAXS\nand RSoXS. We revealed that the simple modification of ITIC into ITCPTC not\nonly change the material electronic structure, but also mediate the material\ninteractions and crystallization, which contribute together to the excellent\nperformance of ITCPTC based PSCs.\n", "  Unique among alkali-doped $\\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ fullerene compounds, the\nA15 and fcc forms of Cs$_3$C$_{60}$ exhibit superconducting states varying\nunder hydrostatic pressure with highest transition temperatures at $T_\\textrm\n{C}$$^\\textrm {meas}$ = 38.3 and 35.2 K, respectively. Herein it is argued that\nthese two compounds under pressure represent the optimal materials of the\n$\\textit {A}$$_3$C$_{60}$ family, and that the C$_{60}$-associated\nsuperconductivity is mediated through Coulombic interactions with charges on\nthe alkalis. A derivation of the interlayer Coulombic pairing model of\nhigh-$T_\\textrm {C}$ superconductivity employing non-planar geometry is\nintroduced, generalizing the picture of two interacting layers to an\ninteraction between charge reservoirs located on the C$_{60}$ and alkali ions.\nThe optimal transition temperature follows the algebraic expression, $T_\\textrm\n{C0}$ = (12.474 nm$^2$ K)/$\\ell$${\\zeta}$, where $\\ell$ relates to the mean\nspacing between interacting surface charges on the C$_{60}$ and ${\\zeta}$ is\nthe average radial distance between the C$_{60}$ surface and the neighboring Cs\nions. Values of $T_\\textrm {C0}$ for the measured cation stoichiometries of\nCs$_{3-\\textrm{x}}$C$_{60}$ with x $\\approx$ 0 are found to be 38.19 and 36.88\nK for the A15 and fcc forms, respectively, with the dichotomy in transition\ntemperature reflecting the larger ${\\zeta}$ and structural disorder in the fcc\nform. In the A15 form, modeled interacting charges and Coulomb potential\ne$^2$/${\\zeta}$ are shown to agree quantitatively with findings from\nnuclear-spin relaxation and mid-infrared optical conductivity. In the fcc form,\nsuppression of $T_\\textrm {C}$$^\\textrm {meas}$ below $T_\\textrm {C0}$ is\nascribed to native structural disorder. Phononic effects in conjunction with\nCoulombic pairing are discussed.\n", "  Spin waves are propagating disturbances in magnetically ordered materials,\nanalogous to lattice waves in solid systems and are often described from a\nquasiparticle point of view as magnons. The attractive advantages of\nJoule-heat-free transmission of information, utilization of the phase of the\nwave as an additional degree of freedom and lower footprint area compared to\nconventional charge-based devices have made spin waves or magnon spintronics a\npromising candidate for beyond-CMOS wave-based computation. However, any\npractical realization of an all-magnon based computing system must undergo the\nessential steps of a careful selection of materials and demonstrate robustness\nwith respect to thermal noise or variability. Here, we aim at identifying\nsuitable materials and theoretically demonstrate the possibility of achieving\nerror-free clocked non-volatile spin wave logic device, even in the presence of\nthermal noise and clock jitter or clock skew.\n", "  We describe the first ever implementation of an emulsion multi-stage shifter\nin an accelerator neutrino experiment. The system was installed in the neutrino\nmonitor building in J-PARC as a part of a test experiment T60 and stable\noperation was maintained for a total of 126.6 days. By applying time\ninformation to emulsion films, various results were obtained. Time resolutions\nof 5.3 to 14.7 s were evaluated in an operation spanning 46.9 days (time\nresolved numbers of 3.8--1.4$\\times10^{5}$). By using timing and spatial\ninformation, a reconstruction of coincident events that consisted of high\nmultiplicity events and vertex events, including neutrino events was performed.\nEmulsion events were matched to events observed by INGRID, one of near\ndetectors of the T2K experiment, with high reliability (98.5\\%) and hybrid\nanalysis was established via use of the multi-stage shifter. The results\ndemonstrate that the multi-stage shifter is feasible for use in neutrino\nexperiments.\n", "  The recent detection of gas-phase methanol (CH$_3$OH) lines in the disc of TW\nHya by Walsh et al. provided the first observational constraints on the complex\nO-bearing organic content in protoplanetary discs. The emission has a ring-like\nmorphology, with a peak at $\\sim 30-50$ au and an inferred column density of\n$\\sim 3-6\\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. A low CH$_3$OH fractional abundance of $\\sim\n0.3-4\\times 10^{-11}$ (with respect to H$_2$) is derived, depending on the\nassumed vertical location of the CH$_3$OH molecular layer. In this study, we\nuse a thermo-chemical model of the TW Hya disc, coupled with the ALCHEMIC\ngas-grain chemical model, assuming laboratory-motivated, fast diffusivities of\nthe surface molecules to interpret the CH$_3$OH detection. Based on this disc\nmodel, we performed radiative transfer calculations with the LIME code and\nsimulations of the observations with the CASA simulator. We found that our\nmodel allows to reproduce the observations well. The CH$_3$OH emission in our\nmodel appears as a ring with radius of $\\sim60$ au. Synthetic and observed line\nflux densities are equal within the rms noise level of observations. The\nsynthetic CH$_3$OH spectra calculated assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium\n(LTE) can differ by up to a factor of 3.5 from the non-LTE spectra. For the\nstrongest lines, the differences between LTE and non-LTE flux densities are\nvery small and practically negligible. Variations in the diffusivity of the\nsurface molecules can lead to variations of the CH$_3$OH abundance and,\ntherefore, line flux densities by an order of magnitude.\n", "  The application and analysis of the Cut-and-Choose technique in protocols\nsecure against quantum adversaries is not a straightforward transposition of\nthe classical case, among other reasons due to the difficulty to use rewinding\nin the quantum realm. We introduce a Quantum Computation Cut-and-Choose (QC-CC)\ntechnique which is a generalisation of the classical Cut-and-Choose in order to\nbuild quantum protocols secure against quantum covert adversaries. Such\nadversaries can deviate arbitrarily provided that their deviation is not\ndetected. As an application of the QC-CC we give a protocol for securely\nperforming two-party quantum computation with classical input/output. As basis\nwe use secure delegated quantum computing (Broadbent et al 2009), and in\nparticular the garbled quantum computation of (Kashefi et al 2016) that is\nsecure against only a weak specious adversaries, defined in (Dupuis et al\n2010). A unique property of these protocols is the separation between classical\nand quantum communications and the asymmetry between client and server, which\nenables us to sidestep the quantum rewinding issues. This opens the prospect of\nusing the QC-CC to other quantum protocols with this separation. In our proof\nof security we adapt and use (at different parts) two quantum rewinding\ntechniques, namely Watrous' oblivious q-rewinding (Watrous 2009) and Unruh's\nspecial q-rewinding (Unruh 2012). Our protocol achieves the same functionality\nas in previous works (e.g. Dupuis et al 2012), however using the QC-CC\ntechnique on the protocol from (Kashefi et al 2016) leads to the following key\nimprovements: (i) only one-way offline quantum communication is necessary ,\n(ii) only one party (server) needs to have involved quantum technological\nabilities, (iii) only minimal extra cryptographic primitives are required,\nnamely one oblivious transfer for each input bit and quantum-safe commitments.\n", "  The Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) scenario provides a solution for\nforming the massive black holes powering bright quasars observed in the early\nUniverse. A prerequisite for forming a DCBH is that the formation of (much less\nmassive) Population III stars be avoided - this can be achieved by destroying\nH$_2$ via Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation (E$_{\\rm{LW}}$ = 12.6 eV). We find that\ntwo conditions must be met in the proto-galaxy that will host the DCBH. First,\nprior star formation must be delayed; this can be achieved with a background LW\nflux of J$_{\\rm BG} \\gtrsim 100\\ J_{21}$. Second, an intense burst of LW\nradiation from a neighbouring star-bursting proto-galaxy is required, just\nbefore the gas cloud undergoes gravitational collapse, to finally suppress star\nformation completely. We show here for the first time using high-resolution\nhydrodynamical simulations, including full radiative transfer, that this\nlow-level background, combined with tight synchronisation and irradiation of a\nsecondary proto-galaxy by a primary proto-galaxy, inevitably moves the\nsecondary proto-galaxy onto the isothermal atomic cooling track, without the\ndeleterious effects of either photo-evaporating the gas or polluting it by\nheavy elements. These, atomically cooled, massive proto-galaxies are expected\nto ultimately form a DCBH of mass $10^4 - 10^5 M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We recently reported measurements of spin polarization in W and Pt thin films\nproduced by the spin Hall effect (SHE) using a magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE)\nsystem based on crossed polarizers that detects changes in light intensity.\nRiego et al used a generalized magneto-optical ellipsometry system that in\nprinciple can distinguish pure optical reflectivity from magneto-optic signals,\nbut were unable to detect SHE polarization in their nominally W, Ta and Pt\nfilms. They argued that our results are spurious and likely due to resistive\nheating which temporally modulates the film temperature and reflectivity, and\nthat any SHE polarization is too small to be detected in metal films. In this\ncomment, we argue that our original results are correct as presented, and\ndiscuss why\n", "  We introduce and study the inhomogeneous exponential jump model - an\nintegrable stochastic interacting particle system on the continuous half line\nevolving in continuous time. An important feature of the system is the presence\nof arbitrary spatial inhomogeneity on the half line which does not break the\nintegrability. We completely characterize the macroscopic limit shape and\nasymptotic fluctuations of the height function (= integrated current) in the\nmodel. In particular, we explain how the presence of inhomogeneity may lead to\nmacroscopic phase transitions in the limit shape such as shocks or traffic\njams. Away from these singularities the asymptotic fluctuations of the height\nfunction around its macroscopic limit shape are governed by the GUE Tracy-Widom\ndistribution. A surprising result is that while the limit shape is\ndiscontinuous at a traffic jam caused by a macroscopic slowdown in the\ninhomogeneity, fluctuations on both sides of such a traffic jam still have the\nGUE Tracy-Widom distribution (but with different non-universal normalizations).\n  The integrability of the model comes from the fact that it is a degeneration\nof the inhomogeneous stochastic higher spin six vertex models studied earlier\nin arXiv:1601.05770 [math.PR]. Our results on fluctuations are obtained via an\nasymptotic analysis of Fredholm determinantal formulas arising from contour\nintegral expressions for the q-moments in the stochastic higher spin six vertex\nmodel. We also discuss \"product-form\" translation invariant stationary\ndistributions of the exponential jump model which lead to an alternative\nhydrodynamic-type heuristic derivation of the macroscopic limit shape.\n", "  Purpose: Implanted fiducial markers are often used in radiotherapy to\nfacilitate accurate visualization and localization of tumors. Typically, such\nmarkers are used to aid daily patient positioning and to verify the target's\nposition during treatment. This work introduces a novel, automated method for\nidentifying fiducial markers in planar x-ray imaging.\n  Methods: In brief, the method consists of automated filtration and\nreconstruction steps that generate 3D templates of marker positions. The\nnormalized cross-correlation was the used to identify fiducial markers in\nprojection images. To quantify the accuracy of the technique, a phantom study\nwas performed. 75 pre-treatment CBCT scans of 15 pancreatic cancer patients\nwere analyzed to test the automated technique under real life conditions,\nincluding several challenging scenarios for tracking fiducial markers.\n  Results: In phantom and patient studies, the method automatically tracked\nvisible marker clusters in 100% of projection images. For scans in which a\nphantom exhibited 0D, 1D, and 3D motion, the automated technique showed median\nerrors of 39 $\\mu$m, 53 $\\mu$m, and 93 $\\mu$m, respectively. Human precision\nwas worse in comparison. Automated tracking was performed accurately despite\nthe presence of other metallic objects. Additionally, transient differences in\nthe cross-correlation score identified instances where markers disappeared from\nview.\n  Conclusions: A novel, automated method for producing dynamic templates of\nfiducial marker clusters has been developed. Production of these templates\nautomatically provides measurements of tumor motion that occurred during the\nCBCT scan that was used to produce them. Additionally, using these templates\nwith intra-fractional images could potentially allow for more robust real-time\ntarget tracking in radiotherapy.\n", "  Whistler-mode waves are generated within and can propagate upstream of\ncollisionless shocks. They are known to play a role in electron\nthermodynamics/acceleration and, under certain conditions, are markedly\nobserved as wave trains preceding the shock ramp. In this paper, we take\nadvantage of Cassini's presence at ~10 AU to explore the importance of\nwhistler-mode waves in a parameter regime typically characterized by higher\nMach number (median of ~14) shocks, as well as a significantly different IMF\nstructure, compared to near Earth. We identify electromagnetic precursors\npreceding a small subset of bow shock crossings with properties which are\nconsistent with whistler-mode waves. We find these monochromatic,\nlow-frequency, circularly-polarized waves to have a typical frequency range of\n0.2 - 0.4 Hz in the spacecraft frame. This is due to the lower ion and electron\ncyclotron frequencies near Saturn, between which whistler waves can develop.\nThe waves are also observed as predominantly right-handed in the spacecraft\nframe, the opposite sense to what is typically observed near Earth. This is\nattributed to the weaker Doppler shift, owing to the large angle between the\nsolar wind velocity and magnetic field vectors at 10 AU. Our results on the low\noccurrence of whistler waves upstream of Saturn also underpins the\npredominantly supercritical bow shock of Saturn.\n", "  One of the most puzzling features of high-temperature cuprate superconductors\nis the pseudogap state, which appears above the temperature at which\nsuperconductivity is destroyed. There remain fundamental questions regarding\nits nature and its relation to superconductivity. But to address these\nquestions, we must first determine whether the pseudogap and superconducting\nstates share a common property: particle-hole symmetry. We introduce a new\ntechnique to test particle-hole symmetry by using laser pulses to manipulate\nand measure the chemical potential on picosecond time scales. The results\nstrongly suggest that the asymmetry in the density of states is inverted in the\npseudogap state, implying a particle-hole asymmetric gap. Independent of\ninterpretation, these results can test theoretical predictions of the density\nof states in cuprates.\n", "  The Ryu-Takayanagi conjecture establishes a remarkable connection between\nquantum systems and geometry. Specifically, it relates the entanglement entropy\nto minimal surfaces within the setting of AdS/CFT correspondence. This Letter\nshows how this idea can be generalised to generic quantum many-body systems\nwithin a perturbative expansion where the region whose entanglement properties\none is interested in is weakly coupled to the rest of the system. A simple\nexpression is derived that relates a unitary disentangling flow in an emergent\nRG-like direction to the min-entropy of the region under consideration.\nExplicit calculations for critical free fermions in one and two dimensions\nillustrate this relation.\n", "  Bacterial motility, and in particular repulsion or attraction towards\nspecific chemicals, has been a subject of investigation for over 100 years,\nresulting in detailed understanding of bacterial chemotaxis and the\ncorresponding sensory network in many bacterial species. For Escherichia coli\nmost of the current understanding comes from the experiments with low levels of\nchemotactically-active ligands. However, chemotactically-inactive chemical\nspecies at concentrations found in the human gastrointestinal tract produce\nsignificant changes in E. coli's osmotic pressure, and have been shown to lead\nto taxis. To understand how these nonspecific physical signals influence\nmotility, we look at the response of individual bacterial flagellar motors\nunder step-wise changes in external osmolarity. We combine these measurements\nwith a population swimming assay under the same conditions. Unlike for\nchemotactic response, a long-term increase in swimming/motor speeds is\nobserved, and in the motor rotational bias, both of which scale with the\nosmotic shock magnitude. We discuss how the speed changes we observe can lead\nto steady state bacterial accumulation.\n", "  The transport characteristics across the pulsed laser deposited\nNi0.07Zn0.93O/Mg0.21Zn0.79O heterojunction exhibits p-n type semiconducting\nproperties at 10 K while at 100 K, its characteristics become similar to that\nof an n-n junction. The reason for the same is attributed to the role of larger\nelectronegativity of Ni as compared to Mg at 10 K and ionization of impurity\nstates at 100 K. The above behavior is confirmed by performing the Hall\nmeasurements.\n", "  We report the magnetoresistance and nonlinear Hall effect studies over a wide\ntemperature range in pulsed laser deposited Ni0.07Zn0.93O thin film. Negative\nand positive contributions to magnetoresistance at high and low temperatures\nhave been successfully modeled by the localized magnetic moment and two band\nconduction process involving heavy and light hole subbands, respectively.\nNonlinearity in the Hall resistance also agrees well with the two channel\nconduction model. A negative Hall voltage has been found for T $\\gte 50 K$,\nimplying a dominant conduction mainly by electrons whereas positive Hall\nvoltage for T less than 50 K shows hole dominated conduction in this material.\nCrossover in the sign of magnetoresistance from negative to positive reveals\nthe spin polarization of the charge carriers and hence the applicability of Ni\ndoped ZnO thin film for spintronic applications.\n", "  Although various norms for reciprocity-based cooperation have been suggested\nthat are evolutionarily stable against invasion from free riders, the process\nof alternation of norms and the role of diversified norms remain unclear in the\nevolution of cooperation. We clarify the co-evolutionary dynamics of norms and\ncooperation in indirect reciprocity and also identify the indispensable norms\nfor the evolution of cooperation. Inspired by the gene knockout method, a\ngenetic engineering technique, we developed the norm knockout method and\nclarified the norms necessary for the establishment of cooperation. The results\nof numerical investigations revealed that the majority of norms gradually\ntransitioned to tolerant norms after defectors are eliminated by strict norms.\nFurthermore, no cooperation emerges when specific norms that are intolerant to\ndefectors are knocked out.\n", "  One of the major goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to probe the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and the generation of the masses of the\nelementary particles. We review the physics of the Higgs sector in the Standard\nModel. The main production channels of the Higgs production at the LHC are\nreviewed. The prospects for the discovering the Higgs particles at the LHC and\nthe study of their fundamental properties are summarizes.\n", "  It is well known that, in the context of General Relativity, some spacetimes,\nwhen described by a congruence of comoving observers, may consist in a\ndistribution of a perfect (non-dissipative) fluid, whereas the same spacetime\nas seen by a \"tilted\"' (Lorentz-boosted) congruence of observers, may exhibit\nthe presence of dissipative processes. As we shall see, the appearence of\nentropy producing processes are related to the tight dependence of entropy on\nthe specific congruence of observers. This fact is well illustrated by the\nGibbs paradox. The appearance of such dissipative processes, as required by the\nLandauer principle, are necessary, in order to erase the different amount of\ninformation stored by comoving observers, with respect to tilted ones.\n", "  We present an estimation of the strong coupling constant alphas(MZ) using,\nfor the first time, the production of prompt photon process in proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC. ATLAS measurements of the inclusive isolated prompt\nphoton cross section at 7 TeV are exploited. Both theoretical and experimental\nuncertainties are estimated and the strong coupling constant has been\ndetermined to be alphas(MZ)= 0.1183 +- 0.0038, to NLO accuracy.\n", "  Elements of group I in the Periodic table have valence electrons of s-type\nand are usually considered as simple metals. Crystal structures of these\nelements at ambient pressure are close-packed and high-symmetry of bcc and fcc\ntypes, defined by electrostatic (Madelung) energy. Diverse structures were\nfound under high pressure with decrease of the coordination number, packing\nfraction and symmetry. Formation of complex structures can be understood within\nthe model of Fermi sphere - Brillouin zone interactions and supported by\nHume-Rothery arguments. With the volume decrease there is a gain in the band\nstructure energy accompanied by a formation of many-faced Brillouin zone\npolyhedrons. Under compression to less than a half of the initial volume the\ninteratomic distances become close to or smaller than the ionic radius which\nshould lead to the electron core ionization. At strong compression it is\nnecessary to assume that for alkali metals the valence electron band overlaps\nwith the upper core electrons which increases the valence electron count under\ncompression.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically study the influence of a non-magnetic spacer\nbetween ferromagnetic dots and ferromagnetic matrix on the frequency dispersion\nof the spin wave excitations in two-dimensional bi-component magnonic crystals.\nBy means of the dynamical matrix method we investigate structures inhomogeneous\nacross the thickness represented by square arrays of Cobalt or Permalloy dots\nin a Permalloy matrix. We show that the introduction of a non-magnetic spacer\nsignificantly modifies the total internal magnetic field especially at the\nedges of the grooves and dots. This permits the manipulation of the magnonic\nband structure of spin waves localized either at the edges of the dots or in\nmatrix material at the edges of grooves. According to the micromagnetic\nsimulations two types of end modes were found. The corresponding frequencies\nare significantly influenced by the end modes localization region. We also show\nthat, with the use of a single ferromagnetic material, it is possible to design\na magnonic crystal preserving properties of bi-component magnonic crystals and\nmagnonic antidot lattices. Finally, the influence of the non-magnetic spacers\non the technologically relevant parameters like group velocity and magnonic\nband width are discussed.\n", "  Recent measurements of the conductivity of nanoperforated graphene are\ninterpreted in terms of edges states existing near the edge of each nanohole.\nThe perimetric quantization of edge states should result in the formation of a\nquasi-equidistant ladder of quasistationary energy levels. Dirac fermions\nfilling this ladder rotate about each nanohole in the direction determined by\nthe valley index. It is shown that the irradiation of this system by circularly\npolarized terahertz radiation leads to a resonance in absorption in one of the\nvalleys. The magnitude of absorption at the resonance frequency can be\ncontrolled by means of gate voltage.\n", "  In this work, the time evolution of the free induction decay caused by the\nlocal dipole field of a spherical magnetic perturber is analyzed. The\ncomplicated treatment of the diffusion process is considered by the\nstrong-collision approximation that allows a determination of the free\ninduction decay in dependence of the underlying microscopic tissue parameters\nsuch as diffusion coefficient, sphere radius and susceptibility difference. The\ninterplay between susceptibility- and diffusion-mediated effects yields several\ndephasing regimes of which, so far, only the classical regimes of motional\nnarrowing and static dephasing for dominant and negligible diffusion,\nrespectively, were extensively examined. Due to the asymmetric form of the\nthree-dimensional dipole field for spherical objects, the free induction decay\nexhibits a complex component in contradiction to the cylindrical case, where\nthe symmetric local two-dimensional dipole field only causes a purely real\ninduction decay. Knowledge of the shape of the corresponding frequency\ndistribution is necessary for the evaluation of more sophisticated pulse\nsequences and a detailed understanding of the off-resonance distribution allows\nimproved quantification of transverse relaxation.\n", "  Using a Hartman-Hahn protocol, we demonstrate spin polarization transfer from\na single, optically-polarized nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center to the ensemble of\nparamagnetic defects hosted by an individual diamond nanocrystal. Owing to the\nstrong NV-bath coupling, the transfer takes place on a short, microsecond time\nscale. Upon fast repetition of the pulse sequence we observe strong\npolarization transfer blockade, which we interpret as an indication of spin\nbath cooling. Numerical simulations indicate that the spin bath polarization is\nnon-uniform throughout the nanoparticle averaging approximately 5% over the\ncrystal volume, but reaching up to 25% in the immediate vicinity of the NV.\nThese observations may prove relevant to the planning of future bath-assisted\nmagnetometry tests.\n", "  Zauner's conjecture asserts that $d^2$ equiangular lines exist in all $d$\ncomplex dimensions. In quantum theory, the $d^2$ lines are dubbed a SIC, as\nthey define a favoured standard informationally complete quantum measurement\ncalled a SIC-POVM. This note supplements A. J. Scott and M. Grassl [J. Math.\nPhys. 51 (2010), 042203] by extending the list of published numerical\nsolutions. We provide a putative complete list of Weyl-Heisenberg covariant\nSICs with the known symmetries in dimensions $d\\leq 90$, a single solution with\nZauner's symmetry for every $d\\leq 121$ and solutions with higher symmetry for\n$d=124,143,147,168,172,195,199,228,259$ and $323$.\n", "  The properties of dephasing and the resulting relaxation of the magnetization\nare the basic principle on which all magnetic resonance imaging methods are\nbased. The signal obtained from the gyrating spins is essentially determined by\nthe properties of the considered tissue. Especially the susceptibility\ndifferences caused by magnetized materials (for example, deoxygenated blood,\nBOLD-effect) or magnetic nanoparticles are becoming more important for\nbiomedical imaging. In the present work, the influence of such field\ninhomogeneities on the NMR-signal is analyzed.\n", "  We propose a systematic approach to the basis set extension for nonadiabatic\ndynamics of entangled combination of nuclear coherent states (CSs) evolving\naccording to the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). TDVP provides a\nrigorous framework for fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics of closed systems,\nhowever, quality of results strongly depends on available basis functions.\nStarting with a single nuclear CS replicated vertically on all electronic\nstates, our approach clones this function when replicas of the CS on different\nelectronic states experience increasingly different forces. Created clones move\naway from each other (decohere) extending the basis set. To determine a moment\nfor cloning we introduce generalized forces based on derivatives that maximally\ncontribute to a variation of the total quantum action and thus account for\nentanglement of all basis functions.\n", "  We have investigated the gate-voltage dependence and the temperature\ndependence of the magnetoconductivity of amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide\nthin-film transistors. A weak-localization feature is observed at small\nmagnetic fields on top of an overall negative magnetoconductivity at higher\nfields. An intriguing controllable competition between weak localization and\nweak antilocalization is observed by tuning the gate voltage or varying the\ntemperature. Our findings reflect controllable quantum interference competition\nin the electron systems in amorphous indium-gallium-zinc-oxide thin-film\ntransistors.\n", "  This article presents a brief overview of the interplay between nonlinearity\nand Anderson localization of light, primarily in the context of transverse\nAnderson localization. The focus is on whether Anderson localization is\npreserved, enhanced, weakened, or destroyed in the presence of nonlinearity.\nSeveral recent experimental and theoretical results are highlighted and\nreviewed.\n", "  We have investigated theoretically band structure of spin waves in magnonic\ncrystals with periodicity in one-(1D), two- (2D) and three-dimensions (3D). We\nhave solved Landau-Lifshitz equation with the use of plane wave method, finite\nelement method in frequency domain and micromagnetic simulations in time domain\nto find the dynamics of spin waves and spectrum of their eigenmodes. The spin\nwave spectra were calculated in linear approximation. In this paper we show\nusefulness of these methods in calculations of various types of spin waves. We\ndemonstrate the surface character of the Damon-Eshbach spin wave in 1D magnonic\ncrystals and change of its surface localization with the band number and\nwavenumber in the first Brillouin zone. The surface property of the spin wave\nexcitation is further exploited by covering plate of the magnonic crystal with\nconductor. The band structure in 2D magnonic crystals is complex due to\nadditional spatial inhomogeneity introduced by the demagnetizing field. This\nmodifies spin wave dispersion, makes the band structure of magnonic crystals\nstrongly dependent on shape of the inclusions and type of the lattice. The\ninhomogeneity of the internal magnetic field becomes unimportant for magnonic\ncrystals with small lattice constant, where exchange interactions dominate. For\n3D magnonic crystals, characterized by small lattice constant, wide magnonic\nband gap is found. We show that the spatial distribution of different materials\nin magnonic crystals can be explored for tailored effective damping of spin\nwaves.\n", "  We have investigated multifunctional periodic structures in which\nelectromagnetic waves and spin waves can be confined in the same areas. Such\nsimultaneous localization of both sorts of excitations can potentially enhance\nthe interaction between electromagnetic waves and spin waves. The system we\nconsidered has a form of one dimensional photonic-magnonic crystal with two\ntypes of magnetic layers (thicker and thinner ones) separated by sections of\nthe dielectric photonic crystals. We focused on the electromagnetic defect\nmodes localized in the magnetic layers (areas where spin waves can be exited)\nand decaying in the sections of conventional (nonmagnetic) photonic crystals.\nWe showed how the change of relative thickness of two types of the magnetic\nlayers can influence on the spectrum of spin waves and electromagnetic defect\nmodes, both localized in magnetic parts of the system.\n", "  We introduce a tomography approach to describe the optical response of a\ncavity quantum electrodynamics device, beyond the semiclassical image of\npolarization rotation, by analyzing the polarization density matrix of the\nreflected photons in the Poincar\\'e sphere. Applying this approach to an\nelectrically-controlled quantum dot-cavity device, we show that a single\nresonantly-excited quantum dot induces a large optical polarization rotation by\n$20^\\circ$ in latitude and longitude in the Poincar\\'e sphere, with a\npolarization purity remaining above $84\\%$. The quantum dot resonance\nfluorescence is shown to contribute to the polarization rotation via its\ncoherent part, whereas its incoherent part contributes to degrading the\npolarization purity.\n", "  Chimera states are characterized by the symmetry-breaking coexistence of\nsynchronized and incoherent groups of oscillators in certain chains of\nidentical oscillators. We report on the direct experimental observation of\nstates reminiscent of such chimeras within a ring of coupled electronic\n(Wien-bridge) oscillators, and compare these to numerical simulations of a\ntheoretically derived model. Following up on earlier work characterizing the\npairwise interaction of Wien-bridge oscillators by Kuramoto-Sakaguchi phase\ndynamics, we develop a lattice model for a chain thereof, featuring an {\\it\nexponentially decaying} spatial kernel. We find that for certain values of the\nSakaguchi parameter $\\alpha$, chimera-like states involving the coexistence of\ntwo clearly-separated regions of distinct dynamical behavior can establish\nthemselves in the ring lattice, characterized by both traveling and stationary\ncoexistence domains of synchronization.\n", "  Demonstrations, protests, riots, and shifts in public opinion respond to the\ncoordinating potential of communication networks. Digital technologies have\nturned interpersonal networks into massive, pervasive structures that\nconstantly pulsate with information. Here, we propose a model that aims to\nanalyze the contagion dynamics that emerge in networks when repeated activation\nis allowed, that is, when actors can engage recurrently in a collective effort.\nWe analyze how the structure of communication networks impacts on the ability\nto coordinate actors, and we identify the conditions under which large-scale\ncoordination is more likely to emerge.\n", "  The relation between the parameters of the microscopic structure of the\nmyocardium and the spin dephasing is analyzed. The microscopic structure of the\nmyocardium is described in terms of Krogh's capillary model. In this model the\nmyocardium is reduced to a single capillary which is surrounded by a concentric\ntissue cylinder. In the tissue cylinder the dephasing and diffusion process\noccurs. Mathematically the dephasing process is described by the\nBloch-Torrey-equation. Experimentally the Signal-time-decay was measured using\na PRESS-sequence and a gradient-echo-sequence. Using the methods provided in\nthis work, the relation between the capillary radius and the measured free\ninduction decay can be given.\n", "  A maximum superconductive transition temperature $T_\\textrm{C}$ = 203.5 K has\nrecently been reported for a sample of the binary compound tri-hydrogen sulfide\n(H$_\\textrm{3}$S) prepared at high pressure and with room temperature\nannealing. Measurements of $T_\\textrm{C}$ for H$_\\textrm{3}$S and its deuterium\ncounterpart D$_\\textrm{3}$S have suggested a mass isotope effect exponent\n${\\alpha}$ with anomalous enhancements for reduced applied pressures. While\nwidely cited for evidence of phonon-based superconductivity, the measured\n$T_\\textrm{C}$ is shown to exhibit important dependences on the quality and\ncharacter of the H$_\\textrm{3}$S and D$_\\textrm{3}$S materials under study;\nexamination of resistance versus temperature data shows that variations in\n$T_\\textrm{C}$ and apparent ${\\alpha}$ are strongly correlated with residual\nresistance ratio, indicative of sensitivity to metallic order. Correlations\nalso extend to the fractional widths of the superconducting transitions. Using\nresistance data to quantify and compensate for the evident materials\ndifferences between H$_\\textrm{3}$S and D$_\\textrm{3}$S samples, a value of\n${\\alpha}$ = 0.043 $\\pm$ 0.140 is obtained. Thus, when corrected for the\nvarying levels of disorder, the experimental upper limit ($\\leq$0.183) lies\nwell below ${\\alpha}$ derived in phonon-based theories.\n", "  Dielectric lined waveguides are under extensive study as accelerating\nstructures that can be excited by electron beams. Rectangular dielectric\nstructures are used both in proof of principle experiments for new accelerating\nschemes and for studying the electronic properties of the structure loading\nmaterial. Analysis of Cherenkov radiation generated by high current\nrelativistic electron bunch passing through a rectangular waveguide with\ntransversal isotropic dielectric loading has been carried out. Some of the\nmaterials used for the waveguide loading of accelerating structures (sapphire,\nceramic films) possess significant anisotropic properties. In turn, it can\ninfluence excitation parameters of the wakefields generated by an electron\nbeam. General solutions for the fields generated by a relativistic electron\nbeam propagating in a rectangular dielectric waveguide have been derived using\nthe orthogonal eigenmode decomposition method for the transverse operators of\nthe Helmholtz equation. The analytical expression for the combined Cherenkov\nand Coulomb fields in terms of a superposition of LSM and LSE-modes of\nrectangular waveguide with transversal isotropic dielectric loading has been\nobtained. Numerical modelling of the longitudinal and transverse (deflecting)\nwakefields has been carried out as well. It is shown that the dielectric\nanisotropy causes frequency shift in comparison to the dielectric-lined\nwaveguide with the isotropic dielectric loading.\n", "  Inspired by recent experiments using synthetic microswimmers to manipulate\ndroplets, we investigate the low-Reynolds-number locomotion of a model swimmer\n(a spherical squirmer) encapsulated inside a droplet of comparable size in\nanother viscous fluid. Meditated solely by hydrodynamic interactions, the\nencaged swimmer is seen to be able to propel the droplet, and in some\nsituations both remain in a stable co-swimming state. The problem is tackled\nusing both an exact analytical theory and a numerical implementation based on\nboundary element method, with a particular focus on the kinematics of the\nco-moving swimmer and droplet in a concentric configuration, and we obtain\nexcellent quantitative agreement between the two. The droplet always moves\nslower than a swimmer which uses purely tangential surface actuation but when\nit uses a particular combination of tangential and normal actuations, the\nsquirmer and droplet are able to attain a same velocity and stay concentric for\nall times. We next employ numerical simulations to examine the stability of\ntheir concentric co-movement, and highlight several stability scenarios\ndepending on the particular gait adopted by the swimmer. Furthermore, we show\nthat the droplet reverses the nature of the far-field flow induced by the\nswimmer: a droplet cage turns a pusher swimmer into a puller, and vice versa.\nOur work sheds light on the potential development of droplets as self-contained\ncarriers of both chemical content and self-propelled devices for controllable\nand precise drug deliveries.\n", "  Resorting to the characteristic polynomial of Lax matrix for the Dym-type\nhierarchy, we define a trigonal curve, on which appropriate vector-valued\nBaker-Akhiezer function and meromorphic function are introduced. Based on the\ntheory of trigonal curve and three kinds of Abelian differentials, we obtain\nthe explicit Riemann theta function representations of the meromorphic\nfunction, from which we get the algebro-geometric constructions for the entire\nDym-type hierarchy\n", "  The coupled evolution of an eroding cylinder immersed in a fluid within the\nsubcritical Reynolds range is explored with scale resolving simulations.\nErosion of the cylinder is driven by fluid shear stress. K\\'arm\\'an vortex\nshedding features in the wake and these oscillations occur on a significantly\nsmaller time scale compared to the slowly eroding cylinder boundary. Temporal\nand spatial averaging across the cylinder span allows mean wall statistics such\nas wall shear to be evaluated; with geometry evolving in 2-D and the flow field\nsimulated in 3-D. The cylinder develops into a rounded triangular body with\nuniform wall shear stress which is in agreement with existing theory and\nexperiments. We introduce a node shuffle algorithm to reposition nodes around\nthe cylinder boundary with a uniform distribution such that the mesh quality is\npreserved under high boundary deformation. A cylinder is then modelled within\nan infinite array of other cylinders by simulating a repeating unit cell and\ntheir profile evolution is studied. A similar terminal form is discovered for\nlarge cylinder spacings with consistent flow conditions and an intermediate\nprofile was found with a closely packed lattice before reaching the common\nterminal form.\n", "  Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are gaining considerable interest as\nalternatives to the semiconductor-based thin film solar cells. The noble metal\nplatinum (Pt) is conventionally used as counter electrode (CE) material for\nfabricating DSSCs. Since Pt is expensive and scarce, new materials have been\nexplored to develop cost-effective Pt-free counter electrodes for DSSCs.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) graphene-based counter electrodes have achieved the\nhighest known power conversion efficiency ({\\eta}) of 13%, which has stimulated\nresearch activities in 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for\ndeveloping Pt-free DSSCs. In this review, progress made on alternative counter\nelectrodes for fabricating low-cost Pt-free DSSCs, based on earth-abundant 2D\nTMDs including MoS2, WS2, TiS2, FeS2, CoS2, NiS2, SnS2, MoSe2, NbSe2, TaSe2,\nNiSe2, FeSe2, CoSe2, Bi2Se3 and their based composites, are discussed and\nsummarized. Also, the considerable progress made on thin films of MoS2 and MoS2\nbased carbon, graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and\npoly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) composites\nas efficient counter electrodes (CEs) for DSSCs are discussed, in terms of\ntheir electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. At present, PCE values\nhigher than that of standard Pt CE have been recorded for a number of TMD-based\nCEs, which include MoS2 and MoSe2/thin films deposited on Mo foil, MoS2/CNTs,\nMoS2/graphene, MoS2/carbon, MoSe2/PEDOT:PSS, NbSe2, FeS2, FeSe2 nanosheets,\nTiS2/graphene, and NiS2/graphene hybrid systems in DSSCs, for the reduction of\ntriiodide (I3-) to iodide (I-). The highest PCE ({\\eta}=10.46%) versus Pt CE\n({\\eta}=8.25%) at 1 Sun (100 mW/cm2, AM 1.5G) was measured for DSSCs having a\nlow cost and flexible CoSe2/carbon-nanoclimbing wall counter electrode\ndeposited on a nickel foam.\n", "  The origin and calibration of the maximum absolute magnitude relation with\ndecline time (MMRD) for novae, first derived by Zwicky (1936) empirically\nvalidated by McLaughlin (1940) and widely used to estimate distances to\nclassical novae and the near-constancy of the absolute magnitude of novae, 15\ndays after optical maximum, suggested by Buscombe and de Vaucouleurs (1955) are\nrevisited in this paper and found to be valid. The main results presented in\nthe paper are: (1) A physical derivation of the MMRD based on instantaneous\ninjection of energy to the nova system. (2) A significantly better-constrained\nMMRD: M_{V,0} = 2.16(+-0.16)log_{10}t_2 - 10.804(+-0.117) using a two step\ncalibration procedure. (3) It is shown that the MMRD is one of the best\ndistance estimators to novae available to us and that accuracy of the distances\nis predominantly limited by an underestimated peak apparent brightness. (4) It\nis shown that the same MMRD calibration is applicable to novae of all speed\nclass and to both Galactic and extragalactic novae. (5) It is shown that the\nabsolute magnitudes of novae with 2.4 < t_2 < 86$days have a smaller scatter on\nday 12 (M_{V,12} = -6.616 +-0.043) compared to day 15 following optical\nmaximum.\n  We reiterate the need for homogenised high fidelity spectrophotometric data\nin optical bands on classical and recurrent novae in outburst to effectively\nutilise the potential of the MMRD and M_{V,12} in determining their\nluminosities and distances.\n", "  For the innovation of spintronic technologies, Dirac materials, in which the\nlow-energy excitation is described as relativistic Dirac fermions, are one of\nthe most promising systems, because of the fascinating magnetotransport\nassociated with the extremely high mobility. To incorporate Dirac fermions into\nspintronic applications, their quantum transport phenomena are desired to be\nmanipulated to a large extent by magnetic order in a solid. We here report a\nbulk half-integer quantum Hall effect in a layered antiferromagnet EuMnBi$_2$,\nin which field-controllable Eu magnetic order significantly suppresses the\ninterlayer coupling between the Bi layers with Dirac fermions. In addition to\nthe high mobility more than 10,000 cm$^2$/Vs, Landau level splittings\npresumably due to the lifting of spin and valley degeneracy are noticeable even\nin a bulk magnet. These results will pave a route to the engineering of\nmagnetically functionalized Dirac materials.\n", "  Motivated by a recent investigation into the notion of a quantum space\nunderlying ordinary quantum mechanics, we reformulate here the WWGM formalism\nwith canonical coherent states and wavefunctions as expansion coefficients in\nterms of this basis as the starting point. It turns out that this provides us\nwith a transparent and coherent story of simple quantum dynamics where both\nstates (pure and mixed, making use of the Tomita representation), as\nwavefunctions in Hilbert spaces, and observables arise from \\textit{a single\nspace/algebra}. Altogether, putting the emphasis on building our theory out of\nthe underlying relativity symmetry -- the centrally extended Galilean symmetry\nin the case at hand -- allows one to naturally derive both a kinematical and a\ndynamical description of a (free) quantum particle, which moreover recovers the\ncorresponding classical picture (understood in terms of the Koopman-von Neumann\nformalism) in the appropriate (relativity symmetry contraction) limit. Our\nformulation here is the most natural framework directly connecting all of the\nrelevant mathematical notions and we hope it may help a general physicist\nbetter visualize and appreciate the noncommutative-geometric perspective behind\nquantum physics.\n", "  Ferroelectrics with spontaneous electric polarization play an essential role\nin today's device engineering, such as capacitors and memories. Their physical\nproperties are further enriched by suppressing the long-range polar order, as\nis exemplified by quantum paraelectrics with giant piezoelectric and dielectric\nresponses at low temperatures. Likewise in metals, a polar lattice distortion\nhas been theoretically predicted to give rise to various unusual physical\nproperties. So far, however, a \"ferroelectric\"-like transition in metals has\nseldom been controlled and hence its possible impacts on transport phenomena\nremain unexplored. Here we report the discovery of anomalous enhancement of\nthermopower near the critical region between the polar and nonpolar metallic\nphases in 1T'-Mo$_{1-x}$Nb$_{x}$Te$_2$ with a chemically tunable polar\ntransition. It is unveiled from the first-principles calculations and\nmagnetotransport measurements that charge transport with strongly\nenergy-dependent scattering rate critically evolves towards the boundary to the\nnonpolar phase, resulting in large cryogenic thermopower. Such a significant\ninfluence of the structural instability on transport phenomena might arise from\nthe fluctuating or heterogeneous polar metallic states, which would pave a\nnovel route to improving thermoelectric efficiency.\n", "  The electron-quasiparticle interaction (EQI) spectral function has been\nmeasured for $\\rm DyNi_2B_2C$ in the normal state at low temperatures by means\nof point-contact spectroscopy (PCS). A low-frequency peak is found around\n$eV\\sim 5\\ meV$. It becomes measurable at $T_m^*\\simeq 15\\ K$ and grows in\nintensity with constant width as the temperature is lowered. We argue that this\npeak arises from the strong interaction of conduction electron with coupled\ncrystal-electric-field-phonon excitations whose branches cross at low energy.\nThe comparison with PC spectra for $\\rm HoNi_2B_2C$ suggests that a similar\npeak also exists for this compound. The magnitude of the point-contact EQI\nparameter $\\lambda_{PC}$ for $\\rm DyNi_2B_2C$ is estimated. $\\copyright$2000\nPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n", "  A polarity-dependent reversible change in the current-voltage characteristics\nbetween states corresponding to different values of the excess current\n${{I}_{exc}}$ is observed for bias voltages of several hundred millivolts in\n$Ag-ReB{{a}_{2}}C{{u}_{3}}{{O}_{7-x}}$ $\\left( Re\\text{ }=\\text{ }Y,\\text{ }Ho\n\\right)$ point contacts in the current-carrying state. The observed effect has\na high intensity (right up to a complete suppression or recovery of\n${{I}_{exc}}$) and is not accompanied by a noticeable variation of the energy\ngap or the critical temperature in the point contact region. It is also\nestablished that the states with intermediate values of $I_{exc}$ are stable\nfor zero bias voltages across the point contacts, at least up to $110 \\ K$. It\nis assumed that the variation of ${{I}_{exc}}$ and the corresponding\nmodification of IVC are due to the oxygen migration processes induced by the\nelectric field and current, resulting in a local variation of the\nsuperconducting parameters in the point-contact region.\n", "  Due to the distinguished properties offered by different structural phases of\nmonolayer MoS2, phase engineering design are urgently required for achieving\nswitchable structural phase. Strain engineering is widely accepted as a clean\nand flexible method, however, cannot be achieved in engineering monolayer MoS2\nphase transition because the critical biaxial strain required (~15%) is much\nlarger than measured elastic limit (~11%). In this study, employing density\nfunctional theoretical calculations, it has been found out that with the\nforming of heterostructure between MoS2 with buckled 2D materials such as\nsilicence, germanene and stanene, only a small strain can trigger the phase\ntransition. As being suggested by the constructed phase stability diagram,\nbiaxial deformation as low as 3% in MoS2/silicene and MoS2/stanene sandwich\nstructure, would be sufficient to induce the structural phase transition in\nMoS2 lattice. This strain falls well within experimental elastic limit, thus\nwould be feasible to realize in experiment. The origin of such behavior can be\nunderstood as strain induced interlayer covalent bond formation, which finally\nmake MoS2 lattice more sensitive to external strain. This theoretical work\nprovides one realistic route for achieving flexible phase stabilities in\nexperimental design.\n", "  Cross-linked filament bundles, such as in cilia and flagella, are ubiquitous\nin biology. They are considered in textbooks as simple filaments with larger\nstiffness. Recent observations of flagellar counterbend, however, show that\ninduction of curvature in one section of a passive flagellum instigates a\ncompensatory counter-curvature elsewhere, exposing the intricate role of the\ndiminutive cross-linking proteins at large-scales. We show that this effect, a\nmaterial property of the cross-linking mechanics, modifies the bundle dynamics\nnon-trivially, and induces a bimodal $L^2-L^3$ length-dependent material\nresponse that departs from the Euler-Bernoulli theory. Hence, the use of\nsimpler theories to analyse experiments can result in paradoxical\ninterpretations. Remarkably, the counterbend dynamics instigates counter-waves\nin opposition to driven oscillations in distant parts of the bundle, with\npotential impact on the regulation of flagellar bending waves. These results\nhave a range of physical and biological applications, including the empirical\ndisentanglement of material quantities via counterbend dynamics.\n", "  Bold colour images from telescopes act as extraordinary ambassadors for\nresearch astronomers because they pique the public's curiosity. But are they\nsnapshots documenting physical reality? Or are we looking at artistic\nspacescapes created by digitally manipulating astronomy images? This paper\nprovides a tour of how original black and white data, from all regimes of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, are converted into the colour images gracing popular\nmagazines, numerous websites, and even clothing. The history and method of the\ntechnical construction of these images is outlined. However, the paper focuses\non introducing the scientific reader to visual literacy (e.g.human perception)\nand techniques from art (e.g. composition, colour theory) since these\ntechniques can produce not only striking but politically powerful public\noutreach images. When created by research astronomers, the cultures of science\nand visual art can be balanced and the image can illuminate scientific results\nsufficiently strongly that the images are also used in research publications.\nIncluded are reflections on how they could feedback into astronomy research\nendeavours and future forms of visualization as well as on the relevance of\noutreach images to visual art.\n", "  The present work deals with the injection and packing of a flexible polymeric\nrod of length $L$ into a simply connected rectangular domain of area $XY$. As\nthe injection proceeds, the rod bends over itself and it stores elastic energy\nin closed loops. In a typical experiment $N$ of these loops can be identified\ninside the cavity in the jammed state. We have performed an extensive\nexperimental analysis of the total length $L(N, X, Y)$ in the tight packing\nlimit, and have obtained robust power laws relating these variables.\nAdditionally, we have examined a version of this packing problem when the\nsimply connected domain is partially occupied with free discs of fixed size.\nThe experimental results were obtained with 27 types of cavities and obey a\nsingle equation of state valid for the tight packing of rods in domains of\ndifferent topologies. Besides its intrinsic theoretical interest and\ngenerality, the problem examined here could be of interest in a number of\nstudies including packing models of DNA and polymers in several complex\nenvironments.\n", "  Two novel 112-type palladium doped iron arsenides were synthesized and\nidentified using comprehensive studies involving synchrotron x-ray diffraction\nand x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) experiments. Whereas in-plane\narsenic zigzag chains were found in 112-type superconducting iron arsenide,\nCa1-xLaxFeAs2 with maximum Tc = 34 K, deformed arsenic network structures\nappeared in 112-type materials such as longitudinal arsenics zigzag chains in\nCaFe1-yPdyAs2 (y ~ 0.51) and arsenic square sheets constructed via hypervalent\nbonding in Ca1-xLaxFe1-yPdyAs2 (x ~ 0.31, y ~ 0.30). As K-edge XANES spectra\nclarified the similar oxidization states around FeAs4 tetrahedrons, expecting\nus the possible parents for high Tc 112-type iron arsenide superconductors.\n", "  We present extensions of the treatment contained in our recent paper on\nnonlocal Newtonian cosmology [C. Chicone and B. Mashhoon, J. Math. Phys. 57,\n072501 (2016)]. That is, the implications of the recent nonlocal generalization\nof Einstein's theory of gravitation are further investigated within the regime\nof Newtonian cosmology. In particular, we treat the nonlocal problem of\nstructure formation for a spherically symmetric expanding dust model and show\nnumerically that as the central density contrast grows, it tends to decrease\nslowly with radial distance as the universe expands. The nonlocal violation of\nNewton's shell theorem provides a physical interpretation of our numerical\nresults.\n", "  The reported onset temperatures of the flash transition in cubic zirconia\nsingle crystals have been analyzed in the present note. The analysis for\nhigh-temperature low-field data gives an activation energy of 0.99 eV for the\ncharge transport, which agrees well with the measured ionic conductivity data\nin cubic zirconia single crystal. Electrical reduction is believed to play an\nadditional role under low-temperature high-field conditions, facilitating\nelectrical/thermal runaway under more modest conditions.\n", "  Semiconducting nanowire (NW) devices have garnered attention in self-powered\nelectronic and optoelectronic applications. This work explores and exhibits,\nfor the first time for visible light, a clear evidence of the zero-biased\noptoelectronic switching in randomly dispersed Ge and Si NW networks. The test\nbench, on which the NWs were dispersed for optoelectronic characterization, was\nfabricated using standard CMOS fabrication process, and utilized metal contacts\nwith dissimilar work functions - Al and Ni. The randomly dispersed NWs respond\nto light by exhibiting substantial photocurrents and, most remarkably,\ndemonstrate zero-bias photo-switching. The magnitude of the photocurrent is\ndependent on the NW material, as well as the channel length. The photocurrent\nin randomly dispersed GeNWs was found to be higher by orders of magnitude\ncompared to SiNWs. In both of these material systems, when the length of the\nNWs was comparable to the channel length, the currents in sparse NW networks\nwere found to be higher than that in dense NW networks, which can be explained\nby considering various possible arrangements of NWs in these devices.\n", "  Moderate amount of bending strains, ~3% are enough to induce the\nsemiconductor-metal transition in Si nanowires of ~4nm diameter. The influence\nof bending on silicon nanowires of 1 nm to 4.3 nm diameter is investigated\nusing molecular dynamics and quantum transport simulations. Local strains in\nnanowires are analyzed along with the effect of bending strain and nanowire\ndiameter on electronic transport and the transmission energy gap.\nInterestingly, relatively wider nanowires are found to undergo\nsemiconductor-metal transition at relatively lower bending strains. The effect\nof bending strain on electronic properties is then compared with the\nconventional way of straining, i.e. uniaxial, which shows that, the bending is\nmuch more efficient way of straining to enhance the electronic transport and\nalso to induce the semiconductor-metal transition in experimentally realizable\nSi nanowires.\n", "  We aim to carry out an assessment of the scientific value of Oppenheimer's\nresearch on black holes in order to determine and weigh possible factors to\nexplain its neglect by the scientific community, and even by Oppenheimer\nhimself. Dealing primarily with the science and looking closely at the\nscientific culture and the scientific conceptual belief system of the 1930s,\nthe present article seeks to supplement the existent literature on the subject\nby enriching the explanations and possibly complicating the guiding questions.\nWe suggest a rereading of Oppenheimer as a more intriguing, ahead-of-his-time\nfigure.\n", "  How atoms in covalent solids rearrange over a medium-range length-scale\nduring amorphization is a long pursued question whose answer could profoundly\nshape our understanding on amorphous (a-) networks. Based on ab-intio\ncalculations and reverse Monte Carlo simulations of experiments, we\nsurprisingly find that even though the severe chemical disorder in a-GeTe\nundermined the prevailing medium range order (MRO) picture, it is responsible\nfor the experimentally observed MRO. That this thing could happen depends on a\nnovel atomic packing scheme. And this scheme results in a kind of homopolar\nbond chain-like polyhedral clusters. Within this scheme, the formation of\nhomopolar bonds can be well explained by an electron-counting model and further\nvalidated by quantitative bond energy analysis based. Our study suggests that\nthe underlying physics for chemical disorder in a-GeTe is intrinsic and\nuniversal to all severely chemically disordered covalent glasses.\n", "  When electrons are confined in a two dimensional (2D) system, typical quantum\nmechanical phenomena such as Landau quantization can be detected. Graphene\nsystems, including the single atomic layer and few-layer stacked crystals, are\nideal 2D materials for studying a variety of quantum mechanical problems. In\nthis article, we review the experimental progress in the unusual Landau\nquantized behaviors of Dirac fermions in monolayer and multilayer graphene by\nusing scanning tunneling microscopy(STM) and scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy(STS). Through STS measurement of the strong magnetic fields,\ndistinct Landau-level spectra and rich level splitting phenomena are observed\nin different graphene layers. These unique properties provide an effective\nmethod for identifying the number of layers, as well as the stacking orders,\nand investigating the fundamentally physical phenomena of graphene. Moreover,\nin the presence of a strain and charged defects, the Landau quantization of\ngraphene can be significantly modified, leading to unusual spectroscopic and\nelectronic properties.\n", "  We study the geometric measure of quantum coherence recently proposed in\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 020403 (2015)]. Both lower and upper bounds of this\nmeasure are provided. These bounds are shown to be tight for a class of\nimportant coherent states -- maximally coherent mixed states. The trade-off\nrelation between quantum coherence and mixedness for this measure is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Recent observations and a photometric search for variable stars in the Ursa\nMinor dwarf spheroidal galaxy (UMi dSph) are presented. Our observations were\ntaken at Apache Point Observatory in 2014 and 2016 using the 0.5m ARCSAT\ntelescope and the West Mountain Observatory 0.9m telescope of Brigham Young\nUniversity in 2016. Previously known RR Lyrae stars in our field of view of the\nUMi dSph are identified, and we also catalog new variable star candidates.\nTentative classifications are given for some of the new variable stars. We have\nconducted period searches with the data collected with the WMO telescope. Our\nultimate goal is to create an updated catalog of variable stars in the UMi dSph\nand to compare the RR Lyrae stellar characteristics to other RR Lyrae stars\nfound in the Local Group dSph galaxies.\n", "  By using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with a tensor-type four-point\ninteraction between quarks, it is shown that there exists a possibility of a\nspin polarized phase in quark matter at finite temperature and density. When\nthere exists the spin polarization, the spontaneous magnetization may occur if\nthe effect of the anomalous magnetic moment of quark is taken into account. An\nimplication to the compact star objects with strong magnetic field is discussed\nwhen the spin polarization occurs.\n", "  This review is devoted to the detailed consideration of the universal\nstatistical properties of one-dimensional directed polymers in a random\npotential. In terms of the replica Bethe ansatz technique we derive several\nexact results for different types of the free energy probability distribution\nfunctions. In the second part of the review we discuss the problems which are\nstill waiting for their solutions. Several mathematical appendices in the\nending part of the review contain various technical details of the performed\ncalculations.\n", "  In cold dark matter cosmology, the baryonic components of galaxies are\nthought to be mixed with and embedded in non-baryonic and non-relativistic dark\nmatter, which dominates the total mass of the galaxy and its dark matter halo.\nIn the local Universe, the mass of dark matter within a galactic disk increases\nwith disk radius, becoming appreciable and then dominant in the outer, baryonic\nregions of the disks of star-forming galaxies. This results in rotation\nvelocities of the visible matter within the disk that are constant or\nincreasing with disk radius. Comparison between the dynamical mass and the sum\nof stellar and cold gas mass at the peak epoch of galaxy formation, inferred\nfrom ancillary data, suggest high baryon factions in the inner, star-forming\nregions of the disks. Although this implied baryon fraction may be larger than\nin the local Universe, the systematic uncertainties (stellar initial mass\nfunction, calibration of gas masses) render such comparisons inconclusive in\nterms of the mass of dark matter. Here we report rotation curves for the outer\ndisks of six massive star-forming galaxies, and find that the rotation\nvelocities are not constant, but decrease with radius. We propose that this\ntrend arises because of two main factors: first, a large fraction of the\nmassive, high-redshift galaxy population was strongly baryon dominated, with\ndark matter playing a smaller part than in the local Universe; and second, the\nlarge velocity dispersion in high-redshift disks introduces a substantial\npressure term that leads to a decrease in rotation velocity with increasing\nradius. The effect of both factors appears to increase with redshift.\nQualitatively, the observations suggest that baryons in the early Universe\nefficiently condensed at the centres of dark matter halos when gas fractions\nwere high, and dark matter was less concentrated. [Abridged]\n", "  On-chip twisted light emitters are essential components for orbital angular\nmomentum (OAM) communication devices, which could address the growing demand\nfor high-capacity communication systems by providing an additional degree of\nfreedom for wavelength/frequency division multiplexing (WDM/FDM). Although\nwhispering gallery mode enabled OAM emitters have been shown to possess some\nadvantages, such as being compact and phase accurate, their inherent narrow\nbandwidth prevents them from being compatible with WDM/FDM techniques. Here, we\ndemonstrate an ultra-broadband multiplexed OAM emitter that utilizes a novel\njoint path-resonance phase control concept. The emitter has a micron sized\nradius and nanometer sized features. Coaxial OAM beams are emitted across the\nentire telecommunication band from 1450 to 1650 nm. We applied the emitter for\nOAM communication with a data rate of 1.2 Tbit/s assisted by 30-channel optical\nfrequency combs (OFC). The emitter provides a new solution to further increase\nof the capacity in the OFC communication scenario.\n", "  The calculations of the double parton scattering cross sections are\ndiscussed. It is shown that the commonly used factorised formula is valid only\nin the limit of low cross sections. The applicability of this approximation is\nstudied with a more general approach based on the Poisson distribution averaged\nover the impact parameter space.\n", "  We present the results from a systematic analysis of the X-ray continuum\n(`hard') time-lags and intrinsic coherence between the $2-4\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and\nvarious energy bands in the $0.3-10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ range, for ten X-ray bright\nand highly variable active galactic nuclei (AGN). We used all available\narchival \\textit{XMM-Newton} data, and estimated the time-lags following\nEpitropakis \\& Papadakis (2016). By performing extensive numerical simulations,\nwe arrived at useful guidelines for computing intrinsic coherence estimates\nthat are minimally biased, have known errors, and are (approximately) Gaussian\ndistributed. Owing to the way we estimated the time-lags and intrinsic\ncoherence, we were able to do a proper model fitting to the data. Regarding the\ncontinuum time-lags, we are able to demonstrate that they have a power-law\ndependence on frequency, with a slope of $-1$, and that their amplitude scales\nwith the logarithm of the light-curve mean-energy ratio. We also find that\ntheir amplitude increases with the square root of the X-ray Eddington ratio.\nRegarding the intrinsic coherence, we found that it is approximately constant\nat low frequencies. It then decreases exponentially at frequencies higher than\na characteristic `break frequency.' Both the low-frequency constant\nintrinsic-coherence value and the break frequency have a logarithmic dependence\non the light-curve mean-energy ratio. Neither the low-frequency constant\nintrinsic-coherence value, nor the break frequency exhibit a universal scaling\nwith either the central black hole mass, or the the X-ray Eddington ratio. Our\nresults could constrain various theoretical models of AGN X-ray variability.\n", "  There is a long-standing debate about whether gravity should be quantised. A\npowerful line of argument in favour of quantum gravity considers models of\nhybrid systems consisting of coupled quantum-classical sectors. The conclusion\nis that such models are inconsistent: either the quantum sector's defining\nproperties necessarily spread to the classical sector, or they are violated.\nThese arguments have a long history, starting with the debates about the\nquantum nature of the electromagnetic fields in the early days of quantum\ntheory. Yet, they have limited scope because they rely on particular dynamical\nmodels obeying restrictive conditions, such as unitarity. In this paper we\npropose a radically new, more general argument, relying on less restrictive\nassumptions. The key feature is an information-theoretic characterisation of\nboth sectors, including their interaction, via constraints on copying\noperations. These operations are necessary for the existence of observables in\nany physical theory, because they constitute the most general representation of\nmeasurement interactions. Remarkably, our argument is formulated without\nresorting to particular dynamical models, thus being applicable to any hybrid\nsystem, even those ruled by \"post-quantum\" theories. Its conclusion is also\ncompatible with partially quantum systems, such as those that exhibit features\nlike complementarity, but may lack others, such as entanglement. As an example,\nwe consider a hybrid system of qubits and rebits. Surprisingly, despite the\nrebit's lack of complex amplitudes, the signature quantum protocols such as\nteleportation are still possible.\n", "  We demonstrate a compressive normalized ghost imaging system with entangled\nphotons employing complementary compressive imaging (CCI) technique. The\nquantum ghost image reconstruction was achieved at only 19.53% sampling ratio\nof raster scanning. With the special +1/-1 type sensing matrix and appropriate\noptimal algorithm, the photon utilization efficiency and robustness of the\nimaging system is enhanced significantly. Our results reveal the great\npotential of CCI technique applied in quantum imaging and other quantum optics\nfield such as quantum charactering and quantum state tomography to use the\ninformation loaded in each photon with high efficiency.\n", "  Using the same measurement techniques as those of Saket et al. (2017), we\nhave investigated the breaking threshold proposed by Barthelemy et al.\n(arXiv:1508.06002v1, 2015b) but for different classes of unforced\nunidirectional wave groups in intermediate water depths in the laboratory. The\nthreshold parameter $B_x = U_s/C$ (where $U_s$ is the horizontal surface water\nparticle velocity at the wave crest and $C$ is the wave crest point speed)\nwhich distinguishes breaking from non-breaking waves was found to be 0.835\n$\\pm$ 0.005 with the experimental uncertainty of each data point of $\\pm$\n0.020. This threshold is applicable to water depth to wave length ratios as low\nas 0.2 including the deep water conditions investigated by Saket et al. (2017).\nNo dependence on peak spectral wavenumber was found at the scales achievable in\na large-scale laboratory.\n  The present study provides more robust and universal characterisation of\nbreaking in transitional water than the empirical non-dimensionalisation of\nNelson (1994). The limiting wave height to water depth ratios of marginally\nbreaking deep and intermediate water waves remain within 10 % of Nelson's\nvalues. However, it is shown that the effect of wave grouping can produce waves\nin shallower water that are at least 30 % greater in height than the limit\nproposed by Nelson (1994). The present study supports use of limits based on\nMcCowan (1894) and Miche (1944) for coastal engineering design for marginal\nbreaking waves. Three-dimensional and more strongly breaking waves in shallower\nwater may yield wave heights higher than those measured during this study.\n", "  Thermochemical models have been used in the past to constrain the deep oxygen\nabundance in the gas and ice giant planets from tropospheric CO spectroscopic\nmeasurements. Knowing the oxygen abundance of these planets is a key to better\nunderstand their formation. These models have widely used dry and/or moist\nadiabats to extrapolate temperatures from the measured values in the upper\ntroposphere down to the level where the thermochemical equilibrium between\nH$_2$O and CO is established. The mean molecular mass gradient produced by the\ncondensation of H$_2$O stabilizes the atmosphere against convection and results\nin a vertical thermal profile and H$_2$O distribution that departs\nsignificantly from previous estimates. We revisit O/H estimates using an\natmospheric structure that accounts for the inhibition of the convection by\ncondensation. We use a thermochemical network and the latest observations of CO\nin Uranus and Neptune to calculate the internal oxygen enrichment required to\nsatisfy both these new estimates of the thermal profile and the observations.\nWe also present the current limitations of such modeling.\n", "  This paper describes digital radio astronomical receivers used for decameter\nand meter wavelength observations. This paper describes digital radio\nastronomical receivers used for decameter and meter wavelength observations.\nSince 1998, digital receivers performing on-the-fly dynamic spectrum\ncalculations or waveform data recording without data loss have been used at the\nUTR-2 radio telescope, the URAN VLBI system, and the GURT new generation radio\ntelescope. Here we detail these receivers developed for operation in the strong\ninterference environment that prevails in the decameter wavelength range. Data\ncollected with these receivers allowed us to discover numerous radio\nastronomical objects and phenomena at low frequencies, a summary of which is\nalso presented.\n", "  Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been extensively applied to probe\ninterfacial water in many interdisciplinary fields but the disturbance of the\nprobes on the hydrogen-bonding structure of water has remained an intractable\nproblem. Here we report submolecular-resolution imaging of the water clusters\non a NaCl(001) surface within the nearly non-invasive region by a qPlus-based\nnoncontact atomic force microscopy. Comparison with theoretical simulations\nreveals that the key lies in probing the weak high-order electrostatic force\nbetween the quadrupole-like CO-terminated tip and the polar water molecules at\nlarge tip-water distances. This interaction allows the imaging and structural\ndetermination of the weakly bonded water clusters and even of their metastable\nstates without inducing any disturbance. This work may open up new possibility\nof studying the intrinsic structure and electrostatics of ice or water on bulk\ninsulating surfaces, ion hydration and biological water with atomic precision.\n", "  The Ward identities for the charge and heat currents are derived for\nparticle-particle and particle-hole pairs. They are the exact constraints on\nthe current-vertex functions imposed by conservation laws and should be\nsatisfied by consistent theories. While the Ward identity for the charge\ncurrent of electrons is well established, that for the heat current is not\nunderstood correctly. Thus the correct interpretation is presented. On this\nfirm basis the Ward identities for pairs are discussed. As the application of\nthe identity we criticize some inconsistent results in the studies of the\nsuperconducting fluctuation transport and the transport anomaly in the normal\nstate of high-Tc superconductors.\n", "  Martian meteorites can provide valuable information about past environmental\nconditions on Mars. Allan Hills 84001 formed more than 4 Gyr ago, and owing to\nits age and long exposure to the Martian environment, this meteorite has\nfeatures that may record early processes. These features include a highly\nfractured texture, gases trapped during one or more impact events or during\nformation of the rock, and spherical Fe-Mg-Ca carbonates. Here we have\nconcentrated on providing new insights into the context of these carbonates\nusing a range of techniques to explore whether they record multiple\nprecipitation and shock events. The petrographic features and compositional\nproperties of these carbonates indicate that at least two pulses of Mg- and\nFe-rich solutions saturated the rock. Those two generations of carbonates can\nbe distinguished by a very sharp change in compositions, from being rich in Mg\nand poor in Fe and Mn, to being poor in Mg and rich in Fe and Mn. Between these\ntwo generations of carbonate is evidence for fracturing and local corrosion.\n", "  I discuss a renormalisable model based on $\\Delta(27)$ family symmetry with\nan $SO(10)$ grand unified theory (GUT) with spontaneous geometrical $CP$\nviolation. The symmetries are broken close to the GUT breaking scale, yielding\nthe minimal supersymmetric standard model. Low-scale Yukawa structure is\ndictated by the coupling of matter to $ \\Delta(27) $ antitriplets $ \\bar{\\phi}\n$ whose vacuum expectation values are aligned in the CSD3 directions by the\nsuperpotential. Light physical Majorana neutrinos masses emerge from the seesaw\nmechanism within $SO(10)$. The model predicts a normal neutrino mass hierarchy\nwith the best-fit lightest neutrino mass $ m_1 \\sim 0.3 $ meV, $CP$-violating\noscillation phase $\\delta^l\\approx 280^{\\circ}$ and the remaining neutrino\nparameters all within $1 \\sigma$ of their best-fit experimental values.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the dispersion and polarization properties of\nthe electromagnetic waves in a multi-layered structure composed of a\nmagneto-optic waveguide on dielectric substrate covered by one-dimensional\ndielectric photonic crystal. The numerical analysis of such a complex structure\nshows polarization filtration of TE- and TM-modes depending on geometrical\nparameters of the waveguide and photonic crystal. We consider different regimes\nof the modes propagation inside such a structure: when guiding modes propagate\ninside the magnetic film and decay in the photonic crystal; when they propagate\nin both magnetic film and photonic crystal.\n", "  Dynamics of waves generated by scopes in gas centrifuges (GC) for isotope\nseparation is considered. The centrifugal acceleration in the GC reaches values\nof the order of $10^6$g. The centrifugal and Coriolis forces modify essentially\nthe conventional sound waves. Three families of the waves with different\npolarisation and dispersion exist in these conditions. Dynamics of the flow in\nthe model GC Iguasu is investigated numerically. Comparison of the results of\nthe numerical modelling of the wave dynamics with the analytical predictions is\nperformed. New phenomena of the resonances in the GC is found. The resonances\noccur for the waves polarized along the rotational axis having the smallest\ndumping due to the viscosity.\n", "  We study the effect of surface-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) on the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectrum of thickness-modulated\none-dimensional magnonic crystals and isolated stripes. The DMI is found to\nsubstantially increases the intensity of absorption peaks and shifts the\nfrequencies of the laterally quantized modes. The role of the DMI is determined\nby analyzing the amplitude and phase distributions of dynamic magnetic\nexcitations calculated with frequency- and time-domain calculation methods. We\npropose experimentally realizable magnonic crystals and confined structures\nwith multiple FMR absorption peaks. The frequency or magnetic field separation\nbetween FMR lines is exploited to propose a method for estimation of the DMI\nstrength.\n", "  We find that negative charges on an armchair single-walled carbon nanotube\n(SWCNT) can significantly enhance the migration of a carbon adatom on the\nexternal surfaces of SWCNTs, along the direction of the tube axis. Nanotube\ncharging results in stronger binding of adatoms to SWCNTs and consequent longer\nlifetimes of adatoms before desorption, which in turn increases their migration\ndistance several orders of magnitude. These results support the hypothesis of\ndiffusion enhanced SWCNT growth in the volume of arc plasma. This process could\nenhance effective carbon flux to the metal catalyst.\n", "  We present a study of disorder origination and growth inside an ordered phase\nprocesses induced by the presence of multiplicative noise within mean-field\napproximation. Our research is based on the study of solutions of the nonlinear\nself-consistent Fokker-Planck equation for a stochastic spatially extended\nmodel of a chemical reaction. We carried out numerical simulation of the\nprobability distribution density dynamics and statistical characteristics of\nthe system under study for varying noise intensity values and system parameter\nvalues corresponding to a spatially inhomogeneous ordered state in a\ndeterministic case. Physical interpretation of the results obtained that\ndetermines the scenario of noise-induced order-disorder transition is given.\nMean-field results are compared with numerical simulations of the evolution of\nthe model under study.\n  We find that beginning from some value of external noise intensity the\n\"embryo\" of disorder appears inside the ordered phase. Its lifetime is finite,\nand it increases with growth of noise intensity. At some second noise intensity\nvalue the ordered and disordered phases begin to alternate repeatedly and\nalmost periodically. The frequency of intermittency grows with the increasing\nof noise intensity. Ordered and disordered phase intermittency affects the\nprocess of spatial pattern formation as a consequent change of spatial\ninhomogeneity configurations.\n", "  Coherent optical dressing of quantum materials offers technological\nadvantages to control their electronic properties, such as the electronic\nvalley degree of freedom in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).\nHere, we observe a new type of optical Stark effect in monolayer WS2, one that\nis mediated by intervalley biexcitons under the blue-detuned driving with\ncircularly polarized light. We found that such helical optical driving not only\ninduces an exciton energy downshift at the excitation valley, but also causes\nan anomalous energy upshift at the opposite valley, which is normally forbidden\nby the exciton selection rules but now made accessible through the intervalley\nbiexcitons. These findings reveal the critical, but hitherto neglected, role of\nbiexcitons to couple the two seemingly independent valleys, and to enhance the\noptical control in valleytronics.\n", "  Following the spirit of de Broglie and Einstein, we think the concepts of\nmatter and radiation can be unified. We know a particle propagates like a wave;\nits motion is described by certain wave equations. At this point, it is not\nclear what the wave function represents. Besides the statistical meaning\nsuggested by the Copenhagen interpretation, does the wave function represent\nany physical motion? For photon, we know it is an electro-magnetic wave. But\nwhat about particles with rest mass, such as an electron? To investigate the\nphysical nature of matter wave, we propose that: (1) Like the photon, a\nparticle is an excitation wave of a real physical field. (2) Different types of\nparticles are different excitation modes of the same field. Based on this\nthinking, we show that the concept of quantum mechanics can be a natural\nextension of classical mechanics. By critically analyzing the transition from\nclassical physics to quantum physics, we found a new physical meaning for the\nquantum wave function. This work suggests that various quantum wave equations,\nincluding the Klein-Gordon equation, the Dirac equation and the Schrodinger\nequation, could have a common base relating to the Basic Wave Equation of the\nmatter wave. This work has some interesting implications. It suggests a\npossible way to explain the origin of visible matters and dark matters in our\nuniverse.\n"]}
