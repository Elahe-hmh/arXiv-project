Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 740 (2007)] is shown from density\nfunctional theory calculations to originate from a Cu Shockley surface state at\nthe surface Brillouin zone boundary of the clean surface with highly\nanisotropic dispersion. The presence of the glycinate ions on the surface\ncauses a dramatically enhanced tunneling into this surface state that is\notherwise not observed in tunneling on the bare surface.\n", "  Hilbert spaces of states can be constructed in standard quantum field theory\nonly for infinitely extended spacelike hypersurfaces, precluding a more local\nnotion of state. In fact, the Reeh-Schlieder Theorem prohibits the localization\nof states on pieces of hypersurfaces in the standard formalism. From the point\nof view of geometric quantization the problem lies in the non-locality of the\ncomplex structures associated to hypersurfaces in standard quantization. We\nshow that using a weakened version of the positive formalism puts this problem\ninto a new perspective. This is a local TQFT type formalism based on\nsuper-operators and mixed state spaces rather than on amplitudes and pure state\nspaces as the one of Atiyah-Segal. In particular, we show that in the case of\npurely fermionic degrees of freedom the complex structure can be dispensed with\nwhen the notion of state is suitably generalized. These generalized states do\nlocalize on compact hypersurfaces with boundaries. For the simplest case of\nfree fermionic fields we embed this in a rigorous and functorial quantization\nscheme yielding a local description of the quantum theory. Crucially, no\nclassical data is needed beyond the structures evident from a Lagrangian\nsetting. When the classical data is augmented with complex structures on\nhypersurfaces, the quantum data correspondingly augment to the full positive\nformalism. This scheme is applicable to field theory in curved spacetime, but\nalso to field theories without metric background.\n", "  A simplified density functional theory (DFT) method for charged adsorbates on\nan ultrathin, insulating film supported by a metal substrate is developed and\npresented. This new method is based on a previous DFT development that uses a\nperfect conductor (PC) model to approximate the electrostatic response of the\nmetal substrate, while the film and the adsorbate are both treated fully within\nDFT [I. Scivetti and M. Persson, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter 25,\n355006 (2013)]. The missing interactions between the metal substrate and the\ninsulating film in the PC approximation are modelled by a simple force field\n(FF). The parameters of the PC model and the force field are obtained from DFT\ncalculations of the film and the substrate, here shown explicitly for a NaCl\nbilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface. In order to obtain some of these\nparameters and the polarisability of the force field, we have to include an\nexternal, uniformly charged plane in the DFT calculations, which has required\nthe development of a periodic DFT formalism to include such a charged plane in\nthe presence of a metal substrate. This extension and implementation should be\nof more general interest and applicable to other challenging problems, for\ninstance, in electrochemistry. As illustrated for the gold atom on the NaCl\nbilayer supported by a Cu(100) surface, our new DFT-PC-FF method allows us to\nhandle different charge states of adsorbates in a controlled and accurate\nmanner with a considerable reduction of the computational time. In addition, it\nis now possible to calculate vertical transition and reorganisation energies\nfor charging and discharging of adsorbates that cannot be obtained by current\nDFT methodologies that include the metal substrate. We find that the computed\nvertical transition energy for charging of the gold adatom is in good agreement\nwith experiments.\n", "  We consider a rather general type of matrix model, where the matrix M\nrepresents a Hamiltonian of the interaction of a bosonic system with a single\nfermion. The fluctuations of the matrix are partly given by some fundamental\nrandomness and partly dynamically, even quantum mechanically. We then study the\nhomolumo-gap effect, which means that we study how the level density for the\nsingle-fermion Hamiltonian matrix M gets attenuated near the Fermi surface. In\nthe case of the quenched randomness (the fundamental one) dominating the\nquantum mechanical one we show that in the first approximation the homolumo gap\nis characterized by the absence of single-fermion levels between two steep gap\nboundaries. The filled and empty level densities are in this first\napproximation just pushed, each to its side. In the next approximation these\nsteep drops in the spectral density are smeared out to have an error-function\nshape. The studied model could be considered as a first step towards the more\ngeneral case of considering a whole field of matrices - defined say on some\nphase space - rather than a single matrix.\n", "  Of basic interest is the quantification of the long term growth of a\nlanguage's lexicon as it develops to more completely cover both a culture's\ncommunication requirements and knowledge space. Here, we explore the usage\ndynamics of words in the English language as reflected by the Google Books 2012\nEnglish Fiction corpus. We critique an earlier method that found decreasing\nbirth and increasing death rates of words over the second half of the 20th\nCentury, showing death rates to be strongly affected by the imposed time cutoff\nof the arbitrary present and not increasing dramatically. We provide a robust,\nprincipled approach to examining lexical evolution by tracking the volume of\nword flux across various relative frequency thresholds. We show that while the\noverall statistical structure of the English language remains stable over time\nin terms of its raw Zipf distribution, we find evidence of an enduring `lexical\nturbulence': The flux of words across frequency thresholds from decade to\ndecade scales superlinearly with word rank and exhibits a scaling break we\nconnect to that of Zipf's law. To better understand the changing lexicon, we\nexamine the contributions to the Jensen-Shannon divergence of individual words\ncrossing frequency thresholds. We also find indications that scholarly works\nabout fiction are strongly represented in the 2012 English Fiction corpus, and\nsuggest that a future revision of the corpus should attempt to separate\ncritical works from fiction itself.\n", "  We calculate the local quasi-particle current of a Majorana state in a planar\nhybrid (superconductor-semiconductor) nanowire. In absence of perpendicular\ncomponents of the magnetic field the current flows in circular trajectories\nwithout a preferred orientation. On the other hand, when a perpendicular\ncomponent of the magnetic field is present the quasi-particle current\ncirculates surrounding the Majorana density peak with an orientation\nestablished by the magnetic field.\n", "  We calculate the electromagnetic absorption cross section of long and narrow\nnanowires, in the so-called quasi-1D limit. We consider only two transverse\nbands and compute the dipole absorption cross section taking into account\nquasiparticle transitions from negative to positive energy eigenstates of the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. The presence of the zero energy (Majorana)\nstate manifests in the different absorption spectra for $x$ (parallel) and $y$\n(transverse) polarizations of the electromagnetic field.\n  In the $y$-polarized case, the Majorana state causes a low energy absorption\nplateau extending from mid-gap up to full-gap energy. Increasing further the\nenergy, the plateau is followed by a region of enhanced absorption due to\ntransitions across the full gap. For $x$ polarization the low energy absorption\nplateau is not observed.\n", "  Families of energy operators and generalized energy operators have recently\nbeen introduced in the definition of the solutions of linear Partial\nDifferential Equations (PDEs) with a particular application to the wave\nequation [Montillet, 2014, doi: 10.1007/s10440-014-9978-9]. To do so, the\nauthor has introduced the notion of energy spaces included in the Schwartz\nspace $\\mathbf{S}^-(\\mathbb{R})$. In this model, the key is to look at which\nones of these subspaces are reduced to {0} with the help of energy operators\n(and generalized energy operators). It leads to define additional solutions for\na nominated PDE. Beyond that, this work intends to develop the concept of\nmultiplicity of solutions for a linear PDE through the study of these energy\nspaces (i.e. emptiness). The main concept is that the PDE is viewed as a\ngenerator of solutions rather than the classical way of solving the given\nequation with a known form of the solutions together with boundary conditions.\nThe theory is applied to the wave equation with the special case of the\nevanescent waves. The work ends with a discussion on another concept, the\nduplication of solutions and some applications in a closed cavity.\n", "  In a recent comment, M. Kosterlitz described how the discrepancy about the\nlack of broken translational symmetry in two dimensions - doubting the\nexistence of 2D crystals - and the first computer simulations foretelling 2D\ncrystals at least in tiny systems, motivated him and D. Thouless to investigate\nmelting and suprafluidity in two dimensions [Jour. of Phys. Cond. Matt.\n\\textbf{28}, 481001 (2016)]. The lack of broken symmetries proposed by D.\nMermin and H. Wagner is caused by long wavelength density fluctuations. Those\nfluctuations do not only have structural impact but additionally a dynamical\none: They cause the Lindemann criterion to fail in 2D and the mean squared\ndisplacement not to be limited. Comparing experimental data from 3D and 2D\namorphous solids with 2D crystals we disentangle Mermin-Wagner fluctuations\nfrom glassy structural relaxations. Furthermore we can demonstrate with\ncomputer simulations the logarithmic increase of displacements predicted by\nMermin and Wagner: periodicity is not a requirement for Mermin-Wagner\nfluctuations which conserve the homogeneity of space on long scales.\n", "  Although networks provide a powerful approach to study a large variety of\necological systems, their formulation does not typically account for multiple\ninteraction types, interactions that vary in space and time, and interconnected\nsystems such as networks of networks. The emergent field of `multilayer\nnetworks' provides a natural framework for extending analyses of ecological\nsystems to include such multiple layers of complexity, as it specifically\nallows one to differentiate and model `intralayer' and `interlayer'\nconnectivity. The framework provides a set of concepts and tools that can be\nadapted and applied to ecology, facilitating research on high-dimensional,\nheterogeneous systems in nature. Here, we formally define ecological multilayer\nnetworks based on a review of previous and related approaches, illustrate their\napplication and potential with analyses of existing data, and discuss\nlimitations, challenges, and future applications. The integration of multilayer\nnetwork theory into ecology offers largely untapped potential to further\naddress ecological complexity, to ultimately provide new theoretical and\nempirical insights into the architecture and dynamics of ecological systems.\n", "  In contrast to its bulk crystals, the FeSe film or layer exhibits better\nsuperconductivity performance, which attract much interest in its fundamental\nresearch as well as potential application. In present work, transition from\ninsulator to superconductor and significant enhancement of superconductivity\nwere achieved in the high quality (00l) oriented FeSe films via controlling the\nthickness as well as the Fe/Se ratio. The highest Tc up to 15.2 K (almost 2\ntimes higher than those of bulk crystals) and Hc2 up to 35.5 T are obtained in\nour atmosphere-stable FeSe thin film with practical thickness (240 nm),\nimplying their great potential application in the electronic devices at high\nmagnetic fields. More importantly, it was found that the Fe-vacancy disorder in\nFeSe films is the intrinsic factor determining the evolution of the\nsuperconductivity, rather than thickness effect. In our non-superconducting\nFeSe film with Fe/Se ratio of 1.00:1.09, insulating \\b{eta}-Fe1-xSe phase with\niron-vacancy disorders is the main phase and more likely to be the parent phase\nof FeSe superconducting system. Tuning the Fe-vacancy disorders via changing\nthe Fe/Se ratio can dramatically vary the concentration of charge carrier and\nintroduce proper electron doping, which finally leads to the transition from\ninsulator to superconductor and further enhancement in the superconductivity.\nIntriguingly, our results also indicate that when the Fe/Se ratio of film is\nbeyond a critical value, superconducting FeSe films will become instable, and\nphase separation occurs with new non-superconducting phase precipitating in the\nsuperconducting matrix, causing the degradation in the superconductivity. The\nresults in present work help us to well understand the intrinsic mechanism of\nsuperconductivity among Fe-Se superconducting system and provide a new strategy\nto further pursue higher Tc in these materials.\n", "  Current terrestrial gravitational-wave detectors operate at frequencies above\n10 Hz. There is strong astrophysical motivation to construct low-frequency\ngravitational-wave detectors capable of observing 10 mHz - 10Hz signals. While\nspace-based detectors provide one means of achieving this end, one may also\nconsider terretrial detectors. However, there are numerous technological\nchallenges. In particular, it is difficult to isolate test masses so that they\nare both seismically isolated and freely falling under the influence of gravity\nat millihertz frequencies. We investigate the challenges of low-frequency\nsuspension in a hypothetical terrestrial detector. As a case study, we consider\na Magnetically Assisted Gravitational-wave Pendulum Intorsion (MAGPI)\nsuspension design. We construct a noise budget to estimate some of the required\nspecifications. In doing so, we identify what are likely to be a number of\ngeneric limiting noise sources for terrestrial millihertz gravitational-wave\nsuspension systems (as well as some peculiar to the MAGPI design). We highlight\nsignificant experimental challenges in order to argue that the development of\nmillihertz suspensions will be a daunting task. Any system that relies on\nmagnets faces even greater challenges. Entirely mechanical designs such as\nZollner pendulums may provide the best path forward.\n", "  We investigate the connection between recent results in quantum\nthermodynamics and fluctuation relations by adopting a fully quantum mechanical\ndescription of thermodynamics. By including a work system whose energy is\nallowed to fluctuate, we derive a set of equalities which all thermodynamical\ntransitions have to satisfy. This extends the condition for maps to be\nGibbs-preserving to the case of fluctuating work, providing a more general\ncharacterisation of maps commonly used in the information theoretic approach to\nthermodynamics. For final states, block diagonal in the energy basis, this set\nof equalities are necessary and sufficient conditions for a thermodynamical\nstate transition to be possible. The conditions serves as a parent equation\nwhich can be used to derive a number of results. These include writing the\nsecond law of thermodynamics as an equality featuring a fine-grained notion of\nthe free energy. It also yields a generalisation of the Jarzynski fluctuation\ntheorem which holds for arbitrary initial states, and under the most general\nmanipulations allowed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we show\nthat each of these relations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three\nfully quantum identities. This allows us to consider the free energy as an\noperator, and allows one to obtain more general and fully quantum fluctuation\nrelations from the information theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics.\n", "  The relation between the theory of entanglement and thermodynamics is very\ntight: a thermodynamic theory of quantum entanglement, as well as the\nestablishment of rigorous formal connections between the laws of thermodynamics\nand the phenomenology of entanglement are currently open areas of\ninvestigation. In this quest, an interesting problem is embodied by the role\nplayed by entanglement in processes of work extraction from a working medium\nembodied by quantum information carriers. In this work, we experimentally\naddress the question \"Is there any intrinsic advantage for work extraction\ngiven by the use of an entangled working medium?\". By addressing\nwork-extraction protocols based on a mechanism intimately linked to the\nparadigm of Maxwell's daemon, and implementing suitably designed multi-photon\noptical interferometers, we demonstrate experimentally the intrinsic advantages\nfor such tasks provided by bipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement. We\nhighlight the unique nature of such tests by comparing their performance to\nstandard tests for the inseparability of multi-photon state resources. Our work\ncontributes strongly to the ongoing efforts in establishing photonic systems as\na platform for experiments for information thermodynamics.\n", "  We analyze the thermodynamics of the noncommutative high-dimensional\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini AdS black hole with the non-Gaussian smeared matter\ndistribution by regarding a noncommutative parameter as an independent\nthermodynamic variable named as the noncommutative pressure. In the new\nextended phase space that includes this noncommutative pressure and its\nconjugate variable, we reveal that the noncommutative pressure and the original\nthermodynamic pressure related to the negative cosmological constant make the\nopposite effects in the phase transition of the noncommutative black hole, i.e.\nthe former dominates the UV regime while the latter does the IR regime,\nrespectively. In addition, by means of the reverse isoperimetric inequality, we\nindicate that only the black hole with the Gaussian smeared matter distribution\nholds the maximum entropy for a given thermodynamic volume among the\nnoncommutative black holes with various matter distributions.\n", "  Business elites reconfigure their locus of organization over time, from the\ncity level, to the national level, and beyond. We ask what the current level of\nelite organization is and propose a novel theoretical and empirical approach to\nanswer this question. Building on the universal distinction between local and\nnonlocal ties we use network analysis and community detection to dissect the\nglobal network of interlocking directorates among over five million firms. We\nfind that elite orientation is indeed changing from the national to the\ntransnational plane, but we register a considerable heterogeneity across\ndifferent regions in the world. In some regions the business communities are\norganized along national borders, whereas in other areas the locus of\norganization is at the city level or international level. London dominates the\nglobal corporate elite network. Our findings underscore that the study of\ncorporate elites requires an approach that is sensitive to levels of\norganization that go beyond the confines of nation states.\n", "  We study a quantum electrodynamics (QED) system made of an two-level atom and\na semi-infinite rectangular waveguide, which behaves as a perfect mirror in one\nend. The spatial dependence of the atomic spontaneous emission has been\nincluded in the coupling strength relevant to the eigenmodes of the waveguide.\nThe role of retardation is studied for the atomic transition frequency far away\nfrom the cutoff frequencies. The atom-mirror distance introduces different\nphases and retardation times into the dynamics of the atom interacting\nresonantly with the corresponding transverse modes. It is found that the upper\nstate population decreases from its initial as long as the atom-mirror distance\ndoes not vanish, and is lowered and lowered when more and more transverse modes\nare resonant with the atom. The atomic spontaneous emission can be either\nsuppressed or enhanced by adjusting the atomic location for short retardation\ntime. There are partial revivals and collapses due to the photon reabsorbed and\nre-emitted by the atom for long retardation time.\n", "  In this work, by investigating the low temperature behaviour of a scalar\nfield around a cosmic string, and assuming stable thermodynamic equilibrium, it\nis shown that the coupling parameter of the field with curvature must be\nrestricted to a certain range of values whose bounds are determined by the\ndeficit angle of the associated conical geometry.\n", "  Corporations across the world are highly interconnected in a large global\nnetwork of corporate control. This paper investigates the global board\ninterlock network, covering 400,000 firms linked through 1,700,000 edges\nrepresenting shared directors between these firms. The main focus is on the\nconcept of centrality, which is used to investigate the embeddedness of firms\nfrom a particular country within the global network. The study results in three\ncontributions. First, to the best of our knowledge for the first time we can\ninvestigate the topology as well as the concept of centrality in corporate\nnetworks at a global scale, allowing for the largest cross-country comparison\never done in interlocking directorates literature. We demonstrate, amongst\nother things, extremely similar network topologies, yet large differences\nbetween countries when it comes to the relation between economic prominence\nindicators and firm centrality. Second, we introduce two new metrics that are\nspecifically suitable for comparing the centrality ranking of a partition to\nthat of the full network. Using the notion of centrality persistence we propose\nto measure the persistence of a partition's centrality ranking in the full\nnetwork. In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to\nwhich the footprint of a national network is still present within the global\nnetwork. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a\npartition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality\nranking of the full (global) network. Finally, comparing these two new measures\nof persistence and dominance between different countries allows us to classify\nthese countries based the their embeddedness, measured using the relation\nbetween the centrality of a country's firms on the national and the global\nscale of the board interlock network.\n", "  In a previous paper a multi-species version of the q-Boson stochastic\nparticle system is introduced and the eigenfunctions of its backward generator\nare constructed by using a representation of the Hecke algebra. In this article\nwe prove a formula which expresses the eigenfunctions by means of the\nq-deformed bosonic operators, which are constructed from the L-operator of\nhigher rank found in the recent work by Garbali, de Gier and Wheeler. The\nL-operator is obtained from the universal R-matrix of the quantum affine\nalgebra of type A_{r}^{(1)} by the use of the q-oscillator representation. Thus\nour formula may be regarded as a bridge between two approaches to studying\nintegrable stochastic systems by means of the quantum affine algebra and the\naffine Hecke algebra.\n", "  Generalized dispersion relations are discussed for unphysical particles, e.g.\nconfined degrees of freedom that are not present in the physical spectra but\ncan give rise to observable bound states. While in general the propagator of\nthe unphysical particles can have complex poles and cannot be reconstructed\nfrom the knowledge of the imaginary part, under reasonable assumptions the\nmissing piece of information is shown to be in the rational function that\ncontains the poles and must be added to the integral representation. For pure\nYang-Mills theory, the rational part and the spectral term are identified in\nthe explicit analytical expressions provided by the massive expansion of the\ngluon propagator. The multi particle spectral term turns out to be very small\nand the simple rational part provides, from first principles, an approximate\npropagator that is equivalent to the tree-level result of simple\nphenomenological models like the refined Gribov-Zwanziger model.\n", "  We discuss a set of novel discrete symmetry transformations of the N = 4\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanical model of a charged particle moving on a\nsphere in the background of Dirac magnetic monopole. The usual five continuous\nsymmetries (and their conserved Noether charges) and two discrete symmetries\ntogether provide the physical realizations of the de Rham cohomological\noperators of differential geometry. We have also exploited the supervariable\napproach to derive the nilpotent N = 4 SUSY transformations and provided the\ngeometrical interpretation in the language of translational generators along\nthe Grassmannian directions onto (1, 4)-dimensional supermanifold.\n", "  We show that spin $S=1$ system with large and random single--ion anisotropy\ncan be at low energies mapped to a $S=1/2$ system with random magnetic fields.\nThis is for example realized in\n\\mbox{Ni(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_{x}$)$_2$-4SC(NH$_2$)$_2$} compound (DTNX) and therefore\nit represents a long sought realization of random local (on-site) magnetic\nfields in antiferromagnetic systems. We support the mapping by numerical study\nof $S=1$ and effective $S=1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chains and find excellent\nagreement for static quantities and also for the spin conductivity. Such\nsystems can therefore be used to study the effects of local random magnetic\nfields on transport properties.\n", "  The $\\Lambda$CDM model, or concordance cosmology, as it is often called, is a\nparadigm at its maturity. It is clearly able to describe the universe at large\nscale, even if some issues remain open, such as the cosmological constant\nproblem , the small-scale problems in galaxy formation, or the unexplained\nanomalies in the CMB. $\\Lambda$CDM clearly shows difficulty at small scales,\nwhich could be related to our scant understanding, from the nature of dark\nmatter to that of gravity; or to the role of baryon physics, which is not well\nunderstood and implemented in simulation codes or in semi-analytic models. At\nthis stage, it is of fundamental importance to understand whether the problems\nencountered by the $\\Lambda$DCM model are a sign of its limits or a sign of our\nfailures in getting the finer details right. In the present paper, we will\nreview the small-scale problems of the $\\Lambda$CDM model, and we will discuss\nthe proposed solutions and to what extent they are able to give us a theory\naccurately describing the phenomena in the complete range of scale of the\nobserved universe.\n", "  Pulsars are some of the most accurate clocks found in nature, while black\nholes offer a unique arena for the study of quantum gravity. As such,\npulsar-black hole (PSR-BH) binaries provide ideal astrophysical systems for\ndetecting the effects of quantum gravity. With the success of aLIGO and the\nadvent of instruments like the SKA and eLISA, the prospects for the discovery\nof such PSR-BH binaries are very promising. We argue that PSR-BH binaries can\nserve as ready-made testing grounds for proposed resolutions to the black hole\ninformation paradox. We propose using timing signals from a pulsar beam passing\nthrough the region near a black hole event horizon as a probe of quantum\ngravitational effects. In particular, we demonstrate that fluctuations of the\ngeometry outside a black hole lead to an increase in the measured root mean\nsquare deviation of the arrival times of pulsar pulses traveling near the\nhorizon. This allows for a clear observational test of the nonviolent\nnonlocality proposal for black hole information escape. For a series of pulses\ntraversing the near-horizon region, this model predicts an rms in pulse arrival\ntimes of $\\sim30\\ \\mu$s for a $3 M_\\odot$ black hole, $\\sim0.3\\, $ms for a $30\nM_\\odot$ black hole, and $\\sim40\\, $s for Sgr A*. The current precision of\npulse time-of-arrival measurements is sufficient to discern these rms\nfluctuations. This work is intended to motivate observational searches for\nPSR-BH systems as a means of testing models of quantum gravity.\n", "  The numerical unitarity approach has been important for obtaining reliable\nQCD predictions for the LHC. Here I discuss the extension of the approach\nbeyond the leading quantum corrections for computing multi-loop amplitudes. The\nnumerical unitarity approach requires a suitable parametrisation of the loop\nintegrands as a sum of terms that integrate to zero (surface terms) and master\nintegrands. The construction and classification of suitable surface terms which\nmatch the propagators structures of Feynman amplitudes is the main technical\nadvance discussed. A number of spin-offs for integral reduction and further\nformal questions are briefly reviewed.\n", "  A universal behavior is predicted for ghost and gluon propagators in the\ninfrared. The universal behavior is shown to be a signature of a one-loop\napproximation and emerges naturally by the massive expansion that predicts\nuniversal analytical functions for the inverse dressing functions that do not\ndepend on any parameter or color number. By a scaling of units and by adding an\nintegration constant, all lattice data, for different color numbers (and even\nquark content for the ghosts), collapse on the same universal curves predicted\nby the massive expansion.\n", "  We present a new exploration of the cosmic star-formation history and dust\nobscuration in massive galaxies at redshifts $0.5< z<6$. We utilize the deepest\n450 and 850$\\mu$m imaging from SCUBA-2 CLS, covering 230arcmin$^2$ in the\nAEGIS, COSMOS and UDS fields, together with 100-250$\\mu$m imaging from\nHerschel. We demonstrate the capability of the T-PHOT deconfusion code to reach\nbelow the confusion limit, using multi-wavelength prior catalogues from\nCANDELS/3D-HST. By combining IR and UV data, we measure the relationship\nbetween total star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass up to $z\\sim5$,\nindicating that UV-derived dust corrections underestimate the SFR in massive\ngalaxies. We investigate the relationship between obscuration and the UV slope\n(the IRX-$\\beta$ relation) in our sample, which is similar to that of\nlow-redshift starburst galaxies, although it deviates at high stellar masses.\nOur data provide new measurements of the total SFR density (SFRD) in\n$M_\\ast>10^{10}M_\\odot$ galaxies at $0.5<z<6$. This is dominated by obscured\nstar formation by a factor of $>10$. One third of this is accounted for by\n450$\\mu$m-detected sources, while one fifth is attributed to UV-luminous\nsources (brighter than $L^\\ast_{UV}$), although even these are largely\nobscured. By extrapolating our results to include all stellar masses, we\nestimate a total SFRD that is in good agreement with previous results from IR\nand UV data at $z\\lesssim3$, and from UV-only data at $z\\sim5$. The cosmic\nstar-formation history undergoes a transition at $z\\sim3-4$, as predominantly\nunobscured growth in the early Universe is overtaken by obscured star\nformation, driven by the build-up of the most massive galaxies during the peak\nof cosmic assembly.\n", "  The possibility of recovering and protecting the entanglement of accelerated\n2-qubit and 2-qutrit systems is discussed using weak-reverse measurements. The\naccelerated partial entangled states are more responsive to be protected than\nthe accelerated maximum entangled states. The accelerated coded local\ninformation in qutrit system is more robust than that encoded in a 2-qubit\nsystem, and it can be conserved even for larger values of accelerations.\nMeanwhile, the non-accelerated information in qubit system is not affected by\nthe local operation compared with that depicted on qutrit system. For larger\nvalues of accelerations, the weak-reverse measurements can improve the coherent\ninformation at the expanse of the accelerated information.\n", "  This article introduces a novel binary representation of the canonical\ngenetic code based on both the structural similarities of the nucleotides, as\nwell as the physicochemical properties of the encoded amino acids. Each of the\nfour mRNA bases is assigned a unique 2-bit identifier, so that the 64 triplet\ncodons are each indexed by a 6-bit label. The ordering of the bits reflects the\nhierarchical organization manifested by the DNA replication/repair and tRNA\ntranslation systems. In this system, transition and transversion mutations are\nnaturally expressed as binary operations, and the severities of the different\npoint mutations can be analyzed. Using a principal component analysis, it is\nshown that the physicochemical properties of amino acids related to protein\nfolding also correlate with certain bit positions of their respective labels.\nThus, the likelihood for a point mutation to be conservative, and less likely\nto cause a change in protein functionality, can be estimated.\n", "  We explore the detection, with upcoming spectroscopic surveys, of\nthree-dimensional power spectra of emission line fluctuations produced in\ndifferent phases of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) by ionized carbon, ionized\nnitrogen and neutral oxygen at redshift z>4. The emission line [CII] from\nionized carbon at 157.7 micron, and multiple emission lines from carbon\nmonoxide, are the main targets of planned ground-based surveys, and an\nimportant foreground for future space-based surveys like the Primordial\nInflation Explorer (PIXIE). However, the oxygen [OI] (145.5 micron) line, and\nthe nitrogen [NII] (121.9 micron and 205.2 micron) lines, might be detected in\ncorrelation with [CII] with reasonable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These lines\nare important coolants of both the neutral and the ionized medium, and probe\nmultiple phases of the ISM. We compute predictions of the three-dimensional\npower spectra for two surveys designed to target the [CII] line, showing that\nthey have the required sensitivity to detect cross-power spectra with the [OI]\nline, and the [NII] lines with sufficient SNR. The importance of\ncross-correlating multiple lines is twofold. On the one hand, we will have\nmultiple probes of the different phases of the ISM, which is key to understand\nthe interplay between energetic sources, the gas and dust at high redshift.\nThis kind of studies will be useful for a next-generation space observatory\nsuch as the NASA Far-IR Surveyor. On the other end, emission lines from\nexternal galaxies are an important foreground when measuring spectral\ndistortions of the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum with future space-based\nexperiments like PIXIE; measuring fluctuations in the intensity mapping regime\nwill help constraining the mean amplitude of these lines, and will allow us to\nbetter handle this important foreground.\n", "  Over the past decade a large family of spintronic devices have been proposed\nas candidates for replacing CMOS for future digital logic circuits. Using the\nrecently developed Modular Approach framework, we investigate and identify the\nphysical bottlenecks and engineering challenges facing current spintronic\ndevices. We then evaluate how systematic advancements in material properties\nand device design innovations impact the performance of spintronic devices, as\na possible continuation of Moore's Law, even though some of these projections\nare speculative and may require technological breakthroughs. Lastly, we\nillustrate the use of the Modular Approach as an exploratory tool for\nprobabilistic networks, using superparamagnetic magnets as building blocks for\nsuch networks. These building blocks leverage the inherent physics of\nstochastic spin-torque switching and could provide ultra-compact and efficient\nhardware for beyond-Boolean computational paradigms.\n", "  We study the effects of strong coupling between a superconductor and a\nsemiconductor nanowire on the creation of the Majorana bound states, when the\nquasiparticle dwell time in the normal part of the nanowire is much shorter\nthan the inverse superconducting gap. This \"short junction\" limit is relevant\nfor the recent experiments using the epitaxially grown aluminum characterized\nby a transparent interface with the semiconductor and a small superconducting\ngap. We find that the small superconducting gap does not have a strong\ndetrimental effect on the Majorana properties. Specifically, both the critical\nmagnetic field required for creating a topological phase and the size of the\nMajorana bound states are independent of the superconducting gap. The critical\nmagnetic field scales with the wire cross section, while the relative\nimportance of the orbital and Zeeman effects of the magnetic field is\ncontrolled by the material parameters only: $g$-factor, effective electron\nmass, and the semiconductor-superconductor interface transparency.\n", "  A nontrivial instantaneous variant of the Bethe-Salpeter formalism allows us\nto discuss massless pseudoscalar mesons from a configuration-space-potential\npoint of view.\n", "  We consider different spin supplementary conditions (SSC) for a spinning\ncompact binary with the leading-order spin-orbit (SO) interaction. The\nLagrangian of the binary system can be constructed but it is\nacceleration-dependent in two cases of SSC. We rewrite the generalized\nHamiltonian formalism proposed by Ostrogradsky and compute the conserved\nquantities and the dissipative part of relative motion during the gravitational\nradiation of each SSC. We give the orbital elements and observed quantities of\nthe SO dynamics, for instance the energy and the orbital angular momentum\nlosses and waveforms and discuss their SSC dependence.\n", "  The number $\\mathcal{N}$ of stable fixed points of locally coupled Kuramoto\nmodels depends on the topology of the network on which the model is defined. It\nhas been shown that cycles in meshed networks play a crucial role in\ndetermining $\\mathcal{N}$, because any two different stable fixed points differ\nby a collection of loop flows on those cycles. Since the number of different\nloop flows increases with the length of the cycle that carries them, one\nexpects $\\mathcal{N}$ to be larger in meshed networks with longer cycles.\nSimultaneously, the existence of more cycles in a network means more freedom to\nchoose the location of loop flows differentiating between two stable fixed\npoints. Therefore, $\\mathcal{N}$ should also be larger in networks with more\ncycles. We derive an algebraic upper bound for the number of stable fixed\npoints of the Kuramoto model with identical frequencies, under the assumption\nthat angle differences between connected nodes do not exceed $\\pi/2$. We obtain\n$\\mathcal{N}\\leq\\prod_{k=1}^c\\left[2\\cdot{\\rm Int}(n_k/4)+1\\right]$, which\ndepends both on the number $c$ of cycles and on the spectrum of their lengths\n$\\{n_k\\}$. We further identify network topologies carrying stable fixed points\nwith angle differences larger than $\\pi/2$, which leads us to conjecture an\nupper bound for the number of stable fixed points for Kuramoto models on any\nplanar network. Compared to earlier approaches that give exponential upper\nbounds in the total number of vertices, our bounds are much lower and therefore\nmuch closer to the true number of stable fixed points.\n", "  We determine the strong couplings of three mesons that involve, at least, one\n$\\eta_c$ or $J/\\psi$ meson, within the framework of a constituent-quark model\nby means of relativistic dispersion formulations. For strong couplings of\n$J/\\psi$ mesons to two charmed mesons, our approach leads to predictions\nroughly twice as large as those arising from QCD sum rules.\n", "  Compared with lattice QCD, isospin breaking of heavy-meson decay constants\nfrom QCD sum rules agrees for $D$ mesons but disagrees (by a factor of four)\nfor $B$ mesons.\n", "  We present the optical spectroscopic study of two Classical Be stars, 59 Cyg\nand OT Gem obtained over a period of few months in 2009. We detected a rare\ntriple-peak H$\\alpha$ emission phase in 59 Cyg and a rapid decrease in the\nemission strength of H$\\alpha$ in OT Gem, which are used to understand their\ncircumstellar disks. We find that 59 Cyg is likely to be rapid rotator,\nrotating at a fractional critical rotation of $\\sim$ 0.80. The radius of the\nH$\\alpha$ emission region for 59 Cyg is estimated to be $R_d/R_*$ $\\sim$ 10.0,\nassuming a Keplerian disk, suggesting that it has a large disk. We classify\nstars which have shown triple-peaks into two groups and find that the\ntriple-peak emission in 59 Cyg is similar to $\\zeta$ Tau. OT Gem is found to\nhave a fractional critical rotation of $\\sim$ 0.30, suggesting that it is\neither a slow rotator or viewed in low inclination. In OT Gem, we observed a\nlarge reduction in the radius of the H$\\alpha$ emission region from $\\sim$ 6.9\nto $\\sim$ 1.7 in a period of three months, along with the reduction in the\nemission strength. Our observations suggest that the disk is lost from outside\nto inside during this disk loss phase in OT Gem.\n", "  Beyond perturbation theory gauge-fixing becomes more involved due to the\nGribov-Singer ambiguity: The appearance of additional gauge copies requires to\ndefine a procedure how to handle them. For the case of Landau gauge the\nstructure and properties of these additional gauge copies will be investigated.\nBased on these properties gauge conditions are constructed to account for these\ngauge copies.\n  The dependence of the propagators on the choice of these complete\ngauge-fixings will then be investigated using lattice gauge theory for\nYang-Mills theory. It is found that the implications for the infrared, and to\nsome extent mid-momentum behavior, can be substantial. In going beyond the\nYang-Mills case it turns out that the influence of matter can generally not be\nneglected. This will be briefly discussed for various types of matter.\n", "  The dual formulation of the compact U(1) lattice gauge theory in three\nspacetime dimensions allows to finely study the squared width and the profile\nof the confining flux tube on a wide range of physical interquark distances.\nThe results obtained in Monte Carlo simulations are compared with the\npredictions of the effective bosonic-string model and with the dual\nsuperconductor model. While the former fails at describing the data from a\nquantitative point of view, the latter is in good agreement with it. An\ninterpretation of these results is proposed in light of the particular features\nof the U(1) lattice gauge theory in 3D and a comparison with non-Abelian gauge\ntheories in four spacetime dimensions is discussed.\n", "  Jarzynski's equality is a well-known result in statistical mechanics,\nrelating free-energy differences between equilibrium ensembles with\nfluctuations in the work performed during non-equilibrium transformations from\none ensemble to the other. In this work, an extension of this relation to\nlattice gauge theory will be presented, along with numerical results for the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge model in three dimensions and for the equation of state in\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Then, further\napplications will be discussed, in particular for the Schr\\\"odinger functional\nand for the study of QCD in strong magnetic fields.\n", "  The goal of the COMPASS experiment at CERN is to study the structure and\nspectroscopy of hadrons. The two-stage spectrometer has large acceptance and\ncovers a wide kinematic range for charged as well as neutral particles allowing\nto access a wide range of reactions. Light mesons are studied with negative\n(mostly $\\pi^-$) and positive ($p$, $\\pi^+$) hadron beams with a momentum of\n$190\\,\\text{GeV}/c$.\n  The light-meson spectrum is measured in different final states produced in\ndiffractive dissociation reactions with squared four-momentum transfer $t$ to\nthe target between $0.1$ and $1.0\\,(\\text{GeV}/c)^2$. The flagship channel is\nthe $\\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ final state, for which COMPASS has recorded the currently\nworld's largest data sample. These data not only allow us to measure the\nproperties of known resonances with high precision, but also to search for new\nstates. Among these is a new axial-vector signal, the $a_1(1420)$, with unusual\nproperties. The findings are confirmed by the analysis of the $\\pi^-\\pi^0\\pi^0$\nfinal state.\n", "  An important problem in precision cosmology is the determination of the\neffects of averaging and backreaction on observational predictions,\nparticularly in view of the wealth of new observational data and improved\nstatistical techniques. In this paper, we discuss the observational viability\nof a class of averaged cosmologies which consist of a simple parametrized\nphenomenological two-scale backreaction model with decoupled spatial curvature\nparameters. We perform a Bayesian model selection analysis and find that this\nclass of averaged phenomenological cosmological models is favored with respect\nto the standard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological scenario when a joint analysis of\ncurrent SNe Ia and BAO data is performed. In particular, the analysis provides\nobservational evidence for non-trivial spatial curvature.\n", "  We present a proposal to measure anisotropic shear viscosity in a strongly\ninteracting, ultra-cold, unitary Fermi gas confined in a harmonic trap. We\nintroduce anisotropy in this setup by strongly confining the gas in one of the\ndirections with relatively weak confinement in the remaining directions. This\nsystem has a close resemblance to anisotropic strongly coupled field theories\nstudied recently in the context of gauge-gravity duality. Computations in such\ntheories (which have gravity duals) revealed that some of the viscosity\ncomponents of the anisotropic shear viscosity tensor can be made much smaller\nthan the entropy density, thus parametrically violating the bound proposed by\nKovtun, Son and Starinets (KSS): $\\frac {\\eta} {s} \\geq \\frac{1}{4 \\pi}$. A\nBoltzmann analysis performed in a system of weakly interacting particles in a\nlinear potential also shows that components of the viscosity tensor can be\nreduced. Motivated by these exciting results, we propose two hydrodynamic modes\nin the unitary Fermi gas whose damping is governed by the component of shear\nviscosity expected to violate the KSS bound. One of these modes is the well\nknown scissor mode. We estimate trap parameters for which the reduction in the\nshear viscosity is of order unity and find that the trap geometry, the damping\ntimescales, and mode amplitudes are within the range of existing experimental\nsetups on ultra-cold Fermi gases.\n", "  We estimate the teleported and the gained parameters by means of Fisher\ninformation in a non-inertial frame. The sender and the receiver share an\naccelerated maximum or partial entangled state. The estimation degree of these\nparameters depends on Unruh acceleration, the used single mode\napproximation(within/ beyond), the structure of the initial teleported state,\nand the entanglement of the initial communication channel. The maximization and\nminimization estimation degree of the teleported parameters depend on the\ninitial encoded information. The estimation degree of the parameters can be\nmaximized if the partners teleport classical information.\n", "  The field theoretic renormalization group (RG) and the operator product\nexpansion (OPE) are applied to the model of a density field advected by a\nrandom turbulent velocity field. The latter is governed by the stochastic\nNavier-Stokes equation for a compressible fluid. The model is considered near\nthe special space dimension $d = 4$. It is shown that various correlation\nfunctions of the scalar field exhibit anomalous scaling behaviour in the\ninertial-convective range. The scaling properties in the RG+OPE approach are\nrelated to fixed points of the renormalization group equations. In comparison\nwith physically interesting case $d = 3$, at $d = 4$ additional Green function\nhas divergences which affect the existence and stability of fixed points. From\ncalculations it follows that a new regime arises there and then by continuity\nmoves into $d = 3$. The corresponding anomalous exponents are identified with\nscaling dimensions of certain composite fields and can be systematically\ncalculated as series in $y$ (the exponent, connected with random force) and\n$\\epsilon=4-d$. All calculations are performed in the leading one-loop\napproximation.\n", "  Revisiting the QCD sum-rule description of exotic hadron states, we argue\nthat, in order to arrive at trustable analyses of, for instance, strong decay\nwidths of multiquarks, it is inevitable to adopt the QCD sum-rule approach\nbeyond the leading perturbative level.\n", "  We evaluate the light-quark meson contributions to three exact light-by-light\nscattering sum rules in light of new data by the Belle Collaboration, which\nrecently has extracted the transition form factors of the tensor meson\n$f_2(1270)$ as well as of the scalar meson $f_0(980)$. We confirm a previous\nfinding that the $\\eta, \\eta^\\prime$ and helicity-2 $f_2(1270)$ contributions\nsaturate one of these sum rules up to photon virtualities around 1 GeV$^2$. At\nlarger virtualities, our sum rule analysis shows an important contribution of\nthe $f_2(1565)$ meson and provides a first empirical extraction of its\nhelicity-2 transition form factor. Two further sum rules allow us to predict\nthe helicity-0 and helicity-1 transition form factors of the $f_2(1270)$ meson.\nFurthermore, our analysis also provides an update for the scalar and tensor\nmeson hadronic light-by-light contributions to the muon's anomalous magnetic\nmoment.\n", "  The study of lattice gauge theories with Monte Carlo simulations is hindered\nby the infamous sign problem that appears under certain circumstances, in\nparticular at non-zero chemical potential. So far, there is no universal method\nto overcome this problem. However, recent years brought a new class of\nnon-perturbative Hamiltonian techniques named tensor networks, where the sign\nproblem is absent. In previous work, we have demonstrated that this approach,\nin particular matrix product states in 1+1 dimensions, can be used to perform\nprecise calculations in a lattice gauge theory, the massless and massive\nSchwinger model. We have computed the mass spectrum of this theory, its thermal\nproperties and real-time dynamics. In this work, we review these results and we\nextend our calculations to the case of two flavours and non-zero chemical\npotential. We are able to reliably reproduce known analytical results for this\nmodel, thus demonstrating that tensor networks can tackle the sign problem of a\nlattice gauge theory at finite density.\n", "  The quark-gluon plasma created in a relativistic heavy-ion collisions\npossesses a sizable pressure anisotropy in the local rest frame at very early\ntimes after the initial nuclear impact and this anisotropy only slowly relaxes\nas the system evolves. In a kinetic theory picture, this translates into the\nexistence of sizable momentum-space anisotropies in the underlying partonic\ndistribution functions, <p_L^2> << <p_T^2>. In such cases, it is better to\nreorganize the hydrodynamical expansion by taking into account momentum-space\nanisotropies at leading-order in the expansion instead of as a perturbative\ncorrection to an isotropic distribution. The resulting anisotropic\nhydrodynamics framework has been shown to more accurately describe the dynamics\nof rapidly expanding systems such as the quark-gluon plasma. In this\nproceedings contribution, I review the basic ideas of anisotropic\nhydrodynamics, recent progress, and present a few preliminary phenomenological\npredictions for identified particle spectra and elliptic flow.\n", "  The chiral plasmon modes of relativistic matter in background magnetic and\nstrain-induced pseudomagnetic fields are studied in detail using the consistent\nchiral kinetic theory. The results reveal a number of anomalous features of\nthese chiral magnetic and pseudomagnetic plasmons that could be used to\nidentify them in experiment. In a system with nonzero electric (chiral)\nchemical potential, the background magnetic (pseudomagnetic) fields not only\nmodify the values of the plasmon frequencies in the long-wavelength limit, but\nalso affect the qualitative dependence on the wave vector. Similar\nmodifications can be also induced by the chiral shift parameter in Weyl\nmaterials. Interestingly, even in the absence of the chiral shift and external\nfields, the chiral chemical potential alone leads to a splitting of plasmon\nenergies at linear order in the wave vector.\n", "  Strongly dipolar Bose gases can form liquid droplets stabilized by quantum\nfluctuations. In theoretical description of this phenomenon, low energy\nscattering amplitude is utilized as an effective potential. We show that for\nmagnetic atoms corrections with respect to Born approximation arise, and derive\nmodified pseudopotential using realistic interaction model. We discuss the\nresulting changes in collective mode frequencies and droplet stability diagram.\nOur results are relevant for recent experiments with erbium and dysprosium\natoms.\n", "  This paper describes the Fermilab Holometer, an instrument for measuring\ncorrelations of position variations over a four-dimensional volume of\nspace-time. The apparatus consists of two co-located, but independent and\nisolated, 40m power-recycled Michelson interferometers, whose outputs are\ncross-correlated to 25 MHz. The data are sensitive to correlations of\ndifferential position across the apparatus over a broad band of frequencies up\nto and exceeding the inverse light crossing time, 7.6 MHz. A noise model\nconstrained by diagnostic and environmental data distinguishes among physical\norigins of measured correlations, and is used to verify shot-noise-limited\nperformance. These features allow searches for exotic quantum correlations that\ndepart from classical trajectories at spacelike separations, with a strain\nnoise power spectral density sensitivity smaller than the Planck time. The\nHolometer in current and future configurations is projected to provide\nprecision tests of a wide class of models of quantum geometry at the Planck\nscale, beyond those already constrained by currently operating gravitational\nwave observatories.\n", "  Three dimensional gauge theories with a discrete gauge group can emerge from\nspin models as a gapped topological phase with fractional point excitations\n(gauge charge) and loop excitations (gauge flux). It is known that 3D gauge\ntheories can be \"twisted\", in the sense that the gauge flux loops can have\nnontrivial braiding statistics among themselves and such twisted gauge theories\nare realized in models discovered by Dijkgraaf and Witten. A different\nframework to systematically construct three dimensional topological phases was\nproposed by Walker and Wang and a series of examples have been studied. Can the\nWalker Wang construction be used to realize the topological order in twisted\ngauge theories? This is not immediately clear because the Walker-Wang\nconstruction is based on a loop condensation picture while the Dijkgraaf-Witten\ntheory is based on a membrane condensation picture. In this paper, we show that\nthe answer to this question is Yes, by presenting an explicit construction of\nthe Walker Wang models which realize both the twisted and untwisted gauge\ntheories with gauge group $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$. We identify the\ntopological order of the models by performing modular transformations on the\nground state wave functions and show that the modular matrices exactly match\nthose for the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theories. By relating\nthe Walker-Wang construction to the Dijkgraaf-Witten construction, our result\nopens up a way to study twisted gauge theories with fermonic charges, and\ncorrespondingly strongly interacting fermionic symmetry protected topological\nphases and their surface states, through exactly solvable models.\n", "  The formation of QGP in heavy ion collisions gives us a great opportunity for\nlearning about nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. Semiholography provides a new\nconsistent framework to combine perturbative and non-perturbative effects in a\ncoherent way and can be applied to obtain an effective description for heavy\nion collisions. In particular, it allows us to include nonperturbative effects\nin existing glasma effective theory and QCD kinetic theory for the weakly\ncoupled saturated degrees of freedom liberated by the collisions in the initial\nstages in a consistent manner. We argue why the full framework should be able\nto confront experiments with only a few phenomenological parameters and present\nfeasibility tests for the necessary numerical computations. Furthermore, we\ndiscuss that semiholography leads to a new description of collective flow in\nthe form of a generalised non-Newtonian fluid. We discuss some open questions\nwhich we hope to answer in the near future.\n", "  We compute the masses of the pseudoscalar mesons $\\pi^+$ , $K^0$ and $D^+$ at\nfinite temperature and baryon chemical potential. The computations are based on\na symmetry- preserving Dyson-Schwinger equation treatment of a vector-vector\nfour quark contact interaction. The results found for the temperature\ndependence of the meson masses are in qualitative agreement with lattice QCD\ndata and QCD sum rules calculations. The chemical potential dependence of the\nmasses provide a novel prediction of the present computation.\n", "  We demonstrate numerically the existence of a nontrivial topological Haldane\nphase for the one-dimensional extended ($U$-$V$) Hubbard model with a mean\ndensity of one particle per site, not only for bosons but also for anyons,\ndespite a broken reflection parity symmetry. The Haldane insulator, surrounded\nby superfluid, Mott insulator and density-wave phases in the $V$-$U$ parameter\nplane, is protected by combined (modified) spatial-inversion and time-reversal\nsymmetries, which is verified within our matrix-product-state based infinite\ndensity-matrix renormalization group scheme by analyzing generalized transfer\nmatrices. With regard to an experimental verification of the anyonic Haldane\ninsulator state the calculated asymmetry of the dynamical density structure\nfactor should be of particular importance.\n", "  In this work, we investigate $O(4)$-symmetric instantons within the\nEddington-inspired-Born-Infeld gravity theory (EiBI). We discuss the regular\nHawking-Moss instanton and find that the tunneling rate reduces to the General\nRelativity (GR) value, even though the action value is different by a constant.\nWe give a thorough analysis of the singular Vilenkin instanton and the\nHawking-Turok instanton with a quadratic scalar field potential in the EiBI\ntheory. In both cases, we find that the singularity can be avoided in the sense\nthat the physical metric, its scalar curvature and the scalar field are regular\nunder some parameter restrictions, but there is a curvature singularity of the\nauxiliary metric compatible with the connection. We find that the on-shell\naction is finite and the probability does not reduce to its GR value. We also\nfind that the Vilenkin instanton in the EiBI theory would still cause the\ninstability of the Minkowski space, similar to that in GR, and this is\nobservationally inconsistent. This result suggests that the singularity of the\nauxiliary metric may be problematic at the quantum level and that these\ninstantons should be excluded from the path integral.\n", "  We consider ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in the conformal\nwindow. By applying a suitable matter superfield rescaling and a\nWeyl-transformation the renormalisation group running (matter and gauge field\n$Z$-factors) are absorbed into the metric. The latter becomes a function of the\n$Z$-factors. The Euler flow $\\Delta a \\equiv a_{\\rm UV} - a_{\\rm IR} |_{{\\cal\nN}=1}$ is then obtained by free field theory computation with the non-trivial\ndynamics coming from expanding the Euler invariant in the flow dependent\nmetric. The result is therefore directly obtained in terms of the infrared\nanomalous dimension confirming an earlier result using the matching of\nconserved currents.\n", "  We study the decoherence process of a four spin-1/2 antiferromagnet that is\ncoupled to an environment of spin-1/2 particles. The preferred basis of the\nantiferromagnet is discussed in two limiting cases and we identify two\n$\\it{exact}$ pointer states. Decoherence near the two limits is examined\nwhereby entropy is used to quantify the $\\it{robustness}$ of states against\nenvironmental coupling. We find that close to the quantum measurement limit,\nthe self-Hamiltonian of the system of interest can become dynamically relevant\non macroscopic timescales. We illustrate this point by explicitly constructing\na state that is more robust than (generic) states diagonal in the\nsystem-environment interaction Hamiltonian.\n", "  The recent low value of Planck (2016) integrated optical depth to Thomson\nscattering suggests that the reionization occurred fairly suddenly, disfavoring\nextended reionization scenarios. This will have a significant impact on the\n21cm power spectrum. Using a semi-numerical framework, we improve our model\nfrom Hassan et al. (2016) to include time-integrated ionisation and\nrecombination effects, and find that this leads to more sudden reionisation. It\nalso yields larger HII bubbles which leads to an order of magnitude more 21cm\npower on large scales, while suppressing the small scale ionization power.\nLocal fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen density play the dominant role in\nboosting the 21cm power spectrum on large scales, while recombinations are\nsubdominant. We use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach to constrain our model\nto observations of the star formation rate functions at z = 6,7,8 from Bouwens\net al. (2015), the Planck (2016) optical depth measurements, and the Becker &\nBolton (2013) ionising emissivity data at z~5. We then use this constrained\nmodel to perform 21cm forecasting for LOFAR, HERA, and SKA in order to\ndetermine how well such data can characterise the sources driving reionisation.\nWe find that the 21cm power spectrum alone can somewhat constrain the halo mass\ndependence of ionising sources, the photon escape fraction and ionising\namplitude, but combining the 21cm data with other current observations enables\nus to separately constrain all these parameters. Our framework illustrates how\n21cm data can play a key role in understanding the sources and topology of\nreionisation as observations improve.\n", "  We discuss the energy density,temperature and entropy of dark matter (DM) and\ndark energy (DE) as functions of the scale factor $a$ in an expanding universe.\nIn a model of non-interacting dark components we repeat a derivation from\nthermodynamics of the well-known relations between the energy density,entropy\nand temperature. In particular, the entropy is constant as a consequence of the\nenergy conservation. We consider a model of the DM/DE interaction where DM\nenergy density increase is proportional to the particle density. In such a\nmodel the dependence of the energy density and the temperature on the scale\nfactor $a$ is substantially modified. We discuss (as a realization of the\nmodel) DM which consists of relativistic particles diffusing in an environment\nof DE. The energy gained by the dark matter comes from a cosmological fluid\nwith a negative pressure. We define the entropy and free energy of such a\nnon-equilibrium system. We show that during the universe evolution the entropy\nof DM is increasing whereas the entropy of DE is decreasing. The total entropy\ncan increase (in spite of the energy conservation) as DM and DE temperatures\nare different. We discuss non-equilibrium thermodynamics on the basis of the\nnotion of relative entropy.\n", "  We study the generation of strong large scale magnetic fields in compact\nstars containing degenerate quark matter with unbroken chiral symmetry. The\nmagnetic field growth is owing to the magnetic field instability driven by the\nelectroweak interaction of quarks. In this system we predict the enhancement of\nthe seed magnetic field $10^{12}\\,\\text{G}$ to the strengths\n$(10^{14}-10^{15})\\,\\text{G}$. In our analysis we use the typical parameters of\nthe quark matter in the core of a hybrid star or in a quark star. We also apply\nof the obtained results to model the generation of magnetic fields in\nmagnetars.\n", "  We show that the eight-dimensional instanton solution, which satisfies the\nself-duality equation $F \\wedge F = *_8 F \\wedge F$, realizes the static\nSkyrmion configuration in eight dimensions through the Atiyah-Manton\nconstruction. The relevant energy functional of the Skyrme field is obtained by\nthe formalism developed by Sutcliffe. By comparing the Skyrmion olution\nassociated with the extreme of the energy, with the Atiyah-Manton solution\nconstructed by the instantons, we find that they agree with high accuracy. This\nis a higher-dimensional analogue of the Atiyah-Manton construction of Skyrmions\nin four dimensions. Our result indicates that the instanton/Skyrmion\ncorrespondence seems to be an universal property in $4k \\ (k=1, 2, \\ldots)$\ndimensions.\n", "  A characteristic change of seismicity has been recently uncovered when the\nprecursory Seismic Electric Signals activities initiate before an earthquake\noccurrence. In particular, the fluctuations of the order parameter of\nseismicity exhibit a simultaneous distinct minimum upon analyzing the seismic\ncatalogue in a new time domain termed natural time and employing a sliding\nnatural time window comprising a number of events that would occur in a few\nmonths. Here, we focus on the minima preceding all earthquakes of magnitude 8\n(and 9) class that occurred in Japanese area from 1 January 1984 to 11 March\n2011 (the day of the M9 Tohoku earthquake). By applying Detrended Fluctuation\nAnalysis to the earthquake magnitude time series, we find that each of these\nminima is preceded as well as followed by characteristic changes of temporal\ncorrelations between earthquake magnitudes. In particular, we identify the\nfollowing three main features. The minima are observed during periods when long\nrange correlations have been developed, but they are preceded by a stage in\nwhich an evident anti-correlated behavior appears. After the minima, the long\nrange correlations break down to an almost random behavior turning to\nanti-correlation. The minima that precede M$\\geq$7.8 earthquakes are\ndistinguished from other minima which are either non-precursory or followed by\nsmaller earthquakes.\n", "  By applying natural time analysis to the time series of earthquakes, we find\nthat the order parameter of seismicity exhibits a unique change approximately\nat the date(s) at which Seismic Electric Signals (SES) activities have been\nreported to initiate. In particular, we show that the fluctuations of the order\nparameter of seismicity in Japan exhibits a clearly detectable minimum\napproximately at the time of the initiation of the SES activity observed almost\ntwo months before the onset of the Volcanic-seismic swarm activity in 2000 in\nthe Izu Island region, Japan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that, well before the occurrence of major earthquakes, anomalous changes\nare found to appear almost simultaneously in two independent datasets of\ndifferent geophysical observables (geoelectrical measurements, seismicity). In\naddition, we show that these two phenomena are also linked closely in space.\n", "  We study the growth of the operator entanglement entropy (EE) of the time\nevolution operator in chaotic, many-body localized and Floquet systems. In the\nrandom field Heisenberg model we find a universal power law growth of the\noperator EE at weak disorder, a logarithmic growth at strong disorder, and\nextensive saturation values in both cases. In a Floquet spin model, the\nsaturation value after an initial linear growth is identical to the value of a\nrandom unitary operator (the Page value). We understand these properties by\nmapping the operator EE to a global quench problem evolved with a similar\nparent-Hamiltonian in an enlarged Hilbert space with the same chaotic, MBL and\nFloquet properties as the original Hamiltonian. The scaling and saturation\nproperties reflect the spreading of the state EE of the corresponding time\nevolution. We conclude that the EE of the evolution operator should\ncharacterize the propagation of information in these systems.\n", "  Displacements of atoms and molecules away from lattice sites in helium and\nparahydrogen solids at low temperature have been studied by means of Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. In the bcc phases of He-3 and He-4, atomic\ndisplacements are largely quantum-mechanical in character, even at melting. The\ncomputed Lindemann ratio at melting is found to be in good agreement with\nexperimental results for He-4. Unlike the case of helium, in solid parahydrogen\nthere exists near melting a significant thermal contribution to molecular\nvibrations, accounting for roughly half of the total effect. Although the\nLindemann ratio at melting is in quantitative agreement with experiment,\ncomputed molecular mean square fluctuations feature a clear temperature\ndependence, in disagreement with recent experimental observations.\n", "  Site-controlled growth of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) represents a major\nadvancement to achieve scalable quantum technology platforms. One immediate\nbenefit is the deterministic integration of quantum emitters into optical\nmicrocavities. However, site-controlled growth of QDs is usually achieved at\nthe cost of reduced optical quality. Here, we show that the buried-stressor\ngrowth technique enables the realization of high-quality site-controlled QDs\nwith attractive optical and quantum optical properties. This is evidenced by\nperforming excitation power dependent resonance fluorescence experiments at\ncryogenic temperatures showing QD emission linewidths down to 10 $\\mu$eV.\nResonant excitation leads to the observation of the Mollow triplet under CW\nexcitation and enables coherent state preparation under pulsed excitation.\nUnder resonant $\\pi$-pulse excitation we observe clean single photon emission\nassociated with $g^{(2)}(0)=0.12$ limited by non-ideal laser suppression.\n", "  In this paper we investigate light dark matter scenarios where annihilation\nto Standard Model particles at tree-level is kinematically forbidden. In such\ncases annihilation can be aided by massive Standard Model-like species, called\n{\\it assisters}, in the initial state that enhances the available phase space\nopening up novel tree-level processes. We investigate the feasibility of such\nnon-standard {\\it assisted annihilation} processes to reproduce the observed\nrelic density of dark matter. We present a simple scalar dark matter - scalar\nassister model where this is realised. We find that if the dark matter and\nassister are relatively degenerate the required relic density can be achieved\nfor a keV-MeV scale dark matter. We briefly discuss the cosmological\nconstraints on such dark matter scenarios.\n", "  The dispersive approach to QCD is briefly overviewed and its application to\nthe assessment of hadronic contributions to electroweak observables is\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the expected variance of measurements of the Hubble constant, $H_0$,\nas calculated in either linear perturbation theory or using non-linear velocity\npower spectra derived from $N$-body simulations. We compare the variance with\nthat obtained by carrying out mock observations in the N-body simulations, and\nshow that the estimator typically used for the local Hubble constant in studies\nbased on perturbation theory is different from the one used in studies based on\nN-body simulations. The latter gives larger weight to distant sources, which\nexplains why studies based on N-body simulations tend to obtain a smaller\nvariance than that found from studies based on the power spectrum. Although\nboth approaches result in a variance too small to explain the discrepancy\nbetween the value of $H_0$ from CMB measurements and the value measured in the\nlocal universe, these considerations are important in light of the percent\ndetermination of the Hubble constant in the local universe.\n", "  We identify a class of $U(1)_X$ models which can explain the $R_K$ anomaly\nand the neutrino mixing pattern, by using a bottom-up approach. The different\n$X$-charges of lepton generations account for the lepton universality violation\nrequired to explain $R_K$. In addition to the three right-handed neutrinos\nneeded for the Type-I seesaw mechanism, these minimal models only introduce an\nadditional doublet Higgs and a singlet scalar. While the former helps in\nreproducing the quark mixing structure, the latter gives masses to neutrinos\nand the new gauge boson $Z^\\prime$. Our bottom-up approach determines the\n$X$-charges of all particles using theoretical consistency and experimental\nconstraints. We find the parameter space allowed by the constraints from\nneutral meson mixing, rare $b\\to s$ decays and direct collider searches for\n$Z^\\prime$. Such a $Z^\\prime$ may be observable at the ongoing run of the Large\nHadron Collider with a few hundred fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulation, we study dipolar glass in crystals\ncomposed of slightly spheroidal, polar particles and spherical, apolar\nimpurities between metal walls. We present physical pictures of ferroelectric\nglass, which have been observed in relaxors, mixed crystals (such as\nKCN$_x$KBr$_{1-x}$), and polymers. Our systems undergo a diffuse transition in\na wide temperature range, where we visualize polar nanoregions (PNRs)\nsurrounded by impurities. In our simulation, the impurities form clusters and\ntheir space distribution is heterogeneous. The polarization fluctuations are\nenhanced at relatively high $T$ depending on the size of the dipole moment.\nThey then form frozen PNRs as $T$ is further lowered into the nonergodic\nregime. As a result, the dielectric permittivity exhibits the characteristic\nfeatures of relaxor ferroelectrics. We also examine nonlinear response to\ncyclic applied electric field and nonergodic response to cyclic temperature\nchanges (ZFC$/$FC), where the polarization and the strain change collectively\nand heterogeneously. We also study antiferroelectric glass arising from\nmolecular shape asymmetry. We use an Ewald scheme of calculating the dipolar\ninteraction in applied electric field.\n", "  We have laser cooled 3$\\times10^6$ $^{87}$Rb atoms to 3$\\mu$K in a\nmicro-fabricated grating magneto-optical trap (GMOT), enabling future\nmass-deployment in highly accurate compact quantum sensors. We magnetically\ntrap the atoms, and use Larmor spin precession for magnetic sensing in the\nvicinity of the atomic sample. Finally, we demonstrate an array of\nmagneto-optical traps with a single laser beam, which will be utilised for\nfuture cold atom gradiometry.\n", "  We demonstrate the successful experimental implementation of a multi-stage\nZeeman decelerator utilizing the new concept described in the accompanying\npaper. The decelerator consists of an array of 25 hexapoles and 24 solenoids.\nThe performance of the decelerator in acceleration, deceleration and guiding\nmodes is characterized using beams of metastable Helium ($^3S$) atoms. Up to\n60% of the kinetic energy was removed for He atoms that have an initial\nvelocity of 520 m/s. The hexapoles consist of permanent magnets, whereas the\nsolenoids are produced from a single hollow copper capillary through which\ncooling liquid is passed. The solenoid design allows for excellent thermal\nproperties, and enables the use of readily available and cheap electronics\ncomponents to pulse high currents through the solenoids. The Zeeman decelerator\ndemonstrated here is mechanically easy to build, can be operated with\ncost-effective electronics, and can run at repetition rates up to 10 Hz.\n", "  From our Secret Lives of Cepheids program, the prototype Classical Cepheid,\n$\\delta$ Cep, is found to be an X-ray source with periodic pulsation-modulated\nX-ray variations. This finding complements our earlier reported phase-dependent\nFUV--UV emissions of the star that increase $\\sim$10--20 times with highest\nfluxes at $\\sim0.90-0.95\\phi$, just prior to maximum brightness. Previously,\n$\\delta$ Cep was found as potentially X-ray variable, using XMM-Newton\nobservations (Engle et al. 2014). Additional phase-constrained data were\nsecured with Chandra near X-ray emission peak, to determine if the emission and\nvariability were pulsation-phase-specific to $\\delta$ Cep and not transient or\ndue to a possible coronally-active, cool companion. The Chandra data were\ncombined with prior XMM-Newton observations, and very closely match the\npreviously observed X-ray behavior. From the combined dataset, a\n$\\sim$4$\\times$ increase in X-ray flux is measured, reaching a peak $L_X$ = 1.7\n$\\times$ 10$^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ near 0.45$\\phi$. The precise X-ray flux phasing\nwith the star's pulsation indicates that the emissions arise from the Cepheid\nand not a companion. However, it is puzzling that maximum X-ray flux occurs\n$\\sim$0.5$\\phi$ ($\\sim$3 days) later than the FUV--UV maximum. There are\nseveral other potential Cepheid X-ray detections with properties similar to\n$\\delta$ Cep, and comparable X-ray variability is indicated for two other\nCepheids: $\\beta$ Dor and V473 Lyr. X-ray generating mechanisms in $\\delta$ Cep\nand other Cepheids are discussed. If additional Cepheids are confirmed to show\nphased X-ray variations, then $\\delta$ Cep will be the prototype of new class\nof pulsation-induced X-ray variables.\n", "  Induced coherence in parametric down-conversion between two coherently pumped\nnonlinear crystals that share a common idler mode can be used as an imaging\ntechnique. Based on the interference between the two signal modes of the\ncrystals, an image can be reconstructed. By obtaining an expression for the\ninterference pattern that is valid in both the low- and the high-gain regimes\nof parametric down-conversion, we show how the coherence of the light emitted\nby the two crystals can be controlled. With our comprehensive analysis we\nprovide deeper insight into recent discussions about the application of induced\ncoherence to imaging in different regimes. Moreover, we propose a scheme for\noptimizing the visibility of the interference pattern so that it directly\ncorresponds to the degree of coherence of the light generated in the two\ncrystals. We find that this scheme leads in the high-gain regime to a\nvisibility arbitrarily close to unity.\n", "  We show that graphene-dielectric multilayers give rise to an unusual\ntunability of the Casimir-Lifshitz forces, and allow to easily realize\ncompletely different regimes within the same structure. Concerning thermal\neffects, graphene-dielectric multilayers take advantage from the anomalous\nfeatures predicted for isolated suspended graphene sheets, even though they are\nconsiderably affected by the presence of the dielectric substrate. They can\nalso archive the anomalous non-monotonic thermal metallic behavior by\nincreasing the graphene sheets density and their Fermi energy. In addition to a\nstrong thermal modulation occurring at short separations, in a region where the\nforce is orders of magnitude larger than the one occurring at large distances,\nthe force can be also adjusted by varying the number of graphene layers as well\nas their Fermi energy levels, allowing for relevant force amplifications which\ncan be tuned, very rapidly and in-situ, by simply applying an electric\npotential. Our predictions can be relevant for both Casimir experiments and\nmicro/nano electromechanical systems and in new devices for technological\napplications.\n", "  Complex optical networks containing one or more gain sections are\ninvestigated and the evidence of lasing action is reported; the emission\nspectrum reflects the topological disorder induced by the connections. A\ntheoretical description well compares with the measurements, mapping the\nnetworks to directed graphs and showing the analogies with the problem of\nquantum chaos on graphs. We show that the interplay of chaotic diffusion and\namplification leads to an emission statistics with characteristic heavy-tails:\nfor different topologies, an unprecedented experimental demonstration of Levy\nstatistics expected for random lasers is here provided for a continuous-wave\npumped system. This result is also supported by a Monte-Carlo simulation based\non ray random walk on the graph.\n", "  We developed a generic formalism to estimate the event rate and the redshift\ndistribution of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in our previous publication (Bera et\nal. 2016), considering FRBs are of an extragalactic origin. In this paper we\npresent (a) the predicted pulse widths of FRBs by considering two different\nscattering models, (b) the minimum total energy required to detect events, (c)\nthe redshift distribution and (d) the detection rates of FRBs for the Ooty Wide\nField Array (OWFA). The energy spectrum of FRBs is modelled as a power law with\nan exponent $-\\alpha$ and our analysis spans a range $-3\\leq \\alpha \\leq 5$. We\nfind that OWFA will be capable of detecting FRBs with $\\alpha\\geq 0$. The\nredshift distribution and the event rates of FRBs are estimated by assuming two\ndifferent energy distribution functions; a Delta function and a Schechter\nluminosity function with an exponent $-2\\le \\gamma \\le 2$. We consider an\nempirical scattering model based on pulsar observations (model I) as well as a\ntheoretical model (model II) expected for the intergalactic medium. The\nredshift distributions peak at a particular redshift $z_p$ for a fixed value of\n$\\alpha$, which lie in the range $0.3\\leq z_p \\leq 1$ for the scattering model\nI and remain flat and extend up to high redshifts ($z\\lesssim 5$) for the\nscattering model II.\n", "  Large eddy simulations (LES) are a powerful tool in understanding processes\nthat are inaccessible by direct simulations due to their complexity, for\nexample, in the highly turbulent regime. However, their accuracy and success\ndepends on a proper subgrid-scale (SGS) model that accounts for the unresolved\nscales in the simulation. We evaluate the applicability of two traditional SGS\nmodels, namely the eddy-viscosity (EV) and the scale-similarity (SS) model, and\none recently proposed nonlinear (NL) SGS model in the realm of compressible MHD\nturbulence. Using 209 simulations of decaying, supersonic (initial sonic Mach\nnumber of ~3) MHD turbulence with a shock-capturing scheme and varying\nresolution, SGS model and filter, we analyze the ensemble statistics of kinetic\nand magnetic energy spectra and structure functions. Furthermore, we compare\nthe temporal evolution of lower and higher order statistical moments of the\nspatial distributions of kinetic and magnetic energy, vorticity, current\ndensity, and dilatation magnitudes. We find no statistical influence on the\nevolution of the flow by any model if grid-scale quantities are used to\ncalculate SGS contributions. In addition, the SS models, which employ an\nexplicit filter, have no impact in general. On the contrary, both EV and NL\nmodels change the statistics if an explicit filter is used. For example, they\nslightly increase the dissipation on the smallest scales. We demonstrate that\nthe nonlinear model improves higher order statistics already with a small\nexplicit filter, i.e. a three-point stencil. The results of e.g. the structure\nfunctions or the skewness and kurtosis of the current density distribution are\ncloser to the ones obtained from simulations at higher resolution. We conclude\nthat the nonlinear model with a small explicit filter is suitable for\napplication in more complex scenarios when higher order statistics are\nimportant.\n", "  We present the discovery of 1847 Mira candidates in the Local Group galaxy\nM33 using a novel semi-parametric periodogram technique coupled with a Random\nForest classifier. The algorithms were applied to ~2.4x10^5 I-band light curves\npreviously obtained by the M33 Synoptic Stellar Survey. We derive preliminary\nPeriod-Luminosity relations at optical, near- & mid-infrared wavelengths and\ncompare them to the corresponding relations in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n", "  We present large-field (4.25~$\\times$~3.75 deg$^2$) mapping observations\ntoward the Galactic region centered at $l = 150\\arcdeg, b = 3.5\\arcdeg$ in the\n$J = 1-0$ emission line of CO isotopologues ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and\nC$^{18}$O), using the 13.7 m millimeter-wavelength telescope of the Purple\nMountain Observatory. Based on the $^{13}$CO observations, we reveal a\nfilamentary cloud in the Local Arm at a velocity range of $-$0.5 to\n6.5~km~s$^{-1}$. This molecular cloud contains 1 main filament and 11\nsub-filaments, showing the so-called \"ridge-nest\" structure. The main filament\nand three sub-filaments are also detected in the C$^{18}$O line. The velocity\nstructures of most identified filaments display continuous distribution with\nslight velocity gradients. The measured median excitation temperature, line\nwidth, length, width, and linear mass of the filaments are $\\sim$9.28~K,\n0.85~km~s$^{-1}$, 7.30~pc, 0.79~pc, and 17.92~$M_\\sun$~pc$^{-1}$, respectively,\nassuming a distance of 400~pc. We find that the four filaments detected in the\nC$^{18}$O line are thermally supercritical, and two of them are in the\nvirialized state, and thus tend to be gravitationally bound. We identify in\ntotal 146 $^{13}$CO clumps in the cloud, about 77$\\%$ of the clumps are\ndistributed along the filaments. About 56$\\%$ of the virialized clumps are\nfound to be associated with the supercritical filaments. Three young stellar\nobject (YSO) candidates are also identified in the supercritical filaments,\nbased on the complementary infrared (IR) data. These results indicate that the\nsupercritical filaments, especially the virialized filaments, may contain\nstar-forming activities.\n", "  Rashba spin orbit coupling in topological insulators has attracted much\ninterest due to its exotic properties closely related to spintronic devices.\nThe coexistence of nontrivial topology and giant Rashba splitting, however, has\nrare been observed in two-dimensional films, limiting severely its potential\napplications at room temperature. Here, we propose a series of inversion\nasymmetric group IV films, ABZ2, whose stability are confirmed by phonon\nspectrum calculations. The analyses of electronic structures reveal that they\nare intrinsic 2D TIs with a bulk gap as large as 0.74 eV, except for GeSiF2,\nSnSiCl2, GeSiCl2 and GeSiBr2 monolayers which can transform from normal to\ntopological phases under appropriate tensile strains. Another prominent\nintriguing feature is the giant Rashba spin splitting with a magnitude reaching\n0.15 eV, the largest value reported in 2D films. These results present a\nplatform to explore 2D TIs for room temperature device applications.\n", "  With the help of first principles calculation method based on the density\nfunctional theory we have investigated the structural, elastic, mechanical\nproperties and Debye temperature of Fe2ScM (M = P and As) compounds under\npressure up to 60 GPa. The optical properties have been investigated under zero\npressure. Our calculated optimized structural parameters of both the compounds\nare in good agreement with the other theoretical results. The calculated\nelastic constants show that Fe2ScM (M = P and As) compounds are mechanically\nstable up to 60 GPa.\n", "  Aqua MODIS, unlike its predecessor on board the Terra spacecraft, had always\nbeen thought to have been spared from significant deleterious impacts of\nelectronic crosstalk on its imagery. However, recent efforts brought to our\nattention the presence of striping artifacts in Aqua MODIS images from band 24\n(4.47$\\mu$m), which upon further inspection proved to have a noticeable impact\non the quality of the L1B product and to have been present since the beginning\nof the mission, in 2002. Using images of the Moon from scheduled lunar\nobservations, we linked the artifacts with electronic crosstalk contamination\nof the response of detector 1 of band 24 by signal sent from the detector 10 of\nband 26 (1.375$\\mu$m), a neighboring band in the same focal plane assembly. In\nthis paper, we report on these findings, the artifact mitigation strategy\nadopted by us, and on our success in restoring band 24 detector 1 behavior and\nimage quality.\n", "  Upon employing the analysis in a new time domain, termed natural time, it has\nbeen recently demonstrated that a remarkable change of seismicity emerges\nbefore major mainshocks in California. What constitutes this change is that the\nfluctuations of the order parameter of seismicity exhibit a clearly detectable\nminimum. This is identified by using a natural time window sliding event by\nevent through the time series of the earthquakes in a wide area and comprising\na number of events that would occur on the average within a few months or so.\nHere, we suggest a method to estimate the epicentral area of an impending\nmainshock by an additional study of this minimum using an area window sliding\nthrough the wide area. We find that when this area window surrounds (or is\nadjacent to) the future epicentral area, the minimum of the order parameter\nfluctuations in this area appears at a date very close to the one at which the\nminimum is observed in the wide area. The method is applied here to major\nearthquakes that occurred in California during the recent decades including the\nlargest one, i.e., the 1992 Landers earthquake.\n", "  Various theories have predicted the deep Dirac levels (DDLs) in atoms for\nmany years. However, the existence of the DDL is still under debating, and need\nto be confirmed experimentally. With the development of high intensive lasers,\nnowadays, electrons can been accelerated to relativistic energy by high\nintensive lasers, electron-positron pairs can be created, and nuclear reactions\ncan been ignited, which provide a new tool to explore the DDL related fields.\nIn this paper, we propose a new experimental method to study the DDL levels by\nmonitoring nuclei's orbital electron capture life time in plasma induced by\nhigh intensive lasers. If a DDL exists, a nuclear electron capture rate could\nbe enhanced by factor of over $10^7$, which makes it practically detectable in\nnowadays high intensive laser environments.\n", "  Nonlinear wave propagation is studied analytically in a dissipative,\nself-gravitating Bose Einstein condensate, in the framework of Gross-Pitaevskii\nmodel. The linear dispersion relation shows that the effect of dissipation is\nto suppress dynamical instabilities that destabilize the system. The small\namplitude analysis using reductive perturbation technique is found to yield a\nmodified form of KdV equation. The soliton energy, amplitude and velocity are\nfound to decay with time, whereas the soliton width increases, such that the\nsoliton exists for a finite time only\n", "  In this contribution I discuss a peak in Einstein's endeavor to extract as\nmuch information as possible about the nature of radiation from the Planck\ndistribution is his paper \"On the Quantum Theory of Radiation\" of 1916. This is\none of the most important contributions of Einstein to quantum theory.\n", "  Applying the approach based on the equation for the derivative, we construct\nseveral expansions of the solutions of the general Heun equation in terms of\nthe incomplete Beta functions. Several expansions in terms of the Appell\ngeneralized hypergeometric functions of two variables of the fist kind are also\npresented. The constructed expansions are applicable for arbitrary sets of the\ninvolved parameters. The coefficients of the expansions obey four-, five- or\nsix-term recurrence relations. However, there exist several sets of the\nparameters for which the recurrence relations involve fewer terms, not\nnecessarily successive. The conditions for deriving finite-sum solutions via\ntermination of the series are discussed.\n", "  Similarly to the cosmic star formation history, the black hole accretion rate\ndensity of the Universe peaked at 1<z<3. This cosmic epoch is hence best suited\nfor investigating the effects of radiative feedback from AGN. Observational\nefforts are underway to quantify the impact of AGN feedback, if any, on their\nhost galaxies. Here we present a study of the molecular gas content of AGN\nhosts at z~1.5 using CO[2-1] line emission observed with ALMA for a sample of\n10 AGNs. We compare this with a sample of galaxies without an AGN matched in\nredshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate. We detect CO in 3 AGNs with\n$\\mathrm{L_{CO} \\sim 6.3-25.1\\times 10^{9} L_{\\odot}}$ which translates to a\nmolecular hydrogen gas mass of $\\mathrm{2.5-10\\times 10^{10} M_{\\odot}}$\nassuming conventional conversion factor of $\\mathrm{\\alpha_{CO}}\\sim3.6$. Our\nresults indicate a >99% probability of lower depletion time scales and lower\nmolecular gas fractions in AGN hosts with respect to the non-AGN comparison\nsample. We discuss the implications of these observations on the impact that\nAGN feedback may have on star formation efficiency of z>1 galaxies.\n", "  We demonstrate the realization of (laterally) optically bounded colloidal\nstructures on a liquid-liquid interface of an emulsion droplet. We use DNA\ntethers to graft the particles to the droplet surface, effectively confining\nthem to a quasi-2D plane with minimum constraints on the lateral movement even\nwhen optically trapped in a common single-beam configuration. We show that\nrelatively weak interactions such as depletion can be measured in the optically\nbounded crystals by video-microscopy imaging and analysis. This illustrates the\npossible use of our system as template to study optically controlled quasi\ntwo-dimensional colloidal assembly on liquid-liquid interfaces.\n", "  A comparison of the performance of high resolution lithographic tools is\npresented here. We use extreme ultraviolet interference lithography, electron\nbeam lithography, and He ion beam lithography tools on two different resists\nthat are processed under the same conditions. The dose-to-clear and the\nlithographic contrast are determined experimentally and are used to compare the\nrelative efficiency of each tool. The results are compared to previous studies\nand interpreted in the light of each tool-specific secondary electron yield. In\naddition, the patterning performance is studied by exposing dense line/spaces\npatterns and the relation between critical dimension and exposure dose is\ndiscussed. Finally, the Lumped Parameter Model is employed in order to\nquantitatively estimate the critical dimension of line/spaces, using each tool\nspecific aerial image. Our implementation is then validated by fitting the\nmodel to the experimental data from interference lithography exposures, and\nextracting the resist contrast.\n", "  In the present work we analyze some necessary conditions for ignition of\nsolid energetic materials by low velocity impact ignition mechanism. Basing on\nreported results of {\\it ab initio} computations we assume that the energetic\nactivation barriers for the primary endothermic dissociation in some energetic\nmaterials may be locally lowered due to the effect of shear strain caused by\nthe impact. We show that the ignition may be initiated in regions with the\nreduced activation barriers, even at moderately low exothermicity of the\nsubsequent exothermic reactions thus suggesting that the above regions may\nserve as \"hot spots\" for the ignition. We apply our results to analyze initial\nsteps of ignition in DADNE and TATB molecular crystals.\n", "  An unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method is developed to provide\nfast calculations of biological and bio-inspired self-propelled locomotion. The\napproach uniquely combines an unsteady three-dimensional boundary element\nmethod, a boundary layer solver and self-propelled equations of motion. This\nnovel implementation allows for the self-propelled speed, power, efficiency and\neconomy to be accurately calculated. A Dirichlet formulation is used with a\ncombination of constant strength source and doublet elements to represent a\ndeforming body with a nonlinearly deforming wake. The wake elements are\ndesingularized to numerically stabilize the evolution of the wake vorticity.\nWeak coupling is used in solving the equations of motion and in the boundary\nlayer solution. The boundary layer solver models both laminar and turbulent\nbehavior along the deforming body to estimate the total skin friction drag\nacting on the body. The results from the method are validated with analytical\nsolutions, computations and experiments. Finally, a bio-inspired self-propelled\nundulatory fin is modeled. The computed self-propelled speeds and wake\nstructures agree well with previous experiments. The computations go beyond the\nexperiments to gain further insight into the propulsive efficiency for\nself-propelled undulating fins. It is found that the undulating fin produces a\ntime-averaged momentum jet at 76% of the span that accelerates fluid in the\nstreamwise direction and in turn generates thrust. Additionally, it is\ndiscovered that high amplitude motions suppress the formation of a bifurcating\nmomentum jet and instead form a single core jet. Consequently, this maximizes\nthe amount of streamwise momentum compared to the amount of wasted lateral\nmomentum and leads to a propulsive efficiency of 78% during self-propelled\nlocomotion.\n", "  The ($^{11}$B,$^{11}$Li) double charge-exchange reaction (DCER) at\n$E(^{11}$B)/$A$=80 MeV was measured for the first time to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the reaction for studying neutrino nuclear responses for double\nbeta decays (DBD). The $^{13}$C($^{11}$B,$^{11}$Li)$^{13}$O reaction shows\nstrengths at the ground state and low and high excitation giant resonance\nregions. The $^{56}$Fe ($^{11}$B,$^{11}$Li) $^{56}$Ni reaction shows the large\nstrengths in the possible double giant resonance region and beyond, but shows\nno strengths in the low excitation region below 5 MeV, suggesting strong\nconcentration of the DBD strength at the high excitation region. The DCER is\nused to evaluate the spin isospin strengths relevant to DBD responses.\n", "  Here we demonstrate the gas sensing ability of cavity-coupled metallic\nnanoparticle systems, comprising gold nanoparticles separated from a gold\nmirror with a polymer spacer. An increase in relative humidity (RH) causes the\nspacer to expand, which induces a significant reduction of nanoparticle\nscattering intensity, as the scattering is highly dependent on the\ncavity-nanoparticle coupling that closely relates to the nanoparticle-mirror\ndistance. This lithography-free structure enables a remarkable averaging\nsensitivity at 0.12 dB/% RH and 0.25 dB/% RH over RH range (45-75%), possessing\nan estimated resolution better than 0.5% RH with full reversibility and almost\nzero-hysteresis, exhibiting notable gas sensing potentials.\n", "  We present a nonlocal electrostatic formulation of nonuniform ions and water\nmolecules with interstitial voids that uses a Fermi-like distribution to\naccount for steric and correlation effects in electrolyte solutions. The\nformulation is based on the volume exclusion of hard spheres leading to a\nsteric potential and Maxwell's displacement field with Yukawa-type interactions\nresulting in a nonlocal electric potential. The classical Poisson-Boltzmann\nmodel fails to describe steric and correlation effects important in a variety\nof chemical and biological systems, especially in high field or large\nconcentration conditions found in and near binding sites, ion channels, and\nelectrodes. Steric effects and correlations are apparent when we compare\nnonlocal Poisson-Fermi results to Poisson-Boltzmann calculations in electric\ndouble layer and to experimental measurements on the selectivity of potassium\nchannels for K+ over Na+. The present theory links atomic scale descriptions of\nthe crystallized KcsA channel with macroscopic bulk conditions. Atomic\nstructures and macroscopic conditions determine complex functions of great\nimportance in biology, nanotechnology, and electrochemistry.\n", "  Dynamical networks are important models for the behaviour of complex systems,\nmodelling physical, biological and societal systems, including the brain, food\nwebs, epidemic disease in populations, power grids and many other. Such\ndynamical networks can exhibit behaviour in which deterministic chaos,\nexhibiting unpredictability and disorder, coexists with synchronization, a\nclassical paradigm of order. We survey the main theory behind complete,\ngeneralized and phase synchronization phenomena in simple as well as complex\nnetworks and discuss applications to secure communications, parameter\nestimation and the anticipation of chaos.\n", "  We present a class of minimal $U(1)_X$ models as a plausible solution to the\n$R_K$ anomaly that can also help reproduce the neutrino mixing pattern. The\nsymmetries and the corresponding $X$-charges of the fields are determined in a\nbottom-up approach demanding both theoretical and experimental consistencies.\nThe breaking of $U(1)_X$ symmetry results in a massive $Z^{\\prime}$, whose\ncouplings with leptons and quarks are necessarily non-universal to address the\n$R_K$ anomaly. In the process, an additional Higgs doublet is introduced to\ngenerate quark mixings. The mixings in the neutrino sector are generated\nthrough Type-I seesaw mechanism by the addition of three right handed neutrinos\nand a scalar singlet. The $Z^{\\prime}$ can be probed with a few hundred\nfb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity at the 13 TeV LHC in the di-muon channel.\n", "  We calculated the polarization degree of hydrogen Balmer broad emission lines\nfrom a number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with determined virial factors.\nThe objects were selected from the sample presented by Decarli et al.(2008). In\nour calculations, we used the model of the flattened disc-like structure of the\nbroad-line emission region (BLR). In this model, the expression for the virial\nfactor makes it possible to determine the inclination angle for the flattened\nBLR, which in turn yields the polarization degree of the broad emission lines.\nAs a result, we obtained the direct relation between the polarization degree\nand the virial factor. We also compared the determined values of the\npolarization degree with those obtained in polarimetric observations.\n", "  We propose a simple modification of the no-scale supergravity Wess-Zumino\nmodel of Starobinsky-like inflation to include a Polonyi term in the\nsuperpotential. The purpose of this term is to provide an explicit mechanism\nfor supersymmetry breaking at the end of inflation. We show how successful\ninflation can be achieved for a gravitino mass satisfying the strict upper\nbound $m_{3/2}< 10^3$ TeV, with favoured values $m_{3/2}\\lesssim\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nTeV. The model suggests that SUSY may be discovered in collider physics\nexperiments such as the LHC or the FCC.\n", "  In this thesis we study properties of open quantum dissipative evolutions of\nspin systems on lattices described by Lindblad generators, in a particular\nregime that we denote rapid mixing. We consider dissipative evolutions with a\nunique fixed point, and which compress the whole space of input states into\nincreasingly small neighborhoods of the fixed point. The time scale at which\nthis compression takes place, or in other words the time we have to wait for\nany input state to become almost indistinguishable from the fixed point, is\ncalled the mixing time of the process. Rapid mixing is a condition on the\nscaling of this mixing time with the system size: if it is logarithmic, then we\nhave rapid mixing.\n  The main contribution of this thesis is to show that rapid mixing has\nprofound implications for the corresponding system: it is stable against\nexternal perturbations and its fixed point satisfies an area law for mutual\ninformation.\n", "  We present a spin-rotation-invariant Green-function theory for the dynamic\nspin susceptibility in the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a\nstacked honeycomb lattice. Employing a generalized mean-field approximation for\narbitrary temperatures, the thermodynamic quantities (two-spin correlation\nfunctions, internal energy, magnetic susceptibility, staggered magnetization,\nN'eel temperature, correlation length) and the spin-excitation spectrum are\ncalculated by solving a coupled system of self-consistency equations for the\ncorrelation functions. The temperature dependence of the magnetic (uniform\nstatic) susceptibility is ascribed to antiferromagnetic short-range order. The\nN\\'{e}el temperature is calculated for arbitrary interlayer couplings. Our\nresults are in a good agreement with numerical computations for finite clusters\nand with available experimental data on the \\beta-Cu2V2O2 compound.\n", "  Besides having unique electronic properties, graphene is claimed to be the\nstrongest material in nature. In the press release of the Nobel committee it is\nclaimed that a hammock made of a squared meter of one-atom thick graphene could\nsustain the wight of a 4 kg cat. More practically important are applications of\ngraphene like scaffolds and sensors which are crucially dependent on the\nmechanical strength. Meter-sized graphene is even being considered for the\nlightsails in the starshot project to reach the star alpha centaury. The\npredicted strength of graphene is based on its very large Young modulus which\nis, per atomic layer, much larger than that of steel. This reasoning however\nwould apply to conventional thin plates but does not take into account the\npeculiar properties of graphene as a thermally fluctuating crystalline\nmembrane. It was shown recently both experimentally and theoretically that\nthermal fluctuations lead to a dramatic reduction of the Young modulus and\nincrease of the bending rigidity for micron-sized graphene samples in\ncomparison with atomic scale values. This makes the use of the standard\nF\\\"oppl-von Karman elasticity (FvK) theory for thin plates not directly\napplicable to graphene and other single atomic layer membranes. This fact is\nimportant because the current interpretation of experimental results is based\non the FvK theory. In particular, we show that the FvK-derived Schwerin\nequation, routinely used to derive the Young modulus from indentation\nexperiments has to be essentially modified for graphene at room temperature and\nfor micron sized samples. Based on scaling analysis and atomistic simulation we\ninvestigate the mechanics of graphene under transverse load up to breaking. We\ndetermine the limits of applicability of the FvK theory and provide\nquantitative estimates for the different regimes.\n", "  Superconductor/ferromagnet proximity effect has been studied for\nPb/Co$_2$Cr$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Al bilayers. Different substrate temperatures allowed\nus to prepare the Heusler alloy Co$_2$Cr$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Al films with different\ndegree of spin polarization of conduction band of the Heusler layer. We obtain\na strong correlation between the dependence of the superconducting transition\ntemperature on the Pb-layer thickness at fixed thickness of the Heusler layer\nand the degree of spin polarization in the ferromagnetic layer.\n", "  A novel effective Hamiltonian in the subspace of singly occupied states is\nobtained by applying the Gutzwiller projection approach to a generalized\nHubbard model with the interactions between two nearest- neighbor sites. This\nmodel provides a more complete description of the physics of strongly\ncorrelated electron systems. The system is not necessarily in a ferromagnetic\nstate as temperature approaches zero at any doping level. The system, however,\nmust be in an antiferromagnetic state at the origin of the doping-temperature\nplane. Moreover, the model exhibits superconductivity in a doped region at\nsufficiently low temperatures. We summarize the studies and provide a phase\ndiagram of the antiferromagnetism and the superconductivity of the model in the\ndoping-temperature plane here. Details will be presented in subsequent papers.\n", "  We present a list of formulae useful for Weyl-Heisenberg integral\nquantizations, with arbitrary weight, of functions or distributions on the\nplane. Most of these formulae are known, others are original. The list\nencompasses particular cases like Weyl-Wigner quantization (constant weight)\nand coherent states (CS) or Berezin quantization (Gaussian weight). The\nformulae are given with implicit assumptions on their validity on appropriate\nspace(s) of functions (or distributions). One of the aims of the document is to\naccompany a work in progress on Weyl-Heisenberg integral quantization of\ndynamics for the motion of a point particle on the line.\n", "  The Maslov index in the semiclassical Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule is\ncalculated for one-dimensional power-law potentials. The result for the inverse\nsquare root potential is compared with the recently reported exact solution.\nThe case of a spherically symmetric power-law potential is also considered.\n", "  Near all-sky imaging photometry was performed from a boat on the Gulf of\nAqaba to measure the night sky brightness in a coastal environment. The boat\nwas not anchored, and therefore drifted and rocked. The camera was mounted on a\ntripod without any inertia/motion stabilization. A commercial digital single\nlens reflex (DSLR) camera and fisheye lens were used with ISO setting of 6400,\nwith the exposure time varied between 0.5 s and 5 s. We find that despite\nmovement of the vessel the measurements produce quantitatively comparable\nresults apart from saturation effects. We discuss the potential and limitations\nof this method for mapping light pollution in marine and freshwater systems.\nThis work represents the proof of concept that all-sky photometry with a\ncommercial DSLR camera is a viable tool to determine light pollution in an\necological context from a moving boat.\n", "  Optical technologies call for waveguide networks featuring high integration\ndensities, low losses, and simple operation. Here, we present polymer\nwaveguides fabricated from a negative tone photoresist via\ntwo-photon-lithography in direct laser writing, and show a detailed parameter\nstudy of their performance. Specifically, we produce waveguides featuring bend\nradii down to 40 {\\mu}m, insertion losses of the order of 10 dB, and loss\ncoefficients smaller than 0.81 dB/mm, facilitating high integration densities\nin writing fields of 300 {\\mu}m x 300 {\\mu}m. A novel three-dimensional coupler\ndesign allows for coupling control as well as direct observation of outputs in\na single field of view through a microscope objective. Finally, we present\nbeam-splitting devices to construct larger optical networks, and we show that\nthe waveguide material is compatible with the integration of quantum emitters.\n", "  Geophysical model domains typically contain irregular, complex fractal-like\nboundaries and physical processes that act over a wide range of scales.\nConstructing geographically constrained boundary-conforming spatial\ndiscretizations of these domains with flexible use of anisotropically, fully\nunstructured meshes is a challenge. The problem contains a wide range of scales\nand a relatively large, heterogeneous constraint parameter space. Approaches\nare commonly ad hoc, model or application specific and insufficiently\ndescribed. Development of new spatial domains is frequently time-consuming,\nhard to repeat, error prone and difficult to ensure consistent due to the\nsignificant human input required. As a consequence, it is difficult to\nreproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data handling and\ninitialization, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons rigorously.\nMoreover, for flexible unstructured meshes, there is additionally a greater\npotential for inconsistencies in model initialization and forcing parameters.\nThis paper introduces a consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for\ngeophysical models, that is automated, quick-to-draft and repeat, and provides\na rigorous and robust approach that is consistent to the source data\nthroughout. The approach is enabling further new research in complex\nmulti-scale domains, difficult or not possible to achieve with existing\nmethods. Examples being actively pursued in a range of geophysical modeling\nefforts are presented alongside the approach, together with the implementation\nlibrary Shingle and a selection of its verification test cases.\n", "  In this paper we study the integrability of 3-d Bohmian trajectories of a\nsystem of quantum harmonic oscillators. We show that the initial choice of\nquantum numbers is responsible for the existence (or not) of an integral of\nmotion which confines the trajectories on certain invariant surfaces. We give a\nfew examples of orbits in cases where there is or there is not an integral and\nmake some comments on the impact of partial integrability in Bohmian Mechanics.\nFinally, we make a connection between our present results for the integrability\nin the 3-d case and analogous results found in the 2-d and 4-d cases.\n", "  The effect of a q-deformation of flavor symmetry on octet baryon magnetic\nmoments is investigated by taking the quantum group Uq(su(3)) as a flavor\nsymmetry and calculating expressions for the magnetic moments of the octet\nbaryons. Using the experimental values for the magnetic moments of the proton,\nneutron, and Lambda baryons as input, the magnetic moments of the up, down, and\nstrange quarks, and by extension those of the remaining octet baryons, depend\non the value of the deformation parameter q. Plotting the least square error as\na function of q we find the undeformed value q=1 is a local maximum. Nearby are\na relative minimum (at q=0.610) and an absolute minimum (at q=1.774). The value\nq=1.774 gives an approximately 10% decrease in the least square error compared\nto the undeformed case. For this value of q the quark masses of the up and down\nquarks are calculated to be 331 MeV and 305 MeV respectively.\n", "  The approaches taken to describe and develop spatial discretisations of the\ndomains required for geophysical simulation models are commonly ad hoc, model\nor application specific and under-documented. This is particularly acute for\nsimulation models that are flexible in their use of multi-scale, anisotropic,\nfully unstructured meshes where a relatively large number of heterogeneous\nparameters are required to constrain their full description. As a consequence,\nit can be difficult to reproduce simulations, ensure a provenance in model data\nhandling and initialisation, and a challenge to conduct model intercomparisons\nrigorously. This paper takes a novel approach to spatial discretisation,\nconsidering it much like a numerical simulation model problem of its own. It\nintroduces a generalised, extensible, self-documenting approach to carefully\ndescribe, and necessarily fully, the constraints over the heterogeneous\nparameter space that determine how a domain is spatially discretised. This\nadditionally provides a method to accurately record these constraints, using\nhigh-level natural language based abstractions, that enables full accounts of\nprovenance, sharing and distribution. Together with this description, a\ngeneralised consistent approach to unstructured mesh generation for geophysical\nmodels is developed, that is automated, robust and repeatable, quick-to-draft,\nrigorously verified and consistent to the source data throughout. This\ninterprets the description above to execute a self-consistent spatial\ndiscretisation process, which is automatically validated to expected discrete\ncharacteristics and metrics.\n", "  We give an arguably simpler and more direct proof of a recent result by\nMiller, Jain and Shi, who proved device-independent security of a protocol for\nquantum key distribution in which the devices can be used in parallel. Our\nproof combines existing results on immunization (Kempe et al., SICOMP 2011) and\nparallel repetition (Bavarian et al., STOC 2017) of entangled games.\n", "  Superconducting micro- and nanohelices are proposed for the first time. A\ntheoretical investigation of the superconducting state in the helical coils at\nthe micro- and nanoscale is performed within the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\napproach. The pattern and number of vortices in a stationary distribution are\ndetermined by their confinement to the ultrathin helical spiral and can\ntherefore be efficiently controlled by the helical stripe width and the helical\npitch distance for both dense and sparse helices. Quasi-degeneracy of vortex\npatterns is manifested in the helical spiral when the number of vortices is\nincommensurable with the total number of half-turns. With increasing radius,\nsuperconducting helical spirals provide a physical realization of a transition\nfrom the vortex pattern peculiar to an open tube to that of a planar stripe.\n", "  Strong inter-particle interactions between polaritons have traditionally\nstemmed from their exciton component. In this work, we impart a strong photonic\nnonlinearity to a polaritonic mode by embedding a nonlinear polymethine dye\nwithin a high-Q all-metal microcavity. We demonstrate nonlinear microcavities\noperating in the ultrastrong coupling regime with a normalized coupling ratio\nof 62\\%, the highest reported to date. When pumping the lower polariton branch,\nwe observe tunable third-harmonic generation spanning the entire visible\nspectrum, with internal conversion enhancements more than three orders of\nmagnitude larger than in bare films. Transfer matrix calculations indicate that\nthe observed enhancements are consistent with the enhanced pump electric field.\n", "  We show from density-functional calculations that Pb(100) thin films exhibit\nquantum size effect with a bilayer periodicity in film energies, film\nrelaxations, and work functions, which originate from different symmetry of the\nstacking geometry of odd and even layer films. The bilayer periodicity of the\nfilm energy is argued to survive on a semiconductor substrate, which should\nallow the growth of ``magically'' thick even-layer Pb(100) films. Furthermore,\nit is found that the quantum well states in a simple metal film can be\nclassified into $\\sigma$-bonded and $\\pi$-bonded states, which quantize\nindependently.\n"]}
