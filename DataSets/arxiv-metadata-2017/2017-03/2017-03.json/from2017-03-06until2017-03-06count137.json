For\nmacroscopic systems at equilibrium, the osmotic pressure is given by the\nclassical van't Hoff Law, which states that the pressure is proportional to the\nproduct of the temperature and the difference of the solute concentrations\ninside and outside the chamber. For microscopic systems the diameter of the\nchamber may be comparable to the length-scale associated with the solute-wall\ninteractions or solute molecular interactions. In each of these cases, the\nassumptions underlying the classical van't Hoff Law may no longer hold. In this\npaper we develop a general theoretical framework which captures corrections to\nthe classical theory for the osmotic pressure under more general relationships\nbetween the size of the chamber and the interaction length scales. We also show\nthat notions of osmotic pressure based on the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid\nand the mechanical pressure on the bounding walls of the chamber must be\ndistinguished for microscopic systems. To demonstrate how the theoretical\nframework can be applied, numerical results are presented for the osmotic\npressure associated with a polymer of N monomers confined in a spherical\nchamber as the bond strength is varied.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ sigma models with the CP(1)\ntarget space. A minimal model of this type has one left-handed fermion.\nNonminimal extensions contain, in addition, $N_f$ right-handed fermions. Our\ntask is to derive expressions for the $\\beta$ functions valid to all orders. To\nthis end we use a variety of methods: (i) perturbative analysis; (ii) instanton\ncalculus; (iii) analysis of the supercurrent supermultiplet (the so-called\nhypercurrent) and its anomalies, and some other arguments. All these arguments,\ncombined, indicate a direct parallel between the heterotic $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$\nCP(1) models and four-dimensional super-Yang-Mills theories. In particular, the\nminimal $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ CP(1) model is similar to ${\\mathcal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric gluodynamics. Its exact $\\beta$ function can be found; it has\nthe structure of the Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov (NSVZ) $\\beta$\nfunction of supersymmetric gluodynamics. The passage to nonminimal\n$\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ sigma models is equivalent to adding matter. In this case\nan NSVZ-type exact relation between the $\\beta$ function and the anomalous\ndimensions $\\gamma$ of the \"matter\" fields is established. We derive an analog\nof the Konishi anomaly. At large $N_f$ our $\\beta$ function develops an\ninfrared fixed point at small values of the coupling constant (analogous to the\nBanks-Zaks fixed point). Thus, we reliably predict the existence of a conformal\nwindow. At $N_f=1$ the model under consideration reduces to the well-known\n$\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ CP(1) model.\n", "  According to the Gottesman-Knill theorem, quantum algorithms which utilise\nonly the operations belonging to a certain restricted set are efficiently\nsimulable classically. Since some of the operations in this set generate\nentangled states, it is commonly concluded that entanglement is insufficient to\nenable quantum computers to outperform classical computers. I argue in this\npaper that this conclusion is misleading. First, the statement of the theorem\n(that the particular set of quantum operations in question can be simulated\nusing a classical computer) is, on reflection, already evident when we consider\nBell's and related inequalities in the context of a discussion of computational\nmachines. This, in turn, helps us to understand that the appropriate conclusion\nto draw from the Gottesman-Knill theorem is not that entanglement is\ninsufficient to enable a quantum performance advantage, but rather that if we\nlimit ourselves to the operations referred to in the Gottesman-Knill theorem,\nwe will not have used the resources provided by an entangled quantum system to\ntheir full potential.\n", "  Instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP) computation is a class of quantum\ncomputation consisting only of commuting two-qubit gates and is not universal\nin the sense of standard quantum computation. Nevertheless, it has been shown\nthat if there is a classical algorithm that can simulate IQP efficiently, the\npolynomial hierarchy (PH) collapses at the third level, which is highly\nimplausible. However, the origin of the classical intractability is still less\nunderstood. Here we establish a relationship between IQP and computational\ncomplexity of the partition functions of Ising models. We apply the established\nrelationship in two opposite directions. One direction is to find subclasses of\nIQP that are classically efficiently simulatable in the strong sense, by using\nexact solvability of certain types of Ising models. Another direction is\napplying quantum computational complexity of IQP to investigate (im)possibility\nof efficient classical approximations of Ising models with imaginary coupling\nconstants. Specifically, we show that there is no fully polynomial randomized\napproximation scheme (FPRAS) for Ising models with almost all imaginary\ncoupling constants even on a planar graph of a bounded degree, unless the PH\ncollapses at the third level. Furthermore, we also show a multiplicative\napproximation of such a class of Ising partition functions is at least as hard\nas a multiplicative approximation for the output distribution of an arbitrary\nquantum circuit.\n", "  We consider rotationally symmetric spaces with low regularity, which we\nregard as integral currents spaces or manifolds with Sobolev regularity and are\nassumed to have nonnegative scalar curvature. Relying on the flat distance and\non Sobolev norms, we establish several nonlinear stability estimates about the\n``distance'' between a rotationally symmetric manifold and the Euclidian space,\nwhich are stated in terms of the ADM mass of the manifold. Importantly, we make\nexplicit the dependencies and scales involved in this problem, particularly the\nADM mass, the depth, and the CMC reference hypersurface. Several notions of\nindependent interest are introduced in the course of our analysis, including\nthe notion of depth of a manifold and a scaled version of the flat-distance,\nthe D-flat distance as we call it, which involves the diameter of the manifold.\nFinally we prove a compactness theorem for sequences of regions with uniformly\nbounded depth, whose outer boundaries have fixed area and an upper bound on\nHawking mass.\n", "  We study a class of loop-quantum-gravity states characterized by\n(ultra-local) thermal correlations that reproduce some features of the\nultraviolet structure of the perturbative quantum field theory vacuum. In\nparticular, they satisfy an analog of the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. These\nstates are peaked on the intrinsic geometry and admit a semiclassical\ninterpretation. We study how the correlations extend on the spin-network beyond\nthe ultra local limit.\n", "  Topological band structures in electronic systems like topological insulators\nand semimetals give rise to highly unusual physical properties. Analogous\ntopological effects have also been discussed in bosonic systems, but the novel\nphenomena typically occur only when the system is excited by finite-frequency\nprobes. A mapping recently proposed by Kane and Lubensky [Nat. Phys. 10, 39\n(2014)], however, establishes a closer correspondence. It relates the\nzero-frequency excitations of mechanical systems to topological zero modes of\nfermions that appear at the edges of an otherwise gapped system. Here we\ngeneralize the mapping to systems with an intrinsically gapless bulk. In\nparticular, we construct mechanical counterparts of topological semimetals. The\nresulting gapless bulk modes are physically distinct from the usual acoustic\nGoldstone phonons, and appear even in the absence of continuous translation\ninvariance. Moreover, the zero-frequency phonon modes feature adjustable\nmomenta and are topologically protected as long as the lattice coordination is\nunchanged. Such protected soft modes with tunable wavevector may be useful in\ndesigning mechanical structures with fault-tolerant properties.\n", "  MacKey constructed a set of induced representation character formulas to\ncalculate the sum of different powers of the eigenvalues of a matrix with\nfinite group symmetry. We show that these results of MacKey can be used to\nderive the stability condition, m > Cn3, of Maxwell using his symmetric model\nfor a ring of Saturn, as a collection of n identical unit mass particles\nrevolving round Saturn, which has mass m, in a circular orbit.\n", "  In the preceding work \\cite{watanabe3}, it is shown that the solution to the\nBCS gap equation for superconductivity is continuous with respect to both the\ntemperature and the energy under the restriction that the temperature is very\nsmall. Without this restriction, we show in this paper that the solution is\ncontinuous with respect to both the temperature and the energy, and that the\nsolution is Lipschitz continuous and monotonically decreasing with respect to\nthe temperature.\n", "  The leading asymptotic large-scale behaviour of the spatially bipartite\nentanglement entropy (EE) of the free Fermi gas infinitely extended in\nmultidimensional Euclidean space at zero absolute temperature, T=0, is by now\nwell understood. Here, we present and discuss the first rigorous results for\nthe corresponding EE of thermal equilibrium states at T>0. The leading\nlarge-scale term of this thermal EE turns out to be twice the first-order\nfinite-size correction to the infinite-volume thermal entropy (density). Not\nsurprisingly, this correction is just the thermal entropy on the interface of\nthe bipartition. However, it is given by a rather complicated integral derived\nfrom a semiclassical trace formula for a certain operator on the underlying\none-particle Hilbert space. But in the zero-temperature limit the leading\nlarge-scale term of the thermal EE considerably simplifies and displays a\nln(1/T)-singularity which one may identify with the known logarithmic\nenhancement at T=0 of the so-called area-law scaling.\n", "  The measured fluxes of secondary particles produced by the interactions of\ncosmic rays with the astronomical environment represent a powerful tool to\ninfer some properties of primary cosmic rays. In this work we investigate the\nproduction of secondary particles in inelastic hadronic interactions between\nseveral cosmic rays species of projectiles and different target nuclei of the\ninterstellar medium. The yields of secondary particles have been calculated\nwith the FLUKA simulation package, that provides with very good accuracy the\nenergy distributions of secondary products in a large energy range. An\napplication to the propagation and production of secondaries in the Galaxy is\npresented.\n", "  Many problems in science and engineering involve, as part of their solution\nprocess, the consideration of a separable function which is the sum of two\nconvex functions, one of them possibly non-smooth. Recently a few works have\ndiscussed inexact versions of several accelerated proximal methods aiming at\nsolving this minimization problem. This paper shows that inexact versions of a\nmethod of Beck and Teboulle (FISTA) preserve, in a Hilbert space setting, the\nsame (non-asymptotic) rate of convergence under some assumptions on the decay\nrate of the error terms. The notion of inexactness discussed here seems to be\nrather simple, but, interestingly, when comparing to related works, closely\nrelated decay rates of the errors terms yield closely related convergence\nrates. The derivation sheds some light on the somewhat mysterious origin of\nsome parameters which appear in various accelerated methods. A consequence of\nthe analysis is that the accelerated method is perturbation resilient, making\nit suitable, in principle, for the superiorization methodology. By taking this\ninto account, we re-examine the superiorization methodology and significantly\nextend its scope.\n", "  We study the electronic spin relaxation effect in the hole-doped monolayer\nand bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides in the presence of the crystal\ndefects. We consider realistic models of the lattice vacancy and actually\nestimate the spin relaxation rate using the multi-orbital tight-binding model.\nIn the monolayer, the spin-relaxation time is found to be extremely long\ncompared to the momentum relaxation time, and this is attributed to the fact\nthat the spin hybridization in the band structure is suppressed by the mirror\nreflection symmetry. The bilayer TMD has a much shorter spin relaxation time in\ncontrast, and this is attributed to stronger spin hybridization due to the\nabsence of the mirror symmetry.\n", "  Quantitative bibliometric indicators are widely used to evaluate the\nperformance of scientists. However, traditional indicators do not much rely on\nthe analysis of the processes intended to measure and the practical goals of\nthe measurement. In this study, I propose a simple framework to measure and\npredict an individual researcher's scientific performance that takes into\naccount the main regularities of publication and citation processes and the\nrequirements of practical tasks. Statistical properties of the new indicator -\na scientist's personal impact rate - are illustrated by its application to a\nsample of Estonian researchers.\n", "  The measured fluxes of secondary particles produced by the interactions of\nCosmic Rays (CRs) with the astronomical environment play a crucial role in\nunderstanding the physics of CR transport. In this work we present a\ncomprehensive calculation of the secondary hadron, lepton, gamma-ray and\nneutrino yields produced by the inelastic interactions between several species\nof stable or long-lived cosmic rays projectiles (p, D, T, 3He, 4He, 6Li, 7Li,\n9Be, 10Be, 10B, 11B, 12C, 13C, 14C, 14N, 15N, 16O, 17O, 18O, 20Ne, 24Mg and\n28Si) and different target gas nuclei (p, 4He, 12C, 14N, 16O, 20Ne, 24Mg, 28Si\nand 40Ar). The yields are calculated using FLUKA, a simulation package designed\nto compute the energy distributions of secondary products with large accuracy\nin a wide energy range. The present results provide, for the first time, a\ncomplete and self-consistent set of all the relevant inclusive cross sections\nregarding the whole spectrum of secondary products in nuclear collisions. We\ncover, for the projectiles, a kinetic energy range extending from $0.1 GeV/n$\nup to $100 TeV/n$ in the lab frame. In order to show the importance of our\nresults for multi-messenger studies about the physics of CR propagation, we\nevaluate the propagated spectra of Galactic secondary nuclei, leptons, and\ngamma rays produced by the interactions of CRs with the insterstellar gas,\nexploiting the numerical codes DRAGON and GammaSky. We show that, adopting our\ncross section database, we are able to provide a good fit of a complete sample\nof CR observables, including: leptonic and hadronic spectra measured at Earth,\nthe local interstellar spectra measured by Voyager, and the gamma-ray\nemissivities from Fermi-LAT collaboration. We also show a set of gamma-ray and\nneutrino full-sky maps and spectra.\n", "  Generating appropriate tiny neutrino masses via inverse seesaw mechanism\nwithin the framework of a particular SU(3)xSU(4)xU(1) gauge model is the main\noutcome of this letter. It is achieved by simply adding three singlet exotic\nMajorana neutrinos to the usual ones included in the three lepton quadruplet\nrepresentations. The theoretical device of treating gauge models with high\nsymmetries is the general method by Cotaescu. It provides us with a unique free\nparameter (a) to be tuned in order to get a realistic mass spectrum for the\ngauge bosons and charged fermions in the model. The overall breaking scale can\nbe set around 1-10 TeV so its phenomenology is quite testable at present\nfacilities.\n", "  We theoretically investigate coherent optical excitations of collective modes\nin two-band BCS superconductors, which accommodate two Higgs modes and one\nLeggett mode corresponding, respectively, to the amplitude and relative-phase\noscillations of the superconducting order parameters associated with the two\nbands. We find, based on a mean-field analysis, that each collective mode can\nbe resonantly excited through a nonlinear light-matter coupling when the\ndoubled frequency of the driving field coincides with the frequency of the\ncorresponding mode. Among the two Higgs modes, the higher-energy one exhibits a\nsharp resonance with light, while the lower-energy mode has a broadened\nresonance width. The Leggett mode is found to be resonantly induced by a\nhomogeneous ac electric field because the leading nonlinear effect generates a\npotential offset between the two bands that couples to the relative phase of\nthe order parameters. The resonance for the Leggett mode becomes sharper with\nincreasing temperature. All of these light-induced collective modes along with\ndensity fluctuations contribute to the third-harmonic generation. We also\npredict an experimental possibility of optical detection of the Leggett mode.\n", "  Stochastic chains represent a wide and key variety of phenomena in many\nbranches of science within the context of Information Theory and\nThermodynamics. They are typically approached by a sequence of independent\nevents or by a memoryless Markov process. Here, we demonstrate that when memory\nis introduced, the statistics of the system depends on the mechanism by which\nobjects or symbols are assembled, even in the slow dynamics limit wherein\nfriction can be neglected. To analyse these systems, we introduce a\nsequence-dependent partition function, investigate its properties and compare\nit to the standard normalization defined by the statistical physics of\nensembles. Then, we study the behaviour of the entropy and the internal energy\nin this intrinsic, directional chains finding that they vary around their\nthermally-induced equilibrium analogues due to memory effects. We anticipate\nthat our results are necessary to interpret configurational order and\ninformation transfer in many molecular systems within Materials Science,\nBiophysics, Communication and Engineering.\n", "  We determine the wave front sets of solutions to two special cases of the\nCauchy problem for the space-time fractional Zener wave equation, one being\nfractional in space, the other being fractional in time. For the case of the\nspace fractional wave equation, we show that no spatial propagation of\nsingularities occurs. For the time fractional Zener wave equation, we show an\nanalogue of non-characteristic regularity.\n", "  We present a theoretical study on the electronic, dynamical, and\nphotocatalytic properties of single-layer ReS$_2$ under uniaxial and shear\nstrains. The single-layer ReS$_2$ shows strong anisotropic responses to\nstraining. It remains dynamically stable for a wide range of $x$-axial strain,\nbut becomes unstable for 2\\% $y$-axial compressive strain. The single-layer\nReS$_2$ is calculated to be an indirect bandgap semiconductor, and there is an\nindirect$-$direct bandgap transition under 1$-$5\\% $x$-axial tensile straining.\nThe single-layer ReS$_2$ is predicted incapable of catalyzing the water\noxidation reaction. However, 1$-$5\\% $y$-axial tensile strain can enable the\nsingle-layer ReS$_2$ for overall photocatalytic water splitting. Besides, the\nsingle-layer ReS$_2$ can also catalyze the overall water splitting and be most\nefficient under acidic water solutions with pH=3.8.\n", "  It is known that the group non-membership problem is in QMA relative to any\ngroup oracle and in ${\\rm SPP}\\cap{\\rm BQP}$ relative to group oracles for\nsolvable groups. We consider a modified version of the group non-membership\nproblem where the order of the group is also given as an additional input. We\nshow that the problem is in AWPP relative to any group oracle. To show the\nresult, we use the idea of the postselected quantum computing.\n", "  To understand the collective spiking activity in neuronal populations, it is\nessential to reveal basic circuit variables responsible for these emergent\nfunctional states. Here, I develop a mean field theory for the population\ncoupling recently proposed in the studies of visual cortex of mouse and monkey,\nrelating the individual neuron activity to the population activity, and extend\nthe original form to the second order, relating neuron-pair's activity to the\npopulation activity, to explain the high order correlations observed in the\nneural data. I test the computational framework on the salamander retinal data\nand the cortical spiking data of behaving rats. For the retinal data, the\noriginal form of population coupling and its advanced form can explain a\nsignificant fraction of two-cell correlations and three-cell correlations,\nrespectively. For the cortical data, the performance becomes much better, and\nthe second order population coupling reveals non-local effects in local\ncortical circuits.\n", "  Measuring the volume-weighted peculiar velocity statistics from\ninhomogeneously and sparsely distributed galaxies/halos, by existing velocity\nassignment methods, suffers from a significant sampling artifact. As an\nalternative, the Kriging interpolation based on Gaussian processes was\nintroduced and evaluated [Y. Yu, J. Zhang, Y. Jing, and P. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D\n92, 083527 (2015)]. Unfortunately, the most straightforward application of\nKriging does not perform better than the existing methods in the literature. In\nthis work, we investigate two physically motivated extensions. The first takes\ninto account of the anisotropic velocity correlations. The second introduces\nthe nugget effect, on account of multi-streaming of the velocity field. We find\nthat the performance is indeed improved. For sparsely sampled data\n[$n_P\\lesssim 6\\times 10^{-3}(h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc})^{-3}$] where the sampling\nartifact is the most severe, the improvement is significant and is two-fold: 1)\nThe scale of reliable measurement of the velocity power spectrum is extended by\na factor $\\sim 1.6$, and 2) the dependence on the velocity correlation prior is\nweakened by a factor of $\\sim 2$. We conclude that such extensions are\ndesirable for accurate velocity assignment by Kriging.\n", "  The suitability of a transportable 3He-spin filter as temporary broadband\npolarizer for a Time-of-Flight neutron reflectometer is demonstrated. A simple\ntwo-wavelength method for characterisation of a 3He-spin filter is proposed,\nwhich can be applied even if the absolute transmittance of the 3He-spin filter\ncannot be accurately determined. We demonstrate the data treatment procedure\nfor extracting the spin-up and spin-down neutron reflectivity from measurements\nobtained with a time dependent 3He polarization. The extraction of a very weak\nmagnetic signal from reflectivity data, measured on the in-situ grown magnetic\nheterostructure Fe1 nm/Cu20 nm/Sisubstrate in an externally applied magnetic\nfield of 30mT is presented and compared to similar measurements on the growth\nstage Cu20 nm/Sisubstrate of the very same sample, which does not yet contain\nany magnetic material.\n", "  Unknown quantum information cannot be perfectly copied (cloned). This\nstatement is the bedrock of quantum technologies and quantum cryptography,\nincluding the seminal scheme of Wiesner's quantum money, which was the first\nquantum-cryptographic proposal. Surprisingly, to our knowledge, quantum money\nhas not been tested experimentally yet. Here, we experimentally revisit the\nWiesner idea, assuming a banknote to be an image encoded in the polarization\nstates of single photons. We demonstrate that it is possible to use quantum\nstates to prepare a banknote that cannot be ideally copied without making the\nowner aware of only unauthorized actions. We provide the security conditions\nfor quantum money by investigating the physically-achievable limits on the\nfidelity of 1-to-2 copying of arbitrary sequences of qubits. These results can\nbe applied as a security measure in quantum digital right management.\n", "  We study an interacting box-particle system on a one-dimensional periodic\nring involving two species of particles $A$ and $B$. In this model, from a\nrandomly chosen site, a particle of species $A$ can hop to its right neighbor\nwith a rate that depends on the number of particles of the species $B$ at that\nsite. On the other hand, particles of species $B$ can be transferred between\ntwo neighboring sites with rates that depends on the number of particles of\nspecies $B$ at the two adjacent sites$-$this process however can occur only\nwhen the two sites are devoid of particles of the species $A$. We study\ncondensation transition for a specific choice of rates and find that the system\nshows a reentrant phase transition of species $A$ $-$ the species $A$ passes\nsuccessively through fluid-condensate-fluid phases as the coupling parameter\nbetween the dynamics of the two species is varied. On the other hand, the\ntransition of species $B$ is from condensate to fluid phase and hence does not\nshow reentrant feature.\n", "  Methods for achieving quantum control and detection of individual nuclear\nspins by single electrons of solid-state defects play a central role for\nquantum information processing and nano-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\nHowever, with standard techniques, no more than 8 nuclear spins have been\nresolved. Here we develop a method that improves significantly the ability to\nspectrally resolve nuclear spins and demonstrate its capabilities with detailed\nnumerical simulations by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre as model system.\nBased on delayed entanglement control, a technique combining microwave and\nradio-frequency (rf) fields, nuclei with resonances in a broad frequency band\ncan be unambiguously and individually addressed by the sensor electron.\nAdditionally the spectral resolution can extend beyond the electron spin\nrelaxation time by using a long-lived qubit memory. Our method greatly\nincreases the number of useful register qubits accessible to a defect centre\nand improves the signals of nano-scale NMR.\n", "  Discrepancies between reported structure function (SF) slopes and their\noverall flatness as compared to expectations from the damped random walk (DRW)\nmodel, which generally well describes the variability of active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs), have triggered us to study this problem in detail. We review common AGN\nvariability observables and identify their most common problems. Equipped with\nthis knowledge, we study ~9000 r-band AGN light curves from Stripe 82 of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, using SFs described by stochastic processes with the\npower exponential covariance matrix of the signal. We model the \"subensemble\"\nSFs in the redshift-absolute magnitude bins with the full SF equation\n(including the turnover and the noise part) and a single power law (SPL; in the\n\"red noise regime\" after subtracting the noise term). The distribution of\nfull-equation SF (SPL) slopes peaks at gamma = 0.55 +/- 0.08 (0.52 +/- 0.06)\nand is consistent with the DRW model. There is a hint of a weak correlation of\ngamma with the luminosity and a lack of correlation with the black hole mass.\nThe typical decorrelation timescale in the optical is tau = 0.97 +/- 0.46 year.\nThe SF amplitude at one year obtained from the SPL fitting is SF_0 = 0.22 +/-\n0.06 mag and is overestimated because the SF is already at the turnover part,\nso the true value is SF_0 = 0.20 +/- 0.06 mag. The asymptotic variability is\nSF_\\infty = 0.25 +/- 0.06 mag. It is strongly anticorrelated with both the\nluminosity and the Eddington ratio and is correlated with the black hole mass.\nThe reliability of these results is fortified with Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  Neutrinoless double electron capture is a process that, if detected, would\ngive evidence of lepton number violation and the Majorana nature of neutrinos.\nA search for neutrinoless double electron capture of $^{36}$Ar has been\nperformed with germanium detectors installed in liquid argon using data from\nPhase I of the GERmanium Detector Array (GERDA) experiment at the Gran Sasso\nLaboratory of INFN, Italy. No signal was observed and an experimental lower\nlimit on the half-life of the radiative neutrinoless double electron capture of\n$^{36}$Ar was established: $T_{1/2} > $ 3.6 $\\times$ 10$^{21}$ yr at 90 % C.I.\n", "  During animal development and homeostasis, the structure of tissues,\nincluding muscles, blood vessels and connective tissues adapts to mechanical\nstrains in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These strains originate from the\ndifferential growth of tissues or forces due to muscle contraction or gravity.\nHere we show using a computational model that by amplifying local strain cues,\nactive cell contractility can facilitate and accelerate the reorientation of\nsingle cells to static strains. At the collective cell level, the model\nsimulations show that active cell contractility can facilitate the formation of\nstrings along the orientation of stretch. The computational model is based on a\nhybrid cellular Potts and finite-element simulation framework describing a\nmechanical cell-substrate feedback, where: 1) cells apply forces on the ECM,\nsuch that 2) local strains are generated in the ECM, and 3) cells\npreferentially extend protrusions along the strain orientation. In accordance\nwith experimental observations, simulated cells align and form string-like\nstructures parallel to static uniaxial stretch. Our model simulations predict\nthat the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch and the strength of the contractile\nforces regulate a gradual transition between string-like patterns and vascular\nnetwork-like patterns. Our simulations also suggest that at high population\ndensities, less cell cohesion promotes string formation.\n", "  Concurrence, as one of entanglement measures, is a useful tool to\ncharacterize quantum entanglement in various quantum systems. However, the\ncomputation of the concurrence involves difficult optimizations and only for\nthe case of two qubits an exact formula was found. We investigate the\nconcurrence of four-qubit quantum states and derive analytical lower bound of\nconcurrence using the multiqubit monogamy inequality. It is shown that this\nlower bound is able to improve the existing bounds. This approach can be\ngeneralized to arbitrary qubit systems. We present an exact formula of\nconcurrence for some mixed quantum states. For even-qubit states, we derive an\nimproved lower bound of concurrence using a monogamy equality for qubit\nsystems. At the same time, we show that a multipartite state is\n$k$-nonseparable if the multipartite concurrence is larger than a constant\nrelated to the value of $k$, the qudit number and the dimension of the\nsubsystems. Our results can be applied to detect the multipartite\n$k$-nonseparable states.\n", "  Measurements of strange hadron (K0s, Lambda + anti-Lambda, and Xi+ + Xi-)\ntransverse momentum spectra in pp, pPb, and PbPb collisions are presented over\na wide range of rapidity and event charged-particle multiplicity. The data were\ncollected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7\nTeV, pPb collisions at sqrt(s[NN]) = 5.02 TeV, and PbPb collisions at\nsqrt(s[NN]) = 2.76 TeV. The average transverse kinetic energy is found to\nincrease with multiplicity, at a faster rate for heavier strange particle\nspecies in all systems. At similar multiplicities, the difference in average\ntransverse kinetic energy between different particle species is observed to be\nlarger for pp and pPb events than for PbPb events. In pPb collisions, the\naverage transverse kinetic energy is found to be slightly larger in the\nPb-going direction than in the p-going direction for events with large\nmultiplicity. The spectra are compared to models motivated by hydrodynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically propose and investigate a feasible\nexperimental scheme for realizing the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) of phonons\nin an optomechanical setup formed by a ground-state precooled mechanical\noscillator (MO) inside a Fabry-P{\\'e}rot cavity, which is driven by an\namplitude-modulated classical laser field in the dispersive (far-detuned)\nregime. The time modulation of the driving field leads to the parametric\namplification of the mechanical vacuum fluctuations of the MO, which results in\nthe generation of Casimir phonons over time scales longer than the cavity\nlifetime. We show that the generated phonons exhibit quadrature squeezing,\nbunching effect, and super-Poissonian statistics which are controllable by the\nexternally modulated laser pump. In particular, we find that the scheme allows\nfor a perfect squeezing transfer from one mechanical quadrature to another when\nthe laser frequency is varied from red detuning to blue detuning. Moreover, by\nanalyzing the effect of the thermal noise of the MO environment, we find that\nthere exists a critical temperature above which there is no phonon quadrature\nsqueezing to occur. We also show that in the presence of time modulation of the\ndriving laser the linewidth narrowing of the displacement spectrum of the MO\ncan be considered as a signature of the generation of Casimir phonons.\n", "  Usually, we assume that there is no inhomogeneity isotropic in terms of our\nlocation in our uni- verse. This assumption has not been observationally\nconfirmed yet in sufficient accuracy, and we need to consider the possibility\nthat there are non-negligible large-scale isotropic inhomogeneities in our\nuniverse. The existence of large-scale isotropic inhomogeneities affects the\ndetermination of the cosmological parameters. In particular, from only the\ndistance-redshift relation, we can not dis- tinguish the inhomogeneous\nisotropic universe model from the homogeneous isotropic one, because of the\nambiguity in the cosmological parameters. In this paper, in order to avoid such\nambiguity, we consider three observables, the distance-redshift relation, the\nfluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation(CMBR) and the\nscale of the baryon acoustic oscillation(BAO), and compare these observables in\ntwo universe models; One is the inhomogeneous isotropic uni- verse model with\nthe cosmological constant and the other is the homogeneous isotropic universe\nmodel with the dark energy other than the cosmological constant. We show that\nthese two universe models can not predict the same observational data of all\nthree observables but the same ones of only two of three, as long as the\nperturbations are adiabatic. In principle, we can distinguish the inhomogeneous\nisotropic universe from the homogeneous isotropic one through appropriate three\nobservables, if the perturbations are adiabatic.\n", "  Decoherence of electron spins in nanoscale systems is important to quantum\ntechnologies such as quantum information processing and magnetometry. It is\nalso an ideal model problem for studying the crossover between quantum and\nclassical phenomena. At low temperatures or in light-element materials where\nthe spin-orbit coupling is weak, the phonon scattering in nanostructures is\nless important and the fluctuations of nuclear spins become the dominant\ndecoherence mechanism for electron spins. Since 1950s, semiclassical noise\ntheories have been developed for understanding electron spin decoherence. In\nspin-based solid-state quantum technologies, the relevant systems are in the\nnanometer scale and the nuclear spin baths are quantum objects which require a\nquantum description. Recently, quantum pictures have been established to\nunderstand the decoherence and quantum many-body theories have been developed\nto quantitatively describe this phenomenon. Anomalous quantum effects have been\npredicted and some have been experimentally confirmed. A systematically\ntruncated cluster correlation expansion theory has been developed to account\nfor the many-body correlations in nanoscale nuclear spin baths that are built\nup during the electron spin decoherence. The theory has successfully predicted\nand explained a number of experimental results in a wide range of physical\nsystems. In this review, we will cover these recent progresses. The limitations\nof the present quantum many-body theories and possible directions for future\ndevelopment will also be discussed.\n", "  We have used the SmallGroups library of groups, together with the computer\nalgebra systems GAP and Mathematica, to search for groups with a\nthree-dimensional irreducible representation in which one of the group\ngenerators has a twice-degenerate eigenvalue while another generator has\nnon-degenerate eigenvalues. By assuming one of these group generators to\ncommute with the charged-lepton mass matrix and the other one to commute with\nthe neutrino (Dirac) mass matrix, one derives group-theoretical predictions for\nthe moduli of the matrix elements of either a row or a column of the lepton\nmixing matrix. Our search has produced several realistic predictions for either\nthe second row, or the third row, or for any of the columns of that matrix.\n", "  A geometrization of Schmidt-Legendre transformation of the second order\nLagrangians is proposed by building a proper Tulczyjew's triplet. The\nsymplectic relation between Ostrogradsky-Legendre and Schmidt-Legendre\ntransformations is obtained. Several examples are presented.\n", "  Two quantum channels are called compatible if they can be obtained as\nmarginals from a single broadcasting channel; otherwise they are incompatible.\nWe derive a characterization of the compatibility relation in terms of\nconcatenation and conjugation, and we show that all pairs of sufficiently noisy\nquantum channels are compatible. The complement relation of incompatibility can\nbe seen as a unifying aspect for many quantum features. We demonstrate that\nseveral phenomena, such as impossibility of universal broadcasting and\nunavoidable measurement disturbance, appear naturally in this framework.\n", "  We numerically study an analogue black hole with two horizons with similar\nparameters to a recent experiment. We find that the Hawking radiation exists on\na background which contains a density oscillation, a zero-frequency ripple. The\nHawking radiation evolves from spontaneous to self-amplifying, while the\nbackground ripple grows steadily with no qualitative change. It is seen that\nthe self-amplifying Hawking radiation has a non-zero frequency. The background\nripple appears even before the inner horizon is created, in contrast to\npredictions. This work is in agreement with the recent observation of\nself-amplifying Hawking radiation, and explains some of the features seen. In\ncontrast to recent works, our study differentiates between the Hawking\nradiation observed, and the evolution of the background.\n", "  We study how temperature affects the lifetime of a quantized, persistent\ncurrent state in a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). When the\ntemperature is increased, we find a decrease in the persistent current\nlifetime. Comparing our measured decay rates to simple models of thermal\nactivation and quantum tunneling, we do not find agreement. We also measured\nthe size of hysteresis loops size in our superfluid ring as a function of\ntemperature, enabling us to extract the critical velocity. The measured\ncritical velocity is found to depend strongly on temperature, approaching the\nzero temperature mean-field solution as the temperature is decreased. This\nindicates that an appropriate definition of critical velocity must incorporate\nthe role of thermal fluctuations, something not explicitly contained in\ntraditional theories.\n", "  We explore a novel strategy of patterning nematic elastomers that does not\nrequire inscribing the texture directly. It is based on varying the dopant\nconcentration that, beside shifting the phase transition point, affects the\nnematic director field via coupling between the gradients of concentration and\nnematic order parameter. Rotation of the director around a point dopant source\ncauses topological modification manifesting itself in a change of the number of\ndefects. A variety of shapes, dependent on the dopant distribution, are\nobtained by anisotropic deformation following the nematic--isotropic\ntransition.\n", "  In this paper we introduce a one-dimensional model of $su(2)_k$ anyons in\nwhich the number of anyons can fluctuate by means of a pairing term. The model\ncan be tuned to a point at which one can determine the exact zero-energy ground\nstates, in close analogy to the spin-1 AKLT model. We also determine the points\nat which the model is integrable and determine the behavior of the model at\nthese integrable points.\n", "  We analyze four extreme active galactic nuclei (AGN) transients to explore\nthe possibility that they are caused by rare, high-amplitude microlensing\nevents. These previously unknown type-I AGN are located in the redshift range\n0.6-1.1 and show changes of > 1.5 mag in the g-band on a time-scale of ~years.\nMulti-epoch optical spectroscopy, from the William Herschel Telescope, shows\nclear differential variability in the broad line fluxes with respect to the\ncontinuum changes and also evolution in the line profiles. In two cases, a\nsimple point-source, point-lens microlensing model provides an excellent match\nto the long-term variability seen in these objects. For both models, the\nparameter constraints are consistent with the microlensing being due to an\nintervening stellar mass object but as yet there is no confirmation of the\npresence of an intervening galaxy. The models predict a peak amplification of\n10.3/13.5 and an Einstein time-scale of 7.5/10.8 yr, respectively. In one case,\nthe data also allow constraints on the size of the CIII] emitting region, with\nsome simplifying assumptions, to to be ~1.0-6.5 light-days and a lower limit on\nthe size of the MgII emitting region to be > 9 light-days (half-light radii).\nThis CIII] radius is perhaps surprisingly small. In the remaining two objects,\nthere is spectroscopic evidence for an intervening absorber but the extra\nstructure seen in the light curves requires a more complex lensing scenario to\nadequately explain.\n", "  We propose a digital-analog quantum simulation of generalized Dicke models\nwith superconducting circuits, including Fermi-Bose condensates, biased and\npulsed Dicke models, for all regimes of light-matter coupling. We encode these\nclasses of problems in a set of superconducting qubits coupled with a bosonic\nmode implemented by a transmission line resonator. Via digital-analog\ntechniques, an efficient quantum simulation can be performed in\nstate-of-the-art circuit quantum electrodynamics platforms, by suitable\ndecomposition into analog qubit-bosonic blocks and collective single-qubit\npulses through digital steps. Moreover, just a single global analog block would\nbe needed during the whole protocol in most of the cases, superimposed with\nfast periodic pulses to rotate and detune the qubits. Therefore, a large number\nof digital steps may be attained with this approach, providing a reduced\ndigital error. Additionally, the number of gates per digital step does not grow\nwith the number of qubits, rendering the simulation efficient. This strategy\npaves the way for the scalable digital-analog quantum simulation of many-body\ndynamics involving bosonic modes and spin degrees of freedom with\nsuperconducting circuits.\n", "  We present experimental and numerical studies on principal modes in a\nmultimode fiber with mode coupling. By applying external stress to the fiber\nand gradually adjusting the stress, we have realized a transition from weak to\nstrong mode coupling, which corresponds to the transition from single\nscattering to multiple scattering in mode space. Our experiments show that\nprincipal modes have distinct spatial and spectral characteristic in the weak\nand strong mode coupling regimes. We also investigate the bandwidth of the\nprincipal modes, in particular, the dependence of the bandwidth on the delay\ntime, and the effects of the mode-dependent loss. By analyzing the path-length\ndistributions, we discover two distinct mechanisms that are responsible for the\nbandwidth of principal modes in weak and strong mode coupling regimes. Taking\ninto account the mode-dependent loss in the fiber, our numerical results are in\ngood agreement with our experimental observations. Our study paves the way for\nexploring potential applications of principal modes in communication, imaging\nand spectroscopy.\n", "  Change and local spatial variation are missing in canonical General\nRelativity's observables as usually defined, part of the problem of time.\nDefinitions can be tested using equivalent formulations, non-gauge and gauge,\nbecause they must have equivalent observables and everything is observable in\nthe non-gauge formulation. Taking an observable from the non-gauge formulation\nand finding the equivalent in the gauge formulation, one requires that the\nequivalent be an observable, constraining definitions. For massive photons, the\nde Broglie-Proca non-gauge formulation observable A_{\\mu} is equivalent to the\nStueckelberg-Utiyama gauge formulation quantity A_{\\mu}+\\partial_{\\mu} \\phi.\nThus observables must have 0 Poisson bracket not with each first-class\nconstraint, but with the Rosenfeld-Anderson-Bergmann-Castellani gauge generator\nG, a tuned sum of first-class constraints, in accord with the\nPons-Salisbury-Sundermeyer definition of observables.\n  The definition for external gauge symmetries can be tested using massive\ngravity, where one can install gauge freedom by parametrization with clock\nfields X^A. The non-gauge observable g^{\\mu\\nu} has the gauge equivalent\nX^A,_{\\mu} g^{\\mu\\nu} X^B,_{\\nu}. The Poisson bracket of X^A,_{\\mu} g^{\\mu\\nu}\nX^B,_{\\nu} with G turns out to be not 0 but a Lie derivative. This non-zero\nPoisson bracket refines and systematizes Kuchar's proposal to relax the 0\nPoisson bracket condition with the Hamiltonian constraint. Thus observables\nneed covariance, not invariance, in relation to external gauge symmetries.\n  The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian for massive gravity are those of General\nRelativity + Lambda + 4 scalars, so the same definition of observables applies\nto General Relativity. Local fields such as g_{\\mu\\nu} are observables. Thus\nobservables change. Requiring equivalent observables for equivalent theories\nalso recovers Hamiltonian-Lagrangian equivalence.\n", "  We study intrinsic coherence in the tripartite process to unambiguously\ndiscriminate two nonorthogonal states of a qubit, entangled with another one,\nand assisted by an auxiliary system. The optimal success probability is found\nto be benefited by initial intrinsic coherence, but no extra one is required.\nThe transformations among different contributions of intrinsic coherence are\nnecessary in this procedure, which increase with the overlap between the states\nto recognize. Such state discrimination is a key step of the probabilistic\nteleportation protocol. Entanglement of the quantum channel decreases the\ncoherence characterizing the reliance on an ancilla.\n", "  The inverse Ising problem and its generalizations to Potts and continuous\nspin models have recently attracted much attention thanks to their successful\napplications in the statistical modeling of biological data. In the standard\nsetting, the parameters of an Ising model (couplings and fields) are inferred\nusing a sample of equilibrium configurations drawn from the Boltzmann\ndistribution. However, in the context of biological applications, quantitative\ninformation for a limited number of microscopic spins configurations has\nrecently become available. In this paper, we extend the usual setting of the\ninverse Ising model by developing an integrative approach combining the\nequilibrium sample with (possibly noisy) measurements of the energy performed\nfor a number of arbitrary configurations. Using simulated data, we show that\nour integrative approach outperforms standard inference based only on the\nequilibrium sample or the energy measurements, including error correction of\nnoisy energy measurements. As a biological proof-of-concept application, we\nshow that mutational fitness landscapes in proteins can be better described\nwhen combining evolutionary sequence data with complementary structural\ninformation about mutant sequences.\n", "  We derive an effective dimensionally reduced theory for the Standard Model\naugmented by a real singlet scalar. We treat the singlet as a superheavy field\nand integrate it out, leaving an effective theory involving only the Higgs and\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)_\\mathrm{L} \\times \\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ gauge fields, identical to\nthe one studied previously for the Standard Model. This opens up the\npossibility of efficiently computing the order and strength of the electroweak\nphase transition, numerically and nonperturbatively, in this extension of the\nStandard Model. Understanding the phase diagram is crucial for models of\nelectroweak baryogenesis and for studying the production of gravitational waves\nat thermal phase transitions.\n", "  We present a general method of folding an integrable spin chain, defined on a\nline, to obtain an integrable open spin chain, defined on a half-line. We\nillustrate our method through two fundamental models with sl(2) Lie algebra\nsymmetry: the Heisenberg XXX and the Inozemtsev hyperbolic spin chains. We\nobtain new long-range boundary Hamiltonians and demonstrate that they exhibit\nYangian symmetries, thus ensuring integrability of the models we obtain. The\nmethod presented provides a \"bottom-up\" approach for constructing integrable\nboundaries and can be applied to any spin chain model.\n", "  Polarization beam splitters, devices that separate the two orthogonal\npolarizations of light into different propagation directions, are one of the\nmost ubiquitous optical elements. However, traditionally polarization splitters\nrely on bulky optical materials, while emerging optoelectronic and photonic\ncircuits require compact, chip-scale polarization splitters. Here we show that\na subwavelength rectangular lattice of cylindrical silicon Mie resonators\nfunctions as a polarization splitter, efficiently reflecting one polarization\nwhile transmitting the other. We show that the polarization splitting arises\nfrom the anisotropic permittivity and permeability of the metasurface due to\nthe two-fold rotational symmetry of the rectangular unit cell. The high\npolarization efficiency, low loss, and low profile make these metasurface\npolarization splitters ideally suited for monolithic integration with\noptoelectronic and photonic circuits.\n", "  Making use of the weighted Mourre theory developed in [GJ1], we show the\nlimiting absorption principle for Schr{\\\"o}dinger operators with perturbed\noscillating potential on appropriate energy intervals. We focus on a certain\nclass of oscillating potentials (larger than the one in [GJ2]) that was already\nstudied in [BD, MU, ReT1, ReT2]. We allow long-range and short-range components\nand local singularities in the perturbation. We improve known results, the main\nnovelty being the presence of a long-range perturbation. A subclass of the\nconsidered potentials actually cannot be treated by the usual Mourre commutator\nmethod. Inspired by [FH], we also show, in some cases, the absence of positive\neigenvalues for our Schr{\\\"o}dinger operators.\n", "  A search is performed for Higgs-boson-mediated flavor-changing neutral\ncurrents in the decays of top quarks. The search is based on proton-proton\ncollision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse\nfemtobarns at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV collected with the CMS detector\nat the LHC. Events in which a top quark pair is produced with one top quark\ndecaying into a charm or up quark and a Higgs boson (H), and the other top\nquark decaying into a bottom quark and a W boson are selected. The Higgs boson\nin these events is assumed to subsequently decay into either dibosons or\ndifermions. No significant excess is observed above the expected standard model\nbackground, and an upper limit at the 95% confidence level is set on the\nbranching fraction B(t to Hc) of 0.40% and B(t to Hu) of 0.55%, where the\nexpected upper limits are 0.43% and 0.40%, respectively. These results\ncorrespond to upper limits on the square of the flavor-changing Higgs boson\nYukawa couplings |lambda[tc]^H|^2 < 6.9E-3 and |lambda[tu]^H|^2 < 9.8E-3.\n", "  The cross sections of $e^{+}e^{-}\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}h_c$ at center-of-mass\nenergies from 3.896 to 4.600 GeV are measured using data samples collected with\nthe BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The\ncross sections are found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}J/\\psi$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}\\psi(2S)$,\nbut the line shape is inconsistent with the $Y$ states observed in the latter\ntwo modes. Two structures are observed in the $e^{+}e^{-}\\to\\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}h_c$\ncross sections around 4.22 and 4.39 GeV/$c^{2}$, which we call $Y(4220)$ and\n$Y(4390)$, respectively. A fit with a coherent sum of two Breit-Wigner\nfunctions results in a mass of $(4218.4^{+5.5}_{-4.5}\\pm0.9)$ MeV/$c^{2}$ and a\nwidth of $(66.0^{+12.3}_{-8.3}\\pm0.4)$ MeV for the $Y(4220)$, and a mass of\n$(4391.6^{+6.3}_{-6.8}\\pm1.0)$ MeV/$c^{2}$ and a width of\n$(139.5^{+16.2}_{-20.6}\\pm0.6)$ MeV for the $Y(4390)$, where the first\nuncertainties are statistical and the second ones systematic. The statistical\nsignificance of $Y(4220)$ and $Y(4390)$ is 10$\\sigma$ over one structure\nassumption.\n", "  A general framework of optimal eavesdropping on BB84 protocol was provided by\nFuchs et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 1997]. An upper bound on mutual information was\nderived, which could be achieved by a specific type of interaction and the\ncorresponding measurement. However, uniqueness of optimal interaction was posed\nas an unsolved problem there and it has remained open for almost two decades\nnow. In this paper, we solve this open problem and establish the uniqueness of\noptimal interaction up to rotation. The specific choice of optimal interaction\nby Fuchs et al. is shown to be a special case of the form derived in our work.\n", "  In this letter, we show that the dimensionless parameter in the generalized\nuncertainty principle (GUP) can be constrained by the gravitational wave event\nGW150914, which was discovered by the LIGO Scientific and Virgo Collaborations.\nFirstly, according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (HUP) and the data\nof gravitational wave event GW150914, we derive the standard energy-momentum\ndispersion relation and calculate the difference between the propagation speed\nof gravitons and the speed of light, i.e., $\\Delta \\upsilon$. Next, using two\nproposals regarding the GUP, we also generalize our study to the quantum\ngravity case and obtain the modified speed of gravitons. Finally, based on the\nmodified speed of gravitons and $\\Delta \\upsilon$, the improved upper bounds on\nthe GUP parameters are obtained. The results show that the upper limits of the\nGUP parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\alpha_0$ are $2.3 \\times 10^ {60}$ and $1.8\n\\times 10^{20}$.\n", "  Searches for invisible decays of the Higgs boson are presented. The data\ncollected with the CMS detector at the LHC correspond to integrated\nluminosities of 5.1, 19.7, and 2.3 inverse femtobarns at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 7, 8, and 13 TeV, respectively. The search channels target Higgs\nboson production via gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and in association with\na vector boson. Upper limits are placed on the branching fraction of the Higgs\nboson decay to invisible particles, as a function of the assumed production\ncross sections. The combination of all channels, assuming standard model\nproduction, yields an observed (expected) upper limit on the invisible\nbranching fraction of 0.24 (0.23) at the 95% confidence level. The results are\nalso interpreted in the context of Higgs-portal dark matter models.\n", "  A conservation law theorem stated by N. Ibragimov along with its subsequent\nextensions are shown to be a special case of a standard formula that uses a\npair consisting of a symmetry and an adjoint-symmetry to produce a conservation\nlaw through a well-known Fr\\'echet derivative identity. Also, the connection of\nthis formula (and of Ibragimov's theorem) to the standard action of symmetries\non conservation laws is explained, which accounts for a number of major\ndrawbacks that have appeared in recent work using the formula to generate\nconservation laws. In particular, the formula can generate trivial conservation\nlaws and does not always yield all non-trivial conservation laws unless the\nsymmetry action on the set of these conservation laws is transitive. It is\nemphasized that all local conservation laws for any given system of\ndifferential equations can be found instead by a general method using\nadjoint-symmetries. This general method is a kind of adjoint version of the\nstandard Lie method to find all local symmetries and is completely algorithmic.\nThe relationship between this method, Noether's theorem, and the\nsymmetry/adjoint-symmetry formula is discussed.\n", "  The massive substructures found in Abell 2744 by Jauzac et al. (2016) present\na challenge to the cold dark matter paradigm due to their number and proximity\nto the cluster centre. We use one of the biggest N-body simulations, the\nMillennium XXL, to investigate the substructure in a large sample of massive\ndark matter haloes. A range of effects which influence the comparison with the\nobservations is considered, extending the preliminary evaluation carried out by\nJauzac et al. (2016). There are many tens of haloes in the simulation with a\ntotal mass comparable with or larger than that of Abell 2744. However, we find\nno haloes with a number and distribution of massive substructures (> 5 10^13\nMsun) that is close to that inferred from the observations of Abell 2744. The\napplication of extreme value statistics suggests that we would need a\nsimulation of at least ten times the volume of the Millennium XXL to find a\nsingle dark matter halo with a similar internal structure to Abell 2744.\nExplaining the distribution of massive substructures in clusters is a new\nhurdle for hierarchical models to negotiate, which is not weakened by appeals\nto baryonic physics or uncertainty over the nature of the dark matter particle.\n", "  The spin-charge coupled dynamics in a thin, magnetized metallic system are\ninvestigated. The effective driving force acting on the charge carriers is\ngenerated by a dynamical magnetic texture, which can be induced, e.g., by a\nmagnetic material in contact with a normal-metal system. We consider a general\ninversion-asymmetric substrate/normal-metal/magnet structure, which, by\nspecifying the precise nature of each layer, can mimick various experimentally\nemployed setups. Inversion symmetry breaking gives rise to an effective Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction. We derive general spin-charge kinetic equations which\nshow that such spin-orbit interaction, together with anisotropic Elliott-Yafet\nspin relaxation, yields significant corrections to the magnetization-induced\ndynamics. In particular, we present a consistent treatment of the spin density\nand spin current contributions to the equations of motion, inter alia\nidentifying a novel term in the effective force which appears due to a spin\ncurrent polarized parallel to the magnetization. This \"inverse spin filter\"\ncontribution depends markedly on the parameter which describes the anisotropy\nin spin relaxation. To further highlight the physical meaning of the different\ncontributions, the spin pumping configuration of typical experimental setups is\nanalyzed in detail. In the two-dimensional limit the build-up of a DC voltage\nis dominated by the spin galvanic (inverse Edelstein) effect. A measuring\nscheme that could isolate this contribution is discussed.\n", "  For active optical imaging, the use of single-photon detectors can greatly\nimprove the detection sensitivity of the system. However, the traditional\nmaximum-likelihood based imaging method needs a long acquisition time to\ncapture clear three-dimensional (3D) image in low light-level. To tackle this\nproblem, we present a novel imaging method for depth estimate, which can obtain\nthe accurate 3D image in a short acquisition time. Our method combines the\nphoton-count statistics with the temporal correlations of the reflected signal.\nAccording to the characteristics of the target surface, including the surface\nreflectivity, our method is capable of adaptively changing the dwell time in\neach pixel. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can\nfast obtain the accurate depth image despite the existence of strong background\nnoise.\n", "  The absorption process of an emitter close to a plasmonic antenna is enhanced\ndue to strong local electromagnetic (EM) fields. The emission process, if\nresonant with the plasmonic system, re-radiates to the far-field by coupling\nwith the antenna due to the availability of plasmonic states. This increases\nthe local density of states (LDOS), effectively providing more, or alternate,\npathways for emission. Through the mapping of localized emission events from\nsingle molecules close to plasmonic antennas, performed using far-field data,\none gains combined information on both the local EM field strength and the LDOS\navailable. The localization from these emission-coupled events generally do\nnot, therefore, report the real position of the molecules, nor the EM\nenhancement distribution at the illuminating wavelength. Here we propose the\nuse of a large Stokes shift fluorescent molecule in order to spectrally\ndecouple the emission process of the dye from the plasmonic system, leaving\nonly the absorption strongly in resonance with the enhanced EM field in the\nantennas vicinity. We show that the real position of the emitters in this\ncomplex, but interesting, scenario can be found directly. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that this technique provides an effective way of exploring either\nthe EM field or the LDOS with nanometre spatial resolution.\n", "  We propose a new strategy to search for dark matter axions in the mass range\nof 40--400 $\\mu$eV by introducing dielectric haloscopes, which consist of\ndielectric disks placed in a magnetic field. The changing dielectric media\ncause discontinuities in the axion-induced electric field, leading to the\ngeneration of propagating electromagnetic waves to satisfy the continuity\nrequirements at the interfaces. Large-area disks with adjustable distances\nboost the microwave signal (10--100 GHz) to an observable level and allow one\nto scan over a broad axion mass range. A sensitivity to QCD axion models is\nconceivable with 80 disks of 1 m$^2$ area contained in a $10$ Tesla field.\n", "  We study the six-point NMHV ratio function in planar ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM theory\nin the context of positive geometry. The Amplituhedron construction of the\nintegrand for the amplitudes provides a kinematical region in which the\nintegrand was observed to be positive. It is natural to conjecture that this\nproperty survives integration, i.e. that the final result for the ratio\nfunction is also positive in this region. Establishing such a result would\nimply that preserving positivity is a surprising property of the Minkowski\ncontour of integration and it might indicate some deeper underlying structure.\nWe find that the ratio function is positive everywhere we have tested it,\nincluding analytic results for special kinematical regions at one and two\nloops, as well as robust numerical evidence through five loops. There is also\nevidence for not just positivity, but monotonicity in a \"radial\" direction. We\nalso investigate positivity of the MHV six-gluon amplitude. While the remainder\nfunction ceases to be positive at four loops, the BDS-like normalized MHV\namplitude appears to be positive through five loops.\n", "  We present recent developments of irregular conformal conformal states.\nIrregular vertex operators and their adjoint in a new formalism are used to\ndefine the irregular conformal states and their inner product instead of using\nthe colliding limit procedure. Free field formalism can be augmented by\nscreening operators which provide more degrees of freedom. The inner product is\nconveniently given as the partition function of an irregular matrix model.\n(Deformed) spectral curve is the loop equation of the matrix model at\nNekrasov-Shatashivili limit. We present the details of analytic structure of\nthe spectral curve for Virasoso symmetry and its extensions, $W$-symmetry and\nsuper-symmetry.\n", "  The conventional theory of burning works well in the case of uniform media\nwhere all system parameters are spatially independent. We develop a theory of\nburning in disordered media. In this case, rare regions (hot spots) where the\nburning process is more effective than on average may control the heat\npropagation in an explosive sample. We show that most predictions of the theory\nof burning are quite different from the conventional case. In particular, we\nshow that a system of randomly distributed hot spots exhibits a dynamic phase\ntransition, which is similar to the percolation transition. Depending on\nparameters of the system the phase transition can be either first or second\norder. These two regimes are separated by a tricritical point. The above\nresults may be applicable to dynamics of any over-heated disordered system with\na first order phase transition.\n", "  We describe a direct method for experimental determination of the negativity\nof an arbitrary two-qubit state with 11 measurements performed on multiple\ncopies of the two-qubit system. Our method is based on the experimentally\naccessible sequences of singlet projections performed on up to four qubit\npairs. In particular, our method permits the application of the Peres-Horodecki\nseparability criterion to an arbitrary two-qubit state. We explicitly\ndemonstrate that measuring entanglement in terms of negativity requires three\nmeasurements more than detecting two-qubit entanglement. The reported minimal\nset of interferometric measurements provides a complete description of\nbipartite quantum entanglement in terms of two-photon interference. This set is\nsmaller than the set of 15 measurements needed to perform a complete quantum\nstate tomography of an arbitrary two-qubit system. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe set of 9 Makhlin's invariants needed to express the negativity can be\nmeasured by performing 13 multicopy projections. We demonstrate that these\ninvariants are both a useful theoretical concept for designing specialized\nquantum interferometers and that their direct measurement within the framework\nof linear optics does not require performing complete quantum state tomography.\n", "  Topological insulators (TIs) and Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are two realizations\nof topological matter usually appearing separately in nature. However, they are\ndirectly related to each other via a topological phase transition. In this\npaper, we investigate the question whether these two topological phases can\nexist together at the same time, with a combined, hybrid surface state at the\njoint boundaries. We analyze effective models of a 3D TI and an inversion\nsymmetric WSM and couple them in a way that certain symmetries, like inversion,\nare preserved. A tunnel coupling approach enables us to obtain the hybrid\nsurface state Hamiltonian analytically. This offers the possibility of a\ndetailed study of its dispersion relation depending on the investigated\ncouplings. For spin-symmetric coupling, we find that two Dirac nodes can emerge\nout of the combination of a single Dirac node and a Fermi arc. For\nspin-asymmetric coupling, the dispersion relation is gapped and the former\nDirac node gets spin-polarized. We propose different experimental realization\nof the hybrid system, including compressively strained HgTe as well as\nheterostructures of TI and WSM materials.\n", "  Optical materials with semiconductor nanoparticles within dielectric matrices\nare of interest for construction of non-linear optical elements, selective\nfilters, spectral converters, etc. In the present work, we concern the glasses\nwith PbS and PbSe fabricated by the two-step technique on the basis of silicate\nglass matrix and report the recent studied using the small-angle neutron\nscattering (SANS) technique. A proper understanding the structure of material,\nsize of particles and spectral features need to control optical functionality\nof glasses. SANS is efficient non-destructive technique allowing a wide range\nof structural models in the size range from atomic clusters to submicron size.\nHere we combine SANS measurements with wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD) and\nelectron microscopy to get information on nanoparticles formed in a series of\nPbS and PbSe-doped silicate glasses.\n", "  In this article, we point out that the effective Hamiltonian for neutrino\noscillations in matter is invariant under the transformation of the mixing\nangle $\\theta^{}_{12} \\to \\theta^{}_{12} - \\pi/2$ and the exchange of first two\nneutrino masses $m^{}_1 \\leftrightarrow m^{}_2$, if the standard\nparametrization of lepton flavor mixing matrix is adopted. To maintain this\nsymmetry in perturbative calculations, we present a symmetric formulation of\nthe effective Hamiltonian by introducing an $\\eta$-gauge neutrino mass-squared\ndifference $\\Delta^{}_* \\equiv \\eta \\Delta^{}_{31} + (1-\\eta)\\Delta^{}_{32}$\nfor $0 \\leq \\eta \\leq 1$, where $\\Delta^{}_{ji} \\equiv m^2_j - m^2_i$ for $ji =\n21, 31, 32$, and show that only $\\eta = 1/2$, $\\eta = \\cos^2\\theta^{}_{12}$ or\n$\\eta = \\sin^2 \\theta^{}_{12}$ is allowed. Furthermore, we prove that $\\eta =\n\\cos^2 \\theta^{}_{12}$ is the best choice to derive more accurate and compact\nneutrino oscillation probabilities, by implementing the approach of\nrenromalization-group equations. The validity of this approach becomes\ntransparent when an analogy is made between the parameter $\\eta$ herein and the\nrenormalization scale $\\mu$ in relativistic quantum field theories.\n", "  We show that in SO(10) models, a Yukawa sector consisting of a real $10_H$, a\nreal $120_H$ and a complex $126_H$ of Higgs fields can provide a realistic fit\nto all fermion masses and mixings, including the neutrino sector. Although the\ngroup theory of SO(10) demands that the $10_H$ and $120_H$ be real, most\nconstructions complexify these fields and impose symmetries exterior to SO(10)\nto achieve predictivity. The proposed new framework with real $10_H$ and real\n$120_H$ relies only on SO(10) gauge symmetry, and yet has a limited number of\nYukawa parameters. Our analysis shows that while there are restrictions on the\nobservables, a good fit to the entire fermion spectrum can be realized.\nUnification of gauge couplings is achieved with an intermediate scale\nPati-Salam gauge symmetry. Proton decay branching ratios are calculable, with\nthe leading decay modes being $p \\rightarrow \\overline{\\nu} \\pi^+$ and $p\n\\rightarrow e^+ \\pi^0$.\n", "  We analyze the inspiral dynamics of equal-mass precessing black-hole binaries\nusing multi-timescale techniques. The orbit-averaged post-Newtonian\nevolutionary equations admit two constants of motion in the equal-mass limit,\nnamely the magnitude of the total spin $S$ and the effective spin $\\xi$. This\nfeature makes the entire dynamics qualitatively different compared to the\ngeneric unequal-mass case, where only $\\xi$ is constant while the variable $S$\nparametrizes the precession dynamics. For fixed individual masses and spin\nmagnitudes, an equal-mass black-hole inspiral is uniquely characterized by the\ntwo parameters $(S,\\xi)$: these two numbers completely determine the entire\nevolution under the effect of radiation reaction. In particular, for equal-mass\nbinaries we find that (i) the black-hole binary spin morphology is constant\nthroughout the inspiral, and that (ii) the precessional motion of the two\nblack-hole spins about the total spin takes place on a longer timescale than\nthe precession of the total spin and the orbital plane about the total angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We summarise a recent reconstruction of the quantum theory of qubits from\nrules constraining an observer's acquisition of information about physical\nsystems. This review of [arXiv:1412.8323, arXiv:1511.01130] is accessible and\nfairly self-contained, focussing on the main ideas and results and not the\ntechnical details. The reconstruction offers an informational explanation for\nthe architecture of the theory and specifically for its correlation structure.\nIn particular, it explains entanglement, monogamy and non-locality compellingly\nfrom limited accessible information and complementarity. As a byproduct, it\nalso unravels new `conserved informational charges' from complementarity\nrelations that characterise the unitary group and the set of pure states.\n", "  We report the observation of a temperature-controlled synchronization of two\nBrownian-particles in a binary mixture close to the critical point of the\ndemixing transition. The two beads are trapped by two optical tweezers whose\ndistance is periodically modulated. We notice that the motion synchronization\nof the two beads appears when the critical temperature is approached. In\ncontrast, when the fluid is far from its critical temperature, the\ndisplacements of the two beads are uncorrelated. Small changes in temperature\ncan radically change the global dynamics of the system. We show that the\nsynchronisation is induced by the critical Casimir forces. Finally, we present\nthe measure of the energy transfers inside the system produced by the critical\ninteraction.\n", "  The exact solutions of the super quantum discord are derived for general two\nqubit X states in terms of a one-variable function. Several exact solutions of\nthe super quantum discord are given for the general X-state over nontrivial\nregions of a seven dimensional manifold. It is shown that the super quantum\ndiscord of the X state may increase or decreases under the phase damping\nchannel.\n", "  Not necessarily self-adjoint quantum graphs -- differential operators on\nmetric graphs -- are considered. Assume in addition that the underlying metric\ngraph possesses an automorphism (symmetry) $ \\mathcal P $. If the differential\noperator is $ \\mathcal P \\mathcal T$-symmetric, then its spectrum has\nreflection symmetry with respect to the real line. Our goal is to understand\nwhether the opposite statement holds, namely whether the reflection symmetry of\nthe spectrum of a quantum graph implies that the underlying metric graph\npossesses a non-trivial automorphism and the differential operator is $\n\\mathcal P \\mathcal T$-symmetric. We give partial answer to this question by\nconsidering equilateral star-graphs. The corresponding Laplace operator with\nRobin vertex conditions possesses reflection-symmetric spectrum if and only if\nthe operator is $ \\mathcal P \\mathcal T$-symmetric with $ \\mathcal P $ being an\nautomorphism of the metric graph.\n", "  MCP-based detectors are widely used in the ultraviolet (UV) region due to\ntheir low noise levels, high sensitivity and good spatial and temporal\nresolution. We have developed a compact near-UV (NUV) detector for\nhigh-altitude balloon and space flights, using off-the-shelf MCP, CMOS sensor,\nand optics. The detector is designed to be capable of working in the direct\nframe transfer mode as well in the photon-counting mode for single photon event\ndetection. The identification and centroiding of each photon event are done\nusing an FPGA-based data acquisition and real-time processing system. In this\npaper, we discuss various algorithms and methods used in both operating modes,\nas well as their implementation on the hardware.\n", "  PySCF is a general-purpose electronic structure platform designed from the\nground up to emphasize code simplicity, both to aid new method development, as\nwell as for flexibility in computational workflow. The package provides a wide\nrange of tools to support simulations of finite size systems, extended systems\nwith periodic boundary conditions, low dimensional periodic systems, and custom\nHamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard\nGaussian basis functions. To ensure easy of extensibility, PySCF uses the\nPython language to implement almost all its features, while computationally\ncritical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this\ncombined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best\nexisting C or Fortran based quantum chemistry programs. In this paper we\ndocument the capabilities and design philosophy of the current version of the\nPySCF package.\n", "  AOLI (Adaptive Optics Lucky Imager) is a state-of-art instrument that\ncombines adaptive optics (AO) and lucky imaging (LI) with the objective of\nobtaining diffraction limited images in visible wavelength at mid- and big-size\nground-based telescopes. The key innovation of AOLI is the development and use\nof the new TP3-WFS (Two Pupil Plane Positions Wavefront Sensor). The TP3-WFS,\nworking in visible band, represents an advance over classical wavefront sensors\nsuch as the Shack-Hartmann WFS (SH-WFS) because it can theoretically use\nfainter natural reference stars, which would ultimately provide better sky\ncoverages to AO instruments using this newer sensor. This paper describes the\nsoftware, algorithms and procedures that enabled AOLI to become the first\nastronomical instrument performing real-time adaptive optics corrections in a\ntelescope with this new type of WFS, including the first control-related\nresults at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT).\n", "  The newly emerging field of wave front shaping in complex media has recently\nseen enormous progress. The driving force behind these advances has been the\nexperimental accessibility of the information stored in the scattering matrix\nof a disordered medium, which can nowadays routinely be exploited to focus\nlight as well as to image or to transmit information even across highly turbid\nscattering samples. We will provide an overview of these new techniques, of\ntheir experimental implementations as well as of the underlying theoretical\nconcepts following from mesoscopic scattering theory. In particular, we will\nhighlight the intimate connections between quantum transport phenomena and the\nscattering of light fields in disordered media, which can both be described by\nthe same theoretical concepts. We also put particular emphasis on how the above\ntopics relate to application-oriented research fields such as optical imaging,\nsensing and communication.\n", "  We present imaging polarimetry of the superluminous supernova SN 2015bn,\nobtained over nine epochs between $-$20 and $+$46 days with the Nordic Optical\nTelescope. This was a nearby, slowly-evolving Type I superluminous supernova\nthat has been studied extensively and for which two epochs of\nspectropolarimetry are also available. Based on field stars, we determine the\ninterstellar polarisation in the Galaxy to be negligible. The polarisation of\nSN 2015bn shows a statistically significant increase during the last epochs,\nconfirming previous findings. Our well-sampled imaging polarimetry series\nallows us to determine that this increase (from $\\sim 0.54\\%$ to $\\gtrsim\n1.10\\%$) coincides in time with rapid changes that took place in the optical\nspectrum. We conclude that the supernova underwent a `phase transition' at\naround $+$20 days, when the photospheric emission shifted from an outer layer,\ndominated by natal C and O, to a more aspherical inner core, dominated by\nfreshly nucleosynthesized material. This two-layered model might account for\nthe characteristic appearance and properties of Type I superluminous\nsupernovae.\n", "  We investigate the mechanical response of thin sheets perforated with a\nsquare array of mutually orthogonal cuts, which leaves a network of squares\nconnected by small ligaments. Our combined analytical, experimental and\nnumerical results indicate that under uniaxial tension the ligaments buckle\nout-of-plane, inducing the formation of 3D patterns whose morphology is\ncontrolled by the load direction. We also find that by largely stretching the\nbuckled perforated sheets, plastic strains develop in the ligaments. This gives\nrise to the formation of kirigami sheets comprising periodic distribution of\ncuts and permanent folds. As such, the proposed buckling-induced pop-up\nstrategy points to a simple route for manufacturing complex morphable\nstructures out of flat perforated sheets.\n", "  We present measurements of charged jet cross sections and jet shape\nobservables in leading jet in proton-proton (pp) collisions at sqrt(s) = 2.76\nTeV with the ALICE detector at LHC. Jets are reconstructed at the midrapidity\nfrom charged particle using sequential recombination anti-kT jet finding\nalgorithm for various R values. The results are compared to measurements from\nHERWIG, PHOJET and different tunes of PYTHIA6 and earlier measurements at 7\nTeV.\n", "  A mathematical algorithm to describe DNA or RNA sequences of $N$ nucleotides\nby a string of $2N$ integers numbers is presented in the framework of the so\ncalled crystal basis model of the genetic code. The description allows to\ndefine a not trivial distance between two sequences and to perform the Discrete\nFourier Transform on a sequence. Using the definition of distance the sequence\nof $\\beta$-globin for Homo, Gallus and Opossum are compared. The Discrete\nFourier Transform for some simple examples is computed.\n", "  The $k\\cdot p$ effective mass approximation (EMA) predicts large, nearly\nsize-independent exciton oscillator strengths in quantum confined\nsemiconductors. Yet, experimental reports have concluded that the total\noscillator strength of the lowest-energy (1S$_{3/2}$1S$_{\\text{e}}$) excitons\nin strongly confined CdSe NQDs is small and strongly size-dependent. Using the\noptical Stark effect, we show that the oscillator strength of the\n1S$_{3/2}$1S$_{\\text{e}}$ excitonic absorption peak in CdSe NQDs follows the\npredictions of the EMA. These oscillator strengths enable helicity-selective\nunsaturated Stark shifts corresponding to femtosecond pseudo-magnetic fields\nexceeding 100 T.\n", "  Making use of the expression for the propagator in terms of path integrals,\nwe study the effect of certain variational symmetries of a Lagrangian on the\ncorresponding propagator. We also show that by considering a point\ntransformation that relates two different Lagrangians one can obtain a relation\nbetween the corresponding propagators.\n", "  We study the effect of angular momentum on the surface density profiles of\ndisc galaxies, using high resolution simulations of major mergers whose\nremnants have downbending radial density profiles (type II). As described in\nthe previous papers of this series, in this scenario, most of the disc mass is\nacquired after the collision via accretion from a hot gaseous halo. We find\nthat the inner and outer disc scalelengths, as well as the break radius,\ncorrelate with the total angular momentum of the initial merging system, and\nare larger for high angular momentum systems. We follow the angular momentum\nredistribution in our simulated galaxies, and find that, like the mass, the\ndisc angular momentum is acquired via accretion, i.e. to the detriment of the\ngaseous halo. Furthermore, high angular momentum systems give more angular\nmomentum to their discs, which affects directly their radial density profile.\nAdding simulations of isolated galaxies to our sample, we find that the\ncorrelations are valid also for disc galaxies evolved in isolation. We show\nthat the outer part of the disc at the end of the simulation is populated\nmainly by inside-out stellar migration, and that in galaxies with higher\nangular momentum, stars travel radially further out. This, however, does not\nmean that outer disc stars (in type II discs) were mostly born in the inner\ndisc. Indeed, generally the break radius increases over time, and not taking\nthis into account leads to overestimating the number of stars born in the inner\ndisc.\n", "  The hexagonal structure of graphene gives rise to the property of gas\nimpermeability, motivating its investigation for a new application: protection\nof semiconductor photocathodes in electron accelerators. These materials are\nextremely susceptible to degradation in efficiency through multiple mechanisms\nrelated to contamination from the local imperfect vacuum environment of the\nhost photoinjector. Few-layer graphene has been predicted to permit a modified\nphotoemission response of protected photocathode surfaces, and recent\nexperiments of single-layer graphene on copper have begun to confirm these\npredictions for single crystal metallic photocathodes. Unlike metallic\nphotoemitters, the integration of an ultra-thin graphene barrier film with\nconventional semiconductor photocathode growth processes is not\nstraightforward. A first step toward addressing this challenge is the growth\nand characterization of technologically relevant, high quantum efficiency\nbialkali photocathodes grown on ultra-thin free-standing graphene substrates.\nPhotocathode growth on free-standing graphene provides the opportunity to\nintegrate these two materials and study their interaction. Specifically,\nspectral response features and photoemission stability of cathodes grown on\ngraphene substrates are compared to those deposited on established substrates.\nIn addition we observed an increase of work function for the graphene\nencapsulated bialkali photocathode surfaces, which is predicted by our\ncalculations. The results provide a unique demonstration of bialkali\nphotocathodes on free-standing substrates, and indicate promise towards our\ngoal of fabricating high-performance graphene encapsulated photocathodes with\nenhanced lifetime for accelerator applications.\n", "  At present, a large number of pulsating white dwarf (WD) stars is being\ndiscovered either from Earth-based surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey, or through observations from space (e.g., the Kepler mission). The\nasteroseismological techniques allow us to infer details of internal chemical\nstratification, the total mass, and even the stellar rotation profile. In this\npaper, we first describe the basic properties of WD stars and their pulsations,\nas well as the different sub-types of these variables known so far.\nSubsequently, we describe some recent findings about pulsating low-mass WDs.\n", "  Boron carbide is a ceramic material with unique properties widely used in\nnumerous, including armor, applications. Its mechanical properties, mechanism\nof compression, and limits of stability are of both scientific and practical\nvalue. Here, we report the behavior of the stoichiometric boron carbide B13C2\nstudied on single crystals up to 68 GPa. As revealed by synchrotron X-ray\ndiffraction, B13C2 maintains its crystal structure and does not undergo phase\ntransitions. Accurate measurements of the unit cell and B12 icosahedra volumes\nas a function of pressure led to conclusion that they reduce similarly upon\ncompression that is typical for covalently bonded solids. A comparison of the\ncompressional behavior of B13C2 with that of alpha-B, gamma-B, and B4C showed\nthat it is determined by the types of bonding involved in the course of\ncompression. Neither molecular-like nor inversed-molecular-like solid behavior\nupon compression was detected that closes a long-standing scientific dispute.\n", "  Current state of the art quantum computing experiments in the microwave\nregime use control pulses generated by modulating microwave tones with baseband\nsignals generated by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). Recent advances in\ndigital analog conversion technology have made it possible to directly\nsynthesize arbitrary microwave pulses with sampling rates up to 92 gigasamples\nper second (GS/s). These new high bandwidth AWG's could dramatically simplify\nthe classical control chain for quantum computing experiments, enabling more\nadvanced pulse shaping and reducing the number of components that need to be\ncarefully calibrated. Here we use a high speed AWG to study the viability of\nsuch a simplified scheme. We characterize the AWG and perform randomized\nbenchmarking of a superconducting qubit, achieving average single qubit gate\nerror rates below $5\\times10^{-4}$.\n", "  Roughness predominantly alters the near-wall region of turbulent flow while\nthe outer layer remains similar. This makes it a prime candidate for the\nminimal-span channel, which only captures the near-wall flow by restricting the\nspanwise channel width to be of the order of a few hundred viscous units.\nRecently, Chung et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 773, 2015, pp. 418-431) showed\nthat a minimal-span channel can accurately characterise the hydraulic behaviour\nof roughness. Following this, we aim to investigate the fundamental dynamics of\nthe minimal-span channel framework with an eye towards further improving\nperformance. The streamwise domain length of the channel is investigated with\nthe minimum length found to be three times the spanwise width or 1000 viscous\nunits, whichever is longer. A half-height (open) channel with slip wall is\nshown to reproduce the near-wall behaviour seen in a standard channel, but with\nhalf the number of grid points. Next, a forcing model is introduced into the\nouter layer of a half-height channel to reduce the high streamwise velocity.\nFinally, an investigation is conducted to see if varying the roughness Reynolds\nnumber with time is a feasible method for obtaining the full hydraulic\nbehaviour of a rough surface. An empirical costing argument is developed to\ndetermine the cost in terms of CPU hours of minimal-span channel simulations a\npriori. This argument involves counting the number of eddy lifespans in the\nchannel, which is then related to the statistical uncertainty of the streamwise\nvelocity. For a given statistical uncertainty in the roughness function, this\ncan then be used to determine the simulation run time. Following this, a\nfinite-volume code with a body-fitted grid is used to determine the roughness\nfunction for square-based pyramids using the above insights. Good agreement\nwith the literature for the same roughness geometry is observed.\n", "  The 5D Holographic Big Bang is a novel model for the emergence of the early\nuniverse out of a 5D collapsing star (an apparent white hole), in the context\nof Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) cosmology. The model does not have a big bang\nsingularity, and yet can address cosmological puzzles that are traditionally\nsolved within inflationary cosmology. In this paper, we compute the exact power\nspectrum of cosmological curvature perturbations due to the effect of a thin\natmosphere accreting into our 3-brane. The spectrum is scale-invariant on small\nscales and red on intermediate scales, but becomes blue on scales larger than\nthe height of the atmosphere. While this behaviour is broadly consistent with\nthe non-parametric measurements of the primordial scalar power spectrum, it is\nmarginally disfavoured relative to a simple power law (at 2.7$\\sigma$ level).\nFurthermore, we find that the best fit nucleation temperature of our 3-brane is\nat least 3 orders of magnitude larger than the 5D Planck mass, suggesting an\norigin in a 5D quantum gravity phase.\n", "  An easily constructed and operated polarimeter precisely determines the\nrelative Stokes parameters that characterize the polarization of laser light.\nThe polarimeter is calibrated in situ without removing or realigning its\noptical elements, and it is largely immune to fluctuations in the laser beam\nintensity. The polarimeter's usefulness is illustrated by measuring\nthermally-induced birefringence in the indium-tin-oxide coated glass field\nplates used to produce a static electric field in the ACME collaboration's\nmeasurement of the electron electric dipole moment.\n", "  A Bayesian approach is proposed for pulse shape discrimination of photons and\nneutrons in liquid organic scinitillators. Instead of drawing a decision\nboundary, each pulse is assigned a photon or neutron confidence probability.\nThis allows for photon and neutron classification on an event-by-event basis.\nThe sum of those confidence probabilities is used to estimate the number of\nphoton and neutron instances in the data. An iterative scheme, similar to an\nexpectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures, is used to infer the\nratio of photons-to-neutrons in each measurement. Therefore, the probability\nspace adapts to data with varying photon-to-neutron ratios. A time-correlated\nmeasurement of Am-Be and separate measurements of $^{137}$Cs, $^{60}$Co and\n$^{232}$Th photon sources were used to construct libraries of neutrons and\nphotons. These libraries were then used to produce synthetic data sets with\nvarying ratios of photons-to-neutrons. Probability weighted method that we\nimplemented was found to maintain neutron acceptance rate of up to 90% up to\nphoton-to-neutron ratio of 2000, and performed 9% better than decision boundary\napproach. Furthermore, the iterative approach appropriately changed the\nprobability space with an increasing number of photons which kept the neutron\npopulation estimate from unrealistically increasing.\n", "  We give a number theoretic proof of the integrality of certain BPS invariants\nof knots. The formulas for these numbers are sums involving binomial\ncoefficients and the M\\\"obius function. We also prove a conjecture about\nfurther divisibility properties of the invariants.\n", "  In the context of the so called the Chern--Simons--Antoniadis--Savvidy\n(ChSAS) forms, we use the methods for FDA decomposition in 1-forms to construct\na four-dimensional ChSAS supergravity action for the Maxwell superalgebra. On\nthe another hand, we use the Extended Cartan Homotopy Formula to find a method\nthat allows the separation of the ChSAS action into bulk and boundary\ncontributions and permits the splitting of the bulk Lagrangian into pieces that\nreflect the particular subspace structure of the gauge algebra.\n", "  In the increasing interests on spin-orbit torque (SOT) with various magnetic\nmaterials, we investigated SOT in rare earth-transition metal ferrimagnetic\nalloys. The harmonic Hall measurements were performed in Pt/GdFeCo bilayers to\nquantify the effective fields resulting from the SOT. It is found that the\ndamping-like torque rapidly increases near the magnetization compensation\ntemperature TM of the GdFeCo, which is attributed to the reduction of the net\nmagnetic moment.\n", "  We report on electrical resistivity, magnetoresistance (MR) and Hall effect\nmeasurements in four non-superconducting BaFe$_{2-x}$TM$_x$As$_2$ (TM = Mn, Cu\nand Ni) single crystals with small values of the chemical substitution $x$. The\nspin density wave (SDW) ordering that occurs in these systems at temperatures\n$T\\sim$ (120 - 140) K, in close vicinity to a tetragonal/orthorhombic\ntransition, produces significant modifications in their magneto-transport\nproperties. While in the magnetically ordered phase the MR is positive and its\nmagnitude increases with decreasing temperatures, in the paramagnetic regime\nthe MR becomes vanishingly small. Above the spin density wave transition\ntemperature ($T_{\\text{SDW}}$) the Hall coefficient $R_H$ is negative, small\nand weakly temperature dependent, but a remarkable change of slope occurs in\nthe $R_H$ versus $T$ curves at $T = T_{\\text{SDW}}$. The Hall coefficient\namplitude, while remaining negative, increases steadily and significantly as\nthe temperature is decreased below $T_{\\text{SDW}}$ and down to $T =$ 20 K. The\nqualitative behavior of both MR and Hall coefficient is weakly dependent on the\nchemical substitution in the studied limit. The experiments provide strong\nevidence that scattering of charge carriers by magnetic excitations has to be\ntaken into account to explain the behavior of the resistivity,\nmagnetoresistance and Hall effect in the ordered phase of the studied\ncompounds. Effects of multiple band conduction also must be considered for a\ncomplete interpretation of the results.\n", "  We describe a method to detect twin-beam multiphoton entanglement based on a\nbeam splitter and weak nonlinearities. For the twin-beam four-photon\nentanglement, we explore a symmetry detector. It works not only for collecting\ntwo-pair entangled states directly from the spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion process, but also for purifying them by cascading these\nsymmetry detectors. Surprisingly, by calculating the iterative coefficient and\nthe success probability we show that with a few iterations the desired two-pair\ncan be obtained from a class of four-photon entangled states. We then\ngeneralize the symmetry detector to $n$-pair emissions and show that it is\ncapable of determining the number of the pairs emitted indistinguishably from\nthe spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, which may contribute to\nexplore multipair entanglement with a large number of photons.\n", "  Materials with formula of A2B2O7 is a famous family with more than 300\ncompounds, and have abundant properties, like ferroelectric, multiferroic, and\nphotocatalyst properties, etc. Generally, two structures dominate this family,\nwhich are pyrochlore and perovskite-like layered (PL) structure. Previously,\nthe structure and properties design of these materials are usually complex, and\nsolid solutions, which complicates the manufacture, as well as introducing\ncomplexity in the study of the microscopic origins of the properties. Here, we\nreport that the pyrochlore-PL structure change happened in pure Eu2Ti2O7 under\nhigh pressure and temperature, and the formed PL structure will transfer back\nby heating. These results reveal that the PL structure formed in PL-pyrochlore\nsolid solutions, is due to tuning of the high-pressure formed PL structure in\npure pyrochlore compounds to ambient pressure. These results indicate the high\npressure and high temperature can be used to manipulate the crystal structures\nfrom pyrochlore to PL structure, or vice versa. Furthermore, the PL Eu2Ti2O7\nwas confirmed as a lead free ferroelectric material for the first time.\n", "  We study the thermal transport properties of the one dimensional\nFermi-Pasta-Ulam model ($\\beta$-type) with long-range interactions. The\nstrength of the long-range interaction decreases with the (shortest) distance\nbetween the lattice sites as ${distance}^{-\\delta}$, where $\\delta \\ge 0$.Two\nLangevin heat baths at unequal temperatures are connected to the ends of the\none dimensional lattice via short-range harmonic interactions that drive the\nsystem away from thermal equilibrium. In the nonequilibrium steady state the\nheat current, thermal conductivity and temperature profiles are computed by\nsolving the equations of motion numerically. It is found that the conductivity\n$\\kappa$ has an interesting non-monotonic dependence with $\\delta$ with a\nmaximum at $\\delta = 2.0$ for this model. Moreover, at $\\delta = 2.0$, $\\kappa$\ndiverges almost linearly with system size $N$ and the temperature profile has a\nnegligible slope, as one expects in ballistic transport for an integrable\nsystem. We demonstrate that the non-monotonic behavior of the conductivity and\nthe nearly ballistic thermal transport at $\\delta = 2.0$ obtained under\nnonequilibrium conditions can be explained consistently by studying the\nvariation of largest Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda_{max}$ with $\\delta$, and\nexcess energy diffusion in the equilibrium microcanonical system.\n", "  PbTiO3 has the highest tetragonal distortion (c/a=1.064) and highest\nspontaneous polarization among perovskite titanates. But, it is hazardous and\nhence one needs to reduce Pb content by substituting or reducing Pb content for\nuse in applications. Pb(1-x)(K0.5Sm0.5)xTiO3 (0&x&0.5) perovskite powders were\nsynthesized by sol-gel process, where Pb2+ was replaced by a combination of\nK+10.5Sm+30.5 (equivalent charge and comparable ionic radius) providing an\nexcellent substitution model to study changes in structural and electrical\nproperties. Vibrational properties and dielectric properties are modified with\nsubstitution. A polar tetragonal to a nearly nonpolar cubic phase transition\ndecreases to lower temperatures with substitution due to reduces the lattice\nstrain with substitution. Ferroelectricity is retained even for x=0.5, which\nhas a nearly cubic phase and makes the material technologically important.\n", "  The intersecting pedestrian flow on the 2D lattice with random update rule is\nstudied. Each pedestrian has three moving directions without the back step.\nUnder periodic boundary conditions, an intermediate phase has been found at\nwhich some pedestrians could move along the border of jamming stripes. We have\nperformed mean field analysis for the moving and intermediate phase\nrespectively. The analytical results agree with the simulation results well.\nThe empty site moves along the interface of jamming stripes when the system\nonly has one empty site. The average movement of empty site in one Monte Carlo\nstep (MCS) has been analyzed through the master equation. Under open boundary\nconditions, the system exhibits moving and jamming phases. The critical\ninjection probability $\\alpha_c$ shows nontrivially against the forward moving\nprobability $q$. The analytical results of average velocity, the density and\nthe flow rate against the injection probability in the moving phase also agree\nwith simulation results well.\n", "  The spirally arranged stems of the spikemoss Selaginella lepidophylla, an\nancient resurrection plant, compactly curl into a nest-ball shape upon\ndehydration. Due to its spiral phyllotaxy, older outer stems on the plant\ninterlace and envelope the younger inner stems forming the plant centre. Stem\ncurling is a morphological mechanism that limits photoinhibitory and thermal\ndamages the plant might experience in arid environments. Here, we investigate\nthe distinct conformational changes of outer and inner stems of S. lepidophylla\ntriggered by dehydration. Outer stems bend into circular rings in a relatively\nshort period of desiccation, whereas inner stems curl slowly into spirals due\nto hydro-actuated strain gradient along their length. This arrangement eases\nboth the tight packing of the plant during desiccation and its fast opening\nupon rehydration. The insights gained from this work shed light on the\nhydro-responsive movements in plants and might contribute to the development of\ndeployable structures with remarkable shape transformations in response to\nenvironmental stimuli.\n", "  We study the growth of degrees in many autonomous and non-autonomous lattice\nequations defined by quad rules with corner boundary values, some of which are\nknown to be integrable by other characterisations. Subject to an enabling\nconjecture, we prove polynomial growth for a large class of equations which\nincludes the Adler-Bobenko-Suris equations and Viallet's $Q_V$ and its\nnon-autonomous generalization. Our technique is to determine the ambient degree\ngrowth of the projective version of the lattice equations and to conjecture the\ngrowth of their common factors at each lattice vertex, allowing the true degree\ngrowth to be found. The resulting degrees satisfy a linear partial difference\nequation which is universal, i.e. the same for all the integrable lattice\nequations considered. When we take periodic reductions of these equations,\nwhich includes staircase initial conditions, we obtain from this linear partial\ndifference equation an ordinary difference equation for degrees that implies\nquadratic or linear degree growth. We also study growth of degree of several\nnon-integrable lattice equations. Exponential growth of degrees of these\nequations, and their mapping reductions, is also proved subject to a\nconjecture.\n", "  The Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has\ncollected the largest ever sample of high-energy cosmic-ray electron and\npositron events since the beginning of its operation. Potential anisotropies in\nthe arrival directions of cosmic-ray electrons or positrons could be a\nsignature of the presence of nearby sources. We use almost seven years of data\nwith energies above 42 GeV processed with the Pass~8 reconstruction. The\npresent data sample can probe dipole anisotropies down to a level of $10^{-3}$.\nWe take into account systematic effects that could mimic true anisotropies at\nthis level. We present a detailed study of the event selection optimization of\nthe cosmic-ray electrons and positrons to be used for anisotropy searches.\nSince no significant anisotropies have been detected on any angular scale, we\npresent upper limits on the dipole anisotropy. The present constraints are\namong the strongest to date probing the presence of nearby young and\nmiddle-aged sources.\n", "  This document describes the new Numerical Relativity (NR) injection\ninfrastructure in the LIGO Algorithms Library (LAL), which henceforth allows\nfor the usage of NR waveforms as a discrete waveform approximant in LAL. With\nthis new interface, NR waveforms provided in the described format can directly\nbe used as simulated GW signals (\"injections\") for data analyses, which include\nparameter estimation, searches, hardware injections etc. As opposed to the\nprevious infrastructure, this new interface natively handles sub-dominant modes\nand waveforms from numerical simulations of precessing binary black holes,\nmaking them directly accessible to LIGO analyses. To correctly handle\nprecessing simulations, the new NR injection infrastructure internally\ntransforms the NR data into the coordinate frame convention used in LAL.\n", "  In this report a wind tunnel is described in term of its design, its\nconstruction as well as in its validation of flow features. This wind tunnel is\ncharacterized by a new unconventional design. The innovative design allows an\nunusual long flow test section (in particular important for turbulence\nresearch) relative to the total size of the wind tunnel. Thus, the new design\nenables a much better use of space in comparison to a wind tunnel with\nconventional design. The design is characterized by two strong expansions of\nflow, namely a wide angle diffusor and strong expanding corner. Among other\nthings, investigations about these flow expanding components enlarge the\nexisting knowledge and show new possibilities.\n", "  Kitaev quantum spin liquid is a topological magnetic quantum state\ncharacterized by Majorana fermions of fractionalized spin excitations, which\nare identical to their own antiparticles. Here, we demonstrate emergence of\nMajorana fermions thermally fractionalized in the Kitaev honeycomb spin lattice\n{\\alpha}-RuCl3. The specific heat data unveil the characteristic two-stage\nrelease of magnetic entropy involving localized and itinerant Majorana\nfermions. The inelastic neutron scattering results further corroborate these\ntwo distinct fermions by exhibiting quasielastic excitations at low energies\naround the Brillouin zone center and Y-shaped magnetic continuum at high\nenergies, which are evident for the ferromagnetic Kitaev model. Our results\nprovide an opportunity to build a unified conceptual framework of\nfractionalized excitations, applicable also for the quantum Hall states,\nsuperconductors, and frustrated magnets.\n", "  Fast liquid jets, called micro-jets, are produced within cavitation bubbles\nexperiencing an aspherical collapse. Here we review micro-jets of different\norigins, scales and appearances, and propose a unified framework to describe\ntheir dynamics by using an anisotropy parameter $\\zeta$, representing a\ndimensionless measure of the liquid momentum at the collapse point (Kelvin\nimpulse). This parameter is rigorously defined for various jet drivers,\nincluding gravity and nearby boundaries. Combining theoretical considerations\nwith hundreds of high-speed visualisations of bubbles collapsing near a rigid\nsurface, near a free surface or in variable gravity, we classify the jets into\nthree distinct regimes: weak, intermediate and strong. Weak jets\n($\\zeta<10^{-3}$) hardly pierce the bubble, but remain within it throughout the\ncollapse and rebound. Intermediate jets ($10^{-3}<\\zeta<0.1$) pierce the\nopposite bubble wall close to the last collapse phase and clearly emerge during\nthe rebound. Strong jets ($\\zeta>0.1$) pierce the bubble early during the\ncollapse. The dynamics of the jets is analysed through key observables, such as\nthe jet impact time, jet speed, bubble displacement, bubble volume at jet\nimpact and vapour-jet volume. We find that, upon normalising these observables\nto dimensionless jet parameters, they all reduce to straightforward functions\nof $\\zeta$, which we can reproduce numerically using potential flow theory. An\ninteresting consequence of this result is that a measurement of a single\nobservable, such as the bubble displacement, suffices to estimate any other\nparameter, such as the jet speed. Remarkably, the dimensionless parameters of\nintermediate and weak jets only depend on $\\zeta$, not on the jet driver. In\nthe same regime, the jet parameters are found to be well approximated by\npower-laws of $\\zeta$, which we explain through analytical arguments.\n", "  We present a method to recover the gas-phase metallicity gradients from\nintegral field spectroscopic (IFS) observations of barely resolved galaxies. We\ntake a forward modelling approach and compare our models to the observed\nspatial distribution of emission line fluxes, accounting for the degrading\neffects of seeing and spatial binning. The method is flexible and is not\nlimited to particular emission lines or instruments. We test the model through\ncomparison to synthetic observations and use downgraded observations of nearby\ngalaxies to validate this work. As a proof of concept we also apply the model\nto real IFS observations of high-redshift galaxies. From our testing we show\nthat the inferred metallicity gradients and central metallicities are fairly\ninsensitive to the assumptions made in the model and that they are reliably\nrecovered for galaxies with sizes approximately equal to the half width at half\nmaximum of the point-spread function. However, we also find that the presence\nof star forming clumps can significantly complicate the interpretation of\nmetallicity gradients in moderately resolved high-redshift galaxies. Therefore\nwe emphasize that care should be taken when comparing nearby well-resolved\nobservations to high-redshift observations of partially resolved galaxies.\n", "  We report on the effect of the strong spin orbit coupling and the Lorentz\nforce on the efficiency of TiO2 based dye sensitized solar cells. Upon\ninclusion of Ho2O3, due to the strong spin orbit coupling of the rare earth\nHo3+ ion, we do see 13 percent enhancement in the efficiency. We attribute such\nan enhancement in power conversion efficiency to the increased lifetime of the\nphoto-excited excitons. Essentially, a Ho3+ ion accelerates the phenomenon of\nthe spin rephasing or the intersystem crossing of the excitons in a\nphotosensitizer. Increase in the absorbance and decrease in the\nphotoluminescence intensity suggests a decrease in the recombination rate,\nhinting an enhanced charge transport and is in accordance with our\nelectrochemical impedance spectra and the J V characteristics. From the above\nwe strongly believe that enhanced efficiency of the device is due to increased\nintersystem crossing which would accelerate the exciton dissociation. On top of\nspin orbit interaction, a configuration where the electric and magnetic fields\nare perpendicular to each other helped in enhancing the efficiency by 16\npercent, suggesting that the Lorentz force also plays a dominant role in\ncontrolling the charge transport of the photo-generated charge carriers. We\nstrongly believe that this simple and novel strategy of improving the\nefficiency may pave the way for realizing higher efficiency dye sensitized\nsolar cells.\n", "  Virtual heart models have been proposed to enhance the safety of implantable\ncardiac devices through closed loop validation. To communicate with a virtual\nheart, devices have been driven by cardiac signals at specific sites. As a\nresult, only the action potentials of these sites are sensed. However, the real\ndevice implanted in the heart will sense a complex combination of near and\nfar-field extracellular potential signals. Therefore many device functions,\nsuch as blanking periods and refractory periods, are designed to handle these\nunexpected signals. To represent these signals, we develop an intracardiac\nelectrogram (IEGM) model as an interface between the virtual heart and the\ndevice. The model can capture not only the local excitation but also far-field\nsignals and pacing afterpotentials. Moreover, the sensing controller can\nspecify unipolar or bipolar electrogram (EGM) sensing configurations and\nintroduce various oversensing and undersensing modes. The simulation results\nshow that the model is able to reproduce clinically observed sensing problems,\nwhich significantly extends the capabilities of the virtual heart model in the\ncontext of device validation.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials are composed of atomically thin crystals with\nan enormous surface-to-volume ratio, and their physical properties can be\neasily subjected to the change of the chemical environment. Encapsulation with\nother layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride, is a common practice;\nhowever, this approach often requires inextricable fabrication processes.\nAlternatively, it is intriguing to explore methods to control transport\nproperties in the circumstance of no encapsulated layer. This is very\nchallenging because of the ubiquitous presence of adsorbents, which can lead to\ncharged-impurity scattering sites, charge traps, and recombination centers.\nHere, we show that the short-circuit photocurrent originated from the built-in\nelectric field at the MoS2 junction is surprisingly insensitive to the gaseous\nenvironment over the range from a vacuum of 1X10^(-6) Torr to ambient\ncondition. The environmental insensitivity of the short-circuit photocurrent is\nattributed to the characteristic of the diffusion current that is associated\nwith the gradient of carrier density. Conversely, the photocurrent with bias\nexhibits typical persistent photoconductivity and greatly depends on the\ngaseous environment. The observation of environment-insensitive short-circuit\nphotocurrent demonstrates an alternative method to design device structure for\n2D-material-based optoelectronic applications.\n", "  Collisional absorption of laser light in a homogeneous, under-dense plasma is\nstudied by a new particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation code considering\none-dimensional slab-plasma geometry. Coulomb collisions between charge\nparticles in plasma are modeled by a Monte Carlo scheme. %[J. Comput. Phys.\n{\\bf 25}, 205 (1977)]. %Both PIC and MC parts are individually benchmarked. For\na given target thickness of a few times the wavelength of 800~nm laser of\nintensity $\\I0$, fractional absorption ($\\alpha$) of light due to Coulomb\ncollisions (mainly between electrons and ions) is calculated at different\nelectron temperature $\\Te$ by introducing a total velocity $v = \\sqrt{\\vth^2 +\n\\v0^2}$ dependent Coulomb logarithm $\\ln\\Lambda(v)$, where $\\vth$, and $\\v0$\nare thermal and ponderomotive velocity of an electron. It is found that, in the\nlow temperature regime ($\\Te\\lesssim15$~eV), fractional absorption of light\nanomalously increases with increasing $I_0$ up to a maximum corresponding to an\nintensity $I_c$, and then it drops when $I_0>I_c$. %(approximately) obeying the\nconventional scaling, i.e., %$\\alpha \\propto I_0^{-3/2}$ when $I_0>I_c$. Such\nan anomalous variation of $\\alpha$ with $I_0$ in the low intensity regime was\ndemonstrated earlier in experiments, and recently explained by classical and\nquantum models [Phys. Plasmas {\\bf 21}, 013302 (2014); Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 91},\n043102 (2015)]. % using the total velocity dependent cut-offs. %Here, we report\nanomalous nature of laser absorption by Here, for the first time, we report\nanomalous collisional laser absorption by %PIC simulations assisted by Monte\nCarlo collisions, PIC simulations, thus bridging the gap between models,\nsimulations, and experimental findings.\n", "  We are developing a compact UV Imager using light weight components, that can\nbe flown on a small CubeSat or a balloon platform. The system has a lens-based\noptics that can provide an aberration-free image over a wide field of view. The\nbackend instrument is a photon counting detector with off-the-shelf MCP, CMOS\nsensor and electronics. We are using a Z-stack MCP with a compact high voltage\npower supply and a phosphor screen anode, which is read out by a CMOS sensor\nand the associated electronics. The instrument can be used to observe solar\nsystem objects and detect bright transients from the upper atmosphere with the\nhelp of CubeSats or high altitude balloons. We have designed the imager to be\ncapable of working in direct frame transfer mode as well in the photon-counting\nmode for single photon event detection. The identification and centroiding of\neach photon event are done using an FPGA-based data acquisition and real-time\nprocessing system.\n", "  The working principle of ordinary refractive lenses can be explained in terms\nof the space-variant optical phase retardations they introduce, which reshape\nthe optical wavefront curvature and hence affect the subsequent light\npropagation. These phases, in turn, are due to the varying optical path length\nseen by light at different transverse positions relative to the lens centre. A\nsimilar lensing behavior can however be obtained when the optical phases are\nintroduced by an entirely different mechanism. Here, we consider the \"geometric\nphases\" that arise from the polarization transformations occurring in\nanisotropic optical media, named after Pancharatnam and Berry. The medium\nanisotropy axis is taken to be space-variant in the transverse plane and the\nresulting varying geometric phases give rise to the wavefront reshaping and\nlensing effect, which however depends also on the input polarization. We\ndescribe the realization and characterization of a cylindrical geometric-phase\nlens that is converging for a given input circular polarization state and\ndiverging for the orthogonal one, which provides one of the simplest possible\nexamples of optical element based on geometric phases. The demonstrated lens is\nflat and only few microns thick (not including the supporting substrates);\nmoreover, its working wavelength can be tuned and the lensing can be switched\non and off by the action of an external control electric field. Other kinds of\nlenses or more general phase elements inducing different wavefront distortions\ncan be obtained by a similar approach. Besides their potential for\noptoelectronic technology, these devices offer good opportunities for\nintroducing college-level students to an advanced topic of modern physics, such\nas the Berry phase, with the help of interesting optical demonstrations.\n", "  In this note we adress the problem of performing the semiclassical expansion\nof the scalar product of Bethe states in the case of the XXZ spin chain. Our\napproach closely follows the one developped in [1]: after expressing the scalar\nproducts in terms of a central quantity - the B functional, we reinterpret it\nas a grand partition function of a gas of particles with pairwise interaction\npotential. This work has been done as part of the author's master thesis under\nthe supervision of Ivan Kostov and Didina Serban at Institut de Physique\nTh\\'eorique (CEA Saclay) in September 2015 - February 2016, and present a\nconsice summary of the results obtained at that time.\n", "  Optical orientation of localized/bound excitons is shown to be effectively\nenhanced by the application of magnetic fields as low as 20 mT in monolayer\nWS$_2$. At low temperatures, the evolution of the polarization degree of\ndifferent emission lines of monolayer WS$_2$ with increasing magnetic fields is\nanalyzed and compared to similar results obtained on a WSe$_2$ monolayer. We\nstudy the temperature dependence of this effect up to $T=60$ K for both\nmaterials, focusing on the dynamics of the valley pseudospin relaxation. A rate\nequation model is used to analyze our data and from the analysis of the width\nof the polarization deep in magnetic field we conclude that the competition\nbetween the dark exciton pseudospin relaxation and the decay of the dark\nexciton population into the localized states are rather different in these two\nmaterials which are representative of the two extreme cases for the ratio of\nrelaxation rate and depolarization rate.\n", "  The layered cuprate Bi$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ is investigated using magnetic,\ndielectric and pyroelectric measurements. This system is observed to be an\nimproper multiferroic, with a robust ferroelectric state being established near\nthe magnetic transition. Magnetic and dielectric measurements indicate the\npresence of a region above the antiferromagnetic Neel temperature with\nconcomitant polar and magnetic short range order. Bi$_{2}$CuO$_{4}$ is also\nseen to exhibit colossal dielectric constants at higher temperatures with\nclearly distinguishable grain and grain boundary contributions, both of which\nexhibit non-Debye relaxation.\n", "  The unavoidable and irreversible interaction between an entangled quantum\nsystem and its environment causes decoherence of the individual qubits as well\nas degradation of the entanglement between them. Entanglement sudden death\n(ESD) is the phenomenon wherein disentanglement happens in finite time even\nwhen individual qubits decohere only asymptotically in time due to noise.\nProlonging the entanglement is essential for the practical realization of\nentanglement-based quantum information and computation protocols. For this\npurpose, the local NOT operation in the computational basis on one or both\nqubits has been proposed. Here, we formulate an all-optical experimental set-up\ninvolving such NOT operations that can hasten, delay, or completely avert ESD,\nall depending on when it is applied during the process of decoherence.\nAnalytical expressions for these are derived in terms of parameters of the\ninitial state's density matrix, whether for pure or mixed entangled states.\nAfter a discussion of the schematics of the experiment, the problem is\ntheoretically analyzed, and simulation results of such manipulations of ESD are\npresented.\n", "  In this brief review we discuss the transient processes in solids under\nirradiation with femtosecond X-ray free-electron-laser (FEL) pulses and\nswift-heavy ions (SHI). Both kinds of irradiation produce highly excited\nelectrons in a target on extremely short timescales. Transfer of the excess\nelectronic energy into the lattice may lead to observable target modifications\nsuch as phase transitions and damage formation. Transient kinetics of material\nexcitation and relaxation under FEL or SHI irradiation are comparatively\ndiscussed. The same origin for the electronic and atomic relaxation in both\ncases is demonstrated. Differences in these kinetics introduced by the\ngeometrical effects ({\\mu}m-size of a laser spot vs nm-size of an ion track)\nand initial irradiation (photoabsorption vs an ion impact) are analyzed. The\nbasic mechanisms of electron transport and electron-lattice coupling are\naddressed. Appropriate models and their limitations are presented.\nPossibilities of thermal and nonthermal melting of materials under FEL and SHI\nirradiation are discussed.\n", "  Dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way appear to be gravitationally bound,\nbut their stars' orbital motion seems too fast to allow this given their\nvisible mass. This is akin to the larger-scale galaxy rotation problem. In this\npaper, a modification of inertia called quantised inertia or MiHsC (Modified\ninertia due to a Hubble-scale Casimir effect) which correctly predicts larger\ngalaxy rotations without dark matter is tested on eleven dwarf satellite\ngalaxies of the Milky Way, for which mass and velocity data are available.\nQuantised inertia slightly outperforms MoND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) in\npredicting the velocity dispersion of these systems, and has the fundamental\nadvantage over MoND that it does not need an adjustable parameter.\n", "  The numerical integration plays a fundamental role in understanding the\nbehaviour of many mechanical systems. In this paper some important aspects of\nthe mechanical integrators on the dynamics of a mechanical system are studied.\nMore specific, we have shown that if that the Lie-Trotter integrator is\nobtained, in case of Euler equations for the dynamics of symmetric free rigid\nbody, then it is a Poisson integrator. At the end of the paper some important\nremarks are presented.\n", "  Nanoscale, single-asperity wear of single-crystal silicon carbide (sc-SiC)\nand nanocrystalline silicon carbide (nc-SiC) is investigated using\nsingle-crystal diamond nanoindenter tips and nanocrystalline diamond atomic\nforce microscopy (AFM) tips under dry conditions, and the wear behavior is\ncompared to that of single-crystal silicon with both thin and thick native\noxide layers. We discovered a transition in the relative wear resistance of the\nSiC samples compared to that of Si as a function of contact size. With larger\nnanoindenter tips (tip radius around 370 nm), the wear resistances of both\nsc-SiC and nc-SiC are higher than that of Si. This result is expected from the\nArchard's equation because SiC is harder than Si. However, with the smaller AFM\ntips (tip radius around 20 nm), the wear resistances of sc-SiC and nc-SiC are\nlower than that of Si, despite the fact that the contact pressures are\ncomparable to those applied with the nanoindenter tips, and the plastic zones\nare well-developed in both sets of wear experiments. We attribute the decrease\nin the relative wear resistance of SiC compared to that of Si to a transition\nfrom a wear regime dominated by the materials' resistance to plastic\ndeformation (i.e., hardness) to a regime dominated by the materials' resistance\nto interfacial shear. This conclusion is supported by our AFM studies of\nwearless friction, which reveal that the interfacial shear strength of SiC is\nhigher than that of Si. The contributions of surface roughness and surface\nchemistry to differences in interfacial shear strength are also discussed.\n", "  We present maps of the column densities of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, and CO ices\ntowards the molecular cores B~35A, DC~274.2-00.4, BHR~59, and DC~300.7-01.0.\nThese ice maps, probing spatial distances in molecular cores as low as 2200~AU,\nchallenge the traditional hypothesis that the denser the region observed, the\nmore ice is present, providing evidence that the relationships between solid\nmolecular species are more varied than the generic picture we often adopt to\nmodel gas-grain chemical processes and explain feedback between solid phase\nprocesses and gas phase abundances. We present the first combined solid-gas\nmaps of a single molecular species, based upon observations of both CO ice and\ngas phase C$^{18}$O towards B~35A, a star-forming dense core in Orion. We\nconclude that molecular species in the solid phase are powerful tracers of\n\"small scale\" chemical diversity, prior to the onset of star formation. With a\ncomponent analysis approach, we can probe the solid phase chemistry of a region\nat a level of detail greater than that provided by statistical analyses or\ngeneric conclusions drawn from single pointing line-of-sight observations\nalone.\n", "  We study the hotspots of powerful radiogalaxies, where electrons accelerated\nat the jet termination shock emit synchrotron radiation. The turnover of the\nsynchrotron spectrum is typically observed between infrared and optical\nfrequencies, indicating that the maximum energy of non-thermal electrons\naccelerated at the shock is ~TeV for a canonical magnetic field of ~100 micro\nGauss. We show that this maximum energy cannot be constrained by synchrotron\nlosses as usually assumed, unless the jet density is unreasonably large and\nmost of the jet upstream energy goes to non-thermal particles. We test this\nresult by considering a sample of hotspots observed at radio, infrared and\noptical wavelengths.\n", "  We report on X-ray studies of freely suspended hexatic films of three\ndifferent liquid crystal compounds. By applying angular X-ray cross-correlation\nanalysis (XCCA) to the measured diffraction patterns the parameters of the\nbond-orientational (BO) order in the hexatic phase were directly determined.\nThe temperature evolution of the BO order parameters was analyzed on the basis\nof the multicritical scaling theory (MCST). Our results confirmed the validity\nof the MCST in the whole temperature range of existence of the hexatic phase\nfor all three compounds. The temperature dependence of the BO order parameters\nin the vicinity of the hexatic-smectic transition was fitted by a conventional\npower law with a critical exponent $\\beta\\approx0.1$ of extremely small value.\nWe found that the temperature dependence of higher order harmonics of the BO\norder scales as the powers of the first harmonic, with exponent equal to\nharmonic number. This indicates a nonlinear coupling of the BO order parameters\nof different order. It is shown that compounds of various composition,\npossessing different phase sequences, display the same thermodynamic behavior\nin the hexatic phase and in the vicinity of the smectic-hexatic phase\ntransition.\n", "  A central characteristic of living beings is the ability to learn from and\nrespond to their environment leading to habit formation and decision making1-3.\nThis behavior, known as habituation, is universal among forms of life with a\ncentral nervous system, and interestingly observed even in single cellular\norganisms that do not possess a brain4-5. Here, we report the discovery of\nhabituation based plasticity utilizing a perovskite quantum system by dynamical\nmodulation of electron localization via reversible dopant incorporation.\nMicroscopic mechanisms and pathways that enable this organismic collective\ncharge-lattice interaction are elucidated by a combination of first-principles\ntheory, synchrotron investigations, ab-initio dynamical simulations and in-situ\nenvironmental breathing studies. We implement a new learning algorithm inspired\nfrom the conductance relaxation behavior of perovskites that naturally\nincorporates habituation and demonstrate \"learning to forget\": a key feature of\nanimal and human brains6. Most surprisingly, our results show that\nincorporating this elementary skill in learning dramatically boosts the\ncapability of artificial cognitive systems.\n", "  Biological mixtures such as the cytosol may consist of thousands of distinct\ncomponents. There is now a substantial body of evidence showing that, under\nphysiological conditions, intracellular mixtures can phase separate into\nspatially distinct regions with differing compositions. In this paper we\npresent numerical evidence indicating that such spontaneous\ncompartmentalization exploits general features of the phase diagram of a\nmulticomponent biomolecular mixture. In particular, we show that demixed\ndomains are likely to segregate when the variance in the inter-molecular\ninteraction strengths exceeds a well-defined threshold. Multiple distinct\nphases are likely to become stable under very similar conditions, which can\nthen be tuned to achieve multiphase coexistence. As a result, only minor\nadjustments to the composition of the cytosol or the strengths of the\ninter-molecular interactions are needed to regulate the formation of different\ndomains with specific compositions, implying that phase separation is a robust\nmechanism for creating spatial organization. We further predict that this\nfunctionality is only weakly affected by increasing the number of components in\nthe system. Our model therefore suggests that, for purely physico-chemical\nreasons, biological mixtures are naturally poised to undergo a small number of\ndemixing phase transitions.\n", "  We study magnetic reconnection events in a turbulent plasma within the\ntwo-fluid theory. By identifying the diffusive regions, we measure the\nreconnection rates as function of the conductivity and current sheet thickness.\nWe have found that the reconnection rate scales as the squared of the inverse\nof the current sheet's thickness and is independent of the aspect ratio of the\ndiffusive region, in contrast to other analytical, e.g. the Sweet-Parker and\nPetscheck, and numerical models. Furthermore, while the reconnection rates are\nalso proportional to the square inverse of the conductivity, the aspect ratios\nof the diffusive regions, which exhibit values in the range of $0.1-0.9$, are\nnot correlated to the latter. Our findings suggest a new expression for the\nmagnetic reconnection rate, which, after experimental verification, can provide\na further understanding of the magnetic reconnection process.\n", "  As computational astrophysics comes under pressure to become a precision\nscience, there is an increasing need to move to high accuracy schemes for\ncomputational astrophysics. Hence the need for a specialized review on higher\norder schemes for computational astrophysics.\n  The focus here is on weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes,\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes and PNPM schemes. WENO schemes are higher\norder extensions of traditional second order finite volume schemes which are\nalready familiar to most computational astrophysicists. DG schemes, on the\nother hand, evolve all the moments of the solution, with the result that they\nare more accurate than WENO schemes. PNPM schemes occupy a compromise position\nbetween WENO and PNPM schemes. They evolve an Nth order spatial polynomial,\nwhile reconstructing higher order terms up to Mth order. As a result, the\ntimestep can be larger.\n  Time-dependent astrophysical codes need to be accurate in space and time.\nThis is realized with the help of SSP-RK (strong stability preserving\nRunge-Kutta) schemes and ADER (Arbitrary DERivative in space and time) schemes.\nThe most popular approaches to SSP-RK and ADER schemes are also described.\n  The style of this review is to assume that readers have a basic understanding\nof hyperbolic systems and one-dimensional Riemann solvers. Such an\nunderstanding can be acquired from a sequence of prepackaged lectures available\nfrom http://www.nd.edu/~dbalsara/Numerical-PDE-Course. We then build on this\nunderstanding to give the reader a practical introduction to the schemes\ndescribed here. The emphasis is on computer-implementable ideas, not\nnecessarily on the underlying theory, because it was felt that this would be\nmost interesting to most computational astrophysicists.\n", "  We present HAWK-I J-band light curves of five late-type T dwarfs (T6.5-T7.5)\nwith a typical duration of four hours, and investigate the evidence for\nquasi-periodic photometric variability on intra-night timescales. Our\nphotometry reaches precisions in the range 7-20 mmag, after removing\ninstrumental systematics that correlate with sky background, seeing and\nairmass. Based upon a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis, the latest object in\nthe sample - ULAS J2321 (T7.5) - appears to show quasi-periodic variability\nwith a period of 1.64 hours and an amplitude of 3 mmag.\n  Given the low amplitude of variability and presence of systematics in our\nlightcurves, we discuss a Bayesian approach to robustly determine if\nquasi-periodic variability is present in a lightcurve affected by red noise.\nUsing this approach, we conclude that the evidence for quasi-periodic\nvariability in ULAS J2321 is not significant. As a result, we suggest that\nstudies which identify quasi-periodic variables using the false alarm\nprobability from a Lomb-Scargle periodogram are likely to over-estimate the\nnumber of variable objects, even if field stars are used to set a higher false\nalarm probability threshold. Instead we argue that a hybrid approach combining\na false alarm probability cut, followed by Bayesian model selection, is\nnecessary for robust identification of quasi-periodic variability in\nlightcurves with red noise.\n", "  Modified Gravity theories generally affect the Poisson equation and the\ngravitational slip (effective anisotropic stress) in an observable way, that\ncan be parameterized by two generic functions ($\\eta$ and $\\mu$) of time and\nspace. We bin the time dependence of these functions in redshift and present\nforecasts on each bin for future surveys like Euclid. We consider both Galaxy\nClustering and Weak Lensing surveys, showing the impact of the non-linear\nregime, treated with two different semi-analytical approximations. In addition\nto these future observables, we use a prior covariance matrix derived from the\nPlanck observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Our results show that\n$\\eta$ and $\\mu$ in different redshift bins are significantly correlated, but\nincluding non-linear scales reduces or even eliminates the correlation,\nbreaking the degeneracy between Modified Gravity parameters and the overall\namplitude of the matter power spectrum. We further decorrelate parameters with\na Zero-phase Component Analysis and identify which combinations of the Modified\nGravity parameter amplitudes, in different redshift bins, are best constrained\nby future surveys. We also extend the analysis to two particular\nparameterizations of the time evolution of $\\mu$ and $\\eta$ and consider, in\naddition to Euclid, also SKA1, SKA2, DESI: we find in this case that future\nsurveys will be able to constrain the current values of $\\eta$ and $\\mu$ at the\n$2-5\\%$ level when using only linear scales (wavevector k < 0.15 h/Mpc),\ndepending on the specific time parameterization; sensitivity improves to about\n$1\\%$ when non-linearities are included.\n", "  Analogue systems are a powerful instrument to investigate and understand in a\ncontrolled setting many general-relativistic effects. Here, we focus on\nsuperradiant-triggered instabilities and quasi-normal modes. We consider a\ncompressible hydrodynamic vortex characterized by a polytropic equation of\nstate, the {\\it polytropic hydrodynamic vortex}, a purely circulating system\nwith an ergoregion but no event horizon. We compute the quasinormal modes of\nthis system numerically with different methods, finding excellent agreement\nbetween them. When the fluid velocity is larger than the speed of sound, an\nergoregion appears in the effective spacetime, triggering an \"ergoregion\ninstability.\" We study the details of the instability for the polytropic\nvortex, and in particular find analytic expressions for the marginally-stable\nconfiguration.\n", "  Understanding how desertification takes place in different ecosystems is an\nimportant step in attempting to forecast and prevent such transitions. Dryland\necosystems often exhibit patchy vegetation, which has been shown to be an\nimportant factor on the possible regime shifts that occur in arid regions in\nseveral model studies. In particular, both gradual shifts that occur by front\npropagation, and abrupt shifts where patches of vegetation vanish at once, are\na possibility in dryland ecosystems due to their emergent spatial\nheterogeneity. However, recent theoretical work has suggested that the final\nstep of desertification - the transition from spotted vegetation to bare soil -\noccurs only as an abrupt shift, but the generality of this result, and its\nunderlying origin, remain unclear. We investigate two models that detail the\ndynamics of dryland vegetation using a markedly different functional structure,\nand find that in both models the final step of desertification can only be\nabrupt. Using a careful numerical analysis, we show that this behavior is\nassociated with the disappearance of confined spot-pattern domains as\nstationary states, and identify the mathematical origin of this behavior. Our\nfindings show that a gradual desertification to bare soil due to a front\npropagation process can not occur in these and similar models, and opens the\nquestion of whether these dynamics can take place in nature.\n"]}
