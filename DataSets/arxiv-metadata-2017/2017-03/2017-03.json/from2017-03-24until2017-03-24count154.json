Our interferometer has a readout noise spectral\ndensity (imprecision) of 3E-16 m/sqrt(Hz) at frequencies around the fundamental\nresonance of a SiN_x membrane at about 100 kHz, without using optical cavities.\nThe readout noise demonstrated is more than 16 dB below the peak value of the\nmembrane's standard quantum limit (SQL). This reduction is significantly higher\nthan those of previous works with nano-wires [Teufel et al., Nature Nano. 4,\n820 (2009); Anetsberger et al., Nature Phys. 5, 909 (2009)]. We discuss the\nmeaning of the SQL for force measurements and its relation to the readout\nperformance and conclude that neither our nor previous experiments achieved a\ntotal noise spectral density as low as the SQL.\n", "  The AEI 10 m prototype interferometer facility is currently being constructed\nat the Albert Einstein Institute in Hannover, Germany. It aims to perform\nexperiments for future gravitational wave detectors using advanced techniques.\nSeismically isolated benches are planned to be interferometrically\ninterconnected and stabilized, forming a low-noise testbed inside a 100 m^3\nultra-high vacuum system. A well-stabilized high power laser will perform\ndifferential position readout of 100 g test masses in a 10 m suspended\narm-cavity enhanced Michelson interferometer at the crossover of measurement\n(shot) noise and backaction (quantum radiation pressure) noise, the so-called\nStandard Quantum Limit (SQL). Such a sensitivity enables experiments in the\nhighly topical field of macroscopic quantum mechanics. In this article we\nintroduce the experimental facility and describe the methods employed,\ntechnical details of subsystems will be covered in future papers.\n", "  Representing graphs as quantum states is becoming an increasingly important\napproach to study entanglement of mixed states, alternate to the standard\nlinear algebraic density matrix-based approach of study. In this paper, we\npropose a general weighted directed graph framework for investigating\nproperties of a large class of quantum states which are defined by three types\nof Laplacian matrices associated with such graphs. We generalize the standard\nframework of defining density matrices from simple connected graphs to density\nmatrices using both combinatorial and signless Laplacian matrices associated\nwith weighted directed graphs with complex edge weights and with/without\nself-loops. We also introduce a new notion of Laplacian matrix, which we call\nsigned Laplacian matrix associated with such graphs. We produce necessary\nand/or sufficient conditions for such graphs to correspond to pure and mixed\nquantum states. Using these criteria, we finally determine the graphs whose\ncorresponding density matrices represent entangled pure states which are well\nknown and important for quantum computation applications. We observe that all\nthese entangled pure states share a common combinatorial structure.\n", "  We give a detailed discussion about existence and uniqueness of Lu's momentum\nmap. More precisely, we introduce the infinitesimal momentum map, and we study\nits properties. This allows us to describe the theory of reconstruction of the\nmomentum map from the infinitesimal one. We provide the conditions for the\nuniqueness of the momentum map.\n", "  We propose an experiment for the first proof of the type I electric\nAharonov-Bohm effect in an ion interferometer for hydrogen. The performances of\nthree different beam separation schemes are simulated and compared. The\ncoherent ion beam is generated by a single atom tip (SAT) source and separated\nby either two biprisms with a quadrupole lens, two biprisms with an einzel-lens\nor three biprisms. The beam path separation is necessary to introduce two metal\ntubes that can be pulsed with different electric potentials. The high time\nresolution of a delay line detector allows to work with a continuous ion beam\nand circumvents the pulsed beam operation as originally suggested by Aharonov\nand Bohm. We demonstrate, that the higher mass and therefore lower velocity of\nions compared to electrons combined with the high expected SAT ion emission\nputs the direct proof of this quantum effect for the first time into reach of\ncurrent technical possibilities. Thereby a high coherent ion detection rate is\ncrucial to avoid long integration times that allow the influence of dephasing\nnoise from the environment. We can determine the period of the expected matter\nwave interference pattern and the signal on the detector by determining the\nsuperposition angle of the coherent partial beams. Our simulations were tested\nwith an electron interferometer setup and agree with the experimental results.\nWe determine the separation scheme with three biprisms to be most efficient and\npredict a total signal acquisition time of only 80 s to measure a phase shift\nfrom 0 to 2$\\pi$ due to the electric Aharonov-Bohm effect.\n", "  Experiments with electron or ion matter waves require a coherent,\nmonochromatic and long-term stable source with high brightness. These\nrequirements are best fulfilled by single atom tip (SAT) field emitters. The\nperformance of an iridium covered W(111) SAT is demonstrated and analyzed for\nelectrons in a biprism interferometer. Furthermore we characterize the emission\nof the SAT in a separate field electron and field ion microscope and compare it\nwith other emitter types. A new method is presented to fabricate the\nelectrostatic charged biprism wire that separates and combines the matter wave.\nIn contrast to other biprism interferometers the source and the biprism size\nare well defined within a few nanometers. The setup has direct applications in\nion interferometry and Aharonov-Bohm physics.\n", "  We describe a system to transport and identify barium ions produced in liquid\nxenon, as part of R&D towards the second phase of a double beta decay\nexperiment, nEXO. The goal is to identify the Ba ion resulting from an\nextremely rare nuclear decay of the isotope $^{136}$Xe, hence providing a\nconfirmation of the occurrence of the decay. This is achieved through Resonance\nIonization Spectroscopy (RIS). In the test setup described here, Ba ions can be\nproduced in liquid xenon or vacuum and collected on a clean substrate. This\nsubstrate is then removed to an analysis chamber under vacuum, where\nlaser-induced thermal desorption and RIS are used with time-of-flight (TOF)\nmass spectroscopy for positive identification of the barium decay product.\n", "  To use quantum systems for technological applications we first need to\npreserve their coherence for macroscopic timescales, even at finite\ntemperature. Quantum error correction has made it possible to actively correct\nerrors that affect a quantum memory. An attractive scenario is the construction\nof passive storage of quantum information with minimal active support. Indeed,\npassive protection is the basis of robust and scalable classical technology,\nphysically realized in the form of the transistor and the ferromagnetic hard\ndisk. The discovery of an analogous quantum system is a challenging open\nproblem, plagued with a variety of no-go theorems. Several approaches have been\ndevised to overcome these theorems by taking advantage of their loopholes. Here\nwe review the state-of-the-art developments in this field in an informative and\npedagogical way. We give the main principles of self-correcting quantum\nmemories and we analyze several milestone examples from the literature of two-,\nthree- and higher-dimensional quantum memories.\n", "  An RF ion-funnel technique has been developed to extract ions from a\nhigh-pressure (10 bar) noble-gas environment into vacuum ($10^{-6}$ mbar).\nDetailed simulations have been performed and a prototype has been developed for\nthe purpose of extracting $^{136}$Ba ions from Xe gas with high efficiency.\nWith this prototype, ions have been extracted for the first time from\nhigh-pressure xenon gas and argon gas. Systematic studies have been carried out\nand compared to the simulations. This demonstration of extraction of ions with\nmass comparable to that of the gas generating the high-pressure into vacuum has\napplications to Ba tagging from a Xe-gas time-projection chamber (TPC) for\ndouble beta decay as well as to the general problem of recovering trace amounts\nof an ionized element in a heavy (m$>40$ u) carrier gas.\n", "  We study the Fock quantization of a compound classical system consisting of\npoint masses and a scalar field. We consider the Hamiltonian formulation of the\nmodel by using the geometric constraint algorithm of Gotay, Nester and Hinds.\nBy relying on this Hamiltonian description, we characterize in a precise way\nthe real Hilbert space of classical solutions to the equations of motion and\nuse it to rigorously construct the Fock space of the system. We finally discuss\nthe structure of this space, in particular the impossibility of writing it in a\nnatural way as a tensor product of Hilbert spaces associated with the point\nmasses and the field, respectively.\n", "  The ability to trap and guide coherent electrons is gaining importance in\nfundamental as well as in applied physics. In this regard novel quantum devices\nare currently developed that may operate under low vacuum conditions. Here we\nstudy the loss of electron coherence with increasing background gas pressure.\nThereby, optionally helium, hydrogen or nitrogen is introduced in a biprism\ninterferometer where the interference contrast is a measure for the coherence\nof the electrons. The results indicate a constant contrast that is not\ndecreasing in the examined pressure range between $10^{-9}$ mbar and $10^{-4}$\nmbar. Therefore, no decoherence was observed even under poor vacuum conditions.\nDue to scattering of the electron beam with background H$_2$-molecules a signal\nloss of 94 % was determined. The results may lower the vacuum requirements for\nnovel quantum devices with free coherent electrons.\n", "  Diffraction gratings are famous for their ability to exhibit, near a Wood\nanomaly, an arbitrarily large angular dispersion, e.g., with respect to the\nincidence angle or wavelength. For a diffraction grating under incidence by a\nplane wave at a fixed frequency, by rotating the incidence angle at a given\nangular velocity, the field propagated by a nonzero diffraction order will\nrotate at increasingly fast angular velocity as the incidence angle approaches\nthe angle where Wood anomaly occurs. Such a fast rotating diffracted field has\nthe potential to generate a substantial Doppler shift. Indeed, under the\nassumption of a grating with infinite extent, the expression for the\ninstantaneous frequency shift perceived by an observer, who is looking into the\nlight radiated by the diffraction order, is derived and it is in full agreement\nwith the prediction from an interpretation based on the Doppler shift generated\nby a rotation of light sources. In particular the classical (non-relativistic)\nDoppler shift can take arbitrarily high values as the incidence angle\napproaches a Wood anomaly. It is also found that gratings of a finite size can\nhave a similar property. In order to have a physically detectable frequency\nshift, it is important to use a grating which can maintain a significant\nreflectance into higher diffraction orders near their Wood anomaly cut-off.\nInterestingly, we have found that the geometry of the nanostructures of a\n\\emph{Morpho} butterfly wing scale is aptly suited for such a function because\nit can strongly reflect into higher diffraction orders while minimising the\nreflection into the specular order.\n", "  We study the tensor rank of the tensor corresponding to the algebra of\nn-variate complex polynomials modulo the dth power of each variable. As a\nresult we find a sequence of tensors with a large gap between rank and border\nrank, and thus a counterexample to a conjecture of Rhodes. At the same time we\nobtain a new lower bound on the tensor rank of tensor powers of the generalised\nW-state tensor. In addition, we exactly determine the tensor rank of the tensor\ncube of the three-party W-state tensor, thus answering a question of Chen et\nal.\n", "  We prove that nearest-neighbor percolation in dimensions $d\\geq 11$ displays\nmean-field behavior by proving that the infrared bound holds, in turn implying\nthe finiteness of the percolation triangle diagram. The finiteness of the\ntriangle implies the existence and mean-field values of various critical\nexponents, such as $\\gamma=1, \\beta=1, \\delta=2$. We also prove sharp $x$-space\nasymptotics for the two-point function and the existence of various arm\nexponents. Such results had previously been obtained in unpublished work by\nHara and Slade for nearest-neighbor percolation in dimension $d\\geq 19$, so\nthat we bring the dimension above which mean-field behavior is rigorously\nproved down from $19$ to $11$. Our results also imply sharp bounds on the\ncritical value of nearest-neighbor percolation on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, which are\nprovably at most $1.306\\%$ off in $d=11$. We make use of the general method\nanalyzed in the accompanying paper \"Generalized approach to the\nnon-backtracking lace expansion\" by Fitzner and van der Hofstad, which proposes\nto use a lace expansion perturbing around non-backtracking random walk. This\nproof is {\\em computer-assisted}, relying on (1) rigorous numerical upper\nbounds on various simple random walk integrals as proved by Hara and Slade\n(1992) and (2) a verification that the derived numerical conditions hold true.\nThese two ingredients are implemented in two Mathematica notebooks that can be\ndownloaded from the website of the first author. The main steps of this paper\nare (a) to derive a non-backtracking lace expansion for the percolation\ntwo-point function; (b) to bound the non-backtracking lace expansion\ncoefficients, thus showing that the general methodology applies, and (c) to\ndescribe the numerical bounds on the coefficients. In the appendix of this\nextended version, we give additional details about the bounds that are not\ngiven in the article version.\n", "  We prove a reduction theorem for the tangent bundle of a Poisson manifold\n$(M, \\pi)$ endowed with a pre-Hamiltonian action of a Poisson Lie group $(G,\n\\pi_G)$. In the special case of a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group, we are\nable to compare our reduction to the classical Marsden-Ratiu reduction of $M$.\nIf the manifold $M$ is symplectic and simply connected, the reduced tangent\nbundle is integrable and its integral symplectic groupoid is the\nMarsden-Weinstein reduction of the pair groupoid $M \\times \\bar{M}$.\n", "  The characterization of quantum coherence in the context of quantum\ninformation theory and its interplay with quantum correlations is currently\nsubject of intense study. Coherence in an Hamiltonian eigenbasis yields\nasymmetry, the ability of a quantum system to break a dynamical symmetry\ngenerated by the Hamiltonian. We here propose an experimental strategy to\nwitness multipartite entanglement in many-body systems by evaluating the\nasymmetry with respect to an additive Hamiltonian. We test our scheme by\nsimulating asymmetry and entanglement detection in a three-qubit GHZ-diagonal\nstate.\n", "  In this work we consider the Gutt star product viewed as an associative\ndeformation of the symmetric algebra S^\\bullet(g) over a Lie algebra g and\ndiscuss its continuity properties: we establish a locally convex topology on\nS^\\bullet(g) such that the Gutt star product becomes continuous. Here we have\nto assume a mild technical condition on g: it has to be an Asymptotic Estimate\nLie algebra. This condition is e.g. fulfilled automatically for all\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebras. The resulting completion of the symmetric\nalgebra can be described explicitly and yields not only a locally convex\nalgebra but also the Hopf algebra structure maps inherited from the universal\nenveloping algebra are continuous. We show that all Hopf algebra structure maps\ndepend analytically on the deformation parameter. The construction enjoys good\nfunctorial properties.\n", "  We study the Hamiltonian formulation for a parametrized electromagnetic field\nwith the purpose of clarifying the interplay between parametrization and gauge\nsymmetries. We use a geometric approach which is tailor-made for theories where\nembeddings are part of the dynamical variables. Our point of view is global and\ncoordinate free. The most important result of the paper is the identification\nof sectors in the primary constraint submanifold in the phase space of the\nmodel where the number of independent components of the Hamiltonian vector\nfields that define the dynamics changes. This explains the non-trivial behavior\nof the system and some of its pathologies.\n", "  EXO-200 is a single phase liquid xenon detector designed to search for\nneutrinoless double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe to the ground state of $^{136}$Ba.\nWe report here on a search for the two-neutrino double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe\nto the first $0^+$ excited state, $0^+_1$, of $^{136}$Ba based on a 100\nkg$\\cdot$yr exposure of $^{136}$Xe. Using a specialized analysis employing a\nmachine learning algorithm, we obtain a 90% CL half-life sensitivity of $1.7\n\\times 10^{24}$ yr. We find no statistically significant evidence for the\n$2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay to the excited state resulting in a lower limit of\n$T^{2\\nu}_{1/2}$ ($0^+ \\rightarrow 0^+_1$) $> 6.9 \\times 10^{23}$ yr at 90% CL.\nThis observed limit is consistent with the estimated half-life of\n$2.5\\times10^{25}$ yr.\n", "  The evolution of a quantum state undergoing radiative decay depends on how\nthe emission is detected. We employ phase-sensitive amplification to perform\nhomodyne detection of the spontaneous emission from a superconducting\nartificial atom. Using quantum state tomography, we characterize the\ncorrelation between the detected homodyne signal and the emitter's state, and\nmap out the conditional back-action of homodyne measurement. By tracking the\ndiffusive quantum trajectories of the state as it decays, we characterize\nselective stochastic excitation induced by the choice of measurement basis. Our\nresults demonstrate dramatic differences from the quantum jump evolution that\nis associated with photodetection and highlight how continuous field detection\ncan be harnessed to control quantum evolution.\n", "  General Relativity in 4 dimensions can be equivalently described as a\ndynamical theory of SO(3)-connections rather than metrics. We introduce the\nnotion of asymptotically hyperbolic connections, and work out an analog of the\nFefferman-Graham expansion in the language of connections. As in the metric\nsetup, one can solve the arising \"evolution\" equations order by order in the\nexpansion in powers of the radial coordinate. The solution in the connection\nsetting is arguably simpler, and very straightforward algebraic manipulations\nallow one to see how the obstruction appears at third order in the expansion.\nAnother interesting feature of the connection formulation is that the \"counter\nterms\" required in the computation of the renormalised volume all combine into\nthe Chern-Simons functional of the restriction of the connection to the\nboundary. As the Chern-Simons invariant is only defined modulo large gauge\ntransformations, the requirement that the path integral over asymptotically\nhyperbolic connections is well-defined requires the cosmological constant to be\nquantised. Finally, in the connection setting one can deform the 4D Einstein\ncondition in an interesting way, and we show that asymptotically hyperbolic\nconnection expansion is universal and valid for any of the deformed theories.\n", "  A Gribov-type dispersion relation is treated as an effective description of\ninteracting gluons forming a hot medium. Temperature dependence of the Gribov\nparameter is determined from the fit to the lattice Yang-Mills results\ndescribing thermodynamic functions. To maintain thermodynamic consistency of\nthe approach, a temperature dependent bag pressure is introduced. The results\nobtained for equilibrium functions are generalised in the next step to\nnon-equilibrium conditions. We derive formulas for the bulk and shear viscosity\ncoefficients within the relaxation time approximation. We find evidence for\nlargely enhanced bulk viscosity in the region of the phase transition.\n", "  The direct bond percolation process (Gribov process) is studied in the\npresence of irrotational velocity fluctuations with long-range correlations.\nThe perturbative renormalization group is employed in order to analyze the\neffects of finite correlation time on the long-time behavior of the phase\ntransition between an active and an ab- sorbing state. The calculation is\nperformed to the one-loop order. Stable fixed points of the renormalization\ngroup and their regions of stability are obtained within the three-parameter\n$(\\epsilon,y,\\eta)$- expansion. Different regimes corresponding to the rapid-\nchange limit and frozen velocity field are discussed.\n", "  We consider the estimation of a n-dimensional vector x from the knowledge of\nnoisy and possibility non-linear element-wise measurements of xxT , a very\ngeneric problem that contains, e.g. stochastic 2-block model, submatrix\nlocalization or the spike perturbation of random matrices. We use an\ninterpolation method proposed by Guerra and later refined by Korada and Macris.\nWe prove that the Bethe mutual information (related to the Bethe free energy\nand conjectured to be exact by Lesieur et al. on the basis of the non-rigorous\ncavity method) always yields an upper bound to the exact mutual information. We\nalso provide a lower bound using a similar technique. For concreteness, we\nillustrate our findings on the sparse PCA problem, and observe that (a) our\nbounds match for a large region of parameters and (b) that it exists a phase\ntransition in a region where the spectum remains uninformative. While we\npresent only the case of rank-one symmetric matrix estimation, our proof\ntechnique is readily extendable to low-rank symmetric matrix or low-rank\nsymmetric tensor estimation\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study the correlation between the\nground cosmic ray intensity and near-earth thunderstorms electric field at YBJ\n(4300 m a.s.l., Tibet, China). The variations of the secondary cosmic ray\nintensity are found to be highly dependent on the strength and polarity of the\nelectric field. In negative fields and in positive fields greater than 600\nV/cm, the total number of ground comic ray positrons and electrons increases\nwith increasing electric field strength. And these values increase more\nobviously when involving a shower with lower primary energy or a higher zenith\nangle. While in positive fields ranging from 0 to 600 V/cm, the total number of\nground comic ray positrons and electrons declines and the amplitude is up to\n3.1% for vertical showers. A decrease of intensity occurs for inclined showers\nin positive fields less than 500 V/cm, which is accompanied by smaller\namplitudes. In this paper, the intensity changes are discussed, especially\nconcerning the decreases in positive electric fields. Our simulation results\nare in good agreement with ground-based experimental results obtained from\nARGO-YBJ and the Carpet air shower array. These results could be helpful in\nunderstanding the acceleration mechanisms of secondary charged particles caused\nby an atmospheric electric field.\n", "  We study the integrable model with minimally and non-minimally coupled scalar\nfields and the correspondence of their general solutions. Using the model with\na minimally coupled scalar field and a the constant potential as an example we\ndemonstrate the difference between the general solutions of the corresponding\nmodels in the Jordan and the Einstein frames.\n", "  It is a pleasure to write for this 90'th anniversary volume of Journal of Low\nTemperature Physics dedicated to Horst Meyer at Duke University. I was a PhD\nstudent with Horst in the period 1975-1980, working in experimental low\ntemperature physics. While in Horst's group, I also did a theoretical physics\nproject on the side. This project in the metric geometry of thermodynamics was\nmotivated by my work in Horst's lab, and helped me to understand the theory of\ncritical phenomena, very much in play in Horst's lab. In this paper, I explain\nthe essence of my theory project and give a few accounts of its future\ndevelopment, focussing on topics where I interacted with Horst. I pay\nparticular attention to the pure fluid critical point.\n", "  The energy resolution of the EXO-200 detector is limited by electronics noise\nin the measurement of the scintillation response. Here we present a new\ntechnique to extract optimal scintillation energy measurements for signals\nsplit across multiple channels in the presence of correlated noise. The\nimplementation of these techniques improves the energy resolution of the\ndetector at the neutrinoless double beta decay Q-value from $\\left[1.9641\\pm\n0.0039\\right]\\%$ to $\\left[1.5820\\pm 0.0044\\right]\\%$.\n", "  Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate\nnonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of\nincomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power\nas general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated\nequilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of\nbelief-invariant equilibrium has appeared in game theory before, in the 1990s.\nHowever, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to\nbelief-invariance arose naturally already in the 1980s in the foundations of\nquantum mechanics.\n  Here, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above\nclasses of equilibria, and furthermore quantum correlated equilibria, using\ntools from quantum information but the language of game theory. We present a\ngeneral framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria, which contains\n(quantum) correlated equilibria as special cases. It also contains the theory\nof Bell inequalities, a question of intense interest in quantum mechanics, and\nquantum games where players have conflicting interests, a recent topic in\nphysics.\n  We then use our framework to show new results related to social welfare.\nNamely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than\ncorrelated equilibria, and one where all non-belief-invariant equilibria are\nsocially suboptimal. Then, we show that in some cases optimal social welfare is\nachieved by quantum correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be\nimplemented. Furthermore, we illustrate potential practical applications: for\ninstance, situations where competing companies can correlate without exposing\ntheir trade secrets, or where privacy-preserving advice reduces congestion in a\nnetwork. Along the way, we highlight open questions on the interplay between\nquantum information, cryptography, and game theory.\n", "  We present a proposal to search for QCD axions with mass in the 200 $\\mu$eV\nrange, assuming that they make a dominant component of dark matter. Due to the\naxion-electron spin coupling, their effect is equivalent to the application of\nan oscillating rf field with frequency and amplitude fixed by the axion mass\nand coupling respectively. This equivalent magnetic field would produce spin\nflips in a magnetic sample placed inside a static magnetic field, which\ndetermines the resonant interaction at the Larmor frequency. Spin flips would\nsubsequently emit radio frequency photons that can be detected by a suitable\nquantum counter in an ultra-cryogenic environment. This new detection technique\nis crucial to keep under control the thermal photon background which would\notherwise produce a too large noise.\n", "  In this work, we consider compressed sensing reconstruction from $M$\nmeasurements of $K$-sparse structured signals which do not possess a writable\ncorrelation model. Assuming that a generative statistical model, such as a\nBoltzmann machine, can be trained in an unsupervised manner on example signals,\nwe demonstrate how this signal model can be used within a Bayesian framework of\nsignal reconstruction. By deriving a message-passing inference for general\ndistribution restricted Boltzmann machines, we are able to integrate these\ninferred signal models into approximate message passing for compressed sensing\nreconstruction. Finally, we show for the MNIST dataset that this approach can\nbe very effective, even for $M < K$.\n", "  Factorizing low-rank matrices has many applications in machine learning and\nstatistics. For probabilistic models in the Bayes optimal setting, a general\nexpression for the mutual information has been proposed using heuristic\nstatistical physics computations, and proven in few specific cases. Here, we\nshow how to rigorously prove the conjectured formula for the symmetric rank-one\ncase. This allows to express the minimal mean-square-error and to characterize\nthe detectability phase transitions in a large set of estimation problems\nranging from community detection to sparse PCA. We also show that for a large\nset of parameters, an iterative algorithm called approximate message-passing is\nBayes optimal. There exists, however, a gap between what currently known\npolynomial algorithms can do and what is expected information theoretically.\nAdditionally, the proof technique has an interest of its own and exploits three\nessential ingredients: the interpolation method introduced in statistical\nphysics by Guerra, the analysis of the approximate message-passing algorithm\nand the theory of spatial coupling and threshold saturation in coding. Our\napproach is generic and applicable to other open problems in statistical\nestimation where heuristic statistical physics predictions are available.\n", "  A well-established observation in nuclear physics is that in neutron-rich\nspherical nuclei the distribution of neutrons extends farther than the\ndistribution of protons. In this work, we scrutinize the influence of this so\ncalled neutron-skin effect on the centrality dependence of high-$p_{\\rm T}$\ndirect-photon and charged-hadron production. We find that due to the estimated\nspatial dependence of the nuclear parton distribution functions, it will be\ndemanding to unambiguously expose the neutron-skin effect with direct photons.\nHowever, when taking a ratio between the cross sections for negatively and\npositively charged high-$p_{\\rm T}$ hadrons, even centrality-dependent\nnuclear-PDF effects cancel, making this observable a better handle on the\nneutron skin. Up to 20~\\% effects can be expected for the most peripheral\ncollisions.\n", "  By using the Coulomb gas technics we calculate the four-spin correlation\nfunction in the percolation $q\\rightarrow 1$ limit of the Potts model.\n  It is known that the four-point functions define the actual fusion rules of a\nparticular model. In this respect, we find that fusion of two spins, of\ndimension $\\Delta_{\\sigma}=\\frac{5}{96}$, produce a new channel, in the 4-point\nfunction, which is due to the operator with dimension $\\Delta=5/8$.\n", "  We study the compositeness of near-threshold states to investigate the\ninternal structure of exotic hadron candidates. Within the framework of\neffective field theory, Weinberg's weak-binding relation is extended to more\ngeneral cases by easing several preconditions. First, by evaluating the\ncontribution from the decay channel, we obtain the generalized relation for\nunstable quasibound states. Next, we generalize the relation to include the\nnearby CDD (Castillejo-Dalitz-Dyson) pole contribution with the help of the\nPade approximant. The validity of the estimation with the generalized\nweak-binding relations is examined by numerical calculations. The method to\nsystematically evaluate the error in the weak-binding relation is presented.\nFinally, by applying the extended relation to Lambda(1405), f0(980) and\na0(980), we discuss their internal structure, in comparison with other\napproaches.\n", "  We consider the estimation of a signal from the knowledge of its noisy linear\nrandom Gaussian projections, a problem relevant in compressed sensing, sparse\nsuperposition codes or code division multiple access just to cite few. There\nhas been a number of works considering the mutual information for this problem\nusing the heuristic replica method from statistical physics. Here we put these\nconsiderations on a firm rigorous basis. First, we show, using a Guerra-type\ninterpolation, that the replica formula yields an upper bound to the exact\nmutual information. Secondly, for many relevant practical cases, we present a\nconverse lower bound via a method that uses spatial coupling, state evolution\nanalysis and the I-MMSE theorem. This yields, in particular, a single letter\nformula for the mutual information and the minimal-mean-square error for random\nGaussian linear estimation of all discrete bounded signals.\n", "  Scientists use mathematical modelling to understand and predict the\nproperties of complex physical systems. In highly parameterised models there\noften exist relationships between parameters over which model predictions are\nidentical, or nearly so. These are known as structural or practical\nunidentifiabilities, respectively. They are hard to diagnose and make reliable\nparameter estimation from data impossible. They furthermore imply the existence\nof an underlying model simplification. We describe a scalable method for\ndetecting unidentifiabilities, and the functional relations defining them, for\ngeneric models. This allows for model simplification, and appreciation of which\nparameters (or functions thereof) cannot be estimated from data. Our algorithm\ncan identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale\nsubsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We\nbase our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric\nsensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric\nsensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made\nlocally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of\ninfinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between\nmultiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding\nparameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.\nFurther theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to\nthe Likelihood-ratio test. From this, we show that a local sensitivity analysis\n(as typically done) is insufficient for determining the reliability of\nparameter estimation, even with simple (non)linear systems. Our algorithm\nprovides a tractable alternative. We finally apply our methods to a\nlarge-scale, benchmark Systems Biology model of NF-$\\kappa$B, uncovering\npreviously unknown unidentifiabilities.\n", "  The increasing number of synoptic surveys made by small robotic telescopes,\nsuch as the photometric Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey (CRTS), represents\na unique opportunity for the discovery of variable sources and improves the\nstatistical samples of such classes of objects. Our goal is the discovery of\nmagnetic Cataclysmic Variables (mCVs). These are rare objects, which probe\ninteresting accretion scenarios controlled by the white dwarf magnetic field.\nIn particular, improved statistics of mCVs would help to address open questions\non their formation and evolution. We performed an optical spectroscopy survey\nto search for signatures of magnetic accretion in 45 variable objects selected\nmostly from the CRTS. In this sample we found 32 CVs, 22 being mCV candidates\nfrom which 13 are previously unreported as such. If the proposed\nclassifications are confirmed, it would represent an increase of 4% in the\nnumber of known polars and 12% in the number of known IPs. A fraction of our\ninitial sample was classified as extragalactic sources or other types of\nvariable stars by the inspection of the identification spectra. Despite the\ninherent complexity in identifying a source as a mCV, variability-based\nselection followed by spectroscopic snapshot observations has proved to be an\nefficient strategy for their discoveries, being a relatively inexpensive\napproach in terms of telescope time.\n", "  We investigate coherent transport over a finite square lattice in which the\ngrowth of bond percolation clusters are subjected to an Achlioptas type\nselection process, i.e., whether a bond will be placed or not depends on the\nsizes of clusters it may potentially connect. Different than the standard\npercolation where the growth of discrete clusters are completely random,\nclusters in this case grow in correlation with one another. We show that\ncertain values of correlation strength, if chosen in a way to suppress the\ngrowth of the largest cluster which actually results in an explosive growth\nlater on, may lead to more efficient transports than in the case of standard\npercolation, satisfied that certain fraction of total possible bonds are\npresent in the lattice. In this case transport efficiency increases as a power\nfunction of bond fraction in the vicinity of where effective transport begins.\nIt turns out that the higher correlation strengths may also reduce the\nefficiency as well. We also compare our results with those of the incoherent\ntransport and examine the average spreading of eigenstates for different bond\nfractions. In this way, we demonstrate that structural differences of discrete\nclusters due to different correlations result in different localization\nproperties.\n", "  The mass spectrum of $c\\bar{b}$ states has been obtained using the\nphenomenological relativistic quark model (RQM) with coupled channel effects.\nThe Hamiltonian used in the investigation has confinement potential and\nconfined one gluon exchange potential (COGEP). In the frame work of RQM a study\nof M1 and E1 radiative decays of $c\\bar{b}$ states has been made. The weak\ndecay widths in the spectator quark approximation have been estimated. An\noverall agreement is obtained with the experimental masses and decay widths.\n", "  Cooling atomic gases into strongly correlated quantum phases requires\nestimates of the entropy to perform thermometry and establish viability. We\nconstruct an ansatz partition function for models of Laughlin states of atomic\ngases by combining high temperature series expansions with exact\ndiagonalization. Using the ansatz we find that entropies required to observe\nLaughlin correlations with bosonic gases are within reach of current cooling\ncapabilities.\n", "  Research on generative models is a central project in the emerging field of\nnetwork science, and it studies how statistical patterns found in real networks\ncould be generated by formal rules. Output from these generative models is then\nthe basis for designing and evaluating computational methods on networks, and\nfor verification and simulation studies. During the last two decades, a variety\nof models has been proposed with an ultimate goal of achieving comprehensive\nrealism for the generated networks. In this study, we (a) introduce a new\ngenerator, termed ReCoN; (b) explore how ReCoN and some existing models can be\nfitted to an original network to produce a structurally similar replica, (c)\nuse ReCoN to produce networks much larger than the original exemplar, and\nfinally (d) discuss open problems and promising research directions. In a\ncomparative experimental study, we find that ReCoN is often superior to many\nother state-of-the-art network generation methods. We argue that ReCoN is a\nscalable and effective tool for modeling a given network while preserving\nimportant properties at both micro- and macroscopic scales, and for scaling the\nexemplar data by orders of magnitude in size.\n", "  Grad's moment models for Boltzmann equation were recently regularized to\nglobally hyperbolic systems, and thus the regularized models attain local\nwell-posedness for Cauchy data. The hyperbolic regularization is only related\nto the convection term in Boltzmann equation. We in this paper studied the\nregularized models with the presentation of collision terms. It is proved that\nthe regularized models are linear stability at the local equilibrium and\nsatisfy Yong's first stability condition with commonly used approximate\ncollision terms, and particularly with Boltzmann's binary collision model.\n", "  We study the dynamic coarsening of wrinkles in an elastic sheet that is\ncompressed while lying on a thin layer of viscous liquid. When the ends of the\nsheet are instantaneously brought together by a small distance, viscous\nresistance initially prevents the sheet from adopting a globally buckled shape.\nInstead, the sheet accommodates the compression by wrinkling. Previous scaling\narguments suggested that a balance between the sheet's bending stiffness and\nviscous effects lead to a wrinkle wavelength $\\lambda$ that increases with time\n$t$ according to $\\lambda\\propto t^{1/6}$. We show that taking proper account\nof the compression constraint leads to a logarithmic correction of this result,\n$\\lambda\\propto (t/\\log t)^{1/6}$. This correction is significant over\nexperimentally observable time spans, and leads us to reassess previously\npublished experimental data.\n", "  We consider the problem of correct measurement of a quantum entanglement in\nthe two-body electron-electron scattering. An expression is derived for a spin\ncorrelation tensor of a pure two-electron state. A geometrical measure of a\nquantum entanglement as the distance between two forms of this tensor in\nentangled and separable cases is presented. We prove that this measure\nsatisfies properties of a valid entanglement measure: nonnegativity,\ndiscriminance, normalization, non-growth under local operations and classical\ncommunication. This measure is calculated for a problem of electron-electron\nscattering. We prove that it does not depend on the azimuthal rotation angle of\nthe second electron spin relative to the first electron spin before scattering.\nFinally, we specify how to find a spin correlation tensor and the related\nmeasure of a quantum entanglement in an experiment with electron-electron\nscattering.\n", "  In this work we present an ab-initio study of electronic properties of 1\ndimensional (1D) core-shell nanostructures made of MS2 (MoS2, WS2) or BN\narmchair nanotube encapsulated carbon nanotubes (CNT). With local density\napproximation (LDA) in density functional theory (DFT) we calculate the\nbandstructure, carrier effective masses, various fundamental electrostatic\nfeatures and optical absorption in such core-shell tubes. The carrier transport\nin these structures are important for nanoelectronics applications and are\nstudied with the Greens function formalism. Simulations show a moderate\nindirect band gap in the core-shell CNT@MS2 tubes while the CNT@BN shows\nmetallic nature. The varying chirality of CNT strongly affects the carrier\neffective masses of the CNT@MS2 structure. Electron density is found to be much\nmore localized near the atom cores and stronger in magnitude for the CNT@BN\nwhile the W atoms show a more prominent electron-gas presence around them than\nMo atoms as found in the electron localization functions. In the CNT@MS2\nsystems the electrostatic difference potential indicates a drive to transfer\ncharge from the metal to the S atoms in the shell. In terms of optical\nabsorption a strong and sharper peak is observed around 6 eV for the CNT@BN\ncompared to a more broad absorption spectra of the CNT@MS2. Metallic\ntransmission spectra is seen for CNT@BN while CNT@MS2 shows non-metallic\ntransport but with a larger number of transmission states near fermi level. The\nelectronic and optical properties and its possible tuning in the core-shell\nstructures can be useful in various applications such as shielded\ninterconnects, logic switches and optoelectronics.\n", "  We consider the problem of Gaussian mixture clustering in the\nhigh-dimensional limit where the data consists of $m$ points in $n$ dimensions,\n$n,m \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\alpha = m/n$ stays finite. Using exact but\nnon-rigorous methods from statistical physics, we determine the critical value\nof $\\alpha$ and the distance between the clusters at which it becomes\ninformation-theoretically possible to reconstruct the membership into clusters\nbetter than chance. We also determine the accuracy achievable by the\nBayes-optimal estimation algorithm. In particular, we find that when the number\nof clusters is sufficiently large, $r > 4 + 2 \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, there is a gap\nbetween the threshold for information-theoretically optimal performance and the\nthreshold at which known algorithms succeed.\n", "  Coulomb matrix elements are needed in all studies in solid-state theory that\nare based on Hubbard-type multi-orbital models. Due to symmetries, the matrix\nelements are not independent. We determine a set of independent Coulomb\nparameters for a $d$-shell and a $f$-shell and all point groups with up to $16$\nelements ($O_h$, $O$, $T_d$, $T_h$, $D_{6h}$, and $D_{4h}$). Furthermore, we\nexpress all other matrix elements as a function of the independent Coulomb\nparameters. Apart from the solution of the general point-group problem we\ninvestigate in detail the spherical approximation and first-order corrections\nto the spherical approximation.\n", "  To put new constraints on the r-mode instability window, we analyse the\nformation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) within the recycling scenario, making\nuse of three sets of observations: (a) X-ray observations of neutron stars\n(NSs) in low-mass X-ray binaries; (b) timing of millisecond pulsars; and (c)\nX-ray and UV observations of MSPs. As shown in previous works, r-mode\ndissipation by shear viscosity is not sufficient to explain observational set\n(a), and enhanced r-mode dissipation at the red-shifted internal temperatures\n$T^\\infty\\sim 10^8$ K is required to stabilize the observed NSs. Here, we argue\nthat models with enhanced bulk viscosity can hardly lead to a self-consistent\nexplanation of observational set (a) due to strong neutrino emission, which is\ntypical for these models (unrealistically powerful energy source is required to\nkeep NSs at the observed temperatures). We also demonstrate that the\nobservational set (b), combined with the theory of internal heating and NS\ncooling, provides evidence of enhanced r-mode dissipation at low temperatures,\n$T^\\infty\\sim 2\\times 10^7$ K. Observational set (c) allows us to set an upper\nlimit on the internal temperatures of MSPs, $T^\\infty<2\\times 10^7$ K (assuming\na canonical NS with the accreted crust). Recycling scenario can produce MSPs at\nthese temperatures only if r-mode instability is suppressed in the whole MSP\nspin frequency range ($\\nu\\lesssim 750$ Hz) at temperatures $2\\times\n10^7\\lesssim T^\\infty\\lesssim 3 \\times 10^7$ K, providing thus a new constraint\non the r-mode instability window. These observational constraints are analysed\nin more details in application to the resonance uplift scenario of Gusakov et\nal. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 112 (2014), 151101].\n", "  The properties of large underdensities in the distribution of galaxies in the\nUniverse, known as cosmic voids, are potentially sensitive probes of\nfundamental physics. We use data from the MultiDark suite of N-body simulations\nand multiple halo occupation distribution mocks to study the relationship\nbetween galaxy voids, identified using a watershed void-finding algorithm, and\nthe gravitational potential $\\Phi$. We find that the majority of galaxy voids\ncorrespond to local density minima in larger-scale overdensities, and thus lie\nin potential wells. However, a subset of voids can be identified that closely\ntrace maxima of the gravitational potential and thus stationary points of the\nvelocity field. We identify a new void observable, $\\lambda_v$, which depends\non a combination of the void size and the average galaxy density contrast\nwithin the void, and show that it provides a good proxy indicator of the\npotential at the void location. A simple linear scaling of $\\Phi$ as a function\nof $\\lambda_v$ is found to hold, independent of the redshift and properties of\nthe galaxies used as tracers of voids. We provide an accurate fitting formula\nto describe the spherically averaged potential profile $\\Phi(r)$ about void\ncentre locations. We discuss the importance of these results for the\nunderstanding of the evolution history of voids, and for their use in precision\nmeasurements of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, gravitational lensing and\npeculiar velocity distortions in redshift space.\n", "  Density functional theory has been an essential analysis tool for both\ntheoretical and experimental chemists since accurate hybrid functionals were\ndeveloped. Here we propose a local hybrid method derived from the optimized\neffective potential (OEP) method and compare its distinct features with\nconventional nonlocal ones from the Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange operator. Both\nare formally exact for ground states and thus show similar accuracy for\natomization energies and reaction barrier heights. For excited states, the\nlocal version yields virtual orbitals with N-electron character, while those of\nthe nonlocal version have mixed characters between N- and (N+1)-electron\norbitals. As a result, the orbital energy gaps from the former well approximate\nexcitation energies with a small mean absolute error (MAE = 0.40 eV) for the\nCaricato benchmark set. The correction from time-dependent density functional\ntheory with a simple local density approximation kernel further improves its\naccuracy by incorporating multi-configurational effects, resulting in the total\nMAE of 0.27 eV that outperforms conventional functionals except for MN15.\n", "  Heterotic supergravity with (1+3)--dimensional domain wall configurations and\n(warped) internal, six dimensional, almost-K\\\"ahler manifolds $\\ ^6\\mathbf{X}$\nare studied. Considering ten dimensional spacetimes with nonholonomic\ndistributions and conventional double fibrations, 2+2+...=2+2+3+3, and\nassociated $SU(3)$ structures on internal space, we generalize for real,\ninternal, almost symplectic gravitational structures the constructions with\ngravitational and gauge instantons of tanh-kink type. They include the first\n$\\alpha ^{\\prime}$ corrections to the heterotic supergravity action,\nparameterized in a form to imply nonholonomic deformations of the Yang-Mills\nsector and corresponding Bianchi identities. We show how it is possible to\nconstruct a variety of solutions depending on the type of nonholonomic\ndistributions and deformations of 'prime' instanton configurations\ncharacterized by two real supercharges. This corresponds to $\\mathcal{N}=1/2$\nsupersymmetric, nonholonomic manifolds from the four dimensional point of view.\nOur method provides a unified description of embedding nonholonomically\ndeformed tanh-kink-type instantons into half-BPS solutions of heterotic\nsupergravity. This allows us to elaborate new geometric methods of constructing\nexact solutions of motion equations, with first order $\\alpha ^{\\prime}$\ncorrections to the heterotic supergravity. Such a formalism is applied for\ngeneral and/or warped almost-K\\\"ahler configurations, which allows us to\ngenerate nontrivial (1+3)-d domain walls and black hole deformations determined\nby quasiperiodic internal space structures. This formalism is utilized in our\nassociated publication [EPJC 77 (2017) 17, arXiv: 1608.01980] in order to\nconstruct and study generic off-diagonal nonholonomic deformations of the Kerr\nmetric, encoding contributions from heterotic supergravity.\n", "  The PICASSO dark matter search experiment operated an array of 32 superheated\ndroplet detectors containing 3.0 kg of C$_{4}$F$_{10}$ and collected an\nexposure of 231.4 kgd at SNOLAB between March 2012 and January 2014. We report\non the final results of this experiment which includes for the first time the\ncomplete data set and improved analysis techniques including \\mbox{acoustic}\nlocalization to allow fiducialization and removal of higher activity regions\nwithin the detectors. No signal consistent with dark matter was observed. We\nset limits for spin-dependent interactions on protons of\n$\\sigma_p^{SD}$~=~1.32~$\\times$~10$^{-2}$~pb (90\\%~C.L.) at a WIMP mass of 20\nGeV/c$^{2}$. In the spin-independent sector we exclude cross sections larger\nthan $\\sigma_p^{SI}$~=~4.86~$\\times$~10$^{-5 }$~pb~(90\\% C.L.) in the region\naround 7 GeV/c$^{2}$. The pioneering efforts of the PICASSO experiment have\npaved the way forward for a next generation detector incorporating much of this\ntechnology and experience into larger mass bubble chambers.\n", "  Voltages above a hundred kilo-volt will be required to generate the drift\nfield of future very large liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers. The most\ndelicate component is the feedthrough whose role is to safely deliver the very\nhigh voltage to the cathode through the thick insulating walls of the cryostat\nwithout compromising the purity of the argon inside. This requires a\nfeedthrough that is typically meters long and carefully designed to be vacuum\ntight and have small heat input. Furthermore, all materials should be carefully\nchosen to allow operation in cryogenic conditions. In addition, electric fields\nin liquid argon should be kept below a threshold to reduce risks of discharges.\nThe combination of all above requirements represents significant challenges\nfrom the design and manufacturing perspective. In this paper, we report on the\nsuccessful operation of a feedthrough satisfying all the above requirements.\nThe details of the feedthrough design and its manufacturing steps are provided.\nVery high voltages up to unprecedented voltages of -300 kV could be applied\nduring long periods repeatedly. A source of instability was observed, which was\nspecific to the setup configuration which was used for the test and not due to\nthe feedthrough itself.\n", "  We consider the pion-photon transition form factor at low to intermediate\nspacelike momenta within the theoretical framework of light-cone sum rules. We\nderive predictions which take into account all currently known contributions\nstemming from QCD perturbation theory up to the next-to-next-to-leading order\n(NNLO) and by including all twist terms up to order six. In order to enable a\nmore detailed comparison with forthcoming high-precision data, we also estimate\nthe main systematic theoretical uncertainties, stemming from various sources,\nand discuss their influence on the calculations --- in particular the dominant\none related to the still uncalculated part of the NNLO contribution. The\nanalysis addresses, in broad terms, also the role of the twist-two pion\ndistribution amplitude derived with different approaches.\n", "  Voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) in magnetic heterostructures is\na key technology for achieving energy-efficiency electronic devices with\nultralow power consumption. Here, we report the first demonstration of the VCMA\neffect in novel epitaxial Ru/Co2FeAl(CFA)/MgO heterostructures with interfacial\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Perpendicularly magnetized tunnel\njunctions with the structure of Ru/CFA/MgO were fabricated and exhibited an\neffective voltage control on switching fields for the CFA free layer. A large\nVCMA coefficient of 108 (139) fJ/Vm for the CFA film was achieved at room\ntemperature (4 K). The interfacial stability in the heterostructure was\nconfirmed by repeating measurements. Temperature dependences of both the\ninterfacial PMA and the VCMA effect were also investigated. It is found that\nthe temperature dependences follow power laws of the saturation magnetization\nwith an exponent of ~2. The significant VCMA effect observed in this work\nindicates that the Ru/CFA/MgO heterostructure could be one of the promising\ncandidates for spintronic devices with voltage control.\n", "  We show that dephasing of individual atoms destroys the superradiance\ntransition of the Dicke model, but that adding individual decay toward the spin\ndown state can restore this transition. To demonstrate this, we present a\nmethod to give an exact solution for the $N$ atom problem with individual\ndephasing which scales polynomially with $N$. By comparing finite size scaling\nof our exact solution to a cumulant expansion, we confirm the destruction and\nrestoration of the superradiance transition holds in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  We consider the solid-liquid-solid (SLS) process of in-plane silicon nanowire\ngrowth from a point of view of spontaneous motion of indium (In) droplets on\nhydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) coated substrates, and intermixing with\nthe a-Si:H layer and precipitating crystalline silicon (c-Si) nanowires (NWs).\nDetailed SEM studies of the nanowires system (drop diameter, trench width, and\na-Si:H thickness) and their interdependence unveils a reactive-wetting\nbehaviour of In droplets on a-Si:H, which is in perfect agreement with the\nin-situ TEM observation. We propose that this reactive wetting process\ntransforms a-Si:H to c-Si, so that establishes a substrate energy gradient\nbetween the In contacts with a-Si:H at its advancing edge and with the\nsubstrate at its receding edge. This energy gradient activates the spontaneous\nmovement of the drop which thereby maintains its contact with a-Si:H and allows\na continuous nanowire growth. We suggest that the anisotropic wetting profile\nof In droplets results in the random growth of nanowires, which cannot be\navoided on flat substrate. Thus, we study the mechanism and stability of\nstep-guided growth approach, aiming at high yield self-organisation of in-plane\nsilicon nanowires.\n", "  We address the production of indium nanoparticles (In NPs) from In thin films\nthermally evaporated on both c-Si substrates and sputtered indium tin oxide\n(ITO) as well as from sputtered ITO thin films, exposed to a hydrogen (H2)\nplasma. On the one hand, we show that evaporated In thin films grow in\nVolmer-Weber (VW) mode; H2 plasma reduces their surface oxide and substrate\nannealing reshapes them from flat islands into spheres, without any remarkable\nsurface migration or coalescence. On the other hand, we studied the In NPs\nformation on the ITO thin films and on In/ITO bilayer structures, by varying\nthe H2 plasma exposure time and the substrate temperature. This led us to\npostulate that the main role of H2 plasma is to release In atoms from ITO\nsurface. At low substrate temperature (100{\\deg}C), In NPs grow on ITO surface\nvia a solid phase VW mode, similar to evaporated In thin films, while at\n300{\\deg}C, small In droplets preferentially nucleate along the ITO grain\nboundaries where ITO reduction rate and atomic diffusion coefficient are higher\ncompared with the ITO grain surface. As the droplets grow larger and connect\nwith each other, larger ones (1-2 um microns) are suddenly formed based on a\nliquid phase growth-connection-coalescence process. This phenomenon is even\nstronger in the case of In/ITO bilayer where the large In drops resulting from\nthe evaporated In connect with the smaller NPs resulting from ITO reduction and\nrapidly merge into very large NPs (15 um)\n", "  Superfluid $^3$He is a spin-triplet ($S=1$), p-wave ($L=1$) BCS condensate of\nCooper pairs with total angular momentum $J=0$ in the ground state. In addition\nto the breaking of $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, separate spin or orbital rotation\nsymmetry is broken to the maximal sub-group, $SO(3)_S\\times SO(3)_L\\rightarrow\nSO(3)_J$. The Fermions acquire mass, $m_F\\equiv\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the\nBCS gap. There are also 18 Bosonic excitations - 4 Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes\nand 14 massive amplitude Higgs (AH) modes. The Bosonic modes are labelled by\nthe total angular momentum, $J\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$, and parity under particle-hole\nsymmetry, $C=\\pm 1$. For each pair of angular momentum quantum numbers,\n$J,J_z$, there are two Bosonic partners with $C=\\pm 1$. Based this spectrum\nNambu proposed a sum rule connecting the Fermion and Boson masses for BCS type\ntheories, which for $^3$He-B is $M_{J^+}^2 + M_{J^-}^2 = 4m_F^2$ for each\nfamily of Bosonic modes labelled by $J$, where $M_{J^C}$ is the mass of the\nBosonic mode with quantum numbers $(J,C)$. Nambu's sum rule (NSR) has recently\nbeen discussed in the context of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models for physics beyond\nthe standard model to speculate on possible partners to the recently discovered\nHiggs Boson at higher energies. Here we point out that Nambu's Fermion-Boson\nmass relations are not exact. Corrections to the Bosonic masses from (i)\nleading order strong-coupling corrections to BCS theory, and (ii) polarization\nof the parent Fermionic vacuum lead to violations of the sum-rule. Results for\nthese mass corrections are given in both the $T\\rightarrow 0$ and $T\\rightarrow\nT_c$ limits. We also discuss experimental results, and theoretical analysis,\nfor the masses of the $J^{C}=2^{\\pm}$ Higgs modes and the magnitude of the\nviolation of the NSR.\n", "  We demonstrate that the investigations of the forward-backward correlations\nbetween intensive observables enable to obtain more clear signal about the\ninitial stage of hadronic interaction, e.g. about the process of string fusion,\ncompared to usual forward-backward multiplicity correlations. As an example,\nthe correlation between mean-event transverse momenta of charged particles in\nseparated rapidity intervals is considered. We performed calculations in the\nframework of dipole-based Monte Carlo string fusion model. We obtained the\ndependence of the correlation strength on the collision centrality for\ndifferent initial energies and colliding systems. It is shown that the\ndependence reveals the decline of the correlation coefficient for most central\nPb-Pb collisions at LHC energy. We compare the results both with the ones\nobtained in alternative models and with the ones obtained by us using various\nMC generators.\n", "  We study the action of the full bosonic string for the domain being\ntwo-dimensional Minkowski space and the target a Riemannian manifold. Its\ncritical points couple the wave map equation to a scalar and a two-form\npotential. Besides investigating their basic features we establish existence\nresults for the latter.\n", "  We present a quantum Hall effect of magnons in two-dimensional clean\ninsulating magnets at finite temperature. Through the Aharonov-Casher effect, a\nmagnon moving in an electric field acquires a geometric phase and forms Landau\nlevels in an electric field gradient of sawtooth form. At low temperatures, the\nlowest energy band being almost flat carries a Chern number associated with a\nBerry curvature. Appropriately defining the thermal conductance for bosons, we\nfind that the magnon Hall conductances get quantized and show a universal\nthermomagnetic behavior, i.e., are independent of materials, and obey a\nWiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport. We consider magnons with quadratic\nand linear (Dirac-like) dispersions. Finally, we show that our predictions are\nwithin experimental reach for ferromagnets and skyrmion lattices with current\ndevice and measurement techniques.\n", "  It has been proved that the distribution of the point where the Smart Kinetic\nWalk (SKW) exits a domain converges in distribution to harmonic measure on the\nhexagonal lattice. For other lattices, it is believed that this result still\nholds, and there is good numerical evidence to support this conjecture. Here we\nexamine the effect of the symmetry and asymmetry of the transition probability\non each step of the SKW on the square lattice and test if the exit distribution\nconverges in distribution to harmonic measure as well. From our simulations,\nthe limiting exit distribution of the SKW with a non-uniform but symmetric\ntransition probability as the lattice spacing goes to zero is the harmonic\nmeasure. This result does not hold for asymmetric transition probability. We\nare also interested in the difference between the SKW with symmetric transition\nprobability exit distribution and harmonic measure. Our simulations provide\nstrong support for a explicit conjecture about this first order difference. The\nexplicit formula for the conjecture will be given below.\n", "  Centrality, as a geometrical property of the collision, is crucial for the\nphysical interpretation of nucleus-nucleus and proton-nucleus experimental\ndata. However, it cannot be directly accessed in event-by-event data analysis.\nCommon methods for centrality estimation in A-A and p-A collisions usually rely\non a single detector (either on the signal in zero-degree calorimeters or on\nthe multiplicity in some semi-central rapidity range). In the present work, we\nmade an attempt to develop an approach for centrality determination that is\nbased on machine-learning techniques and utilizes information from several\ndetector subsystems simultaneously. Different event classifiers are suggested\nand evaluated for their selectivity power in terms of the number of\nnucleons-participants and the impact parameter of the collision. Finer\ncentrality resolution may allow to reduce impact from so-called volume\nfluctuations on physical observables being studied in heavy-ion experiments\nlike ALICE at the LHC and fixed target experiment NA61/SHINE on SPS.\n", "  The ability of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to gelate under specific\nsynthetic conditions opens up new opportunities in the preparation and shaping\nof hierarchically porous MOF monoliths, which could be directly implemented for\ncatalytic and adsorptive applications. In this work, we present the first\nexamples of xero- or aerogel monoliths consisting solely of nanoparticles of\nseveral prototypical Zr4+-based MOFs: UiO-66-X (X = H, NH2, NO2, (OH)2),\nUiO-67, MOF-801, MOF-808 and NU-1000. High reactant and water concentrations\nduring synthesis were observed to induce the formation of gels, which were\nconverted to monolithic materials by drying in air or supercritical CO2.\nElectron microscopy, combined with N2 physisorption experiments, was used to\nshow that an irregular nanoparticle packing leads to pure MOF monoliths with\nhierarchical pore systems, featuring both intraparticle micropores and\ninterparticle mesopores. Finally, UiO-66 gels were shaped into monolithic\nspheres of 600 micrometer diameter using an oil-drop method, creating promising\ncandidates for packed-bed catalytic or adsorptive applications, where\nhierarchical pore systems can greatly mitigate mass transfer limitations.\n", "  We analytically obtain a new charged Lifshtitz solution by adding a\nnon-relativistic Maxwell field in Horava-Lifshitz gravity. The black hole\nexhibits an anisotropic scaling between space and time (Lifshitz scaling) in\nthe UV limit, while in the IR limit, the Lorentz invariance is recovered. We\nintroduce the probed Lorentz-violation fermions into the background and\nholographically investigate the spectral properties of the dual fermionic\noperator. The Lorentz-violation of fermions will enhance the peak and\ncorresponds larger fermi momentum, which compensates the non-relativistic bulk\neffect of the dynamical exponent. For a fixed $z$, when the Lorentz-violation\nof fermions increases to a critical value, the behavior of the low energy\nexcitation goes from a non-Fermi liquid type to a fermi liquid type, which\nimplies a kind of phase transition.\n", "  We develop the formalism of holographic renormalization to compute two-point\nfunctions in a holographic Kondo model. The model describes a\n$(0+1)$-dimensional impurity spin of a gauged $SU(N)$ interacting with a\n$(1+1)$-dimensional, large-$N$, strongly-coupled Conformal Field Theory (CFT).\nWe describe the impurity using Abrikosov pseudo-fermions, and define an\n$SU(N)$-invariant scalar operator $\\mathcal{O}$ built from a pseudo-fermion and\na CFT fermion. At large $N$ the Kondo interaction is of the form\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\dagger} \\mathcal{O}$, which is marginally relevant, and\ngenerates a Renormalization Group (RG) flow at the impurity. A second-order\nmean-field phase transition occurs in which $\\mathcal{O}$ condenses below a\ncritical temperature, leading to the Kondo effect, including screening of the\nimpurity. Via holography, the phase transition is dual to holographic\nsuperconductivity in $(1+1)$-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space. At all\ntemperatures, spectral functions of $\\mathcal{O}$ exhibit a Fano resonance,\ncharacteristic of a continuum of states interacting with an isolated resonance.\nIn contrast to Fano resonances observed for example in quantum dots, our\ncontinuum and resonance arise from a $(0+1)$-dimensional UV fixed point and RG\nflow, respectively. In the low-temperature phase, the resonance comes from a\npole in the Green's function of the form $-i \\langle {\\cal O} \\rangle^2$, which\nis characteristic of a Kondo resonance.\n", "  Results are given for the ground state energy and excitation spectrum of a\nsimple $N$-state $Z_N$ spin chain described by free parafermions. The model is\nnon-Hermitian for $N \\ge 3$ with a real ground state energy and a complex\nexcitation spectrum. Although having a simpler Hamiltonian than the\nsuperintegrable chiral Potts model, the model is seen to share some properties\nwith it, e.g., the specific heat exponent $\\alpha=1-2/N$ and the anisotropic\ncorrelation length exponents $\\nu_\\parallel =1$ and $\\nu_\\perp=2/N$.\n", "  A survey is presented on the current status of 3D nucleon tomography. Several\nresearch frontiers are addressed that dominate modern physics from theory to\ncurrent and future experiments. We have now a much more detailed spatial image\nof the nucleon thanks to various theoretical concepts and methods to describe\nits charge distribution and spin decomposition which are highlighted here. The\nprogress of lattice computations of these quantities is reported and the\nprospects of what we can come to expect in the near future are discussed.\nMulti-dimensional maps of the nucleon's partonic structure appear now within\nreach of forthcoming experiments.\n", "  By employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy combined with\nfirst-principles calculations, we performed a systematic investigation on the\nelectronic structure of LaBi, which exhibits extremely large magnetoresistance\n(XMR), and is theoretically predicted to possess band anticrossing with\nnontrivial topological properties. Here, the observations of the Fermi-surface\ntopology and band dispersions are similar to previous studies on LaSb [Phys.\nRev. Lett. 117, 127204 (2016)], a topologically trivial XMR semimetal, except\nthe existence of a band inversion along the $\\Gamma$-$X$ direction, with one\nmassless and one gapped Dirac-like surface state at the $X$ and $\\Gamma$\npoints, respectively. The odd number of massless Dirac cones suggests that LaBi\nis analogous to the time-reversal $Z_2$ nontrivial topological insulator. These\nfindings open up a new series for exploring novel topological states and\ninvestigating their evolution from the perspective of topological phase\ntransition within the family of rare-earth monopnictides.\n", "  It is a conventional wisdom that symmetry breakdown at grain boundaries in\ncrystals introduces volume expansion and there has been no confirmed evidence\nof volume contraction at a grain boundary in any kind of crystals. We report\nsurprising volume contraction at the Sigma3(111) grain boundary in vanadium.\nThe lattice distortion near this grain boundary is found to drive the local\nstructure toward a hypothetical {\\omega} phase, which is only slightly less\nstable than the bcc phase. Compressing lattice constant a of the {\\omega}-phase\ndown to the value of bcc, as is the case at the Sigma3(111) grain boundary,\nresults in smaller c than in bcc structure, and hence the volume contraction.\nWe also find such a volume contraction impedes the segregation of Ti and H,\nwhile enhances that of Cr, and hence a significant influence on material\nproperties. The discovery adds fundamental new knowledge of condensed matter,\nand may also point to new techniques in grain boundary engineering of novel\nmaterials through volume control.\n", "  The NA48/2 experiment at CERN collected a large sample of charged kaon decays\nto final states with multiple charged particles in 2003--2004. A new upper\nlimit on the rate of the lepton number violating decay\n$K^{\\pm}\\to\\pi^{\\mp}\\mu^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\pm}$ is reported:\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm}\\to\\pi^{\\mp}\\mu^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\pm})<8.6 \\times 10^{-11}$ at 90%\nCL. Searches for two-body resonances $X$ in $K^{\\pm}\\to\\pi\\mu\\mu$ decays (such\nas heavy neutral leptons $N_4$ and inflatons $\\chi$) are also presented. In the\nabsence of signals, upper limits are set on the products of branching fractions\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm}\\to\\mu^{\\pm}N_4)\\mathcal{B}(N_4\\to\\pi\\mu)$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(K^{\\pm}\\to\\pi^{\\pm}X)\\mathcal{B}(X\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-)$ for ranges of\nassumed resonance masses and lifetimes. The limits are in the\n$(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ range for resonance lifetimes below 100 ps.\n", "  Al4SiC4 is a wide band gap semiconductor with numerous potential\ntechnological applications. We report here the first thorough experimental\nRaman and Infrared (IR) investigation of vibrational properties of Al4SiC4\nsingle crystals grown by high temperature solution growth method. The\nexperimental results are compared with the full theoretical analysis of\nvibrational properties based on Density Functional Theory calculations that are\nrevisited here. We have obtained a good agreement between the experimental and\ncalculated Raman phonon modes and this allowed the symmetry assignment of all\nthe measured Raman modes. We have revisited the DFT calculation of the IR\nactive phonon modes and our results for LO-TO splitting indicate a substantial\ndecrease of the variation of omega(LO-TO) compared with the previous reported\ncalculation. Moreover, most of the IR modes have been symmetry assigned from\nthe comparison of the experimental IR spectra with the corresponding Raman\nspectra and the Al4SiC4 calculated phonon modes.\n", "  Using the classical top-hat profile, we study the non-linear growth of\nspherically symmetric density perturbation and structure formation in $f(T)$\ngravities. In particular, three concrete models, which have been tested against\nthe observation of large-scale evolution and linear perturbation of the\nuniverse in the cosmological scenario, are investigated in this framework,\ncovering both minimal and nonminimal coupling cases of $f(T)$ gravities.\nMoreover, we consider the virialization of the overdense region in the models\nafter they detach from the background expanding universe and turn around to\ncollapse. We find that there are constraints in the magnitude and occurring\nepoch of the initial perturbation. The existence of these constraints indicates\nthat a perturbation that is too weak or occurs too late will not be able to\nstop the expanding of the overdense region. The illustration of the evolution\nof the perturbation shows that in $f(T)$ gravities, the initial perturbation\nwithin the constraints can eventually lead to clustering and form structure.\nThe evolution also shows that nonminimal coupling models collapse slower than\nthe minimal coupling one.\n", "  The Argon Dark Matter (ArDM) experiment consists of a liquid argon (LAr) time\nprojection chamber (TPC) sensitive to nuclear recoils resulting from scattering\nof hypothetical Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) on argon targets.\nWith an active target of 850 kg, ArDM represents an important milestone in the\nquest for Dark Matter with LAr. We present the experimental apparatus currently\ninstalled underground at the Laboratorio Subterraneo de Canfranc (LSC), Spain.\nWe show first data recorded during a single-phase commissioning run in 2015\n(ArDM Run I), which overall confirm the good and stable performance of the\nton-scale LAr detector.\n", "  Compact objects with a light sphere such as black holes and wormholes can\nreflect light rays like a mirror. This gravitational lensing phenomenon is\ncalled retrolensing and it is an interesting tool to survey dark and compact\nobjects with a light sphere near the solar system. In this paper, we calculate\nthe deflection angle analytically in the strong deflection limit in the\nReissner-Nordstrom spacetime without Taylor expanding it in the power of the\nelectric charge. Using the obtained deflection angle in the strong deflection\nlimit, we investigate the retrolensing light curves and the separation of\ndouble images by the light sphere of Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.\n", "  Gravitational lensing by the light sphere of compact objects like black holes\nand wormholes will give us information on the compact objects. In this paper,\nwe provide an improved strong deflection limit analysis in a general\nasymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. The strong\ndeflection limit analysis also works in ultrastatic spacetimes. As an example\nof an ultrastatic spacetime, we reexamine the deflection angle in the strong\ndeflection limit in an Ellis wormhole spacetime. Using the strong deflection\nlimit, we obtain the deflection angle analytically for the Reissner-Nordstrom\nspacetime. The point of the improvement is the definition of a standard\nvariable in the strong deflection limit analysis. We show that the choice of\nthe variable is as important as the choice of the coordinates and we conclude\nthat one should choose a proper variable for a given spacetime.\n", "  We report CMOS-compatible quantized current sources (electron pumps)\nfabricated with nanowires (NWs) on 300 mm SOI wafers. Unlike other Al, GaAs or\nSi based metallic or semiconductor pumps, the fabrication does not rely on\nelectron-beam lithography. The structure consists of two gates in series on the\nnanowire and the only difference with the SOI nanowire process lies in long (40\nnm) nitride spacers. As a result a single, silicided island gets isolated\nbetween the gates and transport is dominated by Coulomb blockade at cryogenic\ntemperatures thanks to the small size and therefore capacitance of this island.\nOperation and performances comparable to devices featuring e-beam lithography\nis demonstrated in the non-adiabatic pumping regime, with a pumping frequency\nup to 300 MHz. We also identify and model signatures of charge traps affecting\ncharge pumping in the adiabatic regime. The availability of quantized current\nreferences in a process close to the 28FDSOI technology could trigger new\napplications for these pumps and allow to cointegrate them with cryogenic CMOS\ncircuits, for instance in the emerging field of interfaces with quantum bits.\n", "  Ferromagnetic films of L10-ordered MnGa and MnAl that exhibit giant\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy and great controllability in the magnetism\nand structural disorders show promise not only in the applications in magnetic\nrecording, permanent magnets and spintronics, but also in controllable studies\nof disorder-relevant electrical transport phenomena. In this article, we review\nthe intriguing experimental observations of the orbital two-channel Kondo\neffect and anomalous Hall effect in L10-ordered MnGa and MnAl thin films with\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We also give a perspective with regards to\nthe future technological and fundamental applications of these perpendicularly\nmagnetized Mn-based binary alloy films.\n", "  Four-wave mixing in the form of Bragg scattering (BS) has been predicted to\nenable quantum noise less frequency conversion by analytic quantum approaches.\nUsing a semi-classical description of quantum noise that accounts for loss and\nstimulated and spontaneous Raman scattering, which are not currently described\nin existing quantum approaches, we quantify the impacts of these effects on the\nconversion efficiency and on the quantum noise properties of BS in terms of an\ninduced noise figure (NF). We give an approximate closed-form expression for\nthe BS conversion efficiency that includes loss and stimulated Raman\nscattering, and we derive explicit expressions for the Raman-induced NF from\nthe semi-classical approach used here.\n", "  Despite the ubiquity of fluid flows interacting with porous and elastic\nmaterials, we lack a validated non-empirical macroscale method for\ncharacterizing the flow over and through a poroelastic medium. We propose a\ncomputational tool to describe such configurations by deriving and validating a\ncontinuum model for the poroelastic bed and its interface with the above free\nfluid. We show that, using stress continuity condition and slip velocity\ncondition at the interface, the effective model captures the effects of small\nchanges in the microstructure anisotropy correctly and predicts the overall\nbehaviour in a physically consistent and controllable manner. Moreover, we show\nthat the performance of the effective model is accurate by validating with\nfully microscopic resolved simulations. The proposed computational tool can be\nused in investigations in a wide range of fields, including mechanical\nengineering, bio-engineering and geophysics.\n", "  We analyze theoretically spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a\nmultimode nonlinear waveguide as a source of entangled pairs of spatial qubits,\nrealized as superpositions of a photon in two orthogonal transverse modes of\nthe waveguide. It is shown that by exploiting intermodal dispersion,\ndown-conversion into the relevant pairs of spatial modes can be selected by\nspectral filtering, which also provides means to fine-tune the properties of\nthe generated entangled state. We also discuss an inverting interferometer\ndetecting the spatial parity of the input beam as a versatile tool to\ncharacterize properties of the generated state. A single-photon Wigner function\nobtained by a scan of the displaced parity can be used to identify the basis\nmodes of spatial qubit, whereas correlations between displaced parity\nmeasurements on two photons can directly verify quantum entanglement through a\nviolation of Bell's inequalities.\n", "  We present measurements of the pulse length of ultracold electron bunches\ngenerated by near-threshold two-photon photoionization of a laser-cooled gas.\nThe pulse length has been measured using a resonant $3$ GHz deflecting cavity\nin TM$_{110}$ mode. We have measured the pulse length in three ionization\nregimes. The first is direct two-photon photoionization using only a $480$ nm\nfemtosecond laser pulse, which results in short ($\\sim 15$ ps) but hot ($\\sim\n10^{4}$ K) electron bunches. The second regime is just-above-threshold\nfemtosecond photoionization employing the combination of a continuous-wave\n$780$ nm excitation laser and a tunable $480$ nm femtosecond ionization laser\nwhich results in both ultracold ($\\sim 10$ K) and ultrafast ($\\sim 25$ ps)\nelectron bunches. These pulses typically contain $\\sim 10^{3}$ electrons and\nhave an rms normalized transverse beam emittance of $1.5\\pm0.1$ nm$\\cdot$rad.\nThe measured pulse lengths are limited by the energy spread associated with the\nlongitudinal size of the ionization volume, as expected. The third regime is\njust-below-threshold ionization which produces Rydberg states which slowly\nionize on microsecond time scales.\n", "  Stochastic model of the Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet is proposed and solved\nusing generalization of the Fick-Jacobs theory. The theory fully captures\nnonlinear response of the ratchet to the difference of heat bath temperatures.\nThe ratchet performance is discussed using the mean velocity, the average heat\nflow between the two heat reservoirs and the figure of merit, which quantifies\nenergetic cost for attaining a certain mean velocity. Limits of the theory are\ntested comparing its predictions to numerics. We also demonstrate connection\nbetween the ratchet effect emerging in the model and rotations of the\nprobability current and explain direction of the mean velocity using simple\ndiscrete analogue of the model.\n", "  The Fan Region is one of the dominant features in the polarized radio sky,\nlong thought to be a local (distance < 500 pc) synchrotron feature. We present\n1.3-1.8 GHz polarized radio continuum observations of the region from the\nGlobal Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS) and compare them to maps of Halpha\nand polarized radio continuum intensity from 0.408-353 GHz. The high-frequency\n(> 1 GHz) and low-frequency (< 600 MHz) emission have different morphologies,\nsuggesting a different physical origin. Portions of the 1.5 GHz Fan Region\nemission are depolarized by about 30% by ionized gas structures in the Perseus\nArm, indicating that this fraction of the emission originates >2 kpc away. We\nargue for the same conclusion based on the high polarization fraction at 1.5\nGHz (about 40%). The Fan Region is offset with respect to the Galactic plane,\ncovering -5{\\deg} < b < +10{\\deg}; we attribute this offset to the warp in the\nouter Galaxy. We discuss origins of the polarized emission, including the\nspiral Galactic magnetic field. This idea is a plausible contributing factor\nalthough no model to date readily reproduces all of the observations. We\nconclude that models of the Galactic magnetic field should account for the > 1\nGHz emission from the Fan Region as a Galactic-scale, not purely local,\nfeature.\n", "  By proceeding with the idea that the presence of physical (BRST invariant)\nextra factors in the path integral is equivalent to taking into account\nexplicitly the arbitrariness in resolving the quantum master equation, we\nconsider the field-antifield quantization procedure both with the Abelian and\nthe non-Abelian gauge fixing.\n", "  Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulator is a topological phase which exhibits\nchiral edge states in the absence of magnetic field. The celebrated Haldane\nmodel is the first example of QAH effect, but difficult to realize. Here, we\npredict the two-dimensional single-atomic-layer V2O3 with a honeycomb-Kagome\nstructure is a QAH insulator with a large band gap (large than 0.1 eV) and a\nhigh ferromagnetic Curie temperature (about 900 K). Combining the\nfirst-principle calculations with the effective Hamiltonian analysis, we find\nthat the spin-majority dxy and dyz orbitals of V atoms on the honeycomb lattice\nform a massless Dirac cone near the Fermi level which becomes massive when the\non-site spin-orbit coupling is included. Interestingly, we find that the large\nband gap is caused by a cooperative effect of electron correlation and\nspin-orbit coupling. Both first-principle calculations and the effective\nHamiltonian analysis confirm that 2D V2O3 has a non-zero Chern number (i.e.,\none). Our work paves a new direction towards realizing the QAH effect at room\ntemperature.\n", "  An energy extracting black hole magnetosphere can be defined by the location\nof its inner Alfv\\'{e}n surface, which determines the rate of black hole energy\nextraction along a given magnetic field line. We study how the location of the\ninner Alfv\\'{e}n surface can modify the structure of energy extracting black\nhole magnetospheres in the force-free limit. Hundreds of magnetospheres are\nnumerically computed via a general relativistic extension of the Newtonian\nmagnetofrictional method for a full range of black hole spins and flow\nparameters. We find that jet-like structures naturally form very close to the\nhorizon for Alfv\\'{e}n surfaces near the boundary of the ergosphere and that\nenergy is extracted towards the equatorial plane for Alfv\\'{e}n surfaces close\nto the horizon. This suggests that two broad classes of energy extracting black\nhole magnetospheres might exist; those that transmit extracted energy directly\nto distant observers, and those that transmit extracted energy to nearby\naccreting matter. Applied to transient high energy phenomena, we find that they\nmight also differ in timescale by a factor of 20 or more.\n", "  We show how simultaneous, back-action evading tracking of non-commuting\nobservables can be achieved in a widely-used sensing technology, atomic\ninterferometry. Using high-dynamic-range dynamically-decoupled quantum\nnon-demolition (QND) measurements on a precessing atomic spin ensemble, we\ntrack the collective spin angle and amplitude with negligible effects from back\naction, giving steady-state tracking sensitivity 2.9 dB beyond the standard\nquantum limit and 7.0 dB beyond Poisson statistics.\n", "  We analyze the renormalization group equations for the Standard Model at the\none and two loops levels. At one loop level we find an exact constant of\nevolution built from the product of the quark masses and the gauge couplings\n$g_{1}$ and $ g_{3}$ of the $U(1)$ and $SU(3)$ groups. For leptons at one loop\nlevel we find that the ratio of the charged lepton mass and the power of\n$g_{1}$ varies $\\simeq 4\\times 10^{-5}$ in the whole energy range. At the two\nloop level we have found two relations between the quark masses and the gauge\ncouplings that vary $\\simeq 4\\%$ and $\\simeq 1\\%$, respectively. For leptons at\nthe two loop level we have derived a relation between the charged lepton mass\nand the gauge couplings $g_ {1}$ and $g_{2}$ that varies $\\simeq 0.1\\%$. This\nanalysis significantly simplifies the picture of the renormalization group\nevolution of the Standard Model and establishes new important relations between\nits parameters.\n", "  A rarefied gas is considered in a channel consisting of two infinite parallel\nplates between which an evenly spaced array of smaller plates is arranged\nnormal to the channel direction. Each of these smaller plates is assumed to\npossess one ideally specularly reflective and one ideally diffusively\nreflective side. When the temperature of the small plates differs from the\ntemperature of the sidewalls of the channel, these boundary conditions result\nin a temperature profile around the edges of each small plate which breaks the\nreflection symmetry along the channel direction. This in turn results in a\nforce on each plate and a net gas flow along the channel. The situation is\nanalysed numerically using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method and\ncompared with analytical results where available. The influence of the ideally\nspecularly reflective wall is assessed by comparing with simulations using a\nfinite accommodation coefficient at the corresponding wall. The configuration\nbears some similarity with a Crookes radiometer, where a non-symmetric\ntemperature profile at the radiometer vanes is generated by different\ntemperatures on each side of the vane, resulting in a motion of the rotor. The\ndescribed principle may find applications in pumping gas on small scales driven\nby temperature gradients.\n", "  In a realistic scenario, the evolution of the rotational dynamics of a\ncelestial or artificial body is subject to dissipative effects. Time-varying\nnon-conservative forces can be due to, for example, a variation of the moments\nof inertia or to tidal interactions. In this work, we consider a simplified\nmodel describing the rotational dynamics, known as the spin-orbit problem,\nwhere we assume that the orbital motion is provided by a fixed Keplerian\nellipse. We consider different examples in which a non-conservative force acts\non the model and we propose an analytical method, which reduces the system to a\nHamiltonian framework. In particular, we compute a time parametrisation in a\nseries form, which allows us to transform the original system into a\nHamiltonian one. We also provide applications of our method to study the\nrotational motion of a body with time-varying moments of inertia, e.g. an\nartificial satellite with flexible components, as well as subject to a tidal\ntorque depending linearly on the velocity.\n", "  We propose a surface hopping Gaussian beam method to numerically solve a\nclass of high frequency linear transport systems in high spatial dimensions,\nbased on asymptotic analysis. The stochastic surface hopping is combined with\nGaussian beam method to deal with the multiple characteristic directions of the\ntransport system in high dimensions. The Monte Carlo nature of the proposed\nalgorithm makes it easy for parallel implementations. We validate the\nperformance of the algorithms for applications on the quantum-classical\nLiouville equations.\n", "  We performed ab initio computations of the magnetic properties of simple iron\noxide clusters and slabs. We considered an iron oxide cluster functionalized by\na molecule or glued to a gold cluster of the same size. We also considered a\nmagnetite slab coated by cobalt oxide or a mixture of iron oxide and cobalt\noxide. The changes in magnetic behavior were explored using constrained\nmagnetic calculations. A possible value for the surface anisotropy was\nestimated from the fit of a classical Heisenberg model on ab initio results.\nThe value was found to be compatible with estimations obtained by other means,\nor inferred from experimental results. The addition of a ligand, coating, or of\na metallic nanoparticle to the systems degraded the quality of the description\nby the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Proposing a change in the anisotropies allowing\nfor the proportion of each transition atom we could get a much better\ndescription of the magnetism of series of hybrid cobalt and iron oxide systems.\n", "  Within a Monte Carlo technique we examine critical properties of diluted bulk\nmagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As modeled by a strongly diluted ferromagnetic\nHeisenberg spin-$\\frac{5}{2}$ system on a face centered cubic lattice. We\nassumed that 5\\% of Ga atoms is substituted by Mn atoms and the interaction\nbetween them is of the RKKY-type. The considered system is randomly quenched\nand a double average was performed: firstly, over the Boltzmann probability\ndistribution and secondly - over 2048 configurations related to the quenched\ndisorder. We estimated the critical temperature: $T_c=97\\pm6$ K, which is in\nagreement with the experiment. The calculated high value of critical exponent\n$\\nu$ seems to point to a possibility of non-universal critical behavior.\n", "  The cross section of the exclusive $\\eta$ electroproduction reaction $ep\\to\ne^\\prime p^\\prime \\eta$ was measured at Jefferson Lab with a 5.75-GeV electron\nbeam and the CLAS detector. Differential cross sections\n$d^4\\sigma/dtdQ^2dx_Bd\\phi_\\eta$ and structure functions $\\sigma_U =\n\\sigma_T+\\epsilon\\sigma_L, \\sigma_{TT}$ and $\\sigma_{LT}$, as functions of $t$\nwere obtained over a wide range of $Q^2$ and $x_B$. The $\\eta$ structure\nfunctions are compared with those previously measured for $\\pi^0$ at the same\nkinematics. At low $t$, both $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ are described reasonably well\nby generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in which chiral-odd transversity\nGPDs are dominant. The $\\pi^0$ and $\\eta$ data, when taken together, can\nfacilitate the flavor decomposition of the transversity GPDs.\n", "  We prove that the Poisson/Gaudin--Mehta phase transition conjectured to occur\nwhen the bandwidth of an $N \\times N$ symmetric banded matrix grows like $\\sqrt\nN$ is observable as a critical point in the fourth moment of the level density\nfor a wide class of symmetric banded matrices. A second critical point when the\nbandwidth grows like ${2 \\over 5} N$ leads to a new conjectured phase\ntransition in the eigenvalue localization, whose existence we demonstrate in\nnumerical experiments.\n", "  Gravitation and the standard model of particle physics are incorporated\nwithin a single conformal scalar-tensor theory, where the scalar field is\ncomplex. The Higgs field has a dynamical expectation value, as has the Planck\nmass, but the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions are unchanged.\nInitial cosmic singularity and the horizon problem are avoided, and spatial\nflatness is natural. There were no primordial phase transitions; consequently,\nno topological defects were produced. Quantum excitations of the dilaton phase\ninduced a slightly red-tilted spectrum of gaussian and adiabatic scalar\nperturbations, but no analogous primordial gravitational waves were generated.\nSubsequent cosmological epochs through nucleosynthesis are as in standard\ncosmology. A generalized Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, augmented with a\nlinear potential term, describes the exterior of stars and galaxies, such that\nthere is no need for dark matter on galactic scales.\n", "  Janus type Water-Splitting Catalysts have attracted highest attention as a\ntool of choice for solar to fuel conversion. AISI Ni 42 steel was upon harsh\nanodization converted in a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Oxygen evolution\nreaction- (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are highly efficiently\nand steadfast catalyzed at pH 7, 13, 14, 14.6 (OER) respectively at pH 0, 1,\n13, 14, 14.6 (HER). The current density taken from long-term OER measurements\nin pH 7 buffer solution upon the electro activated steel at 491 mV\noverpotential was around 4 times higher (4 mA/cm2) in comparison with recently\ndeveloped OER electrocatalysts. The very strong voltage-current behavior of the\ncatalyst shown in OER polarization experiments at both pH 7 and at pH 13 were\neven superior to those known for IrO2-RuO2. No degradation of the catalyst was\ndetected even when conditions close to standard industrial operations were\napplied to the catalyst. A stable Ni-, Fe- oxide based passivating layer\nsufficiently protected the bare metal for further oxidation. Quantitative\ncharge to oxygen- (OER) and charge to hydrogen (HER) conversion was confirmed.\nHigh resolution XPS spectra showed that most likely gamma-NiO(OH) and FeO(OH)\nare the catalytic active OER and NiO is the catalytic active HER species.\n", "  Water splitting allows the storage of solar energy into chemical bonds\n(H2+O2) and will help to implement the urgently needed replacement of limited\navailable fossil fuels. Particularly in neutral environment electrochemically\ninitiated water splitting suffers from low efficiency due to high\noverpotentials caused by the anode. Electro-activation of X20CoCrWMo10-9, a\nCo-based tool steel resulted in a new composite material\n(X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4) that catalyzes the anode half-cell reaction of water\nelectrolysis with a so far unequalled effectiveness. The current density\nachieved with this new anode in pH 7 corrected 0.1 M phosphate buffer is over a\nwide range of overpotentials around 10 times higher compared to recently\ndeveloped, up-to-date electrocatalysts and represents the benchmark performance\nadvanced catalysts show in regimes that support water splitting significantly\nbetter than pH 7 medium. X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 exhibited electrocatalytic\nproperties not only at pH 7, but also at pH 13, which is much superior to the\nones of IrO2-RuO2, single-phase Co3O4- or Fe/Ni- based catalysts. Both XPS and\nFT-IR experiments unmasked Co3O4 as the dominating compound on the surface of\nthe X20CoCrWMo10-9//Co3O4 composite. Upon a comprehensive dual beam FIB-SEM\n(focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy) study we could show that the\nnew composite does not exhibit a classical substrate-layer structure due to the\nintrinsic formation of the Co-enriched outer zone. This structural\nparticularity is basically responsible for the outstanding electrocatalytic OER\nperformance.\n", "  The least-squares support vector machine is a frequently used kernel method\nfor non-linear regression and classification tasks. Here we discuss several\napproximation algorithms for the least-squares support vector machine\nclassifier. The proposed methods are based on randomized block kernel matrices,\nand we show that they provide good accuracy and reliable scaling for\nmulti-class classification problems with relatively large data sets. Also, we\npresent several numerical experiments that illustrate the practical\napplicability of the proposed methods.\n", "  The equivalence between the Lanczos-Lovelock and teleparallel gravities is\ndiscused. It is shown that the teleparallel equivalent of the Lovelock gravity\naction is generated by dimensional continuation of the teleparallel equivalent\nof the Euler characteristics associated to all the lower even dimensions. It is\nalso found that the teleparallel equivalent of the (i) d-dimensional Euler\ncharacteristic is a closed form and gauge invariant, (ii) Lovelock action are\ninvariant both under the Poincare group and diffeomorphisms.\n", "  Biological membranes are essential for the cell life and hydration water\nprovides the driving force for their assembly and stability. Here we study the\nstructural properties of water in a phospholipid membrane. We characterize\nlocal structures inspecting the intermediate range order (IRO) adopting a\nsensitive local order metric, recently proposed by Martelli et al., which\nmeasures and grades the degree of overlap of local environments with structures\nof perfect ice. Close to the membrane, water acquires high IRO and changes its\ndynamical properties, e.g., slowing down its translational and rotational\ndegrees of freedom in a region that extends over $\\simeq 1$ nm from the\nmembrane interface. Surprisingly, we show that at a distance as far as $\\simeq\n2.5$ nm from the interface, although the bulk-like dynamics is recovered,\nwater's IRO is still slightly higher than in bulk at the same thermodynamic\nconditions. Therefore, the water-membrane interface has a structural effect at\nambient conditions that propagates further than the often-invoked $1$ nm-length\nscale, a results that should be taken carefully into account when analyzing\nexperimental data of water confined by membranes and could help us\nunderstanding the role of water in biological systems.\n", "  We propose a new method for generating equilibrium models of spherical\nsystems of collisionless particles that are finite in extent, but whose central\nregions resemble dark matter halos from cosmological simulations. This method\ninvolves iteratively removing unbound particles from a Navarro-Frenk-White\nprofile truncated sharply at some radius. The resulting models are extremely\nstable, and thus provide a good starting point for N-body simulations of\nisolated halos. We provide a code to generate such models for NFW and a variety\nof other common density profiles. We then develop an analytic approximation to\nthis truncated distribution function. Our method proceeds by analogy with the\nKing model, truncating and shifting the original distribution function of an\ninfinitely extended Navarro-Frenk-White profile in energy space. We show that\nthe density profiles of our models closely resemble the tidally truncated\ndensity profiles seen previously in studies of satellite evolution. Pursuing\nthis analogy further with a series of simulations of tidal mass loss, we find\nthat our models provide a good approximation to the full distribution function\nof tidally stripped systems, thus allowing theoretically motivated phase-space\ncalculations for such systems.\n", "  Our published and new experimental results by means of deuteron NMR\nspectroscopy in studies of molecular mobility in confinement are summarized and\nannalysed. Conclusions about limits of applicability of methods in disclosing\nseveral features are achieved. A set of molecules: D2, CD4, D2O, ND3, CD3OD and\n(CD3)2CO was chosen and introduced into zeolites with faujasite structure.\nMeasurements of deuteron spectra and relaxation in function of loading and\ntemperature provide a wealth of cases. A tranistion from translational into\nrotational mobility on decreasing temperature was a common obsevation. Fast\nmagnetization exchange between two subsystems with different mobility was\nconsidered as a model. Existence of D2O clusters and trimers of CD3OD was a\nparticularly significant evidence for importance of mutual ineractions.\nEvolution of spectral components, derivation of the activation energy and T1/T2\nratio are among analysed features. Choice of the zeolite, eg. NaY or NaX,\nintroduces specific inertactions with the zeolite framework. Temperature at\nwich molecules become immobilized on cage walls is related to the strength of\nthe interactions. On increasing temperature we may observe features like for\nlayers of liquid on cage walls and gaseus state. In general properly chosen\nmolecules may be used for characterization of host microporous systems.\n", "  Arrays of aligned nanorods oriented perpendicular to a support, which are\naccessible by top-down lithography or by means of shape-defining hard\ntemplates, have received increasing interest as sensor components, components\nfor nanophotonics and nanoelectronics, substrates for tissue engineering,\nsur-faces having specific adhesive or antiadhesive properties and as surfaces\nwith customized wettability. Agglomeration of the nanorods deteriorates the\nperformance of components based on nanorod arrays. A comprehensive body of\nliterature deals with mechanical failure mechanisms of nanorods and design\ncriteria for mechanically stable nanorod arrays. However, the structural\nintegrity of nanorod arrays is commonly evaluated only visually and\nqualitatively. We use real-space analysis of microscopic images to quantify the\nfraction of condensed nanorods in nanorod arrays. We suggest the number of\narray elements apparent in the micrographs divided by the number of array\nelements a defect-free array would contain in the same area, referred to as\nintegrity fraction, as a measure of structural array integrity. Reproducible\nprocedures to determine the imaged number of array elements are introduced.\nThus, quantitative comparisons of different nanorod arrays, or of one nanorod\narray at different stages of its use, are possible. Structural integrities of\nidentical nanorod arrays differing only in the length of the nanorods are\nexemplarily analyzed.\n", "  Applying Dixon's general equations of motion for extended bodies, we compute\nthe Papapetrou's equations for an extended test body on static and isotropic\nmetrics. We incorporate the force and the torque terms which involve multipole\nmoments, beyond dipole moment, from the energy-momentum tensor. We obtain the\nvector form equations for both Corinaldesi-Papapetrou and Tulczyjew-Dixon spin\nsupplementary conditions. An expanded effective mass, including interactions\nbetween the structure of the body and the gravitational field, is also found.\n", "  The study of fluctuation-induced transport is concerned with the directed\nmotion of particles on a substrate when subjected to a fluctuating external\nfield. Work over the last two decades provides now precise clues on how the\naverage transport depends on three fundamental aspects: the shape of the\nsubstrate, the correlations of the fluctuations and the mass, geometry,\ninteraction and density of the particles. These three aspects, reviewed here,\nacquire additional relevance because the same notions apply to a bewildering\nvariety of problems at very different scales, from the small nano or\nmicro-scale, where thermal fluctuations effects dominate, up to very large\nscales including ubiquitous cooperative phenomena in granular materials.\n", "  We consider quantum, nondterministic and probabilistic versions of known\ncomputational model Ordered Read-$k$-times Branching Programs or Ordered Binary\nDecision Diagrams with repeated test ($k$-QOBDD, $k$-NOBDD and $k$-POBDD). We\nshow width hierarchy for complexity classes of Boolean function computed by\nthese models and discuss relation between different variants of $k$-OBDD.\n", "  We study a semi-linear version of the Skyrme system due to Adkins and Nappi.\nThe objects in this system are maps from $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski space\ninto the $3$-sphere and 1-forms on $\\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, coupled via a Lagrangian\naction. Under a co-rotational symmetry reduction we establish the existence,\nuniqueness, and unconditional asymptotic stability of a family of stationary\nsolutions $Q_n$, indexed by the topological degree $n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\n\\{0\\}$ of the underlying map. We also prove that an arbitrarily large\nequivariant perturbation of $Q_n$ leads to a globally defined solution that\nscatters to $Q_n$ in infinite time as long as the critical norm for the\nsolution remains bounded on the maximal interval of existence given by the\nlocal Cauchy theory. We remark that the evolution equations are super-critical\nwith respect to the conserved energy.\n", "  We study the behavior of entanglement between different degrees of freedom of\nscattering fermions, based on an exemplary QED scattering process\n$e^+e^-\\longrightarrow\\mu^+\\mu^-$. The variation of entanglement entropy\nbetween two fermions from an initial state to the final state was computed,\nwith respect to different entanglement between the ingoing particles. This\nvariation of entanglement entropy is found to be proportional to an area\nquantity, the total cross section. We also study the spin-momentum and\nhelicity-momentum entanglements within one particle in the aforementioned\nscattering process. The calculations of the relevant variations of mutual\ninformation in the same inertial frame reveals that, for a maximally entangled\ninitial state, the scattering between the particles does not affect the degree\nof both of these entanglements of one particle in the final state. It is also\nfound that the increasing degree of entanglement between two ingoing particles\nwould restrict the generation of entanglement between spin (helicity) and\nmomentum of one outgoing particle. And the entanglement between spin and\nmomentum within one particle in the final state is shown to always be stronger\nthan that for helicity-momentum for a general initial entanglement state,\nimplying significantly distinct properties of entanglement for the helicity and\nspin perceived by an inertial observer.\n", "  Study of the Abrikosov vortex motion in superconductors based on\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations reveals an opportunity to locally\ndetect the values of the Aharonov-Bohm type curl-less vector potentials.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new method of measuring Hubble parameter($H(z)$),\nmaking use of the anisotropy of luminosity distance($d_{L}$), and the analysis\nof gravitational wave(GW) of neutron star(NS) binary system. The method has\nnever been put into practice before due to the lack of the ability of detecting\nGW. LIGO's success in detecting GW of black hole(BH) binary system merger\nannounced the possibility of this new method. We apply this method to several\nGW detecting projects, including Advanced LIGO(Adv-LIGO), Einstein\nTelescope(ET) and DECIGO, finding that the $H(z)$ by Adv-LIGO and ET is of bad\naccuracy, while the $H(z)$ by DECIGO shows a good accuracy. We use the error\ninformation of $H(z)$ by DECIGO to simulate $H(z)$ data at every 0.1 redshift\nspan, and put the mock data into the forecasting of cosmological parameters.\nCompared with the available 38 observed $H(z)$ data(OHD), mock data shows an\nobviously tighter constraint on cosmological parameters, and a concomitantly\nhigher value of Figure of Merit(FoM). For a 3-year-observation by standard\nsirens of DECIGO, the FoM value is as high as 834.9. If a 10-year-observation\nis launched, the FoM could reach 2783.1. For comparison, the FoM of 38 actual\nobserved $H(z)$ data is 9.3. These improvement indicates that the new method\nhas great potential in further cosmological constraints.\n", "  In this paper we study certain integrability properties of the supersymmetric\nsine-Gordon equation. We construct Lax pairs with their zero-curvature\nrepresentations which are equivalent to the supersymmetric sine-Gordon\nequation. From the fermionic linear spectral problem, we derive coupled sets of\nsuper Riccati equations and the auto-B\\\"acklund transformation of the\nsupersymmetric sine-Gordon equation. In addition, a detailed description of the\nassociated Darboux transformation is presented and non-trivial super\nmultisoliton solutions are constructed. These integrability properties allow us\nto provide new explicit geometric characterizations of the bosonic\nsupersymmetric version of the Sym--Tafel formula for the immersion of surfaces\nin a Lie superalgebra. These characterizations are expressed only in terms of\nthe independent bosonic and fermionic variables.\n", "  We have resolved for the first time the radial and vertical structure of the\nalmost edge-on envelope/disk system of the low-mass Class 0 protostar L1527.\nFor that, we have used ALMA observations with a spatial resolution of\n0.25$^{\\prime\\prime}$$\\times$0.13$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and\n0.37$^{\\prime\\prime}$$\\times$0.23$^{\\prime\\prime}$ at 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm,\nrespectively. The L1527 dust continuum emission has a deconvolved size of 78 au\n$\\times$ 21 au, and shows a flared disk-like structure. A thin\ninfalling-rotating envelope is seen in the CCH emission outward of about 150\nau, and its thickness is increased by a factor of 2 inward of it. This radius\nlies between the centrifugal radius (200 au) and the centrifugal barrier of the\ninfalling-rotating envelope (100 au). The gas stagnates in front of the\ncentrifugal barrier and moves toward vertical directions. SO emission is\nconcentrated around and inside the centrifugal barrier. The rotation speed of\nthe SO emitting gas is found to be decelerated around the centrifugal barrier.\nA part of the angular momentum could be extracted by the gas which moves away\nfrom the mid-plane around the centrifugal barrier. If this is the case, the\ncentrifugal barrier would be related to the launching mechanism of low velocity\noutflows, such as disk winds.\n", "  Speeding up adiabatic method has attracted much attention with the wide\napplications in quantum information processing. In this paper, two kinds of\nmethods, Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant-based inverse engineering and\ntransitionless quantum driving are applied to implement speeding up adiabatic\nstate conversion in optomechanical system. The perfect population transfer can\nbe achieved within a short time. At last, the energetic cost is analysed for\nthe transitionless quantum driving.\n", "  Coupled metronomes serve as a paradigmatic model for exploring the collective\nbehaviors of complex dynamical systems, as well as a classical setup for\nclassroom demonstrations of synchronization phenomena. Whereas previous studies\nof metronome synchronization have been concentrating on symmetric coupling\nschemes, here we consider the asymmetric case by adopting the scheme of layered\nmetronomes. Specifically, we place two metronomes on each layer, and couple two\nlayers by placing one on top of the other. By varying the initial conditions of\nthe metronomes and adjusting the friction between the two layers, a variety of\nsynchronous patterns are observed in experiment, including the splay\nsynchronization (SS) state, the generalized splay synchronization (GSS) state ,\nthe anti-phase synchronization (APS) state, the in-phase delay synchronization\n(IPDS) state, and the in-phase synchronization (IPS) state. In particular, the\nIPDS state, in which the metronomes on each layer are synchronized in phase but\nare of a constant phase delay to metronomes on the other layer, is observed for\nthe first time. In addition, a new technique based on audio signals is proposed\nfor pattern detection, which is more convenient and easier to apply than the\nexisting acquisition techniques. Furthermore, a theoretical model is developed\nto explain the experimental observations, and is employed to explore the\ndynamical properties of the patterns, including the basin distributions and the\npattern transitions. Our study sheds new lights on the collective behaviors of\ncoupled metronomes, and the developed setup can be used in the classroom for\ndemonstration purposes.\n", "  A third order real tensor is called a piezoelectric-type tensor if it is\npartially symmetric with respect to its last two indices. The piezoelectric\ntensor is a piezoelectric-type tensor of dimension three. We introduce\nC-eigenvalues and C-eigenvectors for piezoelectric-type tensors. Here, \"C\"\nnames after Curie brothers, who first discovered the piezoelectric effect. We\nshow that C-eigenvalues always exist, they are invariant under orthonormal\ntransformations, and for a piezoelectric-type tensor, the largest C-eigenvalue\nand its C-eigenvectors form the best rank-one piezoelectric-type approximation\nof that tensor. This means that for the piezoelectric tensor, its largest\nC-eigenvalue determines the highest piezoelectric coupling constant. We further\nshow that for the piezoelectric tensor, the largest C-eigenvalue corresponds to\nthe electric displacement vector with the largest $2$-norm in the piezoelectric\neffect under unit uniaxial stress, and the strain tensor with the largest\n$2$-norm in the converse piezoelectric effect under unit electric field vector.\nThus, C-eigenvalues and C-eigenvectors have concrete physical meanings in\npiezoelectric effect and converse piezoelectric effect. Finally, we apply\nC-eigenvalues and associated C-eigenvectors for various piezoelectric crystals\nwith different symmetries.\n", "  (This is a recompiled version of $Chin. J. of Phys., Vol. 26, No. 4, 180$\nsince the previous available electronic document on web was unreadable)\n  We impose a permutation symmetry S3 upon the two Higgs doublet extension of\nthe SU(2) x U( 1) standard model, and then break S3 symmetry spontaneously. A\nmass relation is obtained from which the mass of the top quark is predicted to\nbe 39 Gev at 1 Gev renormalization scale, if the relative strength between the\ncoupling of the first Higgs field with the up-type quarks is assumed to be the\nsame as that with the down-type quarks. We find that in our model the flavor\nchanging neutral currents vanish automatically.\n", "  We report a large linear magnetoresistance in Cu$_{2-x}$Te, reaching\n$\\Delta\\rho/\\rho(0)$ = 250\\% at 2 K in a 9 T field. This is observed for\nsamples with $x$ in the range 0.13 to 0.22, and the results are comparable to\nthe effects observed in Ag$_2 X$ materials, although in this case the results\nappear for a much wider range of bulk carrier density. Examining the magnitude\nvs. crossover field from low-field quadratic to high-field linear behavior, we\nshow that models based on classical transport behavior best explain the\nobserved results. The effects are traced to misdirected currents due to\ntopologically inverted behavior in this system, such that stable surface states\nprovide the high mobility transport channels. The resistivity also crosses over\nto a $T^2$ dependence in the temperature range where the large linear MR\nappears, an indicator of electron-electron interaction effects within the\nsurface states. Thus this is an example of a system in which these interactions\ndominate the low-temperature behavior of the surface states.\n", "  We give explicit Fredholm conditions for classes of pseudodifferential\noperators on suitable singular and non-compact spaces. In particular, we\ninclude a \"user's guide\" to Fredholm conditions on particular classes of\nmanifolds including asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds, asymptotically\nEuclidean (or conic) manifolds, and manifolds with poly-cylindrical ends. The\nreader interested in applications should be able read right away the results\nrelated to those examples, beginning with Section 5. Our general, theoretical\nresults are that an operator adapted to the geometry is Fredholm if, and only\nif, it is elliptic and all its limit operators, in a sense to be made precise,\nare invertible. Central to our theoretical results is the concept of a Fredholm\ngroupoid, which is the class of groupoids for which this characterization of\nthe Fredholm condition is valid. We use the notions of exhaustive and strictly\nspectral families of representations to obtain a general characterization of\nFredholm groupoids. In particular, we introduce the class of the so-called\ngroupoids with Exel's property as the groupoids for which the regular\nrepresentations are exhaustive. We show that the class of \"stratified\nsubmersion groupoids\" has Exel's property, where stratified submersion\ngroupoids are defined by glueing fibered pull-backs of bundles of Lie groups.\nWe prove that a stratified submersion groupoid is Fredholm whenever its\nisotropy groups are amenable. Many groupoids, and hence many pseudodifferential\noperators appearing in practice, fit into this framework. This fact is explored\nto yield Fredholm conditions not only in the above mentioned classes, but also\non manifolds that are obtained by desingularization or by blow-up of singular\nsets.\n", "  We analyze a similar scheme for producing light-mediated entanglement between\natomic ensembles, as first realized by Julsgaard, Kozhekin and Polzik [Nature\n{\\bf 413}, 400 (2001)]. In the standard approach to modeling the scheme, a\nHolstein-Primakoff approximation is made, where the atomic ensembles are\ntreated as bosonic modes, and is only valid for short interaction times. In\nthis paper, we solve the time evolution without this approximation, which\nextends the region of validity of the interaction time. For short entangling\ntimes, we find this produces a state with similar characteristics as a two-mode\nsqueezed state, in agreement with standard predictions. For long entangling\ntimes, the state evolves into a non-Gaussian form, and the two-mode squeezed\nstate characteristics start to diminish. This is attributed to more exotic\ntypes of entangled states being generated. We characterize the states by\nexamining the Fock state probability distributions, Husimi $Q$ distributions,\nand non-local entanglement between the ensembles. We compare and connect\nseveral quantities obtained using the Holstein-Primakoff approach and our exact\ntime evolution methods.\n", "  I discuss two related nonlinear mechanisms of tidal dissipation that require\nfinite tidal deformations for their operation: the elliptical instability and\nthe precessional instability. Both are likely to be important for the tidal\nevolution of short-period extrasolar planets. The elliptical instability is a\nfluid instability of elliptical streamlines, such as in tidally deformed\nnon-synchronously rotating or non-circularly orbiting planets. I summarise the\nresults of local and global simulations that indicate this mechanism to be\nimportant for tidal spin synchronisation, planetary spin-orbit alignment and\norbital circularisation for the shortest period hot Jupiters. The precessional\ninstability is a fluid instability that occurs in planets undergoing axial\nprecession, such as those with spin-orbit misalignments (non-zero obliquities).\nI summarise the outcome of local MHD simulations designed to study the\nturbulent damping of axial precession, which suggest this mechanism to be\nimportant in driving tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle for hot Jupiters.\nAvenues for future work are also discussed.\n", "  In the case of the discrete time coined quantum walk the reduced dynamics of\nthe coin shows non-Markovian recurrence features due to information back-flow\nfrom the position degree of freedom. Here we study how this non-Markovian\nbehavior is modified in the presence of open system dynamics. In the process,\nwe obtain useful insights into the nature of non-Markovian physics. In\nparticular, we show that in the case of (non-Markovian) random telegraph noise\n(RTN), a further discernbile recurrence feature is present in the dynamics.\nMoreover, this feature is correlated with the localization of the walker. On\nthe other hand, no additional recurruence feature appears for other\nnon-Markovian types of noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Power Law noise). We\npropose a power spectral method for comparing the relative strengths of the\nnon-Markovian component due to the external noise and that due to the internal\nposition degree of freedom.\n", "  We review the most relevant LHC searches at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV looking for\nlow mass bosons arising from exotic decay of the Standard Model Higgs and\nhighlighting their impact on both supersymmetric and not supersymmetric Beyond\nthe Standard Model scenarios.\n", "  We prove that the twisted De Rham cohomology of a flat vector bundleover some\nsmooth manifold is isomorphic to the cohomology of invariant\nPollicott--Ruelleresonant states associated with Anosov and Morse--Smale flows.\nAs a consequence, weobtain generalized Morse inequalities for such flows. In\nthe case of Morse--Smale flows,we relate the resonances lying on the imaginary\naxis with the twisted Fuller measuresused by Fried in his work on Reidemeister\ntorsion. In particular, when V is a nonsingularMorse-Smale flow, we show that\nthe Reidemeister torsion can be recovered from the onlyknowledge of dynamical\nresonances on the imaginary axis by expressing the torsion as azeta regularized\ninfinite product of these resonances.\n", "  The goal of the present work is to compute explicitely the correlation\nspectrum of a Morse-Smale flow in terms of the Lyapunov exponents of the\nMorse--Smale flow, the topology of the flow around periodic orbits and the\nmonodromy of some given flat connection. The corresponding eigenvalues exhibit\nvertical bands when the flow has periodic orbits. As a corollary, we obtain\nsharp Weyl asymptotics for the dynamical resonances.\n", "  This paper reports the phenomenon of resonance weakening and streaming onset\nin two phase acoustofluidics by performing numerical simulations of a capillary\ndroplet suspended in a microfluidic chamber. The simulations show that\ndepending on the relative acoustic properties of the two phases, it is possible\nto observe (i)~the decrease in the total acoustic energy as the oscillation\namplitude at the wall increases, and (ii)~the onset of acoustic streaming. The\nimpact of these findings in terms of acoustic focusing inside droplets is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  This work presents epitaxial growth and optical spectroscopy of CdTe quantum\ndots (QDs) in (Cd,Zn,Mg)Te barriers placed on the top of (Cd,Zn,Mg)Te\ndistributed Bragg reflector. The formed photonic mode in our half-cavity\nstructure permits to enhance the local excitation intensity and extraction\nefficiency of the QD photoluminescence, while suppressing the reflectance\nwithin the spectral range covering the QD transitions. This allows to perform\ncoherent, nonlinear, resonant spectroscopy of individual QDs. The coherence\ndynamics of a charged exciton is measured via four-wave mixing, with the\nestimated dephasing time $T_2=(210\\,\\pm\\,40)$ ps. The same structure contains\nQDs doped with single Mn$^{2+}$ ions, as detected in photoluminescence spectra.\nOur work therefore paves the way toward investigating and controlling an\nexciton coherence coupled, via $s$,$p$-$d$ exchange interaction, with an\nindividual spin of a magnetic dopant.\n", "  Many species of millimetric fungus-harvesting termites collectively build\nuninhabited, massive mound structures enclosing a network of broad tunnels\nwhich protrude from the ground meters above their subterranean nests. It is\nwidely accepted that the purpose of these mounds is to give the colony a\ncontrolled micro-climate in which to raise fungus and brood by managing heat,\nhumidity, and respiratory gas exchange. While different hypotheses such as\nsteady and fluctuating external wind and internal metabolic heating have been\nproposed for ventilating the mound, the absence of direct in-situ measurement\nof internal air flows has precluded a definitive mechanism for this critical\nphysiological function. By measuring diurnal variations in flow through the\nsurface conduits of the mounds of the species Odontotermes obesus, we show that\na simple combination of geometry, heterogeneous thermal mass and porosity\nallows the mounds to use diurnal ambient temperature oscillations for\nventilation. In particular, the thin outer flute-like conduits heat up rapidly\nduring the day relative to the deeper chimneys, pushing air up the flutes and\ndown the chimney in a closed convection cell, with the converse situation at\nnight. These cyclic flows in the mound flush out $\\text{CO}_2$ from the nest\nand ventilate the colony, in a novel example of deriving useful work from\nthermal oscillations.\n", "  The possibility of calculation of the conditional and unconditional\ncomplexity of description of information objects in the algorithmic theory of\ninformation is connected with the limitations for the set of the used languages\nof programming (description). The results of calculation of the conditional\ncomplexity allow introducing the fundamental information dimensions and the\npartial ordering in the set of information objects, and the requirement of\nequality of languages allows introducing the vector space. In case of optimum\ncompression, the \"prefix\" contains the regular part of the information about\nthe object, and is analogous to the classical trajectory of a material point in\nthe physical space, and the \"suffix\" contains the random part of the\ninformation, the quantity of which is analogous to the physical time in the\nintrinsic reference system. Analysis of the mechanism of the \"Einstein's clock\"\nallows representing the result of observation of the material point as a word,\nwritten down in a binary alphabet, thus making the aforesaid analogies more\nclear. The kinematics of the information trajectories is described by the\nLorentz's transformations, identically to its physical analog. At the same\ntime, various languages of description are associated with various reference\nsystems in physics. In the present paper, the information analog of the\nprinciple of least action is found and the main problems of information\ndynamics in the constructed space are formulated.\n", "  Variational principles for magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) were introduced by\nprevious authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. In this paper we\nintroduce simpler Eulerian variational principles from which all the relevant\nequations of non-barotropic MHD can be derived for certain field topologies.\n  The variational principle is given in terms of five independent functions for\nnon-stationary non-barotropic flows. This is less then the eight variables\nwhich appear in the standard equations of barotropic MHD which are the magnetic\nfield $\\vec B$ the velocity field $\\vec v$, the entropy $s$ and the density\n$\\rho$.\n  The case of non-barotropic MHD in which the internal energy is a function of\nboth entropy and density was not discussed in previous works which were\nconcerned with the simplistic barotropic case. It is important to understand\nthe rule of entropy and temperature for the variational analysis of MHD. Thus\nwe introduce a variational principle of non-barotropic MHD and show that five\nfunctions will suffice to describe this physical system.\n  We will also discuss the implications of the above analysis for topological\nconstants. It will be shown that while cross helicity is not conserved for\nnon-barotropic MHD a variant of this quantity is. The implications of this to\nnon-barotropic MHD stability is discussed.\n", "  It has been found that a model of extended electrons is more suited to\ndescribe theoretical simulations and experimental results obtained via scanning\ntunnelling microscopes, but while the dynamic properties are easily\nincorporated, magnetic properties, and in particular electron spin properties\npose a problem due to their conceived isotropy in the absence of measurement.\nThe spin of an electron reacts with a magnetic field and thus has the\nproperties of a vector. However, electron spin is also isotropic, suggesting\nthat it does not have the properties of a vector. This central conflict in the\ndescription of an electron's spin, we believe, is the root of many of the\nparadoxical properties measured and postulated for quantum spin particles.\nExploiting a model in which the electron spin is described consistently in real\nthree-dimensional space - an extended electron model - we demonstrate that spin\nmay be described by a vector and still maintain its isotropy. In this\nframework, we re-evaluate the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments, and the effect of consecutive measurements\nand find in all cases a fairly intuitive explanation.\n", "  The gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6-5856 is known to be composed of a massive\nstar with a compact object with an orbital period of 16.54 days. We study\nmechanisms of high-energy emissions (X-ray, GeV, and TeV $\\gamma$-rays) from\nthis binary system. The paper is composed of two parts. In the first part, we\nre-analyze the GeV emission from 1FGL J1018.6-5856 using 7 yrs of the\nobservational data of \\textit{Fermi}/LAT. The data analysis of phase-resolved\nspectrum suggests that the 0.1-10 GeV emissions may contain two different\ncomponents: (1) a simple power-law with exponential cutoff component in the LOW\nstate; (2) an additional component extended to $\\sim $10 GeV in the HIGH state.\nIn the second part, we develop a model to explain the multi-wavelength\nemissions of this binary. Assuming that 1FGL J1018.6-5856 includes a pulsar,\nthe GeV spectrum in the LOW state can be well explained by the two-layer outer\ngap model of pulsar magnetosphere. As the pulsar is orbiting around the star,\nthe pulsar is considered to be wrapped by two kinds of termination shock: a bow\nshock due to the interaction between pulsar wind and stellar wind, and a back\nshock due to the effect of orbital motion. We proposed that X-rays are mainly\nproduced by the synchrotron radiation at the apex of the bow shock, and TeV\n$\\gamma$-rays are mainly produced by the inverse-Compton scattering at the back\nshock. The sharp peak in X-ray and TeV light curves are produced by in the\nshock tail due to the Doppler boosting effect at inferior-conjunction while\nanother broad sinusoidal modulations are possibly produced by the apex of the\nbow shock and the back shock due to variations of shock conditions.\n", "  The new event generator TWOPEG for the channel $e p \\rightarrow e' p' \\pi^{+}\n\\pi^{-}$ has been developed. It uses an advanced method of event generation\nwith weights and employs the five-fold differential structure functions from\nthe recent versions of the JM model fit to all results on charged double pion\nphoto- and electroproduction cross sections from CLAS (both published and\npreliminary). In the areas covered by measured CLAS data, TWOPEG successfully\nreproduces the available integrated and single-differential double pion cross\nsections. To estimate the cross sections in the regions not covered by data, a\nspecialized extrapolation procedure is applied. The EG currently covers a\nkinematical area in $Q^2$ starting from 0.0005 GeV$^2$ and in $W$ from the\nreaction threshold up to 4.5 GeV. TWOPEG allows to obtain the cross section\nvalues from the generated distributions and simulates radiative effects. The\nlink to the code is provided. TWOPEG has already been used in CLAS data\nanalyses and in PAC proposal preparations and is designed to be used during the\nCLAS12 era.\n", "  We are developing position sensitive silicon detectors (PSD) which have an\nelectrode at each of four corners so that the incident position of a charged\nparticle can be obtained using signals from the electrodes. It is expected that\nthe position resolution the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of the ILD\ndetector will be improved by introducing PSD into the detection layers. In this\nstudy, we irradiated collimated laser beams to the surface of the PSD, varying\nthe incident position. We found that the incident position can be well\nreconstructed from the signals if high resistance is implemented in the p+\nlayer. We also tried to observe the signal of particles by placing a radiative\nsource on the PSD sensor.\n", "  We discuss various universality aspects of numerical computations using\nstandard algorithms. These aspects include empirical observations and rigorous\nresults. We also make various speculations about computation in a broader\nsense.\n", "  In this work we study the mass distribution of two irregular galaxies, UGC\n6446 and UGC 7524, by means of HI rotation curves derived from high resolution\nHI velocity fields obtained through the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope\ndata archive. We constrain the stellar and gas content of both galaxies with\nstellar population synthesis models and by deriving the HI+He+metals rotation\ncurves from the total HI surface density maps, respectively. The discrepancy\nbetween the circular velocity maxima of the stellar plus the HI+He+metals\nrotation curves and the observed HI rotation curves of both galaxies requires\nthe inclusion of a substantial amount of dark matter. We explore the Navarro\nFrenk and White, Burkert, Di Cintio, Einasto and Stadel dark matter halo\nmodels. We obtain acceptable fits to the observed HI rotation curves of UGC\n6446 and UGC 7524 with the cored Burkert, Einasto and Stadel dark matter halos.\nIn particular, Einasto and Stadel models prove to be an appropriate alternative\nto the Burkert dark matter halo. This result should increase the empirical\nbasis that justify the usage of dark matter exponential models to adjust the\nobserved rotation curves of real galaxies.\n", "  SKIROC2 is an ASIC to readout the silicon pad detectors for the\nelectromagnetic calorimeter in the International Linear Collider.\nCharacteristics of SKIROC2 and the new version of SKIROC2A, packaged with BGA,\nare measured with testboards and charge injection. The results on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of both trigger and ADC output, threshold tuning\ncapability and timing resolution are presented.\n", "  Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of a hexamer cluster of the protic\nionic liquid ethylammonium nitrate are performed using density functional\ntheory (DFT) and density functional-based tight binding (DFTB) methods. The\nfocus is on assessing the performance of the DFTB approach to describe the\ndynamics and infrared spectroscopic signatures of hydrogen bonding between the\nions. Average geometries and geometric correlations are found to be rather\nsimilar. The same holds true for the far-infrared spectral region. Differences\nare more pronounced for the NH- and CH-stretching band, where DFTB predicts a\nbroader intensity distribution. DFTB completely fails to describe the\nfingerprint range shaped by nitrate anion vibrations. Finally, charge\nfluctuations within the H-bonds are characterized yielding moderate\ndependencies on geometry. On the basis of these results, DFTB is recommend for\nthe simulation of H-bond properties of this type of ionic liquids.\n", "  Scientific illustrations, thanks to the vision of great artists fascinated by\nastronomical research and astronautics, have provided us with an accurate\ndepiction of the possible views which mankind will one day observed from\nlocations other than our planet. In this talk I will pay homage to some of\nthese geniuses who serve science, and underline the scientific, artistic,\npolitical, and social implications deriving from a wise use of space-art.\n", "  Compact object perturbations, at linear order, often lead in solving one or\nmore coupled wave equations. The study of these equations was typically done by\nnumerical or semi-analytical methods. The WKB method and the associated\nBohr-Sommerfeld rule have been proved extremely useful tools in the study of\nblack-hole perturbations and the estimation of the related quasi-normal modes.\nHere we present an extension of the aforementioned semi-analytic methods in the\nstudy of perturbations of ultra-compact stars and gravastars.\n", "  We present a study on the prediction of rogue waves during the 1-hour sea\nstate of Hurricane Joaquin when the Merchant Vessel El Faro sank east of the\nBahamas on October 1, 2015. High-resolution hindcast of hurricane-generated sea\nstates and wave simulations are combined with novel probabilistic models to\nquantify the likelihood of rogue wave conditions. The data suggests that the El\nFaro vessel was drifting at an average speed of approximately~$2.5$~m/s prior\nto its sinking. As a result, we estimated that the probability that El Faro\nencounters a rogue wave whose crest height exceeds 14 meters while drifting\nover a time interval of 10~(50) minutes is $\\sim1/400$~$(1/130)$. The largest\nsimulated rogue wave has similar generating mechanism and characteristics of\nthe Andrea, Draupner and Killard rogue waves as the constructive interference\nof elementary waves enhanced by bound nonlinearities.\n", "  The Ashtekar formulation of 2+1 gravity differs from the geometrodynamical\nand Witten descriptions when the 2-metric is degenerate. We study the phase\nspace of 2+1 gravity in the Ashtekar formulation to understand these degenerate\nsolutions to the field equations. In the process we find two new systems of\nfirst class constraints which describe part of the degenerate sectors of the\nAshtekar formulation. One of them also generalizes the Witten constraints.\nFinally we argue that the Ashtekar formulation has an arbitrarily large number\nof degrees of freedom in contrast to the usual descriptions.

We analyze first the\nHusain-Kucha\\v{r} model and find a two connection description for it.\nIntroducing a suitable scalar constraint in this phase space we get a\nHamiltonian formulation of gravity that is close to the Ashtekar one, from\nwhich it is derived, but has some interesting features of its own. Among them a\npossible mechanism for dealing with the degenerate metrics and a neat way of\nwriting the constraints of General Relativity.\n", "  I show in this letter that it is possible to construct a Hamiltonian\ndescription for Lorentzian General Relativity in terms of two real $SO(3)$\nconnections. The constraints are simple polynomials in the basic variables. The\npresent framework gives us a new formulation of General Relativity that keeps\nsome of the interesting features of the Ashtekar formulation without the\ncomplications associated with the complex character of the latter.\n", "  We give in this paper a modified self-dual action that leads to the\n$SO(3)$-ADM formalism without having to face the difficult second class\nconstraints present in other approaches (for example if one starts from the\nHilbert-Palatini action). We use the new action principle to gain some new\ninsights into the problem of the reality conditions that must be imposed in\norder to get real formulations from complex general relativity. We derive also\na real formulation for Lorentzian general relativity in the Ashtekar phase\nspace by using the modified action presented in the paper.\n", "  I suggest in this letter a new strategy to attack the problem of the reality\nconditions in the Ashtekar approach to classical and quantum general\nrelativity. By writing a modified Hamiltonian constraint in the usual $SO(3)$\nYang-Mills phase space I show that it is possible to describe space-times with\nLorentzian signature without the introduction of complex variables. All the\nfeatures of the Ashtekar formalism related to the geometrical nature of the new\nvariables are retained; in particular, it is still possible, in principle, to\nuse the loop variables approach in the passage to the quantum theory. The key\nissue in the new formulation is how to deal with the more complicated\nHamiltonian constraint that must be used in order to avoid the introduction of\ncomplex fields.\n", "  I show in this letter that it is possible to solve some of the constraints of\nthe $SO(3)$-ADM formalism for general relativity by using an approach similar\nto the one introduced by Capovilla, Dell and Jacobson to solve the vector and\nscalar constraints in the Ashtekar variables framework. I discuss the\nadvantages of using the ADM formalism and compare the result with similar\nproposals for different Hamiltonian formulations of general relativity.\n", "  The constraint hypersurfaces defining the Witten and Ashtekar formulations\nfor 2+1 gravity are very different. In particular the constraint hypersurface\nin the Ashtekar case is not a manifold but consists of several sectors that\nintersect each other in a complicated way. The issue of how to define a\nconsistent dynamics in such a situation is then rather non-trivial. We discuss\nthis point by working out the details in a simplified (finite dimensional)\nhomogeneous reduction of 2+1 gravity in the Ashtekar formulation.\n", "  We show that the recent claim that the 2+1 dimensional Ashtekar formulation\nfor General Relativity has a finite number of physical degrees of freedom is\nnot correct.\n", "  We study the physical content of quadratic diff-invariant Lagrangians in\narbitrary dimensions by using covariant symplectic techniques. This paper\nextends previous results in dimension four. We discuss the difference between\nthe even and odd dimensional cases.\n", "  We generalize the exact solution to the Bernoulli shift map. Under certain\nconditions, the generalized functions can produce unpredictable dynamics. We\nuse the properties of the generalized functions to show that certain dynamical\nsystems can generate random dynamics. For instance, the chaotic Chua's circuit\ncoupled to a circuit with a non-invertible I-V characteristic can generate\nunpredictable dynamics. In general, a nonperiodic time-series with truncated\nexponential behavior can be converted into unpredictable dynamics using\nnon-invertible transformations. Using a new theoretical framework for chaos and\nrandomness, we investigate some classes of coupled map lattices. We show that,\nin some cases, these systems can produce completely unpredictable dynamics. In\na similar fashion, we explain why some wellknown spatiotemporal systems have\nbeen found to produce very complex dynamics in numerical simulations. We\ndiscuss real physical systems that can generate random dynamics.\n"]}
