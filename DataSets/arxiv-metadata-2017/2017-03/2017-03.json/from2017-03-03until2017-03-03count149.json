These are of the popular J-K\nform, where the function of the occupation numbers that multiplies the Fock\norbital term is written as a Pade approximant. The coefficients of the Pade are\noptimized for a testset of eight molecules, and then refined for a larger set\nof 35 molecules. Two different approaches were tried, either keeping the\nself-interaction terms, or by removing them explicitly from the functional. The\nfunctionals thus obtained involve very few parameters, but are able to\noutperform other RDMFT functionals, yielding correlation energies that are, on\naverage, even slightly better than Moeller-Plesset MP2 theory.\n", "  Reduced density-matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is a promising alternative\napproach to the problem of electron correlation. Like standard density\nfunctional theory, it contains an unknown exchange-correlation functional, for\nwhich several approximations have been proposed in the last years. In this\narticle, we benchmark some of these functionals in an extended set of molecules\nwith respect to total and atomization energies. Our results show that the most\nrecent RDMFT functionals give very satisfactory results compared to more\ninvolved quantum chemistry and density functional approaches.\n", "  We briefly review the problems and prospects of the standard lore of dark\nenergy and notice that the cosmological constant problems are often over\nemphasized. In order to keep the discussion pedagogical aimed at a wider\naudience, we have avoided technical complications in several places and\nresorted to heuristic arguments based on physical perceptions. We presented\nunderlying ideas of modified theories based upon chameleon mechanism and\nVainshtein screening. We have given a lucid illustration of recently\ninvestigated ghost free non linear massive gravity. Again we have sacrificed\nrigor and confined to the basic ideas that led to the formulation of $dRGT$.\nThe review ends with a brief discussion on the difficulties of the theory\napplied to cosmology with an optimism that a consistent solution of the problem\nis round the corner.\n", "  Recently, we described a pathway analysis technique (paper 1) for analyzing\ngeneric schemes for single-molecule kinetics based upon the first-passage time\ndistribution. Here, we employ this method to derive expressions for the Poisson\nindicator, a measure of stochastic variation (essentially equivalent to the\nFano factor and Mandel's Q parameter), for various renewal (memoryless)\nenzymatic reactions. We examine its dependence on substrate concentration,\nwithout assuming all steps follow Poissonian kinetics. Based upon fitting to\nthe functional forms of the first two waiting time moments, we show that, to\nsecond order, the non-Poissonian kinetics are generally underdetermined but can\nbe specified in certain scenarios. For an enzymatic reaction with an arbitrary\nintermediate topology, we identify a generic minimum of the Poisson indicator\nas a function of substrate concentration, which can be used to tune substrate\nconcentration to the stochastic fluctuations and estimate the largest number of\nunderlying consecutive links in a turnover cycle. We identify a local maximum\nof the Poisson indicator (with respect to substrate concentration) for a\nrenewal process as a signature of competitive binding, either between a\nsubstrate and an inhibitor or between multiple substrates. Our analysis\nexplores the rich connections between Poisson indicator measurements and\nmicroscopic kinetic mechanisms.\n", "  In the last decades the problem of metastability has been attacked on\nrigorous grounds via many different approaches and techniques which are briefly\nreviewed in this paper. It is then useful to understand connections between\ndifferent point of views. In view of this we consider irreducible, aperiodic\nand reversible Markov chains with exponentially small transition probabilities\nin the framework of Metropolis dynamics. We compare two different cycle\ndecompositions and prove their equivalence.\n", "  We construct Hadamard states for the Yang-Mills equation linearized around a\nsmooth, space-compact background solution. We assume the spacetime is globally\nhyperbolic and its Cauchy surface is compact or equal $\\rr^d$. We first\nconsider the case when the spacetime is ultra-static, but the background\nsolution depends on time. By methods of pseudodifferential calculus we\nconstruct a parametrix for the associated vectorial Klein-Gordon equation. We\nthen obtain Hadamard two-point functions in the gauge theory, acting on Cauchy\ndata. A key role is played by classes of pseudodifferential operators that\ncontain microlocal or spectral type low-energy cutoffs. The general problem is\nreduced to the ultra-static spacetime case using an extension of the\ndeformation argument of Fulling, Narcowich and Wald. As an aside, we derive a\ncorrespondence between Hadamard states and parametrices for the Cauchy problem\nin ordinary quantum field theory.\n", "  We consider the focusing 2D non-linear Schr\\\"odinger equation, perturbed by a\ndamping term, and driven by multiplicative noise. We show that a physically\nmotivated trial solution does not collapse for any admissible initial condition\nalthough the exponent of the non-linearity is critical. Our method is based on\nthe construction of a global solution to a singular stochastic Hamiltonian\nsystem used to connect trial solution and Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We investigate the application of mesoscopic response functions (MRFs) to\ncharacterize a large set of networks of fungi and slime moulds grown under a\nwide variety of different experimental treatments, including inter-species\ncompetition and attack by fungivores. We construct 'structural networks' by\nestimating cord conductances (which yield edge weights) from the experimental\ndata, and we construct 'functional networks' by calculating edge weights based\non how much nutrient traffic is predicted to occur along each edge. Both types\nof networks have the same topology, and we compute MRFs for both families of\nnetworks to illustrate two different ways of constructing taxonomies to group\nthe networks into clusters of related fungi and slime moulds. Although both\nnetwork taxonomies generate intuitively sensible groupings of networks across\nspecies, treatments and laboratories, we find that clustering using the\nfunctional-network measure appears to give groups with lower intra-group\nvariation in species or treatments. We argue that MRFs provide a useful\nquantitative analysis of network behaviour that can (1) help summarize an\nexpanding set of increasingly complex biological networks and (2) help extract\ninformation that captures subtle changes in intra- and inter-specific\nphenotypic traits that are integral to a mechanistic understanding of fungal\nbehaviour and ecology. As an accompaniment to our paper, we also make a large\ndata set of fungal networks available in the public domain.\n", "  The occurrence of heterogeneous perturbations of fluid mass density and solid\nelastic strain of a porous continuum, as a consequence of its undrained\nresponse is a very important topic in theoretical and applied poromechanics.\nThe classical Mandel--Cryer effect provides an explanation of fluid\noverpressure in the central region of a porous sample, immediately after the\napplication of the loading. However this effect fades away when the fluid leaks\nout of the porous network. Here this problem is studied within the framework of\na second gradient theory and a thorough description of the static and the\ndynamics of the phenomenon is given.\n", "  Dynamics simulations of constrained particles can greatly aid in\nunderstanding the temporal and spatial evolution of biological processes such\nas lateral transport along membranes and self-assembly of viruses. Most\ntheoretical efforts in the field of diffusive transport have focussed on\nsolving the diffusion equation on curved surfaces, for which it is not\ntractable to incorporate particle interactions even though these play a crucial\nrole in crowded systems. We show here that it is possible to combine standard\nconstraint algorithms with the classical velocity Verlet scheme to perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations of particles constrained to an arbitrarily\ncurved surface, in which such interactions can be taken into account.\nFurthermore, unlike Brownian dynamics schemes in local coordinates, our method\nis based on Cartesian coordinates allowing for the reuse of many other standard\ntools without modifications, including parallelisation through domain\ndecomposition. We show that by applying the schemes to the Langevin equation\nfor various surfaces, confined Brownian motion is obtained, which has direct\napplications to many biological and physical problems. Finally we present two\npractical examples that highlight the applicability of the method: (i) the\ninfluence of crowding and shape on the lateral diffusion of proteins in curved\nmembranes and (ii) the self-assembly of a coarse-grained virus capsid protein\nmodel.\n", "  Heisenberg-type higher order symmetries are studied for both classical and\nquantum mechanical systems separable in cartesian coordinates. A few particular\ncases of this type of superintegrable systems were already considered in the\nliterature, but here they are characterized in full generality together with\ntheir integrability properties. Some of these systems are defined only in a\nregion of $\\mathbb R^n$, and in general they do not include bounded solutions.\nThe quantum symmetries and potentials are shown to reduce to their\nsuperintegrable classical analogs in the $\\hbar \\to0$ limit.\n", "  We study the effect on the stationary currents of constraints affecting the\nhopping rates in stochastic particle systems. In the framework of Zero Range\nProcesses with drift within a finite volume, we discuss how the current is\nreduced by the presence of the constraint and deduce exact formulae, fully\nexplicit in some cases. The model discussed here has been introduced in Ref.\n[1] and is relevant for the description of pedestrian motion in elongated dark\ncorridors, where the constraint on the hopping rates can be related to\nlimitations on the interaction distance among pedestrians.\n", "  We study the weak solvability of a system of coupled Allen-Cahn-like\nequations resembling cross-diffusion which is arising as a model for the\nconsolidation of saturated porous media. Besides using energy like estimates,\nwe cast the special structure of the system in the framework of the\nLeray-Schauder fixed point principle and ensure this way the local existence of\nstrong solutions to a regularised version of our system. Furthermore, weak\nconvergence techniques ensure the existence of weak solutions to the original\nconsolidation problem. The uniqueness of global-in-time solutions is guaranteed\nin a particular case. Moreover, we use a finite difference scheme to show the\nnegativity of the vector of solutions.\n", "  We present a new symplectic integrator designed for collisional gravitational\n$N$-body problems which makes use of Kepler solvers. The integrator is also\nreversible and conserves 9 integrals of motion of the $N$-body problem to\nmachine precision. The integrator is second order, but the order can easily be\nincreased by the method of \\citeauthor{yos90}. We use fixed time step in all\ntests studied in this paper to ensure preservation of symplecticity. We study\nsmall $N$ collisional problems and perform comparisons with typically used\nintegrators. In particular, we find comparable or better performance when\ncompared to the 4th order Hermite method and much better performance than\nadaptive time step symplectic integrators introduced previously. We find better\nperformance compared to SAKURA, a non-symplectic, non-time-reversible\nintegrator based on a different two-body decomposition of the $N$-body problem.\nThe integrator is a promising tool in collisional gravitational dynamics.\n", "  We investigate magnetization induced by mechanical rotation, known as the\nBarnett effect, in the two-dimensional electron gas. The energy eigenvalues of\nthe rotating system (Barnett levels) are non-degenerate, thereby differ from\nLandau levels in the presence of a magnetic field. The magnetic response caused\nby the coupling of the Barnett gauge field to both the electron spin and\norbital degree of freedom is found to be paramagnetic. Surprisingly, rotation\ndoes not cause any charge redistribution, i.e. in the two-dimensional electron\ngas centrifugal forces are quantum mechanically suppressed.\n", "  In this work, we extend the idea of Quantum Markov chains [S. Gudder. Quantum\nMarkov chains. J. Math. Phys., 49(7), 2008] in order to propose Quantum Hidden\nMarkov Models (QHMMs). For that, we use the notions of Transition Operation\nMatrices (TOM) and Vector States, which are an extension of classical\nstochastic matrices and probability distributions. Our main result is the Mealy\nQHMM formulation and proofs of algorithms needed for application of this model:\nForward for general case and Vitterbi for a restricted class of QHMMs.\n", "  If one examines two-body matrix elements from experiment one notices that not\nonly J=0 T=1 lies low but also J=1T=0 and J=J_{max} =2j T=0. It is sometimes\nthought that one needs both T=1 and T=0 two-body matrix elements to get equally\nspaced spectra of even I states i.e. vibraitonal spectra. We here attempt to\nget equally spaced levels with only those that have T=1 (even J).As an example\nwe perform single-j calculations (f_{7/2}) in ^{44} T and ^{46} Ti. We then\nshift gears and decide to play around with the input two particle matrix,\nelements (not worrying about experiment) to generate interesting spectra e.g.\nrotaional spectra with and then without T=0 two-body matrix element. Of special\ninterest is a new partial dynamical symmetry found when the \"123\", the \"1234\"\netc.,interactions are used.\n", "  The Fock-Hilbert space generated by a single-particle interaction-free\nWightman field is augmented by introducing non-trivial multi-particle (that is,\nmulti-point, multilinear) quantum fields, which is justified insofar as Haag's\ntheorem establishes that free field Fock-Hilbert spaces cannot model bound or\ninteracting states. Two Gaussian constructions are given: one that modifies the\ncombinatoric factors and masses associated with products of propagators and a\nsecond for which locality is determined by the center of mass of the\nn-particles and relative separations of the n-particles determine the strength\nof resonance; it is shown how the two constructions may also be used together.\nFinally, a method is given for generating non-Gaussian n-particle quantum\nfields that quite closely tracks familiar interacting quantum fields but that\nis significantly better-defined and that offers a much richer algebraic\nstructure for future use.\n", "  We derive and present a fast and accurate solution of the initial value\nproblem for Keplerian motion in universal variables that does not use the\nStumpff series. We find that it performs better than methods based on the\nStumpff series.\n", "  We study community structure in time-dependent legislation cosponsorship\nnetworks in the Peruvian Congress, and we compare them briefly to legislation\ncosponsorship networks in the US Senate. To study these legislatures, we employ\na multilayer representation of temporal networks in which legislators in each\nlayer are connected to each other with a weight that is based on how many bills\nthey cosponsor. We then use multilayer modularity maximization to detect\ncommunities in these networks. From our computations, we are able to capture\npower shifts in the Peruvian Congress during 2006--2011. For example, we\nobserve the emergence of 'opportunists', who switch from one community to\nanother, as well as cohesive legislative communities whose initial component\nlegislators never change communities. Interestingly, many of the opportunists\nbelong to the group that won the majority in Congress.\n", "  Shor's factoring algorithm (SFA), by its ability to efficiently factor large\nnumbers, has the potential to undermine contemporary encryption. At its heart\nis a process called order finding, which quantum mechanics lets us perform\nefficiently. SFA thus consists of a \\emph{quantum order finding algorithm}\n(QOFA), bookended by classical routines which, given the order, return the\nfactors. But, with probability up to $1/2$, these classical routines fail, and\nQOFA must be rerun. We modify these routines using elementary results in number\ntheory, improving the likelihood that they return the factors.\n  The resulting quantum factoring algorithm is better than SFA at factoring\nsafe semiprimes, an important class of numbers used in cryptography. With just\none call to QOFA, our algorithm almost always factors safe semiprimes. As well\nas a speed-up, improving efficiency gives our algorithm other, practical\nadvantages: unlike SFA, it does not need a randomly picked input, making it\nsimpler to construct in the lab; and in the (unlikely) case of failure, the\nsame circuit can be rerun, without modification.\n  We consider generalizing this result to other cases, although we do not find\na simple extension, and conclude that SFA is still the best algorithm for\ngeneral numbers (non safe semiprimes, in other words). Even so, we present some\nsimple number theoretic tricks for improving SFA in this case.\n", "  We apply one of the exactly symplectic integrators, that we call HB15, of\n\\cite{HB15}, along with the Kepler problem solver of \\cite{WH15}, to solve\nplanetary system $N$-body problems. We compare the method to Wisdom-Holman\nmethods (WH) in the \\texttt{MERCURY} software package, the \\texttt{MERCURY}\nswitching integrator, and others and find HB15 to be the most efficient method\nor tied for the most efficient method in many cases. Unlike WH, HB15 solved\n$N$-body problems exhibiting close encounters with small, acceptable error,\nalthough frequent encounters slowed the code. Switching maps like\n\\texttt{MERCURY} change between two methods and are not exactly symplectic. We\ncarry out careful tests on their properties and suggest they must be used with\ncaution. We then use different integrators to solve a 3-body problem consisting\nof a binary planet orbiting a star. For all tested tolerances and time steps,\n\\texttt{MERCURY} unbinds the binary after 0 to 25 years. However, in the\nsolutions of HB15, a time-symmetric Hermite code, and a symplectic Yoshida\nmethod, the binary remains bound for $>1000$ years. The methods' solutions are\nqualitatively different, despite small errors in the first integrals in most\ncases. Several checks suggest the qualitative binary behavior of HB15's\nsolution is correct. The Bulirsch-Stoer and Radau methods in the\n\\texttt{MERCURY} package also unbind the binary before a time of 50 years,\nsuggesting this dynamical error is due to a \\texttt{MERCURY} bug.\n", "  We recalculate the branching ratio and CP asymmetry for $\\bar{B}^{0}\n(B^{0})\\to \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$ decays in the Perturbative QCD approach. In this\napproach, we consider all the possible diagrams including non-factorizable\ncontributions and annihilation contributions. We obtain $Br(\\bar{B}^{0}\n(B^{0})\\to \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0})=(1.17_{-0.12}^{+0.11})\\times 10^{-6}$. Our result is\nin agreement with the latest measured branching ratio of\n$B^{0}\\to\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$ by the Belle and HFAG Collaborations. We also predict\nlarge direct CP asymmetry and mixing CP asymmetry in $B^{0}\\to\\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$\ndecays, which can be tested by the coming Belle-II experiments.\n", "  The spectral properties for the bilayer quantum Heisenberg model were\ninvestigated with the numerical diagonalization method. In the ordered phase,\nthere appears the massive Higgs excitation embedded in the continuum of the\nGoldstone excitations. Recently, it was claimed that the properly scaled Higgs\nmass is a universal constant in proximity to the critical point. Diagonalizing\nthe finite-size cluster with $N \\le 36$ spins, we calculated the dynamical\nscalar susceptibility $\\chi_s\"(\\omega)$, which is rather insensitive to the\nGoldstone mode. A finite-size-scaling analysis of $\\chi_s \"(\\omega)$ is made,\nand the universal (properly scaled) Higgs mass is estimated.\n", "  In interferometers, the more information about the quanta's path available in\nan ancillary quantum system (AQS), the less visibility the interference has. By\nuse of Shannon entropy, we try to compare the amount of which-phase information\nwith the amount of which-way information stored in the AQS of two-path\ninterferometers with symmetric beam merging. We show that the former is lower\nthan or equal the latter if the bipartite system of the single-quanta and the\nAQS is initially prepared in a pure state and the interaction between the two\nparts is unitary. Especially when there exists symmetry, the equality holds. No\nwhich-way information is obtained by the measurement that we use for extracting\nthe which-phase information and vice versa. In order to verify the results\nexperimentally, we propose assembling a new single-photon interferometer.\n", "  The dense packing of interacting particles on spheres has proved to be a\nuseful model for virus capsids and colloidosomes. Indeed, icosahedral symmetry\nobserved in virus capsids corresponds to potential energy minima that occur for\nmagic numbers of, e.g., 12, 32 and 72 identical Lennard-Jones particles, for\nwhich the packing has exactly the minimum number of twelve five-fold defects.\nIt is unclear, however, how stable these structures are against thermal\nagitation. We investigate this property by means of basin-hopping global\noptimisation and Langevin dynamics for particle numbers between ten and one\nhundred. An important measure is the number and type of point defects, that is,\nparticles that do not have six nearest neighbours. We find that small\nicosahedral structures are the most robust against thermal fluctuations,\nexhibiting fewer excess defects and rearrangements for a wide temperature\nrange. Furthermore, we provide evidence that excess defects appearing at low\nnon-zero temperatures lower the potential energy at the expense of entropy. At\nhigher temperatures defects are, as expected, thermally excited and thus\nentropically stabilised. If we replace the Lennard-Jones potential by a very\nshort-ranged (Morse) potential, which is arguably more appropriate for colloids\nand virus capsid proteins, we find that the same particle numbers give a\nminimum in the potential energy, although for larger particle numbers these\nminima correspond to different packings. Furthermore, defects are more\ndifficult to excite thermally for the short-ranged potential, suggesting that\nthe short-ranged interaction further stabilises equilibrium structures.\n", "  We study the solutions of a generalized Allen-Cahn equation deduced from a\nLandau energy functional, endowed with a non-constant higher order stiffness.\nWe analytically solve the stationary problem and deduce the existence of\nso-called compactons, namely, connections on a finite interval between the two\nphases. The dynamics problem is numerically solved and compacton formation is\ndescribed.\n", "  Fundamental diagrams describing the relation between pedestrians speed and\ndensity are key points in understanding pedestrian dynamics. Experimental data\nevidence the onset of complex behaviors in which the velocity decreases with\nthe density and different logistic regimes are identified. This paper addresses\nthe issue of pedestrians transport and of fundamental diagrams for a scenario\ninvolving the motion of pedestrians escaping from an obscure tunnel. We capture\nthe effects of the communication efficiency and the exit capacity by means of\ntwo thresholds controlling the rate at which particles (walkers, pedestrians)\nmove on the lattice. Using a particle system model, we show that in absence of\nlimitation in communication among pedestrians we reproduce with good accuracy\nthe standard fundamental diagrams, whose basic behaviors can be interpreted in\nterms of the exit capacity limitation. When the effect of a limited\ncommunication ability is considered, then interesting non-intuitive phenomena\noccur. Particularly, we shed light on the loss of monotonicity of the typical\nspeed--density curves, revealing the existence of a pedestrians density\noptimizing the escape.\n  We study both the discrete particle dynamics as well as the corresponding\nhydrodynamic limit (a porous medium equation and a transport (continuity)\nequation). We also point out the dependence of the effective transport\ncoefficients on the two thresholds - the essence of the microstructure\ninformation.\n", "  Analytical expressions for the axial and transverse acoustic radiation forces\nas well as the radiation torque per length are derived for a rigid elliptical\ncylinder placed arbitrarily in the field of in plane progressive,\nquasi-standing or standing waves. The rigid elliptical cylinder case is\nimportant to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a\nfluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance\nmismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion\nmethod in cylindrical coordinates, non-dimensional acoustic radiation force and\ntorque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering\ncoefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is\nobtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface\nin a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after\nperforming a single numerical integration procedure. Computational results for\nthe non-dimensional force components and torque, showing the transition from\nthe progressive to the (equi-amplitude) standing wave behavior, are performed\nwith particular emphasis on the aspect ratio a/b, where a and b are the\nsemi-axes of the ellipse, the dimensionless size parameter, as well as the\nangle of incidence ranging from end-on to broadside incidence. The results show\nthat the elliptical geometry has a direct influence on the radiation force and\ntorque, so that the standard theory for circular cylinders (at normal\nincidence) leads to significant miscalculations when the cylinder cross-section\nbecomes non-circular. Moreover, the elliptical cylinder experiences, in\naddition to the acoustic radiation force, a radiation torque that vanishes for\nthe circular cylinder case. The application of the formalism presented here may\nbe extended to other 2D surfaces of arbitrary shape.\n", "  We show that the anomalous diffusion equations with a fractional derivative\nin the Caputo or Riesz sense are strictly related to the special convolution\nproperties of the L\\'evy stable distributions which stem from the evolution\nproperties of stretched or compressed exponential function. The formal\nsolutions of these fractional differential equations are found by using the\nevolution operator method where the evolution operator is presented as integral\ntransforms whose kernel is the Green function. Exact and explicit examples of\nthe solutions are reported and studied for various fractional order of\nderivatives and different initial conditions.\n", "  We formulate a general microscopic approach to spin-orbit torques in thin\nferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayers in linear response to electric current or\nelectric field. The microscopic theory we develop avoids the notion of spin\ncurrents and spin-Hall effect. Instead, the torques are directly related to a\nlocal spin polarization of conduction electrons, which is computed from\ngeneralized Kubo-St\\v{r}eda formulas. A symmetry analysis provides a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between polarization susceptibility tensor components and\ndifferent torque terms in the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for\nmagnetization dynamics. The spin-orbit torques arising from Rashba or\nDresselhaus type of spin-orbit interaction are shown to have different\nsymmetries. We analyze these spin-orbit torques microscopically for a generic\nelectron model in the presence of an arbitrary smooth magnetic texture. For a\nmodel with spin-independent disorder we find a major cancelation of the\ntorques. In this case the only remaining torque corresponds to the\nmagnetization-independent Edelstein effect. Furthermore, our results are\napplied to analyze the dynamics of a Skyrmion under the action of electric\ncurrent.\n", "  Pulsar timing arrays are one of the powerful tools to test the existence of\ncosmic strings through searching for the gravitational wave background. The\namplitude of the background connects to information on cosmic strings such as\nthe tension and string network properties. In addition, one may be able to\nextract more information on properties of cosmic strings by measuring\nanisotropies in the gravitational wave (GW) background. In this paper, we\nprovide estimates of the level of anisotropy expected in the GW background\ngenerated by cusps on cosmic strings. We find that the anisotropy level\nstrongly depends on the initial loop size $\\alpha$, and thus we may be able to\nput constraint on $\\alpha$ by measuring the anisotropy of the GW background. We\nalso find that certain regions of the parameter space can be probed by shifting\nthe observation frequency of GWs.\n", "  Consider the Allen-Cahn equation on the $d$-dimensional torus, $d=2,3$, in\nthe sharp interface limit. As it is well known, the limiting dynamics is\ndescribed by the motion by mean curvature of the interface between the two\nstable phases. Here, we analyze a stochastic perturbation of the Allen-Cahn\nequation and describe its large deviation asymptotics in a joint sharp\ninterface and small noise limit. Relying on previous results on the variational\nconvergence of the action functional, we prove the large deviation upper bound.\nThe corresponding rate function is finite only when there exists a time\nevolving interface of codimension one between the two stable phases. The zero\nlevel set of this rate function is given by the evolution by mean curvature in\nthe sense of Brakke. Finally, the rate function can be written in terms of the\nsum of two non-negative quantities: the first measures how much the velocity of\nthe interface deviates from its mean curvature, while the second is due to the\npossible occurrence of nucleation events.\n", "  In the next few years Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) may see gravitational waves (GWs)\nfrom thousands of black hole (BH) mergers. This marks the beginning of a new\nprecision tool for physics. Here we show how to search for new physics beyond\nthe standard model using this tool, in particular the QCD axion in the mass\nrange ma ~ 10^-14 to 10^-10 eV. Axions (or any bosons) in this mass range cause\nrapidly rotating BHs to shed their spin into a large cloud of axions in atomic\nBohr orbits around the BH, through the effect of superradiance (SR). This\nresults in a gap in the mass vs. spin distribution of BHs when the BH size is\ncomparable to the axion's Compton wavelength. By measuring the spin and mass of\nthe merging objects observed at LIGO, we could verify the presence and shape of\nthe gap in the BH distribution produced by the axion.\n  The axion cloud can also be discovered through the GWs it radiates via axion\nannihilations or level transitions. A blind monochromatic GW search may reveal\nup to 10^5 BHs radiating through axion annihilations, at distinct frequencies\nwithin ~3% of $2 ma. Axion transitions probe heavier axions and may be\nobservable in future GW observatories. The merger events are perfect candidates\nfor a targeted GW search. If the final BH has high spin, a SR cloud may grow\nand emit monochromatic GWs from axion annihilations. We may observe the SR\nevolution in real time.\n", "  Non-unitary neutrino mixing implies an extra CP violating phase that can fake\nthe leptonic Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{CP}$ of the simplest three-neutrino mixing\nbenchmark scheme. This would hinder the possibility of probing for CP violation\nin accelerator-type experiments. We take T2K and T2HK as examples to\ndemonstrate the degeneracy between the \"standard\" (or \"unitary\") and\n\"non-unitary\" CP phases. We find, under the assumption of non-unitary mixing,\nthat their CP sensitivities severely deteriorate. Fortunately, the TNT2K\nproposal of supplementing T2(H)K with a $\\mu$DAR source for better measurement\nof $\\delta_{CP}$ can partially break the CP degeneracy by probing both $\\cos\n\\delta_{CP}$ and $\\sin \\delta_{CP}$ dependences in the wide spectrum of the\n$\\mu$DAR flux. We also show that the further addition of a near detector to the\n$\\mu$DAR setup can eliminate the degeneracy completely.\n", "  An absorptive Rayleigh dielectric sphere in a non-diffracting non-paraxial\nfractional Bessel vortex beam experiences a spin torque. The axial and\ntransverse radiation spin torque components are evaluated in the dipole\napproximation using the radiative correction of the electric field. Particular\nemphasis is given on the polarization as well as changing the topological\ncharge and the beam's half-cone angle. When the beam order is zero, the axial\nspin torque component vanishes. However, when the beam order becomes a real\npositive number, the vortex beam induces left-handed (negative) axial spin\ntorque as the sphere shifts off-axially from the center of the beam. The\nresults show that a non-diffracting non-paraxial fractional Bessel vortex beam\nis capable to induce a spin reversal of an absorptive Rayleigh sphere placed\narbitrarily in its path. Potential applications are yet to be explored in\nparticle manipulation, rotation in optical tweezers, optical tractor beams, the\ndesign of optically-engineered metamaterials to name a few areas.\n", "  A necessary condition for the validity of the linear viscoelastic model for a\n(passive) polymeric cylinder with an ultrasonic hysteresis-type absorption\nsubmerged in a non-viscous fluid requires that the absorption efficiency is\npositive (Qabs > 0) satisfying the law of the conservation of energy. This\ncondition imposes restrictions on the values attributed to the normalized\nabsorption coefficients for the compressional and shear-wave wavenumbers for\neach partial-wave mode n. The forbidden values produce negative axial radiation\nforce, absorption and extinction efficiencies, as well as an enhancement of the\nscattering efficiency, not in agreement with the conservation of energy law.\nNumerical results for the radiation force, extinction, absorption and\nscattering efficiencies are performed for three viscoelastic (VE) polymer\ncylinders immersed in a non-viscous host liquid (i.e. water) with particular\nemphasis on the shear-wave absorption coefficient of the cylinder, the\ndimensionless size parameter and the partial-wave mode number n. Mathematical\nconstraints are established for the non-dimensional absorption coefficients of\nthe longitudinal and shear waves for a cylinder (i.e. 2D case) and a sphere\n(i.e. 3D case) in terms of the sound velocities in the VE material. The\nanalysis suggests that the domain of validity for any viscoelastic model\ndescribing acoustic attenuation inside a lossy cylinder (or sphere) in a\nnon-viscous fluid must be verified based upon the optical theorem.\n", "  Coherent X-ray diffraction imaging (CXDI) experiments are intrinsically\nlimited by shot noise, a lack of prior knowledge about the sample's support,\nand missing measurements due to the experimental geometry. We propose a\nflexible, iterative phase retrieval framework that allows for accurate modeling\nof Gaussian or Poissonian noise statistics, modified support updates,\nregularization of reconstructed signals, and handling of missing data in the\nobservations. The proposed method is efficiently solved using alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) and is demonstrated to consistently\noutperform state-of-the-art algorithms for low-photon phase retrieval from CXDI\nexperiments, both for simulated diffraction patterns and for experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  In this paper we explore the possibility that the sterile neutrino and Dark\nMatter sectors in the Universe have a common origin. We study the consequences\nof this assumption in the simple case of coupling the dark sector to the\nStandard Model via a global $U(1)_{B-L}$, broken down spontaneously by a dark\nscalar. This dark scalar provides masses to the dark fermions and communicates\nwith the Higgs via a Higgs portal coupling. We find an interesting interplay\nbetween Dark Matter annihilation to dark scalars - the CP-even that mixes with\nthe Higgs and the CP-odd which becomes a Goldstone boson, the Majoron - and\nheavy neutrinos, as well as collider probes via the coupling to the Higgs.\nMoreover, Dark Matter annihilation into sterile neutrinos and its subsequent\ndecay to gauge bosons and quarks, charged leptons or neutrinos lead to indirect\ndetection signatures which are close to current bounds on the gamma ray flux\nfrom the galactic center and dwarf galaxies.\n", "  We establish a mathematically rigorous, general and quantitative framework to\ndescribe currents of non- (or weakly) interacting, indistinguishable particles\ndriven far from equilibrium. We derive tight upper and lower bounds for the\nachievable fermionic and bosonic steady state current, respectively, which can\nserve as benchmarks for special cases of interacting many-particle dynamics.\nFor fermionic currents, we identify a symmetry-induced enhancement mechanism in\nparameter regimes where the coupling between system and reservoirs is weak.\nThis mechanism is broadly applicable provided the inter-particle interaction\nstrength is small as compared to typical exchange interactions.\n", "  A solar cell is a heat engine, but textbook treatments are not wholly\nsatisfactory from a thermodynamic standpoint, since they present solar cells as\ndirectly converting the energy of light into electricity, and the current in\nthe circuit as maintained by an electrostatic potential. We propose a\nthermodynamic cycle in which the gas of electrons in the p phase serves as the\nworking substance. The interface between the p and n phases acts as a\nself-oscillating piston that modulates the absorption of heat from the photons\nso that it may perform a net positive work during a complete cycle of its\nmotion, in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. We draw a simple\nhydrodynamical analogy between this model and the \"putt-putt\"' engine of toy\nboats, in which the interface between the water's liquid and gas phases serves\nas the piston. We point out some testable consequences of this model.\n", "  Rastall's theory belongs to the class of non-conservative theories of\ngravity. In vacuum, the only non-trivial static, spherically symmetric solution\nis the Schwarzschild one, except in a very special case. When a canonical\nscalar field is coupled to the gravity sector in this theory, new exact\nsolutions appear for some values of the Rastall parameter $a$. Some of these\nsolutions describe the same space-time geometry as the recently found solutions\nin the $k$-essence theory with a power function for the kinetic term of the\nscalar field. There is a large class of solutions (in particular, those\ndescribing wormholes and regular black holes) whose geometry coincides with\nthat of solutions of GR coupled to scalar fields with nontrivial\nself-interaction potentials; the form of these potentials, however, depends on\nthe Rastall parameter $a$. We also note that all solutions of GR with a zero\ntrace of the energy-momentum tensor, including black-hole and wormhole ones,\nmay be re-interpreted as solutions of Rastall's theory.\n", "  The analysis using the partial-wave series expansion (PWSE) method in\nspherical coordinates is extended to evaluate the acoustic radiation force\nexperienced by rigid oblate and prolate spheroids centered on the axis of wave\npropagation of high-order Bessel vortex beams composed of progressive, standing\nand quasi-standing waves, respectively. A coupled system of linear equations is\nderived after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface\nin a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after\nperforming a single numerical integration procedure. The system of linear\nequations depends on the partial-wave index n and the order of the Bessel\nvortex beam m using truncated but converging PWSEs in the least-squares sense.\nNumerical results for the radiation force function, which is the radiation\nforce per unit energy density and unit cross-sectional surface, are computed\nwith particular emphasis on the amplitude ratio describing the transition from\nthe progressive to the pure standing waves cases, the aspect ratio (i.e., the\nratio of the major axis over the minor axis of the spheroid), the half-cone\nangle and order of the Bessel vortex beam, as well as the dimensionless size\nparameter. A generalized expression for the radiation force function is derived\nfor cases encompassing the progressive, standing and quasi-standing waves of\nBessel vortex beams. This expression can be reduced to other types of\nbeams/waves such as the zeroth-order Bessel non-vortex beam or the infinite\nplane wave case by appropriate selection of the beam parameters. The results\nfor progressive waves reveal a tractor beam behavior, characterized by the\nemergence of an attractive pulling force acting in opposite direction of wave\npropagation. Moreover, the transition to the quasi-standing and pure standing\nwave cases shows the acoustical tweezers behavior in dual-beam Bessel vortex\nbeams.\n", "  We compute the finite temperature ghost and gluon propagators of Yang-Mills\ntheory in the Landau-DeWitt gauge. The background field that enters the\ndefinition of the latter is intimately related with the (gauge-invariant)\nPolyakov loop and serves as an equivalent order parameter for the deconfinement\ntransition. We use an effective gauge-fixed description where the\nnonperturbative infrared dynamics of the theory is parametrized by a gluon mass\nwhich, as argued elsewhere, may originate from the Gribov ambiguity. In this\nscheme, one can perform consistent perturbative calculations down to infrared\nmomenta, which have been shown to correctly describe the phase diagram of\nYang-Mills theories in four dimensions as well as the zero-temperature\ncorrelators computed in lattice simulations. In this article, we provide the\none-loop expressions of the finite temperature Landau-DeWitt ghost and gluon\npropagators for a large class of gauge groups and present explicit results for\nthe SU(2) case. These are substantially different from those previously\nobtained in the Landau gauge, which corresponds to a vanishing background\nfield. The nonanalyticity of the order parameter across the transition is\ndirectly imprinted onto the propagators in the various color modes. In the\nSU(2) case, this leads, for instance, to a cusp in the electric and magnetic\ngluon susceptibilities as well as similar signatures in the ghost sector. We\nmention the possibility that such distinctive features of the transition could\nbe measured in lattice simulations in the background field gauge studied here.\n", "  Renewable energy researchers use computer simulation to aid the design of\nlithium ion storage devices. The underlying models contain several physical\ninput parameters that affect model predictions. Effective design and analysis\nmust understand the sensitivity of model predictions to changes in model\nparameters, but global sensitivity analyses become increasingly challenging as\nthe number of input parameters increases. Active subspaces are part of an\nemerging set of tools for discovering and exploiting low-dimensional structures\nin the map from high-dimensional inputs to model outputs. We extend linear and\nquadratic model-based heuristic for active sub- space discovery to\ntime-dependent processes and apply the resulting technique to a lithium ion\nbattery model. The results reveal low-dimensional structure and sensitivity\nmetrics that a designer may exploit to study the relationship between\nparameters and predictions.\n", "  Context. Several issues regarding the nature of dust at high redshift remain\nunresolved: its composition, its production and growth mechanisms, and its\neffect on background sources. Aims. We provide a more accurate relation between\ndust depletion levels and dust-to-metals ratio (DTM), and to use the DTM to\ninvestigate the origin and evolution of dust in the high-redshift Universe via\nGamma-ray burst damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (GRB-DLAs). Methods. We use\nabsorption-line measured metal column densities for a total of 19 GRB-DLAs,\nincluding five new GRB afterglow spectra from VLT/X-shooter. We use the latest\nlinear models to calculate the dust depletion strength factor in each DLA.\nUsing these values we calculate total dust and metal column densities to\ndetermine a DTM. We explore the evolution of DTM with metallicity, and compare\nit to previous trends in DTM measured with different methods. Results. We find\nsignificant dust depletion in 16 of our 19 GRB-DLAs, yet 18 of the 19 have a\nDTM significantly lower than the Milky Way. We find that DTM is positively\ncorrelated with metallicity, which supports a dominant ISM grain-growth mode of\ndust formation. We find a substantial discrepancy between the dust content\nmeasured from depletion and that derived from the total V-band extinction,\n$A_V$ , measured by fitting the afterglow SED. We advise against using a\nmeasurement from one method to estimate that from the other until the\ndiscrepancy can be resolved.\n", "  We consider the damped wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions on\nthe unit square. We assume the damping to be a characteristic function of a\nstrip. We prove the exact $t^{-4/3}$-decay rate for the energy of classical\nsolutions. This answers a question of Anantharaman and L\\'eautaud (2014).\n", "  We consider the asymptotic behaviour of the second discrete Painlev\\'{e}\nequation in the limit as the independent variable becomes large. Using\nasymptotic power series, we find solutions that are asymptotically pole-free\nwithin some region of the complex plane. These asymptotic solutions exhibit\nStokes phenomena, which is typically invisible to classical power series\nmethods. We subsequently apply exponential asymptotic techniques to investigate\nsuch phenomena, and obtain mathematical descriptions of the rapid switching\nbehaviour associated with Stokes curves. Through this analysis, we determine\nthe regions of the complex plane in which the asymptotic approximations are\nvalid, and find that the behaviour of these asymptotic solutions shares a\nnumber of features with the tronqu\\'{e}e and tri-tronqu\\'{e}e solutions of the\nsecond continuous Painlev\\'{e} equation.\n", "  Periodically-driven quantum systems can exhibit topologically non-trivial\nbehaviour, even when their quasi-energy bands have zero Chern numbers. Much\nwork has been conducted on non-interacting quantum-mechanical models where this\nkind of behaviour is present. However, the inclusion of interactions in\nout-of-equilibrium quantum systems can prove to be quite challenging. On the\nother hand, the classical counterpart of hard-core interactions can be\nsimulated efficiently via constrained random walks. The non-interacting model\nproposed by Rudner et al. [Phys. Rev. X 3, 031005 (2013)], has a special point\nfor which the system is equivalent to a classical random walk. We consider the\nclassical counterpart of this model, which is exact at a special point even\nwhen hard-core interactions are present, and show how these quantitatively\naffect the edge currents in a strip geometry. We find that the interacting\nclassical system is well described by a mean-field theory. Using this we\nsimulate the dynamics of the classical system, which show that the interactions\nplay the role of Markovian, or time dependent disorder. By comparing the\nevolution of classical and quantum edge currents in small lattices, we find\nregimes where the classical limit considered gives good insight into the\nquantum problem.\n", "  In the ordered phase for an Ising ferromagnet, the magnons are attractive to\nform a series of bound states with the mass gaps, $m_2<m_3 < \\dots$. Each ratio\n$m_{2,3,\\dots}/m_1$ ($m_1$: the single-magnon mass) is expected to be a\nuniversal constant in the vicinity of the critical point. In this paper, we\ndevote ourselves to the $(2+1)$-dimensional counterpart, for which the\nuniversal hierarchical character remains unclear. We employed the exact\ndiagonalization method, which enables us to calculate the dynamical\nsusceptibility via the continued-fraction expansion. Thereby, we observe a\nvariety of signals including $m_{2,3,4}$, and the spectrum is analyzed with the\nfinite-size-scaling method to estimate the universal mass-gap ratios.\n", "  Here, building on our previous work [Phys. Rev. B, 92, 125153, (2015)], it is\nshown that the propagation of unidirectional gapless edge states at an\ninterface of two topologically distinct electromagnetic continua with a\nwell-behaved asymptotic electromagnetic response is rigorously predicted by the\nbulk-edge correspondence principle. We work out detailed examples demonstrating\nthat when the spatial-cut off of the nonreciprocal part of the material\nresponse is considered self-consistently in the solution of the relevant\nelectromagnetic problem, the number of unidirectional gapless edge modes is\nidentical to the difference of the Chern numbers of the bulk materials.\nFurthermore, it is shown how the role of the spatial cut-off can be imitated in\nrealistic systems using a tiny air gap with a specific thickness. This theory\nprovides a practical roadmap for the application of topological concepts to\nphotonic platforms formed by nonreciprocal electromagnetic continua.\n", "  The existence of the classical black hole solutions of the\nEinstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs equations with non-abelian Yang-Mills-Higgs hair,\nwhich we will also refer to as \"magnetic monopole black hole solutions\",\nimplies that not all classical stationary magnetically charged black holes can\nbe uniquely described by their asymptotic characteristics. In fact, in a\ncertain domain of parameters, there exist different spherically-symmetric,\nnon-rotating and asymptotically-flat classical black hole solutions of the EYMH\nequations which have the same ADM mass and the same magnetic charge but\nsignificantly different geometries in the near-horizon regions. (These are\nblack hole solutions which are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om metric on\nthe one hand and the hairy magnetic monopole black hole solutions which are\ndescribed by a metric which is not of Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om form on the other\nhand.) One can experimentally distinguish such black holes with same asymptotic\ncharacteristics but different near-horizon geometries classically by probing\nthe near-horizon regions of the black holes. We argue that one way to probe the\nnear-horizon region of a black hole which allows to distinguish magnetically\ncharged black holes with same asymptotic characteristics but different\nnear-horizon geometries is by classical scattering of waves. Using the example\nof a minimally-coupled massless probe scalar field scattered by magnetically\ncharged black holes which can be obtained as solutions of the EYMH equations\nwith a Higgs triplett and gauge group SU(2) in the limit of an infinite Higgs\nself-coupling constant we show how, in this case, the scattering cross sections\ndiffer for the magnetically charged black holes with different near-horizon\ngeometries but same asymptotic characteristics. We find in particular that the\ncharacteristic glory peaks in the cross sections are located at different\nscattering angles.\n", "  If there are a plethora of axions in nature, they may have a complicated\npotential and create an axion landscape. We study a possibility that one of the\naxions is so light that it is cosmologically stable, explaining the observed\ndark matter density. In particular we focus on a case in which two (or more)\nshift-symmetry breaking terms conspire to make the axion sufficiently light at\nthe potential minimum. In this case the axion has a flat-bottomed potential. In\ncontrast to the case in which a single cosine term dominates the potential, the\naxion abundance as well as its isocurvature perturbations are significantly\nsuppressed. This allows an axion with a rather large mass to serve as dark\nmatter without fine-tuning of the initial misalignment, and further makes\nhigher-scale inflation to be consistent with the scenario.\n", "  We initiate the calculation of quantum corrections to Wilson loops in a class\nof four-dimensional defect conformal field theories with vacuum expectation\nvalues based on N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Concretely, we consider an\ninfinite straight Wilson line, obtaining explicit results for the one-loop\ncorrection to its expectation value in the large-N limit. This allows us to\nextract the particle-interface potential of the theory. In a further\ndouble-scaling limit, we compare our results to those of a previous calculation\nin the dual string-theory set-up consisting of a D5-D3 probe-brane system with\nflux, and we find perfect agreement.\n", "  We present a method for Monte Carlo sampling on systems with discrete\nvariables (focusing in the Ising case), introducing a prior on the candidate\nmoves in a Metropolis-Hastings scheme which can significantly reduce the\nrejection rate, called the reduced-rejection-rate (RRR) method. The method\nemploys same probability distribution for the choice of the moves as\nrejection-free schemes such as the method proposed by Bortz, Kalos and Lebowitz\n(BKL) [Bortz et al. J.Comput.Phys. 1975]; however, it uses it as a prior in an\notherwise standard Metropolis scheme: it is thus not fully rejection-free, but\nin a wide range of scenarios it is nearly so. This allows to extend the method\nto cases for which rejection-free schemes become inefficient, in particular\nwhen the graph connectivity is not sparse, but the energy can nevertheless be\nexpressed as a sum of two components, one of which is computed on a sparse\ngraph and dominates the measure. As examples of such instances, we demonstrate\nthat the method yields excellent results when performing Monte Carlo\nsimulations of quantum spin models in presence of a transverse field in the\nSuzuki-Trotter formalism, and when exploring the so-called robust ensemble\nwhich was recently introduced in Baldassi et al. [PNAS 2016]. Our code for the\nIsing case is publicly available [https://github.com/carlobaldassi/RRRMC.jl],\nand extensible to user-defined models: it provides efficient implementations of\nstandard Metropolis, the RRR method, the BKL method (extended to the case of\ncontinuous energy specra), and the waiting time method [Dall and Sibani\nComput.Phys.Commun. 2001].\n", "  Using a femtosecond laser writing technique, we fabricate and characterise\nthree-waveguide digital adiabatic passage devices, with the central waveguide\ndigitised into five discrete waveguidelets. Strongly asymmetric behaviour was\nobserved, devices operated with high fidelity in the counter-intuitive scheme\nwhile strongly suppressing transmission in the intuitive. The low differential\nloss of the digital adiabatic passage designs potentially offers additional\nfunctionality for adiabatic passage based devices. These devices operate with a\nhigh contrast ($>\\!90\\%$) over a 60nm bandwidth, centered at $\\sim 823$nm.\n", "  Controlling the temperature in architectures involving nanoparticles and\nsubstrates is a key issue for applications involving micro and nanoscale heat\ntransfer. We study the thermal behavior of a single nanoparticle interacting\nwith a flat substrate under external monochromatic illumination, and with\nthermal radiation as the unique heat loss channel. We develop a model to\ncompute the temperature of the nanoparticle, based on an effective\ndipole-polarizability approach. Using numerical simulations, we thoroughly\ninvestigate the impacts of various parameters affecting the nanoparticle\ntemperature, such as the nanoparticle-to-substrate gap distance, the incident\nlight wavelength and polarization, or the material resonances. This study\nprovides a tool for the thermal characterization and design of micro or\nnanoscale systems coupling substrates with nanoparticles or optical antennas.\n", "  In the present paper II, we will gain an understanding of the nematicity,\ninsulating ground state (IGS), nematicity to stripe phase transition, Fermi\npockets evolution, and resistivity temperature upturn, as to be metal -\ninsulator (fermion-boson)- crossover (MIC) phenomena for the pseudogap (PG)\nregion of cuprates. While in the paper I [1], we obtained an understanding of\nthe observed heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio, insulator\nresistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy as manifestations of the same MIC. The\nrecently observed nematicity and hidden magnetic order are related to the PG\npair intra charge and spin fluctuations. We will try to obtain an answer on the\nquestion: why ground state of YBCO is Fermi liquid oscillating and of Bi-2212\nis insulating? We will also clarify the physics of the recently observed MIC\nresults of Lalibert\\'e et al. [2] and explain the long-discussed transition of\nthe electric charge density from doping to doping+1 dependence at the critical\ndoping. We predict that at the upturns this density should have the temperature\ndependence $n\\sim T^3n_2$ for $T\\rightarrow 0$, where $n_2$ is density for\ndopings close to the critical value. We understood that the upturns before and\nafter the first critical doping have the same nature. We will find\nunderstanding of all above mentioned phenomena within the PG pair physics.\n", "  We develop the theory of heat conductivity in supported graphene, accounting\nfor coherent phonon scattering on disorder induced by an amorphous substrate.\nWe derive spectra for in-plane and out-of-plane phonons in the framework of\nGreen's function approach. The energetic parameters of the theory are obtained\nusing the molecular dynamics simulations for graphene on SiO$_2$ substrate. The\nheat conductivity is calculated by the Boltzmann transport equation. We find\nthat the interaction with the substrate drastically reduces the phonon lifetime\nand completely suppresses the contribution of ZA phonons to the heat\nconductivity. As a result, the total heat conductivity is reduced by several\ntimes, which matches with the tendency observed for available experimental\ndata. The considered effect is important for managing thermal properties of the\ngraphene-based electronic devices.\n", "  Configuration transitions of individual molecules and atoms on surfaces are\ntraditionally described with energy barriers and attempt rates using an\nArrhenius law. This approach yields consistent energy barrier values, but also\nattempt rates orders of magnitude below expected oscillation frequencies of\nparticles in the meta-stable state. Moreover, even for identical systems, the\nmeasurements can yield values differing from each other by orders of magnitude.\nUsing low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to measure an\nindividual dibutyl-sulfide molecule (DBS) on Au(111), we show that we can avoid\nthese apparent inconsistencies if we account for the relative position of tip\napex and molecule with accuracy of a fraction of the molecule size. Altering\nthe tip position on that scale modifies the transition's barrier and attempt\nrate in a highly correlated fashion, which on account of the relation between\nthe latter and entropy results in a single-molecular enthalpy-entropy\ncompensation. By appropriately positioning the tip apex the STM tip can be used\nto select the operating point on the compensation line and modify the\ntransition rates. The results highlight the need to consider entropy in\ntransition rates of a single molecule, even at temperatures where entropy\neffects are usually neglected.\n", "  The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a key site of pathogenesis for many\nretina diseases. The formation of drusen in the retina is characteristic of\nretinal degeneration. We investigate morphological changes in the RPE in the\npresence of soft drusen using an integrated experimental and modeling approach.\nWe collect RPE flat mount images from donated human eyes and develop 1)\nstatistical tools to quantify the images and 2) a cell-based model to simulate\nthe morphology evolution. We compare three different mechanisms of RPE repair\nevolution, cell apoptosis, cell fusion, and expansion, and Simulations of our\nRPE morphogenesis model quantitatively reproduce deformations of human RPE\nmorphology due to drusen, suggesting that a purse-string mechanism is\nsufficient to explain how RPE heals cell loss caused by drusen-damage. We found\nthat drusen beneath tissue promote cell death in a number that far exceeds the\ncell numbers covering the drusen. Tissue deformations are studied using area\ndistributions, Voronoi domains and a texture tensor.\n", "  We study experimentally the possibility to utilize pulses of pure spin\ncurrent, produced via the nonlocal spin injection mechanism, to generate short\npackets of spin waves propagating in nanoscale magnetic waveguides. The\nspatially and time-resolved micro-focus Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy\nmeasurements demonstrate that the excitation by spin current results in\nextremely fast transient response, enabling efficient generation of short\nspin-wave packets with duration down to a few nanoseconds. The proposed method\nopens a route for the implementation of high-speed magnonic systems for\ntransmission and processing of information on the nanoscale.\n", "  Recent advances in the studies of pure spin currents - flows of angular\nmomentum (spin) not accompanied by the electric currents - have opened new\nhorizons for the emerging technologies based on the electron's spin degree of\nfreedom, such as spintronics and magnonics. The main advantage of pure spin\ncurrent, as compared to the spin-polarized electric current, is the possibility\nto exert spin transfer torque on the magnetization in thin magnetic films\nwithout electrical current flow through the material. In addition to minimizing\nJoule heating and electromigration effects, this characteristic enables the\nimplementation of spin torque devices based on the low-loss insulating magnetic\nmaterials, and offers an unprecedented geometric flexibility. Here we review\nthe recent experimental achievements in investigations of magnetization\noscillations excited by pure spin currents in different magnetic nanosystems\nbased on metallic and insulating magnetic materials. We discuss the spectral\nproperties of spin-current nano-oscillators, and relate them to the spatial\ncharacteristics of the excited dynamic magnetic modes determined by the\nspatially-resolved measurements. We also show that these systems support\nlocking of the oscillations to external microwave signals, as well as their\nmutual synchronization, and can be used as efficient nanoscale sources of\npropagating spin waves.\n", "  Analytical expressions for the transition probability and the energy spectrum\nof the 1D Schr\\\"odinger equation with position dependent mass are presented for\nthe triangular quantum barrier and quantum well. The transmission coefficient\nis obtained by using the wave functions written in terms of the Airy's\nfunctions and of the solutions of the Kummer's differential equation. In order\nto show the validity of our analyze, an example by taking some numerical values\nfor GaAs heterostructure is presented.\n", "  We show the temperature dependence such as smoothness and monotone\ndecreasingness with respect to the temperature of the solution to the\nBCS-Bogoliubov gap equation for superconductivity. Here the temperature belongs\nto the closed interval $[0,\\, \\tau]$ with $\\tau>0$ nearly equal to half of the\ntransition temperature. We show that the solution is continuous with respect to\nboth the temperature and the energy, and that the solution is Lipschitz\ncontinuous and monotone decreasing with respect to the temperature. Moreover,\nwe show that the solution is partially differentiable with respect to the\ntemperature twice and the second-order partial derivative is continuous with\nrespect to both the temperature and the energy, or that the solution is\napproximated by such a smooth function.\n", "  In real networks, the dependency between nodes is ubiquitous; however, the\ndependency is not always complete and homogeneous. In this paper, we propose a\npercolation model with weak and heterogeneous dependency; i.e., dependency\nstrengths could be different between different nodes. We find that the\nheterogeneous dependency strength will make the system more robust, and for\nvarious distributions of dependency strengths both continuous and discontinuous\npercolation transitions can be found. For Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi networks, we\nprove that the crossing point of the continuous and discontinuous percolation\ntransitions is dependent on the first five moments of the dependency strength\ndistribution. This indicates that the discontinuous percolation transition on\nnetworks with dependency is determined not only by the dependency strength but\nalso by its distribution. Furthermore, in the area of the continuous\npercolation transition, we also find that the critical point depends on the\nfirst and second moments of the dependency strength distribution. To validate\nthe theoretical analysis, cases with two different dependency strengths and\nGaussian distribution of dependency strengths are presented as examples.\n", "  We study analytically and experimentally certain symplectic and\ntime-reversible N-body integrators which employ a Kepler solver for each\npair-wise interaction, including the method of Hernandez & Bertschinger (2015).\nOwing to the Kepler solver, these methods treat close two-body interactions\ncorrectly, while close three-body encounters contribute to the truncation error\nat second order and above. The second-order errors can be corrected to obtain a\nfourth-order scheme with little computational overhead. We generalise this map\nto an integrator which employs a Kepler solver only for selected interactions\nand yet retains fourth-order accuracy without backward steps. In this case,\nhowever, two-body encounters not treated via a Kepler solver contribute to the\ntruncation error.\n", "  In time-reversal invariant electronic systems the scattering matrix is\nanti-symmetric. This property enables an effect, designated here as \"scattering\nanomaly\", such that the electron transport does not suffer from back\nreflections, independent of the specific geometry of the propagation path or\nthe presence of time-reversal invariant defects. In contrast, for a generic\ntime-reversal invariant photonic system the scattering matrix is symmetric and\nthere is no similar anomaly. Here, it is theoretically proven that despite\nthese fundamental differences there is a wide class of photonic platforms - in\nsome cases formed only by time-reversal invariant media - in which a scattering\nanomaly can occur. It is shown that an optical system invariant under the\naction of the composition of the parity, time-reversal, and duality operators\n(PTD) is characterized by an anti-symmetric scattering matrix. Specific\nexamples of photonic platforms wherein the scattering anomaly occurs are given,\nand it is demonstrated with full wave numerical simulations that the proposed\nsystems enable bidirectional waveguiding immune to arbitrary deformations of\nthe propagation path. Importantly, our theory unveils a new class of fully\nthree dimensional structures wherein the transport of light is fully protected\nagainst reflections and uncovers unsuspected links between the electrodynamics\nof reciprocal and nonreciprocal materials.\n", "  We use the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo to revisit the enthalpy-pressure\nphase diagram of the various products from the different proposed\ndecompositions of H$_2$S at pressures above 150~GPa. Our results entails a\nrevision of the ground-state enthalpy-pressure phase diagram. Specifically, we\nfind that the C2/c HS$_2$ structure is persistent up to 440~GPa before\nundergoing a phase transition into the C2/m phase. Contrary to density\nfunctional theory, our calculations suggest that the C2/m phase of HS is more\nstable than the I4$_1$/amd HS structure over the whole pressure range from 150\nto 400 GPa. Moreover, we predict that the Im-3m phase is the most likely\ncandidate for H$_3$S, which is consistent with recent experimental x-ray\ndiffraction measurements.\n", "  {\\it Ab initio} quantum-mechanical calculations of the differential and\nintegrated cross sections of the elastic scattering, Stark transitions, and\nCoulomb de-excitation at collisions of excited $\\mu^- p$ and $\\mu^- d$ atoms\nwith hydrogen isotope atoms in the ground state are performed. The scattering\nprocesses are treated in a unified manner in the framework of the\nclose-coupling approach. The used basis includes both open and closed channels\ncorresponding to all exotic atom states with principal quantum numbers from\n$n=1$ up to $n_{\\rm max}=20$. The energy shifts of $ns$ states due to electron\nvacuum polarization and finite nuclear size are taken into account. The\nkinetics of atomic cascade of $\\mu^- p$ and $\\mu^- d$ atoms are studied in a\nwide range of relative target densities ($\\varphi = 10^{-8} -1$) within the\nimproved version of the extended cascade model. The results of the numerical\nquantum-mechanical calculations of the cross sections for quantum numbers and\nkinetic energies of muonic atoms, that are of interest for the detailed cascade\ncalculations, are used as input data. Initial $(n,l,E)$-distributions of muonic\natoms at the instant of their formation and the target motion are taken into\naccount explicitly in present cascade calculations. The comparison of the\ncalculated cross sections, kinetic energy distributions at the instant of the\n$np\\to 1s$ radiative transitions as well as the absolute and relative $x$-ray\nyields for both muonic hydrogen and muonic deuterium reveals the isotopic\neffects, which, in principal, may be observed experimentally. The present\nresults are mainly in very good agreement with experimental data available in\nthe literature.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of continuous-time two-particle quantum walks on\na one-dimensional noisy lattice. Depending on the initial condition, we show\nhow the interplay between particle indistinguishability and interaction\ndetermines distinct propagation regimes. A realistic model for the environment\nis considered by introducing non-Gaussian noise as time-dependent fluctuations\nof the tunneling amplitudes between adjacent sites. We observe that the\ncombined effect of particle interaction and fast noise (weak coupling with the\nenvironment) provides a faster propagation compared to the noiseless case. This\neffect can be understood in terms of the band structure of the Hubbard model,\nand a detailed analysis as a function of both noise and system parameters is\npresented.\n", "  We consider a family of nonlinear rational recurrences of odd order which was\nintroduced by Heideman and Hogan. All of these recurrences have the Laurent\nproperty, implying that for a particular choice of initial data (all initial\nvalues set to 1) they generate an integer sequence. For these particular\nsequences, Heideman and Hogan gave a direct proof of integrality by showing\nthat the terms of the sequence also satisfy a linear recurrence relation with\nconstant coefficients. Here we present an analogous result for the general\nsolution of each of these recurrences.\n", "  We holographically study supersymmetric deformations of $N=3$ and $N=1$\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs) in three dimensions using\nfour-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three-vector multiplets\nwith non-semisimple $SO(3)\\ltimes (\\mathbf{T}^3,\\hat{\\mathbf{T}}^3)$ gauge\ngroup. This gauged supergravity can be obtained from a truncation of\neleven-dimensional supergravity on a tri-sasakian manifold and admits both\n$N=1,3$ supersymmetric and stable non-supersymmetric $AdS_4$ critical points.\nWe analyze the BPS equations for $SO(3)$ singlet scalars in details and study\npossible supersymmetric solutions. A number of RG flows to non-conformal field\ntheories and half-supersymmetric domain walls are found, and many of them can\nbe given analytically. Apart from these \"flat\" domain walls, we also consider\n$AdS_3$-sliced domain wall solutions describing two-dimensional conformal\ndefects with $N=(1,0)$ supersymmetry within the dual $N=1$ field theory while\nthis type of solutions does not exist in the $N=3$ case.\n", "  Supersolidity is an intriguing concept. It combines the property of\nsuperfluid flow with the long-range spatial periodicity of solids, two\nproperties which are often mutually exclusive. The original discussion of\nquantum crystals and supersolidity focuses on solid Helium-4 where it was\npredicted that vacancies could form dilute weakly interacting Bose-Einstein\ncondensates. In this system, direct observation of supersolidity has been\nelusive. The concept of supersolidity was then generalized to include other\nsuperfluid systems which break the translational symmetry of space. One of such\nsystems is a Bose-Einstein condensate with spin-orbit coupling which has a\nsupersolid stripe phase. Despite several recent studies of this system, the\nstripe phase has not been observed. Here we report the direct observation of\nthe predicted density modulation of the stripe phase using Bragg reflection.\nOur work establishes a system with unique symmetry breaking properties. Of\nfuture interest is further spatial symmetry breaking through the introduction\nof vortices, solitons, impurities or disorder.\n", "  We study second harmonic generation in centrosymmetric Weyl semimetal with\nbroken time reversal symmetry. We calculate electric current density at the\ndouble frequency of the propagating electromagnetic field in the presence of\napplied constant magnetic field, using the method of kinetic equation for\nelectron distribution function. It is shown that the chiral anomaly\ncontribution to second harmonic generation in the lowest order is linearly\nproportional to the applied magnetic field. The limit when the chiral anomaly\ndominates over the Lorentz-type contribution to second harmonic generation is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Four candidates of eclipsing multiples, based on new extraneous eclipses\nfound on Kepler binary light curves, are presented and studied. KIC 7622486 is\na double eclipsing binary candidate with orbital period of 2.2799960 days and\n40.246503 days. The two binary systems do not eclipse each other in the line of\nsight, but there is mutual gravitational influence between them which leads to\nthe small but definite eccentricity 0.0035(0.0022) on the short 2.2799960 days\nperiod orbit. KIC 7668648 is hierarchical quadruple system candidate, with two\nsets of solid 203(+-5) days period extraneous eclipses and another independent\nset of extraneous eclipses. A clear and credible extraneous eclipse is found on\nthe binary light curve of KIC 7670485 which made it a triple system candidates.\nTwo sets of extraneous eclipse of about 390 days and 220 days period are found\non KIC 8938628 binary curves, which not only confirms the previous conclusion\nof $388.5(+-0.3) triple system, but also proposed a new additional objects that\nmake KIC 8938628 a hierarchical quadruple system candidates. It is wished that\nthe four candidates here will make some contributions to the field of eclipsing\nmultiples.\n", "  We study Hanbury-Brown and Twiss current cross-correlations in a\nthree-terminal junction where a central topological superconductor (TS)\nnanowire, bearing Majorana bound states at its ends, is connected to two normal\nleads. Relying on a non-perturbative Green function formalism, our calculations\nallow us to provide analytical expressions for the currents and their\ncorrelations at subgap voltages, while also giving exact numerical results\nvalid for arbitrary external bias. We show that when the normal leads are\nbiased at voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ smaller than the gap, the sign of the\ncurrent cross-correlations is given by $-\\mbox{sgn}(V_1 \\, V_2)$. In\nparticular, this leads to positive cross-correlations for opposite voltages, a\nbehavior in stark contrast with the one of a standard superconductor, which\nprovides a direct evidence of the presence of the Majorana zero-mode at the\nedge of the TS. We further extend our results, varying the length of the TS\n(leading to an overlap of the Majorana bound states) as well as its chemical\npotential (driving it away from half-filling), generalizing the boundary TS\nGreen function to those cases. In the case of opposite bias voltages,\n$\\mbox{sgn}(V_1 \\, V_2)=-1$, driving the TS wire through the topological\ntransition leads to a sign change of the current cross-correlations, providing\nyet another signature of the physics of the Majorana bound state.\n", "  We present a simple strategy to mitigate the impact of an incomplete\nspectroscopic redshift galaxy sample as a result of fiber assignment and survey\ntiling. The method has been designed for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic\nInstrument (DESI) galaxy survey but may have applications beyond this. We\npropose a modification to the usual correlation function that nulls the almost\npurely angular modes affected by survey incompleteness due to fiber assignment.\nPredictions of this modified statistic can be calculated given a model of the\ntwo point correlation function. The new statistic can be computed with a slight\nmodification to the data catalogues input to the standard correlation function\ncode and does not incur any additional computational time. Finally we show that\nthe spherically averaged baryon acoustic oscillation signal is not biased by\nthe new statistic.\n", "  We demonstrate a compact and versatile laser system for stimulated Raman\nspectroscopy (SRS). The system is based on a tunable continuous wave (CW) probe\nlaser combined with a home-built semi-monolithic nanosecond pulsed pump Nd:YVO4\nlaser at 1064 nm. The CW operation of the probe laser offers narrow linewidth,\nlow noise and the advantage that temporal synchronization with the pump is not\nrequired. The laser system enables polarization-sensitive stimulated Raman\nspectroscopy (PS-SRS) with fast high resolution measurement of the\ndepolarization ratio by simultaneous detection of Raman scattered light in\northogonal polarizations, thus providing information about the symmetry of the\nRaman-active vibrational modes. Measurements of the depolarization ratios of\nthe carbon-hydrogen (CH) stretching modes in two different polymer samples in\nthe spectral range of 2825-3025 cm-1 were performed. Raman spectra are obtained\nat a sweep rate of 20 nm/s (84 cm-1/s) with a resolution of 0.65 cm-1. A\nnormalization method is introduced for the direct comparison of the\nsimultaneously acquired orthogonal polarized Raman spectra.\n", "  We have synthesized two new Eu-based compounds, EuSr2Bi2S4F4 and Eu2SrBi2S4F4\nwhich are derivatives of Eu3Bi2S4F4, an intrinsic superconductor with Tc = 1.5\nK. They belong to a tetragonal structure (SG: I4/mmm, Z = 2), similar to the\nparent compound Eu3Bi2S4F4. Our structural and 151Eu M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy\nstudies show that in EuSr2Bi2S4F4, Eu-atoms exclusively occupy the\ncrystallographic 2a-sites. In Eu2SrBi2S4F4, 2a-sites are fully occupied by\nEu-atoms and the other half of Eu-atoms and Sr-atoms together fully occupy\n4e-sites in a statistical distribution. In both compounds Eu atoms occupying\nthe crystallographic 2a-sites are in a homogeneous mixed valent state ~ 2.6 -\n2.7. From our magnetization studies in an applied H = 9 Tesla, we infer that\nthe valence of Eu-atoms in Eu2SrBi2S4F4 at the 2a-sites exhibits a shift\ntowards 2+. Our XPS studies corroborate the occurrence of valence fluctuations\nof Eu and after Ar-ion sputtering show evidence of enhanced population of\nEu2+-states. Resistivity measurements, down to 2 K suggest a semi-metallic\nnature for both compounds.\n", "  Many real world systems exhibit cyclic behavior that is, for example, due to\nthe nearly harmonic oscillations being perturbed by the strong fluctuations\npresent in the regime of significant non-linearities. For the investigation of\nsuch sys- tems special techniques relaxing the assumption to periodicity are\nrequired. In this paper, we present the generalization of one of such\ntechniques, namely the D2 phase dispersion statistic, to multidimensional\ndatasets, especially suited for the analysis of the outputs from\nthree-dimensional numerical simulations of the full magnetohydrodynamic\nequations. We present the motivation and need for the usage of such a method\nwith simple test cases, and present an application to a solar-like semi-global\nnumerical dynamo simulation covering nearly 150 magnetic cycles.\n", "  In this mini-review, possible manifestations of mixing between axion-like\nparticles (ALPs) and energetic photons propagating over astronomical distances\nare considered. We discuss the evidence for the anomalous transparency of the\nUniverse from observations of ensembles of distant gamma-ray sources, present\nthe general formalism for the ALP-photon mixing and explain how this mechanism\nmay remove the anomaly. We present relevant values of ALP parameters and\ndiscuss future ways to verify the scenario and to discover the particle in\nquestion.\n", "  We present a real-time lattice approach to study the non-equilibrium dynamics\nof vector and axial charges in $SU(N) \\times U(1)$ gauge theories. Based on a\nclassical description of the non-Abelian and Abelian gauge fields, we include\ndynamical fermions and develop operator definitions for (improved) Wilson and\noverlap fermions that allow us to study real-time manifestations of the axial\nanomaly from first principles. We present a first application of this approach\nto anomalous transport phenomena such as the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) and\nChiral Separation Effect (CSE) by studying the dynamics of fermions during and\nafter a $SU(N)$ sphaleron transition in the presence of a $U(1)$ magnetic\nfield. We investigate the fermion mass and magnetic field dependence of the\nsuggested signatures of the CME and CSE and point out some important aspects\nwhich need to be accounted for in the macroscopic description of anomalous\ntransport phenomena.\n", "  We report on the cathodoluminescence characterization of Au, Al and a Au/Al\nbimetal circular plasmonic patch antennas, with disk diameter ranging from 150\nto 900 nm. It allows us access to monomode operation of the antennas down to\nthe fundamental dipolar mode, in contrast to previous studies on similar\nsystems. Moreover we show that we can can shift the operation range of the\nantennas towards the blue spectral range by using Al. Our experimental results\nare compared to a semi-analytical model that provides qualitative insight on\nthe mode structure sustained by the antennas.\n", "  Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) can share secret keys by using less\nquantum resource than its fully quantum counterparts, and this likely makes\nSQKD become more practical and realizable. In this paper, we present a new SQKD\nprotocol by introducing the idea of B92 into semi-quantum key distribution and\nprove its unconditional security. In this protocol, the sender Alice just sends\none qubit to the classical Bob and Bob just prepares one state in the\npreparation process. Indeed the classical user's measurement is not necessary\neither. This protocol can reduce some quantum communication and make it easier\nto be implemented. It can be seen as the semi-quantum version of B92 protocol,\ncomparing to the protocol BKM2007 as the semi-quantum version of BB84 in fully\nquantum cryptography. We verify it has higher key rate and therefore is more\nefficient. Specifically we prove it is unconditionally secure by computing a\nlower bound of the key rate in the asymptotic scenario from information theory\naspect. Then we can find a threshold value of errors such that for all error\nrates less than this value, the secure key can be established between the\nlegitimate users definitely. We make an illustration of how to compute the\nthreshold value in case of the reverse channel is a depolarizing one with\nparameter $p$. Though the threshold value is a little smaller than those of\nsome existed SQKD protocols, it can be comparable to the B92 protocol in fully\nquantum cryptography.\n", "  We present a stacked weak lensing analysis of 27 richness selected galaxy\nclusters at $0.40 \\leqslant z \\leqslant 0.62$ in the CODEX survey. The fields\nwere observed in 5 bands with the CFHT. We measure the stacked surface mass\ndensity profile with a $14\\sigma$ significance in the radial range $0.1 < R\\\nMpc\\ h^{-1} < 2.5$. The profile is well described by the halo model, with the\nmain halo term following an NFW profile and including the off-centring effect.\nWe select the background sample using a conservative colour-magnitude method to\nreduce the potential systematic errors and contamination by cluster member\ngalaxies. We perform a Bayesian analysis for the stacked profile and constrain\nthe best-fit NFW parameters $M_{200c} = 6.6^{+1.0}_{-0.8} \\times 10^{14} h^{-1}\nM_{\\odot}$ and $c_{200c} = 3.7^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$. The off-centring effect was\nmodelled based on previous observational results found for redMaPPer SDSS\nclusters. Our constraints on $M_{200c}$ and $c_{200c}$ allow us to investigate\nthe consistency with numerical predictions and select a concentration-mass\nrelation to describe the high richness CODEX sample. Comparing our best-fit\nvalues for $M_{200c}$ and $c_{200c}$ with other observational surveys at\ndifferent redshifts, we find no evidence for evolution in the\nconcentration-mass relation, though it could be mitigated by particular\nselection functions. Similar to previous studies investigating the X-ray\nluminosity-mass relation, our data suggests a lower evolution than expected\nfrom self-similarity.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to find an ultraviolet completion of the\nsimple extensions of the Standard Model where baryon number is a local\nsymmetry. In the context of such theories one can understand the spontaneous\nbreaking of baryon number at the low scale and the proton stability. We find a\nsimple theory based on SU(4)_C x SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R where baryon number is\nembedded in a non-Abelian gauge symmetry. We discuss the main features of the\ntheory and the possible implications for experiments. This theory predicts\nstable colored and/or fractional electric charged fields which can give rise to\nvery exotic signatures at the Large Hadron Collider experiments such as CMS and\nATLAS. We further discuss the embedding in a gauge theory based on SU(4)_C x\nSU(4)_L x SU(4)_R which could define the way to achieve the unification of the\ngauge interactions at the low scale.\n", "  Mimetic gravity is a Weyl-symmetric extension of General Relativity, related\nto the latter by a singular disformal transformation, wherein the appearance of\na dust-like perfect fluid can mimic cold dark matter at a cosmological level.\nWithin this framework, it is possible to provide an unified geometrical\nexplanation for dark matter, the late-time acceleration, and inflation, making\nit a very attractive theory. In this review, we summarize the main aspects of\nmimetic gravity, as well as extensions of the minimal formulation of the model.\nWe devote particular focus to the reconstruction technique, which allows the\nrealization of any desired expansionary history of the Universe by an accurate\nchoice of potential, or other functions defined within the theory (as in the\ncase of mimetic $f(R)$ gravity). We briefly discuss cosmological perturbation\ntheory within mimetic gravity. As a case study within which we apply the\nconcepts previously discussed, we study a mimetic Ho\\v{r}ava-like theory, of\nwhich we explore solutions and cosmological perturbations in detail. Finally,\nwe conclude the review by discussing static spherically symmetric solutions\nwithin mimetic gravity, and apply our findings to the problem of galactic\nrotation curves. Our review provides an introduction to mimetic gravity, as\nwell as a concise but self-contained summary of recent findings, progresses,\nopen questions, and outlooks on future research directions.\n", "  We report the analysis of the $10-1000$ TeV large-scale sidereal anisotropy\nof Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with the data collected by the Tibet Air Shower\nArray from October, 1995 to February, 2010. In this analysis, we improve the\nenergy estimate and extend the declination range down to $-30^{\\circ}$. We find\nthat the anisotropy maps above 100 TeV are distinct from that at multi-TeV\nband. The so-called \"tail-in\" and \"loss-cone\" features identified at low\nenergies get less significant and a new component appears at $\\sim100$ TeV. The\nspatial distribution of the GCR intensity with an excess (7.2$\\sigma$\npre-trial, 5.2$\\sigma$ post-trial) and a deficit ($-5.8\\sigma$ pre-trial) are\nobserved in the 300 TeV anisotropy map, in a good agreement with IceCube's\nresults at 400 TeV. Combining the Tibet results in the northern sky with\nIceCube's results in the southern sky, we establish a full-sky picture of the\nanisotropy in hundreds of TeV band. We further find that the amplitude of the\nfirst order anisotropy increases sharply above $\\sim100$ TeV, indicating a new\ncomponent of the anisotropy. All these results may shed new light on\nunderstanding the origin and propagation of GCRs.\n", "  We determine the abundances of neutron-capture elements from Sr to Eu for\nfive very-metal-poor stars (-3<[Fe/H]<-2) in the Milky Way halo to reveal the\norigin of light neutron-capture elements. Previous spectroscopic studies have\nshown evidence of at least two components in the r-process; one referred to as\nthe \"main r-process\" and the other as the \"weak r-process,\" which is mainly\nresponsible for producing heavy and light neutron-capture elements,\nrespectively. Observational studies of metal-poor stars suggest that there is a\nuniversal pattern in the main r-process, similar to the abundance pattern of\nthe r-process component of solar-system material. Still, it is uncertain\nwhether the abundance pattern of the weak r-process shows universality or\ndiversity, due to the sparseness of measured light neutron-capture elements. We\nhave detected the key elements, Mo, Ru, and Pd, in five target stars to give an\nanswer to this question. The abundance patterns of light neutron-capture\nelements from Sr to Pd suggest a diversity in the weak r-process. In\nparticular, scatter in the abundance ratio between Ru and Pd is significant\nwhen the abundance patterns are normalized at Zr. Our results are compared with\nthe elemental abundances predicted by nucleosynthesis models of supernovae with\nparameters such as electron fraction or proto-neutron-star mass, to investigate\nsources of such diversity in the abundance patterns of light neutron-capture\nelements. This paper presents that the variation in the abundances of observed\nstars can be explained with a small range of parameters, which can serve as\nconstraints on future modeling of supernova models.\n", "  The luminosity range at and just below the 10^39 erg/s cut-off for defining\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) is a little-explored regime. It\nnone-the-less hosts a large number of X-ray sources, and has great potential\nfor improving our understanding of sources with ~Eddington accretion rates. We\nselect a sample of four sources in this Eddington Threshold regime with good\ndata for further study; these objects possess a variety of soft spectral\nshapes. We perform X-ray spectral and timing analysis on the XMM-Newton and\nChandra data for these objects to gain insight into their accretion mechanisms,\nand also examine their optical counterparts using HST images. NGC 300 X-1 is a\nhighly luminous and well-known example of the canonical steep power-law\naccretion state. M51 ULS exhibits a cool blackbody-like spectrum and is\nconsistent with being an ultraluminous supersoft source (ULS), possibly a\nsuper-Eddington accreting object viewed at a high inclination through an\noptically thick outflowing wind. NGC 4395 ULX-1 and NGC 6946 ULX-1 have\nunusually steep power-law tails, for which we discuss a variety of possible\nphysical mechanisms and links to similar features in Galactic microquasars, and\nwe conclude that these sources are likely intermediate objects between the soft\nultraluminous regime of ULXs and classic ULSs.\n", "  We analyze the spectrum of the Hamiltonian of a photon propagating in a\nstrong magnetic field $B\\sim B_{\\rm{cr}}$, where $B_{\\rm cr}= \\frac{m^2}{e}\n\\simeq 4.4 \\times 10^{13}$ Gauss is the Schwinger critical field . We show that\nthe expected value of the Hamiltonian of a quantized photon for a perpendicular\nmode is a concave function of the magnetic field $B$. We show by a partially\nanalytic and numerical method that the anomalous magnetic moment of a photon in\nthe one loop approximation is a non - decreasing function of the magnetic field\n$B$ in the range $0\\leq B \\leq 30 \\, B_{\\rm cr}$ We provide a numerical\nrepresentation of the expression for the anomalous magnetic moment in terms of\nspecial functions. We find that the anomalous magnetic moment $\\mu_\\gamma$ of a\nphoton for $B=30\\, B_{\\rm cr }$ is $8/3$ of the anomalous magnetic moment of a\nphoton for $B = 1/2 ~ B_{\\rm cr}$.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that trivalent ion, spermidine$^{3+}$, can\nprovoke lateral microphase segregation in DNA brushes. Using molecular\nsimulations and simple theoretical arguments, we explore the effects of\ntrivalent counterions on polyelectrolyte brushes. At a proper range of grafting\ndensity, polymer size, and ion concentration, the brush polymers collapse\nheterogeneously into octopus-like surface micelles. Remarkably, the\nheterogeneity in brush morphology is maximized and the relaxation dynamics of\nchain and condensed ion are the slowest at the 1:3 stoichiometric concentration\nof trivalent ions to polyelectrolyte charge. A further increase of trivalent\nion concentration conducive to a charge inversion elicits modest reswelling and\nhomogenizes the morphology of brush condensate. Our study provides a new\ninsight into the origin of the diversity in DNA organization in cell nuclei as\nwell as the ion-dependent morphological variation in polyelectrolyte brush\nlayer of biological membranes.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been proposed as potential building blocks\nfor field effect transistor (FET) devices due to their quantum confinement\nbandgap. Here, we propose a novel GNR device concept, enabling the control of\nboth charge and spin signals, integrated within the simplest three-terminal\ndevice configuration. In a conventional FET device, a gate electrode is\nemployed to tune the Fermi level of the system in and out of a static bandgap.\nBy contrast, in the switching mechanism proposed here, the applied gate voltage\ncan dynamically open and close an interaction gap, with only a minor shift of\nthe Fermi level. Furthermore, the strong interplay of the band structure and\nedge spin configuration in zigzag ribbons enables such transistors to carry\nspin polarized current without employing an external magnetic field or\nferromagnetic contacts. Using an experimentally validated theoretical model, we\nshow that such transistors can switch at low voltages and high speed, and the\nspin polarization of the current can be tuned from 0% to 50% by using the same\nback gate electrode. Furthermore, such devices are expected to be robust\nagainst edge irregularities and can operate at room temperature. Controlling\nboth charge and spin signal within the simplest FET device configuration could\nopen up new routes in data processing with graphene based devices.\n", "  Motivated by the recent discoveries of some compounds such as the\n$\\mathrm{Bi}_{2}\\mathrm{Fe}_{4}\\mathrm{O}_{9}$ which crystallizes in an\northorhombic crystal structure with the $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ions, and iron-based\noxyfluoride ${\\rm Bi}_{4}{\\rm Fe}_{5}{\\rm O}_{13}{\\rm F}$ compounds following\nthe pattern of Cairo pentagonal structure, among some other compounds. We\npropose a model for one stripe of the Cairo pentagonal Ising-Heisenberg\nlattice, one of the edges of a pentagon is different, and this edge will be\nassociated with a Heisenberg exchange interaction, while the Ising exchange\ninteractions will associate the other edges. We study the phase transition at\nzero temperature, illustrating five phases: a ferromagnetic phase (FM), a dimer\nantiferromagnetic (DAF), a plaquette antiferromagnetic (PAF), a typical\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) and a peculiar frustrated phase (FRU) where two types\nof frustrated states with the same energy coexist. To obtain the partition\nfunction of this model, we use the transfer matrix approach and following the\neight vertex model notation. Using this result we discuss the specific heat,\ninternal energy and entropy as a function of the temperature, and we can\nobserve some unexpected behavior in the low-temperature limit, such as\nanomalous double peak in specific heat due to the existence of three phase\n(FRU, PAF(AFM) and FM) transitions occurring in a close region to each other.\nConsequently, the low-lying energy thermal excitation generates this double\nanomalous peak, and we also discuss the internal energy at the low temperature\nlimit, where this double peak curve occurs. Some properties of our result were\ncompared with two dimensional Cairo pentagonal lattices, as well as orthogonal\ndimer plaquette Ising-Heisenberg chain.\n", "  We investigate the structural, electronic, transport, and thermoelectric\nproperties of LaNiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3(001)$ superlattices containing either\nexclusively $n$- or $p$-type interfaces or coupled interfaces of opposite\npolarity by using density functional theory calculations with an on-site\nCoulomb repulsion term. The results show that significant octahedral tilts are\ninduced in the SrTiO$_3$ part of the superlattice. Moreover, the La-Sr\ndistances and Ni-O out-of-plane bond lengths at the interfaces exhibit a\ndistinct variation by about $7\\,\\%$ with the sign of the electrostatic doping.\nIn contrast to the much studied LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ system, the charge mismatch\nat the interfaces is exclusively accommodated within the LaNiO$_3$ layers,\nwhereas the interface polarity leads to a band offset and to the formation of\nan electric field within the coupled superlattice. Features of the electronic\nstructure indicate an orbital-selective quantization of quantum well states.\nThe potential- and confinement-induced multiband splitting results in complex\ncylindrical Fermi surfaces with a tendency towards nesting that depends on the\ninterface polarity. The analysis of the thermoelectric response reveals a\nparticularly large positive Seebeck coefficient ($135~\\mu$V/K) and a high\nfigure of merit ($0.35$) for room-temperature cross-plane transport in the\n$p$-type superlattice that is attributed to the participation of the SrTiO$_3$\nvalence band. Superlattices with either $n$- or $p$-type interfaces show\ncross-plane Seebeck coefficients of opposite sign and thus emerge as a platform\nto construct an oxide-based thermoelectric generator with structurally and\nelectronically compatible $n$- and $p$-type oxide thermoelectrics.\n", "  We study the correlators of irregular vertex operators in two-dimensional\nconformal field theory (CFT) in order to propose an exact analytic formula for\ncalculating numbers of partitions, that is:\n  1) for given $N,k$, finding the total number $\\lambda(N|k)$ of length $k$\npartitions of $N$: $N=n_1+...+n_k;0<n_1\\leq{n_2}...\\leq{n_k}$.\n  2) finding the total number $\\lambda(N)=\\sum_{k=1}^N\\lambda(N|k)$ of\npartitions of a natural number $N$\n  We propose an exact analytic expression for $\\lambda(N|k)$ by relating\ntwo-point short-distance correlation functions of irregular vertex operators in\n$c=1$ conformal field theory ( the form of the operators is established in this\npaper): with the first correlator counting the partitions in the upper\nhalf-plane and the second one obtained from the first correlator by conformal\ntransformations of the form $f(z)=h(z)e^{-{i\\over{z}}}$ where $h(z)$ is regular\nand non-vanishing at $z=0$. The final formula for $\\lambda(N|k)$ is given in\nterms of regularized ($\\epsilon$-ordered) finite series in the generalized\nhigher-derivative Schwarzians and incomplete Bell polynomials of the above\nconformal transformation at $z=i\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon\\rightarrow{0}$)\n", "  Thermal motions in the 2D Lennard-Jones liquid near solidification are\nstudied at equilibrium and under shear flow conditions. At the temperatures of\nthe study, the liquid is significantly aggregated. On times of few to few tens\nof particles vibration periods, the dominant features are particles in-cage\nvibrations and the highest frequency longitudinal and transverse Hypersound. On\ntime-scales of hundreds to thousands of vibration periods, the liquid appears\nspatially heterogeneous. On these times, slow non-oscillatory fluctuating\ncurrents persist for surprisingly long times; the hierarchical dynamics of the\nheterogeneous liquid results in changing temperature, density, and velocity\nprofiles across the system. Heterogeneity fades, and a crossover to\nnon-fluctuational Hydrodynamics is observed for smoothing times of many tens of\nthousands vibration periods. On these asymptotically-large times, the liquid is\nspatially homogeneous except for thin layers near the boundaries where the\ndegree of crystallinity increases and the mobility decreases due to\nliquid-boundary interactions.\n", "  We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the ACS Treasury Survey to\ndetermine fits for single population isochrones of 69 Galactic globular\nclusters. Using robust Bayesian analysis techniques, we simultaneously\ndetermine ages, distances, absorptions, and helium values for each cluster\nunder the scenario of a \"single\" stellar population on model grids with solar\nratio heavy element abundances. The set of cluster parameters is determined in\na consistent and reproducible manner for all clusters using the Bayesian\nanalysis suite BASE-9. Our results are used to re-visit the age-metallicity\nrelation. We find correlations with helium and several other parameters such as\nmetallicity, binary fraction, and proxies for cluster mass. The helium\nabundances of the clusters are also considered in the context of CNO abundances\nand the multiple population scenario.\n", "  The maximum magnetic moment to angular momentum conjecture, recently posed by\nBarrow \\& Gibbons, is in tension with the generally accepted parameters of\nmagnetars. According to the conjecture the dimensionless\nSchuster-Wilson-Blacket number, $c\\mu/J\\sqrt{G}$ where $\\mu$ is the magnetic\nmoment and $J$ is the angular momentum, should be of order unity. A resolution\nis to assume that not only the low-magnetic field magnetars, but all magnetars\nhave their super-critical fields in the higher multipoles. This requires the\npresence of external torques other than the magnetic dipole torque, such as\nfrom fallback disks or winds, on these systems to yield the measured high\nspin-down rates.\n", "  We combine star formation along the `main sequence', quiescence, and\nclustering and merging to produce an empirical model for the evolution of\nindividual galaxies. Main sequence star formation alone would significantly\nsteepen the stellar mass function towards low redshift, in sharp conflict with\nobservation. However, a combination of star formation and merging produces a\nconsistent result for correct choice of the merger rate function. As a result,\nwe are motivated to propose a model in which hierarchical merging is\ndisconnected from environmentally-independent star formation. This model can be\ntested via correlation functions and would produce new constraints on\nclustering and merging.\n", "  We introduce error-correcting codes that can correct for fermion\nparity-violating (quasiparticle poisoning) and parity-conserving errors in\nsystems of complex fermions and of Majorana fermions. After establishing\nproperties of fermion codes, we introduce a generic construction of fermion\ncodes from weakly self-dual classical, binary error-correcting codes. We use\nthis method to construct (i) the shortest fermion code to correct for\nquasiparticle poisoning errors, (ii) translationally-invariant fermion codes\nand (iii) other codes that correct higher-weight errors. We conclude by\ndiscussing a possible physical realizations of one such code in mesoscopic\nsuperconductors hosting Majorana zero modes.\n", "  We develop a method to identify the spectroscopic signature of unresolved\nL-dwarf ultracool companions, which compares the spectra of candidates and\ntheir associated control stars using spectral ratio differences and residual\nspectra. We present SpeX prism-mode spectra (0.7-2.5 micron) for a pilot sample\nof 111 mid M dwarfs, including 28 that were previously identified as candidates\nfor unresolved ultracool companionship (a sub-sample from Cook et al. 2016;\npaper 1) and 83 single M dwarfs that were optically colour-similar to these\ncandidates (which we use as `control stars'). We identify four candidates with\nevidence for near-infrared excess. One of these (WISE J100202.50+074136.3)\nshows strong evidence for an unresolved L dwarf companion in both its spectral\nratio difference and its residual spectra, two most likely have a different\nsource for the near-infrared excess, and the other may be due to spectral\nnoise. We also establish expectations for a null result (i.e. by searching for\ncompanionship signatures around the M dwarf control stars), as well as\ndetermining the expected outcome for ubiquitous companionship (as a means of\ncomparison with our actual results), using artificially generated unresolved\nM+L dwarf spectra. The results of these analyses are compared to those for the\ncandidate sample, and reasonable consistency is found. With a full follow-up\nprogramme of our candidates sample from Cook et al., we might expect to confirm\nup to 40 such companions in the future, adding extensively to the known desert\npopulation of M3-M5 dwarfs.\n", "  We present experimental results of a homopolar disc dynamo constructed at\nCICATA-Quer\\'etaro in Mexico. The device consists of a flat, multi-arm spiral\ncoil which is placed above a fast-spinning metal disc and connected to the\nlatter by sliding liquid-metal electrical contacts. Theoretically,\nself-excitation of the magnetic field is expected at the critical magnetic\nReynolds number Rm~45, which corresponds to a critical rotation rate of about\n10 Hz. We measured the magnetic field above the disc and the voltage drop on\nthe coil for the rotation rate up to 14 Hz, at which the liquid metal started\nto leak from the outer sliding contact. Instead of the steady magnetic field\npredicted by the theory we detected a strongly fluctuating magnetic field with\na strength comparable to that of Earth's magnetic field which was accompanied\nby similar voltage fluctuations in the coil. These fluctuations seem to be\ncaused by the intermittent electrical contact through the liquid metal. The\nexperimental results suggest that the dynamo with the actual electrical\nresistance of liquid metal contacts could be excited at the rotation rate of\naround 21 Hz provided that the leakage of liquid metal is prevented.\n", "  An innovative computational approach to capturing the essential aspects of an\nEnhanced Geothermal System (EGS) is formulated. The modified finite element\nmethod is utilized to model transient heat and fluid flow within an EGS\nreservoir. Three main features are modified to determine their impact on the\nreservoir: the fracture model, the porous model, and the coupling physical\nmodel. For the first feature, the fractures are modeled as a two-dimensional\nsubdomain embedded in a vast three-dimensional rock mass. The fracture model\neliminates the need to create slender fractures with a high aspect ratio by\nallowing reduction of the spatial discretization of the fractures from three-\nto two-dimensional finite elements. In this model, pseudo three-dimensional\nequations are adopted to drive the physics of heat and fluid flow in the\nfractures. In the second feature, a porous subdomain with effective transport\nproperties is modeled to integrate a thermally-shocked region in the reservoir\nsimulation. In the third feature, three-dimensional heat flow in the rock mass\nis coupled to the two-dimensional heat and fluid flow in the fractures.\nNumerical examples are computed to illustrate the computational capability of\nthe proposed model to simulate heat and fluid flow in an EGS. Results show that\nthe proposed model is capable of both effectively integrating thermal fractures\ninto reservoir simulation, as well as efficiently tackling the computational\nburden exerted by high aspect ratio geometries. A parametric analysis is also\nperformed in which the effect of thermal fractures and thermally-shocked region\non reservoir performance is evaluated.\n", "  Because of the denser active use of the spectrum, and because of radio\ntelescopes higher sensitivity, radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation\nhas become a sensitive topic for current and future radio telescope designs.\nEven if quite sophisticated approaches have been proposed in the recent years,\nthe majority of RFI mitigation operational procedures are based on\npost-correlation corrupted data flagging. Moreover, given the huge amount of\ndata delivered by current and next generation radio telescopes, all these RFI\ndetection procedures have to be at least automatic and, if possible, real-time.\n  In this paper, the implementation of a real-time pre-correlation RFI\ndetection and flagging procedure into generic high-performance computing\nplatforms based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) is described,\nsimulated and tested. One of these boards, UniBoard, developed under a Joint\nResearch Activity in the RadioNet FP7 European programme is based on eight\nFPGAs interconnected by a high speed transceiver mesh. It provides up to ~4\nTMACs with Altera Stratix IV FPGA and 160 Gbps data rate for the input data\nstream.\n  Considering the high in-out data rate in the pre-correlation stages, only\nreal-time and go-through detectors (i.e. no iterative processing) can be\nimplemented. In this paper, a real-time and adaptive detection scheme is\ndescribed.\n  An ongoing case study has been set up with the Electronic Multi-Beam Radio\nAstronomy Concept (EMBRACE) radio telescope facility at Nan\\c{c}ay Observatory.\nThe objective is to evaluate the performances of this concept in term of\nhardware complexity, detection efficiency and additional RFI metadata rate\ncost. The UniBoard implementation scheme is described.\n", "  V-type asteroids are a taxonomic class whose surface is associated to a\nbasaltic composition. The only known source of V-type asteroids in the Main\nAsteroid Belt is (4) Vesta, that is located in the inner part of the belt.\nHowever, many V-type asteroids cannot be dynamically linked to Vesta., in\nparticular, those asteroids located in the middle and outer parts of the Belt.\nPrevious works have failed to find mechanisms to transport V-type asteroids\nfrom the inner to the middle and outer belt. In this work we propose a\ndynamical mechanism that could have acted on primordial asteroid families. We\nconsider a model of the giant planets migration known as the jumping Jupiter\nmodel with five planets. Our study is focused on the period of 10 Myr that\nencompasses the instability phase of the giant planets. We show that, for\ndifferent hypothetical Vesta-like paleo-families in the inner belt, the\nperturbations caused by the ice giant that is scattered into the asteroid belt\nbefore being ejected from the solar system, are able to scatter V-type\nasteroids to the middle and outer belt. Based on the orbital distribution of\nV-type candidates identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the VISTA\nSurvey colours, we show that this mechanism is efficient enough provided that\nthe hypothetical paleo-family originated from a 100 to 500 km crater excavated\non the surface of (4) Vesta. This mechanism is able to explain the currently\nobserved V-type asteroids in the middle and outer belt, with the exception of\n(1459) Magnya.\n", "  We report a novel optical multistability in two core oppositely directed\nsaturable coupler (ODSC) with negative index material (NIM) channel. The\ndynamics are studied using the Langrangian variational method and Jacobi\nelliptic functions are used to construct the analytical solutions. The ODSC\nexhibits a bandgap as a consequence of the effective feedback mechanism due to\nthe opposite directionality of the phase velocity and Poynting vector in the\nNIM channel. We observe that the system admits multiple stable states for some\ncontrol parameter, which is a result of the combination of nonlinear saturation\nand the unique backward-coupling mechanism in the NIM channel. The number of\nmultiple stable states increase with the strength of the nonlinear saturation.\nTaking the advantage of multiple stable states, one can construct ultrafast\nswitching devices with a flexible switching operation. The studies on the\ntransmission characteristics of the ODSC implies the existence of multiple\ntransmission resonance windows, which could help in the realization of gap\nsoliton in homogeneous systems like coupler. With more degrees of design\nfreedom and controllability, the ODSC could be the choice for a future\ngeneration of all-optical switching.\n", "  The connection between coarse-graining of measurement and emergence of\nclassicality has been investigated for some time, if not well understood.\nRecently in (PRL $\\textbf{112}$, 010402, (2014)) it was pointed out that\ncoarse-graining measurements can lead to non-violation of Bell-type\ninequalities by a state which would violate it under sharp measurements. We\nstudy here the effects of coarse-grained measurements on bipartite cat states.\nWe show that while it is true that coarse-graining does indeed lead to\nnon-violation of a Bell-type inequality, this is not reflected at the state\nlevel. Under such measurements the post-measurement states can be non-classical\n(in the quantum optical sense) and in certain cases coarse-graning can lead to\nan increase in this non-classicality with respect to the coarse-graining\nparameter. While there is no universal way to quantify non-classicality, we do\nso using well understood notions in quantum optics such as the negativity of\nthe Wigner function and the singular nature of the Gluaber-Sudharshan P\ndistribution.\n", "  Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is generally used to detect any changes in\nthe active part of the test object. Several studies have analyzed the effect of\ndifferent mechanical changes including deformations and oil insulation decays\non frequency response of transformers as a test object, however noresearch has\never studied the effect of gas degradation on frequency signature of a gas\ninsulated substation (GIS). This paper investigates the possibility of using\nfrequency response analysis to assess the quality of insulation medium in gas\ninsulated substation (GIS). For this purpose, a single phase GIS filled with\nSF6 between the main conductor and the enclosure is simulated in Maxwell 3D\nusing finite element method to obtain the electrical parameters of the\nsubstation in real mode operation. Measurement of frequency response was\ncarried out in GIS simulations with different insulation qualities from healthy\nto weak condition. The results show that the frequency response of GIS can\ndisclose any minor deterioration in gas quality of the switchgear.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on a STU black\nhole. We observe that these thermal fluctuations can affect the stability of a\nSTU black hole. We will also analyze the effects of these thermal fluctuations\non the thermodynamic of STU black hole. Furthermore, in the Jacobson formalism\nsuch a modification will produce a deformation of the geometry of the STU black\nhole. Hence, we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to analyze the effect of such a\ndeformation on the dual quark-gluon plasma. So, we explicitly analyze the\neffect of thermal fluctuations on the shear viscosity to entropy ratio in the\nquark-gluon plasma, and analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on this\nratio.\n", "  In an external electric field, a system of conductive grains embedded in a\ndielectric matrix becomes unstable and relaxes towards a conductive state. We\ndescribe and discuss the elementary acts of this relaxation. When the grains\npacking density is large, the relaxation is controlled by narrow gaps\nseparating neighboring grains. The electric fields in some gaps are enhanced,\nrelative to the external field, by the factor R/l, R being the grain radius and\nl the width of the gap. These enhanced fields trigger dielectric breakdown in\nthe gaps. Both breakdown events and grain motions increase the permittivity of\nthe composite; advancement of the breakdown process leads to global failure of\ninsulation. The non-linear and hysteretic charge-discharge behavior of the\nsystem is determined by the main parameters characterizing the breakdown, the\ndelay time relative to electric field increase, and the lifetime of breakdown\nconductivity after the supporting current has vanished.\n", "  Most of the calcium in the body is stored in bone. The rest is stored\nelsewhere, and calcium signalling is one of the most important mechanisms of\ninformation propagation in the body. Yet, many questions remain open. In this\nwork, we initially consider the mathematical model proposed in Atri et al.\n\\cite{ atri1993single}. Omitting diffusion, the model is a system of two\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the calcium concentration,\nand the fraction of $IP_3$ receptors that have not been inactivated by the\ncalcium. We analyse in detail the system as the $IP_3$ concentration, the\n\\textit{bifurcation parameter}, increases presenting some new insights. We\nanalyse asymptotically the relaxation oscillations of the model by exploiting a\nseparation of timescales. Furthermore, motivated by experimental evidence that\ncells release calcium when mechanically stimulated and that, in turn, calcium\nrelease affects the mechanical behaviour of cells, we propose an extension of\nthe Atri model to a 3D nonlinear ODE mechanochemical model, where the\nadditional equation, derived consistently from a full viscoelastic\n\\emph{ansatz}, models the evolution of cell/tissue dilatation. Furthermore, in\nthe calcium dynamics equation we introduce a new \"stretch-activation\" source\nterm that induces calcium release and which involves a new bifurcation\nparameter, the \"strength\" of the source. Varying the two bifurcation\nparameters, we analyse in detail the interplay of the mechanical and the\nchemical effects, and we find that as the strength of the mechanical stimulus\nis increased, the $IP_3$ parameter range for which oscillations emerge\ndecreases, until oscillations eventually vanish at a critical value. Finally,\nwe analyse the model when the calcium dynamics are assumed faster than the\ndynamics of the other two variables.\n", "  We show that polarization states of electromagnetic waves can be manipulated\neasily using a single thin uniaxial crystal plate. By performing a rotational\ntransformation of the coordinates and controlling the thickness of the plate,\nwe can achieve a complete polarization conversion between TE wave and TM wave\nin a spectral band. We show that the off-diagonal element of the permittivity\nis the key for polarization conversion. Our analysis can explain clearly the\nresults found in experiments with metamaterials. Finally, we propose a simple\ndevice to realize unidirectional transmission based on polarization conversion\nand excitation of surface plasmon polaritons.\n", "  Detecting weak seismic events from noisy sensors is a difficult perceptual\ntask. We formulate this task as Bayesian inference and propose a generative\nmodel of seismic events and signals across a network of spatially distributed\nstations. Our system, SIGVISA, is the first to directly model seismic\nwaveforms, allowing it to incorporate a rich representation of the physics\nunderlying the signal generation process. We use Gaussian processes over\nwavelet parameters to predict detailed waveform fluctuations based on\nhistorical events, while degrading smoothly to simple parametric envelopes in\nregions with no historical seismicity. Evaluating on data from the western US,\nwe recover three times as many events as previous work, and reduce mean\nlocation errors by a factor of four while greatly increasing sensitivity to\nlow-magnitude events.\n", "  Eugene Wigner famously argued for the \"unreasonable effectiveness of\nmathematics\" for describing physics and other natural sciences in his 1960\nessay. That essay has now led to some 55 years of (sometimes anguished) soul\nsearching --- responses range from \"So what? Why do you think we developed\nmathematics in the first place?\", through to extremely speculative ruminations\non the existence of the universe (multiverse) as a purely mathematical entity\n--- the Mathematical Universe Hypothesis. In the current essay I will steer an\nutterly prosaic middle course: Much of the mathematics we develop is informed\nby physics questions we are tying to solve; and those physics questions for\nwhich the most utilitarian mathematics has successfully been developed are\ntypically those where the best physics progress has been made.\n", "  Extinction coefficient is fundamental to analyze radiative transport in\nmicro/nano particle suspensions. In the traditional transmission method for\nmeasuring the extinction coefficient of particles in a cuvette, a reference\nsystem is used to compensate the influence of the cuvette and base fluid.\nHowever, the multiple reflections and refractions between the air/glass and\nliquid/glass interfaces cannot be sufficiently eliminated by using the\nreference system, and the induced measurement error increases significantly\nwith increasing difference in refractive index between two neighboring media at\nthese interfaces. In this paper, an improved transmission method is proposed to\nmeasure the extinction coefficient of micro/nano particles. The extinction\ncoefficient of the particles is determined based on an optical model taking\ninto account the multiple reflection and refraction at the glass/liquid\ninterfaces. An experimental validation was conducted for suspensions with\nvarious mean particle sizes. By considering the higher-order transmission\nterms, the improved transmission method generally achieved high accuracy\nimprovement over the traditional transmission method for extinction coefficient\nmeasurement, especially for the case with small optical thickness of particle\nsuspensions. This work provides an alternative and more accurate way for\nmeasuring the extinction characteristics of micro/nano particle suspensions.\n", "  The DSN Transient Observatory (DTO) is a signal processing facility that can\nmonitor up to four DSN downlink bands for astronomically interesting signals.\nThe monitoring is done commensally with reception of deep space mission\ntelemetry. The initial signal processing is done with two CASPER ROACH1 boards,\neach handling one or two baseband signals. Each ROACH1 has a 10~GBe interface\nwith a GPU-equipped Debian Linux workstation for additional processing. The\ninitial science programs include monitoring Mars for electrostatic discharges,\nradio spectral lines, searches for fast radio bursts and pulsars and SETI. The\nfacility will be available to the scientific community through a peer review\nprocess.\n", "  Hybrid quantum gates hold great promise for quantum information processing\nsince they preserve the advantages of different quantum systems. Here we\npresent compact quantum circuits to deterministically implement controlled-NOT,\nToffoli, and Fredkin gates between a flying photon qubit and diamond\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers assisted by microcavities. The target qubits of\nthese universal quantum gates are encoded on the spins of the electrons\nassociated with the diamond NV centers and they have long coherence time for\nstoring information, and the control qubit is encoded on the polarizations of\nthe flying photon and can be easily manipulated. Our quantum circuits are\ncompact, economic, and simple. Moreover, they do not require additional qubits.\nThe complexity of our schemes for universal three-qubit gates is much reduced,\ncompared to the synthesis with two-qubit entangling gates. These schemes have\nhigh fidelities and efficiencies, and they are feasible in experiment.\n", "  Flexoelectricity phenomenon is the response of electric polarization to an\napplied strain gradient and is developed as a consequence of crystal symmetry\nin all materials. In this study, we show that the presence of strain gradient\nin non-piezoelectric graphene sheet does not only affect the ionic positions,\nbut also the asymmetric redistribution of the electron density, which induce\nstrong polarization in the graphene sheet. Using quantum mechanics\ncalculations, the resulting axial and normal piezoelectric coefficients of the\ngraphene sheet were determined using two loading conditions: (i) a graphene\nsheet containing non-centrosymmetric pores subjected to an axial load, and (ii)\na pristine graphene sheet subjected to a bending moment. Particular emphases\nwere placed on the role of edge and corner states of pores arising due to the\nfunctionalization. We also investigated the electronic structure of graphene\nsheet under different in-plane strain distributions using quantum mechanics\ncalculations and tight-binding approach. The findings of our work reveal that\nthe respective axial and normal electromechanical couplings in graphene can be\nengineered by changing the size of non-centrosymmetric pores and radii of\ncurvature. Our fundamental study highlights the possibility of using graphene\nsheets in nanoelectromechanical systems as sensors or actuators\n", "  Based on extensive evolutionary algorithm driven structural search, we\npropose a new diphosphorus trisulfide (P2S3) 2D crystal, which is dynamically,\nthermally and chemically stable as confirmed by the computed phonon spectrum\nand ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. This 2D crystalline phase of P2S3\ncorresponds to the global minimum in the Born-Oppenheimer surface of the\nphosphorus sulfide monolayers with 2:3 stoichiometries. It is a wide band gap\n(4.55 eV) semiconductor with P-S {\\sigma} bonds. The electronic properties of\nP2S3 structure can be modulated by stacking into multilayer P2S3 structures,\nforming P2S3 nanoribbons or rolling into P2S3 nanotubes, expanding its\npotential applications for the emerging field of 2D electronics.\n", "  We consider Majorana fermion stabilizer codes with small number of modes and\ndistance. We give an upper bound on the number of logical qubits for distance\n$4$ codes, and we construct Majorana fermion codes similar to the classical\nHamming code that saturate this bound. We perform numerical studies and find\nother distance $4$ and $6$ codes that we conjecture have the largest possible\nnumber of logical qubits for the given number of physical Majorana modes. Some\nof these codes have more logical qubits than any Majorana fermion code derived\nfrom a qubit stabilizer code.\n", "  Refractory organic compounds formed in molecular clouds are among the\nbuilding blocks of the solar system objects and could be the precursors of\norganic matter found in primitive meteorites and cometary materials. However,\nlittle is known about the evolutionary pathways of molecular cloud organics\nfrom dense molecular clouds to planetary systems. In this study, we focus on\nthe evolution of the morphological and viscoelastic properties of molecular\ncloud refractory organic matter. We found that the organic residue,\nexperimentally synthesized at about 10 K from UV-irradiated H2O-CH3OH-NH3 ice,\nchanged significantly in terms of its nanometer- to micrometer-scale morphology\nand viscoelastic properties after UV irradiation at room temperature. The dose\nof this irradiation was equivalent to that experienced after short residence in\ndiffuse clouds (equal or less than 10,000 years) or irradiation in outer\nprotoplanetary disks. The irradiated organic residues became highly porous and\nmore rigid and formed amorphous nanospherules. These nanospherules are\nmorphologically similar to organic nanoglobules observed in the least-altered\nchondrites, chondritic porous interplanetary dust particles, and cometary\nsamples, suggesting that irradiation of refractory organics could be a possible\nformation pathway for such nanoglobules. The storage modulus (elasticity) of\nphoto-irradiated organic residues is about 100 MPa irrespective of vibrational\nfrequency, a value that is lower than the storage moduli of minerals and ice.\nDust grains coated with such irradiated organics would therefore stick together\nefficiently, but growth to larger grains might be suppressed due to an increase\nin aggregate brittleness caused by the strong connections between grains.\n", "  We provide a short review of Courant algebroids and graded symplectic\nmanifolds and show how different Courant algebroids emerge from double field\ntheory. Fluxes of double field theory and their Bianchi identities are\nformulated by using pre-QP-manifolds. We stress the relation of the Poisson\nCourant algebroid with R-flux as a solution of the double field theory section\ncondition.\n", "  In this work, we construct the logical framework of the Poincar\\'e gauge\ngravity cosmology based on five postulations, and introduce the modified\nredshift relation within this framework. Then we solve a system with quadratic\naction and some other assumptions to get an analytic solution on background\nlevel. The evolution of the Universe on background can be reproduced from this\nsolution without hypothesizing dark energy. Further, we use the type Ia\nsupernova data set JLA to test the effect of the modified redshift relation\nunder the constraints of system parameters. The results show that the\nconstraint on some parameters are compact.\n", "  When studying the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction with a RF accelerator, it is difficult\nto define the precise energy of the beam and its energy distribution, which\ntogether fully define the beam, for our purpose. What we do know is the\ndifference between two given energies. We resolve this problem by finding a\nreference energy and then finding another energy by examining the data,\nrelative to the reference energy. From the difference between them we can\napproximate the energy distribution for a given energy, and since we know the\nenergy threshold of the reaction (E_threshold for 7Li(p,n)7Be is about\n1880.4-1880.8 (keV)) we can calibrate the beam energy. We then determine the\nenergy which produce the maximum yield derivative as the reference and record\nthe energy whose neutron yield is 5% of the reference energy. The data is\ncollected by simulating this reaction using SimLit. Since this is a simulation\nwe know the real energy distribution so we make a linear fit for energy\ndistribution as function of energy difference. We tested the theory on\nexperimental data for which we approximate the energy distribution by other\nmeans, and found our new method to be accurate and satisfactory for our needs.\n", "  The local electronic and atomic structures of the high-quality single crystal\nof SrFeO3-{delta} ({delta}~0.19) were studied using temperature-dependent x-ray\nabsorption and valence-band photoemission spectroscopy (VB-PES) to investigate\nthe origin of anisotropic resistivity in the ab-plane and along the c-axis\nclose to the region of thermal hysteresis (near temperature for susceptibility\nmaximum, Tm~78 K). All experiments herein were conducted during warming and\ncooling processes. The Fe L3,2-edge X-ray linear dichrois results show that\nduring cooling from room temperature to below the transition temperature, the\nunoccupied Fe 3d eg states remain in persistently out-of-plane 3d3z2-r2\norbitals. In contrast, in the warming process below the transition temperature,\nthey change from 3d3z2-r2 to in-plane 3dx2-y2 orbitals. The nearest-neighbor\n(NN) Fe-O bond lengths also exhibit anisotropic behavior in the ab-plane and\nalong the c-axis below Tm. The anisotropic NN Fe-O bond lengths and\nDebye-Waller factors stabilize the in-plane Fe 3dx2-y2 and out-of-plane\n3d3z2-r2 orbitals during warming and cooling, respectively. Additionally, a\nVB-PES study further confirms that a relative band gap opens at low temperature\nin both the ab-plane and along the c-axis, providing the clear evidence of the\ncharge-density-wave nature of SrFeO3-{delta} ({delta}~ 0.19) single crystal.\n", "  Quantum coherence as an important quantum resource plays a key role in\nquantum theory. In this paper, using entropy-based measures, we investigate the\nrelations between quantum correlated coherence, which is the coherence between\nsubsystems [K. C. Tan, H. Kwon, C. Y. Park, and H. Jeong, Phys. Rev. A 94,\n022329 (2016)], and two main kinds of quantum correlations as defined by\nquantum discord as well as quantum entanglement. In particular, we show that\nquantum discord and quantum entanglement can be well characterized by quantum\ncorrelated coherence. Moreover, we prove that the entanglement measure\nformulated by quantum correlated coherence is lower and upper bounded by the\nrelative entropy of entanglement and the entanglement of formation,\nrespectively, and equal to the relative entropy of entanglement for maximally\ncorrelated states.\n", "  Quantum information processing shows advantages in many tasks, including\nquantum communication and computation, comparing to its classical counterpart.\nThe essence of quantum processing lies on the fundamental difference between\nclassical and quantum states. For a physical system, the coherent superposition\non a computational basis is different from the statistical mixture of states in\nthe same basis. Such coherent superposition endows the possibility of\ngenerating true random numbers, realizing parallel computing, and other\nclassically impossible tasks such as quantum Bernoulli factory. Considering a\nsystem that consists of multiple parts, the coherent superposition that exists\nnonlocally on different systems is called entanglement. By properly\nmanipulating entanglement, it is possible to realize computation and simulation\ntasks that are intractable with classical means. Investigating quantumness,\ncoherent superposition, and entanglement can shed light on the original of\nquantum advantages and lead to the design of new quantum protocols.\n  This thesis mainly focuses on the interplay between quantumness and two\ninformation tasks, randomness generation and selftesting quantum information\nprocessing. We discuss how quantumness can be used to generate randomness and\nshow that randomness can in turn be used to quantify quantumness. In addition,\nwe introduce the Bernoulli factory problem and present the quantum advantage\nwith only coherence in both theory and experiment. Furthermore, we show a\nmethod to witness entanglement that is independent of the realization of the\nmeasurement. We also investigate randomness requirements in selftesting tasks\nand propose a random number generation scheme that is independent of the\nrandomness source.\n", "  The needs for efficient heat removal and superior thermal conduction in\nnano/micro devices have triggered tremendous studies in low-dimensional\nmaterials with high thermal conductivity. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is\nbelieved to be one of the candidates for thermal management and heat\ndissipation due to its novel physical properties, i.e. thermal conductor and\nelectrical insulator. Here we reported interfacial thermal resistance between\nfew-layer h-BN and its silicon oxide substrate using differential 3 omega\nmethod. The measured interfacial thermal resistance is around ~1.6*10-8 m2K/W\nfor monolayer h-BN and ~3.4*10-8 m2K/W for 12.8nm-thick h-BN in metal/h-BN/SiO2\ninterfaces. Our results suggest that the voids and gaps between substrate and\nthick h-BN flakes limit the interfacial thermal conduction. This work provides\na deeper understanding of utilizing h-BN flake as lateral heat spreader in\nelectronic and optoelectronic nano/micro devices with further miniaturization\nand integration.\n", "  In this article, we briefly review the recent progress on collective flow and\nhydrodynamics in large and small systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC),\nwhich includes the following topics: extracting the QGP viscosity from the flow\ndata, initial state fluctuations and final state correlations in 2.76 A TeV\nPb--Pb collisions, correlations and collective flow in high energy p--Pb and\np--p collisions.\n", "  In mean-field theory, the non-local state of fluid molecules can be taken\ninto account using a statistical method. The molecular model combined with a\ndensity expansion in Taylor series of the fourth order yields an internal\nenergy value relevant to the fourth-gradient model, and the equation of\nisother-mal motions takes then density's spatial derivatives into account for\nwaves travelling in both liquid and vapour phases. At equilibrium, the equation\nof the density profile across interfaces is more precise than the Cahn and\nHilliard equation, and near the fluid's critical-point, the density profile\nverifies an Extended Fisher-Kolmogorov equation, allowing kinks, which\nconverges towards the Cahn-Hillard equation when approaching the critical\npoint. Nonetheless, we also get pulse waves oscillating and generating critical\nopalescence.\n", "  The quartet condensation model (QCM) is extended for the treatment of\nisovector and isoscalar pairing in odd-odd N=Z nuclei. In the extended QCM\napproach the lowest states of isospin T=1 and T=0 in odd-odd nuclei are\ndescribed variationally by trial functions composed by a proton-neutron pair\nappended to a condensate of 4-body operators. The latter are taken as a linear\nsuperposition of an isovector quartet, built by two isovector pairs coupled to\nthe total isospin T=0, and two collective isoscalar pairs. In all pairs the\nnucleons are distributed in time-reversed single-particle states of axial\nsymmetry. The accuracy of the trial functions is tested for realistic pairing\nHamiltonians and odd-odd N=Z nuclei with the valence nucleons moving above the\ncores $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ca and $^{100}$Sn. It is shown that the extended QCM\napproach is able to predict with high accuracy the energies of the lowest T=0\nand T=1 states. The present calculations indicate that in these states the\nisovector and the isoscalar pairing correlations coexist together, with the\nformer playing a dominant role.\n", "  The present study focuses on the optical properties of functionalized\nsurfaces and how the surface geometry impacts them. Physical measurements of\nreflected light are required to understand the visual aspect of such surfaces.\nBidirectional Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) is evaluated in order to\nidentify and understand physical effects induced by different surface\nfunctionalization. BRDF measurements of high angular resolution allow us to\nobserve diffraction phenomenon at an unusual scale. Experimental results were\ncompared to theoretical calculation, and then diffraction effect was confirmed.\nThis study stresses that diffractive phenomenon could have an impact on visual\naspect even for simple pattern geometry. In the same way, if more complex\nperiodic patterns are considered, as multistate periodicity pattern for\nexample, it could rise to important modification of surface visual aspect.\n", "  A new approach is shown, which estimates active grid wake features and\nenables to generate specific dynamically changing flow fields in a wind tunnel\nby means of an active grid. For example, measurements from free field can be\nreproduced in a wind tunnel. Here, the approach is explained and applied.\nMoreover, the approach is validated with wind tunnel measurements, in terms of\ntime series and stochastic features. Thus, possibilities and limitations become\nobvious. We conclude that this new active grid wake estimating approach deepens\nthe knowledge about specific flow modulations and shows new working ranges of\nactive grids.\n", "  Large responses of ecosystems to small changes in the conditions--regime\nshifts--are of great interest and importance. In spatially extended ecosystems,\nthese shifts may be local or global. Using empirical data and mathematical\nmodeling, we investigated the dynamics of the Namibian fairy circle ecosystem\nas a case study of regime shifts in a pattern-forming ecosystem. Our results\nprovide new support, based on the dynamics of the ecosystem, for the view of\nfairy circles as a self-organization phenomenon driven by water-vegetation\ninteractions. The study further suggests that fairy circle birth and death\nprocesses correspond to spatially confined transitions between alternative\nstable states. Cascades of such transitions, possible in various\npattern-forming systems, result in gradual rather than abrupt regime shifts.\n", "  Many microbial systems are known to actively reshape their proteomes in\nresponse to changes in growth conditions induced e.g. by nutritional stress or\nantibiotics. Part of the re-allocation accounts for the fact that, as the\ngrowth rate is limited by targeting specific metabolic activities, cells simply\nrespond by fine-tuning their proteome to invest more resources into the\nlimiting activity (i.e. by synthesizing more proteins devoted to it). However,\nthis is often accompanied by an overall re-organization of metabolism, aimed at\nimproving the growth yield under limitation by re-wiring resource through\ndifferent pathways. While both effects impact proteome composition, the latter\nunderlies a more complex systemic response to stress. By focusing on E. coli's\n`acetate switch', we use mathematical modeling and a re-analysis of empirical\ndata to show that the transition from a predominantly fermentative to a\npredominantly respirative metabolism in carbon-limited growth results from the\ntrade-off between maximizing the growth yield and minimizing its costs in terms\nof required the proteome share. In particular, E. coli's metabolic phenotypes\nappear to be Pareto-optimal for these objective functions over a broad range of\ndilutions.\n", "  A laboratory measurement of the $\\alpha$-decay half-life of $^{190}$Pt has\nbeen performed using a low background Frisch grid ionisation chamber. A total\namount of 216.60(17) mg of natural platinum has been measured for 75.9 days.\nThe resulting half-life is $(4.97\\pm0.16)\\times 10^{11}$ years, with a total\nuncertainty of 3.2%. This number is in good agreement with the half-life\nobtained using the geological comparison method.\n", "  Brain CT has become a standard imaging tool for emergent evaluation of brain\ncondition, and measurement of midline shift (MLS) is one of the most important\nfeatures to address for brain CT assessment. We present a simple method to\nestimate MLS and propose a new alternative parameter to MLS: the ratio of MLS\nover the maximal width of intracranial region (MLS/ICWMAX). Three neurosurgeons\nand our automated system were asked to measure MLS and MLS/ICWMAX in the same\nsets of axial CT images obtained from 41 patients admitted to ICU under\nneurosurgical service. A weighted midline (WML) was plotted based on individual\npixel intensities, with higher weighted given to the darker portions. The MLS\ncould then be measured as the distance between the WML and ideal midline (IML)\nnear the foramen of Monro. The average processing time to output an automatic\nMLS measurement was around 10 seconds. Our automated system achieved an overall\naccuracy of 90.24% when the CT images were calibrated automatically, and\nperformed better when the calibrations of head rotation were done manually\n(accuracy: 92.68%). MLS/ICWMAX and MLS both gave results in same confusion\nmatrices and produced similar ROC curve results. We demonstrated a simple, fast\nand accurate automated system of MLS measurement and introduced a new parameter\n(MLS/ICWMAX) as a good alternative to MLS in terms of estimating the degree of\nbrain deformation, especially when non-DICOM images (e.g. JPEG) are more easily\naccessed.\n", "  Dense coding with non-maximally entangled states has been investigated in\nmany different scenarios. We revisit this problem for protocols adopting the\nstandard encoding scheme. In this case, the set of possible classical messages\ncannot be perfectly distinguished due to the non-orthogonality of the quantum\nstates carrying them. So far, the decoding process has been approached in two\nways: (i) The message is always inferred, but with an associated (minimum)\nerror; (ii) the message is inferred without error, but only sometimes; in case\nof failure, nothing else is done. Here, we generalize on these approaches and\npropose novel optimal probabilistic decoding schemes. The first uses\nquantum-state separation to increase the distinguishability of the messages\nwith an optimal success probability. This scheme is shown to include (i) and\n(ii) as special cases and continuously interpolate between them, which enables\nthe decoder to trade-off between the level of confidence desired to identify\nthe received messages and the success probability for doing so. The second\nscheme, called multistage decoding, applies only for qudits ($d$-level quantum\nsystems with $d>2$) and consists of further attempts in the state\nidentification process in case of failure in the first one. We show that this\nscheme is advantageous over (ii) as it increases the mutual information between\nthe sender and receiver.\n", "  We study realizations of Lie algebras by vector fields. A correspondence\nbetween classification of transitive local realizations and classification of\nsubalgebras is generalized to the case of regular local realizations. A\nreasonable classification problem for general realizations is rigorously\nformulated and an algorithm for construction of such classification is\npresented.\n", "  Following the B. Hiley belief that unresolved problems of conventional\nquantum mechanics could be the result of a wrong mathematical structure, an\nalternative basic structure is suggested. Critical part of the structure is\nmodification of the sense of commonly used terms state, observable, measurement\ngiving them a clear unambiguous definition. This concrete definition, along\nwith using of variable complex plane, is quite natural in geometric algebra\nterms. It helps to establish a feasible language for the area of quantum\ncomputing. The suggested approach is used then in the fiber optics quantum\ninformation processing scenario.\n", "  New physics coupling to the Higgs sector of the Standard Model can lead to\ndangerously large corrections to the Higgs mass. We investigate this problem in\nthe type II seesaw model for neutrino mass, where a weak scalar triplet is\nintroduced. The interplay of direct and indirect constraints on the type II\nseesaw model with its contribution to the Higgs mass is analyzed. The focus\nlies on testable triplet masses and (sub) eV-scale triplet vacuum expectation\nvalues. We identify scenarios that are testable in collider and/or lepton\nflavor violation experiments, while satisfying the Higgs naturalness criterion.\n", "  The work provides an overview on some recent advances in the area of quantum\nthermodynamics and quantum heat engines. A particular emphasis is put on the\npossibility of constructing finite time quantum cycles and adiabatic shortcuts.\nWe discuss in details the particular quantum heat engines operating with a\nmultiferroic working substance.\n", "  Due to the proliferation of online social networks (OSNs), users find\nthemselves participating in multiple OSNs. These users leave their activity\ntraces as they maintain friendships and interact with other users in these\nOSNs. In this work, we analyze how users maintain friendship in multiple OSNs\nby studying users who have accounts in both Twitter and Instagram.\nSpecifically, we study the similarity of a user's friendship and the evenness\nof friendship distribution in multiple OSNs. Our study shows that most users in\nTwitter and Instagram prefer to maintain different friendships in the two OSNs,\nkeeping only a small clique of common friends in across the OSNs. Based upon\nour empirical study, we conduct link prediction experiments to predict missing\nfriendship links in multiple OSNs using the neighborhood features, neighborhood\nfriendship maintenance features and cross-link features. Our link prediction\nexperiments shows that un- supervised methods can yield good accuracy in\npredicting links in one OSN using another OSN data and the link prediction\naccuracy can be further improved using supervised method with friendship\nmaintenance and others measures as features.\n", "  Optimum suppression of higher order modes in single-ring hollow-core photonic\ncrystal fibers (SR-PCFs) occurs when the capillary-to-core diameter ratio d/D =\n0.68. Here we report that, in SR-PCFs with sub-optimal values of d/D,\nhigher-order mode suppression can be recovered by spinning the preform during\nfiber drawing, thus introducing a continuous helical twist. This geometrically\nincreases the effective axial propagation constant (initially too low) of the\nLP01-like modes of the capillaries surrounding the core, enabling robust\nsingle-mode operation. The effect is explored by means of extensive numerical\nmodeling, an analytical model and a series of experiments. Prism-assisted\nside-coupling is used to investigate the losses and near-field patterns of\nindividual fiber modes in both the straight and twisted cases. More than 12\ndB/m improvement in higher order mode suppression is achieved experimentally in\na twisted PCF. The measurements also show that the higher order mode profiles\nchange with twist rate, as predicted by numerical simulations. Helical twisting\noffers an additional tool for achieving effectively endlessly single-mode\noperation in hollow-core SR-PCFs.\n", "  We employ optimal renormalization group analysis to semi-leptonic\n$\\tau$-decay polarization functions and extract the strange quark mass from\ntheir moments measured by the ALEPH and OPAL collaborations. The optimal\nrenormalization group makes use of the renormalization group equation of a\ngiven perturbation series which then leads to closed form sum of all the\nrenormalization group-accessible logarithms which have reduced scale\ndependence. Using the latest theoretical inputs we find $m_s(2{\\rm GeV}) =\n106.70 \\pm 9.36~{\\rm MeV}$ and $m_s(2{\\rm GeV}) = 74.47 \\pm 7.77~{\\rm MeV}$ for\nALEPH and OPAL data respectively.\n", "  Subwavelength Mie resonators have enabled new classes of optical antennas1-4,\nphotodetectors5,6, antireflection coatings7, and magnetic mirrors8 and can act\nas the basic meta-atoms constituents of low-loss dielectric\nmetasurfaces2-4,8-10. In any application, tunable Mie resonances are key to\nachieving dynamic and reconfigurable operation11,12. Sub-linewidth tuning has\nbeen achieved via coupling to liquid crystals13, ultrafast free-carrier\ninjection14,15,16,17, stretchable substrates18 and with phase change\nmaterials19. Here, we demonstrate ultra-wide dynamic tuning of PbTe Mie\nresonators fabricated via both laser ablation and a novel solution-processing\napproach. Taking advantage of the extremely large thermo-optic (TO) coefficient\nand high refractive index of PbTe, we demonstrate high-quality factor\nMie-resonances that are tuned by several linewidths with temperature modulation\nas small as {\\Delta}T~10K. When combined into metasurface arrays these effects\ncan be exploited in ultra-narrow active notch filers and metasurface phase\nshifters that require only few-kelvin modulation. These findings demonstrate\nthe enabling potential of thermo-optically tunable PbTe meta-atoms and\nmetasurfaces.\n", "  Among all experimental observations of cuprate physics, the\nmetal-insulator-crossover (MIC), seen in the pseudogap (PG) region of the\ntemperature-doping phase diagram of copper-oxides under a strong magnetic\nfield, when the superconductivity is suppressed, is most likely the most\nintriguing one. Since it was expected that the PG-normal state for these\nmaterials, as for conventional superconductors, is conducting. This MIC,\nrevealed in such phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz\nratio, insulator resistivity boundary, nonlinear entropy, resistivity\ntemperature upturn, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and\nFermi pockets, unambiguously indicates on the insulating normal state, from\nwhich the high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) appears. In the present work\n(article I), we discuss the MIC phenomena mentioned in the title of article.\nThe second work (article II) will be devoted to discussion of other listed\nabove MIC phenomena and also to interpretation of the recent observations in\nthe hidden magnetic order and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments\nspin and charge fluctuations as the intra PG and HTS pair ones. We find that\nall these MIC (called in the literature as non-Fermi liquid) phenomena can be\nobtained within the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model,\nwhich we recently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of single fermions into\nthose of single bosons. We show that this MIC originates from bosons of Coulomb\ntwo liquid model and fermions, whose origin is these bosons. At an increase of\ndoping up to critical value or temperature up to PG boundary temperature, the\nboson system undegoes bosonic insulator - bosonic metal - fermionic metal\ntransitions.\n"]}
