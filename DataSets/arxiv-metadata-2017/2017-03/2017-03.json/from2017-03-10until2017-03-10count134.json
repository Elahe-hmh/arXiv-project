We review of some algebraic\nproperties of generalized quaternions and operations between them and then show\ntheir relation with the rotation matrix.\n", "  By considering a spatial curve in a Euclidean space, we use its components,\ntogether with attaining a cyclic matrix, to show that this matrix is homothetic\ntoo and is in correspondence with a homothetic motion. Furthermore, if the\ncurve lies on a unit sphere, then the motion is a spherical cyclic motion.\n", "  This paper continues the study of paragrassmann algebras begun in Part I with\nthe definition and analysis of Toeplitz operators in the associated holomorphic\nSegal-Bargmann space. These are defined in the usual way as multiplication by a\nsymbol followed by the projection defined by the reproducing kernel. These are\nnon-trivial examples of spaces with Toeplitz operators whose symbols are not\nfunctions and which themselves are not spaces of functions.\n", "  We construct a family of pairwise commuting operators such that the Jack\nsymmetric functions of infinitely many variables $x_1,x_2,...$ are their\neigenfunctions. These operators are defined as limits at $N\\to\\infty$ of\nrenormalised Sekiguchi-Debiard operators acting on symmetric polynomials in the\nvariables $x_1,...,x_N$. They are differential operators in terms of the power\nsum variables $p_n=x_1^n+x_2^n+...$ and we compute their symbols by using the\nJack reproducing kernel. Our result yields a hierarchy of commuting\nHamiltonians for the quantum Calogero-Sutherland model with infinite number of\nbosonic particles in terms of the collective variables of the model. Our result\nalso yields explicit shift operators for the Jack symmetric functions.\n", "  We construct a family of pairwise commuting operators such that the Macdonald\nsymmetric functions of infinitely many variables $x_1,x_2,...$ and of two\nparameters $q,t$ are their eigenfunctions. These operators are defined as\nlimits at $N\\to\\infty$ of renormalised Macdonald operators acting on symmetric\npolynomials in the variables $x_1,...,x_N$. They are differential operators in\nterms of the power sum variables $p_n=x_1^n+x_2^n+...$ and we compute their\nsymbols by using the Macdonald reproducing kernel. We express these symbols in\nterms of the Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions of the variables\n$x_1,x_2,...$. Our result also yields elementary step operators for the\nMacdonald symmetric functions.\n", "  We propose to use the ensemble Kalman smoother (EnKS) as linear least squares\nsolver in the Gauss-Newton method for the large nonlinear least squares in\nincremental 4DVAR. The ensemble approach is naturally parallel over the\nensemble members and no tangent or adjoint operators are needed. Further,\nadding a regularization term results in replacing the Gauss-Newton method,\nwhich may diverge, by^M the Levenberg-Marquardt method, which is known to be\nconvergent. The regularization is implemented efficiently as an additional\nobservation in the EnKS.\n", "  In this work, we argue that the $\\alpha'\\to 0$ limit of closed string theory\nscattering amplitudes is a tropical limit. The motivation is to develop a\ntechnology to systematize the extraction of Feynman graphs from string theory\namplitudes at higher genus. An important technical input from tropical geometry\nis the use of tropical theta functions with characteristics to rigorously\nderive the worldline limit of the worldsheet propagator. This enables us to\nperform a non-trivial computation at two loops: we derive the tropical form of\nthe integrand of the genus-two four-graviton type II string amplitude, which\nmatches the direct field theory computations. At the mathematical level, this\nlimit is an implementation of the correspondence between the moduli space of\nRiemann surfaces and the tropical moduli space.\n", "  A hierarchy of pairwise commuting Hamiltonians for the quantum periodic\nBenjamin-Ono equation is constructed by using the Lax matrix. The eigenvectors\nof these Hamiltonians are Jack symmetric functions of infinitely many variables\n$x_1,x_2,\\ldots$. This construction provides explicit expressions for the\nHamiltonians in terms of the power sum symmetric functions\n$p_n=x_1^n+x_2^n+\\cdots$ and is based on our recent results from [Comm. Math.\nPhys. 324 (2013), 831-849, arXiv:1212.2781].\n", "  Using the Lax operator formalism, we construct a family of pairwise commuting\noperators such that the Macdonald symmetric functions of infinitely many\nvariables and of two parameters $q,t$ are their eigenfunctions. We express our\noperators in terms of the Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions of the same\nvariables and of the parameter $t$ corresponding to the partitions with one\npart only. Our expression is based on the notion of Baker-Akhiezer function.\n", "  In this paper, we present the guiding-center transformation of the\nradiation-reaction force of a classical point charge traveling in a nonuniform\nmagnetic field. The transformation is valid as long as the gyroradius of the\ncharged particles is much smaller than the magnetic field nonuniformity length\nscale, so that the guiding-center Lie-transform method is applicable.\nElimination of the gyromotion time scale from the radiation-reaction force is\nobtained with the Poisson bracket formalism originally introduced by [A. J.\nBrizard, Phys. Plasmas 11 4429 (2004)], where it was used to eliminate the fast\ngyromotion from the Fokker-Planck collision operator. The formalism presented\nhere is applicable to the motion of charged particles in planetary magnetic\nfields as well as in magnetic confinement fusion plasmas, where the\ncorresponding so-called synchrotron radiation can be detected. Applications of\nthe guiding-center radiation-reaction force include tracing of charged particle\norbits in complex magnetic fields as well as kinetic description of plasma when\nthe loss of energy and momentum due to radiation plays an important role, e.g.,\nfor runaway electron dynamics in tokamaks.\n", "  We show that finiteness of the Lorentzian distance is equivalent to the\nexistence of generalised time functions with gradient uniformly bounded away\nfrom light cones. To derive this result we introduce new techniques to\nconstruct and manipulate achronal sets. As a consequence of these techniques we\nobtain a functional description of the Lorentzian distance extending the work\nof Franco and Moretti.\n", "  We review theoretical foundations and some recent progress related to the\nquest of controlling the motion of charge carriers with intense laser pulses\nand optical waveforms. The tools and techniques of attosecond science enable\ndetailed investigations of a relatively unexplored regime of nondestructive\nstrong-field effects. Such extremely nonlinear effects may be utilized to steer\nelectron motion with precisely controlled optical fields and switch electric\ncurrents at a rate that is far beyond the capabilities of conventional\nelectronics.\n", "  Runaway electrons, which are generated in a plasma where the induced electric\nfield exceeds a certain critical value, can reach very high energies in the MeV\nrange. For such energetic electrons, radiative losses will contribute\nsignificantly to the momentum space dynamics. Under certain conditions, due to\nradiative momentum losses, a non-monotonic feature - a \"bump\" - can form in the\nrunaway electron tail, creating a potential for bump-on-tail-type instabilities\nto arise. Here we study the conditions for the existence of the bump. We derive\nan analytical threshold condition for bump appearance and give an approximate\nexpression for the minimum energy at which the bump can appear. Numerical\ncalculations are performed to support the analytical derivations.\n", "  The problem of cosmological production of gravitational waves is discussed in\nthe framework of an expanding, spatially homogeneous and isotropic FRW type\nUniverse with time-evolving vacuum energy density. The gravitational wave\nequation is established and its modified time-dependent part is analytically\nresolved for different epochs in the case of a flat geometry. Unlike the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology (no interacting vacuum), we show that\ngravitational waves are produced in the radiation era even in the context of\ngeneral relativity. We also show that for all values of the free parameter, the\nhigh frequency modes are damped out even faster than in the standard cosmology\nboth in the radiation and matter-vacuum dominated epoch. The formation of the\nstochastic background of gravitons and the remnant power spectrum generated at\ndifferent cosmological eras are also explicitly evaluated. It is argued that\nmeasurements of the CMB polarization (B-modes) and its comparison with the\nrigid $\\Lambda$CDM model plus the inflationary paradigm may become a crucial\ntest for dynamical dark energy models in the near future.\n", "  Hyperbolic metamaterials were originally introduced to overcome the\ndiffraction limit of optical imaging. Soon thereafter it was realized that they\ndemonstrate a number of novel phenomena resulting from the broadband singular\nbehavior of their density of photonic states. These novel phenomena and\napplications include microscopy, stealth technologies, enhanced\nquantum-electrodynamic effects, thermal hyperconductivity, superconductivity,\nand interesting gravitation theory analogues. Here we describe the behaviour of\ncobalt nanoparticle-based ferrofluid in the presence of an external magnetic\nfield, and demonstrate that it forms a self-assembled hyperbolic metamaterial,\nwhich may be described as an effective 3D Minkowski spacetime for extraordinary\nphotons. Moreover, such photons perceive thermal gradients in the ferrofluid as\nanalogue of gravitational field, which obeys the Newton law. If the magnetic\nfield is not strong enough, the effective Minkowski spacetime gradually melts\nunder the influence of thermal fluctuations. On the other hand, it may restore\nitself if the magnetic field is increased back to its original value. Direct\nmicroscopic visualization of such a Minkowski spacetime melting/crystallization\nis presented, which is somewhat similar to hypothesized formation of the\nMinkowski spacetime in loop quantum cosmology and may mimic various\ncosmological Big Bang scenarios.\n", "  We construct the component action of the system including an ordinary matter\nand a nilpotent multiplet in global and local supersymmetric framework. The\nhigher dimensional operators of not only Goldstino but also matter and\ngravitino fields are shown, which appear due to nonlinearly realized\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  One intriguing fingerprint of surface states in topological insulators is the\nAharonov-Bohm effect in magnetoconductivity of nanowires. We show that surface\nstates in nanowires of Dirac materials (bismuth, bismuth antimony, and lead tin\nchalcogenides) being in non-topological phase, exhibit the same effect as\namendment to magnetoconductivity of the bulk states. We consider a simple model\nof a cylindrical nanowire, which is described by the 3D Dirac equation with a\ngeneral $T$-invariant boundary condition. The boundary condition is determined\nby a single phenomenological parameter whose sign defines topological-like and\nnon-topological surface states. The non-topological surface states emerge\noutside the gap. In longitudinal magnetic field $B$ they lead to Aharonov-Bohm\namendment for the density of states and correspondingly for conductivity of the\nnanowire. The phase of these magnetooscillations increases with $B$ from $\\pi$\nto $2\\pi$.\n", "  This study distinguishes the weak fairness property from the strong fairness\nproperty which is necessary in the quantum key agreement (QKA) and shows that\nmost of the existing QKAs cannot achieve the strong fairness property with a\nkey manipulation problem.To solve this problem, a model which describes the way\nto design a QKA with the strong fairness property is proposed. Based on the\nmodel, an example QKA is presented. Security analyses show that the proposed\nQKA is effective to resist not only outsider's eavesdropping attack but also\ninsider's key manipulation.\n", "  Various soft materials share some common features, such as significant\nentropic effect, large fluctuations, sensitivity to thermodynamic conditions,\nand mesoscopic characteristic spatial and temporal scales. However, no\nquantitative definitions have yet been provided for soft matter, and the\nintrinsic mechanisms leading to their common features are unclear. In this\nwork, from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, we show that soft matter\nworks in the vicinity of a specific thermodynamic state named moderate point,\nat which entropy and enthalpy contributions among substates along a certain\norder parameter are well balanced or have a minimal difference. Around the\nmoderate point, the order parameter fluctuation, the associated response\nfunction, and the spatial correlation length maximize, which explains the large\nfluctuation, the sensitivity to thermodynamic conditions, and mesoscopic\nspatial and temporal scales of soft matter, respectively. Possible applications\nto switching chemical bonds or allosteric biomachines determining their best\nworking temperatures are also discussed.\n", "  Let $Q$ be a smooth compact orientable 3--manifold with smooth boundary\n$\\partial Q$. Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the set of exact 2--forms $B\\in\\Omega^2(Q)$\nsuch that $j_{\\partial Q}^*B=0$, where $j_{\\partial Q}:{\\partial Q}\\to Q$ is\nthe inclusion map. The group $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathrm{Diff}_0(Q)$ of\nself-diffeomorphisms of $Q$ isotopic to the identity acts on the set\n$\\mathcal{B}$ by $\\mathcal{D}\\times\\mathcal{B}\\to\\mathcal{B}$, $(h,B)\\mapsto\nh^*B$. Let $\\mathcal{B}^\\circ$ be the set of 2--forms $B\\in\\mathcal{B}$ without\nzeros. We prove that every $\\mathcal{D}$--invariant functional\n$I:\\mathcal{B}^\\circ\\to\\mathbb{R}$ having a regular and continuous derivative\nwith respect to the $C^1$--topology can be locally (and, if $Q=M\\times S^1$\nwith $\\partial Q\\ne\\varnothing$, globally on the set of all 2--forms\n$B\\in\\mathcal{B}^\\circ$ admitting a cross-section isotopic to $M\\times\\{*\\}$)\nexpressed in terms of the helicity.\n", "  We numerically study the impact of impulse stops on pedestrian flow for a\nstraight corridor with multiple attractions. The impulse stop is simulated by\nthe switching behavior model, a function of the social influence strength and\nthe number of attendees near the attraction. When the pedestrian influx is low,\none can observe a stable flow where attendees make a complete stop at an\nattraction and then leave the attraction after a certain amount of time. When\nthe pedestrian influx is high, an unstable flow is observed for strong social\ninfluence. In the unstable flow, attendees near the attraction are crowded out\nfrom the clusters by others due to the interpersonal repulsion. The expelled\npedestrians impede the pedestrian traffic between the left and right boundaries\nof the corridor. These collective patterns of pedestrian flow are summarized in\na schematic phase diagram.\n", "  We predict that a direct bandgap semiconductor (GaAs) resonantly excited by a\nstrong ultrashort laser pulse exhibits a novel regime: kicked anharmonic Rabi\noscillations (KARO). In this regime, Rabi oscillations are strongly coupled to\nintraband motion, and interband transitions mainly take place during short\ntimes when electrons pass near the Brillouin zone center where electron\npopulations undergo very rapid changes. Asymmetry of the residual population\ndistribution induces an electric current controlled by the carrier-envelope\nphase. The predicted effects are experimentally observable using photoemission\nand terahertz spectroscopies.\n", "  We have evaluated the electromagnetic spectral function and its spectral\nproperties by computing the one-loop photon polarization tensor in presence of\nmagnetic field, particularly in a strong field approximation compared to the\nthermal scale. When the magnetic scale is higher than the thermal scale the\nlowest Landau level (LLL) becomes effectively (1+1) dimensional strongly\ncorrelated system that provides a kinematical threshold based on the mass\nscale. Beyond this threshold the photon strikes the LLL and the spectral\nstrength starts with a high value due to the dimensional reduction and then\nfalls off with increase of the photon energy due to LLL dynamics in a strong\nfield approximation. This strongly enhances the dilepton rate over the thermal\nperturbative leading order (Born) rate at very low invariant mass. We have also\ninvestigated the electromagnetic screening by computing the Debye screening\nmass and it depends distinctively on three different scales (mass of the\nquasiquark, temperature and the magnetic field strength) of a hot magnetized\nsystem. The mass dependence of the Debye screening supports the occurrence of a\nmagnetic catalysis effect in the strong field approximation.\n", "  Light cone spreading of correlations and entanglement is a key feature of the\nnon-equilibrium quench dynamics of many-body quantum systems. First proposed\ntheoretically, it has been experimentally revealed in cold-atomic gases and it\nis expected to be a generic characteristic of any quench in systems with\nshort-range interactions and no disorder. Conversely, here we propose a\nmechanism that, through confinement of the elementary excitations, strongly\nsuppresses the light-cone spreading. Confinement is a celebrated concept in\nparticle physics, but it also exists in condensed matter systems, most notably\nin one spatial dimension where it has been experimentally observed. Our results\nare obtained for the Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal magnetic\nfield, but the proposed mechanism is of general validity since it is based on\nthe sole concept of confinement and it should be easily observed in cold atom\nexperiments.\n", "  Van der Waals like behavior of $f(R)$ AdS black holes is revisited via two\npoint correlation function, which is dual to the geodesic length in the bulk.\nThe equation of motion constrained by the boundary condition is solved\nnumerically and both the effect of boundary region size and $f(R)$ gravity are\nprobed. Moreover, an analogous specific heat related to $\\delta L$ is\nintroduced. It is shown that the $T-\\delta L$ graphs of $f(R)$ AdS black holes\nexhibit reverse van der Waals like behavior just as the $T-S$ graphs do. Free\nenergy analysis is carried out to determine the first order phase transition\ntemperature $T_*$ and the unstable branch in $T-\\delta L$ curve is removed by a\nbar $T=T_*$. It is shown that the first order phase transition temperature is\nthe same at least to the order of $10^{-10}$ for different choices of the\nparameter $b$ although the values of free energy vary with $b$. Our result\nfurther supports the former finding that charged $f(R)$ AdS black holes behave\nmuch like RN-AdS black holes. We also check the analogous equal area law\nnumerically and find that the relative errors for both the cases $\\theta_0=0.1$\nand $\\theta_0=0.2$ are small enough. The fitting functions between $ \\log\\mid T\n-T_c\\mid$ and $\\log\\mid\\delta L-\\delta L_c\\mid $ for both cases are also\nobtained. It is shown that the slope is around 3, implying that the critical\nexponent is about $2/3$. This result is in accordance with those in former\nliteratures of specific heat related to the thermal entropy or entanglement\nentropy.\n", "  We present a generalized theoretical framework for dealing with the important\nissue of dynamical mass generation in Yang-Mills theories, and, in particular,\nwith the infrared finiteness of the gluon propagators, observed in a multitude\nof recent lattice simulations. Our analysis is manifestly gauge-invariant, in\nthe sense that it preserves the transversality of the gluon self-energy, and\ngauge-independent, given that the conclusions do not depend on the choice of\nthe gauge-fixing parameter within the linear covariant gauges. The central\nconstruction relies crucially on the subtle interplay between the Abelian Ward\nidentities satisfied by the nonperturbative vertices and a special integral\nidentity that enforces a vast number of 'seagull cancellations' among the one-\nand two-loop dressed diagrams of the gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation. The key\nresult of these considerations is that the gluon propagator remains rigorously\nmassless, provided that the vertices do not contain (dynamical) massless poles.\nWhen such poles are incorporated into the vertices, under the pivotal\nrequirement of respecting the gauge symmetry of the theory, the terms\ncomprising the Ward identities conspire in such a way as to still enforce the\ntotal annihilation of all quadratic divergences, inducing, at the same time,\nresidual contributions that account for the saturation of gluon propagators in\nthe deep infrared.\n", "  Epitaxial semiconductor-superconductor hybrid materials are an excellent\nbasis for studying mesoscopic and topological superconductivity, as the\nsemiconductor inherits a hard superconducting gap while retaining tunable\ncarrier density. Here, we investigate double-quantum-dot devices made from InAs\nnanowires with a patterned epitaxial Al two-facet shell that proximitizes two\ngate-defined segments along the nanowire. We follow the evolution of mesoscopic\nsuperconductivity and charging energy in this system as a function of magnetic\nfield and voltage-tuned barriers. Inter-dot coupling is varied from strong to\nweak using side gates, and the ground state is varied between normal,\nsuperconducting, and topological regimes by applying a magnetic field. We\nidentify the topological transition by tracking the spacing between successive\ncotunneling peaks as a function of axial magnetic field and show that the\nindividual dots host weakly hybridized Majorana modes.\n", "  In the present paper Q-ball solutions in the Wick--Cutkosky model are\nexamined in detail. A remarkable feature of the Wick--Cutkosky model is that it\nadmits analytical treatment for the most part of the analysis of Q-balls, which\nallows one to use this simple model to demonstrate some peculiar properties of\nQ-balls. In particular, a method for estimating the binding energy of a Q-ball\nis proposed. This method is tested on the Wick--Cutkosky model taking into\naccount the well-known results obtained for this model earlier.\n", "  We study, both theoretically and by experiment, migration of the amplitude\nzeros within a fixed cross section of the edge-diffracted optical-vortex beam,\nwhen the screen edge performs permanent translation in the transverse plane\nfrom the beam periphery towards the axis. Generally, the amplitude zeros\n(optical-vortex cores) describe spiral-like trajectories. When the screen edge\nadvances uniformly, the motion of the amplitude zeros is not smooth and\nsometimes shows anomalously high rates, which make an impression of\ninstantaneous \"jumps\" from one position to another. We analyze the nature,\nconditions and mechanism of these jumps and show that they are associated with\nthe \"birth - annihilation\" topological reactions involving the optical vortex\ndipoles.\n", "  After a brief introduction to Heun type functions we note that the actual\nsolutions of the eigenvalue equation emerging in the calculation of the one\nloop contribution to QCD from the Belavin-Polyakov-Schwarz-Tyupkin instanton\nand the similar calculation for a Dirac particle coupled to a scalar $CP^1$\nmodel in two dimensions can be given in terms of confluent Heun equation in\ntheir original forms. These equations were previously modified to be solved by\nmore elementary functions. We also show that polynomial solutions with discrete\neigenvalues are impossible to find in the unmodified equations.\n", "  We apply the formalism of quantum estimation theory to extract information\nabout potential collapse mechanisms of the continuous spontaneous localisation\n(CSL) form. In order to estimate the strength with which the field responsible\nfor the CSL mechanism couples to massive systems, we consider the\noptomechanical interaction between a mechanical resonator and a cavity field.\nOur estimation strategy passes through the probing of either the state of the\noscillator or that of the electromagnetic field that drives its motion. In\nparticular, we concentrate on all-optical measurements, such as homodyne and\nheterodyne measurements. We also compare the performances of such strategies\nwith those of a spin-assisted optomechanical system, where the estimation of\nthe CSL parameter is performed through time-gated spin-like measurements.\n", "  Oxygen octahedral distortions including tilts/rotations, deformations and\noff-centering in (layered) perovskites play the key role in their numerous\nfunctional properties. At the polar-centrosymmetric phase boundary in\nbi-layered perovskite Ca3-xSrxTi2O7 with x~1, we found the presence of abundant\ntopological Z8 vortex-antivortex pairs, associated with four oxygen octahedral\ntilts at domains and another four different oxygen octahedral tilts at domain\nboundaries. Our discovery opens a new revenue to unveil topological defects\nassociated with various types of oxygen octahedral distortions.\n", "  Quantum metrology has been studied for a wide range of systems with\ntime-independent Hamiltonians. For systems with time-dependent Hamiltonians,\nhowever, due to the complexity of dynamics, little has been known about quantum\nmetrology. Here we investigate quantum metrology with time-dependent\nHamiltonians to bridge this gap. We obtain the optimal quantum Fisher\ninformation for parameters in time-dependent Hamiltonians, and show proper\nHamiltonian control is necessary to optimize the Fisher information. We derive\nthe optimal Hamiltonian control, which is generally adaptive, and the\nmeasurement scheme to attain the optimal Fisher information. In a minimal\nexample of a qubit in a rotating magnetic field, we find a surprising result\nthat the fundamental limit of $T^{2}$ time scaling of quantum Fisher\ninformation can be broken with time-dependent Hamiltonians, which reaches\n$T^{4}$ in estimating the rotation frequency of the field. We conclude by\nconsidering level crossings in the derivatives of the Hamiltonians, and point\nout additional control is necessary for that case.\n", "  Cold atoms coupled to photonic crystals constitute an exciting platform for\nexploring quantum many-body physics. Here we investigate the strong coupling\nbetween atomic internal (\"spin\") degrees of freedom and motion, which arises\nfrom spin-dependent forces associated with the exchange of guided photons. We\nshow that this system can realize a remarkable and extreme limit of quantum\nspin-orbital systems, where both the direct spin exchange between neighboring\nsites and the kinetic energy of the orbital motion vanish. We find that this\npreviously unexplored system has a rich phase diagram of emergent orders,\nincluding spatially dimerized spin-entangled pairs, a fluid of composite\nparticles comprised of joint spin-phonon excitations, phonon-induced N\\'eel\nordering, and a fractional magnetization plateau associated with trimer\nformation.\n", "  Dissolved manganese (Mn) is a biologically essential element, and its\noxidised form is involved in the removal of trace elements from ocean waters.\nRecently, a large number of highly accurate Mn measurements have been obtained\nin the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans as part of the GEOTRACES programme.\nThe goal of this study is to combine these new observations with\nstate-of-the-art modelling to give new insights into the main sources and\nredistribution of Mn throughout the ocean. To this end, we simulate the\ndistribution of dissolved Mn using a global-scale circulation model. This first\nmodel includes simple parameterisations to account, realistically, for the\nsources, processes and sinks of Mn in the ocean. Whereas oxidation and\n(photo)reduction, as well as aggregation and settling are parameterised in the\nmodel, biological uptake is not yet taken into account by the model. Our model\nreproduces observations accurately and provides the following insights:\n  - The high surface concentrations of manganese are caused by the combination\nof photoreduction and sources to the upper ocean. The most important sources\nare dust, then sediments, and, more locally, rivers.\n  - Results show that surface Mn in the Atlantic Ocean moves downwards into the\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water, but because of strong removal rates the Mn does not\npropagate southwards.\n  - There is a mostly homogeneous background concentration of dissolved Mn of\nabout 0.10 to 0.15 nM throughout most of the deep ocean. The model reproduces\nthis by means of a threshold on manganese oxides of 25 pM, suggesting that a\nminimal concentration of Mn is needed before aggregation and removal become\nefficient.\n  - The observed sharp hydrothermal signals are produced by assuming both a\nhigh source and a strong removal of Mn near hydrothermal vents.\n", "  A lattice version of the driven inelastic Maxwell gas is studied in one\ndimension with periodic boundary conditions. Each site $i$ of the lattice is\nassigned with a scalar `velocity', $v_i$. Nearest neighbors on the lattice\ninteract, with a rate $\\tau_c^{-1}$, according to an inelastic collision rule.\nExternal driving, occurring with a rate $\\tau_w^{-1}$, sustains a steady state\nin the system. A set of closed coupled equations for the evolution of the\nvariance and the two-point correlation is found. Steady state values of the\nvariance, as well as spatial correlation functions, are calculated. It is shown\nexactly that the correlation function decays exponentially with distance, and\nthe correlation length for a large system is determined. Furthermore, the\nspatio-temporal correlation $C(x,t)=\\langle v_i(0) v_{i+x} (t)\\rangle$ can also\nbe obtained. We find that there is an interior region $-x^* < x < x^*$, where\n$C(x,t)$ has a time-dependent form, whereas in the exterior region $|x| > x^*$,\nthe correlation function remains the same as the initial form. $C(x,t)$\nexhibits second order discontinuity at the transition points $x=\\pm x^*$ and\nthese transition points move away from the $x=0$ with a constant speed.\n", "  We time-resolve the spin-transfer-torque-induced switching in perpendicularly\nmagnetized tunnel junctions of diameters from 50 to 250 nm in the thermally\nactivated regime. When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to\nAP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be\ninterpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17\nto 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to\nAP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,\nduring which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal\noccurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a\nmonotonic increase of the device resistance. In the reverse transition (AP to\nP), several reversal paths are possible even in the smallest junctions.\nBesides, the non uniform nature of the response seems still present at\nnanoscale, with sometimes electrical signatures of strong disorder during the\nreversal. The AP to P transition is preceded by a strong instability of the AP\nstate in devices above 100 nm. The resistance becomes extremely agitated before\nswitching to P in a path yielding a slow (20-50 ns) irregular increase of the\nconductance with variability. Unreversed bubbles of 60 nm can persist a few\nmicroseconds in the largest junctions. The complexity of the AP to P switching\nis reduced but not suppressed when the junctions are downsized below 60 nm. The\ninstability of the initial AP state is no longer detected but the other\nfeatures remain. In the smallest junctions (50 nm) we occasionally observe much\nfaster (sub-1 ns) switching events. We discuss the origin of the switching\nasymmetry and its size dependence, with an emphasis on the role of the non\nuniformities of the stray field emanating from the reference layers, which\naffects the zones in which nucleation is favored.\n", "  In this article, we compare a set of Wave Front Sensors (WFS) based on\nFourier filtering technique. In particular, this study explores the \"class of\npyramidal WFS\" defined as the 4 faces pyramid WFS, all its recent variations\n(6, 8 faces, the flattened PWFS, etc.) and also some new WFSs as the flattened\ncone WFS or the 3 faces pyramid WFS. In the first part, we describe such a\nsensors class thanks to the optical parameters of the Fourier filtering mask\nand the modulation parameters. In the second part, we use the unified formalism\nto create a set of performance criteria: size of the signal on the detector,\nefficiency of incoming flux, sensitivity, linear range and chromaticity. In the\nthird part, we show the influence of the previous optical and modulation\nparameters on these performance criteria. This exhaustive study allows to know\nhow to optimize the sensor regarding to performance specifications. We show in\nparticular that the number of faces has influence on the number of pixels\nrequired to do the wave front sensing but no influence on the sensitivity and\nlinearity range. To modify these criteria, we show that the modulation radius\nand the apex angle are much more relevant. Moreover we observe that the time\nspent on edges or faces during a modulation cycle allows to adjust the\ntrade-off between sensitivity and linearity range.\n", "  In this article a topological sensitivity framework for far field detection\nof a diametrically small electromagnetic inclusion is established. The cases of\nsingle and multiple measurements of the electric far field scattering amplitude\nat a fixed frequency are taken into account. The performance of the algorithm\nis analyzed theoretically in terms of its resolution and sensitivity for\nlocating an inclusion. The stability of the framework with respect to\nmeasurement and medium noises is discussed. Moreover, the quantitative results\nfor signal-to-noise ratio are presented. A few numerical results are presented\nto illustrate the detection capabilities of the proposed framework with single\nand multiple measurements.\n", "  Most studies of disease spreading consider the underlying social network as\nobtained without the contagion, though epidemic influences people's willingness\nto contact others: A \"friendly\" contact may be turned to \"unfriendly\" to avoid\ninfection. We study the susceptible-infected disease-spreading model on signed\nnetworks, in which each edge is associated with a positive or negative sign\nrepresenting the friendly or unfriendly relation between its end nodes. In a\nsigned network, according to Heider's theory, edge signs evolve such that\nfinally a state of structural balance is achieved, corresponding to no\nfrustration in physics terms. However, the danger of infection affects the\nevolution of its edge signs. To describe the coupled problem of the sign\nevolution and disease spreading, we generalize the notion of structural balance\nby taking into account the state of the nodes. We introduce an energy function\nand carry out Monte Carlo simulations on complete networks to test the energy\nlandscape, where we find local minima corresponding to the so-called jammed\nstates. We study the effect of the ratio of initial friendly to unfriendly\nconnections on the propagation of disease. The steady state can be balanced or\na jammed state such that a coexistence occurs between susceptible and infected\nnodes in the system.\n", "  We report quantitative electrical admittance measurements of diffusive\nsuperconductor--normal-metal--superconductor (SNS) junctions at gigahertz\nfrequencies and millikelvin temperatures. The gold-palladium-based SNS\njunctions are arranged into a chain of superconducting quantum interference\ndevices. The chain is coupled strongly to a multimode microwave resonator with\na mode spacing of approximately 0.6 GHz. By measuring the resonance frequencies\nand quality factors of the resonator modes, we extract the dissipative and\nreactive parts of the admittance of the chain. We compare the phase and\ntemperature dependence of the admittance near 1 GHz to theory based on the\ntime-dependent Usadel equations. This comparison allows us to identify\nimportant discrepancies between theory and experiment that are not resolved by\nincluding inelastic scattering or elastic spin-flip scattering in the theory.\n", "  Recent breakthroughs in electrical detection and manipulation of\nantiferromagnets have opened a new avenue in the research of non-volatile\nspintronic devices. Antiparallel spin sublattices in antiferromagnets,\nproducing zero dipolar fields, lead to the insensitivity to magnetic field\nperturbations, multi-level stability, ultra-fast spin dynamics and other\nfavorable characteristics which may find utility in fields ranging from\nmagnetic memories to optical signal processing. However, the absence of a net\nmagnetic moment and the ultra-short magnetization dynamics timescales make\nantiferromagnets notoriously difficult to study by common magnetometers or\nmagnetic resonance techniques. In this paper we demonstrate the experimental\ndetermination of the Neel vector in a thin film of antiferromagnetic CuMnAs\nwhich is the prominent material used in the first realization of\nantiferromagnetic memory chips. We employ a femtosecond pump-probe\nmagneto-optical experiment based on magnetic linear dichroism. This table-top\noptical method is considerably more accessible than the traditionally employed\nlarge scale facility techniques like neutron diffraction and X-ray magnetic\ndichroism measurements. This optical technique allows an unambiguous direct\ndetermination of the Neel vector orientation in thin antiferromagnetic films\nutilized in devices directly from measured data without fitting to a\ntheoretical model.\n", "  Superposition, arguably the most fundamental property of quantum mechanics,\nlies at the heart of quantum information science. However, how to create the\nsuperposition of any two unknown pure states remains as a daunting challenge.\nRecently, it is proved that such a quantum protocol does not exist if the two\ninput states are completely unknown, whereas a probabilistic protocol is still\navailable with some prior knowledge about the input states [M. Oszmaniec\n\\emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 110403 (2016)]. The knowledge is that both\nof the two input states have nonzero overlaps with some given referential\nstate. In this work, we experimentally realize the probabilistic protocol of\nsuperposing two pure states in a three-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance system.\nWe demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol by preparing a families of input\nstates, and the average fidelity between the prepared state and expected\nsuperposition state is over 99%. Moreover, we experimentally illustrate the\nlimitation of the protocol that it is likely to fail or yields very low\nfidelity, if the nonzero overlaps are approaching zero. Our experimental\nimplementation can be extended to more complex situations and other quantum\nsystems.\n", "  We show how dispersionless channels exhibiting perfect spin-momentum locking\ncan arise in a 1D lattice model. While such spectra are forbidden by fermion\ndoubling in static 1D systems, here we demonstrate their appearance in the\nstroboscopic dynamics of a periodically driven system. Remarkably, this\nphenomenon does not rely on any adiabatic assumptions, in contrast to the well\nknown Thouless pump and related models of adiabatic spin pumps. The proposed\nsetup is shown to be experimentally feasible with state of the art techniques\nused to control ultracold alkaline earth atoms in optical lattices.\n", "  We investigate low energy structures of a lattice with dislocations in the\ncontext of nonlinear elasticity. We show that these low energy configurations\nexhibit in the limit a Cosserat-like behavior. Moreover, we give bounds from\nabove and below to the energy of such configurations.\n", "  We review our recent proposals for the on-demand generation of entangled\nfew-electron states using dynamic single-electron sources. The generation of\nentanglement can be traced back to the single-electron entanglement produced by\nquantum point contacts acting as electronic beam splitters. The coherent\npartitioning of a single electron leads to entanglement between the two\noutgoing arms of the quantum point contact. We describe our various approaches\nfor generating and certifying entanglement in dynamic electronic conductors and\nwe quantify the influence of detrimental effects such as finite electronic\ntemperatures and other dephasing mechanisms. The prospects for future\nexperiments are discussed and possible avenues for further developments are\nidentified.\n", "  The physical basis of flagellar and ciliary beating is a major problem in\nbiology which is still far from completely understood. The fundamental\ncytoskeleton structure of cilia and flagella is the axoneme, a cylindrical\narray of microtubule doublets connected by passive crosslinkers and dynein\nmotor proteins. The complex interplay of these elements leads to the generation\nof self-organized bending waves. Although many mathematical models have been\nproposed to understand this process, few attempts have been made to assess the\nrole of dyneins on the nonlinear nature of the axoneme. Here, we investigate\nthe nonlinear dynamics of flagella by considering an axonemal sliding control\nmechanism for dynein activity. This approach unveils the nonlinear selection of\nthe oscillation amplitudes, which are typically either missed or prescribed in\nmathematical models. The explicit set of nonlinear equations are derived and\nsolved numerically. Our analysis reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of dynein\npopulations and flagellum shape for different regimes of motor activity, medium\nviscosity and flagellum elasticity. Unstable modes saturate via the coupling of\ndynein kinetics and flagellum shape without the need of invoking a nonlinear\naxonemal response. Hence, our work reveals a novel mechanism for the saturation\nof unstable modes in axonemal beating.\n", "  Since its introduction in 1962, the Newman-Penrose formalism has been widely\nused in analytical and numerical studies of Einstein's equations, like for\nexample for the Teukolsky master equation, or as a powerful wave extraction\ntool in numerical relativity. Despite the many applications, Einstein's\nequations in the Newman-Penrose formalism appear complicated and not easily\napplicable to general studies of spacetimes, mainly because physical and gauge\ndegrees of freedom are mixed in a nontrivial way. In this paper we approach the\nwhole formalism with the goal of expressing the spin coefficients as functions\nof tetrad invariants once a particular tetrad is chosen. We show that it is\npossible to do so, and give for the first time a general recipe for the task,\nas well as an indication of the quantities and identities that are required.\n", "  Some classes of inflationary models naturally introduce two distinct\nmetrics/frames, and their equivalence in terms of observables has often been\nput in question. D-brane inflation proposes candidates for an inflaton embedded\nin the string theory and possesses descriptions on the brane and bulk\nmetrics/frames, which are connected by a conformal/disformal transformation\nthat depends on the inflaton and its derivatives. It has been shown that\ncurvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,\nmeaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those\nin the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or\nthe bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are\neventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including\nthe matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton\nscenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally\ncouples. Among all inflationary scenarios, we focus on two models motivated by\nthe KKLMMT fine-tuning problem: a slow-roll inflation with an inflection-point\npotential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to\ngravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the\ncurvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature\nperturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation. In the second\nmodel, the curvaton on the brane induces a spectral index significantly\ndifferent from that in the bulk and is even falsified by the observations. This\nwork thus demonstrates that two frames connected by a conformal/disformal\ntransformation lead to different physical observables such as CMB anisotropies\nin curvaton models.\n", "  We consider the reflection of a Dirac plane wave on a perfectly reflecting\nplane described by chiral MIT boundary conditions and determine the rotation of\nthe spin in the reflected component of the wave. We solve the analogous problem\nfor a classical particle using the evolution of the spin defined by the Thomas\nprecession and make a comparison with the quantum result. We find that the\nrotation axes of the spin in the two problems coincide only for a vanishing\nchiral angle, in which case the rotation angles coincide in the nonrelativistic\nlimit, and also remain remarkably close in the relativistic regime. The result\nshows that in the nonrelativistic limit the interaction between the spin and a\nreflecting surface with nonchiral boundary conditions is completely contained\nin the Thomas precession effect, in conformity with the fact that these\nboundary conditions are equivalent to an infinite repulsive scalar potential\noutside the boundary. By contrast, in the ultrarelativistic limit the rotation\nangle in the quantum problem remains finite, while in the classical one the\nrotation angle diverges. We comment on the possible implications of this\ndiscrepancy on the validity of the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations at\nlarge accelerations.\n", "  It is demonstrated that the effect of coexistence of bulk and surface\npolaritons within the same frequency band and wavevector space can be achieved\nin a magnetic-semiconductor superlattice providing a conscious choice of\ncharacteristic resonant frequencies and material fractions of the structure's\nunderlying components as well as geometry of the external static magnetic\nfield. The study is based on the effective medium theory which is involved to\ncalculate dispersion characteristics of the long-wavelength electromagnetic\nmodes of ordinary and extraordinary bulk polaritons and hybrid EH and HE\nsurface polaritons derived via averaged expressions with respect to the\neffective constitutive parameters of the superlattice.\n", "  Shared upstream dynamical processes are frequently the source of common\ninputs in various physical and biological systems. However, due to finite\nsignal transmission speeds and differences in the distance to the source, time\nshifts between otherwise common inputs are unavoidable. Since common inputs can\nbe a source of correlation between the elements of multi-unit dynamical\nsystems, regardless of whether these elements are directly connected with one\nanother or not, it is of importance to understand their impact on\nsynchronization. As a canonical model that is representative for a variety of\ndifferent dynamical systems, we study limit-cycle oscillators that are driven\nby stochastic time-shifted common inputs. We show that if the oscillators are\ncoupled, time shifts in stochastic common inputs do not simply shift the\ndistribution of the phase differences, but rather the distribution actually\nchanges as a result. The best synchronization is therefore achieved at a\nprecise intermediate value of the time shift, which is due to a resonance-like\neffect with the most probable phase difference that is determined by the\ndeterministic dynamics.\n", "  We study non-perturbatively the effect of the deflection angle on the BAO\nwiggles of the matter power spectrum in real space. We show that from redshift\nz~2 this introduces a dispersion of roughly 1 Mpc at BAO scale, which\ncorresponds approximately to a 1% effect. The lensing effect induced by the\ndeflection angle, which is completely geometrical and survey independent,\nsmears out the BAO wiggles. The effect on the power spectrum amplitude at BAO\nscale is about 0.1% for z~2 and 0.2% for z~4. We compare the smoothing effects\ninduced by the lensing potential and non-linear structure formation, showing\nthat the two effects become comparable at z~4, while the lensing effect\ndominates for sources at higher redshifts. We note that this effect is not\naccounted through BAO reconstruction techniques.\n", "  Wind-driven sand transport generates atmospheric dust, forms dunes, and\nsculpts landscapes. However, it remains unclear how the sand flux scales with\nwind speed, largely because models do not agree on how particle speed changes\nwith wind shear velocity. Here, we present comprehensive measurements from\nthree new field sites and three published studies, showing that characteristic\nsaltation layer heights, and thus particle speeds, remain approximately\nconstant with shear velocity. This result implies a linear dependence of\nsaltation flux on wind shear stress, which contrasts with the nonlinear 3/2\nscaling used in most aeolian process predictions. We confirm the linear flux\nlaw with direct measurements of the stress-flux relationship occurring at each\nsite. Models for dust generation, dune migration, and other processes driven by\nwind-blown sand on Earth, Mars, and several other planetary surfaces should be\nmodified to account for linear stress-flux scaling.\n", "  The small-angle scattering (SAS) from the Cantor surface fractal on the plane\nand Koch snowflake is considered. We develop the construction algorithm for the\nKoch snowflake, which makes possible the recurrence relation for the scattering\namplitude. The surface fractals can be decomposed into a sum of surface mass\nfractals for arbitrary fractal iteration, which enables various approximations\nfor the scattering intensity. It is shown that for the Cantor fractal, one can\nneglect with a good accuracy the correlations between the mass fractal\namplitudes, while for the Koch snowflake, these correlations are important. It\nis shown that nevertheless, the correlations can be build in the mass fractal\namplitudes, which explains the decay of the scattering intensity $I(q)\\sim\nq^{D_{\\mathrm{s}}-4}$ with $1 < D_{\\mathrm{s}} < 2$ being the fractal dimension\nof the perimeter. The curve $I(q)q^{4-D_{\\mathrm{s}}}$ is found to be\nlog-periodic in the fractal region with the period equal to the scaling factor\nof the fractal. The log-periodicity arises from the self-similarity of sizes of\nbasic structural units rather than from correlations between their distances. A\nrecurrence relation is obtained for the radius of gyration of Koch snowflake,\nwhich is solved in the limit of infinite iterations. The present analysis\nallows us to obtain additional information from SAS data, such as the edges of\nthe fractal regions, the fractal iteration number and the scaling factor.\n", "  The Berry curvature is a fundamental concept describing topological order of\nquantum systems. While it can be analytically tractable in non-interacting\nsystems, numerical simulations are necessary in interacting systems. We present\na formulation to calculate the Berry curvature in lattice QCD.\n", "  In the analysis of the robustness of multiplex networks, it is commonly\nassumed that a node is functioning only if its interdependent nodes are\nsimultaneously functioning. According to this model, a multiplex network\nbecomes more and more fragile as the number of layers increases. In this\nrespect, the addition of a new layer of interdependent nodes to a preexisting\nmultiplex network will never improve its robustness. Whereas such a model seems\nappropriate to understand the effect of interdependencies in the simplest\nscenario of a network composed of only two layers, it may seem not suitable to\ncharacterize the robustness of real systems formed by multiple network layers.\nIt seems in fact unrealistic that a real system, evolved, through the\ndevelopment of multiple layers of interactions, towards a fragile structure. In\nthis paper, we introduce a model of percolation where the condition that makes\na node functional is that the node is functioning in at least two of the layers\nof the network. The model reduces to the commonly adopted percolation model for\nmultiplex networks when the number of layers equals two. For larger number of\nlayers, however, the model describes a scenario where the addition of new\nlayers boosts the robustness of the system by creating redundant\ninterdependencies among layers. We prove this fact thanks to the development of\na message-passing theory able to characterize the model in both synthetic and\nreal-world multiplex graphs.\n", "  Electron-hole hybridization in InAs/GaSb double quantum well structures leads\nto the formation of a mini band gap. We experimentally and theoretically\nstudied the impact of strain on the transport properties of this material\nsystem. Thinned samples were mounted to piezo electric elements to exert strain\nalong the [011] and [001] crystal directions. When the Fermi energy is tuned\nthrough the mini gap, a dramatic impact on the resistivity at the charge\nneutrality point is found which depends on the amount of applied external\nstrain. In the electron and hole regimes, strain influences the Landau level\nstructure. By analyzing the intrinsic strain from the epitaxial growth, the\nexternal strain from the piezo elements and combining our experimental results\nwith numerical simulations of strained and unstrained quantum wells, we\ncompellingly illustrate why the InAs/GaSb material system is regularly found to\nbe semimetallic.\n", "  Despite the impressive advances in biological imaging, no imaging modality\ntoday generates, in a comprehensive manner, high-resolution images of crowded\nmolecules working deep inside the living cell in real time. In this paper,\ninstead of tackling this engineering problem in the hope of solving it, we ask\na converse question: What if such imaging is \\emph{fundamentally} impossible?\nWe argue that certain decoherence processes could be suppressed because the\ninternal workings of the cell are not being closely \"observed\" in the quantum\nmechanical sense, as implied by the assumed impossibility of imaging. It is\ncertainly true that the \"wet and warm\" living cell should not exhibit quantum\nbehavior merely because of the lack of observation. Despite this, we plow ahead\nto see what \\emph{might} result from such absence of the outward flow of\ninformation. We suggest that chaotic dynamics in the cell could be quantum\nmechanically suppressed --- a known phenomenon in quantum chaology, which is\npotentially resistant to various mechanisms for the emergence of classicality.\nWe also consider places where experimental evidence for/against such a\npossibility may be sought.\n", "  Despite the abundance of bipartite networked systems, their organizing\nprinciples are less studied, compared to unipartite networks. Bipartite\nnetworks are often analyzed after projecting them onto one of the two sets of\nnodes. As a result of the projection, nodes of the same set are linked together\nif they have at least one neighbor in common in the bipartite network. Even\nthough these projections allow one to study bipartite networks using tools\ndeveloped for unipartite networks, one-mode projections lead to significant\nloss of information and artificial inflation of the projected network with\nfully connected subgraphs. Here we pursue a different approach for analyzing\nbipartite systems that is based on the observation that such systems have a\nlatent metric structure: network nodes are points in a latent metric space,\nwhile connections are more likely to form between nodes separated by shorter\ndistances. This approach has been developed for unipartite networks, and\nrelatively little is known about its applicability to bipartite systems. Here,\nwe fully analyze a simple latent-geometric model of bipartite networks, and\nshow that this model explains the peculiar structural properties of many real\nbipartite systems, including the distributions of common neighbors and\nbipartite clustering. We also analyze the geometric information loss in\none-mode projections in this model, and propose an efficient method to infer\nthe latent pairwise distances between nodes. Uncovering the latent geometry\nunderlying real bipartite networks can find applications in diverse domains,\nranging from constructing efficient recommender systems to understanding cell\nmetabolism.\n", "  In recent years, nanoporous thin films have been widely studied for\nthermoelectric applications. High thermoelectric performance is reported for\nnanoporous Si films, which is attributed to the dramatically reduced lattice\nthermal conductivity and bulk-like electrical properties. Porous materials can\nalso be used in gas sensing applications by engineering the surface-trapped\ncharges on pore edges. In this work, an analytical model is developed to\nexplore the relationship between the thermoelectric properties and pore-edge\ncharges in a periodic two-dimensional nanoporous material. The presented model\ncan be widely used to analyze the measured electrical properties of general\nnanoporous thin films and two-dimensional materials.\n", "  We investigate patterns of critical current as a function of perpendicular\nand in-plane magnetic fields in superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor\n(SNS) junctions based on InAs/InGaAs heterostructures with an epitaxial Al\nlayer. This material system is of interest due to its exceptionally good\nsuperconductor-semiconductor coupling, as well as large spin-orbit interaction\nand g-factor in the semiconductor. Thin epitaxial Al allows the application of\nlarge in-plane field without destroying superconductivity. For fields\nperpendicular to the junction, flux focusing results in aperiodic node spacings\nin the pattern of critical currents known as Fraunhofer patterns by analogy to\nthe related interference effect in optics. Adding an in-plane field yields two\nfurther anomalies in the pattern. First, higher order nodes are systematically\nstrengthened, indicating current flow along the edges of the device, as a\nresult of confinement of Andreev states driven by an induced flux dipole;\nsecond, asymmetries in the interference appear that depend on the field\ndirection and magnitude. A model is presented, showing good agreement with\nexperiment, elucidating the roles of flux focusing, Zeeman and spin-orbit\ncoupling, and disorder in producing these effects.\n", "  In this work we explore the applicability of a special gluon mass generating\nmechanism in the context of the linear covariant gauges. In particular, the\nimplementation of the Schwinger mechanism in pure Yang-Mills theories hinges\ncrucially on the inclusion of massless bound-state excitations in the\nfundamental nonperturbative vertices of the theory. The dynamical formation of\nsuch excitations is controlled by a homogeneous linear Bethe-Salpeter equation,\nwhose nontrivial solutions have been studied only in the Landau gauge. Here,\nthe form of this integral equation is derived for general values of the\ngauge-fixing parameter, under a number of simplifying assumptions that reduce\nthe degree of technical complexity. The kernel of this equation consists of\nfully-dressed gluon propagators, for which recent lattice data are used as\ninput, and of three-gluon vertices dressed by a single form factor, which is\nmodelled by means of certain physically motivated Ans\\\"atze. The\ngauge-dependent terms contributing to this kernel impose considerable\nrestrictions on the infrared behavior of the vertex form factor; specifically,\nonly infrared finite Ans\\\"atze are compatible with the existence of nontrivial\nsolutions. When such Ans\\\"atze are employed, the numerical study of the\nintegral equation reveals a continuity in the type of solutions as one varies\nthe gauge-fixing parameter, indicating a smooth departure from the Landau\ngauge. Instead, the logarithmically divergent form factor displaying the\ncharacteristic \"zero crossing\", while perfectly consistent in the Landau gauge,\nhas to undergo a dramatic qualitative transformation away from it, in order to\nyield acceptable solutions. The possible implications of these results are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Extraordinary dispersion features of a circular waveguide filled by a\nlongitudinally magnetized composite gyroelectromagnetic medium are studied. The\ncomposite medium is considered to be constructed by juxtaposition together of\nmagnetic and semiconductor layers providing all characteristic dimensions of\nthe resulting multilayered system are much smaller than the wavelength in the\ncorresponding part of the composite medium. The waveguide dispersion equation\nand its eigenmodes are derived. The mode classification is made in a standard\nmanner so that the guided modes are sorted into a class of hybrid HE and EH\nwaves in terms of their unique dispersion characteristics. The numerical\nresults are obtained in the band near the frequencies of corresponding\nresonances in constitutive materials of the composite medium, and they show\nthat the modes behaviors become to be quite diverse due to manifestation of a\nstrong combined geometrical and material dispersion related to the waveguide\nparameters and gyroelectromagnetic filling, respectively.\n", "  We measure the cross-correlation between Fermi-LAT gamma-ray photons and over\n1000 deg$^2$ of weak lensing data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the Red Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey (RCSLenS),\nand the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS). We present the first measurement of\ntomographic weak lensing cross-correlations and the first application of\nspectral binning to cross-correlations between gamma rays and weak lensing. The\nmeasurements are performed using an angular power spectrum estimator while the\ncovariance is estimated using an analytical prescription. We verify the\naccuracy of our covariance estimate by comparing it to two internal covariance\nestimators. Based on the non-detection of a cross-correlation signal, we derive\nconstraints on weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter. We\ncompute exclusion limits on the dark matter annihilation cross-section\n$\\langle\\sigma_\\rm{ann} v \\rangle$, decay rate $\\Gamma_\\rm{dec}$, and particle\nmass $m_\\rm{DM}$. We find that in the absence of a cross-correlation signal,\ntomography does not significantly improve the constraining power of the\nanalysis. Assuming a strong contribution to the gamma-ray flux due to\nsmall-scale clustering of dark matter and accounting for known astrophysical\nsources of gamma rays, we exclude the thermal relic cross-section for particle\nmasses of $m_\\rm{DM}\\lesssim 20$ GeV.\n", "  High-precision constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) will\nsignificantly improve our understanding of the physics of the early universe.\nAmong all the subtleties in using large scale structure observables to\nconstrain PNG, accounting for relativistic corrections to the clustering\nstatistics is particularly important for the upcoming galaxy surveys covering\nprogressively larger fraction of the sky. We focus on relativistic projection\neffects due to the fact that we observe the galaxies through the light that\nreaches the telescope on perturbed geodesics. These projection effects can give\nrise to an effective $f_{\\rm NL}$ that can be misinterpreted as the primordial\nnon-Gaussianity signal and hence is a systematic to be carefully computed and\naccounted for in modelling of the bispectrum. We develop the technique to\nproperly account for relativistic effects in terms of purely observable\nquantities, namely angles and redshifts. We give some examples by applying this\napproach to a subset of the contributions to the tree-level bispectrum of the\nobserved galaxy number counts calculated within perturbation theory and\nestimate the corresponding non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\\rm NL}$, for the\nlocal, equilateral and orthogonal shapes. For the local shape, we also compute\nthe local non-Gaussianity resulting from terms obtained using the consistency\nrelation for observed number counts. Our goal here is not to give a precise\nestimate of $f_{\\rm NL}$ for each shape but rather we aim to provide a scheme\nto compute the non-Gaussian contamination due to relativistic projection\neffects. For the terms considered in this work, we obtain contamination of\n$f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc} \\sim {\\mathcal O}(1)$.\n", "  The CHEERS (CHEmical Enrichment RGS Sample) observations of clusters of\ngalaxies with XMM-Newton have shown to be valuable to constrain the chemical\nevolution of the universe. The soft X-ray spectrum contains lines of the most\nabundant metals from N to Ni, which provide relatively accurate abundances that\ncan be compared to supernova enrichment models. The accuracy of the abundances\nis currently limited by systematic uncertainties introduced by the available\ninstruments and uncertainties in the modeling of the spectra, which are of the\norder of 20-30%. We discuss the possible gain of extending the current samples\nat low and high redshift. We conclude that expanding the samples would be\nexpensive in terms of exposure time, but will not yield significantly improved\nresults, because the current samples already reach the systematic limits. New\ninstrumentation, like Astro-H2 and ATHENA, and improvements to the atomic\ndatabases are needed to make significant advances in this field.\n", "  There are major discrepancies between recent ICFT (Intermediate Coupling\nFrame Transformation) and DARC (Dirac Atomic R-matrix Code) calculations\n(Fern\\'andez-Menchero et al. 2014, Astron. Astroph. 566 A104, Aggarwal et al.\n2016 Mon. Not. R Astr. Soc. 461 3997) regarding electron-impact excitation\nrates for transitions in several Be-like ions, as well as claims that the DARC\ncalculations are much more accurate and the ICFT results might even be wrong.\nTo identify possible reasons for these discrepancies and to estimate the\naccuracy of the various results, we carried out independent B-Spline R-Matrix\n(BSR) calculations for electron-impact excitation of the Be-like ion N$^{3+}$.\nOur close-coupling expansions contain the same target states (238 levels\noverall) as the previous ICFT and DARC calculations, but the representation of\nthe target wave functions is completely different. We find close agreement\namong all calculations for the strong transitions between low-lying states,\nwhereas there remain serious discrepancies for the weak transitions as well as\nfor transitions to highly excited states. The differences in the final results\nfor the collision strengths are mainly due to differences in the structure\ndescription, specifically the inclusion of correlation effects, rather than the\ntreatment of relativistic effects or problems with the validity of the three\nmethods to describe the collision. Hence there is no indication that one\napproach is superior to another, until the convergence of both the target\nconfiguration and the close-coupling expansions have been fully established.\n", "  We introduce and experimentally implement a method for the absolute detector\ncalibration of photon-number-resolving time-bin multiplexing layouts based on\nthe measured click statistics of superconduncting nanowire detectors. In\nparticular, the quantum efficiencies, the dark count rates, and the positive\noperator-valued measures of these measurement schemes are directly obtained\nwith high accuracy. The method is based on the moments of the click-counting\nstatistics for coherent states with different coherent amplitudes. The strength\nof our analysis is that we can directly conclude -- on a quantitative basis --\nthat the detection strategy under study is well described by a linear response\nfunction for the light-matter interaction and that it is sensitive to the\npolarization of the incident light field. Moreover, our method is further\nextended to a two-mode detection scenario. Finally, we present possible\napplications for such well characterized detectors, such as sensing of\natmospheric loss channels and phase sensitive measurements.\n", "  We study the preparation (pump) and the detection (probe) of\nfar-from-equilibrium BCS superconductor dynamics in THz pump-probe experiments.\nIn a recent experiment [R. Matsunaga, Y. I. Hamada, K. Makise, Y. Uzawa, H.\nTerai, Z. Wang, and R. Shimano, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 111}, 057002 (2013)], an\nintense monocycle THz pulse with center frequency $\\omega \\simeq \\Delta$ was\ninjected into a superconductor with BCS gap $\\Delta$; the subsequent post-pump\nevolution was detected via the optical conductivity. It was argued that\nnonlinear coupling of the pump to the Anderson pseudospins of the\nsuperconductor induces coherent dynamics of the Higgs (amplitude) mode\n$\\Delta(t)$. We validate this picture in a two-dimensional BCS model with a\ncombination of exact numerics and the Lax reduction method, and we compute the\nnonequilibrium phase diagram as a function of the pump intensity. The main\neffect of the pump is to scramble the orientations of Anderson pseudospins\nalong the Fermi surface by twisting them in the $xy$-plane. We show that more\nintense pump pulses can induce a far-from-equilibrium phase of gapless\nsuperconductivity (\"phase I\"), originally predicted in the context of\ninteraction quenches in ultracold atoms. We show that the THz pump method can\nreach phase I at much lower energy densities than an interaction quench, and we\ndemonstrate that Lax reduction (tied to the integrability of the BCS\nHamiltonian) provides a general quantitative tool for computing coherent BCS\ndynamics. We also calculate the Mattis-Bardeen optical conductivity for the\nnonequilibrium states discussed here.\n", "  A diffusive lattice gas is characterized by the diffusion coefficient\ndepending only on the density. The Green-Kubo formula for diffusivity can be\nrepresented as a variational formula, but even when the equilibrium properties\nof a lattice gas are analytically known the diffusion coefficient can be\ncomputed only in the exceptional situation when the lattice gas is gradient. In\nthe general case, minimization over an infinite-dimensional space is required.\nWe propose an approximation scheme based on minimizing over finite-dimensional\nsubspaces of functions. The procedure is demonstrated for one-dimensional\ngeneralized exclusion processes in which each site can accommodate at most two\nparticles. Our analytical predictions provide upper bounds for the diffusivity\nthat are very close to simulation results throughout the entire density range.\nWe also analyze non-equilibrium density profiles for finite chains coupled to\nreservoirs. The predictions for the profiles are in excellent agreement with\nsimulations.\n", "  The multinucleon transfer reactions has been investigated within the\ndinuclear system model. The nucleon transfer is coupled to the dissipation of\nrelative motion energy and angular momentum by solving a set of microscopically\nderived master equations. A barrier distribution approach is implemented in the\nmodel in order to including the contributions of different orientations and\ndynamical effects. The available data of fragment production via multinucleon\ntransfer reactions could be understood with the model for the reactions of\n$^{136}$Xe + $^{198}$Pt/$^{208}$Pb near Coulomb barrier energies. It is found\nthat the production of heavy neutron-rich nuclei weakly depends on the incident\nenergy. However, the yields of proton-rich nuclei increase with the incident\nenergy.\n", "  In this paper, we present a detailed study of the problem of classical\nstability of U(1) gauged Q-balls. In particular, we show that the standard\nmethods that are suitable for establishing the classical stability criterion\nfor ordinary (nongauged) one-field and two-field Q-balls are not effective in\nthe case of U(1) gauged Q-balls, although all the technical steps of\ncalculations can be performed in the same way as those for ordinary Q-balls. We\nalso present the results of numerical simulations in models with different\nscalar field potentials, explicitly demonstrating that, in general, the regions\nof stability of U(1) gauged Q-balls are not defined in the same way as in the\ncase of ordinary Q-balls. Consequently, the classical stability criterion for\nordinary Q-balls cannot be applied to U(1) gauged Q-balls in the general case.\n", "  Today's colleges and universities consist of highly complex structures that\ndictate interactions between the administration, faculty, and student body.\nThese structures can play a role in dictating the efficiency of policy enacted\nby the administration and determine the effect that curriculum changes in one\ndepartment have on other departments. Despite the fact that the features of\nthese complex structures have a strong impact on the institutions, they remain\nby-and-large unknown in many cases. In this paper we study the academic\nstructure of our home institution of Trinity College in Hartford, CT using the\nmajor and minor patterns between graduating students to build a temporal\nmultiplex network describing the interactions between different departments.\nUsing recent network science techniques developed for such temporal networks we\nidentify the evolving community structures that organize departments'\ninteractions, as well as quantify the interdisciplinary centrality of each\ndepartment. We implement this framework for Trinity College, finding practical\ninsights and applications, but also present it as a general framework for\ncolleges and universities to better understand their own structural makeup in\norder to better inform academic and administrative policy.\n", "  The factorization of nonlinear second-order differential equations proposed\nby Rosu and Cornejo-Perez in 2005 is extended to equations containing quadratic\nand cubic forms in the first derivative. A few illustrative examples\nencountered in physics are provided.\n", "  We propose an efficient way to test rotational invariance in the cosmological\nperturbations by use of galaxy correlation functions. In symmetry-breaking\ncases, the galaxy power spectrum can have extra angular dependence in addition\nto the usual one due to the redshift-space distortion, $ \\hat{k} \\cdot\n\\hat{n}$. We confirm that, via the decomposition into not the usual Legendre\nbasis ${\\cal L}_\\ell(\\hat{k} \\cdot \\hat{n})$ but the bipolar spherical harmonic\none $\\{Y_{\\ell}(\\hat{k}) \\otimes Y_{\\ell'}(\\hat{n})\\}_{LM}$, the\nsymmetry-breaking signal can be completely distinguished from the usual\nisotropic one since the former yields nonvanishing $L \\geq 1$ modes but the\nlatter is confined to the $L = 0$ one. As a demonstration, we analyze the\nsignatures due to primordial-origin symmetry breakings such as the well-known\nquadrupolar-type and dipolar-type power asymmetries and find nonzero $L = 2$\nand $1$ modes, respectively. Fisher matrix forecasts of their constraints\nindicate that the $Planck$-level sensitivity could be achieved by the SDSS or\nBOSS-CMASS data, and an order-of-magnitude improvement is expected in a near\nfuture survey as PFS or Euclid by virtue of an increase in accessible Fourier\nmode. Our methodology is model-independent and hence applicable to the searches\nfor various types of statistically anisotropic fluctuations.\n", "  The violation of Bell's inequality requires a well-designed experiment to\nvalidate the result. In experiments using energy-time and time-bin\nentanglement, initially proposed by Franson in 1989, there is an intrinsic\nloophole due to the high postselection. To obtain a violation in this type of\nexperiment, a chained Bell inequality must be used. However, the local realism\nbound requires a high visibility in excess of 94.63 percent in the time-bin\nentangled state. In this work, we show how such a high visibility can be\nreached in order to violate a chained Bell inequality with 6, 8 and 10 terms.\n", "  Black holes as solutions to gravity theories, are generically identified by a\nset of parameters. Some of these parameters are associated with black hole\nphysical conserved charges, like ADM charges. There can also be some \"redundant\nparameters.\" We propose necessary conditions for a parameter to be physical.\nThe conditions are essentially integrability and non-triviality of the charge\nvariations arising from \"parametric variations,\" variation of the solution with\nrespect to the chosen parameters. In addition, we prove that variation of the\nredundant parameters which do not meet our criteria do not appear in the first\nlaw of thermodynamics. As an interesting application, we show that dilaton\nmoduli are redundant parameters for black hole solutions to\nEinstein-Maxwell-(Axion)-Dilaton theories, because variations in dilaton moduli\nwould render entropy, mass, electric charges or angular momenta non-integrable.\nOur results are in contrast with modification of the first law due to scalar\ncharges suggested in Gibbons-Kallosh-Kol paper arXiv:hep-th/9607108 and its\nfollow-ups. We also briefly discuss implications of our results for the\nattractor behavior of extremal black holes.\n", "  From numerical simulations, we show that non-rotating magnetohydrodynamic\nshear flows are unstable to finite amplitude velocity perturbations and become\nturbulent, leading to the growth and sustenance of magnetic energy, including\nlarge scale fields. This supports the concept that sustained magnetic energy\nfrom turbulence is independent of the driving mechanism for large enough\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers.\n", "  We argue that $isotropic$ scalar fluctuations in solid inflation are\nadiabatic in the super-horizon limit. During the solid phase this adiabatic\nmode has peculiar features: constant energy-density slices and comoving slices\ndo not coincide, and their curvatures, parameterized respectively by $\\zeta$\nand $\\mathcal R$, both evolve in time. The existence of this adiabatic mode\nimplies that Maldacena's squeezed limit consistency relation holds after\nangular average over the long mode. The correlation functions of a\nlong-wavelength spherical scalar mode with several short scalar or tensor modes\nis fixed by the scaling behavior of the correlators of short modes,\nindependently of the solid inflation action or dynamics of reheating.\n", "  In physical theories where the energy (action) is localized near a\nsubmanifold of a constant curvature space, there is a universal expression for\nthe energy (or the action). We derive a multipole expansion for the energy that\nhas a finite number of terms, and depends on intrinsic geometric invariants of\nthe submanifold and extrinsic invariants of the embedding of the submanifold.\nThis is the second of a pair of articles in which we try to develop a theory of\nemergent gravity arising from the embedding of a submanifold into an ambient\nspace equipped with a quantum field theory. Our theoretical method requires a\ngeneralization of a formula due to by Hermann Weyl. While the first paper\ndiscussed the framework in Euclidean (Minkowski) space, here we discuss how\nthis framework generalizes to spaces of constant sectional curvature. We focus\nprimarily on anti de Sitter space. We then discuss how such a theory can give\nrise to a cosmological constant and Planck mass that are within reasonable\nbounds of the experimental values.\n", "  We study the excitonic phase and low-energy excitation spectra of perovskite\ncobalt oxides. Constructing the five-orbital Hubbard model defined on the\nthree-dimensional cubic lattice for the $3d$ bands of\nPr$_{0.5}$Ca$_{0.5}$CoO$_3$, we calculate the excitonic susceptibility in the\nnormal state in the random-phase approximation (RPA) to show the presence of\nthe instability toward excitonic condensation. Based on the excitonic ground\nstate with a magnetic multipole obtained in the mean-field approximation, we\ncalculate the dynamical susceptibility of the excitonic phase in the RPA and\nfind that there appear the gapless collective excitation in the spin-transverse\nmode (Goldstone mode) and the gapful collective excitation in the\nspin-longitudinal mode (Higgs mode). Experimental relevance is discussed.\n", "  Crossing and anti-crossing effects in dispersion characteristics of both bulk\nand surface polaritons in a magnetic-semiconductor superlattice influenced by\nan external static magnetic field being in the Faraday geometry are discussed.\nThe bulk polaritons are classified as eigenwaves with right-handed and\nleft-handed elliptically polarized states, whereas the surface polaritons are\nconsidered as hybrid modes having a predominant effect of either magnetic or\nsemiconductor subsystem, and distinctions in dispersion characteristics of such\npolaritons are revealed involving the concept of critical points.\n", "  We discuss the feasibility of detecting the gauge boson of the\n$U(1)_{L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}}$ symmetry, which possesses a mass in the range between\nMeV and GeV, at the Belle-II experiment. The kinetic mixing between the new\ngauge boson $Z'$ and photon is forbidden at the tree level and is radiatively\ninduced. The leptonic force mediated by such a light boson is motivated by the\ndiscrepancy in muon anomalous magnetic moment and also the gap in the energy\nspectrum of cosmic neutrino. Defining the process $e^{+} e^{-} \\rightarrow\n\\gamma Z' \\rightarrow \\gamma \\nu \\bar{\\nu}~(missing~energy)$ to be the signal,\nwe estimate the numbers of the signal and the background events and show the\nparameter region to which the Belle-II experiment will be sensitive. The signal\nprocess in the $L_{\\mu}-L_{\\tau}$ model is enhanced with a light $Z'$, which is\na characteristic feature differing from the dark photon models with a constant\nkinetic mixing. We find that the Belle-II experiment with the design luminosity\nwill be sensitive to the $Z'$ with the mass $M_{Z'} \\lesssim 1 $ GeV and the\nnew gauge coupling $g_{Z'} \\gtrsim 8\\cdot 10^{-4}$, which covers a half of the\nunconstrained parameter region that explains the discrepancy in muon anomalous\nmagnetic moment. The possibilities to improve the significance of the detection\nare also discussed.\n", "  We study time-independent radially symmetric first-order solitons in a CP(2)\nmodel interacting with an Abelian gauge field whose dynamics is controlled by\nthe usual Maxwell term. In this sense, we develop a consistent first-order\nframework verifying the existence of a well-defined lower bound for the\ncorresponding energy. We saturate such a lower bound by focusing on those\nsolutions satisfying a particular set of coupled first-order differential\nequations. We solve these equations numerically using appropriate boundary\nconditions giving rise to regular structures possessing finite-energy. We also\ncomment the main features these configurations exhibit. Moreover, we highlight\nthat, despite the different solutions we consider for an auxiliary function\n$\\beta \\left( r\\right) $ labeling the model (therefore splitting our\ninvestigation in two a priori distinct branches), all resulting scenarios\nengender the very same phenomenology, being physically equivalent.\n", "  The uncertainty principle restricts potential information one gains about\nphysical properties of the measured particle. However, if the particle is\nprepared in entanglement with a quantum memory, the corresponding entropic\nuncertainty relation will vary. Based on the knowledge of correlations between\nthe measured particle and quantum memory, we have investigated the entropic\nuncertainty relations for two and multiple measurements, and generalized the\nlower bounds on the sum of Shannon entropies without quantum side information\nto those that allow quantum memory. In particular, we have obtained\ngeneralization of Kaniewski-Tomamichel-Wehner's bound for effective measures\nand majorization bounds for noneffective measures to allow quantum side\ninformation. Furthermore, we have derived several strong bounds for the\nentropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory for two and\nmultiple measurements. Finally, potential applications of our results to\nentanglement witnesses are discussed via the entropic uncertainty relation in\nthe absence of quantum memory.\n", "  Allometric scaling can reflect underlying mechanisms, dynamics and structures\nin complex systems; examples include typical scaling laws in biology, ecology\nand urban development. In this work, we study allometric scaling in scientific\nfields. By performing an analysis of the outputs/inputs of various scientific\nfields, including the numbers of publications, citations, and references, with\nrespect to the number of authors, we find that in all fields that we have\nstudied thus far, including physics, mathematics and economics, there are\nallometric scaling laws relating the outputs/inputs and the sizes of scientific\nfields. Furthermore, the exponents of the scaling relations have remained quite\nstable over the years. We also find that the deviations of individual subfields\nfrom the overall scaling laws are good indicators for ranking subfields\nindependently of their sizes.\n", "  We consider a cold two-species atomic Fermi gas confined in a trap. We\ncombine the Hermitian coupling between the states (we assume them to be the\nstates with different spins) with the Cooper pairing of atoms with these\ndifferent spins. This opens up a new prospect for investigation of interplay\nbetween various phenomena involving Raman coupling (e.g., atom lasers,\ndark-state polaritons) and effects caused by Cooper pairing of particles (e.g.,\nsuperfluidity). We have obtained a threshold of transition from oscillatory to\namplifying behavior of matter waves.\n", "  We consider memoryless quantum communication protocols, where the two parties\ndo not possess any memory besides their classical input and they take turns\nperforming unitary operations on a pure quantum state that they exchange\nbetween them. Most known quantum protocols are of this type and recently a deep\nconnection between memoryless protocols and Bell inequality violations has been\nexplored recently by Buhrman et al. We study the information cost of memoryless\nquantum protocols by looking at a canonical problem: bounded-round quantum\ncommunication protocols for the one-bit AND function. We prove directly a tight\nlower bound of $\\Theta(\\log(k) / k)$ for the information cost of AND for\n$k$-round memoryless quantum protocols and for the input distribution needed\nfor the Disjointness function. It is not clear if memoryless protocols allow\nfor a reduction between AND and Disjointness, due to the absence of private\nworkspaces. We enhance the model by allowing the players to keep in their\nprivate classical workspace apart from their input also some classical private\ncoins. Surprisingly, we show that every quantum protocol can be transformed\ninto an equivalent quantum protocol with private coins that is perfectly\nprivate, i.e. the players only learn the value of the function and nothing\nmore. Last, we consider the model where the players are allowed to use one-shot\ncoins, i.e. private coins that can be used only once during the protocol. While\nin the classical case, private coins and one-shot coins are equivalent, in the\nquantum case, we prove that they are not. More precisely, we show that every\nquantum memoryless protocol with one-bit inputs that uses one-shot coins can be\ntransformed into a memoryless quantum protocol without private coins and\nwithout increasing too much its information cost. Hence, while private coins\nalways allow for private quantum protocols, one-shot coins do not.\n", "  Our desire and fascination with intelligent machines dates back to the\nantiquity's mythical automaton Talos, Aristotle's mode of mechanical thought\n(syllogism) and Heron of Alexandria's mechanical machines and automata.\nHowever, the quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is troubled with\nrepeated failures of strategies and approaches throughout the history. This\ndecade has seen a shift in interest towards bio-inspired software and hardware,\nwith the assumption that such mimicry entails intelligence. Though these steps\nare fruitful in certain directions and have advanced automation, their singular\ndesign focus renders them highly inefficient in achieving AGI. Which set of\nrequirements have to be met in the design of AGI? What are the limits in the\ndesign of the artificial? Here, a careful examination of computation in\nbiological systems hints that evolutionary tinkering of contextual processing\nof information enabled by a hierarchical architecture is the key to build AGI.\n", "  Lead halide perovskite solar cells have recently emerged as a very promising\nphotovoltaic technology due to their excellent power conversion efficiencies;\nhowever, the toxicity of lead and the poor stability of perovskite materials\nremain two main challenges that need to be addressed. Here, for the first time,\nwe report a lead-free, highly stable C6H4NH2CuBr2I compound. The C6H4NH2CuBr2I\nfilms exhibit extraordinary hydrophobic behavior with a contact angle of\napproximately 90 degree, and their X-ray diffraction patterns remain unchanged\neven after four hours of water immersion. UV-Vis absorption spectrum shows that\nC6H4NH2CuBr2I compound has an excellent optical absorption over the entire\nvisible spectrum. We applied this copper-based light absorber in printable\nmesoscopic solar cell for the initial trial and achieved a power conversion\nefficiency of 0.5%. Our study represents an alternative pathway to develop\nlow-toxic and highly stable organic-inorganic hybrid materials for photovoltaic\napplication.\n", "  We study a pulse-coupled dynamics of excitable elements in uncorrelated\nscale-free networks. Regimes of self-sustained activity are found for\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous couplings, in which the system displays a wide\nvariety of behaviors, including periodic and irregular global spiking signals,\nas well as coherent oscillations, an unexpected form of synchronization. Our\nnumerical results also show that the properties of the population firing rate\ndepend on the size of the system, particularly its structure and average value\nover time. However, a few straightforward dynamical and topological strategies\ncan be introduced to enhance or hinder these global behaviors, rendering a\nscenario where signal control is attainable, which incorporates a basic\nmechanism to turn off the dynamics permanently. As our main result, here we\npresent a framework to estimate, in the stationary state, the mean firing rate\nover a long time window and to decompose the global dynamics into average\nvalues of the inter-spike-interval of each connectivity group. Our approach\nprovides accurate predictions of these average quantities when the network\nexhibits high heterogeneity, a remarkable finding that is not restricted\nexclusively to the scale-free topology.\n", "  The concept of gauge theories progressively emerged during the 20th century\nwhile the building of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This work\nfocusses on some aspects of gauge theories. First, a modern interpretation of\nMaxwell's equations in terms of differential forms motivates a geometric\ndefinition of gauge theories as a theory of connections on principle bundles.\nAfter presenting some historical facts about the notion of gauge in particle\nphysics, the geometrical construction is used to study the electroweak theory\nand the SM. Though the SM has not been defaulted by any experiments yet, it\nstill remains theoretically incomplete. The Higgs boson discovered in 2012 at\nLHC, is a particle about which we do not know lots yet. Some interesting clues\nabout how one should extend the SM could be obtained through the observation of\nsignificant deviations between the measured value of some parameter of the\nHiggs boson, and the one predicted by the SM. The trilinear Higgs coupling is\none of those interesting parameters. The last part of this work is a\nphenomenological study of the impact of variations of this coupling on the\ndistributions one can typically get from the CMS particle detector, at LHC.\n", "  The classic Kob-Andersen (KA) binary Lennard-Jones mixtures which are\ndesigned to prevent crystallization has been extensively studied in simulation\nof slow dynamics. Although crystallization can occur if a liquid system is\ncooled slowly, so far the KA model has not been crystallized. Here we report\nusing molecular simulation the observation of crystal growth in the supercooled\nKA liquids. The onset of crystallization is observed occurring at temperature\n$T_c= 0.55$ which is higher than the glass transition temperature of\n$T_g=0.40$. We further examine the statistical distribution of single particle\ndisplacements in crystallization and close to glass transition. The\ndisplacement distribution for crystallization exhibits a power-law decay,\nwhereas the distribution for glassy relaxation reflects a Gaussian center,\nterminated with an exponential tail (namely dynamic heterogeneity). Finally, we\npredict in order to crystalize KA liquids the cooling rate is approximately\nequal to $10^{-22}$, which is about 15 odder lower than the typical MD cooling\nrate.\n", "  We carried out dynamic force manipulations $in$ $silico$ on a variety of\nsuperhelical protein fragments from myosin, chemotaxis receptor, vimentin,\nfibrin, and phenylalanine zippers that vary in size and topology of their\n$\\alpha$-helical packing. When stretched along the superhelical axis, all\nsuperhelices show elastic, plastic, and inelastic elongation regimes, and\nundergo a dynamic transition from the $\\alpha$-helices to the $\\beta$-sheets,\nwhich marks the onset of plastic deformation. Using Abeyaratne-Knowles\nformulation of phase transitions, we developed a theory to model mechanical and\nkinetic properties of protein superhelices under mechanical non-equilibrium\nconditions and to map their energy landscapes. The theory was validated by\ncomparing the simulated and theoretical force-strain spectra. Scaling laws for\nthe elastic force and the force for $\\alpha$-to-$\\beta$ transition to plastic\ndeformation can be used to rationally design new materials of required\nmechanical strength with desired balance between stiffness and plasticity.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the geodesic flow on factors of the hyperbolic\nplane. We prove that a periodic orbit including a 2-antiparallel encounter has\na partner orbit. We construct the partner orbit and give an estimate for the\naction different between the orbit pair. Then we apply the result to reprove\nthe accuracy of Sieber/Richter's prediction in [Sieber and Richter, 2001].\n", "  The ab initio anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism has been used to\nexamine the pairing mechanism and the nature of the superconducting gap in the\nrecently discovered lithium-decorated monolayer graphene superconductor. Our\nresults provide evidence that the superconducting transition in Li-decorated\nmonolayer graphene can be explained within a standard phonon-mediated\nmechanism. We predict a single anisotropic superconducting gap and a critical\ntemperature Tc = 5.1-7.6 K, in very good agreement with the experimental\nresults.\n", "  We report first-principles calculations of the superconducting properties of\n$\\beta$--Bi$_2$Pd within the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. We\nfind a single anisotropic superconducting gap of $s$--wave symmetry which\nvaries in magnitude on the different regions of the Fermi surface. The\ncalculated superconducting energy gap on the Fermi surface, the superconducting\ntransition temperature, the specific heat, and the quasi-particle density of\nstates are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental results and\nsupport the view that $\\beta$--Bi$_2$Pd is a phonon-mediated single anisotropic\ngap superconductor.\n", "  We present an explicit analysis of wave-resonant instability of swirling\nflows inside fast rotating cylindrical containers. The linear dynamics are\ndecomposed into the interaction between the horizontal inner centrifugal edge\nwaves, the outer vertical gravity waves with the aim of understanding the\ndynamics of the centrifugal waves. We show how the far field velocity induced\nrespectively by the centrifugal and the gravity waves affect each other's\npropagation rates and amplitude growth. We follow this with an analysis of the\ninstability in terms of a four wave interaction, two centrifugal and two\ngravity ones, and explain why the resonant instability can be obtained only\nbetween a pair of two counter-propagating waves, one centrifugal and one\ngravity. Furthermore, a near resonant regime which does not yield instability\nis shown to result from a phase-locking configuration between a pair of a\ncounter-propagating centrifugal wave and a pro-propagating gravity one, where\nthe interaction affects the waves' propagation rates but not the amplitude\ngrowth.\n", "  In numerous functional materials, such as steels, ferroelectrics and magnets,\nnew functionalities can be achieved through the engineering of the domain\nstructures, which are associated with the ordering of certain parameters within\nthe material. The recent progress in imaging techniques with atomic-scale\nspatial resolution transformed our understanding of domain topology revealing\nthat, along with simple stripe-like or irregularly shaped domains, intriguing\nvortex-type topological domain configurations also exist. In this Review, we\npresent a new classification scheme of \"ZmxZn domains with Zl vortices\" for\ntwo-dimensional macroscopic domain structures with m directional variants and n\ntranslational antiphases. This classification, together with the concept of\ntopological protection and topological charge conservation, can be applied to a\nwide range of materials, such as multiferroics, improper ferroelectrics,\nlayered transition-metal dichalcogenides and magnetic superconductors, as we\ndiscuss through selected examples. The resulting topological considerations\nprovide a new basis for the understanding of the formation, kinetics,\nmanipulation and property optimization of domains and domain boundaries in\nfunctional materials.\n", "  The black hole information paradox is really a combination of two problems:\nthe causality paradox and the entanglement problem. The causality paradox\narises because in the semiclassical approximation infalling matter gets\ncausally trapped inside its own horizon; it is therefore unable to send its\ninformation back to infinity if we disallow propagation outside the light cone.\nWe show how the causality paradox is resolved in the fuzzball paradigm. One\nneeds to distinguish between two kinds of Rindler spaces: (a) Rindler space\nobtained by choosing accelerating coordinates in Minkowski space and (b)\n`pseudo-Rindler' space, which describes the region near the surface of a\nfuzzball. These two spaces differ in their vacuum fluctuations. While low\nenergy waves propagate the same way on both spaces, infalling objects with\nenergies $E\\gg T$ suffer an `entropy enhanced tunneling' in the pseudo-Rindler\nspacetime (b); this leads to the nucleation of a fuzzball before the infalling\nobject gets trapped inside a horizon.\n", "  Silicon is vital to the computing industry due to the high quality of its\nnative oxide and well-established doping technologies. Isotopic purification\nhas enabled quantum coherence times on the order of seconds, thereby placing\nsilicon at the forefront of efforts to create a solid state quantum processor.\nWe demonstrate strong coupling of a single electron in a silicon double quantum\ndot to the photonic field of a microwave cavity, as shown by the observation of\nvacuum Rabi splitting. Strong coupling of a quantum dot electron to a cavity\nphoton would allow for long-range qubit coupling and the long-range\nentanglement of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots.\n", "  Mid-IR colour selection techniques have proved to be very efficient in\nfinding AGN. This is because the AGN heats the surrounding dust producing warm\nmid-IR colours. Using the WISE 3.6, 4.5 and 12 $\\mu m$ colours, the largest\nsample of IR selected AGN has already been produced containing 1.4 million AGN\nover the whole sky. Here, we explore the X-ray properties of this AGN sample by\ncross-correlating it with the subsample of the 3XMM X-ray catalogue that has\navailable X-ray spectra and at the same time optical spectroscopy from SDSS.\nOur goal is to find rare luminous obscured AGN. Our final sample contains 65\nQSOs with $\\rm{log}\\,\\nu L_\\nu \\ge 46.2$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$. This IR luminosity cut\ncorresponds to $\\rm{log}\\,L_X \\approx 45$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$, at the median\nredshift of our sample ($z=2.3$), that lies at the bright end of the X-ray\nluminosity function at $z>2$. The X-ray spectroscopic analysis reveals seven\nobscured AGN having a column density $\\rm N_H>10^{22} cm^{-2}$. Six of them\nshow evidence for broad [CIV] absorption lines and five are classified as\nBALQSOs. We fit the optical spectra of our X-ray absorbed sources to estimate\nthe optical reddening. We find that none of these show any obscuration\naccording to the optical continuum. These sources add to the growing evidence\nfor populations of luminous QSOs with evidence for substantial absorption by\noutflowing ionised material, similar to those expected to be emerging from\ntheir absorbing cocoons in the framework of AGN/galaxy co-evolution.\n", "  When Morris and Thorne first proposed that wormholes might be actual physical\nstructures suitable for interstellar travel, they needed to pay close attention\nto certain traversability conditions such as low tidal forces, which placed\nsevere constraints on the wormhole geometry. Even more problematical was the\nneed for \"exotic matter\" resulting from the unavoidable violation of the null\nenergy condition required to hold a wormhole open. The purpose of this paper is\nto overcome these problems by starting with the charged wormhole model of Kim\nand Lee and assuming a noncommutative-geometry background: the violation of the\nnull energy condition can be attributed to the latter, while the electric\ncharge allows the reduction of the tidal forces to acceptable levels without\ninvoking the trivial zero-tidal-force assumption.\n", "  We reported the first observation of metallic hydrogen (MH) in the low\ntemperature limit at a pressure of ~495 GPa in an article published in Science\n(1). This transition was first predicted by Wigner and Huntington (WE) over 80\nyears ago (2) at a pressure of ~25 GPa. In recent decades it became clear that\nthe required pressure for metallization was far greater, in the 400-500 GPa\nrange. Until now the observation of the WE transition in diamond anvil cells\n(DACs) has been prevented by one problem: the diamonds break before a\nsufficiently high pressure has been achieved. This has driven the high-pressure\ncommunity to improve DACs and experimental methods to understand and overcome\nthe conditions that limited the performance of diamonds and the pressure. In\nour experiment, with increasing pressure, we observed a clear transition from a\ntransparent sample of solid molecular hydrogen to an opaque black sample to a\nshiny reflective sample of MH, as determined by reflectance measurements. There\nis no doubt that MH was produced at the highest pressures. Yet there have been\ncriticisms concerning the pressure that was achieved, the possibility that the\n50 nm alumina layer, deposited on diamonds to inhibit diffusion of hydrogen,\nmight be transformed to a metal and be responsible for the reflectance, and\nanalysis of the reflectance. Here we respond to the criticisms posted on the\ncondensed matter arXiv by Loubeyre, Occelli, and Dumas (LOD)- arXiv:1702.07192,\nEremets and Drozdov (ED)- arXiv:1702.05125, and Goncharov and Struzhkin (GS)-\narXiv:1702.04246.\n", "  Individual computations and social interactions underlying collective\nbehavior in groups of animals are of great ethological, behavioral, and\ntheoretical interest. While complex individual behaviors have successfully been\nparsed into small dictionaries of stereotyped behavioral modes, studies of\ncollective behavior largely ignored these findings; instead, their focus was on\ninferring single, mode-independent social interaction rules that reproduced\nmacroscopic and often qualitative features of group behavior. Here we bring\nthese two approaches together to predict individual swimming patterns of adult\nzebrafish in a group. We show that fish alternate between an active mode in\nwhich they are sensitive to the swimming patterns of conspecifics, and a\npassive mode where they ignore them. Using a model that accounts for these two\nmodes explicitly, we predict behaviors of individual fish with high accuracy,\noutperforming previous approaches that assumed a single continuous computation\nby individuals and simple metric or topological weighing of neighbors behavior.\nAt the group level, switching between active and passive modes is uncorrelated\namong fish, yet correlated directional swimming behavior still emerges. Our\nquantitative approach for studying complex, multi-modal individual behavior\njointly with emergent group behavior is readily extensible to additional\nbehavioral modes and their neural correlates, as well as to other species.\n", "  In modeling solute transport with mobile-immobile mass transfer (MIMT), it is\ncommon to use an advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with a retardation factor,\nor retarded ADE. This is commonly referred to as making the local equilibrium\nassumption. Assuming local equilibrium (LE), Eulerian textbook treatments\nderive the retarded ADE, ostensibly exactly. However, other authors have\npresented rigorous mathematical derivations of the dispersive effect of mass\ntransfer, applicable even in the case of arbitrarily fast mass transfer. First,\nwe resolve the apparent contradiction between these seemingly exact derivations\nby adopting a Lagrangian point of view. We show that LE constrains the expected\ntime immobile, whereas the retarded ADE actually embeds a stronger,\nnonphysical, constraint: that all particles spend the same amount of every time\nincrement immobile. Eulerian derivations of the retarded ADE thus silently\ncommit the gambler's fallacy, leading them to ignore dispersion due to mass\ntransfer that is correctly modeled by other approaches. Second, we present a\nnumerical particle tracking study of transport in a heterogeneous aquifer\nsubject to first-order MIMT. Transport is modeled (a) exactly, and then (b)\napproximated with the retarded ADE. Strikingly different results are obtained,\neven though quasi-LE is maintained at all times by the exact MIMT simulation.\nWe thus observe that use of the phrase local equilibrium assumption to refer to\nADE validity is not correct. We highlight that solute remobilization rate is\nthe true control on retarded ADE validity, and note that classic \"local\nequilibrium assumption\" (i.e., ADE validity) criteria actually test for\ninsignificance of MIMT-driven dispersion relative to hydrodynamic dispersion,\nrather than for local equilibrium.\n", "  To understand the multiple relations between developers and projects on\nGitHub as a whole, we model them as a multilayer bipartite network and analyze\nthe degree distributions, the nearest neighbors' degree distributions and their\ncorrelations with degree, and the collaborative similarity distributions and\ntheir correlations with degree. Our results show that all degree distributions\nhave a power-law form, especially, the degree distribution of projects in\nwatching layer has double power-law form. Negative correlations between nearest\nneighbors' degree and degree for both developers and projects are observed in\nboth layers, exhibiting a disassortative mixing pattern. The collaborative\nsimilarity of both developers and projects negatively correlates with degree in\nwatching layer, while a positive correlations is observed for developers in\nforking layer and no obvious correlation is observed for projects in forking\nlayer.\n", "  Most mechanical resonators are treated as simple linear oscillators.\nNonlinearity in the resonance behavior of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS)\nhas only lately attracted significant interest. Most recently, cubic-order\nnonlinearity has been used to explain anomalies in the resonance frequency\nbehaviors in the frequency domain. Particularly, such nonlinearities were\nexplained using cubic nonlinearity in the restoring force (Duffing\nnonlinearity) or damping (van der Pol nonlinearity). Understanding the limits\nof linear resonant behavior is particularly important in NEMS, as they are\nfrequently studied for their potential in ultrasensitive sensing and detection,\napplications that most commonly assume a linear behavior to transduce motion\ninto a detected signal. In this paper, we report that even at low excitation,\ncubic nonlinearity is insufficient to explain nonlinearity in graphene NEMS.\nRather, we observe that higher order, in particular, the fifth order effects\nneed to be considered even for systems at room temperature with modest quality\nfactors. These are particularly important results that could determine the\nlimits of linear detection in such systems and quite possibly present\nunconventional avenues for ultrasensitive detection paradigms using nonlinear\ndynamics. Such intriguing possibilities, however, hinge crucially on a superior\nunderstanding and exploitation of these inherent nonlinearities as opposed to\nmodeling them as approximated linear or cubic systems.\n", "  While the recent establishment of the role of thermophoresis/diffusion-driven\noxygen migration during resistance switching in metal oxide memristors provided\ncritical insights required for memristor modeling, extended investigations of\nthe role of oxygen migration during ageing and failure remain to be detailed.\nSuch detailing will enable failure-tolerant design, which can lead to enhanced\nperformance of memristor-based next-generation storage-class memory. Here we\ndirectly observed lateral oxygen migration using in-situ synchrotron x-ray\nabsorption spectromicroscopy of HfOx memristors during initial resistance\nswitching, wear over millions of switching cycles, and eventual failure,\nthrough which we determined potential physical causes of failure. Using this\ninformation, we reengineered devices to mitigate three failure mechanisms, and\ndemonstrated an improvement in endurance of about three orders of magnitude.\n", "  Fine pixel CCD (FPCCD) is one of the candidate sensor technologies for the\nvertex detector used for experiments at the International Linear Collider\n(ILC). FPCCD vertex detector is supposed to be cooled down to -40 degree for\nimprovement of radiation immunity. For this purpose, a two-phase CO2 cooling\nsystem using a gas compressor for CO2 circulation is being developed at KEK.\nThe status of this R&D is presented in this article.\n", "  Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are ultra-narrow strips of graphene that have the\npotential to be used in high-performance graphene-based semiconductor\nelectronics. However, controlled growth of GNRs on dielectric substrates\nremains a challenge. Here, we report the successful growth of GNRs directly on\nhexagonal boron nitride substrates with smooth edges and controllable widths\nusing chemical vapour deposition. The approach is based on a type of template\ngrowth that allows for the in-plane epitaxy of mono-layered GNRs in\nnano-trenches on hexagonal boron nitride with edges following a zigzag\ndirection. The embedded GNR channels show excellent electronic properties, even\nat room temperature. Such in-plane hetero-integration of GNRs, which is\ncompatible with integrated circuit processing, creates a gapped channel with a\nwidth of a few benzene rings, enabling the development of digital integrated\ncircuitry based on GNRs.\n", "  The electronic stopping cross sections (SCS) of Ta and Gd for slow protons\nhave been investigated experimentally. The data are compared to the results for\nPt and Au to learn how electronic stopping in transition and rare earth metals\ncorrelates with features of the electronic band structures. The extraordinarily\nhigh SCS observed for protons in Ta and Gd cannot be understood in terms of a\nfree electron gas model, but are related to the high densities of both occupied\nand unoccupied electronic states in these metals.\n", "  Weyl's original scale geometry of 1918 (\"purely infinitesimal geometry\") was\nwithdrawn by its author from physical theorizing in the early 1920s. It had a\ncomeback in the last third of the 20th century in different contexts: scalar\ntensor theories of gravity, foundations of gravity, foundations of quantum\nmechanics, elementary particle physics, and cosmology. It seems that Weyl\ngeometry continues to offer an open research potential for the foundations of\nphysics even after the turn to the new millennium.\n", "  The idea of combining different two-dimensional (2D) crystals in van der\nWaals heterostructures (vdWHs) has led to a new paradigm for band structure\nengineering with atomic precision. Due to the weak interlayer couplings, the\nband structures of the individual 2D crystals are largely preserved upon\nformation of the heterostructure. However, regardless of the details of the\ninterlayer hybridisation, the size of the 2D crystal band gaps are always\nreduced due to the enhanced dielectric screening provided by the surrounding\nlayers. The effect can be on the order of electron volts, but its precise\nmagnitude is non-trivial to predict because of the non-local nature of the\nscreening in quasi-2D materials, and it is not captured by effective\nsingle-particle methods such as density functional theory. Here we present an\nefficient and general method for calculating the band gap renormalization of a\n2D material embedded in an arbitrary vdWH. The method evaluates the change in\nthe GW self-energy of the 2D material from the change in the screened Coulomb\ninteraction. The latter is obtained using the quantum-electrostatic\nheterostructure (QEH) model. We benchmark the G$\\Delta$W method against full\nfirst-principles GW calculations and use it to unravel the importance of\nscreening-induced band structure renormalisation in various vdWHs. A main\nresult is the observation that the size of the band gap reduction of a given 2D\nmaterial when inserted into a heterostructure scales inversely with the\npolarisability of the 2D material. Our work demonstrates that dielectric\nengineering \\emph{via} van der Waals heterostructuring represents a promising\nstrategy for tailoring the band structure of 2D materials.\n", "  The recent development of superconducting spintronics has revealed the\nspin-triplet superconducting proximity effect from a spin-singlet\nsuperconductor into a spin-polarized normal metal. In addition recently\nsuperconducting junctions using semiconductors are in demand for highly\ncontrolled experiments to engineer topological superconductivity. Here we\nreport experimental observation of Andreev reflection in junctions of\nspin-resolved quantum Hall (QH) states in an InAs quantum well and the\nspin-singlet superconductor NbTi. The measured conductance indicates a sub-gap\nfeature and two peaks on the outer side of the sub-gap feature in the QH\nplateau-transition regime increases. The observed structures can be explained\nby considering transport with Andreev reflection from two channels, one\noriginating from equal-spin Andreev reflection intermediated by spin-flip\nprocesses and second arising from normal Andreev reflection. This result\nindicates the possibility to induce the superconducting proximity gap in the\nthe QH bulk state, and the possibility for the development of superconducting\nspintronics in semiconductor devices.\n", "  Memory has a great impact on the evolution of every process related to human\nsocieties. Among them, the evolution of an epidemic is directly related to the\nindividuals' experiences. Indeed, any real epidemic process is clearly\nsustained by a non-Markovian dynamics: memory effects play an essential role in\nthe spreading of diseases. Including memory effects in the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model seems very appropriate for\nsuch an investigation. Thus, the memory prone SIR model dynamics is\ninvestigated using fractional derivatives. The decay of long-range memory,\ntaken as a power-law function, is directly controlled by the order of the\nfractional derivatives in the corresponding nonlinear fractional differential\nevolution equations. Here we assume \"fully mixed\" approximation and show that\nthe epidemic threshold is shifted to higher values than those for the\nmemoryless system, depending on this memory \"length\" decay exponent. We also\nconsider the SIR model on structured networks and study the effect of topology\non threshold points in a non- Markovian dynamics. Furthermore, the lack of\naccess to the precise information about the initial conditions or the past\nevents plays a very relevant role in the correct estimation or prediction of\nthe epidemic evolution. Such a \"constraint\" is analyzed and discussed.\n", "  This work studies the symmetry between colloidal dynamics and the dynamics of\nthe Euro--US Dollar currency exchange market (EURUSD). We consider the EURUSD\nprice in the time range between 2001 and 2015, where we find significant\nqualitative symmetry between fluctuation distributions from this market and the\nones belonging to colloidal particles in supercooled or arrested states. In\nparticular, we find that models used for arrested physical systems are suitable\nfor describing the EURUSD fluctuation distributions. Whereas the corresponding\nmean squared price displacement (MSPD) to the EURUSD is diffusive for all\nyears, when focusing in selected time frames within a day, we find a two-step\nMSPD when the New York Stock Exchange market closes, comparable to the dynamics\nin supercooled systems. This is corroborated by looking at the price\ncorrelation functions and non-Gaussian parameters, and can be described by the\ntheoretical model. We discuss the origin and implications of this analogy.\n", "  A brief survey is given of theoretical works on surface states (SSs) in Dirac\nmaterials. Within the formalism of envelope wave functions and boundary\nconditions for these functions, a minimal model is formulated that analytically\ndescribes surface and edge states of various (topological and non-topological)\ntypes in several systems with Dirac fermions (DFs). The applicability\nconditions of this model are discussed.\n", "  The photonics involving II-VI epitaxial layers was limited so far to\nstructures based on a single planar microcavity. Here, we present double,\nvertically coupled, ZnTe optical microcavities in planar and 3-D photonic\nmolecule geometry. We design the structures with the help of transfer matrix\nmethod calculations and we establish their fabrication technology by molecular\nbeam epitaxy. We characterize the samples by reflectivity spatial mapping and\nstudy them by measurements of angle-integrated and angle-resolved\nphotoluminescence and reflectivity. We efficiently tailor the interaction\nstrength of the cavities optical modes by an adjustment of the spatial\nseparation between the microcavities, their thickness ratio and by the size of\nmicropillars etched out of the planar structure. Coupling constants extracted\nfrom our measurements agree well with those determined in calculations in the\nframe of a tight-binding approach applied to one-dimensional photonic\nstructures.\n", "  One dimensional Klein-Gordon (KG) equation is investigated in the domain of\nconformable fractional calculus for one dimensional scalar potential namely\ngeneralized Hulthen potential. The conformable fractional calculus is based on\nconformable fractional derivative which is the most natural definition in non\ninteger order calculus. Fractional order differential equations can be solved\nanalytically by means of this derivative operator. We obtained exact eigenvalue\nand eigenfunction solutions of local fractional KG equation and investigated\nthe evolution of relativistic effects in correspondence with the fractional\norder.\n", "  Unlike the widely studied $s$-type two-gap superconductor MgB$_2$, the\nchemically similar compounds ZrB$_2$ and HfB$_2$ do not superconduct above 1 K.\nYet, it has been shown that small amounts of self- or extrinsic doping (in\nparticular with vanadium), can induce superconductivity in these materials.\nBased on results of different macro- and microscopic measurements, including\nmagnetometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), resistivity, and muon-spin\nrotation ($\\mu$SR), we present a comparative study of\nZr$_{0.96}$V$_{0.04}$B$_2$ and Hf$_{0.97}$V$_{0.03}$B$_2$. Their key magnetic\nand superconducting features are determined and the results are considered\nwithin the theoretical framework of multiband superconductivity proposed for\nMgB$_2$. Detailed Fermi surface (FS) and electronic structure calculations\nreveal the difference between MgB$_2$ and transition-metal diborides.\n", "  We demonstrate how electric fields with arbitrary time profile can be used to\ncontrol the time-dependent parameters of spin and orbital exchange\nHamiltonians. Analytic expressions for the exchange constants are derived from\na time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, and the validity of the\nresulting effective Hamiltonian is verified for the case of a quarter-filled\ntwo-orbital Hubbard model, by comparing to the results of a full nonequilibrium\ndynamical mean-field theory simulation. The ability to manipulate Hamiltonians\nwith arbitrary time-dependent fields, beyond the paradigm of Floquet\nengineering, opens the possibility to control intertwined spin and orbital\norder using laser or THz pulses which are tailored to minimize electronic\nexcitations.\n", "  Multiplex networks consist of a fixed set of nodes connected by several sets\nof edges which are generated separately and correspond to different networks\n(\"layers\"). Here, the Ising model on multiplex networks with two layers is\nconsidered, with spins located in the nodes and edges corresponding to\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions between them. Critical\ntemperatures for the spin glass and ferromagnetic transitions are evaluated for\nthe layers in the form of random Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi graphs or heterogeneous\nscale-free networks using the replica method, from the replica symmetric\nsolution. For the Ising model on multiplex networks with scale-free layers it\nis shown that the critical temperature is finite if the distributions of the\ndegrees of nodes within both layers have a finite second moment, and that\ndepending on the model parameters the transition can be to the ferromagnetic or\nspin glass phase. It is also shown that the correlation between the degrees of\nnodes within different layers significantly influences the critical\ntemperatures for both transitions and thus the phase diagram. The scaling\nbehavior for the spin glass order parameter is determined by a semi-analytic\nprocedure and it is shown that for the Ising model on multiplex networks with\nscale-free layers the scaling exponent can depend on the distributions of the\ndegrees of nodes within layers. The analytic results are partly confirmed by\nMonte Carlo simulations using the parallel tempering algorithm.\n", "  Fomalhaut b is a directly imaged object in the debris disk of the star\nFomalhaut. It has been hypothesized to be a planet, however there are issues\nwith the observed colours of the object that do not fit planetary models. An\nalternative hypothesis is that the object is a neutron star in the near fore-\nor background of Fomalhaut's disk. We test if Fomalhaut b could be a neutron\nstar using X-ray observations with Chandra's HRC-I instrument in the energy\nrange of 0.08-10 keV. We do not detect X-ray emission from either Fomalhaut b\nor the star Fomalhaut itself. Our nondetection corresponds to an upper limit on\nthe X-ray flux of Fomalhaut b of F_X < 1.3e-14 erg/cm/s^2 in the energy range\n0.08-10 keV. For the A-type central star Fomalhaut, we derive an X-ray upper\nlimit of L_X < 2e25 erg/s in the energy range 0.08-10 keV. Fomalhaut b's X-ray\nnon-detection constrains the parameter space for a possible neutron star\nsignificantly, implying surface temperatures lower than 91000 K and distances\ncloser than 13.3 pc to the solar system. In addition we find that reflected\nstarlight from the central star fits the available optical detections of\nFomalhaut b; a smaller planet with a large ring system might explain such a\nscenario.\n", "  Strong-field ionization and rescattering beyond the long-wavelength limit of\nthe dipole approximation is studied with elliptically polarized mid-IR pulses.\nWe have measured the full three-dimensional photoelectron momentum\ndistributions (3D PMDs) with velocity map imaging and tomographic\nreconstruction. The ellipticity-dependent 3D-PMD measurements revealed an\nunexpected sharp, thin line-shaped ridge structure in the polarization plane\nfor low momentum photoelectrons. With classical trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC)\nsimulations and analytical methods we identified the associated ionization\ndynamics for this sharp ridge to be due to Coulomb focusing of slow\nrecollisions of electrons with a momentum approaching zero. This ridge is\nanother example of the many different ways how the Coulomb field of the parent\nion influences the different parts of the momentum space of the ionized\nelectron wave packet. Building on this new understanding of the PMD, we extend\nour studies on the role played by the magnetic field component of the laser\nbeam when operating beyond the long-wavelength limit of the dipole\napproximation. In this regime, we find that the PMD exhibits an\nellipticity-dependent asymmetry along the beam propagation direction: the peak\nof the projection of the PMD onto the beam propagation axis is shifted from\nnegative to positive values with increasing ellipticity. This turnover occurs\nrapidly once the ellipticity exceeds $\\sim$0.1. We identify the sharp, thin\nline-shaped ridge structure in the polarization plane as the origin of the\nellipticity-dependent PMD asymmetry in the beam propagation direction. These\nresults yield fundamental insights into strong-field ionization processes, and\nshould increase the precision of the emerging applications relying on this\ntechnique, including time-resolved holography and molecular imaging.\n", "  In this paper we propose an efficient tomographic approach for the early\ndetection of 2D rogue waves. The method relies on the principle of detecting\nconical spectral features before rogue wave becomes evident in time. More\nspecifically, the proposed method is based on constructing the 1D Radon\ntransforms of the emerging conical 2D spectra of the wavefield using\ncompressive sampling (CS) and then constructing 2D spectra from those\nprojections using filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm. For the 2D rogue\nwave models we use the radially symmetric Peregrine soliton and\nAkhmediev-Peregrine soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation,\nwhich can model characteristics of the peaked structure of 2D rogue waves and\ntheir conical spectra which may be treated as a sparse signal. We show that\nemerging conical spectra of 2D rogue waves before they become evident in time\ncan be acquired efficiently by the proposed method.\n", "  Quantum games with incomplete information can be studied within a Bayesian\nframework. We consider a version of prisoner's dilemma (PD) in this framework\nwith three players and characterize the Nash equilibria. A variation of the\nstandard PD game is set up with two types of the second prisoner and the first\nprisoner plays with them with probability p and 1-p respectively. The Bayesian\nnature of the game manifests in the uncertainty that the first prisoner faces\nabout his opponent's type which is encoded either in a classical probability or\nin the amplitudes of a wave function. Here, we consider scenarios with\nasymmetric payoffs between the first and second prisoner for different values\nof the probability, p, and the entanglement. Our results indicate a class of\nNash equilibria (NE) with rich structures, characterized by a phase\nrelationship on the strategies of the players. The rich structure that can be\nexploited by the referee to set up rules of the game to push the players\ntowards a specific class of NE. These results provide a deeper insight into the\nquantum advantages of Bayesian games over their classical counterpart.\n", "  Quantum games with incomplete information can be studied within a Bayesian\nframework. We analyze games quantized within the EWL framework [Eisert,\nWilkens, and Lewenstein, Phys Rev. Lett. 83, 3077 (1999)]. We solve for the\nNash equilibria of a variety of two-player quantum games and compare the\nresults to the solutions of the corresponding classical games. We then analyze\nBayesian games where there is uncertainty about the player types in two-player\nconflicting interest games. The solutions to the Bayesian games are found to\nhave a phase diagram-like structure where different equilibria exist in\ndifferent parameter regions, depending both on the amount of uncertainty and\nthe degree of entanglement. We find that in games where a Pareto-optimal\nsolution is not a Nash equilibrium, it is possible for the quantized game to\nhave an advantage over the classical version. In addition, we analyze the\nbehavior of the solutions as the strategy choices approach an unrestricted\noperation. We find that some games have a continuum of solutions, bounded by\nthe solutions of a simpler restricted game. A deeper understanding of Bayesian\nquantum game theory could lead to novel quantum applications in a multi-agent\nsetting.\n", "  Intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) provides highly conformal dose\ndistributions through the application of multiple, angularly spaced fields,\neach applying an ad-hoc pattern of spatially varying particle fluences. In\nparticular, Bragg peaks are simultaneously optimized for all the fields. Once\nthe number and the direction of the fields are set, the dose distribution of\nthe IMPT plan is determined by the dose constraints assigned to specific\norgans-at-risk (OARs) surrounding the tumour. In this work, we introduce a new\nfeature for the OARs, called \"opacity\", aimed at improving the quality and the\nrobustness of IMPT plans, by modifying, in the pre-optimization stage, the\nfluence of the pencil beams, that intersect those structures. The proposed IMPT\nplanning strategy is addressed to those clinical cases, where metallic\nprothesis or fast density-varying organs can compromise the stability of the\ndose distribution. We show how the usage of this additional parameter can lead\nto more accurate IMPT plans with respect to the situation in which only dose\nconstraints are adopted.\n", "  The rising complexity of our terrestrial surrounding is an empirical fact.\nDetails of this process evaded description in terms of physics for long time\nattracting attention and creating myriad of ideas including non-scientific\nones. In this essay we explain the phenomenon of the growth of complexity by\ncombining our up to date understanding of cosmology, non-equilibrium physics\nand thermodynamics. We argue that the observed increase of complexity is causal\nin nature, stands in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics and has\nit's origin in the cosmological expansion. Moreover, we highlight the\nconnection between the leader of complexity growth in localized areas of space\nwith free energy rate density, starting from the largest scales towards the\nsmaller ones. Finally, in the light of recent advances in non-equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics, our belief in the causal structure of modern scientific\ntheories is transferred to biological systems. On relevant scales, adaptation\nand complexity growth follows a similar pattern, in which free energy rate\ndensity is provided by an external electromagnetic radiation. The presented,\nholistic approach, arms us with predicting power about variety of attributes of\ncomplex systems and leads to a chain of successful explanations on all scales\nof the Universe.\n", "  The remarkably strong Coulomb interaction in atomically thin transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs) results in an extraordinarily rich many-particle physics\nincluding the formation of tightly bound excitons. Besides optically accessible\nbright excitonic states, these materials also exhibit a variety of dark\nexcitons. Since they can even lie below the bright states, they have a strong\ninfluence on the exciton dynamics, lifetimes, and photoluminescence. While very\nrecently, the presence of dark excitonic states has been experimentally\ndemonstrated, the origin of these states, their formation, and dynamics have\nnot been revealed yet. Here, we present a microscopic study shedding light on\ntime- and energy-resolved formation and thermalization of bright and dark\nintra- and intervalley excitons as well as their impact on the\nphotoluminescence in different TMD materials. We demonstrate that intervalley\ndark excitons, so far widely overlooked in current literature, play a crucial\nrole in tungsten-based TMDs giving rise to an enhanced photoluminescence and\nreduced exciton lifetimes at elevated temperatures.\n", "  Recent computational studies confirmed by experiment have established the\noccurrence of superconducting temperatures, $T_c$, near 200 K when the pressure\nis close to 200 GPa in the compound H$_3S$. Motivated by these findings we\ninvestigate in this work the possibility of discovering high-temperature\nsuperconductivity in the material H$_3$F. We performed linearized augmented\nplane wave(LAPW) calculations followed by the determination of the angular\nmomentum components of the density of states, the scattering phase shifts at\nthe Fermi level and the electron-ion matrix element known as the Hopfield\nparameter. Our calculated Hopfield parameters are much larger than those found\nin H$_3$S suggesting that they may lead to large electron-phonon coupling\nconstant and hence a large Tc similar or even larger than that of H$_3$S.\nHowever, calculations of elastic constants are inconclusive regarding the\nstability of this material.\n", "  Static granular packs have been studied in the last three decades in the\nframe of a modified equilibrium statistical mechanics that assumes ergodicity\nas a basic postulate. The canonical example on which this framework is tested\nconsists in the series of static configurations visited by a granular column\nsubjected to taps. By analyzing the response of a realistic model of grains, we\ndemonstrate that volume and stress variables visit different regions of the\nphase space at low tap intensities in different realizations of the experiment.\nWe show that the tap intensity beyond which sampling by tapping becomes ergodic\ncoincides with the forcing necessary to break all particle-particle contacts\nduring each tap. These results imply that the well-known \"reversible\" branch of\ntapped granular columns is only valid at relatively high tap intensities.\n"]}
