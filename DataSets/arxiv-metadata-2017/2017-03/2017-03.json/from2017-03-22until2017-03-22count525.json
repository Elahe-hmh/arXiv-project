different flux-limited sub-samples of the Chandra Deep Field\nNorth (CDF-N) and South (CDF-S) surveys. We find a strong dependence of the\nclustering strength on the sub-sample flux-limit, a fact which explains most of\nthe disparate clustering results of different XMM and Chandra surveys. Using\nLimber's equation, we find that the inverted CDF-N and CDF-S spatial clustering\nlengths are consistent with direct spatial clustering measures found in the\nliterature, while at higher flux-limits the clustering length increases\nconsiderably; for example, at $fx,limit ~ 10^{-15} erg/s/cm^{-2} we obtain r_0~\n17 +- 5 and 18+- 3 h^{-1} Mpc, for the CDF-N and CDF-S, respectively. We show\nthat the observed flux-limit clustering trend hints towards an X-ray luminosity\ndependent clustering of X-ray selected, $z\\sim 1$, AGNs.\n", "  In a former paper (Garcia-Rissmann et al. 2005; hereafter Paper I), we have\npresented spectra of 64 active, 9 normal and 5 Starburst galaxies in the region\naround the near-IR Calcium triplet absorption lines and the [SIII]9069 line. In\nthe present paper we analyze the CaT strength (WCaT), and kinematical products\nderived in that study, namely stellar and ionized gas velocity dispersions. Our\nmain results may be summarized as follows: (1) Seyfert 2s show no sign of\ndilution in WCaT with respect to the values spanned by normal galaxies, even\nwhen optical absorption lines such as the CaII K band at 3933 A are much weaker\nthan in old, bulge-like stellar populations. (2) The location of Seyfert 2s in\nthe WCaT-WCaK plane is consistent with evolutionary synthesis models. The\nimplication is that the source responsible for the dilution of optical lines in\nthese AGN is a young stellar population, rather than an AGN featureless\ncontinuum, confirming the conclusion of the pioneer study of Terlevich, Diaz &\nTerlevich. (3) In Seyfert 1s, both W[SIII] and WCaT tend to be diluted due to\nthe presence of a non-stellar component, in agreement with the unification\nparadigm. (4) A comparison of stellar and gas velocity dispersions confirms the\nexistence of a correlation between the typical velocities of stars and clouds\nof the Narrow Line Region. The strength and scatter around this correlation are\nsimilar to those previously obtained from the [OIII]5007 line width.\n", "  We present a study of a galaxy overdensity at z=1.6, Cl 0332-2742, uncovered\nin the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS). We\nconservatively estimate the overdensity in redshift space for the spike,\ncontaining 42 galaxies at z=1.6, to be 8.3+/-1.5 and find a velocity dispersion\nof 500 km/s. A map of the surface density of galaxies at z=1.6 in the GMASS\nfield shows that its structure is irregular. The differences in the physical\nproperties of Cl 0332-2742 member and field galaxies agree with the latest\nhierarchical galaxy formation models: for overdensity members, the star\nformation rate (SFR), and specific SFR, is approximately 50% lower than for the\nfield galaxies; overdensity galaxies are twice the age, on average, of field\ngalaxies; and there is a higher proportion of both massive (M>10^{10.7} M_sol),\nand early-type galaxies, inside Cl 0332-2742 than in the field. Among the 42\nmembers, 7 have spectra consistent with being passively evolving, massive\ngalaxies. In a z-J colour-magnitude diagram, the photometric data of these\nearly-type galaxies are in close agreement with a theoretical red sequence of a\ngalaxy cluster at redshift z=1.6, which formed most of its stars in a short\nburst of star formation at z~3. We conclude that the redshift spike at z=1.6 in\nthe GMASS field represents a sheet-like structure in the cosmic web and the\narea with the highest surface density within this structure, containing already\nseven passively evolving galaxies, will evolve into a cluster of galaxies at a\nlater time.\n", "  To exploit synergies between the Herschel Space Observatory and next\ngeneration radio facilities, we have extended the semi-empirical extragalactic\nradio continuum simulation of Wilman et al. (2008) to the mid- and\nfar-infrared. Here we describe the assignment of infrared spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) to the star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei,\nusing Spitzer 24, 70 and 160 micron and SCUBA 850 micron survey results as the\nmain constraints.\n  Star-forming galaxies dominate the source counts, and a model in which their\nfar-infrared-radio correlation and infrared SED assignment procedure are\ninvariant with redshift underpredicts the observed 24 and 70 micron source\ncounts. The 70 micron deficit can be eliminated if the star-forming galaxies\nundergo stronger luminosity evolution than originally assumed for the radio\nsimulation, a requirement which may be partially ascribed to known\nnon-linearity in the far-infrared--radio correlation at low luminosity if it\nevolves with redshift. At 24 micron, the shortfall is reduced if the\nstar-forming galaxies develop SEDs with cooler dust and correspondingly\nstronger Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features with\nincreasing redshift at a given far-infrared luminosity, but this trend may\nreverse at z>1 in order not to overproduce the sub-mm source counts. The\nresulting model compares favourably with recent BLAST results and we have\nextended the simulation database to aid the interpretation of Herschel surveys.\nSuch comparisons may also facilitate further model refinement and revised\npredictions for the SKA and its precursors.\n", "  We report spectroscopic confirmation and high-resolution infrared imaging of\na z=2.79 triply-imaged galaxy behind the Bullet Cluster. This source, a\nSpitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG), is confirmed via polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features using the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph\n(IRS) and resolved with HST WFC3 imaging. In this galaxy, which with a stellar\nmass of M*=4e9 Msun is one of the two least massive ones studied with IRS at\nz>2, we also detect H_2 S(4) and H_2 S(5) pure rotational lines (at 3.1 sigma\nand 2.1 sigma) - the first detection of these molecular hydrogen lines in a\nhigh-redshift galaxy. From the molecular hydrogen lines we infer an excitation\ntemperature T=377+68-84 K. The detection of these lines indicates that the warm\nmolecular gas mass is 6(+36-4)% of the stellar mass and implies the likely\nexistence of a substantial reservoir of cold molecular gas in the galaxy.\nFuture spectral observations at longer wavelengths with facilities like the\nHerschel Space Observatory, the Large Millimeter Telescope, and the Atacama\nPathfinder EXperiment (APEX) thus hold the promise of precisely determining the\ntotal molecular gas mass. Given the redshift, and using refined astrometric\npositions from the high resolution imaging, we also update the magnification\nestimate and derived fundamental physical properties of this system. The\npreviously published values for total infrared luminosity, star formation rate,\nand dust temperature are confirmed modulo the revised magnification; however we\nfind that PAH emission is roughly a factor of five stronger than would be\npredicted by the relations between the total infrared and PAH luminosity\nreported for SMGs and starbursts in Pope et al. (2008).\n", "  Compact stars with strong magnetic fields (magnetars) have been\nobservationally determined to have surface magnetic fields of order of\n10^{14}-10^{15} G, the implied internal field strength being several orders\nlarger. We study the equation of state and composition of dense hypernuclear\nmatter in strong magnetic fields in a range expected in the interiors of\nmagnetars. Within the non-linear Boguta-Bodmer-Walecka model we find that the\nmagnetic field has sizable influence on the properties of matter for central\nmagnetic field B \\ge 10^{17} G, in particular the matter properties become\nanisotropic. Moreover, for the central fields B \\ge 10^{18} G, the magnetized\nhypernuclear matter shows instability, which is signaled by the negative sign\nof the derivative of the pressure parallel to the field with respect to the\ndensity, and leads to vanishing parallel pressure at the critical value B_{\\rm\ncr} \\simeq 10^{19} G. This limits the range of admissible homogeneously\ndistributed fields in magnetars to fields below the critical value B_{\\rm cr}.\n", "  We seek the best size estimates of the asteroid (21) Lutetia, the direction\nof its spin axis, and its bulk density, assuming its shape is well described by\na smooth featureless triaxial ellipsoid, and to evaluate the deviations from\nthis assumption. Methods. We derive these quantities from the outlines of the\nasteroid in 307 images of its resolved apparent disk obtained with adaptive\noptics (AO) at Keck II and VLT, and combine these with recent mass\ndeterminations to estimate a bulk density. Our best triaxial ellipsoid\ndiameters for Lutetia, based on our AO images alone, are a x b x c = 132 x 101\nx 93 km, with uncertainties of 4 x 3 x 13 km including estimated systematics,\nwith a rotational pole within 5 deg. of ECJ2000 [long,lat] = [45, -7], or\nEQJ2000 [RA, DEC] = [44, +9]. The AO model fit itself has internal precisions\nof 1 x 1 x 8 km, but it is evident, both from this model derived from limited\nviewing aspects and the radius vector model given in a companion paper, that\nLutetia has significant departures from an idealized ellipsoid. In particular,\nthe long axis may be overestimated from the AO images alone by about 10 km.\nTherefore, we combine the best aspects of the radius vector and ellipsoid model\ninto a hybrid ellipsoid model, as our final result, of 124 +/- 5 x 101 +/- 4 x\n93 +/- 13 km that can be used to estimate volumes, sizes, and projected areas.\nThe adopted pole position is within 5 deg. of [long, lat] = [52, -6] or[RA DEC]\n= [52, +12]. Using two separately determined masses and the volume of our\nhybrid model, we estimate a density of 3.5 +/- 1.1 or 4.3 +/- 0.8 g cm-3 . From\nthe density evidence alone, we argue that this favors an enstatite-chondrite\ncomposition, although other compositions are formally allowed at the extremes\n(low-porosity CV/CO carbonaceous chondrite or high-porosity metallic). We\ndiscuss this in the context of other evidence.\n", "  We present ultra-deep mid-IR spectra of 48 infrared-luminous galaxies in the\nGOODS-South field obtained with the InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS) on the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. These galaxies are selected among faint infrared sources (0.14\n- 0.5 mJy at 24 um) in two redshift bins (0.76-1.05 and 1.75-2.4) to sample the\nmajor contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs.\nWe estimate redshifts for 92% of the sample using PAH and Si absorption\nfeatures. Only few of these galaxies (5% at z~1 and 12% at z~2) have their\ntotal infrared luminosity dominated by emission from AGN. The averaged mid-IR\nspectra of the z~1 LIRGs and of the z~2 ULIRGs are very similar to the averaged\nspectrum of local starbursts and HII-like ULIRGs, respectively. We find that\n6.2um PAH equivalent widths reach a plateau of ~1 um for L(24 mu) < 1E11\nL(sun). At higher luminosities, EW (6.2 mu) anti-correlates with L(24 um).\nIntriguingly, high-z ULIRGs and SMG lie above the local EW (6.2 um) - L(24 um)\nrelationship suggesting that, at a given luminosity, high-z ULIRGs have AGN\ncontributions to their dust emission lower than those of local counterparts. A\nquantitative analysis of their morphology shows that most of the luminous IR\ngalaxies have morphologies similar to those of IR-quiet galaxies at the same\nredshift. All z~2 ULIRGs of our sample are IR-excess BzK galaxies and most of\nthem have L(FIR)/L(1600A) ratios higher than those of starburst galaxies at a\ngiven UV slope. The ``IR excess'' (Daddi et al. 2007) is mostly due to strong\n7.7 um PAH emission and under-estimation of UV dust extinction. On the basis of\nthe AGN-powered L (6 um) continuum measured directly from the mid-IR spectra,\nwe estimate an average intrinsic X-ray AGN luminosity of L(2-10 keV) = (0.1 +/-\n0.6) 1E43 erg/s, a value substantially lower than the prediction by Daddi et\nal. (2007).\n", "  A set of algorithms is presented for efficient numerical calculation of the\ntime evolution of classical dynamical systems. Starting with a first\napproximation for solving the differential equations that has a \"reversible\"\ncharacter, we show how to bootstrap easily to higher order accuracy.The method,\nfirst shown for a single particle in one dimension, is then neatly extended to\nmany dimensions and many particles.\n", "  We present the results of rest-frame, UV slitless spectroscopic observations\nof a sample of 32 z~0.7 Lyman break galaxy (LBG) analogs in the COSMOS field.\nThe spectroscopic search was performed with the Solar Blind Channel (SBC) on\nHubble Space Telescope. We report the detection of leaking Lyman continuum\n(LyC) radiation from an AGN-starburst composite. While we find no direct\ndetections of LyC emission in the remainder of our sample, we achieve\nindividual lower limits (3 sigma) of the observed non-ionizing UV to LyC flux\ndensity ratios, f_{nu}(1500A)/f_{nu}(830A) of 20 to 204 (median of 73.5) and\n378.7 for the stack. Assuming an intrinsic Lyman break of 3.4 and an\nintergalactic medium (IGM) transmission of LyC photons along the line of sight\nto the galaxy of 85% we report an upper limit for the relative escape fraction\nin individual galaxies of 0.02 - 0.19 and a stacked 3 sigma upper limit of\n0.01. We find no indication of a relative escape fraction near unity as seen in\nsome LBGs at z~3. Our UV spectra achieve the deepest limits to date at any\nredshift for the escape fraction in individual sources. The contrast between\nthese z~0.7 low escape fraction LBG analogs with z~3 LBGs suggests that either\nthe processes conducive to high escape fractions are not being selected for in\nthe z<1 samples or the average escape fraction is decreasing from z~3 to z~1.\nWe discuss possible mechanisms which could affect the escape of LyC photons.\n", "  We investigate the nature of objects in a complete sample of 28 galaxies\nselected from the first sky area fully covered by ALFALFA, being well-detected\nand having HI profiles wider than 550 km/s. The selection does not use\nbrightness, morphology, or any other property derived from optical or other\nspectral bands. We investigate the degree of isolation, the morphology, and\nother properties gathered or derived from open data bases and show that some\nobjects have wide HI profiles probably because they are disturbed or are\ninteracting, or might be confused in the ALFALFA beam. We identify a sub-sample\nof 14 galaxies lacking immediate interacting neighbours and showing regular,\nsymmetric, two-horned HI profiles that we propose as candidate high-mass disk\nsystems (CHMDs).\n  We measure the net-Halpha emission from the CHMDs and combine this with\npublic multispectral data to model the global star formation (SF) properties of\neach galaxy. The Halpha observations show SFRs not higher than a few solar\nmasses per year. Simple SF models indicate that the CHMDs formed most of their\nstars almost a Hubble time ago, but most also underwent an SF event in the last\n1-10 Myrs; the young stars now produce 10 to 30% of the visible light. The\nspatial distribution of the SF-regions is compatible with recycled stellar\nejecta.\n  We calculate representative dynamical masses from 1 to $\\sim7 10^{11}$ M_sun,\nlarger by factors of 2.5 to 7.5 than the baryonic masses of the luminous stars\nand gas. We test the Tully-Fisher relation for the CHMDs and show that these\nlie below the relation defined for lower mass galaxies, i.e., that their M_dyn\nis lower than expected when extrapolating the relation from lower mass galaxies\nto higher HI line widths.\n", "  We give a brief overview of recent work examining the presence of\n$\\alpha$-clusters in light nuclei within the Skyrme-force Hartree-Fock model.\nOf special significance are investigations into $\\alpha$-chain structures in\ncarbon isotopes and $^{16}$O. Their stability and possible role in fusion\nreactions are examined in static and time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.\nWe find a new type of shape transition in collisions and a centrifugal\nstabilization of the $4\\alpha$ chain state in a limited range of angular\nmomenta. No stabilization is found for the $3\\alpha$ chain.\n", "  We have performed a heavy ion radiative capture reaction between two light\nheavy ions, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, leading to $^{28}$Si. The present experiment\nhas been performed below Coulomb barrier energies in order to reduce the phase\nspace and to try to shed light on structural effects. Obtained $\\gamma$-spectra\ndisplay a previously unobserved strong feeding of intermediate states around 11\nMeV at these energies. This new decay branch is not fully reproduced by\nstatistical nor semi-statistical decay scenarii and may imply structural\neffects. Radiative capture cross-sections are extracted from the data.\n", "  We review recent progress in numerical relativity simulations of black-hole\n(BH) spacetimes. Following a brief summary of the methods employed in the\nmodeling, we summarize the key results in three major areas of BH physics: (i)\nBHs as sources of gravitational waves (GWs), (ii) astrophysical systems\ninvolving BHs, and (iii) BHs in high-energy physics. We conclude with a list of\nthe most urgent tasks for numerical relativity in these three areas.\n", "  (Abridged) While the Swift satellite is primarily designed to study gamma-ray\nbursts, its ultraviolet and optical imaging and spectroscopy capabilities are\nalso being used for a variety of scientific programs. In this study, we use the\nUV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) instrument aboard Swift to discover 0.5<z<2 Lyman\nbreak galaxies (LBGs). UVOT has covered ~266 arcmin^2 at >60ks exposure time,\nachieving a limiting magnitude of u<24.5, in the Chandra Deep Field South\n(CDF-S). Applying UVOT near-ultraviolet color selection, we select 50\nUV-dropouts from this UVOT CDF-S data. We match the selected sources with\navailable multiwavelength data from GOODS-South, MUSYC, and COMBO-17 to\ncharacterize the spectral energy distributions for these galaxies and determine\nstellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and dust attenuations. We compare\nthese properties for LBGs selected in this paper versus z~3 LBGs and other\nCDF-S galaxies in the same redshift range (0.5<z<2), identified using\nphotometric redshift techniques. The z~1 LBGs have slightly lower stellar\nmasses compared to z~3 LBGs and slightly higher stellar masses compared to the\nz~1 CDF-S galaxies. Similarly, our sample of z~1 LBGs has SFRs (derived using\nboth ultraviolet and infrared data, where available) nearly an order of\nmagnitude lower than z~3 LBGs but slightly higher than the comparison z~1\nsample of CDF-S galaxies. We find that our z~1 UV-dropouts have A_FUV higher\nthan z~3 LBGs, but is similar to the distribution of dust attenuations in the\nother CDF-S galaxies. Using the GOODS-South multiwavelength catalog of\ngalaxies, we simulate a larger and fainter sample of LBGs to compare their\nproperties with those of the UVOT-selected LBG sample. We conclude that UVOT\ncan be useful for finding and studying the bright end of 0.5<z<2.0 LBGs.\n", "  With the quantum diffusion approach the behavior of capture cross sections\nand mean-square angular momenta of captured systems are revealed in the\nreactions with deformed and spherical nuclei at sub-barrier energies. With\ndecreasing bombarding energy under the barrier the external turning point of\nthe nucleus-nucleus potential leaves the region of short-range nuclear\ninteraction and action of friction. Because of this change of the regime of\ninteraction, an unexpected enhancement of the capture cross section is found at\nbombarding energies far below the Coulomb barrier. This effect is shown its\nworth in the dependence of mean-square angular momentum on the bombarding\nenergy. From the comparison of calculated capture cross sections and\nexperimental capture or fusion cross sections the importance of quasifission\nnear the entrance channel is demonstrated for the actinidebased reactions and\nreactions with medium-heavy nuclei at extreme sub-barrier energies.\n", "  Collisions of actinide nuclei form, during very short times of few zs\n($10^{-21}$ s), the heaviest ensembles of interacting nucleons available on\nEarth. Such collisions are used to produce super-strong electric fields by the\nhuge number of interacting protons to test spontaneous positron-electron pair\nemission (vacuum decay) predicted by the quantum electrodynamics (QED) theory.\nMulti-nucleon transfer in actinide collisions could also be used as an\nalternative way to fusion in order to produce neutron-rich heavy and superheavy\nelements thanks to inverse quasifission mechanisms. Actinide collisions are\nstudied in a dynamical quantum microscopic approach. The three-dimensional\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) code {\\textsc{tdhf3d}} is used with a full\nSkyrme energy density functional to investigate the time evolution of\nexpectation values of one-body operators, such as fragment position and\nparticle number. This code is also used to compute the dispersion of the\nparticle numbers (e.g., widths of fragment mass and charge distributions) from\nTDHF transfer probabilities, on the one hand, and using the Balian-Veneroni\nvariational principle, on the other hand. A first application to test QED is\ndiscussed. Collision times in $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U are computed to determine the\noptimum energy for the observation of the vacuum decay. It is shown that the\ninitial orientation strongly affects the collision times and reaction\nmechanism. The highest collision times predicted by TDHF in this reaction are\nof the order of $\\sim4$ zs at a center of mass energy of 1200 MeV. According to\nmodern calculations based on the Dirac equation, the collision times at\n$E_{cm}>1$ GeV are sufficient to allow spontaneous electron-positron pair\nemission from QED vacuum decay, in case of bare uranium ion collision. A second\napplication of actinide collisions to produce neutron-rich transfermiums is\ndiscussed. A new inverse quasifission mechanism associated to a specific\norientation of the nuclei is proposed to produce transfermium nuclei ($Z>100$)\nin the collision of prolate deformed actinides such as $^{232}$Th+$^{250}$Cf.\nThe collision of the tip of one nucleus with the side of the other results in a\nnucleon flux toward the latter. The probability distributions for transfermium\nproduction in such a collision are computed. The produced nuclei are more\nneutron-rich than those formed in fusion reactions, thus, leading to more\nstable isotopes closer to the predicted superheavy island of stability. In\naddition to mass and charge dispersion, the Balian-Veneroni variational\nprinciple is used to compute correlations between $Z$ and $N$ distributions,\nwhich are zero in standard TDHF calculations.\n", "  The H\\beta\\ emission line in a typical Type I quasar is composed of a broad\nbase and a narrow core, with the core velocity typical of narrow-line region\nemission, and line-fitting routines typically assume this picture. We test the\neffects of removing this constraint, and find a substantial group of Type I\nquasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog with H\\beta\\ emission line\ncores broader than 1200 km/s, above the velocity believed possible for gas in\nthe quasar narrow-line region. We identify this group of \"anomalous H\\beta\\\nquasars\" (AHQs) as a distinct population because of a variety of spectral and\nphotometric signatures common to these AHQs but atypical of other quasars.\nThese features are similar to some aspects of narrow-line Seyfert 1s and\ncorrelations identified by Eigenvector 1, but also contain distinct features\nthat make AHQs difficult to classify. We demonstrate that AHQs comprise at\nleast 11% and most likely approximately one quarter of the SDSS Type I quasar\npopulation at 0.2 < z < 0.8. For AHQs, the [O III]\\lambda 4959,5007 profile is\noften better fit by de-linking it from the H\\beta\\ core, while a more standard\nlinked fit produces a tight correlation between narrow- and broad-line\nvelocities. We find that [O III] in AHQs sometimes has a standard narrow-line\nprofile and other times matches the H\\beta core, but is rarely in between the\ntwo, implying that the broadened core emission arises from a distinct physical\nregion. Another feature of AHQs is a diminished [O II] line, which might\nindicate a connection between AHQs and the interstellar mediums of their host\ngalaxies, through reduced photoionization or star formation. We find that it is\ndifficult to produce AHQs using the current quasar standard model.\n", "  High resolution spectra are necessary to distinguish and correctly measure\nthe Balmer emission lines due to the presence of strong metal and Balmer\nabsorption features in the stellar continuum. This accurate measurement is\nnecessary for use in emission line diagnostics, such as the Balmer decrement\n(i.e. Halpha/Hbeta), used to determine the attenuation of galaxies. Yet at high\nredshifts obtaining such spectra becomes costly. Balmer emission line\nequivalent widths are much easier to measure, requiring only low resolution\nspectra or even simple narrow band filters and therefore shorter observation\ntimes. However a correction for the stellar continuum is still needed for this\nequivalent width Balmer decrement. We present here a statistical analysis of\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 emission line galaxy sample, using\nthe spectrally determined Balmer emission line fluxes and equivalent widths.\nUsing the large numbers of galaxies available in the SDSS catalogue, we\ndetermined an equivalent width Balmer decrement including a statistically-based\ncorrection for the stellar continuum. Based on this formula, the attenuation of\ngalaxies can now be obtained from low spectral resolution observations. In\naddition, this investigation also revealed an error in the Hbeta line fluxes,\nwithin the SDSS DR7 MPA/JHU catalogue, with the equivalent widths\nunderestimated by average ~0.35A in the emission line galaxy sample. This error\nmeans that Balmer decrement determined attenuations are overestimated by a\nsystematic 0.1 magnitudes in A_V, and future analyses of this sample need to\ninclude this correction.\n", "  Dissipation and fluctuations of one-body observables in heavy-ion reactions\naround the Coulomb barrier are investigated with a microscopic stochastic\nmean-field approach. By projecting the stochastic mean-field dynamics on a\nsuitable collective path, transport coefficients associated with the relative\ndistance between colliding nuclei and a fragment mass are extracted. Although\nmicroscopic mean-field approach is know to underestimate the variance of\nfragment mass distribution, the description of the variance is much improved by\nthe stochastic mean-field method. While fluctuations are consistent with the\nempirical (semiclassical) analysis of the experimental data, concerning mean\nvalues of macroscopic variables the semiclassical description breaks down below\nthe Coulomb barrier.\n", "  This is the second of two papers investigating the spherical averaging of\nellipsoidal galaxy clusters in the context of X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\nobservations. In the present study we quantify the orientation-average bias and\nscatter in observables that result from spherically averaging clusters\ndescribed by ellipsoidal generalizations of the NFW profile or a nearly\nscale-free logarithmic potential. Although the mean biases are small and mostly\n<1%, the flattest cluster models generally have a significant mean bias; i.e.,\naveraging over all orientations does not always eliminate projection biases.\nSubstantial biases can result from different viewing orientations, where the\nintegrated Compton-y parameter (Y_SZ) and the concentration have the largest\nscatter (as large as sigma ~10% for Y_SZ), and the emission-weighted\ntemperature (T_X) has the smallest (sigma < ~0.5%). The very small scatter for\nT_X leads to Y_X and M_gas having virtually the same orientation biases.\nSubstantial scatter is expected for individual clusters (up to sigma ~8%) in\nthe correlation between Y_SZ and Y_X in comparison to the small mean bias\n(sigma < ~1%) applicable to a random sample of clusters of sufficient size. For\nellipsoidal NFW models we show that the orientation bias for the total cluster\nmass attains a minimum near the radius r_2500 so that the spherically averaged\nmass computed at this radius is always within ~0.5% of the true value for any\norientation. Finally, to facilitate the accounting for orientation bias in\nX-ray and SZ cluster studies, we provide cubic polynomial approximations to the\nmean orientation bias and 1-sigma scatter for each cluster observable as a\nfunction of axial ratio for the ellipsoidal NFW models.\n", "  This is the first of two papers investigating the deprojection and spherical\naveraging of ellipsoidal galaxy clusters. We specifically consider applications\nto hydrostatic X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) studies, though many of the\nresults also apply to isotropic dispersion-supported stellar dynamical systems.\nHere we present analytical formulas for galaxy clusters described by a\ngravitational potential that is a triaxial ellipsoid of constant shape and\norientation. For this model type we show that the mass bias due to spherically\naveraging X-ray observations is independent of the temperature profile, and for\nthe special case of a scale-free logarithmic potential, there is exactly zero\nmass bias for any shape, orientation, and temperature profile. The ratio of\nspherically averaged intracluster medium (ICM) pressures obtained from SZ and\nX-ray measurements depends only on the ICM intrinsic shape, projection\norientation, and H_0, which provides another illustration of how cluster\ngeometry can be recovered through a combination of X-ray and SZ measurements.\nWe also demonstrate that Y_SZ and Y_X have different biases owing to spherical\naveraging, which leads to an offset in the spherically averaged Y_SZ - Y_X\nrelation. A potentially useful application of the analytical formulas presented\nis to assess the error range of an observable (e.g., mass, Y_SZ) accounting for\ndeviations from assumed spherical symmetry, without having to perform the\nellipsoidal deprojection explicitly. Finally, for dedicated ellipsoidal\nstudies, we also generalize the spherical onion peeling method to the triaxial\ncase for a given shape and orientation.\n", "  In this paper, we measure the optical-to-virial velocity ratios Vopt/V200c of\ndisk galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) at a mean redshift of <z>\n= 0.07 and with stellar masses 10^9 M_sun < M_* < 10^11 M_sun. Vopt/V200c, the\nratio of the circular velocity measured at the virial radius of the dark matter\nhalo (\\sim150 kpc) to that at the optical radius of the disk (\\sim10 kpc), is a\npowerful observational constraint on disk galaxy formation. It links galaxies\nto their dark matter haloes dynamically and constrains the total mass profile\nof disk galaxies over an order of magnitude in length scale. For this\nmeasurement, we combine Vopt derived from the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) from\nReyes et al. with V200c derived from halo masses measured with galaxy-galaxy\nlensing. In anticipation of this combination, we use similarly-selected galaxy\nsamples for both the lensing and TFR analysis. For three M_* bins with\nlensing-weighted mean stellar masses of 0.6, 2.7, and 6.5 x 10^10 M_sun, we\nfind halo-to-stellar mass ratios M_vir/M_* = 41, 23, and 26, with 1-sigma\nstatistical uncertainties of around 0.1 dex, and Vopt/V200c = 1.27\\pm0.08,\n1.39\\pm0.06, 1.27\\pm0.08 (1{\\sigma}). Our results suggest that the dark matter\nand baryonic contributions to the mass within the optical radius are\ncomparable, if the dark matter halo profile has not been significantly modified\nby baryons. The results obtained in this work will serve as inputs to and\nconstraints on disk galaxy formation models, which will be explored in future\nwork. Finally, we note that this paper presents a new and improved galaxy shape\ncatalogue for weak lensing that covers the full SDSS DR7 footprint.\n", "  We investigate the connection between starburst and AGN activity by comparing\nthe 3.3 {\\mu}m PAH eimission with AGN properties. Utilizing the slit-less\nspectroscopic capability of the AKARI space telescope, we observe\nmoderate-luminosity Type I AGN at z~0.4 to measure global starburst activity.\nThe 3.3 {\\mu}m PAH emissions are detected for 7 out of 26 target galaxies. We\nfind no strong correlation between the 3.3 {\\mu}m PAH emission and AGN\nluminosity in the limted range of the observed AGN luminosity, suggesting that\nglobal star formation may not be tightly related with AGN activity. Combining\nour measurements with the previous 3.3 {\\mu}m measurements of the low redshift\nType I AGN in the literature, we investigate the connection between nuclear\nstarburst and AGN activity. In contrast to global star formation, the 3.3\n{\\mu}m PAH luminosity measured from the central part of galaxies correlates\nwith AGN luminosity, implying that starburst and AGN activity are directly\nconnected at the nuclear region.\n", "  We present the results of a visual search for galaxy-scale gravitational\nlenses in nearly 7 square degrees of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The\ndataset comprises the whole imaging data ever taken with the Advanced Camera\nfor Surveys (ACS) in the filter F814W (I-band) up to August 31st, 2011, i.e.\n6.03 square degrees excluding the field of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS)\nwhich has been the subject of a separate visual search. In addition, we have\nsearched for lenses in the whole Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR imaging\ndataset in all filters (1.01 square degrees) up to the same date. Our primary\ngoal is to provide a sample of lenses with a broad range of different\nmorphologies and lens-source brightness contrast in order estimate a lower\nlimit to the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses in the future Euclid survey\nin its VIS band. Our criteria to select lenses are purely morphological as we\ndo not use any colour or redshift information.The final candidate selection is\nvery conservative hence leading to a nearly pure but incomplete sample. We find\n49 new lens candidates: 40 in the ACS images and 9 in the WFC3 images. Out of\nthese, 16 candidates are secure lenses owing to their striking morphology, 21\nmore are very good candidates, and 12 more have morphologies compatible with\ngravitational lensing but also compatible with other astrophysical objects. It\nis therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and allows to estimate the number\nof galaxy-scale strong lenses on the sky for a putative survey depth, which is\nthe main result of the present work. Because of the incompleteness of the\nsample, the estimated lensing rates should be taken as lower limits. Using\nthese, we anticipate that a 15 000 square degrees space survey such as Euclid\nwill find at least 60 000 galaxy-scale strong lenses down to a limiting AB\nmagnitude of I = 24.5 (10-sigma) or I = 25.8 (3-sigma).\n", "  We performed multi-band deep imaging of the field around GRB 050730 to\nidentify the host galaxies of intervening absorbers, which consist of a damped\nLy{\\alpha} absorption (DLA) system at zabs=3.564, a sub-DLA system at\nzabs=3.022, and strong MgII absorption systems at zabs=1.773 and 2.253. Our\nobservations were performed after the gamma-ray burst afterglow had\ndisappeared. Thus, our imaging survey has a higher sensitivity to the host\ngalaxies of the intervening absorbers than the normal imaging surveys in the\ndirection of QSOs, for which the QSO glare tends to hide the foreground\ngalaxies. In this deep imaging survey, we could not detect any unambiguous\ncandidates for the host galaxies of the intervening absorbers. Using the 3sigma\nupper limit of the flux in the optical to mid-infrared observing bands, which\ncorresponds to the UV to optical bands in the rest-frame of the intervening\nabsorbers, we constrained the star-formation rates and stellar masses of the\nhosts. We estimated the star-formation rates for the intervening absorbers as <\n2.5 Msun/yr for z>3 DLAs and < 1.0 Msun/yr for z~2 MgII systems. Their stellar\nmasses are estimated to be several times 10^9 Msun or smaller for all\nintervening galaxies. These properties are comparable to dwarf galaxies, rather\nthan the massive star-forming galaxies commonly seen in the z>2 galaxy surveys\nbased on emission-line selection or color selection.\n", "  Discrete maximum principles in the approximation of partial differential\nequations are crucial for the preservation of qualitative properties of\nphysical models. In this work we enforce the discrete maximum principle by\nperforming a simple cutoff. We show that for many problems this a posteriori\nprocedure even improves the approximation in the natural energy norm. The\nresults apply to many different kinds of approximations including conforming\nhigher order and $hp$-finite elements. Moreover in the case of finite element\napproximations there is no geometrical restriction on the partition of the\ndomain.\n", "  In this note we try to prove the absence of the ghosts in case of the general\nnon-linear massive gravity action in Stuckelberg formalism. We argue that in\norder to find the explicit form of the Hamiltonian it is natural to start with\nthe general non-linear massive gravity action found in arXiv:1106.3344\n[hep-th]. We perform the complete Hamiltonian analysis of the Stuckelberg form\nof the minimal the non-linear gravity action in this formulation and show that\nthe constraint structure is so rich that it is possible to eliminate\nnon-physical modes. Then we extend this analysis to the case of the general\nnon-linear massive gravity action. We find the corresponding Hamiltonian and\ncollection of the primary constraints. Unfortunately we are not able to finish\nthe complete analysis of the stability of all constraints due to the complex\nform of one primary constraint so that we are not able to determine the\nconditions under which given constraint is preserved during the time evolution\nof the system.\n", "  We have studied the dependence of the AGN nuclear radio (1.4 GHz) luminosity\non both the AGN 2-10 keV X-ray and the host-galaxy K-band luminosity. A\ncomplete sample of 1268 X-ray selected AGN (both type 1 and type 2) has been\nused, which is the largest catalogue of AGN belonging to statistically well\ndefined samples where radio, X and K band information exists. At variance with\nprevious studies, radio upper limits have been statistically taken into account\nusing a Bayesian Maximum Likelihood fitting method. It resulted that a good fit\nis obtained assuming a plane in the 3D L_R-L_X-L_K space, namely logL_R= xi_X\nlogL_X + xi_K logL_K + xi_0, having a ~1 dex wide (1 sigma) spread in radio\nluminosity. As already shown, no evidence of bimodality in the radio luminosity\ndistribution was found and therefore any definition of radio loudness in AGN is\narbitrary. Using scaling relations between the BH mass and the host galaxy\nK-band luminosity, we have also derived a new estimate of the BH fundamental\nplane (in the L_5GHz -L_X-M_BH space). Our analysis shows that previous\nmeasures of the BH fundamental plane are biased by ~0.8 dex in favor of the\nmost luminous radio sources. Therefore, many AGN studies, where the BH\nfundamental plane is used to investigate how AGN regulate their radiative and\nmechanical luminosity as a function of the accretion rate, or many AGN/galaxy\nco-evolution models, where radio-feedback is computed using the AGN fundamental\nplane, should revise their conclusions.\n", "  At first glance, it seems possible to construct in general relativity theory\ncausality violating solutions. The most striking one is the Gott spacetime. Two\ncosmic strings, approaching each other with high velocity, could produce closed\ntimelike curves. It was quickly recognized that this solution violates physical\nboundary conditions. The effective one particle generator becomes hyperbolic,\nso the center of mass is tachyonic. On a 5-dimensional warped spacetime, it\nseems possible to get an elliptic generator, so no obstruction is encountered\nand the velocity of the center of mass of the effective particle has an overlap\nwith the Gott region. So a CTC could, in principle, be constructed. However,\nfrom the effective 4D field equations on the brane, which are influenced by the\nprojection of the bulk Weyl tensor on the brane, it follows that no asymptotic\nconical space time is found, so no angle deficit as in the 4D counterpart\nmodel. This could also explain why we do not observe cosmic strings.\n", "  The apparent random outcome of a quantum measurement is conjectured to be\nfundamentally determined by the microscopic state of the macroscopic\nmeasurement apparatus. The apparatus state thus plays the role of a hidden\nvariable which, in contrast with variables characterizing the measured\nmicroscopic system, is shown to lead to a violation of Bell's inequalities and\nto agree with standard quantum mechanics. An explicit realization of this\ninterpretation is proposed for a primitive model of measurement apparatus\ninspired by Mott: in the case of an alpha-particle spherical-wave detection in\na cloud chamber, the direction of the observed linear track is conjectured to\nbe determined by the position of the atoms of the gas filling the chamber.\nUsing a stationary-state coupled-channel Born expansion, a reduction of the\nspherical wave function is shown to be necessary to compensate the flux loss\ndue to scattering on the chamber atoms. Being highly non local, this\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics is finally argued to open the way to\nfaster-than-light information transfer.\n", "  We compare the effects of Noncommutative Geometry and Gravity's Rainbow on\ntraversable wormholes which are sustained by their own gravitational quantum\nfluctuations. Fixing the geometry on a well tested model, we find that the\nfinal result shows that the wormhole is of the Planckian size. This means that\nthe traversability of the wormhole is in principle, but not in practice.\n", "  This talk discusses various aspects of the structure of space-time presenting\nmechanisms leading to the explanation of the \"rigidity\" of the manifold and to\nthe emergence of time, i.e. of the Lorentzian signature. The proposed\ningredient is the analog, in four dimensions, of the deformation energy\nassociated with the common threedimensional elasticity theory. The inclusion of\nthis additional term in the Lagrangian of empty space-time accounts for gravity\nas an emergent feature from the microscopic structure of space-time. Once time\nhas legitimately been introduced, a global positioning method based on local\nmeasurements of proper times between the arrivals of electromagnetic pulses\nfrom independent distant sources is presented. The method considers both\npulsars as well as artificial emitters located on celestial bodies of the solar\nsystem as pulsating beacons to be used for navigation and positioning.\n", "  Arrows of time - thermodynamical, cosmological, electromagnetic, quantum\nmechanical, psychological - are basic properties of Nature. For a quantum\nsystem-bath closed system the de-correlated initial conditions and no-memory\n(Markovian) dynamics are outlined as necessary conditions for the appearance of\nthe thermodynamical arrow. The emergence of the arrow for the system evolving\naccording to non-unitary dynamics due to the presence of the bath, then, is a\nresult of limited observability, and we conjecture the arrow in the observable\nUniverse as determined by the dark sector acting as a bath. The voids in the\nlarge scale matter distribution induce hyperbolicity of the null geodesics,\nwith possible observational consequences.\n", "  We show that the hierarchically small mu term in supersymmetric theories is a\nconsequence of two identical pairs of Higgs doublets taking a democratic form\nfor their mass matrix. We briefly discuss the discrete symmetry S2xS2 toward\nthe democratic mass matrix. Then, we show that there results an approximate\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry and hence the value mu is related to the axion decay\nconstant.\n", "  We present a general discussion about the so-called emergent properties and\ndiscuss whether space-time and gravity can be regarded as emergent features of\nunderlying more fundamental structures. Finally, we discuss some ideas about\nthe multiverse, and speculate on how our universe might arise from the\nmultiverse.\n", "  The paradigm of \\Lambda CDM cosmology works impressively well and with the\nconcept of inflation it explains the universe after the time of decoupling.\nHowever there are still a few concerns; after much effort there is no detection\nof dark matter and there are significant problems in the theoretical\ndescription of dark energy. We will consider a variant of the cosmological\nspherical shell model, within FRW formalism and will compare it with the\nstandard \\Lambda CDM model. We will show that our new topological model\nsatisfies cosmological principles and is consistent with all observable data,\nbut that it may require new interpretation for some data. Considered will be\nconstraints imposed on the model, as for instance the range for the size and\nallowed thickness of the shell, by the supernovae luminosity distance and CMB\ndata. In this model propagation of the light is confined along the shell, which\nhas as a consequence that observed CMB originated from one point or a limited\nspace region. It allows to interpret the uniformity of the CMB without\ninflation scenario. In addition this removes any constraints on the uniformity\nof the universe at the early stage and opens a possibility that the universe\nwas not uniform and that creation of galaxies and large structures is due to\nthe inhomogeneities that originated in the Big Bang.\n", "  Time has always played a crucial role in cosmology. I review some of the\naspects of the present cosmological model which are more directly related to\ntime, such as: the definition of a cosmic time; the existence of typical\ntimescales and epochs in an expanding universe; the problem of the initial\nsingularity and the origin of time; the cosmological arrow of time.\n", "  Circumstellar disc evolution is paramount for the understanding of planet\nformation. The GASPS program aims at determining the circumstellar gas and\nsolid mass around ~250 pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae and TTauri stars. We aim to\nunderstand the origin and nature of the circumstellar matter orbiting 51 Oph, a\nyoung (<1 Myr) luminous B9.5 star. We obtained continuum and line observations\nwith the PACS instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory and continuum\ndata at 1.2 mm with the IRAM 30m telescope. The SED and line fluxes were\nmodelled using the physico-chemo radiative transfer code ProDiMo. We detected a\nstrong emission by OI at 63 microns using the Herschel Space Observatory. The\n[OI] emission at 145 microns, the [CII] emission at 158 microns, the high-J CO\nemissions, and the warm water emissions were not detected. Continuum emission\nwas detected at 1.2 mm. The continuum from the near- to the far-infrared and\nthe [OI] emission are well explained by the emission from a compact hydrostatic\ndisc model with a gas mass of 5E-6 MSun, 100 times that of the solid mass.\nHowever, this model fails to match the continuum millimeter flux, which hints\nat a cold outer disc with a mass in solids of 1E-6 MSun or free-free emission\nfrom a photoevaporative disc wind. This outer disc can either be devoid of gas\nand/or is to cold to emit in the [OI] line. A very flat extended disc model\n(Rout=400 AU) with a fixed vertical structure and dust settling matches all\nphotometric points and most of the [O I] flux. The observations can be\nexplained by an extended flat disc where dust grains have settled. However, a\nflat gas disc cannot be reproduced by hydrostatic disc models. The low mass of\nthe 51 Oph inner disc in gas and dust may be explained either by the fast\ndissipation of an initial massive disc or by a very small initial disc mass.\n", "  We apply one of lazy learning methods named k-nearest neighbor algorithm\n(kNN) to estimate the photometric redshifts of quasars, based on various\ndatasets from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky\nSurvey (UKIDSS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) (the SDSS\nsample, the SDSS-UKIDSS sample, the SDSS-WISE sample and the SDSS-UKIDSS-WISE\nsample). The influence of the k value and different input patterns on the\nperformance of kNN is discussed. kNN arrives at the best performance when k is\ndifferent with a special input pattern for a special dataset. The best result\nbelongs to the SDSS-UKIDSS-WISE sample. The experimental results show that\ngenerally the more information from more bands, the better performance of\nphotometric redshift estimation with kNN. The results also demonstrate that kNN\nusing multiband data can effectively solve the catastrophic failure of\nphotometric redshift estimation, which is met by many machine learning methods.\nBy comparing the performance of various methods for photometric redshift\nestimation of quasars, kNN based on KD-Tree shows its superiority with the best\naccuracy for our case.\n", "  Is time travel possible? What is Einstein's theory of relativity\nmathematically predicting in that regard? Is time travel related to the\nso-called clock 'paradoxes' of relativity and if so how? Is there any accurate\nexperimental evidence of the phenomena regarding the different flow of time\npredicted by General Relativity and is there any possible application of the\ntemporal phenomena predicted by relativity to our everyday life? Which temporal\nphenomena are predicted in the vicinities of a rotating body and of a\nmass-energy current, and do we have any experimental test of the occurrence of\nthese phenomena near a rotating body? In this paper, we address and answer some\nof these questions.\n", "  The ALHAMBRA (Advance Large Homogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift\nAstronomical) survey has observed 8 different regions of the sky, including\nsections of the COSMOS, DEEP2, ELAIS, GOODS-N, SDSS and Groth fields using a\nnew photometric system with 20 contiguous ~ $300\\AA$ filters covering the\noptical range, combining them with deep $JHKs$ imaging. The observations,\ncarried out with the Calar Alto 3.5m telescope using the wide field (0.25 sq.\ndeg FOV) optical camera LAICA and the NIR instrument Omega-2000, correspond to\n~700hrs on-target science images. The photometric system was designed to\nmaximize the effective depth of the survey in terms of accurate spectral-type\nand photo-zs estimation along with the capability of identification of\nrelatively faint emission lines. Here we present multicolor photometry and\nphoto-zs for ~438k galaxies, detected in synthetic F814W images, complete down\nto I~24.5 AB, taking into account realistic noise estimates, and correcting by\nPSF and aperture effects with the ColorPro software. The photometric ZP have\nbeen calibrated using stellar transformation equations and refined internally,\nusing a new technique based on the highly robust photometric redshifts measured\nfor emission line galaxies. We calculate photometric redshifts with the BPZ2\ncode, which includes new empirically calibrated templates and priors. Our\nphoto-zs have a precision of $dz/(1+z_s)=1%$ for I<22.5 and 1.4% for\n22.5<I<24.5. Precisions of less than 0.5% are reached for the brighter\nspectroscopic sample, showing the potential of medium-band photometric surveys.\nThe global $P(z)$ shows a mean redshift <z>=0.56 for I<22.5 AB and <z>=0.86 for\nI<24.5 AB. The data presented here covers an effective area of 2.79 sq. deg,\nsplit into 14 strips of 58.5'x15.5' and represents ~32 hrs of on-target.\n", "  The internal state of a composite particle and its transformation, when\nchanging from the reference frame, where this composite particle is at rest, to\na reference frame, where it moves relativistically, have been considered. It is\nsupposed that the internal state of the composite particle in its rest frame\ncan be considered in the non-relativistic approximation. This internal state is\nshown to remain the same, when changing from one inertial reference frame to\nanother one. In other words, a particle that is spherically symmetric in its\nrest frame does not change its form in any other reference frame and does not\nundergo the Lorentz contraction in the direction of motion of any reference\nframe with respect to the rest one. A possible application of the results\nobtained to describe the scattering of hadrons considered as bound states of\nquarks has been discussed.\n", "  We constrain two non-flat time-evolving dark energy cosmological models by\nusing Hubble parameter data, Type Ia supernova apparent magnitude measurements,\nand baryonic acoustic oscillation peak length scale observations. The inclusion\nof space curvature as a free parameter in the analysis results in a significant\nbroadening of the allowed range of values of the parameter that governs the\ntime evolution of the dark energy density in these models. While consistent\nwith the \"standard\" spatially-flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, these data\nare also consistent with a range of mildly non-flat, slowly time-varying dark\nenergy models. After marginalizing over all other parameters, these data\nrequire the averaged magnitude of the curvature density parameter\n$|\\Omega_{k0}| \\lesssim 0.15$ at 1$\\sigma$ confidence.\n", "  We report a detailed three-step roadmap for the fabrication and\ncharacterization of bulk Cr tips for spin-polarized scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy. Our strategy uniquely circumvents the need for ultra-high vacuum\npreparation of clean surfaces or films. First, we demonstrate the role of\n$ex$-$situ$ electrochemical etch parameters on Cr tip apex geometry, using\nscanning electron micrographs of over 70 etched tips. Second, we describe the\nsuitability of the $in$-$situ$ cleaved surface of the layered antiferromagnet\nLa$_{1.4}$Sr$_{1.6}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ to evaluate the spin characteristics of the Cr\ntip, replacing the UHV-prepared test samples that have been used in prior\nstudies. Third, we outline a statistical algorithm that can effectively\ndelineate closely-spaced or irregular cleaved step edges, to maximize the\naccuracy of step height and spin-polarization measurements.\n", "  The gas-phase and stellar metallicities have proven to be important\nparameters to constrain the star formation history of galaxies. However, HII\nregions associated with recent star-formation may not have abundances typical\nfor the galaxy as a whole and it is believed that the bulk of the metals may be\ncontained in the neutral gas. It is therefore important to directly probe the\nmetal abundances in the neutral gas, which can be done by using absorption\nlines imprinted on a background quasar. Recently, we have presented studies of\nthe stellar content of a small sample of such quasar absorbers with HI column\ndensities measured to be in the sub-Damped Lyman-alpha to Damped Lyman-alpha\nrange. Here, we present observations covering 300 nm to 2.5 microns of emission\nline spectra of three of these absorbing-galaxies using the long-slit\nspectrograph X-Shooter on the VLT. This allows us to compare the neutral and\nionised phase metallicities in the same objects and relates these measures to\npossible signature of low-metallicity gas accretion or outflows of gas enriched\nby star formation. Our results suggest that the abundances derived in\nabsorption along the line-of-sight to background quasars are reliable measures\nof the overall galaxy metallicities. In addition to a comparison of abundances\nin different phases of the gas, a potential observational consequence of\ndifferences in fueling mechanisms for disc galaxies is the internal\ndistribution of their chemical abundances. We present some evidence for small\nnegative metallicity gradients in the three systems. The flat slopes are in\nline with the differences observed between the two phases of the gas. These\nresults suggest that a comparison of the HI and HII metallicities is a robust\nindicator of abundance gradients in high-redshift galaxies and do not favour\nthe presence of infall of fresh gas in these objects.\n", "  The general Ginzburg-Landau formulation of a holographic superconductor is\ndeveloped near the transition temperature in the probe limit for two kinds of\nconformal dimension. Below the transition temperature, $T<T_c$, the\norder-parameter scales with $\\sqrt{1-\\frac{T}{T_c}}$ as expected. The G-L free\nenergy in grand caonnical ensemble and canonical ensemble are derived and the\ngradient term is studied. Furthermore this scaling coefficient of\norder-parameter takes different values in the grand canonical ensemble and the\ncanonical ensemble, suggesting the strong coupling nature of the boundary field\ntheory of the superconductiviy.\n", "  It is proposed that the recently announced BICEP2 value of tensor-to scalar\nratio $r\\sim0.2$ can be explained as containing an extra contribution from the\nrecent acceleration of the universe. In fact this contribution, being robust,\nrecent and of much longer duration (by a large order of magnitude) may dominate\nthe contribution from the inflationary origin. In a possible scenario, matter\n(dark or baryonic) and radiation etc. can emerge from a single Higgs-like\ntachyonic scalar field in the universe through a physical mechanism not yet\nfully known to us. The components interact among themselves to achieve the\nthermodynamical equilibrium in the evolution of the universe. The field\npotential for the present acceleration of the universe would give a boost to\nthe amplitude of the tensor fluctuations of gravity waves generated by the\nearly inflation and the net effects may be higher than the earlier PLANCK\nbounds. In the process, the dark energy, as a cosmological constant decays into\ncreation of dark matter. The diagnostics for the three-component, spatially\nhomogeneous tachyonic scalar field are discussed in detail. The components of\nthe field with perturbed equation of state are taken to interact mutually and\nthe conservation of energy for individual components gets violated. We study\nmainly the $O_{m}(x)$ diagnostics with the observed set of $H(z)$ values at\nvarious redshifts, and the dimensionless state-finders for these interacting\ncomponents. This analysis provides a strong case for the interacting dark\nenergy in our model.\n", "  We study the properties of gravitational system in finite regions bounded by\ngravitational screens. We present the detail construction of the total energy\nof such regions and of the energy and momentum balance equations due to the\nflow of matter and gravitational radiation through the screen. We establish\nthat the gravitational screen possesses analogs of surface tension, internal\nenergy and viscous stress tensor, while the conservations are analogs of\nnon-equilibrium balance equations for a viscous system. This gives a precise\ncorrespondence between gravity in finite regions and non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics.\n", "  Several years ago, M. Asplund and coauthors (2004) proposed a revision of the\nSolar composition. The use of this new prescription for Solar abundances in\nstandard stellar models generated a strong disagreement between the predictions\nand the observations of Solar observables. Many claimed that the Standard Solar\nModel (SSM) was faulty, and more specifically the opacities used in such\nmodels. As a result, activities around the stellar opacities were boosted. New\nexperiments (J. Bailey at Sandia on Z-Pinch, The OPAC consortium at LULI200) to\nmeasure directly absorbtion coefficients have been realized or are underway.\nSeveral theoretical groups (CEA-OPAS, Los Alamos Nat. Lab., CEA-SCORCG, The\nOpacity Project - The Iron Project (IPOPv2)) have started new sets of\ncalculations using different approaches and codes. While the new results seem\nto confirm the good quality of the opacities used in SSM, it remains important\nto improve and complement the data currently available. We present recent\nresults in the case of the photoionization cross sections for Ni XIV (Ni13+ )\nfrom IPOPv2 and possible implications on stellar modelling.\n", "  We present the results from a 1.1 mm imaging survey of the SSA22 field, known\nfor having an overdensity of z=3.1 Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs), taken\nwith the AzTEC camera on the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE).\nWe imaged a 950 arcmin$^2$ field down to a 1 sigma sensitivity of 0.7-1.3\nmJy/beam to find 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) with a signal to noise ratio\n>= 3.5. Counterpart identification using radio and near/mid-infrared data was\nperformed and one or more counterpart candidates were found for 59 SMGs.\nPhotometric redshifts based on optical to near-infrared images were evaluated\nfor 45 SMGs of these SMGs with Spitzer/IRAC data, and the median value is found\nto be z=2.4. By combining these estimation with estimates from the literature\nwe determined that 10 SMGs might lie within the large-scale structure at z=3.1.\nThe two-point angular cross-correlation function between LAEs and SMGs\nindicates that the positions of the SMGs are correlated with the z=3.1\nprotocluster. These results suggest that the SMGs were formed and evolved\nselectively in the high dense environment of the high redshift universe. This\npicture is consistent with the predictions of the standard model of\nhierarchical structure formation.\n", "  In this paper we present an exact general analytic expression\n$Z(sSFR)=y/\\Lambda(sSFR)+I(sSFR)$ linking the gas metallicity Z to the specific\nstar formation rate (sSFR), that validates and extends the approximate relation\nput forward by Lilly et al. (2013, L13), where $y$ is the yield per stellar\ngeneration, $\\Lambda(sSFR)$ is the instantaneous ratio between inflow and star\nformation rate expressed as a function of the sSFR, and $I$ is the integral of\nthe past enrichment history, respectively. We then demonstrate that the\ninstantaneous metallicity of a self-regulating system, such that its sSFR\ndecreases with decreasing redshift, can be well approximated by the first term\non the right-hand side in the above formula, which provides an upper bound to\nthe metallicity. The metallicity is well approximated also by the L13 ideal\nregulator case, which provides a lower bound to the actual metallicity. We\ncompare these approximate analytic formulae to numerical results and infer a\ndiscrepancy <0.1 dex in a range of metallicities and almost three orders of\nmagnitude in the sSFR. We explore the consequences of the L13 model on the\nmass-weighted metallicity in the stellar component of the galaxies. We find\nthat the stellar average metallicity lags 0.1-0.2 dex behind the gas-phase\nmetallicity relation, in agreement with the data. (abridged)\n", "  We present the rest-frame UV wavelength dependence of the Petrosian-like\nhalf-light radius ($r_{50}$), and the concentration parameter for a sample of\n198 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 < z < 1.5. We find a ~5% decrease in $r_{50}$\nfrom 1500 \\AA\\ to 3000 \\AA, with half-light radii at 3000 \\AA\\ ranging from 0.6\nkpc to 6 kpc. We also find a decrease in concentration of ~0.07 (1.9 <\n$C_{3000}$ < 3.9). The lack of a strong relationship between $r_{50}$ and\nwavelength is consistent with a model in which clumpy star formation is\ndistributed over length scales comparable to the galaxy's rest-frame optical\nlight. While the wavelength dependence of $r_{50}$ is independent of size at\nall redshifts, concentration decreases more sharply in the far-UV (~1500 \\AA)\nfor large galaxies at z ~ 1. This decrease in concentration is caused by a\nflattening of the inner ~20% of the light profile in disk-like galaxies,\nindicating that the central regions have different UV colors than the rest of\nthe galaxy. We interpret this as a bulge component with older stellar\npopulations and/or more dust. The size-dependent decrease in concentration is\nless dramatic at z ~ 2, suggesting that bulges are less dusty, younger, and/or\nless massive than the rest of the galaxy at higher redshifts.\n", "  The Problem of Time (PoT) is a multi-faceted conceptual incompatibility\nbetween various areas of Theoretical Physics. Whilst usually stated as between\nGR and QM, in fact 8/9ths of it is already present at the classical level. Thus\nwe adopt a `top-down' classical and then quantum approach. I consider a local\nresolution to the Problem of Time that is Machian, which was previously\nrealized for relational triangle and minisuperspace models. This resolution has\nthree levels: classical, semiclassical and combined\nsemiclassical-histories-records. This article's specific model is a slightly\ninhomogeneous cosmology considered for now at the classical level. This is\nmotivated by how the inhomogeneous fluctuations that underlie structure\nformation - galaxies and CMB hotspots - might have been seeded by quantum\ncosmological fluctuations, as magnified by some inflationary mechanism. In\nparticular, I consider the perturbations about $S^3$ case of this involving up\nto second order, which has a number of parallels with the Halliwell-Hawking\nmodel but has a number of conceptual differences and useful upgrades. The\narticle's main features are that the elimination part of the model's thin\nsandwich is straightforward, but the modewise split of the constraints fail to\nbe first-class constraints. Thus the elimination part only arises as an\nintermediate geometry between superspace and Riem. The reduced geometries have\nsurprising singularities influenced by the matter content of the universe,\nthough the N-body problem anticipates these with its collinear singularities. I\nalso give a `basis set' of Kuchar beables for this model arena.\n", "  The Cold Spot (CS) is a clear feature in the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB); it could be of primordial origin, or caused by a intervening structure\nalong the line of sight. We identified a large projected underdensity in the\nrecently constructed WISE-2MASS all-sky infrared galaxy catalogue aligned with\nthe Cold Spot direction at $(l,b)\\approx(209^\\circ,-57^\\circ)$. It has an\nangular size of tens of degrees, and shows a $\\sim20\\%$ galaxy underdensity in\nthe center. Moreover, we find another large underdensity in the projected\nWISE-2MASS galaxy map at $(l,b)\\approx(101^\\circ,46^\\circ)$ (hereafter Draco\nSupervoid), also aligned with a CMB decrement, although less significant than\nthat of the CS direction. Motivated by these findings, we develop spherically\nsymmetric Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) compensated void models to explain the\nobserved CMB decrements with these two underdensities, or \"supervoids\". Within\nour perturbative treatment of the LTB voids, we find that the Integrated\nSachs-Wolfe and Riess-Sciama effects due to the Draco Supervoid can account for\nthe CMB decrement observed in the same direction. On the contrary, the\nextremely deep CMB decrement in the CS direction is more difficult to explain\nby the presence of the CS supervoid only. Nevertheless, the probability of a\nrandom alignment between the CS and the corresponding supervoid is disfavored,\nand thus its contribution as a secondary anisotropy cannot be neglected. We\ncomment on how the approximations used in this paper, in particular the\nassumption of spherical symmetry, could change quantitatively our conclusions\nand might provide a better explanation for the CMB CS.\n", "  We present the results of a pilot XMM-$Newton$ and $Chandra$ program aimed at\nstudying the diffuse intragroup medium (DIM) of optically-selected nearby\ngroups from the Zurinch ENvironmental Study (ZENS) catalog. The groups are in a\nnarrow mass range about $10^{13}M_\\odot$, a mass scale at which the interplay\nbetween the DIM and the group member galaxies is still largely unprobed. X-ray\nemission from the DIM is detected in the energy band 0.5--2 keV with flux $\\le\n10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, which is one order of magnitude fainter than\nfor typical ROSAT groups (RASS). For many groups we set upper limits to the\nX-ray luminosity, indicating that the detections are likely probing the upper\nenvelope of the X-ray emitting groups. We find evidence for our optically\nselected groups to be under-luminous with respect to predictions from X-ray\nscaling relations. X-ray mass determinations are in best agreement with those\nbased on the member galaxies bulge luminosity, followed by their total optical\nluminosity and velocity dispersion. We measure a stellar mass fraction with a\nmedian value of about 1$\\%$, with a contribution from the most massive galaxies\nbetween 30 to 50 \\%. Optical and X-ray data give often complementary answers\nconcerning the dynamical state of the groups, and are essential for a complete\npicture of the system. Extending this pilot program to a larger sample of\ngroups is mandatory to unveil any imprint of interaction between member\ngalaxies and DIM in halo potentials of key importance for\nenvironmentally-driven galactic evolution.\n", "  We consider higher derivative corrections to the graviton three-point\ncoupling within a weakly coupled theory of gravity. Lorentz invariance allows\nfurther structures beyond the one present in the Einstein theory. We argue that\nthese are constrained by causality. We devise a thought experiment involving a\nhigh energy scattering process which leads to causality violation if the\ngraviton three-point vertex contains the additional structures. This violation\ncannot be fixed by adding conventional particles with spins $J \\leq 2$. But, it\ncan be fixed by adding an infinite tower of extra massive particles with higher\nspins, $J > 2$. In AdS theories this implies a constraint on the conformal\nanomaly coefficients $\\left|{a - c \\over c} \\right| \\lesssim {1 \\over\n\\Delta_{gap}^2}$ in terms of $\\Delta_{gap}$, the dimension of the lightest\nsingle particle operator with spin $J > 2$. For inflation, or de Sitter-like\nsolutions, it indicates the existence of massive higher spin particles if the\ngravity wave non-gaussianity deviates significantly from the one computed in\nthe Einstein theory.\n", "  We discuss various applications of VIDE, the Void IDentification and\nExamination toolkit, an open-source Python/C++ code for finding cosmic voids in\ngalaxy redshift surveys and N-body simulations. Based on a substantially\nenhanced version of ZOBOV, VIDE not only finds voids, but also summarizes their\nproperties, extracts statistical information, and provides a Python-based\nplatform for more detailed analysis, such as manipulating void catalogs and\nparticle members, filtering, plotting, computing clustering statistics,\nstacking, comparing catalogs, and fitting density profiles. VIDE also provides\nsignificant additional functionality for pre-processing inputs: for example,\nVIDE can work with volume- or magnitude-limited galaxy samples with arbitrary\nsurvey geometries, or dark matter particles or halo catalogs in a variety of\ncommon formats. It can also randomly subsample inputs and includes a Halo\nOccupation Distribution model for constructing mock galaxy populations. VIDE\nhas been used for a wide variety of applications, from discovering a universal\ndensity profile to estimating primordial magnetic fields, and is publicly\navailable at http://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public and\nhttp://www.cosmicvoids.net.\n", "  This short note is devoted to the Hamiltonian analysis of the Unimodular\nGravity.We treat the unimodular gravity as General Relativity action with the\nunimodular constraint imposed with the help of Lagrange multiplier. We perform\nthe canonical analysis of the resulting theory and determine its constraint\nstructure.\n", "  We use properties of void populations identified in N-body simulations to\nforecast the ability of upcoming galaxy surveys to differentiate models of f(R)\ngravity from \\Lambda CDM cosmology. We analyze simulations designed to mimic\nthe densities, volumes, and clustering statistics of upcoming surveys, using\nthe public VIDE toolkit. We examine void abundances as a basic probe at\nredshifts 1.0 and 0.4. We find that stronger f(R) coupling strengths produce\nvoids up to ~20% larger in radius, leading to a significant shift in the void\nnumber function. As an initial estimate of the constraining power of voids, we\nuse this change in the number function to forecast a constraint on the coupling\nstrength of $\\Delta f_{R_{0}} = 10^{-5}$.\n", "  The intergalactic medium (IGM) accounts for ~90% of baryons at all epochs and\nyet its three dimensional distribution in the cosmic web remains mostly\nunknown. This is so because the only feasible way to observe the bulk of the\nIGM is through intervening absorption line systems in the spectra of bright\nbackground sources, which limits its characterization to being one-dimensional.\nStill, an averaged three dimensional picture can be obtained by combining and\ncross-matching multiple one-dimensional IGM information with three-dimensional\ngalaxy surveys. Here, we present our recent and current efforts to map and\ncharacterize the IGM in the cosmic web using galaxies as tracers of the\nunderlying mass distribution. In particular, we summarize our results on: (i)\nIGM around star-forming and non-star-forming galaxies; (ii) IGM within and\naround galaxy voids; and (iii) IGM in intercluster filaments. With these\ndatasets, we can directly test the modern paradigm of structure formation and\nevolution of baryonic matter in the Universe.\n", "  The crystal structures of Ni$X_2$(pyz)$_2$ ($X$ = Cl (\\textbf{1}), Br\n(\\textbf{2}), I (\\textbf{3}) and NCS (\\textbf{4})) were determined at 298~K by\nsynchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. All four compounds consist of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) square arrays self-assembled from octahedral NiN$_4$$X_2$\nunits that are bridged by pyz ligands. The 2D layered motifs displayed by\n\\textbf{1}-\\textbf{4} are relevant to bifluoride-bridged\n[Ni(HF$_2$)(pyz)$_2$]$Z$F$_6$ ($Z$ = P, Sb) which also possess the same 2D\nlayers. In contrast, terminal $X$ ligands occupy axial positions in\n\\textbf{1}-\\textbf{4} and cause a staggering of adjacent layers. Long-range\nantiferromagnetic order occurs below 1.5 (Cl), 1.9 (Br and NCS) and 2.5~K (I)\nas determined by heat capacity and muon-spin relaxation. The single-ion\nanisotropy and $g$ factor of \\textbf{2}, \\textbf{3} and \\textbf{4} are measured\nby electron spin resonance where no zero--field splitting was found. The\nmagnetism of \\textbf{1}-\\textbf{4} crosses a spectrum from\nquasi-two-dimensional to three-dimensional antiferromagnetism. An excellent\nagreement was found between the pulsed-field magnetization, magnetic\nsusceptibility and $T_\\textrm{N}$ of \\textbf{2} and \\textbf{4}. Magnetization\ncurves for \\textbf{2} and \\textbf{4} calculated by quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulation also show excellent agreement with the pulsed-field data. \\textbf{3}\nis characterized as a three-dimensional antiferromagnet with the interlayer\ninteraction ($J_\\perp$) slightly stronger than the interaction within the\ntwo-dimensional [Ni(pyz)$_2$]$^{2+}$ square planes ($J_\\textrm{pyz}$).\n", "  The hydrogen Ly$\\alpha$ forest is an important probe of the $z>2$ Universe\nthat is otherwise challenging to observe with galaxy redshift surveys, but this\ntechnique has traditionally been limited to 1D studies in front of bright\nquasars. However, by pushing to faint magnitudes ($g>23$) with 8-10m large\ntelescopes it becomes possible to exploit the high area density of\nhigh-redshift star-forming galaxies to create 3D tomographic maps of\nlarge-scale structure in the foreground. I describe the first pilot\nobservations using this technique, as well discuss future surveys and the\nresulting science possibilities for galaxy evolution and cosmology.\n", "  In this paper, a cosmological solution to Mimetic Dark Matter (MDM) for an\nexponential potential is provided. Then, a solution for the $0-i$ perturbed\nEinstein's differential equation of MDM is obtained based on an exponential\npotential that satisfies inflation for some initial conditions. Another general\npotential is suggested that incorporates inflation too. Then, quantum\nperturbations are included. The constants in the model can be tuned to be in\nagreement with the amplitude fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) radiation. Finally, the spectral index is calculated for the suggested\npotentials. Moreover, MDM is shown to be a viable model to produce dark matter,\ninflation, and CMB's fluctuation.\n", "  We consider a mixture of a two-component Fermi gas and a single-component\ndipolar Bose gas in a square optical lattice and reduce it into an effective\nFermi system where the Fermi-Fermi interaction includes the attractive\ninteraction induced by the phonons of a uniform dipolar Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. Focusing on this effective Fermi system in the parameter regime\nthat preserves the symmetry of $D_4$, the point group of a square, we explore,\nwithin the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field theory, the phase competition\namong density wave orderings and superfluid pairings. We construct the matrix\nrepresentation of the linearized gap equation in the irreducible\nrepresentations of $D_4$. We show that in the weak coupling regime, each matrix\nelement, which is a four-dimensional (4D) integral in momentum space, can be\nput in a separable form involving a 1D integral, which is only a function of\ntemperature and the chemical potential, and a pairing-specific \"effective\"\ninteraction, which is an analytical function of the parameters that\ncharacterize the Fermi-Fermi interactions in our system. We analyze the\ncritical temperatures of various competing orders as functions of different\nsystem parameters in both the absence and presence of the dipolar interaction.\nWe find that close to half filling, the d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave pairing with a\ncritical temperature in the order of a fraction of Fermi energy (at half\nfilling) may dominate all other phases, and at a higher filling factor, the\np-wave pairing with a critical temperature in the order of a hundredth of Fermi\nenergy may emerge as a winner. We find that tuning a dipolar interaction can\ndramatically enhance the pairings with $d_{xy}$- and g-wave symmetries but not\nenough for them to dominate other competing phases.\n", "  Euclid is the next ESA mission devoted to cosmology. It aims at observing\nmost of the extragalactic sky, studying both gravitational lensing and\nclustering over $\\sim$15,000 square degrees. The mission is expected to be\nlaunched in year 2020 and to last six years. The sheer amount of data of\ndifferent kinds, the variety of (un)known systematic effects and the complexity\nof measures require efforts both in sophisticated simulations and techniques of\ndata analysis. We review the mission main characteristics, some aspects of the\nthe survey and highlight some of the areas of interest to this meeting\n", "  The Euclid space mission proposes to survey 15000 square degrees of the\nextragalactic sky during 6 years, with a step-and-stare technique. The\nscheduling of observation sequences is driven by the primary scientific\nobjectives, spacecraft constraints, calibration requirements and physical\nproperties of the sky. We present the current reference implementation of the\nEuclid survey and on-going work on survey optimization.\n", "  The ultrafast conversion of electrical to optical signals at the nanoscale is\nof fundamental interest for data processing, telecommunication and optical\ninterconnects. However, the modulation bandwidths of semiconductor LEDs are\nlimited by the spontaneous recombination rate of electron-hole pairs and the\nfootprint of electrically-driven ultrafast lasers is too large for practical\non-chip integration. A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel junction approaches\nthe ultimate size limit of electronic devices and its operating speed is\nfundamentally limited only by the tunneling time. Here we study the conversion\nof electron energy - localized in vertical gold-h-BN-gold tunnel junctions -\ninto free space photons, mediated by resonant slot antennas. Optical antennas\nefficiently bridge the size-mismatch between nanoscale volumes and far-field\nradiation and strongly enhance the electron-photon conversion efficiency. We\nachieve polarized, directional and resonantly enhanced light emission from\ninelastic electron tunneling and establish a novel platform for studying the\ninteraction of electrons with strong electromagnetic fields. Our results pave\nthe way for the further development of nanoscopic sources of light enabled by\nthe combination of nanophotonic design principles and nanoelectronics.\n", "  A new method to determine the spin tune is described and tested. In an ideal\nplanar magnetic ring, the spin tune - defined as the number of spin precessions\nper turn - is given by $\\nu_s = \\gamma G$ (gamma is the Lorentz factor, $G$ the\nmagnetic anomaly). For 970 MeV/c deuterons coherently precessing with a\nfrequency of ~120 kHz in the Cooler Synchrotron COSY, the spin tune is deduced\nfrom the up-down asymmetry of deuteron carbon scattering. In a time interval of\n2.6 s, the spin tune was determined with a precision of the order $10^{-8}$,\nand to $1 \\cdot 10^{-10}$ for a continuous 100 s accelerator cycle. This\nrenders the presented method a new precision tool for accelerator physics:\ncontrolling the spin motion of particles to high precision is mandatory, in\nparticular, for the measurement of electric dipole moments of charged particles\nin a storage ring.\n", "  We present an overview of and first results from the OMEGA survey: the OSIRIS\nMapping of Emission-line Galaxies in the multi-cluster system A901/2. The\nultimate goal of this project is to study star formation and AGN activity\nacross a broad range of environments at a single redshift. Using the\ntuneable-filter mode of the OSIRIS instrument on GTC, we target Halpha and\n[NII] emission lines over a ~0.5 X 0.5 deg2 region containing the z~0.167\nmulti-cluster system A901/2. In this paper we describe the design of the\nsurvey, the observations and the data analysis techniques developed. We then\npresent early results from two OSIRIS pointings centred on the cores of the\nA901a and A902 clusters. AGN and star-forming (SF) objects are identified using\nthe [NII]/Halpha vs. W_Halpha (WHAN) diagnostic diagram. The AGN hosts are\nbrighter, more massive, and possess earlier-type morphologies than SF galaxies.\nBoth populations tend to be located towards the outskirts of the high density\nregions we study. The typical Halpha luminosity of these sources is\nsignificantly lower than that of field galaxies at similar redshifts, but\ngreater than that found for A1689, a rich cluster at z~0.2. The Halpha\nluminosities of our objects translate into star-formation rates (SFRs) between\n~0.02 and 6 Msun/yr. Comparing the relationship between stellar mass and\nHalpha-derived SFR with that found in the field indicates a suppression of star\nformation in the cores of the clusters. These findings agree with previous\ninvestigations of this multi-cluster structure, based on other star formation\nindicators, and demonstrate the power of tuneable filters for this kind of\nstudy.\n", "  In this paper we will discuss how cosmic strings can be used to bridge the\ngap between the local geometry of our spacetime model and the global topology.\nThe primary tool is the theory of foliations and surfaces, and together with\nobservational constraints we can isolate several possibilities for the topology\nof the spatial section. This implies that the discovery of cosmic strings would\nnot just be significant for an understanding of structure formation in the\nearly universe, but also for the global properties of the spacetime model.\n", "  In this paper, we have considered a spatially flat FRW universe filled with\npressureless matter and dark energy. We have considered a phenomenological\nparametrization of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ and from this we have\nreconstructed the equation of state for dark energy $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$. This\ndivergence free parametrization of the deceleration parameter is inspired from\none of the most popular parametrization of the dark energy equation of state\ngiven by Barboza and Alcaniz. Using the combination of datasets (SN Ia $+$\nHubble $+$ BAO/CMB), we have constrained the transition redshift $z_{t}$ (at\nwhich the universe switches from a decelerating to an accelerating phase) and\nhave found the best fit value of $z_{t}$. We have also compared the\nreconstructed results of $q(z)$ and $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$ and have found that the\nresults are compatible with a $\\Lambda$CDM universe if we consider SN Ia $+$\nHubble data but inclusion of BAO/CMB data makes $q(z)$ and $\\omega_{\\phi}(z)$\nincompatible with $\\Lambda$CDM model. The potential term for the present toy\nmodel is found to be functionally similar to a Higgs potential.\n", "  We present a stacking analysis of the complete sample of Early Type Galaxies\n(ETGs) in the \\textit{Chandra} COSMOS (C-COSMOS) survey, to explore the nature\nof the X-ray luminosity in the redshift and stellar luminosity ranges\n\\(0<z<1.5\\) and \\({10}^{9}<L_K/L_{\\astrosun}<{10}^{13}\\). Using established\nscaling relations, we subtract the contribution of X-ray binary populations, to\nestimate the combined emission of hot ISM and AGN. To discriminate between the\nrelative importance of these two components, we (1) compare our results with\nthe relation observed in the local universe \\(L_{X,gas}\\propto L_K^{4.5}\\) for\nhot gaseous halos emission in ETGs, and (2) evaluate the spectral signature of\neach stacked bin. We find two regimes where the non-stellar X-ray emission is\nhard, consisten t with AGN emission. First, there is evidence of hard, absorbed\nX-ray emission in stacked bins including relatively high z (\\(\\sim 1.2\\)) ETGs\nwith average high X-ray luminosity (\\(L_{X-LMXB}\\gtrsim 6\\times{10}^{42}\\mbox{\nerg}/\\mbox{s}\\)). These luminosities are consistent with the presence ofhighly\nabsorbed \"hidden\" AGNs in these ETGs, which are not visible in their optical-IR\nspectra and spectral energy distributions. Second, confirming the early\nindication from our C-COSMOS study of X-ray detected ETGs, we find\nsignificantly enhanced X-ray luminoaity in lower stellar mass ETGs\n(\\(L_K\\lesssim{10}^{11}L_{\\astrosun}\\)), relative to the local\n\\(L_{X,gas}\\propto L_K^{4.5}\\) relation. The stacked spectra of these ETGs also\nsuggest X-ray emission harder than expected from gaseous hot halos. This\nemission is consistent with inefficient accretion\n\\({10}^{-5}-{10}^{-4}\\dot{M}_{Edd}\\) onto \\(M_{BH}\\sim\n{10}^{6}-{10}^{8}\\,M_{\\astrosun}\\).\n", "  The kinematic flow pattern in slow deformation of a model dense granular\nmedium is studied at high resolution using \\emph{in situ} imaging, coupled with\nparticle tracking. The deformation configuration is indentation by a flat punch\nunder macroscopic plane-strain conditions. Using a general analysis method,\nvelocity gradients and deformation fields are obtained from the disordered\ngrain arrangement, enabling flow characteristics to be quantified. The key\nobservations are the formation of a stagnation zone, as in dilute granular flow\npast obstacles; occurrence of vortices in the flow immediately underneath the\npunch; and formation of distinct shear bands adjoining the stagnation zone. The\ntransient and steady state stagnation zone geometry, as well as the strength of\nthe vortices and strain rates in the shear bands, are obtained from the\nexperimental data. All of these results are well-reproduced in exact-scale\nNon-Smooth Contact Dynamics (NSCD) simulations. Full 3D numerical particle\npositions from the simulations allow extraction of flow features that are\nextremely difficult to obtain from experiments. Three examples of these, namely\nmaterial free surface evolution, deformation of a grain column below the punch\nand resolution of velocities inside the primary shear band, are highlighted.\nThe variety of flow features observed in this model problem also illustrates\nthe difficulty involved in formulating a complete micromechanical analytical\ndescription of the deformation.\n", "  A topological quantum field theory is Hermitian if it is both oriented and\ncomplex-valued, and orientation-reversal agrees with complex-conjugation. A\nfield theory satisfies spin-statistics if it is both spin and super, and\n$360^\\circ$-rotation of the spin structure agrees with the operation of\nflipping the signs of all fermions. We set up a framework in which these two\nnotions are precisely analogous. In this framework, field theories are defined\nover $\\mathrm{Vect}_{\\mathbb R}$, but rather than being defined in terms of a\nsingle tangential structure, they are defined in terms of a bundle of\ntangential structures over $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb R)$. Bundles of tangential\nstructures may be etale-locally equivalent without being equivalent, and\nHermitian field theories are nothing but the field theories controlled by the\nunique nontrivial bundle of tangential structures that is etale-locally\nequivalent to Orientations. This bundle owes its existence to the fact that\n$\\pi_1^{et}(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb R)) = \\pi_1{BO}$. We interpret Deligne's\n\"existence of super fiber functors\" theorem as implying that in a\ncategorification of algebraic geometry in which symmetric monoidal categories\nreplace commutative rings, $\\pi_2^{et}(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb R)) = \\pi_2{BO}$.\nThere are eight bundles etale-locally equivalent to Spins, one of which is\ndistinguished; upon unpacking the meaning of that distinguished tangential\nstructure, one arrives at field theories that are both Hermitian and satisfy\nspin-statistics. Finally, we formulate a notion of \"reflection-positivity\" and\nprove that if an etale-locally-oriented field theory is reflection-positive\nthen it is necessarily Hermitian, and if an etale-locally-spin field theory is\nreflection-positive then it necessarily both satisfies spin-statistics and is\nHermitian. The latter result is a topological version of the famous\nSpin-Statistics Theorem.\n", "  Magnetoelectric (ME) effect is recognized for its utility for low-power\nelectronic devices.Largest ME coefficients are often associated with phase\ntransitions in which ferroelectricity is induced by magnetic order.\nUnfortunately, in these systems, large ME response is revealed only upon\nelaborate poling procedures. These procedures may become unnecessary in\nsingle-polar-domain crystals of polar magnets. Here we report giant ME effects\nin a polar magnet Fe2Mo3O8 at temperatures as high as 60 K.Polarization jumps\nof 0.3 {\\mu}C/cm2, and repeated mutual control of ferroelectric and magnetic\nmoments with differential ME coefficients on the order of 10$^4$ ps/m are\nachieved.Importantly, no electric or magnetic poling is needed, as necessary\nfor applications.The sign of the ME coefficients can be switched by changing\nthe applied \"bias\" magnetic field. The observed effects are associated with a\nhidden ferrimagnetic order unveiled by application of a magnetic field.\n", "  We uncover higher algebraic structures on Noether currents and BPS charges.\nIt is known that equivalence classes of conserved currents form a Lie algebra.\nWe show that at least for target space symmetries of higher parameterized\nWZW-type sigma-models this naturally lifts to a Lie (p+1)-algebra structure on\nthe Noether currents themselves. Applied to the Green-Schwarz-type action\nfunctionals for super p-brane sigma-models this yields super Lie (p+1)-algebra\nrefinements of the traditional BPS brane charge extensions of supersymmetry\nalgebras. We discuss this in the generality of higher differential geometry,\nwhere it applies also to branes with (higher) gauge fields on their\nworldvolume. Applied to the M5-brane sigma-model we recover and properly\nglobalize the M-theory super Lie algebra extension of 11-dimensional\nsuperisometries by 2-brane and 5-brane charges. Passing beyond the\ninfinitesimal Lie theory we find cohomological corrections to these charges in\nhigher analogy to the familiar corrections for D-brane charges as they are\nlifted from ordinary cohomology to twisted K-theory. This supports the proposal\nthat M-brane charges live in a twisted cohomology theory.\n", "  We propose a mirror model for ordinary and dark matter that assumes a new\nSU(3) gauge group of transformations, as a natural extension of the Standard\nModel (SM). A close study of big bang nucleosynthesis, baryon asymmetries,\ncosmic microwave background bounds, galaxy dynamics, together with the Standard\nModel assumptions, help us to set a limit on the mass and width of the new\ngauge boson. The cross section for the elastic scattering of a dark proton by\nan ordinary proton is estimated and compare to the WIMP--nucleon experimental\nupper bounds. It is observed that all experimental bounds for the various cross\nsections can be accommodated consistently within the gauge model. We also\nsuggest a way for direct detection of the new gauge boson via one example of a\nSM forbidden process: $e^+ + p \\rightarrow \\mu^+ + X$, where $X = \\Lambda$ or\n$\\Lambda_c$.\n", "  We derive analytical expressions for the correlation functions of the\nelectronic conductance fluctuations of an open quantum dot under several\nconditions. Both the variation of energy and that of an external parameter such\nas an applied perpendicular or parallel magnetic fields are considered in the\ngeneral case of partial openness.. These expressions are then used to obtain\nthe ensemble averaged density of maxima, a measure recently suggested to\ncontain invaluable information concerning the chaoticity of the system. The\ncorrelation width is then calculated for the case of energy variation and a\nsignificant deviation from the Weisskopf estimate is found in the case of two\nterminals. The results are extended to more than two terminals. All our results\nare analytical.The use of these results in other fields, such as nuclei, where\nthe system can only be studied through a variation of the energy, is then\ndiscussed.\n", "  The algebra of transactions as fundamental measurements is constructed on the\nbasis of the analysis of their properties and represents an expansion of the\nBoolean algebra. The notion of the generalized economic measurements of the\neconomic quantity and quality of objects of transactions is introduced. It has\nbeen shown that the vector space of economic states constructed on the basis of\nthese measurements is relativistic. The laws of kinematics of economic objects\nin this space have been analyzed and the stages of constructing the dynamics\nhave been formulated. In particular, the principle of maximum benefit, which\nrepresents an economic analog of the principle of least action in the classical\nmechanics, and the principle of relativity as the principle of equality of all\npossible consumer preferences have been formulated. The notion of economic\ninterval between two economic objects invariant to the selection of the vector\nof consumer preferences has been introduced. Methods of experimental\nverification of the principle of relativity in the space of economic states\nhave been proposed.\n", "  We investigate the average entropy of a subsystem within a global unitary\norbit of a given mixed bipartite state in the finite-dimensional space. Without\nworking out the closed-form expression of such average entropy for the mixed\nstate case, we provide an analytical lower bound for this average entropy. In\nderiving this analytical lower bound, we get some useful by-products of\nindependent interest. We also apply these results to estimate average\ncorrelation along a global unitary orbit of a given mixed bipartite state. When\nthe notion of von Neumann entropy is replaced by linear entropy, the similar\nproblem can be considered also, and moreover the exact average linear entropy\nformula is derived for a subsystem over a global unitary orbit of a mixed\nbipartite state.\n", "  In this review we discuss the current status of research in nuclear physics\nwhich is being carried out in different centers in the World. For this purpose\nwe supply a short account of the development in the area which evolved over the\nlast 9 decades, since the discovery of the neutron. The evolution of the\nphysics of the atomic nucleus went through many stages as more data become\navailable. We briefly discuss models introduced to discern the physics behind\nthe experimental discoveries, such as the shell model, the collective model,\nthe statistical model, the interacting boson model, etc., some of these models\nmay be seemingly in conflict with each other, but this was shown to be only\napparent.\n  The richness of the ideas and abundance of theoretical models attests to the\nimportant fact that the nucleus is a really singular system in the sense that\nit evolves from two-body bound states such as the deuteron, to few-body bound\nstates, such as $^4$He, $^7$Li, $^9$Be etc. and up the ladder to heavier bound\nnuclei containing up to more than 200 nucleons. Clearly statistical mechanics\ndoes not work for such finite system, neither does other theories applicable to\ncondensed matter systems. The richness of nuclear physics stems from these\nrestrictions. New theories and models are presently being developed. Theories\nof the structure and reactions of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei, called\nexotic nuclei, halo nuclei, or Borromean nuclei deal with the wealth of\nexperimental data available in the last 35 years. Further, nuclear astrophysics\nand stellar and Big Bang nucleosynthesis have become a more mature subject. Due\nto limited space, this review only covers a few selected topics, mainly those\nwith which the authors have worked with.\n", "  Detection of the signature of Rayleigh scattering in the transmission\nspectrum of an exoplanet is increasingly becoming the target of observational\ncampaigns because the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum enables one to\ndetermine the scaleheight of its atmosphere in the absence of hazes. However,\nthis is only true when one ignores the refractive effects of the exoplanet's\natmosphere. I illustrate with a suite of simple isothermal clear Jovian H2-He\natmosphere models with various abundances of water that refraction can decrease\nsignificantly the spectral slope of the Rayleigh continuum and that it becomes\nflat in the infrared. This mimics a surface, or an optically thick cloud deck,\nat much smaller pressures than one can probe in the non-refractive case. The\nrelative impact of refraction on an exoplanet's transmission spectrum decreases\nwith atmospheric temperatures and increases with stellar temperature.\nRefraction is quite important from a retrieval's perspective for Jovian-like\nplanets even at the highest atmospheric temperatures (1200 K) considered in\nthis paper, and for all stellar spectral types. Indeed, refraction breaks in\nlarge part the retrieval degeneracy between abundances of chemical species and\nthe planet's radius because the size of spectral features increases\nsignificantly with abundances, in stark contrast with the non-refractive case\nwhich simply shifts them to a larger or smaller effective radius. Abundances\ninferred assuming the atmosphere is cloud-free are lower limits. These results\nshow how important it is to include refraction in retrieval algorithms to\ninterpret transmission spectra of gas giants accurately.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the non-Abelian cosmic string in de Sitter and\nanti-de Sitter spacetimes. In order to do that we construct the complete set of\nequations of motion considering the presence of a cosmological constant. By\nusing numerical analysis we provide the behavior of the Higgs and gauge fields\nand also for the metric tensor for specific values of the physical parameters\nof the theory. For de Sitter case, we find the appearance of horizons that\nalthough being consequence of the presence of the cosmological constant it\nstrongly depends on the value of the gravitational coupling. In the anti-de\nSitter case, we find that the system does not present horizons. In fact the new\nfeature of this system is related with the behavior of the $(00)$ and $(zz)$\ncomponents of the metric tensor. They present a strongly increasing for large\ndistance from the string.\n", "  We use a sample of 149 spectroscopically confirmed UV-selected galaxies at\n$z\\sim 2$ to investigate the relative dust attenuation of the stellar continuum\nand the nebular emission lines. For each galaxy in the sample, at least one\nrest-frame optical emission line (H$\\alpha$/[NII]$\\lambda6583$ or\n[OIII]$\\lambda5007$) measurement has been taken from the litterature, and 41\ngalaxies have additional Spitzer/MIPS 24$\\mu$m observations that are used to\ninfer infrared luminosities. We use a spectral energy distribution (SED)\nfitting code that predicts nebular line strengths when fitting the stellar\npopulations of galaxies in our sample, and we perform comparisons between the\npredictions of our models and the observed/derived physical quantities. We find\nthat on average our code is able to reproduce all the physical quantities\n(e.g., UV $\\beta$ slopes, infrared luminosities, emission line fluxes), but we\nneed to apply a higher dust correction to the nebular emission compared to the\nstellar emission for the largest SFR\n($\\log\\mathrm{(SFR/M}_\\odot\\mathrm{yr}^{-1})>1.87$, Salpeter IMF). We find a\ncorrelation between SFR and the difference in nebular and stellar color\nexcesses, which could resolve the discrepant results regarding nebular dust\ncorrection at $z\\sim2$ from previous results.\n", "  Bound entanglement, being entangled yet not distillable, is essential to our\nunderstandings of the relations between nonlocality and entanglement besides\nits applications in certain quantum information tasks. Recently, bound\nentangled states that violate a Bell inequality have been constructed for a\ntwo-qutrit system, disproving a conjecture by Peres that bound entanglement is\nlocal. Here we shall construct such kind of nonlocal bound entangled states for\nall finite dimensions larger than two, making possible their experimental\ndemonstrations on most general systems. We propose a Bell inequality, based on\na Hardy-type argument for nonlocality, and a steering inequality to identify\ntheir nonlocality. We also provide a family of entanglement witnesses to detect\ntheir entanglement beyond the Bell inequality and the steering inequality.\n", "  The quasinormal modes for scalar and spinor fields in the background\nspacetime corresponding to an $f(R)$ global monopole are calculated using the\nWKB approximation. In the obtained results we emphasize the role played by the\nparameter $\\psi_{0}$, associated with the $f(R)$ gravity. We discuss the\nappropriate limit $\\psi_{0} \\rightarrow 0$, in which case the results\nconcerning to the Schwarzschild black hole are obtained, as it should be\nexpected.\n", "  The last decade has seen the success of stochastic parameterizations in\nshort-term, medium-range and seasonal forecasts: operational weather centers\nnow routinely use stochastic parameterization schemes to better represent model\ninadequacy and improve the quantification of forecast uncertainty. Developed\ninitially for numerical weather prediction, the inclusion of stochastic\nparameterizations not only provides better estimates of uncertainty, but it is\nalso extremely promising for reducing longstanding climate biases and relevant\nfor determining the climate response to external forcing. This article\nhighlights recent developments from different research groups which show that\nthe stochastic representation of unresolved processes in the atmosphere,\noceans, land surface and cryosphere of comprehensive weather and climate models\n(a) gives rise to more reliable probabilistic forecasts of weather and climate\nand (b) reduces systematic model bias. We make a case that the use of\nmathematically stringent methods for the derivation of stochastic dynamic\nequations will lead to substantial improvements in our ability to accurately\nsimulate weather and climate at all scales. Recent work in mathematics,\nstatistical mechanics and turbulence is reviewed, its relevance for the climate\nproblem demonstrated, and future research directions outlined.\n", "  We present the first results from the KMOS AGN Survey at High redshift\n(KASHz), a VLT/KMOS integral-field spectroscopic survey of z>0.6 AGN. We\npresent galaxy-integrated spectra of 89 X-ray AGN (Lx=10^42-10^45 erg/s), for\nwhich we observed [O III] (z=1.1-1.7) or Halpha emission (z=0.6-1.1). The\ntargets have X-ray luminosities representative of the parent AGN population and\nwe explore the emission-line luminosities as a function of X-ray luminosity.\nFor the [O III] targets, ~50 per cent have ionised gas velocities indicative of\ngas that is dominated by outflows and/or highly turbulent material (i.e.,\noverall line-widths >~600 km/s). The most luminous half (i.e., Lx>6x10^43\nerg/s) have a >~2 times higher incidence of such velocities. On the basis of\nour results, we find no evidence that X-ray obscured AGN are more likely to\nhost extreme kinematics than unobscured AGN. Our KASHz sample has a\ndistribution of gas velocities that is consistent with a luminosity-matched\nsample of z<0.4 AGN. This implies little evolution in the prevalence of ionised\noutflows, for a fixed AGN luminosity, despite an order-of-magnitude decrease in\naverage star-formation rates over this redshift range. Furthermore, we compare\nour Halpha targets to a redshift-matched sample of star-forming galaxies and\ndespite a similar distribution of Halpha luminosities and likely star-formation\nrates, we find extreme ionised gas velocities are up to ~10x more prevalent in\nthe AGN-host galaxies. Our results reveal a high prevalence of extreme ionised\ngas velocities in high-luminosity X-ray AGN and imply that the most powerful\nionised outflows in high-redshift galaxies are driven by AGN activity.\n", "  We perform a systematic Bayesian analysis of rotation vs. dispersion support\n($v_{\\rm rot} / \\sigma$) in $40$ dwarf galaxies throughout the Local Volume\n(LV) over a stellar mass range $10^{3.5} M_{\\rm \\odot} < M_{\\star} < 10^8\nM_{\\rm \\odot}$. We find that the stars in $\\sim 80\\%$ of the LV dwarf galaxies\nstudied -- both satellites and isolated systems -- are dispersion-supported. In\nparticular, we show that $6/10$ *isolated* dwarfs in our sample have $v_{\\rm\nrot} / \\sigma < 1.0$. All have $v_{\\rm rot} / \\sigma \\lesssim 2.0$. These\nresults challenge the traditional view that the stars in gas-rich dwarf\nirregulars (dIrrs) are distributed in cold, rotationally-supported stellar\ndisks, while gas-poor dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) are kinematically distinct in\nhaving dispersion-supported stars. We see no clear trend between $v_{\\rm rot} /\n\\sigma$ and distance to the closest $\\rm L_{\\star}$ galaxy, nor between $v_{\\rm\nrot} / \\sigma$ and $M_{\\star}$ within our mass range. We apply the same\nBayesian analysis to four FIRE hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of isolated\ndwarf galaxies ($10^9 M_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm vir} < 10^{10} M_{\\rm \\odot}$) and\nshow that the simulated *isolated* dIrr galaxies have stellar ellipticities and\nstellar $v_{\\rm rot} / \\sigma$ ratios that are consistent with the observed\npopulation of dIrrs *and* dSphs without the need to subject these dwarfs to any\nexternal perturbations or tidal forces. We posit that most dwarf galaxies form\nas puffy, dispersion-dominated systems, rather than cold, angular\nmomentum-supported disks. If this is the case, then transforming a dIrr into a\ndSph may require little more than removing its gas.\n", "  We develop a new method for obtaining the BPS equations of static vortices\nmotivated by the results of the \\textit{On-Shell} method on the standard\nMaxwell-Higgs model and its Born-Infeld-Higgs model~\\cite{Atmaja:2014fha}. Our\nmethod relies on the existence of what we shall call an energy function, $Q$,\nwhich is a mere function of the (effective) fields. The total energy of BPS\nvortices, $E_{BPS}$, are simply given by a difference between the boundaries\nvalue of $Q$ at $r\\to\\infty$ and at $r=0$, $E_{BPS}=Q(r\\to\\infty)-Q(r=0)$.\nImposing a condition that these (effective) fields are independent, we may\ndefine a BPS Lagrangian, $\\mathcal{L}_{BPS}$, derived by taking integral of\ndifferential $Q$, $\\mathcal{L}_{BPS}=-\\int dQ$. Matching the Lagrangian\n$\\mathcal{L}_{BPS}$ with the corresponding effective Lagrangian, we can extract\nseveral equations. Solving these equations yields the desired BPS equations\nand, in some cases, also constraint equations. With our method, the various\nknown BPS equations of vortices are derived in a relatively simple procedure.\n", "  We demonstrate a high-performance apertureless near-field probe made of a\ntapered metal tip with a set of periodic shallow grooves near the apex. The\nspontaneous emission from a single emitter near the tip is investigated\nsystematically for the side-illumination tip enhanced spectroscopy (TES). In\ncontrast with the bare tapered metal tip in conventional side-illumination TES,\nthe corrugated probe not only enhances strongly local excitation field but also\nconcentrates the emission directivity, which leads to high collection\nefficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. In particular, we propose an asymmetric\nTES tip based on two coupling nanorods with different length at the apex to\nrealize unidirectional enhanced emission rate from a single emitter.\nInterestingly, we find that the radiation pattern is sensitive to the emission\nwavelength and the emitter positions respective to the apex, which can result\nin an increase of signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing undesired signal. The\nproposed asymmetrical corrugated probe opens up a broad range of practical\napplications, e.g. increasing the detection efficiency of tip enhanced\nspectroscopy at the single-molecule level.\n", "  Background boucing cosmologies in the framework of General Relativity, driven\nby a single scalar field filling the Universe, and with a quasi-matter\ndomination period, i.e., depicting the so-called Matter Bounce Scenario, are\nreconstructed for geometries with positive spatial curvature. These cosmologies\nlead to a nearly flat power spectrum of the curvature fluctuations in co-moving\ncoordinates for modes that leave the Hubble radius during the quasi-matter\ndomination period, and whose spectral index and its running, which are related\nwith the effective Equation of State parameter given by the quotient of the\npressure over the energy density, are compatible with observational data.\n", "  Large-scale surveys make huge amounts of photometric data available. Because\nof the sheer amount of objects, spectral data cannot be obtained for all of\nthem. Therefore it is important to devise techniques for reliably estimating\nphysical properties of objects from photometric information alone. These\nestimates are needed to automatically identify interesting objects worth a\nfollow-up investigation as well as to produce the required data for a\nstatistical analysis of the space covered by a survey. We argue that machine\nlearning techniques are suitable to compute these estimates accurately and\nefficiently. This study promotes a feature selection algorithm, which selects\nthe most informative magnitudes and colours for a given task of estimating\nphysical quantities from photometric data alone. Using k nearest neighbours\nregression, a well-known non-parametric machine learning method, we show that\nusing the found features significantly increases the accuracy of the\nestimations compared to using standard features and standard methods. We\nillustrate the usefulness of the approach by estimating specific star formation\nrates (sSFRs) and redshifts (photo-z's) using only the broad-band photometry\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For estimating sSFRs, we demonstrate\nthat our method produces better estimates than traditional spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting. For estimating photo-z's, we show that our method\nproduces more accurate photo-z's than the method employed by SDSS. The study\nhighlights the general importance of performing proper model selection to\nimprove the results of machine learning systems and how feature selection can\nprovide insights into the predictive relevance of particular input features.\n", "  We describe a big brake singularity in terms of a modified Chaplygin gas\nequation of state $p=(\\ga_{m}-1)\\rho+\\al\\ga_{m}\\rho^{-n}$, accommodate this\nlate-time event as an exotic quintessence model obtained from an\nenergy-momentum tensor, and focus on the cosmological behavior of the exotic\nfield, its kinetic energy and the potential energy. At the background level,\nthe exotic field does not blow up whereas its kinetic energy and potential both\ngrow without limit near the future singularity. We evaluate the classical\nstability of this background solution by examining the scalar perturbations of\nthe metric along with the inclusion of entropy perturbation in the perturbed\npressure. Within the Newtonian gauge, the gravitational field approaches a\nconstant near the singularity plus additional regular terms. When the perturbed\nexotic field is associated with $\\al>0$ the perturbed pressure and contrast\ndensity both diverge, whereas the perturbed exotic field and the divergence of\nthe exotic field's velocity go to zero exponentially. When the perturbed exotic\nfield is associated with $\\al<0$ the contrast density always blows up, but the\nperturbed pressure can remain bounded. In addition, the perturbed exotic field\nand the divergence of the exotic field's velocity vanish near the big brake\nsingularity. We also briefly look at the behavior of the intrinsic entropy\nperturbation near the singular event.\n", "  The light curves of solar coronal loops often peak first in channels\nassociated with higher temperatures and then in those associated with lower.\nThe time delays between the different narrowband EUV channels have been\nmeasured for many individual loops and recently for every pixel of an active\nregion observation. Time delays between channels for an active region exhibit a\nwide range of values, with maxima $>$ 5,000\\,s. These large time delays make up\n3-26\\% (depending on the channel pair) of the pixels where a significant,\npositive time delay is measured. It has been suggested that time delays can be\nexplained by impulsive heating. In this paper, we investigate whether the\nlargest observed time delays can be explained by this hypothesis by simulating\na series of coronal loops with different heating rates, loop lengths,\nabundances, and geometries to determine the range of expected time delays\nbetween a set of four EUV channels. We find that impulsive heating cannot\naddress the largest time delays observed in two of the channel pairs and that\nthe majority of the large time delays can only be explained by long, expanding\nloops with photospheric abundances. Additional observations may rule out these\nsimulations as an explanation for the long time delays. We suggest that either\nthe time delays found in this manner may not be representative of real loop\nevolution, or that the impulsive heating and cooling scenario may be too simple\nto explain the observations and other heating scenarios must be explored.\n", "  We present a numerical study on the light transport properties which are\nmodulated by the disorder strength in quasi-one-dimensional disordered\nwaveguide which consists of periodically arranged scatterers with random\ndielectric constant. The transport mean free path is found to stay inversely\nproportional to the square of the relative fluctuation of the dielectric\nconstant as in the 1D and 2D cases but with . The transport properties of light\nthrough a sample with a fixed size can be modulated from ballistic to localized\nregime as well, and a generalized scaling function is defined to determine the\nlight transport status in such a sample. The calculation of the diffusion\ncoefficient and the energy density profile of the most transmitted eigenchannel\nclearly exhibits the transition of transport behaviour from diffusion to\nlocalization.\n", "  We propose fast phase-gates of single nuclear spins interacting with single\nelectron spins. The gate operation utilizes geometric phase shifts of the\nelectron spin induced by fast/slow rotating fields; the path difference\ndepending on nuclear spin states enables nuclear phase shifts. The gate time is\ninversely proportional to the frequency of the slow rotating field. As an\nexample, we use nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and show the phase-gate\ntime orders of magnitude shorter than previously reported. We also show the\nrobustness of the gate against decoherence and systematic errors.\n", "  We study the interactions between strongly interacting massive particle dark\nmatter and the Standard Model via a massive vector boson that is kinetically\nmixed with the hypercharge gauge boson. The relic abundance is set by 3-to-2\nself-interactions of the dark matter, while the interactions with the vector\nmediator enable kinetic equilibrium between the dark and visible sectors. We\nshow that a wide range of parameters is phenomenologically viable and can be\nprobed in various ways. Astrophysical and cosmological constraints are evaded\ndue to the p-wave nature of dark matter annihilation into visible particles,\nwhile direct detection methods using electron recoils can be sensitive to parts\nof the parameter space. In addition, we propose performing spectroscopy of the\nstrongly coupled dark sector at e+e- colliders, where the energy of a\nmono-photon can track the resonance structure of the dark sector.\nAlternatively, some resonances may decay back into Standard Model leptons or\njets, realizing `hidden valley' phenomenology at the LHC and ILC in a concrete\nfashion.\n", "  We present a complete classification and the construction of\n$\\mathrm{Mp}(2n+2,\\mathbb{R})$-equivariant differential operators acting on the\nprincipal series representations, associated to the contact projective geometry\non $\\mathbb{RP}^{2n+1}$ and induced from the irreducible\n$\\mathrm{Mp}(2n,\\mathbb{R})$-submodules of the Segal-Shale-Weil representation\ntwisted by a one-parameter family of characters. The proof is based on the\nclassification of homomorphisms of generalized Verma modules for the\nSegal-Shale-Weil representation twisted by a one-parameter family of\ncharacters, together with a generalization of the well-known duality between\nhomomorphisms of generalized Verma modules and equivariant differential\noperators in the category of inducing smooth admissible modules.\n", "  We present a numerical study on the light transport properties and statistics\nof transmission channels in random media with inhomogeneous disorder. For the\ncase of longitudinal inhomogeneity of disorder we find that the statistics of\nthe transmission channels is independent of the inhomogeneity and the system\ncan be equivalent to a counterpart with homogeneous disorder strength, both of\nwhich have the same statistical distribution of the transmission channels.\nHowever, for the case of transverse inhomogeneity of disorder, such equivalence\ndoes not exist, moreover, the transmission eigenvalues are pushed to the two\nends of the distribution and the distribution of the total transmission is\nbroadened since the spatial structure gives rise to larger and smaller\ntransmitted incident channels.\n", "  We use classical results from harmonic analysis on matrix spaces to\ninvestigate the relation between the joint density of the singular values and\nof the eigenvalues of complex random matrices which are bi-unitarily invariant\n(also known as isotropic or unitary rotation invariant). We prove that one of\nthese joint densities determines the other one. Moreover we construct an\nexplicit formula relating both joint densities at finite matrix dimension. This\nrelation covers probability densities as well as signed densities. With the\nhelp of this relation we derive general analytical relations among the\ncorresponding kernels and biorthogonal functions for a specific class of\npolynomial ensembles. Furthermore we show how to generalize the relation\nbetween the eigenvalue and singular value statistics to certain situations when\nthe ensemble is deformed by a term which breaks the bi-unitary invariance.\n", "  In this work we directly fit the QCD dimensional transmutation parameter,\n${\\Lambda _{\\overline {MS} }}$, to experimental data of Drell-Yan (DY)\nobservables. For this purpose we first obtain the evolution of transverse\nmomentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) up to the NNLO\napproximation based on Collins-Sopper-Sterman formalism. As is expecting the\nTMDPDFs are appearing at larger values of transvers momentum by increasing the\nenergy scales and also the order of approximation. Then we calculate the cross\nsection related to the TMDPDFs in the DY process. As a consequence of fitting\nto the E288 experimental data at center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=23.8$ $GeV$,\nwe obtain ${\\Lambda _{\\overline {MS} }} = 249 \\pm 7 MeV$ corresponding to the\nrenormalized coupling constant ${\\alpha _s}(M_z^2) = 0.119 \\pm 0.001$ which is\nwithin the acceptable range for this quantity. The results for DY cross section\nat different energy scales are in good agreement within the available data.\n", "  Observations of the $^{12}$CO(3-2) emission of the circumstellar envelope\n(CSE) of the variable star $\\pi^1$ Gru using the compact array (ACA) of the\nALMA observatory have been recently made accessible to the public. An analysis\nof the morphology and kinematics of the CSE is presented with a result very\nsimilar to that obtained earlier for $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission by Chiu et al.\n(2006) using the Sub-Millimeter Array. A quantitative comparison is made using\ntheir flared disk model. A new model is presented that provides a significantly\nbetter description of the data, using radial winds and smooth evolutions of the\nradio emission and wind velocity from the stellar equator to the poles.\n", "  We consider Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) thought experiments in unitary\nConformal Field Theories (CFTs). We explore the implications of the standard\ndispersion relations for the OPE data. We derive positivity constraints on the\nOPE coefficients of minimal-twist operators of even spin s \\geq 2. In the case\nof s=2, when the leading-twist operator is the stress tensor, we reproduce the\nHofman-Maldacena bounds. For s>2 the bounds are new.\n", "  Magnetic fields are believed to drive accretion and relativistic jets in\nblack hole accretion systems, but the magnetic-field structure that controls\nthese phenomena remains uncertain. We perform general relativistic (GR)\npolarized radiative transfer of time-dependent three-dimensional GR\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations to model thermal synchrotron emission\nfrom the Galactic Center source Sagittarius A$^\\ast$ (Sgr A*). We compare our\nresults to new polarimetry measurements by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)\nand show how polarization in the visibility (Fourier) domain distinguishes and\nconstrains accretion flow models with different magnetic field structures.\nThese include models with small-scale fields in disks driven by the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) as well as models with large-scale ordered\nfields in magnetically-arrested disks (MAD). We also consider different\nelectron temperature and jet mass-loading prescriptions that control the\nbrightness of the disk, funnel-wall jet, and Blandford-Znajek-driven funnel\njet. Our comparisons between the simulations and observations favor models with\nordered magnetic fields near the black hole event horizon in Sgr A*, although\nboth disk- and jet-dominated emission can satisfactorily explain most of the\ncurrent EHT data. We show that stronger model constraints should be possible\nwith upcoming circular polarization and higher frequency ($349~{\\rm GHz}$)\nmeasurements.\n", "  We examine the stability of feedback-regulated star formation (SF) in\ngalactic nuclei and contrast it to SF in extended discs. In galactic nuclei the\ndynamical time becomes shorter than the time over which feedback from young\nstars evolves. We argue analytically that the balance between stellar feedback\nand gravity is unstable in this regime. We study this using numerical\nsimulations with pc-scale resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from\nstellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young stellar mass, and SFR\nwithin the central ~100 pc (the short-timescale regime) never reach\nsteady-state, but instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles. Stars form\nuntil a critical surface density of young stars is present (such that feedback\noverwhelms gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from the nucleus.\nSince the dynamical times are shorter than the stellar evolution times, the\nstars do not die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push, triggering a\nrunaway quenching of star formation in the nucleus. However the expelled gas is\nlargely not unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic fountain which\nre-fills the nuclear region after the massive stars from the previous burst\ncycle have died off (~50 Myr timescale). On large scales (>1 kpc), the\ngalaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable. We examine the consequences of\nthis episodic nuclear star formation for the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation:\nwhile a tight KS relation exists on ~1 kpc scales in good agreement with\nobservations, the scatter increases dramatically in smaller apertures centered\non galactic nuclei.\n", "  We study two-band one-dimensional superconducting chains of spinless fermions\nwith inter and intra-band pairing. These bands hybridize and depending on the\nrelative angular momentum of their orbitals this can be symmetric or\nanti-symmetric. The competition between intra and inter-band superconductivity\nand how it is affected by the symmetry of the hybridization is investigated.\nThe interband pairing is shown to be dominant on a large region of parameter\nspace. A rich phase diagram is found in the presence of anti-symmetric\nhybridization. The topological properties of the model are obtained through the\ntopological invariant winding number. We find the existence of a topological\nphase due to the inter-band superconductivity and induced by symmetric\nhybridization. Robustness of zero-energy edge states are discussed and are\nshown to be present in the topological phase.\n", "  We extend significantly previous works on the Hilbert space representations\nof the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) in 3+1 dimensions of the form\n$[X_i,P_j] = i F_{ij}$ where $ F_{ij} = f(P^2) \\delta_{ij} + g(P^2) P_i P_j $\nfor any functions $f$. However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting\n$X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal\nlength that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level,\nthere exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum\nalgebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of\noperators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the\nsymmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a\ncompletely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with\nmomentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space\nrepresentations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus,\nspecifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional\nanalysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a\nminimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of\ntranslations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship\nis preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal\nlength is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding\nAquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of\nthis model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of\ntranslations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends\non the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. This result\nprovides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum\ngravity corrections lead to the emergence of a minimal length.\n", "  High resolution observations of Young Stellar Object (YSO) jets show them to\nbe composed of many small-scale knots or clumps. In this paper we report\nresults of 3-D numerical simulations designed to study how such clumps interact\nand create morphologies and kinematic patterns seen in emission line\nobservations. Our simulations focus on clump scale dynamics by imposing\nvelocity differences between spherical, over-dense regions which then lead to\nthe formation of bow shocks as faster clumps overtake slower material. We show\nthat much of the spatial structure apparent in emission line images of jets\narises from the dynamics and interactions of these bow shocks. Our simulations\nshow a variety of time-dependent features, including bright knots associated\nwith Mach stems where the shocks intersect, a \"frothy\" emission structure that\narises from the presence of the Non-linear Thin Shell Instability (NTSI) along\nthe surfaces of the bow shocks, and the merging and fragmentation of clumps.\nOur simulations use a new non-equilibrium cooling method to produce synthetic\nemission maps in H$\\alpha$ and [S II]. These are directly compared with\nmulti-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of Herbig-Haro (HH) jets.\nWe find excellent agreement between features seen in the simulations and the\nobservations in terms of both proper motion and morphologies. Thus we conclude\nthat YSO jets may be dominated by heterogeneous structures and that\ninteractions between these structures and the shocks they produce can account\nfor many details of YSO jet evolution.\n", "  Five archived X-ray observations of NGC 4051, taken using the NuSTAR\nobservatory, have been analysed, revealing lags between flux variations in\nbands covering a wide range of X-ray photon energy. In all pairs of bands\ncompared, the harder band consistently lags the softer band by at least 1000s,\nat temporal frequencies ~5E-5 Hz. In addition, soft-band lags up to 400s are\nmeasured at frequencies ~2E-4 Hz. Light echos from an excess of soft band\nemission in the inner accretion disk cannot explain the lags in these data, as\nthey are seen in cross-correlations with energy bands where the softer band is\nexpected to have no contribution from reflection. The basic properties of the\ntime delays have been parameterised by fitting a top hat response function that\nvaries with photon energy, taking fully into account the covariance between\nmeasured time lag values. The low-frequency hard-band lags and the transition\nto soft-band lags are consistent with time lags arising as reverberation delays\nfrom circumnuclear scattering of X-rays, although greater model complexity is\nrequired to explain the entire spectrum of lags. The scattered fraction\nincreases with increasing photon energy as expected, and the scattered fraction\nis high, indicating the reprocessor to have a global covering fraction ~50%\naround the continuum source. Circumnuclear material, possibly associated with a\ndisk wind at a few hundred gravitational radii from the primary X-ray source,\nmay provide suitable reprocessing.\n", "  The halo shape plays a central role in determining important observational\nproperties of the haloes such as mass, concentration and lensing\ncross-sections. The triaxiality of lensing galaxy clusters has a substantial\nimpact on the distribution of the largest Einstein radii, while weak lensing\ntechniques are sensitive to the intrinsic halo ellipticity. In this work, we\nprovide scaling relations for the shapes of dark matter haloes as a function of\nmass (peak height) and redshift over more than four orders of magnitude in halo\nmasses, namely from $10^{11.5}$ to $10^{15.8}~h^{-1}~$M$_\\odot$. We have\nanalysed four dark matter only simulations from the MultiDark cosmological\nsimulation suite with more than 56 billion particles within boxes of 4.0, 2.5,\n1.0 and 0.4 $h^{-1}$Gpc size assuming \\textit{Planck} cosmology. The dark\nmatter haloes have been identified in the simulations using the {\\sc rockstar}\nhalo finder, which also determines the axis ratios in terms of the\ndiagonalization of the inertia tensor. In order to infer the shape for a\nhypothetical halo of a given mass at a given redshift, we provide fitting\nfunctions to the minor-to-major and intermediate-to-major axis ratios as a\nfunction of the peak height.\n", "  We discuss the entanglement spectrum of the ground state of a gapped\n(1+1)-dimensional system in a phase near a quantum phase transition. In\nparticular, in proximity to a quantum phase transition described by a conformal\nfield theory (CFT), the system is represented by a gapped Lorentz invariant\nfield theory in the \"scaling limit\" (correlation length $\\xi$ much larger than\nmicroscopic 'lattice' scale $a$), and can be thought of as a CFT perturbed by a\nrelevant perturbation. We show that for such (1+1) gapped Lorentz invariant\nfield theories in infinite space, the low-lying entanglement spectrum obtained\nby tracing out, say, left half-infinite space, is precisely equal to the\nphysical spectrum of the unperturbed gapless, i.e. conformal field theory\ndefined on a finite interval of length $L_\\xi=$ $\\log(\\xi/a)$ with certain\nboundary conditions. In particular, the low-lying entanglement spectrum of the\ngapped theory is the finite-size spectrum of a boundary conformal field theory,\nand is always discrete and universal. Each relevant perturbation, and thus each\ngapped phase in proximity to the quantum phase transition, maps into a\nparticular boundary condition. A similar property has been known to hold for\nBaxter's Corner Transfer Matrices in a very special class of fine-tuned, namely\nintegrable off-critical lattice models, for the entire entanglement spectrum\nand independent of the scaling limit. In contrast, our result applies to\ncompletely general gapped Lorentz invariant theories in the scaling limit,\nwithout the requirement of integrability, for the low-lying entanglement\nspectrum. - The finite-size spectra of the entanglement Hamiltonian and of the\nphysical Hamiltonian on an interval of length R exhibit entirely different\nbehaviors upon crossover from the critical regime $R \\ll \\xi$ to the gapped\nregime $R \\gg \\xi$.\n", "  Thus far, in spite of many interesting developments, the overall progress\ntowards a systematic study and classification of various 'strange' metallic\nstates of matter has been rather limited. To that end, it was argued that a\nrecent proliferation of the ideas of holographic correspondence originating\nfrom string theory might offer a possible way out of the stalemate. However,\nafter almost a decade of intensive studies into the proposed extensions of the\nholographic conjecture to a variety of condensed matter problems, the validity\nof this intriguing approach remains largely unknown. This discussion aims at\nascertaining its true status and elucidating the conditions under which some of\nits predictions may indeed be right (albeit, possibly, for a wrong reason).\n", "  We present a careful assess of the forced field extrapolation using Solar\nDynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) magnetogram.\nThe convergence property is checked by several metrics. The extrapolated field\nlines below 3600km appear to be aligned with most Halpha fibrils observed by\nNew Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST). In the region where magnetic energy far\nlarger than potential energy, field lines computed by forced field\nextrapolation still consistent with the patterns of Halpha fibrils while\nnon-linear force free field (NLFFF) results show large misalignment. The\nhorizontal average of lorentz force ratio shows the forced region where\nforce-free assumption is failed can reach the height of $1400-1800km$. The\nnon-force-free state of the chromosphere is also confirmed by recent radiation\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation.\n", "  EL CVn-type binaries contain an A-type dwarf star and a very low mass ($\\sim\n0.2M_\\odot$) helium white dwarf precursor (pre-He WD). Recent surveys and\nobservations have discovered dozens of them, and showed that some pre-He WDs\nhave multi-periodic pulsations, opening up the possibility of using\nasteroseismology to study the interior structure of these stars. We have\nstudied the formation of EL CVn-type binaries to understand the physics of\ntheir formation and give the properties and the space density of this\npopulation of stars in the Galaxy. We use a simple analysis to show that EL CVn\nbinaries cannot be produced by rapid common envelope evolution because this\nprocess leads to merging of the components when a giant has such a low-mass\ncore. We find that EL CVn-type binaries can be produced by long-term stable\nmass transfer between low-mass stars in close binary systems. We have\ncomprehensively studied this formation channel and the characteristics of the\nresulting population of EL CVn-type binaries from more than 65,000 runs of\nbinary evolution with primary star masses between 0.9 and $2.0M_\\odot$ and\nassuming composition appropriate for Population I stars. The theoretical\nevolutionary tracks, mass ratios and the WD mass-period ($M_{\\rm WD}-P$)\nrelation are generally in agreement with observations. We conclude that many\nmore EL CVn-type binaries remain to be discovered and that these binaries will\nbe predominantly low-mass systems in old stellar populations.\n", "  The possibility to construct an inflationary scenario for\nrenormalization-group improved potentials corresponding to the Higgs sector of\nquantum field models is investigated. Taking into account quantum corrections\nto the renormalization-group potential which sums all leading logs of\nperturbation theory is essential for a successful realization of the\ninflationary scenario, with very reasonable parameters values. The scalar\nelectrodynamics inflationary scenario thus obtained are seen to be in good\nagreement with the most recent observational data.\n", "  Recently a stable monolayer of antimony in buckled honeycomb structure called\nantimonene was successfully grown on 3D topological insulator Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and\nSb$_2$Te$_3$, which displays semiconducting properties. By first principle\ncalculations, we systematically investigate the phononic, electronic and\noptical properties of $\\alpha-$ and $\\beta-$ allotropes of monolayer\narsenene/antimonene. We investigate the dynamical stabilities of these four\nmaterials by considering the phonon dispersions. The obtained electronic\nstructures reveal the direct band gap of monolayer $\\alpha-$As/Sb and indirect\nband gap of $\\beta-$As/Sb. Significant absorption is observed in $\\alpha-$Sb,\nwhich can be used as a broad saturable absorber.\n", "  Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ is a leading candidate for chiral $p$-wave superconductivity.\nThe detailed mechanism of superconductivity in this material is still the\nsubject of intense investigations. Since superconductivity is sensitive to the\ntopology of the Fermi surface (the contour of zero-energy quasi-particle\nexcitations in the momentum space in the normal state), changing this topology\ncan provide a strong test of theory. Recent experiments tuned the Fermi surface\ntopology efficiently by applying planar anisotropic strain. Using functional\nrenormalization group theory, we study the superconductivity and competing\norders in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain. We find a rapid initial increase in the\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c$, which can be associated with the\nevolution of the Fermi surface toward a Lifshitz reconstruction under\nincreasing strain. Before the Lifshitz reconstruction is reached, however, the\nsystem switches from the superconducting state to a spin density wave state.\nThe theory agrees well with recent strain experiments showing an enhancement of\n$T_c$ followed by an intriguing sudden drop.\n", "  We study the quasinormal modes of the massless scalar field in asymptotically\n(A)dS black holes in Lovelock spacetime by using the sixth order of the WKB\napproximation. We consider the effects of the second and third order of\nLovelock coupling constants on quasinormal frequencies spectrum as well as\ncosmological constant.\n", "  We present new analytic solutions for one-zone (fully mixed) chemical\nevolution models and explore their implications. In contrast to existing\nanalytic models, we incorporate a realistic delay time distribution for Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNIa) and can therefore track the separate evolution of\n$\\alpha$-elements produced by core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and iron peak\nelements synthesized in both CCSNe and SNIa. In generic cases, $\\alpha$ and\niron abundances evolve to an equilibrium at which element production is\nbalanced by metal consumption and gas dilution, instead of continuing to\nincrease over time. The equilibrium absolute abundances depend principally on\nsupernova yields and the outflow mass loading parameter $\\eta$, while the\nequilibrium abundance ratio [$\\alpha$/Fe] depends mainly on yields and\nsecondarily on star formation history. A stellar population can be metal-poor\neither because it has not yet evolved to equilibrium or because high outflow\nefficiency makes the equilibrium abundance itself low. Systems with ongoing gas\naccretion develop metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) that are sharply\npeaked, while \"gas starved\" systems with rapidly declining star formation have\nbroadly peaked MDFs. A burst of star formation that consumes a significant\nfraction of a system's available gas can temporarily boost [$\\alpha$/Fe] by\n0.1-0.3 dex, a possible origin for rare, $\\alpha$-enhanced stars with\nintermediate age or high metallicity. Other sudden transitions in system\nproperties can produce surprising behavior, including backward evolution of a\nstellar population from high metallicity to low metallicity. An Appendix\nprovides a user's guide for calculating enrichment histories, [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ntracks, and MDFs for a wide variety of scenarios, including flexible forms of\nstar formation history.\n", "  Semi-empirical models of the solar Chromosphere show in their emission\nspectrum, tomography property at millimeter, sub-millimeter, and infrared\nwavelengths for the center of the solar disk. In this work, we studied this\nproperty in the solar limb using our numerical code PakalMPI, focusing in the\nregion where the solar atmosphere becomes optically thick. Individual\ncontribution of Bremsstrahlung and H- opacities was take into account in the\nradiative transfer process. We found that the tomography property remains in\nall the spectrum region under study at limb altitudes. For frequencies be-\ntween 2 GHz and 5 THz the contribution of Bremsstrahlung is the dominant\nprocess above the solar limb.\n", "  The energy-time uncertainty is an intrinsic limit for time-resolved\nexperiments imposing a tradeoff between the duration of the light pulses used\nin experiments and their frequency content. In standard time-resolved\nphotoemission, this limitation maps directly onto a tradeoff between the time\nresolution of the experiment and the energy resolution that can be achieved on\nthe electronic spectral function. Here we propose a protocol to disentangle the\nenergy and time resolutions in photoemission. We demonstrate that dynamical\ninformation on all time scales can be retrieved from time-resolved\nphotoemission experiments using suitably shaped light pulses of quantum or\nclassical nature. As a paradigmatic example, we study the dynamical buildup of\nthe Kondo peak, a narrow feature in the electronic response function arising\nfrom the screening of a magnetic impurity by the conduction electrons. After a\nquench, the electronic screening builds up on timescales shorter than the\ninverse width of the Kondo peak and we demonstrate that the proposed\nexperimental scheme could be used to measure the intrinsic time scales of such\nelectronic screening. The proposed approach provides an experimental framework\nto access the nonequilibrium response of collective electronic properties\nbeyond the spectral uncertainty limit and will enable the direct measurement of\nphenomena such as excited Higgs modes and, possibly, the retarded interactions\nin superconducting systems.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio signals occurring at\ncosmological distances. However the physical model of FRBs is mystery, many\nmodels have been proposed. Here we study the frequency distributions of peak\nflux, fluence, duration and waiting time for the repeating FRB 121102. The\ncumulative distributions of peak flux, fluence and duration show power-law\nforms. The waiting time distribution also shows power-law distribution, and is\nconsistent with a non-stationary Poisson process. These distributions are\nsimilar as those of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). We also use the statistical\nresults to test the proposed models for FRBs. These distributions are\nconsistent with the predictions from avalanche models of slowly driven\nnonlinear dissipative systems.\n", "  Continuous spontaneous localisation (CSL) is a model that captures the\neffects of a class of extensions to quantum theory which are expected to result\nfrom quantum gravity, and is such that wavefunction collapse is a physical\nprocess. The rate of such a process could be very much lower than the upper\nbounds set by searches to date, and yet still modify greatly the interpretation\nof quantum mechanics and solve the quantum measurement problem. Consequently\nexperiments are sought to explore this. We describe an experiment that has the\npotential to extend sensitivity to CSL by many orders of magnitude. The method\nis to detect heating of the motion of charged macroscopic objects confined in a\nPaul trap. We discuss the detection and the chief noise sources. We find that\nCSL with standard parameters could be observed using a vibration-isolated ion\ntrap of size 1 cm at ultra-low pressure, with optical interferometric\ndetection.\n", "  The second law of thermodynamics, which asserts the non-negativity of the\naverage total entropy production of a combined system and its environment, is a\ndirect consequence of applying Jensen's inequality to a fluctuation relation.\nIt is also possible, through this inequality, to determine an upper bound of\nthe average total entropy production based on the entropies along the most\nextreme stochastic trajectories. In this work, we construct an upper bound\ninequality of the average of a convex function over a domain whose average is\nknown. When applied to the various fluctuation relations, the upper bounds of\nthe average total entropy production are established. Finally, by employing the\nresult of Neri, Rold\\'an, and J\\\"ulicher [Phys. Rev. X 7, 011019 (2017)], we\nare able to show that the average total entropy production is bounded only by\nthe total entropy production supremum, and vice versa, for a general\nnon-equilibrium stationary system.\n", "  We present Adaptive Optics assisted near-IR integral field spectroscopic\nobservations of a luminous quasar at $z = 2.4$, previously observed as the\nfirst known example at high redshift of large scale quasar-driven outflow\nquenching star formation in its host galaxy. The nuclear spectrum shows broad\nand blueshifted H$\\beta$ in absorption, which is tracing outflowing gas with\nhigh densities ($>10^8$ - $10^9$ cm$^{-3}$) and velocities in excess of 10,000\nkm s$^{-1}$. The properties of the outflowing clouds (covering factor, density,\ncolumn density and inferred location) indicate that they likely originate from\nthe Broad Line Region. The energetics of such nuclear regions are consistent\nwith that observed in the large scale outflow, supporting models in which\nquasar driven outflows originate from the nuclear region and are energy\nconserving. We note that the asymmetric profile of both the H$\\beta$ and\nH$\\alpha$ emission lines is likely due to absorption by the dense outflowing\ngas along the line of sight. This outflow-induced asymmetry has implications on\nthe estimation of the black hole mass using virial estimators, and warns about\nsuch effects for several other quasars characterized by similar line\nasymmetries. More generally, our findings may suggest a broader revision of the\ndecomposition and interpretation of quasar spectral features, in order to take\ninto account the presence of potential broad blueshifted Balmer absorption\nlines. Our high spatial resolution data also reveals redshifted, dynamically\ncolder nebular emission lines, likely tracing an inflowing stream.\n", "  We present a large-scale combination of near-infrared (near-IR) interstellar\npolarization data from background starlight with polarized emission data at\nsubmillimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths for the Vela C molecular cloud. The near-IR\ndata consist of more than 6700 detections probing a range of visual extinctions\nbetween $2$ and $20\\,$mag in and around the cloud. The sub-mm data was\ncollected in Antartica by the Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter\nTelescope for Polarimetry (BLASTPol). This is the first direct combination of\nnear-IR and sub-mm polarization data for a molecular cloud aimed at measuring\nthe \"polarization efficiency ratio\" ($R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$), a quantity that is\nexpected to depend only on grain intrinsic physical properties. It is defined\nas $p_{500}/(p_{I}/\\tau_{V})$, where $p_{500}$ and $p_{I}$ are polarization\nfractions at $500\\,\\mu$m and $I$-band, respectively, and $\\tau_{V}$ is the\noptical depth. To ensure that the same column density of material is producing\nboth polarization from emission and from extinction, we conducted a careful\nselection of near-background stars using 2MASS, $Herschel$ and $Planck$ data.\nThis selection excludes objects contaminated by the Galactic diffuse background\nmaterial as well as objects located in the foreground. Accounting for\nstatistical and systematic uncertainties, we estimate an average\n$R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ value of $2.4\\pm0.8$, which can be used to test the\npredictions of dust grain models designed for molecular clouds when such\npredictions become available. $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ appears to be relatively flat\nas a function of the cloud depth for the range of visual extinctions probed.\n", "  We study the influence of environment on the structure of disc galaxies,\nusing \\texttt{IMFIT} to measure the g- and r-band structural parameters of the\nsurface-brightness profiles for $\\sim$700 low-redshift (z$<$0.063) cluster and\nfield disc galaxies with intermediate stellar mass (0.8 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$\n$M_{\\odot}$ $<$ $M_{\\star}$ $<$ 4 $\\times$ 10$^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$) from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey, DR7. Based on this measurement, we assign each galaxy\nto a surface-brightness profile type (Type I $\\equiv$ single-exponential, Type\nII $\\equiv$ truncated, Type III $\\equiv$ anti-truncated). In addition, we\nmeasure (g-r) restframe colour for disc regions separated by the break radius.\nCluster disc galaxies (at the same stellar mass) have redder (g-r) colour by\n$\\sim$0.2 mag than field galaxies. This reddening is slightly more pronounced\noutside the break radius. Cluster disc galaxies also show larger global\nS\\'ersic-indices and are more compact than field discs, both by $\\sim$15\\%.\nThis change is connected to a flattening of the (outer) surface-brightness\nprofile of Type I and - more significantly - of Type III galaxies by $\\sim$8\\%\nand $\\sim$16\\%, respectively, in the cluster environment compared to the field.\nWe find fractions of Type I, II and III of (6$\\pm$2)\\%, (66$\\pm$4)\\% and\n(29$\\pm$4)\\% in the field and (15$_{-4}^{+7}$)\\%, (56$\\pm$7)\\% and (29$\\pm$7)\\%\nin the cluster environment, respectively. We suggest that the larger abundance\nof Type I galaxies in clusters (matched by a corresponding decrease in the Type\nII fraction) could be the signature of a transition between Type II and Type I\ngalaxies produced/enhanced by environment-driven mechanisms.\n", "  In the two zero flavor neutrino mass matrix scheme with nonvanishing Majorana\neffective mass $M_{ee}$ for the neutrino less double beta decay, four textures\nare compatible with observed data. We obtain the complete list of the possible\ntextures of four zero Dirac neutrino mass matrix $m_D$ in the seesaw mechanism\nproviding these four flavor neutrino textures. Explicit analytical analysis of\n$m_D$ turns out to provide the relation of $m_D \\propto \\sqrt{M_{ee}}$.\n", "  The Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites (ISLAndS)\nproject uses Hubble Space Telescope imaging to study a representative sample of\nsix Andromeda dSph satellite companion galaxies. The main goal of the program\nis to determine whether the star formation histories (SFHs) of the Andromeda\ndSph satellites demonstrate significant statistical differences from those of\nthe Milky Way, which may be attributable to the different properties of their\nlocal environments. Our observations reach the oldest main sequence turn-offs,\nallowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of ~ 1 Gyr, which is comparable\nto the best achievable resolution in the MW satellites. We find that the six\ndSphs present a variety of SFHs that are not strictly correlated with\nluminosity or present distance from M31. Specifically, we find a significant\nrange in quenching times (lookback times from 9 to 6 Gyr), but with all\nquenching times more than ~ 6 Gyr ago. In agreement with observations of Milky\nWay companions of similar mass, there is no evidence of complete quenching of\nstar formation by the cosmic UV background responsible for reionization, but\nthe possibility of a degree of quenching at reionization cannot be ruled out.\nWe do not find significant differences between the SFHs of the three members of\nthe vast, thin plane of satellites and the three off-plane dSphs. The primary\ndifference between the SFHs of the ISLAndS dSphs and Milky Way dSph companions\nof similar luminosities and host distances is the absence of very late\nquenching (< 5 Gyr ago) dSphs in the ISLAndS sample. Thus, models that can\nreproduce satellite populations with and without late quenching satellites will\nbe of extreme interest.\n", "  Euclidean field theories admit more general deformations than usually\ndiscussed in quantum field theories because of mixing between rotational\nsymmetry and internal symmetry (a.k.a topological twist). Such deformations may\nbe relevant, and if the subsequent renormalization group flow leads to a\nnon-trivial fixed point, it generically gives rise to a scale invariant\nEuclidean field theory without conformal invariance. Motivated by an ansatz\nstudied in cosmological models some time ago, we develop a holographic dual\ndescription of such renormalization group flows in the context of AdS/CFT. We\nargue that the non-trivial fixed points require fine-tuning of the bulk theory\nin general, but remarkably we find that the $O(3)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled\nwith the four-dimensional Einstein gravity in the minimal manner supports such\na background with the Euclidean AdS metric.\n", "  This work aims at exploring the scaling relations among rocky exoplanets.\nWith the assumption of internal gravity increasing linearly in the core, and\nstaying constant in the mantle, and tested against numerical simulations, a\nsimple model is constructed, applicable to rocky exoplanets of core mass\nfraction (CMF) $\\in 0.1\\sim0.4$ and mass $\\in 0.1 \\sim 10 M_{\\oplus}$. Various\nscaling relations are derived: (1) core radius fraction $\\rm CRF \\approx\n\\sqrt{CMF}$, (2) Typical interior pressure $P_{\\text{typical}} \\sim\ng_{\\rm{s}}^2$ (surface gravity squared), (3) core formation energy $E_{\\rm\ndiff} \\sim \\frac{1}{10} E_{\\rm grav}$ (the total gravitational energy), (4)\neffective heat capacity of the mantle $C_{\\rm p}\\approx \\left(\n\\frac{M_{\\rm{p}}}{M_{\\oplus}} \\right) \\cdot 7 \\cdot 10^{27}$ J K$^{-1}$, and\n(5) the moment of inertia $I\\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot M_{\\rm{p}} \\cdot\nR_{\\rm{p}}^2$. These scaling relations, though approximate, are handy for quick\nuse owing to their simplicity and lucidity, and provide insights into the\ninterior structures of rocky exoplanets. As examples, this model is applied to\nseveral planets including Earth, GJ 1132b, Kepler-93b, and Kepler-20b, and made\ncomparison with the numerical method.\n", "  A unified view on the phenomenon of monogamy exhibited by Bell inequalities\nand non-contextuality inequalities arising from the no-signaling and\nno-disturbance principles is presented using the graph-theoretic method\nintroduced in \\textit{Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050404 (2012)}. We propose a novel\ntype of trade-off, namely Bell inequalities that do not exhibit monogamy\nfeatures of their own can be activated to be monogamous by the addition of a\nlocal contextuality term. This is illustrated by means of the well-known\n$\\mathcal{I}_{3322}$ inequality, and reveals a resource trade-off between\nbipartite correlations and the local purity of a single system. In the\nderivation of novel no-signaling monogamies, we uncover a new feature, namely\nthat two-party Bell expressions that are trivially classically saturated can\nbecome non-trivial upon the addition of an expression involving a third party\nwith a single measurement input.\n", "  Based on a formalism that describes atom-light interactions in terms of the\nclassical electromagnetic Green's function, we study the optical response of\natoms and other quantum emitters coupled to one-dimensional photonic\nstructures, such as cavities, waveguides, and photonic crystals. We demonstrate\na clear mapping between the transmission spectra and the local Green's function\nthat allows to identify signatures of dispersive and dissipative interactions\nbetween atoms. We also demonstrate the applicability of our analysis to\nproblems involving three-level atoms, such as electromagnetically induced\ntransparency. Finally we examine recent experiments, and anticipate future\nobservations of atom-atom interactions in photonic bandgaps.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate the strictly nonclassical behavior in a\nmany-atom system using a recently derived criterion [E. Kot et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 108, 233601 (2012)] that explicitly does not make use of quantum\nmechanics. We thereby show that the magnetic moment distribution measured by\nMcConnell et al. [R. McConnell et al., Nature 519, 439 (2015)] in a system with\na total mass of $2.6\\times 10^5$ atomic mass units is inconsistent with\nclassical physics. Notably, the strictly nonclassical behavior affects an area\nin phase space $10^3$ times larger than the Planck quantum $\\hbar$.\n", "  In this review, we present a derivation of the on-shell renormalization\nconditions for scalar and fermionic fields in theories with and without parity\nconservation. We also discuss the specifics of Majorana fermions. Our approach\nonly assumes a canonical form for the renormalized propagators and exploits the\nfact that the inverse propagators are non-singular in $\\varepsilon = p^2 -\nm_n^2$, where $p$ is the external four-momentum and $m_n$ is a pole mass. In\nthis way, we obtain full agreement with commonly used on-shell conditions. We\nalso discuss how they are implemented in renormalization.\n", "  Galaxy populations at different cosmic epochs are often linked together by\ncomoving cumulative number density in observational studies. Many theoretical\nworks, however, have shown that the number densities of tracked galaxy\npopulations evolve in bulk and spread out over time. We present a number\ndensity method for linking progenitor and descendant galaxy populations which\ntakes both of these effects into account. We define probability distribution\nfunctions that capture the evolution and dispersion of galaxy populations in\ncomoving number density space, and use these functions to assign galaxies at\none redshift $z_f$ probabilities of being progenitors or descendants of a\ngalaxy population at another redshift $z_0$. These probabilities are then used\nas weights for calculating distributions of physical properties such as stellar\nmass, star formation rate, or velocity dispersion within the\nprogenitor/descendant population. We demonstrate that this probabilistic method\nprovides more accurate predictions for the evolution of physical properties\nthen either the assumption of a constant number density or the assumption of an\nevolving number density in a bin of fixed width by comparing the predictions\nagainst galaxy populations directly tracked through a cosmological simulation.\nWe find that the constant number density method performs most poorly at\nrecovering galaxy properties, the evolving number method density slightly\nbetter, and the probabilistic number density method best of all. The\nimprovement is present for predictions of both stellar mass as well as inferred\nquantities such as star formation rate and velocity dispersion which were not\nincluded in the number density fits. We demonstrate that this method can also\nbe applied robustly and easily to observational data, and provide a code\npackage for doing so.\n", "  Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of\nindustrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations.\nHowever, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community,\nuniversally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still\nlacking. Recently, data-driven methods have been proposed as a promising\nalternative to the traditional approaches of turbulence model development. In\nthis work we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach\nfor predicting discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The\ndiscrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a\nmodern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy\nfunctions are first trained with benchmark flow data and then used to predict\nReynolds stresses discrepancies in new flows. The method is used to predict the\nReynolds stresses in the flow over periodic hills by using two training flow\nscenarios of increasing difficulties: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills\ngeometry yet at a lower Reynolds number, and (2) the flow in a different hill\ngeometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances\nwere observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed\nmethod. Improvement of RANS modeled Reynolds stresses enabled by the proposed\nmethod is an important step towards predictive turbulence modeling, where the\nultimate goal is to predict the quantities of interest (e.g., velocity field,\ndrag, lift) more accurately by solving RANS equations with the Reynolds\nstresses obtained therefrom.\n", "  We use the Chern-Simons (CS) fermion representation of s =1/2 spin operators\nto construct topological, long-range magnetically ordered states of interacting\ntwo-dimensional (2D) quantum spin models. We show that the fermion-fermion\ninteractions mediated by the dynamic CS flux attachment may give rise to Cooper\npairing of the fermions. Specifically, in an XY model on the honeycomb lattice,\nthis construction leads to a \"CS superconductor,\" which belongs to a\ntopologically non-trivial in 2D symmetry class DIII, with particle-hole and\ntime-reversal symmetries. It is shown that in the original spin language, this\nstate corresponds to a symmetry protected topological state, which coexists\nwith a magnetic long-range order. We discuss physical manifestations of the\ntopological character of the corresponding state and requirements for models\nthat could host it.\n", "  A recent burst of dynamic single-cell growth-division data makes it possible\nto characterize the stochastic dynamics of cell division control in bacteria.\nDifferent modeling frameworks were used to infer specific mechanisms from such\ndata, but the links between frameworks are poorly explored, with relevant\nconsequences for how well any particular mechanism can be supported by the\ndata. Here, we describe a simple and generic framework in which two common\nformalisms can be used interchangeably: (i) a continuous-time division process\ndescribed by a hazard function and (ii) a discrete-time equation describing\ncell size across generations (where the unit of time is a cell cycle). In our\nframework, this second process is a discrete-time Langevin equation with a\nsimple physical analogue. By perturbative expansion around the mean initial\nsize (or inter-division time), we show explicitly how this framework describes\na wide range of division control mechanisms, including combinations of time and\nsize control, as well as the constant added size mechanism recently found to\ncapture several aspects of the cell division behavior of different bacteria. As\nwe show by analytical estimates and numerical simulation, the available data\nare characterized with great precision by the first-order approximation of this\nexpansion. Hence, a single dimensionless parameter defines the strength and the\naction of the division control. However, this parameter may emerge from several\nmechanisms, which are distinguished only by higher-order terms in our\nperturbative expansion. An analytical estimate of the sample size needed to\ndistinguish between second-order effects shows that this is larger than what is\navailable in the current datasets. These results provide a unified framework\nfor future studies and clarify the relevant parameters at play in the control\nof cell division.\n", "  We present deep stellar photometry of the Bo\\\"otes I dwarf spheroidal galaxy\nin g and i band filters, taken with the Dark Energy Camera at Cerro Tololo in\nChile. Our analysis reveals a large, extended region of stellar substructure\nsurrounding the dwarf, as well as a distinct over-density encroaching on its\ntidal radius. A radial profile of the Bo\\\"otes I stellar distribution shows a\nbreak radius indicating the presence of extra-tidal stars. These observations\nstrongly suggest that Bo\\\"otes I is experiencing tidal disruption, although not\nas extreme as that exhibited by the Hercules dwarf spheroidal. Combined with\nrevised velocity dispersion measurements from the literature, we see evidence\nsuggesting the need to review previous theoretical models of the Bo\\\"otes I\ndwarf spheroidal galaxy.\n", "  The concept of cyclic tridiagonal pairs is introduced, and explicit examples\nare given. For a fairly general class of cyclic tridiagonal pairs with\ncyclicity N, we associate a pair of `divided polynomials'. The properties of\nthis pair generalize the ones of tridiagonal pairs of Racah type. The algebra\ngenerated by the pair of divided polynomials is identified as a higher-order\ngeneralization of the Onsager algebra. It can be viewed as a subalgebra of the\nq-Onsager algebra for a proper specialization at q the primitive 2Nth root of\nunity. Orthogonal polynomials beyond the Leonard duality are revisited in light\nof this framework. In particular, certain second-order Dunkl shift operators\nprovide a realization of the divided polynomials at N=2 or q=i.\n", "  Experimental results of the rapidity spectra of protons and net-protons\n(protons minus antiprotons) emitted in gold-gold (Au-Au) and lead-lead (Pb-Pb)\ncollisions, measured by a few collaborations at the alternating gradient\nsynchrotron (AGS), super proton synchrotron (SPS), and relativistic heavy ion\ncollider (RHIC), are described by a three-source distribution. The values of\nthe distribution width $\\sigma_C$ and contribution ratio (relative\ncontribution) $k_C$ of the central rapidity region, and the distribution width\n$\\sigma_F$ and rapidity shift $\\Delta y$ of the forward/backward rapidity\nregions, are then obtained. The excitation function of $\\sigma_C$ increases\ngenerally with increase of the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The excitation function of $\\sigma_F$ shows a saturation at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.8$ GeV. The excitation function of $k_C$ shows a minimum at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.8$ GeV and a saturation at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}\\approx 17$ GeV. The\nexcitation function of $\\Delta y$ increase monotonously with $\\ln\n\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ in the considered energy range.\n", "  IceCube has detected a cumulative flux of PeV neutrinos, which origin is\nunknown. Blazars, active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing to us,\nare long and widely expected to be one of the strong candidates of high energy\nneutrino sources. The neutrino production depends strongly on the cosmic ray\npower of blazar jets, which is largely unknown. The recent null results in\nstacking searches of neutrinos for several blazar samples by IceCube put upper\nlimits on the neutrino fluxes from these blazars. Here we compute the cosmic\nray power and PeV neutrino flux of Fermi-LAT blazars, and find that the upper\nlimits for known blazar sources give stringent constraint on the cosmic ray\nloading factor of blazar jets (i.e., the ratio of the cosmic ray to bolometric\nradiation luminosity of blazar jets), $\\xi_{\\rm cr}\\la(2-10)\\zeta^{-1}$ (with\n$\\zeta\\la1$ the remained fraction of cosmic ray energy when propagate into the\nblazar broad line region) for flat cosmic ray spectrum, and that the cumulative\nPeV neutrino flux contributed by all-sky blazars is a fraction $\\la(10-50)\\%$\nof the IceCube detected flux.\n", "  Wishart ensemble is a useful and important random matrix model used in\ndiverse fields. By realizing induced random mixed quantum states as Wishart\nensemble with the fixed-trace one, using matrix integral technique we give a\nfast track to the average coherence for random mixed quantum states induced via\npartial-tracing of the Haar-distributed bipartite pure states. As a direct\nconsequence of this result, we get a compact formula of the average subentropy\nof random mixed states. These obtained compact formulae extend our previous\nwork.\n", "  Extending general relativity by adding extra degrees of freedom is a popular\napproach for explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe and to build\nhigh energy completions of the theory of gravity. The presence of such new\ndegrees of freedom is, however, tightly constrained from several observations\nand experiments that aim to test general relativity in a wide range of scales.\nThe viability of a given modified theory of gravity, therefore, strongly\ndepends on the existence of a screening mechanism that suppresses the extra\ndegrees of freedom. We perform simulations, and find that waves propagating in\nthe new degrees of freedom can significantly impact the efficiency of some\nscreening mechanisms, thereby threatening the viability of these modified\ngravity theories. Specifically, we show that the waves produced in the\nsymmetron model can increase the amplitude of the fifth force and the\nparametrized post-Newtonian parameters by several orders of magnitude.\n", "  We study a 2D cellular automaton (CA) model for the evolution of coronal loop\nplasmas. The model is based on the idea that coronal loops are made of\nelementary magnetic strands that are tangled and stressed by the displacement\nof their footpoints by photospheric motions. The magnetic stress accumulated\nbetween neighbor strands is released in sudden reconnection events or\nnanoflares that heat the plasma. We combine the CA model with the Enthalpy\nBased Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) model to compute the response of the\nplasma to the heating events. Using the known response of the XRT telescope on\nboard Hinode we also obtain synthetic data. The model obeys easy to understand\nscaling laws relating the output (nanoflare energy, temperature, density,\nintensity) to the input parameters (field strength, strand length, critical\nmisalignment angle). The nanoflares have a power-law distribution with a\nuniversal slope of -2.5, independent of the input parameters. The repetition\nfrequency of nanoflares, expressed in terms of the plasma cooling time,\nincreases with strand length. We discuss the implications of our results for\nthe problem of heating and evolution of active region coronal plasmas.\n", "  Motivated by a di-photon anomaly observed by ATLAS and CMS we develop an\nSFitter analysis for a combined electroweak-Higgs sector, and a scalar portal\nat the LHC. The theoretical description is based on the linear effective\nLagrangian for the Higgs and gauge fields, combined with an additional singlet\nscalar. The key feature is the extraction of reliable information on the portal\nstructure of the combined scalar potential. For the specific di-photon anomaly\nwe find that the new state might well form such a Higgs portal. To obtain more\nconclusive results we define and test the connection of the Wilson coefficients\nin the Higgs and heavy scalar sectors, as suggested by a portal setup.\n", "  Models with two scalar doublets are among the simplest extensions of the\nStandard Model which fulfill the relation $\\rho = 1$ at lowest order for the\n$\\rho$ parameter as favored by experimental data for electroweak observables\nallowing only small deviations from unity. Such small deviations $\\Delta\\rho$\noriginate exclusively from quantum effects with special sensitivity to mass\nsplittings between different isospin components of fermions and scalars. In\nthis paper the dominant two-loop electroweak corrections to $\\Delta\\rho$ are\ncalculated in the $CP$-conserving THDM, resulting from the top-Yukawa coupling\nand the self-couplings of the Higgs bosons in the gauge-less limit. The\non-shell renormalization scheme is applied. With the assumption that one of the\n$CP$-even neutral scalars represents the scalar boson observed by the LHC\nexperiments, with standard properties, the two-loop non-standard contributions\nin $\\Delta\\rho$ can be separated from the standard ones. These contributions\nare of particular interest since they increase with mass splittings between\nnon-standard Higgs bosons and can be additionally enhanced by $\\tan\\beta$ and\n$\\lambda_5$, an additional free coefficient of the Higgs potential, and can\nthus modify the one-loop result substantially. Numerical results are given for\nthe dependence on the various non-standard parameters, and the influence on the\ncalculation of electroweak precision observables is discussed.\n", "  We study the stabilities of (A)dS charged Gauss-Bonnet(GB) black holes in the\nlarge $D$ dimensions. After integrating the equation of motion with respect to\nthe radial direction, we obtain the effective equations at large $D$ to\ndescribe the nonlinear dynamical deformations of the black hole. From the\nperturbation analysis of the effective equations, we get the analytic\nexpressions of the frequencies for the quasinormal modes of scalar type.\nFurthermore we show that the charged GB black hole becomes unstable only if the\ncosmological constant is positive, otherwise the black hole is always stable.\nAt the onset of instabilities there is a non-trivial static zero-mode\nperturbation, which suggests the existence of a new non-spherical symmetric\nsolution branch of static dS charged GB black holes. We construct the\nnon-spherical symmetric static solution of the large $D$ effective equations\nexplicitly.\n", "  It has been argued that charged Ads black holes have similar thermodynamic\nbehavior as the Van der Waals fluid system, provided one treats the\ncosmological constant as a thermodynamic variable in an extended phase space.\nIn this paper, we disclose the deep connection between charged AdS black holes\nand Van der Waals fluid system without extending the phase space. We keep the\ncosmological constant as a fixed parameter and instead, treat the square of the\ncharge of black hole as a thermodynamic variable. Therefore, we write the\nequation of state as $Q^{2}=Q^{2}(T,\\Psi)$ where $\\Psi$ (conjugate of $Q^{2} $)\nis the inverse of the specific volume, $\\Psi=1/v$. This allows us to complete\nthe analogy of charged AdS black holes with Van der Waals fluid system and\nderive the phase transition as well as critical exponents of the system. We\nidentify a thermodynamic instability in this new picture with real analogy to\nVan der Waals fluid with physically relevant Maxwell construction. We therefore\nstudy the critical behavior of isotherms in $% Q^2-\\Psi$ diagram and deduce all\nthe critical exponents of the system and determine that the system exhibits a\nsmall-large black hole phase transition at the critical point $(T_c,Q^2_c,\n\\Psi_c)$. This alternative view is important as one can imagine such a change\nfor a given single black hole i. e. acquiring charge which induces the phase\ntransition. Finally, we disclose the microscopic properties of charged AdS\nblack holes by using thermodynamic geometry. Interestingly, we find that scalar\ncurvature has a gap between small and large black holes, and this gap becomes\nexceedingly large as one moves away from the critical point along the\ntransition line. Therefore, we are able to attribute the sudden enlargement of\nthe black hole to the strong repulsive nature of the internal constituents at\nthe phase transition.\n", "  We use the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass relation to constrain galaxy\nevolution models. If the efficiency of converting accreted baryons into stars\nvaries with time, halos of the same present-day mass but different formation\nhistories will have different z=0 galaxy stellar mass. This is one of the\nsources of scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass, $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$.\nFor massive halos that undergo rapid quenching of star formation at z~2,\ndifferent mechanisms that trigger this quenching yield different values of\n$\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$. We use this framework to test various models in which\nquenching begins after a galaxy crosses a threshold in one of the following\nphysical quantities: redshift, halo mass, stellar mass, and stellar-to-halo\nmass ratio. Our model is highly idealized, with other sources of scatter likely\nto arise as more physics is included. Thus, our test is whether a model can\nproduce scatter lower than observational bounds, leaving room for other\nsources. Recent measurements find $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}=0.16$ dex for 10^11 Msol\ngalaxies. Under the assumption that the threshold is constant with time, such a\nlow value of $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ rules out all of these models with the\nexception of quenching by a stellar mass treshold. Most physical quantities,\nsuch as metallicity, will increase scatter if they are uncorrelated with halo\nformation history. Thus, to decrease the scatter of a given model, galaxy\nproperties would correlate tightly with formation history, creating testable\npredictions for their clustering. Understanding why $\\sigma_{\\log M\\ast}$ is so\nsmall may be key to understanding the physics of galaxy formation.\n", "  In the context of fast developing quantum technologies, locating single\nquantum objects embedded in solid or fluid environment while keeping their\nproperties unchanged is a crucial requirement as well as a challenge. Such\n\"quantum microscopes\" have been demonstrated already for NV-centers embedded in\ndiamond [1], and for single atoms within an ultracold gas [2]. In this work, we\ndemonstrate a new method to determine non-destructively the position of\nrandomly distributed semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) deeply embedded in a\nsolid photonic waveguide. By setting the wire in an oscillating motion, we\ngenerate large stress gradients across the QDs plane. We then exploit the fact\nthat the QDs emission frequency is highly sensitive to the local material\nstress [3-5] to infer their positions with an accuracy ranging from +/- 35 nm\ndown to +/-1 nm for close-to-axis QDs.\n", "  We present ALMA ultra-high-spatial resolution ($\\sim 20 \\, {\\rm mas}$)\nobservations of dust continuum at $920 \\, {\\rm \\mu m}$ and $1.2 \\, {\\rm mm}$ in\na pair of submm galaxies (SMGs) at $z = 3.442$, ALMACAL-1 (A-1: $S_{\\rm 870 \\mu\nm} = 6.5 \\pm 0.2 \\, {\\rm mJy}$) and ALMACAL-2 (A-2: $S_{\\rm 870 \\mu m} = 4.4\n\\pm 0.2 \\, {\\rm mJy}$). The spectroscopic redshifts of A-1 and A-2 have been\nconfirmed via serendipitous detection of up to nine emission lines. Our\nultra-high-spatial resolution data reveal that about half of the star formation\nin each of these starbursts is dominated by a single compact clump (FWHM size\nof $\\sim 350 \\, {\\rm pc}$). This structure is confirmed by independent datasets\nat $920 \\, {\\rm \\mu m}$ and $1.2 \\, {\\rm mm}$. The star-formation rate (SFR)\nsurface densities of all these clumps are extremely high, $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\n\\sim 1200$ to $\\sim 3000 \\, {M_\\odot \\, {\\rm yr}^{-1} \\, {\\rm kpc}^{-2}}$, the\nhighest found in high-redshift galaxies. There is a small probability that A-1\nand A-2 are the lensed components of a background source gravitationally\namplified by the blazar host. If this was the case, the effective radius of the\nsource would be $R_{\\rm eff} \\sim 40 \\, {\\rm pc}$, and the de-magnified SFR\nsurface density would be $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR} \\sim 10000 \\, {M_\\odot \\, {\\rm\nyr}^{-1} \\, {\\rm kpc}^{-2}}$, comparable with the eastern nucleus of Arp 220.\nDespite being unable to rule out an AGN contribution, our results suggest that\na significant percentage of the enormous far-IR luminosity in some dusty\nstarbursts is concentrated in very small star-forming regions. The high\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ in our pair of SMGs could only be measured thanks to the\nultra-high-resolution ALMA observations used in this work, demonstrating that\nlong-baseline observations are essential to study and interpret the properties\nof dusty starbursts in the early Universe.\n", "  We consider a fermionic Hubbard chain with an additional next-to-nearest\nneighbor hopping term. We study the thermalization rates of the quasi-momentum\ndistribution function within a quantum Boltzmann equation approach. We find\nthat the thermalization rates are proportional to the square of the\nnext-to-nearest neighbor hopping: Even weak next-to-nearest neighbor hopping in\naddition to nearest neighbor hopping leads to thermalization in a two-particle\nscattering quantum Boltzmann equation in one dimension. We also investigate the\ntemperature dependence of the thermalization rates, which away from half\nfilling become exponentially small for small temperature of the final\nthermalized distribution.\n", "  In a recent review Mohapatra has discussed how type-I seesaw mechanism\nsuppressed by fine tuning of Yukawa couplings, or specific textures of\nassociated fermion mass matrices, can form the basis of neutrino masses in TeV\nscale $W_R$ boson models. In this paper we review recent works in another class\nof theories where the added presence of fermion singlets manifesting as sterile\nneutrinos render the type-I seesaw contribution vanishing but extended seesaw\ndominant where the light neutrino mass formula is same as the classic inverse\nseesaw but all massive neutrinos are Majorana fermions. We also show domunance\nof linear seesaw, or double seesaw, or type-II seesaw in due to cancellation of\ntype-I seesaw. Embeddings of this mechnism in supersymmetric as well as\nnon-supersymmetric SO(10) with low or intermediate masses of $W_R$ or $Z_R$\nbosons are discussed. We also discuss how this cancellation criteria has led to\na new mechanism of type-II seesaw dominance which permits $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking\nscale much smaller than the left-handed triplet mass. Out of a number of new\nobservable predictions, the most visible ones are the dominant contribution to\nLFV decays and neutrinoless double beta decay mediated by light sterile\nneutrinos in the $W_L-W_L$ channel. These seesaw dominance mechanisms are\napplicable in the extensions of the SM and high, intermediate, or low scale\nleft-right gauge theories with or without their SO(10) origin. Other recent\nworks on the applications of this mechanism covering dark matter and\nleptogenesis are noted..\n", "  The dynamics of a 3D bimodal turbulent wake downstream a square-back Ahmed\nbody are experimentally studied in a wind-tunnel through high-frequency wall\npressure probes mapping the rear of the model and a horizontal 2D velocity\nfield. The barycenters of the pressure distribution over the rear part of the\nmodel and the intensity recirculation are found highly correlated. Both\ndescribed the most energetic large-scale structures dynamics, confirming the\nrelation between the large-scale recirculation bubble and its wall pressure\nfoot-print. Focusing on the pressure, its barycenter trajectory has a\nstochastic behavior but its low frequencies dynamics exhibit the same\ncharacteristics as a weak strange chaotic attractor system, with two well\ndefined attractors. The low frequencies dynamics associated to the large-scale\nstructures are then analyzed. The largest Lyapunov exponent is first estimated,\nleading to a low positive value characteristic of strange attractors and weak\nchaotic systems. Afterwards, analyzing the autocorrelation function of the\ntime-series, we compute the correlation dimension, larger than two. The signal\nis finally transformed and analyzed as a telegraph signal showing that its\ndynamics correspond to a quasi-random telegraph signal. This is the first\ndemonstration that the low frequencies dynamics of a turbulent 3D wake are not\na purely stochastic process but rather a weak chaotic process exhibiting\nstrange attractors. From the flow-control point of view, it also opens the path\nto more simple closed-loop flow control strategies aiming at the stabilization\nof the wake and the control of the dynamics of the wake barycenter.\n", "  We discuss the possibility to indirectly test First Order Phase Transitions\nof hidden sectors. We study the interesting example of a {\\it dark standard\nmodel} with a deformed parameter space in the Higgs potential. A dark\nelectroweak phase transition can be limited from next future experiments like\neLISA and DECIGO.\n", "  The source-free Maxwell action is invariant under electric-magnetic duality\nrotations in arbitrary spacetimes. This leads to a conserved classical Noether\ncharge. We show that this conservation law is broken at the quantum level in\npresence of a background classical gravitational field with a non-trivial\nChern-Pontryagin invariant, in a parallel way to the chiral anomaly for\nmassless Dirac fermions. Among the physical consequences, the net polarization\nof the quantum electromagnetic field is not conserved.\n", "  The electromagnetic implementation of cloaking, the hiding of objects from\nsight by diverting and reassembling illuminating electromagnetic fields has now\nbeen with us ten years, while the notion of hiding events is now five. Both\nschemes as initially presented neglected the inevitable dispersion that arises\nwhen a designed medium replaces vacuum under transformation. Here we define a\ntransformation design protocol that incorporates both spacetime transformations\nand dispersive material responses in a natural and rigorous way. We show how\nthis methodology is applied to an event cloak designed to appear as a\nhomogeneous and isotropic but dispersive medium. The consequences for spacetime\ntransformation design in dispersive materials are discussed, and some parameter\nand bandwidth constraints identified.\n", "  The crucial parameter of the current Monte Carlo models of high energy\nhadron-hadron interaction is the transverse momentum cutoff $p_{T0}$ for\nparton-parton interactions which slowly grows with energy and regularizes the\ncross section. This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In\nthis work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$\nand a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a\nlimit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum\ndisbalance spectrum. Minijet cross section and its suppression is then analyzed\nin two ways. First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and\ndemonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the\ninclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to\nthe increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard\ninclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets\nproduce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from\ndifferential cross section in the ratio $\\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the\naverage dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\\tau>1$ region is sensitive to\nthe cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models. The energy dependence of the\ncutoff is reflected in the energy dependence of the bimodality coefficient $b$\nof the $\\tau$ distribution. We compare $b$ calculated from $\\mathsf{pythia}$,\nwhere one can conveniently control MPIs by the program parameters, and HEF for\na few unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDs). We find that the energy\ndependence of $b$ is very sensitive to the particular choice of UGD and in some\nmodels it resembles predictions of the Monte Carlo models.\n", "  A certain class of nonlocal theories eliminates an arbitrary cosmological\nconstant (CC) from a universe that can be perceived as our world. Dark energy\nthen cannot be explained by a CC; it could however be due to massive gravity.\nWe calculate the new corrections, which originate from the nonlocal terms that\neliminate the CC, to the decoupling limit Lagrangian of massive gravity. The\nnew nonlocal terms also have internal field space Galilean symmetry and are\nreferred here as \"nonlocal Galileons.\" We then study a self-accelerated\nsolution and show that the new nonlocal terms change the perturbative stability\nanalysis. In particular, small fluctuations are now stable and non-superluminal\nfor some simple parameter choices, whereas for the same choices the pure\nmassive gravity fluctuations are unstable. We also study stable spherically\nsymmetric solutions on this background.\n", "  We present results of a high-resolution zoom cosmological simulation of the\nevolution of a low-mass galaxy with a maximum velocity of V=100 km/s at z=0,\nusing the initial conditions from the AGORA project (Kim et al. 2014). The\nfinal disc-dominated galaxy is consistent with local disc scaling relations,\nsuch as the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the baryonic Tully-Fisher. The\ngalaxy evolves from a compact, dispersion-dominated galaxy into a\nrotation-dominated but dynamically hot disc in about 0.5 Gyr (from z=1.4 to\nz=1.2). The disc dynamically cools down for the following 7 Gyr, as the gas\nvelocity dispersion decreases over time, in agreement with observations. The\nprimary cause of this slow evolution of velocity dispersion in this low-mass\ngalaxy is stellar feedback. It is related to the decline in gas fraction, and\nto the associated gravitational disk instability, as the disc slowly settles\nfrom a global Toomre Q>1 turbulent disc to a marginally unstable disc (Q=1).\n", "  We study the temperature of rotating probe D7-branes, dual to the temperature\nof flavored quarks, in the Kuperstein--Sonnenschein holographic model including\nthe effects of spontaneous breakdown of the conformal and chiral flavor\nsymmetry. The model embeds probe D7-branes into the Klebanov-Witten gravity\ndual of conformal gauge theory, with the embedding parameter, given by the\nminimal radial extension of the probe, setting the IR scale of conformal and\nchiral flavor symmetry breakdown. We show that when the minimal extension is\npositive definite and additional spin is turned on, the induced world volume\nmetrics on the probe admit thermal horizons and Hawking temperatures despite\nthe absence of black holes in the bulk. We find the scale and behavior of the\ntemperature in flavored quarks are determined notably by the IR scale of\nsymmetry breaking, and by the strength and sort of external fields. We also\nderive the energy--stress tensor of the rotating probe and study its\nbackreaction and energy dissipation. We show that at the IR scale the\nbackreaction is non-negligible and find the energy can flow from the probe to\nthe bulk, dual to the energy dissipation from the flavor sector into the gauge\ntheory.\n", "  Recently (Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015), 210402) the influence of the so called\n\"Wigner translations\" (more generally-Lorentz trans- formations) on circularly\npolarized Gaussian packets ( providing the solution to Maxwell equations in\nparaxial approximation) has been studied. It appears that, within this\napproximation, the Wigner trans- lations have an efect of shifting the wave\npacket trajectory parallel to itself by an amount proportional to the photon\nhelicity. It has been suggested that this shift may result from specific\nproperties of the algebra of Poincare generators for massless particles. In the\npresent letter we describe the general relation between transformation proper-\nties of electromagnetic field on quantum and classical levels. It allows for a\nstraightforward derivation of the helicity-dependent transforma- tion rules. We\npresent also an elementary derivation of the formula for sideways shift based\non classical Maxwell theory. Some comments are made concerning the\ngeneralization to higher helicities and the relation to the coordinate operator\ndefined long time ago by Pryce.\n", "  A new two-dimensional (2D) material, borophene (2D boron sheet), has been\ngrown successfully recently on single crystal Ag substrates by two parallel\nexperiments [Mannix \\textit{et al., Science}, 2015, \\textbf{350}, 1513] [Feng\n\\textit{et al., Nature Chemistry}, 2016, \\textbf{advance online publication}].\nThree main structures have been proposed ($\\beta_{12}$, $\\chi_3$ and striped\nborophene). However, the stability of three structures is still in debate.\nUsing first principles calculations, we examine the dynamical, thermodynamical\nand mechanical stability of $\\beta_{12}$, $\\chi_3$ and striped borophene.\nFree-standing $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ borophene is dynamically,\nthermodynamically, and mechanically stable, while striped borophene is\ndynamically and thermodynamically unstable due to high stiffness along $a$\ndirection. The origin of high stiffness and high instability in striped\nborophene along $a$ direction can both be attributed to strong directional\nbonding. This work provides a benchmark for examining the relative stability of\ndifferent structures of borophene.\n", "  Domain wall propagation dynamics have been studied in nanostructured\nartificial kagome spin ice structures. A stripline circuit has been used to\nprovide localised pulsed magnetic fields within the artificial spin ice\nstructure. This provides control of the system through electrically assisted\ndomain wall nucleation events. Synchronisation of the pulsed fields with\nadditional global magnetic fields and the use of a focussed magneto-optical\nKerr effect magnetometer allows our experiments to probe the domain wall\ntransit through an extended ASI structure. We find that the propagation\ndistance depends on the driving field revealing field driven properties of\ndomain walls below their intrinsic nucleation field.\n", "  We start from the polynomic interatomic potentials introduced by Wojde{\\l} et\nal. [J. Phys. Condens. Matt. 25, 305401(2013)] and take advantage of one of\ntheir key features -- namely, the linear dependence of the energy on the\npotential's adjustable parameters -- to devise a scheme for the construction of\nfirst-principles-based ({\\em second-principles}) models for large-scale\nlattice-dynamical simulations. Our method presents the following convenient\nfeatures. The parameters of the model are computed in a very fast and efficient\nway, as it is possible to recast the fit to a training set of first-principles\ndata into a simple matrix diagonalization problem. Our method selects\nautomatically the interactions that are most relevant to reproduce the\ntraining-set data, by choosing from a pool that includes virtually all possible\ncoupling terms, and produces a family of models of increasing complexity and\naccuracy. We work with practical and convenient cross-validation criteria\nlinked to the physical properties that will be relevant in future simulations\nbased on the new model, and which greatly facilitate the task of identifying a\npotential that is simultaneously simple (thus computationally light), very\naccurate, and predictive. We also discuss practical ways to guarantee that our\nenergy models are bounded from below, with a minimal impact on their accuracy.\nFinally, we demonstrate our scheme with an application to ferroelastic\nperovskite SrTiO$_{3}$, which features many non-trivial lattice-dynamical\nfeatures (e.g., a phase transition driven by soft phonons, competing structural\ninstabilities, highly anharmonic dynamics) and provides a very demanding test.\n", "  Experimental results for mesonic $b \\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decays show a pattern\nof deviations from Standard-Model predictions, which could be due to new\nfundamental physics or due to an insufficient understanding of hadronic\neffects. Additional information on the $b \\to s \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ transition can be\nobtained from $\\Lambda_b$ decays. This was recently done using the process\n$\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, where the $\\Lambda$ is the lightest\nstrange baryon. A further interesting channel is $\\Lambda_b \\to p^+ K^- \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$, where the $p^+ K^-$ final state receives contributions from multiple\nhigher-mass $\\Lambda$ resonances. The narrowest and most prominent of these is\nthe $\\Lambda(1520)$, which has $J^P=\\frac32^-$. Here we present an ongoing\nlattice QCD calculation of the relevant $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda(1520)$ form\nfactors. We discuss the choice of interpolating field for the $\\Lambda(1520)$,\nand explain our method for extracting the fourteen $\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda(1520)$ helicity form factors from correlation functions that are\ncomputed in the $\\Lambda(1520)$ rest frame. We present preliminary numerical\nresults at a pion mass of 340 MeV and a lattice spacing of 0.11 fm. This\ncalculation uses a domain-wall action for the $u$, $d$, and $s$ quarks and a\nrelativistic heavy-quark action for the $b$ quark, and is based on gauge-field\nconfigurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations.\n", "  We study the cosmological evolution of a complex scalar field with a\nself-interaction potential $V(|\\varphi|^2)$, possibly describing\nself-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates, using a fully general relativistic\ntreatment. We generalize the hydrodynamic representation of the\nKlein-Gordon-Einstein equations in the weak field approximation developed in\nour previous paper. We establish the general equations governing the evolution\nof a spatially homogeneous complex scalar field in an expanding background. We\nshow how they can be simplified in the fast oscillation regime and derive the\nequation of state of the scalar field in parametric form for an arbitrary\npotential. We explicitly consider the case of a quartic potential with\nrepulsive or attractive self-interaction and determine the phase diagram of the\nscalar field. We show that the transition between the weakly self-interacting\nregime and the strongly self-interacting regime depends on how the scattering\nlength of the bosons compares with their effective Schwarzschild radius. We\nalso constrain the parameters of the scalar field from astrophysical and\ncosmological observations. Numerical applications are made for ultralight\nbosons without self-interaction (fuzzy dark matter), for bosons with repulsive\nself-interaction, and for bosons with attractive self-interaction (QCD axions\nand ultralight axions).\n", "  A decade of intense research on two-dimensional (2D) atomic crystals has\nrevealed that their properties can differ greatly from those of the parent\ncompound. These differences are governed by changes in the band structure due\nto quantum confinement and are most profound if the underlying lattice symmetry\nchanges. Here we report a high-quality 2D electron gas in few-layer InSe\nencapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride under an inert atmosphere. Carrier\nmobilities are found to exceed 1,000 and 10,000 cm2/Vs at room and\nliquid-helium temperatures, respectively, allowing the observation of the\nfully-developed quantum Hall effect. The conduction electrons occupy a single\n2D subband and have a small effective mass. Photoluminescence spectroscopy\nreveals that the bandgap increases by more than 0.5 eV with decreasing the\nthickness from bulk to bilayer InSe. The band-edge optical response vanishes in\nmonolayer InSe, which is attributed to monolayer's mirror-plane symmetry.\nEncapsulated 2D InSe expands the family of graphene-like semiconductors and, in\nterms of quality, is competitive with atomically-thin dichalcogenides and black\nphosphorus.\n", "  In this work, we reexamine the extension of the CDCC formalism to include\ntarget excitation and apply it to a variety of reactions to study the effect of\nbreakup on inelastic cross sections. We use a transformed oscillator basis to\ndiscretize the continuum of the projectiles in the different reactions and use\nthe extended CDCC method developed in this work to solve the resulting coupled\ndifferential equations. A new code has been developed to perform the\ncalculations. Reactions 58Ni(d, d) 58Ni*, 24Mg(d, d) 24Mg* , 144Sm( 6Li, 6Li)\n144Sm* and 9Be( 6Li, 6Li) 9Be* are studied. Satisfactory agreement is found\nbetween experimental data and extended CDCC calculations. The studied CDCC\nmethod is proved to be an accurate tool to describe target excitation in\nreactions with weakly-bound nuclei. Moderate effects of breakup on inelastic\nobservables are found for the reactions studied. Cross section magnitudes are\nnot modified much, but angular distributions present smoothing when opposed to\ncalculations without breakup.\n", "  We identify a pre-explosion counterpart to the nearby Type IIP supernova\nASASSN-16fq (SN 2016cok) in archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. The\nsource appears to be a blend of several stars that prevents obtaining accurate\nphotometry. However, with reasonable assumptions about the stellar temperature\nand extinction, the progenitor almost certainly had an initial mass M<17Msun,\nand was most likely in the mass range 8-12Msun. Observations once ASASSN-16fq\nhas faded will have no difficulty accurately determining the properties of the\nprogenitor. In 8 years of Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) data, no significant\nprogenitor variability is detected to RMS limits of roughly 0.03 mag. Of the\nsix nearby SN with constraints on low level variability, SN 1987A, SN 1993J, SN\n2008cn, SN 2011dh, SN 2013ej and ASASSN-16fq, only the slowly fading progenitor\nof SN 2011dh showed clear evidence of variability. Excluding SN 1987A, the 90%\nconfidence limit implied by these sources on the number of outbursts over the\nlast decade before the SN that last longer than 0.1 years (FWHM) and are\nbrighter than M_R<-8 mag is approximately N<3. Our continuing LBT monitoring\nprogram will steadily improve constraints on pre-SN progenitor variability at\namplitudes far lower than achievable by SN surveys.\n", "  Using a Monte Carlo random walks of a log-normal distribution, we show how to\nqualitatively study void properties for non-standard cosmologies. We apply this\nmethod to an f(R) modified gravity model and recover the N-body simulation\nresults of (Achitouv et al. 2016) for the void profiles and their deviation\nfrom GR. This method can potentially be extended to study other properties of\nthe large scale structures such as the abundance of voids or overdense\nenvironments. We also introduce a new way to identify voids in the cosmic web,\nusing only a few measurements of the density fluctuations around random\npositions. This algorithm allows to select voids with specific profiles and\nradii. As a consequence, we can target classes of voids with higher differences\nbetween f(R) and standard gravity void profiles. Finally we apply our void\ncriteria to galaxy mock catalogues and discuss how the flexibility of our void\nfinder can be used to reduce systematics errors when probing the growth rate in\nthe galaxy-void correlation function.\n", "  Similarly to how charged particles experience time-averaged ponderomotive\nforces in high-frequency fields, linear waves also experience time-averaged\nrefraction in modulated media. Here we propose a covariant variational theory\nof this \"ponderomotive effect on waves\" for a general nondissipative linear\nmedium. Using the Weyl calculus, our formulation accommodates waves with\ntemporal and spatial period comparable to that of the modulation (provided that\nparametric resonances are avoided). Our theory also shows that any wave is, in\nfact, a polarizable object that contributes to the linear dielectric tensor of\nthe ambient medium. The dynamics of quantum particles is subsumed as a special\ncase. As an illustration, ponderomotive Hamiltonians of quantum particles and\nphotons are calculated within a number of models. We also explain a fundamental\nconnection between these results and the commonly known expression for the\nelectrostatic dielectric tensor of quantum plasmas.\n", "  The canonical tensor model (CTM) is a rank-three tensor model formulated as a\ntotally constrained system in the canonical formalism. The constraint algebra\nof CTM has a similar structure as that of the ADM formalism of general\nrelativity, and is studied as a discretized model for quantum gravity. In this\npaper, we analyze the classical equation of motion (EOM) of CTM in a formal\ncontinuum limit through a derivative expansion of the tensor up to the forth\norder, and show that it is the same as the EOM of a coupled system of gravity\nand a scalar field derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an\nappropriate choice of an action. The action contains a scalar field potential\nof an exponential form, and the system classically respects a dilatational\nsymmetry. We find that the system has a critical dimension, given by six, over\nwhich it becomes unstable due to the wrong sign of the scalar kinetic term. In\nsix dimensions, de Sitter spacetime becomes a solution to the EOM, signaling\nthe emergence of a conformal symmetry, while the time evolution of the scale\nfactor is power-law in dimensions below six.\n", "  Quintessential dark energy with pressure $p$ and density $\\rho$ is related by\nequation of state $p=\\omega\\rho$ with the state parameter $-1<\\omega<-1/3$. The\ncosmological dark energy influence on black hole spacetime are interesting and\nimportant. In this paper, we study the Kerr-Newman-AdS solutions of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equation in quintessence field around a black hole by\nNewman-Janis algorithm and complex computations. From the horizon structure\nequation, we obtain the expression between quintessence parameter $\\alpha$ and\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ if the black hole exists two cosmological\nhorizon $r_{q}$ and $r_{c}$ when $\\omega=-2/3$, the result is different from\nrotational black hole in quintessence matter situation. Through analysis we\nfind that the black hole charge cannot change the value of $\\alpha$. But the\nblack hole spin and cosmological constant are opposite. The black hole spin and\ncosmological constant make the maximum value of $\\alpha$ to become small. The\nexistence of four horizon leads seven types of extremal black holes to\nconstraint the parameter $\\alpha$. With the state parameter $\\omega$ ranging\nfrom $-1$ to $-1/3$, the maximum value of $\\alpha$ changes from $\\Lambda$ to\n$1$. When $\\omega\\rightarrow -1$, the quintessential dark energy likes\ncosmological constant. The singularity of the black holes is the same with that\nof Kerr black hole. We also discuss the rotation velocity of the black holes on\nthe equatorial plane for $\\omega=-2/3,-1/2$ and $-1/3$. For small value of\n$\\alpha$, the rotation velocity on the equatorial plane is asymptotically flat\nand it can explain the rotation curves in spiral galaxies.\n", "  The properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and\npolarisation anisotropies measured by a static, off-centered observer located\nin a local spherically symmetric void, are described. In particular in this\npaper we compute, together with the standard 2- point angular correlation\nfunctions, the off-diagonal correlators, which are no more vanishing by\nsymmetry. While the energy shift induced by the off-centered position of the\nobserver can be suppressed by a proper choice of the observer velocity, a\nlensing-like effect on the CMB emission point remains. This latter effect is\ngenuinely geometrical (e.g. non-degenerate with a boost) and reflects in the\nstructure of the off-diagonal correlators. At lowest order in this effect, the\ntemperature and polarisation correlation matrices have non-vanishing diagonal\nelements, as usual, and all the off-diagonal terms are excited. This particular\nsignature of a local void model allows one, in principle, to disentangle\ngeometrical effects from local kinematical ones in CMB observations.\n", "  We performed X-ray diffraction and electrical resistivity measurement up to\npressures of 5 GPa and the first-principles calculations utilizing experimental\nstructural parameters to investigate the pressure-induced topological phase\ntransition in BiTeBr having a noncentrosymmetric layered structure (space group\nP3m1). The P3m1 structure remains stable up to pressures of 5 GPa; the ratio of\nlattice constants, c/a, has a minimum at pressures of 2.5 - 3 GPa. In the same\nrange, the temperature dependence of resistivity changes from metallic to\nsemiconducting at 3 GPa and has a plateau region between 50 and 150 K in the\nsemiconducting state. Meanwhile, the pressure variation of band structure shows\nthat the bulk band-gap energy closes at 2.9 GPa and re-opens at higher\npressures. Furthermore, according to the Wilson loop analysis, the topological\nnature of electronic states in noncentrosymmetric BiTeBr at 0 and 5 GPa are\nexplicitly revealed to be trivial and non-trivial, respectively. These results\nstrongly suggest that pressure-induced topological phase transition in BiTeBr\noccurs at the pressures of 2.9 GPa.\n", "  We present a self-contained engine, which is made of one or more two-level\nsystems, each of which is coupled to a single bath, as well as to a common load\ncomposed of a particle on a tilted lattice. We show that the energy and the\nentropy absorbed by the spins are transferred to the particle thus setting it\ninto upward motion at an average constant speed, even when driven by a single\nspin connected to a single bath. When considering an ensemble of different\nspins, the velocity of the particle is larger when the tilt is on resonance\nwith any of the spins' energy splitting. Interestingly, we find regimes where\nthe spins' polarization enters periodic cycles with the oscillation period\nbeing determined by the tilt of the lattice.\n", "  We introduce high-resolution solid-state imaging detectors for the search of\nneutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay. Based on the present literature, imaging\ndevices from amorphous $^{82}$Se evaporated on a complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel array could have the energy and\nspatial resolution to produce two-dimensional images of ionizing tracks of\nutmost quality, effectively akin to an electronic bubble chamber in the double\n$\\beta$ decay energy regime. Still to be experimentally demonstrated, a\ndetector consisting of a large array of these devices could have very low\nbackgrounds, possibly reaching $10^{-7}$/(kg y) in the neutrinoless decay\nregion of interest (ROI), as it may be required for the full exploration of the\nneutrinoless double $\\beta$ decay parameter space in the most unfavorable\ncondition of a strongly quenched nucleon axial coupling constant.\n", "  Accuracy of the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) depends on the node\nlocation of the best available trial state $\\Psi_T$. The practical FN-DMC\napproaches available for large systems rely on compact yet effective $\\Psi_T$s\ncontaining explicitly correlated single Slater determinant (SD). However, SD\nnodes may be better suited to one system than to another, which may possibly\nlead to inaccurate FN-DMC energy differences. It remains a challenge, how to\nestimate inequivalency or appropriateness of SDs. Here we use the differences\nof a measure based on Euclidean distance between the natural orbital occupation\nnumber (NOON) vector of the Slater determinant (SD) from the exact solution in\nthe NOON vector space, that can be viewed as a measure of SD inequivalency and\na measure of the expected degree of nondynamic-correlation-related bias in\nFN-DMC energy differences. This is explored on a set of small noncovalent\ncomplexes and covalent bond breaking of Si$_2$ vs. N$_2$. It turns out that\nNOON-based measures well reflect the magnitude and sign of the bias present in\nthe data available, thus providing new insights to the nature of bias\ncancellation in SD FN-DMC energy differences.\n", "  SPIRITS---SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey---is an ongoing survey\nof nearby galaxies searching for infrared (IR) transients with Spitzer/IRAC. We\npresent the discovery and follow-up observations of one of our most luminous\n($M_{[4.5]} = -17.1\\pm0.4$ mag, Vega) and red ($[3.6] - [4.5] = 3.0 \\pm 0.2$\nmag) transients, SPIRITS 15c. The transient was detected in a dusty spiral arm\nof IC 2163 ($D\\approx35.5$ Mpc). Pre-discovery ground-based imaging revealed an\nassociated, shorter-duration transient in the optical and near-IR (NIR). NIR\nspectroscopy showed a broad ($\\approx 8400$ km s$^{-1}$), double-peaked\nemission line of He I at $1.083 \\mu$m, indicating an explosive origin. The NIR\nspectrum of SPIRITS 15c is similar to that of the Type IIb SN 2011dh at a phase\nof $\\approx 200$ days. Assuming $A_V = 2.2$ mag of extinction in SPIRITS 15c\nprovides a good match between their optical light curves. The IR light curves\nand the extreme $[3.6]-[4.5]$ color cannot be explained using only a standard\nextinction law. Another luminous ($M_{4.5} = -16.1\\pm0.4$ mag) event, SPIRITS\n14buu, was serendipitously discovered in the same galaxy. The source displays\nan optical plateau lasting $\\gtrsim 80$ days, and we suggest a scenario similar\nto the low-luminosity Type IIP SN 2005cs obscured by $A_V \\approx 1.5$ mag.\nOther classes of IR-luminous transients can likely be ruled out in both cases.\nIf both events are indeed SNe, this may suggest $\\gtrsim 18\\%$ of nearby\ncore-collapse SNe are missed by currently operating optical surveys.\n", "  We investigate the intrinsic properties of a sample of bright (E_iso > 10^52\nerg) gamma-ray bursts, comparing those with and without radio afterglows. We\nfind that the sample of bursts with no radio afterglows has a significantly\nshorter mean intrinsic duration of the prompt gamma-ray radiation, and the\ndistribution of this duration is significantly different from those bursts with\na radio afterglow. Although the sample with no radio afterglow has on average\nlower isotropic energy, the lack of radio afterglow does not appear to be a\nresult of simply energetics of the burst, but a reflection of a separate\nphysical phenomenon likely related to the circumburst density profile. We also\nfind a weak correlation between the isotropic gamma-ray energy and intrinsic\nduration in the sample with no radio afterglow, but not in the sample which\nhave observed radio afterglows. We give possible explanations for why there may\nexist a sample of GRBs with no radio afterglow depending on whether the radio\nemission comes from the forward or reverse shock, and why these bursts appear\nto have intrinsically shorter prompt emission durations. We discuss how our\nresults may have implications for progenitor models of GRBs.\n", "  We present results on the variation of 7.7 micron Polycyclic Aromatic\nHydrocarbon (PAH) emission in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at\nz ~ 2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at\n1.37 < z < 2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer\nmetallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron and Herschel/PACS\n100 and 160 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron\nluminosities (L(7.7)) and total IR luminosities (L(IR)), respectively. We find\nsignificant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected\nSFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O32) emission-line ratio. The\nlatter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends\nindicate a paucity of PAH emission in low metallicity environments with harder\nand more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly\nlower in the youngest quartile of our sample (ages of 500 Myr) compared to\nolder galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB\nstars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of ~\n2 for galaxies with masses $M_* < 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, compared to the more\nmassive ones. We demonstrate that commonly-used conversions of L(7.7) (or 24\nmicron flux density; f(24)) to L(IR) underestimate the IR luminosity by more\nthan a factor of 2 at $M_*$ ~ $10^{9.6-10.0} M_{\\odot}$. We adopt a\nmass-dependent conversion of L(7.7) to L(IR) with L(7.7)/L(IR)= 0.09 and 0.22\nfor $M_* < 10^{10}$ and $> 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$, respectively. Based on the new\nscaling, the SFR-$M_*$ relation has a shallower slope than previously derived.\nOur results also suggest a higher IR luminosity density at z ~ 2 than\npreviously measured, corresponding to a ~ 30% increase in the SFR density.\n", "  Single top quark production is a powerful process to search for new physics\nsigns. In this work we propose and investigate a search for top quark flavor\nchanging neutral currents (FCNC) via a photon using direct single top quark\nproduction events in proton-proton collisions at the LHC at CERN. We show that\nthe direct single top quark final state can provide constraints on the\nstrengths of tq$\\gamma$ (top-quark-$\\gamma$) and tqg (top-quark-gluon) FCNC\ncouplings simultaneously. Results of a search for direct single top quark\nproduction at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV performed by the\nATLAS collaboration are used to set first experimental limits on the anomalous\nFCNC top decay branching fractions ${\\cal B}$(t$\\rightarrow$ u$\\gamma$) $<$\n0.05% and ${\\cal B}$(t$\\rightarrow$ c$\\gamma$) $<$ 0.14% via direct single top\nquark production. Finally, the sensitivity of the proposed channel for probing\nthe tq$\\gamma$ couplings at 13 TeV is presented.\n", "  The European Space Agency has invested heavily in two cornerstones missions;\nHerschel and Planck. The legacy data from these missions provides us with an\nunprecedented opportunity to study cosmic dust in galaxies so that we can\nanswer fundamental questions about, for example: the origin of the chemical\nelements, physical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), its effect on\nstellar radiation, its relation to star formation and how this relates to the\ncosmic far infrared background. In this paper we describe the DustPedia\nproject, which is enabling us to develop tools and computer models that will\nhelp us relate observed cosmic dust emission to its physical properties\n(chemical composition, size distribution, temperature), to its origins (evolved\nstars, super novae, growth in the ISM) and the processes that destroy it (high\nenergy collisions and shock heated gas). To carry out this research we will\ncombine the Herschel/Planck data with that from other sources of data,\nproviding observations at numerous wavelengths (< 41) across the spectral\nenergy distribution, thus creating the DustPedia database. To maximise our\nspatial resolution and sensitivity to cosmic dust we limit our analysis to 4231\nlocal galaxies (v < 3000 km/s) selected via their near infrared luminosity\n(stellar mass). To help us interpret the data we have developed a new physical\nmodel for dust (THEMIS), a new Bayesian method of fitting and interpreting\nspectral energy distributions (HerBIE) and a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo\nphoton tracing radiative transfer model (SKIRT). In this the first of the\nDustPedia papers we describe the project objectives, data sets used and provide\nan insight into the new scientific methods we plan to implement.\n", "  In the first paper of this series, we study the level population problem of\nrecombining carbon ions. We focus our study on high quantum numbers\nanticipating observations of Carbon Radio Recombination Lines to be carried out\nby the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). We solve the level population equation\nincluding angular momentum levels with updated collision rates up to high\nprincipal quantum numbers. We derive departure coefficients by solving the\nlevel population equation in the hydrogenic approximation and including low\ntemperature dielectronic recombination effects. Our results in the hydrogenic\napproximation agree well with those of previous works. When comparing our\nresults including dielectronic recombination we find differences which we\nascribe to updates in the atomic physics (e.g., collision rates) and to the\napproximate solution method of the statistical equilibrium equations adopted in\nprevious studies. A comparison with observations is discussed in an\naccompanying article, as radiative transfer effects need to be considered.\n", "  In the second paper of the series, we have modeled low frequency carbon radio\nrecombination lines (CRRL) from the interstellar medium. Anticipating the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) survey of Galactic CRRLs, we focus our study on the\nphysical conditions of the diffuse cold neutral medium (CNM). We have used the\nimproved departure coefficients computed in the first paper of the series to\ncalculate line-to-continuum ratios. The results show that the line width and\nintegrated optical depths of CRRL are sensitive probes of the electron density,\ngas temperature, and the emission measure of the cloud. Furthermore, the ratio\nof CRRL to the [CII] at 158 $\\mu$m line is a strong function of the temperature\nand density of diffuse clouds. Guided by our calculations, we analyze CRRL\nobservations and illustrate their use with data from the literature.\n", "  A limit for the edge density, ruled by radiation losses from light\nimpurities, is established by a minimal cylindrical magneto-thermal equilibrium\nmodel. For ohmic tokamak and reversed field pinch the limit scales linearly\nwith the plasma current, as the empirical Greenwald limit. The auxiliary\nheating adds a further dependence, scaling with the 0.4 power, in agreement\nwith L-mode tokamak experiments. For a purely externally heated configuration\nthe limit takes on a Sudo-like form, depending mainly on the input power, and\nis compatible with recent Stellarator scalings.\n", "  We study the dependence of the coronal activity index on the star's rotation\nrate. This question was considered earlier for 824 late-type stars on the basis\nof a consolidated catalogue of the soft X-ray fluxes. We carry out a more\nrefined analysis separately for G, K and M dwarfs. They distinctively exhibit\ntwo modes of activity. The first one is the saturation mode, it is\ncharacteristic of young stars and is practically not related to their rotation.\nThe second one refers to the solar-type activity the level of which strongly\ndepends on the rotation period. We show that the transition from one mode to\nanother takes place at the rotation periods of 1.1, 3.3 and 7.2 days for the\nstars of spectral types G2, K4 and M3 respectively. In the light of the\ndiscovery of superflares on G and K stars on the Kepler spacecraft there arises\na question of how these objects differ from other active late-type stars. We\nanalyse the location of superflare stars relative to the stars observed by\nKepler on the \"amplitude of rotational brightness modulation (ARM) -- rotation\nperiod\" diagram. The value of ARM reflects the relative spots area on a star\nand characterises the activity level in the whole atmosphere. It is shown that\nG and K superflare stars are basically fast rotating young objects, but some of\nthem belong to the stars with the solar type of activity.\n", "  Simulating quantum nonlocality and steering requires augmenting pre-shared\nrandomness with non-vanishing communication cost. This prompts the question of\nhow one may provide such an operational characterization for the quantumness of\ncorrelations due even to unentangled states. Here we show that for a certain\nclass of states, such quantumness can be pointed out by superlocality, the\nrequirement for a larger dimension of the pre-shared randomness to simulate the\ncorrelations than that of the quantum state that generates them. This provides\nan approach to define the nonclassicality of local multipartite correlations in\nconvex operational theories.\n", "  Superconductors containing magnetic impurities exhibit intriguing phenomena\nderived from the competition between Cooper pairing and Kondo screening. At the\nheart of this competition are the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (Shiba) states which arise\nfrom the pair breaking effects a magnetic impurity has on a superconducting\nhost. Hybrid superconductor-molecular junctions offer unique access to these\nstates but the added complexity in fabricating such devices has kept their\nexploration to a minimum. Here, we report on the successful integration of a\nmodel spin 1/2 impurity, in the form of a neutral and stable all organic\nradical molecule, in proximity-induced superconducting break-junctions. Our\nmeasurements reveal excitations which are characteristic of a spin-induced\nShiba state due to the radical's unpaired spin strongly coupled to a\nsuperconductor. By virtue of a variable molecule-electrode coupling, we access\nboth the singlet and doublet ground states of the hybrid system which give rise\nto the doublet and singlet Shiba excited states, respectively. Our results show\nthat Shiba states are a robust feature of the interaction between a\nparamagnetic impurity and a proximity-induced superconductor where the excited\nstate is mediated by correlated electron-hole (Andreev) pairs instead of Cooper\npairs.\n", "  We probe the higher-order clustering of the galaxies in the final data\nrelease (DR12) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey (BOSS) using the method of germ-grain Minkowski Functionals (MFs). Our\nsample consists of 410,615 BOSS galaxies from the northern Galactic cap in the\nredshift range 0.450--0.595. We show the MFs to be sensitive to contributions\nup to the six-point correlation function for this data set. We ensure with a\ncustom angular mask that the results are more independent of boundary effects\nthan in previous analyses of this type. We extract the higher-order part of the\nMFs and quantify the difference to the case without higher-order correlations.\nThe resulting $\\chi^{2}$ value of over 10,000 for a modest number of degrees of\nfreedom, O(200), indicates a 100-sigma deviation and demonstrates that we have\na highly significant signal of the non-Gaussian contributions to the galaxy\ndistribution. This statistical power can be useful in testing models with\ndiffering higher-order correlations. Comparing the galaxy data to the QPM and\nMultiDark-Patchy mocks, we find that the latter better describes the observed\nstructure. From an order-by-order decomposition we expect that, for example,\nalready a reduction of the amplitude of the MD-Patchy mock power spectrum by 5%\nwould remove the remaining tension.\n", "  We present a non-parametric model for inferring the three-dimensional (3D)\ndistribution of dust density in the Milky Way. Our approach uses the extinction\nmeasured towards stars at different locations in the Galaxy at approximately\nknown distances. Each extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated\ndust density along its line-of-sight. Making simple assumptions about the\nspatial correlation of the dust density, we can infer the most probable 3D\ndistribution of dust across the entire observed region, including along sight\nlines which were not observed. This is possible because our model employs a\nGaussian Process to connect all lines-of-sight. We demonstrate the capability\nof our model to capture detailed dust density variations using mock data as\nwell as simulated data from the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot. We then apply our\nmethod to a sample of giant stars observed by APOGEE and Kepler to construct a\n3D dust map over a small region of the Galaxy. Due to our smoothness constraint\nand its isotropy, we provide one of the first maps which does not show the\n\"fingers of god\" effect.\n", "  We demonstrate an efficient experimental procedure based on entanglement\nswapping to determine the Bell nonlocality measure of Horodecki et al. [Phys.\nLett. A 200, 340 (1995)] and the fully-entangled fraction of Bennett et al.\n[Phys. Rev. A 54, 3824 (1996)] of an arbitrary two-qubit polarization-encoded\nstate. The nonlocality measure corresponds to the amount of the violation of\nthe Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) optimized over all measurement settings.\nBy using simultaneously two copies of a given state, we measure directly only\nsix parameters. Our method requires neither full quantum state tomography of 15\nparameters nor continuous scanning of the measurement bases used by two parties\nin the usual CHSH inequality tests with four measurements in each optimization\nstep. We analyze how well the measured degrees of Bell nonlocality and other\nentanglement witnesses (including the fully-entangled fraction and a nonlinear\nentropic witness) of an arbitrary two-qubit state can estimate its\nentanglement. In particular, we measured these witnesses and estimated the\nnegativity of various two-qubit Werner states. Our approach could especially be\nuseful for quantum communication protocols based on entanglement swapping.\n", "  Elastic strain is potentially an important approach in tuning the properties\nof the improperly multiferroic hexagonal ferrites, the details of which have\nhowever been elusive due to the experimental difficulties. Employing the method\nof restrained thermal expansion, we have studied the effect of isothermal\nbiaxial strain in the basal plane of h-LuFeO3 (001) films. The results indicate\nthat a compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the ferrodistortion,\nand the effect is larger at higher temperatures. The compressive biaxial strain\nand the enhanced ferrodistortion together, cause an increase in the electric\npolarization and a reduction in the canting of the weak ferromagnetic moments\nin h-LuFeO3, according to our first principle calculations. These findings are\nimportant for understanding the strain effect as well as the coupling between\nthe lattice and the improper multiferroicity in h-LuFeO3. The experimental\nelucidation of the strain effect in h-LuFeO3 films also suggests that the\nrestrained thermal expansion can be a viable method to unravel the strain\neffect in many other epitaxial thin film materials.\n", "  We consider light scattering off a two-dimensional (2D) dipolar array and\nshow how it can be tailored by properly choosing the lattice constant of the\norder of the incident wavelength. In particular, we demonstrate that such\narrays can operate as nearly perfect mirrors for a wide range of incident\nangles and frequencies close to the individual atomic resonance. These results\ncan be understood in terms of the cooperative resonances of the surface modes\nsupported by the 2D array. Experimental realizations are discussed, using\nultracold arrays of trapped atoms and excitons in 2D semiconductor materials,\nas well as potential applications ranging from atomically thin metasurfaces to\nsingle photon nonlinear optics and nanomechanics.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of exceptional points of degeneracy (EPD) of\nperiodic eigenstates in non-Hermitian coupled chains of dipolar scatterers.\nGuided modes supported by these structures can exhibit an EPD in their\ndispersion diagram at which two or more Bloch eigenstates coalesce, in both\ntheir eigenvectors and eigenvalues. We show a second-order modal EPD associated\nwith the parity-time ($\\cal{PT}$) symmetry condition, at which each particle\npair in the double chain exhibits balanced gain and loss. Furthermore, we also\ndemonstrate a fourth-order EPD occurring at the band edge. Such degeneracy\ncondition was previously referred to as a degenerate band edge in lossless\nanisotropic photonic crystals. Here, we rigorously show it under the occurrence\nof gain and loss balance for a discrete guiding system. We identify a more\ngeneral regime of gain and loss balance showing that $\\cal{PT}$-symmetry is not\nnecessary to realize EPDs. Furthermore, we investigate the degree of detuning\nof the EPD when the geometrical symmetry or balanced condition is broken. These\nfindings open unprecedented avenues toward superior light localization and\ntransport with application to high-Q resonators utilized in sensors, filters,\nlow-threshold switching and lasing.\n", "  We constrain the origin of Fermi Bubbles using 2D hydrodynamical simulations\nof both star formation driven and black hole accretion driven wind models. We\ncompare our results with recent observations of OVIII to OVII line ratio within\nand near Fermi Bubbles. Our results suggest that independent of the driving\nmechanisms, a low luminosity ($\\mathcal{L} \\sim 0.7-1\\times 10^{41}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$) energy injection best reproduces the observed line ratio for which\nthe shock temperature is $\\approx 3\\times 10^6$ K. Assuming the Galactic halo\ntemperature to be $2\\times 10^6$K, we estimate the shock velocity to be $\\sim\n300$ km s$^{-1}$ for a weak shock. The corresponding estimated age of the Fermi\nbubbles is $\\sim 15-25$ Myr. Such an event can be produced either by a star\nformation rate of $\\sim 0.5$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at the Galactic centre or a\nvery low luminosity jet/accretion wind arising from the central black hole. Our\nanalysis rules out any activity that generates an average mechanical luminosity\n$\\gtrsim 10^{41}$ \\ergps as a possible origin of the Fermi Bubbles.\n", "  A common approach in semi-analytic modeling of galaxy formation is to\nconstruct Monte Carlo realizations of merger histories of dark matter halos\nwhose masses are sampled from a halo mass function. Both the mass function\nitself, and the merger rates used to construct merging histories are calibrated\nto N-body simulations. Typically, \"backsplash\" halos (those which were once\nsubhalos within a larger halo, but which have since moved outside of the halo)\nare counted in both the halo mass function, and in the merger rates (or,\nequivalently, progenitor mass functions). This leads to a double-counting of\nmass in Monte Carlo merger histories which will bias results relative to N-body\nresults. We measure halo mass functions and merger rates with this\ndouble-counting removed in a large, cosmological N-body simulation with\ncosmological parameters consistent with current constraints. Furthermore, we\naccount for the inherently noisy nature of N-body halo mass estimates when\nfitting functions to N-body data, and show that ignoring these errors leads to\na significant systematic bias given the precision statistics available from\nstate-of-the-art N-body cosmological simulations.\n", "  Although the formalism of Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2008) is extremely\nuseful to understand what shapes transmission spectra of exoplanets, it does\nnot include the effects of a sharp change in flux with altitude generally\nassociated with surfaces and optically thick clouds. Recent advances in\nunderstanding the effects of refraction in exoplanet transmission spectra have,\nhowever, demonstrated that even clear thick atmospheres have such a sharp\nchange in flux due to a refractive boundary. We derive a more widely applicable\nanalytical formalism by including first-order effects from all these \"surfaces\"\nto compute an exoplanet's effective radius, effective atmospheric thickness,\nand spectral modulation for an atmosphere with a constant scale height. We show\nthat the effective radius cannot be located below these \"surfaces\" and that our\nformalism matches Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2008)'s in the case of a clear\natmosphere. Our formalism explains why clouds and refraction reduce the\ncontrast of spectral features, and why refraction decreases the Rayleigh\nscattering slope as wavelength increases, but also shows that these are common\neffects of all \"surfaces\". We introduce the concept of a \"surface\" cross\nsection, the minimum mean cross section that can be observed, as an index to\ncharacterize the location of \"surfaces\" and provide a simple method to estimate\ntheir effects on the spectral modulation of homogeneous atmospheres. We finally\ndevise a numerical recipe that extends our formalism to atmospheres with a\nnon-constant scale height and arbitrary sources of opacity, a potentially\nnecessary step to interpret observations.\n", "  We consider gauged twistor spinors which are supersymmetry generators of\nsupersymmetric and superconformal field theories in curved backgrounds. We show\nthat the spinor bilinears of gauged twistor spinors satify the gauged conformal\nKilling-Yano equation. We prove that the symmetry operators of the gauged\ntwistor spinor equation can be constructed from ordinary conformal Killing-Yano\nforms in constant curvature backgrounds. This provides a way to obtain gauged\ntwistor spinors from ordinary twistor spinors.\n", "  We study spin-wave excitations in a circular ferromagnetic nanodot in\ndifferent inhomogeneous, topologically non-trivial magnetization states,\nspecifically, vortex and skyrmion states. Gradual change in the strength of the\nout-of-plane magnetic anisotropy and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange\ninteraction leads to continuous phase transitions between different stable\nmagnetic configurations and allows for mapping of dynamic spin modes in and\nbetween the vortex, Bloch-type skyrmion and N\\'eel-type skyrmion states. Our\nstudy elucidates the connections between gyrotropic modes, azimuthal spin waves\nand breathing modes in various stable magnetization states and helps to\nunderstand the rich spin excitation spectrum on the skyrmion background.\n", "  We study the possibility that massless particles, such as photons, are\nproduced by a gravitational wave. That such a process should occur is implied\nby tree-level, Feynman diagrams such as two gravitons turning into two photons\ni.e. $g + g \\rightarrow \\gamma + \\gamma$. Here we calculate the rate at which a\ngravitational wave creates a massless, scalar field. This is done by placing\nthe scalar field in the background of a plane gravitational wave and\ncalculating the 4-current of the scalar field. Even in the vacuum limit of the\nscalar field it has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (similar to what occurs\nin the Higgs mechanism) and a non-zero current. We associate this with the\nproduction of scalar field quanta by the gravitational field. This effect has\npotential consequences for the attenuation of gravitational waves since the\nmassless field is being produced at the expense of the gravitational field.\nThis is related to the time-dependent Schwinger effect, but with the electric\nfield replaced by the the gravitational wave background and the\nelectron/positron field quanta replaced by massless scalar \"photons\". Since the\nproduced scalar quanta are massless there is no exponential suppression as\noccurs in the Schwinger effect due to the electron mass.\n", "  Next-generation galaxy surveys will increasingly rely on the galaxy\nbispectrum to improve cosmological constraints, especially on primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. A key theoretical requirement that remains to be developed is\nthe analysis of general relativistic effects on the bispectrum, which arise\nfrom observing galaxies on the past lightcone, {as well as from relativistic\ncorrections to the dynamics}. {As an initial step towards a fully relativistic\nanalysis of the galaxy bispectrum, we compute for the first time the local\nrelativistic lightcone effects on the bispectrum,} which come from Doppler and\ngravitational potential contributions. For the galaxy bispectrum, the problem\nis much more complex than for the power spectrum, since we need the lightcone\ncorrections at second order. Mode-coupling contributions at second order mean\nthat relativistic corrections can be non-negligible at smaller scales than in\nthe case of the power spectrum. In a primordial Gaussian universe, we show that\nthe local lightcone corrections for squeezed shapes at $z\\sim1$ mean that the\nbispectrum can differ from the Newtonian prediction by $\\gtrsim 10\\%$ when the\nshort modes are $k\\lesssim (50\\,{\\rm Mpc})^{-1}$. These relativistic projection\neffects, if ignored in the analysis of observations, could be mistaken for\nprimordial non-Gaussianity. For upcoming surveys which probe equality scales\nand beyond, {all relativistic lightcone effects and relativistic dynamical\ncorrections should be included} for an accurate measurement of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity.\n", "  In disordered systems, the hopping conductivity regime is usually realized at\nlow temperatures where spin-related phenomena differ strongly from the case of\ndelocalized carriers. We develop the unified microscopic theory of current\ninduced spin orientation, spin-galvanic and spin-Hall effects for the\ntwo-dimensional hopping regime. We show that the corresponding susceptibilities\nare proportional to each other and determined by the interplay between the\ndrift and the diffusion spin currents. Estimations are made for realistic\nsemiconductor heterostructures using the percolation theory. We show that the\nelectrical spin polarization in the hopping regime increases exponentially with\nincrease of the concentration of localization sites and may reach a few\npercents at the crossover from the hopping to the diffusion conductivity\nregime.\n", "  We present radio observations of the tidal disruption event candidate (TDE)\nXMMSL1 J0740$-$85 spanning 592 to 875 d post X-ray discovery. We detect radio\nemission that fades from an initial peak flux density at 1.6 GHz of $1.19\\pm\n0.06$ mJy to $0.65\\pm 0.06$ mJy suggesting an association with the TDE. This\nmakes XMMSL1 J0740$-$85 at $d=75$ Mpc the nearest TDE with detected radio\nemission to date and only the fifth TDE with radio emission overall. The\nobserved radio luminosity rules out a powerful relativistic jet like that seen\nin the relativistic TDE Swift J1644+57. Instead we infer from an equipartition\nanalysis that the radio emission most likely arises from a non-relativistic\noutflow similar to that seen in the nearby TDE ASASSN-14li, with a velocity of\nabout $10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ and a kinetic energy of about $10^{48}$ erg, expanding\ninto a medium with a density of about $10^2$ cm$^{-3}$. Alternatively, the\nradio emission could arise from a weak initially-relativistic but decelerated\njet with an energy of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{50}$ erg, or (for an extreme disruption\ngeometry) from the unbound debris. The radio data for XMMSL1 J0740$-$85\ncontinues to support the previous suggestion of a bimodal distribution of\ncommon non-relativistic isotropic outflows and rare relativistic jets in TDEs\n(in analogy with the relation between Type Ib/c supernovae and long-duration\ngamma-ray bursts). The radio data also provide a new measurement of the\ncircumnuclear density on a sub-parsec scale around an extragalactic\nsupermassive black hole.\n", "  Entanglement witnesses are invaluable for efficient quantum entanglement\ncertification without the need for expensive quantum state tomography. Yet,\nstandard entanglement witnessing requires multiple measurements and its bounds\ncan be elusive as a result of experimental imperfections. Here we introduce and\ndemonstrate a novel procedure for entanglement detection which seamlessly and\neasily improves any standard witnessing procedure by using additional available\ninformation to tighten the witnessing bounds. Moreover, by relaxing the\nrequirements on the witness operators, our method removes the general need for\nthe difficult task of witness decomposition into local observables. We\nexperimentally demonstrate entanglement detection with our approach using a\nseparable test operator and a simple fixed measurement-device for each agent.\nFinally we show that the method can be generalized to higher-dimensional and\nmultipartite cases with a complexity that scales linearly with the number of\nparties.\n", "  We develop a general method for the self consistent calculation of the\nhydrodynamics of an astrophysical object irradiated by a radiation field with\nan arbitrary strength and spectral energy distribution (SED). Using the XSTAR\nphotoionization code, we calculate heating and cooling rates as a function of\ngas photoionization parameter and temperature for several examples of SEDs:\nbremsstrahlung, blackbody, hard and soft state XRBs, Type 1 and Type 2 AGN. As\nan application of our method we study the hydrodynamics of 1-dimensional\nspherical winds heated by a uniform radiation field using the code Athena++. We\nfind that in all cases explored a wind settles into a transonic, steady state.\nThe wind evolves along the radiative heating equilibrium curve until adiabatic\ncooling effects become important and the flow departs from radiative\nequilibrium. If the flow is heated very rapidly, for example as in a thermally\nunstable regime, the corresponding column density of gas is low. Perhaps one of\nthe most intriguing results of our work is the two stage acceleration of the\nwind that happens when there are two thermally unstable regions and the flux is\nrelatively high. The efficiency with which the radiation field transfers energy\nto the wind is dependent on the SED of the external source, particularly the\nrelative flux of soft X-rays. These results suggest that detailed\nphotoionization calculations are essential not only to predict spectra but also\nto properly capture the flow dynamics.\n", "  Shear-induced turbulence could play a significant role in mixing momentum and\nchemical species in stellar radiation zones, as discussed by Zahn (1974). In\nthis paper we analyze the results of direct numerical simulations of stratified\nplane Couette flows, in the limit of rapid thermal diffusion, to measure the\nturbulent diffusivity and turbulent viscosity as a function of the local shear\nand the local stratification. We find that the stability criterion proposed by\nZahn (1974), namely that the product of the gradient Richardson number and the\nPrandtl number must be smaller than a critical values $(J\\Pr)_c$ for\ninstability, adequately accounts for the transition to turbulence in the flow,\nwith $(J\\Pr)_c \\simeq 0.007$. This result recovers and confirms the prior\nfindings of Prat et al. (2016). Zahn's model for the turbulent diffusivity and\nviscosity (Zahn 1992), namely that the mixing coefficient should be\nproportional to the ratio of the thermal diffusivity to the gradient Richardson\nnumber, does not satisfactorily match our numerical data when applied as is. It\nfails (as expected) in the limit of large stratification where the Richardson\nnumber exceeds the aforementioned threshold for instability, but it also fails\nin the limit of low stratification where the turbulent eddy scale becomes\nlimited by the computational domain size. We propose a revised model for\nturbulent mixing by diffusive stratified shear instabilities, that now properly\naccounts for both limits, fits our data satisfactorily, and recovers Zahn's\n1992 model in the limit of large Reynolds numbers.\n", "  Exploiting the data of the Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS), we\ncharacterize the spatial distribution of star formation in 76 high star forming\ngalaxies in 10 clusters at 0.3< z <0.7. All these galaxies are likely\nrestricted to first infall. In a companion paper we contrast the properties of\nfield and cluster galaxies, whereas here we correlate the properties of\nH{\\alpha} emitters to a number of tracers of the cluster environment to\ninvestigate its role in driving galaxy transformations. H{\\alpha} emitters are\nfound in the clusters out to 0.5 virial radii, the maximum radius covered by\nGLASS. The peak of the H{\\alpha} emission is offset with respect to the peak of\nthe UV-continuum. We decompose this offsets into a radial and tangential\ncomponent. The radial compo- nent points away from the cluster center in 60% of\nthe cases, with 95% confidence. The decompositions agree with cosmological\nsimulations, i.e. the H{\\alpha} emission offset correlates with galaxy velocity\nand ram-pressure stripping signatures. Trends between H{\\alpha} emitter\nproperties and surface mass density distributions and X-ray emissions emerge\nonly for unrelaxed clusters. The lack of strong correlations with the global\nenvironment does not allow us to identify a unique environmental effect\noriginating from the cluster center. In contrast, correla- tions between\nH{\\alpha} morphology and local number density emerge. We conclude that local\neffects, uncorrelated to the cluster-centric radius, play a more important role\nin shaping galaxy properties.\n", "  Efficient manipulation of light with sound in subwavelength-sized volumes is\nimportant for applications in photonics, phononics and biophysics, but remains\nelusive. We theoretically demonstrate the control of light with MHz-range\nultrasound in a subwavelength, 300 nm wide water-filled hole with a 100 nm\nradius air bubble. Ultrasound-driven pulsations of the bubble modulate the\neffective refractive index of the hole aperture, which gives rise to spectral\ntuning of light transmission through the hole. This control mechanism opens up\nnovel opportunities for tuneable acousto-optic and optomechanical\nmetamaterials, and all-optical ultrasound transduction.\n", "  Black holes (BHs) are believed to be a key ingredient of galaxy formation.\nHowever, the galaxy-BH interplay is challenging to study due to the large\ndynamical range and complex physics involved. As a consequence, hydrodynamical\ncosmological simulations normally adopt sub-grid models to track the unresolved\nphysical processes, in particular BH accretion; usually the spatial scale where\nthe BH dominates the hydrodynamical processes (the Bondi radius) is unresolved,\nand an approximate Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate is used to estimate the growth of\nthe BH. By comparing hydrodynamical simulations at different resolutions (300,\n30, 3 pc) using a Bondi-Hoyle approximation to sub-parsec runs with\nnon-parameterized accretion, our aim is to probe how well an approximated Bondi\naccretion is able to capture the BH accretion physics and the subsequent\nfeedback on the galaxy. We analyse an isolated galaxy simulation that includes\ncooling, star formation, Type Ia and Type II supernovae, BH accretion and AGN\nfeedback (radiation pressure, Compton heating/cooling) where mass, momentum,\nand energy are deposited in the interstellar medium through conical winds. We\nfind that on average the approximated Bondi formalism can lead to both over-\nand under-estimations of the BH growth, depending on resolution and on how the\nvariables entering into the Bondi-Hoyle formalism are calculated.\n", "  We numerically investigate spherically symmetric collapses in the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation with attractive nonlinearity in a harmonic potential.\nEven below threshold for direct collapse, the wave function bounces off from\nthe origin and may eventually become singular after a number of oscilla- tions\nin the trapping potential. This is reminiscent of the evolution of Einstein\ngravity sourced by a scalar field in Anti-de Sitter space where collapse\ncorresponds to black hole formation. We carefully examine the long time\nevolution of the wave function for continuous families of initial states in\norder to sharpen out this qualitative coincidence which may bring new insights\nin both directions. On one hand, we comment on possible implications for the\nso-called Bosenova collapses in cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates. On the\nother hand, Gross-Pitaevskii provides a toy model to study the relevance of\neither the resonance conditions or the nonlinearity for the problem of Anti-de\nSitter instability.\n", "  If quarks and gluons are either gapped or confined in neutron stars (NSs),\nthe most relevant light modes are Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes. We study NG modes\nwithin a schematic quark model whose parameters at high density are constrained\nby the two-solar mass constraint. Our model has the color-flavor-locked phase\nat high density, with the effective couplings as strong as in hadron physics.\nWe find that strong coupling effects make NG modes more massive than in weak\ncoupling predictions, and would erase several phenomena caused by the stressed\npairings in mismatched Fermi surfaces. For instance, we found that charged\nkaons, which are dominated by diquark and anti-diquark components, are not\nlight enough to condense at strong coupling. Implications for gravitational\nwave signals for NS-NS mergers are also briefly discussed.\n", "  Passive scalar mixing (metals, molecules, etc.) in the turbulent interstellar\nmedium (ISM) is critical for abundance patterns of stars and clusters, galaxy\nand star formation, and cooling from the circumgalactic medium. However, the\nfundamental scaling laws remain poorly understood in the highly supersonic,\nmagnetized, shearing regime relevant for the ISM. We therefore study the full\nscaling laws governing passive-scalar transport in idealized simulations of\nsupersonic turbulence. Using simple phenomenological arguments for the\nvariation of diffusivity with scale based on Richardson diffusion, we propose a\nsimple fractional diffusion equation to describe the turbulent advection of an\ninitial passive scalar distribution. These predictions agree well with the\nmeasurements from simulations, and vary with turbulent Mach number in the\nexpected manner, remaining valid even in the presence of a large-scale shear\nflow (e.g. rotation in a galactic disk). The evolution of the scalar\ndistribution is not the same as obtained using simple, constant \"effective\ndiffusivity\" as in Smagorinsky models, because the scale-dependence of\nturbulent transport means an initially Gaussian distribution quickly develops\nhighly non-Gaussian tails. We also emphasize that these are mean scalings that\nonly apply to ensemble behaviors (assuming many different, random scalar\ninjection sites): individual Lagrangian \"patches\" remain coherent\n(poorly-mixed) and simply advect for a large number of turbulent flow-crossing\ntimes.\n", "  Violation of $CP$ invariance is a quite relevant phenomenon that is found in\nthe Standard Model (SM), though in small amounts. This has been an incentive to\nlook for high-energy descriptions in which $CP$ violation is increased, thus\nenhancing effects that are suppressed in the SM, such as the electric dipole\nmoments (EDMs) of elementary particles. In the present investigation, we point\nout that charged currents in which axial couplings are different from vector\ncouplings are able to produce one-loop contributions to EDMs of charged leptons\nif neutrinos are massive and if these currents violate $CP$. We develop our\ndiscussion around charged currents involving heavy neutrinos and a $W'$ gauge\nboson coupling to SM charged leptons. Using the most stringent bound on the\nelectron EDM, provided by the ACME Collaboration, we determine that the upper\nbound on the difference between axial and vector currents lies within\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ and $\\sim10^{-7}$ for heavy-neutrino masses between $0.5\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and $6\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and if the $W'$ mass is within $0.45\\,{\\rm\nTeV}-7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. This possibility is analyzed altogether with the anomalous\nmagnetic moments of charged leptons, among which we estimate, for the $\\tau$\nlepton, an anomalous magnetic moment contribution between $\\sim10^{-8}$ and\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ for neutrino masses ranging from $0.5\\,{\\rm TeV}$ to $6\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and a $W'$ mass between $0.45\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and $7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. The general\ncharged currents are also used to calculate the branching ratio for $\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma$, which gets suppressed if the set of masses of heavy neutrinos is\nquasidegenerate. In a scenario of nondegenerate neutrino masses, we find that\nregions of neutrino and $W'$ masses in which the contributions to this flavor\nchanging branching ratio are lower than the current upper bound exist. We show\nthat such regions can be widened if the $W'$ gauge boson mass is larger.\n", "  In recent years, a revised set of solar abundances has led to a discrepancy\nin the sound-speed profile between helioseismology and theoretical solar\nmodels. Conventional solutions require additional mechanisms for energy\ntransport within the Sun. Vincent et al. have recently suggested that dark\nmatter with a momentum or velocity dependent cross section could provide a\nsolution. In this work, we consider three models of dark matter with such cross\nsections and their effect on the stellar structure. In particular, the three\nmodels incorporate dark matter particles interacting through an electromagnetic\ndipole moment: an electric dipole, a magnetic dipole or an anapole. Each model\nis implemented in the \\texttt{DarkStec} stellar evolution program, which\nincorporates the effects of dark matter capture and heat transport within the\nsolar interior. We show that dark matter with an anapole moment of\n$\\sim1\\mathrm{GeV}^{-2}$ or magnetic dipole moment of $\\sim10^{-3}\\mu_p$ can\nimprove the sound-speed profile, small frequency separations and convective\nzone radius with respect to the Standard Solar Model. However, the required\ndipole moments are strongly excluded by direct detection experiments.\n", "  We argue that a particle language provides a conceptually simple framework\nfor the description of anomalous equilibration in isolated quantum systems. We\naddress this paradigm in the context of integrable models, which are those with\nparticles that are stable against decay. In particular, we demonstrate that a\ncomplete description of equilibrium ensembles for interacting integrable models\nrequires a formulation built from the mode occupation numbers of the underlying\nparticle content, mirroring the case of non-interacting particles. This yields\nan intuitive physical interpretation of generalized Gibbs ensembles, and\nreconciles them with the microcanonical ensemble. We explain how previous\nattempts to identify an appropriate ensemble overlooked an essential piece of\ninformation, and provide explicit examples in the context of quantum quenches.\n", "  A U(1) gauge theory turns, on physically motivated models of Quantum\nSpacetime, into a U($\\infty$) gauge theory, hence free classical\nelectrodynamics is no longer free and neutral fields may have electromagnetic\ninteractions. We discuss the last point for scalar fields, possibly describing\ndark matter; we have in mind the gravitational collapse of binary systems or\nfuture applications to self gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates as possible\nsources of evidence of quantum gravitational phenomena. The effects so far\nconsidered, however, seem too faint to be detectable at present.\n", "  Understanding and modeling the dynamics of pedestrian crowds can help with\ndesigning and increasing the safety of civil facilities. A key feature of\ncrowds is its intrinsic stochasticity, appearing even under very diluted\nconditions, due to the variability in individual behaviours. Individual\nstochasticity becomes even more important under densely crowded conditions,\nsince it can be nonlinearly magnified and may lead to potentially dangerous\ncollective behaviours. To understand quantitatively crowd stochasticity, we\nstudy the real-life dynamics of a large ensemble of pedestrians walking\nundisturbed, and we perform a statistical analysis of the fully-resolved\npedestrian trajectories obtained by a year-long high-resolution measurement\ncampaign. Our measurements have been carried out in a corridor of the Eindhoven\nUniversity of Technology via a combination of Microsoft Kinect 3D-range sensor\nand automatic head-tracking algorithms. The temporal homogeneity of our large\ndatabase of trajectories allows us to robustly define and separate average\nwalking behaviours from fluctuations parallel and orthogonal with respect to\nthe average walking path. Fluctuations include rare events when individuals\nsuddenly change their minds and invert their walking direction. Such tendency\nto invert direction has been poorly studied so far even if it may have\nimportant implications on the functioning and safety of facilities. We propose\na novel model for the dynamics of undisturbed pedestrians, based on stochastic\ndifferential equations, that provides a good agreement with our experimental\nobservations, including the occurrence of rare events.\n", "  We show that current fluctuations in a stochastic pump can be robustly mapped\nto fluctuations in a corresponding time-independent nonequilibrium steady\nstate. We thus refine a recently proposed mapping so that it ensures\nequivalence of not only the averages, but also optimal representation of\nfluctuations in currents and density. Our mapping leads to a natural\ndecomposition of the entropy production in stochastic pumps similar to the\n\"housekeeping\" heat. As a consequence of the decomposition of entropy\nproduction, the current fluctuations in weakly perturbed stochastic pumps are\nshown to satisfy a universal bound determined by the steady state entropy\nproduction.\n", "  Depinning and nonequilibrium transitions within sliding states in systems\ndriven over quenched disorder arise across a wide spectrum of size scales\nranging from atomic friction at the nanoscale, flux motion in type-II\nsuperconductors at the mesoscale, colloidal motion in disordered media at the\nmicroscale, and plate tectonics at geological length scales. Here we show that\nactive matter or self-propelled particles interacting with quenched disorder\nunder an external drive represents a new class of system that can also exhibit\npinning-depinning phenomena, plastic flow phases, and nonequilibrium sliding\ntransitions that are correlated with distinct morphologies and velocity-force\ncurve signatures. When interactions with the substrate are strong, a\nhomogeneous pinned liquid phase forms that depins plastically into a uniform\ndisordered phase and then dynamically transitions first into a moving stripe\ncoexisting with a pinned liquid and then into a moving phase separated state at\nhigher drives. We numerically map the resulting dynamical phase diagrams as a\nfunction of external drive, substrate interaction strength, and self-propulsion\ncorrelation length. These phases can be observed for active matter moving\nthrough random disorder. Our results indicate that intrinsically nonequilibrium\nsystems can exhibit additional nonequilibrium transitions when subjected to an\nexternal drive.\n", "  We propose a powerful approach to solve Laplace's equation for point sources\nnear a spherical object. The central new idea is to use prolate spheroidal\nsolid harmonics, which are separable solutions of Laplace's equation in\nspheroidal coordinates, instead of the more natural spherical solid harmonics.\nWe motivate this choice and show that the resulting series expansions converge\nmuch faster. This improvement is discussed in terms of the singularity of the\nsolution and its analytic continuation. The benefits of this approach are\nillustrated for a specific example: the calculation of modified decay rates of\nlight emitters close to nanostructures in the long-wavelength approximation. We\nexpect the general approach to be applicable with similar benefits to a variety\nof other contexts, from other geometries to other equations of mathematical\nphysics.\n", "  We present some novel equilibrium shapes of a clamped Euler beam (Elastica\nfrom now on) under uniformly distributed dead load orthogonal to the straight\nreference configuration. We characterize the properties of the minimizers of\ntotal energy, determine the corresponding Euler-Lagrange conditions and prove,\nby means of direct methods of calculus of variations, the existence of curled\nlocal minimizers. Moreover, we prove some sufficient conditions for stability\nand instability of particular solutions of the Euler-Lagrange conditions that\ncan be applied to numerically found curled shapes.\n", "  We develop a dynamic field-theoretic renormalization-group (RG) theory for\nthe cooling first-order phase transitions in the Potts model. It is suggested\nthat the well-known imaginary fixed points of the $q$-state Potts model for\n$q>10/3$ in the RG theory are the origin of the dynamic scaling found recently,\napart from the logarithmic corrections. This indicates that the real and\nimaginary fixed points of the Potts model are both physical and control the\nscalings of the continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, respectively,\nof the model. Our one-loop results for the scaling exponents are already not\nfar away from the numerical results. Further, the scaling exponents depend on\n$q$ slightly only, in consistence with the numerical results. Therefore, the\ntheory is believed to provide a natural explanation of the dynamic scaling\nincluding the scaling exponents and their scaling laws for various observables\nin the Potts model.\n", "  We present results of the spectral and timing analysis of the X-ray pulsar\nLMC X-4 with the NuSTAR observatory in the broad energy range 3-79 keV. Along\nwith the detailed analysis of the averaged source spectrum, the high-precision\npulse phased-resolved spectra were obtained for the first time. It has been\nshown that the comptonization model gives the best approximation of the\nobtained spectra. The evolution of its parameters was traced depending on the\npulse phase as well. The search for the possible cyclotron absorption line was\nperformed for all energy spectra in the 5-55 keV energy range. The obtained\nupper limit for the depth of the cyclotron absorption line $\\tau\\simeq0.15$\n($3\\sigma$) indicates no cyclotron absorption line in this energy range, which\nprovides an estimate of the magnitude of the magnetic field on the surface of\nthe neutron star: $B < 3 \\times 10^{11}$ G or $B > 6.5 \\times 10^{12}$ G. The\nlatter one is agree with the estimate of the magnetic field obtained from the\nanalysis of the power spectrum of the pulsar: $B \\sim 3 \\times 10^{13}$ G.\nBased on results of the pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy we revealed a delay\nbetween maxima of the source emission and the equivalent width of the\nfluorescent iron line. This delay can be apparently associated with the travel\ntime of photons between the emitting regions in the vicinity of the neutron\nstar and the relatively cold regions where this emission is reflected\n(presumably, at the inflowing stream or at the place of an interaction of the\nstream and the outer edge of the accretion disk).\n", "  During the scanning observations of the Galactic Center region in August -\nSeptember 2016 we detected the new outburst of the historical X-ray nova GRS\n1739-278, the black hole candidate LMXB system. In this letter we present\nresults of INTEGRAL and Swift-XRT observations taken during the outburst. In\nhard X-ray band (20-60 keV) the flux from the source raised from $\\sim$11 to\n$\\sim$30 mCrab between 3 and 14 of September. For nearly 8 days the source has\nbeen observed at this flux level and then faded to $\\sim$15 mCrab. The\nbroadband quasi-simultaneous spectrum obtained during the outburst is well\ndescribed by the absorbed powerlaw with the photon index $\\Gamma=1.86\\pm0.07$\nin broad energy range 0.5-150 keV, with absorption corresponding to\n${N_{H}}=2.3\\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ assuming solar abundance. Based on this we\ncan conclude that the source was in the low/hard state. From the lightcurve and\nspectra we propose that this outburst was `failed', i.e. amount of accreted\nmatter was not sufficient to achieve the high/soft spectral state with dominant\nsoft blackbody component as seen in normal outbursts of black hole candidates.\n", "  The Fano factor stability diagram of a C$_{3v}$ symmetric triangular quantum\ndot is analysed for increasing electron fillings $N$. At low filling,\nconventional Poissonian and sub-Poissonian behavior is found. At larger\nfilling, $N\\ge 2$, a breaking of the electron-hole symmetry is manifested in\nsuper-Poissonian noise with a peculiar bias voltage dependence of the Fano\nfactor at Coulomb and interference blockade. An analysis of the Fano map\nunravels a nontrivial electron bunching mechanism arising from the presence of\ndegenerate many-body states combined with orbital interference and Coulomb\ninteractions. An expression for the associated dark states is provided for\ngeneric $N$.\n", "  In scenarios where the dark matter interacts differently with protons and\nneutrons (isospin-violating dark matter), the interpretation of the\nexperimental limits on the dark matter spin-independent cross section may be\nsignificantly modified. On the one hand, the direct detection constraints are\nshifted depending on the target nucleus, possibly changing the hierarchy among\ndifferent experiments. On the other hand, the relative strength between the\nbounds from neutrino detectors and those from direct detection experiments is\naltered, allowing the former to be more competitive. In this paper, the status\nof isospin-violating dark matter is assessed in the light of recent data, and\nthe prospects for its detection in the near future are analyzed. We find, for\nexample, that there are regions in the parameter space where IceCube currently\nprovides the most stringent limits on the spin-independent cross section, or\nothers where the expected sensitivity of DEAP-3600 is well above the LUX\nexclusion limit. Our results highlight the complementarity among different\ntargets in direct detection experiments, and between direct detection and\nneutrino searches in the quest for a dark matter signal.\n", "  We present scattered light images of the TW Hya disk performed with SPHERE in\nPDI mode at 0.63, 0.79, 1.24 and 1.62 micron. We also present H2/H3-band ADI\nobservations. Three distinct radial depressions in the polarized intensity\ndistribution are seen, around 85, 21, and 6~au. The overall intensity\ndistribution has a high degree of azimuthal symmetry; the disk is somewhat\nbrighter than average towards the South and darker towards the North-West. The\nADI observations yielded no signifiant detection of point sources in the disk.\n  Our observations have a linear spatial resolution of 1 to 2au, similar to\nthat of recent ALMA dust continuum observations. The sub-micron sized dust\ngrains that dominate the light scattering in the disk surface are strongly\ncoupled to the gas. We created a radiative transfer disk model with\nself-consistent temperature and vertical structure iteration and including\ngrain size-dependent dust settling. This method may provide independent\nconstraints on the gas distribution at higher spatial resolution than is\nfeasible with ALMA gas line observations.\n  We find that the gas surface density in the \"gaps\" is reduced by 50% to 80%\nrelative to an unperturbed model. Should embedded planets be responsible for\ncarving the gaps then their masses are at most a few 10 Mearth. The observed\ngaps are wider, with shallower flanks, than expected for planet-disk\ninteraction with such low-mass planets. If forming planetary bodies have\nundergone collapse and are in the \"detachted phase\" then they may be directly\nobservable with future facilities such as METIS at the E-ELT.\n", "  Atmospheric magnetic fields in stars with convective envelopes heat stellar\nchromospheres. Starting with the historical Mount Wilson monitoring program,\nCaH&K lines have been widely used to trace stellar magnetic activity, and as a\nproxy for rotation period and consequently for stellar age. Monitoring stellar\nactivity has also become essential in filtering out false-positives due to\nmagnetic activity in extra-solar planet surveys. The Ca H&Kemission is\ntraditionally quantified through the R'HK-index, which compares the\nchromospheric flux in the doublet to the overall bolometric flux of the star.\nMuch work has been done to characterize this index for FGK-dwarfs, but M-dwarfs\nwere left out of these analyses and no calibration of their Ca ii H&K emission\nto an R'HK exists to date. We set out to characterize the magnetic activity of\nthe low and very low-mass stars by providing a calibration of the R'HK-index\nthat extends to the realm of M-dwarfs, and by evaluating the relation between\nR'HK and the rotation period. We calibrated the bolometric and photospheric\nfactors for M-dwarfs to properly transform the S-index into the R'HK. We\nmonitored magnetic activity through the Ca ii H&K emission lines in the HARPS\nM-dwarf sample. The R'HK index, like the fractional X-ray luminosity L_X/Lbol,\nshows a saturated correlation with rotation, with saturation setting in around\na ten days rotation period. Above that period, slower rotators show weaker Ca\nii activity, as expected. Under that period, the R'HK index saturates to\n~10^-4. Stellar mass modulates the Ca ii activity, with R'HK showing a constant\nbasal activity above 0.6Msun and then decreasing with mass between 0.6Msun and\nthe fully-convective limit of 0.35Msun. Short-term variability of the activity\ncorrelates with its mean level, stars with higher R'HK index show larger R'HK\nvariability, as previously observed for earlier spectral types.\n", "  Broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) are peculiar stellar explosions\nthat distinguish themselves from ordinary SNe. Some SNe Ic-BL are associated\nwith long-duration (\\gtrsim 2 s) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Black holes and\nmagnetars are two types of compact objects that are hypothesized to be central\nengines of GRBs. In spite of decades of investigations, no direct evidence for\nthe formation of black holes or magnetars has been found for GRBs so far. Here\nwe report the finding that the early peak (t \\lesssim 50 days) and late-time (t\n\\gtrsim 300 days) slow decay displayed in the light curves of both SNe 1998bw\n(associated with GRB 980425) and 2002ap (not GRB-associated) can be attributed\nto magnetar spin-down with initial rotation period P0 \\sim 20 ms, while the\nintermediate-time (50 \\lesssim t \\lesssim 300 days) linear decline is caused by\nradioactive decay of 56Ni. The connection between the early peak and late-time\nslow decline in the light curves is unexpected in alternative models. We thus\nsuggest that GRB 980425 and SN 2002ap were powered by magnetars.\n", "  We study a quasispin-$1/2$ Bose-Einstein condensate with synthetically\ngenerated spin-orbit coupling in a toroidal trap, and show that the system has\na rich variety of ground and metastable states. As the central hole region\nincreases, i.e., the potential changes from harmonic-like to ring-like, the\ncondensate exhibits a variety of structures, such as triangular stripes,\nflower-petal patterns, and counter-circling states. We also show that the\nrotating systems have exotic vortex configurations. In the limit of a quasi-one\ndimensional ring, the quantum many-body ground state is obtained, which is\nfound to be the fragmented condensate.\n", "  We study the surface Andreev bound states (SABSs) and quasiparticle tunneling\nspectroscopy of three-dimensional (3D) chiral superconductor by changing the\nsurface (interface) misorientation angle of chiral superconductors. We obtain\nanalytical formula of the energy dispersion of SABS for general pair potential\nwhen an original 4$\\times$4 BdG Hamiltonian can be reduced to be two 2$\\times$2\nblocks. The resulting SABS for 3D chiral superconductors with pair potential\ngiven by $k_z(k_x + ik_y)^{\\nu}$ $({\\nu} = 1, 2)$ has a complicated energy\ndispersion due to the coexistence of both point and line nodes. We focus on the\ntunneling spectroscopy of this pairing in the presence of applied magnetic\nfield which induces Doppler shift of quasiparticle spectra. By contrast to\nprevious known Doppler effect in unconventional superconductors, zero bias\nconductance dip can change into zero bias conductance peak by external magnetic\nfield. We also study SABSs and tunneling spectroscopy for possible pairing\nsymmetries of UPt$_3$ . For this purpose, we extend a standard formula of\ntunneling conductance of unconventional superconductor junctions in order to\ntreat spin-triplet non-unitary pairings. The magneto tunneling spectroscopy,\ni.e., tunneling spectroscopy in the presence of magnetic field, can serve as a\nguide to determine the pairing symmetry of this material.\n", "  Baryogenesis via leptogenesis is investigated in a specific model of light\nneutrino masses and mixing angles. The latter was proposed on the basis of an\nassumed complex-extended scaling property of the neutrino Majorana mass matrix\n$M_\\nu$, derived with a type-1 seesaw from a Dirac mass matrix $m_D$ and a\nheavy singlet neutrino Majorana mass matrix $M_R$. One of its important\nfeatures, highlighted here, is that there is a common source of the origin of a\nnonzero $\\theta_{13}$ and the CP violating lepton asymmetry through the\nimaginary part of $m_D$. The model predicted CP violation to be maximal for the\nDirac type and vanishing for the Majorana type. We assume strongly hierarchical\nmass eigenvalues for $M_R$. The leptonic CP asymmetry parameter\n$\\varepsilon^\\alpha_{1}\\hspace{1mm}$ with lepton flavor $\\alpha$, originating\nfrom the decays of the lightest of the heavy neutrinos $N_1$ (of mass $M_1$) at\na temperature $T\\sim M_1$, is what matters here with\n$\\varepsilon^\\alpha_{2,3}$, originating from the decays of $N_{2,3}$, being\nwashed out. The light leptonic and heavy neutrino number densities (normalized\nto the entropy density) are evolved via Boltzmann equations down to electroweak\ntemperatures to yield a baryon asymmetry through sphaleronic transitions. The\neffect of flavored vs. unflavored leptogenesis in the three mass regimes (1)\n$M_1<10^{9}$ GeV, (2) $10^9$ GeV $<M_1<$ $10^{12}$ GeV and (3) $M_1>10^{12}$\nGeV are numerically worked out for both a normal and an inverted mass ordering\nof the light neutrinos. Corresponding results on the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse are obtained, displayed and discussed.\n", "  We consider a model ecosystem of sessile species competing for space. In\nparticular, we consider the system introduced in [Mathiesen et al. Phys. Rev.\nLett. 107, 188101 (2011)] where species compete according to a fixed\ninteraction network with links determined by a Bernoulli process. In the limit\nof a small introduction rate of new species, the model exhibits a discontinuous\ntransition from a high-diversity state to a low-diversity state as the\ninteraction probability between species, $\\gamma$, is increased from zero. Here\nwe explore the effects of finite introduction rates and system-size on the\nphase transition by utilizing efficient parallel computing. We find that the\nlow state appears for $\\gamma>\\gamma_c$. As $\\gamma$ is increased further, the\nhigh state approaches to the low state, suggesting the possibility that the two\nstates merge at a high $\\gamma$. We find that the fraction of time spent in the\nhigh state becomes longer with higher introduction rates, but the availability\nof the two states is rather insensitive to the value of the introduction rate.\nFurthermore we establish a relation between the introduction rate and the\nsystem size, which preserves the probability for the system to remain in the\nhigh-diversity state.\n", "  We use a three-body Continuum Discretized Coupled Channel (CDCC) model to\ninvestigate Coulomb and nuclear effects in breakup and reaction cross sections.\nThe breakup of the projectile is simulated by a finite number of square\nintegrable wave functions. First we show that the scattering matrices can be\nsplit in a nuclear term, and in a Coulomb term. This decomposition is based on\nthe Lippmann-Schwinger equation, and requires the scattering wave functions. We\npresent two different methods to separate both effects. Then, we apply this\nseparation to breakup and reaction cross sections of 7Li + 208Pb. For breakup,\nwe investigate various aspects, such as the role of the alpha + t continuum,\nthe angular-momentum distribution, and the balance between Coulomb and nuclear\neffects. We show that there is a large ambiguity in defining the 'Coulomb' and\n'nuclear' breakup cross sections, since both techniques, although providing the\nsame total breakup cross sections, strongly differ for the individual\ncomponents. We suggest a third method which could be efficiently used to\naddress convergence problems at large angular momentum. For reaction cross\nsections, interference effects are smaller, and the nuclear contribution is\ndominant above the Coulomb barrier. We also draw attention on different\ndefinitions of the reaction cross section which exist in the literature, and\nwhich may induce small, but significant, differences in the numerical values.\n", "  We discuss that in the random phase approximation (RPA) the first derivative\nof the energy with respect to the Green's function is the self-energy in the GW\napproximation. This relationship allows us to derive compact equations for the\nRPA interatomic forces. We also show that position dependent overlap operators\nare elegantly incorporated in the present framework. The RPA force equations\nhave been implemented in the projector augmented wave formalism, and we present\nillustrative applications, including ab initio molecular dynamics simulations,\nthe calculation of phonon dispersion relations for diamond and graphite, as\nwell as structural relaxations for water on boron nitride. The present\nderivation establishes a concise framework for forces within perturbative\napproaches and is also applicable to more involved approximations for the\ncorrelation energy.\n", "  We compute all three and four point couplings of BPS $D_{p}$-branes for all\ndifferent nonzero $p$-values on the entire world volume and transverse\ndirections. We start finding out all four point function supersymmetric\nWess-Zumino (WZ) actions of one closed string Ramond-Ramond (RR) field with two\nfermions, either with the same (IIB) or different chirality (IIA) as well as\ntheir all order $\\alpha'$ corrections. The closed form of S-matrices of two\nclosed string RR in both IIB, IIA, including their all order $\\alpha'$\ncorrections have also been addressed. Our results confirm that, not only the\nstructures of $\\alpha'$ corrections but also their coefficients of IIB are\nquite different from their IIA ones.\n  The S-matrix of an RR and two gauge (scalar) fields and their all order\ncorrections in antisymmetric picture of RR have been carried out as well.\nVarious remarks on the restricted Bianchi identities as well as all order\n$\\alpha'$ corrections to all different supersymmetric WZ couplings in both type\nIIA and IIB superstring theory are also released. Lastly, different singularity\nstructures as well as all order contact terms for all non-vanishing traces in\ntype II have also been constructed.\n", "  We consider two previously studied samples of OB stars with different\ndistance scales. The first one consists of 98 massive spectroscopic binary\nstars with photometric distances, and the second one consists on 140 OB stars\nwith the distances determined along the lines of interstellar calcium. The OB\nstars are located at distances up to 7 kpc from the Sun. They are identified\nwith the Gaia DR1 catalog. It is shown that the use of the proper motions,\ntaken from the Gaia DR1 catalog, allows to reduce random errors of\ndetermination of the Galactic rotation parameters in comparison with the\npreviously known ones. From the analysis of 208 OB stars from the Gaia DR1\ncatalog with proper motions and parallaxes with relative errors less than 200%\nwe found the Galactic kinematic parameters. In addition the Galactic rotation\nparameters were obtained from only line-of-sight velocities of the same stars.\nFrom the comparison of the two values of \\Omega^{'}_0 a distance scale of the\nGaia DR1 catalog was determined as a value close to unit, namely 0.96. From 238\nOB-stars of the united sample with photometric distances for stars of the first\nsample and distances in the calcium scale for stars of the second sample,\nline-of-sight velocities and proper motions from the Gaia DR1 catalog, were\nfound the following kinematic parameters:\n(U,V,W)_\\odot=(8.19,9.28,8.79)+/-(0.74,0.92,0.74) km/s, \\Omega_0=31.53+/-0.54\nkm/s/kpc, \\Omega^{'}_0=-4.44+/-0.12 km/s/kpc^2, \\Omega^{\"}_0=0.706+/-0.100\nkm/s/kpc^3, here Oort constants: A=-17.77+/-0.46 km/s/kpc, B=13.76+/-0.71\nkm/s/kpc and V_0=252+/-8 km/s.\n", "  The accurate description of the non-linear response of many-electron systems\nto strong-laser fields remains a major challenge. Methods that bypass the\nunfavorable exponential scaling with particle number are required to address\nlarger systems. In this paper we present a fully three-dimensional\nimplementation of the time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix\n(TD-2RDM) method for many-electron atoms. We benchmark this approach by a\ncomparison with multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree-Fock (MCTDHF)\nresults for the harmonic spectra of beryllium and neon. We show that the\nTD-2RDM is very well-suited to describe the non-linear atomic response and to\nreveal the influence of electron-correlation effects.\n", "  We prove convergence of the multi-body correlation function as a power series\nin the density. We work in the context of the cluster expansion in the\ncanonical ensemble and we obtain bounds uniform in the volume and the number of\nparticles. In the thermodynamic limit, the coefficients are characterized by\nsums over some class of two-connected graphs. We introduce the \"direct\ncorrelation function\" in the canonical ensemble and we prove that in the\nthermodynamic limit it is given by a convergent power series in the density\nwith coefficients given by sums over some other class of two-connected graphs.\nFurthermore, it satisfies the Ornstein-Zernike equation from which quantified\napproximations can be derived.\n", "  We continue the study of the Inverse Participation Ratios (IPRs) of the XXZ\nHeisenberg spin chain initiated by Misguich, Pasquier and Luck (2016) by\nfocusing on the case of the XX Heisenberg Spin Chain. For the ground state,\nMisguich et al. note that calculating the IPR is equivalent to Dyson's constant\nterm ex-conjecture. We express the IPRs of excited states as an apparently new\n\"discrete\" Hall inner product. We analyze this inner product using the theory\nof symmetric functions (Jack polynomials, Schur polynomials, the standard Hall\ninner product and $\\omega_{q,t}$) to determine some exact expressions and\nasymptotics for IPRs. We show that IPRs can be indexed by partitions, and\nasymptotically the IPR of a partition is equal to that of the conjugate\npartition. We relate the IPRs to two other models from physics, namely, the\ncircular symplectic ensemble of Dyson and the Dyson-Gaudin two-dimensional\nCoulomb lattice gas. Finally, we provide a description of the IPRs in terms of\na signed count of diagonals of permutohedra.\n", "  Using 17 chemical elements as a proxy for stellar DNA, we present a full\nphylogenetic study of stars in the solar neighbourhood. This entails applying a\nclustering technique that is widely used in molecular biology to construct an\nevolutionary tree from which three branches emerge. These are interpreted as\nstellar populations which separate in age and kinematics and can be thus\nattributed to the thin disk, the thick disk, and an intermediate population of\nprobable distinct origin. We further find six lone stars of intermediate age\nthat could not be assigned to any population with enough statistical\nsignificance. Combining the ages of the stars with their position on the tree,\nwe are able to quantify the mean rate of chemical enrichment of each of the\npopulations, and thus show in a purely empirical way that the star formation\nrate in the thick disk is much higher than in the thin disk. We are also able\nto estimate the relative contribution of dynamical processes such as radial\nmigration and disk heating to the distribution of chemical elements in the\nsolar neighbourhood. Our method offers an alternative approach to chemical\ntagging methods with the advantage of visualising the behaviour of chemical\nelements in evolutionary trees. This offers a new way to search for `common\nancestors' that can reveal the origin of solar neighbourhood stars.\n", "  Non-destructive weak measurements (WM) made on a quantum particle allow to\nextract information as the particle evolves from a prepared state to a finally\ndetected state. The physical meaning of this information has been open to\ndebate, particularly in view of the apparent discontinuous trajectories of the\nparticle recorded by WM. In this work we investigate the properties of\nvanishing weak values for projection operators as well as general observables.\nWe then analyze the implications when inferring the past of a quantum particle.\nWe provide a novel (non-optical) example for which apparent discontinuous\ntrajectories are obtained by WM. Our approach is compared to previous results.\n", "  A stellar occultation by a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) provides an\nopportunity to probe its size and shape. Very few occultations by TNOs have\nbeen sampled simultaneously from multiple locations, while a robust estimation\nof shadow size has been possible for only two objects. We present the first\nobservation of an occultation by the TNO 2007 UK126 on 15 November 2014,\nmeasured by three observers, one nearly on and two almost symmetrical to the\nshadow's centerline. This is the first multi-chord dataset obtained for a\nso-called detached object, a TNO subgroup with perihelion distances so large\nthat the giant planets have likely not perturbed their orbits. We revisit\nHerschel/PACS far-infrared data, applying a new reduction method to improve the\naccuracy of the measured fluxes. Combining both datasets allows us to\ncomprehensively characterize 2007 UK126. We use error-in-variable regression to\nsolve the non-linear problem of propagating timing errors into uncertainties of\nthe ellipse parameters. Based on the shadow's size and a previously reported\nrotation period, we expect a shape of a Maclaurin spheroid and derive a\ngeometrically plausible size range. To refine our size estimate of 2007 UK126,\nwe model its thermal emission using a thermophysical model code. We conduct a\nparametric study to predict far-infrared fluxes and compare them to the\nHerschel/PACS measurements. The favorable geometry of our occultation chords,\ncombined with minimal dead-time imaging, and precise GPS time measurements,\nallow for an accurate estimation of the shadow size (best-fitting ellipse with\naxes 645.80 $\\pm$ 5.68 km $\\times$ 597.81 $\\pm$ 12.74 km) and the visual\ngeometric albedo (15.0 $\\pm$ 1.6 %). By combining our analyses of the\noccultation and the far-infrared data, we can constrain the effective diameter\nof 2007 UK126 to 599 - 629 km. We conclude that subsolar surface temperatures\nare $\\approx$ 50 - 55 K.\n", "  Dynamical system techniques are extremely useful to study cosmology. It turns\nout that in most of the cases, we deal with finite isolated fixed points\ncorresponding to a given cosmological epoch. However, it is equally important\nto analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the universe. On this paper, we show how\nthis can be carried out for 3-forms model. In fact, we show that there are\nfixed points at infinity mainly by introducing appropriate compactifications\nand defining a new time variable that washes away any potential divergence of\nthe system. The richness of 3-form models allows us as well to identify\nnormally hyperbolic non-isolated fixed points.\n", "  We use a population synthesis model that includes pebbles and gas accretion,\nplanetary migration, and a simplified chemistry scheme to study the formation\nof hot-Jupiters. Models have been proposed that these planets can either\noriginate beyond the snowline and then move inward via disk migration, or form\n\"in-situ\" inside the snowline. The goal of this work is to verify which of\nthese two scenarios is more compatible with pebble accretion, and whether we\ncan distinguish observationally between them via the resulting planetary C/O\nratios and core masses. Our results show that, for solar system composition,\nthe C/O ratios will vary but moderately between the two populations, since a\nsignificant amount of carbon and oxygen are locked up in refractories. In this\ncase, we find a strong correlation between the carbon and oxygen abundances and\ncore mass. The C/O ratio variations are more pronounced in the case where we\nassume that all carbon and oxygen are in volatiles. On average, Hot-Jupiters\nforming \"in-situ\" inside the snowline will have higher C/O ratios because they\naccrete less water ice. However, only Hot-Jupiters forming in-situ around stars\nwith C/O=0.8 can have a C/O ratio higher than unity. We finally find that, even\nwith fast pebble accretion, it is significantly easier to form Hot-Jupiters\noutside of the snowline, even if forming these \"in-situ\" is not impossible in\nthe limit of the simplifying assumptions made.\n", "  We report the detection of diffuse Ly$\\alpha$ emission, or Ly$\\alpha$ halos\n(LAHs), around star-forming galaxies at $z\\approx3.78$ and $2.66$ in the NOAO\nDeep Wide-Field Survey Bo\\\"otes field. Our samples consist of a total of\n$\\sim$1400 galaxies, within two separate regions containing spectroscopically\nconfirmed galaxy overdensities. They provide a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate how the LAH characteristics vary with host galaxy large-scale\nenvironment and physical properties. We stack Ly$\\alpha$ images of different\nsamples defined by these properties and measure their median LAH sizes by\ndecomposing the stacked Ly$\\alpha$ radial profile into a compact galaxy-like\nand an extended halo-like component. We find that the exponential scale-length\nof LAHs depends on UV continuum and Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities, but not on\nLy$\\alpha$ equivalent widths or galaxy overdensity parameters. The full\nsamples, which are dominated by low UV-continuum luminosity Ly$\\alpha$ emitters\n($M_{\\rm UV} \\gtrsim -21$), exhibit LAH sizes of 5$\\,-\\,6\\,$kpc. However, the\nmost UV- or Ly$\\alpha$-luminous galaxies have more extended halos with\nscale-lengths of 7$\\,-\\,9\\,$kpc. The stacked Ly$\\alpha$ radial profiles decline\nmore steeply than recent theoretical predictions that include the contributions\nfrom gravitational cooling of infalling gas and from low-level star formation\nin satellites. On the other hand, the LAH extent matches what one would expect\nfor photons produced in the galaxy and then resonantly scattered by gas in an\noutflowing envelope. The observed trends of LAH sizes with host galaxy\nproperties suggest that the physical conditions of the circumgalactic medium\n(covering fraction, HI column density, and outflow velocity) change with halo\nmass and/or star-formation rates.\n", "  Dynamics of the inflaton scalar field oscillating around a minimum of the\nsingular potentials in the expanding Universe is investigated. Asymptotic\nformulas are obtained describing the cosmological expansion at the late times.\nThe problem of stability of the oscillations considered and the related\nphenomenon of the field fragmentation are briefly discussed.\n", "  Dwarf Irregular galaxies (dIrrs) are the smallest stellar systems with\nextended HI discs. The study of the kinematics of such discs is a powerful tool\nto estimate the total matter distribution at these very small scales. In this\nwork, we study the HI kinematics of 17 galaxies extracted from the `Local\nIrregulars That Trace Luminosity Extremes, The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey' (LITTLE\nTHINGS). Our approach differs significantly from previous studies in that we\ndirectly fit 3D models (two spatial dimensions plus one spectral dimension)\nusing the software $^\\text{3D}$BAROLO, fully exploiting the information in the\nHI datacubes. For each galaxy we derive the geometric parameters of the HI disc\n(inclination and position angle), the radial distribution of the surface\ndensity, the velocity-dispersion ($\\sigma_v$) profile and the rotation curve.\nThe circular velocity (V$_{\\text{c}}$), which traces directly the galactic\npotential, is then obtained by correcting the rotation curve for the asymmetric\ndrift. As an initial application, we show that these dIrrs lie on a baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation in excellent agreement with that seen on larger scales.\nThe final products of this work are high-quality, ready-to-use kinematic data\n($\\textrm{V}_\\textrm{c}$ and $\\sigma_v$) that we make publicly available. These\ncan be used to perform dynamical studies and improve our understanding of these\nlow-mass galaxies.\n", "  We present Exo-Transmit, a software package to calculate exoplanet\ntransmission spectra for planets of varied composition. The code is designed to\ngenerate spectra of planets with a wide range of atmospheric composition,\ntemperature, surface gravity, and size, and is therefore applicable to\nexoplanets ranging in mass and size from hot Jupiters down to rocky\nsuper-Earths. Spectra can be generated with or without clouds or hazes with\noptions to (1) include an optically thick cloud deck at a user-specified\natmospheric pressure or (2) to augment the nominal Rayleigh scattering by a\nuser-specified factor. The Exo-Transmit code is written in C and is extremely\neasy to use. Typically the user will only need to edit parameters in a single\nuser input file in order to run the code for a planet of their choosing.\nExo-Transmit is available publicly on Github with open-source licensing at\nhttps://github.com/elizakempton/Exo_Transmit .\n", "  We study three possible ways to circumvent the sign problem in the O(3)\nnonlinear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions. We compare the results of the worm\nalgorithm to complex Langevin and multiparameter reweighting. Using the worm\nalgorithm, the thermodynamics of the model is investigated, and continuum\nresults are shown for the pressure at different $\\mu/T$ values in the range\n$0-4$. By performing $T=0$ simulations using the worm algorithm the Silver\nBlaze phenomenon is reproduced. Regarding the complex Langevin, we test various\nimplementations of discretizing the complex Langevin equation. We found that\nthe exponentialized Euler discretization of the Langevin equation gives wrong\nresults for the action and the density at low $T/m$. By performing continuum\nextrapolation we found that this discrepancy does not disappear and depends\nslightly on temperature. The discretization with spherical coordinates perform\nsimilarly at low $\\mu/T$, but goes wrong also at some higher temperatures at\nhigh $\\mu/T$. However, a third discretization that uses a constraining force to\nachieve the $\\phi^2 = 1$ condition gives correct results for the action, but\nwrong results for the density at low $\\mu/T$.\n", "  The cross section of top quark-antiquark pair production in proton-proton\ncollisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV is measured by the CMS experiment at the LHC,\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 inverse femtobarns.\nThe measurement is performed by analyzing events in which the final state\nincludes one electron, one muon, and two or more jets, at least one of which is\nidentified as originating from hadronization of a b quark. The measured cross\nsection is 815 +/- 9 (stat) +/- 38 (syst) +/- 19 (lumi) pb, in agreement with\nthe expectation from the standard model.\n", "  Rational chiral conformal field theories are organized according to their\ngenus, which consists of a modular tensor category $\\mathcal{C}$ and a central\ncharge $c$. A long-term goal is to classify unitary rational conformal field\ntheories based on a classification of unitary modular tensor categories. We\nconjecture that for any unitary modular tensor category $\\mathcal{C}$, there\nexists a unitary chiral conformal field theory $V$ so that its modular tensor\ncategory $\\mathcal{C}_V$ is $\\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we initiate a\nmathematical program in and around this conjecture. We define a class of\nextremal vertex operator algebras with minimal conformal dimensions as large as\npossible for their central charge, and non-trivial representation theory. We\nshow that there are finitely many different characters of extremal vertex\noperator algebras V possessing at most three different irreducible modules.\nMoreover, we list all of the possible characters for such vertex operator\nalgebras with $c$ at most 48.\n", "  We exploit the first data release from the Gaia mission to identify candidate\nMira variables in the outskirts of the Magellanic Clouds. The repeated\nobservations of sources during the initial phase of the Gaia mission is used to\nidentify stars that show signs of variability. This variability information,\ncombined with infrared photometry from 2MASS and WISE, allows us to select a\nclean sample of giants in the periphery of the LMC. We find evidence for Miras\nsurrounding the LMC out to ~20 deg in all directions, apart from the North-West\nquadrant. Our sample does not generally follow the gas distribution of the\nMagellanic system; Miras are notably absent in the gaseous bridge between the\nLMC and SMC, but they are likely related to the stellar RR Lyrae bridge\nreported by Belokurov et al. (2016). The stellar stream discovered by Mackey et\nal. (2016) to the North of the LMC is almost perfectly delineated by our Mira\nvariables, and likely extends further East toward the Galactic plane. The\npresence of an intermediate-age population in this stream advocates an LMC disc\norigin. We also find a significant excess of Miras to the East of the LMC;\nthese more diffusely distributed stars are likely stripped SMC stars due to\ninteractions with the LMC. Miras are also identified in regions of the sky away\nfrom the Clouds; we locate stars likely associated with known massive\nsubstructures, and also find potential associations with stripped SMC debris\nabove the Galactic plane.\n", "  Understanding possible universal properties for systems far from equilibrium\nis much less developed than for their equilibrium counterparts and poses a\nmajor challenge to present day statistical physics. The study of aging\nproperties, and how the memory of the past is conserved by the time evolution\nin presence of noise is a crucial facet of the problem. Recently, very robust\nuniversal properties were shown to arise in one-dimensional growth processes\nwith local stochastic rules,leading to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality\nclass. Yet it has remained essentially unknown how fluctuations in these\nsystems correlate at different times. Here we derive quantitative predictions\nfor the universal form of the two-time aging dynamics of growing interfaces,\nwhich, moreover, turns out to exhibit a surprising breaking of ergodicity. We\nprovide corroborating experimental observations on a turbulent liquid crystal\nsystem, which demonstrates universality. This may give insight into memory\neffects in a broader class of far-from-equilibrium systems.\n", "  We perform three-dimensional numerical relativity simulations of homogeneous\nand inhomogeneous expanding spacetimes, with a view towards quantifying\nnon-linear effects from cosmological inhomogeneities. We demonstrate\nfourth-order convergence with errors less than one part in 10^6 in evolving a\nflat, dust Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker (FLRW) spacetime using the\nEinstein Toolkit within the Cactus framework. We also demonstrate agreement to\nwithin one part in 10^3 between the numerical relativity solution and the\nlinear solution for density, velocity and metric perturbations in the Hubble\nflow over a factor of ~350 change in scale factor (redshift). We simulate the\ngrowth of linear perturbations into the non-linear regime, where effects such\nas gravitational slip and tensor perturbations appear. We therefore show that\nnumerical relativity is a viable tool for investigating nonlinear effects in\ncosmology.\n", "  We report about the anomalous Hall effect in 4f 3d metallic alloys measured\nusing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The strength of the observed\nterahertz spin-dependent transport phenomenon is in good agreement with\nexpectations based on electronic transport measurements. Employing this effect,\nwe succeeded to reveal ultrafast dynamics of the anomalous Hall effect which\naccompanies the sub-100 picosecond optically induced magnetization reversal in\na GdFeCo alloy. The experiments demonstrate the ability to control currents at\nterahertz frequencies in spintronic devices magnetically and ultrafast.\n", "  In sustained growth with random dynamics stationary distributions can exist\nwithout detailed balance. This suggests thermodynamical behavior in fast\ngrowing complex systems. In order to model such phenomena we apply both a\ndiscrete and a continuous master equation. The derivation of elementary rates\nfrom known stationary distributions is a generalization of the\nfluctuation--dissipation theorem. Entropic distance evolution is given for such\nsystems. We reconstruct distributions obtained for growing networks, particle\nproduction, scientific citations and income distribution.\n", "  Bell nonlocality can be formulated in terms of a resource theory with\nlocal-hidden variable models as resourceless objects. Two such theories are\nknown, one built upon local operations assisted by shared randomness (LOSRs)\nand the other one allowing, in addition, for prior-to-input classical\ncommunication. We show that prior communication, although unable to create\nnonlocality, leads to wirings not only beyond LOSRs but also not contained in a\nmuch broader class of (nonlocality-generating) global wirings. Technically,\nthis is shown by proving that it can improve the statistical distinguishability\nbetween Bell correlations optimised over all fixed measurement choices. This\nhas implications in nonlocality quantification, and leads us to a natural\nuniversal definition of Bell nonlocality measures. To end up with, we also\nconsider the statistical strength of nonlocality proofs. We point out some\nissues of its standard definition in the resource-theoretic operational\nframework, and suggest simple fixes for them. Our findings reveal non-trivial\nfeatures of the geometry of the set of wirings and may have implications in the\noperational distinguishability of nonlocal behaviors.\n", "  We report on the first observations of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries\nwith the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at $\\sim$300 GHz.\nQuasi-simultaneous observations of 4U 1728-34 and 4U 1820-30 were performed at\nradio (ATCA), infrared (VLT) and X-ray (Swift) frequencies, spanning more than\neight decades in frequency coverage. Both sources are detected at high\nsignificance with ALMA. The spectral energy distribution of 4U 1728-34 is\nconsistent with synchrotron emission from a jet with a break from optically\nthick to optically thin emission at 1.3-11.0$\\times$10$^{13}$ Hz. This is the\nthird time a jet spectral break has been reported for a neutron star X-ray\nbinary. The radio to mm spectral energy distribution of 4U 1820-30 has\nsignificant detections at 5 and 300~GHz. This confirms the presence of radio\nemission during a soft state for this neutron star and represents the first\ndetection of mm emission during such a state, unambiguously pointing to the\npresence of a jet. We also report on three additional unrelated sources -\nshowing mm emission - in the ALMA fields of view of 4U 1728-34 and 4U 1820-30.\n", "  For the spectral analysis of high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise spectra\nof hot stars, state-of-the-art non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model\natmospheres are mandatory. These are strongly dependent on the reliability of\nthe atomic data that is used for their calculation.\n  To search for Zr and Xe lines in the ultraviolet (UV) spectra of G191-B2B and\nRE0503-289, new Zr IV-VII, Xe IV-V, and Xe VIII oscillator strengths were\ncalculated. This allows for the first time, determination of the Zr abundance\nin white dwarf (WD) stars and improvement of the Xe abundance determinations.\n  We calculated Zr IV-VII, Xe IV-V, and Xe VIII oscillator strengths to\nconsider radiative and collisional bound-bound transitions of Zr and Xe in our\nNLTE stellar-atmosphere models for the analysis of their lines exhibited in UV\nobservations of the hot WDs G191-B2B and RE0503-289.\n  We identified one new Zr IV, 14 new Zr V, and ten new Zr VI lines in the\nspectrum of RE0503-289. Zr was detected for the first time in a WD. We measured\na Zr abundance of -3.5 +/- 0.2 (logarithmic mass fraction, approx. 11 500 times\nsolar). We dentified five new Xe VI lines and determined a Xe abundance of -3.9\n+/- 0.2 (approx. 7500 times solar). We determined a preliminary photospheric Al\nabundance of -4.3 +/- 0.2 (solar) in RE0503-289. In the spectra of G191-B2B, no\nZr line was identified. The strongest Zr IV line (1598.948 A) in our model gave\nan upper limit of -5.6 +/- 0.3 which is about 100 times solar. No Xe line was\nidentified in the UV spectrum of G191-B2B and we confirmed the previously\ndetermined upper limit of -6.8 +/- 0.3 (ten times solar).\n  Precise measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for\nadvanced NLTE stellar-atmosphere modeling. Observed Zr IV - VI and Xe VI - VII\nline profiles in the UV spectrum of RE0503-289 were simultaneously well\nreproduced.\n", "  The strong subadditivity inequality of von Neumann entropy relates the\nentropy of subsystems of a tripartite state $\\rho_{ABC}$ to that of the\ncomposite system. Here, we define $\\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\\rho_{ABC})$ as the\nextent to which $\\rho_{ABC}$ fails to satisfy the strong subadditivity\ninequality $S(\\rho_{B})+S(\\rho_{C}) \\le S(\\rho_{AB})+S(\\rho_{AC})$ with\nequality and investigate its properties. In particular, by introducing\nauxiliary subsystem $E$, we consider any purification $|\\psi_{ABCE}\\rangle$ of\n$\\rho_{ABC}$ and formulate $\\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\\rho_{ABC})$ as the extent to\nwhich the bipartite quantum correlations of $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{AC}$,\nmeasured by entanglement of formation and quantum discord, change under the\ntransformation $B\\rightarrow BE$ and $C\\rightarrow CE$. Invariance of quantum\ncorrelations of $\\rho_{AB}$ and $\\rho_{AC}$ under such transformation is shown\nto be a necessary and sufficient condition for vanishing\n$\\boldsymbol{T}^{(a)}(\\rho_{ABC})$. Our approach allows one to characterize,\nintuitively, the structure of states for which the strong subadditivity is\nsaturated. Moreover, along with providing a conservation law for quantum\ncorrelations of states for which the strong subadditivity inequality is\nsatisfied with equality, we find that such states coincides with those that the\nKoashi-Winter monogamy relation is saturated.\n", "  An influence of the phonon-phonon coupling (PPC) on the $\\beta$-decay\nhalf-lives and multi-neutron emission probabilities is analysed within the\nmicroscopic model based on the Skyrme interaction with tensor components\nincluded. The finite-rank separable approximation is used in order to handle\nlarge two-quasiparticle spaces. The even-even nuclei near the r-process pathes\nat $N=82$ are studied. The characteristics of ground states, $2^+$ excitations\nand $\\beta$-decay strength of the neutron-rich Cd isotopes are treated in\ndetail. It is shown that a strong redistribution of the Gamow-Teller strength\ndue to the PPC is mostly sensitive to the multi-neutron emission probability of\nthe Cd isotopes.\n", "  We discuss the computation of holographic entanglement entropy for interface\nconformal field theories. The fact that globally well defined Fefferman-Graham\ncoordinates are difficult to construct makes the regularization of the\nholographic theory challenging. We introduce a simple new cut-off procedure,\nwhich we call \"double cut-off\" regularization. We test the new cut-off\nprocedure by comparing the results for holographic entanglement entropies using\nother cut-off procedures and find agreement. We also study three dimensional\nconformal field theories with a two dimensional interface. In that case the\ndual bulk geometry is constructed using warped geometry with an $AdS_3$ factor.\nWe define an effective central charge to the interface through the\nBrown-Henneaux formula for the $AdS_3$ factor. We investigate two concrete\nexamples, showing that the same effective central charge appears in the\ncomputation of entanglement entropy and governs the conformal anomaly.\n", "  We discuss motions of extended bodies in Kerr spacetime by using\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations. We firstly solve the conditions for\ncircular orbits, and calculate the orbital frequency shift due to the mass\nquadrupoles. The results show that we need not consider the spin-induced\nquadrupoles in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals for spatial gravitational wave\ndetectors. We quantitatively investigate the temporal variation of rotational\nvelocity of the extended body due to the coupling of quadrupole and background\ngravitational field. For generic orbits, we numerically integrate the\nMathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations for evolving the motion of an extended\nbody orbiting a Kerr black hole. By comparing with the monopole-dipole\napproximation, we reveal the influences of quadrupole moments of extended\nbodies on the orbital motion and chaotic dynamics of extreme-mass-ratio\nsystems. We do not find any chaotic orbits for the extended bodies with\nphysical spins and spin-induced quadrupoles. Possible implications for\ngravitational wave detection and pulsar timing observation are outlined.\n", "  In supersymmetric models with radiatively-driven naturalness and light\nhiggsinos, the top squarks may lie in the 0.5- 3TeV range and thus only a\nfraction of natural parameter space is accessible to LHC searches. We outline\nthe range of top squark and lightest SUSY particle masses preferred by\nelectroweak naturalness in the standard parameter space plane. We note that the\nbranching fraction for b-> s\\gamma decay favors top squarks much heavier than\n500 GeV. Such a range of top-squark mass values is in contrast to previous\nexpectations where m(stop)<500 GeV had been considered natural. In radiative\nnatural SUSY, top squarks decay roughly equally via t1-> bW1 and Z_{1,2} where\nW1 and Z_{1,2} are higgsino-like electroweak-inos. Thus, top squark pair\nproduction should yield all of t\\bar{t}+\\eslt, t\\bar{b}+\\eslt, b\\bar{t}+\\eslt\nand b\\bar{b}+\\eslt signatures at comparable rates. We propose that future LHC\ntop squark searches take place within a semi-simplified model which corresponds\nmore closely to expectations from theory.\n", "  We present high signal-to-noise galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the\nBOSS CMASS sample using 250 square degrees of weak lensing data from CFHTLenS\nand CS82. We compare this signal with predictions from mock catalogs trained to\nmatch observables including the stellar mass function and the projected and two\ndimensional clustering of CMASS. We show that the clustering of CMASS, together\nwith standard models of the galaxy-halo connection, robustly predicts a lensing\nsignal that is 20-40% larger than observed. Detailed tests show that our\nresults are robust to a variety of systematic effects. Lowering the value of\n$S_{\\rm 8}=\\sigma_{\\rm 8} \\sqrt{\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ compared to Planck2015\nreconciles the lensing with clustering. However, given the scale of our\nmeasurement ($r<10$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc), other effects may also be at play and need\nto be taken into consideration. We explore the impact of baryon physics,\nassembly bias, massive neutrinos, and modifications to general relativity on\n$\\Delta\\Sigma$ and show that several of these effects may be non-negligible\ngiven the precision of our measurement. Disentangling cosmological effects from\nthe details of the galaxy-halo connection, the effects of baryons, and massive\nneutrinos, is the next challenge facing joint lensing and clustering analyses.\nThis is especially true in the context of large galaxy samples from Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillation surveys with precise measurements but complex selection\nfunctions.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope will enable astronomers to obtain exoplanet\nspectra of unprecedented precision. Especially the MIRI instrument may shed\nlight on the nature of the cloud particles obscuring planetary transmission\nspectra in the optical and near-infrared. We provide self-consistent\natmospheric models and synthetic JWST observations for prime exoplanet targets\nin order to identify spectral regions of interest and estimate the number of\ntransits needed to distinguish between model setups. We select targets which\nspan a wide range in planetary temperature and surface gravity, ranging from\nsuper-Earths to giant planets, and have a high expected SNR. For all targets we\nvary the enrichment, C/O ratio, presence of optical absorbers (TiO/VO) and\ncloud treatment. We calculate atmospheric structures and emission and\ntransmission spectra for all targets and use a radiometric model to obtain\nsimulated observations. We analyze JWST's ability to distinguish between\nvarious scenarios. We find that in very cloudy planets such as GJ 1214b less\nthan 10 transits with NIRSpec may be enough to reveal molecular features.\nFurther, the presence of small silicate grains in atmospheres of hot Jupiters\nmay be detectable with a single JWST MIRI transit. For a more detailed\ncharacterization of such particles less than 10 transits are necessary.\nFinally, we find that some of the hottest hot Jupiters are well fitted by\nmodels which neglect the redistribution of the insolation and harbor\ninversions, and that 1-4 eclipse measurements with NIRSpec are needed to\ndistinguish between the inversion models. Wet thus demonstrate the capabilities\nof JWST for solving some of the most intriguing puzzles in current exoplanet\natmospheric research. Further, by publishing all models calculated for this\nstudy we enable the community to carry out similar or retrieval analyses for\nall planets included in our target list.\n", "  We propose new searches for axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in\nflavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. This proposal exploits the\noften-overlooked coupling of ALPs to W bosons, leading to FCNC production of\nALPs even in the absence of a direct coupling to fermions. Our proposed\nsearches for resonant ALP production in decays such as $B\\rightarrow\nK^{(*)}a,\\,a\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ and $K\\rightarrow \\pi a, \\,a\\rightarrow\n\\gamma\\gamma$ could greatly improve upon the current sensitivity to ALP\ncouplings to Standard Model particles. We also determine analogous constraints\nand discovery prospects for invisibly decaying ALPs.\n", "  We calculate the radiative properties of Sagittarius A* -- spectral energy\ndistribution, variability, and radio-infrared images -- using the first 3D,\nphysically motivated black hole accretion models that directly evolve the\nelectron thermodynamics in general relativistic MHD simulations. These models\nreproduce the coupled disc-jet structure for the emission favored by previous\nphenomenological analytic and numerical works. More specifically, we find that\nthe low frequency radio emission is dominated by emission from a polar outflow\nwhile the emission above 100 GHz is dominated by the inner region of the\naccretion disc. The latter produces time variable near infrared (NIR) and X-ray\nemission, with frequent flaring events (including IR flares without\ncorresponding X-ray flares and IR flares with weak X-ray flares). The photon\nring is clearly visible at 230 GHz and 2 microns, which is encouraging for\nfuture horizon-scale observations. We also show that anisotropic electron\nthermal conduction along magnetic field lines has a negligible effect on the\nradiative properties of our model. We conclude by noting limitations of our\ncurrent generation of first-principles models, particularly that the outflow is\ncloser to adiabatic than isothermal and thus underpredicts the low frequency\nradio emission.\n", "  Artificial gauge fields are versatile tools that allow to influence the\ndynamics of ultracold atoms in Bose-Einstein condensates. Here we discuss a\nmethod of artificial gauge field generation stemming from the evanescent fields\nof the curved surface of an optical nanofibre. The exponential decay of the\nevanescent fields leads to large gradients in the generalized Rabi frequency\nand therefore to the presence of geometric vector and scalar potentials. By\nsolving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in the presence of the artificial gauge\nfields originating from the fundamental HE$_{11}$ mode of the fibre, we show\nthat vortex rings can be created in a controlled manner. We also calculate the\nmagnetic fields resulting from the higher order HE$_{21}$, TE$_{01}$, and\nTM$_{01}$ modes and compare them to the fundamental HE$_{11}$ mode.\n", "  We have measured the reflectivity of the optimally doped\nCa$_{8.5}$La$_{1.5}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_{10}$As$_{10}$) single crystal ($T_c$ =\n32.8K) over the broad frequency range from 40 to 12000 $cm^{-1}$ and for\ntemperatures from 8 to 300 K. The optical conductivity spectra of the low\nfrequency region ($< 1,000$ $cm^{-1}$) in the normal state (80 K $< T \\leq$ 300\nK) is well fitted with two Drude forms, which indicates the presence of\nmultiple bands at the Fermi level. Decreasing temperature below 80 K, this low\nfrequency Drude spectra develops pseudogap (PG) hump structure at around\n$\\approx 100$ $cm^{-1}$ and continuously evolves into the fully opened\nsuperconducting (SC) gap structure below $T_c$. Theoretical calculations of the\noptical conductivity with the preformed Cooper pair model provide an excellent\ndescription of the temperature evolution of the PG structure above $T_c$ into\nthe SC gap structure below $T_c$. The extracted two SC gap sizes are $\\Delta_S$\n= 4.9 $meV$ and $\\Delta_L$ = 14.2 $meV$, suggesting\nCa$_{8.5}$La$_{1.5}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$)(Fe$_{10}$As$_{10}$) as a multiple gap\nsuperconductor with a mixed character of the weak coupling and strong coupling\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  It is now well-established that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) can\nbe determined from the absorption line spectra of old stellar systems, and this\nhas been used to measure the IMF and its variation across the early-type galaxy\npopulation. Previous work focused on measuring the slope of the IMF over one or\nmore stellar mass intervals, implicitly assuming that this is a good\ndescription of the IMF and that the IMF has a universal low-mass cutoff. In\nthis work we consider more flexible IMFs, including two-component power-laws\nwith a variable low-mass cutoff and a general non-parametric model. We\ndemonstrate with mock spectra that the detailed shape of the IMF can be\naccurately recovered as long as the data quality are high (S/N$\\gtrsim300$) and\ncover a wide wavelength range (0.4um-1.0um). We apply these flexible IMF models\nto a high S/N spectrum of the center of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1407.\nFitting the spectrum with non-parametric IMFs, we find that the IMF in the\ncenter shows a continuous rise extending toward the hydrogen-burning limit,\nwith a behavior that is well-approximated by a power-law with an index of -2.7.\nThese results provide strong evidence for the existence of extreme\n(super-Salpeter) IMFs in the cores of massive galaxies.\n", "  Final results are presented from the inclusive measurement of deep-inelastic\npolarised-muon scattering on longitudinally polarised deuterons using a $^6$LiD\ntarget. The data were taken at $160~{\\rm GeV}$ beam energy and the results are\nshown for the kinematic range $1~({\\rm GeV}/c)^2 < Q^2 < 100~({\\rm GeV}/c)^2$\nin photon virtuality, $0.004<x<0.7$ in the Bjorken scaling variable and $W >\n4~{\\rm GeV}/c^2$ in the mass of the hadronic final state. The deuteron\ndouble-spin asymmetry $A_1^{\\rm d}$ and the deuteron longitudinal-spin\nstructure function $g_1^{\\rm d}$ are presented in bins of $x$ and $Q^2$.\nTowards lowest accessible values of $x$, $g_1^{\\rm d}$ decreases and becomes\nconsistent with zero within uncertainties. The presented final $g_1^{\\rm d}$\nvalues together with the recently published final $g_1^{\\rm p}$ values of\nCOMPASS are used to again evaluate the Bjorken sum rule and perform the QCD fit\nto the $g_1$ world data at next-to-leading order of the strong coupling\nconstant. In both cases, changes in central values of the resulting numbers are\nwell within statistical uncertainties. The flavour-singlet axial charge $a_0$,\n{which is identified in the $\\overline{\\rm MS}$ renormalisation scheme with the\ntotal contribution of quark helicities to the nucleon spin}, is extracted from\nonly the COMPASS deuteron data with negligible extrapolation uncertainty: $a_0\n(Q^2 = 3~({\\rm GeV}/c)^2) = 0.32 \\pm 0.02_{\\rm stat} \\pm0.04_{\\rm syst} \\pm\n0.05_{\\rm evol}$. Together with the recent results on the proton spin structure\nfunction $g_1^{\\rm p}$, the results on $g_1^{\\rm d}$ constitute the COMPASS\nlegacy on the measurements of $g_1$ through inclusive spin-dependent deep\ninelastic scattering.\n", "  This paper summarizes the studies of plasma kinetic instabilities in the\nelectron cyclotron frequency range carried out over the last decade at the\nInstitute of Applied Physics of Russian Academy of Sciences. We investigate the\nnonequilibrium plasma created and sustained by high-power microwave radiation\nof a gyrotron under the electron cyclotron resonance condition. Resonant plasma\nheating results in the formation of at least two electron components, one of\nwhich, more dense and cold, determines the dispersion properties of the\nhigh-frequency waves, and the second, a small group of energetic electrons with\na highly anisotropic velocity distribution, is responsible for the excitation\nof unstable waves. Dynamic spectra and the intensity of stimulated\nelectromagnetic emission are studied with high temporal resolution.\nInterpretation of observed data is based on the cyclotron maser paradigm, in\nthis context, a laboratory modeling of non-stationary wave-particle interaction\nprocesses have much in common with similar processes occurring in the\nmagnetosphere of the Earth, planets, and in solar coronal loops.\n", "  Weak Equivalent Principle (WEP) can be tested through the parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$, representing the space curvature produced by\nunit rest mass. The parameter $\\gamma$ in turn has been constrained by\ncomparing the arrival times of photons originating in distant transient events,\nsuch as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts as well as giant pulses of pulsars.\nThose measurements normally correspond to an individual burst event with very\nlimited energy bands and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In this letter, the\ndiscrepancy in the pulse arrival times of the Crab Pulsar between different\nenergy bands is obtained by the phase difference between corresponding pulse\nprofiles. This allows us to compare the pulse arrival times at the largest\nenergy band differences, between radio and optical, radio and X-ray, radio and\ngamma-ray respectively. As the pulse profiles are generated by phase-folding\nthousands of individual pulses, the time discrepancies between two energy bands\nare actually measured from thousands of events at each energy band, which\ncorresponds to much higher S/N. The upper limit of the $\\gamma$ discrepancy set\nby such an extensively-observed and well-modeled source is as follows:\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{\\gamma-ray}<3.28\\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference\nof $E_{\\gamma-ray}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{13}$,\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{X-ray}<4.01\\times10^{-9}$ at the energy difference of\n$E_{X-ray}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{9}$,\n$\\gamma_{radio}-\\gamma_{optical}<2.63\\times10^{-9}$ at\n$E_{optical}/E_{radio}\\sim10^{5}$, and\n$\\gamma_{optical}-\\gamma_{\\gamma-ray}<3.03\\times10^{-10}$ at\n$E_{\\gamma-ray}/E_{optical}\\sim10^8$. This actually measures the arrival times\nof freely-falling photons in the gravitational field of the Milky Way with the\nlargest amount of events and with data of the highest S/N, which tests WEP at\nthe energy band differences that has never been reached before.\n", "  It has been shown that the product of the entropies of the inner Cauchy and\nouter event horizon of the charged axisymmetric and stationary black holes is a\nuniversal formula, which is independent of the black hole's mass. In this\npaper, we investigate this universality for the two kinds of rotating black\nholes in the three-dimensional gravity models. In fact, we study the spacelike\nwarped anti-de Sitter black hole in the new massive gravity and the Ba~nados,\nTeitelboim, and Zanelli black hole in the minimal massive gravity. We show that\nthis rule is held in the first theory. By contrast, in the latter case which\nincludes a holographic gravitational anomalous term, we obtain that the\nuniversality does not work and the product depends on the mass. As a complement\nto the above verification, we also study the thermodynamic properties of these\nblack holes.\n", "  We explore the long-time dynamics of Rabi model in a driven-dissipative\nsetting and show that, as the atom-cavity coupling strength becomes larger than\nthe cavity frequency, a new time scale emerges. This time scale, much larger\nthan the natural relaxation time of the atom and the cavity, leads to\nlong-lived metastable states susceptible to being observed experimentally. By\napplying a Floquet-Liouville approach to the time-dependent master equation, we\nsystematically investigate the set of possible metastable states. We find that\nthe properties of the metastable states can differ drastically from those of\nthe steady state and relate these properties to the energy spectrum of the Rabi\nHamiltonian.\n", "  We estimate the systemic orbital kinematics of the Milky Way classical\nsatellites and compare them with predictions from the \\Lambda{} cold dark\nmatter (\\Lambda{}CDM) model derived from a semi-analytical galaxy formation\nmodel applied to high resolution cosmological N-body simulations. We find that\nthe Galactic satellite system is atypical of \\Lambda{}CDM systems. The subset\nof 10 Galactic satellites with proper motion measurements has a velocity\nanisotropy, \\beta=-2.2$\\pm$0.4, that lies in the 2.9% tail of the \\Lambda{}CDM\ndistribution. Individually, the Milky Way satellites have radial velocities\nthat are lower than expected for their proper motions, with 9 out of the 10\nhaving at most 20% of their orbital kinetic energy invested in radial motion.\nSuch extreme values are expected in only 1.5% of \\Lambda{}CDM satellites\nsystems. This tangential motion excess is unrelated to the existence of a\nGalactic \"disc of satellites\". We present theoretical predictions for larger\nsatellite samples that may become available as more proper motion measurements\nare obtained.\n", "  We observed three radio relics in galaxy clusters and one radio relic\ncandidate at 4.85 and 8.35 GHz in total emission and linearly polarized\nemission with the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and one radio relic candidate in\nX-rays with the Chandra telescope. The radio spectra of the integrated emission\nbelow 8.35 GHz can be well fitted by single power laws for all four relics. The\nflat spectra (spectral indices of 0.9 and 1.0) for the \"Sausage\" relic in\ncluster CIZA J2242+53 and the \"Toothbrush\" relic in cluster 1RXS 06+42 indicate\nthat models describing the origin of relics have to include effects beyond the\nassumptions of diffuse shock acceleration. The spectra of the radio relics in\nZwCl 0008+52 and in Abell 1612 are steep, as expected from weak shocks (Mach\nnumber $\\approx 2.4$). We find polarization degrees of more than 50 % in the\ntwo prominent Mpc-sized radio relics, the Sausage and the Toothbrush. The high\ndegree of polarization indicates that the magnetic field vectors are almost\nperfectly aligned along the relic structure. The polarization degrees\ncorrespond to Mach numbers of $>2.2$. Polarized emission is also detected in\nthe radio relics in ZwCl 0008+52 and, for the first time, in Abell 1612. Abell\n1612 shows a complex X-ray surface brightness distribution, indicating a recent\nmajor merger. No Faraday depolarization is detected between 4.85 GHz and 8.35\nGHz, except for one component of the Toothbrush relic. Faraday depolarization\nbetween 1.38 GHz and 8.35 GHz varies with distance from the center of the host\ncluster 1RXS 06+42, which can be explained by a decrease in electron density\nand/or in strength of a turbulent magnetic field. Faraday rotation measures\nshow large-scale gradients along the relics, which cannot be explained by\nvariations in the Milky Way foreground. Large-scale regular fields appear to be\npresent in intergalactic space around galaxy clusters.\n", "  We discuss the conditions under which plane electromagnetic and gravitational\nwaves can be amplified by a rotating black hole due to superradiant scattering.\nWe show, in particular, that amplification can occur for low-frequency waves\nwith an incidence angle parametrically close to 0 (or $\\pi$) with respect to\nthe black hole spin axis and with a parametrically small left (or right)\npolarization. This is the case of the radiation emitted by a spinning\nelectric/magnetic dipole or gravitational quadrupole orbiting a black hole\ncompanion at large radius and co-rotating with the latter. This can yield\nobservable effects of superradiance, for example, in neutron star-stellar mass\nblack hole binaries, as well as in triple systems composed by a compact binary\norbiting a central supermassive black hole. Due to superradiance, the total\nsource luminosity in these systems exhibits a characteristic orbital modulation\nthat may lead to significant observational signatures, thus paving the way for\ntesting, in the near future, one of the most peculiar predictions of general\nrelativity.\n", "  Vacuum consists of a bath of balanced and symmetric positive and negative\nfrequency fluctuations. Media in relative motion or accelerated observers can\nbreak this symmetry and preferentially amplify negative frequency modes as in\nQuantum Cherenkov radiation and Unruh radiation. Here, we show the existence of\na universal negative frequency-momentum mirror symmetry in the relativistic\nLorentzian transformation for electromagnetic waves. We show the connection of\nour discovered symmetry to parity-time (PT) symmetry in moving media and the\nresulting spectral singularity in vacuum fluctuation related effects. We prove\nthat this spectral singularity can occur in the case of two metallic plates in\nrelative motion interacting through positive and negative frequency plasmonic\nfluctuations (negative frequency resonance). Our work paves the way for\nunderstanding the role of PT-symmetric spectral singularities in amplifying\nfluctuations and motivates the search for PT-symmetry in novel photonic\nsystems.\n", "  We revisit the properties of the two-component Fermi gas with short-range\ninteractions in three dimensions, in the limit where the s-wave scattering\nlength diverges. Such a unitary Fermi gas possesses universal thermodynamic and\ndynamical observables that are independent of any interaction length scale.\nFocusing on trapped systems of N fermions, where N$\\leq10$, we investigate how\nwell we can determine the zero-temperature behavior of the many-body system\nfrom published few-body data on the ground-state energy and the contact. For\nthe unpolarized case, we find that the Bertsch parameters extracted from\ntrapped few-body systems all lie within 15% of the established value.\nFurthermore, the few-body values for the contact are well within the range of\nvalues determined in the literature for the many-body system. In the limit of\nlarge spin polarization, we obtain a similar accuracy for the polaron energy,\nand we estimate the polaron's effective mass from the dependence of its energy\non N. We also compute an upper bound for the squared wave-function overlap\nbetween the unitary Fermi system and the non-interacting ground state, both for\nthe trapped and uniform cases. This allows us to prove that the trapped\nunpolarised ground state at unitarity has zero overlap with its non-interacting\ncounterpart in the many-body limit N$\\to \\infty$.\n", "  The computation of transport coefficients, even in linear response, is a\nmajor challenge for theoretical methods that rely on analytic continuation of\ncorrelations functions obtained numerically in Matsubara space. While maximum\nentropy methods can be used for certain correlation functions, this is not\npossible in general, important examples being the Seebeck, Hall, Nernst and\nReggi-Leduc coefficients. Indeed, positivity of the spectral weight on the\npositive real-frequency axis is not guaranteed in these cases. The spectral\nweight can even be complex in the presence of broken time-reversal symmetry.\nVarious workarounds, such as the neglect of vertex corrections or the study of\nthe infinite frequency or Kelvin limits have been proposed. Here, we show that\none can define auxiliary response functions that allow to extract the desired\nreal-frequency susceptibilities from maximum entropy methods in the most\ngeneral multiorbital cases with no particular symmetry. As a benchmark case, we\nstudy the longitudinal thermoelectric response and corresponding Onsager\ncoefficient in the single-band two-dimensional Hubbard model treated with\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo\n(CTQMC). We thereby extend to transport coefficients the maximum entropy\nanalytic continuation with auxiliary functions (MaxEntAux method), developed\nfor the study of the superconducting pairing dynamics of correlated materials.\n", "  Several early Universe scenarios predict a direction-dependent spectrum of\nprimordial curvature perturbations. This translates into the violation of the\nstatistical isotropy of cosmic microwave background radiation. Previous\nsearches for statistical anisotropy mainly focussed on a quadrupolar\ndirection-dependence characterised by a single multipole vector and an overall\namplitude $g_*$. Generically, however, the quadrupole has a more complicated\ngeometry described by two multipole vectors and $g_*$. This is the subject of\nthe present work. In particular, we limit the amplitude $g_*$ for different\nshapes of the quadrupole by making use of Planck 2015 maps. We also constrain\ncertain inflationary scenarios which predict this kind of more general\nquadrupolar statistical anisotropy.\n", "  We investigate the three-body system of $\\pi \\bar{K} K^*$ by using the\nfixed-center approximation to the Faddeev equation, taking the interaction\nbetween $\\pi$ and $\\bar{K}$, $\\pi$ and $K^*$, and $\\bar{K}$ and $K^*$ from the\nchiral unitary approach. The study is made assuming scattering of a $\\pi$ on a\n$\\bar{K} K^*$ cluster, which is known to generate the $f_1(1285)$ state. The\nresonant structure around $1650$ MeV shows up in the modulus squared of the\n$\\pi$-$(\\bar{K} K^*)_{f_1(1285)}$ scattering amplitude and suggests that a\n$\\pi$-$(\\bar{K} K^*)_{f_1(1285)}$ state, with \"exotic\" quantum numbers $J^{PC}\n= 1^{-+}$, can be formed. This state can be identified as the observed\n$\\pi_1(1600)$ resonance. We suggest that this is the origin of the present\n$\\pi_1(1600)$ resonance and propose to look at the $\\pi f_1(1285)$ mode in\nfuture experiments to clarify the issue.\n", "  It is now well established that superconducting cuprates support a charge\ndensity wave state in the so-called underdoped region of their phase diagram.\nWe investigate the possibility of charge order in the square-lattice Hubbard\nmodel, both alone and in coexistence with $d$-wave superconductivity. The\ncharge order has a period four in one direction, is centered on bonds and has a\n$d$ form factor. We use the variational cluster approximation, an approach\nbased on a rigorous variational principle that treats short-range correlations\nexactly, with two clusters of size $2\\times6$ that together tile the infinite\nlattice and provide a non-biased unit for a period-four bond density wave\n(BDW). We find that the BDW exists in a finite range of hole doping and\nincreases in strength from $U=5$ to $U=8$. Its location and intensity depends\nstrongly on the band dispersion. When probed simultaneously with $d$-wave\nsuperconductivity, the energy is sometimes lowered by the presence of both\nphases, depending on the interaction strength. Whenever they coexist, a\npair-density wave (a modulation of superconducting pairing with the same period\nand form factor as the BDW) also exists.\n", "  In this paper we revisit the one-dimensional tunneling problem. We consider\nKemble's approximation for the transmission coefficient. We show how this\napproximation can be extended to above-barrier energies by performing the\nanalytical continuation of the radial coordinate to the complex plane. We\ninvestigate the validity of this approximation by comparing their predictions\nfor the cross section and for the barrier distribution with the corresponding\nquantum mechanical results. We find that the extended Kemble's approximation\nreproduces the results of quantum mechanics with great accuracy.\n", "  We consider the acousto-optic effect in a random medium. We derive the\nradiative transport equations that describe the propagation of\nmultiply-scattered light in a medium whose dielectric permittivity is modulated\nby an acoustic wave. Using this result, we present an analysis of the\nsensitivity of an acousto-optic measurement to the presence of a small\nabsorbing inhomogeneity.\n", "  We combine near--deterministic preparation of a single atom with Raman\nsideband cooling, to create a push button mechanism to prepare a single atom in\nthe motional ground state of tightly focused optical tweezers. In the 2D radial\nplane, we achieve a large ground state fidelity for the entire procedure\n(loading and cooling) of $\\sim$0.73, while the ground state occupancy is\n$\\sim$0.88 for realizations with a single atom present. For 1D axial cooling,\nwe attain a ground state fraction of $\\sim$0.52. The combined 3D cooling\nprovides a ground state population of $\\sim$0.11. Our Raman sideband cooling\nvariation is indifferent to magnetic field fluctuations, allowing wide--spread\nunshielded experimental implementations. Our work provides a pathway towards a\nrange of coherent few body experiments.\n", "  Regarding tidal dissipation in Saturn, usually parameterized by Saturn's\nquality factor Q, there remains a discrepancy between conventional estimates\nand the latest determination that has been derived from astrometric\nobservations of Saturn's inner satellites. If dissipation in Saturn is as large\nas the astrometric observations suggest, conventional models predict that\nMimas' initial orbit should be located inside Saturn's synchronous orbit or\neven inside its Roche limit. Using simple structure models and assuming\nSaturn's core to be viscoelastic, we look for dissipation models which are\nconsistent with both the latest astrometric observations and with Mimas'\norbital migration. Firstly, using a two-layer model of Saturn's interior\nstructure, we constrain the ranges of rigidity and viscosity of Saturn's core\nwhich are consistent with Saturn's dissipation derived from astrometric\nobservations at the tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione. Next,\nwithin the constrained viscosity and rigidity ranges, we calculate Mimas'\nsemi-major axis considering the frequency dependence of viscoelastic\ndissipation in Saturn's core. By the two calculations, we evaluate (1)\nSaturnian models which can explain the astrometrically determined Saturnian\ndissipation, and (2) whether Mimas' initial semi-major axis is larger than the\nsynchronous orbit. We show that if the core is assumed to be solid with a\nviscosity of 10^{13}-10^{14} Pa s, the lower boundary of the observed Saturnian\ndissipation at tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione can be\nexplained by our model. In this viscosity range, Mimas can stay outside the\nsynchronous orbit and the Roche limit for 4.5 billion years of evolution. In\nthe case of a frequency dependent viscoelastic dissipative core, the lower\nboundary of the observed Saturnian dissipation can be consistent with the\norbital expansion of Mimas.\n", "  Based on first principles calculations, the electronic structure of CuTeO$_4$\nis discussed in the context of superconducting cuprates. Despite some\nsignificant crystallographic differences, we find that CuTeO$_4$ is similar to\nthese cuprates, exhibiting a quasi two dimensional electronic structure that\ninvolves hybridized Cu-$d$ and O-$p$ states in the vicinity of the Fermi level,\nalong with an antiferromagnetic insulating ground state. Hole doping this\nmaterial by substituting Te$^{6+}$ with Sb$^{5+}$ would be of significant\ninterest.\n", "  We have conducted a study of extra-planar diffuse ionized gas using the first\nyear data from the MaNGA IFU survey. We have stacked spectra from 49 edge-on,\nlate-type galaxies as a function of distance from the midplane of the galaxy.\nWith this technique we can detect the bright emission lines Halpha, Hbeta,\n[OII]3726, 3729, [OIII]5007, [NII]6549, 6584, and [SII]6717, 6731 out to about\n4 kpc above the midplane. With 16 galaxies we can extend this analysis out to\nabout 9 kpc, i.e. a distance of ~2R_e, vertically from the midplane. In the\nhalo, the surface brightnesses of the [OII] and Halpha emission lines are\ncomparable, unlike in the disk where Halpha dominates. When we split the sample\nby specific star formation rate, concentration index, and stellar mass, each\nsubsample's emission line surface brightness profiles and ratios differ,\nindicating that extra-planar gas properties can vary. The emission line surface\nbrightnesses of the gas around high specific star formation rate galaxies are\nhigher at all distances, and the line ratios are closer to ratios\ncharacteristic of HII regions compared with low specific star formation rate\ngalaxies. The less concentrated and lower stellar mass samples exhibit line\nratios that are more like HII regions at larger distances than their more\nconcentrated and higher stellar mass counterparts. The largest difference\nbetween different subsamples occurs when the galaxies are split by stellar\nmass. We additionally infer that gas far from the midplane in more massive\ngalaxies has the highest temperatures and steepest radial temperature gradients\nbased on their [NII]/Halpha and [OII]/Halpha ratios between the disk and the\nhalo.\n", "  In [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{117}, 213201 (2016)] we have determined the\nangular resolved and the total energy spectrum of a positron produced via\nnonlinear Breit-Wheeler pair production by a high-energy photon\ncounterpropagating with respect to a tightly focused laser beam. Here, we first\ngeneralize the results in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{117}, 213201 (2016)] by\nincluding the possibility that the incoming photon is not exactly\ncounterpropagating with respect to the laser field. As main focus of the\npresent paper, we determine the photon angular resolved and total energy\nspectrum for the related process of nonlinear Compton scattering by an electron\nimpinging into a tightly-focused laser beam. Analytical integral expressions\nare obtained under the realistic assumption that the energy of the incoming\nelectron is the largest dynamical energy of the problem and that the electron\nis initially almost counterpropagating with respect to the laser field. The\ncrossing symmetry relation between the two processes in a tightly focused laser\nbeam is also elucidated.\n", "  Simultaneous measurements of air showers with the fluorescence and surface\ndetectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory allow a sensitive search for EeV\nphoton point sources. Several Galactic and extragalactic candidate objects are\ngrouped in classes to reduce the statistical penalty of many trials from that\nof a blind search and are analyzed for a significant excess above the\nbackground expectation. The presented search does not find any evidence for\nphoton emission at candidate sources, and combined $p$-values for every class\nare reported. Particle and energy flux upper limits are given for selected\ncandidate sources. These limits significantly constrain predictions of EeV\nproton emission models from non-transient Galactic and nearby extragalactic\nsources, as illustrated for the particular case of the Galactic center region.\n", "  We explore the influence of finite volume effects on baryon number\nfluctuations in a non-perturbative chiral model. In order to account for soft\nmodes, we use the functional renormalization group in a finite volume, using a\nsmooth regulator function in momentum space. We compare the results for a\nsmooth regulator with those for a sharp (or Litim) regulator, and show that in\na finite volume, the latter produces spurious artifacts. In a finite volume\nthere are only apparent critical points, about which we compute the ratio of\nthe fourth to the second order cumulant of quark number fluctuations. When the\nvolume is sufficiently small the system has two apparent critical points; as\nthe system size decreases, the location of the apparent critical point can move\nto higher temperature and lower chemical potential.\n", "  A cross section of the process $e^+e^- \\to \\pipi\\pipi$ has been measured\nusing 6798$\\pm$93 signal events from a data sample corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 9.8 pb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMD-3 detector in the\ncenter-of-mass energy range 920--1060 MeV. The measured cross section exhibits\nan interference pattern of the $\\phi(1020)\\to\\pipi\\pipi$ decay with a\nnon-resonant process $e^+e^- \\to \\pipi\\pipi$, from which we obtain the\nbranching fraction of the doubly suppressed decays (by G-parity and OZI rule):\n$\\BR(\\phi\\to\\pipi\\pipi) = (6.5\\pm2.7\\pm1.6)\\times 10^{-6}$.\n", "  Dynamical entities interacting with each other on complex networks often\nexhibit multistability. The stability of a desired steady regime (e.g., a\nsynchronized state) to large perturbations is critical in the operation of many\nreal-world networked dynamical systems such as ecosystems, power grids, the\nhuman brain, etc. This necessitates the development of appropriate quantifiers\nof stability of multiple stable states of such systems. Motivated by the\nconcept of basin stability (BS) (Menck et al., Nature Physics 9, 89 (2013)), we\npropose here the general framework of \\emph{multi-node basin stability} for\ngauging global stability and robustness of networked dynamical systems in\nresponse to non-local perturbations simultaneously affecting multiple nodes of\na system. The framework of multi-node BS provides an estimate of the critical\nnumber of nodes which when simultaneously perturbed, significantly reduces the\ncapacity of the system to return to the desired stable state. Further, this\nmethodology can be applied to estimate the minimum number of nodes of the\nnetwork to be controlled or safeguarded from external perturbations to ensure\nproper operation of the system. Multi-node BS can also be utilized for probing\nthe influence of spatially localised perturbations or targeted attacks to\nspecific parts of a network. We demonstrate the potential of multi-node BS in\nassessing the stability of the synchronized state in a deterministic scale-free\nnetwork of R\\\"{o}ssler oscillators and a conceptual model of the power grid of\nthe United Kingdom with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics.\n", "  In this letter we update our predictions for exclusive $J/\\Psi$ and\n$\\Upsilon$ photoproduction in proton-proton and nucleus - nucleus collisions at\nthe Run 2 LHC energies obtained with the color dipole formalism and considering\nthe impact parameter Color Glass Condensate model (bCGC) for the forward dipole\n- target scattering amplitude. A comparison with the LHCb data on rapidity\ndistributions and photon - hadron cross sections is presented. Our results\ndemonstrate that the current data can be quite well described by the bCGC\nmodel, which takes into account nonlinear effects in the QCD dynamics and\nreproduces the very precise HERA data, without introducing any additional\neffect or free parameter.\n", "  The detection and study of molecular gas in born-again stars would be of\ngreat importance to understand their composition and chemical evolution. In\naddition, the molecular emission would be an invaluable tool to explore the\nphysical conditions, kinematics and formation of asymmetric structures in the\ncircumstellar envelopes of these evolved stars. However, until now, all\nattempts to detect molecular emission from the cool material around born-again\nstars have failed. We carried out observations using the APEX and IRAM 30m\ntelescopes to search for molecular emission toward four well studied born-again\nstars, V4334 Sgr, V605 Aql, A30 and A78, that are thought to represent an\nevolutionary sequence. We detected for the first time emission from HCN and\nH$^{13}$CN molecules toward V4334 Sgr, and CO emission in V605 Aql. No\nmolecular emission was detected above the noise level toward A30 and A78. A\nfirst estimate of the H$^{12}$CN/H$^{13}$CN abundance ratio in the\ncircumstellar environment of V4334 Sgr is $\\approx$3, which is similar to the\nvalue of the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio measured from other observations. We\nderived a rotational temperature of $T_{\\rm rot}$=13$\\pm1$ K, and a total\ncolumn density of $N_{{\\rm HCN}}$=1.6$\\pm0.1\\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ for\nV4334 Sgr. This result sets a lower limit on the amount of hydrogen that was\nejected into the wind during the born-again event of this source. For V605 Aql,\nwe obtained a lower limit for the integrated line intensities $I_{^{12}\\rm\nC}$/$I_{^{13}\\rm C}$>4.\n", "  We present the results of a study of the stellar and accretion properties of\nthe (almost) complete sample of class II and transitional YSOs in the Lupus I,\nII, III and IV clouds, based on spectroscopic data acquired with the\nVLT/X-Shooter spectrograph. Our study combines the dataset from our previous\nwork with new observations of 55 additional objects. We have investigated 92\nYSO candidates in total, 11 of which have been definitely identified with giant\nstars unrelated to Lupus. The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona\nfide YSOs, which represent more than 90% of the whole class~II and transition\ndisc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously\nand self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and\nits relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to\nobservational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs. The\nlogMacc-logMstar correlation shows a statistically significant evidence of a\nbreak, with a steeper relation for Mstar<0.2Msun and a flatter slope for higher\nmasses. The bimodality of the Macc-Mstar relation is confirmed with four\ndifferent evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal\nbehaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling\nself-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other\nprocesses, such as photo evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's\nlifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on\nthe stellar mass. We also refined the empirical Lacc vs. Lline relationships.\n", "  We analyze the radial pressure profiles, the ICM clumping factor and the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) scaling relations of a sample of simulated galaxy\nclusters and groups identified in a set of hydrodynamical simulations based on\nan updated version of the TreePM-SPH GADGET-3 code. Three different sets of\nsimulations are performed: the first assumes non-radiative physics, the others\ninclude, among other processes, AGN and/or stellar feedback. Our results are\nanalyzed as a function of redshift, ICM physics, cluster mass and cluster\ncool-coreness or dynamical state. In general, the mean pressure profiles\nobtained for our sample of groups and clusters show a good agreement with X-ray\nand SZ observations. Simulated cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) clusters\nalso show a good match with real data. We obtain in all cases a small (if any)\nredshift evolution of the pressure profiles of massive clusters, at least back\nto z=1. We find that the clumpiness of gas density and pressure increases with\nthe distance from the cluster center and with the dynamical activity. The\ninclusion of AGN feedback in our simulations generates values for the gas\nclumping ($\\sqrt C_{\\rho}\\sim 1.2$ at $R_{200}$) in good agreement with recent\nobservational estimates. The simulated $Y_{SZ}-M$ scaling relations are in good\naccordance with several observed samples, especially for massive clusters. As\nfor the scatter of these relations, we obtain a clear dependence on the cluster\ndynamical state, whereas this distinction is not so evident when looking at the\nsubsamples of CC and NCC clusters.\n", "  The process of internal conversion from excited electronic states is\ninvestigated theoretically for the case of the vacuum-ultraviolet nuclear\ntransition of $^{229}{\\mathrm Th}$. Due to the very low transition energy, the\n$^{229}{\\mathrm Th}$ nucleus offers the unique possibility to open the\notherwise forbidden internal conversion nuclear decay channel for thorium ions\nvia optical laser excitation of the electronic shell. We show that this feature\ncan be exploited to investigate the isomeric state properties via observation\nof internal conversion from excited electronic configurations of ${\\mathrm\nTh}^+$ and ${\\mathrm Th}^{2+}$ ions. A possible experimental realization of the\nproposed scenario at the nuclear laser spectroscopy facility IGISOL in\nJyv\\\"askyl\\\"a, Finland is discussed.\n", "  We determine the viability of 4-layered Aurivillius phases to exhibit\nlong-range magnetic order above room temperature. We use Monte Carlo\nsimulations to calculate transition temperatures for an effective Heisenberg\nmodel containing a minimal set of required couplings. The magnitude of the\ncorresponding coupling constants has been determined previously from electronic\nstructure calculations for $\\mathrm{Bi_5FeTi_3O_{15}}$, for which we obtain a\ntransition temperature far below room temperature. We analyze the role of\nfurther neighbor interactions within our Heisenberg model, in particular that\nof the second-nearest-neighbor coupling within the perovskite-like layers of\nthe Aurivillius structure, as well as that of the weak inter-layer coupling, in\norder to identify the main bottleneck for achieving higher magnetic transition\ntemperatures. Based on our findings, we show that the most promising strategy\nto obtain magnetic order at higher temperatures is to increase the\nconcentration of magnetic cations within the perovskite-like layers, and we\npropose candidate compounds where magnetic order could be achieved above room\ntemperature.\n", "  We reported a detailed experimental study of the cold collision of Barium\nmonofluoride (BaF) with buffer gas and the high-resolution spectroscopy\nrelevant with direct laser cooling. BaF molecules are efficiently produced with\nlaser ablation and buffer-gas cooled in a cryogenic apparatus. The laser\ncooling relevant transition $|X^2\\Sigma, v=0, N=1\\rangle$ to $|A^2\\Pi, v'=0,\nJ'=1/2\\rangle$ is identified. The collision cross section with buffer gas is\nmeasured to be $1.4(7)\\times10^{-14} cm^{-2}$, which is very suitable for\nbuffer gas cooling. Both rotational and vibrational temperatures are\neffectively cooled, and large mount of molecules are quenched into the desired\nstates. Our study provides an important benchmark for further laser cooling of\nBaF molecule.\n", "  This paper contributes to the field of modeling and hindcasting of the total\nsolar irradiance (TSI) based on different proxy data that extend further back\nin time than the TSI that is measured from satellites.\n  We introduce a simple method to analyze persistent frequency-dependent\ncorrelations (FDCs) between the time series and use these correlations to\nhindcast missing historical TSI values. We try to avoid arbitrary choices of\nthe free parameters of the model by computing them using an optimization\nprocedure. The method can be regarded as a general tool for pairs of data sets,\nwhere correlating and anticorrelating components can be separated into\nnon-overlapping regions in frequency domain.\n  Our method is based on low-pass and band-pass filtering with a Gaussian\ntransfer function combined with de-trending and computation of envelope curves.\n  We find a major controversy between the historical proxies and\nsatellite-measured targets: a large variance is detected between the\nlow-frequency parts of targets, while the low-frequency proxy behavior of\ndifferent measurement series is consistent with high precision. We also show\nthat even though the rotational signal is not strongly manifested in the\ntargets and proxies, it becomes clearly visible in FDC spectrum.\n  The application of the new method to solar data allows us to obtain important\ninsights into the different TSI modeling procedures and their capabilities for\nhindcasting based on the directly observed time intervals.\n", "  The phase diagram of strong interaction matter is analyzed utilizing the\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Special emphasis is placed on its dependence on an\nexternal magnetic field and isospin chemical potential. Using flavor mixing\ninduced by instanton effects the influence of isospin breaking due to the\nmagnetic field and the isospin chemical potential is compared. It is found that\nat low temperatures and large quark chemical potential the magnetic field,\ndepending on its strength, induces a new critical endpoint or a triple point.\n", "  We present optical observations of SN 2013dx, related to the Fermi burst GRB\n130702A occurred at a redshift z = 0.145. It is the second-best sampled GRB-SN\nafter SN~1998bw: the observational light curves contain more than 280 data\npoints in uBgrRiz filters until 88 day after the burst, and the data were\ncollected from our observational collaboration (Maidanak Observatory,\nAbastumani Observatory, Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, Mondy Observatory,\nNational Observatory of Turkey, Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos) and\nfrom the literature. We model numerically the multicolour light curves using\nthe one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical code STELLA, previously widely\nimplemented for the modelling of typical non-GRB SNe. The best-fitted model has\nthe following parameters: pre-supernova star mass M = 25 M_Sun, mass of a\ncompact remnant M_CR = 6 M_Sun, total energy of the outburst E_oburst = 3.5 x\n10^(52) erg, pre-supernova star radius R = 100 R_Sun, M_56Ni = 0.2 M_Sun which\nis totally mixed through the ejecta; M_O = 16.6 M_Sun, M_Si = 1.2 M_Sun, and\nM_Fe = 1.2 M_Sun, and the radiative efficiency of the SN is 0.1 per cent.\n", "  We consider the thermodynamic potential $\\Omega$ of an N component Fermi gas\nwith a short range interaction obeying SU(N) symmetry. We analyze especially\nthe part of $\\Omega$ that depends on the temperature T non-analytically for\nsmall T . We examine the temperature range where one can observe this $T^4 ln\nT$ contribution and discuss how it can be extracted experimentally.\n", "  The 2015 Planck data release tightened the region of the allowed inflationary\nmodels. Inflationary models with convex potentials have now been ruled out\nsince they produce a large tensor to scalar ratio. Meanwhile the same data\noffers interesting hints on possible deviations from the standard picture of\nCMB perturbations. Here we revisit the predictions of the theory of the origin\nof the universe from the landscape multiverse for the case of exponential\ninflation, for two reasons: firstly to check the status of the anomalies\nassociated with this theory, in the light of the recent Planck data; secondly,\nto search for a counterexample whereby new physics modifications may bring\nconvex inflationary potentials, thought to have been ruled out, back into the\nregion of potentials allowed by data. Using the exponential inflation as an\nexample of convex potentials, we find that the answer to both tests is\npositive: modifications to the perturbation spectrum and to the Newtonian\npotential of the universe originating from the quantum entanglement, bring the\nexponential potential, back within the allowed region of current data; and, the\nseries of anomalies previously predicted in this theory, is still in good\nagreement with current data. Hence our finding for this convex potential comes\nat the price of allowing for additional thermal relic particles, equivalently\ndark radiation, in the early universe.\n", "  We study single-particle potential of hyperons in nuclear medium starting\nfrom QCD. First we carry out lattice QCD numerical simulation to extract\nbaryon-baryon interactions from QCD by means of the HAL QCD method. We employ a\nfull QCD gauge configuration ensemble at almost physical point so that hadron\nmasses are nearly physical, e.g. pion mass is 146 MeV, kaon mass is 525 MeV,\nand nucleon mass is 956 MeV. Then, with some simplifications, we apply the\nobtained hyperon interactions to the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory and\ncalculate single-particle potential of hyperons in nuclear medium\n$U_{Y}(\\rho,k)$. For the symmetric nuclear matter at the normal nuclear matter\ndensity, we obtain $U_{\\Lambda}(\\rho_0,0)=-33$ MeV, $U_{\\Sigma}(\\rho_0,0)=+11$\nMeV, and $U_{\\Xi}(\\rho_0,0)=-6$ MeV. These results are qualitatively compatible\nwith values suggested from experiments. This success is remarkable and\nencouraging because we are trying to reveal nature of baryon-baryon\ninteractions starting from QCD, and this agreement proves that our approach is\nessentially correct.\n", "  Optical tracking in vivo experiments reveal that diffusion of particles in\nbiological cells is strongly enhanced in the presence of ATP and the\nexperimental data for animal cells could previously be reproduced within a\nphenomenological model of a gel with myosin motors acting within it [EPL 110,\n48005 (2015)]. Here, the two-fluid model of a gel is considered where active\nmacromolecules, described as force dipoles, cyclically operate both in the\nelastic and the fluid components. Through coarse-graining, effective equations\nof motions for tracer particles displaying local deformations and local fluid\nflows are derived. The equation for deformation tracers coincides with the\nearlier phenomenological model and thus confirms it. For flow tracers,\ndiffusion enhancement caused by active force dipoles in the fluid component,\nand thus due to metabolic activity, is found. The latter effect may explain why\nATP-dependent diffusion enhancement could also be observed in bacteria that\nlack molecular motors in their skeleton or when the activity of myosin motors\nwas chemically inhibited.\n", "  We report on spin- and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy using a\nhigh-resolution imaging spin filter based on a large Ir(001) crystal enhancing\nthe effective figure of merit for spin detection by a factor of over $10^3$\ncompared to standard single channel detectors. Furthermore, we review the spin\nfilter preparation, and its lifetime. The spin filter efficiency is mapped on a\nbroad range of scattering energies and azimuthal angles. Large spin filter\nefficiencies are observed for the spin component perpendicular as well as\nparallel to the scattering plane depending on the azimuthal orientation of the\nspin filter crystal. A spin rotator capable of manipulating the spin direction\nprior to detection complements the measurement of three observables, thus\nallowing for a derivation of all three components of the spin polarization\nvector in multichannel spin polarimetry. The experimental results nicely agree\nwith spin-polarized low energy electron diffraction calculations based on a\nfully relativistic multiple scattering method in the framework of\nspin-polarized density functional theory.\n", "  We develop a theory of magnetoresistance of two-dimensional electron systems\nin a smooth disorder potential in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theory applies\nto two-dimensional semiconductor structures with strongly correlated carriers\nwhen the mean free path due to electron-electron collisions is sufficiently\nshort. The dominant contribution to magnetoresistance arises from the\nmodification of the flow pattern by the Lorentz force, rather than the magnetic\nfield dependence of the kinetic coefficients of the electron liquid. The\nresulting magnetoresistance is positive and quadratic at weak fields. Although\nthe resistivity is governed by both viscosity and thermal conductivity of the\nelectron fluid, the magnetoresistance is controlled by the viscosity only. This\nenables extraction of viscosity of the electron liquid from magnetotransport\nmeasurements.\n", "  Late M-type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood include a mixture of very\nlow-mass stars and brown dwarfs which is difficult to disentangle due to the\nlack of constraints on their age such as trigonometric parallax, lithium\ndetection and space velocity.\n  We search for young brown dwarf candidates among a sample of 28 nearby late-M\ndwarfs with spectral types between M5.0 and M9.0, and we also search for debris\ndisks around three of them.\n  Based on theoretical models, we used the color $I-J$, the $J$-band absolute\nmagnitude and the detection of the Li I 6708 $\\AA$ doublet line as a strong\nconstraint to estimate masses and ages of our targets. For the search of debris\ndisks, we observed three targets at submillimeter wavelength of 850 $\\mu$m.\n  We report here the first clear detections of lithium absorption in four\ntargets and a marginal detection in one target. Our mass estimates indicate\nthat two of them are young brown dwarfs, two are young brown dwarf candidates\nand one is a young very low-mass star. The closest young field brown dwarf in\nour sample at only $\\sim$15 pc is an excellent benchmark for further studying\nphysical properties of brown dwarfs in the range 100$-$150 Myr. We did not\ndetect any debris disks around three late-M dwarfs, and we estimated upper\nlimits to the dust mass of debris disks around them.\n", "  The investigation of the diffusive transport of charged particles in a\nturbulent magnetic field remains a subject of considerable interest. Research\nhas most frequently concentrated on determining the diffusion coefficient in\nthe presence of a mean magnetic field. Here we consider diffusion of charged\nparticles in fully three-dimensional isotropic turbulent magnetic fields with\nno mean field, which may be pertinent to many astrophysical situations. We\nidentify different ranges of particle energy depending upon the ratio of the\nLarmor radius of the charged particle to the characteristic outer length scale\nof the turbulence. Two different theoretical models are proposed to calculate\nthe diffusion coefficient, each applicable to a distinct range of particle\nenergies. The theoretical results are compared with those from computer\nsimulations, showing good agreement.\n", "  We study the shadows of the fully non-linear, asymptotically flat\nEinstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) black holes (BHs), for both static and\nrotating solutions. We find that, in all cases, these shadows are smaller than\nfor comparable Kerr BHs, i.e. with the same total mass and angular momentum\nunder similar observation conditions. In order to compare both cases we provide\nquantitative shadow parameters, observing in particular that the differences in\nthe shadows mean radii are never larger than the percent level. Therefore,\ngenerically, EdGB BHs cannot be excluded by (near future) shadow observations\nalone. On the theoretical side, we find no clear signature of some exotic\nfeatures of EdGB BHs on the corresponding shadows, such as the regions of\nnegative (Komar, say) energy density outside the horizon. We speculate that\nthis is due to the fact that the Komar energy interior to the light rings (or\nmore precisely, the surfaces of constant radial coordinate that intersect the\nlight rings in the equatorial plane) is always smaller than the ADM mass, and\nconsequently the corresponding shadows are smaller than those of comparable\nKerr BHs. The analysis herein provides a clear example that it is the light\nring impact parameter, rather than its \"size\", that determines a BH shadow.\n", "  Aims. We aim to systematically study the properties of the different\ntransitions of the dense molecular gas tracer HC3N in galaxies. Methods. We\nhave conducted single-dish observations of HC3N emission lines towards a sample\nof nearby gas-rich galaxies. HC3N(J=2-1) was observed in 20 galaxies with\nEffelsberg 100-m telescope. HC3N(J=24-23) was observed in nine galaxies with\nthe 10-m Submillimeter Telescope (SMT). Results. HC3 N 2-1 is detected in three\ngalaxies: IC 342, M 66 and NGC 660 (> 3 {\\sigma}). HC3 N 24-23 is detected in\nthree galaxies: IC 342, NGC 1068 and IC 694. This is the first measurements of\nHC3N 2-1 in a relatively large sample of external galaxies, although the\ndetection rate is low. For the HC3 N 2-1 non-detections, upper limits (2\n{\\sigma}) are derived for each galaxy, and stacking the non-detections is\nattempted to recover the weak signal of HC3N. But the stacked spectrum does not\nshow any significant signs of HC3N 2-1 emission. The results are also compared\nwith other transitions of HC3N observed in galaxies. Conclusions. The low\ndetection rate of both transitions suggests low abundance of HC3N in galaxies,\nwhich is consistent with other observational studies. The comparison between\nHC3N and HCN or HCO+shows a large diversity in the ratios between HC3N and HCN\nor HCO+. More observations are needed to interpret the behavior of HC3N in\ndifferent types of galaxies.\n", "  CD Ind is one of only four confirmed asynchronous polars (APs). APs are\nstrongly magnetic cataclysmic variables of the AM Herculis subclass with the\ncharacteristic that their white dwarfs rotate a few per cent out of synchronism\nwith their binary orbit. Theory suggests that nova eruptions disrupt previously\nsynchronized states. Following the eruption, the system is expected to rapidly\nresynchronize over a timescale of centuries. The other three asynchronous\npolars - V1432 Aql, BY Cam and V1500 Cyg - have resynchronization time\nestimates ranging from 100 to more than 3500 years, with all but one being less\nthan 1200 years. We report on the analysis of over 46000 observations of CD Ind\ntaken between 2007 and 2016, combined with previous observations from 1996, and\nestimate a CD Ind resynchronization time of 6400 +/- 800 years. We also\nestimate an orbital period of 110.820(1) minutes and a current (2016.4) white\ndwarf spin period of 109.6564(1) minutes.\n", "  An algorithm is described that can generate random variants of a time series\nor image while preserving the probability distribution of original values and\nthe pointwise Holder regularity. Thus, it preserves the multifractal properties\nof the data. Our algorithm is similar in principle to well-known algorithms\nbased on the preservation of the Fourier amplitude spectrum and original values\nof a time series. However, it is underpinned by a dual-tree complex wavelet\ntransform rather than a Fourier transform. Our method, which we term the\nIterated Amplitude Adjusted Wavelet Transform (IAAWT) method can be used to\ngenerate bootstrapped versions of multifractal data and, because it preserves\nthe pointwise Holder regularity but not the local Holder regularity, it can be\nused to test hypotheses concerning the presence of oscillating singularities in\na time series, an important feature of turbulence and econophysics data.\nBecause the locations of the data values are randomized with respect to the\nmultifractal structure, hypotheses about their mutual coupling can be tested,\nwhich is important for the velocity-intermittency structure of turbulence and\nself-regulating processes.\n", "  Deep optical photometric data on the NGC 7538 region were collected and\ncombined with archival data sets from $Chandra$, 2MASS and {\\it Spitzer}\nsurveys in order to generate a new catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs)\nincluding those not showing IR excess emission. This new catalog is complete\ndown to 0.8 M$_\\odot$. The nature of the YSOs associated with the NGC 7538\nregion and their spatial distribution are used to study the star formation\nprocess and the resultant mass function (MF) in the region. Out of the 419\nYSOs, $\\sim$91\\% have ages between 0.1 to 2.5 Myr and $\\sim$86\\% have masses\nbetween 0.5 to 3.5 M$_\\odot$, as derived by spectral energy distribution\nfitting analysis. Around 24\\%, 62\\% and 2\\% of these YSOs are classified to be\nthe Class I, Class II and Class III sources, respectively. The X-ray activity\nin the Class I, Class II and Class III objects is not significantly different\nfrom each other. This result implies that the enhanced X-ray surface flux due\nto the increase in the rotation rate may be compensated by the decrease in the\nstellar surface area during the pre-main sequence evolution. Our analysis shows\nthat the O3V type high mass star `IRS 6' might have triggered the formation of\nyoung low mass stars up to a radial distance of 3 pc. The MF shows a turn-off\nat around 1.5 M$_\\odot$ and the value of its slope `$\\Gamma$' in the mass range\n$1.5 <$M/M$_\\odot < 6$ comes out to be $-1.76\\pm0.24$, which is steeper than\nthe Salpeter value.\n", "  Context: Ser X-1 is a well studied LMXB which clearly shows a broad iron\nline. Recently, Miller et al. (2103) have presented broad-band, high quality\nNuSTAR data of SerX-1.Using relativistically smeared self-consistent reflection\nmodels, they find a value of R_in close to 1.0 R_ISCO (corresponding to 6 R_g),\nand a low inclination angle, less than 10 deg. Aims: The aim of this paper is\nto probe to what extent the choice of reflection and continuum models (and\nuncertainties therein) can affect the conclusions about the disk parameters\ninferred from the reflection component. To this aim we re-analyze all the\navailable public NuSTAR and XMM-Newton. Ser X-1 is a well studied source, its\nspectrum has been observed by several instruments, and is therefore one of the\nbest sources for this study. Methods: We use slightly different continuum and\nreflection models with respect to those adopted in literature for this source.\nIn particular we fit the iron line and other reflection features with\nself-consistent reflection models as reflionx (with a power-law illuminating\ncontinuum modified with a high energy cutoff to mimic the shape of the incident\nComptonization spectrum) and rfxconv. With these models we fit NuSTAR and\nXMM-Newton spectra yielding consistent spectral results. Results: Our results\nare in line with those already found by Miller et al. (2013) but less extreme.\nIn particular, we find the inner disk radius at about 13 R_g and an inclination\nangle with respect to the line of sight of about 27 deg. We conclude that,\nwhile the choice of the reflection model has little impact on the disk\nparameters, as soon as a self-consistent model is used, the choice of the\ncontinuum model can be important in the precise determination of the disk\nparameters from the reflection component. Hence broad-band X-ray spectra are\nhighly preferable to constrain the continuum and disk parameters.\n", "  We propose a three-loop neutrino mass model with a few leptoquark scalars in\n$SU(2)_L$-triplet form, through which we can explain the anomaly of $B \\to\nK^{(*)} \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, a sizable muon $g-2$ and a bosonic dark matter candidate,\nand at the same time satisfying all the constraints from lepton flavor\nviolations. We perform global numerical analyses and show the allowed regions,\nin which we find somewhat restricted parameter space, such as the mass of dark\nmatter candidate and various components of the Yukawa couplings in the model.\n", "  Strong magnetization in accretion discs could resolve a number of outstanding\nissues related to stability and state transitions in low-mass X-ray binaries.\nHowever, it is unclear how real discs become strongly magnetized and, even if\nthey do, whether they can remain in such a state. In this paper, we address the\nlatter issue through a pair of global disc simulations. Here, we only consider\ncases of initially purely toroidal magnetic fields contained entirely within a\ncompact torus. We find that, over only a few tens of orbital periods, the\nmagnetization of an initially strongly magnetized disc,\n$P_\\mathrm{mag}/P_\\mathrm{gas} \\ge 10$, drops to $\\lesssim 0.1$, similar to the\nsteady-state value reached in initially weakly magnetized discs. This is\nconsistent with recent shearing box simulations with initially strong toroidal\nfields, the robust conclusion being that strongly magnetized toroidal fields\ncan not be locally self-sustaining. These results appear to leave net poloidal\nflux or extended radial fields as the only avenues for establishing strongly\nmagnetized discs, ruling out the thermal collapse scenario.\n", "  We explore freezing dark energy, where the evolution of the field approaches\nthat of a cosmological constant at late times. We propose two general, two\nparameter forms to describe the class of freezing field models, in analogy to\nones for thawing fields, here based on the physics of the flow parameter or the\ncalibrated $w$-$w'$ phase space. Observables such as distances and Hubble\nparameters are fit to within 0.1%, and the dark energy equation of state\ngenerally to within better than 1%, of the exact numerical solutions.\n", "  If fast radio bursts (FRBs) originate from galaxies at cosmological\ndistances, then their all-sky rate implies that the Milky Way may host an FRB\non average once every 30-1500 years. If FRBs repeat for decades or centuies, a\nlocal FRB could be active now. A typical Galactic FRB would produce a\nmillisecond radio pulse with ~1 GHz flux density of ~3E10 Jy, comparable to the\nradio flux levels and frequencies of cellular communication devices (cell\nphones, Wi-Fi, GPS). We propose to search for Galactic FRBs using a global\narray of low-cost radio receivers. One possibility is to use the ~1GHz\ncommunication channel in cellular phones through a Citizens-Science\ndownloadable application. Participating phones would continuously listen for\nand record candidate FRBs and would periodically upload information to a\ncentral data processing website, which correlates the incoming data from all\nparticipants, to identify the signature of a real, globe-encompassing, FRB from\nan astronomical distance. Triangulation of the GPS-based pulse arrival times\nreported from different locations will provide the FRB sky position,\npotentially to arc-second accuracy. Pulse arrival times from phones operating\nat diverse frequencies, or from an on-device de-dispersion search, will yield\nthe dispersion measure (DM) which will indicate the FRB source distance within\nthe Galaxy. A variant of this approach would be to use the built-in ~100 MHz\nFM-radio receivers present in cell phones for an FRB search at lower\nfrequencies. Alternatively, numerous \"software-defined radio\" (SDR) devices,\ncosting ~$10 US each, could be plugged into USB ports of personal computers\naround the world (particularly in radio quiet regions) to establish the global\nnetwork of receivers.\n", "  The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the closest star forming galaxy with low\nmetallicity, provides an ideal laboratory to study star formation in such an\nenvironment. The classical dense molecular gas thermometer NH3 is rarely\navailable in a low metallicity environment because of photoionization and a\nlack of nitrogen atoms. Our goal is to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature with formaldehyde toward six star-forming regions in the LMC. Three\nrotational transitions of para-H2CO near 218 GHz were observed with the APEX\n12m telescope toward six star forming regions in the LMC. Those data are\ncomplemented by C18O 2-1 spectra. Using non-LTE modeling with RADEX, we derive\nthe gas kinetic temperature and spatial density, using as constraints the\nmeasured para-H2CO 321-220/303-202 and para-H2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 ratios.\nExcluding the quiescent cloud N159S, where only one para-H2CO line could be\ndetected, the gas kinetic temperatures derived from the preferred para-H2CO\n321-220/303-202 line ratios range from 35 to 63 K with an average of 47 K.\nSpatial densities of the gas derived from the paraH2CO 303-202/C18O 2-1 line\nratios yield 0.4-2.9x10^5 cm^-3 with an average of 1.5x10^5 cm^-3. Temperatures\nderived from the para-H2CO line ratio are similar to those obtained with the\nsame method from Galactic star forming regions and agree with results derived\nfrom CO in the dense regions of the LMC. A comparison of kinetic temperatures\nderived from para-H2CO with those from the dust also shows good agreement. This\nsuggests that the dust and para-H2CO are well mixed in the studied star forming\nregions. A correlation between the gas kinetic temperatures derived from\npara-H2CO and infrared luminosity, represented by the 250um flux, suggests that\nthe kinetic temperatures traced by para-H2CO are correlated with the ongoing\nmassive star formation in the LMC.\n", "  Using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 3.0 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of 7\nand 8 TeV, the $B_{c}^{+} \\rightarrow D^{0} K^{+}$ decay is observed with a\nstatistical significance of 5.1 standard deviations.\n  By normalising to $B^{+} \\rightarrow \\bar{D}^{0} \\pi^{+}$ decays, a\nmeasurement of the branching fraction multiplied by the production rates for\n$B_{c}^{+}$ relative to $B^{+}$ mesons in the LHCb acceptance is obtained, $$\nR_{D^{0} K} = \\frac{f_{c}}{f_{u}}\\times\\mathcal{B}(B_{c}^{+} \\rightarrow D^{0}\nK^{+}) = (9.3\\,^{+2.8}_{-2.5} \\pm 0.6) \\times 10^{-7}\\,, $$ where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. This decay is expected\nto proceed predominantly through weak annihilation and penguin amplitudes, and\nis the first $B_{c}^{+}$ decay of this nature to be observed.\n", "  In this work, we focus on stub resonators embedded in plasmonic slot\nwaveguides. The resonators have potential applications in optical interconnects\nand sensors. We fabricate the samples by electron beam lithography and\nlift-off. We use a scattering matrix based model to quantify the optical power\noutput from the samples. We measure the properties of the resonators by\ncoupling light in and out of the slot waveguides by optical antennas, making\nuse of a cross-polarization based setup utilizing a supercontinuum source and a\nhigh numerical aperture objective lens operating in the telecom-wavelength\nrange. Our model agrees well with the measured data. Further development on the\nstub resonators can be made by using the methods in this paper.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks are believed to evolve on Myr timescales in a diffusive\n(viscous) manner as a result of angular momentum transport driven by internal\nstresses. Here we use a sample of 26 protoplanetary disks resolved by ALMA with\nmeasured (dust-based) masses and stellar accretion rates to derive the\ndimensionless $\\alpha$-viscosity values for individual objects, with the goal\nof constraining the angular momentum transport mechanism. We find that the\ninferred values of $\\alpha$ do not cluster around a single value, but instead\nhave a broad distribution extending from $10^{-4}$ to $0.04$. Moreover, they\ncorrelate with neither the global disk parameters (mass, size, surface density)\nnor the stellar characteristics (mass, luminosity, radius). However, we do find\na strong linear correlation between $\\alpha$ and the central mass accretion\nrate $\\dot M$. This correlation is unlikely to result from the direct physical\neffect of $\\dot M$ on disk viscosity on global scales. Instead, we suggest that\nit is caused by the decoupling of stellar $\\dot M$ from the global disk\ncharacteristics in one of the following ways. (1) The behavior (and range) of\n$\\alpha$ is controlled by a yet unidentified parameter (e.g. ionization\nfraction, magnetic field strength, or geometry), ultimately driving the\nvariation of $\\dot M$. (2) The central $\\dot M$ is decoupled from the global\nviscous mass accretion rate as a result of an instability or mass accumulation\n(or loss) in the inner disk. (3) Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is\nthat angular momentum in protoplanetary disks is transported non-viscously,\ne.g. via magnetohydrodynamic winds or spiral density waves.\n", "  Context: In a series of papers, we study the major merger of two disk\ngalaxies in order to establish whether or not such a merger can produce a disc\ngalaxy. Aims: Our aim here is to describe in detail the technical aspects of\nour numerical experiments. Methods: We discuss the initial conditions of our\nmajor merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show\nthat such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass\nconcentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a\nsolution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at\neach time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a\ngiven threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value. We also\ncompare the GADGET3 and GIZMO codes, by applying both of them to the same\ninitial conditions. Results: We show that the evolution of isolated\nprotogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our\nprotogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that\nthe problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger\nsimulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution. We show that\nour AGN-like feedback removes this non-physical central mass concentration, and\nthus allows the formation of realistic bars. Note that our AGN-like feedback\nmainly affects the central region of a model, without significantly modifying\nthe rest of the galaxy. We demonstrate that, in the context of our kind of\nsimulation, GADGET3 gives results which are very similar to those obtained with\nthe PSPH (density independent SPH) flavor of GIZMO. Moreover, in the examples\nwe tried, the differences between the results of the two flavors of GIZMO,\nnamely PSPH, and MFM (mesh-less algorithm) are similar to and, in some\ncomparisons, larger than the differences between the results of GADGET3 and\nPSPH.\n", "  The synchronized magnetization dynamics in ferromagnets on a nonmagnetic\nheavy metal caused by the spin Hall effect is investigated theoretically. The\ndirect and inverse spin Hall effects near the ferromagnetic/nonmagnetic\ninterface generate longitudinal and transverse electric currents. The\nphenomenon is known as the spin Hall magnetoresistance effect, whose magnitude\ndepends on the magnetization direction in the ferromagnet due to the spin\ntransfer effect. When another ferromagnet is placed onto the same nonmagnet,\nthese currents are again converted to the spin current by the spin Hall effect\nand excite the spin torque to this additional ferromagnet, resulting in the\nexcitation of the coupled motions of the magnetizations. The in-phase or\nantiphase synchronization of the magnetization oscillations, depending on the\nvalue of the Gilbert damping constant and the field-like torque strength, is\nfound in the transverse geometry by solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation numerically. On the other hand, in addition to these synchronizations,\nthe synchronization having a phase difference of a quarter of a period is also\nfound in the longitudinal geometry. The analytical theory clarifying the\nrelation among the current, frequency, and phase difference is also developed,\nwhere it is shown that the phase differences observed in the numerical\nsimulations correspond to that giving the fixed points of the energy supplied\nby the coupling torque.\n", "  High-dimensional entanglement offers promising perspectives in quantum\ninformation science. In practice, however, the main challenge is to devise\nefficient methods to characterize high-dimensional entanglement, based on the\navailable experimental data which is usually rather limited. Here we report the\ncharacterization and certification of high-dimensional entanglement in photon\npairs, encoded in temporal modes. Building upon recently developed theoretical\nmethods, we certify an entanglement of formation of 2.09(7) ebits in a time-bin\nimplementation, and 4.1(1) ebits in an energy-time implementation. These\nresults are based on very limited sets of local measurements, which illustrates\nthe practical relevance of these methods.\n", "  The strong coupling limit of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) implies the\ncapability of a matter-like quantum system to coherently transform an\nindividual excitation into a single photon within a resonant structure. This\nnot only enables essential processes required for quantum information\nprocessing but also allows for fundamental studies of matter-light interaction.\nIn this work we demonstrate strong coupling between the charge degree of\nfreedom in a gate-detuned GaAs double quantum dot (DQD) and a frequency-tunable\nhigh impedance resonator realized using an array of superconducting quantum\ninterference devices (SQUIDs). In the resonant regime, we resolve the vacuum\nRabi mode splitting of size $2g/2\\pi = 238$ MHz at a resonator linewidth\n$\\kappa/2\\pi = 12$ MHz and a DQD charge qubit dephasing rate of $\\gamma_2/2\\pi\n= 80$ MHz extracted independently from microwave spectroscopy in the dispersive\nregime. Our measurements indicate a viable path towards using circuit based\ncavity QED for quantum information processing in semiconductor nano-structures.\n", "  We derive the diagram of the topological phases accessible within a generic\nHamiltonian describing quantum anomalous Hall effect for photons and electrons\nin honeycomb lattices in presence of a Zeeman field and Spin-Orbit Coupling\n(SOC). The two cases differ crucially by the winding number of their SOC, which\nis 1 for the Rashba SOC of electrons, and 2 for the photon SOC induced by the\nenergy splitting between the TE and TM modes. As a consequence, the two models\nexhibit opposite Chern numbers $\\pm 2$ at low field. Moreover, the photonic\nsystem shows a topological transition absent in the electronic case. If the\nphotonic states are mixed with excitonic resonances to form interacting\nexciton-polaritons, the effective Zeeman field can be induced and controlled by\na circularly polarized pump. This new feature allows an all-optical control of\nthe topological phase transitions.\n", "  The performance of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is\nstrongly influenced by the choice of the local basis of the underlying physical\nlattice. We demonstrate that, for the two-dimensional Hubbard model, the hybrid\nreal-momentum space formulation of the DMRG is computationally more efficient\nthan the standard real-space formulation. In particular, we show that the\ncomputational cost for fixed bond dimension of the hybrid-space DMRG is\napproximately independent of the width of the lattice, in contrast to the\nreal-space DMRG, for which it is proportional to the width squared. We apply\nthe hybrid-space algorithm to calculate the ground state of the doped\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model on cylinders of width four and six sites; at\n$n=0.875$ filling, the ground state exhibits a striped charge-density\ndistribution with a wavelength of eight sites for both $U/t=4.0$ and $U/t=8.0$.\nWe find that the strength of the charge ordering depends on $U/t$ and on the\nboundary conditions.Furthermore, we investigate the magnetic ordering as well\nas the decay of the static spin, charge, and pair-field correlation functions.\n", "  Hadronic form factors for semileptonic decay of the $\\Lambda_c$ are\ncalculated in a nonrelativistic quark model. The full quark model wave\nfunctions are employed to numerically calculate the form factors to all\nrelevant orders in ($1/m_c$, $1/m_s$). The form factors obtained satisfy\nrelationships expected from the heavy quark effective theory (HQET). The\ndifferential decay rates and branching fractions are calculated for transitions\nto the ground state and a number of excited states of $\\Lambda$. The branching\nfraction of the semileptonic decay width to the total width of $\\Lambda_c$ has\nbeen calculated and compared with other theoretical estimates and experimental\nresults. The branching fractions for $\\Lambda_c\\to\\Lambda^{*}\nl^{+}\\nu_l\\to\\Sigma\\pi l^{+}\\nu_l$ and $\\Lambda_c\\to\\Lambda^{*} l^{+}\\nu_l\\to\nN\\bar{K} l^{+}\\nu_l$ are also calculated. Apart from decays to the ground state\n$\\Lambda$(1115), it is found that decays through the $\\Lambda(1405)$ provide a\nsignificant portion of the branching fraction $\\Lambda_c\\to X_s l\\nu_l$. A new\nestimate for $f=B(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to\\Lambda l^{+}\\nu_l)/B(\\Lambda_c^{+}\\to X_s\nl^{+}\\nu_l)$ is obtained.\n", "  This paper derives an upper limit on the density $\\rho_{\\scriptstyle\\Lambda}$\nof dark energy based on the requirement that cosmological structure forms\nbefore being frozen out by the eventual acceleration of the universe. By\nallowing for variations in both the cosmological parameters and the strength of\ngravity, the resulting constraint is a generalization of previous limits. The\nspecific parameters under consideration include the amplitude $Q$ of the\nprimordial density fluctuations, the Planck mass $M_{\\rm pl}$, the\nbaryon-to-photon ratio $\\eta$, and the density ratio $\\Omega_M/\\Omega_b$. In\naddition to structure formation, we use considerations from stellar structure\nand Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) to constrain these quantities. The resulting\nupper limit on the dimensionless density of dark energy becomes\n$\\rho_{\\scriptstyle\\Lambda}/M_{\\rm pl}^4<10^{-90}$, which is $\\sim30$ orders of\nmagnitude larger than the value in our universe\n$\\rho_{\\scriptstyle\\Lambda}/M_{\\rm pl}^4\\sim10^{-120}$. This new limit is much\nless restrictive than previous constraints because additional parameters are\nallowed to vary. With these generalizations, a much wider range of universes\ncan develop cosmic structure and support observers. To constrain the\nconstituent parameters, new BBN calculations are carried out in the regime\nwhere $\\eta$ and $G=M_{\\rm pl}^{-2}$ are much larger than in our universe. If\nthe BBN epoch were to process all of the protons into heavier elements, no\nhydrogen would be left behind to make water, and the universe would not be\nviable. However, our results show that some hydrogen is always left over, even\nunder conditions of extremely large $\\eta$ and $G$, so that a wide range of\nalternate universes are potentially habitable.\n", "  We report results of a spectroscopic campaign carried out at the 10 m Gran\nTelescopio Canarias for a sample of 22 BL Lac objects detected (or candidates)\nat TeV energies, aimed to determine or constrain their redshift. This is of\nfundamental importance for the interpretation of their emission models, for\npopulation studies and also mandatory to study the interaction of high energy\nphotons with the extragalactic background light using TeV sources. High\nsignal-to-noise optical spectra in the range 4250 - 10000 {\\AA} were obtained\nto search for faint emission and/or absorption lines from both the host galaxy\nor the nucleus. We determine a new redshift for PKS 1424+240 (z = 0.604) and a\ntentative one for 1ES 0033+595 (z = 0.467). We are able to set new\nspectroscopic redshift lower limits for other three sources on the basis of Mg\nII and Ca II intervening absorption features: BZB J1243+3627 (z > 0.483), BZB\nJ1540+8155 (z > 0.672), and BZB 0J2323+4210 (z > 0.267). We confirm previous\nredshift estimates for four blazars: S3 0218+357 (z = 0.944), 1ES 1215+303 (z =\n0.129), W Comae (z = 0.102), and MS 1221.8+2452 (z = 0.218). For the remaining\ntargets, in seven cases (S2 0109+22, 3C 66A, VER J0521+211, S4 0954+65, BZB\nJ1120+4214, S3 1227+25, BZB J2323+4210), we do not validate the proposed\nredshift. Finally for all sources of still unknown redshift, we set a lower\nlimit based on the minimum equivalent width of absorption features expected\nfrom the host galaxy.\n", "  Testing quantum theory on macroscopic scales is a longstanding challenge that\nmight help to revolutionise physics. For example, laboratory tests (such as\nthose anticipated in nanomechanical or biological systems) may look to rule out\nmacroscopic realism: the idea that the properties of macroscopic objects exist\nobjectively and can be non-invasively measured. Such investigations are likely\nto suffer from i) stringent experimental requirements, ii) marginal statistical\nsignificance and iii) logical loopholes. We address all of these problems by\nrefining two tests of macroscopic realism, or `quantum witnesses', and\nimplementing them in a microscopic test on a photonic qubit and qutrit. The\nfirst witness heralds the invasiveness of a blind measurement; its maximum\nviolation has been shown to grow with the dimensionality of the system under\nstudy. The second witness heralds the invasiveness of a generic quantum\noperation, and can achieve its maximum violation in any dimension -- it\ntherefore allows for the highest quantum signal-to-noise ratio and most\nsignificant refutation of the classical point of view.\n", "  For stationary, homogeneous Markov processes (viz., L\\'{e}vy processes,\nincluding Brownian motion) in dimension $d\\geq 3$, we establish an exact\nformula for the average number of $(d-1)$-dimensional facets that can be\ndefined by $d$ points on the process's path. This formula defines a\nuniversality class in that it is independent of the increments' distribution,\nand it admits a closed form when $d=3$, a case which is of particular interest\nfor applications in biophysics, chemistry and polymer science.\n  We also show that the asymptotical average number of facets behaves as\n$\\langle \\mathcal{F}_T^{(d)}\\rangle \\sim 2\\left[\\ln \\left( T/\\Delta\nt\\right)\\right]^{d-1}$, where $T$ is the total duration of the motion and\n$\\Delta t$ is the minimum time lapse separating points that define a facet.\n", "  Magnetic fields are essential to fully understand the interstellar medium\n(ISM) and its role in the disk-halo interface of galaxies is still poorly\nunderstood. Star formation is known to expel hot gas vertically into the halo\nand these outflows have important consequences for mean-field dynamo theory in\nthat they can be efficient in removing magnetic helicity. We perform new\nobservations of the nearby face-on spiral galaxy NGC 628 with the Karl G.\nJansky Very Large Array (JVLA) at S-band and the Effelsberg 100-m telescope at\nfrequencies of 2.6 GHz and 8.35 GHz. We obtain some of the most sensitive radio\ncontinuum images in both total and linearly polarised intensity of any external\ngalaxy observed so far in addition to high-quality images of Faraday depth and\npolarisation angle from which we obtained evidence for drivers of magnetic\nturbulence in the disk-halo connection. Such drivers include a superbubble\ndetected via a significant Faraday depth gradient coinciding with a HI hole. We\nobserve an azimuthal periodic pattern in Faraday depth with a pattern\nwavelength of 3.7$\\pm$ 0.1 kpc, indicating Parker instabilities. The lack of a\nsignificant anti-correlation between Faraday depth and magnetic pitch angle\nindicates that these loops are vertical in nature with little helical twisting,\nunlike in IC 342. We find that the magnetic pitch angle is systematically\nlarger than the morphological pitch angle of the polarisation arms which gives\nevidence for the action of a large-scale dynamo where the regular magnetic\nfield is not coupled to the gas flow and obtains a significant radial\ncomponent. We additionally discover a lone region of ordered magnetic field to\nthe north of the galaxy with a high degree of polarisation and a small pitch\nangle, a feature that has not been observed in any other galaxy so far and is\npossibly caused by an asymmetric HI hole.\n", "  The Sky Quality Meter (SQM) has become the most common device to track the\nevolution of the brightness of the sky from polluted regions to first class\nastronomical observatories. A vast database of SQM measurements already exists\nfor many places in the world. Unfortunately, the SQM operates over a wide\nspectral band and its spectral response interacts with the sky's spectrum in a\ncomplex manner. This is why the optical signals are difficult to interpret when\nthe data are recorded in regions with different sources of artificial light.\nThe brightness of the night sky is linked in a complex way to ground-based\nlight emissions while taking into account atmospheric-induced optical\ndistortion as well as spectral transformation from the underlying ground\nsurfaces. While the spectral modulation of the sky's radiance has been\nrecognized, it still remains poorly characterized and quantified. The impact of\nthe SQM's spectral characteristics on the sky brightness measurements is here\nanalysed for different light sources, including low and high pressure sodium\nlamps, PC-amber and white LEDs, metal halide, and mercury lamps. We show that a\nroutine conversion of radiance to magnitude is difficult or rather impossible\nbecause the average wavelength depends on actual atmospheric and environment\nconditions, the spectrum of the source, and device specific properties. We\ncorrelate SQM readings with both the Johnson astronomical photometry bands and\nthe human system of visual perception, assuming different lighting\ntechnologies. These findings have direct implications for the processing of SQM\ndata and for its improvement and/or remediation.\n", "  High-order harmonic generation (HHG) results from strong-field laser matter\ninteraction and it is one of the main processes that are used to extract\nelectron structural and dynamical information about the atomic or molecular\ntargets with sub-femtosecond temporal resolution. Moreover, it is the workhorse\nfor the generation of attosecond pulses. Here we develop an analytical\ndescription of HHG, which extends the well established theoretical strong-field\napproximation (SFA). Our approach involves two innovative aspects: i) First,\nusing a model non-local, but separable potential, we calculate the bound-free\ndipole and the rescattering transition matrix elements analytically for both\natomic and molecular multicenter systems. In comparison with the standard\napproaches to the HHG process, these analytic derivations of the different\nmatrix elements allows us to study directly how the HHG spectra depend on the\natomic target and laser pulse features. We can turn on and of contributions\nhaving distinct physical origins or corresponding to different physical\nmechanisms. Our SFA results are compared, when possible, with the direct\nnumerical integration of the time-dependent Schr\u007f\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) in\nreduced and full dimensionality. Excellent agreement is found for single and\nmultielectronic atomic systems, modeled under the single active electron\napproximation, and for simple diatomic molecular systems. Our model captures\nalso the interference features, ubiquitously present in every strong-field\nphenomenon involving a multicenter target.\n", "  The magnetic-field-temperature phase diagram of solid oxygen is investigated\nby the adiabatic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) measurement with pulsed magnetic\nfields. Relatively large temperature decrease with hysteresis is observed at\njust below the $\\beta$-$\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ phase transition\ntemperatures owing to the field-induced transitions. The magnetic field\ndependences of these phase boundaries are obtained as\n$T_\\mathrm{\\beta\\gamma}(H)=43.8-1.55\\times10^{-3}H^2$ K and\n$T_\\mathrm{\\alpha\\beta}(H)=23.9-0.73\\times10^{-3}H^2$ K. The magnetic\nClausius-Clapeyron equation quantitatively explains the $H$ dependence of\n$T_\\mathrm{\\beta\\gamma}$, meanwhile, does not $T_\\mathrm{\\alpha\\beta}$. The MCE\ncurve at $T_\\mathrm{\\beta\\gamma}$ is of typical first-order, while the curve at\n$T_\\mathrm{\\alpha\\beta}$ seems to have both characteristics of first- and\nsecond-order transitions. We discuss the order of the $\\alpha$-$\\beta$ phase\ntransition and propose possible reasons for the unusual behavior.\n", "  The effect of baryons on the matter power spectrum is likely to have an\nobservable effect for future galaxy surveys, like Euclid or LSST. As a first\nstep towards a fully predictive theory, we investigate the effect of\nnon-radiative hydrodynamics on the structure of galaxy groups sized halos,\nwhich contribute the most to the weak lensing power spectrum. We perform high\nresolution (more than one million particles per halo and one kilo-parsec\nresolution) non-radiative hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of a sample of 16\nhalos, comparing the profiles to popular analytical models. We find that the\ntotal mass profile is well fitted by a Navarro, Frenk & White model, with\nparameters slightly modified from the dark matter only simulation. We also find\nthat the Komatsu & Seljak hydrostatic solution provides a good fit to the gas\nprofiles, with however significant deviations, arising from strong turbulent\nmixing in the core and from non-thermal, turbulent pressure support in the\noutskirts. The turbulent energy follows a shallow, rising linear profile with\nradius, and correlates with the halo formation time. Using only three main\nstructural halo parameters as variables (total mass, concentration parameter\nand central gas density), we can predict with an accuracy better than 20% the\nindividual gas density and temperature profiles. For the average total mass\nprofile, which is relevant for power spectrum calculations, we even reach an\naccuracy of 1%. The robustness of these predictions has been tested against\nresolution effects, different types of initial conditions and hydrodynamical\nschemes.\n", "  The nuclear $\\alpha$ decay of heavy nuclei is investigated based on the\nnuclear energy density functional, which leads to the $\\alpha$ potential inside\nthe parent nucleus in terms of the proton and neutron density profiles of the\ndaughter nucleus. We use the Skyrme force model, Gogny force model, and\nrelativistic mean field model to get the nucleon density profiles inside heavy\nnuclei. Once the nucleon density profiles are determined, the parameters of the\nnuclear $\\alpha$ potential are fitted to the observed $\\alpha$ decay half-lives\nof heavy nuclei. This approach is then applied to predict unknown $\\alpha$\ndecay half-lives of heavy nuclei. To estimate the $Q$ values of unobserved\n$\\alpha$ decays, we make use of the liquid droplet model.\n", "  We present dynamical measurements for 586 H-alpha detected star-forming\ngalaxies from the KMOS (K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph) Redshift One\nSpectroscopic Survey (KROSS). The sample represents typical star-forming\ngalaxies at this redshift (z=0.6-1.0), with a median star formation rate of ~7\nMsol/yr and a stellar mass range of log[M/Msol]~9-11. We find that the rotation\nvelocity-stellar mass relationship (the inverse of the Tully-Fisher\nrelationship) for our rotationally-dominated sources (v/sigma>1) has a\nconsistent slope and normalisation as that observed for z=0 disks. In contrast,\nthe specific angular momentum (j; angular momentum divided by stellar mass), is\n~0.2-0.3 dex lower on average compared to z=0 disks. The specific angular\nmomentum scales as M^[0.6+/-0.2], consistent with that expected for dark matter\n(i.e., proportional to M^[2/3]). We find that z~0.9 star-forming galaxies have\ndecreasing specific angular momentum with increasing Sersic index. Visually,\nthe sources with the highest specific angular momentum, for a given mass, have\nthe most disk-dominated morphologies. This implies that an angular\nmomentum-mass-morphology relationship, similar to that observed in local\nmassive galaxies, is already in place by z~1.\n", "  The X-ray binary population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) contains a\nlarge number of massive X-ray binaries and the recent survey of the SMC by\nXMM-Newton has resulted in almost 50 more tentative high mass X-ray binary\ncandidates. Using probability parameters from Haberl & Sturm (2016) together\nwith the optical spectra and timing in this work, we confirm six new massive\nX-ray binaries in the SMC. We also report two very probable binary periods; of\n36.4d in XMM 1859 and of 72.2 d in XMM 2300. These Be X-ray binaries are likely\npart of the general SMC population which rarely undergoes an X-ray outburst.\n", "  A fractional quasiparticle charge is a manifestation of strong interactions\nin the fractional quantum Hall effect. Nevertheless, shot noise of\nquasiparticles is well described by a formula, derived for noninteracting\ncharges. We explain the success of that formula by proving that in the limits\nof strong and weak backscattering it holds irrespectively of microscopic\ndetails in weakly and strongly interacting systems alike. The derivation relies\nonly on principles of statistical mechanics. We also derive an approximate\nmodel-independent formula for shot noise in the regime of intermediate\nbackscattering. The equation is numerically close to the standard\n`noninteracting' fitting formula but suggests a different physical\ninterpretation of the experimental results. We verify our theoretical\npredictions with a shot noise experiment at the filling factor $3/5$.\n", "  We present an asymptotically flat and stationary multi-black lens solution\nwith bi-axisymmetry of $U(1)\\times U(1)$ as a supersymmetric solution in the\nfive-dimensional minimal ungauged supergravity. We show that the spatial cross\nsection of each degenerate Killing horizon admits different lens space\ntopologies of $L(n,1)=S^3/{\\mathbb Z_n}$ as well as a sphere $S^3$. Moreover,\nwe show that in contrast to the higher dimensional Majumdar-Papapertrou\nmulti-black hole and multi-BMPV black hole spacetimes, the metric is smooth on\neach horizon even if the horizon topology is spherical.\n", "  The dynamics of systems subjected to noise is called Markovian in the absence\nof memory effects, i.e. when its immediate future only depends on its present.\nTime correlations in the noise source may generate non-Markovian effects that,\nsometimes, can be erased by appropriately coarse graining the time evolution of\nthe system. In general, the coarse graining time $t_\\text{CG}$ is taken to be\nmuch larger than the correlation time $\\tau$ but no direct relation between\nthem is established. Here we analytically obtain a relation between\n$t_\\text{CG}$ and $\\tau$ for the dynamics of a qubit subjected to a time\ncorrelated environment. Our results can be applied in principle to any\ndistribution of the environmental correlations and can be tested through a\ncollisional model where the qubit sequentially interacts with correlated\nqutrits.\n", "  The corona, a hot cloud of electrons close to the centre of the accretion\ndisc, produces the hard X-ray power-law continuum commonly seen in luminous\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN). The continuum has a high-energy turnover,\ntypically in the range of one to several 100 keV and is suggestive of\nComptonization by thermal electrons. We are studying hard X-ray spectra of AGN\nobtained with NuSTAR after correction for X-ray reflection and under the\nassumption that coronae are compact, being only a few gravitational radii in\nsize as indicated by reflection and reverberation modelling. Compact coronae\nraise the possibility that the temperature is limited and indeed controlled by\nelectron-positron pair production, as explored earlier (Paper I). Here we\nexamine hybrid plasmas in which a mixture of thermal and nonthermal particles\nis present. Pair production from the nonthermal component reduces the\ntemperature leading to a wider temperature range more consistent with\nobservations.\n", "  We explore gauge coupling unification and dark matter in high scale\nsupersymmetry where the scale of supersymmetry breaking is much above the weak\nscale. The gauge couplings unify as precisely as in low energy supersymmetry if\nthe higgsinos, whose mass does not break supersymmetry, are much lighter than\nthose obtaining masses from supersymmetry breaking. The dark matter of the\nuniverse can then be explained by the neutral higgsino or the gravitino. High\nscale supersymmetry with light higgsinos requires a large Higgs mixing\nparameter for electroweak symmetry breaking to take place. It is thus naturally\nrealized in models where superparticle masses are generated at loop level while\nthe Higgs mixing parameter is induced at tree level, like in anomaly and gauge\nmediation of supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  We unify the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes with the global\nproperties of galaxies, groups, and clusters, by linking for the first time the\nphysical mechanical efficiency at the horizon and Mpc scale. The macro hot halo\nis tightly constrained by the absence of overheating and overcooling as probed\nby X-ray data and hydrodynamic simulations ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm BH} \\simeq$\n10$^{-3}\\, T_{\\rm x,7.4}$). The micro flow is shaped by general relativistic\neffects tracked by state-of-the-art GR-RMHD simulations ($\\varepsilon_\\bullet\n\\simeq$ 0.03). The SMBH properties are tied to the X-ray halo temperature\n$T_{\\rm x}$, or related cosmic scaling relation (as $L_{\\rm x}$). The model is\nminimally based on first principles, as conservation of energy and mass\nrecycling. The inflow occurs via chaotic cold accretion (CCA), the rain of cold\nclouds condensing out of the quenched cooling flow and recurrently funneled via\ninelastic collisions. Within 100s gravitational radii, the accretion energy is\ntransformed into ultrafast 10$^4$ km s$^{-1}$ outflows (UFOs) ejecting most of\nthe inflowing mass. At larger radii the energy-driven outflow entrains\nprogressively more mass: at roughly kpc scale, the velocities of the\nhot/warm/cold outflows are a few 10$^3$, 1000, 500 km s$^{-1}$, with median\nmass rates ~10, 100, several 100 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The unified\nCCA model is consistent with the observations of nuclear UFOs, and ionized,\nneutral, and molecular macro outflows. We provide step-by-step implementation\nfor subgrid simulations, (semi)analytic works, or observational interpretations\nwhich require self-regulated AGN feedback at coarse scales, avoiding the\na-posteriori fine-tuning of efficiencies.\n", "  Direct collapse black holes forming in pristine, atomically-cooling haloes at\n$z \\approx 10-20$ may act as the seeds of supermassive black holes (BH) at high\nredshifts. In order to create a massive BH seed, the host halo needs to be\nprevented from forming stars. H$_2$ therefore needs to be irradiated by a large\nflux of Lyman-Werner (LW) UV photons in order to suppress H$_2$ cooling. A key\nuncertainty in this scenario is the escape fraction of LW radiation from first\ngalaxies, the dominant source of UV photons at this epoch. To better constrain\nthis escape fraction, we have performed radiation-hydrodynamical simulations of\nthe growth of HII regions and their associated photodissociation regions in the\nfirst galaxies using the ZEUS-MP code. We find that the LW escape fraction\ncrucially depends on the propagation of the ionisation front (I-front). For an\nR-type I-front overrunning the halo, the LW escape fraction is always larger\nthan 95%. If the halo recombines later from the outside--in, due to a softened\nand weakened spectrum, the LW escape fraction in the rest-frame of the halo\n(the near-field) drops to zero. A detailed and careful analysis is required to\nanalyse slowly moving, D-type I-fronts, where the escape fraction depends on\nthe microphysics and can be as small as 3% in the near-field and 61% in the\nfar-field or as large as 100% in both the near-field and the far-field.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the multiwavelengths properties of the magnetic\nearly B-type star HR7355. We present its radio light curves at several\nfrequencies, taken with the Jansky Very Large Array, and X-ray spectra, taken\nwith the XMM X-ray telescope. Modeling of the radio light curves for the Stokes\nI and V provides a quantitative analysis of the HR7355 magnetosphere. A\ncomparison between HR7355 and a similar analysis for the Ap star CUVir, allows\nus to study how the different physical parameters of the two stars affect the\nstructure of the respective magnetospheres where the non-thermal electrons\noriginate. Our model includes a cold thermal plasma component that accumulates\nat high magnetic latitudes that influences the radio regime, but does not give\nrise to X-ray emission. Instead, the thermal X-ray emission arises from shocks\ngenerated by wind stream collisions close to the magnetic equatorial plane. The\nanalysis of the X-ray spectrum of HR7355 also suggests the presence of a\nnon-thermal radiation. Comparison between the spectral index of the power-law\nX-ray energy distribution with the non-thermal electron energy distribution\nindicates that the non-thermal X-ray component could be the auroral signature\nof the non-thermal electrons that impact the stellar surface, the same\nnon-thermal electrons that are responsible for the observed radio emission. On\nthe basis of our analysis, we suggest a novel model that simultaneously\nexplains the X-ray and the radio features of HR7355 and is likely relevant for\nmagnetospheres of other magnetic early type stars.\n", "  We consider the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a bilayer\nhoneycomb lattice including interlayer frustration in the presence of an\nexternal magnetic field. In the vicinity of the saturation field, we map the\nlow-energy states of this quantum system onto the spatial configurations of\nhard hexagons on a honeycomb lattice. As a result, we can construct effective\nclassical models (lattice-gas as well as Ising models) on the honeycomb lattice\nto calculate the properties of the frustrated quantum Heisenberg spin system in\nthe low-temperature regime. We perform classical Monte Carlo simulations for a\nhard-hexagon model and adopt known results for an Ising model to discuss the\nfinite-temperature order-disorder phase transition that is driven by a magnetic\nfield at low temperatures. We also discuss an effective-model description\naround the ideal frustration case and find indications for a spin-flop like\ntransition in the considered isotropic spin model.\n", "  Based on SDSS data, we have considered the spatial environment of galaxies\nwith extended polar rings. We used two approaches: estimating the projected\ndistance to the nearest companion and counting the number of companions as a\nfunction of the distance to the galaxy. Both approaches have shown that the\nspatial environment of polar-ring galaxies on scales of hundreds of kiloparsecs\nis, on average, less dense than that of galaxies without polar structures.\nApparently, one of the main causes of this effect is that the polar structures\nin a denser environment are destroyed more often during encounters and mergers\nwith other galaxies.\n", "  Vertically stratified shearing box simulations of magnetorotational\nturbulence commonly exhibit a so-called butterfly diagram of quasi-periodic\nazimuthal field reversals. However, in the presence of hydrodynamic convection,\nfield reversals no longer occur. Instead, the azimuthal field strength\nfluctuates quasi-periodically while maintaining the same polarity, which can\neither be symmetric or antisymmetric about the disc midplane. Using data from\nthe simulations of Hirose et al. (2014), we demonstrate that the lack of field\nreversals in the presence of convection is due to hydrodynamic mixing of\nmagnetic field from the more strongly magnetized upper layers into the\nmidplane, which then annihilate field reversals that are starting there. Our\nconvective simulations differ in several respects from those reported in\nprevious work by others, in which stronger magnetization likely plays a more\nimportant role than convection.\n", "  We present spatially and spectrally-resolved observations of CH$_3$OH\nemission from comet C/2012 K1 (PanSTARRS) using The Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 2014 June 28-29. Two-dimensional maps\nof the line-of-sight average rotational temperature ($T_{rot}$) were derived,\ncovering spatial scales $0.3''-1.8''$ (corresponding to sky-projected distances\n$\\rho\\sim500$-2500 km). The CH$_3$OH column density distributions are\nconsistent with isotropic, uniform outflow from the nucleus, with no evidence\nfor extended sources of CH$_3$OH in the coma. The $T_{rot}(\\rho)$ radial\nprofiles show a significant drop within a few thousand kilometers of the\nnucleus, falling from about 60 K to 20 K between $\\rho=0$ and 2500 km on June\n28, whereas on June 29, $T_{rot}$ fell from about 120 K to 40 K between $\\rho=$\n0 km and 1000 km. The observed $T_{rot}$ behavior is interpreted primarily as a\nresult of variations in the coma kinetic temperature due to adiabatic cooling\nof the outflowing gas, as well as radiative cooling of the CH$_3$OH rotational\nlevels. Our excitation model shows that radiative cooling is more important for\nthe $J=7-6$ transitions (at 338 GHz) than for the $K=3-2$ transitions (at 252\nGHz), resulting in a strongly sub-thermal distribution of levels in the $J=7-6$\nband at $\\rho\\gtrsim1000$ km. For both bands, the observed temperature drop\nwith distance is less steep than predicted by standard coma theoretical models,\nwhich suggests the presence of a significant source of heating in addition to\nthe photolytic heat sources usually considered.\n", "  Photometric CCD {\\it UBVI}$_C$ photometry obtained for 4860 stars surrounding\nthe embedded southern cluster SAI~113 (Skiff~8) is used to examine the\nreddening in the field and derive the distance to the cluster and nearby\nvan~Genderen~1. Spectroscopic color excesses for bright cluster stars,\nphotometric reddenings for A3 dwarfs, and dereddening of cluster stars imply\nthat the reddening and extinction laws match results derived for other young\nclusters in Carina: E$_{U-B}/$E$_{B-V} \\simeq 0.64$ and $R_V \\simeq 4$. SAI~113\ndisplays features that may be linked to a history of dynamical interactions\namong member stars: possible circumstellar reddening and rapid rotation of late\nB-type members, ringlike features in star density, and a compact core with most\nstars distributed randomly across the field. The group van~Genderen~1 resembles\na stellar asterism, with potential members distributed randomly across the\nfield. Distances of $3.90 \\pm0.19$ kpc and $2.49 \\pm0.09$ kpc are derived for\nSAI~113 and van~Genderen~1, respectively, with variable reddenings E$_{B-V}$\nranging from 0.84 to 1.29 and 0.23 to 1.28. The SRC variables CK~Car and EV~Car\nmay be outlying members of van~Genderen~1, thereby of use for calibrating the\nperiod-luminosity relation for pulsating M supergiants. More importantly, the\nanomalous reddening and extinction evident in Carina and nearby regions of the\nGalactic plane in the fourth quadrant impact the mapping of spiral structure\nfrom young open clusters. The distribution of spiral arms in the fourth\nquadrant may be significantly different from how it is often portrayed.\n", "  Cyclic-C3HD (c-C3HD) is a singly deuterated isotopologue of c-C3H2, which is\none of the most abundant and widespread molecules in our Galaxy. We observed\nIRAS 16293-2422 in the 3 mm band with a single frequency setup using the EMIR\nheterodyne 3 mm receiver of the IRAM 30m telescope. We observed seven lines of\nc-C3HD and three lines of c-C3H2. Observed abundances are compared with\nastrochemical simulations using the NAUTILUS gas-grain chemical model. Our\nresults clearly show that c-C3HD can be used as an important supplement for\nstudying chemistry and physical conditions for cold environments. Assuming that\nthe size of the protostellar envelope is 3000 AU and same excitation\ntemperatures for both c-C3H2 and c-C3HD, we obtain a deuterium fraction of\n$14_{-3}^{+4}\\%$.\n", "  Based on sub-arcsecond Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)\nand Submillimeter Array (SMA) 1.3 mm continuum images of the massive\nprotocluster NGC 6334I obtained in 2015 and 2008, we find that the dust\nemission from MM1 has increased by a factor of 4.0$\\pm$0.3 during the\nintervening years, and undergone a significant change in morphology. The\ncontinuum emission from the other cluster members (MM2, MM4 and the UCHII\nregion MM3 = NGC 6334F) has remained constant. Long term single-dish maser\nmonitoring at HartRAO finds that multiple maser species toward NGC 6334I flared\nbeginning in early 2015, a few months before our ALMA observation, and some\npersist in that state. New ALMA images obtained in 2016 July-August at 1.1 and\n0.87 mm confirm the changes with respect to SMA 0.87 mm images from 2008, and\nindicate that the (sub)millimeter flaring has continued for at least a year.\nThe excess continuum emission, centered on the hypercompact HII region MM1B, is\nextended and elongated ($1.6\" \\times 1.0\" \\approx 2100 \\times 1300$ au) with\nmultiple peaks, suggestive of general heating of the surrounding subcomponents\nof MM1, some of which may trace clumps in a fragmented disk rather than\nseparate protostars. In either case, these remarkable increases in maser and\ndust emission provide direct observational evidence of a sudden accretion event\nin the growth of a massive protostar yielding a sustained luminosity surge by a\nfactor of $70\\pm20$, analogous to the largest events in simulations by Meyer et\nal. (2017). This target provides an excellent opportunity to assess the impact\nof such a rare event on a protocluster over many years.\n", "  We present the results of formaldehyde and methanol deuteration measurements\ntowards the Class I low-mass protostar SVS13-A, in the framework of the IRAM\n30-m ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM) project. We detected emission lines\nof formaldehyde, methanol, and their deuterated forms (HDCO, D2CO, CHD2OH,\nCH3OD) with Eup up to 276 K. The formaldehyde analysis indicates Tkin = 15 - 30\nK, n (H2) >= 10^6 cm^-3, and a size of about 1200 AU suggesting an origin in\nthe protostellar envelope. For methanol we find two components: (i) a high\ntemperature (Tkin = 80 K) and very dense (> 10^8 cm^-3}) gas from a hot corino\n(radius about 35 AU), and (ii) a colder Tkin <= 70 K) and more extended (radius\nabout 350 AU) region.\n  The deuterium fractionation is 9 10^-2 for HDCO, 4 10^-3 for D2CO, and 2 - 7\n10^-3 for CH2DOH, up to two orders of magnitude lower than the values measured\nin Class 0 sources. We derive also formaldehyde deuteration in the outflow: 4\n10^-3, in agreement with what found in the L1157-B1 protostellar shock.\nFinally, we estimate [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] about 2. The decrease of deuteration in\nthe Class I source SVS13-A with respect to Class 0 sources can be explained by\ngas-phase processes. Alternatively, a lower deuteration could be the effect of\na gradual collapse of less deuterated external shells of the protostellar\nevelope. The present measurements fill in the gap between prestellar cores and\nprotoplanetary disks in the context of organics deuteration measurements.\n", "  In this work, we discuss the Landau's criterion for anisotropic\nsuperfluidity. To this end, we consider a point-like impurity moving in a\nuniform Bose-Einstein condensate with either interparticle dipole-dipole\ninteraction or Raman induced spin-orbit coupling. In both cases, we find that\nthe Landau critical velocity $v_{\\rm c}$ is generally smaller than the sound\nvelocity in the moving direction. Beyond $v_{\\rm c}$, the energy dissipation\nrate is explicitly calculated via a perturbation approach. In the plane-wave\nphase of a spin-orbit coupled Bose gas, the dissipationless motion is\nsuppressed by the Raman coupling even in the direction orthogonal to the recoil\nmomentum. Our predictions can be tested in the experiments with ultracold\natoms.\n", "  We present the first X-ray study of Collinder 261 (Cr261), which at an age of\n7 Gyr is one of the oldest open clusters known in the Galaxy. Our observation\nwith the Chandra X-ray Observatory is aimed at uncovering the close interacting\nbinaries in Cr261, and reaches a limiting X-ray luminosity of Lx ~ 4e29 erg/s\n(0.3-7 keV) for stars in the cluster. We detect 107 sources within the cluster\nhalf-mass radius r_h, and we estimate that among the sources with Lx >~ 1e30\nerg/s, ~26 are associated with the cluster. We identify a mix of active\nbinaries and candidate active binaries, candidate cataclysmic variables, and\nstars that have \"straggled\" from the main locus of Cr261 in the\ncolour-magnitude diagram. Based on a deep optical source catalogue of the\nfield, we estimate that Cr261 has an approximate mass of 6500 M_sun, roughly\nthe same as the old open cluster NGC6791. The X-ray emissivity of Cr261 is\nsimilar to that of other old open clusters, supporting the trend that they are\nmore luminous in X-rays per unit mass than old populations of higher (globular\nclusters) and lower (the local neighbourhood) stellar density. This implies\nthat the dynamical destruction of binaries in the densest environments is not\nsolely responsible for the observed differences in X-ray emissivity.\n", "  The S-band Polarisation All-Sky Survey (S-PASS) has observed the entire\nsouthern sky using the 64-metre Parkes radio telescope at 2.3GHz with an\neffective bandwidth of 184MHz. The surveyed sky area covers all declinations\n$\\delta\\leq 0^\\circ$. To analyse compact sources the survey data have been\nre-processed to produce a set of 107 Stokes $I$ maps with 10.75arcmin\nresolution and the large scale emission contribution filtered out. In this\npaper we use these Stokes $I$ images to create a total intensity southern-sky\nextragalactic source catalogue at 2.3GHz. The source catalogue contains 23,389\nsources and covers a sky area of 16,600deg$^2$, excluding the Galactic plane\nfor latitudes $|b|<10^\\circ$. Approximately 8% of catalogued sources are\nresolved. S-PASS source positions are typically accurate to within 35arcsec. At\na flux density of 225mJy the S-PASS source catalogue is more than 95% complete,\nand $\\sim$94% of S-PASS sources brighter than 500mJy beam$^{-1}$ have a\ncounterpart at lower frequencies.\n", "  Analytic results for (Q)ED processes in external fields are limited to a few\nspecial cases, such as plane waves. However, the strong focussing of intense\nlaser fields implies a need to go beyond the plane wave model. By exploiting\nPoincar\\'e symmetry and superintegrability we show how to construct, and solve\nwithout approximation, new models of laser-particle interactions. We illustrate\nthe method with a model of a radially polarised (TM) laser beam, for which we\nexactly determine the classical orbits and quantum wave functions. Including in\nthis way the effects of transverse field structure should improve predictions\nand analyses for experiments at intense laser facilities.\n", "  We present the first part of an investigation on the planetary nebula (PN) PC\n22 which focuses on the use of deep imaging and high resolution echelle\nspectroscopy to perform a detailed morpho-kinematical analysis. PC 22 is\nrevealed to be a multipolar PN emitting predominantly in [O III] and displaying\nmultiple non-symmetric outflows. Its central region is found to be also\nparticularly inhomogeneous with a series of low ionization structures (knots)\nlocated on the path of the outflows. The morpho-kinematical model obtained with\nSHAPE indicates that i) the de-projected velocities of the outflows are rather\nlarge, > 100 km/s, while the central region has expansion velocities in the\nrange ~25 to ~45 km/s following the \"Wilson effect\", ii) the majority of the\nmeasured structures share similar inclination, ~100 degrees, i.e. they are\ncoplanar, and iii) all outflows and lobes are coeval (within the\nuncertainties). All these results make us to suggest that PC 22 is an evolved\nstarfish PN. We propose that the mechanism responsible for the morphology of PC\n22 consists of a wind-shell interaction, where the fast post-AGB wind flows\nthrough a filamentary AGB shell with some large voids.\n", "  We have carried out a panoramic Ly$\\alpha$ narrowband imaging with\nSuprime-Cam on Subaru towards the known protocluster USS1558--003 at $z=2.53$.\nOur previous narrowband imaging at near-infrared has identified multiple dense\ngroups of H$\\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) within the protocluster. We have now\nidentified the large-scale structures across a $\\sim$50 comoving Mpc scale\ntraced by Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in which the protocluster traced by the\nHAEs is embedded. On a smaller scale, however, there are remarkably few LAEs in\nthe regions of HAE overdensities. Moreover, the stacking analyses of the images\nshow that HAEs in higher-density regions show systematically lower escape\nfractions of Ly$\\alpha$ photons than those of HAEs in lower-density regions.\nThese phenomena may be driven by the extra depletion of Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nlines along our line of sight by more intervening cold\ncircumgalactic/intergalactic medium and/or dust existing in the dense core. We\nalso caution that all the past high-$z$ protocluster surveys using LAEs as the\ntracers would have largely missed galaxies in the very dense cores of the\nprotoclusters where we would expect to see any early environmental effects.\n", "  Hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent molecular clouds show that star\nclusters form from the hierarchical merger of several sub-clumps. We run\nsmoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations of turbulence-supported molecular\nclouds with mass ranging from 1700 to 43000 Msun. We study the kinematic\nevolution of the main cluster that forms in each cloud. We find that the parent\ngas acquires significant rotation, because of large-scale torques during the\nprocess of hierarchical assembly. The stellar component of the embedded star\ncluster inherits the rotation signature from the parent gas. Only star clusters\nwith final mass < few X 100 Msun do not show any clear indication of rotation.\nOur simulated star clusters have high ellipticity (~0.4-0.5 at t=4 Myr) and are\nsubvirial (Q_vir<~0.4). The signature of rotation is stronger than radial\nmotions due to subvirial collapse. Our results suggest that rotation is common\nin embedded massive (>~1000 Msun) star clusters. This might provide a key\nobservational test for the hierarchical assembly scenario.\n", "  We compute the two-loop QCD corrections to $q g \\to H q$ and $q \\bar{q} \\to H\ng$ amplitudes mediated by loops of nearly massless quarks. These amplitudes\nprovide the last missing ingredient required to compute the NLO QCD corrections\nto the top-bottom interference contribution to the Higgs boson transverse\nmomentum distribution at hadron colliders.\n", "  We present new X-ray (Chandra) and radio (ATCA) observations of the z=0.09\nradio galaxy PKS B1416-493, a member of the southern equivalent of the 3CRR\nsample. We find the source to be embedded in a previously unrecognized bright\nkT=4.6 keV non cool-core cluster. The discovery of new clusters of such high\ntemperature and luminosity within z=0.1 is rare. The radio source was chosen\nfor observation based on its intermediate FRI/II morphology. We identify a\ncavity coincident with the northeast lobe, and excess counts associated with\nthe southwest lobe that we interpret as inverse Compton X-ray emission. The jet\npower, at 5.3 x 10^44 erg/s, when weighted by radio source density, supports\nsuggestions that radio sources of intermediate morphology and radio power may\ndominate radio-galaxy heating in the local Universe.\n", "  Multi-wavelength techniques can probe the distribution and the physical\nproperties of baryons and dark matter in galaxy clusters from the inner regions\nout to the peripheries. We present a full three-dimensional analysis combining\nstrong and weak lensing, X-ray surface brightness and temperature, and the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. The method is applied to MACS J1206.2-0847, a\nremarkably regular, face-on, massive, M_{200}=(1.1+-0.2)*10^{15}M_Sun/h,\ncluster at z=0.44. The measured concentration, c_{200}=6.3+-1.2, and the\ntriaxial shape are common to halos formed in a LCDM scenario. The gas has\nsettled in and follows the shape of the gravitational potential, which is\nevidence of pressure equilibrium via the shape theorem. There is no evidence\nfor significant non-thermal pressure and the equilibrium is hydrostatic.\n", "  We consider the three currently known pulsing ultraluminous X--ray sources\n(PULXs). We show that in one of them the observed spinup rate requires\nsuper--Eddington accretion rates at the magnetospheric radius, even if\nmagnetar--strength fields are assumed. In the two other systems a\nnormal--strength neutron star field implies super--Eddington accretion at the\nmagnetosphere. Adopting super--Eddington mass transfer as the defining\ncharacteristic of ULX systems, we find the parameters required for\nself--consistent simultaneous fits of the luminosities and spinup rates of the\nthree pulsed systems. These imply near--equality between their magnetospheric\nradii $R_M$ and the spherization radii $R_{\\rm sph}$ where radiation pressure\nbecomes important and drives mass loss from the accretion disc. We interpret\nthis near--equality as a necessary condition for the systems to appear as\npulsed, since if it is violated the pulse fraction is small. We show that as a\nconsequence all PULXs must have spinup rates $\\dot\\nu \\gtrsim 10^{-10}\\, {\\rm\ns^{-2}}$, an order of magnitude higher than in any other pulsing neutron--star\nbinaries. The fairly tight conditions required for ULXs to show pulsing support\nour earlier suggestion that many unpulsed ULX systems must actually contain\nneutron stars rather than black holes.\n", "  We present time-series observations of Population \\rom{2} Cepheids in the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud at near-infrared ($JHK_s$) wavelengths. Our sample\nconsists of 81 variables with accurate periods and optical ($VI$) magnitudes\nfrom the OGLE survey, covering various subtypes of pulsators (BL Herculis, W\nVirginis and RV Tauri). We generate light curve templates using high-quality\n$I$-band data in the LMC from OGLE and $K_s$-band data in the Galactic Bulge\nfrom VVV and use them to obtain robust mean magnitudes. We derive\nPeriod-Luminosity (P-L) relations in the near-infrared and Period-Wesenheit\n(P-W) relations by combining optical and near-infrared data. Our P-L and P-W\nrelations are consistent with published work when excluding long-period RV\nTauris. We find that Pop II Cepheids and RR Lyraes follow the same P-L\nrelations in the LMC. Therefore, we use trigonometric parallax from the {\\it\nGaia DR1} for VY~Pyx and the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} parallaxes for\n$k$~Pav and 5 RR Lyrae variables to obtain an absolute calibration of the\nGalactic $K_s$-band P-L relation, resulting in a distance modulus to the LMC of\n$\\mu_{\\rm LMC} = 18.54\\pm0.08$~mag. We update the mean magnitudes of Pop~II\nCepheids in Galactic globular clusters using our light curve templates and\nobtain distance estimates to those systems, anchored to a precise late-type\neclipsing binary distance to the LMC. We find the distances to these globular\nclusters based on Pop~II Cepheids are consistent (within $2\\sigma$) with\nestimates based on the $M_V-[\\rm{Fe}/\\rm{H}]$ relation for horizontal branch\nstars.\n", "  The microphysical properties, such as effective viscosity and conductivity,\nof the weakly magnetized intergalactic plasma are not yet well known. We\ninvestigate the constraints that can be placed by an azimuthally resolved study\nof the cold front in Abell 3667 using $\\sim$500 ksec archival Chandra data. We\nfind that the radius of the interface fluctuates with position angle and the\nmorphology of the interface is strikingly similar to recent numerical\nsimulations of inviscid gas-stripping. We find multiple edges in the surface\nbrightness profiles across the cold front as well as azimuthal variations,\nwhich are consistent with the presence of Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities (KHI)\ndeveloping along the cold front. They indicate that the characteristic length\nscale of KHI rolls is around 20-80 kpc. This is the first observational\nindication of developing KHIs along a merger cold front in a galaxy cluster.\nBased on the KHI scenario, we estimated the upper limit of the ICM effective\nviscosity. The estimated value of $\\mu\\lesssim200~\\mathrm{g/cm/s}$ is at most\n5% of the isotropic Spitzer-like viscosity. The observed apparent mixing\ntowards the outer edges away from the tip of the front provides an additional\nevidence for suppressed viscosity.\n", "  We present C and O abundances in the Magellanic Clouds derived from deep\nspectra of HII regions. The data have been taken with the Ultraviolet-Visual\nEchelle Spectrograph at the 8.2-m VLT. The sample comprises 5 HII regions in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 4 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We\nmeasure pure recombination lines (RLs) of CII and OII in all the objects,\npermitting to derive the abundance discrepancy factors (ADFs) for O^2+, as well\nas their O/H, C/H and C/O ratios. We compare the ADFs with those of other HII\nregions in different galaxies. The results suggest a possible metallicity\ndependence of the ADF for the low-metallicity objects, but more uncertain for\nhigh-metallicity objects. We compare nebular and B-type stellar abundances and\nwe find that the stellar abundances agree better with the nebular ones derived\nfrom collisionally excited lines (CELs). Comparing these results with other\ngalaxies we observe that stellar abundances seem to agree better with the\nnebular ones derived from CELs in low-metallicity environments and from RLs in\nhigh-metallicity environments. The C/H, O/H and C/O ratios show almost flat\nradial gradients, in contrast with the spiral galaxies where such gradients are\nnegative. We explore the chemical evolution analysing C/O vs. O/H and comparing\nwith the results of HII regions in other galaxies. The LMC seems to show a\nsimilar chemical evolution to the external zones of small spiral galaxies and\nthe SMC behaves as a typical star-forming dwarf galaxy.\n", "  The existence of quasars that are kinetically dominated, where the jet\nkinetic luminosity, $Q$, is larger than the total (IR to X-ray) thermal\nluminosity of the accretion flow, $L_{\\rm{bol}}$, provides a strong constraint\non the fundamental physics of relativistic jet formation. Since quasars have\nhigh values of $L_{\\rm{bol}}$ by definition, only $\\sim 10$ kinetically\ndominated quasars (with $\\overline{Q}/L_{\\rm{bol}}>1$) have been found, where\n$\\overline{Q}$ is the long term time averaged jet power. We use low frequency\n(151 MHz$-$1.66 GHz) observations of the quasar 3C\\,418 to determine\n$\\overline{Q}\\approx 5.5 \\pm 1.3 \\times 10^{46} \\rm{ergs~s^{-1}}$. Analysis of\nthe rest frame ultraviolet spectrum indicates that this equates to $0.57 \\pm\n0.28$ times the Eddington luminosity of the central supermassive black hole and\n$\\overline{Q}/L_{\\rm{bol}} \\approx 4.8 \\pm 3.1$, making 3C\\,418 one of the most\nkinetically dominated quasars found to date. It is shown that this maximal\n$\\overline{Q}/L_{\\rm{bol}}$ is consistent with models of magnetically arrested\naccretion of jet production in which the jet production reproduces the observed\ntrend of a decrement in the extreme ultraviolet continuum as the jet power\nincreases. This maximal condition corresponds to an almost complete saturation\nof the inner accretion flow with vertical large scale magnetic flux (maximum\nsaturation).\n", "  We present the results of an optical spectroscopic monitoring program\ntargeting NGC 5548 as part of a larger multi-wavelength reverberation mapping\ncampaign. The campaign spanned six months and achieved an almost daily cadence\nwith observations from five ground-based telescopes. The H$\\beta$ and He II\n$\\lambda$4686 broad emission-line light curves lag that of the 5100 $\\AA$\noptical continuum by $4.17^{+0.36}_{-0.36}$ days and $0.79^{+0.35}_{-0.34}$\ndays, respectively. The H$\\beta$ lag relative to the 1158 $\\AA$ ultraviolet\ncontinuum light curve measured by the Hubble Space Telescope is roughly\n$\\sim$50% longer than that measured against the optical continuum, and the lag\ndifference is consistent with the observed lag between the optical and\nultraviolet continua. This suggests that the characteristic radius of the\nbroad-line region is $\\sim$50% larger than the value inferred from optical data\nalone. We also measured velocity-resolved emission-line lags for H$\\beta$ and\nfound a complex velocity-lag structure with shorter lags in the line wings,\nindicative of a broad-line region dominated by Keplerian motion. The responses\nof both the H$\\beta$ and He II $\\lambda$4686 emission lines to the driving\ncontinuum changed significantly halfway through the campaign, a phenomenon also\nobserved for C IV, Ly $\\alpha$, He II(+O III]), and Si IV(+O IV]) during the\nsame monitoring period. Finally, given the optical luminosity of NGC 5548\nduring our campaign, the measured H$\\beta$ lag is a factor of five shorter than\nthe expected value implied by the $R_\\mathrm{BLR} - L_\\mathrm{AGN}$ relation\nbased on the past behavior of NGC 5548.\n", "  Based on a version of Dudley's Wiener process on the mass shell in the\nmomentum Minkowski space of a massive point particle, a model of a relativistic\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck process is constructed by addition of a specific drift\nterm. The invariant distribution of this momentum process as well as other\nassociated processes are computed.\n", "  We present results of wide-field $^{12}$CO ($J = 2 - 1$) and $^{13}$CO ($J =\n2 - 1$) observations toward the Aquila Rift and Serpens molecular cloud\ncomplexes (25$^\\circ < l < 33^\\circ$ and $1^\\circ < b < 6^\\circ$) at an angular\nresolution of 3$'$.4 ($\\approx$ 0.25 pc) and at a velocity resolution of 0.079\nkm s$^{-1}$ with the velocity coverage of $-5$ km s$^{-1} < V_{\\rm LSR} <$ 35\nkm s$^{-1}$. We found that the $^{13}$CO emission better traces the structures\nseen in the extinction map and derived the $X_{\\rm ^{13}CO}$-factor of this\nregion. Applying \\texttt{SCIMES} to the $^{13}$CO data cube, we identified 61\nclouds and derived their masses, radii, and line widths. The line-width-radius\nrelation of the identified clouds basically follows those of nearby molecular\nclouds. Majority of the identified clouds are close to virial equilibrium\nalthough the dispersion is large. By inspecting the $^{12}$CO channel maps by\neye, we found several arcs which are spatially extended to 0.2 $-$ 3 degree in\nlength. In the longitude-velocity diagrams of $^{12}$CO, we also found the two\nspatially-extended components which appear to converge toward Serpens South and\nW40 region. The existence of two components with different velocities and arcs\nsuggests that large-scale expanding bubbles and/or flows play a role in the\nformation and evolution of the Serpens South and W40 cloud.\n", "  Baade's window (BW) is one of the most observed Galactic bulge fields in\nterms of chemical abundances. Due to its low and homogeneous interstellar\nabsorption it is considered as a calibration field for Galactic bulge studies.\nIn the era of large spectroscopic surveys, calibration fields such as BW are\nnecessary to cross calibrate the stellar parameters and individual abundances\nof the APOGEE survey. We use the APOGEE BW stars to derive their metallicity\ndistribution function (MDF) and individual abundances, for $\\alpha$- and\niron-peak elements of the APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (DR13), as well as the age\ndistribution for stars in BW. We determine the MDF of APOGEE stars in BW and\nfind a remarkable agreement with that of the Gaia-ESO survey (GES). Both\nexhibit a clear bimodal distribution. We also find that the Mg-metallicity\nplanes of both surveys agree well, except for the metal-rich part ([Fe/H]\n>0.1), where APOGEE finds systematically higher Mg abundances with respect to\nthe GES. The ages based on the [C/N] ratio reveal a bimodal age distribution,\nwith a major old population at 10 Gyr, with a decreasing tail towards younger\nstars. A comparison between APOGEE estimates and stellar parameters, and those\ndetermined by other sources reveals detectable systematic offsets, in\nparticular for spectroscopic surface gravity estimates. In general, we find a\ngood agreement between individual abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Cr,\nMn, Co, and Ni from APOGEE with that of literature values. We have shown that\nin general APOGEE data show a good agreement in terms of MDF and individual\nchemical abundances with respect to literature works. Using the [C/N] ration we\nfound a significant fraction of young stars in BW which is in agreement with\nthe model of Haywood et al. (2016).\n", "  A detailed knowledge of stellar activity is crucial for understanding stellar\ndynamos, as well as pushing exoplanet radial-velocity detection limits towards\nEarth analogue confirmation. We directly compare archival HARPS spectra taken\nat the minimum in $\\alpha$ Cen B's activity cycle to a high-activity state when\nclear rotational modulation of $\\log{R'_{HK}}$ is visible. Relative to the\ninactive spectra, we find a large number of narrow pseudo-emission features in\nthe active spectra with strengths that are rotationally modulated. These\nfeatures most likely originate from plage, spots, or a combination of both.\nThey also display radial velocity variations of $\\sim$300 m s$^{-1}$ -\nconsistent with an active region rotating across the stellar surface.\nFurthermore, we see evidence that some of the lines originating from the\n`active immaculate' photosphere appear broader relative to the `inactive\nimmaculate' case. This may be due to enhanced contributions of e.g. magnetic\nbright points to these lines, which then causes additional line broadening.\nMore detailed analysis may enable measurements of plage and spot coverage using\nsingle spectra in the future.\n", "  The abelian Higgs model is studied on the lattice with charge conjugate\nboundary conditions. A locally gauge invariant operator for the charged scalar\nfield is constructed and the charged scalar particle mass is calculated in the\nCoulomb phase of the lattice model. Agreement is found with the mass calculated\nin Coulomb gauge. The gauge invariant scalar field operator is used to\ncalculate the Higgs boson mass in the Higgs region and to show that the charged\nparticle disappears from the spectrum in the confined regime.\n", "  The misalignment of the solar rotation axis and the magnetic axis of the Sun\nproduces a periodic reversal of the Parker spiral magnetic field and the\nsectored solar wind. The compression of the sectors is expected to lead to\nreconnection in the heliosheath (HS). We present particle-in-cell simulations\nof the sectored HS that reflect the plasma environment along the Voyager 1 and\n2 trajectories, specifically including unequal positive and negative azimuthal\nmagnetic flux as seen in the Voyager data \\citep{Burlaga03}. Reconnection\nproceeds on individual current sheets until islands on adjacent current layers\nmerge. At late time bands of the dominant flux survive, separated by bands of\ndeep magnetic field depletion. The ambient plasma pressure supports the strong\nmagnetic pressure variation so that pressure is anti-correlated with magnetic\nfield strength. There is little variation in the magnetic field direction\nacross the boundaries of the magnetic depressions. At irregular intervals\nwithin the magnetic depressions are long-lived pairs of magnetic islands where\nthe magnetic field direction reverses so that spacecraft data would reveal\nsharp magnetic field depressions with only occasional crossings with jumps in\nmagnetic field direction. This is typical of the magnetic field data from the\nVoyager spacecraft \\citep{Burlaga11,Burlaga16}. Voyager 2 data reveals that\nfluctuations in the density and magnetic field strength are anti-correlated in\nthe sector zone as expected from reconnection but not in unipolar regions. The\nconsequence of the annihilation of subdominant flux is a sharp reduction in the\n\"number of sectors\" and a loss in magnetic flux as documented from the Voyager\n1 magnetic field and flow data \\citep{Richardson13}.\n", "  We study the dependence of satellite star formation rate and morphology on\ngroup dynamics for a sample of SDSS groups. We classify the group dynamical\nstate and study satellite properties for populations of galaxies at small and\nlarge group-centric radii. For galaxies at large radii we find no differences\nin the star-forming or disc fraction for those in Gaussian groups compared to\nthose in non-Gaussian groups. By comparing the star-forming and disc fractions\nof infalling galaxies to field galaxies we find evidence for the pre-processing\nof both star formation rate and morphology. The strength of pre-processing\nincreases with halo mass and is highest for low-mass galaxies infalling onto\nhigh-mass haloes. We show that the star formation rate of galaxies at small\nradii correlates with group dynamical state, with galaxies in non- Gaussian\ngroups showing enhanced star-forming fractions compared to galaxies in Gaussian\ngroups. Similar correlations are not seen for the disc fractions of galaxies at\nsmall radii. This seems to suggest that either the mechanisms driving star\nformation quenching at small halo-centric radii are more efficient in\ndynamically relaxed groups, or that non-Gaussian groups have assembled more\nrecently and therefore satellites of the groups will have been exposed to these\ntransforming mechanisms for less time.\n", "  Using K2 data, we have identified 23 very low mass members of the $\\rho$ Oph\nand Upper Scorpius star-forming region as having periodic photometric\nvariability not easily explained by well-established physical mechanisms such\nas star spots, eclipsing binaries, or pulsation. All of these unusual stars are\nmid-to-late M dwarfs without evidence of active accretion, and with photometric\nperiods generally $<$1 day. Often the unusual light curve signature takes the\nform of narrow flux dips; when we also have rotation periods from star spots,\nthe two periods agree, suggesting that the flux dips are due to material\norbiting the star at the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We sometimes see\n\"state-changes\" in the phased light curve morphologies where $\\sim$25% of the\nwaveform changes shape on timescales less than a day; often, the \"state-change\"\ntakes place immediately after a strong flare. For the group of stars with these\nsudden light curve morphology shifts, we attribute their flux dips as most\nprobably arising from eclipses of warm coronal gas clouds, analogous to the\nsling-shot prominences postulated to explain transient H$\\alpha$ absorption\nfeatures in AB Doradus itself and other rapidly rotating late type stars. For\nanother group of stars with somewhat longer periods, we find the short duration\nflux dips to be highly variable on both short and long timescales, with\ngenerally asymmetric flux dip profiles. We believe that these flux dips are due\nto particulate clouds possibly associated with a close-in planet or resulting\nfrom a recent collisional event.\n", "  We generate coherent ultraviolet radiation at 313 nm as the third harmonic of\nan external-cavity diode laser. We use this radiation for laser cooling of\ntrapped beryllium atomic ions and sympathetic cooling of co-trapped\nberyllium-hydride molecular ions. An LBO crystal in an enhancement cavity\ngenerates the second harmonic, and a BBO crystal in a doubly resonant\nenhancement cavity mixes this second harmonic with the fundamental to produce\nthe third harmonic. Each enhancement cavity is preceded by a tapered amplifier\nto increase the fundamental light. The 36-mW output power of this\nall-semiconductor-gain system will enable quantum control of the beryllium\nions' motion.\n", "  Recent works on planetary migration show that the orbital structure of the\nKuiper belt can be very well reproduced if before the onset of the planetary\ninstability Neptune underwent a long-range planetesimal-driven migration up to\n$\\sim$28 au. However, considering that all giant planets should have been\ncaptured in mean motion resonances among themselves during the gas-disk phase,\nit is not clear whether such a very specific evolution for Neptune is possible,\nnor whether the instability could have happened at late times. Here, we first\ninvestigate which initial resonant configuration of the giant planets can be\ncompatible with Neptune being extracted from the resonant chain and migrating\nto $\\sim$28 au before that the planetary instability happened. We address the\nlate instability issue by investigating the conditions where the planets can\nstay in resonance for about 400 My. Our results indicate that this can happen\nonly in the case where the planetesimal disk is beyond a specific minimum\ndistance $\\delta_{stab}$ from Neptune. Then, if there is a sufficient amount of\ndust produced in the planetesimal disk, that drifts inwards, Neptune can enter\nin a slow dust-driven migration phase for hundreds of Mys until it reaches a\ncritical distance $\\delta_{mig}$ from the disk. From that point, faster\nplanetesimal-driven migration takes over and Neptune continues migrating\noutward until the instability happens. We conclude that, although an early\ninstability reproduces more easily the evolution of Neptune required to explain\nthe structure of the Kuiper belt, such evolution is also compatible with a late\ninstability.\n", "  A bright burst, followed by an X-ray tail lasting ~10 ks, was detected during\nan XMM-Newton observation of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 carried out on 2009\nFebruary 3. The burst, also observed by SWIFT/BAT, had a spectrum well fit by\nthe sum of two blackbodies with temperatures of ~4 keV and 10 keV and a fluence\nin the 0.3-150 keV energy range of ~1e-5 erg/cm2. The X-ray tail had a fluence\nof ~4e-8 erg/cm2. Thanks to the knowledge of the distances and relative optical\ndepths of three dust clouds between us and 1E 1547.0-5408, we show that most of\nthe X-rays in the tail can be explained by dust scattering of the burst\nemission, except for the first ~20-30 s. We point out that other X-ray tails\nobserved after strong magnetar bursts may contain a non-negligible contribution\ndue to dust scattering.\n", "  47 Tuc X9 is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) in the globular cluster 47\nTucanae, and was previously thought to be a cataclysmic variable. However,\nMiller-Jones et al. (2015) recently identified a radio counterpart to X9\n(inferring a radio/X-ray luminosity ratio consistent with black hole LMXBs),\nand suggested that the donor star might be a white dwarf. We report\nsimultaneous observations of X9 performed by Chandra, Nustar and Australia\nTelescope Compact Array. We find a clear 28.18$\\pm$0.02 min periodic modulation\nin the Chandra data, which we identify as the orbital period, confirming this\nsystem as an ultracompact X-ray binary. Our X-ray spectral fitting provides\nevidence for photoionized gas having a high oxygen abundance in this system,\nwhich indicates a C/O white dwarf donor. We also identify reflection features\nin the hard X-ray spectrum, making X9 the faintest LMXB to show X-ray\nreflection. We detect a $\\sim$ 6.8 day modulation in the X-ray brightness by a\nfactor of 10, in archival Chandra, Swift, and Rosat data. The simultaneous\nradio/X-ray flux ratio is consistent with either a black hole primary or a\nneutron star primary, if the neutron star is a transitional millisecond pulsar.\nConsidering the measured orbital period (with other evidence of a white dwarf\ndonor), and the lack of transitional millisecond pulsar features in the X-ray\nlight curve, we suggest that this could be the first ultracompact black hole\nX-ray binary identified in our Galaxy.\n", "  We study the pulsational properties of rapidly rotating main-sequence B-type\nstars using linear non-adiabatic analysis of non-radial low-frequency modes\ntaking into account the effect of rotation. We compare the properties of\nprograde sectoral $g$ and retrograde $r$ modes excited by the $\\kappa$\nmechanism at the Fe opacity peak with the newly discovered period-luminosity\nrelation that is obeyed by a group of fast-rotating B-type stars in the young\nopen cluster NGC 3766. The observed relation consists of two sequences in the\nperiod versus magnitude diagram, at periods shorter than 0.5 days. We find that\nthis property is consistent with similar period-luminosity relations predicted\nfor excited sectoral prograde $g$-modes of azimuthal orders $m=-1$ and $m=-2$\nin fast-rotating stars along an isochrone. We further show that some of the\nrapidly rotating stars that have photometric variability with periods longer\nthan a day may be caused by $r$-mode pulsation predicted to be excited in these\nstars. One fast-rotating star, in particular, shows both short and long periods\nthat can be explained by the simultaneous excitation of $g$- and $r$-mode\npulsations in models of fast-rotating stars.\n", "  We studied plane symmetric cosmological model in the presence of quark and\nstrange quark matter with the help of f(R,T) theory. To decipher solutions of\nPlane symmetric space-time, we used power law relation between scale factor and\ndeceleration parameter. We considered the special law of variation of Hubble's\nparameter proposed by Berman (Nuovo Cimento B 74, 182, 1983) which yields\nconstant deceleration parameter. We also discussed the physical behavior of the\nsolutions by using some physical parameters.\n", "  We present a model of blazar variability that can both reproduce smooth large\npolarization angle swings, and at the same time allow for the seemingly random\nbehaviour of synchrotron fluxes, polarization fraction and, occasionally,\n$\\pi$/2 polarization jumps. We associate blazar flaring activity with a jet\ncarrying helical magnetic fields and propagating along a variable direction\n(and possibly with a changing bulk Lorentz factor). The model predicts that for\nvarious jet trajectories (i) EVPA can experience large smooth temporal\nvariations while at the same time polarization fraction ($\\Pi$) can be highly\nvariable; (ii) $\\Pi \\sim 0$ near sudden EVPA jumps of 90$^{\\circ}$, but can\nalso remain constant for large, smoother EVPA swings; (iii) the total angle of\nEVPA rotation can be arbitrary large; (iv) intensity I is usually maximal at\npoints of fastest EVPA changes, but can have a minimum. Thus, even for a\nregular, deterministic motion of a steadily emitting jet the observed\nproperties can vary in a non-monotonic and/or seemingly stochastic way.\nIntrinsic fluctuations of the emissivity will further complicated the intensity\nprofiles, but are expected to preserve the polarization structure.\n", "  The so-called unidentified infrared emission (UIE) features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7,\n8.6, and 11.3 $\\mu$m ubiquitously seen in a wide variety of astrophysical\nregions are generally attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nmolecules. Astronomical PAHs may have an aliphatic component as revealed by the\ndetection in many UIE sources of the aliphatic C-H stretching feature at 3.4\n$\\mu$m. The ratio of the observed intensity of the 3.4 $\\mu$m feature to that\nof the 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C-H feature allows one to estimate the aliphatic\nfraction of the UIE carriers. This requires the knowledge of the intrinsic\noscillator strengths of the 3.3 $\\mu$m aromatic C-H stretch ($A_{3.3}$) and the\n3.4 $\\mu$m aliphatic C-H stretch ($A_{3.4}$). Lacking experimental data on\n$A_{3.3}$ and $A_{3.4}$ for the UIE candidate materials, one often has to rely\non quantum-chemical computations. Although the second-order Moller-Plesset\n(MP2) perturbation theory with a large basis set is more accurate than the\nB3LYP density functional theory, MP2 is computationally very demanding and\nimpractical for large molecules. Based on methylated PAHs, we show here that,\nby scaling the band strengths computed at an inexpensive level (e.g.,\nB3LYP/6-31G*) we are able to obtain band strengths as accurate as that computed\nat far more expensive levels (e.g., MP2/6-311+G(3df,3pd)).\n", "  We present the results of our power spectral analysis for the BL Lac object\nPKS 0735+178 utilizing the Fermi-LAT survey at high-energy $\\gamma$-rays,\nseveral ground-based optical telescopes, and single-dish radio telescopes\noperating at GHz frequencies. The novelty of our approach is that, by combining\nlong-term and densely sampled intra-night light curves in the optical regime,\nwe were able to construct for the first time the optical power spectrum of the\nblazar for a time domain extending from 23 years down to minutes. Our analysis\nreveals that: (i) the optical variability is consistent with a pure red noise,\nfor which the power spectral density can well be approximated by a single\npower-law throughout the entire time domain probed; (ii) the slope of power\nspectral density at high-energy $\\gamma$-rays ($\\sim 1$), is significantly\nflatter than that found at radio and optical frequencies ($\\sim 2$) within the\ncorresponding time variability range; (iii) for the derived power spectra we\ndid not detect any low-frequency flattening, nor do we see any evidence for\ncut-offs at the highest frequencies down to the noise floor levels due to\nmeasurement uncertainties. We interpret our findings in terms of a model where\nthe blazar variability is generated by the underlying single stochastic process\n(at radio and optical frequencies), or a linear superposition of such processes\n(in the $\\gamma$-ray regime). Along with the detailed PSD analysis, we also\npresent the results of our extended (1998-2015) intra-night optical monitoring\nprogram and newly acquired optical photo-polarimetric data for the source.\n", "  We analyze new far-ultraviolet spectra of 13 quasars from the z~0.2 COS-Halos\nsurvey that cover the HI Lyman limit of 14 circumgalactic medium (CGM) systems.\nThese data yield precise estimates or more constraining limits than previous\nCOS-Halos measurements on the HI column densities NHI. We then apply a\nMonte-Carlo Markov Chain approach on 32 systems from COS-Halos to estimate the\nmetallicity of the cool (T~10^4K) CGM gas that gives rise to low-ionization\nstate metal lines, under the assumption of photoionization equilibrium with the\nextragalactic UV background. The principle results are: (1) the CGM of field L*\ngalaxies exhibits a declining HI surface density with impact parameter Rperp\n(at >99.5%$ confidence), (2) the transmission of ionizing radiation through CGM\ngas alone is 70+/-7%; (3) the metallicity distribution function of the cool CGM\nis unimodal with a median of 1/3 Z_Sun and a 95% interval from ~1/50 Z_Sun to\nover 3x solar. The incidence of metal poor (<1/100 Z_Sun) gas is low, implying\nany such gas discovered along quasar sightlines is typically unrelated to L*\ngalaxies; (4) we find an unexpected increase in gas metallicity with declining\nNHI (at >99.9% confidence) and, therefore, also with increasing Rperp. The high\nmetallicity at large radii implies early enrichment; (5) A non-parametric\nestimate of the cool CGM gas mass is M_CGM_cool = 9.2 +/- 4.3 10^10 Msun, which\ntogether with new mass estimates for the hot CGM may resolve the galactic\nmissing baryons problem. Future analyses of halo gas should focus on the\nunderlying astrophysics governing the CGM, rather than processes that simply\nexpel the medium from the halo.\n", "  We decompose the observed 7.7 $\\mu$m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)\nemission complexes in a large sample of over 7000 mid-infrared spectra of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) using spectral cubes observed with the Spitzer/IRS-SL\ninstrument. In order to fit the 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH emission complex we invoke four\nGaussian components which are found to be very stable in terms of their peak\npositions and widths across all of our spectra, and subsequently define a\ndecomposition with fixed parameters which gives an acceptable fit for all the\nspectra. We see a strong environmental dependence on the inter-relationships\nbetween our band fluxes - in the HII regions all four components are\ninter-correlated, while in the reflection nebulae (RNe) the inner and outer\npairs of bands correlate in the same manner as previously seen for NGC~2023. We\nshow that this effect arises because the RNe maps are dominated by strongly\nirradiated PDR emission, while the much larger HII region maps are dominated by\nemission from regions much more distant from the exciting stars, leading to\nsubtly different spectral behavior. Further investigation of this dichotomy\nreveals that the ratio of two of these components (centered at 7.6 and 7.8\n$\\mu$m) is linearly related to the UV field intensity (log G$_0$). We find that\nthis relationship does not hold for sources consisting of circumstellar\nmaterial, which are known to have variable 7.7 $\\mu$m spectral profiles.\n", "  The intermittent small-scale structure of turbulence governs energy\ndissipation in many astrophysical plasmas and is often believed to have\nuniversal properties for sufficiently large systems. In this work, we argue\nthat small-scale turbulence in accretion disks is universal in the sense that\nit is insensitive to the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and background\nshear, and therefore indistinguishable from standard homogeneous\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at small scales. We investigate the\nintermittency of current density, vorticity, and energy dissipation in\nnumerical simulations of incompressible MHD turbulence driven by the MRI in a\nshearing box. We find that the simulations exhibit a similar degree of\nintermittency as in standard MHD turbulence. We perform a statistical analysis\nof intermittent dissipative structures and find that energy dissipation is\nconcentrated in thin sheet-like structures that span a wide range of scales up\nto the box size. We show that these structures exhibit strikingly similar\nstatistical properties to those in standard MHD turbulence. Additionally, the\nstructures are oriented in the toroidal direction with a characteristic tilt of\napproximately 17.5 degrees, implying an effective guide field in that\ndirection.\n", "  Absorption by carbon monoxide in the spectrum of quasar SDSS\nJ000015.16+004833.2 is investigated in order to derive a constraint on the\ntemporal variation of the proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu. The spectrum was\nrecorded using VLT/UVES, and it was partially corrected for long-range\nwavelength scale distortions using the supercalibration technique. Eight\nvibrational CO singlet-singlet bands belonging to the A-X electronic absorption\nsystem, and the perturbing d3-X(5, 0) singlet-triplet band are detected in the\ndamped Lyman-alpha system at z =2.52. The spectra are modelled using a\ncomprehensive fitting technique, resulting in a final value of Dmu/mu=(1.8 +/-\n2.2 +/- 0.4)x10e(-5), which is consistent with no variation over a look-back\ntime of 11.2 Gyrs.\n", "  Only a small number of galactic open clusters survives for longer than few\nhundred million years. Longer lifetimes are routinely explained in term of\nlarger initial masses, particularly quiet orbits, and off-plane birth-places.\nWe derive in this work the actual mass of NGC 4337, one of the few open\nclusters in the Milky Way inner disk that managed to survive for about 1.5 Gyr.\nWe derive its mass in two different ways. First, we exploit an unpublished\nphotometric data set in the UBVI passbands to estimate -using star counts- the\ncluster luminosity profile, and luminosity and mass function, and hence its\nactual mass both from the luminosity profile and from the mass function.This\ndata-set is also used to infer crucial cluster parameters, as the cluster\nhalf-mass radius and distance. Second, we make use of a large survey of cluster\nstar radial velocities to derive dynamical estimates for the cluster mass.\nUnder the assumption of virial equilibrium and neglecting the external\ngravitational field leads to values for the mass significantly larger than\nthose obtained by mean of observed density distribution or with the mass\nfunction but still marginally compatible with the inferred values of the\ninvisible mass in form of both low mass stars or remnants of high mass stars in\nthe cluster. Finally, we derive the cluster initial mass by computing the mass\nloss experienced by the cluster during its lifetime, and adopting the various\nestimates of the actual mass.\n", "  This study investigates the impact of the fluctuations in the extra galactic\nbackground light (EBL) on the attenuation of the hard $\\gamma$-ray spectra of\ndistant blazars. EBL fluctuations occur on the scales up to 100 Mpc and are\ncaused by clustering of galaxies. The EBL photons interact with high energy\n$\\gamma$-rays via the electron-positron pair production mechanism: $\\gamma +\n\\gamma' \\rightarrow e^+ + e^-$. The attenuation of $\\gamma$-rays depends on\ntheir energy and the density of the intervening EBL photon field. Using a\nsimple model for the evolution of the mean EBL photon density, we implement an\nanalytical description of the EBL fluctuations. We find that the amplitudes of\nthe EBL energy density can vary by $\\pm 1\\%$ as a function of environment. The\nEBL fluctuations lead to mild alterations of the optical depth or equivalently\nthe transmissivity for $\\gamma$-rays from distant blazars. Our model predicts\nmaximum changes of $\\pm 10\\%$ in the $\\gamma$-ray transmissivity. However, this\ntranslates into marginal differences in the power law slopes of currently\nobserved $\\gamma$-ray spectra. The slopes of deabsorbed $\\gamma$-ray spectra\ndiffer by not more than $\\pm 1\\%$ if EBL fluctuations are included.\n", "  We present results from a 30 ksec Chandra observation of the important\nstarburst galaxy NGC 2782, covering the 0.3-10keV energy band. We find evidence\nof a superwind of small extent, that is likely in an early stage of\ndevelopment. We find a total of 27 X-ray point sources within a region of\nradius 2$D_{25}$ of the galaxy centre and which are likely associated with the\ngalaxy. Of these, 13 are ULXs ($L_{X}\\geq 10^{39}~ erg s ^{-1}$) and a number\nhave likely counterparts. The X-ray luminosities of the ULX candidates are\n$1.2-3.9\\times10^{39}~ erg s ^{-1}$. NGC2782 seems to have an unusually large\nnumber of ULXs. Central diffuse X-ray emission extending to ~ 3kpc from the\nnuclear region has been detected. We also find an X-ray structure to the south\nof the nucleus, coincident with H{\\alpha} filaments and with a 5 GHz radio\nsource. We interpret this as a blow-out region of a forming superwind. This\nX-ray bubble has a total luminosity (0.3-10 keV) of $5\\times10^{39}erg s ^{-1}$\n(around $15\\%$ of the total luminosity of the extended emission), and an\ninferred wind mass of $1.5\\times10^{6}$ M$_\\odot$. We also discuss the nature\nof the central X-ray source in NGC2782, and conclude that it is likely a\nlow-luminosity AGN (LLAGN), with a total X-ray luminosity of\n$L_{X}=6\\times10^{40}~erg s ^{-1}$ with strong Fe line emission at 6.4 keV.\n", "  The broadening of the hydrogen lines during flares is thought to result from\nincreased charge (electron, proton) density in the flare chromosphere. However,\ndisagreements between theory and modeling prescriptions have precluded an\naccurate diagnostic of the degree of ionization and compression resulting from\nflare heating in the chromosphere. To resolve this issue, we have incorporated\nthe unified theory of electric pressure broadening of the hydrogen lines into\nthe non-LTE radiative transfer code RH. This broadening prescription produces a\nmuch more realistic spectrum of the quiescent, A0 star Vega compared to the\nanalytic approximations used as a damping parameter in the Voigt profiles. We\ntest recent radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of the atmospheric\nresponse to high nonthermal electron beam fluxes with the new broadening\nprescription and find that the Balmer lines are over-broadened at the densest\ntimes in the simulations. Adding many simultaneously heated and cooling model\nloops as a \"multithread\" model improves the agreement with the observations. We\nrevisit the three-component phenomenological flare model of the YZ CMi\nMegaflare using recent and new RHD models. The evolution of the broadening,\nline flux ratios, and continuum flux ratios are well-reproduced by a\nmultithread model with high-flux nonthermal electron beam heating, an extended\ndecay phase model, and a \"hot spot\" atmosphere heated by an ultrarelativistic\nelectron beam with reasonable filling factors: 0.1%, 1%, and 0.1% of the\nvisible stellar hemisphere, respectively. The new modeling motivates future\nwork to understand the origin of the extended gradual phase emission.\n", "  Purpose of this work is study evolution of magnetized rotating filamentary\nmolecular cloud's. We will consider cylindrical symmetric filamentary molecular\nclouds at the early stage of evolution. For the first time we consider rotation\nof filamentary molecular in presence of an axial and azimuthal magnetic field\nwithout any assumption of density and magnetic functions. We show that in\naddition to decreasing of radial collapse velocity, the rotational velocity\nalso affected by magnetic field. Existence of rotation yields to fragment of\nfilament. Moreover, we show that the magnetic field have significant effect on\nthe fragmentation of filamentary molecular clouds.\n", "  The location of radio pulsars in the period-period derivative (P-Pdot) plane\nhas been a key diagnostic tool since the early days of pulsar astronomy. Of\nparticular importance is how pulsars evolve through the P-Pdot diagram with\ntime. Here we show that the decay of the inclination angle (alpha-dot) between\nthe magnetic and rotation axes plays a critical role. In particular, alpha-dot\nstrongly impacts on the braking torque, an effect which has been largely\nignored in previous work. We carry out simulations which include a negative\nalpha-dot term, and show that it is possible to reproduce the observational\nP-Pdot diagram without the need for either pulsars with long birth periods or\nmagnetic field decay. Our best model indicates a birth rate of 1 radio pulsar\nper century and a total Galactic population of ~20000 pulsars beaming towards\nEarth.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the [CII] fine structure line and the\nunderlying far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum emission in J1120+0641, the most\ndistant quasar currently known (z=7.1). We also present observations targeting\nthe CO(2-1), CO(7-6) and [CI] 369 micron lines in the same source obtained at\nthe VLA and PdBI. We find a [CII] line flux of F_[CII]=1.11+/-0.10 Jy km/s and\na continuum flux density of S_227GHz=0.53+/-0.04 mJy/beam, consistent with\nprevious unresolved measurements. No other source is detected in continuum or\n[CII] emission in the field covered by ALMA (~25\"). At the resolution of our\nALMA observations (0.23\", or 1.2 kpc, a factor ~70 smaller beam area compared\nto previous measurements), we find that the majority of the emission is very\ncompact: a high fraction (~80%) of the total line and continuum flux is\nassociated with a region 1-1.5 kpc in diameter. The remaining ~20% of the\nemission is distributed over a larger area with radius <4 kpc. The [CII]\nemission does not exhibit ordered motion on kpc-scales: applying the virial\ntheorem yields an upper limit on the dynamical mass of the host galaxy of\n(4.3+/-0.9)x10^10 M_sun, only ~20x higher than the central black hole. The\nother targeted lines (CO(2-1), CO(7-6) and [CI]) are not detected, but the\nlimits of the line ratios with respect to the [CII] emission imply that the\nheating in the quasar host is dominated by star formation, and not by the\naccreting black hole. The star-formation rate implied by the FIR continuum is\n105-340 M_sun/yr, with a resulting star-formation rate surface density of\n~100-350 M_sun/yr/kpc^2, well below the value for Eddington-accretion-limited\nstar formation.\n", "  Verlinde (2016) has recently proposed that spacetime and gravity may emerge\nfrom an underlying microscopic theory. In a de Sitter spacetime, such emergent\ngravity (EG) contains an additional gravitational force due to dark energy,\nwhich may explain the mass discrepancies observed in galactic systems without\nthe need of dark matter. For a point mass, EG is equivalent to Modified\nNewtonian Dynamics (MOND). We show that this equivalence does not hold for\nfinite-size galaxies: there are significant differences between EG and MOND in\nthe inner regions of galaxies. We confront theoretical predictions with the\nempirical Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR). We find that (i) EG is consistent\nwith the observed RAR only if we substantially decrease the fiducial stellar\nmass-to-light ratios; the resulting values are in tension with other\nastronomical estimates; (ii) EG predicts that the residuals around the RAR\nshould correlate with radius; such residual correlation is not observed.\n", "  It was recently proposed that the effects usually attributed to particle dark\nmatter on galaxy scales are due to the displacement of dark energy by baryonic\nmatter, a paradigm known as emergent gravity. This formalism leads to\npredictions similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) in spherical\nsymmetry, but not quite identical. In particular, it leads to a well defined\ntransition between the Newtonian and the modified gravitational regimes, a\ntransition depending on both the Newtonian acceleration and its first\nderivative with respect to radius. Under the hypothesis of the applicability of\nthis transition to aspherical systems, we investigate whether it can reproduce\nobserved galaxy rotation curves. We conclude that the formula leads to\nmarginally acceptable fits with strikingly low best-fit distances, low stellar\nmass-to-light ratios, and a low Hubble constant. In particular, some unobserved\nwiggles are produced in rotation curves because of the dependence of the\ntransition on the derivative of the Newtonian acceleration, leading, even in\nthe most favorable case, to systematically less good fits than MOND. Then,\napplying the predicted transition from emergent gravity in a regime where it\nshould a priori be applicable, i.e. in spherical symmetry and outside of the\nbulk of matter, we show that the predictions for the secular advances of Solar\nSystem planets' perihelia are discrepant with the data by seven orders of\nmagnitude, ruling out the present emergent gravity weak-field formula with high\nconfidence.\n", "  We obtained follow-up HST observations of the seven low surface brightness\ngalaxies discovered with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array in the field of the\nmassive spiral galaxy M101. Out of the seven galaxies, only three were resolved\ninto stars and are potentially associated with the M101 group at $D=7\\text{\nMpc}$. Based on HST ACS photometry in the broad F606W and F814W filters, we use\na maximum likelihood algorithm to locate the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB)\nin galaxy color-magnitude diagrams. Distances are $6.38^{+0.35}_{-0.35},\n6.87^{+0.21}_{-0.30}$ and $6.52^{+0.25}_{-0.27} \\text{ Mpc}$ and we confirm\nthat they are members of the M101 group. Combining the three confirmed low\nluminosity satellites with previous results for brighter group members, we find\nthe M101 galaxy group to be a sparsely populated galaxy group consisting of\nseven group members, down to $M_V = -9.2 \\text{ mag}$. We compare the M101\ncumulative luminosity function to that of the Milky Way and M31. We find that\nthey are remarkably similar; In fact, the cumulative luminosity function of the\nM101 group gets even flatter for fainter magnitudes, and we show that the M101\ngroup might exhibit the two known small-scale flaws in the\n$\\Lambda\\textrm{CDM}$ model, namely `the missing satellite' problem and the\n`too big to fail' problem. Kinematic measurements of M101$'$s satellite\ngalaxies are required to determine whether the `too big to fail' problem does\nin fact exist in the M101 group.\n", "  The observationally derived Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation slopes differ\nfrom study to study, ranging from sub-linear to super-linear. We investigate\nthe KS-relation variety (slope and normalization) as a function of integrated\nintensity ratio, R31=CO(J=3-2)/CO(J=1-0) using spatially resolved CO(J=1-0),\nCO(J=3-2), HI, Ha and 24um data of three nearby spiral galaxies (NGC3627,\nNGC5055 and M83). We find that (1) the slopes for each subsample with a fixed\nR31 are shallower but the slope for all datasets combined becomes steeper, (2)\nnormalizations for high R31 subsamples tend to be high, (3) R31 correlates with\nstar-formation efficiency, thus the KS relation depends on the distribution in\nR31-Sigma_gas space of the samples: no Sigma_gas dependence of R31 results in a\nlinear slope of the KS relation whereas a positive correlation between\nSigma_gas and R31 results in a super-linear slope of the KS relation, and (4)\nR31-Sigma_gas distributions are different from galaxy to galaxy and within a\ngalaxy: galaxies with prominent galactic structure tend to have large R31 and\nSigma_gas. Our results suggest that the formation efficiency of star-forming\ncloud from molecular gas is different among galaxies as well as within a galaxy\nand is one of the key factors inducing the variety in galactic KS relation.\n", "  Inorganic carbon, in the form of allogenic (transported) and pedogenic (soil)\ncarbonates in semi-arid soils, may comprise an important carbon sink. Carbon\ndioxide, CO2, originating from the atmosphere and exhaled by tree roots into\nthe soil, may be hydrated by soil water within the unsaturated zone (USZ) of\nsemi-arid soils to produce the carbonic acid (H2CO3) solutes HCO3- bicarbonate\nand H+ Hydrogen ion. This H+ may then dissolve relict soil CaCO3 carbonate\n(calcite), to release Ca+2 calcium cations and more HCO3- bicarbonate. When\nconditions allow, one mole of Ca+2 and two moles of HCO3- combine to\nprecipitate one mole of calcite, and to release one mole of CO2: Ca+2 + 2HCO3-\n--> CaCO3 + CO2 + H2O. However, it has been claimed that such carbonates do not\nsequester significant amounts of present day atmospheric CO2. The reasons given\nwere that they originate in part from the pre-existing limestone; and that for\nevery mole of calcite precipitated, one mole of CO2 may be liberated to the\natmosphere. It was argued that only if the Ca+2 cation is derived from a\nnon-carbonate source can sequestration be assumed. We have tested these\nassumptions under field conditions at two semi-arid sites in Israel. We found\nthat bicarbonate, originating from root exhalation, is depleted and is\nincorporated within the USZ as carbonates precipitate. Thus, a net\nsequestration of atmospheric CO2 does occur under semi-arid forests. Moreover,\nmost of the CO2 liberated in the precipitation reaction may remain in the soil.\nAnd Ca+2 in the sediment may also be supplied from sources other than\npre-existing calcite. Forestation can therefore augment pedogenic carbonate\nformation. By extrapolating our data globally, we suggest that worldwide\nsemi-arid forests (existing and to be planted) may sequester 5-20% of the\ncurrent annual anthropogenic increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide as\npedogenic carbonate.\n", "  We present long-slit optical spectra of 12 edge-on low surface brightness\ngalaxies (LSBGs) positioned along their major axes. After performing reddening\ncorrections for the emission-line fluxes measured from the extracted integrated\nspectra, we measured the gas-phase metallicities of our LSBG sample using both\nthe [NII]/Ha and the R_23 diagnostics. Both sets of oxygen abundances show good\nagreement with each other, giving a median value of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.26 dex.\nIn the luminosity-metallicity plot, our LSBG sample is consistent with the\nbehavior of normal galaxies. In the mass-metallicity diagram, our LSBG sample\nhas lower metallicities for lower stellar mass, similar to normal galaxies. The\nstellar masses estimated from z-band luminosities are comparable to those of\nprominent spirals. In a plot of the gas mass fraction versus metallicity, our\nLSBG sample generally agrees with other samples in the high gas mass fraction\nspace. Additionally, we have studied stellar populations of 3 LSBGs which have\nrelatively reliable spectral continua and high signal-to-noise ratios, and\nqualitatively conclude that they have a potential dearth of stars with ages <1\nGyr instead of being dominated by stellar populations with ages >1Gyr.\nRegarding the chemical evolution of our sample, the LSBG data appear to allow\nfor up to 30 % metal loss, but we cannot completely rule out the closed-box\nmodel. Additionally, we find evidence that our galaxies retain up to about 3\ntimes as much of their metals compared with dwarfs, consistent with metal\nretention being related to galaxy mass. In conclusion, our data support the\nview that LSBGs are probably just normal disk galaxies continuously extending\nto the low end of surface brightness.\n", "  In this paper, we use stacking analysis to trace the mass-growth, colour\nevolution, and structural evolution of present-day massive galaxies\n($\\log(M_{*}/M_{\\odot})=11.5$) out to $z=5$. We utilize the exceptional depth\nand area of the latest UltraVISTA data release, combined with the depth and\nunparalleled seeing of CANDELS to gather a large, mass-selected sample of\ngalaxies in the NIR (rest-frame optical to UV). Progenitors of present-day\nmassive galaxies are identified via an evolving cumulative number density\nselection, which accounts for the effects of merging to correct for the\nsystematic biases introduced using a fixed cumulative number density selection,\nand find progenitors grow in stellar mass by $\\approx1.5~\\mathrm{dex}$ since\n$z=5$. Using stacking, we analyze the structural parameters of the progenitors\nand find that most of the stellar mass content in the central regions was in\nplace by $z\\sim2$, and while galaxies continue to assemble mass at all radii,\nthe outskirts experience the largest fractional increase in stellar mass.\nHowever, we find evidence of significant stellar mass build up at\n$r<3~\\mathrm{kpc}$ beyond $z>4$ probing an era of significant mass assembly in\nthe interiors of present day massive galaxies. We also compare mass assembly\nfrom progenitors in this study to the EAGLE simulation and find qualitatively\nsimilar assembly with $z$ at $r<3~\\mathrm{kpc}$. We identify $z\\sim1.5$ as a\ndistinct epoch in the evolution of massive galaxies where progenitors\ntransitioned from growing in mass and size primarily through in-situ star\nformation in disks to a period of efficient growth in $r_{e}$ consistent with\nthe minor merger scenario.\n", "  We obtain the solutions of the generic bilinear master equation for a quantum\noscillator with constant coefficients in the Gaussian form. The\nwell-behavedness and positive semidefiniteness of the stationary states could\nbe characterized by a three-dimensional Minkowski vector. By requiring the\nstationary states to satisfy a factorized condition, we obtain a generic class\nof master equations that includes the well-known ones and their\ngeneralizations, some of which are completely positive. A further subset of the\nmaster equations with the Gibbs states as stationary states is also obtained.\nFor master equations with not completely positive generators, an analysis on\nthe stationary states suggests conditions on the coefficients of the master\nequations that generate positive evolution for a given initial state.\n", "  In extending our spectroscopic program, which targets sources drawn from the\nInternational Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) Catalog, we have obtained\nspectra for about 160 compact flat-spectrum radio sources and determined\nredshifts for 112 quasars and radio galaxies. A further 14 sources with\nfeatureless spectra have been classified as BL Lac objects. Spectra were\nobtained at three telescopes: the 3.58-m ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT),\nand the two 8.2-m Gemini telescopes in Hawaii and Chile. While most of the\nsources are powerful quasars, a significant fraction of radio galaxies is also\nincluded from the list of non-defining ICRF radio sources.\n", "  We present a detailed analysis of the white dwarf luminosity functions\nderived from the local 40 pc sample and the deep proper motion catalog of Munn\net al (2014, 2017). Many of the previous studies ignored the contribution of\nthick disk white dwarfs to the Galactic disk luminosity function, which results\nin an erronous age measurement. We demonstrate that the ratio of thick/thin\ndisk white dwarfs is roughly 20\\% in the local sample. Simultaneously fitting\nfor both disk components, we derive ages of 6.8-7.0 Gyr for the thin disk and\n8.7 $\\pm$ 0.1 Gyr for the thick disk from the local 40 pc sample. Similarly, we\nderive ages of 7.4-8.2 Gyr for the thin disk and 9.5-9.9 Gyr for the thick disk\nfrom the deep proper motion catalog, which shows no evidence of a deviation\nfrom a constant star formation rate in the past 2.5 Gyr. We constrain the time\ndifference between the onset of star formation in the thin disk and the thick\ndisk to be $1.6^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ Gyr. The faint end of the luminosity function\nfor the halo white dwarfs is less constrained, resulting in an age estimate of\n$12.5^{+1.4}_{-3.4}$ Gyr for the Galactic inner halo. This is the first time\nages for all three major components of the Galaxy are obtained from a sample of\nfield white dwarfs that is large enough to contain significant numbers of disk\nand halo objects. The resultant ages agree reasonably well with the age\nestimates for the oldest open and globular clusters.\n", "  We present a chemical abundance analysis of a metal-poor star, ROA 276, in\nthe stellar system omega Centauri. We confirm that this star has an unusually\nhigh [Sr/Ba] abundance ratio. Additionally, ROA 276 exhibits remarkably high\nabundance ratios, [X/Fe], for all elements from Cu to Mo along with normal\nabundance ratios for the elements from Ba to Pb. The chemical abundance pattern\nof ROA 276, relative to a primordial omega Cen star ROA 46, is best fit by a\nfast-rotating low-metallicity massive stellar model of 20 Msun, [Fe/H] = -1.8,\nand an initial rotation 0.4 times the critical value; no other nucleosynthetic\nsource can match the neutron-capture element distribution. ROA 276 arguably\noffers the most definitive proof to date that fast-rotating massive stars\ncontributed to the production of heavy elements in the early Universe.\n", "  Continuum (\"White-light\", WL) emission dominates the energetics of flares.\nFilter-based observations, such as the IRIS SJI 2832 filter, show WL-like\nbrightenings during flares, but it is unclear whether the emission arises from\nreal continuum emission or enhanced spectral lines, possibly turning into\nemission. The difficulty in filter-based observations, contrary to spectral\nobservations, is to determine which processes contribute to the observed\nbrightening during flares. Here we determine the contribution of the Balmer\ncontinuum and the spectral line emission to IRIS' SJI 2832 emission by\nanalyzing the appropriate passband in simultaneous IRIS NUV spectra. We find\nthat spectral line emission can contribute up to 100% to the observed SJI\nemission, that the relative contributions usually temporally vary, and that the\nhighest SJI enhancements that are observed are most likely because of the\nBalmer continuum. We conclude that care should be taken when calling SJI 2832 a\ncontinuum filter during flares, because the influence of the lines on the\nemission can be significant.\n", "  We present the 78-ks Chandra observations of the $z=6.4$ quasar SDSS\nJ1148+5251. The source is clearly detected in the energy range 0.3-7 keV with\n42 counts (with a significance $\\gtrsim9\\sigma$). The X-ray spectrum is\nbest-fitted by a power-law with photon index $\\Gamma=1.9$ absorbed by a gas\ncolumn density of $\\rm N_{\\rm H}=2.0^{+2.0}_{-1.5}\\times10^{23}\\,\\rm cm^{-2}$.\nWe measure an intrinsic luminosity at 2-10 keV and 10-40 keV equal to $\\sim\n1.5\\times 10^{45}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, comparable with luminous local and\nintermediate-redshift quasar properties. Moreover, the X-ray to optical\npower-law slope value ($\\alpha_{\\rm OX}=-1.76\\pm 0.14$) of J1148 is consistent\nwith the one found in quasars with similar rest-frame 2500 \\AA ~luminosity\n($L_{\\rm 2500}\\sim 10^{32}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$\\AA$^{-1}$). Then we use Chandra data\nto test a physically motivated model that computes the intrinsic X-ray flux\nemitted by a quasar starting from the properties of the powering black hole and\nassuming that X-ray emission is attenuated by intervening, metal-rich ($Z\\geq\n\\rm Z_{\\odot}$) molecular clouds distributed on $\\sim$kpc scales in the host\ngalaxy. Our analysis favors a black hole mass $M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 3\\times 10^9 \\rm\nM_\\odot$ and a molecular hydrogen mass $M_{\\rm H_2}\\sim 2\\times 10^{10} \\rm\nM_\\odot$, in good agreement with estimates obtained from previous studies. We\nfinally discuss strengths and limits of our analysis.\n", "  We have investigated the probability of temporary capture of asteroids in\neccentric orbits by a planet in a circular or an eccentric orbit through\nanalytical and numerical calculations. We found that in the limit of the\ncircular orbit, the capture probability is $\\sim 0.1\\%$ of encounters to the\nplanet's Hill sphere, independent of planetary mass and semimajor axis. In\ngeneral, the temporary capture becomes more difficult as the planet's\neccentricity ($e_{\\rm p}$) increases. We found that the capture probability is\nalmost independent of $e_{\\rm p}$ until a critical value ($e_{\\rm p}^{\\rm c}$)\nthat is given by $\\simeq$ 5 times the Hill radius scaled by the planet's\nsemimajor axis. For $e_{\\rm p} > e_{\\rm p}^{\\rm c}$, the probability decreases\napproximately in proportion to $e_{\\rm p}^{-1}$. The current orbital\neccentricity of Mars is several times larger than $e_{\\rm p}^{\\rm c}$. However,\nsince the range of secular change in Martian eccentricity overlaps $e_{\\rm\np}^{\\rm c}$, the capture of minor bodies by the past Mars is not ruled out.\n", "  In the article by Ma~\\emph{et al.}~[Phys.~Rev.~A {\\bf 94}, 052709 (2016)],\n$\\gamma$-ray spectra for positron annihilation on molecules were calculated in\nthe independent-particle approximation with the positron wavefunction set to\nunity. Based on comparisons with experimental data they concluded that inner\nvalence electrons play a dominant role in positron annihilation. These\nconclusions are incorrect and resulted from fallacious analysis that ignored\nthe known effect of the positron wavefunction on the spectra.\n", "  There are many proposed mechanisms driving the morphological transformation\nof disk galaxies to elliptical galaxies. In this paper, we determine if the\nobserved transformation in low mass groups can be explained by the merger\nhistories of galaxies. We measured the group mass-morphology relation for\ngroups from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly group catalogue with masses from\n10$^{11}$ - 10$^{15}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Contrary to previous studies, the fraction\nof elliptical galaxies in our more complete group sample increases\nsignificantly with group mass across the full range of group mass. The\nelliptical fraction increases at a rate of 0.163$\\pm$0.012 per dex of group\nmass for groups more massive than 10$^{12.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$. If we allow for\nuncertainties in the observed group masses, our results are consistent with a\ncontinuous increase in elliptical fraction from group masses as low as\n10$^{11}$M$_{\\odot}$. We tested if this observed relation is consistent with\nmerger activity using a GADGET-2 dark matter simulation of the galaxy groups.\nWe specified that a simulated galaxy would be transformed to an elliptical\nmorphology either if it experienced a major merger or if its cumulative mass\ngained from minor mergers exceeded 30 per cent of its final mass. We then\ncalculated a group mass-morphology relation for the simulations. The position\nand slope of the simulated relation were consistent with the observational\nrelation, with a gradient of 0.184$\\pm$0.010 per dex of group mass. These\nresults demonstrate a strong correlation between the frequency of merger events\nand disk-to-elliptical galaxy transformation in galaxy group environments.\n", "  The $\\kappa$-mechanism has been successful in explaining the origin of\nobserved oscillations of many types of \"classical\" pulsating variable stars.\nHere we examine quantitatively if that same process is prominent enough to\nexcite the potential global oscillations within Jupiter, whose energy flux is\npowered by gravitational collapse rather than nuclear fusion. Additionally, we\nexamine whether external radiative forcing, i.e. starlight, could be a driver\nfor global oscillations in hot Jupiters orbiting various main-sequence stars at\ndefined orbital semimajor axes. Using planetary models generated by the Modules\nfor Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) and nonadiabatic oscillation\ncalculations, we confirm that Jovian oscillations cannot be driven via the\n$\\kappa$-mechanism. However, we do show that in hot Jupiters oscillations can\nlikely be excited via the suppression of radiative cooling due to external\nradiation given a large enough stellar flux and the absence of a significant\noscillatory damping zone within the planet. This trend seems to not be\ndependent on the planetary mass. In future observations we can thus expect that\nsuch planets may be pulsating, thereby giving greater insight into the internal\nstructure of these bodies.\n", "  A recent analysis of the Supernova Ia data claims a 'marginal'\n($\\sim3\\sigma$) evidence for a cosmic acceleration. This result has been\ncomplemented with a non-accelerating $R_{h}=ct$ cosmology, which was presented\nas a valid alternative to the $\\Lambda$CDM model. In this paper, we use the\nsame analysis to show that a non-marginal evidence for acceleration is actually\nfound. We compare the standard Friedmann models to the $R_{h}=ct$ cosmology by\ncomplementing SN Ia data with the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Gamma Ray\nBursts and Observational Hubble datasets. We also study the power-law model\nwhich is a functional generalisation of $R_{h}=ct$. We find that the evidence\nfor late-time acceleration is beyond refutable at a 4.56$\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel from SN Ia data alone, and at an even stronger confidence level\n($5.38\\sigma$) from our joint analysis. Also, the non-accelerating $R_{h}=ct$\nmodel fails to statistically compare with the $\\Lambda$CDM having a\n$\\Delta(\\text{AIC})\\sim30$.\n", "  We describe the capability of a high-resolution three-dimensional digital\nimage correlation (DIC) system specifically designed for high strain-rate\nexperiments. Utilising open-source camera calibration and two-dimensional DIC\ntools within the MATLAB framework, a single camera three-dimensional DIC system\nwith submicron displacement resolution is demonstrated. The system has a\ndisplacement accuracy of up to 200 times the optical spatial resolution,\nmatching that achievable with commercial systems. The surface strain\ncalculations are benchmarked against commercially available software before\nbeing deployed on quasi-static tests showcasing the ability to detect both in-\nand out-of-plane motion. Finally, a high strain-rate (1.2$\\times$10$^3$\ns$^{-1}$) test was performed on a top-hat sample compressed in a\nsplit-Hopkinson pressure bar in order to highlight the inherent camera\nsynchronisation and ability to resolve the adiabatic shear band phenomenon.\n", "  The underlying mathematical structures of gauge theories are known to be\ngeometrical in nature and the local and global features of this geometry have\nbeen studied for a long time in mathematics under the name of fibre bundles. It\nis now understood that the global properties of gauge theories can have a\nprofound influence on physics. For example, instantons and monopoles are both\nconsequences of properties of geometry in the large, and the former can lead\nto, e.g., CP-violation, while the latter can lead to such remarkable results as\nthe creation of fermions out of bosons. Some familiarity with global\ndifferential geometry and fibre bundles seems therefore very desirable to a\nphysicist who works with gauge theories. One of the purposes of the present\nwork is to introduce the physicist to these disciplines using simple examples.\n", "  Strong coupling in cavity-magnon systems has shown great potential for use in\nspintronics and information processing technologies due to the low damping\nrates and long coherence times. Although such systems are conceptually similar\nto those coupled by magnon-polaritons (MPs), the link between magnon-cavity\ncoupling and MPs has not been explicitly defined. In this work we establish\nsuch a connection by studying the frequency-wavevector dispersion of a strongly\ncoupled magnon-cavity system, using a height-adjustable microwave cavity, and\nby modelling the observed behaviour through the system's effective\npermeability. A polariton gap between the upper and lower coupled modes of the\nmagnon-cavity system is defined, and is seen to be dependent on the system's\neffective filling factor. This gap is equal to the MP polariton gap in the\nlimit where filling factor = 1, corresponding to the removal of the microwave\ncavity. Thus, our work clarifies the connection between magnon-cavity and MP\ncoupling, improving our understanding of magnon-photon interactions in coupled\nsystems.\n", "  We describe here an ongoing upgrade to the legacy Ooty Radio Telescope\n(ORT).The ORT is a cylindrical parabolic cylinder 530mx30m in size operating at\na frequency of 326.5 (or z ~ 3.35 for the HI 21cm line). The telescope has been\nconstructed on a north-south hill slope whose gradient is equal to the latitude\nof the hill, making it effectively equitorially mounted. The feed consists of\nan array of 1056 dipoles. The key feature of this upgrade is the digitisation\nand cross-correlation of the signals of every set of 4-dipoles. This converts\nthe ORT into a 264 element interferometer with a field of view of 2 degrees x\n27cos(delta) degrees . This upgraded instrument is called the Ooty Wide Field\nArray (OWFA). This paper briefly describes the salient features of the upgrade,\nas well as its main science drivers. There are three main science drivers viz.\n(1) Observations of the large scale distribution of HI in the post-reionisation\nera (2) studies of the propagation of plasma irregularities through the inner\nheliosphere and (3) blind surveys for transient sources. More details on the\nupgrade, as well as on the expected science uses can be found in other papers\nin this special issue.\n", "  Distribution of cold gas in the post-reionization era provides an important\nlink between distribution of galaxies and the process of star formation.\nRedshifted 21 cm radiation from the Hyperfine transition of neutral Hydrogen\nallows us to probe the neutral component of cold gas, most of which is to be\nfound in the interstellar medium of galaxies. Existing and upcoming radio\ntelescopes can probe the large scale distribution of neutral Hydrogen via HI\nintensity mapping. In this paper we use an estimate of the HI power spectrum\nderived using an ansatz to compute the expected signal from the large scale HI\ndistribution at z ~ 3. We find that the scale dependence of bias at small\nscales makes a significant difference to the expected signal even at large\nangular scales. We compare the predicted signal strength with the sensitivity\nof radio telescopes that can observe such radiation and calculate the\nobservation time required for detecting neutral Hydrogen at these redshifts. We\nfind that OWFA (Ooty Wide Field Array) offers the best possibility to detect\nneutral Hydrogen at z ~ 3 before the SKA (Square Kilometer Array) becomes\noperational. We find that the OWFA should be able to make a 3 sigma or a more\nsignificant detection in 2000 hours of observations at several angular scales.\nCalculations done using the Fisher matrix approach indicate that a 5 sigma\ndetection of the binned HI power spectrum via measurement of the amplitude of\nthe HI power spectrum is possible in 1000 hours (Sarkar, Bharadwaj and Ali,\n2017).\n", "  This paper aims to obtain an analytic approximation to the evolution of\ncircular orbits governed by the Earth's $J_2$ and the luni-solar gravitational\nperturbations. Assuming that the lunar orbital plane coincides with the\necliptic plane, Allan and Cook (1964) derived an analytic solution to the\norbital plane evolution of circular orbits. Using their result as an\nintermediate solution, we establish an approximate analytic model with lunar\norbital inclination and its node regression be taken into account. Finally, an\napproximate analytic expression is derived, which is accurate compared to the\nnumerical results except for the resonant cases when the period of the\nreference orbit approximately equals the integer multiples (especially 1 or 2\ntimes) of lunar node regression period.\n", "  We describe high resolution observations of a GOES B-class flare\ncharacterized by a circular ribbon at chromospheric level, corresponding to the\nnetwork at photospheric level. We interpret the flare as a consequence of a\nmagnetic reconnection event occurred at a three-dimensional (3D) coronal null\npoint located above the supergranular cell. The potential field extrapolation\nof the photospheric magnetic field indicates that the circular chromospheric\nribbon is cospatial with the fan footpoints, while the ribbons of the inner and\nouter spines look like compact kernels. We found new interesting observational\naspects that need to be explained by models: 1) a loop corresponding to the\nouter spine became brighter a few minutes before the onset of the flare; 2) the\ncircular ribbon was formed by several adjacent compact kernels characterized by\na size of 1\"-2\"; 3) the kernels with stronger intensity emission were located\nat the outer footpoint of the darker filaments departing radially from the\ncenter of the supergranular cell; 4) these kernels start to brighten\nsequentially in clockwise direction; 5) the site of the 3D null point and the\nshape of the outer spine were detected by RHESSI in the low energy channel\nbetween 6.0 and 12.0 keV. Taking into account all these features and the length\nscales of the magnetic systems involved by the event we argued that the low\nintensity of the flare may be ascribed to the low amount of magnetic flux and\nto its symmetric configuration.\n", "  The observed TeV light curve from the $\\gamma$-ray binary PSR B1259-63/LS\n2883 shows a decrease in the flux at periastron which has not been fully\nexplained by emission mechanisms alone. This observed decrease can, however, be\nexplained by gamma-gamma absorption due to the stellar and disk photons. We\ncalculate the gamma-gamma absorption in PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 taking into\naccount photons from both the circumstellar disk and star, assuming the\n$\\gamma$ rays originate at the position of the pulsar. The gamma-gamma\nabsorption due to the circumstellar disk photons produces a $\\approx14\\%$\ndecrease in the flux, and there is a total decrease of $\\approx52\\%$ ($>1$ TeV)\nwithin a few days before periastron, accompanied by a hardening of the\n$\\gamma$-ray photon index. While the gamma-gamma absorption alone is not\nsufficient to explain the full complexity of the H.E.S.S. $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurve it results in a significant decrease in the predicted flux, which is\nco-incident with the observed decrease. In addition, we have calculated an\nupper-limit on the gamma-gamma absorption, assuming that the emission is\nproduced at the apex of the bow shock. Future observations with CTA during the\n2021 periastron passage may be able to confine the location of the emission\nbased on the degree of gamma-gamma absorption as well as measure the hardening\nof the spectrum around periastron.\n", "  The structure of exotic nucleus 10N was studied using 9C+p resonance\nscattering. Two L=0 resonances were found to be the lowest states in 10N. The\nground state of 10N is unbound with respect to proton decay by 2.2(2) or 1.9(2)\nMeV depending on the 2- or 1- spin-parity assignment, and the first excited\nstate is unbound by 2.8(2) MeV.\n", "  2007OR10 is currently the third largest known dwarf planet in the\ntransneptunian region, with an effective radiometric diameter of ~1535 km. It\nhas a slow rotation period of ~45 h that was suspected to be caused by tidal\ninteractions with a satellite undetected at that time. Here we report on the\ndiscovery of a likely moon of 2007OR10, identified on archival Hubble Space\nTelescope WFC3/UVIS system images. Although the satellite is detected at two\nepochs, this does not allow an unambiguous determination of the orbit and the\norbital period. A feasible 1.5-5.8x10^21 kg estimate for the system mass leads\nto a likely 35 to 100 d orbital period. The moon is about 4.2m fainter than\n2007OR10 in HST images that corresponds to a diameter of 237 km assuming equal\nalbedos with the primary. Due to the relatively small size of the moon the\nprevious size and albedo estimates for the primary remains unchanged. With this\ndiscovery all trans-Neptunian objects larger than 1000 km are now known to\nharbour satellites, an important constraint for moon formation theories in the\nyoung Solar system.\n", "  Zigzag edges of the honeycomb structure of graphene exhibit magnetic\npolarization making them attractive as building blocks for spintronic devices.\nHere, we show that devices with zigzag edged triangular antidots perform\nessential spintronic functionalities, such as spatial spin-splitting or spin\nfiltering of unpolarized incoming currents. Near-perfect performance can be\nobtained with optimized structures. The device performance is robust against\nsubstantial disorder. The gate-voltage dependence of transverse resistance is\nqualitatively different for spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized devices, and\ncan be used as a diagnostic tool. Importantly, the suggested devices are\nfeasible within current technologies.\n", "  The mathematical modelling of species transport in the turbulent boundary\nlayer of fluids that precipitate on the wall, is an important topic at the\nheart of one of the biggest challenges in efficient energy utilization in all\nprocess industries; namely the fouling of heat exchangers. A major contributor\nto the complexity of the problem is the multi-length-scale nature of the\ngoverning phenomena. That is, transport mechanisms dominating at the nano-scale\nmay be responsible for the macroscopic performance of the industrial process.\nThis paper addresses some of the challenges that need to be met in modelling\nthe boundary conditions, i.e. the atomic/molecular-scale conditions, for the\nspecies-specific mass conservation equations, at the wall, for single-phase,\nmulti-component fluids that precipitate at the wall.\n", "  In this paper, the generalized fractional integral operators of two\ngeneralized Mittag-Leffler type functions are investigated. The special cases\nof interest involve the generalized Fox--Wright function and the generalized\nM-series and K-function. In the next Section 2 we first recall some generalized\nfractional integral operators among the most widely used in fractional\ncalculus. Section 3 is devoted to the definitions of M-series and K-function\nand their relations to special functions. In Sections 4 and 5, effective\nfractional calculus of the generalized M-series and the K-function is carried\nout. The last section briefly concludes and opens up new perspectives. The\nresults established herein generalize recent properties of generalized\nMittag-Leffler type functions using left-and right-sided generalized fractional\ndifferintegral operators. The note results also in important applications in\nphysics and mathematical engineering.\n", "  {\\iota} Ori is a well studied massive binary consisting of an O9 III + B1\nIII/IV star. Due to its high eccentricity (e = 0.764) and short orbital period\n(P orb = 29.13376 d), it has been considered to be a good candidate to show\nevidence of tidal effects; however, none have previously been identified. Using\nphotometry from the BRITE-Constellation space photometry mission we have\nconfirmed the existence of tidal distortions through the presence of a\nheartbeat signal at periastron. We combine spectroscopic and light curve\nanalyses to measure the masses and radii of the components, revealing {\\iota}\nOri to be the most massive heartbeat system known to date. In addition, using a\nthorough frequency analysis, we also report the unprecedented discovery of\nmultiple tidally induced oscillations in an O star. The amplitudes of the\npulsations allow us to empirically estimate the tidal circularization rate,\nyielding an effective tidal quality factor Q $\\approx 4 \\times 10^{4}$ .\n", "  The Mott polarimetry for T -Violation (MTV) experiment tests time-reversal\nsymmetry in polarized nuclear beta decay by measuring an electron's transverse\npolarization as a form of angular asymmetry in Mott scattering using a thin\nmetal foil. A Mott scattering analyzer system developed using a tracking\ndetector to measure scattering angles offers better event selectivity than\nconventional counter experiments. In this paper, we describe a pilot experiment\nconducted at KEK-TRIAC using a prototype system with a polarized 8Li beam. The\nexperiment confirmed the sound performance of our Mott analyzer system to\nmeasure T-violating triple correlation (R correlation), and therefore\nrecommends its use in higher-precision experiments at the TRIUMF-ISAC.\n", "  High spatial resolution is the key for the understanding various\nastrophysical phenomena. But even with the future E-ELT, single dish\ninstruments are limited to a spatial resolution of about 4 mas in the visible.\nFor the closest objects within our Galaxy most of the stellar photosphere\nremains smaller than 1 mas. With the success of long baseline interferometry\nthese limitations were soom overcome. Today low and high resolution\ninterferometric instruments on the VLTI and CHARA offer an immense range of\nastrophysical studies. Combining more telescopes and moving to visible\nwavelengths broadens the science cases even more. With the idea of developing\nstrong science cases for a future visible interferometer, we organized a\nscience group around the following topics: pre-main sequence and main sequence\nstars, fundamental parameters, asteroseismology and classical pulsating stars,\nevolved stars, massive stars, active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and imaging\ntechniques. A meeting was organized on the 15th and 16th of January, 2015 in\nNice with the support of the Action Specific in Haute Resolution Angulaire\n(ASHRA), the Programme National en Physique Stellaire (PNPS), the Lagrange\nLaboratory and the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur, in order to present these\ncases and to discuss them further for future visible interferometers. This\nWhite Paper presents the outcome of the exchanges.\n  This book is dedicated to the memory of our colleague Olivier Chesneau who\npassed away at the age of 41.\n", "  Context. Red giant branch (RGB) stars are very bright objects in galaxies and\nare often used as standard candles. Interferometry is the ideal tool to\ncharacterize the dynamics and morphology of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim at\nprecisely characterising the surface dynamics of a sample of RGB stars.\nMethods. We obtained interferometric observations for three RGB stars with the\nMIRC instrument mounted at the CHARA interfer- ometer. We looked for\nasymmetries on the stellar surfaces using limb-darkening models. Results. We\nmeasured the apparent diameters of HD197989 (Epsilon Cyg) = 4.61+-0.02 mas,\nHD189276 (HR7633) = 2.95+-0.01 mas, and HD161096 (Beta Oph) = 4.43+-0.01 mas.\nWe detected departures from the centrosymmetric case for all three stars with\nthe tendency of a greater effect for lower logg of the sample. We explored the\ncauses of this signal and conclude that a possible explanation to the\ninterferometric signal is the convection-related and/or the magnetic-related\nsurface activity. However, it is necessary to monitor these stars with new\nobservations, possibly coupled with spectroscopy, in order to firmly establish\nthe cause.\n", "  Recent studies have shown that an extended main-sequence turn-off is a common\nfeature among intermediate-age clusters (1--3 Gyr) in the Magellanic Clouds.\nMultiple-generation star formation and stellar rotation or interacting binaries\nhave been proposed to explain the feature. However, it remains controversial in\nthe field of stellar populations. Here we present the main results of an\nongoing star formation among older star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\nCross-matching the positions of star clusters and young stellar objects has\nyielded 15 matches with 7 located in the cluster center. We demonstrate that\nthis is not by chance by estimating local number densities of young stellar\nobjects for each star cluster. This method is not based on isochrone fitting,\nwhich leads to some uncertainties in age estimation and methods of background\nsubtraction. We also find no direct correlation between atomic hydrogen and the\nclusters. This suggests that gas accretion for fueling the star formation must\nbe happening in situ. These findings support for the multiple-generations\nscenario as a plausible explanation for the extended main-sequence turn-off.\n", "  In this talk, I present a pedagogical and historical review related to the CP\nsymmetry. It includes the weak CP violation, the strong CP problem, \"invisible\"\naxions and cosmology, and Type-II leptogenesis.\n", "  We highlight three conflicts between quantum theory and classical general\nrelativity, which make it implausible that a quantum theory of gravity can be\narrived at by quantising classical gravity. These conflicts are: quantum\nnonlocality and space-time structure; the problem of time in quantum theory;\nand the quantum measurement problem. We explain how these three aspects bear on\neach other, and how they point towards an underlying noncommutative geometry of\nspace-time.\n", "  The Class 0 protostar, L483, has been observed in various molecular lines in\nthe 1.2 mm band at a sub-arcsecond resolution with ALMA. An infalling-rotating\nenvelope is traced by the CS line, while a very compact component with a broad\nvelocity width is observed for the CS, SO, HNCO, NH$_2$CHO, and HCOOCH$_3$\nlines. Although this source is regarded as the warm carbon-chain chemistry\n(WCCC) candidate source at a 1000 au scale, complex organic molecules\ncharacteristic of hot corinos such as NH$_2$CHO and HCOOCH$_3$ are detected in\nthe vicinity of the protostar. Thus, both hot corino chemistry and WCCC are\nseen in L483. Although such a mixed chemical character source has been\nrecognized as an intermediate source in previous single-dish observations, we\nhere report the first spatially-resolved detection. A kinematic structure of\nthe infalling-rotating envelope is roughly explained by a simple ballistic\nmodel with the protostellar mass of 0.1--0.2 $M_\\odot$ and the radius of the\ncentrifugal barrier (a half of the centrifugal radius) of 30--200 au, assuming\nthe inclination angle of 80\\degr\\ (0\\degr\\ for a face-on). The broad line\nemission observed in the above molecules most likely comes from the disk\ncomponent inside the centrifugal barrier. Thus, a drastic chemical change is\nseen around the centrifugal barrier.\n", "  Are some neutron stars produced without a supernova, without ejecting mass in\na remnant? Theoretical calculations of core collapse in massive stars often\npredict this. The observation of the repeating FRB 121102, whose dispersion\nmeasure has not changed over several years, suggests that dark core collapses\nare not just failures of computer codes, but may be real. The existence of one\nrepeating FRB with unchanging dispersion measure is not conclusive, but within\na decade hundreds or thousands of FRB are expected to be discovered, likely\nincluding scores of repeaters, permitting useful statistical inferences. A\nna\\\"{\\i}ve supernova remnant model predicts observable decline in dispersion\nmeasure for 100 years after its formation. If an upper limit on the decline of\n2 pc/cm$^3$-y is set for five repeating FRB, then the na\\\"{\\i}ve model with\nnominal parameters is rejected at the 95\\% level of confidence. This may\nindicate dark neutron star formation without a supernova or supernova remnant.\nThis hypothesis may also be tested with LSST data that would show, if present,\na supernova at an interferometric FRB position if it occurred within the LSST\nepoch.\n", "  Although comparatively bright, the cataclysmic variable GY Hya has not\nattracted much attention in the past. As part of a project to better\ncharacterize such systems photometrically, we observed light curves in white\nlight, each spanning several hours, at Bronberg Observatory, South Africa, in\n2004 and 2005, and at the Observat\\'orio do Pico dos Dias, Brazil, in 2014 and\n2016. These data permit to study orbital modulations and their variations from\nseason to season. The orbital period, already known from spectroscopic\nobservations of Peters & Thorstensen (2005), is confirmed through strong\nellipsoidal variations of the mass donor star in the system and the presence of\neclipses of both components. A refined period of 0.34723972~(6) days and\nrevised ephemeris are derived. Seasonal changes in the average orbital light\ncurve can qualitatively be explained by variations of the contribution of a hot\nspot to the system light together with changes of the disk radius. The\namplitude of the ellipsoidal variations and the eclipse contact phases permit\nto put some constraints on the mass ratio, orbital inclination and the relative\nbrightness of the primary and secondary components. There are some indications\nthat the disk radius during quiescence, expressed in units of the component\nseparation, is smaller than in other dwarf novae.\n", "  The electronic structure and intrinsic magnetic properties of\n$\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$-related compounds and their alloys have been\ninvestigated using density functional theory. For $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$,\nthe crystallographic $a$ axis is the easiest axis, which agrees with\nexperiments. The magnetic ground state of $\\text{Mn}_2\\text{AlB}_2$ is found to\nbe ferromagnetic in the basal $ab$ plane, but antiferromagnetic along the $c$\naxis. All $3d$ dopings considered decrease the magnetization and Curie\ntemperature in $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$. Electron doping with Co or Ni has a\nstronger effect on the decreasing of Curie temperature in\n$\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$ than hole doping with Mn or Cr. However, a larger\namount of Mn doping on $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$ promotes the ferromagnetic to\nantiferromagnetic transition. A very anisotropic magnetoelastic effect is found\nin $\\text{Fe}_2\\text{AlB}_2$: the magnetization has a much stronger dependence\non the lattice parameter $c$ than on $a$ or $b$, which is explained by\nelectronic-structure features near the Fermi level. Dopings of other elements\non B and Al sites are also discussed.\n", "  This paper analyses the DeGroot-Friedkin model for evolution of the\nindividuals' social powers in a social network when the network topology varies\ndynamically (described by dynamic relative interaction matrices). The\nDeGroot-Friedkin model describes how individual social power (self-appraisal,\nself-weight) evolves as a network of individuals discuss a sequence of issues.\nWe seek to study dynamically changing relative interactions because\ninteractions may change depending on the issue being discussed. In order to\nexplore the problem in detail, two different cases of issue-dependent network\ntopologies are studied. First, if the topology varies between issues in a\nperiodic manner, it is shown that the individuals' self-appraisals admit a\nperiodic solution. Second, if the topology changes arbitrarily, under the\nassumption that each relative interaction matrix is doubly stochastic and\nirreducible, the individuals' self-appraisals asymptotically converge to a\nunique non-trivial equilibrium.\n", "  We have measured astrometry for members of the Orion Nebula Cluster with\nimages obtained in 2015 with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space\nTelescope. By comparing those data to previous measurements with NICMOS on\nHubble in 1998, we have discovered that a star in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula,\nsource x from Lonsdale et al. (1982), is moving with an unusually high proper\nmotion of 29 mas/yr, which corresponds to 55 km/s at the distance of Orion.\nPrevious radio observations have found that three other stars in the\nKleinmann-Low Nebula (BN and sources I and n) have high proper motions (5-14\nmas/yr) and were near a single location ~540 years ago, and thus may have been\nmembers of a multiple system that dynamically decayed. The proper motion of\nsource x is consistent with ejection from that same location 540 years ago,\nwhich provides strong evidence that the dynamical decay did occur and that the\nrunaway star BN originated in the Kleinmann-Low Nebula rather than the nearby\nTrapezium cluster. However, our constraint on the motion of source n is\nsignificantly smaller than the most recent radio measurement, which indicates\nthat it did not participate in the event that ejected the other three stars.\n", "  As a part of the mm-Wave Interferometric Survey of Dark Object Masses\n(WISDOM) project, we present an estimate of the mass of the supermassive black\nhole (SMBH) in the nearby fast-rotator early-type galaxy NGC 3665. We obtained\nCombined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) B and C array\nobservations of the $^{12}$CO$(J=2-1)$ emission line with a combined angular\nresolution of $0\".59$. We analysed and modelled the three-dimensional molecular\ngas kinematics, obtaining a best-fit SMBH mass $M_{\\rm BH}=5.75^{+1.49}_{-1.18}\n\\times 10^{8}$ $M_{\\odot}$, a mass-to-light ratio at $H$-band\n$(M/L)_{H}=1.45\\pm0.04$ $(M/L)_{\\odot, H}$, and other parameters describing the\ngeometry of the molecular gas disc (statistical errors, all at $3\\sigma$\nconfidence). We estimate the systematic uncertainties on the stellar $M/L$ to\nbe $\\approx0.2$ $(M/L)_{\\odot, H}$, and on the SMBH mass to be\n$\\approx0.4\\times10^{8}$ $M_{\\odot}$. The measured SMBH mass is consistent with\nthat estimated from the latest correlations with galaxy properties. Following\nour older works, we also analysed and modelled the kinematics using only the\nmajor-axis position-velocity diagram, and conclude that the two methods are\nconsistent.\n", "  The physical properties of bound-state charged massive scalar field\nconfigurations linearly coupled to a spherically symmetric charged reflecting\nshell are studied {\\it analytically}. To that end, we solve the Klein-Gordon\nwave equation for a static scalar field of proper mass $\\mu$, charge coupling\nconstant $q$, and spherical harmonic index $l$ in the background of a charged\nshell of radius $R$ and electric charge $Q$. It is proved that the\ndimensionless inequality $\\mu R<\\sqrt{(qQ)^2-(l+1/2)^2}$ provides an upper\nbound on the regime of existence of the composed\ncharged-spherical-shell-charged-massive-scalar-field configurations.\nInterestingly, we explicitly show that the {\\it discrete} spectrum of shell\nradii $\\{R_n(\\mu,qQ,l)\\}_{n=0}^{n=\\infty}$ which can support the static\nbound-state charged massive scalar field configurations can be determined\nanalytically. We confirm our analytical results by numerical computations.\n", "  We study Veselago lensing of massless Dirac fermions by n-p junctions for\nelectron sources with a certain polarization. This polarization corresponds to\npseudospin for graphene and to real spin for topological insulators. Both for a\npoint source and for injection into a sample through a narrow lead, we find\nthat polarization leads to spatial symmetry breaking. For the Green's function,\nthis results in a vertical displacement, or even complete vanishing of the main\nfocus, depending on the exact polarization. For injection through a lead, it\nleads to a difference between the amounts of current emitted with positive and\nnegative transversal momenta. We study both systems in detail using the\nsemiclassical approximation. By comparing the results to the exact solutions,\nwe establish that semiclassical methods provide a very effective way to study\nthese systems. For the Green's function, we derive an easy-to-use analytical\nformula for the vertical displacement of the main focus. For current injection\nthrough a lead, we use semiclassical methods to identify two different\nscattering regimes.\n", "  Images and spectra of the open cluster NGC 3105 have been obtained with GMOS\non Gemini South. The (i', g'-i') color-magnitude diagram (CMD) constructed from\nthese data extends from the brightest cluster members to g'~23. This is 4 - 5\nmag fainter than previous CMDs at visible wavelengths and samples cluster\nmembers with sub-solar masses. Assuming a half-solar metallicity, comparisons\nwith isochrones yield a distance of 6.6+/-0.3 kpc. An age of at least 32 Myr is\nfound based on the photometric properties of the brightest stars, coupled with\nthe apparent absence of pre-main sequence stars in the lower regions of the\nCMD. The luminosity function of stars between 50 and 70 arcsec from the cluster\ncenter is consistent with a Chabrier lognormal mass function. However, at radii\nsmaller than 50 arcsec there is a higher specific frequency of the most massive\nmain sequence stars than at larger radii. Photometry obtained from archival\nSPITZER images reveals that some of the brightest stars near NGC 3105 have\nexcess infrared emission, presumably from warm dust envelopes. Halpha emission\nis detected in a few early-type stars in and around the cluster, building upon\nprevious spectroscopic observations that found Be stars near NGC 3105. The\nequivalent width of the NaD lines in the spectra of early type stars is\nconsistent with the reddening found from comparisons with isochrones. Stars\nwith i'~18.5 that fall near the cluster main sequence have a spectral-type A5V,\nand a distance modulus that is consistent with that obtained by comparing\nisochrones with the CMD is found assuming solar neighborhood intrinsic\nbrightnesses for these stars.\n", "  Critical overdensity $\\delta_c$ is a key concept in estimating the number\ncount of halos for different redshift and halo-mass bins, and therefore, it is\na powerful tool to compare cosmological models to observations. There are\ncurrently two different prescriptions in the literature for its calculation,\nnamely, the differential-radius and the constant-infinity methods. In this work\nwe show that the latter yields precise results {\\it only} if we are careful in\nthe definition of the so-called numerical infinities. Although the subtleties\nwe point out are crucial ingredients for an accurate determination of\n$\\delta_c$ both in general relativity and in any other gravity theory, we focus\non $f(R)$ modified-gravity models in the metric approach; in particular, we use\nthe so-called large ($F=1/3$) and small-field ($F=0$) limits. For both of them,\nwe calculate the relative errors (between our method and the others) in the\ncritical density $\\delta_c$, in the comoving number density of halos per\nlogarithmic mass interval $n_{\\ln M}$ and in the number of clusters at a given\nredshift in a given mass bin $N_{\\rm bin}$, as functions of the redshift. We\nhave also derived an analytical expression for the density contrast in the\nlinear regime as a function of the collapse redshift $z_c$ and $\\Omega_{m0}$\nfor any $F$.\n", "  The degree of thermalization of electronically excited state manifolds of an\nabsorber can be tested via optical spectroscopy. In the thermalized-manifold\ncase, the ratio of absorption and emission is expected to follow a universal\nBoltzmann-type frequency scaling, known as the Kennard-Stepanov relation. Here,\nwe investigate absorption and emission spectral profiles of rubidium, cesium,\nand potassium molecular dimers in a high-pressure argon buffer-gas environment\nand study the effect of collisionally induced redistribution. We find that,\ndespite the use of nonlinear excitation techniques, the ratio of absorption and\nemission well follows the Kennard-Stepanov scaling for a variety of molecular\ntransitions. We conclude that the upper electronic state rovibrational manifold\nof the molecular gas is well in thermodynamic equilibrium. Further, we\ndemonstrate an accurate, calibration-free determination of the gas temperature\nfrom the measured spectroscopic data.\n", "  A short proof of the quenched central limit theorem for the random walk in\nrandom environment introduced by Boldrighini, Minlos, and Pellegrinotti is\ngiven.\n", "  Based on thermodynamics, we study the galactic clustering of an expanding\nUniverse by considering the logarithmic and volume (quantum) corrections to\nNewton's law along with the repulsive effect of a harmonic force induced by the\ncosmological constant ($\\Lambda$) in the formation of the large scale structure\nof the Universe. We derive the $N$-body partition function for extended-mass\ngalaxies (galaxies with halos) analytically. For this partition function, we\ncompute the exact equations of states, which exhibit the logarithmic, volume\nand cosmological constant corrections. In this setting, a modified correlation\n(clustering) parameter (due to these corrections) emerges naturally from the\nexact equations of state. We compute a corrected grand canonical distribution\nfunction for this system. Furthermore, we obtain a deviation in differential\nforms of the two-point correlation functions for both the point-mass and\nextended-mass cases. The consequences of these deviations on the correlation\nfunction's power law are also discussed.\n", "  Previously, in Penner (2016a, 2016b), a theory of gravitational\nanti-screening was shown to lead naturally to the Baryonic Tully-Fisher\nRelationship. In addition, it was shown to agree with the observed rotational\ncurve of the Galaxy, the observed features in the rotational curves of other\nspiral galaxies, with observations of the Coma cluster, and with a\ngeometrically flat universe. In this paper the theory will now be applied to\nbinary galaxies. It is shown that there is a relationship between the\nline-of-sight velocity difference of the pair and the individual rotational\nvelocities of the galaxies. The resulting probability function for beta,\ndefined as the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity difference to the rotational\nvelocity of the larger galaxy of the pair, is in excellent agreement with the\nobservations taken by multiple researchers for the case of the binaries being\non radial orbits.\n", "  We discuss the critical properties of net-baryon-number fluctuations at the\nchiral restoration transition in matter at nonzero temperature and net-baryon\ndensity. The chiral dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is modeled by the\nPolykov-loop extended Quark-Meson Lagrangian, that includes the coupling of\nquarks to temporal gauge fields. The Functional Renormalization Group is\nemployed to account for the criticality at the phase boundary. We focus on the\nratios of the net-baryon-number cumulants, $\\chi_B^n$, for $1\\leq n\\leq 4$. The\nresults are confronted with recent experimental data on fluctuations of the\nnet-proton number in nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n", "  Drag laws for particles in fluids are often expressed in terms of the\nundisturbed fluid velocity, defined as the fluid velocity a particle sees\nbefore the disturbance develops in the fluid. In two-way coupled point-particle\nsimulations the information from the undisturbed state is not available and\nmust be approximated using the disturbed velocity field. Horwitz and Mani\n(2016) recently developed a procedure to estimate the undisturbed velocity for\nparticles moving at low Reynolds number and obeying the Stokes drag law. Using\nour correction, we demonstrated convergence of numerical simulations to\nexpected physical behavior for a range of canonical settings. In this paper we\nfurther extend and examine that correction scheme for particles moving at\nfinite Reynolds number, by considering the Schiller-Nauman drag law. Tests of\nparticle settling in an otherwise quiescent fluid show reasonable predictions\nof settling velocity history for particle Reynolds numbers up to ten. The\ncorrection scheme is shown to lead to $\\geq 70\\%$ reduction in particle\nvelocity errors, compared to standard trilinear interpolation of disturbed\nvelocities. We also discuss the modelling of unsteady effects and their\nrelation to Stokes number and density ratio. Finally, we propose a regime\ndiagram to guide scheme selection for point-particle modelling.\n", "  The laser-plasma accelerator has attracted great interest for constituting an\nalternative in the production of the relativistic electron beams of high peak\ncurrent. But the generated electron beam has poor monochrome and emittance,\nwhich make it difficult to produce high brightness radiation. Here we propose a\ncompact flexible laser undulator based on ponderomotive force to constitute a\nmillimeter-sized synchrotron radiation source of X-ray. We demonstrate that it\ncan produce bright radiation with tens of keV energies. This opens a new path\nto compact synchrotron source with high power laser.\n", "  Annihilation momentum densities and correlation enhancement factors for\nlow-energy positron annihilation on valence and core electrons of noble-gas\natoms are calculated using many-body theory. s, p and d-wave positrons of\nmomenta up to the positronium-formation threshold of the atom are considered.\nThe enhancement factors parametrize the effects of short-range\nelectron-positron correlations which increase the annihilation probability\nbeyond the independent-particle approximation. For all positron partial waves\nand electron subshells, the enhancement factors are found to be relatively\ninsensitive to the positron momentum. The enhancement factors for the core\nelectron orbitals are also independent of the positron angular momentum. The\nlargest enhancement factor ($\\sim 15$) is found for the 5p orbital in Xe, while\nthe values for the core orbitals are typically $\\sim 1.5$.\n", "  Interaction between plasmonic nanostructures and molecules is modeled based\non the concept of quantized optical cavity for surface enhanced Raman\nscattering process. We have found that the background emission from plasmonic\nnanostructures is not constant as speculated ordinarily, it is enhanced\naccompanying with the molecules Raman scattering. The plasmonic nanostructures\nnot only scatter elastically the energy coupling from the molecules excited\nstates, but also radiate it inelastically as surface plasmon emission partly\nresulting an enhanced background. According to single nanoparticle experiments,\nthe model reveals that the background fluctuations is mainly due to the induced\nfield of the molecules, which increases the local field felt by the\nnanostructures that was often overlooked in the past. These findings suggest\nconsidering the plasmonic nanostructures and molecules as a hybrid entity to\nanalyze and optimize the surface enhanced spectroscopy.\n", "  The relationship between the universal conductance fluctuation and the weak\nlocalization effect in monolayer graphene is investigated. By comparing\nexperimental results with the predictions of the weak localization theory for\ngraphene, we find that the ratio of the elastic intervalley scattering time to\nthe inelastic dephasing time varies in accordance with the conductance\nfluctuation; this is a clear evidence connecting the universal conductance\nfluctuation with the weak localization effect. We also find a series of\nscattering lengths that are related to the phase shifts caused by magnetic flux\nby Fourier analysis.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate and develop a new approach to the numerical\nanalysis and characterization of random fluctuations with heavy-tailed\nprobability distribution function (PDF), such as turbulent heat flow and solar\nflare fluctuations. We identify the heavy-tailed random fluctuations based on\nthe scaling properties of the tail exponent of the PDF, power-law growth of\n$q$th order correlation function and the self-similar properties of the contour\nlines in two-dimensional random fields. Moreover, this work leads to a\nsubstitution for fractional Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) equation that works in\npresence of $\\mu$-stable L\\'evy noise. Our proposed model explains the\nconfiguration dynamics of the systems with heavy-tailed correlated random\nfluctuations. We also present an alternative solution to the fractional EW\nequation in the presence of $\\mu$-stable L\\'evy noise in the steady-state,\nwhich is implemented numerically, using the $\\mu$-stable fractional L\\'evy\nmotion. Based on the analysis of the self-similar properties of contour loops,\nwe numerically show that the scaling properties of contour loop ensembles can\nqualitatively and quantitatively distinguish non-Gaussian random fields from\nGaussian random fluctuations.\n", "  The effects of Hubbard-type on-site interactions on the BHZ model is studied\nin this paper for model parameters appropriate for the HgTe/CdTe quantum well.\nWithin a simple mean field theory we search for plausible magnetic\ninstabilities in the model and find that the ground state becomes {\\em\nferromagnetic} when the interaction strength between electrons in hole orbital\nis strong enough. The result can be understood by an approximate mapping of the\nHubbard-BHZ model to the one band Hubbard model. The same mapping suggests that\nthe magnetic and/or other ordered phases are more likely to occur in large gap\ntopological insulators whose occupations are close to 1/2 for both electron and\nhole orbital.\n", "  We investigate fractional quantum Hall states for model interactions\nrestricted to a repulsive hard-core. When the hard-core excludes relative\nangular momentum one between spinless electrons the ground state at Landau\nlevel filling factor $\\nu=1/3$ is exactly given by the Laughlin wavefunction.\nWhen we exclude relative angular momentum three only, Wojs Quinn and Yi have\nsuggested the appearance of a liquid state with non-Laughlin correlations. We\nstudy this special hard-core interaction at filling factors 1/3 and 1/5 on the\nsphere and on the torus geometry. At $\\nu=1/3$ an analysis of the charged and\nneutral gaps on the sphere geometry points to a gapless state. On the torus\ngeometry the projected static structure factor has a two-peak feature pointing\nto one-dimensional density ordering. We conclude that the ground state is\nlikely a compressible stripe. At $\\nu=1/5$ we find that the torus spectrum has\na ground state degeneracy which is extensive as in the case of the Haffnian\nstate so is likely also a compressible state. For this filling factor on the\nsphere we show that there is a unique special polynomial with integer\ncoefficients which is a unique zero-energy ground state. This polynomial obeys\na dominance relation in the expansion onto Slater determinants with a special\nroot configuration $110_6 (10_4)_k 0_6 11$.\n", "  We report on the detection of individual spin quantum transitions of a single\ntrapped antiproton in a Penning trap. The spin-state determination, which is\nbased on the unambiguous detection of axial frequency shifts in presence of a\nstrong magnetic bottle, reaches a fidelity of 92.1$\\%$. Spin-state\ninitialization with $>99.9\\%$ fidelity and an average initialization time of 24\nmin are demonstrated. This is a major step towards an antiproton magnetic\nmoment measurement with a relative uncertainty on the part-per-billion level.\n", "  The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL.EU) will provide unprecedented\npeak brilliance and ultra-short and spatially coherent X-ray pulses in an\nenergy range of 0.25 to 25 keV . The pulse timing structure is unique with a\nburst of 2700 pulses of 100 fs length at a temporal distance of 220 ns followed\nby a 99.4 ms gap. To make optimal use of this timing structure and energy range\na great variety of detectors are being developed for use at XFEL.EU, including\n2D X-ray imaging cameras that are able to detect images at a rate of 4.5 MHz,\nprovide dynamic ranges up to 10$^5$ photons per pulse per pixel under different\noperating conditions and covering a large range of angular resolution. In order\nto characterize, commission and calibrate this variety of detectors and for\ntesting of detector prototypes the XFEL.EU detector group is building up an\nX-ray test laboratory that allows testing of detectors with X-ray photons under\nconditions that are as similar to the future beam line conditions at the\nXFEL.EU as is possible with laboratory sources. A total of four test\nenvironments provide the infrastructure for detector tests and calibration: two\nportable setups that utilize low power X-ray sources and radioactive isotopes,\na test environment where a commercial high power X-ray generator is in use, and\na pulsed X-ray/electron source which will provide pulses as short as 25 ns in\nXFEL.EU burst mode combined with target anodes of different materials. The\nstatus of the test environments, three of which are already in use while one is\nin commissioning phase, will be presented as well as first results from\nperformance tests and characterization of the sources.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional model of radiative heat transfer for which the\neffect of the electromag- netic field is only from the scalar potential and\nthereby ignoring the vector potential contribution. This is a valid assumption\nwhen the distances between objects are of the order of nanometers. Using Lorenz\ngauge, the scalar field is quantized with the canonical quantization scheme,\ngiving rise to scalar photons. In the limit as the speed of light approaches\ninfinity, the theory reduces to a pure Coulomb interaction governed by the\nPoisson equation. The model describes very well parallel plate capacitor\nphysics, where a new length scale related to its capacitance emerges. Shorter\nthan this length scale we see greater radiative heat transfer. This differs\nmarkedly from the usual Rytov fluctuational electrodynamics theory in which the\nenhancement is due to evanescent modes shorter than the thermal wavelengths.\nOur theory may explain recent experiments where charge fluctuations instead of\ncurrent fluctuations play a dominant role in radiative heat transfer. Finally,\ndue to the asymmetric electron-bath couplings, thermal rectification effects\nare also observed and reported.\n", "  The possibility of solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation in Minkowski space,\neven for fermionic systems, is becoming actual, through the applications of\nwell-known tools: i) the Nakanishi integral representation of the\nBethe-Salpeter amplitude and ii) the light-front projection onto the\nnull-plane. The theoretical background and some preliminary calculations are\nillustrated, in order to show the potentiality and the wide range of\napplication of the method.\n", "  Strong light-matter coupling manifested by vacuum Rabi splitting has\nattracted tremendous attention due to its fundamental importance in cavity\nquantum-electrodynamics research and great potentials in quantum information\napplications. A prerequisite for practical applications of the strong coupling\nin future quantum information processing and coherent manipulation is an\nall-solid-state system exhibiting room-temperature vacuum Rabi splitting with\nactive control. Here we realized such a system in heterostructure consisting of\nmonolayer WS2 and an individual plasmonic gold nanorod. By taking advantage of\nboth of the small mode volume of the nanorod and large binding energy of the\nWS2 exciton, giant vacuum Rabi splitting energies of 91 meV ~ 133 meV can be\nobtained at ambient conditions, which only involve 5 ~ 18 excitons. The vacuum\nRabi splitting can be dynamically tuned either by electrostatic gating or\ntemperature scanning. These findings could pave the way towards active quantum\noptic devices operating at room temperature.\n", "  We study the annealing stability of bottom-pinned perpendicularly magnetized\nmagnetic tunnel junctions based on dual MgO free layers and thin fixed systems\ncomprising a hard [Co/Ni] multilayer antiferromagnetically coupled to thin a Co\nreference layer and a FeCoB polarizing layer. Using conventional magnetometry\nand advanced broadband ferromagnetic resonance, we identify the properties of\neach sub-unit of the magnetic tunnel junction and demonstrate that this\nmaterial option can ensure a satisfactory resilience to the 400$^\\circ$C\nthermal annealing needed in solid-state magnetic memory applications. The dual\nMgO free layer possesses an anneal-robust 0.4 T effective anisotropy and\nsuffers only a minor increase of its Gilbert damping from 0.007 to 0.010 for\nthe toughest annealing conditions. Within the fixed system, the ferro-coupler\nand texture-breaking TaFeCoB layer keeps an interlayer exchange above 0.8\nmJ/m$^2$, while the Ru antiferrocoupler layer within the synthetic\nantiferromagnet maintains a coupling above -0.5 mJ/m$^2$. These two strong\ncouplings maintain the overall functionality of the tunnel junction upon the\ntoughest annealing despite the gradual degradation of the thin Co layer\nanisotropy that may reduce the operation margin in spin torque memory\napplications. Based on these findings, we propose further optimization routes\nfor the next generation magnetic tunnel junctions.\n", "  The ability to cool and manipulate levitated nano-particles in vacuum is a\npromising new tool for exploring macroscopic quantum\nmechanics\\cite{WanPRL2016,Scala2013,Zhang2013}, precision measurements of\nforces, \\cite{GambhirPRA2016} and non-equilibrium thermodynamics\n\\cite{GieselerNatNano2014,MillenNat2014}. The extreme isolation afforded by\noptical levitation offers a low noise, undamped environment that has to date\nbeen used to measure zeptonewton forces \\cite{GambhirPRA2016}, radiation\npressure shot noise,\\cite{Jain2016} and to demonstrate the cooling of the\ncentre-of-mass motion \\cite{LiNatPhys2011,Gieseler2012}. Ground state cooling,\nand the creation and measurement of macroscopic quantum superpositions, are now\nwithin reach, but control of both the center-of-mass and internal temperature\nis required. While cooling the centre-of-mass motion to microKelvin\ntemperatures has now been achieved, the internal temperature has remained at or\nwell above room temperature. Here we demonstrate refrigeration of levitated\nYb$^{3+}$:YLF from room temperature to 130 K using anti-Stokes fluorescence\ncooling, while simultaneously using the optical trapping field to align the\ncrystal to maximise cooling.\n", "  In a recent paper, we have proposed a novel laser cooling scheme for reducing\ncollisional energy of a pair of atoms by using photoassociative transitions. In\nthat paper, we considered two atoms in free space, that is we have not\nconsidered the effects of trap on the cooling process. Here in this paper, we\nqualitatively discuss the possibility of extending this idea for Raman sideband\ncooling of a pair of interacting atoms trapped in Lamb-Dicke (LD) regime. Apart\nfrom cooling, our method may be important for manipulating on-site interaction\nof atoms in an optical lattice.\n", "  In an earlier paper we have proposed a novel method to compute the decay\nwidth for a general $1\\to n$ cascade decay where the propagators are off-shell\nand may be of different spins. Here, we extend our algorithm to accommodate\nthose decays that are mediated by more than one such cascades. This generalizes\nour prescription and widens its applicability. We compute the three- and\nfour-body toy decay chains where identical final states appear through\ndifferent cascades. Here, we also provide the algorithm to calculate the\ninterference terms. For four-body decays we discuss both symmetric and\nasymmetric cascades, providing the expressions for the detailed phase space\nstructure in each case. We find that the results obtained with this algorithm\nhave a very impressive agreement with those from standard softwares using a\nsophisticated Monte Carlo based phase space integration.\n", "  Recently, the compositeness, defined as the norm of a two-body wave function\nfor bound and resonance states, has been investigated to discuss the internal\nstructure of hadrons in terms of hadronic molecular components. From the\nstudies of the compositeness, it has been clarified that the two-body wave\nfunction of a bound state can be extracted from the residue of the scattering\namplitude at the bound state pole. Of special interest is that the two-body\nwave function from the scattering amplitude is automatically normalized. In\nparticular, while the compositeness is unity for energy-independent\ninteractions, it deviates from unity for energy-dependent interactions, which\ncan be interpreted as a missing-channel contribution. In this manuscript, we\nshow the formulation of the two-body wave function from the scattering\namplitude, evaluate the compositeness for several dynamically generated\nresonances such as $f_{0} (980)$, $\\Lambda (1405)$, and $\\Xi (1690)$, and\ninvestigate their internal structure in terms of the hadronic molecular\ncomponents.\n", "  Magnetization of antiferromagnetic nanoparticles is known to generally scale\nup inversely to their diameter (d) according to N\\'eel's model. Here we report\na deviation from this conventional linear 1/d dependence, altered significantly\nby the microstrain, in Ca and Ti substituted BiFeO3 nanoparticles. Magnetic\nproperties of microstrain-controlled Bi1-xCaxFe1-yTiyO3-delta (y = 0 and x = y)\nnanoparticles are analyzed as a function of their size ranging from 18 nm to\n200 nm. A complex interdependence of doping concentration (x or y), annealing\ntemperature (T), microstrain (epsilon) and particle size (d) is established.\nX-ray diffraction studies reveal a linear variation of microstrain with inverse\nparticle size, 1/d nm-1 (i.e. epsilon.d = 16.5 nm.%). A rapid increase in the\nsaturation magnetization below a critical size dc ~ 35 nm, exhibiting a\n(1/d)^alpha (alpha ~ 2.6) dependence, is attributed to the influence of\nmicrostrain. We propose an empirical formula M is proportional to\n(1/d)epsilon^beta (beta ~ 1.6) to highlight the contributions from both the\nsize and microstrain towards the total magnetization in the doped systems. The\nmagnetization observed in nanoparticles is thus, a result of competing magnetic\ncontribution from the terminated spin cycloid on the surface and counteracting\nmicrostrain present at a given size. Large magnetodielectric response of ~ 9.5\n% is observed in spark plasma sintered pellets with optimal size and doping\nconcentration, revealing a strong correlation between magnetic and\nferroelectric order parameters.\n", "  It is generally accepted that all models are wrong -- the difficulty is\ndetermining which are useful. Here, a useful model is considered as one that is\ncapable of combining data and expert knowledge, through an inversion or\ncalibration process, to adequately characterize the uncertainty in predictions\nof interest. This paper derives conditions that specify which simplified models\nare useful and how they should be calibrated. To start, the notion of an\noptimal simplification is defined. This relates the model simplifications to\nthe nature of the data and predictions, and determines when a standard\nprobabilistic calibration scheme is capable of accurately characterizing\nuncertainty. Furthermore, two additional conditions are defined for suboptimal\nmodels that determine when the simplifications can be safely ignored. The first\nallows a suboptimally simplified model to be used in a way that replicates the\nperformance of an optimal model. This is achieved through the judicial\nselection of a prior term for the calibration process that explicitly includes\nthe nature of the data, predictions and modelling simplifications. The second\nconsiders the dependency structure between the predictions and the available\ndata to gain insights into when the simplifications can be overcome by using\nthe right calibration data. Furthermore, the derived conditions are related to\nthe commonly used calibration schemes based on Tikhonov and subspace\nregularization. To allow concrete insights to be obtained, the analysis is\nperformed under a linear expansion of the model equations and where the\npredictive uncertainty is characterized via second order moments only.\n", "  A novel and scalable geometric multi-level algorithm is presented for the\nnumerical solution of elliptic partial differential equations, specially\ndesigned to run with high occupancy of streaming processors inside Graphics\nProcessing Units(GPUs). The algorithm consists of iterative, superposed\noperations on a single grid, and it is composed of two simple full-grid\nroutines: a restriction and a coarsened interpolation-relaxation. The\nrestriction is used to collect sources using recursive coarsened averages, and\nthe interpolation-relaxation simultaneously applies coarsened finite-difference\noperators and interpolations. The routines are scheduled in a saw-like refining\ncycle. Convergence to machine precision is achieved repeating the full cycle\nusing accumulated residuals and successively collecting the solution. Its total\nnumber of operations scale linearly with the number of nodes. It provides an\nattractive fast solver for Boundary Value Problems (BVPs), specially for\nsimulations running entirely in the GPU. Applications shown in this work\ninclude the deformation of two-dimensional grids, the computation of\nthree-dimensional streamlines for a singular trifoil-knot vortex and the\ncalculation of three-dimensional electric potentials in heterogeneous\ndielectric media.\n", "  We revisit the viscous decretion disk (VDD) model of the classical Be star\n$\\beta$ CMi as presented by \\citet{klement} using an updated version of the\nradiative transfer code {\\ttfamily HDUST}. A software bug was causing the mean\nintensities to be slightly underestimated in the equatorial region of the disk,\nwith small but detectable effects on the disk temperature and emergent\nspectrum. The new model fixes an unexplained feature of the original model,\nwhich was able to reproduce the observations only when considering a dual\ndensity behavior: a steep density fall-off in the very inner parts of the disk\nfollowed by a shallower density profile. The new model is able to reproduce all\nthe observables reasonably well using a single power-law for the density\nprofile throughout the whole disk, as predicted by the VDD model. All the other\noriginal conclusions, most importantly the reported truncation of the disk at\nthe distance of 35 stellar equatorial radii from the central star, remain\nunchanged.\n", "  In the standard SPH method, the interaction between two particles might be\nnot pairwise when the support domain varies, which can result in a reduction of\naccuracy. To deal with this problem, a modified SPH approach is presented in\nthis paper. First of all, a Lagrangian kernel is introduced to eliminate\nspurious distortions of the domain of material stability, and the gradient is\ncorrected by a linear transformation so that linear completeness is satisfied.\nThen, concepts of support and dual-support are defined to deal with the\nunbalanced interactions between the particles with different support domains.\nSeveral benchmark problems in one, two and three dimensions are tested to\nverify the accuracy of the modified SPH model and highlight its advantages over\nthe standard SPH method through comparisons.\n", "  We observed the Rapid Burster with Chandra when it was in the 'banana' state\nthat usually precedes the type-II X-ray bursting 'island' state for which the\nsource is particularly known. We employed the High-Energy Transmission Grating\nSpectrometer in combination with the ACIS-S detector in continuous clocking\nmode. The observation yielded 20 thermonuclear type-I X-ray bursts emitted from\nthe neutron star surface with recurrence times between 0.9 and 1.2 hr, and an\ne-folding decay time scale of 1 min. We searched for narrow spectral features\nin the burst emission that could constrain the composition of the ashes of the\nnuclear burning and the compactness of the neutron star, but found none. The\nupper limit on the equivalent width of narrow absorption lines between 2 and 6\nkeV is between 5 and 20 eV (single trial 3 sigma confidence level) and on those\nof absorption edges between 150 and 400 eV. The latter numbers are comparable\nto the levels predicted by Weinberg, Bildsten & Schatz (2006) for\nEddington-limited thermonuclear bursts.\n", "  The onset of turbulence in laminar flow of viscous fluids is shown to be a\nconsequence of the limited capacity of the fluid to withstand shear stress.\nThis fact is exploited to predict the flow velocity at which laminar flow\nbecomes turbulent and to calculate, on a theoretical basis, the corresponding\ncritical value of the Reynolds number. A constitutive property essential to the\npresent analysis is the ultimate shear stress of the fluid. The paper shows how\nthis stress can be determined experimentally from a test in plane Couette flow.\nFor water at 20 {\\deg}C, the value of the ultimate shear stress is calculated\nfrom the experiments reported in the literature. This value is then is employed\nto predict the Reynolds number corresponding to the onset of turbulence in\nTaylor-Couette flow and in pipe flow of circular cross section. The results are\nrealistic and their significance is assessed critically. The procedure can be\napplied to predict the onset of turbulence in any non-turbulent flow, provided\nthat the velocity field of the flow is known.\n", "  The crystal structure of bulk SrTiO$_3$(STO) transitions from cubic to\ntetragonal at around 105K. Recent local scanning probe measurements of\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ (LAO/STO) interfaces indicated the existence of spatially\ninhomogeneous electrical current paths and electrostatic potential associated\nwith the structural domain formation in the tetragonal phase of STO. However,\nhow these effects impact the electron conduction in LAO/STO devices has not\nbeen fully studied. Here we report a study of temperature dependent electronic\ntransport in combination with the polarized light microscopy of structural\ndomains in mesoscopic scale LAO/STO devices. By reducing the spatial size of\nthe conductive interface to be comparable to the size of a single tetragonal\ndomain of STO, the anisotropy of interfacial electron conduction in\nrelationship to the domain wall and its direction was characterized in the\ntemperature range $T$=10-300K. It was found that the four-point resistance\nmeasured with current parallel to the domain wall in device is larger than the\nresistance measured perpendicular to the domain wall. This observation is\nqualitatively consistent with the current diverting effect from a more\nconductive domain wall within the sample. Among all the samples studied, the\nmaximum resistance ratio found is at least 10 and could be as large as 10$^5$\nat $T$=10K. This electronic anisotropy may have implications on other oxide\nhetero-interfaces and the further understanding of electronic/magnetic\nphenomena found in LAO/STO.\n", "  Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites have been established as good candidate\nmaterials for emerging photovoltaics, with device efficiencies of over 22 %\nbeing reported. There are currently only two organic cations, methylammonium\nand formamidinium, which produce 3D perovskites with band gaps suitable for\nphotovoltaic devices. Numerous computational studies have identified\nazetidinium as a potential third cation for synthesizing organic-inorganic\nperovskites, but to date no experimental reports of azetidinium containing\nperovskites have been published. Here we prepare azetidinium lead iodide for\nthe first time and show that it is a stable, bright orange material that can be\nsuccessfully used as the absorber layer in solar cells. We also show that it is\npossible to make mixed cation devices by adding the azetidinium cation to\nmethylammonium lead iodide. Mixed azetidinium-methylammonium cells show\nimproved performance and reduced hysteresis compared to methylammonium lead\niodide cells.\n", "  We discuss the very rare, exclusive hadronic decays of a Z boson into a meson\nand a photon. The QCD factorization approach allows to organize the decay\namplitude as an expansion in powers of $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}/m_Z\\,$, where the\nleading terms contain convolutions of perturbatively calculable hard functions\nwith the leading-twist light-cone distribution amplitudes of the meson. We find\nthat power corrections to these leading terms are negligible since they are\nsuppressed by the small ratio $(\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}/m_Z)^2\\,$.\nRenormalization-group effects play a crucial role as they render our\ntheoretical predictions less sensitive to the hadronic input parameters which\nare currently not known very precisely. Thus, measurements of the decays $Z\\to\nM\\gamma$ at the LHC or a future lepton collider provide a theoretically very\nclean way to test the QCD factorization approach. The special case where\n$M=\\eta^({}'{}^)$ is complicated by the fact that the decay amplitude receives\nan additional contribution where the meson is formed from a two-gluon state.\nThe corresponding branching ratios are very sensitive to the hadronic\nparameters describing the $\\eta-\\eta'$ system. Future measurements of these\ndecays could yield interesting information about these parameters and the gluon\ndistribution amplitude.\n", "  In this work, we have studied classical and quantum systems in interaction by\nmeans of geometric reduction procedure. The main target is the description in\nthese terms of fundamental interactions. We have shown that, to describe in a\ncanonical way (i.e., in terms of Poisson/Dirac Brackets) even a simple system\nlike the relativistic free particle, one has to deal with non-commutative\npositions. We have explored some consequences of this result in the framework\nof Non-Commutative Geometry and in Quantum Gravity.\n", "  In this paper we consider the role of nonmodal instabilities in the dynamics\nof atmospheric tornadoes. For this purpose we consider the Euler equation,\ncontinuity equation and the equation of state and linearise them. As an example\nwe study several different velocity profiles: the so-called Rankine vortex\nmodel; the Burgers-Rott vortex model; Sullivan and modified Sullivan vortex\nmodels. It has been shown that in the two dimensional Rankine vortex model no\ninstability appears in the inner region of a tornado. On the contrary, outside\nthis area the physical system undergoes strong exponential instability. We have\nfound that initially perturbed velocity components lead to amplified sound wave\nexcitations. The similar results have been shown in Burgers-Rott vortex model\nas well. As it was numerically estimated, in this case, the unstable wave\nincreases its energy by a factor of $400$ only in $\\sim 0.5$min. According to\nthe numerical study, in Sullivan and modified Sullivan models, the instability\ndoes not differ much by the growth. Despite the fact that in the inner area the\nexponential instability does not appear in a purely two dimensional case, we\nhave found that in the modified Sullivan vortex even a small contribution from\nvertical velocities can drive unstable nonmodal waves.\n", "  Current astrophysical models of the interstellar medium assume that small\nscale variation and noise can be modelled as Gaussian random fields or simple\ntransformations thereof, such as lognormal. We use topological methods to\ninvestigate this assumption for three regions of the southern sky. We consider\nGaussian random fields on two-dimensional lattices and investigate the expected\ndistribution of topological structures quantified through Betti numbers. We\ndemonstrate that there are circumstances where differences in topology can\nidentify differences in distributions when conventional marginal or correlation\nanalyses may not. We propose a non-parametric method for comparing two fields\nbased on the counts of topological features and the geometry of the associated\npersistence diagrams. When we apply the methods to the astrophysical data, we\nfind strong evidence against a Gaussian random field model for each of the\nthree regions of the interstellar medium that we consider. Further, we show\nthat there are topological differences at a local scale between these different\nregions.\n", "  Multi-Weyl semimetals(m-WSMS) are characterized by anisotropic non-linear\nenergy dispersion along 2-D plane and a linear dispersion in orthogonal\ndirection. They have topological charge J and are realized when two or multiple\nWeyl nodes with nonzero net monopole charge bring together onto a high-symmetry\npoint. The model Hamiltonians of such systems show various phases such as\ntrivial normal insulators (NIs), WSMs and quantum anomalous Hall(QAH) states\ndepending on the model parameters. We study a periodic driving of such\nHamiltonians in trivial NI phase by circularly polarized light and shows this\nphase can be tunable to Weyl semimetals phase. This transition can be\naccomplished with large anomalous Hall conductivity which could be observed in\ntransport measurements or pump-probe angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nexperiments.\n", "  I propose to replace the dual classical and nonlocal channels used for\nteleporting unknown quantum states in the original protocol (OP) [Bennett, C.\nH., et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 70 1895 (1993)] by either (i) one single quantum\nchannel or (ii) two nonlocal channels in order to turn the OP into an\nall-quantum teleportation (AQT) protocol. Ideally, N runs of single channel AQT\ncan be achieved with a single Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair, in contrast\nwith the OP, which consumes N EPR pairs. In the two nonlocal channels proposal,\nAlice uses the superdense coding technique to send Bob her result, which makes\nAQT more economical than OP.\n", "  The influence of hydride exposure on previously unreported self-assembled\nInP(As) nanostructures is investigated, showing an unexpected morphological\nvariability with growth parameters, and producing a large family of InP(As)\nnanostructures by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy, from dome and ring-like\nstructures to double dot in a ring ensembles. Moreover, preliminary\nmicrophotoluminescence data are indicating the capped rings system as an\ninteresting candidate for single quantum emitters at telecom wavelengths,\npotentially becoming a possible alternative to InAs QDs for quantum technology\nand telecom applications.\n", "  Density functional calculations are used to explain the charge transfer\ndoping mechanism by which species physisorptively bonded to graphene can\nincrease its free hole or electron density, without giving rise to defects, and\nthus maintain a high carrier mobility. Typical dopants studied are FeCl3,\nAuCl3, SbF5, HNO3, MoO3, Cs2O and O2. These systems do not break the {\\pi}\nbonding of the basal plane are particularly important as these do not degrade\nthe carrier mobility. In contrast, more reactive radicals like -OH cause a\npuckering of the basal plane and thereby act as defects.\n", "  Coherent light-matter interaction can be used to manipulate the energy levels\nof atoms, molecules and solids. When light with frequency {\\omega} is detuned\naway from a resonance {\\omega}o, repulsion between the photon-dressed (Floquet)\nstates can lead to a shift of energy resonance. The dominant effect is the\noptical Stark shift (1/({\\omega}0-{\\omega})), but there is an additional\ncontribution from the so-called Bloch-Siegert shift (1/({\\omega}o+{\\omega})).\nAlthough it is common in atoms and molecules, the observation of Bloch-Siegert\nshift in solids has so far been limited only to artificial atoms since the\nshifts were small (<1 {\\mu}eV) and inseparable from the optical Stark shift.\nHere we observe an exceptionally large Bloch-Siegert shift (~10 meV) in\nmonolayer WS2 under infrared optical driving by virtue of the strong\nlight-matter interaction in this system. Moreover, we can disentangle the\nBloch-Siegert shift entirely from the optical Stark shift, because the two\neffects are found to obey opposite selection rules at different valleys. By\ncontrolling the light helicity, we can confine the Bloch-Siegert shift to occur\nonly at one valley, and the optical Stark shift at the other valley. Such a\nvalley-exclusive Bloch-Siegert shift allows for enhanced control over the\nvalleytronic properties in two-dimensional materials, and offers a new avenue\nto explore quantum optics in solids.\n", "  A new method for measuring gravitational lensing with high redshift type Ia\nsupernovae is investigated. The method utilizes correlations between foreground\ngalaxies and supernova brightnesses to substantially reduce possible systematic\nerrors and increase the signal to noise ratio. It is shown that this lensing\nsignal can be related to the mass, size and substructure of galaxy halos and\ngalaxy clusters if dark matter consists of microscopic particles. This\ntechnique may be particularly useful for measuring the size of dark matter\nhalos, a measurement to which the lensing of galaxies is not well suited, and\nfor measuring the level of substructure in galaxy halos, a problematic\nprediction of the cold dark matter model. The contributions to the signal from\ngalaxy halos and galaxy clusters are modeled and contributions to the noise\nfrom fluctuations in the galaxy number counts, galaxy redshift error,\ndispersion in SN luminosities and sample variance are estimated. The intrinsic\ndistribution of supernova luminosities and its redshift evolution are removed\nas major sources of uncertainty. The method is found to be complimentary to\ngalaxy--galaxy lensing. The required observations of $\\simgt 100$ supernovae\nhave already been proposed for the purposes of cosmological parameter\nestimation.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of detecting HI emission from gravitationally\nlensed HI clouds (akin to damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ clouds) at high redshift by\ncarrying out deep radio observations in the fields of known cluster lenses.\nSuch observations will be possible with present radio telescopes only if the\nlens substantially magnifies the flux of the HI emission. While at present this\nholds the only possibility of detecting the HI emission from such clouds, it\nhas the disadvantage of being restricted to clouds that lie very close to the\ncaustics of the lens. We find that observations at a detection threshold of 50\nmicro Jy at 320 MHz (possible with the GMRT) have a greater than 20%\nprobability of detecting an HI cloud in the field of a cluster, provided the\nclouds have HI masses in the range 5 X 10^8 M_{\\odot} < M_{HI} < 2.5 X 10^{10}\nM_{\\odot}. The probability of detecting a cloud increases if they have larger\nHI masses, except in the cases where the number of HI clouds in the cluster\nfield becomes very small. The probability of a detection at 610 MHz and 233 MHz\nis comparable to that at 320 MHz, though a definitive statement is difficult\nowing to uncertainties in the HI content at the redshifts corresponding to\nthese frequencies. Observations at a detection threshold of 2 micro Jy\n(possible in the future with the SKA) are expected to detect a few HI clouds in\nthe field of every cluster provided the clouds have HI masses in the range 2 X\n10^7 M_{\\odot} < M_{HI} < 10^9 M_{\\odot}. Even if such observations do not\nresult in the detection of HI clouds, they will be able to put useful\nconstraints on the HI content of the clouds.\n", "  We present near-IR spectroscopy and HST imaging of EROJ164023, an Extremely\nRed Object (ERO) with R-K=5.9 at z=1.05. EROJ164023 is a disk galaxy, with an\noptical/IR spectral energy distribution which is strongly reddened by dust\n(L_FIR/L_B<~200; A_V~5). The narrow emission lines (~300km/s) and the high\n[NII]/Halpha line ratio indicate that this is a ``composite'' starburst-Seyfert\ngalaxy. Assuming that star formation dominates, we constrain the SFR to be\n10-700Mo/yr from a variety of indicators. We compare EROJ164023 with the only\nother spectroscopically identified dusty EROs: HR10 (z=1.44) and ISOJ1324-2016\n(z=1.50). EROJ164023 and HR10 have similar disk-like morphologies, and both\nexhibit a variation in the apparent dust obscuration depending upon the\ndiagnostic used, suggesting that there is a complex spatial mix of stellar\npopulations and dust in these galaxies. In contrast, the compact morphology and\nspectral properties of ISOJ1324-2016 indicate that it is a dusty quasar. Our\nresults demonstrate that dusty galaxies identified using photometric ERO\ncriteria include pure starbursts, composite systems such as EROJ164023 and\ndusty quasars. We suggest that the classification of EROs into these\nsub-classes cannot be reliably achieved from optical/near-IR photometry and\ninstead requires mid/far-IR or sub-mm photometry and near-IR spectroscopy. The\nadvent of efficient multi-object spectrographs working in the near-IR as well\nas the imminent launch of SIRTF therefore promise the opportunity of rapid\nprogress in our understanding of the elusive ERO population. [Abridged]\n", "  We provide constraints on the AGN contribution to the mid-IR extragalactic\nbackground light from a correlation analysis of deep X-ray and mid-IR\nobservations in two regions centred on the Lockman Hole (LH) and Hubble Deep\nField North (HDFN). Among the 76 galaxies detected by XMM in the LH area (200\nsquare arcminutes), 24 show mid-IR emission, but the relative percentage of\nX-ray sources with mid-IR counterparts increases with the band energy: from 30%\nof the 0.5-2 keV sources up to 63% of the 5-10 keV sources. In contrast, only a\nsmall fraction of the mid-IR sources (around 10%) show X-ray emission. In the\nregion centred on the HDFN (24 square arcminutes), 25% of the mid-IR sources\nare detected in the X-ray, while 30-40% of the X-ray sources show mid-IR\nemission. Under the conservative assumption that all XMM sources are\nAGN-dominated, AGNs contribute 15% of the total mid-IR flux in the LH. For the\nHDFN we have assumed that AGN-dominated sources are luminous X-ray sources with\nradio to X-ray SEDs typical of local AGNs, in which case we find that 18% of\nthe mid-IR flux are due to AGN emission. If we put together all the existing\ninformation from the deepest HDFN data to the shallow large-area BeppoSAX\nobservations in the ELAIS S1 region using the median mid-IR to X-ray spectral\nindices as a function of the X-ray flux, we find an AGN contribution to the\n15um background of 17%. We conclude that the population of IR luminous galaxies\ndetected in the ISOCAM deep surveys are mainly constituted by dust-obscured\nstarbursts.\n", "  We present our optical multicolor photometry for the nearby cluster of\ngalaxies Abell 2255 with 13 intermediate filters in the BATC system. The\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the optical band for more than 7000\nsources are achieved down to V ~ 20 in a field of 58' x 58' centered on this\nrich cluster. Abell 2255 has been recently observed by the SDSS. A method of\ncombining the SDSS photometric data in five broad bands and the BATC SEDs is\nthen explored. The application of the technique of photometric redshift shows\nthat the combined SEDs with higher resolution could lead to a more accurate\nestimate of photometric redshift. Based on 214 spectroscopically confirmed\nmember galaxies, the bimodality and large dispersion in the velocity\ndistribution indicate that Abell 2255 is an unrelaxed system. A tight\ncolor-magnitude correlation for 188 known early-type cluster galaxies is found.\nAfter an exclusion of 254 extragalactic sources with known redshifts, the\ncombined SEDs for 2522 galaxies allow a further membership selection by the\nphotometric redshift technique and color-magnitude correlation. As a result,\n313 galaxies with their photometric redshifts between 0.068 and 0.090 are\nselected as new cluster members. The combined SEDs and estimated redshifts for\npreviously known and newly-selected member galaxies are cataloged. On the basis\nof the enlarged sample of member galaxies, the spatial distribution, localized\nvelocity structure, color-magnitude relation, and luminosity function of\ncluster galaxies are discussed. The reverse peculiar velocities are found for\ntwo satellite subclusters located on opposite sides of the central\nconcentration, which supports an ongoing merger in Abell 2255.\n", "  IRAC imaging of a 4'7x4'7 area in the Lockman Hole detected over 400 galaxies\nin the IRAC 3.6 micron and 4.5 micron bands, 120 in the 5.8 micron, and 80 in\nthe 8 micron bandin 30 minutes of observing time. Color-color diagrams suggest\nthat about half of these galaxies are at redshifts 0.6<z<1.3 with about a\nquarter at higher redshifts (z>1.3). We also detect IRAC counterparts for 6 of\nthe 7 SCUBA sources and all 9 XMM sources in this area. The detection of the\ncounterparts of the SCUBA sources and galaxies at z>1.3 demonstrates the\nability of IRAC to probe the universe at very high redshifts.\n", "  The ELAIS S1 field was observed by GALEX in both its Wide Spectroscopic and\nDeep Imaging Survey modes. This field was previously observed by the Infrared\nSpace Observatory and we made use of the catalogue of multi-wavelength data\npublished by the ELAIS consortium to select galaxies common to the two samples.\nAmong the 959 objects with GALEX spectroscopy, 88 are present in the ELAIS\ncatalog and 19 are galaxies with an optical spectroscopic redshift. The\ndistribution of redshifts covers the range $0<z<1.6$. The selected galaxies\nhave bolometric IR luminosities $10<Log(L_{IR})<13$ (deduced from the $15 \\mu\nm$ flux using ISOCAM) which means that we cover a wide range of galaxies from\nnormal to Ultra Luminous IR Galaxies. The mean ($\\sigma$) UV luminosity (not\ncorrected for extinction) amounts to $Log(\\lambda.L_{1530}) = 9.8 (0.6)$\n$L_\\sun$ for the low-z ($z \\le 0.35$) sample. The UV slope $\\beta$ (assuming\n$f_\\lambda \\propto \\lambda^\\beta$) correlates with the GALEX FUV-NUV color if\nthe sample is restricted to galaxies below $z < 0.1$. Taking advantage of the\nUV and IR data, we estimate the dust attenuation from the IR/UV ratio and\ncompare it to the UV slope $\\beta$. We find that it is not possible to uniquely\nestimate the dust attenuation from $\\beta$ for our sample of galaxies. These\ngalaxies are highly extinguished with a median value $A_{FUV} = 2.7 \\pm 0.8$.\nOnce the dust correction applied, the UV- and IR-based SFRs correlate. For the\nclosest galaxy with the best quality spectrum, we see a feature consistent with\nbeing produced by a bump near 220nm in the attenuation curve.\n", "  Using deep observations of the Chandra Deep Field South obtained with MIPS at\n24mic, we present our preliminary estimates on the evolution of the infrared\n(IR) luminosity density of the Universe from z=0 to z~1. We find that a pure\ndensity evolution of the IR luminosity function is clearly excluded by the\ndata. The characteristic luminosity L_IR* evolves at least by (1+z)^3.5 with\nlookback time, but our monochromatic approach does not allow us to break the\ndegeneracy between a pure evolution in luminosity or an evolution in both\ndensity and luminosity. Our results imply that IR luminous systems (L_IR >\n10^11 L_sol) become the dominant population contributing to the comoving IR\nenergy density beyond z~0.5-0.6. The uncertainties affecting our measurements\nare largely dominated by the poor constraints on the spectral energy\ndistributions that are used to translate the observed 24mic flux into\nluminosities.\n", "  We present near-infrared spectroscopy and narrow-band imaging at the\nwavelength of redshifted H-alpha for a sample of 30 high-redshift, far-infrared\nluminous galaxies. This sample is selected from surveys in the sub-millimeter,\nmillimeter and radio wavebands and has complete redshift coverage with a median\nredshift of z~2.4. Removing obvious AGN, we find that the predicted H-alpha\nstar formation rates in this diverse population are suppressed (by ~10x)\ncompared to those derived from their far-infrared luminosities. We estimate\nthat AGN are present in at least 40% of the galaxies in our sample. To further\ninvestigate this, we construct a composite rest-frame spectrum for both the\nentire sample and for those galaxies which individually show no signs of\nnuclear activity. We find [NII]/H-alpha ratios for both composite spectra which\nsuggest that the energy output of the galaxies is star-formation- rather than\nAGN-dominated. The median H-alpha line width for our sample (removing obvious\nAGN) is 400+/-70km/s (FWHM), and the typical spatial extent of the H-alpha\nemission in our narrow-band observations is < 4-8kpc, which indicates a\ndynamical mass of 1-2 x 10^11 Mo. This estimate is larger than recent estimates\nof the dynamical masses of UV-selected galaxies at similar redshifts derived in\nan identical manner. We also compared our H-alpha and far-infrared luminosities\nwith deep Chandra observations of a subset of our survey fields and use these\ndata to further assess their AGN content. We conclude that these high-redshift,\nfar-infrared luminous galaxies represent a population of massive, metal-rich,\nmerging systems with high instantaneous star formation rates, strong dust\nobscuration and actively-fueled AGN which are likely to be the progenitors of\nmassive local elliptical galaxies. (abridged)\n", "  We present results from an SED analysis of two lensed high-z objects, the\nz=6.56 galaxy HCM6A behind the cluster Abell 370 discovered by Hu et al. (2002)\nand the triple arc at z~7 behind Abell 2218 found by Kneib et al. (2004). For\nHCM 6A we find indications for the presence of dust in this galaxy, and we\nestimate the properties of its stellar populations (SFR, age, etc.), and the\nintrinsic Lyman-alpha emission. From the \"best fit\" reddening (E(B-V)~0.25) its\nestimated luminosity is L~(1-4)e.+11 Lsun, in the range of luminous infrared\ngalaxies. For the arc behind Abell 2218 we find a most likely redshift of\nz~6.0-7.2 taking into account both our photometric determination and lensing\nconsiderations. SED fits indicate generally a low extinction but do not\nstrongly constrain the SF history. Best fits have typical ages of ~3 to 400\nMyr. The apparent 4000 Ang break observed recently by Egami et al. (2004) from\ncombination of IRAC/Spitzer and HST observations can also well be reproduced\nwith templates of young populations (~15 Myr or even younger) and does not\nnecessarily imply old ages. Finally, we briefly examine the detectability of\ndusty lensed high-z galaxies with Herschel and ALMA.\n", "  We present H-band infra-red galaxy data to a 3 sigma limit of H=22.9 and\noptical-infra-red colours of galaxies on the William Herschel Deep Field. These\ndata were taken from a 7'x 7' area observed for 14 hours with the Omega Prime\ncamera on the 3.5-m Calar Alto telescope. We derive H-band number counts,\ncolour-magnitude diagrams and colour histograms. We review our Pure Luminosity\nEvolution galaxy count models based on the spectral synthesis models of Bruzual\n& Charlot. These PLE models give an excellent fit to the our H band count data\nto H<22.5 and HDF count data to H<28. However, PLE models with a Salpeter IMF\nfor early-type galaxies overestimate the average galaxy redshift in K<20 galaxy\nredshift surveys. Models that assume a steep x=3 IMF give better agreement\ndata, although they do show an unobserved peak in B-H and I-H colour\ndistributions at faint H magnitudes corresponding to z>1 early-type galaxies.\nThis feature may simply reflect a larger scatter in optical-infra-red colours\nthan in the B-R colour of early-type galaxies at this redshift. This scatter is\nobvious in optical-IR colour-colour diagrams and may be explained by on-going\nstar-formation in an intermediate sub-population of early-type galaxies. The\nnumbers of EROs detected are a factor of 2-3 lower than predicted by the\nearly-type models that assume the Salpeter IMF and in better agreement with\nthose that assume the x=3 IMF. The tight sequence of early-type galaxies also\nshows a sub-class which is simultaneously redder in infrared bands and bluer in\nthe bluer bands than the classical, passive early-type galaxy; this sub-class\nappears at relatively low redshifts and may constitute an intermediate age,\nearly-type population.\n", "  We have computed the evolution of the rest-frame B-band luminosity function\n(LF) for bulge and disk-dominated galaxies since z=1.2. We use a sample of 605\nspectroscopic redshifts with I_{AB}<24 in the Chandra Deep Field South from the\nVIMOS-VLT Deep Survey, 3555 galaxies with photometric redshifts from the\nCOMBO-17 multi-color data, coupled with multi-color HST/ACS images from the\nGreat Observatories Origin Deep Survey. We split the sample in bulge- and\ndisk-dominated populations on the basis of asymmetry and concentration\nparameters measured in the rest-frame B-band. We find that at z=0.4-0.8, the LF\nslope is significantly steeper for the disk-dominated population (\\alpha=-1.19\n\\pm 0.07) compared to the bulge-dominated population (\\alpha=-0.53 \\pm 0.13).\nThe LF of the bulge-dominated population is composed of two distinct\npopulations separated in rest-frame color: 68% of red (B-I)_{AB}>0.9 and bright\ngalaxies showing a strongly decreasing LF slope \\alpha=+0.55 \\pm 0.21, and 32%\nof blue (B-I)_{AB}<0.9 and more compact galaxies which populate the LF\nfaint-end. We observe that red bulge-dominated galaxies are already well in\nplace at z~1, but the volume density of this population is increasing by a\nfactor 2.7 between z~1 and z~0.6. It may be related to the building-up of\nmassive elliptical galaxies in the hierarchical scenario. In addition, we\nobserve that the blue bulge-dominated population is dimming by 0.7 magnitude\nbetween z~1 and z~0.6. Galaxies in this faint and more compact population could\npossibly be the progenitors of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n", "  We present a new K-band survey covering 623 arcmin$^2$ in the VVDS 0226-0430\ndeep field down to a limiting magnitude K$_{\\rm{Vega}}$ $\\leq$ 20.5. We use the\nspectroscopic sample extracted from this new K-band catalogue to assess the\neffectiveness of optical-near infrared color selections in identifying extreme\nclasses of objects at high redshift.\n", "  (Abbrev.) This paper prepares a series of papers analysing the Intermediate\nMAss Galaxy Evolution Sequence (IMAGES) up to z=1. Intermediate mass galaxies\n(MJ <=-20.3) are selected from the Chandra Deep Field South (CDFS) for which we\nidentify a serious lack of spectroscopically determined redshifts..... We have\nspectroscopically identified 691 objects including 580 gal., 7 QSOs, and 104\nstars. This study provides 531 new redshifts in the CDFS. It confirms the\npresence of several large scale structures in the CDFS. To test the impact of\nthese structures in the GOODS-South field, we ... compare the evolution of\nrest-frame U, B, V and K galaxy luminosity densities to that derived from the\nCFRS. The CDFS field shows a significant excess of luminosity densities in the\nz=0.5-0.75 range, which increases with the wavelength, reaching up to 0.5 dex\nat 2.1 um. Stellar mass and specific star formation evolutions might be\nsignificantly affected by the presence of the peculiar large scale structures\nat z= 0.668 and at z= 0.735, that contain a significant excess of evolved,\nmassive galaxies when compared to other fields. This leads to a clear warning\nto results based on the CDFS/GOODS South fields, especially those related to\nthe evolution of red luminosity densities, i.e. stellar mass density and\nspecific star formation rate. Photometric redshift techniques, when applied to\nthat field, are producing quantities which are apparently less affected by\ncosmic variance (0.25 dex at 2.1 um), however at the cost of the difficulty in\ndisentangling between evolutionary and cosmic variance effects.\n", "  I describe very briefly the new libraries of empirical spectra of stars\ncovering wide ranges of values of the atmospheric parameters Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], as well as spectral type, that have become available in the recent\npast, among them the HNGSL, MILES, UVES-POP, and Indo-US libraries. I show the\nresults of using the HNGSL to build population synthesis models. These\nlibraries are complementary in spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, and\nwill prove extremely useful to describe spectral features expected in galaxy\nspectra from the NUV to the NIR.\n", "  Recent calculations of evolutionary tracks of TP-AGB stars of different mass\nand metallicity by Marigo et al. (2007) have been incorporated in the Bruzual &\nCharlot evolutionary population synthesis models. The mass of the stellar\npopulation in HUDF galaxies at z from 1 to 3 determined from fits to the\nspectro-photometric data of these galaxies is 50 to 80% lower than the mass\ndetermined from the BC03 models. The ages inferred for these populations are,\nwith exceptions, 40 to 60% of the BC03 estimates.\n", "  Chemically peculiar stars present spectral and photometric variability with a\nsingle period. In the oblique rotator model, the non homogeneous distribution\nof elements on the stellar surface is at the origin of the observed variations.\nAs to helium weak stars, it has been suggested that photometric and helium line\nequivalent width variations are out of phase. To understand the behaviour of\nhelium in CP stars, we have obtained time resolved spectra of the HeI5876 A\nline for a sample of 16 chemically peculiar stars in the spectral range B3 --\nA1 and belonging to different sub-groups. The HeI5876 A line is too weak to be\nmeasured in the spectra of the stars HD 24155, HD 41269, and HD 220825. No\nvariation of the equivalent width of the selected He line has been revealed in\nthe stars HD 22920, HD 24587, HD 36589, HD 49606, and HD 209515. The equivalent\nwidth variation of the HeI5876 A line is in phase with the photometric\nvariability for the stars HD 43819, HD 171247 and HD 176582. On the contrary it\nis out of phase for the stars HD 28843, HD 182255 and HD 223640. No clear\nrelation has been found for the stars HD 26571 and HD 177003.\n", "  We present 3 methods for the subtraction of non-cosmic and unresolved cosmic\nbackgrounds observed by the Low-Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (LECS)\non-board BeppoSAX. Removal of these backgrounds allows a more accurate modeling\nof the spectral data from point and small-scale extended sources. At high\n(>|25| degree) galactic latitudes, subtraction using a standard background\nspectrum works well. At low galactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the\nX-ray sky, two alternative methods are presented. The first uses counts\nobtained from two semi-annuli near the outside of the LECS field of view to\nestimate the background at the source location. The second method uses ROSAT\nPosition Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) all-sky survey data to estimate\nthe LECS background spectrum for a given pointing position. A comparison of the\nresults from these methods provides an estimate of the systematic\nuncertainties. For high galactic latitude fields, all 3 methods give 3 sigma\nconfidence uncertainties of <0.9 10^-3 count/s (0.1-10 keV), or <1.5 10^-3\ncount/s (0.1-2 keV). These correspond to 0.1-2.0 keV fluxes of 0.7-1.8 and\n0.5-1.1 10^-13 erg/cm2/s for a power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 and\nphotoelectric absorption of 3 10^20 and 3 10^21 atom/cm2, respectively. At low\ngalactic latitudes, or in complex regions of the X-ray sky, the uncertainties\nare a factor ~2.5 higher.\n", "  We present two catalogues of galaxies in the direction of the rich cluster\nAbell 496. The first one includes 3,879 galaxies located in a region of roughly\n1.3 degrees from the cluster centre. It has been obtained from a list of more\nthan 35,000 galaxy candidates detected by scanning part of a Schmidt\nphotographic plate taken in the b_J band. Positions are very accurate in this\ncatalogue but magnitudes are not. This led us to perform CCD imaging\nobservations in the V and R bands to calibrate these photographic magnitudes. A\nsecond catalogue gives a list of galaxies with CCD magnitudes in the V (239\ngalaxies) and R (610 galaxies) bands for a much smaller region in the centre of\nthe cluster. These two catalogues will be combined with a redshift catalogue of\n466 galaxies (Durret et al. 1999) to investigate the cluster properties at\noptical wavelengths (Durret et al. in preparation), as a complement to previous\nX-ray studies by a member of our group (Pislar 1998).\n", "  The equation of state and the shock Hugoniot of deuterium are calculated\nusing a first-principles approach, for the conditions of the recent shock\nexperiments. We use density functional theory within a classical mapping of the\nquantum fluids [ Phys. Rev. Letters, {\\bf 84}, 959 (2000) ]. The calculated\nHugoniot is close to the Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) result. We also\nconsider the {\\it quasi-equilibrium} two-temperature case where the Deuterons\nare hotter than the electrons; the resulting quasi-equilibrium Hugoniot mimics\nthe laser-shock data. The increased compressibility arises from hot $D^+-e$\npairs occuring close to the zero of the electron chemical potential.\n", "  Path integral Monte Carlo simulations have been used to study deuterium at\nhigh pressure and temperature. The equation of state has been derived in the\ntemperature and density region of 10000 < T < 1000000 K and 0.6 < rho < 2.5\ngcm-3. A series of shock Hugoniot curves is computed for different initial\ncompressions in order to compare with current and future shock wave experiments\nusing liquid deuterium samples precompressed in diamond anvil cells.\n"]}
