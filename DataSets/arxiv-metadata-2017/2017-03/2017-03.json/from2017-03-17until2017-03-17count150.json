As an example,\nwe consider the quantum non-linear Schr\\\"odinger model. We derive\nlong-distance/long-time asymptotic behavior of various two-point functions of\nthis model. We also compute edge exponents and amplitudes characterizing the\npower-law behavior of dynamical response functions on the particle/hole\nexcitation thresholds. These last results confirm predictions based on the\nnon-linear Luttinger liquid method. Our results rely on a first principles\nderivation, based on the microscopic analysis of the model, without invoking,\nat any stage, some correspondence with a continuous field theory. Furthermore,\nour approach only makes use of certain general properties of the model, so that\nit should be applicable, with possibly minor modifications, to a wide class of\n(not necessarily integrable) gapless one dimensional Hamiltonians.\n", "  Antioxidant capacity of garlic has been attributed to organic sulfur\ncompounds such us allyl methyl disulfide. Using quantum chemical calculations\nat B3LYP/6-31+G (d) and G3MP2B3/6-31+G (d) levels of theory, we study three\npossible oxidation reactions of this compound against hydrogen peroxide, a\nreactive oxygen species, from a thermodynamic point of view. Because these\nreactions are supposed to occur in biological media, solvent effect was taken\ninto consideration. Oxidation over the double bond that leads to the formation\nof an epoxide is more thermodynamically feasible, limiting the antioxidant\ncapacity of this compound.\n", "  A large class of physical systems involves the vanishing of a 1-form on a\nmanifold as a constraint on the acceptable states. This means that one is\nalways dealing with the Pfaff problem in those cases. In particular, knowing\nthe degree of integrability of the 1-form is often essential, or, what amounts\nto the same thing, its canonical (i.e., normal) form. This paper consists of\ntwo parts: In the first part, the Pfaff problem is presented and discussed in a\nlargely mathematical way, and in the second part, the mathematical generalities\nthus introduced are applied to various physical models in which the normal form\nof a 1-form has already been implicitly introduced, such as non-conservative\nforces, linear non-holonomic constraints, the theory of vortices and\nequilibrium thermodynamics. The role of integrability in the conservation of\nenergy is a recurring theme.\n", "  We analyze the photometric data and spectroscopic data that collect on the\n$\\delta$ Scuti star AE UMa. The fundamental and the first overtone frequencies\nare confirmed as $f_{0} = 11.62560$\\,c\\,d$^{-1}$ and $f_{1} =\n15.03124$\\,c\\,d$^{-1}$, respectively, from the frequency content by analyzing\nof the 40 nights light curve spanning from 2009 to 2012. Additionally, another\n37 frequencies are identified as either the harmonics or the linear\ncombinations of the fundamental and the first overtone frequencies, among which\n25 are newly detected.\n  The rate of period change of the fundamental mode is determined as\n$(1/P_{0})(dP_{0}/dt) = 5.4(\\pm 1.9) \\times 10^{-9}$\\,yr$^{-1}$ as revealed\nfrom the $O-C$ diagram based on the 84 newly determined times of maximum light\ncombined with those derived from the literature. The spectroscopic data\nsuggests that AE UMa is a population\\,I $\\delta$ Scuti star. With these\nphysical properties, we perform theoretical explorations based on the stellar\nevolution code MESA on this target, considering that the variation of pulsation\nperiod is caused by secular evolutionary effects. We finally constraint the AE\nUMa with the physical parameters as: the mass of $1.805 \\pm 0.055\\ M_{\\odot}$,\nthe radius of $1.647 \\pm 0.032 \\times 10^{11}$\\,cm, the luminosity of $1.381\n\\pm 0.048~(\\log L/L_{\\odot})$ and the age of $1.055 \\pm 0.095 \\times\n10^{9}$\\,yr. AE UMa can be the (Pop. I) $\\delta$ Scuti star that locates just\nafter the second turn-off of its evolutional track leaving the main sequence, a\nstar in the phase of the Hertzsprung Gap with a helium core and a\nhydrogen-burning shell.\n", "  We consider general cyclic representations of the 6-vertex Yang-Baxter\nalgebra and analyze the associated quantum integrable systems, the\nBazhanov-Stroganov model and the corresponding chiral Potts model on finite\nsize lattices. We first determine the propagator operator in terms of the\nchiral Potts transfer matrices and we compute the scalar product of separate\nstates (including the transfer matrix eigenstates) as a single determinant\nformulae in the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables. Then,\nwe solve the quantum inverse problem and reconstruct the local operators in\nterms of the separate variables. We also determine a basis of operators whose\nform factors are characterized by a single determinant formulae. This implies\nthat the form factors of any local operator are expressed as finite sums of\ndeterminants. Among these form factors written in determinant form are in\nparticular those which will reproduce the chiral Potts order parameters in the\nthermodynamic limit.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a quantum heavy particle undergoing a repulsive\ninteraction with a light one. The main motivation is the detailed description\nof the loss of coherence induced on a quantum system (in our model, the heavy\nparticle) by the interaction with the environment (the light particle). The\ncontent of the paper is analytical and numerical. Concerning the analytical\ncontribution, we show that an approximate description of the dynamics of the\nheavy particle can be carried out in two steps: first comes the interaction,\nthen the free evolution. In particular, all effects of the interaction can be\nembodied in the action of a collision operator that acts on the initial state\nof the heavy particle. With respect to previous analytical results on the same\ntopics, we turn our focus from the M{\\o}ller wave operator to the full\nscattering operator, whose analysis proves to be simpler. Concerning the\nnumerical contribution, we exploit the previous analysis to construct an\nefficient numerical scheme that turns the original, multiscale, two-body\nproblem in two one-body problems which can be solved separately. This leads to\na considerable gain in simulation time. We present and interpret some\nsimulations carried out on specific one-dimensional systems by using the new\nscheme. Finally, we propose a new description of the mechanism of decoherence\ninduced by scattering: decoherence is produced by an interference-free bump\nwhich arises from the initial state of the heavy particle immediately after the\ncollision. We support such a picture by numerical evidence as well as by an\napproximation theorem.\n", "  We provide a microscopic model setting that allows us to readily access to\nthe large-distance asymptotic behaviour of multi-point correlation functions in\nmassless, one-dimensional, quantum models. The method of analysis we propose is\nbased on the form factor expansion of the correlation functions and does not\nbuild on any field theory reasonings. It constitutes an extension of the\nrestricted sum techniques leading to the large-distance asymptotic behaviour of\ntwo-point correlation functions obtained previously.\n", "  Nonlinear dynamics of surface gravity waves trapped by an opposing jet\ncurrent is studied analytically and numerically. For wave fields narrowband in\nfrequency but not necessarily with narrow angular distributions the developed\nasymptotic weakly nonlinear theory based on the modal approach of (V. Shrira,\nA. Slunyaev, J. Fluid. Mech, 738, 65, 2014) leads to the one-dimensional\nmodified nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation of self-focusing type for a single\nmode. Its solutions such as envelope solitons and breathers are considered to\nbe prototypes of rogue waves; these solutions, in contrast to waves in the\nabsence of currents, are robust with respect to transverse perturbations, which\nsuggests potentially higher probability of rogue waves. Robustness of the\nlong-lived analytical solutions in form of the modulated trapped waves and\nsolitary wave groups is verified by direct numerical simulations of potential\nEuler equations.\n", "  We solve the longstanding problem to define a functional characterization of\nthe spectrum of the transfer matrix associated to the most general spin-1/2\nrepresentations of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for general inhomogeneous\nchains. The corresponding homogeneous limit reproduces the spectrum of the\nHamiltonian of the spin-1/2 open XXZ and XXX quantum chains with the most\ngeneral integrable boundaries. The spectrum is characterized by a second order\nfinite difference functional equation of Baxter type with an inhomogeneous term\nwhich vanishes only for some special but yet interesting non-diagonal boundary\nconditions. This functional equation is shown to be equivalent to the known\nseparation of variable (SOV) representation hence proving that it defines a\ncomplete characterization of the transfer matrix spectrum. The polynomial\ncharacter of the Q-function allows us then to show that a finite system of\nequations of generalized Bethe type can be similarly used to describe the\ncomplete transfer matrix spectrum.\n", "  We present measurements of elliptic flow ($v_2$) of electrons from the decays\nof heavy-flavor hadrons ($e_{HF}$) by the STAR experiment. For Au+Au collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV we report $v_2$, for transverse momentum\n($p_T$) between 0.2 and 7 GeV/c using three methods: the event plane method\n($v_{2}${EP}), two-particle correlations ($v_2${2}), and four-particle\ncorrelations ($v_2${4}). For Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 62.4 and\n39 GeV we report $v_2${2} for $p_T< 2$ GeV/c. $v_2${2} and $v_2${4} are\nnon-zero at low and intermediate $p_T$ at 200 GeV, and $v_2${2} is consistent\nwith zero at low $p_T$ at other energies. The $v_2${2} at the two lower beam\nenergies is systematically lower than at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = $ 200 GeV for\n$p_T < 1$ GeV/c. This difference may suggest that charm quarks interact less\nstrongly with the surrounding nuclear matter at those two lower energies\ncompared to $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV.\n", "  Irregular waves which experience the time-limited external forcing within the\nframework of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation are studied numerically.\nIt is shown that the adiabatically slow pumping (the time scale of forcing is\nmuch longer than the nonlinear time scale) results in selective enhancement of\nthe solitary part of the wave ensemble. The slow forcing provides eventually\nwider wavenumber spectra, larger values of kurtosis and higher probability of\nlarge waves. In the opposite case of rapid forcing the nonlinear waves readjust\npassing through the stage of fast surges of statistical characteristics. Single\nforced envelope solitons are considered with the purpose to better identify the\nrole of coherent wave groups. An approximate description on the basis of\nsolutions of the integrable NLS equation is provided. Applicability of the\nBenjamin - Feir Index to forecasting of conditions favourable for rogue waves\nis discussed.\n", "  The raising of both indices in the components of the Minkowski\nelectromagnetic field strength 2-form to give the components of the\nelectromagnetic excitation bivector field can be regarded as being equivalent\nto an electromagnetic constitutive law, as well as being defined by the\ncomponents of the spacetime metric. This notion is clarified, and the nature of\nthe equivalent dielectric tensors and magnetic permeability tensors that are\ndefined by some common spacetime metrics is discussed. The relationship of the\nbasic construction to effective metrics is discussed, and, in particular, the\nfact that this effective metric is more general than the Gordon metric.\n", "  Starting from the finite volume form factors of local operators, we show how\nand under which hypothesis the $c=1$ free boson conformal field theory in\ntwo-dimensions emerges as an effective theory governing the large-distance\nregime of multi-point correlation functions in a large class of one dimensional\nmassless quantum Hamiltonians. In our approach, in the large-distance critical\nregime, the local operators of the initial model are represented by well suited\nvertex operators associated to the free boson model. This provides an effective\nfield theoretic description of the large distance behaviour of correlation\nfunctions in 1D quantum critical models. We develop this description starting\nfrom the first principles and directly at the microscopic level, namely in\nterms of the properties of the finite volume matrix elements of local\noperators.\n", "  Entangled states are in conflict with a general physical principle which\nexpresses that a composite entity exists if and only if its components also\nexist, and the hypothesis that pure states represent the actuality of a\nphysical entity, i.e., its 'existence'. A possible way to solve this paradox\nconsists in completing the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, by adding\nmore pure states. We show that this can be done, in a consistent way, by using\nthe extended Bloch representation of quantum mechanics, recently introduced to\nprovide a possible solution to the measurement problem. Hence, with the\nsolution proposed by the extended Bloch representation of quantum mechanics,\nthe situation of entangled states regains full intelligibility.\n", "  In quantum theory particles are represented as wave packets. Shock wave\nanalysis of quantum equations of motion shows that wave function representation\nin general and wave packet description in particular contains discontinuities\ndue to a non-zero quantum force. The quantum force causes wave packet\ndispersion which results in the intersection of characteristic curves\ndeveloping a shock discontinuity. Since quantum force vanishes for localized\nquantum density waves [1], it is thus established that localized quantum\ndensity waves form the only class of wave function representation of particles\nin quantum theory without shock wave discontinuities.\n", "  In the present article we study the form factors of quantum integrable\nlattice models solvable by the separation of variables (SoV) method. It was\nrecently shown that these models admit universal determinant representations\nfor the scalar products of the so-called separate states (a class which\nincludes in particular all the eigenstates of the transfer matrix). These\nresults permit to obtain simple expressions for the matrix elements of local\noperators (form factors). However, these representations have been obtained up\nto now only for the completely inhomogeneous versions of the lattice models\nconsidered. In this article we give a simple algebraic procedure to rewrite the\nscalar products (and hence the form factors) for the SoV related models as\nIzergin or Slavnov type determinants. This new form leads to simple expressions\nfor the form factors in the homogeneous and thermodynamic limits. To make the\npresentation of our method clear, we have chosen to explain it first for the\nsimple case of the $XXX$ Heisenberg chain with anti-periodic boundary\nconditions. We would nevertheless like to stress that the approach presented in\nthis article applies as well to a wide range of models solved in the SoV\nframework.\n", "  Many complex systems have natural representations as multi-layer networks.\nWhile these formulations retain more information than standard single-layer\nnetwork models, there is not yet a fully developed theory for computing network\nmetrics and statistics on these objects. We introduce a family of models of\nmultiplex processes motivated by dynamical applications and investigate the\nproperties of their spectra both theoretically and computationally. We study\nspecial cases of multiplex diffusion and Markov dynamics, using the spectral\nresults to compute their rates of convergence. We use our framework to define a\nversion of multiplex eigenvector centrality, which generalizes some existing\nnotions in the literature. Last, we compare our operator to\nstructurally-derived models on synthetic and real-world networks, helping\ndelineate the contexts in which the different frameworks are appropriate.\n", "  We propose a new way of looking at the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the\nLarge Scale Structure clustering correlation function. We identify a scale s_LP\nthat has two fundamental features: its position is insensitive to non-linear\ngravity, redshift space distortions, and scale-dependent bias at the 0.5%\nlevel; it is geometrical, i.e. independent of the power spectrum of the\nprimordial density fluctuation parameters. These two properties together make\ns_LP, called the \"linear point\", an excellent cosmological standard ruler. The\nlinear point is also appealing because it is easily identified irrespectively\nof how non-linearities distort the correlation function. Finally, the\ncorrelation function amplitude at s_LP is similarly insensitive to non-linear\ncorrections to within a few percent. Hence, exploiting the particular Baryon\nfeatures in the correlation function, we propose three new estimators for\ngrowth measurements. A preliminary analysis of s_LP in current data is\nencouraging.\n", "  We study theoretically the quantum dynamics of nitrogen molecules (N$_2$)\nexposed to intense and ultrafast x-rays at a wavelength of 1.1 nm (1100 eV\nphoton energy) from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) free electron laser.\nMolecular rate equations are derived to describe the intertwined\nphotoionization, decay, and dissociation processes occurring for N$_2$. This\nmodel complements our earlier phenomenological approaches, the single-atom,\nsymmetric-sharing, and fragmentation-matrix models of J. Chem. Phys.\n$\\mathbf{136}$, 214310 (2012). Our rate-equations are used to obtain the\neffective pulse energy at the sample and the time scale for the dissociation of\nthe metastable dication N$_2^{2+}$. This leads to a very good agreement between\nthe theoretically and experimentally obtained ion yields and, consequently, the\naverage charge states. The effective pulse energy is found to decrease with\nshortening pulse duration. This variation together with a change in the\nmolecular fragmentation pattern and frustrated absorption---an effect that\nreduces absorption of x-rays due to (double) core hole formation---are the\ncauses for the drop of the average charge state with shortening LCLS pulse\nduration discovered previously.\n", "  We demonstrate simultaneous center-of-mass cooling of two coupled\noscillators, consisting of a microsphere-cantilever and a tapered optical\nfiber. Excitation of a whispering gallery mode (WGM) of the microsphere, via\nthe evanescent field of the taper, provides a transduction signal that\ncontinuously monitors the relative motion between these two microgram objects\nwith a sensitivity of 3 pm. The cavity enhanced optical dipole force is used to\nprovide feedback damping on the motion of the micron-diameter taper, whereas a\npiezo stack is used to damp the motion of the much larger (up to $180\\,\\mu$m in\ndiameter), heavier (up to $1.5\\times 10^{-7}\\,$kg) and stiffer\nmicrosphere-cantilever. In each feedback scheme multiple mechanical modes of\neach oscillator can be cooled, and mode temperatures below 10 K are reached for\nthe dominant mode, consistent with limits determined by the measurement noise\nof our system. This represents stabilization on the picometer level and is the\nfirst demonstration of using WGM resonances to cool the mechanical modes of\nboth the WGM resonator and its coupling waveguide.\n", "  In this article, we revisit the problem of coherent multi-detector search of\ngravitational wave from compact binary coalescence with Neutron stars and Black\nHoles using advanced interferometers like LIGO-Virgo. Based on the loss of\noptimal multi-detector signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we construct a hybrid\nstatistic as a best of maximum-likelihood-ratio(MLR) statistic tuned for\nface-on and face-off binaries. The statistical properties of the hybrid\nstatistic is studied. The performance of this hybrid statistic is compared with\nthat of the coherent MLR statistic for generic inclination angles. Owing to the\nsingle synthetic data stream, the hybrid statistic gives low false alarms\ncompared to the multi-detector MLR statistic and small fractional loss in the\noptimum SNR for a large range of binary inclinations. We have demonstrated that\nfor a LIGO-Virgo network and binary inclination, \\epsilon < 70 deg. and\n\\epsilon > 110 deg., the hybrid statistic captures more than 98% of network\noptimum matched filter SNR with low false alarm rate. The Monte-Carlo exercise\nwith two distributions of incoming inclination angles namely, U[cos(\\epsilon)]\nand more realistic distribution proposed by B. F. Schutz are performed with\nhybrid statistic and gave ~5% and ~7% higher detection probability respectively\ncompared to the two stream multi-detector MLR statistic for a fixed false alarm\nprobability of 10^-5.\n", "  We introduce a tensor renormalization group scheme for coarse-graining a\ntwo-dimensional tensor network that can be successfully applied to both\nclassical and quantum systems on and off criticality. The key innovation in our\nscheme is to deform a 2D tensor network into small loops and then optimize the\ntensors on each loop. In this way, we remove short-range entanglement at each\niteration step and significantly improve the accuracy and stability of the\nrenormalization flow. We demonstrate our algorithm in the classical Ising model\nand a frustrated 2D quantum model.\n", "  In this paper we study the quantum sheaf cohomology of Grassmannians with\ndeformations of the tangent bundle. Quantum sheaf cohomology is a (0,2)\ndeformation of the ordinary quantum cohomology ring, realized as the OPE ring\nin A/2-twisted theories. Quantum sheaf cohomology has previously been computed\nfor abelian gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs); here, we study (0,2)\ndeformations of nonabelian GLSMs, for which previous methods have been\nintractable. Combined with the classical result, the quantum ring structure is\nderived from the one-loop effective potential. We also utilize recent advances\nin supersymmetric localization to compute A/2 correlation functions and check\nthe general result in examples. In this paper we focus on physics derivations\nand examples; in a companion paper, we will provide a mathematically rigorous\nderivation of the classical sheaf cohomology ring.\n", "  Three-dimensional Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) is a promising technique\nto reconstruct the nerve fiber architecture of human post-mortem brains from\nbirefringence measurements of histological brain sections with micrometer\nresolution. To better understand how the reconstructed fiber orientations are\nrelated to the underlying fiber structure, numerical simulations are employed.\nHere, we present two complementary simulation approaches that reproduce the\nentire 3D-PLI analysis: First, we give a short review on a simulation approach\nthat uses the Jones matrix calculus to model the birefringent myelin sheaths.\nAfterwards, we introduce a more sophisticated simulation tool: a 3D Maxwell\nsolver based on a Finite-Difference Time-Domain algorithm that simulates the\npropagation of the electromagnetic light wave through the brain tissue. We\ndemonstrate that the Maxwell solver is a valuable tool to better understand the\ninteraction of polarized light with brain tissue and to enhance the accuracy of\nthe fiber orientations extracted by 3D-PLI.\n", "  The evolution of unidirectional nonlinear sea surface waves is calculated\nnumerically by means of solutions of the Euler equations. The wave dynamics\ncorresponds to quasi-equilibrium states characterized by JONSWAP spectra. The\nspatio-temporal data are collected and processed providing information about\nthe wave height probability and typical appearance of abnormally high waves\n(rogue waves). The waves are considered at different water depths ranging from\ndeep to relatively shallow cases ($k_p h > 0.8$, where $k_p$ is the peak\nwavenumber, and $h$ is the local depth). The asymmetry between front and rear\nrogue wave slopes is identified; it becomes apparent for sufficiently high\nwaves in rough sea states at all considered depths. The lifetimes of rogue\nevents may reach up to 30-60 wave periods depending on the water depth. The\nmaximum observed wave has height of about 3 significant wave heights. A few\nrandomly chosen in-situ time series from the Baltic Sea are in agreement with\nthe general picture of the numerical simulations.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of longitudinal spin Seebeck effect in\na multiferroic helimagnet Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe12O22. Temperature gradient applied\nnormal to Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe12O22/Pt interface generates inverse spin Hall voltage\nof spin current origin in Pt, whose magnitude was found to be proportional to\nbulk magnetization of Ba0.5Sr1.5Zn2Fe12O22 even through the successive magnetic\ntransitions among various helimagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases. This finding\ndemonstrates that the helimagnetic spin wave can be an effective carrier of\nspin current. By controlling the population ratio of spin-helicity domains\ncharacterized by clockwise/counter-clockwise manner of spin rotation with use\nof poling electric field in the ferroelectric helimagnetic phase, we found that\nspin-helicity domain distribution does not affect the magnitude of spin current\ninjected into Pt. The results suggest that the spin-wave spin current is rather\nrobust against the spin-helicity domain wall, unlike the case with the\nconventional ferromagnetic domain wall.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the solution of generalized distributed order\ndiffusion equations with composite time fractional derivative by using the\nFourier-Laplace transform method. We represent solutions in terms of infinite\nseries in Fox $H$-functions. The fractional and second moments are derived by\nusing Mittag-Leffler functions. We observe decelerating anomalous subdiffusion\nin case of two composite time fractional derivatives. Generalized uniformly\ndistributed order diffusion equation, as a model for strong anomalous behavior,\nis analyzed by using Tauberian theorem. Some previously obtained results are\nspecial cases of those presented in this paper.\n", "  Terahertz properties of mercury telluride (HgTe) films with critical\nthickness are presented and discussed. The density of the charge carriers is\ncontrolled using contact-free optical doping by visible light. In the\nmagneto-optical response of HgTe the contribution of two types of carriers\n(electrons and holes) can be identified. The density of the electrons can be\nmodified by light illumination by more than one order of magnitude. As the hole\ndensity is roughly illuminationindependent, the terahertz response of the\nilluminated samples becomes purely electronic. In some cases, light\nillumination may switch the qualitative electrodynamic response from hole-like\nto the electron-like. The cyclotron mass of the electrons could be extracted\nfrom the data and shows a square root dependence upon the charge concentration\nin the broad range of parameters. This can be interpreted as a clear proof of a\nlinear dispersion relations, i.e. Dirac-type charge carriers.\n", "  An analytic quasi-periodic cocycle is a linear cocycle over a fixed ergodic\ntorus translation of one or several variables, where the fiber action depends\nanalytically on the base point. Consider the space of all such cocycles of any\ngiven dimension and endow it with the uniform norm. Assume that the translation\nvector satisfies a generic Diophantine condition. We prove large deviation type\nestimates for the iterates of such cocycles, which, moreover, are stable under\nsmall perturbations of the cocycle. As a consequence of these uniform\nestimates, we establish continuity properties of the Lyapunov exponents\nregarded as functions on this space of cocycles. This result builds upon our\nprevious work on this topic and its proof uses an abstract continuity theorem\nof the Lyapunov exponents which we derived in a recent monograph. The new\nfeature of this paper is extending the availability of such results to cocycles\nthat are identically singular (i.e. non-invertible anywhere), in the several\nvariables torus translation setting. This feature is exactly what allows us,\nthrough a simple limiting argument, to obtain criteria for the positivity and\nsimplicity of the Lyapunov exponents of such cocycles. Specializing to the\nfamily of cocycles corresponding to a block Jacobi operator, we derive\nconsequences on the continuity, positivity and simplicity of its Lyapunov\nexponents, and on the continuity of its integrated density of states.\n", "  Light scattering by a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab (PCS) can result\nin dramatic interference effects associated with Fano resonances. Such devices\noffer appealing alternatives to distributed Bragg reflectors or filters for\nvarious applications such as optical wavelength and polarization filters,\nreflectors, semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, bio-sensors, or non-linear\noptical components. Suspended PCSs also find natural applications in the field\nof optomechanics, where the mechanical modes of a suspended slab interact via\nradiation pressure with the optical field of a high finesse cavity. The\nreflectivity and transmission properties of a defect-free suspended PCS around\nnormal incidence can be used to couple out-of-plane mechanical modes to an\noptical field by integrating it in a free space cavity. Here, we demonstrate\nthe successful implementation of a PCS reflector on a high-tensile stress\nSi$_3$N$_4$ nanomembrane. We illustrate the physical process underlying the\nhigh reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we\nintroduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties\nin the presence of optical losses. By embedding the PCS inside a high-finesse\ncavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally, angular,\nand polarization resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the\nmembrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.9470~$\\pm$ 0.0025 \\%, and show\nthat material absorption is not the main source of optical loss. Moreover, the\ncavity storage time demonstrated in this work exceeds the mechanical period of\nlow-order mechanical drum modes. This so-called resolved sideband condition is\na prerequisite to achieve quantum control of the mechanical resonator with\nlight.\n", "  The geodesic structure of the Teo wormhole is briefly discussed and some\nobservables are derived that promise to be of use in detecting a rotating\ntraversable wormhole indirectly, if it does exist. We also deduce the exact\nLense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a\nrotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency\nof the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to\nthe throat, during its travel to the wormhole. Furthermore, it is evident from\nour formulation that this spin precession not only arises due to curvature or\nrotation of the spacetime but also due to the non-zero angular velocity of the\nspin when it does not move along a geodesic in the strong gravity regime. If in\nthe future, interstellar travel indeed becomes possible through a wormhole or\nat least in its vicinity, our results would prove useful in determining the\nbehavior of a test gyroscope which is known to serve as a fundamental\nnavigation device.\n", "  We prove that, generically, magnetic geodesics on surfaces will turn away\nfrom points with lightlike tangent planes, and we motivate our result with\nnumerical solutions for closed magnetic geodesics.\n", "  We prove several trace inequalities that extend the Golden-Thompson and the\nAraki-Lieb-Thirring inequality to arbitrarily many matrices. In particular, we\nstrengthen Lieb's triple matrix inequality. As an example application of our\nfour matrix extension of the Golden-Thompson inequality, we prove remainder\nterms for the monotonicity of the quantum relative entropy and strong\nsub-additivity of the von Neumann entropy in terms of recoverability. We find\nthe first explicit remainder terms that are tight in the commutative case. Our\nproofs rely on complex interpolation theory as well as asymptotic spectral\npinching, providing a transparent approach to treat generic multivariate trace\ninequalities.\n", "  A major challenge in optical quantum processing is implementing large, stable\ninterferometers. Here we propose a virtual, measurement-based interferometer\nthat is programmed on the fly solely by the choice of homodyne measurement\nangles. The effects of finite squeezing are captured as uniform amplitude\ndamping. We compare our proposal to existing (physical) interferometers and\nconsider its performance for BosonSampling, which could demonstrate\npost-classical computational power in the near future. We prove its efficiency\nin time and squeezing (energy) in this setting.\n", "  In this work, we explore the cosmological consequences of the \"Joint\nLight-curve Analysis\" (JLA) supernova (SN) data by using an improved\nflux-averaging (FA) technique, in which only the type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at\nhigh redshift are flux-averaged. Adopting the criterion of figure of Merit\n(FoM) and considering six dark energy (DE) parameterizations, we search the\nbest FA recipe that gives the tightest DE constraints in the $(z_{cut}, \\Delta\nz)$ plane, where $z_{cut}$ and $\\Delta z$ are redshift cut-off and redshift\ninterval of FA, respectively. Then, based on the best FA recipe obtained, we\ndiscuss the impacts of varying $z_{cut}$ and varying $\\Delta z$, revisit the\nevolution of SN color luminosity parameter $\\beta$, and study the effects of\nadopting different FA recipe on parameter estimation. We find that: (1) The\nbest FA recipe is $(z_{cut} = 0.6, \\Delta z=0.06)$, which is insensitive to a\nspecific DE parameterization. (2) Flux-averaging JLA samples at $z_{cut} \\geq\n0.4$ will yield tighter DE constraints than the case without using FA. (3)\nUsing FA can significantly reduce the redshift-evolution of $\\beta$. (4) The\nbest FA recipe favors a larger fractional matter density $\\Omega_{m}$. In\nsummary, we present an alternative method of dealing with JLA data, which can\nreduce the systematic uncertainties of SNe Ia and give the tighter DE\nconstraints at the same time. Our method will be useful in the use of SNe Ia\ndata for precision cosmology.\n", "  We develop a device-independent framework for testing quantum channels. That\nis, we falsify a hypothesis about a quantum channel based only on an observed\nset of input-output correlations. Formally, the problem consists of\ncharacterizing the set of input-output correlations compatible with any\narbitrary given quantum channel. For binary (i.e., two input symbols, two\noutput symbols) correlations, we show that extremal correlations are always\nachieved by orthogonal encodings and measurements, irrespective of whether or\nnot the channel preserves commutativity. We further provide a full, closed-form\ncharacterization of the sets of binary correlations in the case of: i) any\ndihedrally-covariant qubit channel (such as any Pauli and amplitude-damping\nchannels), and ii) any universally-covariant commutativity-preserving channel\nin an arbitrary dimension (such as any erasure, depolarizing, universal\ncloning, and universal transposition channels).\n", "  We investigate the newly observed $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ based on the\ndiquark-antidiquark configuration within the framework of QCD sum rules. Both\nof them may be interpreted as the $D$-wave $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ tetraquark states\nof $J^P = 0^+$, but with opposite color structures, which is remarkably similar\nto the result obtained in Ref.~\\cite{Chen:2010ze} that the $X(4140)$ and\n$X(4274)$ can be both interpreted as the $S$-wave $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ tetraquark\nstates of $J^P = 1^+$, also with opposite color structures. However, the\nextracted masses and these suggested assignments to these $X$ states do depend\non these running quark masses where $m_s (2 \\mbox{ GeV}) = 95 \\pm 5$ MeV and\n$m_c (m_c) = 1.23 \\pm 0.09$ GeV. As a byproduct, the masses of the\nhidden-bottom partner states of the $X(4500)$ and $X(4700)$ are extracted to be\nboth around 10.64 GeV, which can be searched for in the $\\Upsilon \\phi$\ninvariant mass distribution.\n", "  The physics and demographics of type 2 quasars remain poorly understood, and\nnew samples of such objects selected in a variety of ways can give insight into\ntheir physical properties, evolution, and relationship to their host galaxies.\nWe present a sample of 2758 type 2 quasars at z $\\leq$ 1 from the SDSS-III/BOSS\nspectroscopic database, selected on the basis of their emission-line\nproperties. We probe the luminous end of the population by requiring the\nrest-frame equivalent width of [OIII] to be > 100 {\\AA}. We distinguish our\nobjects from star-forming galaxies and type 1 quasars using line widths,\nstandard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams at z < 0.52 and detection of\n[Ne V]{\\lambda}3426{\\AA} at z > 0.52. The majority of our objects have [OIII]\nluminosities in the range 10^8.5-10^10 L$_{\\odot}$ and redshifts between 0.4\nand 0.65. Our sample includes over 400 type 2 quasars with incorrectly measured\nredshifts in the BOSS database; such objects often show kinematic substructure\nor outflows in the [OIII] line. The majority of the sample has counterparts in\nthe WISE survey, with median infrared luminosity {\\nu}L{\\nu}[12{\\mu}m] = 4.2 x\n10^44 erg/sec. Only 34 per cent of the newly identified type 2 quasars would be\nselected by infrared color cuts designed to identify obscured active nuclei,\nhighlighting the difficulty of identifying complete samples of type 2 quasars.\nWe make public the multi-Gaussian decompositions of all [OIII] profiles for the\nnew sample and for 568 type 2 quasars from SDSS I/II, together with\nnon-parametric measures of line profile shapes and identify over 600 candidate\ndouble-peaked [OIII] profiles.\n", "  We consider the application of relative self-calibration using overlap\nregions to spectroscopic galaxy surveys that use slit-less spectroscopy. This\nmethod is based on that developed for the SDSS by Padmanabhan at al. (2008) in\nthat we consider jointly fitting and marginalising over calibrator brightness,\nrather than treating these as free parameters. However, we separate the\ncalibration of the detector-to-detector from the full-focal-plane\nexposure-to-exposure calibration. To demonstrate how the calibration procedure\nwill work, we simulate the procedure for a potential implementation of the\nspectroscopic component of the wide Euclid survey. We study the change of\ncoverage and the determination of relative multiplicative errors in flux\nmeasurements for different dithering configurations. We use the new method to\nstudy the case where the flat-field across each exposure or detector is\nmeasured precisely and only exposure-to-exposure or detector-to-detector\nvariation in the flux error remains. We consider several base dither patterns\nand find that they strongly influence the ability to calibrate, using this\nmethodology. To enable self-calibration, it is important that the survey\nstrategy connects different observations with at least a minimum amount of\noverlap, and we propose an \"S\"-pattern for dithering that fulfills this\nrequirement. The final survey strategy adopted by Euclid will have to optimise\nfor a number of different science goals and requirements. The large-scale\ncalibration of the spectroscopic galaxy survey is clearly cosmologically\ncrucial, but is not the only one.\n", "  We study the propagation of bubbles of new vacuum in a radially inhomogeneous\nbackground filled with dust or radiation, and including a cosmological\nconstant, as a first step in the analysis of the influence of inhomogeneities\nin the evolution of an inflating region. We also compare the cases with dust\nand radiation backgrounds and show that the evolution of the bubble in\nradiation environments is notably different from that in the corresponding dust\ncases, both for homogeneous and inhomogeneous ambients, leading to appreciable\ndifferences in the evolution of the proper radius of the bubble.\n", "  We present theoretical model comparison with published ALICE results for\nD-mesons (D$^0$, D$^+$ and D$^{*+}$) in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7\nTeV and $p$+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. Event generator\nHIJING, transport calculation of AMPT and calculations from NLO(MNR) and FONLL\nhave been used for this study. We found that HIJING and AMPT model predictions\nare matching with published D-meson cross-sections in $p$+$p$ collisions, while\nboth under-predict the same in $p$+Pb collisions. Attempts were made to explain\nthe $R_{pPb}$ data using NLO-pQCD(MNR), FONLL and other above mentioned models.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs particle at 125 GeV has put strong constraints on\nminimal messenger models of gauge mediation, pushing the stop masses into the\nmulti-TeV regime. Extensions of these models with matter-messenger mixing terms\nhave been proposed to generate a large trilinear parameter, $A_t$, relaxing\nthese constraints. The detailed survey of these models\n\\cite{Byakti:2013ti,Evans:2013kxa} so far considered messenger mixings with\nonly MSSM superfields. In the present work, we extend the survey to MSSM with\ninverse-seesaw mechanism. The neutrino-sneutrino corrections to the Higgs mass\nin the inverse seesaw model are not significant in the minimal gauge mediation\nmodel, unless one considers messenger-matter interaction terms. We classify all\npossible models with messenger-matter interactions and perform thorough\nnumerical analysis to find out the promising models. We found that out of the\n17 possible models 9 of them can lead to Higgs mass within the observed value\nwithout raising the sfermion masses significantly. The successful models have\nstop masses $\\sim $1.5 TeV with small or negligible mixing and yet a light CP\neven Higgs at 125 GeV.\n", "  Massive particles with self interactions of the order of 0.2 barn/GeV are\nintriguing Dark Matter candidates from an astrophysical point of view. Current\nand past experiments for direct detection of massive Dark Matter particles are\nfocusing to relatively low cross sections with ordinary matter, however they\ncannot rule out very large cross sections, $\\sigma/M > 0.01$ barn/GeV, due to\natmosphere and material shielding. Cosmology places a strong indirect limit for\nthe presence of large interactions among Dark Matter and baryons in the\nUniverse, however such a limit cannot rule out the existence of a small\nsub-dominant component of Dark Matter with non negligible interactions with\nordinary matter in our galactic halo. Here, the possibility of the existence of\nbound states with ordinary matter, for a similar Dark Matter candidate with not\nnegligible interactions, is considered. The existence of bound states, with\nbinding energy larger than $\\sim$1 meV, would offer the possibility to test in\nlaboratory capture cross sections of the order of a barn (or larger). The\nsignature of the detection for a mass increasing of cryogenic samples, due to\nthe possible particle accumulation, would allow the investigation of these Dark\nMatter candidates with mass up to the GUT scale. A proof of concept for a\npossible detection set-up and the evaluation of some noise sources are\ndescribed.\n", "  A method for online decorrelation of chemical sensor signals from the effects\nof environmental humidity and temperature variations is proposed. The goal is\nto improve the accuracy of electronic nose measurements for continuous\nmonitoring by processing data from simultaneous readings of environmental\nhumidity and temperature. The electronic nose setup built for this study\nincluded eight metal-oxide sensors, temperature and humidity sensors with a\nwireless communication link to external computer. This wireless electronic nose\nwas used to monitor air for two years in the residence of one of the authors\nand it collected data continuously during 537 days with a sampling rate of 1\nsamples per second. To estimate the effects of variations in air humidity and\ntemperature on the chemical sensors signals, we used a standard energy band\nmodel for an n-type metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensor. The main assumption of the\nmodel is that variations in sensor conductivity can be expressed as a nonlinear\nfunction of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of\nexternal humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the\ncollected data, we confirmed that the most statistically significant factors\nare humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This\nsimple model achieves excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination\n$R^2$ close to 1. To show how the humidity-temperature correction model works\nfor gas discrimination, we constructed a model for online discrimination among\nbanana, wine and baseline response. This shows that pattern recognition\nalgorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal\nof the chemical sensors.\n", "  A solidification model based on the principle of maximum entropy production\nrate (MEPR) is considered for the study of pure metals. The approach leads to\nthe development of a breakdown criterion which is able to account for the\nsolidification velocity and solid-liquid interface (SLI) thickness. The\nquantitative knowledge of the SLI thickness and the maximum entropy generation\nrate density obtained at breakdown gives an insight about the structure of the\nSLI during solid to liquid phase transformation. The formation of facet and\nnon-facet morphology, and their transitions are accounted for, which is a\nfunction of solidification velocity, heat of fusion, density and the\ncrystallographic growth plane.\n", "  We analyze laser-induced ultrafast, spatially inhomogeneous magnetization\ndynamics of epitaxial Co/Cu(001) films in a 0.4-10 nm thickness range with\ntime-resolved magnetization-induced second harmonic generation, which probes\nfemtosecond spin dynamics at the vacuum/Co and Co/Cu interfaces. The\ninterference of these two contributions makes the overall signal particularly\nsensitive to differences in the transient magnetization redistribution between\nthe two interfaces, i.e. ultrafast magnetization profiles in the ferromagnetic\nfilm. We find in films of up to 3 nm thickness a stronger demagnetization at\nthe surface, because the film thickness is smaller than the effective mean free\npath of the spin current mediating the demagnetization, i.e. the difference\nbetween the mean free paths of the majority and minority carriers. For film\nthicknesses larger than 3 nm, the magnetization profile reverses, since\nmajority spins can escape into the conducting substrate only from the\ninterface-near region.\n", "  We study a nanofabricated silicon rod levitated in an optical trap. By\nmanipulating the polarization of the light we gain full control over the\nro-translational dynamics of the rod. We are able to trap both its\ncentre-of-mass and align it along the linear polarization of the laser field.\nThe rod can be set into rotation at a tuned frequency by exploiting the\nradiation pressure exerted by elliptically polarized light. The rotational\nmotion of the rod dynamically modifies the optical potential, which allows\ntuning of the rotational frequency over hundreds of Kilohertz. This ability to\ntrap and control the motion and alignment of nanoparticles opens up the field\nof rotational optomechanics, rotational ground state cooling and the study of\nrotational thermodynamics in the underdamped regime.\n", "  We compute the exact solutions of the radiative transfer equation in two\ndimensions for isotropic scattering. The intensity and the radiance are given\nin the space-time domain for isotropic and unidirectional sources. These\nanalytical results are compared to Monte-Carlo simulations in four particular\nsituations.\n", "  To provide constraints on their inversion, ocean sound speed profiles (SSPs)\noften are modeled using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). However, this\nregularization, which uses the leading order EOFs with a minimum-energy\nconstraint on their coefficients, often yields low resolution SSP estimates. In\nthis paper, it is shown that dictionary learning, a form of unsupervised\nmachine learning, can improve SSP resolution by generating a dictionary of\nshape functions for sparse processing (e.g. compressive sensing) that optimally\ncompress SSPs; both minimizing the reconstruction error and the number of\ncoefficients. These learned dictionaries (LDs) are not constrained to be\northogonal and thus, fit the given signals such that each signal example is\napproximated using few LD entries. Here, LDs describing SSP observations from\nthe HF-97 experiment and the South China Sea are generated using the K-SVD\nalgorithm. These LDs better explain SSP variability and require fewer\ncoefficients than EOFs, describing much of the variability with one\ncoefficient. Thus, LDs improve the resolution of SSP estimates with negligible\ncomputational burden.\n", "  A search is presented for anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings in\nvector-boson scattering. The data for the analysis correspond to $20.2$\nfb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV $pp$ collisions, and were collected in 2012 by\nthe ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The search looks for the\nproduction of $WW$ or $WZ$ boson pairs accompanied by a high-mass dijet system,\nwith one $W$ decaying leptonically, and a $W$ or $Z$ decaying hadronically. The\nhadronically decaying $W/Z$ is reconstructed as either two small-radius jets or\none large-radius jet using jet substructure techniques. Constraints on the\nanomalous quartic gauge boson coupling parameters $\\alpha_4$ and $\\alpha_5$ are\nset by fitting the transverse mass of the diboson system, and the resulting 95%\nconfidence intervals are $-0.024<\\alpha_4<0.030$ and $-0.028<\\alpha_5<0.033$.\n", "  We investigate a potential of measuring properties of a heavy resonance X,\nexploiting jet substructure techniques. Motivated by heavy higgs boson\nsearches, we focus on the decays of X into a pair of (massive) electroweak\ngauge bosons. More specifically, we consider a hadronic Z boson, which makes it\npossible to determine properties of X at an earlier stage. For $m_X$ of O(1)\nTeV, two quarks from a Z boson would be captured as a \"merged jet\" in a\nsignificant fraction of events. The use of the merged jet enables us to\nconsider a Z-induced jet as a reconstructed object without any combinatorial\nambiguity. We apply a conventional jet substructure method to extract\nfour-momenta of subjets from a merged jet. We find that jet substructure\nprocedures may enhance features in some kinematic observables formed with\nsubjets. Subjet momenta are fed into the matrix element associated with a given\nhypothesis on the nature of X, which is further processed to construct a matrix\nelement method (MEM)-based observable. For both moderately and highly boosted Z\nbosons, we demonstrate that the MEM with current jet substructure techniques\ncan be a very powerful discriminator in identifying the physics nature of X. We\nalso discuss effects from choosing different jet sizes for merged jets and\njet-grooming parameters upon the MEM analyses.\n", "  We perform calculations for the $\\eta_c \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decay using\nelements of SU(3) symmetry to see the weight of different trios of\npseudoscalars produced in this decay, prior to the final state interaction of\nthe mesons. After that, the interaction of pairs of mesons, leading finally to\n$\\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, is done using the chiral unitary approach. We evaluate the\n$\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and $\\pi \\eta$ mass distributions and find large and clear\nsignals for $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ excitation. The reaction is\nsimilar to the $\\chi_{c1} \\to \\eta \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, which has been recently\nmeasured at BESIII and its implementation and comparison with these predictions\nwill be very valuable to shed light on the nature of the low mass scalar\nmesons.\n", "  Our analysis based on analytical and numerical calculations leads to\nconclusion that the promising results obtained in [F. Bouchard, J. Harris, H.\nMand, R. W. Boyd, and E. Karimi, Optica 3, 351, 2016] are questionable in\nseveral respects.\n", "  We derive compact expressions for the helicity amplitudes of the many-body $B\n\\to D^{(*)}(\\to DY)\\tau(\\to X\\nu)\\nu$ decays, specifically for $X = \\ell \\nu$\nor $\\pi$ and $Y = \\pi$ or $\\gamma$. We include contributions from all ten\npossible new physics four-Fermi operators with arbitrary couplings. Our results\ncapture interference effects in the full phase space of the visible $\\tau$ and\n$D^*$ decay products which are missed in analyses that treat the $\\tau$ or\n$D^*$ or both as stable. The $\\tau$ interference effects are sizable, formally\nof order $m_\\tau/m_B$ for the standard model, and may be of order unity in the\npresence of new physics. Treating interference correctly is essential when\nconsidering kinematic distributions of the $\\tau$ or $D^*$ decay products, and\nwhen including experimentally unavoidable phase space cuts. Our amplitude-level\nresults also allow for efficient exploration of new physics effects in the\nfully differential phase space, by enabling experiments to perform such studies\non fully simulated Monte Carlo datasets via efficient event reweighing. As an\nexample, we explore a class of new physics interactions that can fit the\nobserved $R(D^{(*)})$ ratios, and show that analyses including more\ndifferential kinematic information can provide greater discriminating power for\nnew physics, than single kinematic variables alone.\n", "  We investigate the description of the pion-nucleon experimental data at low\nenergy (i.e., below pion laboratory kinetic energy of $100$ MeV) on the basis\nof the current SAID solution (WI08). We demonstrate that, in a self-consistent\nanalysis scheme, the scale factors of the fits based on the Arndt-Roper formula\ncome out independent of the beam energy and `cluster' around the expectation\nvalue of $1$. We report systematic effects in the low-energy behavior of the\nWI08 solution. These effects indicate that at least one of the three following\nassumptions, underlying the WI08 analysis, does \\emph{not} hold, namely that:\na) the bulk of the data is reliable, b) the electromagnetic effects are\ncorrectly accounted for, and c) the isospin invariance in the strong\ninteractions of the $\\pi N$ system is valid.\n", "  We use a semiclassical large-$S$ expansion to study a plateau at $1/3$\nsaturation in the magnetization curve of a frustrated ferrimagnet on a\nspatially anisotropic kagom\\'{e} lattice. The spins have both ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings, and a frustrating\nnext-nearest-neighbor coupling in one lattice direction. The magnetization\nplateau appears at the classical level for a certain range of couplings, and\nquantum fluctuations significantly broaden it at both ends. Near the region of\nthe phase diagram where the classical plateau destabilizes, we find an exotic\n\"chiral liquid\" phase that preserves translational and $U(1)$ spin symmetry, in\nwhich bound pairs of magnons with opposite spins are condensed. We show how\nthis state is obtained naturally from a relativistic field theory formulation.\nWe comment on the relevance of the model to the material\n$\\text{Cu}_3\\text{V}_2\\text{O}_7\\text{(OH)}_2 \\cdot 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n(volborthite).\n", "  Armchair nanotubes of MoS2 and WS2 offer a sizeable band gap, with the\nadvantage of a one dimensional (1D) electronic material, but free from edge\nroughness and thermodynamic instability of nanoribbons. Use of such\nsemiconducting MX2 (MoS2, WS2) armchair nanotubes (NTs) in conjunction with\nmetallic carbon nanotubes (CNT) could prove useful for nanoelectronics and\nphotonics applications. In this work atomistic simulations of MoS2 NT-CNT and\nWS2 NT-CNT junctions are carried out to study the physics of such junctions.\nWith density functional theory (DFT) we study the carrier density distribution,\neffective potential, electron difference density, electron localization\nfunction, electrostatic difference potential and projected local density of\nstates of such MX2 NT-CNT 1D junctions. Thereafter the conductance of such a\njunction under moderate bias is studied with non-equilibrium Greens function\n(NEGF) method. From the forward bias characteristics simulated from NEGF, we\nextract diode parameters of the junction. The electrostatic simulations from\nDFT show the formation of an inhomogeneous Schottky barrier with a tendency\ntowards charge transfer from metal and chalcogen atoms towards the C atoms. For\nlow bias conditions, the ideality factor was calculated to be 1.1322 for MoS2\nNT-CNT junction and 1.2526 for the WS2 NT-CNT junction. The Schottky barrier\nheights displayed significant bias dependent modulation and are calculated to\nbe in the range 0.697 - 0.664eV for MoS2 NT-CNT and 0.669-0.610 eV for the WS2\nNT-CNT respectively.\n", "  Inspired by naturally occurring sulfide minerals, we present a new family of\niron-based superconductors. A metastable form of FeS known as the mineral\nmackinawite forms two-dimensional sheets that can be readily intercalated by\nvarious cationic guest species. Under hydrothermal conditions using alkali\nmetal hydroxides, we prepare three different cation and metal\nhydroxide-intercalated FeS phases including (Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$OH)FeS,\n[(Na$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)(OH)$_2$]FeS, and K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$S$_2$. Upon successful\nintercalation of the FeS layer, the superconducting critical temperature $T_c$\nof mackinawite is enhanced from 5 K to 8 K for the\n(Li$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$OH)$^{\\delta+}$ intercalate. Layered heterostructures of\n[(Na$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)(OH)$_2$]FeS resemble the natural mineral tochilinite, which\ncontains an iron square lattice interleaved with a hexagonal hydroxide lattice.\nWhilst heterostructured [(Na$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$)(OH)$_2$]FeS displays long-range\nmagnetic ordering near 15 K, K$_x$Fe$_{2-y}$S$_2$ displays short range\nantiferromagnetism.\n", "  This article contains a survey of the geometric approach to quantum\ncorrelations. We focus mainly on the geometric measures of quantum correlations\nbased on the Bures and quantum Hellinger distances.\n", "  There are important differences between the nonrelativistic and relativistic\ndescription of electron beams. The orbital angular momentum quantum number\ncannot be used to specify the wave functions in the relativistic case. In this\nLetter we introduce analytic solutions of the Dirac equation in the form of\nexponential wave packets and we argue that they properly describe relativistic\nelectron beams carrying angular momentum.\n", "  We describe a method for transferring ultra large-scale CVD-grown graphene\nsheets. These samples can be fabricated as large as several cm$^2$ and are\ncharacterized by magneto-transport measurements on SiO$_2$ substrates. The\nprocess we have developed is highly effective and limits damage to the graphene\nall the way through metal liftoff, as shown in carrier mobility measurements\nand the observation of the quantum Hall effect. The charge-neutral point is\nshown to move drastically to near-zero gate voltage after a 2-step\npost-fabrication annealing process, which also allows for greatly diminished\nhysteresis.\n", "  We use two model-independent methods to constrain the curvature of the\nuniverse. In the first method, we study the evolution of the curvature\nparameter ($\\Omega_k^0$) with redshift by using the observations of the Hubble\nparameter and transverse comoving distances obtained from the age of galaxies.\nSecondly, we also use an indirect method based on the mean image separation\nstatistics of gravitationally lensed quasars. The basis of this methodology is\nthat the average image separation of lensed images will show a positive,\nnegative or zero correlation with the source redshift in a closed, open or flat\nuniverse respectively. In order to smoothen the datasets used in both the\nmethods, we use a non-parametric method namely, Gaussian Process (GP). Finally\nfrom first method we obtain $\\Omega_k^0= 0.025\\pm0.57$ for a presumed flat\nuniverse while the cosmic curvature remains constant throughout the redshift\nregion $0<z<1.37$ which indicates that the universe may be homogeneous.\nMoreover, the combined result from both the methods suggests that the universe\nis marginally closed. However, a flat universe can be incorporated at $3\\sigma$\nlevel.\n", "  We analyze large deviations of the time-averaged activity in the one\ndimensional Fredrickson-Andersen model, both numerically and analytically. The\nmodel exhibits a dynamical phase transition, which appears as a singularity in\nthe large deviation function. We analyze the finite-size scaling of this phase\ntransition numerically, by generalizing an existing cloning algorithm to\ninclude a multi-canonical feedback control: this significantly improves the\ncomputational efficiency. Motivated by these numerical results, we formulate an\neffective theory for the model in the vicinity of the phase transition, which\naccounts quantitatively for the observed behavior. We discuss potential\napplications of the numerical method and the effective theory in a range of\nmore general contexts.\n", "  The present study is devoted for an improved analysis of the\nself-interference contribution of the electromagnetic dipole operator O_7 to\nthe double differential decay width $d\\Gamma/(ds_1 ds_2)$ for the inclusive\n$\\bar{B} \\to X_s \\gamma \\gamma$ process, where the kinematical variables s_1\nand s_2 are defined as s_i=(p_b - q_i)^2/m_b^2 with p_b, q_1, q_2 being the\nmomenta of the b-quark and two photons. This calculation completes the NLL QCD\nprediction of the numerically important self-interference contribution of O_7\nby keeping the full dependence on the strange-quark mass m_s, which is\nintroduced to control possible collinear configurations of one of the photons\nwith the strange quark. Our results are given for exact m_s, in contrast to an\nearlier work where only logarithmic and constant terms in m_s were retained.\nThis improved NLL result for the (O_7, O_7)-interference contribution shows\nthat finite m_s effects are only sizable near the kinematical endpoints of the\nspectrum $d\\Gamma/(ds_1 ds_2)$. At the level of the branching ratio, in the\nphase-space region considered in this paper, it is observed that $Br[\\bar{B}\n\\to X_s \\gamma \\gamma]$ does not develop a sizable m_s dependence: the impact\non this branching ratio is less than 5% when m_s is varied between 400-600 MeV.\nFor the same phase-space region finite strange quark mass effects for the\nbranching ratio are less than 7%.\n", "  The spin-galvanic (inverse Edelstein) and inverse spin-Hall effects are\ncalculated for a hybrid system that combines thin superconductor and\nRashba-metal layers. These effects are produced by a nonequilibrium spin\npolarization which is injected into the normal metal layer. This polarization\ngives rise to an electric potential that relaxes within some characteristic\nlength, which is determined by Andreev reflection. Within this length the\ndissipative electric current of quasiparticles in the normal layer converts\ninto the supercurrent. This process involves only subgap states and at low\ntemperature the inelastic electron-phonon interactions are not important. It is\ndiscussed how such a hybrid system can be integrated into a SQUID where it\nproduces an effect similar to a magnetic flux.\n", "  The study of quantum correlations in solid state systems is a large avenue\nfor research and their detection and manipulation are an actual challenge to\novercome. In this context, we show by using first-principles calculations on\nthe prototype material KNaCuSi$_{4}$O$_{10}$ that the degree of quantum\ncorrelations in this spin cluster system can be managed by external hydrostatic\npressure. Our results open the doors for research in detection and manipulation\nof quantum correlations in magnetic systems with promising applications in\nquantum information science.\n", "  We give an intuitive geometric explanation for the apparent breakdown of\nstandard finite-size scaling in systems with periodic boundaries above the\nupper critical dimension. The Ising model and self-avoiding walk are simulated\non five-dimensional hypercubic lattices with free and periodic boundary\nconditions, by using geometric representations and recently introduced\nMarkov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that previously observed anomalous\nbehaviour for correlation functions, measured on the standard Euclidean scale,\ncan be removed by defining correlation functions on a scale which correctly\naccounts for windings.\n", "  We extend the matter bounce scenario to a more general theory in which the\nbackground dynamics and cosmological perturbations are generated by a\n$k$-essence scalar field with an arbitrary sound speed. When the sound speed is\nsmall, the curvature perturbation is enhanced, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nwhich is excessively large in the original model, can be sufficiently\nsuppressed to be consistent with observational bounds. Then, we study the\nprimordial three-point correlation function generated during the\nmatter-dominated contraction stage and find that it only depends on the sound\nspeed parameter. Similar to the canonical case, the shape of the bispectrum is\nmainly dominated by a local form, though for some specific sound speed values a\nnew shape emerges and the scaling behaviour changes. Meanwhile, a small sound\nspeed also results in a large amplitude of non-Gaussianities, which is\ndisfavored by current observations. As a result, it does not seem possible to\nsuppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio without amplifying the production of\nnon-Gaussianities beyond current observational constraints (and vice versa).\nThis suggests an extension of the previously conjectured no-go theorem in\nsingle field nonsingular matter bounce cosmologies, which rules out a large\nclass of models. However, the non-Gaussianity results remain as a\ndistinguishable signature of matter bounce cosmology and have the potential to\nbe detected by observations in the near future.\n", "  We report the first measurement of size-resolved photoelectron angular\ndistributions for the valence orbitals of water clusters with up to 20\nmolecules. A systematic decrease of the photoelectron anisotropy is found for\nclusters with up to 5-6 molecules, and most remarkably, convergence of the\nanisotropy for larger clusters. We suggest the latter to be the result of a\nlocal short-range scattering potential that is fully described by a unit of 5-6\nmolecules. The cluster data and a detailed electron scattering model are used\nto predict liquid water anisotropies. Reasonable agreement with experimental\nliquid jet data is found.\n", "  We review charge transport across molecular monolayers, which is central to\nmolecular electronics (MoE) using large-area junctions (NmJ). We strive to\nprovide a wide conceptual overview of three main sub-topics. First, a broad\nintroduction places NmJ in perspective to related fields of research, and to\nsingle molecule junctions (1mJ), in addition to a brief historical account. As\ncharge transport presents an ultra sensitive probe for the electronic\nperfection of interfaces, in the second part ways to form both the monolayer\nand the contacts are described to construct reliable, defect-free interfaces.\nThe last part is dedicated to understanding and analyses of current-voltage\n(I-V) traces across molecular junctions. Notwithstanding the original\nmotivation of MoE, I-V traces are often not very sensitive to molecular details\nand then provide a poor probe for chemical information. Instead we focus on how\nto analyse the net electrical performance of molecular junctions, from a\nfunctional device perspective. Finally, we shortly point to creation of a\nbuilt-in electric field as a key to achieve functionality, including non-linear\ncurrent-voltage characteristics that originate in the molecules or their\ncontacts to the electrodes.\n", "  Inserting molecular monolayers within metal / semiconductor interfaces\nprovides one of the most powerful expressions of how minute chemical\nmodifications can affect electronic devices. This topic also has direct\nimportance for technology as it can help improve the efficiency of a variety of\nelectronic devices such as solar cells, LEDs, sensors and possible future\nbioelectronic devices, which are based mostly on non-classical semiconducting\nmaterials (section 1). The review covers the main aspects of using chemistry to\n- control alignment of energy levels at interfaces (section 2): - passivate\ninterface states (section 3), - insert molecular dipoles at interfaces (section\n4), - induce charge rearrangement at and around interfaces (section 5). After\nsetting the stage, we consider the unique current-voltage characteristics that\nresult from transport across metal / molecular monolayer / semiconductor\ninterfaces. Here we focus on the interplay between the monolayer as tunneling\nbarrier on the one hand, and the electrostatic barrier within the\nsemiconductor, due to its space-charge region (section 6), on the other hand,\nas well as how different monolayer chemistries control each of the these\nbarriers. Section 7 provides practical tools to experimentally identify these\ntwo barriers, and distinguish between them, after which section 8 concludes the\nstory with a summary and a view to the future. While this review is concerned\nwith hybrid semiconductor / molecular effects (see Refs. 1,2 for earlier\nreviews on this topic), issues related to formation of monolayers and contacts,\nas well as charge transport that is solely dominated by molecules, have been\nreviewed elsewhere[3-6], including by us recently[7].\n", "  We present a simple analytical theory of flexible polymer chain dissolved in\na good solvent, carrying permanent freely oriented dipoles on the monomers. We\ntake into account the dipole correlations within the random phase approximation\n(RPA), as well as a dielectric heterogeneity in the internal polymer volume\nrelative to the bulk solution. We demonstrate that the dipole correlations of\nmonomers can be taken into account as pairwise ones only when the polymer chain\nis in a coil conformation. In this case the dipole correlations manifest\nthemselves through the Keesom interactions of the permanent dipoles. On the\nother hand, the dielectric heterogeneity effect (dielectric mismatch effect)\nleads to effective interaction between the monomers of the polymeric coil. Both\nof these effects can be taken into account by the renormalizing the second\nvirial coefficient of the volume interactions monomer-monomer. We establish\nthat in the case when the solvent dielectric permittivity exceeds the\ndielectric permittivity of the polymeric material, the dielectric mismatch\neffect competes with the dipole attractive interactions, leading to polymer\ncoil expansion. In the opposite case, both the dielectric mismatch effect and\nthe dipole attractive interaction lead to the polymer coil collapse. We analyse\nthe coil-globule transition caused by the dipole correlations of monomers\nwithin the many-body theory. We demonstrate that accounting for the dipole\ncorrelations higher than pairwise ones smooths this pure electrostatics driven\ncoil-globule transition of the polymer chain.\n", "  The asymptotic form of the Bel-Robinson tensor in the gravitational\nradiation-zone is obtained in terms of the mass quadrupole of the source. A\ncomparison is made with the standard formula for the gravitational power\nemission. The problem of a fully covariant description of gravitational\nradiation in terms of this tensor is discussed with some detail.\n", "  Using the covariant phase space formalism, we compute the conserved charges\nfor a solution, describing an accelerating and electrically charged\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole. The metric is regular provided that the\nacceleration is driven by an external electric field, in spite of the usual\nstring of the standard C-metric. The Smarr formula and the first law of black\nhole thermodynamics are fulfilled. The resulting mass has the same form of the\nChristodoulou-Ruffini mass formula. On the basis of these results, we can\nextrapolate the mass and thermodynamics of the rotating C-metric, which\ndescribes a Kerr-Newman-(A)dS black hole accelerated by a pulling string.\n", "  We discuss the physical superstring correlation functions in type I theory\n(or equivalently type II with orientifold) that compute real topological string\namplitudes. We consider the correlator corresponding to holomorphic derivative\nof the real topological amplitude $G_\\chi$, at fixed worldsheet Euler\ncharacteristic $\\chi$. This corresponds in the low-energy effective action to\nN=2 Weyl multiplet, appropriately reduced to the orientifold invariant part,\nand raised to the power $g'=-\\chi+1$. We show that the physical string\ncorrelator gives precisely the holomorphic derivative of topological amplitude.\nFinally, we apply this method to the standard closed oriented case as well, and\nprove a similar statement for the topological amplitude $F_g$.\n", "  We use the LDA+U method to study the possibility of exciton condensation in\nperovskites of transition metals with $d^6$ electronic configuration such as\nLaCoO$_3$. For realistic interaction parameters we find several distinct\nsolutions exhibiting spin-triplet exciton condensate, which gives rise to a\nlocal spin density distribution while the ordered moments are vanishingly\nsmall. Rhombohedral distortion from the ideal cubic structure suppresses the\nordered state, contrary to the spin-orbit coupling which enhances the excitonic\ncondensation energy. We explain the trends observed in the numerical\nsimulations with the help of a simplified strong-coupling model. Our results\nindicate that LaCoO$_3$ is close to the excitonic instability and suggest ways\nto make it order.\n", "  The ideal strength is the maximum stress a material can withstand, and it is\nan important intrinsic property for structural applications. Griffith strength\nlimit ~E/9 is the best known upper bound of this property for a material loaded\nin tension. Here we report that stanene, a recently fabricated two-dimensional\nmaterial, could approach and possibly exceed this limit from a theoretical\nperspective. Utilizing first-principles density functional theory, we\ninvestigated the nonlinear elastic behavior of stanene and found that its\nstrength could reach ~E/7.4 under uniaxial tension in both armchair and zigzag\ndirections without incurring phonon instability or mechanical failure. The\nunique mechanical properties of stanene are further appreciated by comparisons\nwith two other Group-IV 2D materials, graphene and silicene.\n", "  The representation of the wave functions of the nucleon resonances within a\nrelativistic framework is a complex task. In a nonrelativistic framework the\northogonality between states can be imposed naturally. In a relativistic\ngeneralization, however, the derivation of the orthogonality condition between\nstates can be problematic, particularly when the states have different masses.\nIn this work we study the $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ states using a relativistic\nframework. We considered wave functions derived in previous works, but impose\nthe orthogonality between the nucleon and resonance states using the properties\nof the nucleon, ignoring the difference of masses between the states\n(semirelativistic approximation). The $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ wave functions\nare then defined without any adjustable parameters and are used to make\npredictions for the valence quark contributions to the transition form factors.\nThe predictions compare well with the data particularly for high momentum\ntransfer, where the dominance of the quark degrees of freedom is expected.\n", "  The Multi-Blade is a Boron-10-based gaseous detector introduced to face the\nchallenge arising in neutron reflectometry at pulsed neutron sources. Neutron\nreflectometers are the most challenging instruments in terms of instantaneous\ncounting rate and spatial resolution. This detector has been designed to cope\nwith the requirements set for the reflectometers at the upcoming European\nSpallation Source (ESS) in Sweden. Based on previous results obtained at the\nInstitut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in France, an improved demonstrator has been built\nat ESS and tested at the Budapest Neutron Centre (BNC) in Hungary and at the\nSource Testing Facility (STF) at the Lund University in Sweden. A detailed\ndescription of the detector and the results of the tests are discussed in this\nmanuscript.\n", "  The interpretive power of the newest generation of large-volume\nhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation rests upon their ability to\nreproduce the observed properties of galaxies. In this second paper in a\nseries, we employ bulge+disc decompositions of realistic dust-free galaxy\nimages from the Illustris simulation in a consistent comparison with galaxies\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Examining the size-luminosity\nrelations of each sample, we find that galaxies in Illustris are roughly twice\nas large and $0.7$ magnitudes brighter on average than galaxies in the SDSS.\nThe trend of increasing slope and decreasing normalization of size-luminosity\nas a function of bulge-fraction is qualitatively similar to observations.\nHowever, the size-luminosity relations of Illustris galaxies are quantitatively\ndistinguished by higher normalizations and smaller slopes than for real\ngalaxies. We show that this result is linked to a significant deficit of\nbulge-dominated galaxies in Illustris relative to the SDSS at stellar masses\n$\\log\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}\\lesssim11$. We investigate this\ndeficit by comparing bulge fraction estimates derived from photometry\n\\emph{and} internal kinematics. We show that photometric bulge fractions are\nsystematically lower than the kinematic fractions at low masses, but with\nincreasingly good agreement as the stellar mass increases.\n", "  Optimization of energy cost determines average values of spatio-temporal gait\nparameters such as step duration, step length or step speed. However, during\nwalking, humans need to adapt these parameters at every step to respond to\nexogenous and/or endogenic perturbations. While some neurological mechanisms\nthat trigger these responses are known, our understanding of the fundamental\nprinciples governing step-by-step adaptation remains elusive. We determined the\ngait parameters of 20 healthy subjects with right-foot preference during\ntreadmill walking at speeds of 1.1, 1.4 and 1.7 m/s. We found that when the\nvalue of the gait parameter was conspicuously greater (smaller) than the mean\nvalue, it was either followed immediately by a smaller (greater) value of the\ncontralateral leg (interleg control), or the deviation from the mean value\ndecreased during the next movement of ipsilateral leg (intraleg control). The\nselection of step duration and the selection of step length during such\ntransient control events were performed in unique ways. We quantified the\nsymmetry of short-term control of gait parameters and observed the significant\ndominance of the right leg in short-term control of all three parameters at\nhigher speeds (1.4 and 1.7 m/s).\n", "  We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the electronic state of the\nantiferromagnet UIrGe, which is isostructural and isoelectronic with the\nferromagnetic superconductors UCoGe and URhGe. The Neel temperature decreases\nwith increasing pressure. We constructed a p-T phase diagram and estimated the\ncritical pressure pc, where the antiferromagnetism vanishes, as 12 GPa. The\nantiferromagnetic/paramagnetic transition appears to be first order.\n", "  GaV$_4$S$_8$ is a multiferroic semiconductor hosting N{\\'e}el-type magnetic\nskyrmions dressed with electric polarization. At T$_s$ = 42K, the compound\nundergoes a structural phase transition of weakly first-order, from a\nnon-centrosymmetric cubic phase at high temperatures to a polar rhombohedral\nstructure at low temperatures. Below T$_s$, ferroelectric domains are formed\nwith the electric polarization pointing along any of the four $\\left< 111\n\\right>$ axes. Although in this material the size and the shape of the\nferroelectric-ferroelastic domains may act as important limiting factors in the\nformation of the N{\\'e}el-type skyrmion lattice emerging below T$_C$=13\\:K, the\ncharacteristics of polar domains in GaV$_4$S$_8$ have not been studied yet.\nHere, we report on the inspection of the local-scale ferroelectric domain\ndistribution in rhombohedral GaV$_4$S$_8$ using low-temperature piezoresponse\nforce microscopy. We observed mechanically and electrically compatible lamellar\ndomain patterns, where the lamellae are aligned parallel to the (100)-type\nplanes with a typical spacing between 100 nm-1.2 $\\mu$m. We expect that the\ncontrol of ferroelectric domain size in polar skyrmion hosts can be exploited\nfor the spatial confinement and manupulation of N{\\'e}el-type skyrmions.\n", "  Graphene has extraordinary mechanical and electronic properties, making it a\npromising material for membrane based nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).\nHere, chemical-vapor-deposited graphene is transferred onto target substrates\nto suspend it over cavities and trenches for pressure-sensor applications. The\ndevelopment of such devices requires suitable metrology methods, i.e.,\nlarge-scale characterization techniques, to confirm and analyze successful\ngraphene transfer with intact suspended graphene membranes. We propose fast and\nnoninvasive Raman spectroscopy mapping to distinguish between freestanding and\nsubstrate-supported graphene, utilizing the different strain and doping levels.\nThe technique is expanded to combine two-dimensional area scans with\ncross-sectional Raman spectroscopy, resulting in three-dimensional Raman\ntomography of membrane-based graphene NEMS. The potential of Raman tomography\nfor in-line monitoring is further demonstrated with a methodology for automated\ndata analysis to spatially resolve the material composition in micrometer-scale\nintegrated devices, including free-standing and substrate-supported graphene.\nRaman tomography may be applied to devices composed of other two-dimensional\nmaterials as well as silicon micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems.\n", "  We calculate the single-spin asymmetries $A^{W^{\\pm}}_{L}$ of $W^{\\pm}$\nbosons produced in polarized pp collisions with the valence part of the up and\ndown quark helicity distributions modeled by the light-cone\nquark-spectator-diquark model while the sea part helicity distributions of the\nup and down quarks treated as parametrization. Comparing our results with those\nfrom experimental data at RHIC, we find that the helicity distributions of sea\nquarks play an important role in the determination of the shapes of\n$A^{W^{\\pm}}_{L}$. It is shown that $A^{W^{-}}_{L}$ is sensitive to $\\Delta\n\\bar u$, while $A^{W^{+}}_{L}$ to $\\Delta \\bar d$ intuitively. The experimental\ndata of the polarized structure functions and the sum of helicities are also\nimportant to constrain the sizes of quark helicity distributions both for the\nsea part and the valence part of the nucleon.\n", "  We investigated a system based solely on a single molecular species,\nCu(tmdt)$_{2}$, accommodating $d$ and ${\\pi}$ orbitals within the molecule.\n$^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance measurements captured singlet-triplet\nexcitations of ${\\pi}$ spins indicating the existence of a\n${\\pi}$-electron-based spin-gapped Mott insulating subsystem, which has been\nhidden by the large magnetic susceptibility exhibited by the $d$ spins forming\nantiferromagnetic chains. The present results demonstrate a unique hybrid Mott\ninsulator composed of antiferromagnetic and spin-singlet Mott subsystems with\ndistinctive dimensionalities.\n", "  The tin sulfides represent a materials platform for earth-abundant\nsemiconductor technologies. We present a first-principles study of the five\nknown and proposed phases of SnS together with SnS2 and Sn2S3. Lattice-dynamics\ntechniques are used to evaluate the dynamical stability and\ntemperature-dependent thermodynamic free energy, and we also consider the\neffect of dispersion forces on the energetics. The recently identified\n{\\pi}-cubic phase of SnS is found to be metastable with respect to the\nwell-known orthorhombic Pnma/Cmcm equilibrium. The Cmcm phase is a low-lying\nsaddle point between Pnma minima on the potential-energy surface, and is\nobserved as an average structure at high temperatures. Bulk rocksalt and\nzincblende phases are found to be dynamically unstable, and we show that\nwhereas rocksalt SnS can potentially be stabilised under a reduction of the\nlattice constant, the hypothetical zincblende phase proposed in several earlier\nstudies is extremely unlikely to form. We also investigate the stability of\nSn2S3 with respect to SnS and SnS2, and find that both dispersion forces and\nvibrational contributions to the free energy are required to explain its\nexperimentally-observed resistance to decomposition.\n", "  We construct an extension of the Abelian Higgs model, which consists of a\ncomplex scalar field by including an additional real, electromagnetically\nneutral scalar field. We couple this real scalar field to the complex scalar\nfield via a quartic coupling and investigate $U(1)$ vortex solutions in this\n\"extended Abelian Higgs Model\". Since this model has two additional homogeneous\nground states, the $U(1)$ vortices that can form in this model have a richer\nstructure than in the Abelian Higgs Model. We also find the \"phase diagram\" of\nthe model showing the parameter space in which the real scalar particle\ncondenses in the vortex state while having a zero vacuum expectation value in\nthe homogeneous ground state.\n", "  We derive the 0.01 $\\mu$m binned transmission spectrum, between 0.74 and 1.0\n$\\mu$m, of WASP-80b from low resolution spectra obtained with the FORS2\ninstrument attached to ESO's Very Large Telescope. The combination of the fact\nthat WASP-80 is an active star, together with instrumental and telluric\nfactors, introduces correlated noise in the observed transit light curves,\nwhich we treat quantitatively using Gaussian Processes. Comparison of our\nresults together with those from previous studies, to theoretically calculated\nmodels reveals an equilibrium temperature in agreement with the previously\nmeasured value of 825K, and a sub-solar metallicity, as well as an atmosphere\ndepleted of molecular species with absorption bands in the IR ($\\gg 5\\sigma$).\nOur transmission spectrum alone shows evidence for additional absorption from\nthe potassium core and wing, whereby its presence is detected from analysis of\nnarrow 0.003 $\\mu$m bin light curves ($\\gg 5\\sigma$). Further observations with\nvisible and near-UV filters will be required to expand this spectrum and\nprovide more in-depth knowledge of the atmosphere. These detections are only\nmade possible through an instrument-dependent baseline model and a careful\nanalysis of systematics in the data.\n", "  We present initial results from an ongoing large-scale study of the\ncircumgalactic medium in the nearby Universe ($cz \\leq 10,000$ km/s), using\narchival Cosmic Origins Spectrograph spectra of background quasi-stellar\nobjects. This initial sample contains 33 sightlines chosen for their proximity\nto large galaxies (D > 25 kpc) and high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 10),\nyielding 48 Ly$\\alpha$ absorption lines that we have paired with 33 unique\ngalaxies, with 29 cases where multiple absorbers within a single sightline are\npaired with the same galaxy. We introduce a likelihood parameter to facilitate\nthe matching of galaxies to absorption lines in a reproducible manner. We find\nthe usual anti-correlation between Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) and impact\nparameter ($\\rho$) when we normalize by galaxy virial radius ($R_{vir}$).\nGalaxies associated with a Ly$\\alpha$ absorber are found to be more\nhighly-inclined than galaxies in the survey volume at a >99% confidence level\n(equivalent to $\\sim 3.6 \\sigma$ for a normal distribution). In contrast with\nsuggestions in other recent papers of a correlation with azimuth angle for Mg\nII absorption, we find no such correlation for Ly$\\alpha$.\n", "  We introduce variational obstacle avoidance problems on Riemannian manifolds\nand derive necessary conditions for the existence of their normal extremals.\nThe problem consists of minimizing an energy functional depending on the\nvelocity and covariant acceleration, among a set of admissible curves, and also\ndepending on a navigation function used to avoid an obstacle on the workspace,\na Riemannian manifold.\n  We study two different scenarios, a general one on a Riemannian manifold and,\na sub-Riemannian problem. By introducing a left-invariant metric on a Lie\ngroup, we also study the variational obstacle avoidance problem on a Lie group.\nWe apply the results to the obstacle avoidance problem of a planar rigid body\nand an unicycle.\n", "  It is possible to understand whether a given BPS spectrum is generated by a\nrelevant deformation of a 4D N=2 SCFT or of an asymptotically free theory from\nthe periodicity properties of the corresponding quantum monodromy. With the aim\nof giving a better understanding of the above conjecture, in this paper we\nrevisit the description of framed BPS states of four-dimensional relativistic\nquantum field theories with eight conserved supercharges in terms of\nsupersymmetric quantum mechanics. We unveil aspects of the deep\ninterrelationship in between the Seiberg-dualities of the latter, the discrete\nsymmetries of the theory in the bulk, and quantum discrete integrable systems.\n", "  In a recent Letter [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 030501 (2017)], Peiris,\nKonthasinghe, and Muller report a Franson interferometry experiment using pairs\nof photons generated from a two-level semiconductor quantum dot. The authors\nreport a visibility of 66% and claim that this visibility \"goes beyond the\nclassical limit of 50% and approaches the limit of violation of Bell's\ninequalities (70.7%).\" We explain why we do not agree with this last statement\nand how to fix the problem.\n", "  The aim of this review, based on a series of four lectures held at the 22nd\n\"Saalburg\" Summer School (2016), is to cover selected topics in the theory of\nperturbation series and their summation. The first part is devoted to\nstrategies for accelerating the rate of convergence of convergent series,\nnamely Richardson extrapolation, and the Shanks transformations, and also\ncovers a few techniques for accelerating the convergence of Fourier series. The\nsecond part focuses on divergent series, and on the tools allowing one to\nretrieve information from them. These techniques include Euler summation, Borel\nsummation, generic summation, and the method of continued functions, including\nin particular the Pad\\'e theory based on continued fractions. Finally, a brief\ndiscussion of Stieltjes series and functions is given in order to study the\nconvergence properties of Pad\\'e approximants.\n", "  Nanotubes of various kinds have been prepared in the last decade, starting\nfrom the discovery of carbon nanotubes. Recently other types of nanotubes\nincluding metallic (Au), inorganic (TiO2, HfS2, V7O16, CdSe, MoS2), and\npolymeric (polyaniline, polyacrylonitrile) have been produced. Herein we\npresent a novel synthetic procedure leading to a new kind of porous,\nhigh-surface-area nanoparticle nanotubes (NPNTs). This study characterizes the\nsynthesized silver nanotubes at optical wavelengths. The absorption spectrum of\nPAN washed silver nanotubes shows an extended absorption peak at visible\nwavelengths ranging from 350 to 700 nm. In addition, the absorption spectrum of\nrandomly oriented silver nanotubes showed plasmonic behavior, indicating high\nefficient surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) performance.\n", "  DREAMS (Dust Characterisation, Risk Assessment, and Environment Analyser on\nthe Martian Surface) is a payload accommodated on the Schiaparelli Entry and\nDescent Module (EDM) of ExoMars 2016, the ESA and Roscosmos mission to Mars\n(Esposito (2015), Bettanini et al. (2014)). It is a meteorological station with\nthe additional capability to perform measure- ments of the atmospheric electric\nfields close to the surface of Mars. The instrument package will make the first\nmeasurements of electric fields on Mars, providing data that will be of value\nin planning the second ExoMars mission in 2020, as well as possible future\nhuman missions to the red planet. This paper describes the pipeline to convert\nthe raw telemetries to the final data products for the archive, with associated\nmetadata.\n", "  This thesis is based upon the work I have done during my PhD candidature at\nMacquarie University. In this work we develop quantum technologies that are\ndirected towards realising a quantum computer. Specifically, we have made many\ntheoretical advancements in a type of quantum information processing protocol\ncalled BosonSampling. This device efficiently simulates the interaction of\nquantum particles called bosons, which no classical computer can efficiently\nsimulate. In this thesis we explore quantum random walks, which are the basis\nof how the bosons in BosonSampling interfere with each other. We explore\nimplementing BosonSampling using the most readily available photon source\ntechnology. We invented a completely new architecture which can implement\nBosonSampling in time rather than space and has since been used to make the\nworlds largest BosonSampling experiment ever performed. We look at variations\nto the traditional BosonSampling architecture by considering other quantum\nstates of light. We show a worlds first application inspired by BosonSampling\nin quantum metrology where measurements may be made more accurately than with\nany classical method. Lastly, dealing with BosonSampling, we look at\nreformulating the formalism of BosonSampling using a quantum optics approach.\nIn addition, but not related to BosonSampling, we show a protocol for\nefficiently generating large-photon Fock states, which are a type of quantum\nstate of light, that are useful for quantum computation. Also, we show a method\nfor generating a specific quantum state of light that is useful for quantum\nerror correction --- an essential component of realising a quantum computer ---\nby coupling together light and atoms.\n", "  Spherically symmetric classical model of an elementary particle or a black\nhole spacetime without central singularity had been constructed by O. B.\nZaslavskii in PRD 70(2004)104017. In this model an extremal Reissner-Nordstr%\n\\\"{o}m (RN) black hole and a Bertotti-Robinson (BR) spacetime are glued at the\nhorizon such that the inner/core spacetime is the regular BR while outside is\nthe extremal RN. In this note we investigate the stability of such a particle /\nregular black hole against linear radial perturbations. The model turns out to\nbe stable against such perturbations with a linear equation of state after the\nperturbation.\n", "  In the context of $2+1-$dimensional gravity coupled to a particular nonlinear\nelectrodynamics (NED), we obtain a class of traversable / Morris-Thorne type\nwormhole solutions. The problem is reduced to a single function dependence in\nwhich the shape function acts as generator to the wormholes. The field ansatz\nis pure magnetic and the nonlinear Lagrangian is $\\sqrt{F_{\\mu \\nu }F^{\\mu \\nu\n}}$ i.e. the square root of the Maxwell Lagrangian. In $2+1-$dimensions the\nsource-free pure magnetic non-linear Maxwell equation with square-root\nLagrangian is trivially satisfied. The exotic energy density is found\nexplicitly and the flare-out conditions are emphasized.\n", "  We argue that massive quantum fields source low-frequency long-wavelength\nmetric fluctuations through the quantum fluctuations of their stress-energy,\ngiven reasonable assumptions about the analytic structure of its correlators.\nThis can be traced back to the non-local nature of the gauge symmetry in\nGeneral Relativity, which prevents an efficient screening of UV scales (what we\ncall the cosmological non-constant problem). We define a covariant and\ngauge-invariant observable which probes line-of-sight spacetime curvature\nfluctuations on an observer's past lightcone, and show that current pulsar\ntiming data constrains any massive particle to $m\\lesssim 600$ GeV. This\nastrophysical bound severely limits the possibilities for physics beyond the\nstandard model below the scale of quantum gravity.\n", "  In this essay, I look at (bemoan) the issues surrounding simulating quantum\nsystems in order to design quantum devices for quantum technologies. The\nprogram runs into a natural difficulty that simulating quantum systems really\nrequire a proper quantum simulator. The problem is likened to the \"tyranny of\nnumbers\" that faced computer engineers in the 1960s.\n", "  The tensor formulation for the effective theory of QCD vector ressonances,\nwhose model we denote by TEVR, is given by an antisymmetric tensor field and\ndescribes spin 1 particles. Our goal is to show, by diferent approaches, that\nthe Abelian version of this model presents the so called \"spin jumping\" when we\nconsider its massless limit. Classically we find, by the use of the equations\nof motion and the Hamiltonian constraint analysis, that the massive phase of\nthe model describes spin 1 particles while its massless phase describes spin 0\nparticles. By the quantum point of view we derive these conclusions via tree\nlevel unitarity analysis and the master action approach.\n", "  Multiplex networks offer an important tool for the study of complex systems\nand extending techniques originally designed for single--layer networks is an\nimportant area of study. One of the most important methods for analyzing\nnetworks is clustering the nodes into communities that represent common\nconnectivity patterns. In this paper we extend spectral clustering to multiplex\nstructures and discuss some of the difficulties that arise in attempting to\ndefine a natural generalization. In order to analyze our approach, we describe\nthree simple, synthetic multiplex networks and compare the performance of\ndifferent multiplex models. Our results suggest that a dynamically motivated\nmodel is more successful than a structurally motivated model in discovering the\nappropriate communities.\n", "  The physics of tightly packed structures of a wire and other threadlike\nmaterials confined in cavities has been explored in recent years in connection\nwith crumpled systems and a number of topics ranging from applications to DNA\npacking in viral capsids and surgical interventions with catheter to analogies\nwith the electron gas at finite temperature and with theories of\ntwo-dimensional quantum gravity. When a long piece of wire is injected into\ntwo-dimensional cavities, it bends and originates in the jammed limit a series\nof closed structures that we call loops. In this work we study the extraction\nof a crumpled tightly packed wire from a circular cavity aiming to remove loops\nindividually. The size of each removed loop, the maximum value of the force\nneeded to unpack each loop, and the total length of the extracted wire were\nmeasured and related to an exponential growth and a mean field model consistent\nwith the literature of crumpled wires. Scaling laws for this process are\nreported and the relationship between the processes of packing and unpacking of\nwire is commented upon.\n", "  The generalized method of characteristics is used to obtain rank-2 solutions\nof the classical equations of hydrodynamics in (3+1) dimensions describing the\nmotion of a fluid medium in the presence of gravitational and Coriolis forces.\nWe determine the necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee the\nexistence of solutions expressed in terms of Riemann invariants for an\ninhomogeneous quasilinear system of partial differential equations. The paper\ncontains a detailed exposition of the theory of simple wave solutions and a\npresentation of the main tool used to study the Cauchy problem. A systematic\nuse is made of the generalized method of characteristics in order to generate\nseveral classes of wave solutions written in terms of Riemann invariants.\n", "  We propose a method to electrically control electron spins in donor-based\nqubits in silicon. By taking advantage of the hyperfine coupling difference\nbetween a single-donor and a two-donor quantum dot, spin rotation can be driven\nby inducing an electric dipole between them and applying an alternating\nelectric field generated by in-plane gates. These qubits can be coupled with\nexchange interaction controlled by top detuning gates. The qubit device can be\nfabricated deep in the silicon lattice with atomic precision by scanning\ntunneling probe technique. We have combined a large-scale full band atomistic\ntight-binding modeling approach with a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian\ndescription, providing a design with quantitative guidelines.\n", "  The cases of the Hawking radiation field being described by a pure state and\nby the usual thermal state are compared within the CGHS dilaton gravity model.\nThe field-strength fluctuations of the Fourier modes are computed, showing a\ndiscrepancy in the low-energy regime, while coinciding at high energies. Then\nby defining a distance for density operators and evaluating it for the cases\nconcerned, the difference between the pure and thermal descriptions is\nquantified and found to be exponentially small with respect to the Hawking\ntemperature. Possible physical interpretations are discussed.\n", "  We have modelled the evolution of cometary HII regions produced by zero-age\nmain-sequence stars of O and B spectral types, which are driving strong winds\nand are born off-centre from spherically symmetric cores with power-law\n($\\alpha = 2$) density slopes. A model parameter grid was produced that spans\nstellar mass, age and core density. Exploring this parameter space we\ninvestigated limb-brightening, a feature commonly seen in cometary HII regions.\nWe found that stars with mass $M_\\star \\geq 12\\, \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ produce this\nfeature. Our models have a cavity bounded by a contact discontinuity separating\nhot shocked wind and ionised ambient gas that is similar in size to the\nsurrounding HII region. Due to early pressure confinement we did not see shocks\noutside of the contact discontinuity for stars with $M_\\star \\leq 40\\,\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$, but the cavities were found to continue to grow. The cavity\nsize in each model plateaus as the HII region stagnates. The spectral energy\ndistributions of our models are similar to those from identical stars evolving\nin uniform density fields. The turn-over frequency is slightly lower in our\npower-law models due to a higher proportion of low density gas covered by the\nHII regions.\n", "  This is a commentary on two recent experimental papers in PNAS by Vivek et\nal. and Illing et al. that convincingly address an issue at the junction of two\nfundamental questions in glass physics: the role of the dimensionality of space\non the glass transition and the possible existence of long wavelength\nfluctuations in two-dimensional amorphous solids.\n", "  We demonstrate paired generation of a single photo-electron in a quantum dot\nand a single photon from a single polarization-entangled photon pair that is\ngenerated by spontaneous parametric down conversion. The electron is reated in\na GaAs quantum dot via inter-band resonantexcitation by irradiating one of the\npaired photons on the dot, while the remaining photon is detected by a single\nphoton counter. Because the paired photons are generated simultaneously, the\nphoto-electron and the remaining photon should be observed as a coincident\nevent if the traveling distance is equivalent between them. The coincidence is\nprobabilistic due to the probabilistic generation of the paired photon. We\nobserve the probability of finding the photon with the photo-electron detection\nsubstantially higher then that without the photo-electron detection and derive\nthe coincident rate comparable to the emission rate of the original photon\npairs.\n", "  Neural data analysis has increasingly incorporated causal information to\nstudy circuit connectivity. Dimensional reduction forms the basis of most\nanalyses of large multivariate time series. Here, we present a new,\nmultitaper-based decomposition for stochastic, multivariate time series that\nacts on the covariance of the time series at all lags, $C(\\tau)$, as opposed to\nstandard methods that decompose the time series, $\\mathbf{X}(t)$, using only\ninformation at zero-lag. In both simulated and neural imaging examples, we\ndemonstrate that methods that neglect the full causal structure may be\ndiscarding important dynamical information in a time series.\n", "  Even though Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) play an important role in many fields\nin astronomy, the nature of the progenitors of SNIa remain a mystery. One of\nthe classical evolutionary pathways towards a SNIa explosion is the single\ndegenerate (SD) channel, in which a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accretes matter\nfrom its non-degenerate companion until it reaches the Chandrasekhar mass.\nConstraints on the contribution from the SD channel to the overall SNIa rate\ncome from a variety of methods, e.g. from abundances, from signatures of the\ncompanion star in the light curve or near the SNIa remnant, and from synthetic\nSNIa rates. In this proceedings, I show that when incorporating our newest\nunderstandings of binary evolution, the SNIa rate from the single degenerate\nchannel is enhanced. I also discuss the applicability of these constraints on\nthe evolution of SNIa progenitors.\n", "  Detectors proposed for the International Linear Collider (ILC) incorporate a\ntungsten sampling calorimeter (`BeamCal') intended to reconstruct showers of\nelectrons, positrons and photons that emerge from the interaction point of the\ncollider with angles between 5 and 50 milliradians. For the innermost radius of\nthis calorimeter, radiation doses at shower max are expected to reach 100 Mrad\nper year, primarily due to minimum-ionizing electrons and positrons that arise\nin the induced electromagnetic showers of e$^+$e$^-$ `beamstrahlung' pairs\nproduced in the ILC beam-beam interaction. However, radiation damage to\ncalorimeter sensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions\nof shower photons, which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing\nenergy loss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic\nradiation. We report here on prior highlights and recent results of SLAC\nExperiment T-506, for which several different types of semiconductor sensors\nwere exposed to doses of radiation induced by showering electrons of energy\n3.5-13.3 GeV. By embedding the sensor under irradiation within a tungsten\nradiator, the exposure incorporated hadronic species that would potentially\ncontribute to the degradation of a sensor mounted in a precision sampling\ncalorimeter. Depending on sensor technology, significant post-irradiation\ncharge collection was observed for doses of several hundred Mrad.\n", "  We propose a new scheme for high gain harmonic generation free electron\nlasers (HGHG FELs), which is seeded by a pair of intersecting laser beams to\ninteract with an electron beam in a modulator undulator located in a dispersive\nsection. The interference of the laser beams gives rise to a two-dimensional\nmodulation in the energy-time phase space because of a strong correlation\nbetween the electron energy and the position in the direction of dispersion.\nThis eventually forms pseudo energy bands in the electron beam, which results\nin efficient harmonic generation in HGHG FELs in a similar manner to the\nwell-known scheme using the echo effects, with the requirement on the energy\nmodulation being much more relaxed.\n", "  The positive definite Kohn-Sham kinetic energy(KS-KE) density plays crucial\nrole in designing semilocal meta generalized gradient approximations(meta-GGAs)\nfor low dimensional quantum systems. It has been rigorously shown that near\nnucleus and at the asymptotic region, the KE-KS differ from its von\nWeizs\\\"{a}cker(VW) counterpart as contributions from different orbitals (i.e.,\ns and p orbitals) play important role. This has been explored using two\ndimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator as a test case. Several\nmeta-GGA ingredients with different physical behaviors are also constructed and\nfurther used to design an accurate semilocal functionals at meta-GGA level. In\nthe asymptotic region, a new exchange energy functional is constructed using\nthe meta-GGA ingredients with formally exact properties of the enhancement\nfactor. Also, it has been shown that exact asymptotic behavior of the exchange\nenergy density and potential can be attained by choosing accurately the\nenhancement factor as a functional of meta-GGA ingredients.\n", "  As the photovoltaic community accelerates the development of new absorber\ncandidate materials towards high-performing PV devices, it is essential to\nfollow best practices and leverage deeper characterization tools. We have\nidentified temperature- and illumination-dependent current density-voltage\n$J$($V$,$T$,$i$) and electron-beam induced current (EBIC) measurements as two\npowerful PV device characterization techniques to evaluate the potential of\nnovel absorber candidate materials. Herein, we focus on the experimental\nmethods and best practices for applying $J$($V$,$T$,$i$) and EBIC, addressing\nparticular challenges in sample preparation and mounting. We demonstrate these\non the example of tin monosulfide, a promising PV absorber candidate material\nthat shares characteristics of many novel thin-film PV absorbers: mechanically\nsoft, polycrystalline, and used in heterojunction thin-film PV devices.\n", "  The gauge dependence in the anomalous dimension of the\ngauge-invariant-canonical-energy-momentum tensor for proton is studied by the\nbackground field method. The naive calculation shows the problem, the absence\nof the counter term in the gluonic sectors. The analysis shows that the result\n[Chen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 062001 (2009)] is derived from the\nbackground field method after we introduced a trick to avoid the problem except\nfor the gluon-to-gluon sector; it is gauge dependent. The possible reason of\nthis gauge-dependent result comes from the nontrivial treatment of the\ncondition $F^{\\mu\\nu}_{pure}=0$ at a higher order. This result shows that one\nneeds a further improvement in treating this condition with a covariant way at\na higher order by the background field method. In particular, we have to focus\non two checkpoints, the gauge independence and zero eigenvalue in the\nanomalous-dimension matrix, in order to test the validity of the\ngauge-invariant-canonical-energy-momentum tensor.\n", "  The Gr\\\"uneisen relation is shown to be important for the thermodynamics of\ndense liquids.\n", "  The main objective of this paper is to study the existence of a finite\ndimension global attractor for the three dimensional viscous primitive\nequations of large-scale atmosphere. Thanks to the shortage of the uniqueness\nof weak solutions, we prove the existence of a global attractor with finite\nfractal dimension for the three dimensional viscous primitive equations of\nlarge-scale atmosphere by using the method of $\\ell$-trajectories.\n", "  Instabilities in rotating detonation are concerned because of their potential\ninfluence on the stability of operation. Previous studies on instability of 2-D\nrotating detonation mainly cared about the one of the contact discontinuity\noriginated from the conjunction of the detonation and oblique shock. Hishida et\nal. first found the rippled structure existed in the interface between fresh\ninjections and burnt product from the previous cycle (Shock Waves 19, 2009),\nand a mechanism of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability was suggested as well. Similar\nstructures were observed as well in simulations by current authors, where a\nfifth-order WENO-type scheme with improved resolution and\n7-species-and-8-reaction chemical model were used. In order to achieve a deep\nunderstanding on the flow mechanism, more careful simulations are carried out\nby using three grids with increasing resolution. The results show that besides\nthe previously-mentioned Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, there are two other\nmechanisms which take effect in the interface instability, i.e., the effect of\nbaroclinic torque and Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Occurrence conditions for\ntwo instabilities are checked and testified. Especially, the spike- and\nbubble-like structures are observed at the interface, which show appearances\ndifferent from canonical structures by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.\n", "  Topological nodal-line semimetals (TNLSs) exhibit exotic physical phenomena\ndue to a one-dimensional (1D) band touching line, rather than discrete (Dirac\nor Weyl) points. While so far proposed two-dimensional (2D) TNLSs possess\nclosed nodal lines (NLs) only when spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is neglected, here\nusing Na$_3$Bi trilayers as an example, we show that 2D TNLSs can been obtained\nfrom topological (crystalline) insulators (TI/TCI) by time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking even in the presence of SOC. We further reveal that these obtained NLs\nare protected by crystalline mirror symmetry, while a mirror symmetry breaking\nperturbation opens a full gap thus giving rise to a phase transition from 2D\nTNLS to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). We thereby uncover a close\ncorrelation between various topological phases. Remarkably, a strong spin Hall\neffect, important for transport applications, is predicted in 2D TNLS. Finally,\na Na$_2$CrBi trilayer is proposed to realize the 2D TNLS without extrinsic\nmagnetic field. Our work not only proposes a new strategy for realizing 2D\nTNLSs with truely closed NLs, but also reveals potential applications of TNLS\nin spintronics.\n", "  We studied the effect of collimation for monochromatic beams of spin waves,\nresulting from the refraction at the interface separating two magnetic\nhalf-planes. The collimation was observed in broad range of the angles of\nncidence for homogenous Co and Py half-planes, due to significant intrinsic\nanisotropy of spin wave propagation in these materials. The effect exists for\nthe sample saturated by in plane magnetic field tangential to the interface.\nThe collimation for all possible angles of incidence was found in the system\nwhere the incident spin wave is refracted on the interface between homogeneous\nand periodically patterned layers of YIG. The refraction was investigated by\nthe analysis of isofrequency dispersion contours of both pairs materials, i.e.,\nuniform YIG/patterned YIG and Co/Py, which are calculated with the aid of the\nplane wave method. Besides, the refraction in Co/Py system was studied using\nmicromagnetic simulations.\n", "  Robotics enables a variety of unconventional actuation strategies to be used\nfor endoscopes, resulting in reduced trauma to the GI tract. For transmission\nof force to distally mounted endoscopic instruments, robotically actuated\ntendon sheath mechanisms are the current state of the art. Robotics in surgical\nendoscopy enables an ergonomic mapping of the surgeon movements to remotely\ncontrolled slave arms, facilitating tissue manipulation. The learning curve for\ndifficult procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection and\nfull-thickness resection can be significantly reduced. Improved surgical\noutcomes are also observed from clinical and pre-clinical trials. The\ntechnology behind master-slave surgical robotics will continue to mature, with\nthe addition of position and force sensors enabling better control and tactile\nfeedback. More robotic assisted GI luminal and NOTES surgeries are expected to\nbe conducted in future, and gastroenterologists will have a key collaborative\nrole to play.\n", "  We demonstrate pronounced electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation\nin naturally inversion symmetric 2H stacked bilayer MoS$_{2}$ embedded into\nmicrocapacitor devices. By applying strong external electric field\nperturbations ($|F| = \\pm 2.6 MVcm^{-1}$) perpendicular to the basal plane of\nthe crystal we control the inversion symmetry breaking and, hereby, tune the\nnonlinear conversion efficiency. Strong tunability of the nonlinear response is\nobserved throughout the energy range ($E_{\\omega} \\sim 1.25 eV - 1.47 eV$)\nprobed by measuring the second-harmonic response at $E_{2\\omega}$, spectrally\ndetuned from both the A- and B-exciton resonances. A 60-fold enhancement of the\nsecond-order nonlinear signal is obtained for emission at $E_{2\\omega} = 2.49\neV$, energetically detuned by $\\Delta E = E_{2\\omega} - E_C = -0.26 eV$ from\nthe C-resonance ($E_{C} = 2.75 eV$). The pronounced spectral dependence of the\nelectric-field-induced second-harmonic generation signal reflects the\nbandstructure and wave function admixture and exhibits particularly strong\ntunability below the C-resonance, in good agreement with Density Functional\nTheory calculations. Moreover, we show that the field-induced second-harmonic\ngeneration relies on the interlayer coupling in the bilayer. Our findings\nstrongly suggest that the strong tunability of the electric-field-induced\nsecond-harmonic generation signal in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides\nmay find applications in miniaturized electrically switchable nonlinear\ndevices.\n", "  We present the first use of in situ far-infrared spectroscopy to analyze the\nthermal amorphization of a zeolitic imidazolate framework material. We explain\nthe nature of vibrational motion changes during the amorphization process and\nreveal new insights into the effect that temperature has on the Zn-N\ntetrahedra.\n", "  The analysis of clouds in the earth's atmosphere is important for a variety\nof applications, viz. weather reporting, climate forecasting, and solar energy\ngeneration. In this paper, we focus our attention on the impact of cloud on the\ntotal solar irradiance reaching the earth's surface. We use weather station to\nrecord the total solar irradiance. Moreover, we employ collocated ground-based\nsky camera to automatically compute the instantaneous cloud coverage. We\nanalyze the relationship between measured solar irradiance and computed cloud\ncoverage value, and conclude that higher cloud coverage greatly impacts the\ntotal solar irradiance. Such studies will immensely help in solar energy\ngeneration and forecasting.\n", "  The Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD) is one of the candidate sensor technologies for\nthe ILC vertex detector. The vertex detector is located near the interaction\npoint, thus high radiation tolerance is required. Charge transfer efficiency of\nCCD is degraded by radiation damage which makes traps in pixels. We measured\ncharge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of a neutron irradiated FPCCD prototype. We\nobserved a degradation of CTI compared with non-irradiated CCD. To improve the\nCTI of irradiated CCD, we performed the fat-zero charge injection to fill the\ntraps. In this paper, we report a status of CTI improvement.\n", "  We present 3-79 keV NuSTAR observations of the neutron star low-mass X-ray\nbinary 4U 1636-53 in the soft, transitional and hard state. The spectra display\na broad emission line at 5-10 keV. We applied several models to fit this line:\nA GAUSSIAN line, a relativistically broadened emission line model, KYRLINE, and\ntwo models including relativistically smeared and ionized reflection off the\naccretion disc with different coronal heights, RELXILL and RELXILLLP. All\nmodels fit the spectra well, however, the KYRLINE and RELXILL models yield an\ninclination of the accretion disc of $\\sim88\\degree$ with respect to the line\nof sight, which is at odds with the fact that this source shows no dips or\neclipses. The RELXILLLP model, on the other hand, gives a reasonable\ninclination of $\\sim56\\degree$. We discuss our results for these models in this\nsource and the possible primary source of the hard X-rays.\n", "  The purpose of this letter is to point out a relation between the boundary\ncondition satisfied by spherically symmetric isolated horizons (formulated in\nterms of Ashtekar-Barbero variables) and the source-target matching condition\n(also known as fake flatness condition) in higher gauge theory. This relation\nmay prove useful in the attempt to quantize the isolated horizon boundary\ncondition which is in turn a possible starting point for the search for black\nhole solutions in the full theory of loop quantum gravity. Also, since a\n2-connection is the mathematical object required for describing the parallel\ntransport of 1-dimensional objects, the relation presented in this letter may\nprovide further insight into the coupling of LQG to string-like objects\ninvestigated in other contexts.\n", "  We introduce a method of local gating for van der Waals heterostructures,\nemploying a few-layer graphene patterned bottom gate. Being a member of the 2D\nmaterial family, few-layer graphene adapts perfectly to the commonly used\nstacking method. Its versatility regarding patterning as well as its flatness\nmake it an ideal candidate for experiments on locally gated 2D materials.\nMoreover, in combination with ultra-thin hexagonal boron nitride as an\ninsulating layer, sharp potential steps can be created and the quality of the\ninvestigated 2D material can be sustained. To underline the good feasibility\nand performance, we show results on transport experiments in periodically\nmodulated graphene- boron nitride heterostructures, where the charge carrier\ndensity is tuned via locally acting patterned few layer graphene bottom gates\nand a global back gate.\n", "  We develop a magnetic ribbon model for molecular cloud filaments. These\nresult from turbulent compression in a molecular cloud in which the background\nmagnetic field sets a preferred direction. We use our model to calculate a\nsynthetic observed relation between apparent width in projection versus\nobserved column density. The relationship is relatively flat, in rough\nagreement with the observations, and unlike the simple expectation based on a\nJeans length argument.\n", "  Multiplicity data up to 200 GeV in e+e- annihilation are described well by\nthe two-stage model based on pQCD and suggested the phenomenological scheme of\nhadronization. This model confirms the fragmentation mechanism of hadronization\n(in vacuum). It allows to estimate mean multiplicity at 500 GeV and 1 TeV.\nGluon dominance model is the modification of this model for the description of\nhadronic interactions. It was realised by an inclusion of gluons. It\ndemonstrates very strong evidence of the recombination mechanism of\nhadronization. In this case, the mean multiplicity of hadrons formed from a\nsingle gluon grows with energy and it exceeds the corresponding values for\nlepton interactions. At the same time, the region of high multiplicity is\nstipulated for splitting of active gluons. The excess of soft photon yield is\nexperimentally confirmed at Nuclotron (JINR) in the interactions of the 3.5A\nGeV/c deuteron and lithium beams with the carbon target.\n", "  Planck's law for black-body radiation marks the origin of quantum theory and\nis discussed in all introductory (or advanced) courses on this subject.\nHowever, the question whether Planck really implied quantisation is debated\namong historians of physics. We present a simplified account of this debate\nwhich also sheds light on the issue of indistinguishability and Einstein's\nlight quantum hypothesis. We suggest that the teaching of quantum mechanics\ncould benefit from including this material beyond the question of historical\naccuracy.\n", "  The results of the SERP-E-184 experiment at the U-70 accelerator (IHEP,\nProtvino) are presented. Interactions of the 70 GeV proton beam with C, Si and\nPb targets were studied to detect decays of charmed $D^0$, $\\overline D^0$,\n$D^+$, $D^-$ mesons and $\\Lambda _c^+$ baryon near their production threshold.\nMeasurements of lifetimes and masses are shown a good agreement with PDG data.\nThe inclusive cross sections of charm production and their A-dependencies were\nobtained. The yields of these particles are compared with the theoretical\npredictions and the data of other experiments. The measured cross section of\nthe total open charm production ($\\sigma _{\\mathrm {tot}}(c\\overline c)$ = 7.1\n$\\pm $ 2.3(stat) $\\pm $1.4(syst) $\\mu $b/nucleon) at the collision c.m. energy\n$\\sqrt {s}$ = 11.8 GeV is well above the QCD model predictions. The\ncontributions of different species of charmed particles to the total cross\nsection of the open charm production in proton-nucleus interactions vary with\nenergy.\n", "  The universal value of Faraday rotation angle close to the fine structure\nconstant is experimentally observed in thin HgTe quantum wells with thickness\non the border between trivial insulating and the topologically non-trivial\nDirac phases. The quantized value of the Faraday angle remains robust in the\nbroad range of magnetic fields and gate voltages. Dynamic Hall conductivity of\nthe hole-like carriers extracted from the analysis of the transmission data\nshows theoretically predicted universal value of consistent with the doubly\ndegenerate Dirac state. On shifting the Fermi level by the gate voltage the\neffective sign of the charge carriers changes from positive (holes) to negative\n(electrons). The electron-like part of the dynamic response does not show\nquantum plateaus and is well described within the classical Drude model.\n", "  We employ an effective-field theory with correlations in order to study a\nmagnetocaloric effect on a triangular Ising antiferromagnet, which is\nselectively diluted by non-magnetic impurities on one of the three sublattices.\nSuch a dilution generally relieves massive degeneracy in our system and\ntherefore the ground-state entropy diminishes and the magnetocaloric effect\nweakens at low temperatures. However, at relatively higher temperatures we can\nobserve significantly enhanced negative isothermal entropy changes for the\nsublattice concentration $p_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.8$.\n", "  Even though the traditional dynamical decoupling methods have the ability to\nresist dynamic dephasing caused by low frequency noise, they are not\nappropriate for suppressing the residual geometric dephasing, which arises from\nthe disturbance for the geometric loop in the parameter space. This prevents\nthe precision of quantum manipulation based geometric quantum gates from being\npromoted further. In this paper, we design two kinds of modified dynamical\ndecoupling schemes to suppress the residual geometric dephasing. The further\nnumerical simulation demonstrates the validity of our schemes.\n", "  We propose a scheme to realize the two-axis counter-twisting spin-squeezing\nHamiltonian inside an optical cavity with the aid of phase-locked atom-photon\ncoupling. By careful analysis and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that our\nscheme is robust against dissipation caused by cavity loss and atomic\nspontaneous emission, and it can achieve significantly higher squeezing than\none axis twisting. We further show how our idea can be extended to generate\ntwo-mode spin-squeezed states in two coupled cavities. Due to its easy\nimplementation and high tunability, our scheme is experimentally realizable\nwith current technologies.\n", "  We study the manipulation of quantum entanglement by periodic external\nfields. As an entanglement measure we compute numerically the concurrence of\ntwo flux qubits coupled inductively and/or capacitively, both driven by a dc+ac\nmagnetic flux. Also we find an analytical lower bound for the concurrence,\nwhere the dominant terms correspond to the concurrence in the Floquet states.\n  We show that it is possible to create or destroy entanglement in a controlled\nway by tuning the system at or near multiphoton resonances. We find that when\nthe driving term of the Hamiltonian does not commute with the qubit-qubit\ninteraction term, the control of the entanglement induced by the driving field\nis more robust in parameter space. This implies that capacitively coupled two\nflux qubits are more convenient for controlling entanglement through ac driving\nfluxes.\n", "  In this work we consider the ontological status of the Unruh effect. Is it\njust a formal mathematical result? Or the temperature detected by an\naccelerating observer can lead to real physical effects such as phase\ntransition. In order to clarify this issue we use the Thermalization Theorem to\nexplore the possibility of having a restoration of the symmetry in a system\nwith spontaneous symmetry breaking of an internal continuous symmetry as seen\nby an accelerating observer. We conclude that the Unruh effect is an ontic\neffect, rather than an epistemic one, giving rise, in the particular example\nconsidered here, to a phase transition (symmetry restoration) in the region\nclose to the accelerating observer horizon.\n", "  The paper contains an extension of the Khristianovich-Geertsma-de Klerk (KGD)\nmodel to the case when the confining rock pressure, which closes a hydraulic\nfracture, varies in the direction of its propagation. The extension is impelled\nby the need to simulate fracture hampering (acceleration) when it penetrates\ninto a layer with increased (decreased) rock pressure. The paper presents the\nproblem formulation, an efficient numerical method for its solving, examples of\nfractures propagating through layers with various stresses and general\nconclusions. It is established that when the fracture enters a layer with\nincreased rock stresses (positive stress contrast), it actually stops. In this\ncase, the fluid particle velocity drops practically to zero and the velocity\nnear the tip oscillates about a small value until the fluid pressure increases\nto the level of the increased rock pressure. In the opposite case, when the\nfracture enters a layer with decreased stresses (negative stress contrast), the\nfracture front accelerates until the fluid pressure drops to the level of the\ndecreased rock pressure. Physical considerations and numerical results imply\nthat the transition through a boundary of layers with different stresses may be\ncharacterized by a simple dimensionless parameter. The latter is defined as the\nratio of the average difference between the fluid and rock pressures (at the\nmoment of reaching the contact) to the stress jump at the contact. The\nparameter is applicable to contacts with positive as well as negative\ncontrasts. The model and the method developed are to serve for improvement of\nthe popular pseudo three-dimensional (P3D) model.\n", "  The recent LIGO detection of gravitational waves from black-hole binaries\noffers the exciting possibility of testing gravitational theories in the\npreviously inaccessible strong-field, highly relativistic regime. While the\nLIGO detections are so far consistent with the predictions of General\nRelativity, future gravitational-wave observations will allow us to explore\nthis regime to unprecedented accuracy. One of the generic predictions of\ntheories of gravity that extend General Relativity is the violation of the\nstrong equivalence principle, i.e. strongly gravitating bodies such as neutron\nstars and black holes follow trajectories that depend on their nature and\ncomposition. This has deep consequences for gravitational-wave emission, which\ntakes place with additional degrees of freedom besides the tensor polarizations\nof General Relativity. I will briefly review the formalism needed to describe\nthese extra emission channels, and show that binary black-hole observations\nprobe a set of gravitational theories that are largely disjoint from those that\nare testable with binary pulsars or neutron stars.\n", "  A method for inverse design of horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWTs) is\npresented in this paper. The direct solver for aerodynamic analysis solves the\nReynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations, where the effect of the\nturbine rotor is modeled as momentum sources using the actuator disk model\n(ADM); this approach is referred to as RANS/ADM. The inverse problem is posed\nas follows: for a given selection of airfoils, the objective is to find the\nblade geometry (described as blade twist and chord distributions) which\nrealizes the desired turbine aerodynamic performance at the design point; the\ndesired performance is prescribed as angle of attack ($\\alpha$) and axial\ninduction factor ($a$) distributions along the blade. An iterative approach is\nused. An initial estimate of blade geometry is used with the direct solver\n(RANS/ADM) to obtain $\\alpha$ and $a$. The differences between the calculated\nand desired values of $\\alpha$ and $a$ are computed and a new estimate for the\nblade geometry (chord and twist) is obtained via nonlinear least squares\nregression using the Trust-Region-Reflective (TRF) method. This procedure is\ncontinued until the difference between the calculated and the desired values is\nwithin acceptable tolerance. The method is demonstrated for conventional,\nsingle-rotor HAWTs and then extended to multi-rotor, specifically dual-rotor\nwind turbines. The TRF method is also compared with the multi-dimensional\nNewton iteration method and found to provide better convergence when\nconstraints are imposed in blade design, although faster convergence is\nobtained with the Newton method for unconstrained optimization.\n", "  The theoretical study of the optical properties of TE- and TM- modes in a\nfour-layer structure composed of the magneto-optical yttrium iron garnet\nguiding layer on a dielectric substrate covered by planar nanocomposite guiding\nmultilayer is presented. The dispersion equation is obtained taking into\naccount the bigyrotropic properties of yttrium-iron garnet, and an original\nalgorithm for the guided modes identification is proposed. The dispersion\nspectra are analyzed and the energy flux distributions across the structure are\ncalculated. The fourfold difference between the partial power fluxes within the\nwaveguide layers is achieved in the wavelength range of 200 nm.\n", "  We prove that conformal curved spacetime can be encoded into the initial wave\nfunction and that curved propagation can be simulated on a two-dimensional\nregular lattice with a finite set of homogeneous unitary operators. We\ngeneralize recent results shown in [1], where the author transforms\nflat-spacetime in curved static spacetime via non-unitary rotations. In\nparticular, encoding the metric in the initial quantum state via unitary local\nrotations, can naturally be useful for quantum simulators due to the efficiency\nand simplicity of the implementation scheme. We validate our model proving that\nthe continuous limit converges to the Dirac Eq. in curved spacetime.\n", "  For the International Large Detector (ILD), foreseen to be built at the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC), a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is\nintended to be used as the main tracking detector. The amplification will be\nprovided by Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGDs). One option is the use of\nGas Electron Multipliers (GEM) in combination with a segmented pad readout\nplane. The TPC group at DESY developed a modular system implementing a triple\nGEM stack mounted on thin ceramic grids. This material choice allows for high\nmechanical rigidity of the support structure at a reduced amount of material\nand dead area compared to commonly used GRP frames.\n  This contribution gives an overview of the current status of this system.\nThis includes a discussion of points we wanted to improve over the last\ngeneration of modules and what was implemented in the newest version. Also\nimprovements in the production process of the modules, which ensure a\nconsistent quality and present a step towards possible batch production.\n", "  In scaling of transistor dimensions with low source-to-drain currents, 1D\nsemiconductors with certain electronic properties are highly desired. We\ndiscover three new 1D materials, SbSeI, SbSI and SbSBr with high stability and\nnovel electronic properties based on first principles calculations. Both\ndynamical and thermal stability of these 1D materials are examined. The\nbulk-to-1D transition results in dramatic changes in band gap, effective mass\nand static dielectric constant due to quantum confinement, making 1D SbSeI a\nhighly promising channel material for transistors with gate length shorter than\n1 nm. Under small uniaxial strain, these materials are transformed from\nindirect into direct band gap semiconductors, paving the way for optoelectronic\ndevices and mechanical sensors. Moreover, the thermoelectric performance of\nthese materials is significantly improved over their bulk counterparts.\nFinally, we demonstrate the experimental feasibility of synthesizing such\natomically sharp V-VI-VII compounds. These highly desirable properties render\nSbSeI, SbSI and SbSBr promising 1D materials for applications in future\nmicroelectronics, optoelectronics, mechanical sensors, and thermoelectrics.\n", "  It is shown that gravity can be incorporated into the Standard Model (SM) in\na way solving the hierarchy problem. For this, the SM effective action in flat\nspacetime is adapted to curved spacetime via not only the general covariance\nbut also the gauge invariance. For the latter, gauge field hard masses, induced\nby loops at the UV scale $\\Lambda$, are dispelled by construing $\\Lambda$ as\nthe constant value assigned to curvature. This gives way to an unprecedented\nmechanism for incorporating gravity into the SM in that the hierarchy problem\nis solved by transmutation of the Higgs boson $\\Lambda^2$--mass into the\nHiggs-curvature coupling, and the cosmological constant problem is alleviated\nby metamorphosis of the vacuum $\\Lambda^4$--energy into the Einstein-Hilbert\nterm. Gravity emerges correctly if the SM is accompanied by a secluded dark\nsector sourcing non-interacting dark matter, dark energy and dark radiation.\nPhysics beyond the SM, containing Higgs-phobic scalars that resolve the strong\nCP problem, flavor problem, baryogenesis and inflation, respects the hierarchy.\nMajorana neutrinos are naturally incorporated if $\\Lambda$ lies at the see-saw\nscale. This mechanism, in general, leaves no compelling reason to anticipate\nnew particles at the LHC or higher-energy colliders.\n", "  The beams at the ILC produce electron positron pairs due to beam-beam\ninteractions. This note presents for the first time a study of these processes\nin a detailed simulation, which shows that these pair background particles\nappear at angles that extend to the inner layers of the detector. The full data\nset of pairs produced in one bunch crossing was used to calculate the helix\ntracks, which the particles form in the solenoid field of the SiD detector. The\nresults suggest to further study the reduction of the beam pipe radius and\ntherefore to either add another SiD vertex detector layer, or reduce the radius\nof the existing vertex detector layers, without increasing the detector\noccupancy significantly. This has to go along with additional studies whether\nthe improvement in physics reconstruction methods, like c-tagging, is worth the\nincreased background level at smaller radii.\n", "  To suppress the muon background arising from the Beam Delivery System (BDS)\nof the International Linear Collider (ILC), and to hinder it from reaching the\ninteraction region, two different shielding scenarios are under discussion:\nfive cylindrical muon spoilers with or without an additional magnetized\nshielding wall. Due to cost and safety issues, the scenario preferred by the\nMachine-Detector-Interface (MDI) group is to omit the shielding wall, although\nomitting it also has disadvantages. To support the decision making for the muon\nshielding, the impact of the muons from the two different shielding scenarios\nwas studied in a full Geant4 detector simulation of the SiD detector, one of\ntwo proposed detectors for the ILC. Input to this study is the muon background\ncreated by the beam traveling through the BDS, which was simulated with\nMUCARLO.\n"]}
