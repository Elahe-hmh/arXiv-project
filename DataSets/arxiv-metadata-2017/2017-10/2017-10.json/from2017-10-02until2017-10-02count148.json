Although the proton intensity was very low, with only one pilot\nbunch per beam, and no systematic attempt was made to optimize the collision\noptics, all LHC experiments reported a number of collision candidates. In the\nALICE experiment, the collision region was centred very well in both the\nlongitudinal and transverse directions and 284 events were recorded in\ncoincidence with the two passing proton bunches. The events were immediately\nreconstructed and analyzed both online and offline. We have used these events\nto measure the pseudorapidity density of charged primary particles in the\ncentral region. In the range |$\\eta$| < 0.5, we obtain dNch/deta = 3.10 $\\pm$\n0.13 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.22 (syst.) for all inelastic interactions, and dNch/deta =\n3.51 $\\pm$ 0.15 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.25 (syst.) for non-single diffractive\ninteractions. These results are consistent with previous measurements in\nproton-antiproton interactions at the same centre-of-mass energy at the CERN\nSppS collider. They also illustrate the excellent functioning and rapid\nprogress of the LHC accelerator, and of both the hardware and software of the\nALICE experiment, in this early start-up phase.\n", "  ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is the LHC (Large Hadron Collider)\nexperiment devoted to investigating the strongly interacting matter created in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at the LHC energies. The ALICE ITS, Inner Tracking\nSystem, consists of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors with three\ndifferent technologies; in the outward direction: two layers of pixel\ndetectors, two layers each of drift, and strip detectors. The number of\nparameters to be determined in the spatial alignment of the 2198 sensor modules\nof the ITS is about 13,000. The target alignment precision is well below 10\nmicron in some cases (pixels). The sources of alignment information include\nsurvey measurements, and the reconstructed tracks from cosmic rays and from\nproton-proton collisions. The main track-based alignment method uses the\nMillepede global approach. An iterative local method was developed and used as\nwell. We present the results obtained for the ITS alignment using about 10^5\ncharged tracks from cosmic rays that have been collected during summer 2008,\nwith the ALICE solenoidal magnet switched off.\n", "  Charged-particle production was studied in proton-proton collisions collected\nat the LHC with the ALICE detector at centre-of-mass energies 0.9 TeV and 2.36\nTeV in the pseudorapidity range |$\\eta$| < 1.4. In the central region (|$\\eta$|\n< 0.5), at 0.9 TeV, we measure charged-particle pseudorapidity density\ndNch/deta = 3.02 $\\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ (syst.) for inelastic\ninteractions, and dNch/deta = 3.58 $\\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^{+0.12}_{-0.12}$\n(syst.) for non-single-diffractive interactions. At 2.36 TeV, we find dNch/deta\n= 3.77 $\\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^{+0.25}_{-0.12}$ (syst.) for inelastic, and\ndNch/deta = 4.43 $\\pm$ 0.01 (stat.) $^{+0.17}_{-0.12}$ (syst.) for\nnon-single-diffractive collisions. The relative increase in charged-particle\nmultiplicity from the lower to higher energy is 24.7% $\\pm$ 0.5% (stat.)\n$^{+5.7}_{-2.8}$% (syst.) for inelastic and 23.7% $\\pm$ 0.5% (stat.)\n$^{+4.6}_{-1.1}$% (syst.) for non-single-diffractive interactions. This\nincrease is consistent with that reported by the CMS collaboration for\nnon-single-diffractive events and larger than that found by a number of\ncommonly used models. The multiplicity distribution was measured in different\npseudorapidity intervals and studied in terms of KNO variables at both\nenergies. The results are compared to proton-antiproton data and to model\npredictions.\n", "  The pseudorapidity density and multiplicity distribution of charged particles\nproduced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, at a centre-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV, were measured in the central pseudorapidity region |$\\eta$|\n< 1. Comparisons are made with previous measurements at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 0.9 TeV\nand 2.36 TeV. At $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV, for events with at least one charged\nparticle in |$\\eta$| < 1, we obtain dNch/deta = 6.01 $\\pm$ 0.01 (stat.)\n$^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ (syst.). This corresponds to an increase of 57.6% $\\pm$ 0.4%\n(stat.) $^{+3.6}_{-1.8}$% (syst.) relative to collisions at 0.9 TeV,\nsignificantly higher than calculations from commonly used models. The\nmultiplicity distribution at 7 TeV is described fairly well by the negative\nbinomial distribution.\n", "  The ratio of the yields of antiprotons to protons in pp collisions has been\nmeasured by the ALICE experiment at $\\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ and $7$ TeV during the\ninitial running periods of the Large Hadron Collider(LHC). The measurement\ncovers the transverse momentum interval $0.45 < p_{\\rm{t}} < 1.05$ GeV/$c$ and\nrapidity $|y| < 0.5$. The ratio is measured to be $R_{|y| < 0.5} = 0.957 \\pm\n0.006 (stat.) \\pm 0.014 (syst.)$ at $0.9$ TeV and $R_{|y| < 0.5} = 0.991 \\pm\n0.005 (stat.) \\pm 0.014 (syst.)$ at $7$ TeV and it is independent of both\nrapidity and transverse momentum. The results are consistent with the\nconventional model of baryon-number transport and set stringent limits on any\nadditional contributions to baryon-number transfer over very large rapidity\nintervals in pp collisions.\n", "  We report on the measurement of two-pion correlation functions from pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s}=900$ GeV performed by the ALICE experiment at the Large\nHadron Collider. Our analysis shows an increase of the HBT radius with\nincreasing event multiplicity, in line with other measurements done in\nparticle- and nuclear collisions. Conversely, the strong decrease of the radius\nwith increasing transverse momentum, as observed at RHIC and at Tevatron, is\nnot manifest in our data.\n", "  The inclusive charged particle transverse momentum distribution is measured\nin proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 900$ GeV at the LHC using the ALICE\ndetector. The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region\n$(|\\eta|<0.8)$ over the transverse momentum range $0.15<p_{\\rm T}<10$ GeV/$c$.\nThe correlation between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity is also\nstudied. Results are presented for inelastic (INEL) and non-single-diffractive\n(NSD) events. The average transverse momentum for $|\\eta|<0.8$ is $\\left<p_{\\rm\nT}\\right>_{\\rm INEL}=0.483\\pm0.001$ (stat.) $\\pm0.007$ (syst.) GeV/$c$ and\n$\\left<p_{\\rm T}\\right>_{\\rm NSD}=0.489\\pm0.001$ (stat.) $\\pm0.007$ (syst.)\nGeV/$c$, respectively. The data exhibit a slightly larger $\\left<p_{\\rm\nT}\\right>$ than measurements in wider pseudorapidity intervals. The results are\ncompared to simulations with the Monte Carlo event generators PYTHIA and\nPHOJET.\n", "  We perform detailed analytical and numerical studies of a recently proposed\nmethod for a spectroscopic measurement of the superfluid fraction of an\nultracold atomic gas [N. R. Cooper and Z. Hadzibabic, Phys. Rev. Lett. 104,\n030401 (2010)]. Previous theoretical work is extended by explicitly including\nthe effects of non-zero temperature and interactions, and assessing the\nquantitative accuracy of the proposed measurement for a one-component Bose gas.\nWe show that for suitably chosen experimental parameters the method yields an\nexperimentally detectable signal and a sufficiently accurate measurement. This\nis illustrated by explicitly considering two key examples: First, for a weakly\ninteracting three-dimensional Bose gas it reproduces the expected result that\nbelow the critical temperature the superfluid fraction closely follows the\ncondensate fraction. Second, it allows a clear quantitative differentiation of\nthe superfluid and the condensate density in a strongly interacting Bose gas.\n", "  We report the first measurement of charged particle elliptic flow in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at 2.76 TeV with the ALICE detector at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider. The measurement is performed in the central pseudorapidity region\n(|$\\eta$|<0.8) and transverse momentum range 0.2< $p_{\\rm T}$< 5.0 GeV/$c$. The\nelliptic flow signal v$_2$, measured using the 4-particle correlation method,\naveraged over transverse momentum and pseudorapidity is 0.087 $\\pm$ 0.002\n(stat) $\\pm$ 0.004 (syst) in the 40-50% centrality class. The differential\nelliptic flow v$_2(p_{\\rm T})$ reaches a maximum of 0.2 near $p_{\\rm T}$ = 3\nGeV/$c$. Compared to RHIC Au-Au collisions at 200 GeV, the elliptic flow\nincreases by about 30%. Some hydrodynamic model predictions which include\nviscous corrections are in agreement with the observed increase.\n", "  The first measurement of the charged-particle multiplicity density at\nmid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV is presented. For an event sample corresponding\nto the most central 5% of the hadronic cross section the pseudo-rapidity\ndensity of primary charged particles at mid-rapidity is 1584 $\\pm$ 4 (stat)\n$\\pm$ 76 (sys.), which corresponds to 8.3 $\\pm$ 0.4 (sys.) per participating\nnucleon pair. This represents an increase of about a factor 1.9 relative to pp\ncollisions at similar collision energies, and about a factor 2.2 to central\nAu-Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 0.2 TeV. This measurement provides\nthe first experimental constraint for models of nucleus-nucleus collisions at\nLHC energies.\n", "  Inclusive transverse momentum spectra of primary charged particles in Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV have been measured by the ALICE\nCollaboration at the LHC. The data are presented for central and peripheral\ncollisions, corresponding to 0-5% and 70-80% of the hadronic Pb-Pb cross\nsection. The measured charged particle spectra in $|\\eta|<0.8$ and $0.3 < p_T <\n20$ GeV/$c$ are compared to the expectation in pp collisions at the same\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, scaled by the number of underlying nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions. The comparison is expressed in terms of the nuclear modification\nfactor $R_{\\rm AA}$. The result indicates only weak medium effects ($R_{\\rm AA}\n\\approx $ 0.7) in peripheral collisions. In central collisions, $R_{\\rm AA}$\nreaches a minimum of about 0.14 at $p_{\\rm T}=6$-7GeV/$c$ and increases\nsignificantly at larger $p_{\\rm T}$. The measured suppression of high-$p_{\\rm\nT}$ particles is stronger than that observed at lower collision energies,\nindicating that a very dense medium is formed in central Pb-Pb collisions at\nthe LHC.\n", "  The centrality dependence of the charged-particle multiplicity density at\nmid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV is\npresented. The charged-particle density normalized per participating nucleon\npair increases by about a factor 2 from peripheral (70-80%) to central (0-5%)\ncollisions. The centrality dependence is found to be similar to that observed\nat lower collision energies. The data are compared with models based on\ndifferent mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions.\n", "  The first measurement of two-pion Bose-Einstein correlations in central Pb-Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 2.76$ TeV at the Large Hadron Collider is\npresented. We observe a growing trend with energy now not only for the\nlongitudinal and the outward but also for the sideward pion source radius. The\npion homogeneity volume and the decoupling time are significantly larger than\nthose measured at RHIC.\n", "  A comparison is made between the nonlinear rheological response of bulk\nmetallic glass formers and of colloidal dispersions. Stress-strain curves\nmeasured after switch-on of constant deformation rates are analyzed\nquantitatively using a schematic model of mode coupling theory generalized to\nhomogeneous and incompressible flows. A mapping between metallic and dispersion\nrheology is possible when stresses are rescaled by an entropic scale,\naccumulated strains by geometrical factors, and rates by the intrinsic\nrelaxation time. Exploiting this similarity and the possibility to directly\nobserve individual colloidal particles, we investigate the structural\ndistortions in the colloidal system using confocal microscopy. The distortions\nexhibit the (from elasticity theory) expected quadrupolar but also a strong\nisotropic component.\n", "  We contrast the transport properties (dc resistivity, Seebeck coefficient),\noptical conductivity, spectral functions, dynamical magnetic susceptibility,\nand the NMR $1/T_1$ spin-lattice relaxation rate of the repulsive and\nattractive infinite-dimensional Hubbard models in the paramagnetic phase for a\ngeneric band filling. The calculations are performed in a wide temperature\ninterval using the dynamical mean-field theory with the numerical\nrenormalization group as the impurity solver. The attractive case exhibits\nsignificantly more complex temperature dependences which can be explained by\nthe behavior of the half-filled Hubbard model in external magnetic field with\nconstant magnetization, to which the attractive Hubbard model maps through the\npartial particle-hole transformation. The resistivity is non-monotonous for\nstrongly attractive case: it peaks significantly above the MIR value at a\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{max}$ where the quasiparticle band disappears. For both\nsigns of $U$ we find particle-hole asymmetry in the self-energy at low\nenergies, but with the opposite kind of excitations having longer lifetime.\nThis leads to a strong suppression of the slope of the Seebeck coefficient in\nthe attractive case, rather than an enhancement as in the repulsive case. The\nspin-lattice relaxation rate in the strongly attractive case has a\nnon-monotonic temperature dependence, thereby revealing the pairing\nfluctuations.\n", "  Double quantum dot nanostructures embedded between two superconducting leads\nor in a superconducting ring have complex excitation spectra inside the gap\nwhich reveal the competition between different many-body phenomena. We study\nthe corresponding two-impurity Anderson model using the non-perturbative\nnumerical renormalization group (NRG) technique and identify the characteristic\nfeatures in the spectral function in various parameter regimes. At\nhalf-filling, the system always has a singlet ground state. For large\nhybridization, we observe an inversion of excited inter-dot triplet and singlet\nstates due to the level-repulsion between two sub-gap singlet states. The Shiba\ndoublet states split in two cases: a) at non-zero superconducting phase\ndifference and b) away from half-filling. The most complex structure of sub-gap\nstates is found when one or both dots are in the valence fluctuation regime.\nDoublet splitting can lead to a parity-changing quantum phase transition to a\ndoublet ground state in some circumstances. In such cases, we observe very\ndifferent spectral weights for the transitions to singlet or triplet excited\nShiba states: the triplet state is best visible on the valence-fluctuating dot,\nwhile the singlets are more pronounced on the half-filled dot.\n", "  In a recent paper [1] the scattering and transport of excess electrons in\nliquid argon in the hydrodynamic regime was investigated, generalizing the\nseminal works of Lekner and Cohen [2,3] with modern scattering theory\ntechniques and kinetic theory. In this paper, the discussion is extended to the\nnon-hydrodynamic regime through the development of a full multi-term space-time\nsolution of Boltzmann's equation for electron transport in gases and liquids\nusing a novel operator-splitting method. A Green's function formalism is\nconsidered that enables flexible adaptation to various experimental systems.\nThe spatio-temporal evolution of electrons in liquids in the hydrodynamic\nregime is studied for a benchmark model Percus-Yevick liquid as well as for\nliquid argon. The temporal evolution of Franck-Hertz oscillations are observed\nfor liquids, with striking differences in the spatio-temporal development of\nthe velocity distribution function components between the uncorrelated gas and\ntrue liquid approximations in argon. Transport properties calculated from the\nnon-hydrodynamic theory in the long time limit, and under steady-state Townsend\nconditions, are benchmarked against hydrodynamic transport coefficients.\n", "  A class of (1+2)-dimensional diffusion-convection equations (nonlinear\nKolmogorov equations) with time-dependent coefficients is studied with Lie\nsymmetry point of view. The complete group classification is achieved using a\ngauging of arbitrary elements (i.e. via reducing the number of variable\ncoefficients) with the application of equivalence transformations. Two possible\ngaugings are discussed in detail in order to show how equivalence groups serve\nin making the optimal choice.\n", "  The orbital basis is natural when one needs to calculate the effect of local\ninteractions or to unravel the role of orbital physics in the response to\nexternal probes. In systems with nonsymmorphic point groups, such as the\niron-based superconductors, we show that symmetries that emerge in observable\nresponse functions at certain wave vectors are absent from generalized\nsusceptibilities calculated with tight-binding Hamiltonians in the orbital\nbasis. Such symmetries are recovered only when the generalized susceptibilities\nare embeded back to the continuum using appropriate matrix elements between\nbasis states. This is illustrated with the case of LiFeAs and is further\nclarified using a minimal tight-binding Hamiltonian with non-symmorphic space\ngroup.\n", "  It has been shown recently that a specific class of path-dependent stochastic\nprocesses, which reduce their sample space as they unfold, lead to exact\nscaling laws in frequency and rank distributions. Such Sample Space Reducing\nprocesses (SSRP) offer an alternative new mechanism to understand the emergence\nof scaling in countless processes. The corresponding power law exponents were\nshown to be related to noise levels in the process. Here we show that the\nemergence of scaling is not limited to the simplest SSRPs, but holds for a huge\ndomain of stochastic processes that are characterized by non-uniform prior\ndistributions. We demonstrate mathematically that in the absence of noise the\nscaling exponents converge to $-1$ (Zipf's law) for almost all prior\ndistributions. As a consequence it becomes possible to fully understand\ntargeted diffusion on weighted directed networks and its associated scaling\nlaws law in node visit distributions. The presence of cycles can be properly\ninterpreted as playing the same role as noise in SSRPs and, accordingly,\ndetermine the scaling exponents. The result that Zipf's law emerges as a\ngeneric feature of diffusion on networks, regardless of its details, and that\nthe exponent of visiting times is related to the amount of cycles in a network\ncould be relevant for a series of applications in traffic-, transport- and\nsupply chain management.\n", "  We calculate transition amplitudes and cross sections for excitation of\nhydrogen-like atoms by the twisted photon states, or photon states with angular\nmomentum projection on the direction of propagation exceeding $\\hbar$. If the\ntarget atom is located at distances of the order of atomic size near the phase\nsingularity in the vortex center, the transitions rates into the states with\norbital angular momentum $l_f>1$ become comparable with the rates for electric\ndipole transitions. It is shown that when the transition rates are normalized\nto the local photon flux, the resulting cross sections for $l_f>1$ are singular\nnear the optical vortex center. Relation to the \"quantum core\" concept\nintroduced by Berry and Dennis is discussed.\n", "  Two-particle correlations in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon\ncenter-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV are studied as a function of the\npseudorapidity separation (Delta eta) of the particle pair at small relative\nazimuthal angle (abs(Delta phi) < pi/3). The correlations are decomposed into a\njet component that dominates the short-range correlations (abs(Delta eta) < 1),\nand a component that persists at large Delta eta and may originate from\ncollective behavior of the produced system. The events are classified in terms\nof the multiplicity of the produced particles. Finite azimuthal anisotropies\nare observed in high-multiplicity events. The second and third Fourier\ncomponents of the particle-pair azimuthal correlations, V[2] and V[3], are\nextracted after subtraction of the jet component. The single-particle\nanisotropy parameters v[2] and v[3] are normalized by their lab frame\nmid-rapidity value and are studied as a function of eta[cm]. The normalized\nv[2] distribution is found to be asymmetric about eta[cm] = 0, with smaller\nvalues observed at forward pseudorapidity, corresponding to the direction of\nthe proton beam, while no significant pseudorapidity dependence is observed for\nthe normalized v[3] distribution within the statistical uncertainties.\n", "  We systematically investigate the electronic structure and magnetic\nproperties of two dimensional (2D) MPX$_3$ (M= V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn,\nand X = S, Se, Te) transition metal chacogenophosphates to examine their\npotential role as single-layer van der Waals materials that exhibit magnetic\norder. Our {\\em ab initio} calculations predict that most of these single-layer\nmaterials are antiferromagnetic semiconductors. The band gaps of the\nantiferromagnetic states decrease as the atomic number of the chalcogen atom\nincreases (from S to Se, Te), leading in some cases to half-metallic\nferromagnetic states or to non-magnetic metallic states. We find that the phase\ntransition from antiferromagnetic semiconductor to ferromagnetic half-metal can\nbe controlled by gating or by strain engineering. The sensitive interdependence\nwe find between magnetic, structural, and electronic properties establishes the\npotential of this 2D materials class for applications in spintronics.\n", "  We study how the non-Fermi-liquid nature of the overscreened multi-channel\nKondo impurity model affects the response to a BCS pairing term that, in the\nabsence of the impurity, opens a gap $\\Delta$. We find that non-Fermi liquid\nfeatures do persist even at finite $\\Delta$: the local density of states lacks\ncoherence peaks, the states in the continuum above the gap are unconventional,\nand the boundary entropy is a non-monotonic function of temperature. Even more\nsurprisingly, we also find that the low-energy spectrum in the limit $\\Delta\\to\n0$ actually does not correspond to the spectrum strictly at $\\Delta=0$. In\nparticular, the $\\Delta\\to 0$ ground state is an orbitally degenerate\nspin-singlet, while it is an orbital singlet with a residual spin degeneracy at\n$\\Delta=0$. In addition, there are fractionalized spin-1/2 sub-gap excitations\nwhose energy in units of $\\Delta$ tends towards a finite and universal value\nwhen $\\Delta\\to 0$; as if the universality of the anomalous power-law exponents\nthat characterise the overscreened Kondo effect turned into universal energy\nratios when the scale invariance is broken by $\\Delta\\not=0$. This intriguing\nphenomenon can be explained by the renormalisation flow towards the\noverscreened fixed point and the gap cutting off the orthogonality catastrophe\nsingularities.\n", "  The problem of existence of a stable vacuum field in a pure quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) is revised. Our approach is based on using classical\nstationary non-linear wave type solutions with intrinsic mass scale parameter.\nSuch solutions can be treated as quantum mechanical wave functions describing\nmassive spinless states in quantum theory. We verify whether non-linear wave\ntype solutions can form a stable vacuum field background within the framework\nof effective action formalism. We demonstrate that there is a special class of\nstationary generalized Wu-Yang monopole solutions which are stable against\nquantum gluon fluctuations.\n", "  A class of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers (BBMB) equations with\ntime-dependent coefficients is investigated with the Lie symmetry point of\nview. The set of admissible transformations of the class is described\nexhaustively. The complete group classification is performed using the method\nof mapping between classes. The derived Lie symmetries are used to reduce BBMB\nequations to ordinary differential equations. Some exact solutions are\nconstructed.\n", "  We demonstrate that a dispersive imaging technique based on the Faraday\neffect can measure the atom number in a large, ultracold atom cloud with a\nprecision below the atom shot noise level. The minimally destructive character\nof the technique allows us to take multiple images of the same cloud, which\nenables sub-atom shot noise measurement precision of the atom number and allows\nfor an in situ determination of the measurement precision. We have developed a\nnoise model that quantitatively describes the noise contributions due to photon\nshot noise in the detected light and the noise associated with single atom\nloss. This model contains no free parameters and is calculated through an\nanalysis of the fluctuations in the acquired images. For clouds containing $N\n\\sim 5 \\times 10^6$ atoms, we achieve a precision more than a factor of two\nbelow the atom shot noise level.\n", "  We study a two-component Bose gas with a symmetric spin-orbit coupling, and\nfind that two atoms can form a bound state with any intra- or inter-species\nscattering length. Consequently, in the dilute limit, the\nBardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) pairing state of bosons can be formed with\nweakly-attractive inter-species and repulsive intra-species interactions. The\nquasiparticle excitation energies are anisotropic due to spin-orbit coupling.\nThis BCS paring state is energetically favored over Bose-Einstein condensation\n(BEC) of atoms at low densities. As the density increases, there is a\nfirst-order transition from the BCS to BEC states.\n", "  It is shown that the Imry-Ma theorem stating that in space dimensions d<4 the\nintroduction of an arbitrarily small concentration of defects of the \"random\nlocal field\" type in a system with continuous symmetry of the n-component\nvector order parameter (O(n)model) leads to the long-range order collapse and\nto the occurrence of a disordered state, is not true if the anisotropic\ndistribution of the defect-induced random local field directions in the\nn-dimensional space of the order parameter leads to the defect-induced\neffective anisotropy of the \"easy axis\" type. For a weakly anisotropic field\ndistribution, in space dimensions 2<d<4 there exists some critical defect\nconcentration, above which the inhomogeneous Imry-Ma state can exist as an\nequilibrium one. At lower defect concentration the long-range order takes place\nin the system. For a strongly anisotropic field distribution, the Imry-Ma state\nis suppressed completely and the long-range order state takes place at any\ndefect concentration.\n", "  Based on the framework of consistent history theory, the quantum entangled\nhistory was proposed in 2015 and experimentally verified through temporal\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) test with $3$ time nodes in 2016. In this\npaper, we extend the temporal GHZ test to arbitrary time nodes and even system\ndimensions. Then, we define a witness to distinguish between the quantum\nentangled histories and the classical histories. The minimums of the witness\nfor the classical histories are calculated for arbitrary number of time nodes\nand the system dimensions $2$ and $\\infty$. It is found that the minimums of\nthe witness for the classical histories is always larger than the quantum\nentangled histories minimum $-1$. Only when both the number of time nodes and\nsystem dimensions approach to infinity, the minimum of the witness for\nclassical and quantum entangled histories are identical.\n", "  The low energy behavior of a huge variety of one-dimensional interacting\nspinful fermionic systems exhibits spin-charge separation, described in the\ncontinuum limit by two sine-Gordon models decoupled in the charge and spin\nchannels. Interaction is known to induce, besides the gapless Luttinger liquid\nphase, eight possible gapped phases, among which are the Mott, Haldane,\ncharge-/spin-density, and bond-ordered wave insulators, and the Luther Emery\nliquid. Here we prove that some of these physically distinct phases have\nnontrivial topological properties, notably the presence of degenerate protected\nedge modes with fractionalized charge/spin. Moreover, we show that the eight\ngapped phases are in one-to-one correspondence with the symmetry-protected\ntopological (SPT) phases classified by group cohomology theory in the presence\nof particle-hole symmetry P. The latter result is also exploited to\ncharacterize SPT phases by measurable nonlocal order parameters which follow\nthe system evolution to the quantum phase transition. The implications on the\nappearance of exotic orders in the class of microscopic Hubbard Hamiltonians,\npossibly without P symmetry at higher energies, are discussed.\n", "  We study a family of noncommutative spacetimes constructed by one\nfour-vector. The large set of coordinate commutation relations described in\nthis way includes many cases that are widely studied in the literature. The\nHopf-algebra symmetries of these noncommutative spacetimes, as well as the\nstructures of star product and twist, are introduced and considered at first\norder in the deformation, described by four parameters. We also study the\ndeformations to relativistic kinematics implied by this framework, and\ncalculate the most general expression for the momentum dependence of the\nLorentz transformations on momenta, which is an effect that is required by\nconsistency. At the end of the paper we analyse the phenomenological\nconsequences of this large family of vector-like deformations on particles\npropagation in spacetime. This leads to a set of characteristic\nphenomenological effects.\n", "  We present a stability analysis on a driven-dissipative electron-hole\ncondensate in the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC\n(Bose-Einstein-condensation)-crossover region. Extending the combined\nBCS-Leggett theory with the generalized random phase approximation (GRPA) to\nthe non-equilibrium case by employing the Keldysh formalism, we show that the\npumping-and-decay of carriers causes a depairing effect on excitons. This\nphenomenon gives rise to an attractive interaction between excitons in the BEC\nregime, as well as a supercurrent that anomalously flows anti-parallel to\n$\\nabla \\theta({\\bf r})$ (where $\\theta({\\bf r})$ is the phase of the\ncondensate) in the BCS regime, both leading to dynamical instabilities of an\nexciton-BEC. Our result suggests that substantial region of the exciton-BEC\nphase in the phase diagram (in terms of the interaction strength and the decay\nrate) is unstable.\n", "  Coherent caloritronics, the thermal counterpart of coherent electronics, has\ndrawn growing attention since the discovery of heat interference in 2012.\nThermal interferometers, diodes, transistors and nano-valves have been\ntheoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated by exploiting the\nquantum phase difference between two superconductors coupled through a\nJosephson junction. So far, the quantum-phase modulator has been realized in\nthe form of a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) or a\nsuperconducting quantum interference proximity transistor (SQUIPT). Thence, an\nexternal magnetic field is necessary in order to manipulate the heat transport.\nHere, we theoretically propose the first on-chip fully thermal caloritronic\ndevice: the phase-tunable temperature amplifier. Taking advantage of a recent\nthermoelectric effect discovered in spin-split superconductors coupled to a\nspin-polarized system, by a temperature gradient we generate the magnetic flux\ncontrolling the transport through a temperature biased SQUIPT. By employing\ncommonly used materials and a geometry compatible with state-of-the-art\nnano-fabrication techniques, we simulate the behavior of the temperature\namplifier and define a number of figures of merit in full analogy with voltage\namplifiers. Notably, our architecture ensures infinite input thermal impedance,\nmaximum gain of about 11 and efficiency reaching the 95%. This device concept\ncould represent a breakthrough in coherent caloritronic devices, and paves the\nway for applications in radiation sensing, thermal logics and quantum\ninformation.\n", "  Many-particle continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) represent a resource for\nseveral tasks in quantum technology, including quantum search algorithms and\nuniversal quantum computation. In order to design and implement CTQWs in a\nrealistic scenario, one needs effective simulation tools for Hamiltonians that\ntake into account static noise and fluctuations in the lattice, i.e.\nHamiltonians containing stochastic terms. To this aim, we suggest a parallel\nalgorithm based on the Taylor series expansion of the evolution operator, and\ncompare its performances with those of algorithms based on the exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian or a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration. We\nprove that both Taylor-series expansion and Runge-Kutta algorithms are reliable\nand have a low computational cost, the Taylor-series expansion showing the\nadditional advantage of a memory allocation not depending on the precision of\ncalculation. Both algorithms are also highly parallelizable within the SIMT\nparadigm, and are thus suitable for GPGPU computing. In turn, we have\nbenchmarked 4 NVIDIA GPUs and 3 quad-core Intel CPUs for a 2-particle system\nover lattices of increasing dimension, showing that the speedup providend by\nGPU computing, with respect to the OPENMP parallelization, lies in the range\nbetween 8x and (more than) 20x, depending on the frequency of post-processing.\nGPU-accelerated codes thus allow one to overcome concerns about the execution\ntime, and make it possible simulations with many interacting particles on large\nlattices, with the only limit of the memory available on the device.\n", "  Understanding the robustness of topological phases of matter in the presence\nof strong interactions, and synthesising novel strongly-correlated topological\nmaterials, lie among the most important and difficult challenges of modern\ntheoretical and experimental physics. In this work, we present a complete\ntheoretical analysis of the synthetic Creutz-Hubbard ladder, which is a\nparadigmatic model that provides a neat playground to address these challenges.\nWe put special attention to the competition of correlated topological phases\nand orbital quantum magnetism in the regime of strong interactions. These\nresults are furthermore confirmed and extended by extensive numerical\nsimulations. Moreover we propose how to experimentally realize this model in a\nsynthetic ladder, made of two internal states of ultracold fermionic atoms in a\none-dimensional optical lattice. Our work paves the way towards quantum\nsimulators of interacting topological insulators with cold atoms.\n", "  Precise estimation of spin Hall angle as well as successful maximization of\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) form a basis of electronic control of magnetic\nproperties with spintronic functionality. Until now, current-nonlinear Hall\neffect, or second harmonic Hall voltage has been utilized as one of the methods\nfor estimating spin Hall angle, which is attributed to the magnetization\noscillation by SOT. Here, we argue the second harmonic Hall voltage in\nmagnetic/nonmagnetic topological insulator (TI) heterostructures,\nCr$_x$(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_{2-x}$Te$_3$/(Bi$_{1-y}$Sb$_y$)$_2$Te$_3$. From the\nangular, temperature and magnetic field dependence, it is unambiguously shown\nthat the large second harmonic Hall voltage in TI heterostructures is governed\nnot by SOT but mainly by asymmetric magnon scattering mechanism without\nmagnetization oscillation. Thus, this method does not allow an accurate\nestimation of spin Hall angle when magnons largely contribute to electron\nscattering. Instead, the SOT contribution in a TI heterostructure is\nexemplified by current pulse induced non-volatile magnetization switching,\nwhich is realized with a current density of $\\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{10}\n\\mathrm{A/m}^2$, showing its potential as spintronic materials.\n", "  Understanding the magnetic response of the normal state of the cuprates is\nconsidered a key piece in solving the puzzle of their high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. The essential physics of these materials is believed to be\ncaptured by the Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal model that has been realized\nwith cold atoms in optical lattices. Here we report on site-resolved\nmeasurements of the Fermi-Hubbard model in a spin-imbalanced atomic gas,\nallowing us to explore the response of the system to large effective magnetic\nfields. We observe short-range canted antiferromagnetism at half-filling with\nstronger spin correlations in the direction orthogonal to the magnetization, in\ncontrast with the spin-balanced case where identical correlations are measured\nfor any projection of the pseudospin. The rotational anisotropy of the spin\ncorrelators is found to increase with polarization and with distance between\nthe spins. Away from half-filling, the polarization of the gas exhibits\nnon-monotonic behavior with doping for strong interactions, resembling the\nbehavior of the magnetic susceptibility in the cuprates. We compare our\nmeasurements to predictions from Determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and\nNumerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) algorithms and find good agreement.\nCalculations on the doped system are near the limits of these techniques,\nillustrating the value of cold atom quantum simulations for studying\nstrongly-correlated materials.\n", "  The Hilbert series is a generating function that enumerates gauge invariant\nchiral operators of a supersymmetric field theory with four supercharges and an\nR-symmetry. In this article I review how counting dressed 't Hooft monopole\noperators leads to a formula for the Hilbert series of a 3d $\\mathcal{N}\\geq 2$\ngauge theory, which captures precious information about the chiral ring and the\nmoduli space of supersymmetric vacua of the theory.\n", "  Recent work in CT imaging has seen increased interest in the use of total\nvariation (TV) and related penalties to regularize problems involving\nreconstruction from undersampled or incomplete data. Superiorization is a\nrecently proposed heuristic which provides an automatic procedure to\n\"superiorize\" an iterative reconstruction algorithm with respect to a chosen\nobjective function, such as TV. Under certain conditions, the superiorized\nalgorithm is guaranteed to find a solution that is as satisfactory as any found\nby the original algorithm with respect to satisfying the constraints of the\nproblem; this solution is also expected to be superior with respect to the\nchosen objective.\n  Most work on superiorization has used reconstruction algorithms which assume\na linear measurement model, which in the case of CT corresponds to data\ngenerated from a monoenergetic X-ray beam. Many CT systems generate X-rays from\na polyenergetic spectrum, however, in which the measured data represent an\nintegral of object attenuation over all energies in the spectrum. This\ninconsistency with the linear model produces the well-known beam hardening\nartifacts, which impair analysis of CT images.\n  In this work we superiorize an iterative algorithm for reconstruction from\npolyenergetic data, using both TV and an anisotropic TV (ATV) penalty. We apply\nthe superiorized algorithm in numerical phantom experiments modeling both\nsparse-view and limited-angle scenarios. In our experiments, the superiorized\nalgorithm successfully finds solutions which are as constraints-compatible as\nthose found by the original algorithm, with significantly reduced TV and ATV\nvalues. The superiorized algorithm thus produces images with greatly reduced\nsparse-view and limited angle artifacts, which are also largely free of the\nbeam hardening artifacts that would be present if a superiorized version of a\nmonoenergetic algorithm were used.\n", "  Understanding the retention of hydrogen isotopes in liquid metals, such as\nlithium and tin, is of great importance in designing a liquid plasma-facing\ncomponent in fusion reactors. However, experimental diffusivity data of\nhydrogen isotopes in liquid metals are still limited or controversial. We\nemploy first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to predict diffusion\ncoefficients of deuterium in liquid tin at temperatures ranging from 573 to\n1673 K. Our simulations indicate faster diffusion of deuterium in liquid tin\nthan the self-diffusivity of tin. In addition, we find that the structural and\ndynamic properties of tin are insensitive to the inserted deuterium at\ntemperatures and concentrations considered. We also observe that tin and\ndeuterium do not form stable solid compounds. These predicted results from\nsimulations enable us to have a better understanding of the retention of\nhydrogen isotopes in liquid tin.\n", "  Energy or quasienergy (QE) band spectra depending on two parameters may have\na nontrivial topological characterization by Chern integers. Band spectra of 1D\nsystems that are spanned by just one parameter, a Bloch phase, are\ntopologically trivial. Recently, an ensemble of 1D Floquet systems, double\nkicked rotors (DKRs) depending on an external parameter, has been studied. It\nwas shown that a QE band spanned by both the Bloch phase and the external\nparameter is characterized by a Chern integer, which determines the change in\nthe mean angular momentum of a state in a band when the external parameter is\nadiabatically varied by a natural period. We show here, under conditions much\nmore general than in previous works, that the ensemble of DKRs for all values\nof the external parameter is fully described by a system having translational\ninvariance on the phase plane. This system can be characterized by a\n\\emph{second} Chern integer which is shown to be connected with the integer\nabove for the DKR ensemble. This connection is expressed by a Diophantine\nequation (DE) which we derive. The DE, involving the number of QE bands and the\ndegeneracy of the QE states of the phase-plane system, limits the values of the\nDKR-ensemble integer. In particular, this integer is generically nonzero,\nshowing the general topological nontriviality of the DKR ensemble.\n", "  The analysis of the entanglement entropy of a subsystem of a one-dimensional\nquantum system is a powerful tool for unravelling its critical nature. For\ninstance, the scaling behaviour of the entanglement entropy determines the\ncentral charge of the associated Virasoro algebra. For a free fermion system,\nthe entanglement entropy depends essentially on two sets, namely the set $A$ of\nsites of the subsystem considered and the set $K$ of excited momentum modes. In\nthis work we make use of a general duality principle establishing the\ninvariance of the entanglement entropy under exchange of the sets $A$ and $K$\nto tackle complex problems by studying their dual counterparts. The duality\nprinciple is also a key ingredient in the formulation of a novel conjecture for\nthe asymptotic behavior of the entanglement entropy of a free fermion system in\nthe general case in which both sets $A$ and $K$ consist of an arbitrary number\nof blocks. We have verified that this conjecture reproduces the numerical\nresults with excellent precision for all the configurations analyzed. We have\nalso applied the conjecture to deduce several asymptotic formulas for the\nmutual and $r$-partite information generalizing the known ones for the single\nblock case.\n", "  In precision metrology the determination of the Newtonian gravity constant\n$G$ represents a real problem, since its history is plagued by huge unknown\ndiscrepancies between a large number of independent experiments. In this paper\nwe propose a novel experimental setup for measuring $G$ with a relative\naccuracy of $10^{-5}$ using a standard cold atomic fountain and matter wave\ninterferometry. We discuss in details the major sources of systematic errors,\nproviding also the expected statistical uncertainty. Feasibility of determining\n$G$ at a level of $10^{-6}$ level is also discussed.\n", "  We propose a simple formula for the 4d-2d partition function of half-BPS\nsurface defects in $d=4,\\ \\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories:\n$Z^{\\text{4d-2d}}=\\langle Z^{\\text{2d}} \\rangle_{\\text{4d}}$. Our results are\napplicable for any surface defect obtained by gauging a 2d flavour symmetry\nusing a 4d gauge group. For defects obtained via the Higgsing procedure, our\nformula reproduces the recent calculation by Pan and Peelaers. For Gukov-Witten\ndefects our results reproduce the orbifold calculation by Kanno and Tachikawa.\nWe emphasize the role of \"negative vortices\" which are realized as negative D0\nbranes.\n", "  Quantum coherence, which quantifies the superposition properties of a quantum\nstate, plays an indispensable role in quantum resource theory. A recent\ntheoretical work [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{116}, 070402 (2016)] studied the\nmanipulation of quantum coherence in bipartite or multipartite systems under\nthe protocol Local Incoherent Operation and Classical Communication (LQICC).\nHere we present the first experimental realization of obtaining maximal\ncoherence in assisted distillation protocol based on linear optical system. The\nresults of our work show that the optimal distillable coherence rate can be\nreached even in one-copy scenario when the overall bipartite qubit state is\npure. Moreover, the experiments for mixed states showed that distillable\ncoherence can be increased with less demand than entanglement distillation. Our\nwork might be helpful in the remote quantum information processing and quantum\ncontrol.\n", "  The Imbert-Fedorov (IF) shift in optics describes the transverse shift of\nlight beams at the reflection interface. Recently, the IF shift of Weyl\nfermions at the interface between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) with single monopole\ncharge has been studied. Here, we study the IF shift at the interface between\ntwo WSMs, each of which is carrying an arbitrary integer monopole charge. We\nfind a general relation between the monopole charges of the two WSMs and the IF\nshift. In particular, the IF shift is proportional to the monopole charge if\nboth WSMs have the same one. Our results can be used to infer the topology of\nthe materials by experimentally measuring their IF shift. Furthermore, we\nconsider the possibility that the Weyl fermions are scattered to other Weyl\ncones during the reflection, which results in qualitatively different behavior\nof the IF shift. While we use a quantum mechanical approach to solve the\nproblem, semiclassical equations of motion and the conservation of total\nangular momentum can help us intuitively interpret our results in special\ncases.\n", "  In the complex 3D magnetic fields of stellarators, ion-temperature-gradient\nturbulence is shown to have two distinct saturation regimes, as revealed by\npetascale numerical simulations, and explained by a simple turbulence theory.\nThe first regime is marked by strong zonal flows, and matches previous\nobservations in tokamaks. The newly observed second regime, in contrast,\nexhibits small- scale quasi-two-dimensional turbulence, negligible zonal flows,\nand, surprisingly, a weaker heat flux scaling. Our findings suggest that key\ndetails of the magnetic geometry control turbulence in stellarators.\n", "  It is argued that many of the problems and ambiguities of standard cosmology\nderive from a single one: violation of conservation of energy in the standard\nparadigm. Standard cosmology satisfies conservation of local energy, however\ndisregards the inherent global aspect of energy. We therefore explore\nconservation of the quasi-local Misner-Sharp energy within the causal horizon,\nwhich, as we argue, is necessarily an apparent horizon. Misner-Sharp energy\nassumes the presence of arbitrary mass-energy. Its conservation, however,\nyields \"empty\" de Sitter (open, flat, closed) as single cosmological solution,\nwhere Misner-Sharp total energy acts as cosmological constant and where the\nsource of curvature energy is unidentified. It is argued that de Sitter is only\napparently empty of matter. That is, total matter energy scales as curvature\nenergy in open de Sitter, which causes evolution of the cosmic potential and\ninduces gravitational time dilation. Curvature of time accounts completely for\nthe extrinsic curvature, i.e., renders open de Sitter spatially flat. This\nexplains the well known, surprising, spatial flatness of Misner-Sharp energy,\neven if extrinsic curvature is non-zero. The general relativistic derivation\nfrom Misner-Sharp energy is confirmed by a Machian equation of recessional and\npeculiar energy, which explicitly assumes the presence of matter. This\nrelational model enhances interpretation. Time-dilated open de Sitter is\nspatially flat, dynamically close to $\\Lambda$CDM, and is shown to be without\nthe conceptual problems of concordance cosmology.\n", "  We study the vector and axial-vector current correlators in perturbative and\nnon-perturbative regimes of QCD. The correlators in Euclidean coordinate space\nare calculated on the lattice using the M\\\"obius domain-wall fermion\nformulation at three lattice spacings covering 0.044--0.080~fm. The dynamical\nquark effects of $2+1$ light flavors are included. The sum $V+A$ and the\ndifference $V-A$ of the vector ($V$) and axial-vector ($A$) current correlators\ncalculated on the lattice after extrapolating to the physical point agree with\nthose converted from the ALEPH experimental data of hadronic $\\tau$ decays. The\nlevel of the agreement in the $V+A$ channel is about $1.3\\sigma$ or smaller in\nthe region of $|x|\\ge0.4$~fm, while that in the $V-A$ channel is about\n$1.8\\sigma$ at $|x|=0.74$~fm and smaller at other distances. We also extract\nthe hiral condensate from the short-distance correlators on the lattice using\nthe PCAC relation. Its result extrapolated to the chiral and continuum limit is\ncompatible with other estimates at low energies.\n", "  Skyrmions are nanometric spin whirls that can be stabilized in magnets\nlacking inversion symmetry. The properties of isolated skyrmions embedded in a\nferromagnetic background have been intensively studied. We show that single\nskyrmions and clusters of skyrmions can also form in the helical phase and\ninvestigate theoretically their energetics and dynamics. The helical background\nprovides natural one-dimensional channels along which a skyrmion can move\nrapidly. In contrast to skyrmions in ferromagnets, the skymion-skyrmion\ninteraction has a strong attractive component and thus skyrmions tend to form\nclusters with characteristic shapes. These clusters are directly observed in\ntransmission electron microscopy measurements in thin films of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$.\nTopological quantization, high mobility and the confinement of skyrmions in\nchannels provided by the helical background may be useful for future\nspintronics devices.\n", "  We apply the nonlinear reconstruction method to simulated halo fields. For\nhalo number density $2.77\\times 10^{-2}$ $(h^{-1} {\\rm Mpc})^{-3}$ at $z=0$,\ncorresponding to the SDSS main sample density, we find the scale where the\nnoise saturates the linear signal is improved to $k\\gtrsim0.36\\ h {\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$, a factor of $2.29$ improvement in scale, or $12$ in number of\nlinear modes. The improvement is less for higher redshift or lower halo\ndensity. We expect this to substantially improve the BAO accuracy of dense, low\nredshift surveys, including the SDSS main sample, 6dFGS and 21cm intensity\nmapping initiatives.\n", "  Following our earlier finding based on RHIC data on the dominant jet\nproduction from nucleus corona region, we reconsider this effect in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions at LHC energy. Our hypothesis was based on\nexperimental data, which raised the idea of a finite formation time for the\nproduced medium. At RHIC energy and in low density corona region this time\nreaches about 2 fm/c. All observed high p_t particles are produced in the\ncorona region and have a chance to escape during this 2 fm/c. After that, the\nformed high density matter absorbs all jets. Following this hypothesis, the\nnuclear modification factor R_{AA} should be independent on particle momentum\nand be flat versus p_t. At the same time, we describe the finite azimuthal\nanisotropy of high p_t particles, v_2. A separate prediction held that, at LHC\nenergy, the formation time in the corona region should be two times smaller,\nabout 1 fm/c. New data at LHC show that R_{AA} is not flat and is rising with\np_t. We add to our original hypothesis an assumption that a fast parton\ntraversing the produced medium loses the fixed portion of its energy. A shift\nof about 7 GeV (I would call it as a parton binding energy) from the original\npower law p^{-6} production cross section in pp explains well all the observed\nR_{AA} dependencies. The shift of about 7 GeV is also valid at RHIC energy,\nwhere the cross section follows a power law with about p^{-8} and this shift\nexplains a very slow rise of R_{AA} seen for neutral pions with p_t above 15\nGeV/c. We also show that the observed at LHC dependence of v_2 at high p_t and\nour previous predictions agree.\n", "  General relativistic imprints on the galaxy bispectrum arise from\nobservational (or projection) effects. The lightcone projection effects include\nlocal contributions from Doppler and gravitational potential terms, as well as\nlensing and other integrated contributions. We recently presented for the first\ntime, the correction to the galaxy bispectrum from all local lightcone\nprojection effects up to second order in perturbations. Here we provide the\ndetails underlying this correction, together with further results and\nillustrations. For moderately squeezed shapes, the correction to the Newtonian\nprediction is ~30% on equality scales at z ~ 1. We generalise our recent\nresults to include the contribution, up to second order, of magnification bias\n(which affects some of the local terms) and evolution bias.\n", "  Numerous few-electron atomic systems are considered which can be used\neffectively for observing a potential variation of the fine-structure constant\n$\\alpha$ and the electron-proton mass ratio $m_e/m_p$. We examine optical\nmagnetic dipole transitions between hyperfine-structure components in heavy\nhighly charged H-like and Li-like ions with observably high sensitivity to a\nvariation of $\\alpha$ and $m_e/m_p$. The experimental spectra of the proposed\nsystems consist of a strong single line, which simplifies significantly the\ndata analysis and shortens the necessary measurement time. Furthermore, we\npropose systems for an experimental test of the variation of quark masses and\ndiscuss the expected level of accuracy in assessing its limitations. Finally,\nwe establish which constraints on the variation of these fundamental constants\ncould be provided by measurements with a hyperfine-structure highly-charged-ion\nclock and some reference clock, showing that a significant improvement of the\ncurrent limitations can be reached.\n", "  Sample Space Reducing (SSR) processes are simple stochastic processes that\noffer a new route to understand scaling in path-dependent processes. Here we\ndefine a cascading process that generalises the recently defined SSR processes\nand is able to produce power laws with arbitrary exponents. We demonstrate\nanalytically that the frequency distributions of states are power laws with\nexponents that coincide with the multiplication parameter of the cascading\nprocess. In addition, we show that imposing energy conservation in SSR cascades\nallows us to recover Fermi's classic result on the energy spectrum of cosmic\nrays, with the universal exponent -2, which is independent of the\nmultiplication parameter of the cascade. Applications of the proposed process\ninclude fragmentation processes or directed cascading diffusion on networks,\nsuch as rumour or epidemic spreading.\n", "  Producing inward orientated streams of energetic electrons by intense laser\npulses acting on solid targets is the most robust and accessible way of\ntransferring the laser energy to particles, which underlies numerous\napplications, ranging from TNSA to laboratory astrophysics. Structures with the\nscale of the laser wavelength can significantly enhance energy absorption,\nwhich has been in the center of attention in recent studies. In this article,\nwe demonstrate and assess the effect of the structures for widening the angular\ndistribution of generated energetic electrons. We analyse the results of PIC\nsimulations and reveal several aspects that can be important for the related\napplications.\n", "  The existence of intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs) is an open problem in\ncosmology and has never been unambiguously confirmed. High-energy gamma rays\nemitted by blazars are unique probes of cosmic magnetism, as their interactions\nwith pervasive radiation fields generate a short-lived charged component\nsensitive to intervening magnetic fields. Spatial and temporal properties of\nthe secondary gamma rays generated in the electromagnetic cascade can provide\ninformation about the strength, power spectrum, and topology of IGMFs. To probe\nthese fields, detailed simulations of gamma-ray propagation in the\nintergalactic medium are necessary. In this work the effects of magnetic fields\non the spectrum and arrival directions of gamma rays are studied using\nthree-dimensional simulations, emphasising the particular case of helical\nIGMFs.\n", "  After a short review of microscopic electrodynamics in materials, we\ninvestigate the relation of the microscopic dielectric tensor to the current\nresponse tensor and to the full electromagnetic Green function. Subsequently,\nwe give a systematic overview of microscopic electromagnetic wave equations in\nmaterials, which can be formulated in terms of the microscopic dielectric\ntensor.\n", "  We calculate the circular dichroism (CD) for absorption of the twisted\nphotons, or optical vortices, by atoms, caused by atomic excitation into\ndiscrete energy levels. The effects of photon spin on the rates and cross\nsections of atomic photo-excitation are considered. It is demonstrated that\nalthough for electric dipole transitions the atomic excitation rates depend on\nthe relative orientation of photon spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM), the\nresulting CD is zero. However, CD is nonzero for atomic transitions of higher\nmultipolarity, peaking in the optical vortex center, resulting in preferred\nabsorption of the photons with their spins aligned with OAM. The effects remain\nlarge in a paraxial limit, where analytic expressions are provided. The\npredicted spin asymmetries are equivalent to OAM dichroism for the fixed photon\nspin.\n", "  The \"gravitational memory effect\" due to an exact plane wave provides us with\nan elementary description of the diffeomorphisms associated with soft\ngravitons. It is explained how the presence of the latter may be detected by\nobserving the motion of freely falling particles or other forms of\ngravitational wave detection. Numerical calculations confirm the relevance of\nthe first, second and third time integrals of the Riemann tensor pointed out\nearlier. Solutions for various profiles are constructed. It is also shown how\nto extend our treatment to Einstein-Maxwell plane waves and a midi-superspace\nquantization is given.\n", "  We study entanglement entropy and the free energy in recently constructed\nholographic duals for 5d SCFTs in type IIB supergravity. The solutions exhibit\nmild singularities, which could potentially complicate holographic\napplications. We use the relation of the entanglement entropy for a spherical\nentangling surface to the free energy of the field theory on the five sphere as\na well-motivated benchmark to assess how problematic the singularities are. The\nholographic supergravity computations give well-defined results for both\nquantities and they satisfy the expected relations. This supports the\ninterpretation of the solutions as holographic duals for 5d SCFTs and gives\nfirst quantitative indications for the nature of the dual SCFTs.\n", "  Plasmons, the collective excitations of electrons in the bulk or at the\nsurface, play an important role in the properties of materials, and have\ngenerated the field of Plasmonics. We report the observation of a highly\nunusual acoustic plasmon mode on the surface of a three-dimensional topological\ninsulator (TI), Bi2Se3, using momentum resolved inelastic electron scattering.\nIn sharp contrast to ordinary plasmon modes, this mode exhibits almost linear\ndispersion into the second Brillouin zone and remains prominent with remarkably\nweak damping not seen in any other systems. This behavior must be associated\nwith the inherent robustness of the electrons in the TI surface state, so that\nnot only the surface Dirac states but also their collective excitations are\ntopologically protected. On the other hand, this mode has much smaller energy\ndispersion than expected from a continuous media excitation picture, which can\nbe attributed to the strong coupling with surface phonons.\n", "  The effects of finite particle number sampling on the net baryon number\ncumulants, extracted from fluid dynamical simulations, are studied. The\ncommonly used finite particle number sampling procedure introduces an\nadditional Poissonian (or multinomial if global baryon number conservation is\nenforced) contribution which increases the extracted moments of the baryon\nnumber distribution. If this procedure is applied to a fluctuating fluid\ndynamics framework one severely overestimates the actual cumulants. We show\nthat the sampling of so called test-particles suppresses the additional\ncontribution to the moments by at least one power of the number of\ntest-particles. We demonstrate this method in a numerical fluid dynamics\nsimulation that includes the effects of spinodal decomposition due to a first\norder phase transition. Furthermore, in the limit where anti-baryons can be\nignored, we derive analytic formulas which capture exactly the effect of\nparticle sampling on the baryon number cumulants. These formulas may be used to\ntest the various numerical particle sampling algorithms.\n", "  Based on the first-principles calculations, we investigated the ferroelectric\nproperties of two-dimensional (2D) Group-IV tellurides XTe (X=Si, Ge and Sn),\nwith a focus on GeTe. 2D Group-IV tellurides energetically prefer an\northorhombic phase with a hinge-like structure and an in-plane spontaneous\npolarization. The intrinsic Curie temperature Tc of monolayer GeTe is as high\nas 570 K and can be raised quickly by applying a tensile strain. An\nout-of-plane electric field can effectively decrease the coercive field for the\nreversal of polarization, extending its potential for regulating the\npolarization switching kinetics. Moreover, for bilayer GeTe the ferroelectric\nphase is still the ground state. Combined with these advantages, 2D GeTe is a\npromising candidate material for practical integrated ferroelectric\napplications.\n", "  We suggest a Lorentz non-invariant generalization of the unimodular gravity\ntheory, which is classically equivalent to general relativity with a locally\ninert (devoid of local degrees of freedom) perfect fluid having an equation of\nstate with a constant parameter $w$. For the range of $w$ near $-1$ this dark\nfluid can play the role of dark energy, while for $w=0$ this dark dust admits\nspatial inhomogeneities and can be interpreted as dark matter. We discuss\npossible implications of this model in the cosmological initial conditions\nproblem. In particular, this is the extension of known microcanonical density\nmatrix predictions for the initial quantum state of the closed cosmology to the\ncase of spatially open Universe, based on the imitation of the spatial\ncurvature by the dark fluid density. We also briefly discuss quantization of\nthis model necessarily involving the method of gauge systems with reducible\nconstraints and the effect of this method on the treatment of recently\nsuggested mechanism of vacuum energy sequestering.\n", "  We fabricated an acousto-optic semiconductor hybrid device for strong\noptomechanical coupling of individual quantum emitters and a surface acoustic\nwave. Our device comprises a surface acoustic wave chip made from highly\npiezoelectric LiNbO$_3$ and a GaAs-based semiconductor membrane with an\nembedded layer of quantum dots. Employing multi-harmonic transducers, we\ngenerated sound waves on LiNbO$_3$ over a wide range of radio frequencies. We\nmonitored their coupling to and propagation across the semiconductor membrane\nboth in the electrical and optical domain. We demonstrate enhanced\noptomechanical tuning of the embedded quantum dots with increasing frequencies.\nThis effect was verified by finite element modelling of our device geometry and\nattributed to an increased localization of the acoustic field within the\nsemiconductor membrane. For moderately high acoustic frequencies, our\nsimulations predict strong optomechanical coupling making our hybrid device\nideally suited for applications in semiconductor based quantum acoustics.\n", "  We study the renormalization group evolution (RGE) of new physics\ncontributions to (semi)leptonic charged-current meson decays, focusing on\noperators involving a chirality flip at the quark level. We calculate their\nevolution under electroweak and electromagnetic interactions, including also\nthe three-loop QCD running and provide numerical formulas that allow us to\nconnect the values of the corresponding Wilson coefficients from scales at the\nTeV to the low-energy scales. The large mixing of the tensor operator into the\n(pseudo)scalar ones has important phenomenological implications, such as the\nRGE of new physics bounds obtained from light quark decays or in $b\\to\nc\\ell\\nu$ transitions. For instance, we study scenarios involving tensor\neffective operators, which have been proposed in the literature to address the\n$B$-decay anomalies, most notably those concerning the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ ratios. We\nconclude that the loop effects are important and should be taken into account\nin the analysis of these processes, especially if the operators are generated\nat an energy scale of $\\sim 1$ TeV or higher.\n", "  We explore non-adiabatic particle production for $N_{\\rm f}$ coupled scalar\nfields in a time-dependent background with stochastically varying effective\nmasses, cross-couplings and intervals between interactions. Under the\nassumption of weak scattering per interaction, we provide a framework for\ncalculating the typical particle production rates after a large number of\ninteractions. After setting up the framework, for analytic tractability, we\nconsider interactions (effective masses and cross couplings) characterized by\nseries of Dirac-delta functions in time with amplitudes and locations drawn\nfrom different distributions. Without assuming that the fields are\nstatistically equivalent, we present closed form results (up to quadratures)\nfor the asymptotic particle production rates for the $N_{\\rm f}=1$ and $N_{\\rm\nf}=2$ cases. We also present results for the general $N_{\\rm f} >2$ case, but\nwith more restrictive assumptions. We find agreement between our analytic\nresults and direct numerical calculations of the total occupation number of the\nproduced particles, with departures that can be explained in terms of violation\nof our assumptions.\n  We elucidate the precise connection between the maximum entropy ansatz (MEA)\nused in Amin & Baumann (2015) and the underlying statistical distribution of\nthe self and cross couplings. We provide and justify a simple to use\n(MEA-inspired) expression for the particle production rate, which agrees with\nour more detailed treatment when the parameters characterizing the effective\nmass and cross-couplings between fields are all comparable to each other.\nHowever, deviations are seen when some parameters differ significantly from\nothers. We show that such deviations become negligible for a broad range of\nparameters when $N_{\\rm f}\\gg 1$.\n", "  Using a model-independent low-energy effective field theory, we calculate the\nfree energy of three-dimensional antiferromagnets in a combination of mutually\nperpendicular external magnetic and staggered fields at the\nnext-to-next-to-leading, two-loop order. Renormalization is carried out\nanalytically, and the renormalization group invariance of the result is checked\nexplicitly. The free energy is thus expressed solely in terms of temperature,\nthe external fields, and a set of low-energy coupling constants, to be\ndetermined by experiment or by matching to the microscopic model of a given\nconcrete material.\n", "  We present a method for the exact diagonalization of the $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$\nHeisenberg interaction Hamiltonian, using Young tableaux to work directly in\neach irreducible representation of the global $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ group. This\ngeneralized scheme is applicable to chains consisting of several particles per\nsite, with any $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ symmetry at each site. Extending some of the\nkey results of substitutional analysis, we demonstrate how basis states can be\nefficiently constructed for the relevant $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$ subsector, which,\nespecially with increasing values of $N$ or numbers of sites, has a much\nsmaller dimension than the full Hilbert space. This allows us to analyze\nsystems of larger sizes than can be handled by existing techniques. We apply\nthis method to investigate the presence of edge states in $\\mathrm{SU}(N)$\nHeisenberg and AKLT Hamiltonians.\n", "  We consider the effective field theory (EFT) treatment of two-body systems\nwith narrow resonances. Within this approach, an $s$-wave scattering amplitude\ncan be expanded in powers of a typical momentum scale of a system $Q\\ll\n\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ represents a hard scale of a scattering system and an\nenergy difference $\\delta \\epsilon=|E-\\epsilon_0|\\ll \\epsilon_0$, where\n$\\epsilon_0$ is a resonance peak energy. It is shown that at leading order in\nthe double expansion a universal form of a two-body scattering amplitude is a\nsum of a Breit-Wigner term of order $Q^{-1}$, a smooth background term of order\n$Q^0$, and an interference term of order $Q^0$. The techniques developed in\nthis paper can be used to investigate the properties of narrow resonances that\nare produced by short-distance dynamics.\n", "  In this paper we consider the hyperbolic formulation of the constraints\nintroduced by R\\'acz. Using the numerical framework recently developed by us we\nconstruct initial data sets which can be interpreted as nonlinear perturbations\nof Schwarzschild data in Kerr-Schild coordinates and investigate their\nasymptotics. Our results suggest that, unless one finds a way to exploit the\nfreedom to pick the free part of the initial data in some suitable way, generic\ninitial data sets obtained by this method may violate fundamental asymptotic\nconditions.\n", "  We discuss a parameter-free and computationally efficient ab initio\nsimulation approach for moderately and strongly correlated materials, the\nmultitier self-consistent $GW$+EDMFT method. This scheme treats different\ndegrees of freedom, such as high-energy and low-energy bands, or local and\nnonlocal interactions, within appropriate levels of approximation, and provides\na fully self-consistent description of correlation and screening effects in the\nsolid. The ab initio input is provided by a one-shot $G^0W^0$ calculation,\nwhile the strong-correlation effects originating from narrow bands near the\nFermi level are captured by a combined $GW$ plus extended dynamical mean-field\n(EDMFT) treatment. We present the formalism and technical details of our\nimplementation and discuss some general properties of the effective EDMFT\nimpurity action. In particular, we show that the retarded impurity interactions\ncan have non-causal features, while the physical observables, such as the\nscreened interactions of the lattice system, remain causal. We then turn to\nstretched sodium as a model system to explore the performance of the multitier\nself-consistent $GW$+EDMFT method in situations with different degrees of\ncorrelation. While the results for the physical lattice spacing $a_0$ show that\nthe scheme is not very accurate for electron-gas like systems, because nonlocal\ncorrections beyond $GW$ are important, it does provide physically correct\nresults in the intermediate correlation regime, and a Mott transition around a\nlattice spacing of $1.5a_0$. Remarkably, even though the Wannier functions in\nthe stretched compound are less localized, and hence the bare interaction\nparameters are reduced, the self-consistently computed impurity interactions\nshow the physically expected trend of an increasing interaction strength with\nincreasing lattice spacing.\n", "  An unstable quantum state generally decays following an exponential law, as\nenvironmental decoherence is expected to prevent the decay products from\nrecombining to reconstruct the initial state. Here we show the existence of\ndeviations from exponential decay in open quantum systems under very general\nconditions. Our results are illustrated with the exact dynamics under quantum\nBrownian motion and suggest an explanation of recent experimental observations.\n", "  We study a one-dimensional system that includes both a commensurate\noff-diagonal modulation of the hopping amplitude and an incommensurate, slowly\nvarying diagonal on-site modulation. By using asymptotic heuristic arguments,\nwe identify four closed form expressions for the mobility edges. We further\nstudy numerically the inverse participation ratio, the density of states and\nthe Lyapunov exponent. The numerical results are in exact agreement with our\ntheoretical predictions. Besides a metal-insulator transition driven by the\nstrength of the slowly varying potential, another four insulator-metal\ntransitions are found in this model as the energy is increased in magnitude\nfrom the band center ($E =0$) to the mobility edges ($\\pm E_{c2}, \\pm E_{c1}$).\n", "  We explore a new class of supersymmetric models for lepton masses and mixing\nangles where the role of flavour symmetry is played by modular invariance. The\nbuilding blocks are modular forms of level N and matter supermultiplets, both\ntransforming in representations of a finite discrete group Gamma_N. In the\nsimplest version of these models, Yukawa couplings are just modular forms and\nthe only source of flavour symmetry breaking is the vacuum expectation value of\na single complex field, the modulus. In the special case where modular forms\nare constant functions the whole construction collapses to a supersymmetric\nflavour model invariant under Gamma_N, the case treated so far in the\nliterature. The framework has a number of appealing features. Flavon fields\nother than the modulus might not be needed. Neutrino masses and mixing angles\nare simultaneously constrained by the modular symmetry. As long as\nsupersymmetry is exact, modular invariance determines all higher-dimensional\noperators in the superpotential. We discuss the general framework and we\nprovide complete examples of the new construction. The most economical model\npredicts neutrino mass ratios, lepton mixing angles, Dirac and Majorana phases\nuniquely in terms of the modulus vacuum expectation value, with all the\nparameters except one within the experimentally allowed range. As a byproduct\nof the general formalism we extend the notion of non-linearly realised\nsymmetries to the discrete case.\n", "  Leptogenesis is an appealing framework to account for the baryon asymmetry in\nthe universe. To this end physics beyond the Standard Model is demanded. In\nthis paper we investigate the possibility to attain successful leptogenesis\nwith composite Majorana neutrinos. We work in the framework of effective gauge\nmediated and contact interactions without any reference to an underlying\ncompositeness theory. This approach is the one adopted in all current\nexperimental searches for composite fermions at colliders. In the case of gauge\nmediated interactions, we calculate the CP asymmetry in heavy composite\nneutrino decays. Both the direct and indirect CP asymmetry are derived and\nresonant leptogenesis is also discussed. We find that the Sakharov conditions\ncan be met and, for some choice of the parameters, the correct order of\nmagnitude of the baryon asymmetry is reproduced.\n", "  Anti-Hermitian mass terms are considered, in addition to Hermitian ones, for\nPT-symmetric complex-scalar and fermionic field theories. In both cases, the\nLagrangian can be written in a manifestly symmetric form in terms of the\nPT-conjugate variables, allowing for an unambiguous definition of the equations\nof motion. After discussing the resulting constraints on the consistency of the\nvariational procedure, we show that the invariance of a non-Hermitian\nLagrangian under a continuous symmetry transformation does not imply the\nexistence of a corresponding conserved current. Conserved currents exist, but\nthese are associated with transformations under which the Lagrangian is not\ninvariant and which reflect the well-known interpretation of PT-symmetric\ntheories in terms of systems with gain and loss. A formal understanding of this\nunusual feature of non-Hermitian theories requires a careful treatment of\nNoether's theorem, and we give specific examples for illustration.\n", "  In this paper we consider a two component scalar field theory, with\nnoncommutativity in its conjugate momentum space. We quantize such a theory in\na compact space with the help of dressing transformations and we reveal a\nsignificant effect of introducing such noncommutativity as the splitting of the\nenergy levels of each individual mode that constitutes the whole system. We\nfurther compute the thermal partition function exactly with predicted deformed\ndispersion relations from noncommutative theories and compare the results with\nusual results. It is found that thermodynamic quantities in noncommutative\nmodels, irrespective of whether the model is more deformed in infrared/UV\nregion, show deviation from standard results in high temperature region.\n", "  We present the design and performance of a cryogenic scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM) which operates inside a water-cooled Bitter magnet, which can\nattain a magnetic field of up to 38 T. Due to the high vibration environment\ngenerated by the magnet cooling water, a uniquely designed STM and vibration\ndamping system are required. The STM scan head is designed to be as compact and\nrigid as possible, to minimize the effect of vibrational noise as well as fit\nthe size constraints of the Bitter magnet. The STM uses a differential screw\nmechanism for coarse tip - sample approach, and operates in helium exchange gas\nat cryogenic temperatures. The reliability and performance of the STM are\ndemonstrated through topographic imaging and scanning tunneling spectroscopy\n(STS) on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) at T = 4.2 K and in magnetic\nfields up to 34 T.\n", "  We present new families of bound, closed, nonelliptical orbits that are\nsupported by various spherical potentials in clear contradiction to Newton's\nand Bertrand's theorems. We calculate analytically some typical closed orbits\nof arbitrarily large amplitudes for the spherically symmetric forms of the\nNewton-Kepler, Hooke, and linear potentials. In all cases, the radial\noscillations of the orbits exhibit unequal amplitudes and nonsynchronous\nfrequencies on either side of a circular equilibrium orbit. These parameters\nare however related through energy conservation and orbit continuity across the\nequilibrium orbit. The constraints placed on the parameters are all localized\nto each particular orbit and depend crucially on the chosen initial conditions.\n", "  This paper presents a study of $WW\\gamma$ and $WZ\\gamma$ triboson production\nusing events from proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 fb$^{-1}$. The $WW\\gamma$\nproduction cross-section is determined using a final state containing an\nelectron, a muon, a photon, and neutrinos ($e\\nu\\mu\\nu\\gamma$). Upper limits on\nthe production cross-section of the $e\\nu\\mu\\nu\\gamma$ final state and the\n$WW\\gamma$ and $WZ\\gamma$ final states containing an electron or a muon, two\njets, a photon, and a neutrino ($e\\nu jj\\gamma$ or $\\mu\\nu jj\\gamma$) are also\nderived. The results are compared to the cross-sections predicted by the\nStandard Model at next-to-leading order in the strong-coupling constant. In\naddition, upper limits on the production cross-sections are derived in a\nfiducial region optimised for a search for new physics beyond the Standard\nModel. The results are interpreted in the context of anomalous quartic gauge\ncouplings using an effective field theory. Confidence intervals at 95%\nconfidence level are derived for the 14 coupling coefficients to which\n$WW\\gamma$ and $WZ\\gamma$ production are sensitive.\n", "  In a recent work, [Phys. Rev. D. 94, 104010 (2016)], hereafter Paper I, we\nhave numerically studied different prescriptions for the dynamics of a spinning\nparticle in circular motion around a Schwarzschild black hole. In the present\nwork, we continue this line of investigation to the rotating Kerr black hole.\nWe consider the Mathisson-Papapetrou formalism under three different\nspin-supplementary-conditions (SSC), the Tulczyjew SSC, the Pirani SSC and the\nOhashi-Kyrian-Semerak SSC, and analyze the different circular dynamics in terms\nof the ISCO shifts and the frequency parameter ${x \\equiv (M \\Omega)^{2/3}}$,\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the orbital frequency and $M$ is the Kerr black hole mass.\nThen, we solve numerically the inhomogeneous $(2+1)D$ Teukolsky equation to\ncontrast the asymptotic gravitational wave fluxes for the three cases. Our\ncentral observation made in Paper I for the Schwarzschild limit is found to\nhold true for the Kerr background: the three SSCs reduce to the same circular\ndynamics and the same radiation fluxes for small frequency parameters but\ndifferences arise as $x$ grows close to the ISCO. For a positive Kerr parameter\n$a=0.9$ the energy fluxes mutually agree with each other within a $0.2\\%$\nuncertainty up to $x<0.14$, while for $a=-0.9$ this level of agreement is\npreserved up to $x<0.1$. For large frequencies ($x \\gtrsim 0.1$), however, the\nspin coupling of the Kerr black hole and the spinning body results in\nsignificant differences of the circular orbit parameters and the fluxes,\nespecially for the $a=-0.9$ case. Instead, in the study of ISCO the negative\nKerr parameter $a=-0.9$ results in less discrepancies in comparison with the\npositive Kerr parameter $a=0.9$.\n", "  The solar photosphere is filled by a magnetic field which is tangled on\nscales much smaller than the resolution capability of solar telescopes. This\nhidden magnetic field can be investigated via the Hanle effect. In 2007 we\nstarted a synoptic program to explore if the magnetic flux of the quiet\nphotosphere varies with the solar cycle. For this purpose we applied a\ndifferential Hanle effect technique based on observations of scattering\npolarization in C$_2$ molecular lines around 514.0 nm, taken generally every\nmonth. Our results now span almost one complete solar cycle.\n", "  We carried out deep H$\\alpha$ narrowband imaging with 10 hours net\nintegrations towards the young protocluster, USS1558$-$003 at $z=2.53$ with the\nSubaru Telescope. This system is composed of four dense groups with massive\nlocal overdensities, traced by 107 H$\\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) with stellar\nmasses and dust-corrected star formation rates down to $1\\times10^8$ M$_\\odot$\nand 3 M$_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$, respectively. We have investigated the environmental\ndependence of various physical properties within the protocluster by comparing\ndistributions of HAEs in higher and lower densities with a standard\nKolmogorov--Smirnov test. At 97\\% confidence level, we find enhanced star\nformation across the star-forming main sequence of HAEs living in the most\nextreme `supergroup', corresponding to the top quartile of overdensities.\nFurthermore, we derive distribution functions of H$\\alpha$ luminosity and\nstellar mass in group and intergroup regions, approximately corresponding to 30\ntimes and 8 times higher densities than the general field. As a consequence, we\nidentify by 0.7 and 0.9 dex higher cutoffs in H$\\alpha$ luminosity and stellar\nmass functions in the dense groups, respectively. On the other hand, HAEs in\nthe intergroup environment of the protocluster show similar distribution\nfunctions to those of field galaxies despite residing in significant\noverdensities. In the early phase of cluster formation, as inferred from our\nresults, the densest parts in the protocluster have had an accelerated\nformation of massive galaxies. We expect that these eventually grow and\ntransform into early-type galaxies at the bright end of the red sequence as\nseen in present-day rich clusters of galaxies.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new compiled milliarcsecond compact radio data\nset of 120 intermediate-luminosity quasars in the redshift range $0.46< z\n<2.76$. These quasars show negligible dependence on redshifts and intrinsic\nluminosity, and thus represents, in the standard model of cosmology, a fixed\ncomoving-length of standard ruler. We implement a new cosmology-independent\ntechnique to calibrate the linear size of of this standard ruler as $l_m=\n11.03\\pm0.25$ pc, which is the typical radius at which AGN jets become opaque\nat the observed frequency $\\nu\\sim 2$ GHz. In the framework of flat\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, we find a high value of the matter density parameter,\n$\\Omega_m=0.322^{+0.244}_{-0.141}$, and a low value of the Hubble constant,\n$H_0=67.6^{+7.8}_{-7.4}\\; \\rm{kms}^{-1}\\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$, which is in excellent\nagreement with the CMB anisotropy measurements by \\textit{Planck}. We obtain\n${\\Omega_m}=0.309^{+0.215}_{-0.151}$, $w=-0.970^{+0.500}_{-1.730}$ at 68.3% CL\nfor the constant $w$ of a dynamical dark-energy model, which demonstrates no\nsignificant deviation from the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model. Consistent\nfitting results are also obtained for other cosmological models explaining the\ncosmic acceleration, like Ricci dark energy (RDE) or Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati\n(DGP) brane-world scenario. While no significant change in $w$ with redshift is\ndetected, there is still considerable room for evolution in $w$ and the\ntransition redshift at which $w$ departing from -1 is located at $z\\sim 2.0$.\nOur results demonstrate that the method extensively investigated in our work on\nobservational radio quasar data can be used to effectively derive cosmological\ninformation. Finally, we find the combination of high-redshift quasars and\nlow-redshift clusters may provide an important source of angular diameter\ndistances, considering the redshift coverage of these two astrophysical probes.\n", "  Large-scale turbulence in fluid layers and other quasi-two-dimensional\ncompressible systems consists of planar vortices and waves. Separately, wave\nturbulence usually produces a direct energy cascade, while solenoidal planar\nturbulence transports energy to large scales by an inverse cascade. Here, we\nconsider turbulence at finite Mach numbers when the interaction between\nacoustic waves and vortices is substantial. We employ solenoidal pumping at\nintermediate scales and show how both direct and inverse energy cascades are\nformed starting from the pumping scale. We show that there is an inverse\ncascade of kinetic energy up to a scale $\\ell$, where a typical velocity\nreaches the speed of sound; this creates shock waves, which provide for a\ncompensating direct cascade. When the system size is less than $\\ell$, the\nsteady state contains a system-size pair of long-living condensate vortices\nconnected by a system of shocks. Thus turbulence in fluid layers processes\nenergy via a loop: Most energy first goes to large scales via vortices and is\nthen transported by waves to small-scale dissipation.\n", "  Complex systems close to their critical state can exhibit abrupt transitions,\navalanches, between their metastable states. It is a challenging task to\nunderstand the mechanism of the avalanches and control their behavior. Here we\ninvestigate microwave (mw) stimulation of avalanches in the so- called vortex\nmatter of type II superconductors, a system of interacting Abrikosov vortices\nclose to the critical (Bean) state. Our main finding is that the avalanche\nincubation strongly depends on the excitation frequency, a completely\nunexpected behavior observed close to the so-called depinning frequencies.\nNamely, the triggered vortex avalanches in Pb superconducting films become\neffectively inhibited approaching the critical temperature or critical magnetic\nfield when the mw stimulus is close to the vortex depinning frequency. We\nsuggest a simple model explaining the observed counter- intuitive behaviors as\na manifestation of the strongly nonlinear dependence of the driven vortex core\nsize on the mw excitation intensity. This paves the way to controlling\navalanches in complex systems through their nonlinear response.\n", "  The Hugenholtz-Pines (HP) theorem for Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with\ninternal degrees of freedom has been an open problem, in particular, in the\nfield of quantum gases for spinor BECs. We here exactly clarified the HP\ntheorem where an original Hamiltonian has a U$(1)$$\\times$SO$(N)$ or\nU$(1)$$\\times$SU$(N)$ symmetry, but applied to it are SO$(N)$ or SU$(N)$\nsymmetry breaking external fields. This identity serves to organize the HP\ntheorem of the spin-$f$ spinor BEC in the presence of a magnetic field with\nbroken U$(1)$$\\times$SO$(3)$ symmetry.\n", "  The semileptonic decay asymmetry $\\mathcal{A}_{\\Delta m}$ is studied within\nthe open quantum systems approach to the physics of the neutral meson\n$B^0$-$\\overline{B^0}$ system: this extended treatment takes into account\npossible non-standard, dissipative effects induced by the presence of an\nexternal environment. A bound on these effects is provided through the analysis\nof available experimental data from the Belle Collaboration.\n", "  Hard magnets with high coercivity, such as Nd2Fe14B and SmCo5 alloys, can\nmaintain magnetisation under a high reverse external magnetic field and have\ntherefore become irreplaceable parts in many practical applications. Molecular\nmagnets are promising alternatives, owing to their precise and designable\nchemical structures, tuneable functionalities and controllable synthetic\nmethods. Here, we demonstrate that an unusually large coercive field can be\nachieved in a single-chain magnet. Systematic characterisations, including\nmagnetic susceptibility, heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements,\nshow that the observed giant coercive field originates from the spin dynamics\nalong the one-dimensional chain of the compound because of the strong exchange\ncoupling between Co(II) centres and radicals.\n", "  We present simulations of magnetized astrophysical shocks taking into account\nthe interplay between the thermal plasma of the shock and supra-thermal\nparticles. Such interaction is depicted by combining a grid-based\nmagneto-hydrodynamics description of the thermal fluid with particle in cell\ntechniques devoted to the dynamics of supra-thermal particles. This approach,\nwhich incorporates the use of adaptive mesh refinement features, is potentially\na key to simulate astrophysical systems on spatial scales that are beyond the\nreach of pure particle-in-cell simulations. We consider in this study\nnon-relativistic shocks with various Alfvenic Mach numbers and magnetic field\nobliquity. We recover all the features of both magnetic field amplification and\nparticle acceleration from previous studies when the magnetic field is parallel\nto the normal to the shock. In contrast with previous particle-in-cell-hybrid\nsimulations, we find that particle acceleration and magnetic field\namplification also occur when the magnetic field is oblique to the normal to\nthe shock but on larger timescales than in the parallel case. We show that in\nour simulations, the supra-thermal particles are experiencing acceleration\nthanks to a pre-heating process of the particle similar to a shock drift\nacceleration leading to the corrugation of the shock front. Such oscillations\nof the shock front and the magnetic field locally help the particles to enter\nthe upstream region and to initiate a non-resonant streaming instability and\nfinally to induce diffuse particle acceleration.\n", "  Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (Lattice QCD) is a quantum field theory on a\nfinite discretized space-time box so as to numerically compute the dynamics of\nquarks and gluons to explore the nature of subatomic world. Solving the\nequation of motion of quarks (quark solver) is the most compute-intensive part\nof the lattice QCD simulations and is one of the legacy HPC applications. We\nhave developed a mixed-precision quark solver for a large Intel Xeon Phi (KNL)\nsystem named \"Oakforest-PACS\", employing the $O(a)$-improved Wilson quarks as\nthe discretized equation of motion. The nested-BiCGSTab algorithm for the\nsolver was implemented and optimized using mixed-precision,\ncommunication-computation overlapping with MPI-offloading, SIMD vectorization,\nand thread stealing techniques. The solver achieved 2.6 PFLOPS in the\nsingle-precision part on a $400^3\\times 800$ lattice using 16000 MPI processes\non 8000 nodes on the system.\n", "  The critical exponent of the phase boundary has been examined on the\nthree-dimensional incommensurate ordering phase in the spin-1/2\nferromagnetic-leg ladder 3-Br-4-F-V\n[=3-(3-bromo-4-fluorophenyl)-1,5-diphenylverdazyl]. Using the\ntemperature-window fitting technique, we obtained the critical exponents which\nagreed with the three-dimensional (3D) Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)\nuniversality class at both sides of the lower critical field and the saturation\nfield. 3-Br-4-F-V thus becomes a new member of the quantum magnets which prove\nthe universality of the 3D BEC exponent.\n", "  Sequential Quantum Secret Sharing schemes (QSS) do not use entangled states\nfor secret sharing, rather they rely on sequential operations of the players on\na single state which is circulated between the players. In order to check the\nviability of these schemes under imperfect operations and noise in the\nchannels, we consider one such scheme in detail and show that under moderate\nconditions it is still possible to extract viable secure shared keys in this\nscheme. Although we specifically consider only one type of sequential scheme\nand three different noise models, our method is fairly general to be applied to\nother QSS schemes and noise models as well.\n", "  Using low-temperature Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) we provide direct\nexperimental evidence for spontaneous vortex phase (SVP) formation in\nEuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$ single crystal with the superconducting\n$T^{\\rm 0}_{\\rm SC}=23.6$~K and ferromagnetic $T_{\\rm FM}\\sim17.7$~K transition\ntemperatures. Spontaneous vortex-antivortex (V-AV) pairs are imaged in the\nvicinity of $T_{\\rm FM}$. Also, upon cooling cycle near $T_{\\rm FM}$ we observe\nthe first-order transition from the short period domain structure, which\nappears in the Meissner state, into the long period domain structure with\nspontaneous vortices. It is the first experimental observation of this scenario\nin the ferromagnetic superconductors. Low-temperature phase is characterized by\nmuch larger domains in V-AV state and peculiar branched striped structures at\nthe surface, which are typical for uniaxial ferromagnets with perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy (PMA). The domain wall parameters at various temperatures\nare estimated.\n", "  In the tropical limit of matrix KP-II solitons, their support at fixed time\nis a planar graph with \"polarizations\" attached to its linear parts. In this\nwork we explore a subclass of soliton solutions whose tropical limit graph has\nthe form of a rooted and generically binary tree, as well as solutions with a\nlimit graph consisting of two relatively inverted such rooted tree graphs. The\ndistribution of polarizations over the constituting lines of the graph is fully\ndetermined by a parameter-dependent binary operation and a (in general\nnon-linear) Yang-Baxter map, which in the vector KP case becomes linear, hence\nis given by an R-matrix. The parameter-dependence of the binary operation leads\nto a solution of the pentagon equation, which exhibits a certain relation with\nthe Rogers dilogarithm via a solution of the hexagon equation, the next member\nin the family of polygon equations. A generalization of the R-matrix, obtained\nin the vector KP case, is found to also solve a pentagon equation. A\ncorresponding local version of the latter then leads to a new solution of the\nhexagon equation.\n", "  The paper gives an introduction to rate equations in nonlinear continuum\nmechanics which should obey specific transformation rules. Emphasis is placed\non the geometrical nature of the operations involved in order to clarify the\ndifferent concepts. The paper is particularly concerned with common classes of\nconstitutive equations based on corotational stress rates and their proper\nimplementation in time for solving initial boundary value problems. Hypoelastic\nsimple shear is considered as an example application for the derived theory and\nalgorithms.\n", "  Sunspots are cool areas caused by strong surface magnetic fields inhibiting\nconvection. Moreover, strong magnetic fields can alter the average atmospheric\nstructure, degrading our ability to measure stellar masses and ages. Stars more\nactive than the Sun have more and stronger dark spots than in the solar case,\nincluding on the rotational pole itself. Doppler imaging, which has so far\nproduced the most detailed images of surface structures on other stars than the\nSun, cannot always distinguish the hemisphere in which the starspots are\nlocated, especially in the equatorial region and if the data quality is not\noptimal. This leads to problems in investigating the north-south distribution\nof starspot active latitudes (those latitudes with more spot activity), which\nare crucial constraints of dynamo theory. Polar spots, inferred only from\nDoppler tomography, could plausibly be observational artifacts, casting some\ndoubt on their very existence. Here we report imaging of the old,\nmagnetically-active star $\\zeta$ Andromedae using long-baseline infrared\ninterferometry. In our data, a dark polar spot is seen in each of two epochs,\nwhile lower-latitude spot structures in both hemispheres do not persist between\nobservations revealing global starspot asymmetries. The north-south symmetry of\nactive latitudes observed on the Sun is absent on $\\zeta$ And, which hosts\nglobal spot patterns that cannot be produced by solar-type dynamos.\n", "  We investigate how structural relaxation in mixtures with strong dynamical\nasymmetry is affected by the microscopic dynamics. Brownian and Newtonian\ndynamics simulations of dense mixtures of fast and slow hard spheres reveal a\nstriking trend reversal. Below a critical density, increasing the mobility of\nthe fast particles fluidizes the system, yet, above that critical density, the\nsame increase in mobility strongly hinders the relaxation of the slow\nparticles. The critical density itself does not depend on the dynamical\nasymmetry and can be identified with the glass-transition density of the\nmode-coupling theory. The asymptotic dynamics close to the critical density is\nuniversal, but strong pre-asymptotic effects prevail in mixtures with\nadditional size asymmetry. This observation reconciles earlier findings of a\nstrong dependence on kinetic parameters of glassy dynamics in colloid--polymer\nmixtures with the paradigm that the glass transition is determined by the\nproperties of configuration space alone.\n", "  We analytically study the time-averaged electromagnetic energy stored inside\nscatterers containing inclusions of arbitrary shapes. Assuming the low density\nof inclusions, we derive the expression for the energy-transport velocity\nthrough disordered media without relying on the radiative transfer equation.\nMoreover, this expression is independent of the shape of scatterers. In\naddition, we obtain a relation between the dwell and absorption times\nassociated with inclusions by considering the relationship between internal\nenergy and absorption cross-section. An approximation for the electromagnetic\nenergy stored inside a disordered medium in terms of the transport mean free\npath and the packing fraction is also derived. This expression suggests that\nthe enhanced electromagnetic energy within the host medium is achieved for\ninclusions exhibiting negative scattering asymmetry parameters. As a result,\ndisordered media with enhanced backscattering is expected to exhibit large\nquality factors.\n", "  Quantum mechanics ensures that the information stored in a quantum state is\nsecure and the ability to send private information through a quantum channel is\nat least as great as the coherent information. We derive trade-off relations\nbetween quantum privacy, information gain by Eve and the disturbance caused by\nEve to the quantum state that is being sent through a noisy channel. For\ntripartite quantum states, we show that monogamy of privacy exists in the case\nof a single sender and multiple receivers. When Alice prepares a tripartite\nentangled state and shares it with Bob and Charlie through two different noisy\nquantum channels, we prove that if the minimally guaranteed quantum privacy\nbetween Alice and Bob is positive, then the privacy of information between\nAlice and Charlie has to be negative. Thus, quantum privacy for more than two\nparties respects mutual exclusiveness. Then, we prove a monogamy relation for\nthe minimally guaranteed quantum privacy for tripartite systems. We also prove\na trade-off relation between the entanglement of formation across one partition\nand the quantum privacy along another partition. Our results show that quantum\nprivacy cannot be freely shared among multiple parties and can have implication\nin future quantum networks.\n", "  In the past 20 years, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) STIS coronagraphic\ninstrument has observed more than 100 stars, obtaining more than 4,000 readouts\nsince its installment on HST in 1997 and the numbers are still increasing. We\nreduce the whole STIS coronagraphic archive at the most commonly observed\npositions (Wedge A0.6 and A1.0) with new post-processing methods, and present\nour results here. We are able to recover all of the 32 previously reported\ncircumstellar disks, and obtain better contrast close to the star. For some of\nthe disks, our results are limited by the over subtraction of the methods, and\ntherefore the major regions of the disks can be recovered except the faintest\nregions. We also explain our efforts in the calibration of its new BAR5\nocculting position, enabling STIS to explore inner regions as close as 0.2\".\n", "  We study the changes in the phase portrait of a Van der Pol oscillator in a\ndouble well with the change in the shape of the well. Both the symmetric and\nasymmetric double wells are considered. We find that the shape of the well\nplays a very important role in the dynamics of the oscillator such as with the\nchange in shape of the well, the stability of the fixed points of the system\nchanges as well as limit cycles appear and are being destroyed.\n", "  We address the problem of predicting the solvation free energy and\nequilibrium solvent density profile in fews minutes from the molecular density\nfunctional theory beyond the usual hypernetted-chain approximation. We\nintroduce a bridge functional of a coarse-grained, weighted solvent density. In\nfew minutes at most, for solutes of sizes ranging from small compounds to large\nproteins, we produce (i) an estimation of the free energy of solvation within 1\nkcal/mol of the experimental data for the hydrophobic solutes presented here,\nand (ii) the solvent distribution around the solute. Contrary to previous\npropositions, this bridge functional is thermodynamically consistent in that it\nproduces the correct liquid-vapor coexistence and the experimental surface\ntension. We show this consistency to be of crucial importance for water at room\ntemperature and pressure. This bridge functional is designed to be simple,\nlocal, and thus numerically efficient. Finally, we illustrate this new level of\nmolecular theory of solutions with the study of the hydration shell of a\nprotein.\n", "  The Fermi/LAT telescope is an efficient blazar-detector in the MeV/GeV range.\nMore than 1100 (900) blazars detected above 100 MeV (10 GeV) are clearly\nassociated to BL Lacertae or Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar objects in the\nFermi/LAT 3FGL catalogue. This number could significantly increase if\nmulti-wavelength counterparts could be identified for the 573 3FGL blazars with\nunknown type, or even for the 1010 3FGL unassociated sources which are thought\nto be dominated by blazars, at least at high galactic latitude. Unfortunately,\nthe size of the Fermi/LAT error box makes multi-wavelength follow-ups\ndifficult.\n  We propose a method to associate \"blazar-like\" infrared counterparts, having\ncoordinates with a precision of a few arcseconds, to Fermi/LAT blazars and\nunassociated sources. To reach this goal, we built machine-learning classifiers\nbased on the statistical differences of magnitude measurements obtained by the\nWISE satellite, between a sample of well-identified infrared blazars and\nsamples of other types of infrared sources located in regions of the sky where\nno known blazar is present. We provide a list of potential infrared\ncounterparts for 3FGL blazar candidates, along with the associated number of\nexpected false positives. This study contributes to increase the number of\nwell-identified extragalactic blazars and also provides promising blazar\ntargets for the Cherenkov Telescope Array.\n", "  The intermediate dynamics of composed one-dimensional maps is used to\nmultiply attractors in phase space and create multiple independent bifurcation\ndiagrams which can split apart. Results are shown for the composition of\nk-paradigmatic quadratic maps with distinct values of parameters generating\nk-independent bifurcation diagrams with corresponding k orbital points. For\nspecific conditions, the basic mechanism for creating the shifted diagrams is\nthe prohibition of period doubling bifurcations transformed in saddle-node\nbifurcations.\n", "  Plastic deformation in polycrystals is governed by the interplay between\nintra-granular slip and grain boundary-mediated plasticity. However, while the\nrole played by bulk dislocations is relatively well-understood, the\ncontribution of grain boundaries (GBs) has only recently begun to be studied.\nGB plasticity is known to play a key role along with bulk plasticity under a\nwide range of conditions, such as dynamic recovery, superplasticity, severe\nplastic deformation , etc., and developing models capable of simultaneously\ncapturing GB and bulk plasticity has become a topic of high relevance. In this\npaper we develop a thermodynamically-consistent polycrystal plasticity model\ncapable of simulating a variety of grain boundary-mediated plastic processes in\nconjunction with bulk dislocation slip. The model starts from the description\nof a single crystal and creates lattice strain-free polycrystalline\nconfigurations by using a specially-designed multiplicative decomposition\ndeveloped by the authors. This leads to the introduction of a particular class\nof geometrically necessary dislocations (GND) that define fundamental GB\nfeatures such as misorientation and inclination. The evolution of the system is\nbased on an energy functional that uses a non-standard function of the GND\ntensor to account for the grain boundary energy, as well as for the standard\nelastic energy. Our implementation builds on smooth descriptions of GBs\ninspired on diffuse-interface models of grain evolution for numerical\nconvenience. We demonstrate the generality and potential of the methodology by\nsimulating a wide variety of phenomena such as shear-induced GB sliding,\ncoupled GB motion, curvature-induced grain rotation and shrinkage, and\npolygonization via dislocation sub-grain formation.\n", "  Biophotonics is an active research area in molecular imaging, genetic\ndiagnosis and prognosis, with direct applicability in precision medicine.\nHowever, long-standing challenges of biophotonics are well known due to low\nsignal-to-noise ratio and poor image quality, mainly due to strong optical\nscattering especially in deep tissues. Recently, X-ray luminescence computed\ntomography (XLCT) has emerged as a hybrid molecular imaging modality and shown\ngreat promises in overcoming the optical scattering in deep tissues. However,\nits high spatial resolution capacity has not been fully implemented yet. In\nthis paper, with a superfine focused X-ray beam we design a focused-X-ray\nluminescence tomography (FXLT) system for spatial resolution better than 150\nmicrometers and molecular sensitivity of 2 micromolar. First, we describe our\nsystem design. Then, we demonstrate that the molecular sensitivity of FXLT is\nabout 5 micromolar considering the emitted visible photons from background.\nFurthermore, we analyze the measurement time per scan from measured photons\nnumbers with a fiber bundle-PMT setup, report numerical and experimental\nresults. Finally, we specify the imaging system performance based on numerical\nsimulations and physical measurements.\n", "  Nanostructured semiconducting materials are promising candidates for\nthermoelectrics due to their potential to suppress phonon transport while\npreserving electrical properties. Modeling phonon-boundary scattering in\ncomplex geometries is crucial for predicting materials with high conversion\nefficiency. However, the simultaneous presence of ballistic and diffusive\nphonons challenges the development of models that are both accurate and\ncomputationally tractable. Using the recently developed first-principles\nBoltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach, we investigate diffusive phonons\nin nanomaterials with wide mean-free-path (MFP) distributions. First, we derive\nthe short MFP limit of the suppression function, showing that it does not\nnecessarily recover the value predicted by standard diffusive transport,\nchallenging previous assumptions. Second, we identify a Robin type boundary\ncondition describing diffuse surfaces within Fourier's law, extending the\nvalidity of diffusive heat transport in terms of Knudsen numbers. Finally, we\nuse this result to develop a hybrid Fourier/BTE approach to model realistic\nmaterials, obtaining excellent agreement with experiments. These results\nprovide insight on thermal transport in materials that are within experimental\nreach and open opportunities for large-scale screening of nanostructured\nthermoelectric materials.\n", "  The internal structures of pulsating white dwarfs can be explored only with\nasteroseismology. Time series photometric observations were made for the\npulsating DA white dwarf (ZZ Ceti star) WD~0246+326 during 9 nights in 2014\nwith a bi-site observation campaign. Eleven frequencies were detected including\n1 triplet, 2 doublets, and 4 single modes, which are identified as either $l=1$\nor $l=2$ modes with the complementarity of frequencies present in the\nliterature. From the multiplets, the rotation period of \\astrobj{WD~0246+326}\nis derived as $3.78\\pm 0.11$ days. The average period spacing of the l=1 modes\n$\\Delta P=29.3\\pm 0.2s$, implies that \\astrobj{WD~0246+326} may be a massive ZZ\nCeti star concerning the $\\Delta P-M_*$ relationship for the DAVs. Preliminary\nanalysis derives the stellar parameters of $M_*=0.98\\pm0.01$~${\\rm M_\\odot}$\nand $T_{\\rm eff}=11700\\pm100$~K by fitting the theoretical frequencies of the\neigen modes to the observed ones.\n", "  We present a general hardware framework for building networks that directly\nimplement Reservoir Computing, a popular software method for implementing and\ntraining Recurrent Neural Networks and are particularly suited for temporal\ninferencing and pattern recognition. We provide a specific example of a\ncandidate hardware unit based on a combination of soft-magnets, spin-orbit\nmaterials and CMOS transistors that can implement these networks. Efficient non\nvon-Neumann hardware implementation of reservoir computers can open up a\npathway for integration of temporal Neural Networks in a wide variety of\nemerging systems such as Internet of Things (IoTs), industrial controls, bio-\nand photo-sensors, and self-driving automotives.\n", "  Inspired by the recent measurements on two-body nonleptonic $J/{\\psi}$ weak\ndecay at BESIII, the charm-changing $J/{\\psi}$ ${\\to}$ $D_{s,d}V$ weak decays\nare studied with perturbative QCD approach, where $V$ denotes ${\\rho}$ and\n$K^{\\ast}$ vector mesons. It is found that branching ratio for $J/{\\psi}$\n${\\to}$ $D_{s}{\\rho}$ decay can reach up to ${\\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which is\nwithin the potential measurement capability of the future high-luminosity\nexperiments.\n", "  Inspired by the potential prospects of ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ data samples ($n$ $=$\n$1$, $2$, $3$) at LHC and SuperKEKB, ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\rho}$,\n$B_{c}K^{\\ast}$ decays are studied phenomenologically with pQCD approach.\nBranching ratios for ${\\Upsilon}(nS)$ ${\\to}$ $B_{c}{\\rho}$ and $B_{c}K^{\\ast}$\ndecays are estimated to reach up to ${\\cal O}(10^{-11})$ and ${\\cal\nO}(10^{-12})$, respectively. Given the identification and detection efficiency\nof final states, searching for these weak decay modes should be fairly\nchallenging experimentally in the future.\n", "  The topologically nontrivial edge states induce PT transition in\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with one pair of gain and loss at boundaries.\nIn this study, we investigated a pair of PT-symmetric defects located inside\nthe SSH chain, in particular, the defects locations are at the chain centre.\nThe PT symmetry breaking of the bound states leads to the PT transition, the\nPT-symmetric phases and the localized states were studied. In the broken\nPT-symmetric phase, all energy levels break simultaneously in topologically\ntrivial phase; however, two edge states in topologically nontrivial phase are\nfree from the influence of the PT-symmetric defects. We discovered PT-symmetric\nbound states induced by the PT-symmetric local defects at the SSH chain centre.\nThe PT-symmetric bound states significantly increase the PT transition\nthreshold and coalesce to the topologically protected zero mode with vanishing\nprobabilities on every other site of the left-half chain and the right-half\nchain, respectively.\n", "  Polymer-piezoceramic 0-3 composites combine the flexibility of the polymers\nand the excellent piezoelectric properties of the ferroelectric based ceramic.\nWhile grain size of the ceramic powder is one of the important considerations\nin the fabrication of such composites, a correlation relating poling field\ninduced structural changes and its possible influence on the overall\npiezoelectric response of the composite is still lacking. In this paper, we\nexamine this issue on a 0-3 piezo-composite comprising of a ceramic powders of\na low-lead piezoelectric alloy (x)Bi(Ni1/2Zr1/2O3-(1-x)PbTiO3 in proximity of\nits morphotropic phase boundary, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as the\npolymer component. Composites were fabricated by fixing the volume fraction of\nthe ceramic while varying the grain size. We found a non-monotonic variation in\nthe piezo-response as a function of grain size. Structural analysis before and\nafter poling of the piezo-composites revealed evidence of poling induced\ncubic-like to tetragonal irreversible transformation, the extent of which is\ndependent on the grain size.\n", "  We calculate the complete form of the dimension-8 condensate contributions in\nthe two-point correlator of the ($1^{-+}$,$0^{++}$) light hybrid current\nconsidering the operator mixing under renormalization. We find the inclusion\nthese higher power corrections as well as the update of $\\langle g^3G^3\\rangle$\nincrease the QCD sum rule mass prediction for the $1^{-+}$ light hybrid. The\nobtained conservative mass range 1.72--2.60 GeV does not favor the\n$\\pi_1(1400)$ and the $\\pi_1(1600)$ to be pure hybrid states and suggests the\n$\\pi_1(2015)$ observed by E852 is more likely to have much of a hybrid\nconstituent. We also study the $b_1\\pi$ and $\\rho\\pi$ decay patterns of the\n$1^{-+}$ light hybrid with light-cone QCD sum rules. We obtain a relatively\nlarge partial decay width of the $b_1\\pi$ mode, which is consistent with the\npredictions from the flux tube models and lattice QCD. More interestingly,\nusing the tensor interpolating current we find the partial decay width of the\n$\\rho\\pi$ mode is small due to the absence of the leading twist contribution in\nthe light-cone expansion of the correlation function.\n", "  We investigate herein the existence of spectral singularities (SSs) in\ncomposite systems that consist of two separate scattering centers A and B\nembedded in one-dimensional free space, with at least one scattering center\nbeing non-Hermitian. We show that such composite systems have an SS at $k_{c}$\nif the reflection amplitudes $r^{A}\\left( k_{c}\\right) $ and $r^{B}\\left(\nk_{c}\\right) $ of the two scattering centers satisfy the condition\n$r_{\\mathrm{R}% }^{A}\\left( k_{c}\\right) r_{\\mathrm{L}}^{B}\\left( k_{c}\\right)\ne^{i2k_{c}\\left( x_{B}-x_{A}\\right) }=1$. We also extend the condition to the\nsystem with multi-scattering centers. As an application, we construct a simple\nsystem to simulate a resonant lasing cavity.\n", "  We study the Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) pairing state of a two-component\nBose gas with a symmetric spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit at low\ntemperatures, this system is essentially a dilute gas of diatomic molecules. We\ncompute the effective mass of the molecule and find that it is anisotropic in\nmomentum space. The critical temperature of the pairing state is about eight\ntimes smaller than the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) transition temperature\nof an ideal Bose gas with the same density.\n", "  We numerically solve two-dimensional heat diffusion problems by using a\nsimple variant of the meshfree local radial-basis function (RBF) collocation\nmethod. The main idea is to include an additional set of sample nodes outside\nthe problem domain, similarly to the method of images in electrostatics, to\nperform collocation on the domain boundaries. We can thereby take into account\nthe temperature profile as well as its gradients specified by boundary\nconditions at the same time, which holds true even for a node where two or more\nboundaries meet with different boundary conditions. We argue that the image\nmethod is computationally efficient when combined with the local RBF\ncollocation method, whereas the addition of image nodes becomes very costly in\ncase of the global collocation. We apply our modified method to a benchmark\ntest of a boundary value problem, and find that this simple modification\nreduces the maximum error from the analytic solution significantly. The\nreduction is small for an initial value problem with simpler boundary\nconditions. We observe increased numerical instability, which has to be\ncompensated for by a sufficient number of sample nodes and/or more careful\nparameter choices for time integration.\n", "  The prisoner's dilemma describes a conflict between a pair of players, in\nwhich defection is a dominant strategy whereas cooperation is collectively\noptimal. The iterated version of the dilemma has been extensively studied to\nunderstand the emergence of cooperation. In the evolutionary context, the\niterated prisoner's dilemma is often combined with population dynamics, in\nwhich a more successful strategy replicates itself with a higher growth rate.\nHere, we investigate the replicator dynamics of three representative\nstrategies, i.e., unconditional cooperation, unconditional defection, and\ntit-for-tat, which prescribes reciprocal cooperation by mimicking the\nopponent's previous move. Our finding is that the dynamics is self-dual in the\nsense that it remains invariant when we apply time reversal and exchange the\nfractions of unconditional cooperators and defectors in the population. The\nduality implies that the fractions can be equalized by tit-for-tat players,\nalthough unconditional cooperation is still dominated by defection.\nFurthermore, we find that mutation among the strategies breaks the exact\nduality in such a way that cooperation is more favored than defection, as long\nas the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is small.\n", "  Diffusion can be conceptualized, at microscopic scales, as the random hopping\nof particles between neighboring lattice sites. In the case of diffusion in\ninhomogeneous media, distinct spatial domains in the system may yield distinct\nparticle hopping rates. Starting from the master equations (MEs) governing\ndiffusion in inhomogeneous media we derive here, for arbitrary spatial\ndimensions, the deterministic lattice equations (DLEs) specifying the average\nparticle number at each lattice site for randomly diffusing particles in\ninhomogeneous media. We consider the case of free diffusion with no steric\nconstraints on the maximum particle number per lattice site as well as the case\nof diffusion under steric constraints imposing a maximum particle\nconcentration. We find, for both transient and asymptotic regimes, excellent\nagreement between the DLEs and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the MEs. The\nDLEs provide a computationally efficient method for predicting the (average)\ndistribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media, with the\nnumber of DLEs associated with a given system being independent of the number\nof particles in the system. From the DLEs we obtain general analytic\nexpressions for the steady-state particle distributions for free diffusion and,\nin special cases, diffusion under steric constraints in inhomogeneous media. We\nfind that, in the steady state of the system, the average fraction of particles\nin a given domain is independent of most system properties, such as the\narrangement and shape of domains, and only depends on the number of lattice\nsites in each domain, the hopping rates, the number of distinct particle\nspecies, and the total number of particles of each particle species in the\nsystem. Our results provide general insights into the role of spatially\ninhomogeneous particle hopping rates in setting the particle distributions in\ninhomogeneous media.\n", "  We report on the recent studies of leading order baryon-baryon interactions\nin covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. In the strangeness $S=0$\nsector, one can achieve a rather good description of the Nijmegen $np$ phase\nshifts with angular momenta $J\\leq 1$, particularly the $^1S_0$ and $^3P_0$\npartial waves, comparable with the next-to-leading order (NLO) heavy baryon\napproach. In the strangeness $S=-1$ hyperon-nucleon sector, the best fit of the\n36 scattering data is similar to the sophisticated phenomenological models and\nthe NLO heavy baryon approach.\n", "  We report the magnetic diffraction pattern and spin wave excitations in\n(CD$_3$)$_2$ND$_2$[Mn(DCO$_2$)$_3$] measured using elastic and inelastic\nneutron scattering. The magnetic structure is shown to be a G-type\nantiferromagnet with moments pointing along the $b$ axis. By comparison with\nsimulations based on linear spin wave theory, we have developed a model for the\nmagnetic interactions in this multiferroic metal-organic framework material.\nThe interactions form a three-dimensional network with antiferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbour interactions along three directions of $J_1=-0.103(8)$~meV,\n$J_2=-0.032(8)$~meV and $J_3=-0.035(8)$~meV.\n", "  The Phase-1 upgrade of the CMS pixel detector is built out of four barrel\nlayers (BPix) and three forward disks in each endcap (FPix). It comprises a\ntotal of 124M pixel channels in 1,856 modules, and it is designed to withstand\ninstantaneous luminosities of up to $2 \\times 10^{34}\\,$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.\nDifferent parts of the detector were assembled over the last year and later\nbrought to CERN for installation inside the CMS tracker. At various stages\nduring the assembly tests have been performed to ensure that the readout and\npower electronics and the cooling system meet the design specifications. After\ntests of the individual components, system tests were performed before the\ninstallation inside CMS. In addition to reviewing these tests, we also present\nresults from the final commissioning of the detector in-situ using the central\nCMS DAQ system. Finally we review results from the initial operation of the\ndetector first with cosmic rays and then with pp collisions.\n", "  We report the experimental detection of bulk topological invariants in\nnonunitary discrete-time quantum walks with single photons. The nonunitarity of\nthe quantum dynamics is enforced by periodically performing partial\nmeasurements on the polarization of the walker photon, which effectively\nintroduces loss to the dynamics. The topological invariant of the nonunitary\nquantum walk is manifested in the quantized average displacement of the walker,\nwhich is probed by monitoring the photon loss. We confirm the topological\nproperties of the system by observing localized edge states at the boundary of\nregions with different topological invariants. We further demonstrate the\nrobustness of both the topological properties and the measurement scheme of the\ntopological invariants against disorder.\n", "  We have developed and implemented a new ab initio code, CERES (Computational\nEmulator of Rare Earth Systems), completely written in C++11, which is\ndedicated to the efficient calculation of the electronic structure and magnetic\nproperties of the crystal field states arising from the splitting of the ground\nstate spin-orbit multiplet in lanthanide complexes. The new code gains\nefficiency via an optimised implementation of a direct configurational averaged\nHartree-Fock (CAHF) algorithm for the determination of $4f$ quasi-atomic active\norbitals common to all multi-electron spin manifolds contributing to the ground\nspin-orbit multiplet of the lanthanide ion. The new CAHF implementation is\nbased on quasi-Newton convergence acceleration techniques coupled to an\nefficient library for the direct evaluation of molecular integrals, and\nproblem-specific density matrix guess strategies. After describing the main\nfeatures of the new code, we compare its efficiency with the current\nstate--of--the--art ab initio strategy to determine crystal field levels and\nproperties, and show that our methodology, as implemented in CERES, represents\na more time-efficient computational strategy for the evaluation of the magnetic\nproperties of lanthanide complexes, also allowing a full representation of\nnon-perturbative spin-orbit coupling effects.\n", "  Atomic-scale impurity spins, also called color centers, in an otherwise\nspin-free diamond host lattice have proven to be versatile tools for\napplications in solid-state-based quantum technologies ranging from quantum\ninformation processing (QIP) to quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology. Due to\nits wide band gap, diamond can host hundreds of different color centers.\nHowever, their suitability for QIP or sensing applications has only been tested\nfor a handful of these, with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) strongly dominating this\nfield of research. Due to its limited optical properties, the success of the NV\nfor QIP applications however strongly depends on the development of efficient\nphotonic interfaces. In the past years the negatively charged silicon vacancy\n(SiV) center received significant attention due to its highly favourable\nspectral properties such as narrow zero phonon line transitions and weak phonon\nsidebands. We here review recent work investigating the SiV centre's orbital\nand electron spin coherence properties as well as techniques to coherently\ncontrol its quantum state using microwave as well as optical fields and we\noutline potential future experimental directions to improve the SiV's coherence\ntime scale and to develop it into a valuable tool for QIP applications.\n", "  Active faults release elastic strain energy via a whole continuum of modes of\nslip, ranging from devastating earthquakes to Slow Slip Events and persistent\ncreep. Understanding the mechanisms controlling the occurrence of rapid,\ndynamic slip radiating seismic waves (i.e. earthquakes) or slow, silent slip\n(i.e. SSEs) is a fundamental point in the estimation of seismic hazard along\nsubduction zones. On top of showing slower rupture propagation velocity than\nearthquakes, SSEs exhibit different scaling relationships, which could reflect\neither different physical mechanisms or an intriguing lack of observations.\nLike earthquakes, SSEs are bound to occur along unstable portions of active\nfaults, raising the question of the physical control of the mode of slip\n(seismic or aseismic) along these sections. Here, we use the numerical\nimplementation of a simple rate-weakening fault model to explain the\nspontaneous occurrence, the characteristics and the scaling relationship of\nSSEs and earthquakes. We show that the simplest of fault geometrical\ncomplexities with uniform friction properties can reproduce slow and fast\nearthquakes without appealing to complex rheologies or mechanisms. Our model\nhelps resolve many of the existing paradoxes between observations and physical\nmodels of earthquakes and SSEs.\n", "  In this paper we consider properties of the space-time manifold M caused by\nthe proposition that, according to the scheme theory, the manifold M is locally\nisomorphic to the spectrum of the algebra A, M = Spec(A), where A is the\ncommutative algebra of distributions of quantum-field densities. In order to\ndetermine the algebra A, it is necessary to define multiplication on densities\nand to eliminate those densities, which cannot be multiplied. This leads to\nessential restrictions imposed on densities and on space-time properties. It is\nfound that the only possible case, when the commutative algebra A exists, is\nthe case, when the quantum fields are in the spacetime manifold M with the\nstructure group SO(3,1) (Lorentz group). The algebra A consists of\ndistributions of densities with singularities in the closed future light cone\nsubset. On account of the local isomorphism M = Spec(A), the quantum fields\nexist only in the space-time manifold with the one-dimensional arrow of time.\nIn the fermion sector the restrictions caused by the possibility to define the\nmultiplication on the densities of spinor fields can explain the chirality\nviolation. It is found that for bosons in the Higgs sector the charge\nconjugation symmetry violation on the densities of states can be observed. This\nsymmetry violation can explain the matter-antimatter imbalance.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations allowed\nus to precisely determine its mass being 125.09 $\\pm$ 0.24GeV. This value is\nintriguing as it lies at the frontier between the regions of stability and\nmeta-stability of the standard model vacuum. It is known that the hierarchy\nproblem can be interpreted in terms of the near criticality between the two\nphases. The coefficient of the Higgs bilinear in the scalar potential, $m^{2}$,\nis pushed by quantum corrections away from zero, towards the extremes of the\ninterval $[-M^{2}_{Pl},M^{2}_{Pl}]$ where $M_{Pl}$ is the Planck mass. In this\narticle, I show that demanding topological invariance for the renormalisation\ngroup allows us to extend the beta functions such that the particular value of\nthe Higgs mass parameter observed in our universe regains naturalness. In\nholographic terms, invariance to changes of topology in the bulk is dual to a\nnatural large hierarchy in the boundary quantum field theory. The demand of\ninvariance to topology changes in the bulk appears to be strongly tied to the\ninvariance of string theory to T-duality in the presence of H-fluxes.\n", "  We present a framework that explains the strong connection in 2D materials\nbetween mechanics and electronic structure, via dislocation theory. Within this\nframework, Moir\\'e patterns created by layered 2D materials may be understood\nas dislocation arrays, and vice versa. The dislocations are of a unique type\nthat we describe as van der Waals dislocations, for which we present a complete\ngeometrical description, connected to both stretch and twist Moir\\'e patterns.\nA simple computational scheme, which reduces the complexity of the electronic\ninteraction between layers in order to make the problem computationally\ntractable, is introduced to simulate these dislocation arrays, allowing us to\npredict and explain all of the observed Moir\\'e patterns in 2D material systems\nwithin a unique framework. We extend this analysis as well to defects in\nMoir\\'e patterns, which have been reported recently, and which are the result\nof defects of the same symmetry in the constituent 2D material layers. Finally,\nwe show that linear defects in the Moir\\'e space can be viewed as\nunidimensional topological states, and can be engineered using our framework\n", "  (Abridged) On small scales, there exists a tension between observations of\ndwarf galaxies and predictions for low-mass dark matter halos from simulations\n(often referred to as the small scale crisis). Detailed observations of low\nmass galaxies are critical for constraining the baryonic feedback processes\nthat are used to alleviate these discrepancies. Dwarf galaxies with a\nsubstantial reservoir of neutral hydrogen (HI) are likely to be isolated,\nhelping to disentangle intrinsic properties from evolutionary effects, and HI\nkinematics offer an immediate constraint on the hosting dark matter halo. Given\nMeerKAT's exquisite sensitivity, it can potentially contribute to these studies\nof low-mass HI-rich dwarf galaxies that will help resolve the small scale\ncrisis. The current large HI surveys are not designed for these studies, but\nwill still manage to detect a sample of galaxies with HI masses below 10^7 Msun\ncomparable to the number of systems currently in the literature, and will\nresolve ~15 systems with masses below 10^8.5 Msun, a critical regime for\naddressing which dark matter halos host low-mass galaxies. We propose a\nthousand hour survey of the Centaurus region, encompassing the M83 and CenA\ngalaxy groups, which can robustly address the central question: \"How many\ngalaxies equivalent to Leo T are there in the Centaurus region?\" Leo T is the\nlowest mass, gas-rich galaxy currently known; our proposed survey is designed\nto be able to detect an object of similar HI mass and linewidth throughout the\nvolume of the Centuaurus region, which will provide a full census of how many\nobjects like this there are in a typical galaxy group. In addition, planes of\nsatellites have recently been identified around CenA and our survey will be\nable to address how far out these planes extend: are they structures\nconcentrated only around the central galaxy or are they connected to large\nscale structure?\n", "  We present a method for improving the phenomenological description of\nMueller-Navelet jets at LHC, which is based on matching the BFKL resummation\nwith fixed order calculations. We point out the need of a consistent\nidentification of jets between experimental measurements and theoretical\ndescriptions. We hope as well to motivate an extensive analysis of MN jets at\nLHC in run 2.\n", "  We generalize the semiclassical treatment of graviton radiation to\ngravitational scattering at very large energies $\\sqrt{s}\\gg m_P$ and finite\nscattering angles $\\Theta_s$, so as to approach the collapse regime of impact\nparameters $b \\simeq b_c \\sim R\\equiv 2G\\sqrt{s}$. Our basic tool is the\nextension of the recently proposed, unified form of radiation to the ACV\nreduced-action model and to its resummed-eikonal exchange. By superimposing\nthat radiation all-over eikonal scattering, we are able to derive the\ncorresponding (unitary) coherent-state operator. The resulting graviton\nspectrum, tuned on the gravitational radius $R$, fully agrees with previous\ncalculations for small angles $\\Theta_s\\ll 1$ but, for sizeable angles\n$\\Theta_s(b)\\leq \\Theta_c = O(1)$ acquires an exponential cutoff of the large\n$\\omega R$ region, due to energy conservation, so as to emit a finite fraction\nof the total energy. In the approach-to-collapse regime of $b\\to b_c^+$ we find\na radiation enhancement due to large tidal forces, so that the whole energy is\nradiated off, with a large multiplicity $\\langle N \\rangle\\sim Gs \\gg 1$ and a\nwell-defined frequency cutoff of order $R^{-1}$.\n  The latter corresponds to the Hawking temperature for a black hole of mass\nnotably smaller than $\\sqrt{s}$.\n", "  ATLAS and CMS have been performing a large number of searches for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model (BSM). In particular results of supersymmetry (SUSY)\nsearches are typically interpreted in the context of simplified models. While\nmass limits obtained in this manner are highly model dependent, cross section\nupper limits (or efficiency maps) may be used to obtain constraints on generic\nBSM scenarios without any further event and detector simulation. This procedure\nhas been automatised in the public tool SModelS, which first decomposes the\ngeneric scenario into its simplified model components which can then be tested\ndirectly against the experimental constraints in the SModelS database. We\nbriefly introduce SModelS and then discuss how the coverage by simplified model\nresults compares to what can be obtained in a full simulation study for the\nexample of the 19 parameter phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM). Considering all\nparameter points that ATLAS has tested in a comprehensive study [1], we find\nthat about 60 % of the points excluded by ATLAS can be excluded from simplified\nmodel constraints. This fraction could be improved by considering currently\n`missing' simplified model topologies. We show that in particular topologies\nwith asymmetric branches are often important, while long cascade decays with\nmore than one intermediate particle are less relevant. A particularly\ninteresting asymmetric branch topology is a 3 jet + $E_T^{\\mathrm{miss}}$\nsignature arising from gluino-squark production.\n", "  Cargo imaging with Megavoltage (MV) radiography has important applications\nfor detecting illicit materials. It enables decomposing and quantifying\nmaterials with different atomic numbers by imaging cargo at two different x-ray\nenergies, or dual energy (DE) radiography. The performance of both single\nenergy and DE radiography depends on beam energy, beam filtration, radiation\ndose, object size, and object content. The purpose of this work was to perform\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative investigations of the image quality\nin MV radiography depending on the above parameters. A digital phantom was\ndesigned including Fe background with thicknesses of 2cm, 6cm, and 18cm, and\nmaterials samples of Polyethylene, Fe, Pb, and U. The single energy images were\ngenerated at x-ray beam energies 3.5MV, 6MV, and 9MV. The DE material\ndecomposed images were generated using interlaced low and high energy beams\n3.5/6MV and 6/9MV. The x-rays beams were filtered by low-Z (Polyethylene) and\nhigh-Z (Pb) filters with variable thicknesses. The radiation output of the\naccelerator was kept constant for all beam energies. The image quality metrics\nwas signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the particular sample over a particular\nbackground. It was found that the SNR depends on the above parameters in a\ncomplex way, but can be optimized by selecting a particular set of parameters.\nFor some imaging setups increased filter thicknesses, while strongly absorbed\nthe beams, increased the SNR of material decomposed images. Beam hardening due\nto polyenergetic x-ray spectra resulted in material decomposition errors, but\nthis could be addressed using region of interest decomposition. It was shown\nthat it is not feasible to separate the materials with close atomic numbers\nusing the DE method. Particularly, Pb and U were difficult to decompose, at\nleast at the dose levels allowed by radiation source and safety requirements.\n", "  The problem of stabilization of unstable periodic orbits of discrete\nnonlinear systems is considered in the article. A new generalization of the\ndelayed feedback, which solves the stabilization problem, is proposed. The\nfeedback is represented as a convex combination of nonlinear feedback and\nsemilinear feedback introduced by O. Morgul. In this article, the O. Morgul\nmethod was transferred from the scalar case to the vector one. It is shown that\nthe additional introduction of the semilinear feedback into the equation makes\nit possible to significantly reduce the length of the prehistory used in the\ncontrol and to increase the rate of convergence of the perturbed solutions to\nperiodic ones. As an application of the proposed stabilization scheme, a\npossible computational algorithm for finding solutions of systems of algebraic\nequations is given. The numerical simulation results are presented.\n", "  A simple Discrete-Time Quantum Walk on the line is revisited and given an\nhydrodynamic interpretation through a novel relativistic generalization of the\nMadelung transform. Numerical results are presented which show that suitable\ninitial conditions indeed produce hydrodynamical shocks. An analytical\ncomputation of the asymptotic quantum shock structure is presented. The\nnon-relativistic limit is explored in the Supplementary Material (SM).\n", "  In three-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamics, closed flux surfaces cannot\nmaintain both rational rotational-transform and pressure gradients, as these\nfeatures together produce unphysical, infinite currents. A proposed set of\nequilibria nullifies these currents by flattening the pressure on sufficiently\nwide intervals around each rational surface. Such rational surfaces exist at\nevery scale, which characterizes the pressure profile as self-similar and thus\nfractal. The pressure profile is approximated numerically by considering a\nfinite number of rational regions and analyzed mathematically by classifying\nthe irrational numbers that support gradients into subsets. Applying these\nresults to a given rotational-transform profile in cylindrical geometry, we\nfind magnetic field and current density profiles compatible with the fractal\npressure.\n", "  Motivated by the holographic prescriptions for computing entanglement entropy\nand complexity, we study the properties of volumes/areas of bulk surfaces. We\nobtain a simple formula for the shape dependence of holographic entanglement\nentropy in terms of a certain integral over the entangling surface. This easily\ngeneralizes to any bulk codimension-$p$ extremal surface. We study additional\nproperties of bulk codimension-$p$ extremal surfaces corresponding to\nstrip/plane \"entangling surfaces\" in various geometries. We compute universal\nterms for codim-one volumes (conjectured to be dual to holographic subregion\ncomplexity) arising from performing relevant deformations. Finally, we describe\nseveral interesting bulk surface constructions which are presumably related to\nholographic complexity.\n", "  We present our study of OGLE-2014-SN-073, one of the brightest Type II SN\never discovered, with an unusually broad lightcurve combined with high ejecta\nvelocities. From our hydrodynamical modelling we infer a remarkable ejecta mass\nof $60^{+42}_{-16}$~M$_\\odot$, and a relatively high explosion energy of\n$12.4^{+13.0}_{-5.9} \\times10^{51}$~erg. We show that this object belongs, with\na very small number of other hydrogen-rich SNe, to an energy regime that is not\nexplained by standard core-collapse (CC) neutrino-driven explosions. We compare\nthe quantities inferred by the hydrodynamical modelling with the expectations\nof various exploding scenarios, trying to explain the high energy and\nluminosity released. We find some qualitative similarities with\npair-instabilities SNe, although a prompt injection of energy by a magnetar\nseems also a viable alternative to explain such extreme event.\n", "  Due to the gap between the known 100 GeV scale and new physics if any, it is\nnatural to employ an effective one-loop Lagrangian (HEFT) for the particles of\nthe Electroweak Symmetry Breaking Sector (W_L, Z_L and h). To describe any new\nparticles and resonances that may be found at the LHC we employ its unitarized\namplitudes, valid even in the presence of new strong interactions. We have\nassessed the systematics by comparing several such methods, and find that they\ngive qualitatively similar results and succesfully produce unitary amplitudes\nin the nonperturbative regime. We are thus in a position to describe new\nphysics in the 0.5 TeV-3 TeV (region of validity of our approximations: the\neffective theory and the equivalence theorem to substitute W_L, Z_L by the\nGoldstone bosons of electroweak symmetry breaking). We have also computed the\ncoupling of the EWSBS to the top-antitop and two-photon channels to describe\nresonances that decay through them or to study their photon-photon production,\nfor example. The approach is universal and useful for many BSM theories at low\nenergy.\n", "  In this work we examine what are the cosmological implications of allowing\nthe geometrical curvature density to behave independently from the energy\ndensity contents. Using the full data extracted by Planck mission from CMB,\ncombined with BAO and SNIa measurements, we derive, in the light of this\napproach, new constraints on the cosmological parameters. In particular we\ndetermine the behavior of the curvature dark energy degeneracy when allowing a\nvarying equation of state for the latter. We also examine whether this approach\ncould bridge the gap recently found between the Hubble parameter value\ndetermined from CMB and that from the local universe measurements\n", "  We analyze the performance of classical and quantum search algorithms from a\nthermodynamic perspective, focusing on resources such as time, energy, and\nmemory size. We consider two examples that are relevant to post-quantum\ncryptography: Grover's search algorithm, and the quantum algorithm for\ncollision-finding. Using Bennett's \"Brownian\" model of low-power reversible\ncomputation, we show classical algorithms that have the same asymptotic energy\nconsumption as these quantum algorithms. Thus, the quantum advantage in query\ncomplexity does not imply a reduction in these thermodynamic resource costs. In\naddition, we present realistic estimates of the resource costs of quantum and\nclassical search, for near-future computing technologies. We find that, if\nmemory is cheap, classical exhaustive search can be surprisingly competitive\nwith Grover's algorithm.\n", "  The magnetic field due to an axially symmetric, hot and highly conducting\nplasma, taken as an ideal magnetohydrodynamic fluid, surrounding a slow\nrotating compact gravitational object is studied within the context of\nEinstein-Maxwell field equations. It is assumed that whereas the plasma is\neffected by the background spacetime it does not effect the spacetime itself.\nThe Einstein-Maxwell equations are then solved for the magnetic field in a\ncomoving frame with the background spacetime described by the slow rotating\nKerr black hole spacetime. It is found that the solutions are magnetic waves\ntravelling along the azimuthal angle with velocity equal to the angular\nvelocity of a free falling intertial frame. These general solutions, when\napplied to various particular cases of physical interest, show that for a fixed\nvalue of the azimuthal angle the magnetic field is completely induced by the\ndragging of the background spacetime.\n", "  The probabilities of point events in space 3 + 1 obey an equation of Dirac\ntype. Masses, moments, energies, spins, etc. are the parameters of the\nprobability distribution of such events. The terms and equations of quark-gluon\ntheories turn out theoretically probabilistic terms and theorems. Confinement\nand asymptotic freedom are explained by behaviour of such probabolities. And\nhere we have the probabilistic foundations of the theory of gravitation.\nKnowledge of the elements of linear algebra and differential calculus is\nsufficient to understand the content of this article.\n"]}
