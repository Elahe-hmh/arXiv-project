Gravitational waves emitted from binary neutron stars during their late\nstages of inspiral and merger contain imprints of the neutron-star equation of\nstate. Measuring departures from the point-particle limit of the late inspiral\nwaveform allows one to measure properties of the equation of state via\ngravitational wave observations. This and a companion talk by J. S. Read\nreports a comparison of numerical waveforms from simulations of inspiraling\nneutron-star binaries, computed for equations of state with varying stiffness.\nWe calculate the signal strength of the difference between waveforms for\nvarious commissioned and proposed interferometric gravitational wave detectors\nand show that observations at frequencies around 1 kHz will be able to measure\na compactness parameter and constrain the possible neutron-star equations of\nstate.\n", "  We calculate the transverse correlation of fluctuations of the deposited\nenergy density in nuclear collisions in the framework of the Gaussian color\nglass condensate model.\n", "  We study time harmonic scattering for the Helmholtz equation in Rn. We show\nthat certain penetrable scatterers with rectangular corners scatter every\nincident wave nontrivially. Even though these scatterers have interior\ntransmission eigenvalues, the relative scattering (a.k.a. far field) operator\nhas a trivial kernel and cokernel at every real wavenumber.\n", "  To elucidate ideal measurements, one must explain how individual events\nemerge from quantum theory which deals with statistical ensembles, and how\ndifferent may end up with different final states. This so-called \"measurement\nproblem\" is tackled with two guidelines. On the one hand, the dynamics of the\nmacroscopic apparatus A coupled to the tested system S is described\nmathematically within a standard quantum formalism, where \"q-probablities\"\nremain devoid of interpretation. On the other hand, interpretative principles\nare introduced to account for the expected features of ideal measurements. Most\nof the five principles, which relate the quantum formalism to physical reality,\nare straightforward and refer to macroscopic variables. The process can be\nidentified with a relaxation of S+A to thermodynamic equilibrium, not only for\na large ensemble $\\scriptE$ of runs but even for its sub-ensembles. The\ndifferent mechanisms of quantum statistical dynamics that ensure the relaxation\nare exhibited. The additional information provided by the sub-ensembles remove\nSchr\\\"odinger's quantum ambiguity of the final density operator for $\\scriptE$\nwhich hinders its direct interpretation, and bring out a commutative behaviour\nof the pointer observable at the final time. The latter property supports the\nintroduction of a last principle, needed to switch from the statistical\nensembles and sub-ensembles described by quantum theory to individual\nexperimental events. It amounts to identify some formal \"q-probabilities\" with\nordinary frequencies, but only those which refer to the final pointer\nindications. The desired properties of ideal measurements, in particular the\nuniqueness of the result for each individual run and von Neumann's reduction,\nare thereby recovered with economic interpretations. The status of Born's rule\ninvolving both A and S is re-evaluated, and contextuality is made obvious.\n", "  A coherent picture of the wavepacket-reduction process is proposed which is\nformulated in the framework of a deterministic and realist interpretation where\nthe concepts of knowledge or information and of point particles do not appear.\nIt is shown how the picture accounts for the experiments on interaction-free\nand delayed-choice measurements and those on interference with partial\nabsorption.\n", "  We have constructed numerically non-Abelian vortices in an SU(2)\nChern-Simons-Higgs theory with a quartic Higgs potential. We have analyzed\nthese solutions in detail by means of improved numerical codes and found some\nunexpected features we did not find when a sixth-order Higgs potential was\nused. The generic non-Abelian solutions have been generated by using their\ncorresponding Abelian counterparts as initial guess. Typically, the energy of\nthe non-Abelian solutions is lower than that of the corresponding Abelian one\n(except in certain regions of the parameter space). Regarding the angular\nmomentum, the Abelian solutions possess the maximal value, although there exist\nnon-Abelian solutions which reach that maximal value too. In order to classify\nthe solutions it is useful to consider the non-Abelian solutions with\nasymptotically vanishing $A_t$ component of the gauge potential, which may be\nlabelled by an integer number $m$. For vortex number $n=3$ and above, we have\nfound uniqueness violation: two different non-Abelian solutions with all the\nglobal charges equal. Finally, we have investigated the limit of infinity Higgs\nself-coupling parameter and found a piecewise Regge-like relation between the\nenergy and the angular momentum.\n", "  Solenoid Siberian snakes have successfully maintained polarization in\nparticle rings below 1 GeV, but never in multi-GeV rings because the Lorentz\ncontraction of a solenoid's integral B dl would require impractically long\nhigh-field solenoids. High energy rings, such as Brookhaven's 255 GeV\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), use only odd multiples of pairs of\ntransverse B-field Siberian snakes directly opposite each other. When it became\nimpractical to use a pair of Siberian Snakes in Fermilab's 120 GeV Main\nInjector, we searched for a new type of single Siberian snake, which should\novercome all depolarizing resonances in the 8.9 - 120 GeV range. We found that\none snake made of one 4-twist helix and 2 short dipoles could maintain the\npolarization. This snake design might also be used at other rings, such as\nJapan's 30 GeV J-PARC, the 12 - 24 GeV NICA proton-deuteron collider at\nJINR-Dubna, and perhaps RHIC's injector, the 25 GeV AGS.\n", "  Within this chapter (published as [49]) we introduce the overall idea of the\nalgebraic formalism of QFT on a fixed globally hyperbolic spacetime in the\nframework of unital $*$-algebras. We point out some general features of CCR\nalgebras, such as simplicity and the construction of symmetry-induced\nhomomorphisms. For simplicity, we deal only with a real scalar quantum field.\nWe discuss some known general results in curved spacetime like the existence of\nquasifree states enjoying symmetries induced from the background, pointing out\nthe relevant original references. We introduce, in particular, the notion of a\nHadamard quasifree algebraic quantum state, both in the geometric and\nmicrolocal formulation, and the associated notion of Wick polynomials.\n", "  We present a new measurement of the mass-concentration relation and the\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio over the halo mass range $5\\times 10^{12}$ to\n$2\\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$. To achieve this, we use weak lensing measurements\nfrom the CFHT Stripe 82 Survey (CS82), combined with the central galaxies from\nthe redMaPPer cluster catalogue and the LOWZ/CMASS galaxy sample of the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Tenth Data\nRelease. The stacked lensing signals around these samples are modelled as a sum\nof contributions from the central galaxy, its dark matter halo, and the\nneighboring halos, as well as a term for possible centering errors. We measure\nthe mass-concentration relation: $c_{200c}(M)=A(\\frac{M_{200c}}{M_0})^{B}$ with\n$A=5.24\\pm1.24, B=-0.13\\pm0.10$ for $0.2<z<0.4$ and $A=6.61\\pm0.75,\nB=-0.15\\pm0.05$ for $0.4<z<0.6$. These amplitudes and slopes are completely\nconsistent with predictions from recent simulations. We also measure the\nstellar-to-halo mass ratio for our samples, and find results consistent with\nprevious measurements from lensing and other techniques.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical evolution of 40 open clusters (OCs) by means of\ntheir astrophysical parameters derived from field-decontaminated 2MASS\nphotometry. We find a bifurcation in the planes core radius vs. age and cluster\nradius vs. age, in which part of the clusters appear to expand with time\nprobably due to the presence of stellar black holes while others seem to shrink\ndue to dynamical relaxation. Mass functions (MFs) are built for 3$/$4 of the\nsample (31 OCs), which are used to search for indications of mass segregation\nand external dynamical processes by means of relations among astrophysical,\nstructural and evolutionary parameters. We detect a flattening of MF slopes\nocurring at the evolutionary parameters $\\tau_{core}\\leq 32$ and\n$\\tau_{overall}\\leq 30$, respectively. Within the uncertainties involved, the\noverall MF slopes of 14 out of 31 OCs with $m_{overall} > 500~M_{\\odot}$ are\nconsistent with Kroupa's initial mass function, implying little or no dynamical\nevolution for these clusters. The remaining 17 OCs with MF slopes departing\nfrom that of Kroupa show mild/large scale mass segregation due to dynamical\nevolution.\n", "  Graphene and topological insulators (TI) possess two-dimensional Dirac\nfermions with distinct physical properties. Integrating these two Dirac\nmaterials in a single device creates interesting opportunities for exploring\nnew physics of interacting massless Dirac fermions. Here we report on a\npractical route to experimental fabrication of graphene-Sb2Te3 heterostructure.\nThe graphene-TI heterostructures are prepared by using a dry transfer of\nchemical-vapor-deposition grown graphene film. ARPES measurements confirm the\ncoexistence of topological surface states of Sb2Te3 and Dirac {\\pi} bands of\ngraphene, and identify the twist angle in the graphene-TI heterostructure. The\nresults suggest a potential tunable electronic platform in which two different\nDirac low-energy states dominate the transport behavior.\n", "  We report on fabrication of a two-dimensional topological insulator-Bi(111)\nbilayer on Sb nanofilms via a sequential molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth\ntechnique. Our angle-resolved photoemission measurements demonstrate the\nevolution of the electronic band structure of the heterostructure as a function\nof the film thickness and reveal the existence of a two-dimensional spinful\nmassless electron gas within the top Bi bilayer. Interestingly, Our\nfirst-principles calculation extrapolating the observed band structure shows\nthat, by tuning down the thickness of the supporting Sb films into the quantum\ndimension regime, a pair of isolated topological edge states emerges in a\npartial energy gap at 0.32 eV above the Fermi level as a consequence of quantum\nconfinement effect. Our results and methodology of fabricating nanoscale\nheterostructures establish the Bi bilayer/Sb heterostructure as a platform of\ngreat potential for both ultralow-energy-cost electronics and surface-based\nspintronics.\n", "  The radial profiles of stars in disc galaxies are observed to be either\npurely exponential (Type-I), truncated (Type-II) or anti-truncated (Type-III)\nexponentials. Controlled formation simulations of isolated galaxies can\nreproduce all of these profile types by varying a single parameter, the initial\nhalo spin. In this paper we examine these simulations in more detail in an\neffort to identify the physical mechanism that leads to the formation of\nType-III profiles. The stars in the anti-truncated outskirts of such discs are\nnow on eccentric orbits, but were born on near-circular orbits at much smaller\nradii. We show that, and explain how, they were driven to the outskirts via\nnon-linear interactions with a strong and long-lived central bar, which greatly\nboosted their semi-major axis but also their eccentricity. While bars have been\nknown to cause radial heating and outward migration to stellar orbits, we link\nthis effect to the formation of Type-III profiles. This predicts that the\nanti-truncated parts of galaxies have unusual kinematics for disc-like stellar\nconfigurations: high radial velocity dispersions and slow net rotation. Whether\nsuch discs exist in nature, can be tested by future observations.\n", "  The small atmosphereless objects of our solar system, such as asteroids, the\nmoon are covered by layer of dust particles known as regolith, formed by\nmeteoritic impact. The light scattering studies of such dust layer by\nlaboratory experiment and numerical simulation are two important tools to\ninvestigate their physical properties. In the present work, the light scattered\nfrom a layer of dust particles, containing 0.3{\\mu}m Al2O3 at wavelength 632.8\nnm is analysed. This work has been performed by using a light scattering\ninstrument 'ellipsometer', at the Department of Physics, Assam Universiy,\nSilchar, India. Through this experiment, we generated in laboratory the\nphotometric and polarimetric phase curves of light scattered from such a layer.\nIn order to numerically simulate this data, we used Hapke's model combined with\nMie's single particle scattering properties. The perpendicular and parallel\ncomponents of single particle albedo and the phase function were derived from\nMie theory. By using the Hapke's model combined with Mie theory, the physical\nproperties of the dust grain such as grain size, optical constant (n,k) and\nwavelength can be studied through this scheme. In literature, till today no\ntheoretical model to represent polarisation caused due to scattering from rough\nsurface is available, which can successfully explain the scattering process. So\nthe main objective of this work is to develop a model which can theoretically\nestimate polarisation as caused due to scattering from rough surface and also\nto validate our model with the laboratory data generated in the present work.\n", "  Here we show an ultra-low noise regime of operation in a simple quantum\nmemory in warm Rb atomic vapor. By modelling the quantum dynamics of four-level\nroom temperature atoms, we achieve fidelities >90% for single-photon level\npolarization qubits, clearly surpassing any classical strategy exploiting the\nnon-unitary memory efficiency. This is the first time such important threshold\nhas been crossed with a room temperature device. Additionally we also show\nnovel experimental techniques capable of producing fidelities close to unity.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of simple, resource-moderate experimental\nroom temperature quantum devices.\n", "  Resonant x-ray scattering shows that the bulk structure of the twist-bend\nliquid crystal phase, recently discovered in bent molecular dimers, has spatial\nperiodicity without electron density modulation, indicating a lattice-free\nheliconical nematic precession of orientation that has helical glide symmetry.\nIn situ study of the bulk helix texture for the dimer CB7CB shows an\nelastically-confined temperature-dependent minimum helix pitch, but a\nremarkable elastic softness of pitch in response to dilative stresses.\nScattering from the helix is not detectable in the higher temperature nematic\nphase.\n", "  We investigate an inflationary model involving a gauge singlet scalar and\nfermionic dark matter. The mixing between the singlet scalar and the Higgs\nboson provides a portal to dark matter. The inflaton could either be the Higgs\nboson or the singlet scalar, and slow roll inflation is realized via its\nnon-minimal coupling to gravity. In this setup, the effective scalar potential\nis stabilized by the mixing between two scalars and coupling with dark matter.\nWe study constraints from collider searches, relic density and direct\ndetection, and find that dark matter mass should be around half the mass of\neither the Higgs boson or singlet scalar. Using the renormalization group\nequation improved scalar potential and putting all the constraints together, we\nshow that the inflationary observables $n_s-r$ are consistent with current\nPlanck data.\n", "  We bring a Bayesian approach to the analysis of clocks. Using exponential\ndistributions as priors for clocks, we analyze how well one can keep time with\na single qubit freely precessing under a magnetic field. We find that, at least\nwith a single qubit, quantum mechanics does not allow exact timekeeping, in\ncontrast to classical mechanics which does. We find the design of the\nsingle-qubit clock that leads to maximum accuracy. Further, we find an energy\nversus accuracy tradeoff --- the energy cost is at least $k_BT$ times the\nimprovement in accuracy as measured by the entropy reduction in going from the\nprior distribution to the posterior distribution. We propose a physical\nrealization of the single qubit clock using charge transport across a\ncapacitively-coupled quantum dot.\n", "  Continuous symmetries are believed to emerge at many quantum critical points\nin frustrated magnets. In this work, we study two candidates of this paradigm:\nthe transverse-field frustrated Ising model (TFFIM) on the triangle and the\nhoneycomb lattices. The former is the prototypical example of this paradigm,\nand the latter has recently been proposed as another realization. Our\nlarge-scale Monte Carlo simulation confirms that the quantum phase transition\n(QPT) in the triangle lattice TFFIM indeed hosts an emergent O(2) symmetry, but\nthat in the honeycomb lattice TFFIM is a first-order QPT and does not have an\nemergent continuous symmetry. Furthermore, our analysis of the order parameter\nhistogram reveals that such different behavior originates from the irrelevance\nand relevance of anisotropic terms near the QPT in the low-energy effective\ntheory of the two models. The comparison between theoretical analysis and\nnumerical simulation in this work paves the way for scrutinizing investigation\nof emergent continuous symmetry at classical and quantum phase transitions.\n", "  Boltzmann sampling based on Metropolis algorithm has been extensively used\nfor simulating a canonical ensemble. An estimate of a mechanical property, like\nenergy, of an equilibrium system, can be made by averaging over a large number\nmicrostates generated by Boltzmann Monte Carlo methods. However, a thermal\nproperty like entropy is not easily accessible to these methods. The reason is\nsimple. We can assign a numerical value for energy to each microstate. But we\ncan not assign a numerical value for entropy, to a microstate. Entropy is not a\nproperty associated with any single microstate.It is a collective property of\nallthe microstates. Toward calculating entropy and other thermal properties, a\nnon-Boltzmann Monte Carlo technique called Umbrella sampling was proposed in\nthe mid-seventies (of the last century). Umbrella sampling has since undergone\nseveral metamorphoses and we have now, multi-canonical Monte Carlo, entropic\nsampling, flat histogram methods, Wang-Landau algorithm {\\it etc.} This class\nof methods generates non-Boltzmann ensembles which are un-physical. However,\nphysical quantities can be calculated by un-weighting of the microstates of the\nentropic ensemble, followed by re-weighting to the desired physical ensemble.In\nthis talk I shall tellyou of a few non-Boltzmann Monte Carlo methods with\nemphasis on recent developments.\n", "  In the present work we study the effect of unparticle modified static\npotentials on the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. By using\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbation theory, we obtain the energy shift of the\nground state and we compare it with experimental data. Bounds on the unparticle\nenergy scale $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{U}$ as a function of the scaling dimension\n$d_\\mathcal{U}$ and the coupling constant $\\lambda$ are derived. We show that\nthere exists a parameter region where bounds on $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{U}$ are\nstringent, signalling that unparticles could be tested in atomic physics\nexperiments.\n", "  We construct the gravitational solution of the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model by\nintroducing a magnetic field on the flavor brane. With taking into account\ntheir backreaction, we re-solve the type IIA supergravity in the presence of\nthe magnetic field. Our calculation shows the gravitational solutions are\nmagnetic-dependent and analytic both in the bubble (confined) and black brane\n(deconfined) case. We study the dual field theory at the leading order in the\nratio of the number of flavors and colors, also in the Veneziano limit. Some\nphysical properties related to the hadronic physics in an external magnetic\nfield are discussed by using our confined backreaction solution\nholographically. We also investigate the thermodynamics and holographic\nrenormalization of this model in both phases by our solution. Since the\nbackreaction of the magnetic field is considered in our gravitational solution,\nit allows us to study the Hawking-Page transition with flavors and colors of\nthis model in the presence of the magnetic field. Finally we therefore obtain\nthe holographic phase diagram with the contributions from the flavors and the\nmagnetic field. Our holographic phase diagram is in agreement with lattice QCD\nresult qualitatively, which thus can be interpreted as the inhibition of\nconfinement or chirally broken symmetry by the magnetic field.\n", "  Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce localised oscillatory modulations in\nthe spectra of photon sources passing through astrophysical magnetic fields.\nUltra-deep Chandra observations of the Perseus cluster contain over $5 \\times\n10^5$ counts from the AGN of the central cluster galaxy NGC1275, and represent\na dataset of extraordinary quality for ALP searches. We use this dataset to\nsearch for X-ray spectral irregularities from the AGN. The absence of\nirregularities at the O(30%) level allows us to place leading constraints on\nthe ALP-photon mixing parameter $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma} \\lesssim 1.4 - 4.0 \\times\n10^{-12} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \\lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, depending on\nassumptions on the magnetic field realisation along the line of sight.\n", "  We revisit the nature of large dips in flux from extinction by dusty\ncircumstellar material that is observed by Kepler for many young stars in the\nUpper Sco and $\\rho$ Oph star formation regions. These young, low-mass \"dipper\"\nstars are known to have low accretion rates and primarily host moderately\nevolved dusty circumstellar disks. Young low mass stars often exhibit rotating\nstar spots that cause quasi-periodic photometric variations. We found no\nevidence for periods associated with the dips that are different from the star\nspot rotation period in spectrograms constructed from the light curves. The\nmaterial causing the dips in most of these light curves must be approximately\ncorotating with the star. We find that disk temperatures computed at the disk\ncorotation radius are cool enough that dust should not sublime. Crude estimates\nfor stellar magnetic field strengths and accretion rates are consistent with\nmagnetospheric truncation near the corotation radius. Magnetospheric truncation\nmodels can explain why the dips are associated with material near corotation\nand how dusty material is lifted out of the midplane to obscure the star which\nwould account for the large fraction of young low mass stars that are dippers.\nWe propose that variations in disk orientation angle, stellar magnetic field\ndipole tilt axis, and disk accretion rate are underlying parameters accounting\nfor differences in the dipper light curves.\n", "  We present a new method that enables the identification and analysis of both\ntransition and metastable conformational states from atomistic or\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Our algorithm is presented\nand studied by using both analytical and actual examples from MD simulations of\nthe helix-forming peptide Ala5, and of a larger system, the epidermal growth\nfactor receptor (EGFR) protein. In all cases, our method identifies\nautomatically the corresponding transition states and metastable conformations\nin an optimal way, with the input of a set of relevant coordinates, by\ncapturing accurately the intrinsic slowest relaxation rate. Our approach\nprovides a general and easy to implement analysis method that provides unique\ninsight into the molecular mechanism and the rare but crucial rate limiting\nconformational pathways occurring in complex dynamical systems such as\nmolecular trajectories.\n", "  Using transversal gates is a straightforward and efficient technique for\nfault-tolerant quantum computing. Since transversal gates alone cannot be\ncomputationally universal, they must be combined with other approaches such as\nmagic state distillation, code switching or code concatenation in order to\nachieve universality. In this paper we propose an alternative approach for\nuniversal fault-tolerant quantum computing mainly based on the code\nconcatenation approach proposed in [PRL 112, 010505 (2014)] but in a\nnon-uniform fashion. The proposed approach is described based on non-uniform\nconcatenation of the 7-qubit Steane code with the 15-qubit Reed-Muller code as\nwell as the 5-qubit code with the 15-qubit Reed-Muller code, which lead to two\n49-qubit and 47-qubit codes, respectively. These codes can correct any\narbitrary single physical error with the ability to perform a universal set of\nfault-tolerant gates, without using magic state distillation.\n", "  We present a silicon optical transmitter for polarization-encoded quantum key\ndistribution (QKD). The chip was fabricated in a standard silicon photonic\nfoundry process and integrated a pulse generator, intensity modulator, variable\noptical attenuator, and polarization modulator in a 1.3 mm $\\times$ 3 mm die\narea. The devices in the photonic circuit meet the requirements for QKD. The\ntransmitter was used in a proof-of-concept demonstration of the BB84 QKD\nprotocol over a 5 km long fiber link.\n", "  In this work we have discussed the implications of shear-free condition on\naxially symmetric anisotropic gravitating objects in $f(R,T)$ theory.\nRestricted axial symmetry ignoring rotation and reflection enteries is taken\ninto account for establishment of instability range. Implementation of linear\nperturbation on constitutive modified dynamical equations yield evolution\nequation. This equation associates adiabatic index $\\Gamma$ with material and\ndark source components defining stable and unstable regions in Newtonian (N)\nand post-Newtonian (pN) approximations.\n", "  The question of thermalisation in closed quantum many-body systems has\nreceived a lot of attention in the past few years. An intimately related\nquestion is whether a closed quantum system shows irreversible dynamics.\nHowever, irreversibility and what we actually mean by this in a quantum\nmany-body system with unitary dynamics has been explored very little. In this\nwork we investigate the dynamics of the Ising model in a transverse magnetic\nfield involving an imperfect effective time reversal. We propose a definition\nof irreversibility based on the echo peak decay of observables. Inducing the\neffective time reversal by different protocols we find algebraic decay of the\necho peak heights or an ever persisting echo peak indicating that the dynamics\nin this model is well reversible.\n", "  Certain non-uniformly coupled spin chains can exhibit perfect transfer of\nquantum states from end to end. Motivated by recent experimental\nimplementations, we extend the simplest such chain to next-to-nearest neighbour\n(NNN) couplings. It is shown analytically that perfect state transfer can be\nmaintained under the extension and that end-to-end entanglement generation\n(fractional revival) can occur.\n", "  We consider the supermultiplet of linearized beta-deformation of\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills(SYM). It was previously studied on the\ngravitational side. We study the supermultiplet of beta-deformations on the\nfield theory side and we compare two finite-dimensional representations of\n$psl(4|4,\\bf{R})$ algebra. We show that they are related by an intertwining\noperator. We develop a twistor-based approach which could be useful for\nstudying other finite-dimensional and nonunitary representations in AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence.\n", "  People usually get involved in multiple social networks to enjoy new services\nor to fulfill their needs. Many new social networks try to attract users of\nother existing networks to increase the number of their users. Once a user\n(called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new\nsocial network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor\nlink) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we\nconcentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between\nheterogeneous social networks. Unlike conventional link prediction problems in\nwhich the formation of a link between two existing users within a single\nnetwork is predicted, in anchor link prediction, the target user is missing and\nwill be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve\nthis problem, we use meta-paths as a powerful tool for utilizing heterogeneous\ninformation in both the source and target networks. To this end, we propose an\neffective general meta-path-based approach called Connector and Recursive\nMeta-Paths (CRMP). By using those two different categories of meta-paths, we\nmodel different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join\nthe target network, resulting in the formation of a new anchor link. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world heterogeneous social networks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method against the recent methods.\n", "  The coupling of laser light to a mechanical oscillator via radiation pressure\nleads to the emergence of quantum mechanical correlations between the amplitude\nand phase quadrature of the laser beam. These correlations form a generic\nnon-classical resource which can be employed for quantum-enhanced force\nmetrology, and give rise to ponderomotive squeezing in the limit of strong\ncorrelations. To date, this resource has only been observed in a handful of\ncryogenic cavity optomechanical experiments. Here, we demonstrate the ability\nto efficiently resolve optomechanical quantum correlations imprinted on an\noptical laser field interacting with a room temperature nanomechanical\noscillator. Direct measurement of the optical field in a detuned homodyne\ndetector (\"variational measurement\") at frequencies far from the resonance\nfrequency of the oscillator reveal quantum correlations at the few percent\nlevel. We demonstrate how the absolute visibility of these correlations can be\nused for a quantum-enhanced estimation of the quantum back-action force acting\non the oscillator, and provides for an enhancement in the relative\nsignal-to-noise ratio for the estimation of an off-resonant external force,\neven at room temperature.\n", "  We report on the computational development of novel architectures of low\nimpedance broadband antennas, for efficient detection of Terahertz (THz)\nfrequency beams. The conceived Split Ring Resonator Resonance Assisted (SRR RA)\nantennas are based on both a capacitive and inductive scheme, exploiting a 200\nOhm and 400 Ohm impedance, respectively. Moreover, the impedance is tunable by\nvarying the coupling parameters in the exploited geometry, allowing for better\nmatching with the detector circuit for maximum power extraction. Our simulation\nresults have been obtained by assuming a 1.5 THz operation frequency.\n", "  This paper reports on the computational development of novel architectures of\nmulti-resonance Split Ring Resonators (SRRs), for efficient manipulation of\nTerahertz (THz) frequency beams. The conceived resonators are based on both a\ncapacitive and inductive scheme. Simulation results have been obtained for a 60\nGHz to 240 GHz operational bandwidth.\n", "  Current quantum technology is approaching the system sizes and fidelities\nrequired for quantum error correction. It is therefore important to determine\nexactly what is needed for proof-of-principle experiments, which will be the\nfirst major step towards fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we propose a\nsurface code based experiment that is the smallest, both in terms of code size\nand circuit depth, that would allow errors to be detected and corrected for\nboth the $X$ and $Z$ basis of a qubit. This requires $17$ physical qubits\ninitially prepared in a product state, on which $16$ two-qubit entangling gates\nare applied before a final measurement of all qubits. A platform agnostic error\nmodel is applied to give some idea of the noise levels required for success. It\nis found that a true demonstration of quantum error correction will require\nfidelities for the preparation and measurement of qubits and the entangling\ngates to be above $99\\%$.\n", "  Combining analysis from phonon signals and photon signals can powerfully\nreduce backgrounds for bolometer-based rare event searches. Anti-reflective\ncoatings can significantly increase the performance of the secondary\nlight-sensing bolometer in these experiments. As a first step toward these\nimprovements, coatings of SiO$_2$, HfO$_2$, and TiO$_2$ on Ge and Si wafers\nwere fabricated and characterized at room temperature and multiple angles of\nincidence.\n", "  Applied network science often involves preprocessing network data before\napplying a network-analysis method, and there is typically a theoretical\ndisconnect between these steps. For example, it is common to aggregate\ntime-varying network data into windows prior to analysis, and the tradeoffs of\nthis preprocessing are not well understood. Focusing on the problem of\ndetecting small communities in multilayer networks, we study the effects of\nlayer aggregation by developing random-matrix theory for modularity matrices\nassociated with layer-aggregated networks with $N$ nodes and $L$ layers, which\nare drawn from an ensemble of Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks. We study phase\ntransitions in which eigenvectors localize onto communities (allowing their\ndetection) and which occur for a given community provided its size surpasses a\ndetectability limit $K^*$. When layers are aggregated via a summation, we\nobtain $K^*\\varpropto \\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{NL}/T)$, where $T$ is the number of\nlayers across which the community persists. Interestingly, if $T$ is allowed to\nvary with $L$ then summation-based layer aggregation enhances small-community\ndetection even if the community persists across a vanishing fraction of layers,\nprovided that $T/L$ decays more slowly than $ \\mathcal{O}(L^{-1/2})$. Moreover,\nwe find that thresholding the summation can in some cases cause $K^*$ to decay\nexponentially, decreasing by orders of magnitude in a phenomenon we call\nsuper-resolution community detection. That is, layer aggregation with\nthresholding is a nonlinear data filter enabling detection of communities that\nare otherwise too small to detect. Importantly, different thresholds generally\nenhance the detectability of communities having different properties,\nillustrating that community detection can be obscured if one analyzes network\ndata using a single threshold.\n", "  For the first time, a direct detection BOTDR is demonstrated for distributed\ndynamic strain sensing incorporating double-edge technique, time-division\nmultiplexing technique and upconversion technique. The double edges are\nrealized by using the transmission curve and reflection curve of an all-fiber\nFabry-Perot interferometer (FPI). Benefiting from the low loss of the fiber at,\nthe time-division multiplexing technique is performed to realize the\ndouble-edge technique by using only a single-channel FPI and only one piece of\na detector. In order to detect the weak spontaneous Brillouin backscattering\nsignal efficiently, a fiber-coupled upconversion detector is adopted to\nupconvert the backscattering signal at 1548.1 nm to 863 nm, which is detected\nby a Si-APD finally. In the experiment, dynamic strain disturbance up to\n1.9m{\\epsilon} over 1.5 km of polarization maintaining fiber is detected at a\nsampling rate of 30 Hz. An accuracy of 30{\\mu}{\\epsilon} and spatial resolution\nof 0.6 m is realized.\n", "  The costs associated to the length of links impose unavoidable constraints to\nthe growth of natural and artificial transport networks. When future network\ndevelopments can not be predicted, building and maintenance costs require\ncompeting minimization mechanisms, and can not be optimized simultaneously.\nHereby, we study the interplay of building and maintenance costs and its impact\non the growth of transportation networks through a non-equilibrium model of\nnetwork growth. We show cost balance is a sufficient ingredient for the\nemergence of tradeoffs between the network's total length and transport\neffciency, of optimal strategies of construction, and of power-law temporal\ncorrelations in the growth history of the network. Analysis of empirical ant\ntransport networks in the framework of this model suggests different ant\nspecies may adopt similar optimization strategies.\n", "  The light-matter quantum interface that can create quantum-correlations or\nentanglement between a photon and one atomic collective excitation is a\nfundamental building block for a quantum repeater. The intrinsic limit is that\nthe probability of preparing such non-classical atom-photon correlations has to\nbe kept low in order to suppress multi-excitation. To enhance this probability\nwithout introducing multi-excitation errors, a promising scheme is to apply\nmultimode memories into the interface. Significant progresses have been made in\ntemporal, spectral, and spatial multiplexing memories, but the enhanced\nprobability for generating the entangled atom-photon pair has not been\nexperimentally realized. Here, by using 6 spin-wave-photon entanglement\nsources, a switching network and feed-forward control, we build a multiplexed\nlight-matter interface and then demonstrate a ~6-fold (~4-fold) probability\nincrease in generating entangled atom-photon (photon-photon) pairs. The\nmeasured compositive Bell parameter for the multiplexed interface is 2.49+-0.03\ncombined with a memory lifetime of up to ~60 microseconds.\n", "  Some time-reversal symmetric topological orders are anomalous in that they\ncannot be realized in strictly two-dimensions without breaking time reversal\nsymmetry; instead, they can only be realized on the surface of certain\nthree-dimensional systems. We propose two quantities, which we call {\\it\nanomaly indicators}, that can detect if a time-reversal symmetric topological\norder is anomalous in this sense. Both anomaly indicators are expressed in\nterms of the quantum dimensions, topological spins, and time-reversal\nproperties of the anyons in the given topological order. The first indicator,\n$\\eta_2$, applies to bosonic systems while the second indicator, $\\eta_f$,\napplies to fermionic systems in the DIII class. We conjecture that $\\eta_2$,\ntogether with a previously known indicator $\\eta_1$, can detect the two known\n$\\mathbb Z_2$ anomalies in the bosonic case, while $\\eta_f$ can detect the\n$\\mathbb Z_{16}$ anomaly in the fermionic case.\n", "  Quantum systems, in general, output data that cannot be simulated efficiently\nby a classical computer, and hence is useful for solving certain mathematical\nproblems and simulating quantum many-body systems. This also implies,\nunfortunately, that verification of the output of the quantum systems is not so\ntrivial, since predicting the output is exponentially hard. As another problem,\nquantum system is very delicate for noise and thus needs error correction. Here\nwe propose a framework for verification of the output of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation in the measurement-based model. Contrast to existing analyses on\nfault-tolerance, we do not assume any noise model on the resource state, but an\narbitrary resource state is tested by using only single-qubit measurements to\nverify whether the output of measurement-based quantum computation on it is\ncorrect or not. The overhead for verification including classical processing is\nlinear in the size of quantum computation. Since full characterization of\nquantum noise is exponentially hard for large-scale quantum computing systems,\nour framework provides an efficient way of practical verification of\nexperimental quantum error correction. Moreover, the proposed verification\nscheme is also compatible to measurement-only blind quantum computation, where\na client can accept the delegated quantum computation even when a quantum sever\nmakes deviation, as long as the output is correct.\n", "  Epidemics, neural cascades, power failures, and many other phenomena can be\ndescribed by a diffusion process on a network. To identify the causal origins\nof a spread, it is often necessary to identify the triggering initial node.\nHere we define a new morphological operator and use it to detect the origin of\na diffusive front, given the final state of a complex network. Our method\nperforms better than randomized trials as well as centrality based methods.\nMore importantly, our method is applicable regardless of the specifics of the\nforward model, and therefore can be applied to a wide range of systems such as\nidentifying the patient zero in an epidemic, pinpointing the neuron that\ntriggers a cascade, identifying the original malfunction that causes a\ncatastrophic infrastructure failure, and inferring the ancestral species from\nwhich a heterogeneous population evolves.\n", "  We analyze heating and cooling processes in an idealized simulation of a\ncool-core cluster, where momentum-driven AGN feedback balances radiative\ncooling in a time-averaged sense. We find that, on average, energy dissipation\nvia shock waves is almost an order of magnitude higher than via turbulence.\nMost of the shock waves in the simulation are very weak shocks with Mach\nnumbers smaller than 1.5, but the stronger shocks, although rare, dissipate\nenergy more effectively. We find that shock dissipation is a steep function of\nradius, with most of the energy dissipated within 30 kpc, while radiative\ncooling loses area less concentrated. However, adiabatic processes and mixing\n(of post-shock materials and the surrounding gas) are able to redistribute the\nheat throughout the core. A considerable fraction of the AGN energy also\nescapes the core region. The cluster goes through cycles of AGN outbursts\naccompanied by periods of enhanced precipitation and star formation, over Gyr\ntimescales. The cluster core is under-heated at the end of each cycle, but\nover-heated at the peak of the AGN outburst. During the heating-dominant phase,\nturbulent dissipation alone is often able to balance radiative cooling at every\nradius but, when this is occurs, shock waves inevitably dissipate even more\nenergy. Our simulation explains why some clusters, such as Abell 2029, are\ncooling dominated, while in some other clusters, such as Perseus, various\nheating mechanisms including shock heating, turbulent dissipation and bubble\nmixing can all individually balance cooling, and together, overheat the core.\n", "  Despite decades of effort, the timing and duration of He II reionization, as\nwell as its morphology and the properties of the quasars believed to drive it,\nare still not well constrained. In this paper we present a new method to study\nboth He II reionization and quasars via the thermal proximity effect -- the\nphotoelectric heating of the intergalactic medium around quasars when their\nhard radiation doubly ionizes helium. We post-process a SPH simulation with 1D\nradiative calculations, and study how the thermal proximity effect depends on\nthe amount of singly ionized helium, $x_{\\rm HeII,0}$, which prevailed in the\nIGM before the quasar turned on, and the characteristic lifetime $t_{\\rm Q}$\nfor which quasars shine. We find that the amplitude of the temperature boost in\nthe quasar environment depends on $x_{\\rm HeII,0}$, with a characteristic value\nof $\\Delta T \\simeq 10^4\\,{\\rm K}$ for an initially singly ionized IGM ($x_{\\rm\nHeII,0} = 1.0$), whereas the size of the thermal proximity zone is sensitive to\nquasar lifetime $t_{\\rm Q}$, with typical sizes of ~100 cMpc for luminous\nquasars shining for $t_{\\rm Q}=10^8$ yr. This temperature boost is manifest as\na change in the thermal broadening of H I absorption lines near the quasar. We\nintroduce a new method based on measuring the Ly$\\alpha$ forest power spectrum\nas a function of distance from the quasar, and conduct Bayesian MCMC analysis\nto demonstrate that the thermal proximity effect should be easily detectable.\nFor a mock dataset of 50 quasars at z~4, we predict that one can measure\n$x_{\\rm HeII,0}$ to a precision $\\approx 0.04$, and $t_{\\rm Q}$ to a precision\nof $\\approx 0.1$ dex. By applying our formalism to existing high-resolution\nLy$\\alpha$ forest spectra of quasars at $3.1 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.0$, one\nshould be able to detect the thermal proximity effect, and reconstruct the full\nreionization history of He II.\n", "  We present the analysis of the morphological shape of Berkeley 17, the oldest\nknown open cluster (~10 Gyr), using a probabilistic star counting of Pan-STARRS\npoint sources, and confirm its core-tail shape, plus an antitail, previously\ndetected with the 2MASS data. The stellar population, as diagnosed by the\ncolor-magnitude diagram and theoretical isochrones, shows many massive members\nin the cluster core, whereas there is a paucity of such members in both tails.\nThis manifests mass segregation in this aged star cluster with the low-mass\nmembers being stripped away from the system. It has been claimed that Berkeley\n17 is associated with an excessive number of blue straggler candidates.\nComparison of nearby reference fields indicates that about half of these may be\nfield contamination.\n", "  While the presence of a light stop is increasingly disfavored by the\nexperimental limits set on R-parity conserving scenarios, the naturalness of\nsupersymmetry could still be safely concealed in the more challenging final\nstates predicted by the existence of non-null R-parity violating couplings.\nAlthough R-parity violating signatures are extensively looked for at the Large\nHadron Collider, these searches always assume 100\\% branching ratios for the\ndirect decays of supersymmetric particles into Standard Model ones. In this\npaper we scrutinize the implications of relaxing this assumption by focusing on\none motivated scenario where the lightest stop is heavier than a chargino and a\nneutralino. Considering a class of R-parity baryon number violating couplings,\nwe show on general grounds that while the direct decay of the stop into\nStandard Model particles is dominant for large values of these couplings,\nsmaller values give rise, instead, to the dominance of a plethora of longer\ndecay chains and richer final states that have not yet been analyzed at the\nLHC, thus weakening the impact of the present experimental stop mass limits. We\ncharacterize the case for R-parity baryon number violating couplings in the\n$10^{-7} - 10^{-1}$ range, in two different benchmark points scenarios within\nthe model-independent setting of the low-energy phenomenological Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model. We identify the different relevant experimental\nsignatures, estimate the corresponding proton--proton cross sections at\n$\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and discuss signal versus background issues.\n", "  The sensing capability of a single optically bright electronic spin in\ndiamond can be enhanced by making use of proximal dark nuclei as ancillary\nspins. Such systems, so far only realized in bulk diamond, provide orders of\nmagnitude higher sensitivity and spectral resolution in the case of magnetic\nsensing, as well as improved readout fidelity and state storage time in quantum\ninformation schemes. In nanodiamonds, which offer additional opportunities as\nmobile nanoscale sensors, electronic-nuclear spin complexes have remained\ninaccessible. We demonstrate coherent control of a 13C nuclear spin located\n4{\\AA} from a nitrogen-vacancy center in a nanodiamond and show quantum-state\ntransfer between the two components of this hybrid spin system. We extract a\nnuclear-spin free precession time of T2* = 26 us, which exceeds the bare\nelectron free precession time in nanodiamond by two orders of magnitude.\n", "  We propose a novel scheme to efficiently tune the scattering length of two\ncolliding ground-state atoms by off-resonantly coupling the scattering-state to\nan excited Rydberg-molecular state using laser light. For the s-wave scattering\nof two colliding ${^{87}}\\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, we demonstrate that the effective\noptical length and pole strength of this Rydberg optical Feshbach resonance can\nbe tuned over several orders of magnitude, while incoherent processes and\nlosses are minimised. Given the ubiquity of Rydberg molecular states, this\ntechnique should be generally applicable to homo-nuclear atomic pairs as well\nas to atomic mixtures with s-wave (or even p-wave) scattering.\n", "  A general Hamiltonian wave system with quartic resonances is considered, in\nthe standard kinetic limit of a continuum of weakly interacting dispersive\nwaves with random phases. The evolution equation for the multimode\ncharacteristic function $Z$ is obtained within an \"interaction representation\"\nand a perturbation expansion in the small nonlinearity parameter. A frequency\nrenormalization is performed to remove linear terms that do not appear in the\n3-wave case. Feynman-Wyld diagrams are used to average over phases, leading to\na first order differential evolution equation for $Z$. A hierarchy of\nequations, analogous to the Boltzmann hierarchy for low density gases is\nderived, which preserves in time the property of random phases and amplitudes.\nThis amounts to a general formalism for both the $N$-mode and the 1-mode PDF\nequations for 4-wave turbulent systems, suitable for numerical simulations and\nfor investigating intermittency.\n", "  Measurements of strong gravitational lensing jointly with type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia) observations have been used to test the validity of the cosmic\ndistance duality relation (CDDR), $D_L(z)/[(1+z)^2D_A(z)]=\\eta=1$, where\n$D_L(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ are the luminosity and the angular diameter distances to\na given redshift $z$, respectively. However, several lensing systems lie in the\ninterval $1.4 \\leq z \\leq 3.6$ i.e., beyond the redshift range of current SNe\nIa compilations ($z \\approx 1.50$), which prevents this kind of test to be\nfully explored. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by testing the CDDR\nconsidering observations of strong gravitational lensing along with SNe Ia and\n{ a subsample from} the latest gamma-ray burst distance modulus data, whose\nredshift range is $0.033 \\leq z \\leq 9.3$. { We parameterize their luminosity\ndistances with a second degree polynomial function and search for possible\ndeviations from the CDDR validity by using four different $\\eta(z)$ functions:\n$\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$, $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$, $\\eta(z)=(1+z)^{\\eta_0}$ and\n$\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Unlike previous tests done at redshifts lower than\n$1.50$, the likelihood for $\\eta_0$ depends strongly on the $\\eta(z)$ function\nconsidered, but we find no significant deviation from the CDDR validity\n($\\eta_0=0$). However, our analyses also point to the fact that caution is\nneeded when one fits data in higher redshifts to test the CDDR as well as a\nbetter understanding of the mass distribution of lenses also is required for\nmore accurate results.\n", "  Satellite based quantum communication has been proven as a feasible way to\nachieve global scale quantum communication network. Very recently, a\nlow-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite has been launched for this purpose. However,\nwith a single satellite, it takes an inefficient 3-day period to provide the\nworldwide connectivity. On the other hand, similar to how the Iridium system\nfunctions in classic communication, satellite constellation (SC) composed of\nmany quantum satellites, could provide global real-time quantum communication.\nIn such a SC, most of the satellites will work in sunlight. Unfortunately, none\nof previous ground testing experiments could be implemented at daytime. During\ndaytime, the bright sunlight background prohibits quantum communication in\ntransmission over long distances. In this letter, by choosing a working\nwavelength of 1550 nm and developing free-space single-mode fibre coupling\ntechnology and ultralow noise up-conversion single photon detectors, we\novercome the noise due to sunlight and demonstrate a 53-km free space quantum\nkey distribution (QKD) in the daytime through a 48-dB loss channel. Our system\nnot only shows the feasibility of satellite based quantum communication in\ndaylight, but also has the ability to naturally adapt to ground fibre optics,\nrepresenting an essential step towards a SC-based global quantum network.\n", "  The ejecta composition is an open question in gamma-ray bursts (GRB) physics.\nSome GRBs possess a quasi-thermal spectral component in the time-resolved\nspectral analysis, suggesting a hot fireball origin. Others show a featureless\nnon-thermal spectrum known as the \"Band\" function, consistent with a\nsynchrotron radiation origin and suggesting that the jet is\nPoynting-flux-dominated at the central engine and likely in the emission region\nas well. There are also bursts showing a sub-dominant thermal component and a\ndominant synchrotron component suggesting a likely hybrid jet composition. Here\nwe report an extraordinarily bright GRB 160625B, simultaneously observed in\ngamma-rays and optical wavelengths, whose prompt emission consists of three\nisolated episodes separated by long quiescent intervals, with the durations of\neach \"sub-burst\" being $\\sim$ 0.8 s, 35 s, and 212 s, respectively. Its high\nbrightness (with isotropic peak luminosity L$_{\\rm p, iso}\\sim 4\\times 10^{53}$\nerg/s) allows us to conduct detailed time-resolved spectral analysis in each\nepisode, from precursor to main burst and to extended emission. The spectral\nproperties of the first two sub-bursts are distinctly different, allowing us to\nobserve the transition from thermal to non-thermal radiation between\nwell-separated emission episodes within a single GRB. Such a transition is a\nclear indication of the change of jet composition from a fireball to a\nPoynting-flux-dominated jet.\n", "  Creation of Cold Dark Matter (CCDM), in the context of Einstein Field\nEquations, leads to negative creation pressure, which can be used to explain\nthe accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work we tested six different\nspatially flat models for matter creation using statistical tools, at light of\nSN Ia data: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion\n(BIC) and Bayesian Evidence (BE). These approaches allow to compare models\nconsidering goodness of fit and number of free parameters, penalizing excess of\ncomplexity. We find that JO model is slightly favoured over LJO/$\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel, however, neither of these, nor $\\Gamma=3\\alpha H_0$ model can be\ndiscarded from the current analysis. Three other scenarios are discarded either\nfrom poor fitting, either from excess of free parameters.\n", "  We introduce the concept of transport waves by showing that the linearized\nBoltzmann transport equation admits excitations in the form of waves that have\nwell defined dispersion relations and decay times. Crucially, these waves do\nnot represent single-particle excitations, but are collective excitations of\nthe equilibrium distribution functions. We study in detail the case of thermal\ntransport, where relaxons are found in the long-wavelength limit, and second\nsound is reinterpreted as the excitation of one or several temperature waves at\nfinite frequencies. Graphene is studied numerically, finding decay times of the\norder of microseconds. The derivation, obtained by a spectral representation of\nthe Boltzmann equation, holds in principle for any crystal or semiclassical\ntransport theory and is particularly relevant when transport takes place in the\nhydrodynamic regime.\n", "  We unify two widely different approaches to understanding the infrared\nbehaviour of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), one essentially phenomenological,\nbased on data, and the other computational, realised via quantum field\nequations in the continuum theory. Using the latter, we explain and calculate a\nprocess-independent running-coupling for QCD, a new type of effective charge\nthat is an analogue of the Gell-Mann--Low effective coupling in quantum\nelectrodynamics. The result is almost identical to the process-dependent\neffective charge defined via the Bjorken sum rule, which provides one of the\nmost basic constraints on our knowledge of nucleon spin structure. This reveals\nthe Bjorken sum to be a near direct means by which to gain empirical insight\ninto QCD's Gell-Mann--Low effective charge.\n", "  We observed two eclipses of the Kepler-13A planetary system, on UT 2014 April\n28 and UT 2014 October 13, in the near-infrared using Wide Field Camera 3 on\nthe Hubble Space Telescope. By using the nearby binary stars Kepler-13BC as a\nreference, we were able to create a differential light curve for Kepler-13A\nthat had little of the systematics typically present in HST/WFC3\nspectrophotometry. We measure a broadband (1.1$\\mu$m to 1.65$\\mu$m) eclipse\ndepth of $734\\pm28$ ppm, and are able to measure the emission spectrum of the\nplanet at $R\\approx50$ with an average precision of 70 ppm. We find that\nKepler-13Ab possesses a noninverted, monotonically decreasing vertical\ntemperature profile. We exclude an isothermal profile and an inverted profile\nat more than 3$\\sigma$. We also find that the dayside emission of Kepler-13Ab\nappears generally similar to an isolated M7 brown dwarf at a similar effective\ntemperature. Due to the relatively high mass and surface gravity of\nKepler-13Ab, we suggest that the apparent lack of an inversion is due to\ncold-trap processes in the planet's atmosphere. Using a toy model for where\ncold-traps should inhibit inversions, and observations of other planets in this\ntemperature range with measured emission spectra, we argue that with more\ndetailed modeling and more observations we may be able to place useful\nconstraints on the size of condensates on the daysides of hot Jupiters.\n", "  The linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations describe the evolution of\nperturbations in the universe and its numerical solutions play a central role\nin cosmology. We revisit this system of differential equations and present a\ndetailed investigation of its mathematical properties. For this purpose, we\nfocus on a simplified set of equations aimed at describing the broad features\nof the matter power spectrum. We first perform an eigenvalue analysis and study\nthe onset of oscillations in the system signaled by the transition from real to\ncomplex eigenvalues. We then provide a stability criterion of different\nnumerical schemes for this linear system and estimate the associated step-size.\nWe elucidate the stiffness property of the Einstein-Boltzmann system and show\nhow it can be characterized in terms of the eigenvalues. While the parameters\nof the system are time dependent making it non-autonomous, we define an\nadiabatic regime where the parameters vary slowly enough for the system to be\nquasi-autonomous. We summarize the different regimes of the system for these\ndifferent criteria as function of wave number $k$ and scale factor $a$. We also\nprovide a compendium of analytic solutions for all perturbation variables in 6\nlimits on the $k$-$a$ plane and express them explicitly in terms of initial\nconditions. These results are aimed to help the further development and testing\nof numerical cosmological Boltzmann solvers.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics for a two level atomic system entangled to\ncoherent states using the recently developed mode invisibility technique. Using\na quantum 2-level probe, we demonstrate a way to non-destructively measure a\nnumber of properties between a qubit entangled with a generalized CAT state,\nincluding the amplitude of the coherent state, the location and relative\nexcitation of the qubit, and the von Neumann entropy. Our results indicate a\nconnection between this last quantity and the interferometric phase shift of\nthe probe, thereby suggesting a possible way to experimentally measure\nentanglement non-destructively.\n", "  We propose a model for the formation of chromatin loops based on the\ndiffusive sliding of a DNA-bound factor which can dimerise to form a molecular\nslip-link. Our slip-links mimic the behaviour of cohesin-like molecules, which,\nalong with the CTCF protein, stabilize loops which organize the genome. By\ncombining 3D Brownian dynamics simulations and 1D exactly solvable\nnon-equilibrium models, we show that diffusive sliding is sufficient to account\nfor the strong bias in favour of convergent CTCF-mediated chromosome loops\nobserved experimentally. Importantly, our model does not require any\nunderlying, and energetically costly, motor activity of cohesin. We also find\nthat the diffusive motion of multiple slip-links along chromatin may be\nrectified by an intriguing ratchet effect that arises if slip-links bind to the\nchromatin at a preferred \"loading site\". This emergent collective behaviour is\ndriven by a 1D osmotic pressure which is set up near the loading point, and\nfavours the extrusion of loops which are much larger than the ones formed by\nsingle slip-links.\n", "  From exploratory studies and theoretical expectations it is known that\nsimplifying approximations in spectroscopic analysis (LTE, 1D) lead to\nsystematic biases of stellar parameters and abundances. These biases depend\nstrongly on surface gravity, temperature, and, in particular, for LTE vs.\nnon-LTE (NLTE) on metallicity of the stars. Here we analyse the [Mg/Fe] and\n[Fe/H] plane of a sample of 326 stars, comparing LTE and NLTE results obtained\nusing 1D hydrostatic models and averaged <3D> models. We show that compared to\nthe <3D>NLTE benchmark, all other three methods display increasing biases\ntowards lower metallicities, resulting in false trends of [Mg/Fe] against\n[Fe/H], which have profound implications for interpretations by chemical\nevolution models. In our best <3D> NLTE model, the halo and disc stars show a\nclearer behaviour in the [Mg/Fe] - [Fe/H] plane, from the knee in abundance\nspace down to the lowest metallicities. Our sample has a large fraction of\nthick disc stars and this population extends down to at least [Fe/H] ~ -1.6\ndex, further than previously proven. The thick disc stars display a constant\n[Mg/Fe] ~ 0.3 dex, with a small intrinsic dispersion in [Mg/Fe] that suggests\nthat a fast SN Ia channel is not relevant for the disc formation. The halo\nstars reach higher [Mg/Fe] ratios and display a net trend of [Mg/Fe] at low\nmetallicities, paired with a large dispersion in [Mg/Fe]. These indicate the\ndiverse origin of halo stars from accreted low-mass systems to\nstochastic/inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the Galactic halo.\n", "  Global conformal invariance determines the form of two and three-point\nfunctions of quasi-primary operators in a conformal field theory, and generates\nnontrivial relations between terms in the operator product expansion. These\nideas are generalized to the principal and complementary series\nrepresentations, which play an important role in the conjectured dS/CFT\ncorrespondence. The conformal partial wave expansions are constructed for these\nrepresentations which in turn determine the operator product expansion. This\nleads us to conclude that conformal field theories containing such\nrepresentations have essential singularities, so cannot be realized as\nconventional field theories.\n", "  The origin of the electronic nematicity and its remarkable\nmaterial-dependence are famous longstanding unsolved issues in Fe-based\nsuperconductors. To attack these issues, we focus on the in-plane anisotropy of\nthe resistivity: In the nematic state in FeSe, the relation $\\rho_x>\\rho_y$\nholds, where $\\rho_{x(y)}$ is the resistivity along the longer (shorter) Fe-Fe\naxis. In contrast, the opposite anisotropy $\\rho_x<\\rho_y$ is realized in other\nundoped Fe-based superconductors. Such nontrivial material dependence is\nnaturally explained in terms of the strongly orbital-dependent inelastic\nquasiparticle scattering realized in the orbital-ordered state. The opposite\nanisotropy between FeSe ($\\rho_x>\\rho_y$) and other undoped compounds\n($\\rho_x<\\rho_y$) reflects the difference in the number of hole-pockets. We\nalso explain the large in-plane anisotropy of the thermoelectric power in the\nnematic state.\n", "  We explore the possibility that scale symmetry is a quantum symmetry that is\nbroken only spontaneously and apply this idea to the Standard Model (SM). We\ncompute the quantum corrections to the potential of the higgs field ($\\phi$) in\nthe classically scale invariant version of the SM ($m_\\phi=0$ at tree level)\nextended by the dilaton ($\\sigma$). The tree-level potential of $\\phi$ and\n$\\sigma$, dictated by scale invariance, may contain non-polynomial effective\noperators, e.g. $\\phi^6/\\sigma^2$, $\\phi^8/\\sigma^4$, $\\phi^{10}/\\sigma^6$,\netc. The one-loop scalar potential is scale invariant, since the loop\ncalculations manifestly preserve the scale symmetry, with the DR subtraction\nscale $\\mu$ generated spontaneously by the dilaton vev\n$\\mu\\sim\\langle\\sigma\\rangle$. The Callan-Symanzik equation of the potential is\nverified in the presence of the gauge, Yukawa and the non-polynomial operators.\nThe couplings of the non-polynomial operators have non-zero beta functions that\nwe can actually compute from the quantum potential. At the quantum level the\nhiggs mass is protected by spontaneously broken scale symmetry, even though the\ntheory is non-renormalizable. We compare the one-loop potential to its\ncounterpart computed in the \"traditional\" DR scheme that breaks scale symmetry\nexplicitly ($\\mu=$constant) in the presence at the tree level of the\nnon-polynomial operators.\n", "  The four-dimensional (4D) Lorentz group $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ acts as the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) global conformal group on the celestial sphere at infinity\nwhere asymptotic 4D scattering states are specified. Consequent similarities of\n4D flat space amplitudes and 2D correlators on the conformal sphere are\nobscured by the fact that the former are usually expressed in terms of\nasymptotic wavefunctions which transform simply under spacetime translations\nrather than the Lorentz $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$. In this paper we construct on-shell\nmassive scalar wavefunctions in 4D Minkowski space that transform as\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ conformal primaries. Scattering amplitudes of these\nwavefunctions are $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ covariant by construction. For certain\nmass relations, we show explicitly that their three-point amplitude reduces to\nthe known unique form of a 2D CFT primary three-point function and compute the\ncoefficient. The computation proceeds naturally via Witten-like diagrams on a\nhyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space and has a holographic flavor.\n", "  The primordial non-Gaussianity induces scale-dependent bias of the \\hi with\nrespect to the underlying dark matter, which exhibits features on the very\nlarge scales of the 21-cm power spectrum potentially observable with \\hi\nintensity mapping observations. We forecast the prospective constraints on the\nfour fundamental shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity (local, equilateral,\northogonal, and enfolded), with the current and future \\hi intensity mapping\nexperiments, BINGO, FAST, and SKA-I. With the current configuration of the\nexperiments and assumed one-year observation time, we find that the SKA-I will\nprovide tighter constraints on the local shape of primoridal non-Gaussianity\nthan Planck. The results are $(\\sigma_{f^{\\rm local}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm\nequil}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm enfold}_{\\rm\nNL}})_{\\rm SKA-I}=(0.54, 86, 25, 43)$, $(\\sigma_{f^{\\rm local}_{\\rm\nNL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm\nNL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm enfold}_{\\rm NL}})_{\\rm BINGO}=(17, 100, 128, 164)$,\n$(\\sigma_{f^{\\rm local}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm equil}_{\\rm\nNL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm orth}_{\\rm NL}},\\sigma_{f^{\\rm enfold}_{\\rm NL}})_{\\rm\nFAST}=(9.5, 44, 75, 94)$. If the lower frequency band of FAST can be used, the\nconstraint on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity will be\n$\\sigma_{f_\\mathrm{NL}}\\sim1.62$ which is better than Planck. In addition, if\nthe observation time for FAST could be extended to two years, the constraint on\nthe equilateral shape of primordial non-Gaussianity would be improved to\n$\\sigma_{f_\\mathrm{NL}}\\sim32$. Similarly, if the observational time of SKA-I\ncould be extended to two years, the constraint on local and orthogonal shapes\ncould be improved to $0.43$ and $20$, respectively, achieving better\nconstraints than Planck.\n", "  In this work we use the quasinormal mode of a massless scalar perturbation to\nprobe the phase transition of the charged-AdS black hole in time profile. The\nsignature of the critical behavior of this black hole solution is detected in\nthe isobaric process. This paper is a natural extension of [1, 2] to the time\ndomain analysis. More precisely, our study shows a clear signal in term of the\ndamping rate and the oscillation frequencies of the scalar field perturbation.\nWe conclude that the quasinormal modes can be an efficient tool to detect the\nsignature of thermodynamic phase transition in the isobaric process far from\nthe critical temperature, but fail to disclose this signature at the critical\ntemperature\n", "  The topology of the band structure, which is determined by the lattice\nsymmetries, has a strong influence on the transport properties. Here we\nconsider an anisotropic honeycomb lattice and study the effect of a\ncontinuously deformed band structure on the optical conductivity and on\ndiffusion due to quantum fluctuations. In contrast to the behavior at an\nisotropic node we find super- and subdiffusion for the anisotropic node. The\nspectral saddle points create van Hove singularities in the optical\nconductivity, which could be used to characterize the spectral properties\nexperimentally.\n", "  Multi-particle azimuthal cumulants, often used to study collective flow in\nhigh-energy heavy-ion collisions, have recently been applied in small collision\nsystems such as $pp$ and $p$+A to extract the second-order azimuthal harmonic\nflow $v_2$. Recent observation of four-, six- and eight-particle cumulants with\n\"correct sign\" $c_2\\{4\\}<0, c_2\\{6\\}>0, c_2\\{8\\}<0$ and approximate equality of\nthe inferred single-particle harmonic flow, $v_2\\{4\\}\\approx v_2\\{6\\}\\approx\nv_2\\{8\\}$, have been used as strong evidence for a collective emission of all\nsoft particles produced in the collisions. We show that these relations in\nprinciple could be violated due to the non-Gaussianity in the event-by-event\nfluctuation of flow and/or non-flow. Furthermore, we show, using $pp$ events\ngenerated with the PYTHIA model, that $c_2\\{2k\\}$ obtained with standard\ncumulant method are dominated by non-flow from dijets. An alternative cumulant\nmethod based on two or more $\\eta$-separated subevents is proposed to suppress\nthe dijet contribution. The new method is shown to be able to recover a flow\nsignal as low as 4\\% imposed on the PYTHIA events, independently of how the\nevent activity class is defined. Therefore the subevent cumulant method offers\na more robust way of studying collectivity based on the existence of long-range\nazimuthal correlations between multiple distinct $\\eta$ ranges. The prospect of\nusing the subevent cumulants to study collective flow in A+A collisions, in\nparticular its longitudinal dynamics, is discussed.\n", "  A two-phase description of the quark-nuclear matter hybrid equation of state\nthat takes into account the effect of excluded volume in both the hadronic and\nthe quark matter phases is introduced.\n  The nuclear phase manifests a reduction of the available volume as density\nincreases, leading to a stiffening of the matter. The quark matter phase\ndisplays a reduction of the effective string tension in the confining density\nfunctional from available volume contributions. The nuclear equation of state\nis based upon the relativistic density functional model DD2 with excluded\nvolume. The quark matter is based upon a mean-field modification to the free\nfermi gas and will be discussed in greater detail. The interactions are\ndecomposed into mean scalar and vector components. The scalar interaction is\nmotivated by a string potential between quarks, whereas the vector interaction\npotential is motivated by higher order interactions of quarks leading to an\nincreased stiffening at high densities. As an application, we consider matter\nunder compact star constraints of electric neutrality and $\\beta$-equilibrium.\nWe obtain mass-radius relations for hybrid stars that form a third family,\ndisconnected from the purely hadronic star branch, and fulfill the $2M_\\odot$\nconstraint.\n", "  In our work, we study the dynamics of a single excitation in an\none-dimensional array of two-level systems, which are chirally coupled through\na single mode waveguide. The chirality is achieved owing to a strong optical\nspin-locking effect, which in an ideal case gives perfect unidirectional\nexcitation transport. We obtain a simple analytical solution for a single\nexcitation dynamics in the Markovian limit, which directly shows the tolerance\nof the system with respect to the fluctuations of emitters position. We also\nshow that the Dicke state, which is well-known to be superradiant, has twice\nlower emission rate in the case of unidirectional quantum interaction. Our\nmodel is supported and verified with the numerical computations of quantum\nemmiters coupled via surface plasmon modes in a metalic nanowire. The obtained\nresults are based on a very general model and can be applied to any chirally\ncoupled system, that gives a new outlook on quantum transport in chiral\nnanophotonics.\n", "  Recently thermally created pure spin currents were predicted for Zeeman-split\nsuperconductor/normal metal heterostructures. Here it is shown that this\n\"thermospin\" current can lead to an accumulation of a pure spin imbalance in a\nsystem. The thermally induced spin imbalance can reach the value of Zeeman\nsplitting of the superconducting DOS and strongly influences superconductivity\nin the heterostructure. Depending on the temperature difference between the\nsuperconductor and the normal reservoir it can enhance the critical temperature\nof the superconductor or additionally suppress the zero-temperature\nsuperconducting state. The last possibility gives rise to an unusual\nsuperconducting state, which starts to develop at finite temperature.\n", "  We report on salient features of a mixed lattice QCD action using valence\nM\\\"{o}bius domain-wall fermions solved on the dynamical $N_f=2+1+1$ HISQ\nensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration. The approximate chiral symmetry\nproperties of the valence fermions are shown to be significantly improved by\nutilizing the gradient-flow scheme to first smear the HISQ configurations. The\ngreater numerical cost of the M\\\"{o}bius domain-wall inversions is mitigated by\nthe highly efficient QUDA library optimized for NVIDIA GPU accelerated compute\nnodes. We have created an interface to this optimized QUDA solver in Chroma. We\nprovide tuned parameters of the action and performance of QUDA using ensembles\nwith the lattice spacings $a \\simeq \\{0.15, 0.12, 0.09\\}$ fm and pion masses\n$m_\\pi \\simeq \\{310, 220,130\\}$ MeV. We have additionally generated two new\nensembles with $a\\sim0.12$ fm and $m_\\pi\\sim\\{400, 350\\}$ MeV. With a fixed\nflow-time of $t_{gf}=1$ in lattice units, the residual chiral symmetry breaking\nof the valence fermions is kept below 10\\% of the light quark mass on all\nensembles, $m_{res} \\lesssim 0.1\\times m_l$, with moderate values of the fifth\ndimension $L_5$ and a domain-wall height $M_5 \\leq 1.3$. As a benchmark\ncalculation, we perform a continuum, infinite volume, physical pion and kaon\nmass extrapolation of $F_{K^\\pm}/F_{\\pi^\\pm}$ and demonstrate our results are\nindependent of flow-time, and consistent with the FLAG determination of this\nquantity at the level of less than one standard deviation.\n", "  The demagnetizing factor N is of both conceptual interest and practical\nimportance. Considering localized magnetic moments on a lattice, we show that\nfor non-ellipsoidal samples, N depends on the spin dimensionality (Ising, XY,\nor Heisenberg) and orientation, as well as the sample shape and susceptibility.\nThe generality of this result is demonstrated by means of a recursive analytic\ncalculation as well as detailed Monte Carlo simulations of realistic model spin\nHamiltonians. As an important check and application, we also make an accurate\nexperimental determination of N for a representative collective paramagnet\n(i.e. the Dy2Ti2O7 spin ice compound) and show that the temperature dependence\nof the experimentally determined N agrees closely with our theoretical\ncalculations. Our conclusion is that the well established practice of\napproximating the true sample shape with \"corresponding ellipsoids\" for systems\nwith long-range interactions will in many cases overlook important effects\nstemming from the microscopic aspects of the system under consideration.\n", "  We used the Robo-AO laser adaptive optics system to image 99 main sequence\nand subgiant stars that have Kepler-detected asteroseismic signals. Robo-AO\nallows us to resolve blended secondary sources at separations as close as 0.15\"\nthat may contribute to the measured Kepler light curves and affect\nasteroseismic analysis and interpretation. We report 8 new secondary sources\nwithin 4.0\" of these Kepler asteroseismic stars. We used Subaru and Keck\nadaptive optics to measure differential infrared photometry for these candidate\ncompanion systems. Two of the secondary sources are likely foreground objects\nand at least 6 of the secondaries are background sources; however we cannot\nexclude the possibility that three of the objects may be physically associated.\nWe measured a range of i'-band amplitude dilutions for the candidate companion\nsystems from 0.43% to 15.4%. We find that the measured amplitude dilutions are\ninsufficient to explain the previously identified excess scatter in the\nrelationship between asteroseismic oscillation amplitude and the frequency of\nmaximum power.\n", "  Conflict between formation of a cyclonic vortex and isotropization in forced\nhomogeneous rotating turbulence is numerically investigated. It is well known\nthat a large rotation rate of the system induces columnar vortices to result in\nquasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) flow, while a small rotation rate allows turbulence\nto be three-dimensional (3D). It is found that the transition from the Q2D\nturbulent flow to the 3D turbulent flow and the reverse transition occur at\ndifferent values of the rotation rates. At the intermediate rotation rates,\nbistability of these two statistically steady states is observed. Such\nhysteretic behavior is also observed for the variation of the amplitude of an\nexternal force.\n", "  The HeII transverse proximity effect -- enhanced HeII Ly$\\alpha$~transmission\nin a background sightline caused by the ionizing radiation of a foreground\nquasar -- offers a unique opportunity to probe the morphology of quasar-driven\nHeII reionization. We conduct a comprehensive spectroscopic survey to find\n$z\\sim3$ quasars in the foreground of 22 background quasar sightlines with\nHST/COS HeII Ly$\\alpha$~transmission spectra. With our two-tiered survey\nstrategy, consisting of a deep pencil-beam survey and a shallow wide-field\nsurvey, we discover 131 new quasars, which we complement with known SDSS/BOSS\nquasars in our fields. Using a restricted sample of 66 foreground quasars with\ninferred HeII photoionization rates greater than the expected UV background at\nthese redshifts ($\\Gamma_\\mathrm{QSO}^\\mathrm{HeII} > 5 \\times\n10^{-16}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) we perform the first statistical analysis of the\nHeII transverse proximity effect. Our results show qualitative evidence for a\nlarge object-to-object variance: among the four foreground quasars with the\nhighest $\\Gamma_\\mathrm{QSO}^\\mathrm{HeII}$ only one (previously known) quasar\nis associated with a significant HeII transmission spike. We perform a stacking\nanalysis to average down these fluctuations, and detect an excess in the\naverage HeII transmission near the foreground quasars at $3\\sigma$\nsignificance. This statistical evidence for the transverse proximity effect is\ncorroborated by a clear dependence of the signal strength on\n$\\Gamma_\\mathrm{QSO}^\\mathrm{HeII}$. Our detection places a purely geometrical\nlower limit on the quasar lifetime of $t_\\mathrm{Q} > 25\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$.\nImproved modeling would additionally constrain quasar obscuration and the mean\nfree path of HeII-ionizing photons.\n", "  We present a novel class of calculable four dimensional composite\npseudo-Goldstone boson Higgs models based on symmetric G/H coset spaces which\ncontain a Higgs-parity operator V as well as a linear representation $\\Sigma'$\nfor the Goldstone bosons. For such cosets the low-energy effective Lagrangian\nfor the Standard Model fields can have an enhanced global symmetry which we\ncall the maximal symmetry. We show that such a maximally symmetric case leads\nto a finite and fully calculable Higgs potential, which also minimizes the\ntuning by eliminating double tuning and reducing the Higgs mass. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the Maximally Symmetric SO(5)/SO(4) model, and comment on\nits observational consequences.\n", "  Neutron beam monitors with high efficiency, low gamma sensitivity, high time\nand space resolution are required in neutron beam experiments to continuously\ndiagnose the delivered beam. In this work, commercially available neutron beam\nmonitors have been characterized using the R2D2 beamline at IFE (Norway) and\nusing a Be-based neutron source. For the gamma sensitivity measurements\ndifferent gamma sources have been used. The evaluation of the monitors\nincludes, the study of their efficiency, attenuation, scattering and\nsensitivity to gamma. In this work we report the results of this\ncharacterization.\n", "  We present a [[7, 1, 3]] quantum error-correcting code that is able to\nachieve fault-tolerant syndrome measurement using one ancillary qubit per\nstabilizer for an error model of independent single-qubit Pauli errors. All\nsingle-qubit Pauli errors on the ancillary qubits propagate to form exclusively\ncorrectable errors on the data qubits. The situation changes for error models\nwith two-qubit Pauli errors. We compare the level-1 logical error rates under\ntwo noise models: the standard Pauli symmetric depolarizing error model and an\nanisotropic error model. The anisotropic model is motivated by control errors\non two-qubit gates commonly applied to trapped ion qubits. We find that one\nancillary qubit per syndrome measurement is sufficient for fault-tolerance for\nthe anisotropic error, but is not sufficient for the standard depolarizing\nerrors. We then show how to achieve fault tolerance for the standard\ndepolarizing errors by adding flag qubits to check for errors on select\nancilary qubits. Our results on this [[7, 1, 3]] code demonstrates how\nphysically motivated noise models may simplify fault-tolerent protocols.\n", "  We generalize the topological model recently proposed and investigate the\ncosmological perturbations of the model. The model has an exact de Sitter\nbackground solution associated with a Becchi-Rouet-Stora(BRS) quartet terms\nwhich are regarded as a Lagrangian density of the topological field theory. The\nde Sitter solution can be selected without spontaneously breaking the BRS\nsymmetry, and be interpreted as a gauge fixing of de Sitter spacetime. The BRS\nsymmetry is preserved for the perturbations around the de Sitter background\nbefore we solve the constraints of general relativity. We derive action to the\nsecond order of the perturbations and confirm that even after solving the\nconstraints, we have the BRS symmetry at least for the second order action. We\nconstruct the cosmological perturbation theory involving the BRS sector, and\nobtain the two point correlation functions for the curvature perturbation and\nthe isocurvature perturbations which compose the BRS sector. Our result gives a\nnew description for de Sitter spacetime and the quantum field theory in de\nSitter spacetime.\n", "  Quasiperiodic modulation can prevent isolated quantum systems from\nequilibrating by localizing their degrees of freedom. In this article, we show\nthat such systems can exhibit dynamically stable long-range orders forbidden in\nequilibrium. Specifically, we show that the interplay of symmetry breaking and\nlocalization in the quasiperiodic quantum Ising chain produces a\n\\emph{quasiperiodic Ising glass} stable at all energy densities. The glass\norder parameter vanishes with an essential singularity at the melting\ntransition with no signatures in the equilibrium properties. The zero\ntemperature phase diagram is also surprisingly rich, consisting of\nparamagnetic, ferromagnetic and quasiperiodically alternating ground state\nphases with extended, localized and critically delocalized low energy\nexcitations. The system exhibits an unusual quantum Ising transition whose\nproperties are intermediate between those of the clean and infinite randomness\nIsing transitions. Many of these results follow from a geometric generalization\nof the Aubry-Andr\\'e duality which we develop. The quasiperiodic Ising glass\nmay be realized in near term quantum optical experiments.\n", "  Bipartite charge fluctuations (BCF) have been introduced to provide an\nexperimental indication of many-body entanglement. They have proved themselves\nto be a very efficient and useful tool to characterize quantum phase\ntransitions in a variety of quantum models conserving the total number of\nparticles (or magnetization for spin systems). In this Letter, we study the BCF\nin generic one-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (topological) models including the\nKitaev superconducting wire model, the Ising chain or various topological\ninsulators such as the SSH model. The considered charge (either the fermionic\nnumber or the relative density) is no longer conserved, leading to macroscopic\nfluctuations of the number of particles. We demonstrate that at phase\ntransitions characterized by a linear dispersion, the BCF probe the change in a\nwinding number that allows one to pinpoint the transition and corresponds to\nthe topological invariant for standard models. Additionally, we prove that a\nsub-dominant logarithmic contribution is still present at the exact critical\npoint. Its quantized coefficient is universal and characterizes the critical\nmodel. Results are extended to the Rashba topological nanowires and to the XYZ\nmodel.\n", "  We report first direct experimental evidence of interspecies ion separation\nin direct-drive ICF experiments performed at the OMEGA laser facility via\nspectrally, temporally and spatially resolved imaging x-ray-spectroscopy data\n[S. C. Hsu et al., EPL 115, 65001 (2016)]. These experiments were designed\nbased on the expectation that interspecies ion thermo-diffusion would be\nstrongest for species with large mass and charge difference. The targets were\nspherical plastic shells filled with D2 and a trace amount of Ar (0.1% or 1% by\natom). Ar K-shell spectral features were observed primarily between the time of\nfirst-shock convergence and slightly before neutron bang time, using a time-\nand space-integrated spectrometer, a streaked crystal spectrometer, and two\ngated multi-monochromatic x-ray imagers fielded along quasi-orthogonal lines of\nsight. Detailed spectroscopic analyses of spatially resolved Ar K-shell lines\nreveal deviation from the initial 1% Ar gas fill and show both Ar-concentration\nenhancement and depletion at different times and radial positions of the\nimplosion. The experimental results are interpreted with radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations that include recently implemented, first-principles models of\ninterspecies ion diffusion. The experimentally inferred Ar-atom-fraction\nprofiles agree reasonably with calculated profiles associated with the incoming\nand rebounding first shock.\n", "  We analyzed broad-band X-ray and radio data of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154\ntaken in the aftermath of its 2014, 2015, and 2016 outbursts. The source soft\nX-ray spectrum <10 keV is well described with a BB+PL or 2BB model during all\nthree outbursts. NuSTAR observations revealed a hard X-ray tail, $\\Gamma=0.9$,\nextending up to 79 keV, with flux larger than the one detected <10 keV. Imaging\nanalysis of Chandra data did not reveal small-scale extended emission around\nthe source. Following the outbursts, the total 0.5-10 keV flux from SGR\nJ1935+2154 increased in concordance to its bursting activity, with the flux at\nactivation onset increasing by a factor of $\\sim7$ following its strongest June\n2016 outburst. A Swift/XRT observation taken 1.5 days prior to the onset of\nthis outburst showed a flux level consistent with quiescence. We show that the\nflux increase is due to the PL or hot BB component, which increased by a factor\nof $25$ compared to quiescence, while the cold BB component $kT=0.47$ keV\nremained more or less constant. The 2014 and 2015 outbursts decayed\nquasi-exponentially with time-scales of $\\sim40$ days, while the stronger May\nand June 2016 outbursts showed a quick short-term decay with time-scales of\n$\\sim4$ days. Our Arecibo radio observations set the deepest limits on the\nradio emission from a magnetar, with a maximum flux density limit of 14 $\\mu$Jy\nfor the 4.6 GHz observations and 7 $\\mu$Jy for the 1.4 GHz observations. We\ndiscuss these results in the framework of the current magnetar theoretical\nmodels.\n", "  We uncover two anomalous features in the nonlocal transport behavior of\ntwo-dimensional metallic materials with spin-orbit coupling. Firstly, the\nnonlocal resistance can have negative values and oscillate with distance, even\nin the absence of a magnetic field. Secondly, the oscillations of the nonlocal\nresistance under an applied in-plane magnetic field (Hanle effect) can be\nasymmetric under field reversal. Both features are produced by direct\nmagnetoelectric coupling, which is possible in materials with broken inversion\nsymmetry but was not included in previous spin diffusion theories of nonlocal\ntransport. These effects can be used to identify the relative contributions of\ndifferent spin-charge conversion mechanisms. They should be observable in\nadatom-functionalized graphene, and may provide the reason for discrepancies in\nrecent nonlocal transport experiments on graphene.\n", "  We obtain an approximate global stationary and axisymmetric solution of\nEinstein's equations which can be thought as a simple star model: a\nself-gravitating perfect fluid ball with a differential rotation motion\npattern. Using the post--Minkowskian formalism (weak field approximation) and\nconsidering rotation as a perturbation (slow rotation approximation), we find\napproximate interior and exterior (asymptotically flat) solutions to this\nproblem in harmonic coordinates. Interior and exterior solutions are matched,\nin the sense of Lichnerowicz, on the surface of zero pressure to get a global\nsolution. The resulting metric depends on four arbitrary constants: mass\ndensity, rotational velocity at $r=0$, a parameter which takes into account of\nthe change in the rotational velocity through the star and the star radius in\nthe non-rotation limit. The mass, angular momentum, quadrupole moment and other\nconstants of the exterior metric are determined in terms of these four\nparameters.\n", "  Multi-frequency gravitational wave (GW) observations are useful probes of the\nformation processes of coalescing stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs). We\ndiscuss the phase drift in the GW inspiral waveform of the merging BBH caused\nby its center-of-mass acceleration. The acceleration strongly depends on the\nlocation where a BBH forms within a galaxy, allowing observations of the early\ninspiral phase of LIGO-like BBH mergers by the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA) to test the formation mechanism. In particular, BBHs formed in\ndense nuclear star clusters or via compact accretion disks around a nuclear\nsupermassive black hole in active galactic nuclei would suffer strong\nacceleration, and produce large phase drifts measurable by LISA. The host\ngalaxies of the coalescing BBHs in these scenarios can also be uniquely\nidentified in the LISA error volume, without electromagnetic counterparts. A\nnon-detection of phase drifts would rule out or constrain the contribution of\nthe nuclear formation channels to the stellar-mass BBH population.\n", "  Regional hydrology studies are often supported by high resolution simulations\nof subsurface flow that require expensive and extensive computations. Efficient\nusage of the latest high performance parallel computing systems becomes a\nnecessity. The simulation software ParFlow has been demonstrated to meet this\nrequirement and shown to have excellent solver scalability for up to 16,384\nprocesses. In the present work we show that the code requires further\nenhancements in order to fully take advantage of current petascale machines. We\nidentify ParFlow's way of parallelization of the computational mesh as a\ncentral bottleneck. We propose to reorganize this subsystem using fast mesh\npartition algorithms provided by the parallel adaptive mesh refinement library\np4est. We realize this in a minimally invasive manner by modifying selected\nparts of the code to reinterpret the existing mesh data structures. We evaluate\nthe scaling performance of the modified version of ParFlow, demonstrating good\nweak and strong scaling up to 458k cores of the Juqueen supercomputer, and test\nan example application at large scale.\n", "  We analyse the worldline holographic framework for fermions. Worldline\nholography is based on the observation that in the worldline approach to\nquantum field theory, sources of a quantum field theory over Mink$_4$ naturally\nform a field theory over AdS$_5$ to all orders in the elementary fields and in\nthe sources. Schwinger's proper time of the worldline formalism automatically\nappears with the physical four spacetime dimensions in an AdS$_5$ geometry. The\nworldline holographic effective action in general and the proper-time profiles\nof the sources in particular solve a renormalisation group equation. By taking\ninto account sources up to spin one, we reconstruct seminal holographic models.\nConsidering spin two confirms AdS$_5$ as consistent background.\n", "  The impacts that the environment has on the quantum phase transition of light\nin the DickeBose-Hubbard model are investigated. Based on the quasibosonic\napproach, mean field theory and the perturbation theory, the formulation of the\nHamiltonian, the eigenenergies and the superfluid order parameter are obtained\nanalytically. Compared with the ideal cases, the order parameter of the system\nevolves with time as the photons naturally decay in their environment. When the\nsystem starts with the superfluid state, the dissipation makes the photons tend\nto localize, and a greater hopping energy of photon is required to restore the\nlong-range phase coherence of the localized state of the system. Furthermore,\nthe Mott lobes disappears and the system tends to be classical with the number\nof atoms increasing; however, the atomic number is far lower than that expected\nunder ideal circumstances. Therefore, our theoretical results offer valuable\ninsight into the quantum phase transition of a dissipative system.\n", "  If accreting white dwarfs (WD) in binary systems are to produce type Ia\nsupernovae (SNIa), they must grow to nearly the Chandrasekhar mass and ignite\ncarbon burning. Proving conclusively that a WD has grown substantially since\nits birth is a challenging task. Slow accretion of hydrogen inevitably leads to\nthe erosion, rather than the growth of WDs. Rapid hydrogen accretion does lead\nto growth of a helium layer, due to both decreased degeneracy and the\ninhibition of mixing of the accreted hydrogen with the underlying WD. However,\nuntil recently, simulations of helium-accreting WDs all claimed to show the\nexplosive ejection of a helium envelope once it exceeded $\\sim 10^{-1}\\, \\rm\nM_{\\odot}$. Because CO WDs cannot be born with masses in excess of $\\sim 1.1\\,\n\\rm M_{\\odot}$, any such object, in excess of $\\sim 1.2\\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$, must\nhave grown substantially. We demonstrate that the WD in the symbiotic nova RS\nOph is in the mass range 1.2-1.4\\,M$_{\\odot}$. We compare UV spectra of RS Oph\nwith those of novae with ONe WDs, and with novae erupting on CO WDs. The RS Oph\nWD is clearly made of CO, demonstrating that it has grown substantially since\nbirth. It is a prime candidate to eventually produce an SNIa.\n", "  Combining electronic Raman scattering experiments with cellular dynamical\nmean field theory, we present evidence of the pseudogap in the superconducting\nstate of various hole-doped cuprates. In Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d we track the\nsuperconducting pseudogap hallmark, a peak-dip feature, as a function of\ntemperature T and doping p, well beyond the optimal one. We show that, at all\ntemperatures under the superconducting dome, the pseudogap disappears at the\ndoping pc, between 0.222 and 0.226, where also the normal-state pseudogap\ncollapses at a Lifshitz transition. This demonstrates that the superconducting\npseudogap boundary forms a vertical line in the T-p phase diagram.\n", "  Tunneling is a fascinating aspect of quantum mechanics that renders the local\nminima of a potential meta-stable, with important consequences for particle\nphysics, for the early hot stage of the universe, and more speculatively, for\nthe behavior of the putative multiverse. While this phenomenon has been studied\nextensively for systems which have canonical kinetic terms, many theories of\nfundamental physics contain fields with non-canonical kinetic structures. It is\ntherefore desirable to have a detailed framework for calculating tunneling\nrates and initial states after tunneling for these theories. In this work, we\npresent such a rigorous formulation and illustrate its use by applying it to a\nnumber of examples.\n", "  The consequences of nonmagnetic-ion dilution for the pyrochlore family\nY$_{2}$($M_{1-x}N_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{7}$ ($M$ = magnetic ion, $N$ = nonmagnetic\nion) have been investigated. As a first step, we experimentally examine the\nmagnetic properties of Y$_{2}$CrSbO$_{7}$ ($x$ = 0.5), in which the magnetic\nsites (Cr$^{3+}$) are percolative. Although the effective Cr-Cr spin exchange\nis ferromagnetic, as evidenced by a positive Curie-Weiss temperature,\n$\\Theta_\\mathrm{{CW}}$ = 20.1(6) K, our high-resolution neutron powder\ndiffraction measurements detect no sign of magnetic long range order down to 2\nK. In order to understand our observations, we performed numerical simulations\nto study the bond-disorder introduced by the ionic size mismatch between $M$\nand $N$. Based on these simulations, bond-disorder ($x_{b}$ $\\simeq$ 0.23)\npercolates well ahead of site-disorder ($x_{s}$ $\\simeq$ 0.61). This model\nsuccessfully reproduces the critical region (0.2 < $x$ < 0.25) for the N\\'eel\nto spin glass phase transition in Zn(Cr$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{4}$, where\nthe Cr/Ga-sublattice forms the same corner-sharing tetrahedral network as the\n$M/N$-sublattice in Y$_{2}$($M_{1-x}N_{x}$)$_{2}$O$_{7}$, and the rapid drop in\nmagnetically ordered moment in the N\\'eel phase [Lee $et$ $al$, Phys. Rev. B\n77, 014405 (2008)]. Our study stresses the nonnegligible role of bond-disorder\non magnetic frustration, even in ferromagnets.\n", "  As one of the most massive Milky Way satellites, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy\nhas played an important role in shaping the Galactic disk and stellar halo\nmorphologies. The disruption of Sagittarius over several close-in passages has\npopulated the halo of our Galaxy with large-scale tidal streams and offers a\nunique diagnostic tool for measuring its gravitational potential. Here we test\ndifferent progenitor mass models for the Milky Way and Sagittarius by modeling\nthe full infall of the satellite. We constrain the mass of the Galaxy based on\nthe observed orbital parameters and multiple tidal streams of Sagittarius. Our\nsemi-analytic modeling of the orbital dynamics agrees with full $N$-body\nsimulations, and favors low values for the Milky Way mass, $\\lesssim\n10^{12}M_\\odot$. This conclusion eases the tension between $\\Lambda$CDM and the\nobserved parameters of the Milky Way satellites.\n", "  Cascading failures in complex systems have been studied extensively using two\ndifferent models: $k$-core percolation and interdependent networks. We combine\nthe two models into a general model, solve it analytically and validate our\ntheoretical results through extensive simulations. We also study the complete\nphase diagram of the percolation transition as we tune the average local\n$k$-core threshold and the coupling between networks. We find that the phase\ndiagram of the combined processes is very rich and includes novel features that\ndo not appear in the models studying each of the processes separately. For\nexample, the phase diagram consists of first and second-order transition\nregions separated by two tricritical lines that merge together and enclose a\nnovel two-stage transition region. In the two-stage transition, the size of the\ngiant component undergoes a first-order jump at a certain occupation\nprobability followed by a continuous second-order transition at a lower\noccupation probability. Furthermore, at certain fixed interdependencies, the\npercolation transition changes from first-order $\\rightarrow$ second-order\n$\\rightarrow$ two-stage $\\rightarrow$ first-order as the $k$-core threshold is\nincreased. The analytic equations describing the phase boundaries of the\ntwo-stage transition region are set up and the critical exponents for each type\nof transition are derived analytically.\n", "  Current theory is able to predict the Casimir force between macroscopic\nbodies with an accuracy only limited by the knowledge of the material\nparameters. Yet surprisingly after almost 70 years of research, while theory\ndescribes the Casimir force between bodies, the force inside macroscopic bodies\nis poorly understood. In this paper, we develop from a physically intuitive\npicture the macroscopic theory of the Casimir stress inside inhomogeneous\nplanar media. Our result agrees with a previous ad hoc procedure [T. G. Philbin\net al., Ann. Phys. (New York) 325, 579 (2010)], giving both mathematical and\nphysical justification to a conjecture that was only tested numerically so far.\nOur theory is likely to be extendable; it may open the gate to the computation\nof Casimir forces inside arbitrary materials.\n", "  LaBi is a three-dimensional rocksalt-type material with a surprisingly\nquasi-two-dimensional electronic structure. It exhibits excellent electronic\nproperties such as the existence of nontrivial Dirac cones, extremely large\nmagnetoresistance, and high charge-carrier mobility. The cigar-shaped electron\nvalleys make the charge transport highly anisotropic when the magnetic field is\nvaried from one crystallographic axis to another. We show that the electrons\ncan be polarized effectively in these electron valleys under a rotating\nmagnetic field. We achieved a polarization of 60% at 2 K despite the\ncoexistence of three-dimensional hole pockets. The valley polarization in LaBi\nis compared to the sister compound LaSb where it is found to be smaller. The\nperformance of LaBi is comparable to the highly efficient bismuth.\n", "  Using the unique capabilities of the Variable Density Turbulence Tunnel at\nthe Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, G\\\"{o}ttingen, we\nreport experimental result on classical grid turbulence that uncover fine, yet\nimportant details of the structure functions in the inertial range. This was\nmade possible by measuring extremely long time series of up to $10^{10}$\nsamples of the turbulent fluctuating velocity, which corresponds to\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(10^5\\right)$ large eddy turnover times. These classical grid\nmeasurements were conducted in a well-controlled environment at a wide range of\nhigh Reynolds numbers from $R_\\lambda=110$ up to $R_\\lambda=1600$, using both\ntraditional hot-wire probes as well as NSTAP probes developed at Princeton\nUniversity. We found that deviations from ideal scaling are anchored to the\nsmall scales and that dissipation influences the inertial-range statistics at\nscales larger than the near-dissipation range.\n", "  The origin of the broad emission line region (BELR) in quasars and active\ngalactic nuclei is still unclear. I propose that condensations form in the\nwarm, radiation pressure driven, accretion disk wind of quasars creating the\nBEL clouds and uniting them with the other two manifestations of cool, 10,000\nK, gas in quasars, the low ionization phase of the warm absorbers (WAs) and the\nclouds causing X-ray eclipses. The cool clouds will condense quickly (days to\nyears), before the WA outflows reach escape velocity (which takes months to\ncenturies). Cool clouds form in equilibrium with the warm phase of the wind\nbecause the rapidly varying X-ray quasar continuum changes the force\nmultiplier, causing pressure waves to move gas into stable locations in\npressure-temperature space. The narrow range of 2-phase equilibrium densities\nmay explain the scaling of the BELR size with the square root of luminosity,\nwhile the scaling of cloud formation timescales could produce the Baldwin\neffect. These dense clouds have force multipliers of order unity and so cannot\nbe accelerated to escape velocity. They fall back on a dynamical timescale\n(months to centuries), producing an inflow that rains down toward the central\nblack hole. As they soon move at Mach ~40 with respect to the WA outflow, these\n'raindrops' will be rapidly destroyed within months. This rain of clouds may\nproduce the elliptical BELR orbits implied by velocity resolved reverberation\nmapping in some objects, and can explain the opening angle and destruction\ntimescale of the narrow 'cometary' tails of the clouds seen in X-ray eclipse\nobservations. Some consequences and challenges of this 'quasar rain' model are\npresented along with several avenues for theoretical investigation.\n", "  We present a tunneling study on single crystalline parent cuprate thin films,\ni.e. a series of Pr2CuO4+/-{\\delta}(PCO) with tunable superconducting\ntransition temperature. The zero-bias anomaly of differential conductance, well\nreported in the normal state of R2-xCexCuO4 (R = Pr, Nd, La) and named as\nnormal state gap (NSG), is observed in the Ce-free samples. This NSG behaves\nquite robust against the magnetic field up to 16 T, but fades away with\nincreasing the temperature. Most importantly, we find that the magnitude of the\nNSG becomes larger with increasing point-contact junction resistance on the\nsuperconducting films, which is further enhanced in the non-superconducting\nsamples of more oxygen disorders. The origination of NSG can be understood in\nthe framework of Altshuler-Aronov-Lee (AAL) theory, where the disorder-induced\nelectron-electron interactions suppress the density of states and thereby\nresult in a soft Coulomb gap.\n", "  Electron-counting rules were applied to understand the stability, structural\npreference, and physical properties of metal disilicides. Following predictions\nmade by 14 electron counting rules, the ordered semiconductor ReGaSi, the first\nternary phase in this system, is proposed and successfully synthesized. It\ncrystallizes with a primitive tetragonal structure (space group P4/nmm) closely\nrelated to that of MoSi2-type ReSi2, but with Ga and Si orderly distributed in\nthe unit cell. The band structure, density of states, and crystal orbital\ncalculations confirm the electron count hypothesis to predict new stable\ncompounds. Calculations, based on 14 electrons per ReGaSi units, show a small\nindirect band gap of ~0.2 eV around Fermi level between full and empty\nelectronic states. Additionally, first-principles calculations confirm the site\npreference of Ga and Si which is observed through the structural refinement.\nExperimental magnetic measurements verified the predicted non-magnetic\nproperties of ReGaSi.\n", "  We theoretically demonstrate that a system formed by two coupled graphene\nsheets enables a negative damping regime wherein graphene plasmons are pumped\nby a DC current. This effect is triggered by electrons drifting through one of\nthe graphene sheets and leads to the spontaneous light emission (spasing) and\nwave instabilities in the mid-infrared range. It is shown that there is a deep\nlink between the drift-induced instabilities and wave instabilities in moving\nmedia, as both result from the hybridization of oscillators with oppositely\nsigned frequencies. With a thickness of few nanometers and wide spectral\ntunability, the proposed structure may find interesting applications in\nnanophotonic circuitry as an on-chip light source.\n", "  Magnetic fields present before decoupling are damped due to radiative\nviscosity. This energy injection affects the thermal and ionization history of\nthe cosmic plasma. The implications for the CMB anisotropies and polarization\nare investigated for different parameter choices of a non helical stochastic\nmagnetic field. Assuming a Gaussian smoothing scale determined by the magnetic\ndamping wave number at recombination it is found that magnetic fields with\npresent day strength less than 0.1 nG and negative magnetic spectral indices\nhave a sizeable effect on the CMB temperature anisotropies and polarization.\n", "  A magneto-structural phase transition is investigated in single crystal CrN\nthin films grown by rf plasma molecular beam epitaxy on MgO(001) substrates.\nWhile still within the vacuum environment following MBE growth, $\\it in-situ$\nlow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, and $\\it in-situ$ variable\nlow-temperature reflection high energy electron diffraction are applied,\nrevealing an atomically smooth and metallic CrN(001) surface, and an $\\it\nin-plane$ structural transition from 1$\\times$1 (primitive CrN unit cell) to\n$\\mathrm{\\sqrt{2}\\times\\sqrt{2}-R45^\\circ}$ with a transition temperature of\n$\\sim$ 278 K, respectively. $\\it Ex-situ$ temperature dependent measurements\nare also performed, including x-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction,\nlooking at the structural peaks and likewise revealing a first-order structural\ntransition along both [001] and [111] $\\it out-of-plane$ directions, with\ntransition temperatures of 256 K and 268 K, respectively. Turning to the\nmagnetic peaks, neutron diffraction confirms a clear magnetic transition from\nparamagnetic at room temperature to antiferromagnetic at low temperatures with\na sharp, first-order phase transition and a N$\\'{e}$el temperature of 270 K or\n280 K for two different films. In addition to the experimental measurements of\nstructural and magnetic ordering, we also discuss results from first-principles\ntheoretical calculations which explore various possible magneto-structural\nmodels.\n", "  We consider an optically thin radiation-supported levitating atmosphere\nsuspended well above the stellar surface, as discussed recently in the\nSchwarzschild metric for a star of luminosity close to the Eddington value.\nAssuming the atmosphere to be geometrically thin and polytropic, we investigate\nthe eigenmodes and calculate the frequencies of the oscillations of the\natmosphere in Newtonian formalism. The ratio of the two lowest eigenfrequencies\nis $\\sqrt{\\gamma+1}$, i.e., it only depends on the adiabatic index.\n", "  We calculate the electromagnetic Pauli form factor of quark induced by the\nnontrivial topological fluctuations of QCD vacuum called instantons. It is\nshown that such contribution is significant. We discuss the possible\nimplications of our result in the photon-hadron reactions and in the dynamics\nof quark-photon interactions in the dense/hot quark matter.\n", "  The role of rescaling (expansion or squeezing) of quantized skyrmions is\nstudied for the spectrum of baryons beginning with nucleon and $\\Delta(1232)$,\nand with flavors strangeness, charm or beauty. The expansion of skyrmions due\nto the centrifugal forces has influence on the masses of baryons without flavor\n($N$ and especially $\\Delta$). The rescaling of skyrmions has smaller influence\non the spectrum of strange baryons, it is more important for the case of charm,\nand is crucial for baryons with beauty quantum number, where strong squeezing\ntakes place. Two competing tendencies are clearly observed: expansion of\nskyrmions when isospin (or spin) increases, and squeezing with increasing mass\nof the flavor. For the case of beauty baryon $\\Lambda_b$ satisfactory agreement\nwith data can be reached for the value $r_b= F_B/F_\\pi \\simeq 2.6 $, for the\ncase of $\\Sigma_b$ there should be $r_b\\sim 2$, so for the beauty flavor the\nmethod seems to be not quite satisfactory because of certain intrinsic\ndiscrepances. Some pentaquark states with hidden strangeness, charm or beauty\nare considered as well.\n", "  In this work, we present observable consequences of parity-violating odd\nviscosity term in incompressible 2+1D hydrodynamics. For boundary conditions\ndepending on the velocity field (flow) alone we show that: (i) The fluid flow\nquantified by the velocity field is independent of odd viscosity, (ii) The\nforce acting on a closed contour is independent of odd viscosity, and (iii) The\nodd viscosity part of torque on a closed contour is proportional to the rate of\nchange of area enclosed by the contour with the proportionality constant being\ntwice the odd viscosity. The last statement allows us to define a measurement\nprotocol of {\\it odd viscostance} in analogy to Hall resistance measurements.\nWe also consider {\\it no-stress} boundary conditions which explicitly depend on\nodd viscosity. A classic hydrodynamics problem with no-stress boundary\nconditions is that of a bubble in a planar Stokes flow. We solve this problem\nexactly for shear and hyperbolic flows and show that the steady-state shape of\nthe bubble in the shear flow depends explicitly on the value of odd viscosity.\n", "  We propose a novel model for including spin-orbit interactions in buckled two\ndimensional systems. Our results show that in such systems, intrinsic\nspin-orbit coupling leads to a formation of Dirac cones, similar to Rashba\nmodel. We explore the microscopic origins of this behaviour and confirm our\nresults using DFT calculations.\n", "  We show that a properly dc-biased Josephson junction in series with two\nmicrowave resonators of different frequencies emits photon pairs in the\nresonators. By measuring auto- and inter-correlations of the power leaking out\nof the resonators, we demonstrate two-mode amplitude squeezing below the\nclassical limit. This non-classical microwave light emission is found to be in\nquantitative agreement with our theoretical predictions, up to an emission rate\nof 2 billion photon pairs per second.\n", "  Using the FLASH code, which solves the full set of the two-dimensional (2-D)\nnon-ideal (resistive) time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we\nstudy processes during the magnetic reconnection in a vertical gravitationally\nstratified current sheet. We show that during these processes, which correspond\nto processes in solar flares, plasmoids are formed due to the tearing mode\ninstability of the current sheet. These plasmoids move upwards or downwards\nalong the vertical current sheet, and some of them merge into larger plasmoids.\nWe study the density and temperature structure of these plasmoids and their\ntime evolution in details. We found that during the merging of two plasmoids\nthe resulting larger plasmoid starts to oscillate; in our model with a $\\sim\n25~\\mathrm{s}$ period. On the other hand, the plasmoid moving downwards merges\nwith the underlying flare arcade which also starts to oscillate during this\nprocess; in our model with a $\\sim 35~\\mathrm{s}$ period. It is shown that the\nmerging process of plasmoid with the flare arcade is a complex process as\npresented by complex density and temperature structures of the oscillating\narcade. Moreover, all these processes are associated with magnetoacoustic waves\nproduced by the motion and merging of plasmoids.\n", "  The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes a collection of randomly\ninteracting Majorana fermions that exhibits profound connections to quantum\nchaos and black holes. We propose a solid-state implementation based on a\nquantum dot coupled to an array of topological superconducting wires hosting\nMajorana zero modes. Interactions and disorder intrinsic to the dot mediate the\ndesired random Majorana couplings, while an approximate symmetry suppresses\nadditional unwanted terms. We use random matrix theory and numerics to show\nthat our setup emulates the SYK model (up to corrections that we quantify) and\ndiscuss experimental signatures.\n", "  In this paper we study centrifugal acceleration of particles moving along a\nprescribed rotating curved trajectories. We consider the physical system\nembedded in an isotropic photon field and study the influence of the photon\ndrag force on the acceleration process. For this purpose we study three major\nconfigurations of the field lines: the straight line; the Archimede's spiral\nand the dipolar field line configuration. By analysing dynamics of particles\nsliding along the field lines in the equatorial plane we have found several\ninteresting features of motion. In particular, it has been shown that for\nrectilinear field lines the particles reach the light cylinder (area where the\nlinear velocity of rotation exactly equals the speed of light) zone relatively\nslowly for bigger drag forces. Considering the Archimede's spiral, we have\nfound that in cases when the field lines lag behind the rotation, the particles\nachieve the force-free regime of dynamics regardless of the drag force. Unlike\nthis scenario, when the spiral is screwed up in an opposite direction there the\nparticles do not reach the force free regime, but tend to stable equilibrium\nlocations. Such a behaviour has been found for straight field lines as well.\n", "  Beyond the Standard Model (SM) extensions usually include extended Higgs\nsectors. Models with singlet or doublet fields are the simplest ones that are\ncompatible with the $\\rho$ parameter constraint. The discovery of new non-SM\nHiggs bosons and the identification of the underlying model requires dedicated\nHiggs properties analyses. In this paper, we compare several Higgs sectors\nfeaturing 3 CP-even neutral Higgs bosons that are also motivated by their\nsimplicity and their capability to solve some of the flaws of the SM. They are:\nthe SM extended by a complex singlet field (CxSM), the singlet extension of the\n2-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM), and the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric SM\nextension (NMSSM). In addition, we analyse the CP-violating 2-Higgs-Doublet\nModel (C2HDM), which provides 3 neutral Higgs bosons with a pseudoscalar\nadmixture. This allows us to compare the effects of singlet and pseudoscalar\nadmixtures. Through dedicated scans of the allowed parameter space of the\nmodels, we analyse the phenomenologically viable scenarios from the view point\nof the SM-like Higgs boson and of the signal rates of the non-SM-like Higgs\nbosons to be found. In particular, we analyse the effect of\nsinglet/pseudoscalar admixture, and the potential to differentiate these models\nin the near future. This is supported by a study of couplings sums of the Higgs\nbosons to massive gauge bosons and to fermions, where we identify features that\nallow us to distinguish the models, in particular when only part of the Higgs\nspectrum is discovered. Our results can be taken as guidelines for future LHC\ndata analyses, by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, to identify specific benchmark\npoints aimed at revealing the underlying model.\n", "  Dynamical mechanisms to generate an ultralight axion of mass $\\sim\n10^{-21}-10^{-22}$ eV in supergravity and strings are discussed. An ultralight\nparticle of this mass provides a candidate for dark matter that may play a role\nfor cosmology at scales $10\\, {\\rm kpc}$ or less. An effective operator\napproach for the axion mass provides a general framework for models of\nultralight axions, and in one case recovers the scale $10^{-21}-10^{-22}$ eV as\nthe electroweak scale times the square of the hierarchy with an $O(1)$ Wilson\ncoefficient. We discuss several classes of models realizing this framework\nwhere an ultralight axion of the necessary size can be generated. In one class\nof supersymmetric models an ultralight axion is generated by instanton like\neffects. In the second class higher dimensional operators involving couplings\nof Higgs, standard model singlets, and axion fields naturally lead to an\nultralight axion. Further, for the class of models considered the hierarchy\nbetween the ultralight scale and the weak scale is maintained. We also discuss\nthe generation of an ultralight scale within string based models. Here it is\nshown that in the single modulus KKLT moduli stabilization scheme an ultralight\naxion would require an ultra-low weak scale. However, within the Large Volume\nScenario, the desired hierarchy between the axion scale and the weak scale is\nachieved. A general analysis of couplings of Higgs fields to instantons within\nthe string framework is discussed and it is shown that the condition necessary\nfor achieving such couplings is the existence of vector-like zero modes of the\ninstanton. Some of the phenomenological aspects of these models are also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We unravel theoretically a key intrinsic relaxation mechanism among the\nlow-lying singlet and triplet donor-pair states in silicon, an important\nelement in the fast-developing field of spintronics and quantum computation.\nDespite the perceived weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in Si, we find that our\ndiscovered relaxation mechanism, combined with the electron-phonon and\ninter-donor interactions, dominantly drives the transitions in the two-electron\nstates over a large range of donor coupling regime. The scaling of the\nrelaxation rate with inter-donor exchange interaction $J$ goes from $J^5$ to\n$J^4$ at the low to high temperature limits. Our analytical study draws on the\nsymmetry analysis over combined band, donor envelope and valley configurations.\nIt uncovers naturally the dependence on the donor-alignment direction and\ntriplet spin orientation, and especially on the dominant SOC source from donor\nimpurities. While a magnetic field is not necessary for this relaxation, unlike\nin the single-donor spin relaxation, we discuss the crossover behavior with\nincreasing Zeeman energy in order to facilitate comparison with experiments.\n", "  We present an infinite family of protocols to distill magic states for\n$T$-gates that has a low space overhead and uses an asymptotic number of input\nmagic states to achieve a given target error that is conjectured to be optimal.\nThe space overhead, defined as the ratio between the physical qubits to the\nnumber of output magic states, is asymptotically constant, while both the\nnumber of input magic states used per output state and the $T$-gate depth of\nthe circuit scale linearly in the logarithm of the target error $\\delta$ (up to\n$\\log \\log 1/\\delta$). Unlike other distillation protocols, this protocol\nachieves this performance without concatenation and the input magic states are\ninjected at various steps in the circuit rather than all at the start of the\ncircuit. The protocol can be modified to distill magic states for other gates\nat the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, with the same asymptotic\nperformance. The protocol relies on the construction of weakly self-dual CSS\ncodes with many logical qubits and large distance, allowing us to implement\ncontrol-SWAPs on multiple qubits. We call this code the \"inner code\". The\ncontrol-SWAPs are then used to measure properties of the magic state and detect\nerrors, using another code that we call the \"outer code\". Alternatively, we use\nweakly-self dual CSS codes which implement controlled Hadamards for the inner\ncode, reducing circuit depth. We present several specific small examples of\nthis protocol.\n", "  We demonstrate a two-dimensional grating magneto-optical trap (2D GMOT) with\na single input cooling laser beam and a planar diffraction grating using\n$^{87}$Rb. This configuration increases experimental access when compared with\na traditional 2D MOT. As described in the paper, the output flux is several\nhundred million rubidium atoms/s at a mean velocity of $16.5(9)$ m/s and a\nvelocity distribution of $4(3)$ m/s standard deviation. We use the atomic beam\nfrom the 2D GMOT to demonstrate loading of a three dimensional grating MOT (3D\nGMOT) with $2.46(7)\\times 10^8$ atoms. Methods to improve output flux are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In a recent Letter [T.~Dornheim \\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{117}, 156403 (2016)], we presented the first \\textit{ab initio} quantum\nMonte-Carlo (QMC) results of the warm dense electron gas in the thermodynamic\nlimit. However, a complete parametrization of the exchange-correlation free\nenergy with respect to density, temperature, and spin polarization remained out\nof reach due to the absence of (i) accurate QMC results below\n$\\theta=k_\\text{B}T/E_\\text{F}=0.5$ and (ii) of QMC results for spin\npolarizations different from the paramagnetic case. Here we overcome both\nremaining limitations. By closing the gap to the ground state and by performing\nextensive QMC simulations for different spin polarizations, we are able to\nobtain the first complete \\textit{ab initio} exchange-correlation free energy\nfunctional; the accuracy achieved is an unprecedented $\\sim 0.3\\%$. This also\nallows us to quantify the accuracy and systematic errors of various previous\napproximate functionals.\n", "  Since the seminal observation of room-temperature laser emission from ZnO\nthin films and nanowires, numerous attempts have been carried out for detailed\nunderstanding of the lasing mechanism in ZnO. In spite of the extensive efforts\nperformed over the last decades, the origin of optical gain at room temperature\nis still a matter of considerable discussion,. We show that ZnO microcrystals\nwith a size of a few micrometers exhibit purely excitonic lasing at room\ntemperature without showing any symptoms of electron-hole plasma emission. We\nthen present the distinct experimental evidence that the room-temperature\nexcitonic lasing is achieved not by exciton-exciton scattering, as has been\ngenerally believed, but by exciton-electron scattering. As the temperature is\nlowered below ~150 K, the lasing mechanism is shifted from the exciton-electron\nscattering to the exciton-exciton scattering. We also argue that the ease of\ncarrier diffusion plays a significant role in showing room-temperature\nexcitonic lasing.\n", "  It is well recognized that looking for new physics at lower energy colliders\nis a tendency which is complementary to high energy machines such as LHC. Based\non large database of BESIII, we may have a unique opportunity to do a good job.\nIn this paper we calculate the branching ratios of semi-leptonic processes\n$D^+_s \\to K^+ e^-e^+$, $D^+_s \\to K^+ e^-\\mu^+$ and leptonic processes $D^0\n\\to e^-e^+$, $D^0 \\to e^-\\mu^+$ in the frames of $U(1)'$ model, 2HDM and\nunparticle separately. It is found that both the $U(1)'$ and 2HDM may influence\nthe semi-leptonic decay rates, but only the $U(1)'$ offers substantial\ncontributions to the pure leptonic decays and the resultant branching ratio of\n$D^0 \\to e^-\\mu^+$ can be as large as $10^{-7}\\sim10^{-8}$ which might be\nobserved at the future super $\\tau$-charm factory.\n", "  Dijet events are studied in the proton--proton collision dataset recorded at\n$\\sqrt{s}=$13 TeV with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider in 2015\nand 2016, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 3.5 fb$^{-1}$ and 33.5\nfb$^{-1}$ respectively. Invariant mass and angular distributions are compared\nto background predictions and no significant deviation is observed. For\nresonance searches, a new method for fitting the background component of the\ninvariant mass distribution is employed. The dataset is then used to set upper\nlimits at a 95% confidence level on a range of new physics scenarios. Excited\nquarks with masses below 6.0 TeV are excluded, and limits are set on quantum\nblack holes, heavy W' bosons, W* bosons, and a range of masses and couplings in\na Z' dark matter mediator model. Model-independent limits on signals with a\nGaussian shape are also set, using a new approach allowing factorization of\nphysics and detector effects. From the angular distributions, a scale of new\nphysics in contact interaction models is excluded for scenarios with either\nconstructive or destructive interference. These results represent a substantial\nimprovement over those obtained previously with lower integrated luminosity.\n", "  Nonlinearities in a realistic axion field potential may play an important\nrole in the cosmological dynamics. In this paper we use the Boltzmann code\nCLASS to solve the background and linear perturbations evolution of an axion\nfield and contrast our results with those of CDM and the free axion case. We\nconclude that there is a slight delay in the onset of the axion field\noscillations when nonlinearities in the axion potential are taken into account.\nBesides, we identify a tachyonic instability of linear modes resulting in the\npresence of a bump in the power spectrum at small scales. Some comments are in\nturn about the true source of the tachyonic instability, how the parameters of\nthe axionlike potential can be constrained by Ly-$\\alpha$ observations, and the\nconsequences in the stability of self-gravitating objects made of axions.\n", "  Based on the technique of periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN)\nwaveguide, up-conversion single-photon detection at 1.064-{\\mu}m is\ndemonstrated. We have achieved a system photon detection efficiency (DE) of\n32.5% with a very low noise count rate (NCR) of 45 counts per second (cps) by\npumping with a 1.55-{\\mu}m-band single frequency laser using the\nlong-wavelength pumping technique and exploiting volume Bragg grating (VBG) as\na narrow band filter. Replacing the VBG with a combination of adequate\ndielectric filters, a DE of up to 38% with a NCR of 700 cps is achieved, making\nthe overall system more stable and practical. The up-conversion single-photon\ndetector (SPD) operating at 1.064 {\\mu}m can be a promising robust counter and\nfind usage in many fields.\n", "  Chiral representations are the key in obtaining light fermions from some\nultra-violet completed theories. The well-known chiral example is one family\nset of fifteen chiral fields in the standard model. We find a new chiral theory\nSU(2)$_{\\rm dark}\\times$U(1)$_Q$ with sixteen chiral fields, which does not\nhave any gauge and gravitational anomalies. The group SU(2)$_{\\rm\ndark}\\times$U(1)$_Q$ may belong to the dark sector, and we present a derivation\nof the spectrum from the E$_8\\times$E$_8'$ hetrotic string. Necessarily, there\nappear two degrees at low energy: two dark Z's, or a dark Z plus a dark-photon.\nBeing chiral, there is a chance to probe this theory at TeV accelerators. Since\nthe model belongs to the dark sector, the way to probe it is through the\nkinetic mixing.\n", "  The framework of phenomenological quark-antiquark potential (Coulomb plus\nlinear confinement) model with the Gaussian wave function is used for detailed\nstudy of masses of the ground, orbitally and radially excited states of\nheavy-light $Q\\overline{q}$, $\\left(Q=c,q=u/d,s\\right)$ mesons. We incorporate\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/m)$ correction to the potential energy term and relativistic\ncorrections to the kinetic energy term of the hamiltonian. The spin-hyperfine,\nthe spin-orbit and the tensor interactions incorporating the effect of mixing\nare employed to obtained the pseudoscalar, the vector, radially and orbitally\nexcited states meson masses. The Regge trajectories in the $(J,M^{2})$ and\n$(n_r,M^{2})$ planes for heavy-light meson are investigated with their\ncorresponding parameters. Leptonic and radiative leptonic decay widths and\ncorresponding branching ratios are computed. The mixing parameters are also\nestimated in the present work. Our predictions are in good agreement with\nexperimental results as well as lattice and other theoretical models.\n", "  It is shown that the addition of positive mass-squared terms to\nasymptotically safe gauge-Yukawa theories with perturbative UV fixed points\nleads to calculable radiative symmetry breaking in the IR. This phenomenon, and\nthe multiplicative running of the operators that lies behind it, is akin to the\nradiative symmetry breaking that occurs in the Supersymmetric Standard Model.\n", "  We study the scattering of Dark Matter particles off various light nuclei\nwithin the framework of chiral effective field theory. We focus on scalar\ninteractions and include one- and two-nucleon scattering processes whose form\nand strength are dictated by chiral symmetry. The nuclear wave functions are\ncalculated from chiral effective field theory interactions as well and we\ninvestigate the convergence pattern of the chiral expansion in the nuclear\npotential and the Dark Matter-nucleus currents. This allows us to provide a\nsystematic uncertainty estimate of our calculations. We provide results for\n${}^2$H, ${}^3$H, and ${}^3$He nuclei which are theoretically interesting and\nthe latter is a potential target for experiments. We show that two-nucleon\ncurrents can be systematically included but are generally smaller than\npredicted by power counting and suffer from significant theoretical\nuncertainties even in light nuclei. We demonstrate that accurate high-order\nwave functions are necessary in order to incorporate two-nucleon currents. We\ndiscuss scenarios in which one-nucleon contributions are suppressed such that\nhigher-order currents become dominant.\n", "  Single-molecule FRET is widely used to study helicases by detecting distance\nchanges between a fluorescent donor and an acceptor anchored to overhangs of a\nforked DNA duplex. However, it has lacked single-base pair (1-bp) resolution\nrequired for revealing stepping dynamics in unwinding because FRET signals are\nusually blurred by thermal fluctuations of the overhangs. We designed a\nnanotensioner in which a short DNA is bent to exert a force on the overhangs,\njust as in optical/magnetic tweezers. The strategy improved the resolution of\nFRET to 0.5 bp, high enough to uncover the differences in DNA unwinding by\nyeast Pif1 and E. coli RecQ whose unwinding behaviors cannot be differentiated\nby currently practiced methods. We found that Pif1 exhibits 1-bp-stepping\nkinetics, while RecQ breaks 1 bp at a time but questers the nascent nucleotides\nand releases them randomly. The high-resolution data allowed us to propose a\nthree-parameter model to quantitatively interpret the apparently different\nunwinding behaviors of the two helicases which belong to two superfamilies.\n", "  We present several new exact solutions in five and higher dimensional\nEinstein-Maxwell theory by embedding the Nutku instanton. The metric functions\nfor the five-dimensional solutions depend only on a radial coordinate and on\ntwo spatial coordinates for the six and higher dimensional solutions. The six\nand higher dimensional metric functions are convoluted-like integrals of two\nspecial functions. We find that the solutions are regular almost everywhere and\nsome spatial sections of the solution describe wormhole handles. We also find a\nclass of exact and nonstationary convoluted-like solutions to the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory with a cosmological constant.\n", "  We identify a largely model-independent signature of dark matter interactions\nwith nucleons and electrons. Dark matter in the local galactic halo,\ngravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against\nand deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared\nblackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected\nby the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European\nExtremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from\nneutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic\ncenter, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark\nmatter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or\nspin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding $2 \\times 10^{-45}$\ncm$^2$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For\nlighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with\ndark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter,\nit scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for\ncapture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could\ndetermine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron\nstars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur\nin relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like\npure Higgsinos can also be discovered.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the intrinsic geometric structure of interior\ntransmission eigenfunctions arising in wave scattering theory. We numerically\nshow that the aforementioned geometric structure can be much delicate and\nintriguing. The major findings can be roughly summarized as follows. If there\nis a cusp on the support of the underlying potential function, then the\ninterior transmission eigenfunction vanishes near the cusp if its interior\nangle is less than $\\pi$, whereas the interior transmission eigenfunction\nlocalizes near the cusp if its interior angle is bigger than $\\pi$.\nFurthermore, we show that the vanishing and blowup orders are inversely\nproportional to the interior angle of the cusp: the sharper the angle, the\nhigher the convergence order. Our results are first of its type in the spectral\ntheory for transmission eigenvalue problems, and the existing studies in the\nliterature concentrate more on the intrinsic properties of the transmission\neigenvalues instead of the transmission eigenfunctions. Due to the limitedness\nof the computing resources, our study is by no means exclusive and complete. We\nconsider our study only in a certain geometric setup including corner, curved\ncorner and edge singularities. Nevertheless, we believe that similar results\nhold for more general cusp singularities and rigorous theoretical\njustifications are much desirable. Our study enriches the spectral theory for\ntransmission eigenvalue problems. We also discuss its implication to inverse\nscattering theory.\n", "  Tensor networks impose a notion of geometry on the entanglement of a quantum\nsystem. In some cases, this geometry is found to reproduce key properties of\nholographic dualities, and subsequently much work has focused on using tensor\nnetworks as tractable models for holographic dualities. Conventionally, the\nstructure of the network - and hence the geometry - is largely fixed a priori\nby the choice of tensor network ansatz. Here, we evade this restriction and\ndescribe an unbiased approach that allows us to extract the appropriate\ngeometry from a given quantum state. We develop an algorithm that iteratively\nfinds a unitary circuit that transforms a given quantum state into an\nunentangled product state. We then analyze the structure of the resulting\nunitary circuits. In the case of non-interacting, critical systems in one\ndimension, we recover signatures of scale invariance in the unitary network,\nand we show that appropriately defined geodesic paths between physical degrees\nof freedom exhibit known properties of a hyperbolic geometry.\n", "  We evaluate the s-wave interaction of pseudoscalar and vector mesons with\nboth charm and beauty to investigate the possible existence of molecular $BD$,\n$B^*D$, $BD^*$, $B^*D^*$, $B\\bar D$, $B^*\\bar D$, $B\\bar D^*$ or $B^* \\bar D^*$\nmeson states. The scattering amplitude is obtained implementing unitarity\nstarting from a tree level potential accounting for the dominant vector meson\nexchange. The diagrams are evaluated using suitable extensions to the heavy\nflavor sector of the hidden gauge symmetry Lagrangians involving vector and\npseudoscalar mesons{, respecting heavy quark spin symmetry}. We obtain bound\nstates at energies above 7 GeV for $BD$ ($J^P=0^+$), $B^*D$ ($1^+$), $BD^*$\n($1^+$) and $B^*D^*$ ($0^+$, $1^+$, $2^+$), all in isospin 0. For $B\\bar D$\n($0^+$), $B^*\\bar D$ ($1^+$), $B\\bar D^*$ ($1^+$) and $B^*\\bar D^*$ ($0^+$,\n$1^+$, $2^+$) we also find similar bound states in $I=0$, but much less bound,\nwhich would correspond to exotic meson states with $\\bar b$ and $\\bar c$\nquarks, and for the $I=1$ we find a repulsive interaction. We also evaluate the\nscattering lengths in all cases, which can be tested in current investigations\nof lattice QCD.\n", "  The energy spectrum and eigenstates of single-layer black phosphorous\nnanoribbons in the presence of perpendicular magnetic field and in-plane\ntransverse electric field are investigated by means of a tight-binding method\nand the effect of different types of edges is analytically examined. A\ndescription based on a new continuous model is proposed by expansion of the\ntight-binding model in the long-wavelength approximation. The wavefunctions\ncorresponding to the flatband part of the spectrum are obtained analytically\nand are shown to approach agree well with the numerical results from the\ntight-binding method. Analytical expressions for the critical magnetic field at\nwhich Landau levels are formed and the ranges of wavenumbers in the\ndispersionless flat-band segments in the energy spectra are derived. We examine\nthe evolution of the Landau levels when an in-plane lateral electric field is\napplied and determine analytically how the edge states shift with magnetic\nfield.\n", "  We have made thermal and electrical transport measurements of uncompressed\npyrolytic graphite sheet (uPGS), a mass-produced thin graphite sheet with\nvarious thicknesses between 10 and 100 {\\mu}m, at temperatures between 2 and\n300 K. Compared to exfoliated graphite sheets like Grafoil, uPGS has much\nhigher conductivities by an order of magnitude because of its high\ncrystallinity confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. This\nmaterial is advantageous as a thermal link of light weight in a wide\ntemperature range particularly above 60 K where the thermal conductivity is\nmuch higher than common thermal conductors such as copper and aluminum alloys.\nWe also found a general relationship between thermal and electrical\nconductivities in graphite-based materials which have highly anisotropic\nconductivities. This would be useful to estimate thermal conductance of a\ncryogenic part made of these materials from its electrical conductance more\neasily measurable at low temperature.\n", "  We develop a hybrid formalism suitable for modeling scalar field dark matter,\nin which the phase-space distribution associated to the real scalar field is\nmodeled by statistical equal-time two-point functions and gravity is treated by\ntwo stochastic gravitational fields in the longitudinal gauge (in this work we\nneglect vector and tensor gravitational perturbations). Inspired by the\ncommonly used Newtonian Vlasov-Poisson system, we firstly identify a suitable\ncombination of equal-time two-point functions that defines the phase-space\ndistribution associated to the scalar field and then derive both a kinetic\nequation that contains relativistic scalar matter corrections as well as linear\ngravitational scalar field equations whose sources can be expressed in terms of\na momentum integral over the phase-space distribution function. Our treatment\ngeneralizes the commonly used classical scalar field formalism, in that it\nallows for modeling of (dynamically generated) vorticity and perturbations in\nanisotropic stresses of the scalar field. It also allows for a systematic\ninclusion of relativistic and higher order corrections that may be used to\ndistinguish different dark matter scenarios. We also provide initial conditions\nfor the statistical equal-time two-point functions of the matter scalar field\nin terms of gravitational potentials and the scale factor.\n", "  Conjugate points play an important role in the proofs of the singularity\ntheorems of Hawking and Penrose. We examine the relation between singularities\nand conjugate points in FLRW spacetimes with a singularity. In particular we\nprove a theorem that when a non-comoving, non-spacelike geodesic in a singular\nFLRW spacetime obeys conditions (39) and (40), every point on that geodesic is\npart of a pair of conjugate points. The proof is based on the Raychaudhuri\nequation. We find that the theorem is applicable to all non-comoving,\nnon-spacelike geodesics in FLRW spacetimes with non-negative spatial curvature\nand scale factors that near the singularity have power law behavior or power\nlaw behavior times a logarithm. When the spatial curvature is negative, the\ntheorem is applicable to a subset of these spacetimes.\n", "  Realizing long distance entanglement swapping with independent sources in the\nreal-world condition is important for both future quantum network and\nfundamental study of quantum theory. Currently, demonstration over a few of\ntens kilometer underground optical fiber has been achieved. However, future\napplications demand entanglement swapping over longer distance with more\ncomplicated environment. We exploit two independent 1-GHz-clock sequential\ntime-bin entangled photon-pair sources, develop several automatic stability\ncontrols, and successfully implement a field test of entanglement swapping over\nmore than 100-km optical fiber link including coiled, underground and suspended\noptical fibers. Our result verifies the feasibility of such technologies for\nlong distance quantum network and for many interesting quantum information\nexperiments.\n", "  The CIBER collaboration released their first observational data of the Cosmic\nIR background (CIB) radiation, which has significant excesses at around the\nwavelength $\\sim$ 1 $\\mu$m compared to theoretically-inferred values. The\namount of the CIB radiation has a significant influence on the opaqueness of\nthe Universe for TeV gamma-rays emitted from distant sources such as AGNs. With\nthe value of CIB radiation reported by the CIBER experiment, through the\nreaction of such TeV gamma-rays with the CIB photons, the TeV gamma-rays should\nbe significantly attenuated during propagation, which would lead to energy\nspectra in disagreement with current observations of TeV gamma ray sources. In\nthis article, we discuss a possible resolution of this tension between the TeV\ngamma-ray observations and the CIB data in terms of axion [or Axion-Like\nParticles (ALPs)] that may increase the transparency of the Universe by the\nanomaly-induced photon-axion mixing. We find a region in the parameter space of\nthe axion mass, $m_a \\sim 7 \\times 10^{-10} - 5 \\times 10^{-8}$eV, and the\naxion-photon coupling constant, $1.2 \\times 10^{-11} {\\rm GeV}^{-1} \\lesssim\ng_{a\\gamma} \\lesssim 8.8 \\times 10^{-10} {\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ that solves this\nproblem.\n", "  This study contributes to the evaluation of the robustness and accuracy of\nGreen's function reconstruction from cross-correlation of strongly dispersed\nreverberated signals, with disentangling of the respective roles of ballistic\nand reverberated ('coda') contributions. We conduct a suite of experiments on a\nhighly reverberating thin duralumin plate, where an approximately diffuse\nflexural wavefield is generated by taking advantage of the plate reverberation\nand wave dispersion. A large number of impulsive sources that cover the whole\nsurface of the plate are used to validate ambient-noise theory through\ncomparison of the causal and anticausal (i.e., positive- and negative-time)\nterms of the cross-correlation to one another, and to the directly measured\nGreen's function. To quantify the contribution of the ballistic and coda\nsignals, the cross-correlation integral is defined over different time windows\nof variable length, and the accuracy of the reconstructed Green's function is\nstudied as a function of the initial and end times of the integral. We show\nthat even cross-correlations measured over limited time windows converge to a\nsignificant part of the Green's function. Convergence is achieved over a wide\ntime window, which includes not only direct flexural-wave arrivals, but also\nthe multiply reverberated coda. We propose a model, based on normal-mode\nanalysis that relates the similarity between the cross-correlation and the\nGreen's function to the statistical properties of the plate. We also determine\nquantitatively how incoherent noise degrades the estimation of the Green's\nfunction.\n", "  Within the standard approach of effective field theory of weak interactions\nfor $\\Delta B = 1$ transitions, we look for possibly unexpected subtle New\nPhysics effects, here dubbed \"flavourful Easter eggs\". We perform a Bayesian\nglobal fit using the publicly available HEPfit package, taking into account\nstate-of-the-art experimental information concerning these processes, including\nthe suggestive measurements from LHCb of $R_{K}$ and $R_{K^{*}}$, the latter\navailable only very recently. We parametrize New Physics contributions to $b\n\\to s$ transitions in terms of shifts of Wilson coefficients of the\nelectromagnetic dipole and semi-leptonic operators, assuming CP-conserving\neffects, but allowing in general for violation of lepton flavour universality.\nWe show how optimistic/conservative hadronic estimates can impact\nquantitatively the size of New Physics extracted from the fit. With a\nconservative approach to hadronic uncertainties we find nonzero New Physics\ncontributions to Wilson coefficients at the level of $\\sim 3\\sigma$, depending\non the model chosen. Furthermore, given the interplay between hadronic\ncontributions and New Physics effects in the leptonic vector current, a\nscenario with nonstandard leptonic axial currents is comparable to the more\nwidely advocated one with New Physics in the leptonic vector current.\n", "  Using time-resolved Kerr rotation, we measure the spin/valley dynamics of\nresident electrons and holes in single charge-tunable monolayers of the\narchetypal transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor WSe2. In the\nn-type regime, we observe long (70 ns) polarization relaxation of electrons\nthat is sensitive to in-plane magnetic fields $B_y$, indicating spin\nrelaxation. In marked contrast, extraordinarily long (2 microsecond)\npolarization relaxation of holes is revealed in the p-type regime, that is\nunaffected by $B_y$, directly confirming long-standing expectations of strong\nspin-valley locking of holes in the valence band of monolayer TMDs. Supported\nby continuous-wave Kerr spectroscopy and Hanle measurements, these studies\nprovide a unified picture of carrier polarization dynamics in monolayer TMDs,\nwhich can guide design principles for future valleytronic devices.\n", "  We analyze the statistics of loops formation in $f$-branched star polymers in\nan environment with structural defects, correlated at large distances $r$\naccording to a power law $\\sim r^{-a}$. Applying the direct polymer\nrenormalization approach, we found the values of the set of universal\nexponents, governing the scaling of probabilities of various types of loops in\nmacromolecules.\n", "  We report on the results of a $Suzaku$ observation of the plasma in the\nfilament located between the two massive clusters of galaxies Abell 399 and\nAbell 401. Abell 399 ($z$=0.0724) and Abell 401 ($z$=0.0737) are expected to be\nin the initial phase of a cluster merger. In the region between the two\nclusters, we find a clear enhancement in the temperature of the filament plasma\nfrom 4 keV (expected value from a typical cluster temperature profile) to\n$kT\\sim$6.5 keV. Our analysis also shows that filament plasma is present out to\na radial distance of 15' (1.3 Mpc) from a line connecting the two clusters. The\ntemperature profile is characterized by an almost flat radial shape with\n$kT\\sim$6-7 keV within 10' or $\\sim$0.8 Mpc. Across $r$=8'~from the axis, the\ntemperature of the filament plasma shows a drop from 6.3 keV to 5.1 keV,\nindicating the presence of a shock front. The Mach number based on the\ntemperature drop is estimated to be ${\\cal M}\\sim$1.3. We also successfully\ndetermined the abundance profile up to 15' (1.3 Mpc), showing an almost\nconstant value ($Z$=0.3 solar) at the cluster outskirt. We estimated the\nCompton $y$-parameter to be $\\sim$14.5$\\pm1.3\\times10^{-6}$, which is in\nagreement with $Planck$'s results (14-17$\\times10^{-6}$ on the filament). The\nline of sight depth of the filament is $l\\sim$1.1 Mpc, indicating that the\ngeometry of filament is likely a pancake shape rather than cylindrical. The\ntotal mass of the filamentary structure is $\\sim$7.7$\\times10^{13}~\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$. We discuss a possible interpretation of the drop of X-ray emission\nat the rim of the filament, which was pushed out by the merging activity and\nformed by the accretion flow induced by the gravitational force of the\nfilament.\n", "  Quasi-Normal Modes (QNM) or ringdown phase of gravitational waves provide\ncritical information about the structure of compact objects like Black Holes.\nThus, QNMs can be a tool to test General Relativity (GR) and possible\ndeviations from it. In the case of GR, it is known for a long time that a\nrelation between two types of Black Hole perturbations: scalar (Zerilli) and\nvector (Regge-Wheeler), leads to an equal share of emitted gravitational\nenergy. With the direct detection of Gravitational waves, it is now natural to\nask: whether the same relation (between scalar and vector perturbations) holds\nfor modified gravity theories? If not, whether one can use this as a way to\nprobe deviations from General Relativity. As a first step, we show explicitly\nthat the above relation between Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli breaks down for a\ngeneral f (R) model, and hence the two perturbations do not share equal amounts\nof emitted gravitational energy. We discuss the implication of this imbalance\non observations and the no-hair conjecture.\n", "  The second law of photochemistry states that in most cases, no more than one\nmolecule is activated for an excited-state reaction for each photon absorbed by\na collection of molecules. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to\ntrigger a many-molecule reaction using only one photon by strongly coupling the\nmolecular ensemble to a confined light mode. The collective nature of the\nresulting hybrid states of the system (the so-called polaritons) leads to the\nformation of a polaritonic \"supermolecule\" involving the degrees of freedom of\nall molecules, opening a reaction path on which all involved molecules undergo\na chemical transformation. We theoretically investigate the system conditions\nfor this effect to take place and be enhanced.\n", "  We evaluate the impact of sterile neutrino oscillations in the so-called 3+1\nscenario on the proposed long baseline experiment in USA and Japan. There are\ntwo proposals for the Japan experiment which are called T2HK and T2HKK. We show\nthe impact of sterile neutrino oscillation parameters on the expected\nsensitivity of T2HK and T2HKK to mass hierarchy, CP violation and octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$ and compare it against that expected in the case of standard\noscillations. We add the expected ten years data from DUNE and present the\ncombined expected sensitivity of T2HKK+DUNE to the oscillation parameters. We\ndo a full marginalisation over the relevant parameter space and show the effect\nof the magnitude of the true sterile mixing angles on the physics reach of\nthese experiments. We show that if one assumes that the source of CP violation\nis the standard CP phase alone in the test case, then it appears that the\nexpected CP violation sensitivity decreases due to sterile neutrinos. However,\nif we give up this assumption, then the CP sensitivity could go in either\ndirection. The impact on expected octant of $\\theta_{23}$ and mass hierarchy\nsensitivity is shown to depend on the magnitude of the sterile mixing angles in\na nontrivial way.\n", "  Accretion of gas and interaction of matter and radiation are at the heart of\nmany questions pertaining to black hole (BH) growth and coevolution of massive\nBHs and their host galaxies. To answer them it is critical to quantify how the\nionizing radiation that emanates from the innermost regions of the BH accretion\nflow couples to the surrounding medium and how it regulates the BH fueling. In\nthis work we use high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations with the code Enzo, equipped with adaptive ray tracing module\nMoray, to investigate radiation-regulated BH accretion of cold gas. Our\nsimulations reproduce findings from an earlier generation of 1D/2D simulations:\nthe accretion powered UV and X-ray radiation forms a highly ionized bubble,\nwhich leads to suppression of BH accretion rate characterized by quasi-periodic\noutbursts. A new feature revealed by the 3D simulations is the highly turbulent\nnature of the gas flow in vicinity of the ionization front. During quiescent\nperiods between accretion outbursts, the ionized bubble shrinks in size and the\ngas density that precedes the ionization front increases. Consequently, the 3D\nsimulations show oscillations in the accretion rate of only ~2-3 orders of\nmagnitude, significantly smaller than 1D/2D models. We calculate the energy\nbudget of the gas flow and find that turbulence is the main contributor to the\nkinetic energy of the gas but corresponds to less than 10% of its thermal\nenergy and thus does not contribute significantly to the pressure support of\nthe gas.\n", "  We firstly report an axion haloscope search with toroidal geometry. In this\npioneering search, we exclude the axion-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$\ndown to about $5\\times10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the axion mass range from 24.7\nto 29.1 $\\mu$eV at a 95\\% confidence level. The prospects for axion dark matter\nsearches with larger scale toroidal geometry are also considered.\n", "  We study the fission yield of recently predicted thermally fissile\nneutron-rich uranium and thorium nuclei using statistical model. The level\ndensity parameters needed for the study are evaluated from the excitation\nenergies of temperature dependent relativistic mean field formalism. The\nexcitation energy and the level density parameter for a given temperature are\nemployed in the convolution integral method to obtain the probability of the\nparticular fragmentation. As representative case, we present the results for\nthe binary fission yield of 250 U and 254 Th. The relative yields are presented\nfor three different temperatures T = 1, 2 and 3 MeV.\n", "  In the study of covariant wave equations, linear gravity manifests itself\nthrough the metric deviation $\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}$ and a two-point vector potential\n$K_{\\lambda}$ itself constructed from $\\gamma_{\\mu\\nu}$ and its derivatives.\nThe simultaneous presence of the two gravitational potentials is non\ncontradictory. Particles also assume the character of quasiparticles and\n$K_{\\lambda}$ carries information about the matter with which it interacts. We\nconsider the influence of $K_{\\lambda}$ on the dispersion relations of the\nparticles involved, the particles' motion, quantum tunneling through a horizon,\nradiation, energy-momentum dissipation and flux quantization. % No {\\it REVTEX}\nlimit to number of lines.\n", "  In the context of f(R)=R + alpha R^2 gravity, we study the existence of\nneutron and quark stars with no intermediate approximations in the generalised\nsystem of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equations. Analysis shows that for positive\nalpha's the scalar curvature does not drop to zero at the star surface (as in\nGeneral Relativity) but exponentially decreases with distance. Also the stellar\nmass bounded by star surface decreases when the value alpha increases.\nNonetheless distant observers would observe a gravitational mass due to\nappearance of a so-called gravitational sphere around the star. The non-zero\ncurvature contribution to the gravitational mass eventually is shown to\ncompensate the stellar mass decrease for growing alpha's. We perform our\nanalysis for several equations of state including purely hadronic\nconfigurations as well as hyperons and quark stars. In all cases, we assess\nthat the relation between the parameter $\\alpha$ and the gravitational mass\nweakly depend upon the chosen equation of state. Another interesting feature is\nthe increase of the star radius in comparison to General Relativity for stars\nwith masses close to maximal, whereas for intermediate masses around 1.4-1.6\nsolar masses, the radius of star depends upon alpha very weakly. Also the\ndecrease in the mass bounded by star surface may cause the surface redshift to\ndecrease in R^2-gravity when compared to Einsteinian predictions. This effect\nis shown to hardly depend upon the observed gravitational mass. Finally, for\nnegative values of alpha our analysis shows that outside the star the scalar\ncurvature has damped oscillations but the contribution of the gravitational\nsphere into the gravitational mass increases indefinitely with radial distance\nputting into question the very existence of such relativistic stars.\n", "  Decays of $B^0$ and $B_{s}^0$ mesons to the charmless baryonic final states\n$p \\overline{p} h^+ h^{\\prime-}$, where $h$ and $h^\\prime$ each denote a kaon\nor a pion, are searched for using the LHCb detector. The analysis is based on a\nsample of proton-proton collision data collected at center-of-mass energies of\n$7$ and $8\\,$TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\\,$fb$^{-1}$.\nFour-body charmless baryonic $B_{s}^0$ decays are observed for the first time.\nThe decays $B^0_{s}\\to p \\overline{p} K^+ K^-$, $B^0_{s}\\to p \\overline{p}\nK^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$, $B^0\\to p \\overline{p} K^\\pm \\pi^\\mp$ and\n  $B^0\\to p \\overline{p} \\pi^+\\pi^-$ are observed with a significance greater\nthan $5$ standard deviations; evidence at $4.1$ standard deviations is found\nfor the $B^0\\to p \\overline{p} K^+ K^-$ decay and an upper limit is set on the\nbranching fraction for $B^0_{s}\\to p \\overline{p} \\pi^+ \\pi^-$. Branching\nfractions in the kinematic region $m(p \\overline{p})<2850\\,$MeV$/c^2$ are\nmeasured relative to the $B^0 \\to J/\\psi (\\to p \\overline{p}) K^*(892)^0$\nchannel.\n", "  The low-energy dynamics of any system admitting a continuum of static\nconfigurations is approximated by slow motion in moduli (configuration) space.\nHere, following Ferrell and Eardley, this moduli space approximation is\nutilized to study collisions of two maximally charged Reissner--Nordstr{\\\"o}m\nblack holes of arbitrary masses, and to compute analytically the gravitational\nradiation generated by their scattering or coalescence. The motion remains slow\neven though the fields are strong, and the leading radiation is quadrupolar. A\nsimple expression for the gravitational waveform is derived and compared at\nearly and late times to expectations.\n", "  We generalize the classical junction conditions for constructing impulsive\ngravitational waves by the Penrose \"cut and paste\" method. Specifically, we\nstudy nonexpanding impulses which propagate in spaces of constant curvature\nwith any value of the cosmological constant (that is Minkowski, de Sitter, or\nanti-de Sitter universes) when additional off-diagonal metric components are\npresent. Such components encode a possible angular momentum of the\nultra-relativistic source of the impulsive wave - the so called gyraton. We\nexplicitly derive and analyze a specific transformation that relates the\ndistributional form of the metric to a new form which is (Lipschitz)\ncontinuous. Such a transformation automatically implies an extended version of\nthe Penrose junction conditions. It turns out that the conditions for\nidentifying points of the background spacetime across the impulse are the same\nas in the original Penrose \"cut and paste\" construction, but their derivatives\nnow directly represent the influence of the gyraton on the axial motion of test\nparticles. Our results apply both for vacuum and nonvacuum solutions of\nEinstein's field equations, and can also be extended to other theories of\ngravity.\n", "  Although geometric phases in quantum evolution were historically overlooked,\ntheir active control now stimulates strategies for constructing robust quantum\ntechnologies. Here, we demonstrate arbitrary single-qubit holonomic gates from\na single cycle of non-adiabatic evolution, eliminating the need to concatenate\ntwo separate cycles. Our method varies the amplitude, phase, and detuning of a\ntwo-tone optical field to control the non-Abelian geometric phase acquired by a\nnitrogen-vacancy center in diamond over a coherent excitation cycle. We\ndemonstrate the enhanced robustness of detuned gates to excited-state\ndecoherence and provide insights for optimizing fast holonomic control in\ndissipative quantum systems.\n", "  We calculate the $\\beta$-functions for $SO(N)$ and $SU(N)$ gauge theories\ncoupled to adjoint and fundamental scalar representations, correcting\nlong-standing, previous results. We explore the constraints on $N$ resulting\nfrom requiring asymptotic freedom for all couplings. When we take into account\nthe actual allowed behavior of the gauge coupling, the minimum value of $N$ in\nboth cases turns out to be larger than realized in earlier treatments. We also\nshow that in the large $N$ limit, both models have large regions of parameter\nspace corresponding to total asymptotic freedom.\n", "  The self-annihilation of dark matter particles with mass in the MeV range can\nproduce gamma rays via prompt or secondary radiation. The annihilation rate for\nsuch light dark matter particles is however tightly constrained by cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) data. Here we explore the possibility of discovering\nMeV dark matter annihilation with future MeV gamma-ray telescopes taking into\naccount the latest and future CMB constraints. We study the optimal energy\nwindow as a function of the dominant annihilation final state. We consider both\nthe (conservative) case of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco and the (more\noptimistic) case of the Galactic center. We find that for certain channels,\nincluding those with one or two monochromatic photon(s) and one or two neutral\npion(s), a detectable gamma-ray signal is possible for both targets under\nconsideration, and compatible with CMB constraints. For other annihilation\nchannels, however, including all leptonic annihilation channels and two charged\npions, CMB data rule out any significant signal of dark matter annihilation at\nfuture MeV gamma-ray telescopes from dwarf galaxies, but possibly not for the\nGalactic center.\n", "  We study solutions of the Klein-Gordon, Maxwell, and linearized Einstein\nequations in $\\mathbb{R}^{1,d+1}$ that transform as $d$-dimensional conformal\nprimaries under the Lorentz group $SO(1,d+1)$. Such solutions, called conformal\nprimary wavefunctions, are labeled by a conformal dimension $\\Delta$ and a\npoint in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, rather than an on-shell $(d+2)$-dimensional momentum.\nWe show that the continuum of scalar conformal primary wavefunctions on the\nprincipal continuous series $\\Delta\\in \\frac d2+ i\\mathbb{R}$ of $SO(1,d+1)$\nspans a complete set of normalizable solutions to the wave equation. In the\nmassless case, with or without spin, the transition from momentum space to\nconformal primary wavefunctions is implemented by a Mellin transform. As a\nconsequence of this construction, scattering amplitudes in this basis transform\ncovariantly under $SO(1,d+1)$ as $d$-dimensional conformal correlators.\n", "  We suggest a simple approach to calculate the local density of states that\neffectively applies to any structure created by an axially symmetric potential\non a continuous graphene sheet such as circular graphene quantum dots or rings.\nCalculations performed for the graphene quantum dot studied in a recent\nscanning tunneling microscopy measurement [{\\sl Gutierrez et al. Nat. Phys.\n\\textbf{12}, 1069--1075 (2016)}] show an excellent experimental-theoretical\nagreement.\n", "  What have become known as the \"Darmois\" and \"Lichnerowicz\" junction\nconditions are often stated to be equivalent, \"essentially\" equivalent, in a\n\"sense\" equivalent, and so on. One even sees not infrequent reference to the\n\"Darmois-Lichnerowicz\" conditions. Whereas the equivalence of these conditions\nis manifest in Gaussian-normal coordinates, a fact that has been known for\nclose to a century, this equivalence does not extend to a loose definition of\n\"admissible\" coordinates (coordinates in which the metric and its first order\nderivatives are continuous). We show this here by way of a simple, but\nphysically relevant, example. In general, a loose definition of the\n\"Lichnerowicz\" conditions gives additional restrictions, some of which simply\namount to a convenient choice of gauge, and some of which amount to real\nphysical restrictions, away from strict \"admissible\" coordinates. The situation\nwas totally confused by a very influential, and now frequently misquoted, paper\nby Bonnor and Vickers, that erroneously claimed a proof of the equivalence of\nthe \"Darmois\" and \"Lichnerowicz\" conditions within this loose definition of\n\"admissible\" coordinates. A correct proof, based on a strict definition of\n\"admissible\" coordinates, was given years previous by Israel. It is that proof,\ngenerally unrecognized, that we must refer to. Attention here is given to a\nclarification of the subject, and to the history of the subject, which, it\nturns out, is rather fascinating in itself.\n", "  Pyrochlore iridates A2Ir2O7 (A = rare earth elements, Y or Bi) hold great\npromise for realizing novel electronic and magnetic states owing to the\ninterplay of spin-orbit coupling, electron correlation and geometrical\nfrustration. A prominent example is the formation of all-in/all-out\n(AIAO)antiferromagnetic order in the Ir4+ sublattice that comprises of\ncorner-sharing tetrahedra. Here we report on an unusual magnetic phenomenon,\nnamely a cooling-field induced shift of magnetic hysteresis loop along\nmagnetization axis, and its possible origin in pyrochlore iridates with\nnon-magnetic Ir defects (e.g. Ir3+). In a simple model, we attribute the\nmagnetic hysteresis loop to the formation of ferromagnetic droplets in the AIAO\nantiferromagnetic background. The weak ferromagnetism originates from canted\nantiferromagnetic order of the Ir4+ moments surrounding each non-magnetic Ir\ndefect. The shift of hysteresis loop can be understood quantitatively based on\nan exchange-bias like effect in which the moments at the shell of the FM\ndroplets are pinned by the AIAO AFM background via mainly the Heisenberg (J)\nand Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (D) interactions. The magnetic pinning is stable and\nrobust against the sweeping cycle and sweeping field up to 35 T, which is\npossibly related to the magnetic octupolar nature of the AIAO order.\n", "  The democracy of quark flavors is a well-motivated flavor symmetry, but it\nmust be properly broken in order to explain the observed quark mass spectrum\nand flavor mixing pattern. We reconstruct the texture of flavor democracy\nbreaking and evaluate its strength in a novel way, by assuming a parallelism\nbetween the Q=+2/3 and Q=-1/3 quark sectors and using a nontrivial\nparametrization of the flavor mixing matrix. Some phenomenological implications\nof such democratic quark mass matrices, including their variations in the\nhierarchy basis and their evolution from the electroweak scale to a\nsuperhigh-energy scale, are also discussed.\n", "  We extend the $D4$-$D8$ holographic construction to include three chiral and\none heavy flavor, to describe heavy-light baryons with strangeness and their\nexotics. At strong coupling, the heavy meson always binds to the bulk instanton\nin the form of a flavor zero mode in the fundamental representation. We\nquantize the ensuing bound states using the collective quantization method, to\nobtain the spectra of heavy and strange baryons with both explicit and hidden\ncharm and bottom. Our results confirm the existence of two low-lying charmed\npenta-quark states with $\\frac 12^-,\\frac 32^-$ assignments, and predict many\nnew ones with both charm and bottom. They also suggest a quartet of low-lying\nneutral $\\Omega_c^0$ with assignments $\\frac 12^\\pm ,\\frac 32^\\pm$ that are\nheavier than the quintuplet of neutral $\\Omega_c^0$ recently reported by LHCb.\n", "  Sub-horizon perturbations under the extreme initial condition of the axion\nmodel are investigated, where initial axion angles start near the potential\nmaximum. This work focuses on a few new features found in the extreme axion\nmodel but absent in the free-particle model. A particularly novel new feature\nis the spectral excess relative to the CDM model in some wave number range,\nwhere the excess may be so large that landscapes of high-redshift universe\nbeyond $z=10$ can be significantly altered. For axions of particle mass\n$10^{-22}$ eV, this range of wave number corresponds to first galaxies of few\ntimes $10^9-10^{10} M_\\odot$. We demonstrate that sub-horizon perturbations are\naccurately described by Mathieu's equation and subject to parametric\ninstability, which explains this novel feature. Actually the axion model is not\na special one; perturbations in a wide range of scalar field models can share\nthe similar characteristic.\n", "  We present the first measurement of the surface magnetic field of a late-M\ndwarf, LSR J1835+3259, with the help of the full-Stokes spectropolarimetry in\nthe bands of diatomic molecules. Our magnetic field measurements at different\nrotational phases of the dwarf yielded one 5$\\sigma$ and two 3$\\sigma$\ndetections. The observational data have been obtained with the LRISp\npolarimeter at the Keck observatory on August 22nd and 23rd, 2012. These data\nhave been compared against synthetic full-Stokes spectra in the bands of the\nmolecules CrH, FeH and TiO, which have been calculated for a range of the\nstellar parameters and magnetic field strengths. Making use of\n$\\chi^2$-minimization and maximum likelihood estimation, we determine the net\nmagnetic field strength $B$ (and not flux $Bf$) of LSR J1835+3259 to $\\sim5$\nkG, mainly with the help of the Paschen-Back effect in the CrH lines. Our\nmeasurements at different rotational phases suggest that the dwarf's surface\nmight be covered with strong small-scale magnetic fields. In addition, recent\nfindings of the hydrogen emission and the Stokes V signal in the Na I\nnear-infrared doublet indicate that the dwarf's surface magnetic field might be\nchanging rapidly giving rise to flare activity, similar to young dMe dwarfs. We\nsubstantiate the substellar origin of LSR J1835+3259 by making use of our own\ndata as well as the photometric data from the all-sky surveys 2MASS and WISE.\n", "  We study the ultimate bounds on the estimation of temperature for an\ninteracting quantum system. We consider two coupled bosonic modes that are\nassumed to be thermal and using quantum estimation theory establish the role\nthe Hamiltonian parameters play in thermometry. We show that in the case of a\nconserved particle number the interaction between the modes leads to a decrease\nin the overall sensitivity to temperature, while interestingly, if particle\nexchange is allowed with the thermal bath the converse is true. We explain this\ndichotomy by examining the energy spectra. Finally, we devise experimentally\nimplementable thermometry schemes that rely only on locally accessible\ninformation from the total system, showing that almost Heisenberg limited\nprecision can still be achieved, and we address the (im)possibility for\nmultiparameter estimation in the system.\n", "  Using two approaches to strongly correlated systems, the extremely correlated\nFermi liquid theory and the dynamical mean field theory, we compute the\ntransverse transport coefficients, namely the Hall constants $R_H$ and Hall\nangles $\\theta_H$, and also the longitudinal and transverse optical response of\nthe $U=\\infty$ Hubbard model in the limit of infinite dimensions. We focus on\ntwo successive low-temperature regimes, the Gutzwiller correlated Fermi liquid\n(GCFL) and the Gutzwiller correlated strange metal (GCSM). We find that the\nHall angles $\\cot \\theta_H \\propto T^2$ in the GCFL regime, on warming into the\nstrange metal regime, it passes through a downward bend and continues as $T^2$.\nEquivalently, $R_H$ is weakly temperature dependent in the GCFL regime, and\nbecomes strongly $T$-dependent in the GCSM regime. Drude peaks are found for\nboth the longitudinal optical conductivity $\\sigma_{xx}(\\omega)$ and the\noptical Hall angles $\\tan \\theta_H(\\omega)$ below certain characteristic energy\nscales. By comparing the relaxation rates extracted from fitting to the Drude\nformula, we find that in the GCFL regime there is a single relaxation rate\ncontrolling both longitudinal and transverse transport, while in the GCSM\nregime two independent relaxation rates emerge. We trace the origin of this\nbehavior to the dynamical particle-hole asymmetry of the Dyson self-energy,\narguably a generic feature of doped Mott insulators.\n", "  The $\\mu$-$\\tau$ reflection symmetry\n$(\\nu_{e},\\thinspace\\nu_{\\mu},\\thinspace\\nu_{\\tau})\\rightarrow(\\overline{\\nu}_{e},\\thinspace\\overline{\\nu}_{\\tau},\\thinspace\\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu})$\nand the TM1 mixing (a PMNS matrix with the first column fixed to the TBM form)\nare both well compatible with experiments. If both approaches are\nsimultaneously assumed, all lepton mixing parameters except for $\\theta_{13}$\nare predicted. In particular, one expects maximal CP violation\n($|\\delta|=90^{\\circ}$), maximal atmospheric mixing ($\\theta_{23}=45^{\\circ}$),\na slightly less-than-TBM solar mixing angle ($\\theta_{12}\\approx34^{\\circ}$),\nas well as values of $0$ or $\\pi$ for the two Majorana phases. We study the\nrenormalization stability of this highly predictive framework when neutrino\nmass is described by an effective Weinberg operator and by the type I seesaw\nmechanism, both in the Standard Model and with supersymmetry.\n", "  We study the spectral properties of the cosmic-ray spectrum in the\ninterstellar medium within 1 kpc distance from the Sun. We used eight-year\nexposure data of molecular clouds of the Gould Belt obtained with the Fermi/LAT\ntelescope to precisely measure the cosmic-ray spectrum at different locations\nin the local Galaxy. We compared this measurement with the direct measurements\nof the cosmic-ray flux in and around the solar system obtained by Voyager and\nAMS-02 or PAMELA. We find that the average cosmic-ray spectrum in the local\nGalaxy in the 1-100 GeV range is well described by a broken power-law in\nrigidity with a low-energy slope of $2.33^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ and a break at\n$18^{+7}_{-4}$ GV, with a slope change by $0.59\\pm 0.11$. This result is\nconsistent with an earlier analysis of the gamma-ray signal from the Gould Belt\nclouds based on a shorter exposure of Fermi/LAT and with a different event\nselection. The break at 10-20 GV is also consistent with the combined Voyager +\nAMS-02 measurements in/around the solar system. The slope of the spectrum below\nthe break agrees with the slope of the average cosmic-ray spectrum in the inner\npart of the disk of the Milky Way that was previously derived from the\nFermi/LAT gamma-ray data. We conjecture that it is this slope of 2.33 and not\nthe locally measured softer slope of 2.7-2.8 that is determined by the balance\nbetween a steady-state injection of cosmic rays with a power-law slope of 2-2.1\nthat is due to Fermi acceleration and the energy-dependent propagation of\ncosmic-ray particles through the turbulent interstellar magnetic field with a\nKolmogorov turbulence spectrum. The approximation of a continuous-in-time\ninjection of cosmic rays at a constant rate breaks down, which causes the\nsoftening of the spectrum at higher energies.\n", "  Earthquakes at seismogenic plate boundaries are a response to the\ndifferential motions of tectonic blocks embedded within a geometrically complex\nnetwork of branching and coalescing faults. Elastic strain is accumulated at a\nslow strain rate of the order of $10^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$, and released\nintermittently at intervals $>100$ years, in the form of rapid (seconds to\nminutes) coseismic ruptures. The development of macroscopic models of\nquasi-static planar tectonic dynamics at these plate boundaries has remained\nchallenging due to uncertainty with regard to the spatial and kinematic\ncomplexity of fault system behaviors. In particular, the characteristic length\nscale of kinematically distinct tectonic structures is poorly constrained. Here\nwe analyze fluctuations in GPS recordings of interseismic velocities from the\nsouthern California plate boundary, identifying heavy-tailed scaling behavior.\nThis suggests that the plate boundary can be understood as a densely packed\ngranular medium near the jamming transition, with a characteristic length scale\nof $91 \\pm 20$ km. In this picture fault and block systems may rapidly\nrearrange the distribution of forces within them, driving a mixture of\ntransient and intermittent fault slip behaviors over tectonic time scales.\n", "  Recently it has been predicted that the Andreev bound state spectrum of\n4-terminal Josephson junctions may possess zero-energy Weyl singularities.\nUsing one superconducting phase as a control parameter, these singularities are\nassociated with topological transitions between time-reversal symmetry broken\nphases with different Chern numbers. Here we show that such topological\ntransitions may also be tuned with a magnetic flux through the junction area in\na 3-terminal geometry.\n", "  Using the Landau Ginzburg Devonshire theory and scalar approximation, we\nderived analytical expressions for the singular points (zeros, complex ranges)\nof the acoustic phonon mode (A mode) frequency in dependence on the wave vector\nk and examined the conditions of the soft A modes appearance in a ferroelectric\ndepending on the magnitude of the flexoelectric coefficient f and temperature\nT. We predict that if the magnitude of the flexocoefficient f is equal to the\ntemperature-dependent critical value fcr(T) at the temperature T=T_IC, the A\nmode frequency tends to zero at k=kr_0 and the spontaneous polarization becomes\nspatially modulated in a temperature range T<T_IC.The comparison of calculated\nphysical properties with measured ones are performed for some ferroelectrics\nwith SMP phases.In particular, temperature dependence of the calculated direct\nand inverse static dielectric susceptibility is in an agreement with\nexperimental data in Sn2P2(SexS1-x)6 that gives us additional background to\npredict flexo-coupling induced soft acoustic amplitudon-type mode in the SMP\nphase.The available experimental data on neutron scattering in organic\nincommensurate ferroelectric (CH3)3NCH2COO*CaCl2*2H2O are in a\nsemi-quantitative agreement with our theoretical results. To quantify the\ntheory, it is necessary to measure the frequency dependence of the A mode in a\nuniaxial ferroelectric with a spatially modulated phase in the temperature\ninterval near its occurrence.\n", "  A method for performing a precision measurement of the Rydberg constant,\n$R_{\\infty}$, using cold circular Rydberg atoms is proposed. These states have\nlong lifetimes, as well as negligible quantum-electrodynamics (QED) and no\nnuclear-overlap corrections. Due to these advantages, the measurement can help\nsolve the \"proton radius puzzle\" [Bernauer, Pohl, Sci. Am. 310, 32 (2014)]. The\natoms are trapped using a Rydberg-atom optical lattice, and transitions are\ndriven using a recently-demonstrated lattice-modulation technique to perform\nDoppler-free spectroscopy. The circular-state transition frequency yields\n$R_{\\infty}$. Laser wavelengths and beam geometries are selected such that the\nlattice-induced transition shift is minimized. The selected transitions have no\nfirst-order Zeeman and Stark corrections, leaving only manageable second-order\nZeeman and Stark shifts. For Rb, the projected relative uncertainty of\n$R_{\\infty}$ in a measurement under the presence of the Earth's gravity is\n$10^{-11}$, with the main contribution coming from the residual lattice shift.\nThis could be reduced in a future micro-gravity implementation. The\nnext-important systematic arises from the Rb$^+$ polarizability\n(relative-uncertainty contribution of $\\approx 3 \\times10^{-12}$).\n", "  It is well known that particles can get trapped by randomly placed obstacles\nwhen they are pushed too much. We present a model where the current in a\ndisordered medium dies at a large external field, but is reborn when the\nactivity is increased. By activity we mean the time-variation of the external\ndriving at a constant time-averaged field. A different interpretation of the\nresurgence of the current is that the particles are capable of taking an\ninfinite sequence of potential barriers via a mechanism similar to stochastic\nresonance. We add a discussion regarding the role of \"shaking\" in processes of\nrelaxation.\n", "  We demonstrate the application of a fiber-coupled quantum-dot-in-a-tip as a\nprobe for scanning electric field microscopy. We map the out-of-plane component\nof the electric field induced by a pair of electrodes by measurement of the\nquantum-confined Stark effect induced on a quantum dot spectral line. Our\nresults are in agreement with finite element simulations of the experiment.\nFurthermore, we present results from analytic calculations and simulations\nwhich are relevant to any electric field sensor embedded in a dielectric tip.\nIn particular, we highlight the impact of the tip geometry on both the\nresolution and sensitivity.\n", "  We introduce a new cosmic emulator for the matter power spectrum covering\neight cosmological parameters. Targeted at optical surveys, the emulator\nprovides accurate predictions out to a wavenumber k~5/Mpc and redshift z<=2.\nBesides covering the standard set of LCDM parameters, massive neutrinos and a\ndynamical dark energy of state are included. The emulator is built on a sample\nset of 36 cosmological models, carefully chosen to provide accurate predictions\nover the wide and large parameter space. For each model, we have performed a\nhigh-resolution simulation, augmented with sixteen medium-resolution\nsimulations and TimeRG perturbation theory results to provide accurate coverage\nof a wide k-range; the dataset generated as part of this project is more than\n1.2Pbyte. With the current set of simulated models, we achieve an accuracy of\napproximately 4%. Because the sampling approach used here has established\nconvergence and error-control properties, follow-on results with more than a\nhundred cosmological models will soon achieve ~1% accuracy. We compare our\napproach with other prediction schemes that are based on halo model ideas and\nremapping approaches. The new emulator code is publicly available.\n", "  We discuss possible implications of Exotic Stringy instantons for\nBaryon-violating signatures in future colliders. In particular, we discuss\nhigh-energy quarks collisions and $\\Lambda-\\bar{\\Lambda}$ transitions. In\nprinciple, $\\Lambda-\\bar{\\Lambda}$ process can be probed by high-luminosity\nelectron-positron colliders. However, we find that an extremely high luminosity\nis needed in order to provide a (somewhat) stringent bound compared to the\ncurrent data on $NN\\rightarrow \\pi\\pi,KK$. On the other hand, (exotic)\ninstanton-induced six quark interactions can be tested in near future\nhigh-energy colliders beyond LHC, at energies around $20-100\\, \\rm TeV$. Super\nproton-proton collider (SppC) is capable of such measurement given the proposed\nenergy level of 50-90 TeV. Comparison with other channels is made. In\nparticular, we show the compatibility of our model with neutron-antineutron and\n$NN\\rightarrow \\pi\\pi,KK$ bounds.\n", "  A quantum theory of multiphase estimation is crucial for quantum-enhanced\nsensing and imaging and may link quantum metrology to more complex quantum\ncomputation and communication protocols. In this letter we tackle one of the\nkey difficulties of multiphase estimation: obtaining a measurement which\nsaturates the fundamental sensitivity bounds. We derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for projective measurements acting on pure states to\nsaturate the maximal theoretical bound on precision given by the quantum Fisher\ninformation matrix. We apply our theory to the specific example of\ninterferometric phase estimation using photon number measurements, a convenient\nchoice in the laboratory. Our results thus introduce concepts and methods\nrelevant to the future theoretical and experimental development of\nmultiparameter estimation.\n", "  Planetesimals may form from the gravitational collapse of dense particle\nclumps initiated by the streaming instability. We use simulations of\naerodynamically coupled gas-particle mixtures to investigate whether the\nproperties of planetesimals formed in this way depend upon the sizes of the\nparticles that participate in the instability. Based on three high resolution\nsimulations that span a range of dimensionless stopping time $6 \\times 10^{-3}\n\\leq \\tau \\leq 2$ no statistically significant differences in the initial\nplanetesimal mass function are found. The mass functions are fit by a\npower-law, ${\\rm d}N / {\\rm d}M_p \\propto M_p^{-p}$, with $p=1.5-1.7$ and\nerrors of $\\Delta p \\approx 0.1$. Comparing the particle density fields prior\nto collapse, we find that the high wavenumber power spectra are similarly\nindistinguishable, though the large-scale geometry of structures induced via\nthe streaming instability is significantly different between all three cases.\nWe interpret the results as evidence for a near-universal slope to the mass\nfunction, arising from the small-scale structure of streaming-induced\nturbulence.\n", "  Chiral anomaly of Weyl magnons (WMs), featured by nontrivial band crossings\nat paired Weyl nodes (WNs) of opposite chirality, is investigated. It is shown\nthat WMs can be realized in stacked honeycomb ferromagnets. Using the\nAharonov-Casher effect that is about the interaction between magnetic moments\nand electric fields, the magnon motion in honeycomb layers can be quantized\ninto magnonic Landau levels (MLLs). The zeroth MLL is chiral so that\nunidirectional WMs propagate in the perpendicular (to the layer) direction for\na given WN under a magnetic field gradient from one WN to the other and change\ntheir chiralities, resulting in the magnonic chiral anomaly (MCA). A net magnon\ncurrent carrying spin and heat through the zeroth MLL depends linearly on the\nmagnetic field gradient and the electric field gradient in the ballistic\ntransport.\n", "  A new management system for the SND detector experiments (at VEPP-2000\ncollider in Novosibirsk) is developed. We describe here the interaction between\na user and the SND databases. These databases contain experiment configuration,\nconditions and metadata. The new system is designed in client-server\narchitecture. It has several logical layers corresponding to the users roles. A\nnew template engine is created. A web application is implemented using Node.js\nframework. At the time the application provides: showing and editing\nconfiguration; showing experiment metadata and experiment conditions data\nindex; showing SND log (prototype).\n", "  By analyzing the probability distributions of the Loschmidt echo (LE) and\nquantum work, we examine the nonequilibrium effects of a quantum many-body\nsystem, which exhibits an excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT).\n  We find that depending on the value of the controlling parameter the\ndistribution of the LE displays different patterns.\n  At the critical point of the ESQPT, both the averaged LE and the averaged\nwork show a cusplike shape.\n  Furthermore, by employing the finite-size scaling analysis of the averaged\nwork, we obtain the critical exponent of the ESQPT.\n  Finally, we show that at the critical point of ESQPT the eigenstate is a\nhighly localized state, further highlighting the influence of the ESQPT on the\nproperties of the many-body system.\n", "  Passive filters allowing the exchange of particles in a narrow band of energy\nare currently used in micro-refrigerators and energy transducers. In this\nletter, we analyze their thermal properties using linear irreversible\nthermodynamics and kinetic theory, and discuss a striking phenomenon: the\npossibility of increasing or decreasing simultaneously the temperatures of two\nsystems without any supply of energy. This occurs when the filter induces a\nflow of particles whose energy is between the average energies of the two\nsystems. Here we show that this selective transfer of particles does not need\nthe action of any sort of Maxwell demon and can be carried out by passive\nfilters without compromising the second law of thermodynamics. The phenomenon\nallows us to design cycles between two reservoirs at temperatures $T_1<T_2$\nthat are able to reach temperatures below $T_1$ or above $T_2$.\n", "  We consider core-shell nanowires with conductive shell and insulating core,\nand with polygonal cross section. We investigate the implications of this\ngeometry on Majorana states expected in the presence of proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity and an external magnetic field. A typical prismatic nanowire\nhas a hexagonal profile, but square and triangular shapes can also be obtained.\nThe low-energy states are localized at the corners of the cross section, i.e.\nalong the prism edges, and are separated by a gap from higher energy states\nlocalized on the sides. The corner localization depends on the details of the\nshell geometry, i.e. thickness, diameter, and sharpness of the corners. We\nstudy systematically the low-energy spectrum of prismatic shells using\nnumerical methods and derive the topological phase diagram as a function of\nmagnetic field and chemical potential for triangular, square, and hexagonal\ngeometries. A strong corner localization enhances the stability of Majorana\nmodes to various perturbations, including the orbital effect of the magnetic\nfield, whereas a weaker localization favorizes orbital effects and reduces the\ncritical magnetic field. The prismatic geometry allows the Majorana zero-energy\nmodes to be accompanied by low-energy states, which we call pseudo Majorana,\nand which converge to real Majoranas in the limit of small shell thickness. We\ninclude the Rashba spin-orbit coupling in a phenomenological manner, assuming a\nradial electric field across the shell.\n", "  We consider a dark electroweak phase transition, during which a baryon\nasymmetry in the dark neutrons and an equal lepton asymmetry in the dark Dirac\nneutrinos can be simultaneously induced by the CP-violating reflection of the\ndark fermions off the expanding dark Higgs bubbles. The Yukawa couplings for\ngenerating the ordinary Majorana neutrino masses can partially convert the dark\nlepton asymmetry to an ordinary baryon asymmetry in association with the\nordinary sphaleron processes. The dark neutron can have a determined mass to\nserve as a dark matter particle. By further imposing a proper mirror symmetry,\nthe Majorana neutrino mass matrix can have a form of linear seesaw while its\nDirac CP phase can provide a unique source for the required CP violation.\n", "  The Weibel instability from counterstreaming plasma flows is a basic process\nhighly relevant for collisionless shock formation in astrophysics. In this\nLetter we investigate, via two- and three- dimensional simulations, suitable\nconfigurations for laboratory investigations of the ion Weibel instability\n(IWI) driven by a fast quasi-neutral plasma flow launched into the target via\nthe radiation pressure of an ultra-high-intensity (UHI) laser pulse\n('Hole-Boring' process). The use of S-polarized light at oblique incidence is\nfound to be an optimal configuration for driving IWI, as it prevents the\ndevelopment of surface rippling observed at normal incidence, that would lead\nto strong electron heating and favors competing instabilities. Conditions for\nthe evolution of IWI into a collisionless shock are also investigated.\n", "  If the standard model Higgs boson were much heavier, it would appear as a\nbroad resonance since its decay into a pair of longitudinally polarized gauge\nbosons is highly enhanced. We study whether the same enhancement happens at\nloop level in a simple extension of the standard model with a singlet scalar\nboson $S$. In order to focus on the loop effects, we assume that $S$ does not\ninteract with the standard model particles at tree level. The singlet scalar\n$S$ is linked to the standard model world by vector-like quarks running in the\nloop. We introduce three vector-like quark multiplets, an $SU(2)_L$ doublet, an\nup-type singlet, and a down-type singlet. There are two kinds of loop effects\nin the $S$ phenomenology, the mixing with the Higgs boson and the radiative\ndecays into $hh$, $WW$, $ZZ$, $gg$, and $\\gamma\\gamma$ through the triangle\nloops. We show that the crucial condition for enhancing loop effects including\nthe longitudinal polarization enhancement is the large mass differences among\nvector-like quarks. The current LHC constraints on $S$ from the heavy scalar\nsearches and the Higgs precision data are shown to be very significant: the\nmixing angle with the Higgs boson should be smaller than about 0.1 for $m_S=\n750$ GeV.\n", "  We present the formalism for consistently transforming transition operators\nwithin the in-medium similarity renormalization group framework. We implement\nthe operator transformation in both the equations-of-motion and valence-space\nvariants, and present first results for electromagnetic transitions and moments\nin medium-mass nuclei using consistently-evolved operators, including the\ninduced two-body parts. These results are compared to experimental values,\nand--where possible--the results of no-core shell model calculations using the\nsame input chiral interaction. We find good agreement between the\nequations-of-motion and valence space approaches. Magnetic dipole observables\nare generally in reasonable agreement with experiment, while the more\ncollective electric quadrupole and octupole observables are significantly\nunderpredicted, often by over an order of magnitude, indicating missing physics\nat the present level of truncation.\n", "  We perform the first global QCD analysis of polarized inclusive and\nsemi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering and single-inclusive $e^+e^-$\nannihilation data, fitting simultaneously the parton distribution and\nfragmentation functions using the iterative Monte Carlo method. Without\nimposing SU(3) symmetry relations, we find the strange polarization to be very\nsmall, consistent with zero for both inclusive and semi-inclusive data, which\nprovides a resolution to the strange quark polarization puzzle. The combined\nanalysis also allows the direct extraction from data of the isovector and octet\naxial charges, and is consistent with a small SU(2) flavor asymmetry of the\npolarized sea.\n", "  As a future charge management light source, UV light-emitting diodes (UV\nLEDs) offer far superior performance in a range of metrics compared to the\nmercury lamps used in the past. As part of a qualification program a number of\nshort wavelength UV LEDs have been subjected to a series of lifetime tests for\npotential use on the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. These\ntests were performed at realistic output levels for both fast and continuous\ndischarging in either a DC or pulsed mode of operation and included a DC fast\ndischarge test spanning 50 days, a temperature dependent pulsed fast discharge\ntest spanning 21 days and a pulsed continuous discharge test spanning 507 days.\nTwo types of UV LED have demonstrated lifetimes equivalent to over 25 years of\nrealistic mission usage and provide a baseline and backup solution for LISA.\n", "  The interpretation of stellar apparent fundamental parameters must be treated\nconsistently with the characteristics of their surface rotation law. We develop\na model to determine the distribution of the effective temperature and gravity,\nwhich depend on the surface differential rotation law and on the stellar\nexternal geometry. The basic assumptions are: a) the atmosphric layers are in\nradiative equilibrium; b) the bolometric flux is anti-parallel with the\neffective gravity; c) the angular velocity in the surface is\nOmega=Omega(theta,alpha,k)] where (alpha,k) are free parameters. The effective\ntemperature varies with co-latitude `theta' and on the differential-rotation\nlaw through the effective gravity and the gravity-darkening function (GDF).\nAlthough the derived expressions can be treated numerically, for some low\ninteger values of k, analytical forms of the `integral ofcharacteristic\ncurves', on which the determination of the GDF relies, are obtained. The\neffects of the quantities (eta,alpha,k) (eta=ratio between centrifugal and\ngravitational accelerations at the equator) on the determination of the Vsini\nparameter and on the `gravity-darkening exponent' are studied. Depending on the\nvalues of (eta,alpha,k) the velocity V in the derived Vsini may strongly\ndeviate from the equatorial rotational velocity. It is shown that the von\nZeipel's-like gravity-darkening exponent $\\beta_1$ depends on all parameters\n$(\\eta,\\alpha,k)$ and that its value also depends on the viewing-angle i.\nHence, there no unique interpretation of this exponent determined empirically\nin terms of (i,alpha). The data on rotating stars should be analyzed by taking\ninto account the rotational effects through the GDF, by assuming k=2 as a first\napproximation. Instead of the classical pair (eta,beta1), it would be more\nuseful to determine the quantities (eta,alpha,i) to characterize stellar\nrotation.\n", "  SHiP (Search for Hidden Particles) is a beam dump experiment proposed at the\nCERN SPS aiming at the observation of long lived particles very weakly coupled\nwith ordinary matter mostly produced in the decay of charmed hadrons. The beam\ndump facility of SHiP is also a copious factory of neutrinos of all three kinds\nand therefore a dedicated neutrino detector is foreseen in the SHiP apparatus.\nThe neutrino detector exploits the Emulsion Cloud Chamber technique with a\nmodular structure, alternating walls of target units and planes of electronic\ndetectors providing the time stamp to the event. GEM detectors are one of the\npossible choices for this task. This paper reports the results of the first\nexposure to a muon beam at CERN of a new hybrid chamber, obtained by coupling a\nGEM chamber and an emulsion detector. Thanks to the micrometric accuracy of the\nemulsion detector, the position resolution of the GEM chamber as a function of\nthe particle inclination was evaluated in two configurations, with and without\nthe magnetic field\n", "  The theory of Gaussian quantum fluctuations around classical steady states in\nnonlinear quantum-optical systems (also known as standard linearization) is a\ncornerstone for the analysis of such systems. Its simplicity, together with its\naccuracy far from critical points or situations where the nonlinearity reaches\nthe strong coupling regime, has turned it into a widespread technique, which is\nthe first method of choice in most works on the subject. However, such a\ntechnique finds strong practical and conceptual complications when one tries to\napply it to situations in which the classical long-time solution is time\ndependent, a most prominent example being spontaneous limit-cycle formation.\nHere we introduce a linearization scheme adapted to such situations, using the\ndriven Van der Pol oscillator as a testbed for the method, which allows us to\ncompare it with full numerical simulations. On a conceptual level, the scheme\nrelies on the connection between the emergence of limit cycles and the\nspontaneous breaking of the symmetry under temporal translations. On the\npractical side, the method keeps the simplicity and linear scaling with the\nsize of the problem (number of modes) characteristic of standard linearization,\nmaking it applicable to large (many-body) systems.\n", "  We have reprocessed over 100 terabytes of single-exposure WISE/NEOWISE images\nto create the deepest ever full-sky maps at 3-5 microns. We incorporate all\npublicly available W1 and W2 imaging - a total of ~8 million exposures in each\nband - from ~37 months of observations spanning 2010 January to 2015 December.\nOur coadds preserve the native WISE resolution and feature depth of coverage ~3\ntimes greater than that of the AllWISE Atlas stacks. Our coadds are designed to\nenable deep forced photometry, in particular for the Dark Energy Camera Legacy\nSurvey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-Band Legacy Survey (MzLS), both of which are being\nused to select targets for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We\ndescribe newly introduced processing steps aimed at leveraging added redundancy\nto remove artifacts, with the intent of facilitating uniform target selection\nand searches for rare/exotic objects (e.g. high-redshift quasars and distant\ngalaxy clusters). Forced photometry depths achieved with these coadds extend\n0.56 (0.46) magnitudes deeper in W1 (W2) than is possible with only\npre-hibernation WISE imaging.\n", "  We report on the cryogenic characterization of Red Green Blue - High Density\n(RGB-HD) SiPMs developed at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) as part of the\nDarkSide program of dark matter searches with liquid argon time projection\nchambers. A dedicated setup was used to measure the primary dark noise, the\ncorrelated noise, and the gain of the SiPMs at varying temperatures. A\ncustom-made data acquisition system and analysis software were used to\nprecisely characterize these parameters. We demonstrate that FBK RGB-HD SiPMs\nwith low quenching resistance (RGB-HD-LR$_q$) can be operated from 40 K to 300\nK with gains in the range $10^5$ to $10^6$ and noise rates on the order of a\nfew Hz/mm$^2$.\n", "  Flows of the couplings of a theory of an N-component (complex) scalar field\ncoupled to electrodynamics is investigated using the functional renormalization\ngroup formalism in d dimensions in covariant gauges. We find charged fixed\npoints for any number of components in d=3, in accordance with the findings of\n[G. Fejos and T. Hatsuda, Phys. Rev. D 93, 121701 (2016)] for N=1. It is argued\nthat the appropriate choice of the regulator matrix is indispensible to obtain\nsuch a result. Ward-Takahashi identites are analyzed in the presence of the\nregulator, and their compatibility with the flow equation is investigated in\ndetail.\n", "  Rare $\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda l^+l^-$ and $\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda\\gamma$ decays are\ninvestigated in the relativistic quark model based on the quark-diquark picture\nof baryons. The decay form factors are calculated with the account of all\nrelativistic effects including relativistic transformations of baryon wave\nfunctions from rest to moving reference frame and the contribution of the\nintermediate negative energy states. The momentum transfer squared dependence\nof the form factors is explicitly determined in the whole accessible\nkinematical range. The calculated decay branching fractions, various\nforward-backward asymmetries for the rare decay $\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$ are found to be consistent with recent detailed measurements by the\nLHCb Collaboration. Predictions for the $\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda \\tau^+\\tau^-$\ndecay observables are given.\n", "  We study the radiative decay, or fluorescence, of excitons in organic solar\ncells as a function of its geometrical parameters. Contrary to their\nnon-radiative counterpart, fluorescence losses strongly depend on the\nenvironment. By properly tuning the thicknesses of the buffer layers between\nthe active regions of the cell and the electrodes, the exciton lifetime and,\nhence, the exciton diffusion length can be increased. The importance of this\nphenomenon depends on the radiative quantum efficiency, which is the fraction\nof the exciton decay that is intrinsically due to fluorescence. Besides this\neffect, interferences within the cell control the efficiency of sunlight\ninjection into the active layers. An optimal cell design must rely on the\nconsideration of these two aspects. By properly managing fluorescence losses,\none can significantly improve the cell performance. To demonstrate this fact,\nwe use realistic material parameters inspired from literature data and obtain\nan increase of power conversion efficiency from 11.3% to 12.7%. Conversely, not\nto take into account the strong dependence of fluorescence on the environment\nmay lead to a sub-optimal cell design and a degradation of cell performance.\nThe presence of radiative losses, however small, significantly changes the\noptimal thicknesses. We illustrate this latter situation with experimental\nmaterial data.\n", "  Results are reported for the $f$-electron intermetallic CeAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$,\nwhere the atomic arrangement of the cerium ions creates the conditions for\ngeometric frustration. Despite this, magnetic susceptibility measurements\nreveal that the low temperature magnetic exchange interaction is weak,\nresulting in marginally frustrated behavior and ordering near $T_{\\rm{M}}$\n$\\approx$ 1.4 K. This occurs within a metallic Kondo lattice, where electrical\nresistivity and heat capacity measurements show that the Kondo-driven\nelectronic correlations are negligible. Quantum oscillations are detected in\nac-magnetic susceptibility measurements and uncover small charge carrier\neffective masses. Electronic structure calculations reveal that when the\nexperimentally observed antiferromagnetic exchange interaction and the\non-$f$-site Coulomb repulsion (Hubbard) U are considered, the $f$-electron\nbands move away from the Fermi level, resulting in electronic behavior that is\ndominated by the $s$-, $p$-, and $d$- bands, which are all characterized by\nlight electron masses. Thus, CeAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ provides a starting point for\ninvestigating geometric magnetic frustration in a cerium lattice without strong\nKondo hybridization, where calculations provide useful guidance.\n", "  In this article we present an automatic method for charge and mass\nidentification of charged nuclear fragments produced in heavy ion collisions at\nintermediate energies. The algorithm combines a generative model of DeltaE - E\nrelation and a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES). The\nCMA-ES is a stochastic and derivative-free method employed to search parameter\nspace of the model by means of a fitness function. The article describes\ndetails of the method along with results of an application on simulated labeled\ndata.\n", "  The magnetic field in intergalactic space gives important information about\nmagnetogenesis in the early universe. The properties of this field can be\nprobed by searching for radiation of secondary e$^+ $e$^-$ pairs created by TeV\nphotons, that produce GeV range radiation by Compton-scattering cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) photons. The arrival times of the GeV \"echo\" photons\ndepend strongly on the magnetic field strength and coherence length. A Monte\nCarlo code that accurately treats pair creation is developed to simulate the\nspectrum and time-dependence of the echo radiation. The extrapolation of the\nspectrum of powerful gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) like GRB 130427A to TeV energies\nis used to demonstrate how the IGMF can be constrained if it falls in the\n$10^{-21}$ - $10^{-17}$ G range for 1 Mpc coherence length.\n", "  Context. Local helioseismology has detected spatially extended converging\nsurface flows into solar active regions. These play an important role in\nflux-transport models of the solar dynamo.\n  Aims. We aim to validate the existence of the inflows by deriving horizontal\nflow velocities around active regions with local correlation tracking of\ngranulation.\n  Methods. We generate a six-year long-time series of full-disk maps of the\nhorizontal velocity at the solar surface by tracking granules in continuum\nintensity images provided by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).\n  Results. On average, active regions are surrounded by inflows extending up to\n10 deg from the center of the active region of magnitudes of 20-30 m/s,\nreaching locally up to 40 m/s, which is in agreement with results from local\nhelioseismology. By computing an ensemble average consisting of 243 individual\nactive regions, we show that the inflows are not azimuthally symmetric but\nconverge predominantly towards the trailing polarity of the active region with\nrespect to the longitudinally and temporally averaged flow field.\n", "  Primordial black holes (PBHs) have long been suggested as a candidate for\nmaking up some or all of the dark matter in the Universe. Most of the\ntheoretically possible mass range for PBH dark matter has been ruled out with\nvarious null observations of expected signatures of their interaction with\nstandard astrophysical objects. However, current constraints are significantly\nless robust in the 20 M_sun < M_PBH < 100 M_sun mass window, which has received\nmuch attention recently, following the detection of merging black holes with\nestimated masses of ~30 M_sun by LIGO and the suggestion that these could be\nblack holes formed in the early Universe. We consider the potential of advanced\nLIGO (aLIGO) operating at design sensitivity to probe this mass range by\nlooking for peaks in the mass spectrum of detected events. To quantify the\nbackground, which is due to black holes that are formed from dying stars, we\nmodel the shape of the stellar-black-hole mass function and calibrate its\namplitude to match the O1 results. Adopting very conservative assumptions about\nthe PBH and stellar-black-hole merger rates, we show that ~5 years of aLIGO\ndata can be used to detect a contribution of >20 M_sun PBHs to dark matter down\nto f_PBH<0.5 at >99.9% confidence level. Combined with other probes that\nalready suggest tension with f_PBH=1, the obtainable independent limits from\naLIGO will thus enable a firm test of the scenario that PBHs make up all of\ndark matter.\n", "  The decay path of the Hoyle state in $^{12}$C ($E_x=7.654\\textrm{MeV}$) has\nbeen studied with the\n$^{14}\\textrm{N}(\\textrm{d},\\alpha_2)^{12}\\textrm{C}(7.654)$ reaction induced\nat $10.5\\textrm{MeV}$. High resolution invariant mass spectroscopy techniques\nhave allowed to unambiguously disentangle direct and sequential decays of the\nstate passing through the ground state of $^{8}$Be. Thanks to the almost total\nabsence of background and the attained resolution, a fully sequential decay\ncontribution to the width of the state has been observed. The direct decay\nwidth is negligible, with an upper limit of $0.043\\%$ ($95\\%$ C.L.). The\nprecision of this result is about a factor $5$ higher than previous studies.\nThis has significant implications on nuclear structure, as it provides\nconstraints to $3$-$\\alpha$ cluster model calculations, where higher precision\nlimits are needed.\n", "  The basic theoretical foundation for the modelling of phonon assisted\nabsorption spectra in direct bandgap semiconductors, introduced by Elliott 60\nyears ago using second order perturbation theory, results in a square root\nshaped dependency close to the absorption edge. A careful analysis of the\nexperiments reveals that for the yellow S excitons in Cu$_2$O the lineshape\ndoes not follow that square root dependence. The reexamination of the theory\nshows that the basic assumptions of constant matrix elements and constant\nenergy denominators is invalid for semiconductors with dominant exciton effects\nlike Cu$_2$O, where the phonon assisted absorption proceeds via intermediate\nexciton states. The overlap between these and the final exciton states strongly\ndetermines the dependence of the absorption on the photon energy. To describe\nthe experimental observed line shape of the indirect absorption of the yellow S\nexciton states we find it necessary to assume a momentum dependent deformation\npotential for the optical phonons.\n", "  A photodetector may be characterized by various figures of merit such as\nresponse time, bandwidth, dark count rate, efficiency, wavelength resolution,\nand photon-number resolution. On the other hand, quantum theory says that any\nmeasurement device is fully described by its POVM, which stands for\nPositive-Operator-Valued Measure, and which generalizes the textbook notion of\nthe eigenstates of the appropriate hermitian operator (the \"observable\") as\nmeasurement outcomes. Here we show how to define a multitude of photodetector\nfigures of merit in terms of a given POVM. We distinguish classical and quantum\nfigures of merit and issue a conjecture regarding trade-off relations between\nthem. We discuss the relationship between POVM elements and photodetector\nclicks, and how models of photodetectors may be tested by measuring either POVM\nelements or figures of merit. Finally, the POVM is advertised as a\nplatform-independent way of comparing different types of photodetectors, since\nany such POVM refers to the Hilbert space of the incoming light, and not to any\nHilbert space internal to the detector.\n", "  Although observational data unequivocally point out to the presence of\nchromospheres in red giant stars, no attempts have been made so far to model\nthem using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres. We therefore compute an\nexploratory 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere for a cool red giant in order to\nstudy the dynamical and thermodynamic properties of its chromosphere, as well\nas the influence of the chromosphere on its observable properties. 3D radiation\nhydrodynamics simulations are carried out with the CO5BOLD model atmosphere\ncode for a star with the atmospheric parameters (Teff=4010 K, log g=1.5,\n[M/H]=0.0), which are similar to those of the K-type giant star Aldebaran\n(alpha Tau). ... we compute the emergent continuum intensity maps at different\nwavelengths, spectral line profiles of Ca II K, the Ca II infrared triplet line\nat 854.2nm, and H alpha, as well as the spectral energy distribution (SED) of\nthe emergent radiative flux. The initial model quickly develops a dynamical\nchromosphere characterised by propagating and interacting shock waves. The peak\ntemperatures in the chromospheric shock fronts reach values on the order of up\nto 5000 K although the shock fronts remain quite narrow. Like for the Sun, the\ngas temperature distribution in the upper layers is composed of a cool\ncomponent due to adiabatic cooling in the expanding post-shock regions and a\nhot component due to shock waves. For this red giant model, the hot component\nis a rather flat high-temperature tail, which nevertheless affects the\nresulting average temperatures significantly. The simulations show that the\natmospheres of red giant stars are dynamic and intermittent. Consequently, many\nobservable properties cannot be reproduced with one-dimensional static models\nbut demand for advanced 3D HD modelling. Furthermore, including a chromosphere\nin the models might produce significant contributions to the emergent UV flux.\n", "  We report the timing analysis results of X-ray pulsars from a recent deep\nChandra survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We have analyzed a total\nexposure of 1.4 Ms from 31 observations over a 1.2 deg$^2$ region in the SMC\nunder a Chandra X-ray Visionary Program. Using the Lomb-Scargle and epoch\nfolding techniques, we have detected periodic modulations from 20 pulsars and a\nnew candidate pulsar. The survey also covers 11 other pulsars with no clear\nsign of periodic modulation. The 0.5-8 keV X-ray luminosity ($L_X$) of the\npulsars ranges from $10^{34}$ to $10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 60 kpc. All the\nChandra sources with $L_X$ $\\gtrsim 4 \\times 10^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ exhibit\nX-ray pulsations. The X-ray spectra of the SMC pulsars (and high mass X-ray\nbinaries) are in general harder than those of the SMC field population. All but\nSXP~8.02 can be fitted by an absorbed power-law model with a photon index of\n$\\Gamma$ $\\lesssim$ 1.5. The X-ray spectrum of the known magnetar SXP~8.02 is\nbetter fitted with a two-temperature blackbody model. Newly measured pulsation\nperiods of SXP~51.0, SXP~214 and SXP~701 are significantly different from the\nprevious XMM-Newton and RXTE measurements. This survey provides a rich data set\nfor energy-dependent pulse profile modeling. Six pulsars show an almost\neclipse-like dip in the pulse profile. Phase-resolved spectral analysis reveals\ndiverse spectral variation during pulsation cycle: e.g., for an absorbed\npower-law model, some exhibit an (anti)-correlation between absorption and\nX-ray flux, while others show more intrinsic spectral variation.\n", "  We investigate the stability of stars with a density discontinuity between a\nhigh-density core and a very low density mantle. Previous work on \"strange\ndwarfs\" suggested that such a discontinuity could stabilize stars that would\nhave been classified as unstable by the conventional criteria based on extrema\nin the mass-radius relation. We investigate the stability of such stars by\nnumerically solving the Sturm-Liouville equations for the lowest-energy modes\nof the star. We find that the conventional criteria are correct, and strange\ndwarfs are not stable.\n", "  We investigate the large-scale structure of amorphous ices and transitions\nbetween their different forms by quantifying their large-scale density\nfluctuations. Specifically, we simulate the isothermal compression of\nlow-density amorphous ice (LDA) and hexagonal ice (Ih) to produce high-density\namorphous ice (HDA). Remarkably, both HDA and LDA are nearly hyperuniform,\nmeaning that they are characterized by an anomalous suppression of large-scale\ndensity fluctuations. By contrast, in correspondence with both non-equilibrium\nphase transitions to HDA, the presence of structural heterogeneities strongly\nsuppresses the hyperuniformity and, remarkably, the system becomes\nhyposurficial (devoid of \"surface-area\" fluctuations). Our investigation\nchallenges the largely accepted \"frozen-liquid\" picture, which views glasses as\nstructurally arrested liquids. Beyond implications for water, our findings\nenrich our understanding of the structural transformations that occur in\nglasses with varying pressures.\n", "  A pictorial explanation for shear-Hall instability is suggested and shows\nthat the shear flow is not necessary for the instability because its role can\nbe played by the Hall effect of an inhomogeneous background magnetic field.\nLinear stability analysis for a simple model of magnetic field varying\nperiodically in space confirms such a 'double Hall' instability. Numerical\ncomputations show a considerable increase in Ohmic dissipation rate at the\nnonlinear stage of instability development. Field dissipation has a spiky\ncharacter associated with magnetic reconnection in current sheets and X-points.\nDouble Hall instability can be significant for magnetic field dissipation in\nneutron star crusts and, possibly, in the solar corona.\n", "  This work is the reconstruction of the interaction rate of holographic dark\nenergy whose infrared cut-off scale is set by the Hubble length. We have\nreconstructed the interaction rate between dark matter and the holographic dark\nenergy for a specific parameterization of the effective equation of state\nparameter. We have obtained observational constraints on the model parameters\nusing the latest Type Ia Supernova (SNIa), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)\nand Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation datasets. We have found that\nfor the present model, the interaction rate increases with expansion and\nremains positive throughout the evolution. For a comprehensive analysis, we\nhave also compared the reconstructed results of the interaction rate with other\nwell-known holographic dark energy models. The nature of the deceleration\nparameter, the statefinder parameters and the dark energy equation of state\nparameter have also been studied for the present model. It has been found that\nthe deceleration parameter favors the past decelerated and recent accelerated\nexpansion phase of the universe. It has also been found that the dark energy\nequation of state parameter shows a phantom nature at the present epoch.\n", "  We report on a picosecond-fast optical removal of spin polarization from a\nself-confined photo-carrier system at an undoped GaAs/AlGaAs interface\npossessing superior long-range and high-speed spin transport properties. We\nemployed a modified resonant spin amplification technique with unequal\nintensities of subsequent pump pulses to experimentally distinguish the\nevolution of spin populations originating from different excitation laser\npulses. We demonstrate that the density of spins, which is injected into the\nsystem by means of the optical orientation, can be controlled by reducing the\nelectrostatic confinement of the system using an additional generation of\nphotocarriers. It is also shown that the disturbed confinement recovers within\nhundreds of picoseconds after which spins can be again photo-injected into the\nsystem.\n", "  Organic-inorganic coupling in the hybrid lead-halide perovskite is a central\nissue in rationalizing the outstanding photovoltaic performance of these\nemerging materials. Here we compare and contrast the evolution of structure and\ndynamics of the hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 and the inorganic CsPbBr3 lead-halide\nperovskites with temperature, using Raman spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray\ndiffraction. Results reveal a stark contrast between their order-disorder\ntransitions, abrupt for the hybrid whereas smooth for the inorganic perovskite.\nX-ray diffraction observes an intermediate incommensurate phase between the\nordered and the disordered phases in CH3NH3PbBr3. Low-frequency Raman\nscattering captures the appearance of a sharp soft mode in the incommensurate\nphase, ascribed to the theoretically predicted amplitudon mode. Our work\nhighlights the interaction between the structural dynamics of organic cation\nCH3NH3+ and the lead-halide framework, and unravels the competition between\ntendencies of the organic and inorganic moieties to minimize energy in the\nincommensurate phase of the hybrid perovskite structure.\n", "  We show that the stochastic evolution of an interacting system of the Higgs\nand a spectator scalar field naturally gives rise to an enhanced probability of\nsettling down at the electroweak vacuum at the end of inflation. Subsequent\ndestabilization due to parametric resonance between the Higgs and the spectator\nfield can be avoided in a wide parameter range. We further argue that the\nspectator field can play the role of dark matter.\n", "  We have developed a non-destructive readout system that uses a floating-gate\namplifier on a thick, fully depleted charge coupled device (CCD) to achieve\nultra-low readout noise of 0.068 e- rms/pix. This is the first time that\ndiscrete sub-electron readout noise has been achieved reproducibly over\nmillions of pixels on a stable, large-area detector. This allows the precise\ncounting of the number of electrons in each pixel, ranging from pixels with 0\nelectrons to more than 1500 electrons. The resulting CCD detector is thus an\nultra-sensitive calorimeter. It is also capable of counting single photons in\nthe optical and near-infrared regime. Implementing this innovative\nnon-destructive readout system has a negligible impact on CCD design and\nfabrication, and there are nearly immediate scientific applications. As a\nparticle detector, this CCD will have unprecedented sensitivity to low-mass\ndark matter particles and coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, while\nastronomical applications include future direct imaging and spectroscopy of\nexoplanets.\n", "  The LIGO/Virgo Collaboration (LVC) detected on 2017 January 4, a significant\ngravitational-wave (GW) event (now named GW170104). We report in this Letter\nthe main results obtained from the analysis of hard X-ray and gamma-ray data of\nthe AGILE mission that repeatedly observed the GW170104 localization region\n(LR). At the LVC detection time $T_0$ AGILE observed about 36% of the LR. The\ngamma-ray imaging detector did not reveal any significant emission in the\nenergy range 50 MeV--30 GeV. Furthermore, no significant gamma-ray transients\nwere detected in the LR that was repeatedly exposed over timescales of minutes,\nhours, and days. We also searched for transient emission using data near $T_0$\nof the omnidirectional detector MCAL operating in the energy band 0.4--100 MeV.\nA refined analysis of MCAL data shows the existence of a weak event (that we\ncall \"E2\") with a signal-to-noise ratio of $4.4\\,\\sigma$ lasting about 32 ms\nand occurring $0.46\\,\\pm\\,0.05 \\,\\rm s$ before $T_0$. A study of the MCAL\nbackground and of the false-alarm rate of E2 leads to the determinination of a\npost-trial significance between $2.4\\,\\sigma$ and $2.7\\,\\sigma$ for a temporal\ncoincidence with GW170104. We note that E2 has characteristics similar to those\ndetected from the weak precursor of the short GRB 090510. The candidate event\nE2 is worth consideration for simultaneous detection by other satellites. If\nassociated with GW170104, it shows emission in the MeV band of a short burst\npreceding the final coalescence by 0.46 sec and involving $\\sim 10^{-7}$ of the\ntotal rest mass energy of the system.\n", "  We present the discovery, classification, and radio-to-X-ray follow-up\nobservations of iPTF17cw, a broad-lined (BL) type Ic supernova (SN) discovered\nby the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). Although unrelated to the\ngravitational wave trigger, this SN was discovered as a happy by-product of the\nextensive observational campaign dedicated to the follow-up of Advanced LIGO\nevent GW170104. The spectroscopic properties and inferred peak bolometric\nluminosity of iPTF17cw are most similar to the gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated\nSN 1998bw, while the shape of the r-band light curve is most similar to that of\nthe relativistic SN 2009bb. Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations\nof the iPTF17cw field reveal a radio counterpart about 10 times less luminous\nthan SN 1998bw, and with peak radio luminosity comparable to that of SN\n2006aj/GRB 060218 and SN 2010bh/GRB 100316D. Our radio observations of iPTF17cw\nimply a relativistically expanding outflow. However, further late-time\nobservations with the VLA in its most extended configuration are needed to\nconfirm fading of iPTF radio counterpart at all frequencies. X-ray observations\ncarried out with Chandra reveal the presence of an X-ray counterpart with\nluminosity similar to that of SN 2010bh/GRB 100316D. Searching the Fermi\ncatalog for possible gamma-rays reveals that GRB 161228B is spatially and\ntemporally compatible with iPTF17cw. The similarity to SN 1998bw and SN 2009bb,\nthe radio and X-ray detections, and the potential association with GRB 161228B,\nall point to iPTF17cw being a new candidate member of the rare sample of\noptically-discovered engine-driven BL-Ic SNe associated with relativistic\nejecta.\n", "  We introduce different strategies to enhance photon generation in a cavity\nwithin the Rabi model in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a\nbang-bang strategy allows to enhance the effect of up to one order of magnitude\nwith respect to simply driving the system in resonance for a fixed time.\nMoreover, up to about another order of magnitude can be gained exploiting\nquantum optimal control strategies. Finally, we show that such optimized\nprotocols are robust with respect to systematic errors and noise, paving the\nway to future experimental implementations of such strategies.\n", "  There exists a critical speed of propagation of the line solitons in the\nZakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation such that small transversely periodic\nperturbations are unstable for line solitons with larger-than-critical speeds\nand orbitally stable for those with smaller-than-critical speeds. The normal\nform for transverse instability of the line soliton with a nearly critical\nspeed of propagation is derived by means of symplectic projections and\nnear-identity transformations. Justification of this normal form is provided\nwith the energy method. The normal form predicts a transformation of the\nunstable line solitons with larger-than-critical speeds to the orbitally stable\ntransversely modulated solitary waves.\n", "  We predict the existence of triple point fermions in the band structure of\nseveral half-Heusler topological insulators by $ab~initio$ calculations and the\nKane model. We find that many half-Heusler compounds exhibit multiple triple\npoints along four independent $C_3$ axes, through which the doubly degenerate\nconduction bands and the nondegenerate valence band cross each other linearly\nnearby the Fermi energy. When projected from the bulk to the (111) surface,\nmost of these triple points are located far away from the surface\n$\\bar{\\Gamma}$ point, as distinct from previously reported triple point fermion\ncandidates. These isolated triple points give rise to Fermi arcs on the\nsurface, that can be readily detected by photoemission spectroscopy or scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy.\n", "  We theoretically study the dynamics of ferrimagnetic domain walls in the\npresence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that an application of a\nDC magnetic field can induce terahertz spin-wave emission by driving\nferrimagnetic domain walls, which is not possible for ferromagnetic or\nantiferromagnetic domain walls. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is shown to\nfacilitate the teraherz spin-wave emission in wide ranges of net angular\nmomentum by increasing the Walkerbreakdown field. Moreover, we show that\nspin-orbit torque combined with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction also drives a\nfast ferrimagnetic domain wall motion with emitting terahertz spin-waves in\nwide ranges of net angular momentum.\n", "  Topological phases of matter in (2+1) dimensions are commonly equipped with\nglobal symmetries, such as electric-magnetic duality in gauge theories and\nbilayer symmetry in fractional quantum Hall states. Gauging these symmetries\ninto local dynamical ones is one way of obtaining exotic phases from\nconventional systems. We study this using the bulk-boundary correspondence and\napplying the orbifold construction to the (1+1) dimensional edge described by a\nconformal field theory (CFT). Our procedure puts twisted boundary conditions\ninto the partition function, and predicts the fusion, spin and braiding\nbehavior of anyonic excitations after gauging. We demonstrate this for the\nelectric-magnetic self-dual $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, the twofold symmetric\n$SU(3)_1$, and the $S_3$-symmetric $SO(8)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theories.\n", "  For dry foams, the transport of gas from small high-pressure bubbles to large\nlow-pressure bubbles is dominated by diffusion across the thin soap films\nseparating neighboring bubbles. For wetter foams, the film areas become smaller\nas the Plateau borders and vertices inflate with liquid. So-called\n\"border-blocking\" models can explain some features of wet-foam coarsening based\non the presumption that the inflated borders totally block the gas flux,\nhowever, this approximation dramatically fails in the wet/unjamming limit where\nthe bubbles become close-packed spheres and coarsening proceeds even though\nthere are no films. Here, we account for the ever-present border-crossing flux\nby a new length scale defined by the average gradient of gas concentration\ninside the borders. We compute that it is proportional to the geometric average\nof film and border thicknesses, and we verify this scaling by numerical\nsolution of the diffusion equation. We similarly consider transport across\ninflated vertices and surface Plateau borders in quasi-2d foams. And we show\nhow the $dA/dt=K_0(n-6)$ von~Neumann law is modified by the appearance of terms\nthat depend on bubble size and shape as well as the concentration gradient\nlength scales. Finally, we use the modified von~Neumann law to compute the\ngrowth rate of the average bubble area, which is not constant.\n", "  The temperature scaling of the micromagnetic Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya exchange\ninteraction is calculated for the whole range of temperature. We use Green's\nfunction theory to derive the finite-temperature spin wave spectrum of\nferromagnetic systems described by a classical atomistic spin model\nHamiltonian. Within this model, we find universal expressions for the\ntemperature scaling not only of the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction but also\nof the Heisenberg exchange stiffness and the single-ion anisotropy. In the\nspirit of multiscale models, we establish a clear connection between the\natomistic interactions and the temperature-dependent coefficients in the spin\nwave spectrum and in the micromagnetic free energy functional. We demonstrate\nthat the corrections to mean-field theory or the random phase approximation for\nthe temperature scaling of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya and Heisenberg exchange\ninteractions assume very similar forms. In the presence of thermal fluctuations\nand Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction an anisotropy-like term emerges in the\nspin wave spectrum which, at low temperature, increases with temperature, in\ncontrast to the decreasing single-ion anisotropy. We evaluate the accuracy of\nthe theoretical method by comparing it to the spin wave spectrum calculated\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  The cosmic-ray positron flux calculated using the cosmic-ray nuclei\ninteractions in our Galaxy cannot explain observed data above 10 GeV. An excess\nin the measured positron flux is therefore open to interpretation. Nearby\npulsars, located within sub-kiloparsec range of the Solar system, are often\ninvoked as plausible sources contributing to the excess. We show that an\nadditional, sub-dominant population of sources together with the contributions\nfrom a few nearby pulsars can explain the latest positron excess data from the\nAlpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS). We simultaneously model, using the DRAGON\ncode, propagation of cosmic-ray proton, Helium, electron and positron and fit\ntheir respective flux data. Our fit to the Boron to Carbon ratio data gives a\ndiffusion spectral index of 0.45, which is close to the Kraichnan turbulent\nspectrum.\n", "  Luminous Galactic OH/IR stars have been identified as massive (>4-5 M_s) AGB\nstars experiencing HBB and Li production. Their Rb abundances and [Rb/Zr]\nratios derived from hydrostatic model atmospheres, are significantly higher\nthan predictions from AGB nucleosynthesis models, posing a problem to our\nunderstanding of AGB evolution and nucleosynthesis. We report new Rb and Zr\nabundances in the full sample of massive Galactic AGB stars, previously studied\nwith hydrostatic models, by using more realistic extended model atmospheres. We\nuse a modified version of the spectral synthesis code Turbospectrum and\nconsider the presence of a circumstellar envelope and radial wind. The Rb and\nZr abundances are determined from the 7800 A Rb I resonant line and the 6474 A\nZrO bandhead, respectively, and we explore the sensitivity of the derived\nabundances to variations of the stellar (Teff) and wind (M_loss, beta and vexp)\nparameters in the extended models. The Rb and Zr abundances derived from the\nbest spectral fits are compared with the most recent AGB nucleosynthesis\ntheoretical models. The new Rb abundances are much lower (even 1-2 dex) than\nthose derived with the hydrostatic models, while the Zr abundances are similar.\nThe Rb I line profile and Rb abundance are very sensitive to the M_loss rate\nbut much less sensitive to variations of the wind velocity-law and the\nvexp(OH). We confirm the earlier preliminary results based on a smaller sample\nof massive O-rich AGB stars, that the use of extended atmosphere models can\nsolve the discrepancy between the AGB nucleosynthesis theoretical models and\nthe observations of Galactic massive AGB stars. The Rb abundances, however, are\nstill strongly dependent of the M_loss, which is unknown in these AGB stars.\nAccurate M_loss rates in these massive Galactic AGB stars are needed in order\nto break the models degeneracy and get reliable Rb abundances in these stars.\n", "  Many cosmological studies predict that early supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\ncan only form in the most massive dark matter halos embedded within large scale\nstructures marked by galaxy over-densities that may extend up to 10 physical\nMpc. This scenario, however, has not been confirmed observationally, as the\nsearch for galaxy over-densities around high-z quasars has returned conflicting\nresults. The field around the z=6.28 quasar SDSSJ1030+0524 (J1030) is unique\nfor multi-band coverage and represents an excellent data legacy for studying\nthe environment around a primordial SMBH. In this paper we present wide-area\n(25x25 arcmin), Y- and J-band imaging of the J1030 field obtained with the near\ninfrared camera WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We built\nsource catalogues in the Y- and J-band, and matched those with our photometric\ncatalogue in the r, z, i bands presented in Morselli et al. (2014). We used\nthese new infrared data together with H and K and Spitzer/IRAC data to refine\nour selection of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs), extending our selection criteria\nto galaxies in the range 25.2<zAB<25.7. We selected 21 robust high-z candidates\nin the J1030 field with photometric redshift around 6 and colors i-z>=1.3. We\nfound a significant asymmetry in the distribution of the high-z galaxies in\nJ1030, supporting the existence of a coherent large-scale structure around the\nquasar. We compared our results with those of Bowler et al. (2015), who adopted\nsimilar LBGs selection criteria, and estimated an over-density of galaxies in\nthe field of delta = 2.4, which is significant at >4 sigma. The over-density\nvalue and its significance are higher than those found in Morselli et al.\n(2014), and we interpret this as evidence of an improved LBG selection.\n", "  Searching for extreme emission line galaxies allows us to find low-mass\nmetal-poor galaxies that are good analogs of high redshift Ly$\\alpha$ emitting\ngalaxies. These low-mass extreme emission line galaxies are also potential\nLyman-continuum leakers. Finding them at very low redshifts ($z\\lesssim0.05$)\nallows us to be sensitive to even lower stellar masses and metallicities. We\nreport on a sample of extreme emission line galaxies at $z\\lesssim0.05$\n(blueberry galaxies). We selected them from SDSS broadband images on the basis\nof their broad band colors, and studied their properties with MMT spectroscopy.\nFrom the whole SDSS DR12 photometric catalog, we found 51 photometric\ncandidates. We spectroscopically confirm 40 as blueberry galaxies. (An\nadditional 7 candidates are contaminants, and 4 remain without spectra.) These\nblueberries are dwarf starburst galaxies with very small sizes ($<\n1\\hbox{kpc}$), and very high ionization ([OIII]/[OII]$\\sim10-60$). They also\nhave some of the lowest stellar masses\n($\\log(\\hbox{M}/\\hbox{M}_{\\odot})\\sim6.5-7.5$) and lowest metallicities\n($7.1<12+\\log(\\hbox{O/H})<7.8$) starburst galaxies. Thus they are small\ncounterparts to green peas and high redshift Ly$\\alpha$ emitting galaxies.\n", "  Dark matter (DM) is added to the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism, and\nconditions for its successful freezeout identified. Requesting the FN scale\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{FN}}$ to be the cutoff of the theory renders freezeout\nscenarios surprisingly few. Fermionic DM is typically charged under\n$U(1)_{\\text{FN}}$, with the dominant annihilation channel a CP-even flavon +\nCP-odd flavon. A minimal case is when the DM-flavon coupling strength is\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, with several implications: (1) the DM mass is\n$\\mathcal{O}$(100 GeV - 1 TeV), thanks to the WIMP coincidence, (2) requiring\nperturbativity of couplings puts a lower $and$ upper limit on the flavor scale,\n2 TeV $\\lesssim \\Lambda_{\\text{FN}} \\lesssim 14~$TeV, on account of its\nrelation to DM mass and couplings, (3) DM is a \"secluded WIMP\" effectively\nhidden from collider and direct detection searches. Limits on the masses of\ndark matter and mediators from kaon mixing measurements constitute the best\nconstraints, surpassing Xenon1T, Fermi-LAT, and the LHC. Future direct\ndetection searches, and collider searches for missing energy plus a single\njet/bottom/top, are promising avenues for discovery.\n", "  The magnetic field driven superconductor to insulator transition in thin\nfilms was theoretically analyzed via a vortex-charge duality transformation\napplied to the Hamiltonian. Vortices condensation was conjectured as the\nunderline physical mechanism of the insulating phase. Experimental evidence\nsupported duality symmetry across the magnetic-field driven superconductor to\ninsulator transition in amorphous Indium Oxide films. Counterintuitively,\nduality symmetry is broken at low temperatures where the insulating phase\ndevelops strongly non linear current-voltage characteristics. Here, we follow\nthe breakdown of duality symmetry down to very low temperatures and demonstrate\nthe restoration of duality symmetry out of equilibrium.\n", "  Experimental data from hadronic $\\tau$ decays allow for a precision\ndetermination of the slope of the $I=1$ vacuum polarization at zero momentum.\nWe use this information to provide a value for the next-to-next-to-leading\norder (NNLO) low-energy constant $C_{93}$ in chiral perturbation theory. The\nlargest systematic error in this determination results from the neglect of\nterms beyond NNLO in the effective chiral Lagrangian, whose presence in the\ndata will, in general, make the effective $C_{93}$ determined in an NNLO\nanalysis mass dependent. We estimate the size of this effect by using strange\nhadronic $\\tau$-decay data to perform an alternate $C_{93}$ determination based\non the slope of the strange vector polarization at zero momentum, which differs\nfrom that of the $I=1$ vector channel only through $SU(3)$ flavor-breaking\neffects. We also comment on the impact of such higher order effects on\nChPT-based estimates for the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to the\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment.\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of coupled Coulomb crystals of\ndifferent sizes trapped in a double well potential. The dynamics is induced by\nan instantaneous quench of the potential barrier separating the two crystals.\nDue to the intra- and inter-crystal Coulomb interactions and the asymmetric\npopulation of the potential wells we observe a complex reordering of ions\nwithin the two crystals as well as ion transfer processes from one well to the\nother. The study and analysis of the latter processes constitutes the main\nfocus of this work. In particular we examine the dependence of the observed ion\ntransfers on the quench amplitude performing an analysis for different\ncrystalline configurations ranging from one-dimensional ion chains via\ntwo-dimensional zig-zag chains and ring structures to three-dimensional\nspherical structures. Such an analysis provides us with the means to extract\nthe general principles governing the ion transfer dynamics and we gain some\ninsight on the structural disorder caused by the quench of the barrier height.\n", "  We present a determination of the pion charge radius from high precision data\non the pion vector form factor from both timelike and spacelike regions, using\na novel formalism based on analyticity and unitarity. At low energies, instead\nof the poorly known modulus of the form factor, we use its phase, known with\nhigh accuracy from Roy equations for $\\pi\\pi$ elastic scattering via the\nFermi-Watson theorem. We use also the values of the modulus at several higher\ntimelike energies, where the data from $e^+e^-$-annihilation and $\\tau$-decay\nare mutually consistent, as well as the most recent measurements at spacelike\nmomenta. The experimental uncertainties are implemented by Monte-Carlo\nsimulations. The results, which do not rely on a specific parametrization, are\noptimal for the given input information and do not depend on the unknown phase\nof the form factor above the first inelastic threshold. Our prediction for the\ncharge radius of the pion is $r_\\pi=(0.657 \\pm 0.003) \\fm $, which amounts to\nan increase in precision by a factor of about 2.7 compared to the PDG average.\n", "  The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is observed in magnetic insulator|heavy metal\nbilayers as an inverse spin Hall effect voltage under a temperature gradient.\nThe SSE can be detected nonlocally as well, viz. in terms of the voltage in a\nsecond metallic contact (detector) on the magnetic film, spatially separated\nfrom the first contact that is used to apply the temperature bias (injector).\nMagnon-polarons are hybridized lattice and spin waves in magnetic materials,\ngenerated by the magnetoelastic interaction. Kikkawa et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{117}, 207203 (2016)] interpreted a resonant enhancement of the local\nSSE in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) as a function of the magnetic field in terms\nof magnon-polaron formation. Here we report the observation of magnon-polarons\nin \\emph{nonlocal} magnon spin injection/detection devices for various\ninjector-detector spacings and sample temperatures. Unexpectedly, we find that\nthe magnon-polaron resonances can suppress rather than enhance the nonlocal\nSSE. Using finite element modelling we explain our observations as a\ncompetition between the SSE and spin diffusion in YIG. These results give\nunprecedented insights into the magnon-phonon interaction in a key magnetic\nmaterial.\n", "  The radiative properties of most structures are intimately connected to the\nway in which their constituents are ordered on the nano-scale. We have proposed\na new representation for radiative heat transfer formalism in many-body\nsystems. In this representation, we explain why collective effects depend on\nthe morphology of structures, and how the arrangement of nanoparticles and\ntheir material affects the thermal properties in many-body systems. We\ninvestigated the radiative heat transfer problem in fractal (i.e., scale\ninvariant) structures. In order to show the effect of the structure morphology\non the collective properties, the radiative heat transfer and radiative cooling\nare studied and the results are compared for fractal and non-fractal\nstructures. It is shown that fractal arranged nanoparticles display complex\nradiative behavior related to their scaling properties. we showed that, in\ncontrast to non-fractal structures, heat flux in fractals is not of large-range\ncharacter. By using the fractal dimension as a means to describe the structure\nmorphology, we present a universal scaling behavior that quantitatively links\nthe structure radiative cooling to the structure gyration radius.\n", "  The inversion symmetry breaking at the interface between different materials\ngenerates a strong interfacial spin-orbit coupling (ISOC) that may influence\nthe spin and charge transport in hybrid structures. Here we use a simple\nanalytically solvable model to study in the ballistic approximation various\nspin transport phenomena induced by ISOC in a bilayer metallic system. In this\nmodel a non-equilibrium steady state carrying a spin current is created by\napplying a spin dependent bias across the metallic junction. Physical\nobservables are then calculated using the scattering matrix approach. In\nparticular we calculate the absorption of the spin current at the interface\n(the interface spin-loss) and study the interface spin-to-charge conversion.\nThe latter consists of an in-plane interface charge current generated by the\nspin dependent bias applied to the junction, which can be viewed as a spin\ngalvanic effect mediated by ISOC. Finally we demonstrate that ISOC leads to an\ninterfacial spin current swapping, that is, the \"primary\" spin current flowing\nthrough the spin-orbit active interface is necessarily accompanied with a\n\"secondary' swapped spin current flowing along the interface and polarized in\nthe direction perpendicular to that of the \"primary\" current. Using the exact\nspin continuity equation we relate the swapping effect to the intefacial\nspin-loss, and argue that this effect is generic and independent on the\nballistic approximation used for specific calculations.\n", "  We consider actions for particles and strings, including twistorial\ndescriptions on 4d Minkowski and AdS$_5$ spacetimes from the point of view of\nco-adjoint orbits for the isometry group. We also consider the collective\ncoordinate dynamics of singular solutions in Chern-Simons (CS) theories and CS\ntheories of gravity. This is a generalization of the work of Einstein, Infeld\nand Hoffmann and also has potential points of contact with fluid-gravity\ncorrespondence.\n", "  We present the first simultaneous analysis of the galaxy overdensity and\npeculiar velocity fields by modelling their cross-covariance. We apply our new\nmaximum-likelihood approach to data from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey\n(6dFGS), which has the largest single collection of peculiar velocities to\ndate. We present a full derivation of the analytic expression for the\ncross-covariance between the galaxy overdensity and peculiar velocity fields\nand find direct evidence for a non-zero correlation between the fields on\nscales up to $\\sim50 h^{-1}$ Mpc. When utilising the cross-covariance, our\nmeasurement of the normalised growth rate of structure is $f\\sigma_8(z=0) =\n0.424^{+0.067}_{-0.064}$ (15% precision), and our measurement of the\nredshift-space distortion parameter is $\\beta=0.341^{+0.062}_{-0.058}$ (18%\nprecision). Both measurements improve by $\\sim$20% compared to only using the\nauto-covariance information. This is consistent with the literature on\nmultiple-tracer approaches, as well as Fisher matrix forecasts and previous\nanalyses of 6dFGS. Our measurement of $f\\sigma_8$ is consistent with the\nstandard cosmological model, and we discuss how our approach can be extended to\ntest alternative models of gravity.\n", "  The propagator of two nucleons in infinite nuclear matter is evaluated by a\ndiagonalization of the $pphh$ RPA Hamiltonian. This effective Hamiltonian is\nnon-Hermitian and, for specific density domains and partial waves, yields pairs\nof complex conjugated eigenvalues representing in-medium bound states of two\nnucleons. The occurrence of these complex poles in the two-particle Greens\nfunction is tightly related to the well known BCS pairing approach. It is\ndemonstrated that these complex eigenvalues and the corresponding bound state\nwavefunctions contain all information about the BCS gap function. This is\nillustrated by calculations for $^1S_0$ and $^3PF_2$ pairing gaps in neutron\nmatter which essentially coincide with the corresponding gap functions\nextracted from conventional solutions of the gap equation. Differences between\nthe bound states in the conventional BCS approach and the $pphh$ RPA are\narising in the case of $^3SD_1$ channel in symmetric nuclear matter at low\ndensities. These differences are discussed in the context of transition from\nBEC for quasi-deuterons to the formation of BCS pairing.\n", "  Using polarization-resolved resonant Raman spectroscopy, we explore\ncollective spin excitations of the chiral surface states in a three dimensional\ntopological insulator, Bi$_2$Se$_3$. We observe a sharp peak at 150 meV in the\npseudovector $A_2$ symmetry channel of the Raman spectra. By comparing the data\nwith calculations, we identify this peak as the transverse collective spin mode\nof surface Dirac fermions. This mode, unlike a Dirac plasmon or a surface\nplasmon in the charge sector of excitations, is analogous to a spin wave in a\npartially polarized Fermi liquid, with spin-orbit coupling playing the role of\nan effective magnetic field.\n", "  We calculate global (unified) wind models of main-sequence, giant, and\nsupergiant O stars from our Galaxy. The models are calculated by solving\nhydrodynamic, kinetic equilibrium (also known as NLTE) and comoving-frame (CMF)\nradiative transfer equations from the (nearly) hydrostatic photosphere to the\nsupersonic wind. For given stellar parameters, our models predict the\nphotosphere and wind structure and in particular the wind mass-loss rates\nwithout any free parameters. Our predicted mass-loss rates are by a factor of\n2--5 lower than the commonly used predictions. A possible cause of the\ndifference is abandoning of the Sobolev approximation for the calculation of\nthe radiative force, because our models agree with predictions of CMF NLTE\nradiative transfer codes. Our predicted mass-loss rates agree nicely with the\nmass-loss rates derived from observed near-infrared and X-ray line profiles and\nare slightly lower than mass-loss rates derived from combined UV and H$\\alpha$\ndiagnostics. The empirical mass-loss rate estimates corrected for clumping may\ntherefore be reconciled with theoretical predictions in such a way that the\naverage ratio between individual mass-loss rate estimates is not higher than\nabout $ 1.6 $. On the other hand, our predictions are by factor of $ 4.7 $\nlower than pure H$\\alpha$ mass-loss rate estimates and can be reconciled with\nthese values only assuming a microclumping factor of at least eight.\n", "  Magnetic fields, compressibility and turbulence are important factors in many\nterrestrial and astrophysical processes. While energy dynamics, i.e. how energy\nis transferred within and between kinetic and magnetic reservoirs, has been\npreviously studied in the context of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nturbulence, we extend shell-to-shell energy transfer analysis to the\ncompressible regime. We derive four new transfer functions specifically\ncapturing compressibility effects in the kinetic and magnetic cascade, and\ncapturing energy exchange via magnetic pressure. To illustrate their viability,\nwe perform and analyze four simulations of driven isothermal MHD turbulence in\nthe sub- and supersonic regime with two different codes. On the one hand, our\nanalysis reveals robust characteristics across regime and numerical method. For\nexample, energy transfer between individual scales is local and forward for\nboth cascades with the magnetic cascade being stronger than the kinetic one.\nMagnetic tension and magnetic pressure related transfers are less local and\nweaker than the cascades. We find no evidence for significant nonlocal\ntransfer. On the other hand, we show that certain functions, e.g., the\ncompressive component of the magnetic energy cascade, exhibit a more complex\nbehavior that varies both with regime and numerical method. Having established\na basis for the analysis in the compressible regime, the method can now be\napplied to study a broader parameter space.\n", "  We report on observation of pronounced terahertz radiation-induced\nmagneto-resistivity oscillations in AlGaAs/GaAs two-dimensional electron\nsystems, the THz analog of the microwave induced resistivity oscillations\n(MIRO). Applying high power radiation of a pulsed molecular laser we\ndemonstrate that MIRO, so far observed at low power only, are not destroyed\neven at very high intensities. Experiments with radiation intensity ranging\nover five orders of magnitude from $0.1$ W/cm$^2$ to $10^4$ W/cm$^2$ reveal\nhigh-power saturation of the MIRO amplitude, which is well described by an\nempirical fit function $I/(1 + I/I_s)^\\beta$ with $\\beta \\sim 1$. The\nsaturation intensity Is is of the order of tens of W/cm$^2$ and increases by\nsix times by increasing the radiation frequency from $0.6$ to $1.1$ THz. The\nresults are discussed in terms of microscopic mechanisms of MIRO and compared\nto nonlinear effects observed earlier at significantly lower excitation\nfrequencies.\n", "  We review lessons from the AdS/CFT correspondence that indicate that the\nemergence of locality in quantum gravity is contingent on considering\nobservables with a small number of insertions. Correlation functions where the\nnumber of insertions scales with a power of the central charge of the CFT are\nsensitive to nonlocal effects in the bulk theory, which arise from a\ncombination of the effects of the bulk Gauss law and a breakdown of\nperturbation theory. To examine whether a similar effect occurs in flat space,\nwe consider the scattering of massless particles in the bosonic string and the\nsuperstring in the limit where the number of external particles, n, becomes\nvery large. We use estimates of the volume of the Weil-Petersson moduli space\nof punctured Riemann surfaces to argue that string amplitudes grow factorially\nin this limit. We verify this factorial behaviour through an extensive\nnumerical analysis of string amplitudes at large n. Our numerical calculations\nrely on the observation that, in the large n limit, the string scattering\namplitude localizes on the Gross-Mende saddle points, even though individual\nparticle energies are small. This factorial growth implies the breakdown of\nstring perturbation theory for $n \\sim (M_{pl}/E)^{d-2}$ in d dimensions where\nE is the typical individual particle energy. We explore the implications of\nthis breakdown for the black hole information paradox. We show that the loss of\nlocality suggested by this breakdown is precisely sufficient to resolve the\ncloning and strong subadditivity paradoxes.\n", "  One of the central goals of the newborn field of gravitational wave astronomy\nis to test gravity in the highly nonlinear, strong field regime characterizing\nthe spacetime of black holes. In particular, \"black hole spectroscopy\" (the\nobservation and identification of black hole quasinormal mode frequencies in\nthe gravitational wave signal) is expected to become one of the main tools for\nprobing the structure and dynamics of Kerr black holes. In this paper we take a\nsignificant step towards that goal by constructing a \"post-Kerr\" quasinormal\nmode formalism. The formalism incorporates a parametrized but general\nperturbative deviation from the Kerr metric and exploits the well-established\nconnection between the properties of the spacetime's circular null geodesics\nand the fundamental quasinormal mode to provide approximate, eikonal limit\nformulae for the modes' complex frequencies. The resulting algebraic toolkit\ncan be used in waveform templates for ringing black holes with the purpose of\nmeasuring deviations from the Kerr metric. As a first illustrative application\nof our framework, we consider the Johannsen-Psaltis deformed Kerr metric and\ncompute the resulting deviation in the quasinormal mode frequency relative to\nthe known Kerr result.\n", "  A controlled quantum system can alter its environment by feedback, leading to\nreduced-entropy states of the environment and to improved system coherence.\nHere, using a quantum dot electron spin as control and probe, we prepare the\nquantum dot nuclei under the feedback of coherent population trapping and\nmeasure the evolution from a thermal to a reduced-entropy state, with the\nimmediate consequence of extended qubit coherence. Via Ramsey interferometry on\nthe electron spin, we directly access the nuclear distribution following its\npreparation, and measure the emergence and decay of correlations within the\nnuclear ensemble. Under optimal feedback, the inhomogeneous dephasing time of\nthe electron, $T_2^*$, is extended by an order of magnitude to $39$~ns. Our\nresults can be readily exploited in quantum information protocols utilizing\nspin-photon entanglement, and represent a step towards creating quantum\nmany-body states in a mesoscopic nuclear spin ensemble.\n", "  Movies of prominences obtained by space instruments e.g. the Solar Optical\nTelescope (SOT) aboard the {\\it Hinode} satellite and the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS) with high temporal and spatial resolution revealed\nthe tremendous dynamical nature of prominences. { Knots of plasma belonging to\nprominences} appear to travel along both vertical and horizontal thread-like\nloops, with highly dynamical nature.\n  The aim of the paper is to reconstruct the 3D shape of a helical prominence\nobserved over two and a half hours by IRIS.\n  From the IRIS \\ion{Mg}{ii} k spectra we compute Doppler shifts of the plasma\ninside the prominence and from the slit-jaw images (SJI){ we derive the\ntransverse field in the plane of the sky. Finally we obtain the velocity vector\nfield of the knots in 3D.\n  We reconstruct the real trajectories of nine knots travelling along ellipses.\n  The spiral-like structure of the prominence observed in the plane of the sky\nis mainly due to the projection effect of long arches of threads (up to 8 $\n\\times 10^4$ km). Knots run along more or less horizontal threads with\nvelocities reaching 65 km s$^{-1}$. The dominant driving force is the gas\npressure.\n", "  All estimates of cluster mass have some intrinsic scatter and perhaps some\nbias with true mass even in the absence of measurement errors for example\ncaused by cluster triaxiality and large scale structure. Knowledge of the bias\nand scatter values is fundamental for both cluster cosmology and astrophysics.\nIn this paper we show that the intrinsic scatter of a mass proxy can be\nconstrained by measurements of the gas fraction because masses with higher\nvalues of intrinsic scatter with true mass produce more scattered gas\nfractions. Moreover, the relative bias of two mass estimates can be constrained\nby comparing the mean gas fraction at the same (nominal) cluster mass. Our\nobservational study addresses the scatter between caustic (i.e., dynamically\nestimated) and true masses, and the relative bias of caustic and hydrostatic\nmasses. For these purposes, we used the X-ray Unbiased Cluster Sample, a\ncluster sample selected independently from the intracluster medium content with\nreliable masses: 34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe,\nmostly with $14<\\log M_{500}/M_\\odot \\lesssim 14.5$, and with caustic masses.\nWe found a 35\\% scatter between caustic and true masses. Furthermore, we found\nthat the relative bias between caustic and hydrostatic masses is small,\n$0.06\\pm0.05$ dex, improving upon past measurements. The small scatter found\nconfirms our previous measurements of a highly variable amount of feedback from\ncluster to cluster, which is the cause of the observed large variety of\ncore-excised X-ray luminosities and gas masses.\n", "  We use a cluster sample selected independently of the intracluster medium\ncontent with reliable masses to measure the mean gas mass fraction and its\nscatter, the biases of the X-ray selection on gas mass fraction, and the\ncovariance between the X-ray luminosity and gas mass. The sample is formed by\n34 galaxy clusters in the nearby ($0.050<z<0.135$) Universe, mostly with\n$14<\\log M_{500}/M_\\odot \\lesssim 14.5$, and with masses calculated with the\ncaustic technique. First, we found that integrated gas density profiles have\nsimilar shapes, extending earlier results based on subpopulations of clusters\nsuch as those that are relaxed or X-ray bright for their mass. Second, the\nX-ray unbiased selection of our sample allows us to unveil a variegate\npopulation of clusters; the gas mass fraction shows a scatter of $0.17\\pm0.04$\ndex, possibly indicating a quite variable amount of feedback from cluster to\ncluster, which is larger than is found in previous samples targeting\nsubpopulations of galaxy clusters, such as relaxed or X-ray bright clusters.\nThe similarity of the gas density profiles induces an almost scatterless\nrelation between X-ray luminosity, gas mass, and halo mass, and modulates\nselection effects in the halo gas mass fraction: gas-rich clusters are\npreferentially included in X-ray selected samples. The almost scatterless\nrelation also fixes the relative scatters and slopes of the $L_X-M$ and\n$M_{gas}-M$ relations and makes core-excised X-ray luminosities and gas masses\nfully covariant. Therefore, cosmological or astrophysical studies involving\nX-ray or SZ selected samples need to account for both selection effects and\ncovariance of the studied quantities with X-ray luminosity/SZ strength.\n", "  Modern and future particle accelerators employ increasingly higher intensity\nand brighter beams of charged particles and become operationally limited by\ncoherent beam instabilities. Usual methods to control the instabilities, such\nas octupole magnets, beam feedback dampers and use of chromatic effects, become\nless effective and insufficient. We show that, in contrast, Lorentz forces of a\nlow-energy, a magnetically stabilized electron beam, or \"electron lens\", easily\nintroduces transverse nonlinear focusing sufficient for Landau damping of\ntransverse beam instabilities in accelerators. It is also important that,\nunlike other nonlinear elements, the electron lens provides the frequency\nspread mainly at the beam core, thus allowing much higher frequency spread\nwithout lifetime degradation. For the parameters of the Future Circular\nCollider, a single conventional electron lens a few meters long would provide\nstabilization superior to tens of thousands of superconducting octupole\nmagnets.\n", "  We report $^{75}$As nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on a new\niron-based superconductor CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ with $T_{\\rm c}$ = 35 K. $^{75}$As\nNMR spectra show two distinct lines corresponding to the As(1) and As(2) sites\nclose to the K and Ca layers, respectively, revealing that K and Ca layers are\nwell ordered without site inversions. We found that nuclear quadrupole\nfrequencies $\\nu_{\\rm Q}$ of the As(1) and As(2) sites show an opposite\ntemperature ($T$) dependence. Nearly $T$ independent behavior of the Knight\nshifts $K$ are observed in the normal state, and a sudden decrease in $K$ in\nthe superconducting (SC) state clearly evidences spin-singlet Cooper pairs.\n$^{75}$As spin-lattice relaxation rates 1/$T_1$ show a power law $T$ dependence\nwith different exponents for the two As sites. The isotropic antiferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations characterized by the wavevector ${\\bf q}$ = ($\\pi$, 0) or (0,\n$\\pi$) in the single-iron Brillouin zone notation are revealed by 1/$T_1T$ and\n$K$ measurements. Such magnetic fluctuations are necessary to explain the\nobserved temperature dependence of the $^{75}$As quadrupole frequencies, as\nevidenced by our first-principles calculations. In the SC state, 1/$T_1$ shows\na rapid decrease below $T_{\\rm c}$ without a Hebel-Slichter peak and decreases\nexponentially at low $T$, consistent with an $s^{\\pm}$ nodeless two-gap\nsuperconductor.\n", "  We show that the gravitational quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a Schwarzschild\nblack hole play the role of a multimode squeezer that can generate particles.\nFor a minimally coupled scalar field, the QNMs \"squeeze\" the initial state of\nthe scalar field (even for the vacuum) and produce scalar particles. The\nmaximal squeezing amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube of the\nimaginary part of the QNM frequency, implying that the particle generation\nefficiency is higher for lower decaying QNMs. Our results show that the\ngravitational perturbations can amplify Hawking radiation.\n", "  We study the effect of band anisotropy with discrete rotational symmetry\n$C_N$ (where $N\\ge 2$) in the quantum Hall regime of two-dimensional electron\nsystems. We focus on the composite Fermi liquid (CFL) at half filling of the\nlowest Landau level. We find that the magnitude of anisotropy transferred to\nthe composite fermions decreases very rapidly with $N$. We demonstrate this by\nperforming density matrix normalization group calculations on the CFL, and\ncomparing the anisotropy of the composite fermion Fermi contour with that of\nthe (non-interacting) electron Fermi contour at zero magnetic field. We also\nshow that the effective interaction between the electrons after projecting into\na single Landau level is much less anisotropic than the band, a fact which does\nnot depend on filling and thus has implications for other quantum Hall states\nas well. Our results confirm experimental observations on anisotropic bands\nwith warped Fermi contours, where the only detectable effect on the composite\nFermi contour is an elliptical distortion ($N = 2$).\n", "  A large fraction of the gas in the Galaxy is cold, dense, and molecular. If\nall this gas collapsed under the influence of gravity and formed stars in a\nlocal free-fall time, the star formation rate in the Galaxy would exceed that\nobserved by more than an order of magnitude. Other star-forming galaxies behave\nsimilarly. Yet observations and simulations both suggest that the molecular gas\nis indeed gravitationally collapsing, albeit hierarchically. Prompt stellar\nfeedback offers a potential solution to the low observed star formation rate if\nit quickly disrupts star-forming clouds during gravitational collapse. However,\nthis requires that molecular clouds must be short-lived objects, raising the\nquestion of how so much gas can be observed in the molecular phase. This can\noccur only if molecular clouds form as quickly as they are destroyed,\nmaintaining a global equilibrium fraction of dense gas. We therefore examine\ncloud formation timescales. We first demonstrate that supernova and superbubble\nsweeping cannot produce dense gas at the rate required to match the cloud\ndestruction rate. On the other hand, Toomre gravitational instability can reach\nthe required production rate. We thus argue that, although dense, star-forming\ngas may last only around a single global free-fall time, the dense gas in\nstar-forming galaxies can globally exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium\nbetween formation by gravitational instability, and disruption by stellar\nfeedback. At redshift z >~ 2, the Toomre instability timescale decreases,\nresulting in a prediction of higher molecular gas fractions at early times, in\nagreement with observations.\n", "  The brightness of the tip of the Red Giant Branch is a useful reference\nquantity for several fields of astrophysics. An accurate theoretical prediction\nis needed for such purposes. Aims. We intend to provide a solid theoretical\nprediction for it, valid for a reference set of standard physical assumptions,\nand mostly independent of numerical details. We examine the dependence on\nphysical assumptions and numerical details, for a wide range of metallicities\nand masses, and based on two different stellar evolution codes. We adjust\ndifferences between the codes to treat the physics as identical as possible.\nAfter we have succeeded in reproducing the tip brightness between the codes, we\npresent a reference set of models based on the most up to date physical inputs,\nbut neglecting microscopic diffusion, and convert theoretical luminosities to\nobserved infrared colours suitable for observations of resolved populations of\nstars and include analytic fits to facilitate their use. We find that\nconsistent use of updated nuclear reactions, including an appropriate treatment\nof the electron screening effects, and careful time-stepping on the upper red\ngiant branch are the most important aspects to bring initially discrepant\ntheoretical values into agreement. Small, but visible differences remain\nunexplained for very low metallicities and mass values at and above 1.2 Msun,\ncorresponding to ages younger than 4 Gyr. The colour transformations introduce\nlarger uncertainties than the differences between the two stellar evolution\ncodes. We demonstrate that careful stellar modeling allows an accurate\nprediction for the luminosity of the Red Giant Branch tip. Differences to\nempirically determined brightnesses may result either from insufficient colour\ntransformations or from deficits in the constitutional physics. We present the\nbest-tested theoretical reference values to date.\n", "  Sterile neutrinos, if they exist, are potential harbingers for physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. They have the capacity to shed light on our flavor sector,\ngrand unification frameworks, dark matter sector and origins of baryon\nanti-baryon asymmetry. There have been a few seminal studies that have broached\nthe subject of sterile neutrinos with low, electroweak-scale masses (i.e.\n$\\Lambda_{\\text{\\tiny{QCD}}} \\ll m_{N_R} \\ll m_{W^\\pm}$) and investigated their\nreach at hadron colliders using lepton jets. These preliminary studies\nnevertheless assume background-free scenarios after certain selection criteria\nwhich are overly optimistic and untenable in realistic situations. These lead\nto incorrect projections. The unique signal topology and challenging hadronic\nenvironment also make this mass-scale regime ripe for a careful investigation.\nWith the above motivations, we attempt to perform the first systematic study of\nlow, electroweak-scale, right-handed neutrinos at hadron colliders, in this\nunique signal topology. There are currently no active searches at hadron\ncolliders for sterile neutrino states in this mass range, and we frame the\nstudy in the context of the $13\\,\\rm{TeV}$ high-luminosity Large Hadron\nCollider and the proposed FCC-hh/SppC $100\\,\\rm{TeV}$ $pp$-collider.\n", "  The definitions of breaks and clusters in a one-dimensional chain in\nequilibrium are discussed. Analytical expressions are obtained for the expected\ncluster length, $\\langle K \\rangle$, as a function of temperature and pressure\nin a one-dimensional Lennard-Jones chain. These expressions are compared with\nresults from molecular dynamics simulations. It is found that $\\langle K\n\\rangle$ increases exponentially with $\\beta = 1/k_BT$ and with pressure, $P$\nin agreement with previous results in the literature. A method is illustrated\nfor using $\\langle K \\rangle (\\beta, P)$ to generate a \"phase diagram\" for the\nLennard-Jones chain. Some implications for the study of heat transport in\nLennard-Jones chains are discussed.\n", "  In this paper we present a new and efficient analytical solutions for\nevolving the QED$\\otimes$QCD DGLAP evolution equations in mellin space and\nobtain the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in perturbative QCD including\nthe QED corrections. The validity of our analytical solutions, which have done\nin the next to leading order QCD and the leading order QED approximations, are\nchecked with the initial parton distributions from newly released CT14QED\nglobal analysis code (Phys. Rev.D93,114015(2016)). The evolved parton\ndistributions are in good agreement with CT14QED code and also with those from\nAPFEL (Computer Physics Communications 185, 1647 (2014)) program.\n", "  We present a calculation of the strong decays of the exotic states\n$Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b'(10650)$ using a covariant quark model. We use a\nmolecular-type four-quark current for the coupling of the $Z_b(10610)$ and\n$Z_b'(10650)$ to the constituent heavy and light quarks.\n", "  We determine the antisymmetric current-current response for a pair of (type\nI) tilted Weyl cones with opposite chirality. We find that the dynamical chiral\nmagnetic effect depends on the magnitude of the tilt and on the angle between\nthe tilting direction and the wave vector of the magnetic field. Additionally,\nthe chiral magnetic effect is shown to be closely related to the presence of an\nintrinsic anomalous Hall effect with a current perpendicular to the tilting\ndirection and the electric field. We investigate the nonanalytic\nlong-wavelength limit of the corresponding transport coefficients.\n", "  We determine the physical properties of a sample of SMGs in the COSMOS field\nthat were pre-selected at the observed wavelength of $\\lambda_{\\rm obs}=1.1$\nmm, and followed up at $\\lambda_{\\rm obs}=1.3$ mm with ALMA. We used MAGPHYS to\nfit the panchromatic (ultraviolet to radio) SEDs of 124 of the target SMGs,\n19.4% of which are spectroscopically confirmed. The SED analysis was\ncomplemented by estimating the gas masses of the SMGs by using the\n$\\lambda_{\\rm obs}=1.3$ mm emission as a tracer of the molecular gas. The\nsample median and 16th-84th percentile ranges of the stellar masses, SFRs, dust\ntemperatures, and dust and gas masses were derived to be $\\log(M_{\\star}/{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot})=11.09^{+0.41}_{-0.53}$, ${\\rm SFR}=402^{+661}_{-233}$ ${\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$, $T_{\\rm dust}=39.7^{+9.7}_{-7.4}$ K, $\\log(M_{\\rm\ndust}/{\\rm M}_{\\odot})=9.01^{+0.20}_{-0.31}$, and $\\log(M_{\\rm gas}/{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot})=11.34^{+0.20}_{-0.23}$, respectively. The median gas-to-dust ratio\nand gas fraction were found to be $120^{+73}_{-30}$ and $0.62^{+0.27}_{-0.23}$,\nrespectively. We found that 57.3% of our SMGs populate the main sequence (MS)\nof star-forming galaxies, while 41.9% of the sources lie above the MS by a\nfactor of >3 (one source lies below the MS). The largest 3 GHz radio sizes are\nfound among the MS sources. Those SMGs that appear irregular in the rest-frame\nUV are predominantly starbursts, while the MS SMGs are mostly disk-like. The\nlarger radio-emitting sizes of the MS SMGs compared to starbursts is a likely\nindication of their more widespread, less intense star formation. The irregular\nUV morphologies of the starburst SMGs are likely to echo their merger nature.\nOur results suggest that the transition from high-$z$ SMGs to local ellipticals\nvia compact, quiescent galaxies (cQGs) at $z \\sim 2$ might not be universal,\nand the latter population might also descend from the so-called blue nuggets.\n", "  The tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect is the dependence of the thermopower of\nmagnetic tunnel junctions on the magnetic configuration. It is conventionally\ninterpreted in terms of a thermoelectric generalization of the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance. Here, we investigate the heat-driven electron transport in\nthese junctions associated with electron-magnon scattering, using stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz phenomenology and quantum kinetic theory. Our findings\nchallenge the widely accepted single-electron picture of the tunneling\nthermopower in magnetic junctions.\n", "  Recently, we introduced an approach for more easily interpreting searches for\nresonances at the LHC - and to aid in distinguishing between realistic and\nunrealistic alternatives for potential signals. This `simplfied limits'\napproach was derived using the narrow width approximation (NWA) - and therefore\nwas not obviously relevant in the case of wider resonances. Here, we broaden\nthe scope of the analysis. First, we explicitly generalize the formalism to\nencompass resonances of finite width. We then examine how the width of the\nresonance modifies bounds on new resonances that are extracted from LHC\nsearches. Second, we demonstrate, using a wide variety of cases, with different\nincoming partons, resonance properties, and decay signatures, that the limits\nderived in the NWA yield pertinant, and somewhat conservative (less stringent)\nbounds on the model parameters. We conclude that the original simplified limits\napproach is useful in the early stages of evaluating and interpreting new\ncollider data and that the generalized approach is a valuable further aid when\nevidence points toward a broader resonance.\n", "  We investigate gravitational correlation functions in a curved background\nwith the help of nonperturbative renormalization group methods. Beta functions\nfor eleven couplings are derived, two of which correspond to running gauge\nparameters. A unique ultraviolet fixed point is found, suitable for a UV\ncompletion in the sense of Asymptotic Safety. To arrive at a well-behaved flow\nin a curved background, the regularization must be chosen carefully. We provide\ntwo admissible choices to solve this issue in the present approximation. We\nfurther demonstrate by an explicit calculation that the Landau limit is a fixed\npoint also for quantum gravity, and additionally show that in this limit, the\ngauge parameter $\\beta$ does not flow.\n", "  We demonstrate the fundamental links existing between two different\ndescriptions of quantum electrodynamics in inhomogeneous, lossy and dispersive\ndielectric media which are based either on the Huttner-Barnett formalism for\npolaritons [B. Huttner and S. M. Barnett, Phys.Rev. A 46, 4306 (1992)] or the\nLangevin noise approach using fluctuating currents [T. Gruner and D.-G. Welsch,\nPhys.Rev.A 53, 1818 (1996)]. In this work we demonstrate the practical\nequivalence of the two descriptions by introducing the concept of effective\nphoton state associated with some specific noise current distribution. We study\nthe impact of these results on the calculation and interpretation of quantum\nobservables such as fluctuations, correlations, and Casimir forces.\n", "  We selected a sample of 76 Lya emitting galaxies from the VIMOS Ultra Deep\nSurvey (VUDS) at 2<z<4. We estimated the velocity of the neutral gas flowing\nout of the interstellar medium as the velocity offset, Deltav, between the\nsystemic redshift (zsys) and the center of low-ionization absorption line\nsystems (LIS). To increase the SN of VUDS spectra, we stacked subsamples. We\nmeasured the systemic redshift from the rest-frame UV spectroscopic data using\nthe CIII]1908 nebular emission line, and we considered SiII1526 as the highest\nsignal-to-noise LIS line. We calculated the Lya peak shift with respect to the\nzsys, the EW(Lya), and the Lya spatial extension, Ext(Lya-C), from the profiles\nin the 2D stacked spectra. The galaxies that are faint in the rest-frame UV\ncontinuum, strong in Lya and CIII], with compact UV morphology, and localized\nin an underdense environment are characterized by outflow velocities of the\norder of a few hundreds of km/sec. The subsamples with smaller Deltav are\ncharacterized by larger Lya peak shifts, larger Ext(Lya-C), and smaller\nEW(Lya). In general we find that EW(Lya) anti-correlates with Ext(Lya-C) and\nLya peak shift. We interpret these trends using a radiative-transfer shell\nmodel. The model predicts that an HI gas with a column density larger than\n10^20/cm^2 is able to produce Lya peak shifts larger than >300km/sec. An ISM\nwith this value of NHI would favour a large amount of scattering events,\nespecially when the medium is static, so it can explain large values of\nExt(Lya-C) and small EW(Lya). On the contrary, an ISM with a lower NHI, but\nlarge velocity outflows would lead to a Lya spatial profile peaked at the\ngalaxy center (i.e. low values of Ext(Lya-C)) and to a large EW(Lya), as we see\nin our data. Our results and their interpretation via radiative-transfer models\ntell us that it is possible to use Lya to study the properties of the HI gas.\n", "  Aims. We investigate the maximum astrometric precision that can be reached on\nmoving targets observed with digital-sensor arrays, and provide an estimate for\nits ultimate lower limit based on the Cram\\'er-Rao bound.\n  Methods. We extend previous work on one-dimensional Gaussian point-spread\nfunctions (PSFs) focusing on moving objects and extending the scope to\ntwo-dimensional array detectors. In this study the PSF of a stationary\npoint-source celestial body is replaced by its convolution with a linear\nmotion, thus effectively modeling the spread function of a moving target.\n  Results. The expressions of the Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound deduced by this\nmethod allow us to study in great detail the limit of astrometric precision\nthat can be reached for moving celestial objects, and to compute an optimal\nexposure time according to different observational parameters such as seeing,\ndetector pixel size, decentering, and elongation of the source caused by its\ndrift. Comparison to simulated and real data shows that the predictions of our\nsimple model are consistent with observations.\n", "  In this article, a novel two-path model is proposed to quantitatively explain\nsub-threshold characteristics of back-gated Schottky barrier FETs (SB-FETs)\nfrom 2D channel materials. The model integrates the 'conventional' model for\nSB-FETs with the phenomenon of contact gating - an effect that significantly\naffects the carrier injection from the source electrode in back-gated field\neffect transistors. The two-path model is validated by a careful comparison\nwith experimental characteristics obtained from a large number of back-gated\nWSe2 devices with various channel thicknesses. Our findings are believed to be\nof critical importance for the quantitative analysis of many three-terminal\ndevices with ultrathin body channels.\n", "  We experimentally investigate superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators\nin external magnetic fields and present two strategies to reduce field-induced\ndissipation channels and resonance frequency shifts. One of our approaches is\nto significantly reduce the superconducting ground-plane areas, which leads to\nreduced magnetic field-focussing and thus to lower effective magnetic fields\ninside the waveguide cavity. By this measure, the field-induced losses can be\nreduced by more than one order of magnitude in mT out-of-plane magnetic fields.\nWhen these resonators are additionally coupled inductively instead of\ncapacitively to the microwave feedlines, an intrinsic closed superconducting\nloop is effectively shielding the heart of the resonator from magnetic fields\nby means of flux conservation. In total, we achieve a reduction of the\nfield-induced resonance frequency shift by up to two orders of magnitude. We\ncombine systematic parameter variations on the experimental side with numerical\nmagnetic field calculations to explain the effects of our approaches and to\nsupport our conclusions. The presented results are relevant for all areas,\nwhere high-performance superconducting resonators need to be operated in\nmagnetic fields, e.g. for quantum hybrid devices with superconducting circuits\nor electron spin resonance detectors based on coplanar waveguide cavities.\n", "  We present new Adaptive Optics (AO) imaging and spectroscopic measurements of\nGalactic Center source G1 from W. M. Keck Observatory. Our goal is to\nunderstand its nature and relationship to G2, which is the first example of a\nspatially-resolved object interacting with the supermassive black hole (SMBH).\nBoth objects have been monitored with AO for the past decade (2003 - 2014) and\nare comparatively close to the black hole ($a_{\\rm{min}} \\sim$200-300 AU) on\nvery eccentric orbits ($e_{\\rm{G1}}\\sim$0.99; $e_{\\rm{G2}}\\sim$0.96). While G2\nhas been tracked before and during periapse passage ($T_{0} \\sim$ 2014.2), G1\nhas been followed since soon after emerging from periapse ($T_{0} \\sim$\n2001.3). Our observations of G1 double the previously reported observational\ntime baseline, which improves its orbital parameter determinations. G1's\norbital trajectory appears to be in the same plane as that of G2, but with a\nsignificantly different argument of periapse ($\\Delta\\omega$ = 21$\\pm$4\ndegrees). This suggests that G1 is an independent object and not part of a gas\nstream containing G2 as has been proposed. Furthermore, we show for the first\ntime that: (1) G1 is extended in the epochs closest to periapse along the\ndirection of orbital motion and (2) G1 becomes significantly smaller over time,\n(450 AU in 2004 to less than 170 AU in 2009). Based on these observations, G1\nappears to be the second example of an object tidally interacting with a SMBH.\nG1's existence 14 years after periapse, along with its compactness in epochs\nfurther from the time of periapse, suggest that this source is stellar in\nnature.\n", "  We study theoretically a driven hybrid optomechanical system with a\nmembrane-in-the-middle configuration containing two identical elongated\ncigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in each side of the membrane. In\nthe weakly interacting regime, the BECs can be considered as single-mode\noscillators in the Bogoliubov approximation which are coupled to the optical\nfield through the radiation pressure interaction so that they behave as two\nquasi-membranes. We show that the degree of squeezing of each BEC and its\nentanglement with the moving membrane can be controlled by the \\textit{s}-wave\nscattering frequency of the other one. Since the \\textit{s}-wave frequency of\neach BEC depends on the transverse trapping frequency of the atoms which is an\nexperimentally controllable parameter, one can control the entanglement and\nsqueezing of each BEC through the trapping frequency of the other one.\n", "  The study of electroweak boson pair production provides a powerful test of\nthe spontaneously broken gauge symmetry of the Standard Model (SM) and can be\nused to search for new phenomena beyond the SM. Extra neutral vector bosons\n$Z'$ decaying to charged gauge vector boson pairs $W^+W^-$ are predicted in\nmany scenarios of new physics, including models with an extended gauge sector.\nThe diboson production allows to place stringent constraints on the $Z$-$Z'$\nmixing factor $\\xi$ and $Z'$ mass, $M_{Z'}$. We present the $Z'$ exclusion\nregion in the $\\xi-M_{Z'}$ plane for the first time by using data comprised of\n$pp$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and recorded by the ATLAS and CMS\ndetectors at the CERN LHC, with integrated luminosities of 13.2 and 35.9\nfb$^{-1}$, respectively. The exclusion region has been significantly extended\ncompared to that obtained from the previous analysis performed with Tevatron\ndata as well as with LHC data collected at 7 and 8 TeV. Also, we found that\nthese constraints on the $Z$-$Z'$ mixing factor are more severe than those\nderived from the global analysis of electroweak data. Further improvement on\nthe constraining of this mixing can be achieved from the analysis of data to be\ncollected at higher luminosity.\n", "  We present a scheme of interaction-induced topological bandstructures based\non the spin anisotropy of exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities. We\npredict theoretically that this scheme allows the engineering of topological\ngaps, without requiring a magnetic field or strong spin-orbit interaction\n(transverse electric-transverse magnetic splitting). Under non-resonant\npumping, we find that an initially topologically trivial system undergoes a\ntopological transition upon the spontaneous breaking of phase symmetry\nassociated with polariton condensation. Under resonant coherent pumping, we\nfind that it is also possible to engineer a topological dispersion that is\nlinear in wavevector -- a property associated with polariton superfluidity.\n", "  We study structure formation using relativistic cosmological linear\nperturbation theory in the presence of intrinsic and relative (with respect to\nmatter) non-adiabatic dark energy perturbations. For different dark energy\nmodels we assess the impact of non-adiabaticity on the matter growth promoting\na comparison with growth rate data. The dark energy models studied lead to\npeculiar signatures of the (non)adiabatic nature of dark energy perturbations\nin the evolution of the $f \\sigma_{8}(z)$ observable. We show that\nnon-adiabatic DE models become close to be degenerated with respect to the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model at first order in linear perturbations. This would avoid the\nidentification of the non-adiabatic nature of dark energy using current\navailable data. Therefore, such evidence indicates that new probes are\nnecessary to reveal the non-adiabatic features in the dark energy sector.\n", "  We investigate the electric field shielding of ultracold collisions of\ndipolar rotors, initially in their first rotational excited state, using an\nadimensional approach. We establish a map of good and bad candidates for\nefficient evaporative cooling based on this shielding mechanism, by presenting\nthe ratio of elastic over quenching processes as a function of a rescaled\nrotational constant $\\tilde{B} = B/s_{E_3}$ and a rescaled electric field\n$\\tilde{F} = dF/B$. $B, d, F, s_{E_3}$ are respectively the rotational\nconstant, the full electric dipole moment of the molecules, the applied\nelectric field and a characteristic dipole-dipole energy. We identify two\ngroups of bi-alkali dipolar molecules. The first group, including RbCs, NaK,\nKCs, LiK, NaRb, LiRb, NaCs and LiCs, is favorable with a ratio over 1000 at\ncollision energies equal (or even higher) to their characteristic dipolar\nenergy. The second group, including LiNa and KRb, is not favorable. More\ngenerally, for molecules well described by Hund's case b, our adimensional\nstudy provides the conditions of efficient evaporative cooling. The range of\nappropriate rescaled rotational constant and rescaled field is approximately\n$\\tilde{B} \\ge 10^8$ and $3.25 \\le \\tilde{F} \\le 3.8$, with a maximum ratio\nreached for $\\tilde{F} \\simeq 3.4$ for a given $\\tilde{B}$. We also discuss the\nimportance of the electronic van der Waals interaction on the adimensional\ncharacter of our study.\n", "  We propose a route towards creating a metamaterial that behaves as a photonic\nChern insulator, through homogenization of an array of gyromagnetic cylinders.\nWe show that such an array can exhibit non-trivial topological effects,\nincluding topologically non-trivial band gaps and one-way edge states, when it\ncan be homogenized to an effective medium model that has the Berry curvature\nstrongly peaked at the wavevector k=0. The non-trivial band topology depends\nonly on the parameters of the cylinders and the cylinders' density, and can be\nrealized in a wide variety of different lattices including periodic,\nquasi-periodic and random lattices. Our system provides a platform to explore\nthe interplay between disorder and topology and also opens a route towards\nsynthesis of topological meta-materials based on the self-assembly approach.\n", "  Renormalization group ideas and results from critical droplet theory are used\nto construct a scaling ansatz for the imaginary component of the free energy of\nan Ising model in its metastable state close to the critical point. The\nanalytic properties of the free energy are used to determine scaling functions\nfor the free energy in the vicinity of the critical point and the abrupt\ntransition line. These functions have essential singularities at the abrupt\ntransition. Analogous forms for the magnetization and susceptibility in two\ndimensions are fit to numeric data and show good agreement, especially when\ntheir nonsingular behavior is modified to match existing numeric results.\n", "  The pyrochlore metal Cd2Re2O7 has been recently investigated by\nsecond-harmonic generation (SHG) reflectivity. In this paper, we develop a\ngeneral formalism that allows for the identification of the relevant tensor\ncomponents of the SHG from azimuthal scans. We demonstrate that the secondary\norder parameter identified by SHG at the structural phase transition is the\nx2-y2 component of the axial toroidal quadrupole. This differs from the 3z2-r2\nsymmetry of the atomic displacements associated with the I-4m2 crystal\nstructure that was previously thought to be its origin. Within the same\nformalism, we suggest that the primary order parameter detected in the SHG\nexperiment is the 3z2-r2 component of the magnetic quadrupole. We discuss the\ngeneral mechanism driving the phase transition in our proposed framework, and\nsuggest experiments, particularly resonant X-ray scattering ones, that could\nclarify this issue.\n", "  We present high angular resolution dust polarization and molecular line\nobservations carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) toward the Class 0 protostar Serpens SMM1. By complementing these\nobservations with new polarization observations from the Submillimeter Array\n(SMA) and archival data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave\nAstronomy (CARMA) and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescopes (JCMT), we can compare\nthe magnetic field orientations at different spatial scales. We find major\nchanges in the magnetic field orientation between large (~0.1 pc) scales --\nwhere the magnetic field is oriented E-W, perpendicular to the major axis of\nthe dusty filament where SMM1 is embedded -- and the intermediate and small\nscales probed by CARMA (~1000 AU resolution), the SMA (~350 AU resolution), and\nALMA (~140 AU resolution). The ALMA maps reveal that the redshifted lobe of the\nbipolar outflow is shaping the magnetic field in SMM1 on the southeast side of\nthe source; however, on the northwestern side and elsewhere in the source, low\nvelocity shocks may be causing the observed chaotic magnetic field pattern.\nHigh-spatial-resolution continuum and spectral-line observations also reveal a\ntight (~130 AU) protobinary system in SMM1-b, the eastern component of which is\nlaunching an extremely high-velocity, one-sided jet visible in both CO(2-1) and\nSiO(5-4); however, that jet does not appear to be shaping the magnetic field.\nThese observations show that with the sensitivity and resolution of ALMA, we\ncan now begin to understand the role that feedback (e.g., from protostellar\noutflows) plays in shaping the magnetic field in very young, star-forming\nsources like SMM1.\n", "  We study the role of \"$\\theta$ terms\" in the action for three-dimensional\n$U(1)$ symmetric tensor gauge theories, describing quantum phases of matter\nhosting gapless higher-spin gauge modes and gapped subdimensional particle\nexcitations, such as fractons. In Maxwell theory, the $\\theta$ term is a total\nderivative which has no effect on the gapless photon, but has two important,\nclosely related consequences: attaching electric charge to magnetic monopoles\n(the Witten effect) and leading to a Chern-Simons theory on the boundary. We\nwill find that a similar story holds in the higher-spin $U(1)$ gauge theories.\nThese theories admit generalized $\\theta$ terms which have no effect on the\ngapless gauge mode, but which bind together electric and magnetic charges (both\nof which are generally subdimensional) in specific combinations, in a\nhigher-spin manifestation of the Witten effect. We derive the corresponding\nWitten quantization condition. We find that, as in Maxwell theory, imposing\ntime-reversal invariance restricts $\\theta$ to certain discrete values. We also\nfind that these new $\\theta$ terms imply a non-trivial boundary structure. The\nboundaries host fracton excitations coupled to a tensor $U(1)$ gauge field with\na Chern-Simons-like action, in both chiral and non-chiral varieties. These\nboundary theories open a door to the study of $U(1)$ fracton phases described\nby tensor Chern-Simons theories, not only on boundaries of three-dimensional\nsystems, but also in strictly two spatial dimensions. We explicitly work\nthrough three examples of bulk and boundary theories, the principles of which\ncan be readily extended to arbitrary higher-spin theories.\n", "  We analyzed data from the first year of a survey for Near Earth Objects\n(NEOs) that we are carrying out with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) on the\n4-meter Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. We\nimplanted synthetic NEOs into the data stream to derive our nightly detection\nefficiency as a function of magnitude and rate of motion. Using these measured\nefficiencies and the Solar System absolute magnitudes derived by the Minor\nPlanet Center for the 1377 measurements of 235 unique NEOs detected, we\ndirectly derive, for the first time from a single observational data set, the\nNEO size distribution from 1 km down to 10 meters. We find that there are\n10^6.6 NEOs larger than 10 meters. This result implies a factor of ten fewer\nsmall NEOs than some previous results, though our derived size distribution is\nin good agreement with several other estimates.\n", "  Mg/Si and Fe/Si ratios are important parameters that control the composition\nof rocky planets. In this work we applied non-LTE correction to the Mg and Si\nabundances of stars with and without planets to confirm/infirm our previous\nfindings that [Mg/Si] atmospheric abundance is systematically higher for\nSuper-Earth/Neptune-mass planet hosts than stars without planets. Our results\nshow that the small differences of stellar parameters observed in these two\ngroups of stars are not responsible for the already reported difference in the\n[Mg/Si] ratio. Thus, the high [Mg/Si] ratio of Neptunian hosts is probably\nrelated to the formation efficiency of these planets in such environments.\n", "  Since its experimental discovery, many phenomenological theories successfully\nreproduced the rapid rise from $p$ to $1+p$ found in the Hall number $n_H$ at\nthe critical doping $p^*$ of the pseudogap in superconducting cuprates. Further\ncomparison with experiments is now needed in order to narrow down candidates.\nIn this paper, we consider three previously successful phenomenological\ntheories in a unified formalism---an antiferromagnetic mean field (AF), a\nspiral incommensurate antiferromagnetic mean field (sAF), and the\nYang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) theory. We find a rapid rise in the specific heat and a\nrapid drop in the Seebeck coefficient for increasing doping across the\ntransition in each of those models. The predicted rises and drops are locked,\nnot to~$p^*$, but to the doping where anti-nodal electron pockets,\ncharacteristic of each model, appear at the Fermi surface shortly before~$p^*$.\nWhile such electron pockets are still to be found in experiments, we discuss\nhow they could provide distinctive signatures for each model. We also show that\nthe range of doping where those electron pockets would be found is strongly\naffected by the position of the van~Hove singularity.\n", "  Cross-correlations between Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and\n$y$-spectral distortions anisotropies have been previously proposed as a way to\nmeasure the local bispectrum parameter $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc.}$ in a range of\nscales inaccessible to either CMB ($T$, $E$) bispectra or $T$-$\\mu$\ncorrelations. This is useful e.g. to test scale dependence of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity. Unfortunately, the primordial $y$-T signal is strongly\ncontaminated by the late-time correlation between the Integrated Sachs Wolfe\nand Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects. Moreover, SZ itself generates a large\nnoise contribution in the $y$-parameter map. We consider two original ways to\naddress these issues. In order to remove the bias due to the SZ-CMB temperature\ncoupling, while also adding new signal, we include in the analysis the\ncross-correlation between $y$-distortions and CMB {\\em polarization}. In order\nto reduce the noise, we propose to clean the $y$-map by subtracting a SZ\ntemplate, reconstructed via cross-correlation with external tracers (CMB and\ngalaxy-lensing signals). We combine this SZ template subtraction with the\npreviously adopted solution of directly masking detected clusters. Our final\nforecasts show that, using $y$-distortions, a PRISM-like survey can achieve\n$1\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^\\text{loc.}) = 300$, while an ideal experiment will achieve\n$1\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL}^\\text{loc.}) = 130$, with improvements of a factor $\\sim 3$\nfrom adding the $y$-$E$ signal, and a further $20-30 \\%$ from template\ncleaning. These forecasts are much worse than current $f_{\\rm NL}^\\text{loc.}$\nboundaries from {\\em Planck}, but we stress again that they refer to completely\ndifferent scales.\n", "  Gamma-ray and fast-neutron imaging was performed with a novel liquid xenon\n(LXe) scintillation detector read out by a Gaseous Photomultiplier (GPM). The\n100 mm diameter detector prototype comprised a capillary-filled LXe\nconverter/scintillator, coupled to a triple-THGEM imaging-GPM, with its first\nelectrode coated by a CsI UV-photocathode, operated in Ne/5%CH4 cryogenic\ntemperatures. Radiation localization in 2D was derived from\nscintillation-induced photoelectron avalanches, measured on the GPM's segmented\nanode. The localization properties of Co-60 gamma-rays and a mixed\nfast-neutron/gamma-ray field from an AmBe neutron source were derived from\nirradiation of a Pb edge absorber. Spatial resolutions of 12+/-2 mm and 10+/-2\nmm (FWHM) were reached with Co-60 and AmBe sources, respectively. The\nexperimental results are in good agreement with GEANT4 simulations. The\ncalculated ultimate expected resolutions for our application-relevant 4.4 and\n15.1 MeV gamma-rays and 1-15 MeV neutrons are 2-4 mm and ~2 mm (FWHM),\nrespectively. These results indicate the potential applicability of the new\ndetector concept to Fast-Neutron Resonance Radiography (FNRR) and\nDual-Discrete-Energy Gamma Radiography (DDEGR) of large objects.\n", "  We study hadronic transitions between bottomonium states using 496 fb$^{-1}$\ndata collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the\nKEKB asymmetric energy $e^{+}e^{-}$ collider. We measure: ${\\cal\nB}(\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\Upsilon(1S))=(8.2\\pm 0.5 {\\rm(stat.)} \\pm 0.4\n{\\rm(syst.)})\\times10^{-5}$, ${\\cal\nB}(\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\Upsilon(2S))=(7.9\\pm 1.0 {\\rm(stat.)} \\pm 0.4\n{\\rm(syst.)})\\times10^{-5}$, and ${\\cal\nB}(\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\eta\\Upsilon(1S))=(1.70\\pm 0.23 {\\rm(stat.)} \\pm 0.08\n{\\rm(syst.)})\\times10^{-4}$. We measure the ratio of branching fractions ${\\cal\nR} = {\\cal B}(\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\eta\\Upsilon(1S))/{\\cal\nB}(\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\Upsilon(1S)) = 2.07\\pm 0.30 {\\rm(stat.)} \\pm 0.11\n{\\rm(syst.)}$. We search for the decay\n$\\Upsilon(1^3D_{1,2})\\to\\eta\\Upsilon(1S)$, but do not find significant evidence\nfor such a transition. We also measure the initial state radiation production\ncross sections of the $\\Upsilon(2S,3S)$ resonances and we find values\ncompatible with the expected ones. Finally, the analysis of the\n$\\Upsilon(4S)\\to\\pi^+\\pi^-\\Upsilon(1S)$ events shows indications for a resonant\ncontribution due to the $f_0(980)$ meson.\n", "  Inelastic neutron-scattering and finite-temperature density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) calculations are used to investigate the spin\nexcitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg spin chain compound\nK$_2$CuSO$_4$Cl$_2$ at several temperatures in a magnetic field near\nsaturation. Critical correlations characteristic of the predicted $z=2$, $d=1$\nquantum phase transition occurring at saturation are shown to be consistent\nwith the observed neutron spectra. The data is well described with a scaling\nfunction computed using a free fermion description of the spins, valid close to\nsaturation, and the corresponding scaling limits. One of the most prominent\nnon-universal spectral features of the data is a novel thermally activated\nlongitudinal mode that remains underdamped across most of the Brillouin zone.\n", "  Observations towards L1630 in the Orion B molecular cloud, comprising the\niconic Horsehead Nebula, allow us to study the interplay between stellar\nradiation and a molecular cloud under relatively benign conditions, that is,\nintermediate densities and an intermediate UV radiation field. Contrary to the\nwell-studied Orion Molecular Cloud 1 (OMC1), which hosts much harsher\nconditions, L1630 has little star formation. We aim to relate the [CII]\nfine-structure line emission to the physical conditions predominant in L1630\nand compare it to studies of OMC1. The [CII] $158\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ emission from\nan area of $12' \\times 17'$ in L1630 was observed using the upGREAT instrument\nonboard SOFIA. Of the [CII] emission from the mapped area 95%, $13\\,L_{\\odot}$,\noriginates from the molecular cloud; the adjacent HII region contributes only\n5%, that is, $1\\,L_{\\odot}$. From comparison with other data (CO (1-0)-line\nemission, far-infrared (FIR) continuum studies, emission from polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)), we infer a gas density of the molecular cloud of\n$n_{\\mathrm{H}}\\sim 3\\cdot 10^3\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, with surface layers,\nincluding the Horsehead Nebula, having a density of up to $n_{\\mathrm{H}}\\sim\n4\\cdot 10^4\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. The temperature of the surface gas is $T\\sim\n100\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The average [CII] cooling efficiency within the molecular\ncloud is $1.3\\cdot 10^{-2}$. The fraction of the mass of the molecular cloud\nwithin the studied area that is traced by [CII] is only $8\\%$. Our PDR models\nare able to reproduce the FIR-[CII] correlations and also the CO (1-0)-[CII]\ncorrelations. Finally, we compare our results on the heating efficiency of the\ngas with theoretical studies of photoelectric heating by PAHs, clusters of\nPAHs, and very small grains, and find the heating efficiency to be lower than\ntheoretically predicted, a continuation of the trend set by other observations.\n", "  We study the effect of action noise on state-to-state control protocols.\nAction noise creates dephasing in the instantaneous eigenbasis of the\nHamiltonian and hampers the fidelity of the final state with respect to the\ntarget state. We find that for shorter protocols the noise more strongly\ninfluences the dynamics and degrades fidelity. We suggest improving the\nfidelity by inducing stronger dephasing rates along the process. The effects of\naction noise on the dynamics and its manipulation is described for a general\nHamiltonian and is then studied by examples.\n", "  In this paper we derive a general solution for the most general rotating and\ntwisting locally rotationally symmetric spacetimes. This is achieved in three\nsteps. First we decompose the manifold via 1+1+2 semi-tetrad formalism that\nyields a set of geometrical and thermodynamic scalars for the spacetime. We\nthen recast the Einstein field equations in terms of evolution and propagation\nof these scalars. It is then shown that this class of spacetimes must possess\nself similarity and we use this property to solve for these scalars, thus\nobtaining a general solution. This solution has a number of very interesting\ncosmological or astrophysical consequences which we discuss in detail.\n", "  We present subarcsecond angular resolution observations carried out with the\nSubmillimeter Array (SMA) at 880 $\\mu$m centered at the B0-type protostar\nGGD27~MM1, the driving source of the parsec scale HH 80-81 jet. We constrain\nits polarized continuum emission to be $\\lesssim0.8\\%$ at this wavelength. Its\nsubmm spectrum is dominated by sulfur-bearing species tracing a rotating\ndisk--like structure (SO and SO$_2$ isotopologues mainly), but also shows\nHCN-bearing and CH$_3$OH lines, which trace the disk and the outflow cavity\nwalls excavated by the HH 80-81 jet. The presence of many sulfurated lines\ncould indicate the presence of shocked gas at the disk's centrifugal barrier or\nthat MM1 is a hot core at an evolved stage. The resolved SO$_2$ emission traces\nvery well the disk kinematics and we fit the SMA observations using a thin-disk\nKeplerian model, which gives the inclination (47$^{\\circ}$), the inner\n($\\lesssim170$ AU) and outer ($\\sim950-1300$~AU) radii and the disk's rotation\nvelocity (3.4 km s$^{-1}$ at a putative radius of 1700 AU). We roughly estimate\na protostellar dynamical mass of 4-18\\msun. MM2 and WMC cores show,\ncomparatively, an almost empty spectra suggesting that they are associated with\nextended emission detected in previous low-angular resolution observations, and\ntherefore indicating youth (MM2) or the presence of a less massive object\n(WMC).\n", "  We investigate the evolution of cosmological perturbations in models of dark\nenergy described by a time-like unit normalized vector field specified by a\ngeneral function $\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{K})$, so-called Generalized\nEinstein-Aether models. First we study the background dynamics of such models\nvia a designer approach in an attempt to model this theory as dark energy. We\nfind that only one specific form of this designer approach matches $\\Lambda$CDM\nat background order and we also obtain a differential equation which\n$\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{K})$ must satisfy for general $w$CDM cosmologies. We also\npresent the equations of state for perturbations in Generalized Einstein-Aether\nmodels, which completely parametrize these models at the level of linear\nperturbations. A generic feature of modified gravity models is that they\nintroduce new degrees of freedom. By fully eliminating these we are able to\nexpress the gauge invariant entropy perturbation and the scalar, vector, and\ntensor anisotropic stresses in terms of the perturbed fluid variables and\nmetric perturbations only. These can then be used to study the evolution of\nperturbations in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors and we use these to\nevolve the Newtonian gravitational potentials.\n", "  Bolometric luminosity is a basic physical parameter that is widely used in\nthe study of blazars. Due to the lack of simultaneous full wavelength data,\nseveral estimators of the bolometric luminosity are being used in practice. In\nthis paper, we study and evaluate the reliability and significance of six\nestimators, the $5GHz$ luminosity, the 1keV luminosity, the $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity, the $5GHz$ luminosity+the 1keV luminosity, the $5GHz$\nluminosity+the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity and the 1keV luminosity+the $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity, by analyzing the linear correlations between the integrated\nbolometric luminosity and them. Our main results are as follows. (i) All the\nsix estimators are reliable in the sense that they are all significant\ncorrelated with the bolometric luminosity. (ii) Ranking from the higher\nsignificance of the reliability to lower one the six estimators are the the\n$5GHz$ luminosity+the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity, the 1keV luminosity+the\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity, $\\gamma$-ray luminosity, the $5GHz$ luminosity+the\n1keV luminosity, the $5GHz$ luminosity and the 1keV luminosity. (iii) We\nsuggest that the bolometric luminosity can be well estimated by the\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity using the best linear equation that given in this paper\nfor Fermi FSRQs. (iv) According to the linear regressions obtained in the\nanalysis, we provide calibration for each estimator.\n", "  We report results on star clusters located in the South-Eastern half of the\nLarge Magellanic (LMC) bar from Washington $CT_1$ photometry. Using appropriate\nkernel density estimators we detected 73 star cluster candidates, three of\nwhich do not show any detectable trace of star cluster sequences in their\ncolour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We did not detect other 38 previously\ncatalogued clusters, which could not be recognized when visually inspecting the\n$C$ and $T_1$ images either; the distribution of stars in their respective\nfields do not resemble that of an stellar aggregate. They represent $\\sim$ 33\nper cent of all catalogued objects located within the analysed LMC bar field.\nFrom matching theoretical isochrones to the cluster CMDs cleaned from field\nstar contamination, we derived ages in the range 7.2 < log($t$ yr$^{-1}$) <\n10.1. As far as we are aware, this is the first time homogeneous age estimates\nbased on resolved stellar photometry are obtained for most of the studied\nclusters. We built the cluster frequency (CF) for the surveyed area, and found\nthat the major star cluster formation activity has taken place during the\nperiod log($t$ yr$^{-1}$) $\\sim$ 8.0 -- 9.0. Since $\\sim$ 100 Myr ago, clusters\nhave been formed during few bursting formation episodes. When comparing the\nobserved CF to that recovered from the star formation rate we found noticeable\ndifferences, which suggests that field star and star cluster formation\nhistories could have been significantly different.\n", "  Two common approaches of studying theoretically the property of a\nsuperconductor are shown to have significant differences, when they are applied\nto the Larkin-Ovchinnikov state of Weyl metals. In the first approach the\npairing term is restricted by a cutoff energy to the neighborhood of the Fermi\nsurface, whereas in the second approach the pairing term is extended to the\nwhole Brillouin zone. We explore their difference by considering two minimal\nmodels for the Weyl metal. For a model giving a single pair of Weyl pockets,\nboth two approaches give a partly-gapped (fully-gapped) bulk spectrum for small\n(large) pairing amplitude. However, for very small cutoff energy, a portion of\nthe Fermi surface can be completely unaffected by the pairing term in the first\napproach. For the other model giving two pairs of Weyl pockets, while the bulk\nspectrum for the first approach can be fully gapped, the one from the second\napproach has a robust line node, and the surface states are also changed\nqualitatively by the pairing. We elucidate the above differences by topological\narguments and analytical analyses. A factor common to both of the two models is\nthe tilting of the Weyl cones which leads to asymmetric normal state band\nstructure with respect to the Weyl nodes. For the Weyl metal with two pairs of\nWeyl pockets, the band folding leads to a double degeneracy in the effective\nmodel, which distinguishes the pairing of the second approach from all others.\n", "  We study the localization aspects of a kicked non-interacting one-dimensional\n(1D) quantum system subject to either time-periodic or non-periodic pulses.\nThese are reflected as sudden changes of the onsite energies in the lattice\nwith different modulations in real space. When the modulation of the kick is\nincommensurate with the lattice spacing, and the kicks are periodic, a well\nknown dynamical localization in real space is recovered for large kick\namplitudes and frequencies. We explore the universality class of this\ntransition and also test the robustness of localization under deviations from\nthe perfect periodic case. We show that delocalization ultimately sets in and a\ndiffusive spreading of an initial wave packet is obtained when the aperiodicity\nof the driving is introduced.\n", "  We consider a condensate of exciton-polaritons in a diluted magnetic\nsemiconductor microcavity. Such system may exhibit magnetic self-trapping in\nthe case of sufficiently strong coupling between polaritons and magnetic ions\nembedded in the semiconductor. We investigate the effect of the nonequilibrium\nnature of exciton-polaritons on the physics of the resulting self-trapped\nmagnetic polarons. We find that multiple polarons can exist at the same time,\nand derive a critical condition for self-trapping which is different to the one\npredicted previously in the equilibrium case. Using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes\napproximation, we calculate the excitation spectrum and provide a physical\nexplanation in terms of the effective magnetic attraction between polaritons,\nmediated by the ion subsystem.\n", "  A high fraction of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed to\nexist in bodies formed in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies\nin the terrestrial planets region contain nearly none. We study the fate of the\ncarbonaceous material during the spiral-in of matter as the sun accretes matter\nfrom the solar nebula. From observational data on the composition of the dust\ncomponent in comets and interplanetary dust particles, and from data on\npyrolysis experiments, we construct a model for the composition of the pristine\ncarbonaceous material in the outer parts of the solar nebula. We study the\npyrolysis of the refractory and volatile organic component and the concomitant\nrelease of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons under quiescent conditions of\ndisk evolution where matter migrates inwards. We also study the decomposition\nand oxidation of the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events,\nwhich are thought to be responsible for the formation of chondrules. It is\nfound that the complex hydrocarbon components are removed from the solid disk\nmatter at temperatures between 250 and 400 K, while the amorphous carbon\ncomponent survives up to 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during\nflash-heating associated with chondrule formation the carbon abundance of\nterrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be not as low as it is found in\ncosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a process that is\ncrucial for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets.\n", "  In this paper, we study the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking for a\nfour-dimensional massless four-fermion model. Our methodology is based on use\nof the rationalized propagator. We show that a bumblebee potential arises as a\nresult of one-loop calculations and displays nontrivial minima. Also we\ndemonstrate that a phase transition restoring Lorentz invariance can occur at a\nfinite temperature.\n", "  A simple spin-$1/2$ frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFHM) on\nthe square lattice - including chiral plaquette cyclic terms - was argued [Anne\nE.B. Nielsen, German Sierra and J. Ignacio Cirac, Nature Communications $\\bf\n4$, 2864 (2013)] to host a bosonic Kalmeyer-Laughlin (KL) fractional quantum\nHall ground state [V. Kalmeyer and R. B. Laughlin, Phys. Rev. Lett. $\\bf 59$,\n2095 (1987)]. Here, we construct generic families of chiral projected entangled\npair states (chiral PEPS) with low bond dimension ($D=3,4,5$) which, upon\noptimization, provide better variational energies than the KL ansatz. The\noptimal $D=3$ PEPS exhibits chiral edge modes described by the\nWess-Zumino-Witten $SU(2)_1$ model, as expected for the KL spin liquid.\nHowever, we find evidence that, in contrast to the KL state, the PEPS spin\nliquids have power-law dimer-dimer correlations and exhibit a gossamer\nlong-range tail in the spin-spin correlations. We conjecture that these\nfeatures are genuine to local chiral AFHM on bipartite lattices.\n", "  Atomic-scale helices exist as motifs for several material lattices. We\nexamine a tight-binding model for a single one-dimensional monatomic chain with\na p-orbital basis coiled into a helix. A topologically nontrivial phase\nemerging from this model supports a zero-energy mode localized to a boundary,\nalways embedded within a continuum band, regardless of termination site. We\nidentify a topological invariant for this phase that is related to the number\nof zero energy end modes by means of the bulk-boundary correspondence, and give\nstrict conditions for the existence of the bound state. Another,\nnon-topological, gapped edge mode in the model spectrum has practical\nconsequences for surface states in e.g. trigonal tellurium and selenium and\nother van der Waals-bonded one-dimensional semiconductors.\n", "  We report on fixed phase diffusion Monte Carlo calculations that show that,\neven for a large amount of Landau level mixing, the energies of the Pfaffian\nand anti-Pfaffian phases remain very nearly the same, as also do the excitation\ngaps at $1/3$ and $2/3$. These results, combined with previous theoretical and\nexperimental investigations, indicate that particle hole (PH) symmetry for\ncomposite fermion states is much more robust than a priori expected, emerging\neven in models that explicitly break PH symmetry. We provide insight into this\nfact by showing that the low energy physics of a generic repulsive 3-body\ninteraction is captured, to a large extent and over a range of filling factors,\nby a mean field approximation that maps it into a PH symmetric 2-body\ninteraction. This explains why Landau level mixing, which effectively generates\nsuch a generic 3-body interaction, is inefficient in breaking PH symmetry. As a\nbyproduct, our results provide a systematic construction of a 2-body\ninteraction which produces, to a good approximation, the Pfaffian wave function\nas its ground state.\n", "  We derive a closed expression for the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the\nfermionic current density in a (D+1)-dimensional locally AdS spacetime with an\narbitrary number of toroidally compactified Poincare spatial dimensions and in\nthe presence of a constant gauge field. The latter can be formally interpreted\nin terms of a magnetic flux treading the compact dimensions. In the compact\nsubspace, the field operator obeys quasiperiodicity conditions with arbitrary\nphases. The VEV of the charge density is zero and the current density has\nnonzero components along the compact dimensions only. They are periodic\nfunctions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum and\ntend to zero on the AdS boundary. Near the horizon, the effect of the\nbackground gravitational field is small and the leading term in the\ncorresponding asymptotic expansion coincides with the VEV for a massless field\nin the locally Minkowski bulk. Unlike the Minkowskian case, in the system\nconsisting an equal number of fermionic and scalar degrees of freedom, with\nsame masses, charges and phases in the periodicity conditions, the total\ncurrent density does not vanish. In these systems, the leading divergences in\nthe scalar and fermionic contributions on the horizon are canceled and, as a\nconsequence of that, the charge flux, integrated over the coordinate\nperpendicular to the AdS boundary, becomes finite. We show that in odd\nspacetime dimensions the fermionic fields realizing two inequivalent\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra and having equal phases in the\nperiodicity conditions give the same contribution to the VEV of the current\ndensity. Combining the contributions from these fields, the current density in\nodd-dimensional C-,P- and T -symmetric models are obtained. As an application,\nwe consider the ground state current density in curved carbon nanotubes.\n", "  We study fermions in a magnetic field in a finite size cylinder. With the\nboundary condition for the fermion flux, we show that the energy spectra and\nthe wave-functions are modified by the finite size effect; the boundary makes\nthe degenerate Landau levels appear only partially for states with small\nangular momenta, while the boundary effect becomes stronger for states with\nlarge angular momenta. We find that mode accumulation at the boundary occurs\nfor large angular momenta and the magnetic effect is enhanced on the boundary\nsurface. Using a simple fermionic model, we quantify the magnetic catalysis,\ni.e. the magnetic enhancement of the fermion pair condensation, in a finite\nsize cylinder. We confirm that the magnetic catalysis is strongly amplified at\nthe boundary due to the mode accumulation.\n", "  Physics arising from two-dimensional~(2D) Dirac cones has been a topic of\ngreat theoretical and experimental interest to studies of gapless topological\nphases and to simulations of relativistic systems. Such $2$D Dirac cones are\noften characterized by a $\\pi$ Berry phase and are destroyed by a perturbative\nmass term. By considering mean-field nonlinearity in a minimal two-band Chern\ninsulator model, we obtain a novel type of Dirac cones that are robust to local\nperturbations without symmetry restrictions. Due to a different pseudo-spin\ntexture, the Berry phase of the Dirac cone is no longer quantized in $\\pi$, and\ncan be continuously tuned as an order parameter. Furthermore, in an\nAharonov-Bohm~(AB) interference setup to detect such Dirac cones, the adiabatic\nAB phase is found to be $\\pi$ both theoretically and computationally, offering\nan observable topological invariant and a fascinating example where the Berry\nphase and AB phase are fundamentally different. We hence discover a\nnonlinearity-induced quantum phase transition from a known topological\ninsulating phase to an unusual gapless topological phase.\n", "  We use a perturbative approach to study the effects of interfacial spin-orbit\ncoupling in magnetic multilayers by treating the two-dimensional Rashba model\nin a fully three-dimensional description of electron transport near an\ninterface. This formalism provides a compact analytic expression for\ncurrent-induced spin-orbit torques in terms of unperturbed scattering\ncoefficients, allowing computation of spin-orbit torques for various contexts,\nby simply substituting scattering coefficients into the formulas. It applies to\ncalculations of spin-orbit torques for magnetic bilayers with bulk magnetism,\nthose with interface magnetism, a normal metal/ferromagnetic insulator\njunction, and a topological insulator/ferromagnet junction. It predicts a\ndampinglike component of spin-orbit torque that is distinct from any intrinsic\ncontribution or those that arise from particular spin relaxation mechanisms. We\ndiscuss the effects of proximity-induced magnetism and insertion of an\nadditional layer and provide formulas for in-plane current, which is induced by\na perpendicular bias, anisotropic magnetoresistance, and spin memory loss in\nthe same formalism.\n", "  The kinematics of the plasma in 14 PNe is analysed by measuring the expansion\nvelocities (V$_{exp}$) of different ions as derived from their collisionally\nexcited lines (CELs) and optical recombination lines (ORLs). V$_{exp}$ are\nanalysed as a function of the ionisation potential of ions that at first\napproximation represents the distance of the ion to the central star. In most\ncases the kinematics of ORLs is incompatible with the kinematics of CELs at the\nsame ionisation potential, specially if CELs and ORLs of the same ion are\nconsidered. In general V$_{exp}$ from ORLs is lower than V$_{exp}$ from CELs\nindicating that, if the gas is in ionisation equilibrium, ORLs are emitted by a\ngas located closer to the central star. The velocity field derived from CELs\nshows a gradient accelerating outwards as predicted from hydrodynamic modelling\nof PNe ionisation structures. The velocity field derived from ORLs is\ndifferent, in many cases the velocity gradient is flatter or nonexistent and\nhigh and low ionised species present nearly the same V$_{exp}$. In addition,\nthe FWHM(ORLs) is usually smaller that the FWHM(CELs). Our interpretation is\nthat ORLs are mainly emitted by a plasma that coexists with the plasma emitting\nCELs, but does not fit the ionisation structures predicted by models. Such a\nplasma should have been ejected in a different event that the plasma emitting\nCELs.\n", "  We study the drag force on dust grains moving at relativistic velocities\nthrough interstellar gas and explore its application. First, we derive a new\nanalytical formula of the drag force at high energies and find that it is\nsignificantly reduced compared to the classical model. Second, we apply the\nobtained drag force to calculate the terminal velocities of interstellar grains\nby strong radiation sources such as supernovae and active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs). We find that grains can be accelerated to relativistic velocities by\nvery luminous AGNs. We then quantify the deceleration of relativistic\nspacecraft proposed by the Breakthrough Starshot initiative due to gas drag on\na relativistic lightsail. We find that the spacecraft's slowing down is\nnegligible because of the suppression of gas drag at relativistic velocities,\nsuggesting that the lightsail may be open for communication during its journey\nto $\\alpha$ Centauri without causing a considerable delay. Finally, we show\nthat the damage to relativistic thin lightsails by interstellar dust is a minor\neffect.\n", "  General relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of accretion\ndisks and jets associated with supermassive black holes show variability on a\nwide range of timescales. On timescales comparable to or longer than the\ngravitational timescale $t_G=GM/c^3$, variation may be dominated by orbital\ndynamics of the inhomogeneous accretion flow. Turbulent evolution within the\naccretion disk is expected on timescales comparable to the orbital period,\ntypically an order of magnitude larger than $t_G$. For Sgr A*, $t_G$ is much\nshorter than the typical duration of a VLBI experiment, enabling us to study\nthis variability within a single observation. Closure phases, the sum of\ninterferometric visibility phases on a triangle of baselines, are particularly\nuseful for studying this variability. In addition to a changing source\nstructure, variations in observed closure phase can also be due to interstellar\nscattering, thermal noise, and the changing geometry of projected baselines\nover time due to Earth rotation. We present a metric that is able to\ndistinguish the latter two from intrinsic or scattering variability. This\nmetric is validated using synthetic observations of GRMHD simulations of Sgr\nA*. When applied to existing multi-epoch EHT data of Sgr A*, this metric shows\nthat the data are most consistent with source models containing intrinsic\nvariability from source dynamics, interstellar scattering, or a combination of\nthose. The effects of black hole inclination, orientation, spin, and morphology\n(disk or jet) on the expected closure phase variability are also discussed.\n", "  The assembly of the Milky Way bulge is an old topic in astronomy, one now in\na period of renewed and rapid development. The dominant scenario for bulge\nformation is that of the Milky Way as a nearly pure disk galaxy, with the inner\ndisk having formed a bar and buckled. This can potentially explain virtually\nall bulge stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, comprising 95% of the stellar population.\nThe evidence is the incredible success in N-body models of this type in making\nmeaningful predictions, such as the rotation curve and velocity dispersion\nmeasured from radial velocities, and the spatial morphologies of the\npeanut/X-shape and the long bar. The classical bulge scenario remains viable\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and potentially a minority of the other stars. A\nclassical bulge is expected from Lambda-CDM cosmological simulations, can\naccentuate the properties of an existing bar in a hybrid system, and is most\nconsistent with the bulge abundance trends such as [Mg/Fe], which are elevated\nrelative to both the thin and thick disks. Finally, the clumpy-galaxy scenario\nis considered, as it is the correct description of most Milky Way precursors\ngiven observations of high-redshift galaxies. Simulations predict that these\nstar-forming clumps will sometimes migrate to the centres of galaxies where\nthey may form a bulge, and galaxies often include a bulge clump as well. They\nwill possibly form a bar with properties consistent with those of the Milky\nWay, such as the exponential profile and metallicity gradient. Given the\nrelative successes of these scenarios, the Milky Way bulge is plausibly of\ncomposite origin, with a classical bulge and/or inner halo numerically dominant\nfor stars with [Fe/H] <~ -1.0, a buckling thick disk for stars with -1.0 <~\n[Fe/H] <~ -0.50 perhaps descended from the clumpy galaxy phase, and a buckling\nthin disk for stars with [Fe/H] >~ -0.50.\n", "  For the problem of molecular solvation, formulated as a liquid submitted to\nthe external potential field created by a molecular solute of arbitrary shape\ndissolved in that solvent, we draw a connection between the Gaussian field\ntheory derived by David Chandler [Phys. Rev. E, 1993, 48, 2898] and classical\ndensity functional theory. We show that Chandler's results concerning the\nsolvation of a hard core of arbitrary shape can be recovered by either\nminimising a linearised HNC functional using an auxiliary Lagrange multiplier\nfield to impose a vanishing density inside the core, or by minimising this\nfunctional directly outside the core --- indeed a simpler procedure. Those\nequivalent approaches are compared to two other variants of DFT, either in the\nHNC, or partially linearised HNC approximation, for the solvation of a\nLennard-Jones solute of increasing size in a Lennard-Jones solvent. Compared to\nMonte-Carlo simulations, all those theories give acceptable results for the\ninhomogeneous solvent structure, but are completely out-of-range for the\nsolvation free-energies. This can be fixed in DFT by adding a hard-sphere\nbridge correction to the HNC functional.\n", "  In quantum secret sharing protocols, the usual presumption is that the\ndistribution of quantum shares and players' collaboration are both performed\ninertially. Here we develop a quantum secret sharing protocol that relaxes\nthese assumptions wherein we consider the effects due to the accelerating\nmotion of the shares. Specifically, we solve the (2,3)-threshold\ncontinuous-variable quantum secret sharing in non-inertial frames. To this aim,\nwe formulate the effect of relativistic motion on the quantum field inside a\ncavity as a bosonic quantum Gaussian channel. We investigate how the fidelity\nof quantum secret sharing is affected by non-uniform motion of the quantum\nshares. Furthermore, we fully characterize the canonical form of the Gaussian\nchannel which can be utilized in quantum information processing protocols to\ninclude relativistic effects.\n", "  The dynamical evolution of self-interacting scalars is of paramount\nimportance in cosmological settings, and can teach us about the content of\nEinstein's equations. In flat space, nonlinear scalar field theories can give\nrise to localized, non-singular, time-dependent, long-lived solutions called\n{\\it oscillons}. Here, we discuss the effects of gravity on the properties and\nformation of these structures, described by a scalar field with a double well\npotential. We show that oscillons continue to exist even when gravity is turned\non, and we conjecture that there exists a sequence of critical solutions with\ninfinite lifetime. Our results suggest that a new type of critical behavior\nappears in this theory, characterized by modulations of the lifetime of the\noscillon around the scaling law and the modulations of the amplitude of the\ncritical solutions.\n", "  Recent high-resolution and high-cadence EUV imaging has revealed a new\nphenomenon, impacting prominence debris, where prominence material from failed\nor partial eruptions can impact the lower atmosphere, releasing energy. We\nreport a clear example of energy release and EUV brightening due to infalling\nprominence debris that occurred on 2011 September 7-8. The initial eruption of\nmaterial was associated with an X1.8-class flare from AR11283, occurring at\n22:30 UT on 2011 September 7. Subsequently, a semi-continuous stream of this\nmaterial returned to the solar surface with a velocity v > 150 km/s, impacting\na region remote from the original active region between 00:20 - 00:40 UT on\n2011 September 8. Using SDO/AIA, the differential emission measure of the\nplasma was estimated throughout this brightening event. We found that the\nradiated energy of the impacted plasma was L_rad ~10^27 ergs, while the thermal\nenergy peaked at ~10^28 ergs. From this we were able to determine the mass\ncontent of the debris to be in the range 2x10^14 < m < 2x10^15 g. Given typical\npromimence masses, the likely debris mass is towards the lower end of this\nrange. This clear example of a prominence debris event shows that significant\nenergy release takes place during these events, and that such impacts may be\nused as a novel diagnostic tool for investigating prominence material\nproperties.\n", "  We study the cooperative optical coupling between regularly spaced atoms in a\none-dimensional waveguide using decompositions to subradiant and superradiant\ncollective excitation eigenmodes, direct numerical solutions, and analytical\ntransfer-matrix methods. We illustrate how the spectrum of transmitted light\nthrough the waveguide including the emergence of narrow Fano resonances can be\nunderstood by the resonance features of the eigenmodes. We describe a method\nbased on superradiant and subradiant modes to engineer the optical response of\nthe waveguide and to store light. The stopping of light is obtained by\ntransferring an atomic excitation to a subradiant collective mode with the zero\nradiative resonance linewidth by controlling the level shift of an atom in the\nwaveguide. Moreover, we obtain an exact analytic solution for the transmitted\nlight through the waveguide for the case of a regular lattice of atoms and\nprovide a simple description how the light transmission may present large\nresonance shifts when the lattice spacing is close, but not exactly equal, to\nhalf of the wavelength of the light. Experimental imperfections such as\nfluctuations of the positions of the atoms and loss of light from the waveguide\nare easily quantified in the numerical simulations, which produce the natural\nresult that the optical response of the atomic array tends toward the response\nof a gas with random atomic positions.\n", "  Relativistic ultracompact objects without an event horizon may be able to\nform in nature and merge as binary systems, mimicking the coalescence of\nordinary black holes. The postmerger phase of such processes presents\ncharacteristic signatures, which appear as repeated pulses within the emitted\ngravitational waveform, i.e., echoes with variable amplitudes and frequencies.\nFuture detections of these signals can shed new light on the existence of\nhorizonless geometries, and provide new information on the nature of gravity in\na genuine strong-field regime. In this work we analyze phenomenological\ntemplates used to characterize echolike structures produced by exotic compact\nobjects, and we investigate for the first time the ability of current and\nfuture interferometers to constrain their parameters. Using different models\nwith an increasing level of accuracy, we determine the features that can be\nmeasured with the largest precision, and we span the parameter space to find\nthe most favorable configurations to be detected. Our analysis shows that\ncurrent detectors may already be able to extract all the parameters of the\nechoes with good accuracy, and that multiple interferometers can measure\nfrequencies and damping factors of the signals at the level of percent.\n", "  We present deep observations of the field of the magnetar CXOJ164710.2-455216\nin the star cluster Westerlund 1, obtained in the near-infrared with the\nadaptive optics camera NACO@VLT. We detected a possible candidate counterpart\nat the {\\em Chandra} position of the magnetar, of magnitudes $\\mathrm{J} = 23.5\n\\pm 0.2$, $\\mathrm{H} = 21.0 \\pm 0.1$, and $\\mathrm{K}_\\mathrm{S} = 20.4 \\pm\n0.1$. The K$_{\\rm S}$-band measurements available for two epochs (2006 and\n2013) do not show significant signs of variability but only a marginal\nindication that the flux varied (at the 2 $\\sigma$ level), consistent with the\nfact that the observations were taken when CXOJ164710.2-455216 was in\nquiescence. At the same time, we also present colour--magnitude and\ncolour--colour diagrams in the J, H, and K$_{\\rm S}$ bands from the 2006 epoch\nonly, the only one with observations in all three bands, showing that the\ncandidate counterpart lies in the main bulk of objects describing a relatively\nwell--defined sequence. Therefore, based on its colours and lack of\nvariability, we cannot yet associate the candidate counterpart to\nCXOJ164710.2-455216. Future near-infrared observations of the field,\nfollowing-up a source outburst, would be crucial to confirm the association\nfrom the detection of near-infrared variability and colour evolution.\n", "  We study spherically symmetric geometries made of anisotropic perfect fluid\nbased on general relativity. The purpose of the work is to find and classify\nblack hole solutions in closed spacetime. In a general setting, we find that a\nstatic and closed space exists only when the radial pressure is negative but\nits size is smaller than the density. The Einstein equation is eventually\ncasted into a first order autonomous equation on two-dimensional plane of\nscale-invariant variables, which are equivalent to the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation in general relativity. Then, we\ndisplay various solution curves numerically. An exact solution describing a\nblack hole solution in a closed spacetime was known in Ref. [1], which solution\nbears a naked singularity and negative energy era. We find that the two\ndeficits can be remedied when $\\rho+3p_1>0$ and $\\rho+p_1+2p_2< 0$, where the\nsecond violates the strong energy condition.\n", "  We present a Monte Carlo simulation designed to predict the vertical velocity\ndispersion of brown dwarfs in the Milky Way. We show that since these stars are\nconstantly cooling, the velocity dispersion has a noticeable trend with\nspectral type. With realistic assumptions for the initial-mass function,\nstar-formation history, and the cooling models, we show that the velocity\ndispersion is roughly consistent with what is observed for M dwarfs, decreases\nto cooler spectral types, and increases again for the coolest types in our\nstudy ($\\sim$T9). We predict a minimum in the velocity dispersions for L/T\ntransition objects, however the detailed properties of the minimum\npredominately depend on the star-formation history. Since this trend is due to\nbrown dwarf cooling, we expect the velocity dispersion as a function of\nspectral type should deviate from constancy around the hydrogen-burning limit.\nWe convert from velocity dispersion to vertical scale height using standard\ndisk models, and present similar trends in disk thickness as a function of\nspectral type. We suggest that future, wide-field photometric and/or\nspectroscopic missions may collect sizable samples of distant ($\\sim\\!1$ kpc)\nof dwarfs that span the hydrogen-burning limit. As such, we speculate that such\nobservations may provide a unique way of constraining the average spectral type\nof hydrogen-burning.\n", "  Using a data sample of $448\\times10^{6}$ $\\psi(3686)$ events collected with\nthe BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, the decays\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta$ and $\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\pi^{0}$ are\nobserved with a statistical significance of $7.3\\sigma$ and $ 6.7\\sigma$,\nrespectively. The branching fractions are measured to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta)=(0.85\\pm0.18\\pm0.05)\\times10^{-6}$\nand\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\pi^{0})=(0.95\\pm0.16\\pm0.05)\\times10^{-6}$.\nIn addition, we measure the branching fraction of\n$\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta'$ to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\psi(3686)\\rightarrow\\gamma\\eta')=(125.1\\pm2.2\\pm6.2)\\times\n10^{-6}$, with improved precision compared to previous results.\n", "  We revisit the problem of the surface superconductivity nucleation focusing\non the detailed study of the critical field $H_{c3}$ as a function of\ntemperature and disorder. Using the semiclassical Eilenberger formalism we find\nthat away from the Ginzburg-Landau region the ratio between the nucleation\ncritical field $H_{c3}$ and the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ deviates strongly\nfrom the Saint-James-de Gennes limit. In particular, the $H_{c3}/H_{c2}$ is\nfound to be a nonmonotonic function of temperature, which reaches the maximum\nfor a set of parameters corresponding to a crossover region from ballistic to\ndiffusive scattering, when the mean free path in a bulk of a superconductor is\nof the same order as zero-temperature superconducting coherence length. We also\nanalyze the robustness of the nucleated phases with respect to diffusive\nscattering off the sample boundary by solving exactly corresponding eigenvalue\nproblem of an integral equation for the critical field. The implications of\nthese results for the transport in superconductors of various geometries near\n$H_{c3}$ are briefly discussed. In particular, we present results for the\nmechanism of magnetoconductivity oscillations due to surface superconductivity\neffects.\n", "  I investigate whether it is possible to reconcile the recent ALFALFA\nobservation that the neutral hydrogen (HI) mass function (HIMF) across\ndifferent galactic densities has the same, non-flat, faint-end slope, with the\nobservations of isolated galaxies and many galaxy groups that show their HIMFs\nto have flat faint-end slopes. I find that a fairly simple model in which the\nposition of the knee in the mass function of each individual group is allowed\nto vary is able to account for both of these observations. If this model\nreflects reality, the ALFALFA result points to an interesting `conspiracy'\nwhereby the differing group HIMFs always sum up to form global HIMFs with the\nsame faint-end slope in different environments. More generally, this result\nimplies that global environmental HIMFs do not necessarily reflect the HIMFs in\nindividual groups belonging to that environment, and cannot be used to directly\nmeasure variations in group-specific HIMFs with environment.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations of a temporally-developing, low-speed,\nvariable-density, turbulent, plane mixing layer are performed. The\nNavier-Stokes equations in the low-Mach number approximation are solved using a\nnovel algorithm based on an extended version of the velocity-vorticity\nformulation used by Kim et al. (1987) for incompressible flows. Four cases with\ndensity ratios $s=1, 2, 4$ and 8 are considered. The simulations are run with a\nPrandtl number of 0.7 and achieve a $Re_\\lambda$ up to 150 during the\nself-similar evolution of the mixing layer. It is found that the growth rate of\nthe mixing layer decreases with increasing density ratio, in agreement with\ntheoretical models of this phenomenon. Comparison with high-speed data shows\nthat the reduction of the growth rates with increasing the density ratio has a\nweak dependence with the Mach number. In addition, the shifting of the mixing\nlayer to the low-density stream has been characterized by analyzing one point\nstatistics within the self-similar interval. This shifting has been quantified,\nand related to the growth rate of the mixing layer under the assumption that\nthe shape of the mean velocity and density profiles do not change with the\ndensity ratio. This leads to a predictive model for the reduction of the growth\nrate of the momentum thickness, which agrees reasonably well with the available\ndata. Finally, the effect of the density ratio on the turbulent structure has\nbeen analyzed using flow visualizations and spectra. It is found that with\nincreasing density ratio the longest scales in the high density side are\ngradually inhibited. A gradual reduction of the energy in small scales with\nincreasing density ratio is also observed.\n", "  Based on an extensive spectral study of a photometrically confirmed sample of\nMira variables, we find a relationship between relative Balmer emission-line\nstrength and spectral temperature of O-rich Mira stars. The $F_{\\rm\nH\\delta}/F_{\\rm H\\gamma}$ flux ratio increases from less than unity to five as\nstars cool down from M0 to M10, which is likely driven by increasing TiO\nabsorption above the deepest shock-emitting regions. We also discuss the\nrelationship between the equivalent widths of the Balmer emission lines and the\nphotometric luminosity phase of our Mira sample stars. Using our 291 Mira\nspectra as templates for reference, 191 Mira candidates are newly identified\nfrom the LAMOST DR4 catalog. We summarize the criteria adopted to select Mira\ncandidates based on emission-line indices and molecular absorption bands. This\nenlarged spectral sample of Mira variables has the potential to contribute\nsignificantly to our knowledge of the optical properties of Mira stars and will\nfacilitate further studies of these late-type, long-period variables.\n", "  A search for the progenitor of SN~2010jl, an unusually luminous core-collapse\nsupernova of Type~IIn, using pre-explosion {\\it Hubble}/WFPC2 and {\\it\nSpitzer}/IRAC images of the region, yielded upper limits on the UV and\nnear-infrared (IR) fluxes from any candidate star. These upper limits constrain\nthe luminosity and effective temperature of the progenitor, the mass of any\npreexisting dust in its surrounding circumstellar medium (CSM), and dust\nproximity to the star. A {\\it lower} limit on the CSM dust mass is required to\nhide a luminous progenitor from detection by {\\it Hubble}. {\\it Upper} limits\non the CSM dust mass and constraints on its proximity to the star are set by\nrequiring that the absorbed and reradiated IR emission not exceed the IRAC\nupper limits. Using the combined extinction-IR emission constraints we present\nviable $M_d-R_1$ combinations, where $M_d$ and $R_1$ are the CSM dust mass and\nits inner radius. These depend on the CSM outer radius, dust composition and\ngrain size, and the properties of the progenitor. The results constrain the\npre-supernova evolution of the progenitor, and the nature and origin of the\nobserved post-explosion IR emission from SN~2010jl. In particular, an\n$\\eta$~Car-type progenitor will require at least 4~mag of visual extinction to\navoid detection by the {\\it Hubble}. This can be achieved with dust masses\n$\\gtrsim 10^{-3}$~\\msun\\ (less than the estimated 0.2-0.5~\\msun\\ around\n$\\eta$~Car) which must be located at distances of $\\gtrsim 10^{16}$~cm from the\nstar to avoid detection by {\\it Spitzer}.\n", "  A cold high-velocity (HV, $\\sim$ 200 km/s) peak was first reported in several\nGalactic bulge fields based on the APOGEE commissioning observations. Both the\nexistence and the nature of the high-velocity peak are still under debate. Here\nwe revisit this feature with the latest APOGEE DR13 data. We find that most of\nthe low latitude bulge fields display a skewed Gaussian distribution with a HV\nshoulder. However, only 3 out of 53 fields show distinct high-velocity peaks\naround 200 km/s. The velocity distribution can be well described by\nGauss-Hermite polynomials, except the three fields showing clear HV peaks. We\nfind that the correlation between the skewness parameter ($h_{3}$) and the mean\nvelocity ($\\bar{v}$), instead of a distinctive HV peak, is a strong indicator\nof the bar. It was recently suggested that the HV peak is composed of\npreferentially young stars. We choose three fields showing clear HV peaks to\ntest this hypothesis using the metallicity, [$\\alpha$/M] and [C/N] as age\nproxies. We find that both young and old stars show HV features. The similarity\nbetween the chemical abundances of stars in the HV peaks and the main component\nindicates that they are not systematically different in terms of chemical\nabundance or age. In contrast, there are clear differences in chemical space\nbetween stars in the Sagittarius dwarf and the bulge stars. The strong HV peaks\noff-plane are still to be explained properly, and could be different in nature.\n", "  There is a subclass of the X-ray jets from young stellar objects which are\nheated very close to the footpoint of the jets, particularly DG Tau jets.\nPrevious models attribute the strong heating to shocks in the jets. However,\nthe mechanism that localizes the heating at the footpoint remains puzzling. We\npresented a different model of such X-ray jets, in which the disk atmosphere is\nmagnetically heated. Our disk corona model is based on the so-called nanoflare\nmodel for the solar corona. We show that the magnetic heating near the disks\ncan result in the formation of a hot corona with a temperature of > 10^6 K even\nif the average field strength in the disk is moderately weak, > 1 G. We\ndetermine the density and the temperature at the jet base by considering the\nenergy balance between the heating and cooling. We derive the scaling relations\nof the mass loss rate and terminal velocity of jets. Our model is applied to\nthe DG Tau jets. The observed temperature and estimated mass loss rate are\nconsistent with the prediction of our model in the case of the disk magnetic\nfield strength of ~20 G and the heating region of < 0.1 au. The derived scaling\nrelation of the temperature of X-ray jets could be a useful tool to estimate\nthe magnetic field strength. We also found that the jet X-ray can have a\nsignificant impact on the ionization degree near the disk surface and the\ndead-zone size.\n", "  We study the dynamics of opinion formation in a heterogeneous voter model on\na complete graph, in which each agent is endowed with an integer fitness\nparameter $k \\ge 0$, in addition to its $+$ or $-$ opinion state. The evolution\nof the distribution of $k$--values and the opinion dynamics are coupled\ntogether, so as to allow the system to dynamically develop heterogeneity and\nmemory in a simple way. When two agents with different opinions interact, their\n$k$--values are compared and, with probability $p$ the agent with the lower\nvalue adopts the opinion of the one with the higher value, while with\nprobability $1-p$ the opposite happens. The winning agent then increments its\n$k$--value by one. We study the dynamics of the system in the entire $0 \\le p\n\\le 1$ range and compare with the case $p=1/2$, which corresponds to the\nstandard voter model. When $0 \\le p < 1/2$, the system approaches exponentially\nfast to the consensus state of the initial majority opinion. The mean consensus\ntime $\\tau$ grows logarithmically with the number of agents $N$, and it is\ngreatly decreased relative to the linear behaviour $\\tau \\sim N$ found in the\nvoter model. When $1/2 < p \\le 1$, the system initially relaxes to a state with\nan even coexistence of opinions, but eventually reaches consensus by\nfinite-size fluctuations. The approach to coexistence is monotonic for $1/2 < p\n< 0.8$, while for $0.8 \\le p \\le 1$ there are damped oscillations around the\ncoexistence value. The final approach to coexistence is approximately a power\nlaw $t^{-b(p)}$ in both regimes, where $b$ increases with $p$. Also, $\\tau$\nincreases respect to the voter model, although it still scales linearly with\n$N$. The $p=1$ case is special, with a relaxation to coexistence that scales as\n$t^{-2.73}$ and a consensus time that scales as $\\tau \\sim N^\\beta$, with\n$\\beta \\simeq 1.45$.\n", "  We perform particle-in-cell simulations of perpendicular nonrelativistic\ncollisionless shocks to study electron heating and pre-acceleration for\nparameters that permit extrapolation to the conditions at young supernova\nremnants. Our high-resolution large-scale numerical experiments sample a\nrepresentative portion of the shock surface and demonstrate that the efficiency\nof electron injection is strongly modulated with the phase of the shock\nreformation. For plasmas with low and moderate temperature (plasma beta\n$\\beta_{\\rm p}=5\\cdot 10^{-4}$ and $\\beta_{\\rm p}=0.5$), we explore the\nnonlinear shock structure and electron pre-acceleration for various\norientations of the large-scale magnetic field with respect to the simulation\nplane while keeping it at $90^\\circ$ to the shock normal. Ion reflection off\nthe shock leads to the formation of magnetic filaments in the shock ramp,\nresulting from Weibel-type instabilities, and electrostatic Buneman modes in\nthe shock foot. In all cases under study, the latter provides first-stage\nelectron energization through the shock-surfing acceleration (SSA) mechanism.\nThe subsequent energization strongly depends on the field orientation and\nproceeds through adiabatic or second-order Fermi acceleration processes for\nconfigurations with the out-of-plane and in-plane field components,\nrespectively. For strictly out-of-plane field the fraction of supra-thermal\nelectrons is much higher than for other configurations, because only in this\ncase the Buneman modes are fully captured by the 2D simulation grid. Shocks in\nplasma with moderate $\\beta_{\\rm p}$ provide more efficient pre-acceleration.\nThe relevance of our results to the physics of fully three-dimensional systems\nis discussed.\n", "  Context: Transmission spectroscopy has become a prominent tool for\ncharacterizing the atmospheric properties on close-in transiting planets.\nRecent observations have revealed a remarkable diversity in exoplanet spectra,\nwhich show absorption signatures of Na, K and $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, in some cases\npartially or fully attenuated by atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols (clouds and\nhazes) themselves have been detected in the transmission spectra of several\nplanets thanks to wavelength-dependent slopes caused by the particles'\nscattering properties. Aims: We present an optical 550 - 960 nm transmission\nspectrum of the extremely irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-103b, one of the hottest\n(2500 K) and most massive (1.5 $M_J$) planets yet to be studied with this\ntechnique. WASP-103b orbits its star at a separation of less than 1.2 times the\nRoche limit and is predicted to be strongly tidally distorted. Methods: We have\nused Gemini/GMOS to obtain multi-object spectroscopy hroughout three transits\nof WASP-103b. We used relative spectrophotometry and bin sizes between 20 and 2\nnm to infer the planet's transmission spectrum. Results: We find that WASP-103b\nshows increased absorption in the cores of the alkali (Na, K) line features. We\ndo not confirm the presence of any strong scattering slope as previously\nsuggested, pointing towards a clear atmosphere for the highly irradiated,\nmassive exoplanet WASP-103b. We constrain the upper boundary of any potential\ncloud deck to reside at pressure levels above 0.01 bar. This finding is in line\nwith previous studies on cloud occurrence on exoplanets which find that clouds\ndominate the transmission spectra of cool, low surface gravity planets while\nhot, high surface gravity planets are either cloud-free, or possess clouds\nlocated below the altitudes probed by transmission spectra.\n", "  We present techniques developed to calibrate and correct Murchison Widefield\nArray (MWA) low frequency (72-300 MHz) radio observations for polarimetry. The\nextremely wide field-of-view, excellent instantaneous (u, v)-coverage and\nsensitivity to degree-scale structure that the MWA provides enable instrumental\ncalibration, removal of instrumental artefacts, and correction for ionospheric\nFaraday rotation through imaging techniques. With the demonstrated polarimetric\ncapabilities of the MWA, we discuss future directions for polarimetric science\nat low frequencies to answer outstanding questions relating to polarised source\ncounts, source depolarisation, pulsar science, low-mass stars, exoplanets, the\nnature of the interstellar and intergalactic media, and the solar environment.\n", "  We report constraints on the global $21$ cm signal due to neutral hydrogen at\nredshifts $14.8 \\geq z \\geq 6.5$. We derive our constraints from low foreground\nobservations of the average sky brightness spectrum conducted with the EDGES\nHigh-Band instrument between September $7$ and October $26$, $2015$.\nObservations were calibrated by accounting for the effects of antenna beam\nchromaticity, antenna and ground losses, signal reflections, and receiver\nparameters. We evaluate the consistency between the spectrum and\nphenomenological models for the global $21$ cm signal. For tanh-based\nrepresentations of the ionization history during the epoch of reionization, we\nrule out, at $\\geq2\\sigma$ significance, models with duration of up to $\\Delta\nz = 1$ at $z\\approx8.5$ and higher than $\\Delta z = 0.4$ across most of the\nobserved redshift range under the usual assumption that the $21$ cm spin\ntemperature is much larger than the temperature of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) during reionization. We also investigate a `cold' IGM scenario\nthat assumes perfect Ly$\\alpha$ coupling of the $21$ cm spin temperature to the\ntemperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), but that the IGM is not heated\nby early stars or stellar remants. Under this assumption, we reject tanh-based\nreionization models of duration $\\Delta z \\lesssim 2$ over most of the observed\nredshift range. Finally, we explore and reject a broad range of Gaussian models\nfor the $21$ cm absorption feature expected in the First Light era. As an\nexample, we reject $100$ mK Gaussians with duration (full width at half\nmaximum) $\\Delta z \\leq 4$ over the range $14.2\\geq z\\geq 6.5$ at $\\geq2\\sigma$\nsignificance.\n", "  Recent reports claiming association of the massive star binary system\n$\\gamma^2 $Velorum (WR 11) with a high-energy $\\gamma$-ray source observed by\n\\textit{Fermi}-LAT contrast the so-far exclusive role of $\\eta$ Carinae as the\nhitherto only detected $\\gamma$-ray emitter in the source class of\nparticle-accelerating colliding-wind binary (CWB) systems. We offer support to\nthis claim of association by providing dedicated model predictions for the\nnonthermal photon emission spectrum of $\\gamma^2$ Velorum.\n  We use three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic modeling (MHD) to investigate\nthe structure and conditions of the wind-collision region (WCR) of $\\gamma^2$\nVelorum including the important effect of radiative braking in the stellar\nwinds. A transport equation is then solved throughout the computational domain\nto study the propagation of relativistic electrons and protons. The resulting\ndistributions of particles are subsequently used to compute nonthermal photon\nemission components.\n  In agreement with observation in X-ray spectroscopy, our simulations yield a\nlarge shock-cone opening angle. We find the nonthermal $\\gamma$-ray emission of\n$\\gamma^2$ Velorum to be of hadronic origin owing to the strong radiation\nfields in the binary system which inhibit the acceleration of electrons to\nenergies sufficiently high for efficient inverse Compton radiation. We also\ndiscuss the strong dependence of a hadronic $\\gamma$-ray component on the\nenergy-dependent diffusion used in the simulations. Of two mass-loss rates for\nthe WR star found in literature, only the higher one is able to accommodate the\nobserved $\\gamma$-ray spectrum with reasonable values for important simulation\nparameters such as the injection ratio of high-energy particles within the WCR.\n", "  Precision calculations of the fine and hyperfine structure of muonic atoms\nare performed in a relativistic approach and results for muonic 205 Bi, 147 Sm,\nand 89 Zr are presented. The hyperfine structure due to magnetic dipole and\nelectric quadrupole splitting is calculated in first order perturbation theory,\nusing extended nuclear charge and current distributions. The leading correction\nfrom quantum electrodynamics, namely vacuum polarization in Uehling\napproximation, is included as a potential directly in the Dirac equation. Also,\nan effective screening potential due to the surrounding electrons is\ncalculated, and the leading relativistic recoil correction is estimated.\n", "  Time correlation functions in the Lebwohl-Lasher model of nematic liquid\ncrystals are studied using theory and molecular dynamics simulations. In\nparticular, the autocorrelation functions of angular momentum and nematic\ndirector fluctuations are calculated in the long-wavelength limit. The\nconstitutive relations for the hydrodynamic currents are derived using a\nstandard procedure based on non-negativity of the entropy production. The\ncontinuity equations are then linearized and solved to calculate the\ncorrelation functions. We find that the transverse angular momentum\nfluctuations are coupled to the director fluctuations, and are both\npropagative. The propagative nature of the fluctuations suppress the\nanticipated hydrodynamic long-time tails in the single-particle autocorrelation\nfunctions. The fluctuations in the isotropic phase are however diffusive,\nleading to $t^{-d/2}$ long-time tails in $d$ spatial dimensions. The Frank\nelastic constant measured using the time-correlation functions are in good\nagreement with previously reported results.\n", "  We study the young S-stars within a distance of 0.04 pc from the supermassive\nblack hole in the center of our Galaxy. Given how inhospitable the region is\nfor star formation, their presence is more puzzling the younger we estimate\ntheir ages. In this study, we analyse the result of 12 years of high resolution\nspectroscopy within the central arcsecond of the Galactic Center (GC). By\nco-adding between 55 and 105 hours of spectra we have obtained high signal to\nnoise H- and K-band spectra of eight stars orbiting the central supermassive\nblack hole. Using deep H-band spectra, we show that these stars must be high\nsurface gravity (dwarf) stars. We compare these deep spectra to detailed model\natmospheres and stellar evolution models to infer the stellar parameters. Our\nanalysis reveals an effective temperature of 21000-28500 K, a rotational\nvelocity of 60-170 km/s, and a surface gravity of 4.1-4.2. These parameters\nimply a spectral type of B0-B3V for these stars. The inferred masses lie within\n8-14 Msun. We derive an age of 6.6^{+3.4}{-4.7} Myr for the star S2, which is\ncompatible with the age of the clockwise rotating young stellar disk in the GC.\nWe estimate the age of all other studied S-stars to be less than 15 Myr, which\nare compatible with the age of S2 within the uncertainties. The relatively low\nages for these S-stars favor a scenario in which the stars formed in a local\ndisk rather than the field-binary-disruption scenario throughout a longer\nperiod of time.\n", "  With the aim of assessing if low surface brightness galaxies host stellar\nbars, and study the dependence of the occurrence of bars as a function of\nsurface brightness, we use the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset to construct a large\nvolume-limited sample of galaxies, and segregate the galaxies as low and high\nsurface brightness in terms of their central surface brightness. We find that\nthe fraction of low surface brightness galaxies hosting strong bars is\nsystematically lower than the one found for high surface brightness galaxies.\nThe dependence of the bar fraction on the central surface brightness is mostly\ndriven by a correlation of the surface brightness with the spin and the\ngas-richness of the galaxies, showing only a minor dependence on the surface\nbrightness. We also find that the length of the bars shows a strong dependence\non the surface brightness, and although some of this dependence is attributed\nto the gas content, even at fixed gas-to-stellar mass ratio, high surface\nbrightness galaxies host longer bars than their low surface brightness\ncounterparts, which we attribute to an anticorrelation of the surface\nbrightness with the spin.\n", "  We investigate the effects of interactions between ions and neutrals on the\nchromosphere and overlying corona using 2.5D radiative MHD simulations with the\nBifrost code. We have extended the code capabilities implementing ion-neutral\ninteraction effects using the Generalized Ohm's Law, i.e., we include the Hall\nterm and the ambipolar diffusion (Pedersen dissipation) in the induction\nequation. Our models span from the upper convection zone to the corona, with\nthe photosphere, chromosphere and transition region partially ionized. Our\nsimulations reveal that the interactions between ionized particles and neutral\nparticles have important consequences for the magneto-thermodynamics of these\nmodeled layers: 1) ambipolar diffusion increases the temperature in the\nchromosphere; 2) sporadically the horizontal magnetic field in the photosphere\nis diffused into the chromosphere due to the large ambipolar diffusion; 3)\nambipolar diffusion concentrates electrical currents leading to more violent\njets and reconnection processes, resulting in 3a) the formation of longer and\nfaster spicules, 3b) heating of plasma during the spicule evolution, and 3c)\ndecoupling of the plasma and magnetic field in spicules. Our results indicate\nthat ambipolar diffusion is a critical ingredient for understanding the\nmagneto-thermo-dynamic properties in the chromosphere and transition region.\nThe numerical simulations have been made publicly available, similar to\nprevious Bifrost simulations. This will allow the community to study realistic\nnumerical simulations with a wider range of magnetic field configurations and\nphysics modules than previously possible.\n", "  The 2008 discovery of an eruption of M31N 2008-12a began a journey on which\nthe true nature of this remarkable recurrent nova continues to be revealed.\nM31N 2008-12a contains a white dwarf close to the Chandrasekhar limit,\naccreting at a high rate from its companion, and undergoes thermonuclear\neruptions which are observed yearly and may even be twice as frequent. In this\npaper, we report on Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph\nultraviolet spectroscopy taken within days of the predicted 2015 eruption,\ncoupled with Keck spectroscopy of the 2013 eruption. Together, this\nspectroscopy permits the reddening to be constrained to E(B-V) = 0.10 +/- 0.03.\nThe UV spectroscopy reveals evidence for highly ionized, structured, and high\nvelocity ejecta at early times. No evidence for neon is seen in these spectra\nhowever, but it may be that little insight can be gained regarding the\ncomposition of the white dwarf (CO vs ONe).\n", "  The bright subdwarf-O star (sdO), HD 49798, is in a 1.55 day orbit with a\ncompact companion that is spinning at 13.2 seconds. Using the measurements of\nthe effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$), surface gravity ($\\log g$), and\nsurface abundances of the sdO, we construct models to study the evolution of\nthis binary system using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics\n($\\texttt{MESA}$). Previous studies of the compact companion have disagreed on\nwhether it is a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star (NS). From the published\nmeasurements of the companion's spin and spin-up rate, we agree with Mereghetti\nand collaborators that a NS companion is more likely. However, since there\nremains the possibility of a WD companion, we use our constructed\n$\\texttt{MESA}$ models to run simulations with both WD and NS companions that\nhelp us constrain the past and future evolution of this system. If it presently\ncontains a NS, the immediate mass transfer evolution upon Roche lobe (RL)\nfilling will lead to mass transfer rates comparable to that implied in\nultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Depending on the rate of angular momentum\nextraction via a wind, the fate of this system is either a wide ($P_{\\rm\norb}{\\approx} 3$ day) intermediate mass binary pulsar (IMPB) with a relatively\nrapidly spinning NS (${\\approx} 0.3$ s) and a high mass WD (${\\approx} 0.9\nM_\\odot$), or a solitary millisecond pulsar (MSP).\n", "  The cosmic proper distance $d_P$ is a fundamental distance in the Universe.\nUnlike the luminosity and angular diameter distances, which correspond to the\nangular size, the proper distance is the length of light path from the source\nto observer. However, the proper distance has not been measured before. The\nrecent redshift measurement of a repeat fast radio burst (FRB) can shed light\non the proper distance. We show that the proper distance-redshift relation can\nindeed be derived from dispersion measures (DMs) of FRBs with measured\nredshifts. From Monte Carlo simulations, we find that about 500 FRBs with DM\nand redshift measurements can tightly constrain the proper distance-redshift\nrelation. We also show that the curvature of our Universe can be constrained\nwith a model-independent method using this derived proper distance-redshift\nrelation and the observed angular diameter distances. Owing to the high event\nrate of FRBs, hundreds of FRBs can be discovered in the future by upcoming\ninstruments. The proper distance will play an important role in investigating\nthe accelerating expansion and the geometry of the Universe.\n", "  Metasurfaces offered great opportunities to control electromagnetic (EM)\nwaves, but currently available meta-devices typically work either in pure\nreflection or pure transmission mode, leaving half of EM space completely\nunexplored. Here, we propose a new type of metasurface, composed by\nspecifically designed meta-atoms with polarization-dependent transmission and\nreflection properties, to efficiently manipulate EM waves in the full space. As\na proof of concept, three microwave meta-devices are designed, fabricated and\nexperimentally characterized. The first two can bend or focus EM waves at\ndifferent sides (i.e., transmission/reflection sides) of the metasurfaces\ndepending on the incident polarization, while the third one changes from a wave\nbender for reflected wave to a focusing lens for transmitted wave as the\nexcitation polarization is rotated, with all these functionalities exhibiting\nvery high efficiencies (in the range of 85%-91%). Our findings significantly\nexpand the capabilities of metasurfaces in controlling EM waves, and can\nstimulate high-performance multi-functional meta-devices facing more\nchallenging and diversified application demands.\n", "  The structure and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) in quasars are\nstill not well established. One popular BLR model is the disk-wind model that\noffers a geometric unification of a quasar based on the angle of viewing. We\nconstruct a simple kinematical disk-wind model with a narrow outflowing wind\nangle. The model is combined with radiative transfer in the Sobolev, or high\nvelocity, limit. We examine how angle of viewing affects the observed\ncharacteristics of the emission line, especially the line widths and velocity\noffsets. The line profiles exhibit distinct properties depending on the\norientation, wind opening angle, and region of the wind where the emission\narises.\n  At low inclination angle (close to face-on), we find the shape of the\nemission line is asymmetric with narrow width and significantly blueshifted. As\nthe inclination angle increases (close to edge-on), the line profile becomes\nmore symmetric, broader, and less blueshifted. Additionally, lines that arise\nclose to the base of the disk wind, near the accretion disk, tend to be broad\nand symmetric. The relative increase in blueshift of the emission line with\nincreasing wind vertical distance is larger for polar winds compared with\nequatorial winds. By considering the optical thickness of the wind,\nsingle-peaked line profiles are recovered for the intermediate and equatorial\noutflowing wind. The model is able to reproduce a faster response in either the\nred and blue sides of the line profile found in reverberation mapping studies.\nA quicker response in the red side is achieved in the model with a polar wind\nand intermediate wind opening angle at low viewing angle. The blue side\nresponse is faster for an equatorial wind seen at high inclination.\n", "  The spectroscopic sky survey carried out by the Large Sky Area Multi-Object\nFiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) provides the largest stellar spectra\nlibrary in the world until now. A large number of new DA white dwarfs had been\nidentified based on the LAMOST spectra. The effective temperature ($T_{\\rm\neff}$) and surface gravity ($\\log g$) of most DA white dwarfs were determined\nand published in the catalogs, e.g. Zhao et al. (2013), Rebassa-Mansergas et\nal. (2015), Gentile Fusillo et al. (2015) and Guo et al. (2015). We selected ZZ\nCeti candidates from the published catalogs by considering whether their\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ are situated in the ZZ Ceti instability strip. The follow-up\ntime-series photometric observations for the candidates were performed in 2015\nand 2016. Four stars: LAMOST J004628.31+343319.90, LAMOST J062159.49+252335.9,\nLAMOST J010302.46+433756.2 and LAMOST J013033.90+273757.9 are finally confirmed\nto be new ZZ Ceti stars. They show dominant peaks with amplitudes rising above\nthe 99.9% confidence level in the amplitude spectra. As LAMOST\nJ004628.31+343319.90 has an estimated mass of $\\sim$ 0.40 $M_{\\odot}$ and\nLAMOST J013033.90+273757.9 has a mass of $\\sim$ 0.45 $M_{\\odot}$ derived from\ntheir $\\log g$ values, these two stars are inferred to be potential helium-core\nwhite dwarfs.\n", "  We present Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations toward the high-mass\nstar-forming region IRAS 18566+0408. Observations at 1.3 mm continuum and in\nseveral molecular line transitions were performed in the compact (2.\"4 angular\nresolution) and very-extended (~0.\"4 angular resolution) configurations. The\ncontinuum emission from the compact configuration shows a dust core of 150\nMsun, while the very-extended configuration reveals a dense (2.6 x 10^7 cm^-3)\nand compact (~4,000 AU) condensation of 8 Msun. We detect 31 molecular\ntransitions from 14 species including CO isotopologues, SO, CH3OH, OCS, and\nCH3CN. Using the different k-ladders of the CH3CN line, we derive a rotational\ntemperature at the location of the continuum peak of 240 K. The 12CO(2-1),\n13CO(2-1), and SO(6_5-5_4) lines reveal a molecular outflow at PA ~135^o\ncentered at the continuum peak. The extended 12CO(2-1) emission has been\nrecovered with the IRAM 30 m telescope observations. Using the combined data\nset, we derive an outflow mass of 16.8 Msun. The chemically rich spectrum and\nthe high rotational temperature confirm that IRAS 18566+0408 is harboring a hot\nmolecular core. We find no clear velocity gradient that could suggest the\npresence of a rotational disk-like structure, even at the high resolution\nobservations obtained with the very-extended configuration.\n", "  We have conducted an interferometric line survey in the 0.8 mm band toward\nthe young high-mass protostar candidate NGC 2264 CMM3 with ALMA. CMM3 is\nresolved into the two continuum peaks, CMM3A and CMM3B, at an angular\nseparation of 0.9\". Thus, CMM3 is found to be a binary system candidate. We\nhave detected molecular outflows associated with CMM3A and CMM3B each,\nindicating active star formation. In addition to the two peaks, six faint\ncontinuum peaks are detected around CMM3A and CMM3B, most of which are thought\nto be evolved low-mass protostars. CMM3A is found to be rich in molecular line\nemission including complex organic molecules such as HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3. The\nemission of complex organic molecules is distributed within a compact region\naround the continuum peak of CMM3A. Hence, CMM3A apparently harbors a hot core.\nOn the other hand, CMM3B is deficient in molecular line emission, although its\ncontinuum flux is almost comparable to that of CMM3A. Possible origins of the\nstriking difference between CMM3A and CMM3B are discussed.\n", "  ROXs 12 (2MASS J16262803-2526477) is a young star hosting a directly imaged\ncompanion near the deuterium-burning limit. We present a suite of\nspectroscopic, imaging, and time-series observations to characterize the\nphysical and environmental properties of this system. Moderate-resolution\nnear-infrared spectroscopy of ROXs 12 B from Gemini-North/NIFS and Keck/OSIRIS\nreveals signatures of low surface gravity including weak alkali absorption\nlines and a triangular $H$-band pseudo-continuum shape. No signs of Pa$\\beta$\nemission are evident. As a population, however, we find that about half (46\n$\\pm$ 14\\%) of young ($\\lesssim$15 Myr) companions with masses $\\lesssim$20\n$M_\\mathrm{Jup}$ possess actively accreting subdisks detected via Pa$\\beta$\nline emission, which represents a lower limit on the prevalence of\ncircumplanetary disks in general as some are expected to be in a quiescent\nphase of accretion. The bolometric luminosity of the companion and age of the\nhost star (6$^{+4}_{-2}$ Myr) imply a mass of 17.5 $\\pm$ 1.5 $M_\\mathrm{Jup}$\nfor ROXs 12 B based on hot-start evolutionary models. We identify a wide (5100\nAU) tertiary companion to this system, 2MASS J16262774-2527247, which is\nheavily accreting and exhibits stochastic variability in its $K2$ light curve.\nBy combining $v$sin$i_*$ measurements with rotation periods from $K2$, we\nconstrain the line-of-sight inclinations of ROXs 12 A and 2MASS\nJ16262774-2527247 and find that they are misaligned by\n60$^{+7}_{-11}$$^{\\circ}$. In addition, the orbital axis of ROXs 12 B is likely\nmisaligned from the spin axis of its host star ROXs 12 A, suggesting that ROXs\n12 B formed akin to fragmenting binary stars or in an equatorial disk that was\ntorqued by the wide stellar tertiary.\n", "  Gamma-ray binaries are a small subclass of the high mass X-ray binary\npopulation which exhibit emission across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. We\npresent radial velocities of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 based on observations obtained\nwith the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT). We combine our measurements\nwith those published in the literature to get a broad phase coverage. The mass\nfunction obtained supports a neutron star compact object, although a black hole\nmass is possible for very low inclination angles. The improved phase coverage\nallows constraints to be placed on the orbital eccentricity (e = 0.31 $\\pm$\n0.16), which agrees with estimates from high-energy data.\n", "  We present a novel generalization of the two-stream method of radiative\ntransfer, which allows for the accurate treatment of radiative transfer in the\npresence of strong infrared scattering by aerosols. We prove that this\ngeneralization involves only a simple modification of the coupling coefficients\nand transmission functions in the hemispheric two-stream method. This\nmodification originates from allowing the ratio of the first Eddington\ncoefficients to depart from unity. At the heart of the method is the fact that\nthis ratio may be computed once and for all over the entire range of values of\nthe single-scattering albedo and scattering asymmetry factor. We benchmark our\nimproved two-stream method by calculating the fraction of flux reflected by a\nsingle atmospheric layer (the reflectivity) and comparing these calculations to\nthose performed using a 32-stream discrete-ordinates method. We further compare\nour improved two-stream method to the two-stream source function (16 streams)\nand delta-Eddington methods, demonstrating that it is often more accurate at\nthe order-of-magnitude level. Finally, we illustrate its accuracy using a toy\nmodel of the early Martian atmosphere hosting a cloud layer composed of\ncarbon-dioxide ice particles. The simplicity of implementation and accuracy of\nour improved two-stream method renders it suitable for implementation in\nthree-dimensional general circulation models. In other words, our improved\ntwo-stream method has the ease of implementation of a standard two-stream\nmethod, but the accuracy of a 32-stream method.\n", "  We present our broadband (2 - 250 keV) time-averaged spectral analysis of 388\nbursts from SGR J1550-5418, SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20 detected with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) here and as a database in a companion web-catalog.\nWe find that two blackbody functions (BB+BB), sum of two modified blackbody\nfunctions (LB+LB), sum of blackbody and powerlaw functions (BB+PO) and a power\nlaw with a high energy exponential cut-off (COMPT) all provide acceptable fits\nat similar levels. We performed numerical simulations to constrain the best\nfitting model for each burst spectrum and found that 67.6% burst spectra with\nwell-constrained parameters are better described by the Comptonized model. We\nalso found that 64.7% of these burst spectra are better described with LB+LB\nmodel, which is employed in SGR spectral analysis for the first time here, than\nBB+BB and BB+PO. We found a significant positive lower bound trend on photon\nindex, suggesting a decreasing upper bound on hardness, with respect to total\nflux and fluence. We compare this result with bursts observed from SGR and AXP\nsources and suggest the relationship is a distinctive characteristic between\nthe two. We confirm a significant anti-correlation between burst emission area\nand blackbody temperature and find that it varies between the hot and cool\nblackbody temperatures differently than previously discussed. We expand on the\ninterpretation of our results in the framework of strongly magnetized neutron\nstar case.\n", "  We present sensitive high angular resolution ($\\sim$ 0.1$''$ -- 0.3$''$)\ncontinuum ALMA (The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array) observations\nof the archetypal hot core located in Orion-KL. The observations were made in\nfive different spectral bands (bands 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9) covering a very broad\nrange of frequencies (149 -- 658 GHz). Apart of the well-know millimeter\nemitting objects located in this region (Orion Source I and BN), we report the\nfirst submillimeter detection of three compact continuum sources (ALMA 1-3) in\nthe vicinities of the Orion-KL hot molecular core. These three continuum\nobjects have spectral indices between 1.47 to 1.56, and brightness temperatures\nbetween 100 to 200 K at 658 GHz suggesting that we are seeing moderate\noptically thick dust emission with possible grain growth. However, as these\nobjects are not associated with warm molecular gas, and some of them are\nfarther out from the molecular core, we thus conclude that they cannot heat the\nmolecular core. This result favours the hypothesis that the hot molecular core\nin Orion-KL core is heated externally.\n", "  We have identified three K2 transiting star-planet systems, K2-51 (EPIC\n202900527), K2-67 (EPIC 206155547), and K2-76 (EPIC 206432863), as stellar\nbinaries with low-mass stellar secondaries. The three systems were\nstatistically validated as transiting planets, and through measuring their\norbits by radial velocity monitoring we have derived the companion masses to be\n$0.1459^{+0.0029}_{-0.0032}$ $M_{Sun}$ (EPIC 202900527 B),\n$0.1612^{+0.0072}_{-0.0067}$ $M_{Sun}$ (EPIC 206155547 B), and $0.0942 \\pm\n0.0019$ $M_{Sun}$ (EPIC 206432863 B). Therefore they are not planets but small\nstars, part of the small sample of low-mass stars with measured radius and\nmass. The three systems are at an orbital period range of $12-24$ days, and the\nsecondaries have a radius within $0.9-1.9$ $R_J$, not inconsistent with the\nproperties of warm Jupiter planets. These systems illustrate some of the\nexisting challenges in the statistical validation approach. We point out a few\npossible origins for the initial misclassification of these objects, including\npoor characterization of the host star, the difficulty in detecting a secondary\neclipse in systems on an eccentric orbit, and the difficulty in distinguishing\nbetween the smallest stars and gas giant planets as the two populations have\nindistinguishable radius distributions. Our work emphasizes the need for\nobtaining medium-precision radial velocity measurements to distinguish between\ncompanions that are small stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets.\n", "  We present the results of our work to determine the average albedo for small,\nclose-in planets in the {\\it Kepler} candidate catalog. We have adapted our\nmethod of averaging short cadence light curves of multiple Kepler planet\ncandidates to long cadence data, in order to detect an average albedo for the\ngroup of candidates. Long cadence data exist for many more candidates than the\nshort cadence, and so we separate the candidates into smaller radius bins than\nin our previous work: 1-2 Rearth, 2-4 Rearth, and 4-6 Rearth. We find that on\naverage, all three groups appear darker than suggested by the short cadence\nresult, but not as dark as many hot Jupiters. The average geometric albedos for\nthe three groups are 0.11 $\\pm$ 0.06, 0.05 $\\pm$ 0.04, and 0.11 $\\pm$ 0.08,\nrespectively, for the case where heat is uniformly distributed about the\nplanet. If heat redistribution is inefficient, the albedos are even lower,\nsince there will be a greater thermal contribution to the total light from the\nplanet. We confirm that newly-identified false positive Kepler Object of\nInterest (KOI) 1662.01 is indeed an eclipsing binary at twice the period listed\nin the planet candidate catalog. We also newly identify planet candidate KOI\n4351.01 as an eclipsing binary, and we report a secondary eclipse measurement\nfor Kepler-4b (KOI 7.01) of $\\sim$ 7.50 ppm at a phase of $\\sim$ 0.7,\nindicating that the planet is on an eccentric orbit.\n", "  We investigate the stellar kinematics and stellar populations of 58\nradio-loud galaxies of intermediate luminosities (L$_{3 GHz}$ $>$ 10$^{23}$ W\nHz$^{-1}$ ) at 0.6 < z < 1. This sample is constructed by cross-matching\ngalaxies from the deep VLT/VIMOS LEGA-C spectroscopic survey with the VLA 3 GHz\ndataset. The LEGA-C continuum spectra reveal for the first time stellar\nvelocity dispersions and age indicators of z $\\sim$ 1 radio galaxies. We find\nthat $z\\sim 1$ radio-loud AGN occur exclusively in predominantly old galaxies\nwith high velocity dispersions: $\\sigma_*>$ 175 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to\nblack hole masses in excess of $10^8$ M$_{\\odot}$. Furthermore, we confirm that\nat a fixed stellar mass the fraction of radio-loud AGN at z $\\sim$ 1 is 5 - 10\ntimes higher than in the local universe, suggesting that quiescent, massive\ngalaxies at z $\\sim$ 1 switch on as radio AGN on average once every Gyr. Our\nresults strengthen the existing evidence for a link between high black-hole\nmasses, radio loudness and quiescence at z $\\sim$ 1.\n", "  We report the discovery of two new unbound hypervelocity stars (HVSs) from\nthe LAMOST spectroscopic surveys. They are respectively a B2V type star of ~ 7\nM$_{\\rm \\odot}$ with a Galactic rest-frame radial velocity of 502 km/s at a\nGalactocentric radius of ~ 21 kpc and a B7V type star of ~ 4 M$_{\\rm \\odot}$\nwith a Galactic rest-frame radial velocity of 408 km/s at a Galactocentric\nradius of ~ 30 kpc. The origins of the two HVSs are not clear given their\ncurrently poorly measured proper motions. However, the future data releases of\nGaia should provide proper motion measurements accurate enough to solve this\nproblem. The ongoing LAMOST spectroscopic surveys are expected to yield more\nHVSs to form a statistical sample, providing vital constraint on understanding\nthe nature of HVSs and their ejection mechanisms.\n", "  Cosmological models assuming the scale invariance of the macroscopic empty\nspace show an accelerated expansion, without calling for some unknown\nparticles. Several comparisons between models and observations (tests on\ndistances, m-z diagram, Omega_Lambda vs. Omega_m plot, age vs. H_0, H(z) vs. z,\ntransition braking-acceleration) have indicated an impressive agreement {Maeder\n2017}. We pursue the tests with the CMB temperatures T(CMB) as a function of\nredshifts z. CO molecules in DLA systems provide the most accurate excitation\ntemperatures T(exc) up to z ~ 2.7. Such data need corrections for local\neffects, like particle collisions, optical depths, UV radiation, etc. We\nestimate these corrections as a function of the (CO/H_2) ratios from far UV\nobservations of CO molecules in the Galaxy. The results show that it is not\nsufficient to apply theoretical collisional corrections to get the proper\nvalues of T(CMB) vs.z. Thus, the agreement often found with the standard model\nmay be questioned. The T(CMB)vs. z relation needs further careful attention and\nthe same for the scale invariant cosmology in view of its positive tests.\n", "  We obtained $XMM-Newton$ observations of two highly luminous dust-reddened\nquasars, F2M1113+1244 and F2M1656+3821, that appear to be in the early,\ntransitional phase predicted by merger-driven models of quasar/galaxy\nco-evolution. These sources have been well-studied at optical through\nmid-infrared wavelengths and are growing relatively rapidly, with Eddington\nratios $>30\\%$. Their black hole masses are relatively small compared to their\nhost galaxies placing them below the $M_{\\rm BH} - L_{\\rm bulge}$ relation. We\nfind that for both sources, an absorbed power-law model with $1-3\\%$ of the\nintrinsic continuum scattered or leaked back into the line-of-sight best fits\ntheir X-ray spectra. We measure the absorbing column density ($N_H$) and\nconstrain the dust-to-gas ratios in these systems, finding that they lie well\nbelow the Galactic value. This, combined with the presence of broad emission\nlines in their optical and near-infrared spectra, suggests that the dust\nabsorption occurs far from the nucleus, in the host galaxy, while the X-rays\nare mostly absorbed in the nuclear, dust-free region within the sublimation\nradius. We also compare the quasars' absorption-corrected, rest-frame X-ray\nluminosities ($2-10$ keV) to their rest-frame infrared luminosities (6$\\mu$m)\nand find that red quasars, similar to other populations of luminous obscured\nquasars, are either underluminous in X-rays or overluminous in the infrared.\n", "  We present an abundance analysis of seven super-star clusters in the disk of\nM83. The near-infrared spectra of these clusters are dominated by Red\nSupergiants, and the spectral similarity in the J-band of such stars at uniform\nmetallicity means that the integrated light from the clusters may be analysed\nusing the same tools as those applied to single stars. Using data from VLT/KMOS\nwe estimate metallicities for each cluster in the sample. We find that the\nabundance gradient in the inner regions of M83 is flat, with a central\nmetallicity of [Z] = 0.21$\\pm$0.11 relative to a Solar value of\n$Z_\\odot$=0.014, which is in excellent agreement with the results from an\nanalysis of luminous hot stars in the same regions. Compiling this latest study\nwith our other recent work, we construct a mass-metallicity relation for nearby\ngalaxies based entirely on the analysis of RSGs. We find excellent agreement\nwith the other stellar-based technique, that of blue supergiants, as well as\nwith temperature-sensitive (`auroral' or `direct') \\hii-region studies. Of all\nthe HII-region strong-line calibrations, those which are empirically calibrated\nto direct-method studies (N2 and O3N2) provide the most consistent results.\n", "  The measurement of an exoplanet's oblateness and obliquity provides insights\ninto the planet's internal structure and formation history. Previous work using\nsmall differences in the shape of the transit light curve has been moderately\nsuccessful, but was hampered by the small signal and extreme photometric\nprecision required. The measurement of changes in transit depth, caused by the\nspin precession of an oblate planet, was proposed as an alternative method.\nHere, we present the first attempt to measure these changes. Using Kepler\nphotometry, we examined the brown dwarf Kepler-39b and the warm Saturn\nKepler-427b. We could not reliably constrain the oblateness of Kepler-39b. We\nfind transit depth variations for Kepler-427b at $90.1\\%$ significance\n($1.65\\sigma$) consistent with a precession period of $P_\\mathrm{prec} =\n5.45^{+0.46}_{-0.37}~\\mathrm{years}$ and an oblateness,\n$f~=~0.19^{+0.32}_{-0.16}$. This oblateness is comparable to Solar System gas\ngiants, and would raise questions about the dynamics and tidal synchronization\nof Kepler-427b.\n", "  We examine the distribution of old, metal-poor stars in a portion of the\nrecently released PanSTARRs survey. We find an interesting confluence of four\nnew cold stellar stream candidates that appear to converge on or pass near the\nsouth Galactic pole. The stream candidates, which we designate Murrumbidgee,\nMolonglo, Orinoco, and Kwando, lie at a distance of approximately 20 kpc and\nrange in length from 13 to 95 degrees, or about 5 to 33 kpc. The stream\ncandidates are between 100 and 300 pc in width, and are estimated to contain\nbetween 3000 and 8000 stars each, suggesting progenitors similar to modern day\nglobular clusters. The trajectories of the streams imply orbits that range from\nhyperbolic to nearly circular. The Molonglo stream is nearly parallel to, at\nthe same distance as, and offset by only 2.5 degrees from the previously\ndiscovered ATLAS stream, suggesting a possible common origin. Orinoco and\nKwando also have similarly shaped, moderately eccentric, obliquely viewed\norbits that suggest distinct progenitors within a common, larger parent body.\n", "  In 2012, five high school students involved in the Pulsar Search\nCollaboratory discovered the millisecond pulsar PSR J1400$-$1431 and initial\ntiming parameters were published in Rosen et al. (2013) a year later. Since\nthen, we have obtained a phase-connected timing solution spanning five years,\nresolving a significant position discrepancy and measuring $\\dot{P}$, proper\nmotion, parallax, and a monotonic slope in dispersion measure over time. Due to\nPSR J1400$-$1431's proximity and significant proper motion, we use the\nShklovskii effect and other priors to determine a 95% confidence interval for\nPSR J1400$-$1431's distance, $d=270^{+130}_{-80}$ pc. With an improved timing\nposition, we present the first detection of the pulsar's low-mass white dwarf\n(WD) companion using the Goodman Spectrograph on the 4.1-m SOAR telescope.\nDeeper imaging suggests that it is a cool DA-type WD with $T_{\\rm\neff}=3000\\pm100$ K and $R/R_\\odot=(2.19\\pm0.03)\\times10^{-2}\\,(d/270\\,{\\rm\npc})$. We show a convincing association between PSR J1400$-$1431 and a\n$\\gamma$-ray point source, 3FGL J1400.5$-$1437, but only weak (3.3-$\\sigma$)\nevidence of pulsations after folding $\\gamma$-ray photons using our radio\ntiming model. We detect an X-ray counterpart with XMM-Newton but the measured\nX-ray luminosity ($1\\times10^{29}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) makes PSR J1400$-$1431 the\nleast X-ray luminous rotation-powered millisecond pulsar (MSP) detected to\ndate. Together, our findings present a consistent picture of a nearby\n($d\\approx230$ pc) MSP in a 9.5-day orbit around a cool, $\\sim$0.3 M$_\\odot$ WD\ncompanion, with orbital inclination, $i\\gtrsim60^\\circ$.\n", "  In this work we showcase the potential of peptides as versatile scaffolds for\nquantum computing and molecular spintronics. In particular, we focus on\nlanthanide-binding tags, which were originally developed in the field of\nbiotechnology for the study of protein structure and dynamics. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate quantum coherent oscillations in a Neodymium peptidic qubit. Then,\nemploying bacterial biosynthesis, we investigate the possibility of increasing\nthe number of qubits in the same molecular system, with the case studies being\na double spin qubit with two distinct coordination environments, and an\nasymmetric chain of 9 spin qubits with a spin-spin separation of about 2 nm and\nin an arbitrarily chosen sequence of coordination environments. Finally, we\ntake advantage of biochemical modification for the preparation of paramagnetic,\nchiral, Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAMs) on Au(111).Our experimental and\ntheoretical characterization shows that this is a promising structure for\nspintronic applications, and in particular to improve on two state-of-the-art\napproaches to molecular spin qubits. We conclude with an overview of the\nchallenges and new opportunities opened by this emerging field.\n", "  We investigate the relation between disk mass and mass accretion rate to\nconstrain the mechanism of angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks.\nDust mass and mass accretion rate in Chamaeleon I are correlated with a slope\nclose to linear, similar to the one recently identified in Lupus. We\ninvestigate the effect of stellar mass and find that the intrinsic scatter\naround the best-fit Mdust-Mstar and Macc-Mstar relations is uncorrelated. Disks\nwith a constant alpha viscosity can fit the observed relations between dust\nmass, mass accretion rate, and stellar mass, but over-predict the strength of\nthe correlation between disk mass and mass accretion rate when using standard\ninitial conditions. We find two possible solutions. 1) The observed scatter in\nMdust and Macc is not primoridal, but arises from additional physical processes\nor uncertainties in estimating the disk gas mass. Most likely grain growth and\nradial drift affect the observable dust mass, while variability on large time\nscales affects the mass accretion rates. 2) The observed scatter is primordial,\nbut disks have not evolved substantially at the age of Lupus and Chamaeleon I\ndue to a low viscosity or a large initial disk radius. More accurate estimates\nof the disk mass and gas disk sizes in a large sample of protoplanetary disks,\neither through direct observations of the gas or spatially resolved\nmulti-wavelength observations of the dust with ALMA, are needed to discriminate\nbetween both scenarios or to constrain alternative angular momentum transport\nmechanisms such as MHD disk winds.\n", "  The Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE)\nreactivation mission has completed its third year of surveying the sky in the\nthermal infrared for near-Earth asteroids and comets. NEOWISE collects\nsimultaneous observations at 3.4 um and 4.6 um of solar system objects passing\nthrough its field of regard. These data allow for the determination of total\nthermal emission from bodies in the inner solar system, and thus the sizes of\nthese objects. In this paper we present thermal model fits of asteroid\ndiameters for 170 NEOs and 6110 MBAs detected during the third year of the\nsurvey, as well as the associated optical geometric albedos. We compare our\nresults with previous thermal model results from NEOWISE for overlapping sample\nsets, as well as diameters determined through other independent methods, and\nfind that our diameter measurements for NEOs agree to within 26% (1-sigma) of\npreviously measured values. Diameters for the MBAs are within 17% (1-sigma).\nThis brings the total number of unique near-Earth objects characterized by the\nNEOWISE survey to 541, surpassing the number observed during the fully\ncryogenic mission in 2010.\n", "  We compare time variations of the H$\\alpha$ and X-ray emissions observed\nduring the pre-impulsive and impulsive phases of the C1.1-class solar flare on\n21 June 2013 with those of plasma parameters and synthesized X-ray emission\nfrom a one-dimensional hydro-dynamic numerical model of the flare. The\nnumerical model was calculated assuming that the external energy is delivered\nto the flaring loop by non-thermal electrons. The H$\\alpha$ spectra and images\nwere obtained using the Multi-channel Subtractive Double Pass spectrograph with\na time resolution of 50~ms. The X-ray fluxes and spectra were recorded by the\nReuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). Pre-flare\ngeometric and thermodynamic parameters of the model and the delivered energy\nwere estimated using RHESSI data.\n  The time variations of the X-ray light curves in various energy bands and the\nthose of the H$\\alpha$ intensities and line profiles were well correlated. The\ntime scales of the observed variations agree with the calculated variations of\nthe plasma parameters in the flaring loop footpoints, reflecting the time\nvariations of the vertical extent of the energy deposition layer. Our result\nshows that the fast time variations of the H$\\alpha$ emission of the flaring\nkernels can be explained by momentary changes of the deposited energy flux and\nthe variations of the penetration depths of the non-thermal electrons.\n", "  For the sake of high-sensitivity 6.7 GHz methanol maser observations, we\ndeveloped a new technology for coherently combining the two signals from the\nHitachi 32 m radio telescope and the Takahagi 32 m radio telescope of the\nJapanese Very long baseline interferometer Network (JVN), where the two\ntelescopes were separated by about 260 m. After the two telescopes were phased\nas a twofold larger single telescope, the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of\nthe 6.7 GHz methanol masers observed by the phased telescopes was improved to\n1.254-fold higher than that of the single dish, through a Very Long Baseline\nInterferometry (VLBI) experiment on the 50 km baseline of the Kashima 34 m\ntelescope and the 1000 km baseline of the Yamaguchi 32 m telescope.\nFurthermore, we compared the SNRs of the 6.7 GHz maser spectra for two methods.\nOne is a VLBI method and the other is the newly developed digital position\nswitching, which is a similar technology to that used in noise-cancelling\nheadphones. Finally, we confirmed that the mean SNR of method of the digital\nposition switching (ON-OFF) was 1.597-fold higher than that of the VLBI method.\n", "  We present a $^{13}\\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \\rightarrow 0)$ mapping survey of 12\nnearby galaxies from the CARMA STING sample. The line intensity ratio\n$\\mathcal{R} \\equiv I[^{12}\\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \\rightarrow\n0)]/I[^{13}\\mathrm{CO} (J = 1 \\rightarrow 0)]$ is derived to study the\nvariations in molecular gas properties. For 11 galaxies where it can be\nmeasured with high significance, the spatially resolved $\\mathcal{R}$ on\n(sub-)kiloparsec scales varies by up to a factor of 3--5 within a galaxy. Lower\n$\\mathcal{R}$ values are usually found in regions with weaker $^{12}\\rm CO$. We\nattribute this apparent trend to a bias against measuring large $\\mathcal{R}$\nvalues when $^{12}\\rm CO$ is weak. Limiting our analysis to the $^{12}\\rm CO$\nbright regions that are less biased, we do not find $\\mathcal{R}$ on (sub)kpc\nscales correlate with galactocentric distance, velocity dispersion or the star\nformation rate. The lack of correlation between SFR and $\\mathcal{R}$ indicates\nthat the CO optical depth is not sensitive to stellar energy input, or that any\nsuch sensitivity is easily masked by other factors. Extending the analysis to\nall regions with $\\rm ^{12}CO$ emission by spectral stacking, we find that 5\nout of 11 galaxies show higher stacked $\\mathcal{R}$ for galactocentric radii\nof $\\gtrsim 1$ kpc and $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{SFR}} \\lesssim 0.1 \\rm \\ M_{sun}\nyr^{-1} kpc^{-2}$, which could result from a greater contribution from diffuse\ngas. Moreover, significant galaxy-to-galaxy variations are found in\n$\\mathcal{R}$, but the global $\\mathcal{R}$ does not strongly depend on dust\ntemperature, inclination, or metallicity of the galaxy.\n", "  In the work we search for the $\\gamma$-ray signal from M33, one of the\nbiggest galaxies in the Local Group, by using the Pass 8 data of Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT). No statistically significant gamma-ray emission has been\ndetected in the direction of M33 and we report a new upper limit of high energy\n($>100\\,\\rm MeV$) photon flux of $2.3\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\rm ph\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$,\nwhich is more strict than previous constrains and implies a cosmic ray density\nof M33 lower than that speculated previously. Nevertheless the current limit is\nstill in agreement with the correlation of star formation rate and $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity inferred from the Local group galaxies and a few nearby starburst\ngalaxies.\n", "  We complete the set of QCD light-cone sum rules for $B\\to \\pi\\pi$ transition\nform factors, deriving a new sum rule for the timelike-helicity form factor\n$F_t$ in terms of dipion distribution amplitudes. This sum rule, in the leading\ntwist-2 approximation, is directly related to the pion vector form factor.\nEmploying a relation between $F_t$ and other $B\\to \\pi\\pi$ form factors we\nobtain also the longitudinal-helicity form factor $F_0$. In this way, all four\n(axial-)vector $B\\to \\pi\\pi$ form factors are predicted from light-cone sum\nrules with dipion distribution amplitudes. These results are valid for small\ndipion masses with large momentum.\n", "  We measure the surface of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ single crystals by making use\nof two photon photoemission spectroscopy. Our method monitors the electronic\ndistribution of photoexcited electrons, explicitly discriminating the initial\nthermalization from slower dynamical processes. The reported results disclose\nthe fast dissipation channels of hot carriers (0.25 ps), set a upper bound to\nthe surface induced recombination velocity ($<4000$ cm/s) and reveal the\ndramatic effect of shallow traps on the electrons dynamics. The picosecond\nlocalization of excited electrons in degraded CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ samples is\nconsistent with the progressive reduction of photoconversion efficiency in\noperating devices. Minimizing the density of shallow traps and solving the\naging problem may boost the macroscopic efficiency of solar cells to the\ntheoretical limit.\n", "  We have studied free higher spin gauge fields through an investigation of\ntheir Hamiltonian dynamics. Over a flat space-time, their Hamiltonian\nconstraints were identified and solved through the introduction of\nprepotentials, enjoying both linearized generalized diffeomorphism and\nlinearized generalized Weyl rescaling gauge invariance, motivating our study of\nconformal invariants for higher spins. We built these with the Cotton tensor,\nwhose properties (tracelessness, symmetry, divergencelessness; completeness,\ninvariance) we established. With these geometric tools, a first order action\nwas written down in terms of the prepotentials. It is manifestly invariant\nunder electric-magnetic duality which, with the gauge freedom of the\nprepotentials, completely fixes the action. This action is associated to\ntwisted self-duality conditions.\n  With an interest in supersymmetric extensions, we began to extend this study\nto fermions, similarly analyzing the spin $5/2$ massless free field, whose\nprepotential also enjoys conformal gauge invariance. The spin $2$-spin $5/2$\nsupermultiplet was considered, and a rigid symmetry of its action (a\nchirality-duality rotation) was built to commute with supersymmetry. We also\ninvestigated the properties of a mixed symmetry field on a flat six-dimensional\nspace-time, the so-called chiral $(2,2)$-form: Hamiltonian analysis,\nprepotentials, and a first order action associated to self-duality conditions.\n  Finally, we studied both fermionic and bosonic higher spin surface charges\nover a constantly curved background space-time. The Hamitonian constraints are\nthe generators of gauge transformations. Plugging into them appropriate values\nof the gauge parameters (imposing a physical variation of the fields), their\nfinite and non-vanishing on-shell values were computed and recognized as\nconserved charges of the theory. Their algebra was checked to be abelian.\n", "  The star-forming efficiency of dense gas is thought to be set within cores by\noutflow and radiative feedback. We use magneto-hydrodynamic simulations to\ninvestigate the relation between protostellar outflow evolution, turbulence and\nstar formation efficiency. We model the collapse and evolution of isolated\ndense cores for $\\gtrsim$ 0.5 Myr including the effects of turbulence,\nradiation transfer, and both radiation and outflow feedback from forming\nprotostars. We show that outflows drive and maintain turbulence in the core\nenvironment even with strong initial fields. The star-formation efficiency\ndecreases with increasing field strength, and the final efficiencies are\n$15-40$\\%. The Stage 0 lifetime, during which the protostellar mass is less\nthan the dense envelope, increases proportionally with the initial magnetic\nfield strength and ranges from $\\sim 0.1-0.4$ Myr. The average accretion rate\nis well-represented by a tapered turbulent core model, which is a function of\nthe final protostellar mass and is independent of the magnetic field strength.\nBy tagging material launched in the outflow, we demonstrate that the outflow\nentrains about $3$ times the actual launched gas mass, a ratio that remains\nroughly constant in time regardless of the initial magnetic field strength.\nHowever, turbulent driving increases for stronger fields since momentum is more\nefficiently imparted to non-outflow material. The protostellar outflow momentum\nis highest during the first 0.1 Myr and declines thereafter by a factor of\n$\\gtrsim 10$ as the accretion rate diminishes.\n", "  We use Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of red clump stars taken as\npart of the Small Magellanic Cloud Investigation of Dust and Gas Evolution\n(SMIDGE) program to measure the average dust extinction curve in a ~ 200 pc x\n100 pc region in the southwest bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The\nrich information provided by our 8-band ultra-violet through near-infrared\nphotometry allows us to model the color-magnitude diagram of the red clump\naccounting for the extinction curve shape, a log-normal distribution of\n$A_{V}$, and the depth of the stellar distribution along the line of sight. We\nmeasure an extinction curve with $R_{475} = A_{475}/(A_{475}-A_{814})$ = 2.65\n$\\pm$ 0.11. This measurement is significantly larger than the equivalent values\nof published Milky Way $R_{V}$ = 3.1 ($R_{475} = 1.83$) and SMC Bar $R_{V}$ =\n2.74 ($R_{475} = 1.86$) extinction curves. Similar extinction curve offsets in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) have been interpreted as the effect of large\ndust grains. We demonstrate that the line-of-sight depth of the SMC (and LMC)\nintroduces an apparent \"gray\" contribution to the extinction curve inferred\nfrom the morphology of the red clump. We show that no gray dust component is\nneeded to explain extinction curve measurements when a full-width half-max\ndepth of 10 $\\pm$ 2 kpc in the stellar distribution of the SMC (5 $\\pm$ 1 kpc\nfor the LMC) is considered, which agrees with recent studies of Magellanic\nCloud stellar structure. The results of our work demonstrate the power of\nbroad-band HST imaging for simultaneously constraining dust and galactic\nstructure outside the Milky Way.\n", "  In the paradigm of magnetic launching of astrophysical jets, instabilities in\nthe MHD flow are a good candidate to convert the Poynting flux into the kinetic\nenergy of the plasma. If the magnetised plasma fills the almost entire space,\nthe jet is unstable to helical perturbations of its body. However, the growth\nrate of these modes is suppressed when the poloidal component of the magnetic\nfield has a vanishing gradient, which may be the actual case for a realistic\nconfiguration. Here we show that, if the magnetised plasma is confined into a\nlimited region by the pressure of some external medium, the velocity shear at\nthe contact surface excites unstable modes which can affect a significant\nfraction of the jet's body. We find that when the Lorentz factor of the jet is\n$\\Gamma\\sim10$ ($\\Gamma\\sim 100$), these perturbations typically develop after\npropagating along the jet for tens (hundreds) of jet's radii. Surface modes may\ntherefore play an important role in converting the energy of the jet from the\nPoynting flux to the kinetic energy of the plasma, particularly in AGN. The\nscaling of the dispersion relation with (i) the angular velocity of the field\nlines and (ii) the sound speed in the confining gas is discussed.\n", "  Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code, we\ninvestigate the influences of irradiation on ultra-compact X-ray binary (UCXB)\nevolution. Although the persistent UCXBs have short orbital periods which\nresult in high irradiation flux, the irradiation hardly affects the evolution\nof persistent sources because the WDs in these binaries have large masses which\nlead to very low irradiation depth. The irradiation has a significant effect on\nthe transient sources during outburst phase. At the beginning of the outburst,\nhigh X-ray luminosity produces high radiation flux, which results in the\nsignificant expansion of WD. Then, the irradiation triggers high mass-transfer\nrates, which can last several days for the transient sources with WDs whose\nmasses are larger than $\\sim0.015 M_\\odot$ or several hundred years for these\nsources with WDs whose masses are less than $\\sim0.012 M_\\odot$. The observed\nthree persistent UCXBs, XTE J0929-314, 4U 1916-05 and SWIFT J1756.9-2508, may\nbelong to the latter.\n", "  Observations suggest that star formation in filamentary molecular clouds\noccurs in a two-step process, with the formation of filaments preceding that of\nprestellar cores and stars. Here, we apply the gravo-turbulent fragmentation\ntheory of Hennebelle & Chabrier 08, 09, 13 to a filamentary environment, taking\ninto account magnetic support. We discuss the induced geometrical effect on the\ncores, with a transition from 3D geometry at small scales to 1D at large ones.\nThe model predicts the fragmentation behavior of a filament for a given mass\nper unit length (MpL) and level of magnetization. This CMF for individual\nfilaments is then convolved with the distribution of filaments to obtain the\nfinal system CMF. The model yields two major results: (i) the filamentary\ngeometry naturally induces a hierarchical fragmentation process, first into\ngroups of cores, separated by a length equal to a few filament Jeans lengths,\ni.e. a few times the filament width. These groups then fragment into individual\ncores. (ii) Non-magnetized filaments with high MpL are found to fragment\nexcessively, at odd with observations. This is resolved by taking into account\nthe magnetic field treated simply as additional pressure support). The present\ntheory suggests two complementary modes of star formation: while small\n(spherical or filamentary) structures will collapse directly into prestellar\ncores, according to the standard Hennebelle-Chabrier theory, the large\n(filamentary) ones, the dominant population according to observations, will\nfollow the afore-described two-step process.\n", "  We present results of a ground-based near-infrared campaign with Palomar\nTripleSpec, Keck NIRSPEC, and Gemini GNIRS to target two samples of reddened\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates from the 31 deg$^2$ Stripe 82 X-ray\nsurvey. One sample, which is $\\sim$89\\% complete to $K<16$ (Vega), consists of\neight confirmed AGNs, four of which were identified with our follow-up program,\nand is selected to have red $R-K$ colors ($>4$, Vega). The fainter sample\n($K>17$, Vega) represents a pilot program to follow-up four sources from a\nparent sample of 34 that are not detected in the single-epoch SDSS catalog and\nhave {\\it WISE} quasar colors. All twelve sources are broad-line AGNs (at least\none permitted emission line has a FWHM exceeding 1300 km s$^{-1}$) and span a\nredshift range $0.59 < z < 2.5$. Half the ($R-K$)-selected AGNs have features\nin their spectra suggestive of outflows. When comparing these sources to a\nmatched sample of blue Type 1 AGNs, we find the reddened AGNs are more distant\n($z > 0.5$) and a greater percentage have high X-ray luminosities ($L_{\\rm\nX,full} > 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Such outflows and high luminosities may be\nconsistent with the paradigm that reddened broad-line AGNs represent a\ntransitory phase in AGN evolution as described by the major merger model for\nblack hole growth. Results from our pilot program demonstrate proof-of-concept\nthat our selection technique is successful in discovering reddened quasars at\n$z > 1$ missed by optical surveys.\n", "  We report on the photometric properties of faculae and network as observed in\nfull-disk, scattered-light corrected images from the Helioseismic Magnetic\nImager. We use a Lucy-Richardson deconvolution routine that corrects an image\nin less than one second. Faculae are distinguished from network through\nproximity to active regions. This is the first report that full-disk\nobservations, including center-to-limb variations, reproduce the photometric\nproperties of faculae and network observed previously only in sub-arcsecond\nresolution, small field-of-view studies, i.e. that network, as defined by\ndistance from active regions, exhibit higher photometric contrasts.\nSpecifically, for magnetic flux values larger than approximately 300 G, the\nnetwork is brighter than faculae and the contrast differences increases toward\nthe limb, where the network contrast is about twice the facular one. For lower\nmagnetic flux values, network appear darker than faculae. Contrary to reports\nfrom previous full-disk observations, we also found that network exhibits a\nhigher center-to-limb variation. Our results are in agreement with reports from\nsimulations that indicate magnetic flux alone is a poor proxy of the\nphotometric properties of magnetic features. We estimate that the contribution\nof faculae and network to Total Solar Irradiance variability of the current\nCycle 24 is overestimated by at least 11\\% due to the photometric properties of\nnetwork and faculae not being recognized as different. This estimate is\nspecific to the method employed in this study to reconstruct irradiance\nvariations, so caution should be paid when extending it to other techniques.\n", "  An exospheric kinetic solar wind model is interfaced with an\nobservation-driven single fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. Initially, a\nphotospheric magnetogram serves as observational input in the fluid approach to\nextrapolate the heliospheric magnetic field. Then semi-empirical coronal models\nare used for estimating the plasma characteristics up to a heliocentric\ndistance of 0.1AU. From there on a full MHD model which computes the\nthree-dimensional time-dependent evolution of the solar wind macroscopic\nvariables up to the orbit of the Earth is used. After interfacing the density\nand velocity at the inner MHD boundary, we compare with the results of a\nkinetic exospheric solar wind model based on the assumption of Maxwell and\nKappa velocity distribution functions for protons and electrons respectively,\nas well as with \\textit{in situ} observations at 1AU. This provides insight on\nmore physically detailed processes, such as coronal heating and solar wind\nacceleration, that naturally arise by inclusion of suprathermal electrons in\nthe model. We are interested in the profile of the solar wind speed and density\nat 1AU, in characterizing the slow and fast source regions of the wind and in\ncomparing MHD with exospheric models in similar conditions. We calculate the\nenergetics of both models from low to high heliocentric distances.\n", "  We investigate the characteristics of the solar flares complex network. The\nlimited predictability, non-linearity, and self-organized criticality of the\nflares allow us to study systems of flares in the field of the complex systems.\nBoth the occurrence time and the location of flares detected from January 1,\n2006 to July 21, 2016 are used to design the growing flares network. The solar\nsurface is divided into cells with equal areas. The cells, which include\nflare(s), are considered as nodes of the network. The related links are\nequivalent to sympathetic flaring. The extracted features present that the\nnetwork of flares follows quantitative measures of complexity. The power-law\nnature of the connectivity distribution with a degree exponent greater than\nthree reveals that flares form a scale-free and small-world network. The great\nvalue of the clustering coefficient, small characteristic path length, and\nslowly change of the diameter are all characteristics of the flares network. We\nshow that the degree correlation of the flares network has the characteristics\nof a disassortative network. About 11% of the large energetic flares (M and X\ntypes in GOES classification) that occurred in the network hubs cover 3% of the\nsolar surface.\n", "  We combined Chandra ACIS observations of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae\n(hereafter, 47 Tuc) from 2000, 2002, and 2014-15 to create a deeper X-ray\nsource list, and study some of the faint radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs)\npresent in this cluster. We have detected 370 X-ray sources within the\nhalf-mass radius (2$'$.79) of the cluster, 81 of which are newly identified, by\nincluding new data and using improved source detection techniques. The majority\nof the newly identified sources are in the crowded core region, indicating\ncluster membership. We associate five of the new X-ray sources with\nchromospherically active BY Dra or W UMa variables identified by Albrow et al.\n(2001). We present alternative positions derived from two methods, centroiding\nand image reconstruction, for faint, crowded sources. We are able to extract\nX-ray spectra of the recently discovered MSPs 47 Tuc aa, 47 Tuc ab, the newly\ntimed MSP 47 Tuc Z, and the newly resolved MSPs 47 Tuc S and 47 Tuc F.\nGenerally, they are well fit by black body or neutron star atmosphere models,\nwith temperatures, luminosities and emitting radii similar to those of other\nknown MSPs in 47 Tuc, though 47 Tuc aa and 47 Tuc ab reach lower X-ray\nluminosities. We limit X-ray emission from the full surface of the rapidly\nspinning (542 Hz) MSP 47 Tuc aa, and use this limit to put an upper bound for\namplitude of r-mode oscillations in this pulsar as $\\alpha<2.5\\times 10^{-9}$\nand constrain the shape of the r-mode instability window.\n", "  Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe.\nThey often show rapid increase of polarization degree in the late phase. This\ntime evolution is generally believed to originate from the emergence of an\ninner aspherical core, while an effect of polarized-scattered echoes by\ncircumstellar (CS) dust around the SN may also substantially contribute to this\npolarization feature. In this study, we examine the effects of the scatted\nechoes on the SN polarization through radiative transfer simulations for\nvarious geometry and amount of CS dust. It has been found that\nasymmetrically-distributed CS dust, which is generally inferred for red\nsupergiants, could reproduce the observed polarization features. We have\napplied our results to SNe 2004dj and 2006ov, deriving the geometry and amount\nof CS dust to explain their observed polarization features in this scenario.\nFor both SNe, the blob-like or bipolar distribution of CS dust rather than the\ndisk-like distribution is favored. The derived dust mass $M_{\\mathrm{dust}}$ in\nthe blob model (the bipolar CS dust model) for SNe 2004dj and 2006ov are $\\sim\n7.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ ($\\sim 8.5 \\times10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and\n$\\sim 5.2 \\times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ ($\\sim 1.3 \\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$),\nrespectively. Even in the case where this process would not play a dominant\nrole in the observed polarization signals, this effect should in principle\ncontribute to it, the strength of which depends on the nature of CS dust.\nTherefore, this effect must be taken into account in discussing\nmulti-dimensional structure of an SN explosion through polarimetric\nobservations.\n", "  We present new measurements of the large scale clustering component of the\ncross-power spectra of the source-subtracted Spitzer-IRAC Cosmic Infrared\nBackground (CIB) and Chandra-ACIS Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB) surface\nbrightness fluctuations. Our investigation uses data from the Chandra Deep\nField South (CDFS), Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN), EGS/AEGIS field and\nUDS/SXDF surveys, comprising 1160 Spitzer hours and $\\sim$ 12 Ms of Chandra\ndata collected over a total area of 0.3 deg$^2$. We report the first\n($>$5$\\sigma$) detection of a cross-power signal on large angular scales >20\narcsec between [0.5-2] keV and the 3.6 and 4.5$\\mu$m bands, at $\\sim$5$\\sigma$\nand 6.3$\\sigma$ significance, respectively. The correlation with harder X-ray\nbands is marginally significant. Comparing the new observations with existing\nmodels for the contribution of the known unmasked source population at $z<$7,\nwe find an excess of about an order of magnitude at 5$\\sigma$ confidence. We\ndiscuss possible interpretations for the origin of this excess in terms of the\ncontribution from accreting early black holes, including both direct collapse\nblack holes and primordial black holes, as well as from scattering in the\ninterstellar medium and intra-halo light.\n", "  We report the first direct detection of a strong, 5 kG magnetic field on the\nsurface of an active brown dwarf. LSR J1835+3259 is an M8.5 dwarf exhibiting\ntransient radio and optical emission bursts modulated by fast rotation. We have\ndetected the surface magnetic field as circularly polarized signatures in the\n819 nm sodium lines when an active emission region faced the Earth. Modeling\nStokes profiles of these lines reveals the effective temperature of 2800 K and\nlog gravity acceleration of 4.5. These parameters place LSR J1835+3259 on\nevolutionary tracks as a young brown dwarf with the mass of 55$\\pm$4 M$_{\\rm\nJ}$ and age of 22$\\pm$4 Myr. Its magnetic field is at least 5.1 kG and covers\nat least 11% of the visible hemisphere. The active region topology recovered\nusing line profile inversions comprises hot plasma loops with a vertical\nstratification of optical and radio emission sources. These loops rotate with\nthe dwarf in and out of view causing periodic emission bursts. The magnetic\nfield is detected at the base of the loops. This is the first time that we can\nquantitatively associate brown dwarf non-thermal bursts with a strong, 5 kG\nsurface magnetic field and solve the puzzle of their driving mechanism. This is\nalso the coolest known dwarf with such a strong surface magnetic field. The\nyoung age of LSR J1835+3259 implies that it may still maintain a disk, which\nmay facilitate bursts via magnetospheric accretion, like in higher-mass T\nTau-type stars. Our results pave a path toward magnetic studies of brown dwarfs\nand hot Jupiters.\n", "  We present here VRI spectrophotometry of 39 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs)\nobserved with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing\nTelescope Network (KMTNet). Of the 39 NEAs, 19 were targeted, but because of\nKMTNet's large 2 deg by 2 deg field of view, 20 serendipitous NEAs were also\ncaptured in the observing fields. Targeted observations were performed within\n44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA's discovery date. Our\nbroadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four\nasteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39\nobserved targets as either a S-, C-, X- or D-type asteroid by means of a\nMachine Learning (ML) algorithm approach. Our data suggest that the ratio\nbetween \"stony\" S-type NEAs and \"not-stony\" (C+X+D)-type NEAs, with H\nmagnitudes between 15 and 25, is roughly 1:1. Additionally, we report ~1-hour\nlight curve data for each NEA and of the 39 targets we were able to resolve the\ncomplete rotation period and amplitude for six targets and report lower limits\nfor the remaining targets.\n", "  It has been realized in recent years that the accretion of pebble-sized dust\nparticles onto planetary cores is an important mode of core growth, which\nenables the formation of giant planets at large distances and assists planet\nformation in general. The pebble accretion theory is built upon the orbit\ntheory of dust particles in a laminar protoplanetary disk (PPD). For\nsufficiently large core mass (in the \"Hill regime\"), essentially all particles\nof appropriate sizes entering the Hill sphere can be captured. However, the\nouter regions of PPDs are expected to be weakly turbulent due to the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI), where turbulent stirring of particle\norbits may affect the efficiency of pebble accretion. We conduct shearing-box\nsimulations of pebble accretion with different levels of MRI turbulence\n(strongly turbulent assuming ideal magnetohydrodynamics, weakly turbulent in\nthe presence of ambipolar diffusion, and laminar) and different core masses to\ntest the efficiency of pebble accretion at a microphysical level. We find that\naccretion remains efficient for marginally coupled particles (dimensionless\nstopping time tau_s ~ 0.1 - 1) even in the presence of strong MRI turbulence.\nThough more dust particles are brought toward the core by the turbulence, this\neffect is largely canceled by a reduction in accretion probability. As a\nresult, the overall effect of turbulence on the accretion rate is mainly\nreflected in the changes in the thickness of the dust layer. On the other hand,\nwe find that the efficiency of pebble accretion for strongly coupled particles\n(down to tau_s ~ 0.01) can be modestly reduced by strong turbulence for\nlow-mass cores.\n", "  The magnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) with a ferrimagnetic\ntransition temperature of $\\sim$560 K has been widely used in microwave and\nspintronic devices. Anomalous features in the spin Seeback effect (SSE)\nvoltages have been observed in Pt/YIG and attributed to the magnon-phonon\ncoupling. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering to map out low-energy spin\nwaves and acoustic phonons of YIG at 100 K as a function of increasing magnetic\nfield. By comparing the zero and 9.1 T data, we find that instead of splitting\nand opening up gaps at the spin wave and acoustic phonon dispersion\nintersecting points, magnon-phonon coupling in YIG enhances the hybridized\nscattering intensity. These results are different from expectations of\nconventional spin-lattice coupling, calling for new paradigms to understand the\nscattering process of magnon-phonon interactions and the resulting\nmagnon-polarons.\n", "  We constrain the quasar contribution to cosmic reionization based on our deep\noptical survey of z~6 quasars down to z_R=24.15 using Subaru/Suprime-Cam in\nthree UKIDSS-DXS fields covering 6.5 deg^2. In Kashikawa et al. (2015), we\nselect 17 quasar candidates and report our initial discovery of two\nlow-luminosity quasars (M_1450~ -23) from seven targets, one of which might be\na Lyman alpha emitting galaxy. From an additional optical spectroscopy, none of\nthe four candidates out of the remaining ten turn out to be genuine quasars.\nMoreover, the deeper optical photometry provided by the Hyper Suprime-Cam\nSubaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) shows that, unlike the two already-known\nquasars, the i-z and z-y colors of the last six candidates are consistent with\nM- or L-type brown dwarfs. Therefore, the quasar luminosity function (QLF) in\nthe previous paper is confirmed. Compiling QLF measurements from the literature\nover a wide magnitude range, including an extremely faint AGN candidate from\nParsa et al. (2017}, to fit them with a double power-law, we find that the\nbest-fit faint-end slope is alpha=-2.04^+0.33_-0.18 (-1.98^+0.48_-0.21) and\ncharacteristic magnitude is M_1450^*=-25.8^+1.1_-1.9 (-25.7^+1.0_-1.8) in the\ncase of two (one) quasar detection. Our result suggests that, if the QLF is\nintegrated down to M_1450=-18, quasars produce ~1-12% of the ionizing photons\nrequired to ionize the whole universe at z~6 with 2sigma confidence level,\nassuming that the escape fraction is f_esc=1 and the IGM clumpy factor is C=3.\nEven when the systematic uncertainties are taken into account, our result\nsupports the scenario that quasars are the minor contributors of reionization.\n", "  We revisit the rotation dynamics of a rigid satellite with either a liquid\ncore or a global sub-surface ocean. In both problems, the flow of the fluid\ncomponent is assumed inviscid. The study of a hollow satellite with a liquid\ncore is based on the Poincare-Hough model which provides exact equations of\nmotion. We introduce an approximation when the ellipticity of the cavity is\nlow. This simplification allows to model both types of satellite in the same\nmanner. The analysis of their rotation is done in a non-canonical Hamiltonian\nformalism closely related to Poincare's \"forme nouvelle des equations de la\nmecanique\". In the case of a satellite with a global ocean, we obtain a\nseven-degree of freedom system. Six of them account for the motion of the two\nrigid components, and the last one is associated with the fluid layer. We apply\nour model to Titan for which the origin of the obliquity is still a debated\nquestion. We show that the observed value is compatible with Titan slightly\ndeparting from the hydrostatic equilibrium and being in a Cassini equilibrium\nstate.\n", "  A study of cross sections and azimuthal correlation moments for the inclusive\nproduction of two, light charged hadrons featuring large transverse momenta and\nwell separated in rapidity at LHC energies, including BFKL resummation effects\nwith NLA accuracy, is presented. This reaction shares the same theoretical\nsetup with the well konwn Mueller-Navelet jet production and can be thought of\nas a new and complementary channel to access the BFKL dynamics at proton\ncolliders.\n", "  Star forming galaxies emit GeV- and TeV-gamma rays that are thought to\noriginate from hadronic interactions of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei with the\ninterstellar medium. To understand the emission, we have used the moving mesh\ncode Arepo to perform magneto-hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations with\nself-consistent CR physics. Our galaxy models exhibit a first burst of star\nformation that injects CRs at supernovae. Once CRs have sufficiently\naccumulated in our Milky-Way like galaxy, their buoyancy force overcomes the\nmagnetic tension of the toroidal disk field. As field lines open up, they\nenable anisotropically diffusing CRs to escape into the halo and to accelerate\na bubble-like, CR-dominated outflow. However, these bubbles are invisible in\nour simulated gamma-ray maps of hadronic pion-decay and secondary\ninverse-Compton emission because of low gas density in the outflows. By\nadopting a phenomenological relation between star formation rate (SFR) and\nfar-infrared emission and assuming that gamma rays mainly originate from\ndecaying pions, our simulated galaxies can reproduce the observed tight\nrelation between far-infrared and gamma-ray emission, independent of whether we\naccount for anisotropic CR diffusion. This demonstrates that uncertainties in\nmodeling active CR transport processes only play a minor role in predicting\ngamma-ray emission from galaxies. We find that in starbursts, most of the CR\nenergy is \"calorimetrically\" lost to hadronic interactions. In contrast, the\ngamma-ray emission deviates from this calorimetric property at low SFRs due to\nadiabatic losses, which cannot be identified in traditional one-zone models.\n", "  Planets in close-in orbits interact magnetically and tidally with their host\nstars. These interactions lead to a net torque that makes close-in planets\nmigrate inward or outward depending on their orbital distance. We compare\nsystematically the strength of magnetic and tidal torques for typical observed\nstar-planet systems (T-Tauri & hot Jupiter, M dwarf & Earth-like planet, K star\n& hot Jupiter) based on state-of-the-art scaling-laws. We find that depending\non the characteristics of the system, tidal or magnetic effects can dominate.\nFor very close-in planets, we find that both torques can make a planet migrate\non a timescale as small as 10 to 100 thousands of years. Both effects thus have\nto be taken into account when predicting the evolution of compact systems.\n", "  The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nhas provided unique observations of off-limb flare emission. White-light (WL)\ncontinuum enhancements were detected in the \"continuum\" channel of the Fe 6173\nA line during the impulsive phase of the observed flares. In this paper we aim\nto determine which radiation mechanism is responsible for such an enhancement\nbeing seen above the limb, at chromospheric heights around or below 1000 km.\nUsing a simple analytical approach, we compare two candidate mechanisms, the\nhydrogen recombination continuum (Paschen) and the Thomson continuum due to\nscattering of disk radiation on flare electrons. Both mechanisms depend on the\nelectron density, which is typically enhanced during the impulsive phase of a\nflare as the result of collisional ionization (both thermal and also\nnon-thermal due to electron beams). We conclude that for electron densities\nhigher than $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the Paschen recombination continuum\nsignificantly dominates the Thomson scattering continuum and there is some\ncontribution from the hydrogen free-free emission. This is further supported by\ndetailed radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations of the flare chromosphere\nheated by the electron beams. We use the RHD code FLARIX to compute the\ntemporal evolution of the flare heating in a semi-circular loop. The\nsynthesized continuum structure above the limb resembles the off-limb flare\nstructures detected by HMI, namely their height above the limb, as well as the\nradiation intensity. These results are consistent with recent findings related\nto hydrogen Balmer continuum enhancements, which were clearly detected in disk\nflares by the IRIS near-ultraviolet spectrometer.\n", "  Asteroids that follow similar orbits may have a dynamical connection as their\ncurrent paths could be the result of a past interaction with a massive\nperturber. The pair of extreme trans-Neptunian objects or ETNOs (474640) 2004\nVN112-2013 RF98 exhibits peculiar relative orbital properties, including a\ndifference in longitude of the ascending node of just 1.61 degrees and 3.99\ndegrees in inclination. In addition, their reflectance spectra are similar in\nthe visible portion of the spectrum. The origin of these similarities remains\nunclear. Neglecting observational bias, viable scenarios that could explain\nthis level of coincidence include fragmentation and binary dissociation. Here,\nwe present results of extensive direct N-body simulations of close encounters\nbetween wide binary ETNOs and one trans-Plutonian planet. We find that wide\nbinary ETNOs can dissociate during such interactions and the relative orbital\nproperties of the resulting unbound couples match reasonably well those of\nseveral pairs of known ETNOs, including 474640-2013 RF98. The possible presence\nof former binaries among the known ETNOs has strong implications for the\ninterpretation of the observed anisotropies in the distributions of the\ndirections of their orbital poles and perihelia.\n", "  In order to analyze non-Markovianity of tripartite quantum states from a\nresource theoretical viewpoint, we introduce a class of quantum operations\nperformed by three distant parties, and investigate an operational resource\ntheory (ORT) induced it. A tripartite state is a free state if and only if it\nis a quantum Markov chain. We prove monotonicity of functions such as the\nconditional quantum mutual information, intrinsic information, squashed\nentanglement, a generalization of entanglement of purification, and the\nrelative entropy of recovery. The ORT has five bound sets, each of which\ncorresponds to one of the monotone functions. We introduce a task of\n\"non-Markovianity dilution\", and prove that the optimal rate for the task,\nnamely the \"non-Markovianity cost\", is bounded from above by entanglement of\npurification in the case of pure states. We also propose a classical resource\ntheory of non-Markovianity.\n", "  In this paper, we propose to estimate the spatial curvature of the universe\nand the cosmic opacity in a model-independent way with expansion rate\nmeasurements, $H(z)$, and type Ia supernova (SNe Ia). On the one hand, using a\nnonparametric smoothing method Gaussian process, we reconstruct a function\n$H(z)$ from opacity-free expansion rate measurements. Then, we integrate the\n$H(z)$ to obtain distance modulus $\\mu_{\\rm H}$, which is dependent on the\ncosmic curvature. On the other hand, distances of SNe Ia can be determined by\ntheir photometric observations and thus are opacity-dependent. In our analysis,\nby confronting distance moduli $\\mu_{\\rm H}$ with those obtained from SNe Ia,\nwe achieve estimations for both the spatial curvature and the cosmic opacity\nwithout any assumptions for the cosmological model. Here, it should be noted\nthat light curve fitting parameters, accounting for the distance estimation of\nSNe Ia, are determined in a global fit together with the cosmic opacity and\nspatial curvature to get rid of the dependence of these parameters on\ncosmology. In addition, we also investigate whether the inclusion of different\npriors for the present expansion rate ($H_0$: global estimation, $67.74\\pm\n0.46~\\rm km~ s^{-1} ~Mpc^{-1}$, and local measurement, $73.24\\pm 1.74~\\rm km~\ns^{-1} ~Mpc^{-1}$) exert influence on the reconstructed $H(z)$ and the\nfollowing estimations of the spatial curvature and cosmic opacity. Results show\nthat, in general, a spatially flat and transparent universe is preferred by the\nobservations. Moreover, it is suggested that priors for $H_0$ matter a lot.\nFinally, we find that there is a strong degeneracy between the curvature and\nthe opacity.\n", "  We present results from a study of seven large known head-tail radio galaxies\nbased on observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 240 and 610\nMHz. These observations are used to study the radio morphologies and\ndistribution of the spectral indices across the sources. The overall morphology\nof the radio tails of these sources is suggestive of random motions of the\noptical host around the cluster potential. The presence of the multiple bends\nan d wiggles in several head-tail sources is possibly due to the precessing\nradio jets. We find steepening of the spectral index along the radio tails. The\nprevailing equipartition magnetic field also decreases a long the radio tails\nof these sources. These steepening trends are attributed to the synchrotron\naging of plasma toward the ends of the tails. The dynamical ages of these\nsample sources have been estimated to be ~100 Myr, which is a factor of six\nmore than the age estimates from the radiative losses due to synchrotron\ncooling.\n", "  We carry out a dedicated study of 3XMM J181923.7$-$170616\\ with an\napproximate pulsation period of 400~s using the XMM-Newton and Swift\nobservations spanning across nine years. We have refined the period of the\nsource to 407.904(7) s (at epoch MJD 57142) and determined a period derivative\nlimit of $\\dot{P}{\\leq} 5.9\\pm 5.4\\times 10^{-9} s s^{-1}$ ($1\\sigma$). The\nsource radiates hard, persistent X-ray emission during the observation epochs,\nwhich is best described by an absorbed \\powerlaw\\ model ($\\Gamma \\sim\n0.2$--0.8) plus faint Fe lines at 6.4 keV and 6.7 keV. The X-ray flux revealed\na variation within a factor of 2, along with a spectral hardening as the flux\nincreased. The pulse shape is sinusoid-like and the spectral properties of\ndifferent phases do not present significant variation. The absorption N$_H$\n$\\sim 1.3\\times 10^{22} cm^{-2}$ is similar to the total Galactic hydrogen\ncolumn density along the direction, indicating that it is a distant source. A\nsearch for the counterpart in optical and near-infrared surveys reveals a low\nmass K-type giant, while the existence of a Galactic OB supergiant is excluded.\nA symbiotic X-ray binary is the favored nature of 3XMM J181923.7$-$170616 and\ncan essentially explain the low luminosity of ${2.78\\times 10^{34} d_{10}^{2}\nerg s^{-1}}$, slow pulsation, hard X-ray spectrum, and possible K3~III\ncompanion. An alternative explanation of the source is a persistent Be/X-ray\nbinary with a companion star no earlier than B3-type.\n", "  The cosmological origin of carbon, the fourth most abundant element in the\nUniverse, is not well known and matter of heavy debate. We investigate the\nbehavior of C/O to O/H in order to constrain the production mechanism of\ncarbon. We measured emission-line intensities in a spectral range from 1600 to\n10000 \\AA\\ on Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) long-slit spectra of\n18 starburst galaxies in the local Universe. We determined chemical abundances\nthrough traditional nebular analysis and we used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) method to determine where our carbon and oxygen abundances lie in the\nparameter space. We conclude that our C and O abundance measurements are\nsensible. We analyzed the behavior of our sample in the [C/O] vs. [O/H] diagram\nwith respect to other objects such as DLAs, neutral ISM measurements, and disk\nand halo stars, finding that each type of object seems to be located in a\nspecific region of the diagram. Our sample shows a steeper C/O vs. O/H slope\nwith respect to other samples, suggesting that massive stars contribute more to\nthe production of C than N at higher metallicities, only for objects where\nmassive stars are numerous; otherwise intermediate-mass stars dominate the C\nand N production.\n", "  Coatings comprised of carbon nanotubes are very black; that is, characterized\nby low reflectance over a broad wavelength range from the visible to far\ninfrared. Arguably there is no other material that is comparable. This is\nattributable to the intrinsic properties of graphene as well as the morphology\n(density, thickness, disorder, tube size) of the coating. The need for black\ncoatings is persistent for a variety of applications such as baffles and traps\nfor space instruments. Because of the thermal properties, nanotube coatings are\nalso well suited for thermal detectors, blackbodies and other applications\nwhere light is trapped and converted to heat. We briefly describe a history of\nother coatings such as nickel phosphorous, gold black and carbon-based paints\nand the comparable structural morphology that we associate with very black\ncoatings. In many cases, it is a significant challenge to put the blackest\ncoating on something useful. We describe the growth of carbon nanotube forests\non substrates such as metals and silicon along with the catalyst requirements\nand temperature limitations. We also describe coatings derived from carbon\nnanotubes and applied like paint. Another significant challenge is that of\nbuilding the measurement apparatus and determining the optical properties of\nsomething having negligible reflectance. There exists information in the\nliterature for effective media approximations to model the dielectric function\nof vertically aligned arrays. We summarize this as well as other approaches\nthat are useful for predicting the coating behavior along with the refractive\nindex of graphite from the literature that is necessary for the models we know\nof. We provide an appendix of our best recipes for making as-grown, sprayed or\nother coatings for the blackest and most robust coating for a chosen substrate\nand a description of reflectance measurements.\n", "  Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of stellar population synthesis\nmodels is an important and popular way to constrain the physical parameters\n---e.g., the ages, metallicities, masses for stellar population analysis. The\nprevious works suggest that both blue-bands and red-bands photometry works for\nthe SED-fitting. Either blue-domained or red-domained SED-fitting usually lead\nto the unreliable or biased results. Meanwhile, it seems that extending the\nwavelength coverage could be helpful. Since the Galaxy Evolution Explorer ({\\it\nGALEX}) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) provide the FUV/NUV and\nmid-infrared $W1$/$W2$ band data, we extend the SED-fitting to a wider\nwavelength coverage. In our work, we analyzed the effect of adding the FUV/NUV\nand $W1$/$W2$ band to the optical and near-infrared $UBVRIJHK$ bands for the\nfitting with the Bruzual \\& Charlot 2003 (BC03) models and {\\sc galev} models.\nIt is found that the FUV/NUV bands data affect the fitting results of both ages\nand metallicities much more significantly than that of the WISE $W1$/$W2$ band\nwith the BC03 models. While for the {\\sc galev} models, the effect of the WISE\n$W1$/$W2$ band for the metallicity fitting seems comparable to that of {\\it\nGALEX} FUV/NUV bands, but for age the effect of the $W1$/$W2$ band seems less\ncrucial than that of the FUV/NUV bands. Thus we conclude that the {\\it GALEX}\nFUV/NUV bands are more crucial for the SED-fitting of ages and metallicities,\nthan the other bands, and the high-quality UV data (with high photometry\nprecision) are required.\n", "  The most frequently seen binary companions to millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are\nhelium white dwarfs (He WDs). The standard rejuvenation mechanism, in which a\nlow- to intermediate-mass companion to a neutron star fills its Roche lobe\nbetween central hydrogen exhaustion and core helium ignition, is the most\nplausible formation mechanism. We have investigated whether the observed\npopulation can realistically be formed via this mechanism. We used the\nCambridge STARS code to make models of Case B RLOF with Reimers' mass loss from\nthe donor. We find that the range of initial orbital periods required to\nproduce the currently observed range of orbital periods of MSPs is extremely\nnarrow. To reduce this fine tuning, we introduce a companion enhanced wind\n(CEW) that strips the donor of its envelope more quickly so that systems can\ndetach at shorter periods. Our models indicate that the fine tuning can be\nsignificantly reduced if a CEW is active. Because significant mass is lost\nowing to a CEW we expect some binary pulsars to accrete less than the 0.1Msun\nneeded to spin them up to millisecond periods. This can account for mildly\nrecycled pulsars present along the entire Mc-Porb relation. Systems with Pspin\n> 30ms are consistent with this but too few of these mildly recycled pulsars\nhave yet been observed to make a significant comparison.\n", "  Horseshoe-shaped brightness asymmetries of several transitional discs are\nthought to be caused by large-scale vortices. Anticyclonic vortices are\nefficiently collect dust particles, therefore they can play a major role in\nplanet formation. Former studies suggest that the disc self-gravity weakens\nvortices formed at the edge of the gap opened by a massive planet in discs\nwhose masses are in the range of 0.01<=M_disc/M_*<=0.1. Here we present an\ninvestigation on the long-term evolution of the large-scale vortices formed at\nthe viscosity transition of the discs' dead zone outer edge by means of\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations taking disc self-gravity into account.\nWe perform a numerical study of low mass, 0.001<=M_disc/M_*<=0.01, discs, for\nwhich cases disc self-gravity was previously neglected. The large-scale\nvortices are found to be stretched due to disc self-gravity even for low-mass\ndiscs with M_disc/M_*>=0.005 where initially the Toomre Q-parameter was <=50 at\nthe vortex distance. As a result of stretching, the vortex aspect ratio\nincreases and a weaker azimuthal density contrast develops. The strength of the\nvortex stretching is proportional to the disc mass. The vortex stretching can\nbe explained by a combined action of a non-vanishing gravitational torque\ncaused by the vortex, and the Keplerian shear of the disc. Self-gravitating\nvortices are subject to significantly faster decay than non-self-gravitating\nones. We found that vortices developed at sharp viscosity transitions of\nself-gravitating discs can be described by a GNG model as long as the disc\nviscosity is low, i.e. alpha_dz<=10^-5.\n", "  In this paper we present results of the spectroscopic analysis of H$\\alpha$\nline profile of the Be star 60 Cygni. We present time evolution of the\nequivalent width of the H$\\alpha$ line profiles during years 1992 - 2016 and\n$V/R$ variation during years 1995 - 2016. We analyzed data from Ond\\v{r}ejov\nObservatory and from BeSS Database. The circumstellar disk of the star was\npresent twice during years 1992 - 2016 and the second cycle shows stronger\nemission activity. We found out that the formation of the disk takes longer\ntime than the disk extinction (extinction is much steeper than the formation)\nand that there is no evident period of changes in $V/R$ variation.\n", "  We investigate the large scale matter distribution adopting QSOs as matter\ntracer. The quasar catalogue based on the SDSS DR7 is used. The void finding\nalgorithm is presented and statistical properties of void sizes and shapes are\ndetermined. Number of large voids in the quasar distribution is greater than\nthe number of the same size voids found in the random distribution. The largest\nvoids with diameters exceeding 300 Mpc indicate an existence of comparable size\nareas of lower than the average matter density. No void-void space correlations\nhave been detected, and no larger scale deviations from the uniform\ndistribution are revealed. The average CMB temperature in the directions of the\nlargest voids is lower than in the surrounding areas by 0.0046 +/- 0.0028 mK.\nThis figure is compared to the amplitude of the expected temperature depletion\ncaused by the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect.\n", "  While 2% of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit narrow emission lines with\nline-of-sight velocities that are significantly offset from the velocity of the\nhost galaxy's stars, the nature of these velocity offsets is unknown. We\ninvestigate this question with Chandra/ACIS and Hubble Space Telescope/Wide\nField Camera 3 observations of seven velocity-offset AGNs at z<0.12, and all\nseven galaxies have a central AGN but a peak in emission that is spatially\noffset by < kpc from the host galaxy's stellar centroid. These spatial offsets\nare responsible for the observed velocity offsets and are due to shocks, either\nfrom AGN outflows (in four galaxies) or gas inflowing along a bar (in three\ngalaxies). We compare our results to a velocity-offset AGN whose velocity\noffset originates from a spatially offset AGN in a galaxy merger. The optical\nline flux ratios of the offset AGN are consistent with pure photoionization,\nwhile the optical line flux ratios of our sample are consistent with\ncontributions from photoionization and shocks. We conclude that these optical\nline flux ratios could be efficient for separating velocity-offset AGNs into\nsubgroups of offset AGNs -- which are important for studies of AGN fueling in\ngalaxy mergers -- and central AGNs with shocks -- where the outflows are biased\ntowards the most energetic outflows that are the strongest drivers of feedback.\n", "  Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are short-period pulsars that are distinguished\nfrom \"normal\" pulsars, not only by their short period, but also by their very\nsmall spin-down rates and high probability of being in a binary system. These\nproperties are consistent with MSPs having a different evolutionary history to\nnormal pulsars, viz., neutron-star formation in an evolving binary system and\nspin-up due to accretion from the binary companion. Their very stable periods\nmake MSPs nearly ideal probes of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena. For\nexample, they have been used to detect planets around pulsars, to test the\naccuracy of gravitational theories, to set limits on the low-frequency\ngravitational-wave background in the Universe, and to establish pulsar-based\ntimescales that rival the best atomic-clock timescales in long-term stability.\nMSPs also provide a window into stellar and binary evolution, often suggesting\nexotic pathways to the observed systems. The X-ray accretion-powered MSPs, and\nespecially those that transition between an accreting X-ray MSP and a\nnon-accreting radio MSP, give important insight into the physics of accretion\non to highly magnetised neutron stars.\n", "  The large majority of the accreting supermassive black holes in the Universe\nare obscured by large columns of gas and dust. The location and evolution of\nthis obscuring material have been the subject of intense research in the past\ndecades, and are still highly debated. A decrease in the covering factor of the\ncircumnuclear material with increasing accretion rates has been found by\nstudies carried out across the electromagnetic spectrum. The origin of this\ntrend has been suggested to be driven either by the increase in the inner\nradius of the obscuring material with incident luminosity due to the\nsublimation of dust; by the gravitational potential of the black hole; by\nradiative feedback; or by the interplay between outflows and inflows. However,\nthe lack of a large, unbiased and complete sample of accreting black holes,\nwith reliable information on gas column density, luminosity and mass, has left\nthe main physical mechanism regulating obscuration unclear. Using a systematic\nmulti-wavelength survey of hard X-ray-selected black holes, here we show that\nradiation pressure on dusty gas is indeed the main physical mechanism\nregulating the distribution of the circumnuclear material. Our results imply\nthat the bulk of the obscuring dust and gas in these objects is located within\nthe sphere of influence of the black hole (i.e., a few to tens of parsecs), and\nthat it can be swept away even at low radiative output rates. The main physical\ndriver of the differences between obscured and unobscured accreting black holes\nis therefore their mass-normalized accretion rate.\n", "  The X-ray emission from bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is believed to\noriginate in a hot corona lying above a cold, geometrically thin accretion\ndisk. A highly concentrated corona located within $\\sim10$ gravitational radii\nabove the black hole is inferred from observations. Based on the accretion of\ninterstellar medium/wind, a disk corona model has been proposed in which the\ncorona is well coupled to the disk by radiation, thermal conduction, as well as\nby mass exchange \\citep{Liu2015, Qiao2017}. Such a model avoids artificial\nenergy input to the corona and has been used to interpret the spectral features\nobserved in AGN. In this work, it is shown that the bulk emission size of the\ncorona is very small for the extended accretion flow in our model. More than\n80\\% of the hard X-ray power is emitted from a small region confined within 10\nSchwarzschild radii around a non-spinning black hole, which is expected to be\neven smaller accordingly for a spinning black hole. Here, the corona emission\nis more extended at higher Eddington ratios. The compactness parameter of the\ncorona, $l={L\\over R}{\\sigma_{\\rm T}\\over m_{\\rm e} c^3}$, is shown to be in\nthe range of 1-33 for Eddington ratios of 0.02 - 0.1. Combined with the\nelectron temperature in the corona, this indicates that electron--positron pair\nproduction is not dominant in this regime. A positive relation between the\ncompactness parameter and photon index is also predicted. By comparing the\nabove model predictions with observational features, we find that the model is\nin agreement with observations.\n", "  We present observations showing in-bound long-period comet C/2017 K2\n(PANSTARRS) to be active at record heliocentric distance. Nucleus temperatures\nare too low (60 K to 70 K) either for water ice to sublimate or for amorphous\nice to crystallize, requiring another source for the observed activity. Using\nthe Hubble Space Telescope we find a sharply-bounded, circularly symmetric dust\ncoma 10$^5$ km in radius, with a total scattering cross section of $\\sim$10$^5$\nkm$^2$. The coma has a logarithmic surface brightness gradient -1 over much of\nits surface, indicating sustained, steady-state dust production. A lack of\nclear evidence for the action of solar radiation pressure suggests that the\ndust particles are large, with a mean size $\\gtrsim$ 0.1 mm. Using a coma\nconvolution model, we find a limit to the apparent magnitude of the nucleus $V\n>$ 25.2 (absolute magnitude $H >$ 12.9). With assumed geometric albedo $p_V$ =\n0.04, the limit to the nucleus circular equivalent radius is $<$ 9 km.\nPre-discovery observations from 2013 show that the comet was also active at\n23.7 AU heliocentric distance. While neither water ice sublimation nor\nexothermic crystallization can account for the observed distant activity, the\nmeasured properties are consistent with activity driven by sublimating\nsupervolatile ices such as CO$_2$, CO, O$_2$ and N$_2$. Survival of\nsupervolatiles at the nucleus surface is likely a result of the comet's recent\narrival from the frigid Oort cloud.\n", "  We show that for cubic scalar field theories in five and more spacetime\ndimensions, and for the $T = 0$ limit of the Caldeira-Leggett model, the\nquantum master equation for long-wavelength modes initially unentangled from\nshort-distance modes, and at second order in perturbation theory, contains\ndivergences in the non-Hamiltonian terms. These divergences ensure that the\nequations of motion for expectation values of composite operators closes on\nexpectation values of renormalized operators. Along the way we show that\ninitial \"jolt\" singularities which occur in the equations of motion for\noperators linear in the fundamental variables persist for quadratic operators,\nand are removed if one chooses an initial state projected onto low energies,\nfollowing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n", "  The environmental dependence of the morphology of dwarf galaxies in isolated\nsatellite systems is analyzed to understand the origin of the dwarf galaxy\nmorphology using the visually classified morphological types of 5836 local\ngalaxies with $z \\lesssim 0.01$. We consider six sub-types of dwarf galaxies,\ndS0, dE, dE$_{bc}$, dSph, dE$_{blue}$, and dI, of which the first four\nsub-types are considered as early-type and the last two as late-type. The\nenvironmental parameters we consider are the projected distance from the host\ngalaxy ($r_{p}$), local and global background densities, and the host\nmorphology. The spatial distributions of dwarf satellites of early-type\ngalaxies are much different from those of dwarf satellites of late-type\ngalaxies, suggesting the host morphology combined with $r_{p}$ plays a decisive\nrole on the morphology of the dwarf satellite galaxies. The local and global\nbackground densities play no significant role on the morphology of dwarfs in\nthe satellite systems hosted by early-type galaxies. However, in the satellite\nsystem hosted by late-type galaxies, the global background densities of dE and\ndSph satellites are significantly different from those of dE$_{bc}$,\ndE$_{blue}$, and dI satellites. The blue-cored dwarf satellites (dE$_{bc}$) of\nearly-type galaxies are likely to be located at $r_{p} > 0.3$ Mpc to keep their\ncold gas from the ram pressure stripping by the hot corona of early-type\ngalaxies. The spatial distribution of dE$_{bc}$ satellites of early-type\ngalaxies and their global background densities suggest that their cold gas is\nintergalactic material accreted before they fall into the satellite systems.\n", "  Laser ranging satellites have proved their efficiency for high precision\ntesting of the effect of frame-dragging, one of remarkable predictions of the\nGeneral Relativity. The analysis of the randomness properties of the residuals\nof LAGEOS and LAGEOS 2 satellites reveals the role of the thermal thrust --\nYarkovsky effect -- on the satellite which was in the orbit for longer period\n(LAGEOS). We also compute Earth's tidal modes affecting the satellite LARES.\nThe recently obtained 5\\% accuracy limit reached for the frame dragging effect\nbased on the 3.5 year data of LARES analysed together with those of LAGEOS\nsatellites and using the Earth gravity model of GRACE satellite, is also\nrepresented.\n", "  The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE on the line with odd and periodic boundary\nconditions and with parameter $\\nu=0.1212$ is considered. We give a\ncomputer-assisted proof the existence of symbolic dynamics and countable\ninfinity of periodic orbits with arbitrary large periods.\n", "  We developed control and visualization programs, YUI and HANA, for High-\nResolution Chopper spectrometer (HRC) installed at BL12 in MLF, J-PARC. YUI is\na comprehensive program to control DAQ-middleware, the accessories, and sample\nenvironment devices. HANA is a program for the data transformation and\nvisualization of inelastic neutron scattering spectra. In this paper, we\ndescribe the basic system structures and unique functions of these programs\nfrom the viewpoint of users.\n", "  The advent and proliferation of social media have led to the development of\nmathematical models describing the evolution of beliefs/opinions in an\necosystem composed of socially interacting users. The goal is to gain insights\ninto collective dominant social beliefs and into the impact of different\ncomponents of the system, such as users' interactions, while being able to\npredict users' opinions. Following this thread, in this paper we consider a\nfairly general dynamical model of social interactions, which captures all the\nmain features exhibited by a social system. For such model, by embracing a\nmean-field approach, we derive a diffusion differential equation that\nrepresents asymptotic belief dynamics, as the number of users grows large. We\nthen analyze the steady-state behavior as well as the time dependent\n(transient) behavior of the system. In particular, for the steady-state\ndistribution, we obtain simple closed-form expressions for a relevant class of\nsystems, while we propose efficient semi-analytical techniques in the most\ngeneral cases. At last, we develop an efficient semi-analytical method to\nanalyze the dynamics of the users' belief over time, which can be applied to a\nremarkably large class of systems.\n", "  Atomically thin materials such as graphene are uniquely responsive to charge\ntransfer from adjacent materials, making them ideal charge transport layers in\nphototransistor devices. Effective implementation of organic semiconductors as\na photoactive layer would open up a multitude of applications in biomimetic\ncircuitry and ultra-broadband imaging but polycrystalline and amorphous thin\nfilms have shown inferior performance compared to inorganic semiconductors.\nHere, we utilize the long-range order in rubrene single crystals to engineer\norganic semiconductor-graphene phototransistors surpassing previously reported\nphoto-gating efficiencies by one order of magnitude. Phototransistors based\nupon these interfaces are spectrally selective to visible wavelengths and,\nthrough photoconductive gain mechanisms, achieve responsivity as large as 10^7\nA/W and a detectivity of 1.5 10^9 Jones at room temperature. These findings\npoint towards implementing low-cost, flexible materials for amplified imaging\nat ultra-low light levels.\n", "  The recent study by Waclawczyk et al. [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 175501\n(2017)] possesses three shortcomings: (i) The analysis misses a key aspect of\nthe LMN equations which makes their Lie-group symmetry results incomplete. In\nparticular, two essential symmetries will break when including this aspect.\n(ii) The statements on the constraints regarding the infinite-dimensional\nsymmetry groups are misleading. (iii) The particular symmetries originating\nsolely from the linearity of the LMN hierarchy violate the classical principle\nof cause and effect and therefore are unphysical. Within this Comment we\npresent a detailed proof to this claim and conclude with the note that the new\nstudy by Waclawczyk et al. gives an unrealistic outlook on deriving invariant\nsymmetry solutions for velocity correlations that arise from intermittent\nprocesses.\n", "  The dependence of the frequency distributions due to multiple meanings of\nwords in a text is investigated by deleting letters. By coding the words with\nfewer letters the number of meanings per coded word increases. This increase is\nmeasured and used as an input in a predictive theory. For a text written in\nEnglish, the word-frequency distribution is broad and fat-tailed, whereas if\nthe words are only represented by their first letter the distribution becomes\nexponential. Both distribution are well predicted by the theory, as is the\nwhole sequence obtained by consecutively representing the words by the first\nL=6,5,4,3,2,1 letters. Comparisons of texts written by Chinese characters and\nthe same texts written by letter-codes are made and the similarity of the\ncorresponding frequency-distributions are interpreted as a consequence of the\nmultiple meanings of Chinese characters. This further implies that the\ndifference of the shape for word-frequencies for an English text written by\nletters and a Chinese text written by Chinese characters is due to the coding\nand not to the language per se.\n", "  We present proof of principle for a two way interplay between physics at very\nearly Universe and late time observations. We find a relation between\nprimordial mechanisms responsible for large scale power suppression in the\nprimordial power spectrum and the value of reionization optical depth $\\tau$.\nSuch mechanisms can affect the estimation of $\\tau$. We show that using future\nmeasurements of $\\tau$, one can obtain constraints on the pre-inflationary\ndynamics, providing a new window on the physics of the very early Universe.\nFurthermore, the new, re-estimated $\\tau$ can potentially resolve moderate\ndiscrepancy between high and low-$\\ell$ measurements of $\\tau$, hence providing\nempirical support for the power suppression anomaly and its primordial origin.\n", "  The spiral structure of the Milky Way can be simulated by adopting\npercolation theory, where the active zones are produced by the evolution of\nmany supernova (SN). Here we assume conversely that the percolative process is\ntriggered by superbubbles (SB), the result of multiple SNs. A first thermal\nmodel takes into account a bursting phase which evolves in a medium with\nconstant density, and a subsequent adiabatic expansion which evolves in a\nmedium with decreasing density along the galactic height. A second cold model\nfollows the evolution of an SB in an auto-gravitating medium in the framework\nof the momentum conservation in a thin layer. Both the thermal and cold models\nare compared with the results of numerical hydro-dynamics. A simulation of\nGW~46.4+5.5, the Gould Belt, and the Galactic Plane is reported. An elementary\ntheory of the image, which allows reproducing the hole visible at the center of\nthe observed SB, is provided.\n", "  The lattice Landau gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature is computed\nincluding the non-zero Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the\nK\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann representation is inverted and the corresponding spectral\ndensity evaluated using a Tikhonov regularisation together with the Morozov\ndiscrepancy principle. Implications for gluon confinement are discussed.\n", "  The US Department of Energy decided in 2000 to treat its sodium-bonded spent\nnuclear fuel, produced for experiments on breeder reactors, with an\nelectrochemical process. The metallic waste produced is to be cast into ingots\nand the salt waste further processed to form a ceramic waste form for disposal\nin a mined repository. However, alternative disposal pathways for metallic and\nsalt waste streams are being investigated that may reduce the processing\ncomplexity. As summarized here, performance assessments analyzing the direct\ndisposal the salt waste demonstrate that both mined repositories in salt and\ndeep boreholes in basement crystalline rock can easily accommodate the salt\nwaste. Also summarized here is an analysis of the feasibility of transporting\nthe salt waste in a proposed vessel. The vessel is viable for transport to and\ndisposal in a generic mined repository in salt or deep borehole but a portion\nof the salt waste would need to be diluted for disposal in the Waste Isolation\nPilot Plant. The generally positive results continue to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of direct disposal of salt waste after electrochemical processing\nof spent nuclear fuel.\n", "  We construct Lie algebras of vector fields on universal bundles\n$\\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ of symmetric squares of hyperelliptic curves of genus\n$g=1,2,\\dots$, where $g=\\left[\\frac{N-1}{2}\\right], \\ N=3,4,\\ldots$. For each\nof these Lie algebras, the Lie subalgebra of vertical fields has commuting\ngenerators, while the generators of the Lie subalgebra of projectable fields\ndetermines the canonical representation of the Lie subalgebra with generators\n$L_{2q}$, $q=-1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, of the Witt algebra. We give explicitly a\nbi-rational equivalence of the space $\\mathcal{E}^2_{N,0}$ and $\\bbbC^{N+1}$\n(in the case $N=5$ it is a well known result of Dubrovin and Novikov) and\nconstruct a polynomial Lie algebra on $\\bbbC^{N+1}$, which contains two\ncommuting generators. These commuting generators results in two compatible\npolynomial dynamical systems on $\\bbbR^4$, which possess two common polynomial\nfirst integrals. Moreover, these systems are Hamiltonian and thus Liouville\nintegrable. Using Abel-Jacobi two point map the solutions of these systems can\nbe given in terms of functions defined on universal covering of the universal\nbundle of the Jacobians of the curves. These functions are not Abelian if $g\\ne\n2$. Finally we give explicit solutions of the constructed Hamiltonian systems\non $\\bbbR^4$ in the cases $N=3,4,5$.\n", "  Many physicists believe that the EPR experiment exhibits instantaneous\nnon-local effects. I argue below that an application of Born's Rule to EPR\nshows no such instantaneous effects and that EPR is consistent with full\nLorentz invariance. I then discuss how it is possible to understand the EPR\ncorrelations for non-commuting spin components without recourse to non-local\neffects. Finally, I use these results to discuss the Free Will Theorem, which I\nformulate in a new way.\n", "  Complex assemblies of light-emitting polymer nanofibers with molecular\nmaterials exhibiting optical gain can lead to important advance to amorphous\nphotonics and to random laser science and devices. In disordered mats of\nnanofibers, multiple scattering and waveguiding might interplay to determine\nlocalization or spreading of optical modes as well as correlation effects. Here\nwe study electrospun fibers embedding a lasing fluorene-carbazole-fluorene\nmolecule and doped with titania nanoparticles, which exhibit random lasing with\nsub-nm spectral width and threshold of about 9 mJ cm^-2 for the absorbed\nexcitation fluence. We focus on the spatial and spectral behavior of optical\nmodes in the disordered and non-woven networks, finding evidence for the\npresence of modes with very large spatial extent, up to the 100\nmicrometer-scale. These findings suggest emission coupling into integrated\nnanofiber transmission channels as effective mechanism for enhancing spectral\nselectivity in random lasers and correlations of light modes in the complex and\ndisordered material.\n", "  This PhD thesis is devoted to the low-energy structure of the nucleon (proton\nand neutron) as seen through electromagnetic probes, e.g., electron and Compton\nscattering. The research presented here is based primarily on dispersion theory\nand chiral effective-field theory. The main motivation is the recent proton\nradius puzzle, which is the discrepancy between the classic proton charge\nradius determinations (based on electron-proton scattering and normal hydrogen\nspectroscopy) and the highly precise extraction based on first muonic-hydrogen\nexperiments by the CREMA Collaboration. The precision of muonic-hydrogen\nexperiments is presently limited by the knowledge of proton structure effects\nbeyond the charge radius. A major part of this thesis is devoted to calculating\nthese effects using everything we know about the nucleon electromagnetic\nstructure from both theory and experiment.\n  The thesis consists of eight chapters. The first and last are, respectively,\nthe introduction and conclusion. The remainder of this thesis can roughly be\ndivided into the following three topics: finite-size effects in hydrogen-like\natoms, real and virtual Compton scattering, and two-photon-exchange effects.\n", "  MicroBooNE is a liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino\nexperiment that is currently running in the Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab.\nLArTPC technology allows for high-resolution, three-dimensional representations\nof neutrino interactions. A wide variety of software tools for automated\nreconstruction and selection of particle tracks in LArTPCs are actively being\ndeveloped. Short, isolated proton tracks, the signal for low- momentum-transfer\nneutral current (NC) elastic events, are easily hidden in a large cosmic\nbackground. Detecting these low-energy tracks will allow us to probe\ninteresting regions of the proton's spin structure. An effective method for\nselecting NC elastic events is to combine a highly efficient track\nreconstruction algorithm to find all candidate tracks with highly accurate\nparticle identification using a machine learning algorithm. We present our work\non particle track classification using gradient tree boosting software\n(XGBoost) and the performance on simulated neutrino data.\n", "  Bismuth has been the key element in the discovery and development of\ntopological insulator materials. Previous theoretical studies indicated that Bi\nis topologically trivial and it can transform into the topological phase by\nalloying with Sb. However, recent high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements strongly suggested a topological band\nstructure in pure Bi. To address this issue, we study the band structure of Bi\nand Sb films by ARPES and first-principles calculations. By tuning tight\nbinding parameters, we show that Bi quantum films in topologically trivial and\nnontrivial phases response differently to surface perturbations. Therefore, we\nestablish an experimental route for detecting the band topology of Bi by\nspectroscopic methods. In addition, our circular dichroic photoemission\nilluminates the rich surface states and complex spin texture of the Bi(111)\nsurface.\n", "  Analyzing shareability of correlations arising in any physical theory may be\nconsidered as a fruitful technique of studying the theory. Our present topic of\ndiscussion involves an analogous approach of studying quantum theory. For our\npurpose, we have deviated from the usual procedure of assessing monogamous\nnature of quantum correlations in standard Bell-CHSH scenario. We have\nconsidered correlations arising in a quantum network involving independent\nsources. Precisely speaking, we have analyzed monogamy of nonbilocal\ncorrelations by deriving a relation restricting marginals. Interestingly,\nrestrictions constraining distribution of nonbilocal correlations remain same\nirrespective of whether inputs of the nodal observers are kept fixed(in\ndifferent bilocal networks) while studying nonbilocal nature of marginal\ncorrelations.\n", "  We investigate the quasi-integrability properties of various deformations of\nthe Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, depending on two parameters\n$\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\varepsilon_2$, which include among them the regularized\nlong-wave (RLW) and modified regularized long-wave (mRLW) equations. We show,\nusing analytical and numerical methods, that the charges, constructed from a\ndeformation of the zero curvature equation for the KdV equation, are\nasymptotically conserved for various values of the deformation parameters. By\nthat we mean that, despite the fact that the charges do vary in time during the\nscattering of solitons, they return after the scattering to the same values\nthey had before it. That property was tested numerically for the scattering of\ntwo and three solitons, and analytically for the scattering of two solitons in\nthe mRLW theory ($\\varepsilon_2=\\varepsilon_1=1$). We also show that the Hirota\nmethod leads to analytical one-soliton solutions of our deformed equation for\n$\\varepsilon_1 = 1$, and any value of $\\varepsilon_2$. We also mention some\nproperties of soliton-radiation interactions seen in some of our simulations.\n", "  International Masterclasses are events for high school students that enable\nthem to act as \"particle physicists for day\" by analyzing authentic data from\nparticle physics experiments under the tutelage of scientists. International\nMasterclasses have been very successful and have grown with their focus on data\nfrom the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Recent developments that bring\nmasterclasses to more students in more ways have been very exciting. The number\nof masterclasses and the number of countries with masterclasses have grown\nsubstantially. Outreach efforts such as masterclass workshops in developing\ncountries, particularly in collaboration with the African School of Fundamental\nPhysics and Applications, and a new International Day of Girls and Women in\nScience masterclass have yielded success. Most recently, there are new\ninitiatives to expand masterclasses beyond the LHC, particularly into neutrino\nphysics.\n", "  The spin structure of wave functions is reflected in the magnetic structure\nof the one-particle density matrix. Indeed, for single determinants we can use\neither one to determine the other. In this work we discuss how one can simply\nexamine the one-particle density matrix to faithfully determine whether the\nspin magnetization density vector field is collinear, coplanar, or noncoplanar.\nFor single determinants, this test suffices to distinguish collinear\ndeterminants which are eigenfunctions of $\\hat{S}_{\\hat{n}}$ from noncollinear\ndeterminants which are not. We also point out the close relationship between\nnoncoplanar magnetism on the one hand and complex conjugation symmetry breaking\non the other. Finally, we use these ideas to classify the various ways single\ndeterminant wave functions break and respect symmetries of the Hamiltonian in\nterms of their one-particle density matrix.\n", "  In this work, we propose an interdependent, multilayer network model and\npercolation process that matches infrastructures better than previous models by\nallowing some nodes to survive when their interdependent neighbors fail. We\nconsider a node-to-link failure propagation mechanism and establish \"weak\"\ninterdependence across layers via a tolerance parameter $\\alpha$ which\nquantifies the likelihood that a node survives when one of its interdependent\nneighbors fails. We measure the robustness of any individual layer by the final\nsize of its giant component. Analytical and numerical results show that weak\ninterdependence produces a striking phenomenon: layers at different positions\nwithin the multilayer system experience distinct percolation transitions.\nEspecially, layers with high super degree values percolate in an abrupt manner,\nwhile those with low super degree values exhibit both continuous and abrupt\ntransitions. This novel phenomenon we call \\emph{mixed percolation transitions}\nhas significant implications for network robustness. Previous results that do\nnot consider cascade tolerance and layer super degree may be under- or\nover-estimating the vulnerability of real systems. Moreover, since $\\alpha$\nrepresents a generic measure of various risk management strategies used to\nbuffer infrastructure assets from cascades, our model reveals how nodal\nprotection activities influence failure dynamics in interdependent, multilayer\nsystems.\n", "  Non-bonded potentials are included in most force fields and therefore widely\nused in classical molecular dynamics simulations of materials and interfacial\nphenomena. It is commonplace to truncate these potentials for computational\nefficiency based on the assumption that errors are negligible for reasonable\ncutoffs or compensated for by adjusting other interaction parameters. Arising\nfrom a metadynamics study of the wetting transition of water on a solid\nsubstrate, we find that the influence of the cutoff is unexpectedly strong and\ncan change the character of the wetting transition from continuous to first\norder by creating artificial metastable wetting states. Common cutoff\ncorrections such as the use of a force switching function, a shifted potential,\nor a shifted force do not avoid this. Such a qualitative difference urges\ncaution and suggests that using truncated non-bonded potentials can induce\nunphysical behavior that cannot be fully accounted for by adjusting other\ninteraction parameters.\n", "  By the end of 2014, a cosmic ray muon telescope was installed at Zhongshan\nStation in Antarctic and has been continuously collecting data since then. It\nis the first surface muon telescope to be built in Antarctic. In June 2015,\nfive CMEs were ejected towards the Earth initiating a big large Forbush\ndecrease (FD) event. We conduct a comprehensive study of the galactic cosmic\nray intensity fluctuations during the FD using the data from cosmic ray\ndetectors of multiple stations (Zhongshan, McMurdo, South Polar and Nagoya) and\nhe solar wind measurements from ACE and WIND. A pre-increase before the shock\narrival was observed. Distinct differences exist in the timelines of the\ngalactic cosmic ray recorded by the neutron monitors and the muon telescopes.\nFD onset for Zhongshan muon telescope is delayed (2.5h) with respect to SSC\nonset. This FD had a profile of four-step decrease. The traditional one- or\ntwo-step classification of FDs was inadequate to explain this FD.\n", "  Strangeness production in high multiplicity events gives indications on the\ntransverse size fluctuactions in nucleus-nucleus ($AA$), proton-nucleus ($pA$)\nand proton-proton ($pp$) collisions. In particular the behavior of strange\nparticle hadronization in \"small\" ($pp,pA$) and \"large\" ($AA$) initial\nconfigurations of the collision can be tested for the specific particle\nspecies, for different centralities and for large fluctuations of the\ntransverse size in $pA$ and $pp$ by using the recent ALICE data. A universality\nof strange hadron production emerges by introducing a dynamical variable\nproportional to the initial parton density in the transverse plane.\n", "  Grain Boundaries govern many properties of polycrystalline materials,\nincluding the vast majority of engineering materials. Evolutionary algorithm\ncan be applied to predict the grain boundary structures in different systems.\nHowever, the recognition and classification of thousands of predicted\nstructures is a very challenging work for eye detection in terms of efficiency\nand accuracy. A data pipeline is developed to accelerate the classification and\nrecognition of grain boundary structures predicted by Evolutionary Algorithm.\nThe data pipeline has three main components including feature engineering of\ngrain boundary structures, density-based clustering analysis and parallel\nK-Means clustering analysis. With this data pipeline, we could automate the\nstructure analysis and develop better structural and physical understanding of\ngrain boundaries.\n", "  The behavior of dense mixtures of two topologically different\ndiblock-copolymer (CP) chains, viz., linear(L)-CP and ring(R)-CP of same\nmolecular weight which forms lamellae is studied under confinement by two\nnon-selective substrates. The effect of varying interaction strength between\nL-CP and R-CP, from purely repulsive ({\\it demixed state}) to weakly attractive\n({\\it mixed state}), on the morphology, domain size, chain conformations and\ndistribution of chains in the film are investigated. In the demixed state,\ncollective structure factor $S(q)$ shows a split of the predominant peak\nindicating the presence of two dominant length scales. While there is only one\npredominant peak in the mixed state, and hence a lamellar structure with single\ndomain size. We show that the peak position $q*$ of $S(q)$ can be varied with\nthe L/R interaction strength and thus allow one to control domain size by\ntuning L/R interaction strength without altering the chain size. We further\ncharacterize the chain size and illustrate that this domain size variation is a\nconsequence of the variation in the size of L-CPs. Furthermore, results on the\naverage instantaneous shape of R/L-CP reveal that their shapes are very\ndifferent both in bulk and near the substrate, and R-CP assumes an oblate shape\nnear the substrate. This shape/size difference leads to the segregation of\nR-CPs near the polymer-substrate interface and hence a relatively higher\ndensity of R-CPs at the interface.\n", "  We discuss the constraints on the Standard Model Effective Field Theory\ninferred from global fits to electroweak data. Special attention is paid to two\nunconstrained combinations of Wilson coefficients that are present when the\nanalysis is restricted to measurements of $\\bar\\psi\\psi\\to\\bar\\psi\\psi$\nscatterings. We illustrate how these unconstrained directions arise due to a\nreparameterization invariance that characterizes $\\bar\\psi\\psi\\to\\bar\\psi\\psi$\nprocesses but is not respected in $\\bar\\psi\\psi\\to\\bar\\psi\\psi\\bar\\psi\\psi$\nscatterings. This invariance is independent of the operator basis adopted and\nof the choice of the input parameters. This is verified comparing the results\nobtained in the {$\\hat \\alpha_{em}, \\hat m_Z, \\hat G_F$} input scheme with\nthose of a {$\\hat m_W, \\hat m_Z, \\hat G_F$} scheme.\n", "  The position and motion of \\textit{ideally} non-interacting localized states\nof light in propagative geometries can be controlled via an adequate parameter\nmodulation. Here we show theoretically and experimentally that this process can\nbe accurately described as the phase locking of oscillators to an external\nforcing but that non-reciprocal interactions between light bits can drastically\nmodify this picture. Interactions lead to the convective motion of defects and\nto unlocking as a collective emerging phenomenon.\n", "  Porosity is a key characteristic of the regolith on the surface of small\nbodies. The porosity of the regolith on the surface of asteroids is changed by\napplied pressure, and the relationship between pressure and porosity depends on\nthe particle properties of the regolith. We performed compression measurements\non samples of different materials, particle size distributions, and shapes to\nexamine the relationship between particle size and pressure required for\ncompression. We used a centrifuge and a compression testing machine for the\nexperiments. The applied pressure for the centrifuge and the compression\ntesting machine experiments ranged from 10^2 to 5x10^3 Pa and from 10^4 to\n5x10^6 Pa, respectively. The initial porosity before compression was generally\nhigher for samples with smaller particles and narrower particle size\ndistributions. A sample compressed more easily when it consisted of smaller\nparticles, probably due to smaller frictional forces between particles. We\nestimated the porosity of granular asteroids based on the results of our\nexperiments. The estimated porosity at the center of a homogeneous asteroid\nwith a radius of 50 km is 0.43. This porosity is typical of the porosity of\nasteroids of similar size.\n", "  Recent studies of the nearest star-forming clouds of the Galaxy at\nsubmillimeter wavelengths with the Herschel Space Observatory have provided us\nwith unprecedented images of the initial conditions and early phases of the\nstar formation process. The Herschel images reveal an intricate network of\nfilamentary structure in every interstellar cloud. These filaments all exhibit\nremarkably similar widths - about a tenth of a parsec - but only the densest\nones contain prestellar cores, the seeds of future stars. The Herschel results\nfavor a scenario in which interstellar filaments and prestellar cores represent\ntwo key steps in the star formation process: first turbulence stirs up the gas,\ngiving rise to a universal web-like structure in the interstellar medium, then\ngravity takes over and controls the further fragmentation of filaments into\nprestellar cores and ultimately protostars. This scenario provides new insight\ninto the origin of stellar masses and the star formation efficiency in the\ndense molecular gas of galaxies. Despite an apparent complexity, global star\nformation may be governed by relatively simple universal laws from filament to\ngalactic scales.\n", "  In the review we briefly analyze the state-of-art in the theory of\nflexoelectric phenomena and analyze how significantly the flexoelectric\ncoupling can change the polar order parameter distribution in different\nferroics and liquid crystals. The special attention in paid to the appearance\nof the spatially modulated phases induced by the flexocoupling in condensed and\nsoft matter. Results of theoretical modeling performed in the framework of the\nLandau-Ginzburg-Devonshire formalism revealed that the general feature,\ninherent to both ferroics and liquid crystals, is the appearance of the\nspatially-modulated phases is taking place with increasing of the flexocoupling\nstrength. We'd like to underline that theoretical and experimental study of\nflexoelectricity and related phenomena in nanosized and bulk ferroics, liquid\ncrystals and related materials are very important for their advanced\napplications in nanoelectronics, memory devices and LC displays.\n", "  We generalize the notions of the non-commutative Poincar\\'e and modified\nlog-Sobolev inequalities for primitive quantum Markov semigroups (QMS) to not\nnecessarily primitive ones. These two inequalities provide estimates on the\ndecoherence time of the evolution. More precisely, we focus on an algebraic\ndefinition of environment-induced decoherence in open quantum systems which\nhappens to be generic on finite dimensional systems and describes the\nasymptotic behavior of any QMS. An essential tool in our analysis is the\nexplicit structure of the decoherence-free algebra generated by the QMS, a\ncentral object in the study of passive quantum error correction schemes. The\nPoincar\\'e constant corresponds to the spectral gap of the QMS, which implies\nits positivity, while we prove that the modified log-Sobolev constant is\npositive under the $\\mathbb L_1$-regularity of the Dirichlet form, a condition\nthat also appears in the primitive case. We furthermore prove that strong\n$\\mathbb L_p$-regularity holds for QMS that satisfy a strong form of detailed\nbalance condition for $p\\geq1$. The latter condition includes all known cases\nwhere this strong regularity was proved. Finally and to emphasize the\nmathematical interest of this study compared to the classical case, we focus on\ntwo truly quantum scenarios, one exhibiting quantum coherence, and the other,\nquantum correlations.\n", "  India's largest 3.6 m aperture optical telescope has been successfully\ninstalled in the central Himalayan region at Devasthal, Nainital district,\nUttarakhand. The primary mirror of the telescope uses the active optics\ntechnology. The back-end instruments, enabling spectroscopic and photometric\nimaging of the celestial sky are designed and developed by ARIES along with\nother Indian institutes. The Devasthal optical telescope in synergy with two\nother highly sensitive telescopes in the country, namely GMRT operating in the\nradio wavebands and AstroSat operating in the high-energy X-ray, ultraviolet\nand visual wavebands, will enable Indian astronomers to carry out scientific\nstudies in several challenging areas of astronomy and astrophysics.\n", "  Direct growth of flat micrometer-sized bilayer graphene islands in between\nmolybdenum disulfide sheets is achieved by chemical vapor deposition of\nethylene at about 800 {\\deg}C. The temperature assisted decomposition of\nethylene takes place mainly at molybdenum disulfide step edges. The carbon\natoms intercalate at this high temperature, and during the deposition process,\nthrough defects of the molybdenum disulfide surface such as steps and wrinkles.\nPost growth atomic force microscopy images reveal that circular flat graphene\nislands have grown at a high yield. They consist of two graphene layers stacked\non top of each other with a total thickness of 0.74 nm. Our results demonstrate\ndirect, simple and high yield growth of graphene/molybdenum disulfide\nheterostructures, which can be of high importance in future nanoelectronic and\noptoelectronic applications.\n", "  Suspensions of micro and nano particles made of Polystyrene, Poly(methyl\nmethacrylate), Silicon dioxide etc. have been a standard model system to\nunderstand colloidal physics. . These systems have proved useful insights into\nphenomena such as self-assembly. Colloidal model systems are also extensively\nused to simulate many condensed matter phenomena such as dynamics in a quenched\ndisordered system and glass transition. A precise control of particles using\noptical or holographic tweezers is essential for such studies. However, studies\nof collective phenomena such as jamming and flocking behaviour in a disordered\nspace are limited due to the low throughput of the optical trapping\ntechniques.In this article, we present a technique where we trap and pin\npolystyrene microspheres ~ 10 {\\mu}m over triangular-crest shaped\nmicrostructures in a microfluidic environment. Trapping/Pinning occurs due to\nthe combined effect of hydrodynamic interaction and non-specific adhesion\nforces. This method allows trapping and pinning of microspheres in any\narbitrary pattern with a high degree of spatial accuracy which can be useful in\nstudying fundamentals of various collective phenomena as well as in\napplications such as bead detachment assay based biosensors.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for probing the strength of the possible matter\nnonstandard neutrino interactions (mNSI) in long baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments and the interference of the leptonic CP angle $\\delta_{CP}$ with\nthe constraining of the mNSI couplings. The interference is found to be strong\nin the case of the $\\nu_e \\leftrightarrow \\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_e \\leftrightarrow\n\\nu_\\tau$ transitions but not significant in the other cases. We use SPS and\nDUNE setups as benchmarks.\n", "  Using the hypernetted-chain/mean spherical approximation (HNC/MSA) integral\nequations we study the electrical double layer inside and outside a model\ncharged cylindrical vesicle (nanopore) immersed into a primitive model\nmacroions solution, so that the macroions are only present outside the\nnanopore, i.e., the vesicle wall is impermeable only to the external macroions.\nWe calculate the ionic and local linear charge density profiles inside and\noutside the vesicle, and find that the correlation between the inside and\noutside ionic distributions causes the phenomena of overcharging (also referred\nto as surface charge amplification) and/or charge reversal. This is the first\ntime overcharging is predicted in an electrical double layer of cylindrical\ngeometry. We also report the new phenomenon of double overcharging. The present\nresults can be of consequence for relevant systems in physical-chemistry,\nenergy storage and biology, e.g., nanofilters, capacitors and cell membranes.\n", "  The interaction between oil and foam has been the subject of various studies.\nIndeed, oil can be an efficient defoaming agent, which can be highly valuable\nin various industrial applications where undesired foaming may occur, as seen\nin jet-dyeing processes or waste water treatment plant. However, oil and foam\ncan also constructively interact as observed in detergency, fire-fighting, food\nand petroleum industries, where oil can be in the foam structure or put into\ncontact with the foam without observing a catastrophic break-up of the foam.\nUnder specific physico-chemistry conditions, the oil phase can even be trapped\ninside the aqueous network of the foam, thus providing interesting complex\nmaterials made of three different fluid phases that we name oil-laden foam\n(OLF). In this review, we focus on such systems, with a special emphasis on dry\nOLF, i.e. with a total liquid volume fraction, $\\varepsilon$ smaller than 5%.\nWe first try to clarify the physical and chemical conditions for these systems\nto appear, we review the different techniques of the literature to obtain them.\nThen we discuss their structure and identify two different OLF morphologies,\nnamed foamed emulsion, in which small oil globules are comprised within the\nnetwork of the aqueous foam and biliquid foams, where the oil also comprised in\nthe aqueous foam network is continuous at the scale of several bubbles. Last,\nwe review the state of the art of their evolution in particular concerning\ntopological changes, coalescence, coarsening and drainage.\n", "  We illustrate in this contribution the progress in the theoretical study of\nliquid metals made in the last decades, starting from the example of liquid\ngallium and the early work in Jean-Pierre Badiali's group. This was based on\nthe combination of the perturbation theory with pseudo-potentials for the\nelectrons and the liquid state theory for the ions. More recent developments\ncombining ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations are finally\nillustrated on the example of glass forming alloys.\n", "  We consider a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger system arising in a two-component\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with attractive intraspecies interactions and\nrepulsive interspecies interactions in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We get ground states of\nthis system by solving a constrained minimization problem. For some kinds of\ntrapping potentials, we prove that the minimization problem has a minimizer if\nand only if the attractive interaction strength $a_i (i=1,2)$ of each component\nof the BEC system is strictly less than a threshold $a^*$. %attractive\nintraspecies interactions satisfies $a_i< %a^*= \\|Q\\|_2^2,\\ i=1,\\,2$, where $Q$\nis the unique positive radial solution of $\\Delta u-u+u^3=0$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$;\nin contrast, there is no minimizer if either $a_i > a^*$ for $i=1$ or $2$, or\n$a_1=a_2=a^*$. Furthermore, as $(a_1, a_2)\\nearrow (a^*, a^*)$, the\nasymptotical behavior for the minimizers of the minimization problem is\ndiscussed. Our results show that each component of the BEC system concentrates\nat a global minimum of the associated trapping potential.\n", "  We consider a 2-1 electrolyte in contact with a narrow nanotube, which only\nallows one-dimensional storage along the axis. The asymmetry does not allow an\na priori definition of the potential of zero charge; instead, the natural\nreference is the electrode potential at which both ions have the same\nelectrochemical potential; the value of the latter can serve as a measure of\nionophilicity. Near this potential, ionophobic tubes are filled with a dilute\ngas, ionophilic tubes are filled with a one-dimensional solid containing about\nthe same number of the divalent ions and the monovalent counterions, a\nstructure that is stabilized by a strong screening of the Coulomb interaction\nby an induced counter charge on the walls of the tube. The filling of the tube\nby the application of an electrode potential exhibits a complicated pattern of\ninteractions between the two kinds of ions.\n", "  The systems of molecules with a permanent dipole moment have solid phases\nwith various crystal symmetries. In particular, the solid phases of the\nsimplest of these systems, the dipolar hard sphere model, have been extensively\nstudied in the literature. The article presents Monte Carlo simulation results\nwhich, at low temperature, point to the stability of a polarized solid phase of\ndipolar hard spheres with the unusual number of eleven nearest neighbors, the\nso-called primitive tetragonal packing or tetragonal close packing.\n", "  The SPT2 approach is based on the scaled particle theory and developed for\nthe description of thermodynamic properties of hard sphere (HS) fluids in\ndisordered porous media. Using this approach a porous medium is modelled as a\nquenched matrix of hard spheres (HS) or overlapping hard spheres (OHS). A hard\nsphere fluid immersed in a matrix can move in a void between matrix particles.\nA number of approximations were previously proposed within the SPT2 approach.\nAmong these approximations, the SPT2b1 has been considered as the most\nsuccessful and accurate one in a large range of fluid densities and for\ndifferent matrix parameters. However, at high densities, it can lack accuracy,\nsince it does not take into account that the maximum packing fraction of a HS\nfluid in a matrix is limited, not by the geometrical porosity of a matrix\n$\\phi_{0}$ and the probe particle porosity $\\phi$, but by another type of\nporosity $\\phi^{*}$ introduced in our previous studies. The porosity $\\phi^{*}$\nis related to the maximal adsorption capacity of a matrix and it is lower than\n$\\phi_{0}$ and larger than $\\phi$. This can be crucial for a fluid in matrices\nof low porosities and at high fluid density, especially in the region near\nclose-packing conditions. Therefore, the approximations SPT2b2 and SPT2b3\ntaking into account this feature were suggested, although they still needed a\ncorrection because of their poor accuracy. In the present study, we improved\nthe versions of these approximations, named as SPT2b2$^*$ and SPT2b3$^*$. We\ncompare these different approximations with the results of computer simulations\nperformed in the Monte Carlo grand-canonical ensemble. We test the SPT2\napproach both for the one- and three-dimensional cases. We show that the\nSPT2b3$^*$ provides a very good description of the chemical potential of a\nconfined fluid, which is better than others.\n", "  We investigate how the Fine-Tuning (FT) in the B-L Supersymmetric Standard\nModel (BLSSM) compares to the Minimally Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM),\nwhere both models have universality. This is done for two scales: both low\n(i.e. collider) and high (i.e. Grand Unified Theory (GUT)) scales. We see this\nis similar for both models and the two scale regimes. We also study the\npossible Dark Matter (DM) candidates each model offers in a realistic scenario\nsatisfying relic density constraints. Our findings are that whilst the\nparameter space for the single MSSM DM candidate is severely constrained, the\nBLSSM offers multiple candidates in a much wider region.\n", "  The properties of one-dimensional liquids are studied for several interaction\npotentials for which, under certain assumptions, the properties of the system\nadmit an analytical solution. The studied potentials are the triangle-well and\nthe ramp potential, and then we use the knowledge of these ones to study the\nhard-rod and the sticky-hard-rod potentials. For each one of these potentials,\nwe study its equation of state and other thermodynamic quantities such as the\ncompressibility factor and the internal energy. Then, we study its correlation\nfunctions, such as the radial distribution function, the structure factor and\nthe direct correlation function. For the latter one, the approximations known\nas Percus--Yevick and hypernetted-chain have been compared to the analytical\nresult. Finally, the asymptotic behaviour of the radial distribution function\nis studied and the Fisher--Widom line computed for the triangle-well potential.\n", "  As shown by Wrobel et al. (2017), the hydraulically induced tangential\ntraction on fracture walls changes local displacement and stress fields. This\nresulted in the formulation of a new hydraulic fracture (HF) propagation\ncondition based on the critical value of the energy release rate that accounts\nfor the hydraulically-induced shear stress. Therefore it is clear that the\ncrack direction criteria, which depend on the tip distributions of the stress\nand strain fields, need to be changed. We analyse the two commonly used\ncriteria, one based on the maximum circumferential stress (MCS) and another -\non the minimum strain energy density (MSED). We show that the impact of the\nhydraulically induced shear stress on the direction of the crack propagation is\nnegligible in the case of large material resistance to fracture, while for\nsmall toughness the effect is significant. Moreover, values of the redirection\nangles, corresponding to the so-called viscosity dominated regime, depend\ndramatically on the ratios of the stress intensity factors.\n", "  Wildlife corridors are components of landscapes, which facilitate the\nmovement of organisms and processes between intact habitat areas, and thus\nprovide connectivity between the habitats within the landscapes. Corridors are\nthus regions within a given landscape that connect fragmented habitat patches\nwithin the landscape. The major concern of designing corridors as a\nconservation strategy is primarily to counter, and to the extent possible,\nmitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of\nthe landscape, as well as support continuance of land use for essential local\nand global economic activities in the region of reference. In this paper, we\nuse game theory, graph theory, membership functions and chain code algorithm to\nmodel and design a set of wildlife corridors with tiger (Panthera tigris\ntigris) as the focal species. We identify the parameters which would affect the\ntiger population in a landscape complex and using the presence of these\nidentified parameters construct a graph using the habitat patches supporting\ntiger presence in the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths\nbetween them as edges. The passage of tigers through the possible paths have\nbeen modelled as an Assurance game, with tigers as an individual player. The\ngame is played recursively as the tiger passes through each grid considered for\nthe model. The iteration causes the tiger to choose the most suitable path\nsignifying the emergence of adaptability. As a formal explanation of the game,\nwe model this interaction of tiger with the parameters as deterministic finite\nautomata, whose transition function is obtained by the game payoff.\n", "  Theoretically, we recently showed that the scaling relation between the\ntransition temperature T_c and the superfluid density at zero temperature n_s\n(0) might exhibit a parabolic pattern [Scientific Reports 6 (2016) 23863]. It\nis significantly different from the linear scaling described by Homes' law,\nwhich is well known as a mean-field result. More recently, Bozovic et al. have\nobserved such a parabolic scaling in the overdoped copper oxides with a\nsufficiently low transition temperature T_c [Nature 536 (2016) 309-311]. They\nfurther point out that this experimental finding is incompatible with the\nstandard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) description. Here we report that if\nT_c is sufficiently low, applying the renormalization group approach into the\nBCS action at zero temperature will naturally lead to the parabolic scaling.\nOur result indicates that when T_c sufficiently approaches zero, quantum\nfluctuations will be overwhelmingly amplified so that the mean-field\napproximation may break down at zero temperature.\n", "  Nanostructured materials have emerged as an alternative to enhance the figure\nof merit (ZT) of thermoelectric (TE) devices. Graphene exhibits a high\nelectrical conductivity (in-plane) that is necessary for a high ZT; however,\nthis effect is countered by its impressive thermal conductivity. In this work\nTE layered devices composed of electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) and\na phonon blocking material such as poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene\nsulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), polyaniline (PANI) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) at the\ninterface were prepared. The figure of merit, ZT, of each device was measured\nin the cross-plane direction using the Transient Harman Method (THM) and\ncomplemented with AFM-based measurements. The results show remarkable high ZT\nvalues (0.81 < ZT < 2.45) that are directly related with the topography,\nsurface potential, capacitance gradient and resistance of the devices at the\nnanoscale.\n", "  Quantum observables can be identified with vector fields on the sphere of\nnormalized states. The resulting vector representation is used in the paper to\nundertake a simultaneous treatment of macroscopic and microscopic bodies in\nquantum mechanics. Components of the velocity and acceleration of state under\nSchr\\\"odinger evolution are given for a clear physical interpretation.\nSolutions to Schr\\\"odinger and Newton equations are shown to be related beyond\nthe Ehrenfest results on the motion of averages. A formula relating the normal\nprobability distribution and the Born rule is found.\n", "  We present our recent results about the extended narrow-line region (ENLR) of\ntwo nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies (IC 5063 and NGC 7212) obtained by modelling the\nobserved line profiles and spectra with composite models\n(photoionization+shocks) in the different regions surrounding the AGN. Then, we\ncompare the Seyfert 2 ENLRs with the very extended one recently discovered in\nthe narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxy Mrk 783. We have found several\nevidences of interaction between the ISM of the galaxies and their radio jets,\nsuch as a) the contribution of shocks in ionizing the high velocity gas, b) the\ncomplex kinematics showed by the profile of the emission lines, c) the high\nfragmentation of matter, etc. The results suggest that the ENLR of IC 5063 have\na hollow bi-conical shape, with one edge aligned to the galaxy disk, which may\ncause some kind of dependence on velocity of the ionization parameter.\nRegarding the Mrk 783 properties, it is found that the extension of the optical\nemission is almost twice the size of the radio one and it seems due to the AGN\nactivity, although there is contamination by star formation around 12 arcsec\nfrom the nucleus. Diagnostic diagrams excluded the contribution of star\nformation in IC 5063 and NGC 7212, while the shock contribution was used to\nexplain the spectra emitted by their high velocity gas.\n", "  We review silicate chondrules and metal-sulfide nodules in unequilibrated\nenstatite chondrites (EH3 and EL3). Their unique mineralogical assemblage, with\na wide diversity of opaque phases, nitrides, nearly FeO-free enstatite etc.\ntestify to exceptionally reduced conditions. While those have long been\nascribed to a condensation sequence at supersolar C/O ratios, with the\noldhamite-rich nodules among the earliest condensates, evidence for relatively\noxidized local precursors suggests that their peculiarities may have been\nacquired during the chondrule-forming process itself. Silicate phases may have\nbeen then sulfidized in an O-poor and S-rich environment; metal-sulfide nodules\nin EH3 chondrites could have originated in the silicate chondrules whereas\nthose in EL3 may be impact products. The astrophysical setting (nebular or\nplanetary) where such conditions were achieved, whether by depletion in water\nor enrichment in dry organics-silicate mixtures, is uncertain, but was most\nlikely sited inside the snow line, consistent with the Earth-like oxygen\nisotopic signature of most EC silicates, with little data constraining its\nepoch yet.\n", "  We present some aspects of high precision calculations in the context of\nLattice Quantum Field Theory. This work is a collection of three studies done\nduring my Ph.D. period. First we present how to use the reweighting technique\nto compensate for the breaking of unitarity due to the use of different\nboundary conditions in the valence and sea sector. In particular when twisted\nboundary conditions are employed, with $\\theta$ twisting angle. In large volume\nwe found that the breaking is negligible, while in rather small volumes an\neffect is present. The quark mass appears to change with $\\theta$ as a cutoff\neffect. In the second part of the dissertation we present an optimization\nmethod for Hybrid Monte Carlo performances. The work is based on the existence\nof a shadow Hamiltonian, an exactly conserved quantity along the Molecular\nDynamics trajectory. The optimization method is economic since it only requires\nthe forces to be measured, which are already used for the evolution from one\nconfiguration to the new one. We found predictions for the cost of the\nsimulations with an accuracy of 10% and we could estimate the optimal\nparameters for the Omelyan integrator with mass-preconditioning and multi\ntime-scale. In the last part of the work we address the calculation of\nelectromagnetic corrections to the hadronic contribution to the $(g-2)$ anomaly\nof the muon. A long standing discrepancy between theoretical calculations and\nexperimental results is present. But before invoking New Physics we need to\nclear the sight from possible effects within the Standard Model. In this\nexploratory study we carefully matched the masses of the charged pions in the\ntheory with and without QED. We found a visible effect at the percent level\nalthough consistent with zero within two sigmas.\n", "  Papers on the searches for the sources of astrophysical neutrinos, submitted\nto the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea)\nby the IceCube Collaboration\n", "  Context. The 4th release of the SDSS Moving Object Catalog (SDSSMOC) is\npresently the largest photometric dataset of asteroids. Up to this point, the\nrelease of large asteroid datasets has always been followed by a redefinition\nof asteroid taxonomy. In the years that followed the release of the first\nSDSSMOC, several classification schemes using its data were proposed, all using\nthe taxonomic classes from previous taxonomies. However, no successful attempt\nhas been made to derive a new taxonomic system directly from the SDSS dataset.\nAims. The scope of the work is to propose a different interpretation scheme for\ngauging u0g0r0i0z0 asteroid observations based on the continuity of spectral\nfeatures. The scheme is integrated into previous taxonomic labeling, but is not\ndependent on them. Methods. We analyzed the behavior of asteroid sampling\nthrough principal components analysis to understand the role of uncertainties\nin the SDSSMOC. We identified that asteroids in this space follow two separate\nlinear trends using reflectances in the visible, which is characteristic of\ntheir spectrophotometric features. Results. Introducing taxonomic classes, we\nare able to interpret both trends as representative of featured and featureless\nspectra. The evolution within the trend is connected mainly to the band depth\nfor featured asteroids and to the spectral slope for featureless ones. We\ndefined a different taxonomic system that allowed us to only classify asteroids\nby two labels. Conclusions. We have classified 69% of all SDSSMOC sample, which\nis a robustness higher than reached by previous SDSS classifications.\nFurthermore, as an example, we present the behavior of asteroid (5129) Groom,\nwhose taxonomic labeling changes according to one of the trends owing to phase\nreddening. Now, such behavior can be characterized by the variation of one\nsingle parameter, its position in the trend.\n", "  The solution of the sine-Gordon equation in the quarter plane can be\nexpressed in terms of the solution of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem whose\ndefinition involves four spectral functions $a,b,A,B$. The functions $a(k)$ and\n$b(k)$ are defined via a nonlinear Fourier transform of the initial data,\nwhereas $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ are defined via a nonlinear Fourier transform of the\nboundary values. In this paper, we provide an extensive study of these\nnonlinear Fourier transforms and the associated eigenfunctions under weak\nregularity and decay assumptions on the initial and boundary values. The\nresults can be used to determine the long-time asymptotics of the sine-Gordon\nquarter-plane solution via nonlinear steepest descent techniques.\n", "  Papers on the properties of the atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino flux\nsubmitted to the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan,\nSouth Korea) by the IceCube Collaboration\n", "  Papers on cosmic-ray measurements submitted to the 35th International Cosmic\nRay Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea) by the IceCube Collaboration\n", "  Papers on searches for beyond the standard model physics, submitted to the\n35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017, Busan, South Korea) by the\nIceCube Collaboration\n", "  Papers on solar flares, supernovae, event reconstruction and education &\noutreach, submitted to the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2017,\nBusan, South Korea) by the IceCube Collaboration\n", "  Isothermal-isobaric molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to\nexamine a broad set of properties of the model water-1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)\nmixture as a function of composition.

Thermodynamic properties, such as density, molar volume, enthalpy of\nmixing and heat capacity at constant pressure have been examined.

This\npresentation does not contain new materials but is based on a number of\nselected papers published in the seventies, a part of them written in French.\nThe presentation is organized around three points. The first point,\ncorresponding to his PhD thesis, is concerned with the study of ion-solvent and\nion-ion interactions in a solution using complex dielectric permittivity\nmeasurements in the Hertzian and microwave frequency range. The second one is\nconcerned with an analysis of the ion pair absorption band observed in the far\ninfrared region in terms of an interionic potential energy.

The Minkowski \"vacuum\" is\nin fact a density matrix of infinite entropy. The argument assumes that\nMinkowski space can be viewed as a limit of a space-time with non-vanishing\ncosmological constant, either positive or negative.\n", "  We propose an analytical approach to the computation of tail probabilities of\ncompound distributions whose individual components have heavy tails. Our\napproach is based on the contour integration method, and gives rise to a\nrepresentation of the tail probability of a compound distribution in the form\nof a rapidly convergent one-dimensional integral involving a discontinuity of\nthe imaginary part of its moment generating function across a branch cut. The\nlatter integral can be evaluated in quadratures, or alternatively represented\nas an asymptotic expansion. Our approach thus offers a viable (especially at\nhigh percentile levels) alternative to more standard methods such as Monte\nCarlo or the Fast Fourier Transform, traditionally used for such problems. As a\npractical application, we use our method to compute the operational Value at\nRisk (VAR) of a financial institution, where individual losses are modeled as\nspliced distributions whose large loss components are given by power-law or\nlognormal distributions. Finally, we briefly discuss extensions of the present\nformalism for calculation of tail probabilities of compound distributions made\nof compound distributions with heavy tails.\n", "  These are lecture notes based on three lectures given by Antonello\nScardicchio at the December 2016 Topical School on Many-Body-Localization\norganized by the Statistical Physics Group of the Institute Jean Lamour in\nNancy. They were compiled and put in a coherent logical form by Thimoth\\'ee\nThiery.\n", "  This thesis deals with new backgrounds and concepts in Double Field Theory\n(DFT), a T-Duality invariant reformulation of supergravity (SUGRA). We begin by\nreviewing the basic concepts and notions of DFT. Afterwards, we turn to Double\nField Theory on group manifolds (DFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$). In order to obtain its\naction and gauge transformations, Closed String Field Theory (CSFT)\ncomputations are performed on a worldsheet, governed by a Wess-Zumino-Witten\nmodel on a group manifold. We consider generalized diffeomorphisms and their\ngauge algebra, which closes under a modified strong constraint. To explore the\nconnection between this theory and DFT, we recast it in terms of doubled\ngeneralized objects and extrapolate it to all orders in fields. This yields a\ngeneralized metric formulation and a flux formulation. We study the underlying\nsymmetries and field equations for both formulations. A novel feature in\nDFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$ is an additional $2D$-diffeomorphism invariance. An\nadditional extended strong constraint which breaks the $2D$-diffeomorphism\ninvariance can be imposed to reduce DFT$_{\\mathrm{WZW}}$ to DFT. Furthermore,\nwe perform a generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactification to recover the bosonic\nsubsector of half-maximal, electrically gauged supergravities. In this context,\nwe show how to construct twists for each embedding tensor solution explicitly\nby using Maurer-Cartan forms. Finally, we generalize the ideas and notions from\nDFT$_\\mathrm{WZW}$ to geometric Exceptional Field Theory (gEFT). This allows us\nto present a systematic construction for generalized parallelizable spaces in\ndim M = 4 SL(5) Exceptional Field Theory (EFT). These spaces permit a unified\ntreatment of consistent maximally supersymmetric truncations of ten- and\neleven-dimensional supergravity in Generalized Geometry (GG) and their\nsystematic construction has always been an open question.\n", "  This paper refines model predictions for the production of methane from\nUV-irradiated interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) now that the Rover\nEnvironmental Monitoring Station (REMS) instrument onboard the Mars Science\nLaboratory (MSL) Rover has made the first measurements of the UV environment on\nthe surface of Mars, at Gale Crater. Once these measurements are included in a\nUV radiative transfer model, we find that modelled UV sol-integrated energies\nacross the planet are lower than pre-measurement estimates by 35% on average,\nconsidering all latitudes and seasons. This reduction, in turn, reduces the\npredicted production of methane from individual accreting IDPs, extending their\nlifetimes and increasing the surface concentration of organics that must\naccumulate in order to emit sufficient methane to balance the accretion of\norganic compounds to Mars. Emission from reasonable accumulations of IDPs could\nrange up to ~7.9x10^-4 ppbv sol^-1. Richer deposits of organic carbon at the\nsurface may emit methane at no more than 3.9 ppbv sol^-1. An examination of\nIDP-derived methane production during atmospheric settling indicates that no\nmore than 0.32% of organic carbon from meteor streams may be deposited in the\natmosphere. Thus, such a process cannot explain either the spikes observed in\nmethane nor the low equilibrium values observed by MSL. Instead, this\ndiscrepancy may be explained if < 80 tons per year of organic carbon survives\nto the surface, the atmospheric lifetime of methane is < 110 years or the\nefficiency of the UV-CH4 process is < 7%. Under the assumption of reduced\ncarbon input cycling in the Martian system from these processes, both soil\nconcentrations of organic carbon and atmospheric measurements of methane\nobserved by MSL are consistent with the UV-CH4 process. This refinement of\nmethane production from IDPs and its geographical and vertical... <abstract\ncontinues in paper>.\n", "  The elastic scattering cross sections for a slow electron by C2 and H2\nmolecules have been calculated within the framework of the non-overlapping\natomic potential model. For the amplitudes of the multiple electron scattering\nby a target the wave function of the molecular continuum is represented as a\ncombination of a plane wave and two spherical waves generated by the centers of\natomic spheres. This wave function obeys the Huygens-Fresnel principle\naccording to which the electron wave scattering by a system of two centers is\naccompanied by generation of two spherical waves; their interaction creates a\ndiffraction pattern far from the target. Each of the Huygens waves, in turn, is\na superposition of the partial spherical waves with different orbital angular\nmomenta l and their projections m. The amplitudes of these partial waves are\ndefined by the corresponding phases of electron elastic scattering by an\nisolated atomic potential. In numerical calculations the s- and p-phase shifts\nare taken into account. So the number of interfering electron waves is equal to\neight: two of which are the s-type waves and the remaining six waves are of the\np-type with different m values. The calculation of the scattering amplitudes in\nclosed form (rather than in the form of S-matrix expansion) is reduced to\nsolving a system of eight inhomogeneous algebraic equations. The differential\nand total cross sections of electron scattering by fixed-in-space molecules and\nrandomly oriented ones have been calculated as well. We conclude by discussing\nthe special features of the S-matrix method for the case of arbitrary\nnon-spherical potentials.\n", "  The turbulence statistics of the intermittent region in a supersonic\nturbulent boundary layer are studied by direct numerical simulation. Recently,\nKwon et al. (2016) have shown that this intermittent behavior, consisting of\nthe coexistence of turbulent and non-turbulent flows separated by an interface,\ncould result in perils when the traditional Reynolds decomposition is used to\nanalyze data. Here, we extend the study of turbulent/non-turbulent interfaces\nto the supersonic regime and report turbulence statistics conditioned to the\ninterface. We show that the mathematical artefact of the traditional\nReynolds/Favre decomposition contaminates the Reynolds stresses and thermal\nstatistics. Our conditional statistics provide direct evidence that turbulent\nflow possesses positive Reynolds shear stress everywhere, whereas non-turbulent\nflow carries zero Reynolds shear stress. The thermal statistics of turbulent\nand non-turbulent flows exhibit opposite trends in the intermittent region, and\nthe difference can be traced back to the variation of total temperature\nresulting from the Prandtl number.\n", "  The dynamics of Atwood's machine with a string of significant mass are\ndescribed by the Lagrangian formalism, providing an eloquent example of how the\nLagrangian approach is a great deal simpler and so much more expedient than the\nNewtonian treatment.\n", "  We provide the detailed calculation of a general form for Maxwell and London\nequations that takes into account gravitational corrections in linear\napproximation. We determine the possible alteration of a static gravitational\nfield in a superconductor making use of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\nequations, providing also an analytic solution in the weak field condition.\nFinally, we compare the behavior of a high-Tc superconductor with a classical\nlow-Tc superconductor, analyzing the values of the parameters that can enhance\nthe reduction of the gravitational field.\n", "  Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are characterized by emission of radiation over\nmore than 10 orders of magnitude in frequency. Therefore, the execution of\nextensive surveys of the sky, with different types of detectors, is providing\nthe attractive possibility to identify and to investigate the properties of\nAGNs on very large statistical samples. Thanks to the large spectroscopic\nsurveys that allow detailed investigation of many of these sources, we have the\nopportunity to place new constraints on the nature and evolution of AGNs and to\ninvestigate their relations with the host systems. In this contribution we\npresent the results that can be obtained by using a new interactive catalogue\nthat we developed to investigate the range of AGN spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). We present simple SED models based on data collected in the catalogue\nand discuss their relations with optical spectra obtained by follow up\nobservations. We compare our findings with the expectations based on the AGN\nUnification Model, and we discuss the perspectives of multi-wavelength\napproaches to address AGN related processes such as black hole accretion and\nacceleration of relativistic jets.\n", "  The majority of neutrino oscillation experiments have obtained evidence for\nneutrino oscillations that are compatible with the three-flavor model.\nExplaining anomalous results from short-baseline experiments, such as LSND and\nMiniBooNE, in terms of neutrino oscillations requires the existence of sterile\nneutrinos. The search for sterile neutrino mixing conducted in NOvA uses a long\nbaseline of 810 km between Near Detector (ND) at Fermilab and Far Detector (FD)\nin Minnesota. The signal for sterile neutrino oscillations is a deficit of\nneutral-current neutrino interactions at the FD with respect to the ND\nprediction. In this document, We will present the analysis improvements that we\nare implementing for future NC sterile neutrino searches with NOvA. These\ninclude: improved modelling of our detector response; the inclusion of NC 2p2h\ninteraction modelling; implementing a better energy reconstruction techniques;\nand including possible oscillation due to sterile neutrinos in the ND . This\nimprovements enable us to do a simultaneous ND-FD shape fit of the NC energy\nspectrum covering a wider sterile mass range than previous analyses.\n", "  How much information is added to the Review of Particle Physics when a new\ndecay branching ratio of a hadron is measured and reported? This is\nquantifiable by Shannon's information entropy $S(i)\n=-\\sum_{f}BR_{(i\\longrightarrow f)}\\log BR_{(i\\longrightarrow f)}$ that takes\nas input the experimental branching ratios (BR) of the decay distribution of\nparticle i.\n  It may be used at two levels, against the distribution of decay-channel\nprobabilities, or against the distribution of individual quantum-state\nprobabilities (integrating the phase space of those states provides the\nformer). We illustrate the concept with some examples.\n", "  We discuss the horizon problem in a universe dominated by fluid with negative\npressure. We show that for generally accepted value of nonrelativistic matter\nenergy density parameter $\\Omega_{m0}<1$, the horizon problem can be solved\nonly if the fluid influencing negative pressure (the so-called ``X'' component)\nviolates the point-wise strong energy condition and if its energy density is\nsufficiently large $(\\Omega_{X 0}>1)$. The calculated value of the\n$\\Omega_{X0}$ parameter allowing for the solution of the horizon problem is\nconfronted with some recent observational data. Assuming that $p_X/\\rho_X<-0.6$\nwe find that the required amount of the ``X'' component is not ruled out by the\nsupernova limits. Since the value of energy density parameter $\\Omega_{v0}$ for\ncosmological constant larger than 1 is excluded by gravitational lensing\nobservations the value of the ratio $p_X/\\rho_X$ should lie between the values\n-1 and -0.6 if the model has to be free of the horizon problem beeing at the\nsame time consistent with observations. The value of $\\Omega_{X0}+\\Omega_{m0}$\nin the model is consistent with the constraints $0.2<\\Omega_{\\text{tot}}<1.5$\nfollowing from cosmic microwave background observations provided that\n$\\Omega_{m0}$ is low ($<0.2$).\n", "  We study with semi-analytical methods the statistics of pronounced arcs\ncaused by lensing of galaxies by foreground galaxy clusters. For the number\ndensity and redshift distribution of rich clusters we use Press-Schechter\ntheory, normalized on the basis of empirical data. For the background sources\nwe make use of observational results in the Hubble Deep Field. We present\nresults for three different lens models, in particular for the universal\nprofile suggested by Navarro, Frenk and White. Our primary concern is the\ndependence of the expected statistics on the cosmological parameters,\n$\\Omega_M$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda$. The theoretical estimates are compared with the\ncluster arcs survey EMSS, and the resulting constraints in the $\\Omega$-plane\nare presented. In spite of considerable theoretical an observational\nuncertainties a low-density universe is favored. Degeneracy curves for the\noptical depth and likelihood regions for the arc statistics in the\n$\\Omega$-plane depend only weakly on the cosmological constant.\n", "  The paper has been withdrawn\n", "  The cosmic microwave background anisotropies produced by active seeds, such\nas topological defects, have been computed recently for a variety of models by\na number of authors. In this paper we show how the generic features of the\nanisotropies caused by active, incoherent, seeds (that is the absence of\nacoustic peaks at small scales) can be obtained semi-analytically, without\nentering into the model dependent details of their formation, structure and\nevolution.\n", "  We present a class of exact solutions of Einstein's gravitational field\nequations describing spherically symmetric and static anisotropic stellar type\nconfigurations. The solutions are obtained by assuming a particular form of the\nanisotropy factor. The energy density and both radial and tangential pressures\nare finite and positive inside the anisotropic star. Numerical results show\nthat the basic physical parameters (mass and radius) of the model can describe\nrealistic astrophysical objects like neutron stars.\n", "  We study extended theories of gravity where nonminimal derivative couplings\nof the form $R^{kl}\\phi_{, k}\\phi_{, l}$ are present in the Lagrangian. We show\nhow and why the other couplings of similar structure may be ruled out and then\ndeduce the field equations and the related cosmological models. Finally, we get\ninflationary solutions which do follow neither from any effective scalar field\npotential nor from a cosmological constant introduced ``by hand'', and we show\nthe de Sitter space--time to be an attractor solution.\n", "  Hawking radiation in d=4 is regarded as a well understood quantum theoretical\nfeature of Black Holes or of other geometric backgrounds with an event horizon.\nOn the other hand, the dilaton theory emerging after spherical reduction and\ngeneralized dilaton theories only during the last years became the subject of\nnumerous studies which unveiled a surprisingly difficult situation. Recently we\nhave found some solution to the problem of Hawking flux in spherically reduced\ngravity which has the merit of using a minimal input. It leads to exact\ncancellation of negative contributions to this radiative flux, encountered in\nother approaches at infinity, so that our result asymptotically coincides with\nthe one of minimally coupled scalars. The use of an integrated action is\navoided - although we have been able to present also that quantity in a closed\nexpression. This short review also summarizes and critically discusses recent\nactivities in this field, including the problem of ``conformal frames'' for the\nbackground and questions which seem to be open in our own approach as well as\nin others.\n", "  Stars and black holes are sources of gravitational radiation in many phases\nof their life, and the signals they emit exhibit features that are\ncharacteristic of the generating process. Emitted since the beginning of star\nformation, these signals also contribute to create a stochastic background of\ngravitational waves. We shall show how the spectral properties of this\nbackground can be estimated in terms of the energy spectrum of each single\nevent and of the star formation rate history, which is now deducible from\nastronomical observations. We shall further discuss the process of scattering\nof masses by stars and black holes, showing that, unlike black holes, stars\nemit signals that carry a clear signature of the nature of the source.\n"]}
