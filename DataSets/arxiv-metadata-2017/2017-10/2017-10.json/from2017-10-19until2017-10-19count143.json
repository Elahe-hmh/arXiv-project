Vacaru, IJGMMP 4 (2007) 1285). In this\nletter, we prove that such a geometric method can be used for constructing\ngeneral non-Killing solutions. The key idea is to introduce an auxiliary linear\nconnection which is also metric compatible and completely defined by the metric\nstructure but contains some torsion terms induced nonholonomically by generic\noff-diagonal coefficients of metric. There are some classes of nonholonomic\nframes with respect to which the Einstein equations (for such an auxiliary\nconnection) split into an integrable system of partial differential equations.\nWe have to impose additional constraints on generating and integration\nfunctions in order to transform the auxiliary connection into the Levi-Civita\none. This way, we extract general exact solutions (parametrized by generic\noff-diagonal metrics and depending on all coordinates) in Einstein gravity and\nfive dimensional extensions.\n", "  We present a pairing Hamiltonian of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer form which\nexhibits two quantum critical lines of deconfined excitations. This conclusion\nis drawn using the exact Bethe ansatz equations of the model which admit a\nclass of simple, analytic solutions. The deconfined excitations obey\ngeneralised exclusion statistics. A notable property of the Hamiltonian is that\nit is non-hermitian. Although it does not have a real spectrum for all choices\nof coupling parameters, we provide a rigorous argument to establish that real\nspectra occur on the critical lines. The critical lines are found to be\ninvariant under a renormalisation group map.\n", "  We demonstrate the occurrence of free quasi-particle excitations obeying\ngeneralised exclusion statistics in a BCS model with asymmetric pair\nscattering. The results are derived from an exact solution of the Hamiltonian,\nwhich was obtained via the algebraic Bethe ansatz utilising the representation\ntheory of an underlying Yangian algebra. The free quasi-particle excitations\nare associated to highest-weight states of the Yangian algebra, corresponding\nto a class of analytic solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations.\n", "  The answer has been obtained for the A. Einstein question - How do body\nshapes change at acceleration? The metric has been found of uniformly\naccelerated system. The gravity field equation was established and its solution\nexample was given.\n", "  Accelerating, exact, explicit and simple solutions of relativistic\nhydrodynamics allow for a simple description of highly relativistic p+p\ncollisions. These solutions yield a finite rapidity distribution, thus they\nlead to an advanced estimate of the initial energy density of high energy\ncollisions. We show that such an advanced estimate yields an initial energy\ndensity in $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV p+p collisions at LHC around or above the\ncritical energy density from lattice QCD, and a corresponding initial\ntemperature above the critical temperature from QCD and the Hagedorn\ntemperature. We also show, that several times the critical energy density may\nhave been reached in high multiplicity events, hinting at a non-hadronic medium\ncreated in high multiplicity $\\sqrt{s}=7$ and 8 TeV p+p collisions.\n", "  I explain in a simple and compact form the origin of the apparent loss of\npredictability inside the dRGT non-linear formulation of massive gravity. This\napparent pathology was first reported by Kodama and the author when the\nstability of the Schwarzschild de-Sitter (S-dS) black-hole in dRGT was\nanalyzed. If we study the motion of a massive test particle around the S-dS\nsolution, we find that the total energy is not conserved in the usual sense.\nThe conserved quantity associated with time appears as a combination of the\ntotal energy and a velocity-dependent term. If the equations of motion are\nwritten in terms of this conserved quantity, then the three-dimensional motion\nin dRGT will not differ with respect to the same situation of Einstein gravity\n(GR). The differences with respect to GR will appear whenever we have a\ndynamical situation. I explore the Hawking radiation as an example where we can\nfind differences between GR and dRGT.\n", "  We discuss a generalised version of Sklyanin's Boundary Quantum Inverse\nScattering Method applied to the spin-1/2, trigonometric sl(2) case, for which\nboth the twisted-periodic and boundary constructions are obtained as limiting\ncases. We then investigate the quasi-classical limit of this approach leading\nto a set of mutually commuting conserved operators which we refer to as the\ntrigonometric, spin-1/2 Richardson-Gaudin system. We prove that the rational\nlimit of the set of conserved operators for the trigonometric system is\nequivalent, through a change of variables, rescaling, and a basis\ntransformation, to the original set of trigonometric conserved operators.\nMoreover we prove that the twisted-periodic and boundary constructions are\nequivalent in the trigonometric case, but not in the rational limit.\n", "  We study entanglement harvested from a quantum field through local\ninteraction with Unruh-DeWitt detectors undergoing linear acceleration. The\ninteractions allow entanglement to be swapped locally from the field to the\ndetectors. We find an enhancement in the entanglement harvesting by two\ndetectors with anti-parallel acceleration over those with inertial motion. This\nenhancement is characterized by the presence of entanglement between two\ndetectors that would otherwise maintain a separable state in the absence of\nrelativistic motion (with the same distance of closest approach in both cases).\nWe also find that entanglement harvesting is degraded for two detectors\nundergoing parallel acceleration in the same way as for two static, comoving\ndetectors in a de Sitter universe. This degradation is known to be different\nfrom that of two inertial detectors in a thermal bath. We comment on the\nphysical origin of the harvested entanglement and present three methods for\ndetermining distance between two detectors using properties of the harvested\nentanglement. Information about the separation is stored nonlocally in the\njoint state of the accelerated detectors after the interaction; a single\ndetector alone contains none. We also find an example of entanglement sudden\ndeath exhibited in parameter space.\n", "  Aligned superhydrophobic surfaces with the same texture orientation reduce\ndrag in the channel and generate secondary flows transverse to the direction of\nthe applied pressure gradient. Here we show that a transverse shear can be\neasily generated by using superhydrophobic channels with misaligned textured\nsurfaces. We propose a general theoretical approach to quantify this transverse\nflow by introducing the concept of an effective shear tensor. To illustrate its\nuse, we present approximate theoretical solutions and Dissipative Particle\nDynamics simulations for striped superhydrophobic channels. Our results\ndemonstrate that the transverse shear leads to complex flow patterns, which\nprovide a new mechanism of a passive vertical mixing at the scale of a texture\nperiod. Depending on the value of Reynolds number two different scenarios\noccur. At relatively low Reynolds number the flow represents a transverse shear\nsuperimposed with two co-rotating vortices. For larger Reynolds number these\nvortices become isolated, by suppressing fluid transport in the transverse\ndirection.\n", "  In this paper, we study the problem of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering\nby many small impedance bodies. A numerical method for solving this problem is\npresented. The problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\\ll d \\ll\n\\lambda$, where $a$ is the characteristic size of the bodies, $d$ is the\nminimal distance between neighboring bodies, $\\lambda=2\\pi/k$ is the wave\nlength and $k$ is the wave number. This problem is solved asymptotically and\nnumerical results for the cases of 125 and 1000 small bodies are presented to\nillustrate the method. Error estimates for the asymptotic solutions are also\nprovided.\n", "  We introduce and validate an algorithm to compute transient amplication\nfactors for the Orr-Sommerfeld-Squire linear theory for parallel two-phase\nflow. We further introduce direct numerical simulation as a way of comparing\nthe linear theory with early-stage wave growth in simulations. The simulation\nresults are drawn from a strongly supercritical parameter case wherein the\nmodal growth rates are strong. In this case, the modal growth dominates the\ntransient growth\n", "  We investigate the existence of magnetohydrostatic equilibria for\ntopologically complex magnetic fields. The approach employed is to perform\nideal numerical relaxation experiments. We use a newly-developed Lagrangian\nrelaxation scheme that exactly preserves the magnetic field topology during the\nrelaxation. Our configurations include both twisted and sheared fields, of\nwhich some fall into the category for which Parker (1972) predicted no\nforce-free equilibrium. The first class of field considered contains no\nmagnetic null points, and field lines connect between two perfectly conducting\nplates. In these cases we observe only resolved current layers of finite\nthickness. In further numerical experiments we confirm that magnetic null\npoints are loci of singular currents.\n", "  It is well-known that Einstein gravity is kinematic (no non-trivial vacuum\nsolution;i.e. Riemann vanishes whenever Ricci does so) in $3$ dimension because\nRiemann is entirely given in terms of Ricci. Could this property be\nuniversalized for all odd dimensions in a generalized theory? The answer is\nyes, and this property uniquely singles out pure Lovelock (it has only one\n$N$th order term in action) gravity for which $N$th order Lovelock Riemann\ntensor is indeed given in terms of corresponding Ricci for all odd $d=2N+1$\ndimensions. This feature of gravity is realized only in higher dimensions and\nit uniquely picks out pure Lovelock gravity from all other generalizations of\nEinstein gravity. It serves as a good discerning and guiding criterion for\ngravitational equation in higher dimensions.\n", "  We consider a generalisation of the p+ip pairing Hamiltonian with external\ninteraction terms. These terms allow for the exchange of particles between the\nsystem and its environment. As a result the u(1) symmetry associated with\nconservation of particle number, present in the p+ip Hamiltonian, is broken.\nNonetheless the generalised model is integrable. We establish integrability\nusing the Boundary Quantum Inverse Scattering Method, with one of the\nreflection matrices chosen to be non-diagonal. We also derive the corresponding\nBethe Ansatz Equations, the roots of which parametrise the exact solution for\nthe energy spectrum.\n", "  Observations of thermal radiation from neutron stars can potentially provide\ninformation about the states of supranuclear matter in the interiors of these\nstars with the aid of the theory of neutron-star thermal evolution. We review\nthe basics of this theory for isolated neutron stars with strong magnetic\nfields, including most relevant thermodynamic and kinetic properties in the\nstellar core, crust, and blanketing envelopes.\n", "  The theory of relativity requires that no information travel faster than\nlight, whereas the unitarity of quantum mechanics ensures that quantum\ninformation cannot be cloned. These conditions provide the basic constraints\nthat appear in information replication tasks, which formalize aspects of the\nbehavior of information in relativistic quantum mechanics. In this article, we\nprovide continuous variable (CV) strategies for spacetime quantum information\nreplication that are directly amenable to optical or mechanical implementation.\nWe use a new class of homologically-constructed CV quantum error correcting\ncodes to provide efficient solutions for the general case of information\nreplication. As compared to schemes encoding qubits, our CV solution requires\nhalf as many shares per encoded system. We also provide an optimized five-mode\nstrategy for replicating quantum information in a particular configuration of\nfour spacetime regions designed not to be reducible to previously performed\nexperiments. For this optimized strategy, we provide detailed encoding and\ndecoding procedures using standard optical apparatus and calculate the recovery\nfidelity when finite squeezing is used. As such we provide a scheme for\nexperimentally realizing quantum information replication using quantum optics.\n", "  Establishing the completeness of a Bethe Ansatz solution for an exactly\nsolved model is a perennial challenge, which is typically approached on a case\nby case basis. For the rational, spin-1/2 Richardson--Gaudin system it will be\nargued that, for generic values of the system's coupling parameters, the Bethe\nstates are complete. This method does not depend on knowledge of the\ndistribution of Bethe roots, such as a string hypothesis, and is generalisable\nto a wider class of systems.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to extend the notion of bialgebra for Leibniz\nalgebras (and Lie algebras) to $3$-Leibniz algebras (and $3$-Lie algebras) by\nuse of the cohomology complex of $3$-Leibniz algebras. Also, some theorems\nabout Leibniz bialgebras are extended and proved in the case of $3$-Leibniz\nbialgebras ($3$-Lie bialgebras). Moreover, a new theorem on the correspondence\nbetween $3$-Leibniz bialgebra and its associated Leibniz bialgebra is proved.\nFinally, some examples are discussed in detail.\n", "  In this article, we attempt to find a singularity free solution of Einstein's\nfield equations for compact stellar objects, precisely strange (quark) stars,\nconsidering Schwarzschild metric as the exterior spacetime. To this end, we\nconsider that the stellar object is spherically symmetric, static and\nanisotropic in nature and follows the density profile given by Mak and Harko\n(2002), which satisfies all the physical conditions. To investigate different\nproperties of the ultra-dense strange stars we have employed the MIT bag model\nfor the quark matter. Our investigation displays an interesting feature that\nthe anisotropy of compact stars increases with the radial coordinate and\nattains its maximum value at the surface which seems an inherent property for\nthe singularity free anisotropic compact stellar objects. In this connection we\nalso perform several tests for physical features of the proposed model and show\nthat these are reasonably acceptable within certain range. Further, we find\nthat the model is consistent with the energy conditions and the compact stellar\nstructure is stable with the validity of the TOV equation and Herrera cracking\nconcept. For the masses bellow the maximum mass point in mass vs radius curve\nthe typical behavior achieved within the framework of general relativity. We\nhave calculated the maximum mass and radius of the strange stars for the three\nfinite values of bag constant $B_g$.\n", "  We report the temperature dependencies of the upper critical fields\n$H_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{c}}(T)$ parallel to the c-axis and\n$H_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{ab}}(T)$ parallel to the ab-plane of single crystalline\nCaKFe$_4$As$_4$ inferred from the measurements of the temperature-dependent\nresistance in static magnetic fields up to 14 T and magnetoresistance in pulsed\nfields up to 63 T. We show that the observed decrease of the anisotropy\nparameter $\\gamma(T)=H_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{ab}}/H_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{c}}$ from\n$\\simeq 2.5$ at $T_c$ to $\\simeq 1.5$ at 25 K can be explained by interplay of\nparamagnetic pairbreaking and orbital effects in a multiband theory of\n$H_{c2}$. The slopes of $dH_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{c}}/dT\\simeq-4.4$ T/K and\n$dH_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{ab}}/dT \\simeq-10.9$ T/K at $T_c$ yield an electron mass\nanisotropy of $m_{ab}/m_c\\simeq 1/6$ and short coherence lengths $\\xi_c\\simeq\n5.8\\,\\text{\\AA}$ and $\\xi_{ab}\\simeq 14.3\\,\\text{\\AA}$. The behavior of\n$H_{c\\text{2}}(T)$ turns out to be similar to that of the optimal doped\n(Ba,K)Fe$_2$As$_2$, with $H_{c\\text{2}}^{\\text{ab}}(0)$ extrapolating to\n$\\simeq 92$ T, well above the BCS paramagnetic limit.\n", "  We consider a model belonging to the class of gravities with dynamical\ntorsion. The model is free of ghosts and gradient instabilities about Minkowski\nand torsionless Einstein backgrounds. We find that at zero cosmological\nconstant, the model admits a self-accelerating solution with non-Riemannian\nconnection. Small value of the effective cosmological constant is obtained at\nthe expense of the hierarchy between the dimensionless couplings.\n", "  This paper describes a measurement of the inclusive top quark pair production\ncross-section ($\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$) with a data sample of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of\nproton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV,\ncollected in 2015 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. This measurement uses\nevents with an opposite-charge electron--muon pair in the final state. Jets\ncontaining $b$-quarks are tagged using an algorithm based on track impact\nparameters and reconstructed secondary vertices. The numbers of events with\nexactly one and exactly two $b$-tagged jets are counted and used to determine\nsimultaneously $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ and the efficiency to reconstruct and\n$b$-tag a jet from a top quark decay, thereby minimising the associated\nsystematic uncertainties. The cross-section is measured to be:\n$\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$= 818 $\\pm$ 8 (stat) $\\pm$ 27 (syst) $\\pm$ 19 (lumi) $\\pm$\n12 (beam) pb, where the four uncertainties arise from data statistics,\nexperimental and theoretical systematic effects, the integrated luminosity and\nthe LHC beam energy, giving a total relative uncertainty of 4.4%. The result is\nconsistent with theoretical QCD calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order.\nA fiducial measurement corresponding to the experimental acceptance of the\nleptons is also presented.\n", "  Exclusive production of $\\omega$ mesons was studied at the COMPASS experiment\nby scattering $160~\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathit{c}$ muons off transversely polarised\nprotons. Five single-spin and three double-spin azimuthal asymmetries were\nmeasured in the range of photon virtuality $1~(\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathit{c})^2 < Q^2\n< 10~(\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathit{c})^2$, Bjorken scaling variable $0.003 <\nx_{\\mathit{Bj}} < 0.3$ and transverse momentum squared of the $\\omega$ meson\n$0.05~(\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathit{c})^2 < p_{T}^{2} <\n0.5~(\\mathrm{GeV}/\\mathit{c})^2$. The measured asymmetries are sensitive to the\nnucleon helicity-flip Generalised Parton Distributions (GPD) $E$ that are\nrelated to the orbital angular momentum of quarks, the chiral-odd GPDs $H_{T}$\nthat are related to the transversity Parton Distribution Functions, and the\nsign of the $\\pi\\omega$ transition form factor. The results are compared to\nrecent calculations of a GPD-based model.\n", "  In this paper we attempt to analyze the physical and philosophical meaning of\nquantum contextuality. We will argue that there exists a general confusion\nwithin the foundational literature arising from the improper \"scrambling\" of\ntwo different meanings of quantum contextuality. While the first one,\nintroduced by Bohr, is related to an epistemic interpretation of contextuality\nwhich stresses the incompatibility (or complementarity) of certain measurement\nsituations described in classical terms; the second meaning of contextuality is\nrelated to a purely formal understanding of contextuality as exposed by the\nKochen-Specker (KS) theorem which focuses instead on the constraints of the\northodox quantum formalism in order to interpret projection operators as\npreexistent or actual (definite valued) properties. We will show how these two\nnotions have been scrambled together creating an \"omelette of contextuality\"\nwhich has been fully widespread through a popularized \"epistemic explanation\"\nof the KS theorem according to which: The measurement outcome of the observable\nA when measured together with B or together with C will necessarily differ in\ncase [A, B] = [A, C] = 0, and [B, C] /= 0. We will show why this statement is\nnot only improperly scrambling epistemic and formal perspectives, but is also\nphysically and philosophically meaningless. Finally, we analyze the\nconsequences of such widespread epistemic reading of KS theorem as related to\nstatistical statements of measurement outcomes.\n", "  We present the experimental characterization of two distant double-slit masks\nilluminated by chaotic light, in the absence of first-order imaging and\ninterference. The scheme exploits second-order interference of light\npropagating through two indistinguishable pairs of {\\it disjoint} optical paths\npassing through the masks of interest. The proposed technique leads to a deeper\nunderstanding of biphoton interference and coherence, and opens the way to the\ndevelopment of novel schemes for retrieving information on the relative\nposition and the spatial structure of distant objects, which is of interest in\nremote sensing, biomedical imaging, as well as monitoring of laser ablation,\nwhen first-order imaging and interference are not feasible.\n", "  In black hole thermodynamics, it has been observed that AdS black holes\nbehave as van der Waals system if one interprets the cosmological constant as a\npressure term. Also the critical exponents for the phase transition of AdS\nblack holes and the van der Waals systems are same. Till now this type of\nanalysis is done by two steps. In the first step one shows that a particular\nmetric allows phase transition and in the second step, using this information,\none calculates the exponents. Here, we present a different approach based on\ntwo universal inputs (the general forms of the Smarr formula and the first law\nof thermodynamics) and one assumption regarding the existence of van der Waal\nlike critical point for a metric. We find that the same values of the critical\nexponents can be obtained by this approach. Thus we demonstrate that, though\nthe existence of van der Waal like phase transition depends on specific\nmetrics, the values of critical exponents are then fixed for that set of\nmetrics.\n", "  Applying the anholonomic frame deformation method, we construct various\nclasses of cosmological solutions for effective Einstein -- Yang-Mills --\nHiggs, and two measure theories. The types of models considered are\nFreedman-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi, Kasner and models with\nattractor configurations. The various regimes pertaining to plateau--type\ninflation, quadratic inflation, Starobinsky type and Higgs type inflation are\npresented.\n", "  The increase in the temperature of photovoltaic (PV) solar cells affects\nnegatively their power conversion efficiency and decreases their lifetime. The\nnegative effects are particularly pronounced in concentrator solar cells.\nTherefore, it is crucial to limit the PV cell temperature by effectively\nremoving the excess heat. Conventional thermal phase change materials (PCMs)\nand thermal interface materials (TIMs) do not possess the thermal conductivity\nvalues sufficient for thermal management of the next generation of PV cells. In\nthis paper, we report the results of investigation of the increased efficiency\nof PV cells with the use of graphene-enhanced TIMs. Graphene reveals the\nhighest values of the intrinsic thermal conductivity. It was also shown that\nthe thermal conductivity of composites can be increased via utilization of\ngraphene fillers. We prepared TIMs with up to 6% of graphene designed\nspecifically for PV cell application. The solar cells were tested using the\nsolar simulation module. It was found that the drop in the output voltage of\nthe solar panel under two-sun concentrated illumination can be reduced from 19%\nto 6% when graphene-enhanced TIMs are used. The proposed method can recover up\nto 75% of the power loss in solar cells.\n", "  We report results of investigation of the low-frequency electronic excess\nnoise in quasi-1D nanowires of TaSe3 capped with quasi-2D h-BN layers.\nSemi-metallic TaSe3 is a quasi-1D van der Waals material with exceptionally\nhigh breakdown current density. It was found that TaSe3 nanowires have lower\nlevels of the normalized noise spectral density, compared to carbon nanotubes\nand graphene. The temperature-dependent measurements revealed that the\nlow-frequency electronic 1/f noise becomes the 1/f^2-type as temperature\nincreases to about 400 K, suggesting the onset of electromigration (f is the\nfrequency). Using the Dutta- Horn random fluctuation model of the electronic\nnoise in metals we determined that the noise activation energy for quasi-1D\nTaSe3 nanowires is approximately E_P=1.0 eV. In the framework of the empirical\nnoise model for metallic interconnects, the extracted activation energy,\nrelated to electromigration, is E_A=0.88 eV, consistent with that for Cu and Al\ninterconnects. Our results shed light on the physical mechanism of\nlow-frequency 1/f noise in quasi-1D van der Waals semi-metals and suggest that\nsuch material systems have potential for ultimately downscaled local\ninterconnect applications.\n", "  The NA61/SHINE experiment aims to discover the critical point of strongly\ninteracting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement. For\nthese goals a scan of the two dimensional phase diagram ($T$-$\\mu_{B}$) is\nbeing performed at the SPS by measurements of hadron production in\nproton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus interactions as a function of\ncollision energy and system size. In this contribution preliminary results on\ntransverse momentum and multiplicity fluctuations expressed in terms of\nstrongly intensive quantities from the Ar+Sc energy scan will be presented.\nThese fluctuations are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical\npoint. The results are compared with results from the p+p and Be+Be energy scan\nas well as with NA49 measurements.\n", "  We report the results of an experimental study of thermal and magnetic\nproperties of nanostructured ferrimagnetic iron oxide composites with graphene\nand graphite fillers synthesized via the current activated pressure assisted\ndensification. The thermal conductivity was measured using the laser-flash and\ntransient plane source techniques. It was demonstrated that addition of 5 wt. %\nof equal mixture of graphene and graphite flakes to the composite results in a\nfactor of x2.6 enhancement of the thermal conductivity without significant\ndegradation of the saturation magnetization. The microscopy and spectroscopic\ncharacterization reveal that sp2 carbon fillers preserve their crystal\nstructure and morphology during the composite processing. The strong increase\nin the thermal conductivity was attributed to the excellent phonon heat\nconduction properties of graphene and graphite. The results are important for\nenergy and electronic applications of the nanostructured permanent magnets.\n", "  We study the effect of photospheric footpoint motions on magnetic field\nstructures containing magnetic nulls. The footpoint motions are prescribed on\nthe photospheric boundary as a velocity field which entangles the magnetic\nfield. We investigate the propagation of the injected energy, the conversion of\nenergy, emergence of current layers and other consequences of the non-trivial\nmagnetic field topology in this situation. These boundary motions lead\ninitially to an increase in magnetic and kinetic energy. Following this, the\nenergy input from the photosphere is partially dissipated and partially\ntransported out of the domain through the Poynting flux. The presence of\nseparatrix layers and magnetic null-points fundamentally alters the propagation\nbehavior of disturbances from the photosphere into the corona. Depending on the\nfield line topology close to the photosphere, the energy is either trapped or\nfree to propagate into the corona.\n", "  We consider null geodesics in the domain of outer communication of a\nsub-extremal Kerr spacetime. We show, that most fundamental properties of null\ngeodesics can be represented in one plot. In particular one can see immediately\nthat the ergoregion and trapping are separated in phase space. Furthermore we\nshow that from the point of view of any timelike observer outside of a black\nhole, trapping can be understood as a smooth set of spacelike directions on the\nobservers' celestial sphere.\n", "  The apparent properties of distant objects encode information about the way\nthe light they emit propagates to an observer, and therefore about the\ncurvature of the underlying spacetime. Measuring the relationship between the\nredshift $z$ and the luminosity distance $D_{\\rm L}$ of a standard candle, for\nexample, yields information on the Universe's matter content. In practice,\nhowever, in order to decode this information the observer needs to make an\nassumption about the functional form of the $D_{\\rm L}(z)$ relation; in other\nwords, a cosmological model needs to be assumed. In this work, we use\nnumerical-relativity simulations, equipped with a new ray-tracing module, to\nnumerically obtain this relation for a few black-hole--lattice cosmologies and\ncompare it to the well-known Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker case, as\nwell as to other relevant cosmologies and to the Empty-Beam Approximation. We\nfind that the latter provides the best estimate of the luminosity distance and\nformulate a simple argument to account for this agreement. We also find that a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker model can reproduce this observable\nexactly, as long as a time-dependent cosmological constant is included in the\nfit. Finally, the dependence of these results on the lattice mass-to-spacing\nratio $\\mu$ is discussed: we discover that, unlike the expansion rate, the\n$D_{\\rm L}(z)$ relation in a black-hole lattice does not tend to that measured\nin the corresponding continuum spacetime as $\\mu \\to 0$.\n", "  Observations indicate that large-scale anomalies exist in the fluctuations of\nthe cosmic microwave background. In these anomalies, the hemispherical power\namplitude asymmetry has a correlation length comparable to that of the\nobservable universe. We propose that a topological defect created by\nspontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry prior to inflation generated an\ninitial phase variation, $\\delta \\theta$, across the observable region of the\nuniverse. The amplitude of this phase fluctuation is protected by topology if\nthe defect is inside the horizon, and is frozen by causality if the defect\nexits the horizon. After inflation, the phase-corresponding boson field started\nto oscillate, when the Hubble rate decreased to a level comparable to the mass\nof the boson field. The energy density of the newly created boson particles\nvaried across the observable universe. The bosons subsequently decayed into\nradiation prior to the BBN epoch, and the resulting fluctuations in the energy\ndensity produced the observed power asymmetry. This scenario predicts a\nscale-dependent modulation amplitude power asymmetry and in addition, as\ntopological defects created by phase transitions are a very general phenomenon,\nthe observed hemispherical asymmetry may be seen as an evidence for the\ncosmological inflation.\n", "  Nanostructured permanent magnets are gaining increasing interest and\nimportance for applications such as generators and motors. Thermal management\nis a key concern since performance of permanent magnets decreases with\ntemperature. We investigated the magnetic and thermal transport properties of\nrare-earth free nanostructured SrFe12O19 magnets produced by the current\nactivated pressure assisted densification. The synthesized magnets have aligned\ngrains such that their magnetic easy axis is perpendicular to their largest\nsurface area to maximize their magnetic performance. The SrFe12O19 magnets have\nfine grain sizes in the cross-plane direction and substantially larger grain\nsizes in the in-plane direction. It was found that this microstructure results\nin approximately a factor of two higher thermal conductivity in the in-plane\ndirection, providing an opportunity for effective cooling. The phonons are the\ndominant heat carriers in this type of permanent magnets near room temperature.\nTemperature and direction dependent thermal conductivity measurements indicate\nthat both Umklapp and grain boundary scattering are important in the in-plane\ndirection, where the characteristic grain size is relatively large, while grain\nboundary scattering dominates the cross-plane thermal transport. The\ninvestigated nano/microstructural design strategy should translate well to\nother material systems and thus have important implications for thermal\nmanagement of nanostructured permanent magnets.\n", "  We report the observation of Coulomb drag between a two-dimensional (2D)\nelectron gas in graphene and a one-dimensional (1D) wire composed of a carbon\nnanotube. We find that drag occurs when the bulk of graphene is conducting, but\nis strongly suppressed in the quantum Hall regime when magnetic field confines\nconducting electrons to the edges of graphene and far from the nanotube.\nOut-of-equilibrium and non-linear drag measurements show intriguing interplay\nbetween 1D and 2D conductors. These hybrid electronic devices of novel geometry\ncould lead to potential applications for Van der Waals electronics\n", "  The two-loop (order $\\alpha'$) $\\beta$-function equations, which are\nequivalent to the equations of motion of $\\alpha'$-corrected string effective\naction, are considered for anisotropic homogeneous space-times. These equations\nare solved for all Bianchi-type models in two schemes of effective action,\nnamely $R^2$ and Gauss-Bonnet schemes with zero cosmological constant and then\nthe metric, dilaton and $B$-field are found at $\\alpha'$ perturbative\ncorrections.\n", "  We present a simple method to efficiently compute a lower limit of the\ntopological entropy and its spatial distribution for two-dimensional mappings.\nThese mappings could represent either two-dimensional time-periodic fluid flows\nor three-dimensional magnetic fields, which are periodic in one direction. This\nmethod is based on measuring the length of a material line in the flow.\nDepending on the nature of the flow, the fluid can be mixed very efficiently\nwhich causes the line to stretch. Here we study a method that adaptively\nincreases the resolution at locations along the line where folds lead to high\ncurvature. This reduces the computational cost greatly which allows us to study\nunprecedented parameter regimes. We demonstrate how this efficient\nimplementation allows the computation of the variation of the finite-time\ntopological entropy in the mapping. This measure quantifies spatial variations\nof the braiding efficiency, important in many practical applications.\n", "  Second-order nonlinear spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool in\nelucidating key chemical and structural characteristics at a variety of\ninterfaces. However, the presence of interfacial potentials may lead to\ncomplications regarding the interpretation of second harmonic and vibrational\nsum frequency generation responses from charged interfaces due to mixing of\nabsorptive and dispersive contributions. Here, we examine by means of\nmathematical modeling how this interaction influences second-order spectral\nlineshapes. We discuss our findings in the context of reported nonlinear\noptical spectra obtained from charged water/air and solid/liquid interfaces and\ndemonstrate the importance of accounting for the interfacial\npotential-dependent \\c{hi}(3) term in interpreting lineshapes when seeking\nmolecular information from charged interfaces using second-order spectroscopy.\n", "  The experimental investigation of quantum devices incorporating mechanical\nresonators has opened up new frontiers in the study of quantum mechanics at a\nmacroscopic level$^{1,2}$. Superconducting microwave circuits have proven to be\na powerful platform for the realisation of such quantum devices, both in cavity\noptomechanics$^{3,4}$, and circuit quantum electro-dynamics (QED)$^{5,6}$.\nWhile most experiments to date have involved localised nanomechanical\nresonators, it has recently been shown that propagating surface acoustic waves\n(SAWs) can be piezoelectrically coupled to superconducting qubits$^{7,8}$, and\nconfined in high-quality Fabry-Perot cavities up to microwave frequencies in\nthe quantum regime$^{9}$, indicating the possibility of realising coherent\nexchange of quantum information between the two systems. Here we present\nmeasurements of a device in which a superconducting qubit is embedded in, and\ninteracts with, the acoustic field of a Fabry-Perot SAW cavity on quartz,\nrealising a surface acoustic version of cavity quantum electrodynamics. This\nquantum acoustodynamics (QAD) architecture may be used to develop new quantum\nacoustic devices in which quantum information is stored in trapped on-chip\nsurface acoustic wavepackets, and manipulated in ways that are impossible with\npurely electromagnetic signals, due to the $10^{5}$ times slower speed of\ntravel of the mechanical waves.\n", "  Sharing scientific data, with the objective of making it fully discoverable,\naccessible, assessable, intelligible, usable, and interoperable, requires work\nat the disciplinary level to define in particular how the data should be\nformatted and described. Each discipline has its own organization and history\nas a starting point, and this paper explores the way a range of disciplines,\nnamely materials science, crystallography, astronomy, earth sciences,\nhumanities and linguistics get organized at the international level to tackle\nthis question. In each case, the disciplinary culture with respect to data\nsharing, science drivers, organization and lessons learnt are briefly\ndescribed, as well as the elements of the specific data infrastructure which\nare or could be shared with others. Commonalities and differences are assessed.\nCommon key elements for success are identified: data sharing should be science\ndriven; defining the disciplinary part of the interdisciplinary standards is\nmandatory but challenging; sharing of applications should accompany data\nsharing. Incentives such as journal and funding agency requirements are also\nsimilar. For all, it also appears that social aspects are more challenging than\ntechnological ones. Governance is more diverse, and linked to the discipline\norganization. CODATA, the RDA and the WDS can facilitate the establishment of\ndisciplinary interoperability frameworks. Being problem-driven is also a key\nfactor of success for building bridges to enable interdisciplinary research.\n", "  We derive the equations for the non-linear effective dynamics of a so called\npseudo-spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which emerges from the linear many-body\nSchr\\\"odinger equation at the leading order in the number of particles. The\nconsidered system is a three-dimensional diluted gas of identical bosons with\nspin, possibly confined in space, and coupled with an external time-dependent\nmagnetic field; particles also interact among themselves through a short-scale\nrepulsive interaction. The limit of infinitely many particles is monitored in\nthe physically relevant Gross-Pitaevskii scaling. In our main theorem, if at\ntime zero the system is in a phase of complete condensation (at the level of\nthe reduced one-body marginal) and with energy per particle fixed by the\nGross-Pitaevskii functional, then such conditions persist also at later times,\nwith the one-body orbital of the condensate evolving according to a system of\nnon-linear cubic Schr\\\"odinger equations coupled among themselves through\nlinear (Rabi) terms. The proof relies on an adaptation to the spinor setting of\nPickl's projection counting method developed for the scalar case. Quantitative\nrates of convergence are available, but not made explicit because evidently\nnon-optimal. In order to substantiate the formalism and the assumptions made in\nthe main theorem, in an introductory section we review the mathematical\nformalisation of modern typical experiments with pseudo-spinor condensates.\n", "  The one clean qubit model (or the DQC1 model) is a restricted model of\nquantum computing where only a single input qubit is pure and all other input\nqubits are maximally mixed. In spite of the severe restriction, the model can\nsolve several problems (such as calculating Jones polynomials) whose classical\nefficient solutions are not known. Furthermore, it was shown that if the output\nprobability distribution of the one clean qubit model can be classically\nefficiently sampled with a constant multiplicative error, then the polynomial\nhierarchy collapses to the second level. Is it possible to improve the\nmultiplicative error hardness result to a constant total variation distance\nerror one like other sub-universal quantum computing models such as the IQP\nmodel, the Boson Sampling model, and the Fourier Sampling model? In this paper,\nwe show that it is indeed possible if we accept a modified version of the\naverage case hardness conjecture. Interestingly, the anti-concentration lemma\ncan be easily shown by using the special property of the one clean qubit model\nthat each output probability is so small that no concentration occurs.\n", "  We introduce a four-dimensional extension of the Poincar\\'{e} algebra\n$(\\mathcal{N})$ in (1+1)-dimensional space-time and obtain a (1+1)-dimensional\ngauge symmetric gravity model using the algebra $\\mathcal{N}$. We show that the\nobtained gravity model is dual (canonically transformed) to the\n(1+1)-dimensional anti de Sitter ($AdS$) gravity. We also obtain some black\nhole and Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) solutions by solving its classical\nequations of motion. Then, we study\n$\\frac{\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{4,8}}}{\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{1}}\\otimes\n\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathbf{1}}}$ gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model and obtain some\nexact black hole and cosmological solutions in string theory. We show that some\nobtained black hole and cosmological metrics in string theory are same as the\nmetrics obtained in solutions of our gauge symmetric gravity model.\n", "  The femtosecond laser pulse heating of silver film is investigated by\nperforming quantum mechanics (QM), molecular dynamics (MD) and two temperature\nmodel (TTM) integrated multiscale simulation. The laser excitation dependent\nelectron thermophysical parameters (electron heat capacity, electron thermal\nconductivity, and effective electron-phonon coupling factor) are determined\nfrom ab initio QM calculation, and implemented into TTM description of electron\nthermal excitation, heat conduction, as well as electron-phonon coupled thermal\nenergy transport. The kinetics of atomic motion is modeled by MD simulation.\nEnergy evolution of excited electron subsystem is described by TTM in\ncontinuum. The MD and TTM are coupled by utilizing the effective\nelectron-phonon coupling factor. Laser heating with varying laser fluence is\nsystematically studied to determine the thresholds of the homogeneous melting\nand ablation. The thermal ablation induced by faster expansion of locally and\nexcessively superheated silver is reported. This paper provides a basis for\ninterpreting the phase change process induced by laser heating, and facilitates\nthe advancement of femtosecond laser pulse processing of material.\n", "  We derive and investigate the physical properties of asymptotically flat\nnoncommutative regular charged black holes with a Gaussian mass density\ndistribution and a Weibull electric charge density distribution. Both\ndistributions replace the Dirac one and introduce a set of substitution rules\nconstituting new ways of counting. The solutions have a de Sitter behavior in\nthe vicinity of the origin provided the electric charge density is Weibull of\nthe form $r^{n/2}{\\rm e}^{-r^2/(4\\theta^2)}$ with $n\\geq 1$. The electric field\nand temperature are finite for all values of the radial coordinate, mass, and\ncharge. The charge is bounded from above for stability reasons and stable\ncharged quantum particles have mass and charge bounded from below and from\nabove within the simplified semi-classical model we present in this work.\n", "  Colloidal migration in temperature gradient is referred to as thermophoresis.\nIn contrast to particles with spherical shape, we show that elongated colloids\nmay have a thermophoretic response that varies with the colloid orientation.\nRemarkably, this can translate into a non-vanishing thermophoretic force in the\ndirection perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Oppositely to the friction\nforce, the thermophoretic force of a rod oriented with the temperature gradient\ncan be larger or smaller than when oriented perpendicular to it. The precise\nanisotropic thermophoretic behavior clearly depends on the colloidal rod aspect\nratio, and also on its surface details, which provides an interesting\ntunability to the devices constructed based on this principle. By means of\nmesoscale hydrodynamic simulations, we characterize this effect for different\ntypes of rod-like colloids.\n", "  We perform a global fit within the inert doublet model taking into account\nexperimental observables from colliders, direct and indirect dark matter\nsearches and theoretical constraints. In particular, we consider recent results\nfrom searches for dark matter annihilation-induced gamma-rays in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies and relax the assumption that the inert doublet model\nshould account for the entire dark matter in the Universe. We moreover study in\nhow far the model is compatible with a possible dark matter explanation of the\nso-called Galactic center excess. We find two distinct parameter space regions\nthat are consistent with existing constraints and can simultaneously explain\nthe excess: One with dark matter masses near the Higgs resonance and one around\n72 GeV where dark matter annihilates predominantly into pairs of virtual\nelectroweak gauge bosons via the four-vertex arising from the inert doublet's\nkinetic term. We briefly discuss future prospects to probe these scenarios.\n", "  We have carried out bulk-sensitive hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy\n(HAXPES) measurements on in-situ cleaved and ex-situ polished SmB6 single\ncrystals. Using the multiplet-structure in the Sm 3d core level spectra, we\ndetermined reliably that the valence of Sm in bulk SmB6 is close to 2.55 at ~5\nK. Temperature dependent measurements revealed that the Sm valence gradually\nincreases to 2.64 at 300 K. From a detailed line shape analysis we can clearly\nobserve that not only the J=0 but also the J=1 state of the Sm 4f 6\nconfiguration becomes occupied at elevated temperatures. Making use of the\npolarization dependence, we were able to identify and extract the Sm 4f\nspectral weight of the bulk material. Finally, we revealed that the oxidized or\nchemically damaged surface region of the ex-situ polished SmB6 single crystal\nis surprisingly thin, about 1 nm only.\n", "  The $K^{+}$ meson properties in the nuclear medium are investigated by\nconsidering the wavefunction renormalization as a first step to reveal the\nin-medium properties of the $K^{+}$ meson in the context of partial restoration\nof chiral symmetry. The $K^{+}N$ elastic scattering amplitude is constructed\nusing chiral perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order. Using the\nconstructed amplitude, we calculate the wavefunction renormalization in the\nThomas-Fermi approximation. We obtained a good description of the $K^{+}N$\nelastic scattering amplitude. The obtained wavefunction renormalization factor\nsuggests the 2 to 6% enhancement of the $K^{+}N$ interaction at the saturation\ndensity. We conclude that the wavefunction renormalization could be one of the\nimportant medium effects for the $K^{+}$ meson.\n", "  The anomalous Hall effect in ferromagnetic metals is classified into two\nbased on the mechanism. The first one is the intrinsic Hall effect due to the\nBerry curvature in momentum space; this is a Hall effect that solely arises\nfrom the band structure of solids. On the other hand, another contribution to\nthe Hall effect, so-called extrinsic mechanism, comes from impurity scatterings\nsuch as skew scattering and side jump; for the extrinsic mechanism, the\nspin-orbit interaction of the impurity ions is often required. These two\nmechanisms are often discussed separately; the intrinsic Hall effect is\ndominant in the intermediate resistivity region while the latter, i.e., skew\nscattering, becomes important in the clean limit. In this work, it is shown\ntheoretically that the non-commutative nature of the real-space coordinates in\nthe presence of the Berry curvature causes the skew scattering by the\nnonmagnetic impurity without relativistic spin-orbit interactions, in sharp\ncontrast to the conventional cases.\n", "  The nonprojectable Horava theory at the kinetic-conformal point is defined by\nsetting a specific value of the coupling constant of the kinetic term of the\nLagrangian. This formulation has two additional second class-constraints that\neliminate the extra mode. We show that the space of solutions of this theory in\nthe Hamiltonian formalism is bigger than the space of solutions in the original\nLagrangian formalism. In the Hamiltonian formalism there are certain\nconfigurations for the Lagrange multupliers that lead to solutions that cannot\nbe found in the original Lagrangian formulation. We show specific examples in\nvacuum and with a source. The solution with the source has homogeneous and\nisotropic spatial hypersurfaces. The enhancement of the space of solutions\nleaves the possibility that new solutions applicable to cosmology, or to other\nphysical systems, can be found in the Hamiltonian formalism.\n", "  A search for the decay $K^0_{\\scriptscriptstyle S}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ is\nperformed, based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions corresponding to\nan integrated luminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$, collected by the LHCb experiment at\ncentre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. The observed yield is consistent with\nthe background-only hypothesis, yielding a limit on the branching fraction of\n${\\cal B}(K^0_{\\scriptscriptstyle S}\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-) < 0.8~(1.0) \\times 10^{-9}$\nat $90\\%~(95\\%)$ confidence level. This result improves the previous upper\nlimit on the branching fraction by an order of magnitude.\n", "  We study the classical complexity of the exact Boson Sampling problem where\nthe objective is to produce provably correct random samples from a particular\nquantum mechanical distribution. The computational framework was proposed by\nAaronson and Arkhipov in 2011 as an attainable demonstration of `quantum\nsupremacy', that is a practical quantum computing experiment able to produce\noutput at a speed beyond the reach of classical (that is non-quantum) computer\nhardware. Since its introduction Boson Sampling has been the subject of intense\ninternational research in the world of quantum computing. On the face of it,\nthe problem is challenging for classical computation. Aaronson and Arkhipov\nshow that exact Boson Sampling is not efficiently solvable by a classical\ncomputer unless $P^{\\#P} = BPP^{NP}$ and the polynomial hierarchy collapses to\nthe third level.\n  The fastest known exact classical algorithm for the standard Boson Sampling\nproblem takes $O({m + n -1 \\choose n} n 2^n )$ time to produce samples for a\nsystem with input size $n$ and $m$ output modes, making it infeasible for\nanything but the smallest values of $n$ and $m$. We give an algorithm that is\nmuch faster, running in $O(n 2^n + \\operatorname{poly}(m,n))$ time and $O(m)$\nadditional space. The algorithm is simple to implement and has low constant\nfactor overheads. As a consequence our classical algorithm is able to solve the\nexact Boson Sampling problem for system sizes far beyond current photonic\nquantum computing experimentation, thereby significantly reducing the\nlikelihood of achieving near-term quantum supremacy in the context of Boson\nSampling.\n", "  We introduce a quantum Monte Carlo method at finite temperature for\ninteracting fermionic models in the canonical ensemble, where the conservation\nof the particle number is enforced. Although general thermodynamic arguments\nensure the equivalence of the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles in\nthe thermodynamic limit, their approach to the infinite-volume limit is\ndistinctively different. Observables computed in the canonical ensemble\ngenerically display a finite-size correction proportional to the inverse\nvolume, whereas in the grand-canonical ensemble the approach is exponential in\nthe ratio of the linear size over the correlation length. We verify these\npredictions by quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model in one and\ntwo dimensions in the grand-canonical and the canonical ensemble. We prove an\nexact formula for the finite-size part of the free energy density, energy\ndensity and other observables in the canonical ensemble and relate this\ncorrection to a susceptibility computed in the corresponding grand-canonical\nensemble. This result is confirmed by an exact computation of the\none-dimensional classical Ising model in the canonical ensemble, which for\nclassical models corresponds to the so-called fixed-magnetization ensemble. Our\nmethod is useful for simulating finite systems which are not coupled to a\nparticle bath, such as in nuclear or cold atom physics.\n", "  The Wang-Landau (WL) algorithm has been widely used for simulations in many\nareas of physics. Our analysis of the WL algorithm explains its properties and\nshows that the difference of the largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix in\nthe energy space from unity can be used to control the accuracy of estimating\nthe density of states. Analytic expressions for the matrix elements are given\nin the case of the one-dimensional Ising model. The proposed method is further\nconfirmed by numerical results for the one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nIsing models and also the two-dimensional Potts model.\n", "  By adopting a generalised parton model approach at leading order in QCD,\nincluding spin and intrinsic parton motion effects, we study the Collins\nazimuthal asymmetries for pions within a large-$p_T$ jet produced at\nmid-rapidity in polarised hadronic collisions. Using available information on\nthe quark transversity distributions and the pion Collins functions, as\nextracted from semi-inclusive deeply inelastic scattering and $e^+e^-\\to h_1\nh_2\\, X$ processes, we compute estimates for the Collins asymmetries in\nkinematical configurations presently investigated at RHIC by the STAR\nCollaboration. Collins-like asymmetries, involving linearly polarised gluons,\nare also considered. Our predictions, compared against available preliminary\ndata, show a very good agreement, even if some discrepancies, to be further\nscrutinized both theoretically and experimentally, appear in the transverse\nmomentum dependence of the Collins asymmetry. These results are in favour of\nthe predicted universality of the Collins function and of a mild, if any,\nevolution with the hard scale of the asymmetries.\n", "  Ultracold atomic systems have been of great research interest in the past,\nwith more recent attention being paid to systems of mixed species. In this work\nwe carry out non-perturbative Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of N\ndistinguishable particles at finite temperature, which can be thought of as an\nultracold atomic system containing N distinct species. We use the PIMC approach\nto calculate thermodynamic properties of particles interacting via hard-sphere\nand hard-cavity potentials. The first problem we study is a two-particle system\ninteracting via a hard-sphere and hard-cavity interaction in order to test the\neffectiveness of two approximations for the thermal density matrix\ncorresponding to these potentials. We then apply the PIMC method to a system of\nmany hard-sphere particles under periodic boundary conditions at varying\ntemperature in order to calculate the energy per particle, pressure, and\nspecific heat of the system. We examine how finite-size effects impact the\nresults of PIMC simulations of hard-sphere particles and when the thermodynamic\nlimit has been reached. Our results provide microscopic benchmarks for a system\ncontaining distinguishable particles, which can be thought of as a limiting\ncase for ultracold atomic systems of mixed species.\n", "  We have investigated under which conditions hyperons (particularly $\\Lambda$s\nand $\\Sigma^-$s) can be found in the pasta phase. The larger the density and\nthe temperature and the smaller the electron fraction the higher the\nprobability that these particles appear but always in very small amounts.\n$\\Lambda$-hyperons only occur in the gas and in smaller amounts than would\noccur if matter were homogeneous, never with abundancies above 10$^{-5}$.\n  The amount of $\\Sigma^-$ in the gas is at least two orders of magnitude\nsmaller and can be disregarded in practical calculations.\n", "  We analyze the quantum evolution of a weakly nonlinear resonator due to a\nclassical near-resonant drive and damping. The resonator nonlinearity leads to\nsqueezing and heating of the resonator state. Using a hybrid\nphase-space--Fock-space representation for the resonator state within the\nGaussian approximation, we derive evolution equations for the four parameters\ncharacterizing the Gaussian state. Numerical solution of these four ordinary\ndifferential equations is much simpler and faster than simulation of the full\ndensity matrix evolution, while providing good accuracy for the system analysis\nduring transients and in the steady state. We show that steady-state squeezing\nof the resonator state is limited by 3 dB; however, this limit can be exceeded\nduring transients.\n", "  Geometrically thick tori with constant specific angular momentum have been\nwidely used in the last decades to construct numerical models of accretion\nflows onto black holes. Such discs are prone to a global non-axisymmetric\nhydrodynamic instability, known as Papaloizou-Pringle instability (PPI), which\ncan redistribute angular momentum and also lead to an emission of gravitational\nwaves. It is, however, not clear yet how the development of the PPI is affected\nby the presence of a magnetic field and by the concurrent development of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). We present a numerical analysis using\nthree-dimensional GRMHD simulations of the interplay between the PPI and the\nMRI considering, for the first time, an analytical magnetized equilibrium\nsolution as initial condition. In the purely hydrodynamic case, the PPI selects\nas expected the large-scale $m=1$ azimuthal mode as the fastest growing and\nnon-linearly dominant mode. However, when the torus is threaded by a weak\ntoroidal magnetic field, the development of the MRI leads to the suppression of\nlarge-scale modes and redistributes power across smaller scales. If the system\nstarts with a significantly excited $m=1$ mode, the PPI can be dominant in a\ntransient phase, before being ultimately quenched by the MRI. Such dynamics may\nwell be important in compact star mergers and tidal disruption events.\n", "  Recent experimental investigations by M. A{\\ss}mann et al. [Nature Mater. 15,\n741 (2016)] on the spectrum of magnetoexcitons in cuprous oxide revealed the\nstatistics of a Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). The model of F. Schweiner et\nal. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 046401 (2017)], which includes the complete cubic\nvalence band structure of the solid, can explain the appearance of GUE\nstatistics if the magnetic field is not oriented in one of the symmetry planes\nof the cubic lattice. However, it cannot explain the experimental observation\nof GUE statistics for all orientations of the field. In this paper we\ninvestigate the effect of quasi-particle interactions or especially the\nexciton-phonon interaction on the level statistics of magnetoexcitons and show\nthat the motional Stark field induced by the exciton-phonon interaction leads\nto the occurrence of GUE statistics for arbitrary orientations of the magnetic\nfield in agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, the breaking of\nall antiunitary symmetries can be explained only by considering both the\nexciton-phonon interaction and the cubic crystal lattice.\n", "  We investigate the variation of black hole masses (Mbh) as a function of\ntheir host galaxy stellar mass (Mstar) and half-light radius (Re). We confirm\nthat the scatter in Mbh within this plane is essentially the same as that in\nthe Mbh - sigma relation, as expected from the negligible scatter reported in\nthe virial mass estimator sigma_v^2=GxMstar/(5xRe). All variation in Mbh\nhappens along lines of constant sigma_v on the (Mstar, Re) plane, or Mstar\n$\\propto$ Re for Mstar <2x10^11 Msun. This trend is qualitatively the same as\nthose previously reported for galaxy properties related to stellar populations,\nlike age, metallicity, alpha enhancement, mass-to-light ratio and gas content.\nWe find evidence for a change in the Mbh variation above the critical mass of\nMcrit ~ 2x10^11 Msun. This behaviour can be explained assuming that Mbh in\ngalaxies less massive than Mcrit can be predicted by the Mbh - sigma relation,\nwhile Mbh in more massive galaxies follow a modified relation which is also\ndependent on Mstar once Mstar >Mcrit. This is consistent with the scenario\nwhere the majority of galaxies grow through star formation, while the most\nmassive galaxies undergo a sequence of dissipation-less mergers. In both\nchannels black holes and galaxies grow synchronously, giving rise to the black\nhole - host galaxy scaling relations, but there is no underlying single\nrelation that is universal across the full range of galaxy masses.\n", "  Continuum spectrum from black hole accretion disc holds enormous information\nregarding the strong gravity regime around the black hole and hence about the\nnature of gravitational interaction in extreme situations. Since in such strong\ngravity regime the dynamics of gravity should be modified from the \\EH one, its\neffect should be imprinted on the continuum spectrum originating from the black\nhole accretion. To explore the effects of these alternative theories on the\nblack hole continuum spectrum in an explicit manner, we have discussed three\nalternative gravitational models having their origin in three distinct\nparadigms --- (a) higher dimensions, (b) higher curvature gravity and (c)\nHorndeski theories. All of them can have signatures sculptured on the black\nhole continuum spectrum, distinct from the standard general relativistic\nscenario. Interestingly all these models exhibit black hole solutions with\ntidal charge parameter which in these alternative gravity scenarios can become\nnegative, in sharp contrast with the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. Using the\nobservational data of optical luminosity for eighty Palomer Green quasars we\nhave illustrated that the difference between the theoretical estimates and the\nobservational results gets minimized for negative values of the tidal charge\nparameter. As a quantitative estimate of this result we concentrate on several\nerror estimators, including reduced $\\chi^{2}$, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency,\nindex of agreement etc. Remarkably, all of them indicates a negative value of\nthe tidal charge parameter, signaling the possibility of higher dimensions as\nwell as scalar charge at play in those high gravity regimes.\n", "  Scaling laws in ecology, intended both as functional relationships among\necologically-relevant quantities and the probability distributions that\ncharacterize their occurrence, have long attracted the interest of empiricists\nand theoreticians. Empirical evidence exists of power laws associated with the\nnumber of species inhabiting an ecosystem, their abundances and traits.\nAlthough their functional form appears to be ubiquitous, empirical scaling\nexponents vary with ecosystem type and resource supply rate. The idea that\necological scaling laws are linked had been entertained before, but the full\nextent of macroecological pattern covariations, the role of the constraints\nimposed by finite resource supply and a comprehensive empirical verification\nare still unexplored. Here, we propose a theoretical scaling framework that\npredicts the linkages of several macroecological patterns related to species'\nabundances and body sizes. We show that such framework is consistent with the\nstationary state statistics of a broad class of resource-limited community\ndynamics models, regardless of parametrization and model assumptions. We verify\npredicted theoretical covariations by contrasting empirical data and provide\ntestable hypotheses for yet unexplored patterns. We thus place the observed\nvariability of ecological scaling exponents into a coherent statistical\nframework where patterns in ecology embed constrained fluctuations.\n", "  The geometerization of the renormalization group flow triggered by the\n$T\\bar{T}$ deformation of large $c$ conformal field theories in two dimensions\nis presented. This entails the construction of the off shell Einstein-Hilbert\naction in three dimensions from said renormalization group flow.\n  The crucial ingredient to this construction will be the encoding of general\ncovariance in the emergent bulk theory in a very particular form of the\nWess--Zumino consistency conditions. The utilisation of the local\nrenormalization group, which requires putting the theory under consideration on\nan arbitrary background geometry, supplemented by the aforementioned covariance\ncondition ensures that the whole construction is background independent.\n", "  We work out constraints imposed by channel duality and analyticity on\ntree-level amplitudes of four identical real scalars, with the assumptions of a\nlinear spectrum of exchanged particles and Regge asymptotic behaviour. We\nreduce the requirement of channel duality to a countably infinite set of\nequations in the general case. We show that channel duality uniquely fixes the\nsoft Regge behaviour of the amplitudes to that found in String theory,\n$(-s)^{2t}$. Specialising to the case of tachyonic external particles, we use\nchannel duality to show that the amplitude can be any one in an\ninfinite-dimensional parameter space, and present evidence that unitarity\ndoesn't significantly reduce the dimension of the space of amplitudes.\n", "  Understanding the nature of the turbulent fluctuations below the ion\ngyroradius in solar-wind turbulence is a great challenge. Recent studies have\nbeen mostly in favor of kinetic Alfv\\'en wave (KAW) type of fluctuations, but\nother kinds of fluctuations with characteristics typical of magnetosonic,\nwhistler and ion Bernstein modes, could also play a role depending on the\nplasma parameters. Here we investigate the properties of the sub-proton-scale\ncascade with high-resolution hybrid-kinetic simulations of freely-decaying\nturbulence in 3D3V phase space, including electron inertia effects. Two proton\nplasma beta are explored: the \"intermediate\" $\\beta_p=1$ and \"low\"\n$\\beta_p=0.2$ regimes, both typically observed in solar wind and corona. The\nmagnetic energy spectum exhibits $k_\\perp^{-8/3}$ and $k_\\|^{-7/2}$ power laws\nat $\\beta_p=1$, while they are slightly steeper at $\\beta_p=0.2$. Nevertheless,\nboth regimes develop a spectral anisotropy consistent with $k_\\|\\sim\nk_\\perp^{2/3}$ at $k_\\perp\\rho_p>1$, and pronounced small-scale intermittency.\nIn this context, we find that the kinetic-scale cascade is dominated by\nKAW-like fluctuations at $\\beta_p=1$, whereas the low-$\\beta$ case presents a\nmore complex scenario suggesting the simultaneous presence of different types\nof fluctuations. In both regimes, however, a non-negligible role of ion\nBernstein type of fluctuations at the smallest scales seems to emerge.\n", "  Engineering and enhancing inversion symmetry breaking in solids is a major\ngoal in condensed matter physics and materials science, as a route to advancing\nnew physics and applications ranging from improved ferroelectrics for memory\ndevices to materials hosting Majorana zero modes for quantum computing. Here,\nwe uncover a new mechanism for realising a much larger energy scale of\ninversion symmetry breaking at surfaces and interfaces than is typically\nachieved. The key ingredient is a pronounced asymmetry of surface hopping\nenergies, i.e. a kinetic energy-driven inversion symmetry breaking, whose\nenergy scale is pinned at a significant fraction of the bandwidth. We show,\nfrom spin- and angle-resolved photoemission, how this enables surface states of\n3d and 4d-based transition-metal oxides to surprisingly develop some of the\nlargest Rashba-like spin splittings that are known. Our findings open new\npossibilities to produce spin textured states in oxides which exploit the full\npotential of the bare atomic spin-orbit coupling, raising exciting prospects\nfor oxide spintronics. More generally, the core structural building blocks\nwhich enable this are common to numerous materials, providing the prospect of\nenhanced inversion symmetry breaking at judiciously-chosen surfaces of a\nplethora of compounds, and suggesting routes to interfacial control of\ninversion symmetry breaking in designer heterostructures.\n", "  I suggest a novel approach for deriving evolution equations for rapidly\nrotating relativistic stars affected by radiation-driven\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability. This approach is based on the\nmultipolar expansion of gravitational wave emission and appeals to the global\nphysical properties of the star (energy, angular momentum, and thermal state),\nbut not to canonical energy and angular momentum, which is traditional. It\nleads to simple derivation of the CFS instability criterion for normal modes\nand the evolution equations for a star, affected by this instability. The\napproach also gives a precise form to simple explanation of the CFS\ninstability: it occurs when two conditions met: (a) gravitational wave emission\nremoves angular momentum from the rotating star (thus releasing the rotation\nenergy) and (b) gravitational waves carry less energy, than the released amount\nof the rotation energy. Results are illustrated by r-mode instability in slowly\nrotating Newtonian stars. In resulting evolution equations emission of\ngravitational waves directly affects the spin frequency, being in line with the\narguments by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), but in contrast to widely accepted\nequations by Lindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000), there effective spin\nfrequency decrease is coupled with dissipation of unstable mode. This problem,\ninitially stressed by Levin & Ushomirsky (2001), is shown to be superficial,\nand arises as a result of definition of the effective spin frequency by\nLindblom et al. (1998); Ho & Lai (2000). Namely, it is shown, that if this\ndefinition is taken into account properly, the evolution equations coincide\nwith obtained here in the leading order in mode amplitude. I also argue that\nthe next-to-leading order terms in evolution equations (which differ for Owen\net al. 1998 and Ho & Lai 2000) require clarification and thus it would be more\nself-consistent to omit them.\n", "  AdS black holes exhibit van der Waals type phase transition. In the {\\it\nextended} phase-space formalism, the critical exponents for any spacetime\nmetric are identical to the standard ones. Motivated by this fact, we give a\ngeneral expression for the Helmholtz free energy near the critical point which\ncorrectly reproduces these exponents. The idea is similar to the Landau model\nwhich gives a phenomenological description of the usual second order phase\ntransition. Here two main inputs are taken into account for the analysis: (a)\nblack holes should have van der Waals like isotherms and (b) free energy can be\nexpressed solely as a function of thermodynamic volume and horizon temperature.\nResulting analysis shows that the form of Helmholtz free energy correctly\nencapsulates the features of Landau function. We also discuss the {\\it isolated\ncritical point} accompanied by nonstandard values of critical exponents. The\nwhole formalism is then extended to other two criticalities, namely $Y-X$ and\n$T-S$ (based on the standard; i.e. non-extended phase-space), where $X$ and $Y$\nare generalized force and displacement, whereas $T$ and $S$ are horizon\ntemperature and entropy. We observe that in the former case Gibbs free energy\nplays the role of Landau function, whereas in the later case that role is\nplayed by the internal energy (here it is black hole mass). Our analysis shows\nthat, although the existence of van der Waals phase transition depends on the\nexplicit form of the black hole metric, the values of the critical exponents\nare universal in nature.\n", "  We report on a strain-induced and temperature dependent uniaxial anisotropy\nin V$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni hybrid thin films, manifested through the interfacial\nstrain and sample microstructure, and its consequences on the angular dependent\nmagnetization reversal. X-ray diffraction and reciprocal space maps identify\nthe in-plane crystalline axes of the V$_{2}$O$_{3}$; atomic force and scanning\nelectron microscopy reveal oriented rips in the film microstructure.\nQuasi-static magnetometry and dynamic ferromagnetic resonance measurements\nidentify a uniaxial magnetic easy axis along the rips. Comparison with films\ngrown on sapphire without rips shows a combined contribution from strain and\nmicrostructure in the V$_{2}$O$_{3}$/Ni films. Magnetization reversal\ncharacteristics captured by angular-dependent first order reversal curve\nmeasurements indicate a strong domain wall pinning along the direction\northogonal to the rips, inducing an angular-dependent change in the reversal\nmechanism. The resultant anisotropy is tunable with temperature and is most\npronounced at room temperature, which is beneficial for potential device\napplications.\n", "  The distribution of electric fields within the electrochemical double layer\ndepends on both the electrode and electrolyte in complex ways. These fields\nstrongly influence chemical dynamics in the electrode-electrolyte interface,\nbut cannot be measured directly with sub-molecular resolution. We report\nexperimental capacitance measurements for aqueous interfaces of CO-terminated\nPt(111). By comparing these measurements with first-principles\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations, we infer microscopic field\ndistributions and decompose contributions to the inverse capacitance from\nvarious spatial regions of the interface. We find that the CO is strongly\nelectronically coupled to the Pt, and that most of the interfacial potential\ndifference appears across the gap between the terminating O and water, and not\nacross the CO molecule as previously hypothesized. This `gap capacitance'\nresulting from hydrophobic termination lowers the overall capacitance of the\naqueous Pt-CO interface, and makes it less sensitive to electrolyte\nconcentration compared to the bare metal.\n", "  We study the matter bispectrum of large structure by comparing theoretical\nmodels (perturbation theories and halo models) to numerical simulations using\nshape and amplitude correlators. We show that among the perturbation theories\nat one loop the effective field theory of large scale structure extends the\nfurthest into the non-linear regime. We analyse the one and two-loop bispectra\nin the renormalised perturbation theory and we show that there is a significant\nextension in the range where results are accurate when going to two loops. In\nthe case of the halo model, we show that there are deficiencies in the\nmodelling of the two-halo term at redshifts z>0 that worsen in the past. Based\non this observation and on the shapes identified in the halo model, we build a\nsimple `three-shape model' that provides a good fit to N-body simulations on\nall scales, at both low and high redshifts. We show that this model can be\neasily extended to local and equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity using the\nsame shapes.\n", "  Deviations from the standard model predictions have been reported in various\nobservables concerned with the lepton flavor universality. At present, the\ndeviation of the measured values of $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\\ast}}$ from the standard\nmodel expectation is exceeded by $2.3\\sigma$ and $3.4\\sigma$, respectively.\nVery recently LHCb has measured the ratio of branching ratio $R_{J/\\Psi} =\n\\mathcal B(B_c \\to J/\\Psi\\tau\\nu)/\\mathcal B(B_c \\to J/\\Psi\\,l\\,\\nu)$, where $l\n\\in (e,\\,\\mu)$, to be $0.71\\pm0.17\\pm 0.18$ which is at more than $2\\sigma$\naway from the standard model prediction. We investigate the anomalies in $R_D$,\n$R_{D^{\\ast}}$, and $R_{J/\\Psi}$ using a model independent framework with\nminimal number of new physics couplings. We find various new physics models\nthat can explain these anomalies within $1\\sigma$.\n", "  For a continued progress in the pursuit of neutrino oscillation parameters,\nwe require to have a precise knowledge of the pion production processes which\nact as a source of backgrounds and systematic uncertainties in neutrino\noscillation experiments because pions can mimic a final state electron\n(positron). Therefore a pion production principal interaction may appear to be\nquasi-elastic if the pion is absorbed in the final state interactions.\nCharged-current single pion production processes induced by $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and\n$\\bar{\\nu_{\\mu}}$ interactions with hydrocarbon target $(CH_{2})$ has been\nstudied using NuWro event generator and the cross-sections so obtained have\nbeen compared with the results of Miner$\\nu$A experiment.\n", "  A new analytical expression for the size-dependent bandgap of colloidal\nsemiconductor nanocrystals is proposed within the framework of the finite-depth\nsquare-well effective mass approximation in order to provide a quantitative\ndescription of the quantum confinement effect. This allows one to convert\noptical spectroscopic data (photoluminescence spectrum and absorbance edge)\ninto accurate estimates for the particle size distributions of colloidal\nsystems even if the traditional effective mass model is expected to fail, which\noccurs typically for very small particles belonging to the so-called strong\nconfinement limit. By applying the reported theoretical methodologies to CdTe\nnanocrystals synthesized through wet chemical routes, size distributions are\ninferred and compared directly to those obtained from atomic force microscopy\nand transmission electron microscopy. This analysis can be used as a\ncomplementary tool for the characterization of nanocrystal samples of many\nother systems such as the II-VI and III-V semiconductor materials.\n", "  We consider the phase-integral method applied to an arbitrary ordinary linear\ndifferential equation of the second order and study how its symmetries affect\nthe connection matrices associated with its general solution. We reduce the\nobtained exact general relation for the matrices to its limiting case\nintroducing a concept of the effective Stokes constant. We also propose a\nconcept of an effective Stokes diagram which can be a useful tool of analysing\nof difficult equations. We show that effective Stokes domains which can be\noverlapped by a symmetry transformation are associated with the same effective\nStokes constant and can be described by the same analytical function. Basing on\nthe derived symmetry relations we propose a way to write functional equations\nfor the effective Stokes constants. Finally, we provide a generalization of the\nderived symmetry relations for the case of an arbitrary order linear system of\nthe ordinary linear differential equations. This work also contains an example\nof usage of the presented ideas in a case of a real physical problem.\n", "  We present a study of elastic metamaterial that possesses multiple local\nresonances. We demonstrated that the elastic metamaterial can have\nsimultaneously three negative effective parameters, i.e., negative effective\nmass, effective bulk modulus and effective shear modulus at a certain frequency\nrange. Through the analysis of the resonant field, it has been elucidated that\nthe three negative parameters are induced by dipolar, monopolar and quadrupolar\nresonance respectively. The dipolar and monopolar resonances result into the\nnegative band for longitudinal waves, while the dipolar and quadrupolar\nresonances cause the negative band for transverse waves. The two bands have an\noverlapping frequency regime. A simultaneously negative refraction for both\nlongitudinal waves and transverse waves has been demonstrated in the system.\n", "  It is still a challenge to experimentally realize shortcuts to adiabaticity\n(STA) for a non-Hermitian quantum system since a non-Hermitian quantum system's\ncounterdiabatic driving Hamiltonian contains some unrealizable auxiliary\ncontrol fields. In this paper, we relax the strict condition in constructing\nSTA and propose a method to redesign a realizable supplementary Hamiltonian to\nconstruct non-Hermitian STA. The redesigned supplementary Hamiltonian can be\neithersymmetric or asymmetric. For the sake of clearness, we apply this method\nto an Allen-Eberly model as an example to verify the validity of the optimized\nnon-Hermitian STA. The numerical simulation demonstrates that a ultrafast\npopulation inversion could be realized in a two-level non-Hermitian system.\n", "  Gravitational waves have been detected from a binary neutron star merger\nevent, GW170817. The detection of electromagnetic radiation from the same\nsource has shown that the merger occurred in the outskirts of the galaxy NGC\n4993, at a distance of 40 megaparsecs from Earth. We report the detection of a\ncounterpart radio source that appears 16 days after the event, allowing us to\ndiagnose the energetics and environment of the merger. The observed radio\nemission can be explained by either a collimated ultra-relativistic jet viewed\noff-axis, or a cocoon of mildly relativistic ejecta. Within 100 days of the\nmerger, the radio light curves will distinguish between these models and very\nlong baseline interferometry will have the capability to directly measure the\nangular velocity and geometry of the debris.\n", "  Merging neutron stars offer an exquisite laboratory for simultaneously\nstudying strong-field gravity and matter in extreme environments. We establish\nthe physical association of an electromagnetic counterpart EM170817 to\ngravitational waves (GW170817) detected from merging neutron stars. By\nsynthesizing a panchromatic dataset, we demonstrate that merging neutron stars\nare a long-sought production site forging heavy elements by r-process\nnucleosynthesis. The weak gamma-rays seen in EM170817 are dissimilar to\nclassical short gamma-ray bursts with ultra-relativistic jets. Instead, we\nsuggest that breakout of a wide-angle, mildly-relativistic cocoon engulfing the\njet elegantly explains the low-luminosity gamma-rays, the high-luminosity\nultraviolet-optical-infrared and the delayed radio/X-ray emission. We posit\nthat all merging neutron stars may lead to a wide-angle cocoon breakout;\nsometimes accompanied by a successful jet and sometimes a choked jet.\n", "  Following the reported discovery of the gravitational-wave pulse GW170817/\nG298048 by three LIGO/Virgo antennae (Abbott et al., 2017a), the MASTER Global\nRobotic Net telescopes obtained the first image of the NGC 4993 galaxy after\nthe NS+NS merging. The optical transient MASTER OTJ130948.10-232253.3/SSS17a\nwas later found, which appears to be a kilonova resulting from a merger of two\nneutron stars. In this paper we report the independent detection and photometry\nof the kilonova made in white light and in B, V, and R filters. We note that\nluminosity of the discovered kilonova NGC 4993 is very close to another\npossible kilonova proposed early GRB 130603 and GRB 080503.\n", "  The merger of two neutron stars is predicted to give rise to three major\ndetectable phenomena: a short burst of gamma-rays, a gravitational wave signal,\nand a transient optical/near-infrared source powered by the synthesis of large\namounts of very heavy elements via rapid neutron capture (the r-process). Such\ntransients, named \"macronovae\" or \"kilonovae\", are believed to be centres of\nproduction of rare elements such as gold and platinum. The most compelling\nevidence so far for a kilonova was a very faint near-infrared rebrightening in\nthe afterglow of a short gamma-ray burst at z = 0.356, although findings\nindicating bluer events have been reported. Here we report the spectral\nidentification and describe the physical properties of a bright kilonova\nassociated with the gravitational wave source GW 170817 and gamma-ray burst GRB\n170817A associated with a galaxy at a distance of 40 Mpc from Earth. Using a\nseries of spectra from ground-based observatories covering the wavelength range\nfrom the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, we find that the kilonova is\ncharacterized by rapidly expanding ejecta with spectral features similar to\nthose predicted by current models. The ejecta is optically thick early on, with\na velocity of about 0.2 times light speed, and reaches a radius of about 50\nastronomical units in only 1.5 days. As the ejecta expands, broad\nabsorption-like lines appear on the spectral continuum indicating atomic\nspecies produced by nucleosynthesis that occurs in the post-merger fast-moving\ndynamical ejecta and in two slower (0.05 times light speed) wind regions.\nComparison with spectral models suggests that the merger ejected 0.03-0.05\nsolar masses of material, including high-opacity lanthanides.\n", "  Purpose: To develop a fast magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method for\nquantitative chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging.\n  Methods: We implemented a CEST-MRF method to quantify the chemical exchange\nrate and volume fraction of the N${\\alpha}$-amine protons of L-arginine (L-Arg)\nphantoms and the amide and semi-solid exchangeable protons of in vivo rat brain\ntissue. L-Arg phantoms were made with different concentrations (25-100 mM) and\npH (pH 4-6). The MRF acquisition schedule varied the saturation power randomly\nfor 30 iterations (phantom: 0-6 ${\\mu}$T; in vivo: 0-4 ${\\mu}$T) with a total\nacquisition time of <=2 minutes. The signal trajectories were pattern-matched\nto a large dictionary of signal trajectories simulated using the\nBloch-McConnell equations for different combinations of exchange rate,\nexchangeable proton volume fraction, and water T1 and T2* relaxation times.\n  Results: The chemical exchange rates of the N${\\alpha}$-amine protons of\nL-Arg were significantly (p<0.0001) correlated with the rates measured with the\nQuantitation of Exchange using Saturation Power method. Similarly, the L-Arg\nconcentrations determined using MRF were significantly (p<0.0001) correlated\nwith the known concentrations. The pH dependence of the exchange rate was well\nfit (R2=0.9186) by a base catalyzed exchange model. The amide proton exchange\nrate measured in rat brain cortex (36.3+-12.9 Hz) was in good agreement with\nthat measured previously with the Water Exchange spectroscopy method (28.6+-7.4\nHz). The semi-solid proton volume fraction was elevated in white (11.2+-1.7%)\ncompared to gray (7.6+-1.8%) matter brain regions in agreement with previous\nmagnetization transfer studies.\n  Conclusion: CEST-MRF provides a method for fast, quantitative CEST imaging.\n", "  The cost-effectiveness and practical harmlessness of ultrasound imaging have\nmade it one of the most widespread tools for medical diagnosis. Unfortunately,\nthe beam-forming based image formation produces granular speckle noise,\nblurring, shading and other artifacts. To overcome these effects, the ultimate\ngoal would be to reconstruct the tissue acoustic properties by solving a full\nwave propagation inverse problem. In this work, we make a step towards this\ngoal, using Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). As a result,\nwe are able to reconstruct CT-quality images from the reflected ultrasound\nradio-frequency(RF) data obtained by simulation from real CT scans of a human\nbody. We also show that CNN is able to imitate existing computationally heavy\ndespeckling methods, thereby saving orders of magnitude in computations and\nmaking them amenable to real-time applications.\n", "  The direct dynamical paths leading to Associative Detachment (AD) in the\ngas-phase, and specifically in the low-temperature regions of the Dark\nMolecular Clouds (DMC) in the ISM, or in cold trap laboratory experiments, are\ninvestigated with quantum chemical methods by using a high-level\nmulti-reference Configuration Interaction (CI) approach that employs single and\ndouble excitations plus Davidson perturbative correction [MRSDCI(Q)] and the\nd-aug-cc-pV5Z basis set. The potential energy curves for H + CN- are\nconstructed for different directions of the H partner approaching the CN- anion\nwithin the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. The present\ncalculations found that the AD energetics at low temperature becomes favorable\nonly along a selected range of approaching directions, thus showing that there\nis a preferred path of forming HCN at low temperatures, while that of forming\nits HNC isomer is found to be energetically forbidden. Given the existence in\nthe ISM of different HCN/HNC ratios in different environments, we discuss the\nimplications of our findings for selective formation of either isomer in the\nlow-temperature conditions of the Molecular Cloud Cores.\n", "  The author studies the structure of space $ \\mathbf {L} _ {2} (G) $ of\nvector-valued functions that are square integrable in a bounded connected\ndomain $ G $ of the three-dimensional space with a smooth boundary and the role\nof gradient divergence operators and the rotor in the construction of bases in\nsubspaces $ {\\mathcal {{A}}} $ and $ {\\mathcal {{B}}} $.\n  The self-adjointness of the extension $ \\mathcal {N} _d $ of operator $\n\\nabla \\mathrm {div} $ to the subspace $ \\mathcal {A} _ {\\gamma} \\subset\n{\\mathcal {{A}}} $ and the basicity system of its own functions.

Overview measurements were performed with a full width\nat half maximum bandpass of $\\Delta E =17$~meV, covering the energy range 20~eV\n-- 56~eV. Details of the PI spectrum were investigated at energy resolutions\nreaching the level of $\\Delta E=3.3$~meV. The photon energy scale was\ncalibrated with an uncertainty of $\\pm5$~meV. By comparison with previous\nabsolute measurements %by Kjeldsen et al in the energy range 28~eV -- 30.5~eV\nand by Lyon et al in the energy range 28~eV -- 43~eV the present experimental\nhigh-resolution data were normalised to an absolute cross-section scale and the\nfraction of metastable Ca$^{+}$ ions that were present in the parent ion beam\nwas determined to be 18$\\pm$4\\%. Large-scale R-matrix calculations using the\nDirac Coulomb approximation and employing 594 levels in the close-coupling\nexpansion were performed for the Ca$^{+}(3s^23p^64s~^2\\textrm{S}_{1/2})$ and\nCa$^{+}(3s^2 3p^6 3d~^2\\textrm{D}_{3/2,5/2})$ levels. The experimental data are\ncompared with the results of these calculations and previous theoretical and\nexperimental studies.\n", "  Little is known about the portion of the Milky Way lying beyond the Galactic\ncenter at distances of more than 9 kilo-parsec from the Sun. These regions are\nopaque at optical wavelengths due to absorption by interstellar dust, and\ndistances are very large and hard to measure. We report a direct trigonometric\nparallax distance of 20.4_{-2.2}^{+2.8} kilo-parsec obtained with the Very Long\nBaseline Array to a water maser source in a region of active star formation.\nThese measurements allow us to shed light on Galactic spiral structure by\nlocating the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm as it passes through the far side of\nthe Milky Way, and to validate a kinematic method for determining distances in\nthis region based on transverse motions.\n", "  Results of an updated global electoweak fit to the Standard Model (SM) are\npresented, where special attention is paid to some key observables, such as the\nweak mixing angle, the $W$ boson mass, and the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nmuon. Implications for new physics beyond the SM are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of irreversible quantum\nCarnot engines that perform finite-time cycles between two temperature tunable\nbaths. The temperature form we adopt can be experimentally realized in squeezed\nbaths in the high temperature limit, which makes our proposal of practical\nrelevance. Focusing on low dissipation engines, we first generalize the\npervious upper as well as lower bounds for the EMP to temperature tunable cases\nin which they are solely determined by a generalized Carnot limit. As an\nillustrative example, we then consider a minimal heat engine model with a\ntwo-level spin as the working medium. It mimics a low dissipation engine as\nconfirmed by finite time thermodynamic optimization results. The so-obtained\nEMP, being constrained by the generalized bounds, is well described by a\ngeneralized Curzon- Ahlborn efficiency as consequences of a left/right symmetry\nfor a rate constant and low dissipations. Intriguing features of this minimal\nheat engine under optimal power output are also demonstrated.\n", "  We propose a modification of the standard inverse scattering transform for\nthe focusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (also other equations by natural\ngeneralization) formulated with nonzero boundary conditions at infinity. The\npurpose is to deal with arbitrary-order poles and potentially severe spectral\nsingularities in a simple and unified way. As an application, we use the\nmodified transform to place the Peregrine solution and related higher-order\n\"rogue wave\" solutions in an inverse-scattering context for the first time.\nThis allows one to directly study properties of these solutions such as their\ndynamical or structural stability, or their asymptotic behavior in the limit of\nhigh order. The modified transform method also allows rogue waves to be\ngenerated on top of other structures by elementary Darboux transformations,\nrather than the generalized Darboux transformations in the literature or other\nrelated limit processes.\n", "  A number of recent papers have provided evidence that practical design\nquestions about neural networks may be tackled theoretically by studying the\nbehavior of random networks. However, until now the tools available for\nanalyzing random neural networks have been relatively ad-hoc. In this work, we\nshow that the distribution of pre-activations in random neural networks can be\nexactly mapped onto lattice models in statistical physics. We argue that\nseveral previous investigations of stochastic networks actually studied a\nparticular factorial approximation to the full lattice model. For random linear\nnetworks and random rectified linear networks we show that the corresponding\nlattice models in the wide network limit may be systematically approximated by\na Gaussian distribution with covariance between the layers of the network. In\neach case, the approximate distribution can be diagonalized by Fourier\ntransformation. We show that this approximation accurately describes the\nresults of numerical simulations of wide random neural networks. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that in each case the large scale behavior of the random networks\ncan be approximated by an effective field theory.\n", "  The entropy is one of the fundamental states of a fluid and, in the viscous\ncase, the equation that it satisfies is highly singular in the region close to\nthe vacuum. In spite of its importance in the gas dynamics, the mathematical\nanalyses on the behavior of the entropy near the vacuum region, were rarely\ncarried out; in particular, in the presence of vacuum, either at the far field\nor at some isolated interior points, it was unknown if the entropy remains its\nboundedness. The results obtained in this paper indicate that the ideal gases\nretain their uniform boundedness of the entropy, locally or globally in time,\nif the vacuum occurs at the far field only and the density decays slowly enough\nat the far field. Precisely, we consider the Cauchy problem to the\none-dimensional full compressible Navier-Stokes equations without heat\nconduction, and establish the local and global existence and uniqueness of\nentropy-bounded solutions, in the presence of vacuum at the far field only. It\nis also shown that, different from the case that with compactly supported\ninitial density, the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, with slowly decaying\ninitial density, can propagate the regularities in the inhomogeneous Sobolev\nspaces.\n", "  We study monogamy relations for arbitrary dimensional multipartite systems.\nMonogamy relations based on concurrence and concurrence of assistance for any\ndimensional $m_1\\otimes m_2\\otimes...\\otimes m_{N}$ quantum states are derived,\nwhich give rise to the restrictions on the entanglement distributions among the\nsubsystems. Besides, we give the lower bound of concurrence for four-partite\nmixed states. The approach can be readily generalized to arbitrary multipartite\nsystems.\n", "  The imaginary part of the inter-quarks potential of moving heavy quarkonia is\ninvestigated in a dual supergravity of the AdS background deformed by dilaton,\nwhich induces the gauge field condensate in the dual gauge theory. We analyze\nthe quark anti-quark pair moving transverse and parallel to the plasma wind,\nrespectively. It is shown that for both cases the presence of D-instanton\ndensity tends to increase the inter-distance and decrease the imaginary\npotential, reverse to the effect of the pair's velocity. Moreover, it is found\nthat the D-instanton density has stronger effects for the parallel case rather\nthan transverse.\n", "  We report the study on superconducting pairing mechanism of FeSe via the\npair-breaking effects induced by H$^+$-irradiation combined with\nlow-temperature specific heat measurements. A multi-gap structure with nodes or\ngap minima is suggested in a clean FeSe by the specific heat results. The\nsuppression of critical temperature $T_c$ with increasing the defect density\nmanifests a two-step behavior. When the increase in the residual resistivity is\nsmall, $\\Delta\\rho_0$ $<$ $\\sim$4.5 $\\mu\\Omega$cm, $T_c$ is gradually\nsuppressed with increasing the density of scattering centers, suggesting the\npresence of symmetry-unprotected nodes or gap minima. However, for\n$\\Delta\\rho_0$ $>$ $\\sim$4.5 $\\mu\\Omega$cm, $T_c$ is almost independent of the\nscattering, which indicates that the nodes or gap minima are lifted and the\norder parameter becomes almost isotropic without sign change. Thus, the\nsuperconductivity in FeSe is found to be realized in symmetry-unprotected nodal\nor highly anisotropic $s_{++}$ state.\n", "  The Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) generates intriguing chiral\nmagnetic objects such as magnetic skyrmions and chiral domain walls that can be\nused as building blocks in emerging magnetic nanodevices. To achieve better\nstability and functionality of these chiral objects, it is essential to achieve\na larger DMI. In this paper, we report an experimental observation that in\nmagnetic trilayer films, the DMI strength is mainly determined by the work\nfunctions of the nonmagnetic layers interfaced with the magnetic layer. The\nclear correlation with the intrinsic material parameters provides a guideline\nfor material selection to engineer the DMI strength.\n", "  This study developed a method to measure compound-specific chlorine\nisotopologue distribution of organochlorines for source identification and\napportionment. Complete chlorine isotopologues of individual model\norganochlorines were detected by gas chromatography-high resolution mass\nspectrometry (GC-HRMS). The measured relative abundances (RAmea), simulated\nrelative abundances (RAsim), and relative variations between RAmea and RAsim\n(${\\Delta}$RA) were obtained on basis of the detected MS signal intensities of\nindividual isotopologues. The method has been partially validated in precision,\ninjection-amount dependency and temporal drifts. The standard deviations (SDs)\nof RAmea of all istotopologues of perchlorethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene\n(TCE) from different manufacturers were 0.002%-0.069%. The SDs of ${\\Delta}$RA\nof the first three isotopologues of PCE and TCE from different manufacturers\nwere 0.026%-0.155%. The ${\\Delta}$RA and ${\\Delta}$RA patterns of the standards\nof PCE and TCE from different manufacturers were able to be differentiated with\nstatistical significance. The method has been successfully applied to an\nanalogous case of source identification and apportionment for two\ntrichlorodiphenyls that exhibited significant chlorine isotope fractionation on\nthe GC-HRMS system. The results demonstrate that the ${\\Delta}$RA in\nconjunction with isotope ratios can be applied to source identification and\npresent high-validity identification outcomes. Moreover, the RAmea can be used\nto implement source apportionment for organochlorines from more sources with\nmore reliable outcomes compared with the methods using isotope ratios only.\nThis method opens a new way to perform fingerprinting analysis of\ncompound-specific chlorine isotopologue distribution of organochlorines, and\nwill be a promising high-performance approach in source delineation and\napportionment for chlorinated organic compounds.\n", "  Carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) may have been the carriers of water, volatile\nand moderately volatile elements to Earth. Investigating the abundances of\nthese elements, their relative volatility, and isotopes of state-change tracer\nelements such as Zn, and linking these observations to water contents, provide\nvital information on the processes that govern the abundances and isotopic\nsignatures of these species in CCs and other planetary bodies. Here we report\nZn isotopic data for 28 CCs (20 CM, 6 CR, 1 C2-ung, and 1 CV3), as well as\ntrace element data for Zn, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, and Bi in 16 samples (8 CM, 6 CR, 1\nC2-ung, and 1 CV3), that display a range of elemental abundances from\ncase-normative to intensely depleted. We use these data, water content data\nfrom literature and Zn isotopes to investigate volatile depletions and to\ndiscern between closed and open system heating. Trace element data have been\nused to construct relative volatility scales among the elements for the CM and\nCR chondrites. From least volatile to most, the scale in CM chondrites is\nPb-Sn-Bi-In-Zn-Tl, and for CR chondrites it is Tl-Zn-Sn-Pb-Bi-In. These\nobservations suggest that heated CM and CR chondrites underwent volatile loss\nunder different conditions to one another and to that of the solar nebula, e.g.\ndiffering oxygen fugacities. Furthermore, the most water and volatile depleted\nsamples are highly enriched in the heavy isotopes of Zn. Taken together, these\nlines of evidence strongly indicate that heated CM and CR chondrites incurred\nopen system heating, stripping them of water and volatiles concomitantly,\nduring post-accretionary shock impact(s).\n", "  We demonstrate strong coupling between travelling magnons in an Yttrium Iron\nGarnet film and 3D microwave cavity photons at milli-Kelvin temperatures. The\ncoupling strength of $350$MHz or $7.3$\\% of resonance frequency is observed.\nThe magnonic subsystem is represented by the Damon-Eshbach magnetostatic\nsurface wave with a distribution of wave numbers giving the linewidth of 15MHz.\nThe ways to improve this parameter are discussed. The energy gap in the\nspectrum given by the Zeeman energy and the shape-anisotropy energy in the film\ngeometry give rise to a significant asymmetry of the double peak structure of\nthe photon-magnon avoided level crossing. A structure of two parallel YIG films\nis investigated using the same re-entrant magnetostatic surface wave transducer\nrevealing a higher order magnon modes existing in both films. Combination of a\nmulti-post re-entrant cavity and multiple films is a potential base for\nengineering both magnon and photon spectra.\n", "  Rogue waves named by oceanographers are ubiquitous in nature and appear in a\nvariety of different contexts such as water waves, liquid Helium, nonlinear\noptics, microwave cavities, etc. In this letter, we propose a novel type of\nexact (2+1)-dimensional rogue waves which may be found in many physical fields\ndescribed by integrable and nonintegrable models. This type of rogue waves are\nclosely related to invisible lumps. Usually, a lump is an algebraically\nlocalized wave in space but visible at any time. Whence a lump induces a\nsoliton, the lump will become invisible before or after a fixed time. If a\nbounded twin soliton is induced by a lump, the lump will become a rogue wave\n(or instanton) and can only be visible at an instant time. Because of the\nexistence of the induced visible solitons, the rogue wave may be predictable in\nsome senses. For instance, the height, the position and the arrival time of the\nrogue wave can be predictable. The idea is illustrated by the celebrate\n(2+1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation in its extended form.\n", "  We give in this paper an explicit construction of the covariant quantization\nof the rank-two massless tensor field on de Sitter space (linear covariant\nquantum gravity on a de Sitter background). The main ingredient of the\nconstruction is an indecomposable representation of de Sitter group. We here\nmake the choice of a specific simple gauge fixing. We show that our gauge\nfixing eliminates any infrared divergence in the two-point function for the\ntraceless part of this field. But it is not possible to do the same for the\npure trace part (conformal sector). We describe the related Krein space\nstructure and covariant field operators. This work is in the continuation of\nour previous ones concerning the massless minimally coupled scalar fields and\nthe massive tensor field on de Sitter.\n", "  Periodic (almost monochromatic) gravitational waves emitted by rotating,\nasymmetric neutron stars are intriguing potential signals in the sensitivity\nband of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. These signals are related\nto elastic and magnetic stresses in the neutron-star interior, as well as to\nvarious possible instabilities, and thus are interesting from the point of view\nof the largely-unknown neutron star structure. I will describe the main\nchallenges related to these searches, the current state of the data-analysis\nmethods and plans for the future.\n", "  Given a real-world graph, how can we measure relevance scores for ranking and\nlink prediction? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides an excellent measure\nfor this and has been applied to various applications such as friend\nrecommendation, community detection, anomaly detection, etc. However, RWR\nsuffers from two problems: 1) using the same restart probability for all the\nnodes limits the expressiveness of random walk, and 2) the restart probability\nneeds to be manually chosen for each application without theoretical\njustification. We have two main contributions in this paper. First, we propose\nRandom Walk with Extended Restart (RWER), a random walk based measure which\nimproves the expressiveness of random walks by using a distinct restart\nprobability for each node. The improved expressiveness leads to superior\naccuracy for ranking and link prediction. Second, we propose SuRe (Supervised\nRestart for RWER), an algorithm for learning the restart probabilities of RWER\nfrom a given graph. SuRe eliminates the need to heuristically and manually\nselect the restart parameter for RWER. Extensive experiments show that our\nproposed method provides the best performance for ranking and link prediction\ntasks, improving the MAP (Mean Average Precision) by up to 15.8% on the best\ncompetitor.\n", "  Efficient assessment of convolved hidden Markov models is discussed. The\nbottom-layer is defined as an unobservable categorical first-order Markov\nchain, while the middle-layer is assumed to be a Gaussian spatial variable\nconditional on the bottom-layer. Hence, this layer appear as a Gaussian mixture\nspatial variable unconditionally. We observe the top-layer as a convolution of\nthe middle-layer with Gaussian errors. Focus is on assessment of the\ncategorical and Gaussian mixture variables given the observations, and we\noperate in a Bayesian inversion framework. The model is defined to make\ninversion of subsurface seismic AVO data into lithology/fluid classes and to\nassess the associated elastic material properties. Due to the spatial coupling\nin the likelihood functions, evaluation of the posterior normalizing constant\nis computationally demanding, and brute-force, single-site updating Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithms converges far too slow to be useful. We construct\ntwo classes of approximate posterior models which we assess analytically and\nefficiently using the recursive Forward-Backward algorithm. These approximate\nposterior densities are used as proposal densities in an independent proposal\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, to assess the correct posterior model. A\nset of synthetic realistic examples are presented. The proposed approximations\nprovides efficient proposal densities which results in acceptance probabilities\nin the range 0.10-0.50 in the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. A case study\nof lithology/fluid seismic inversion is presented. The lithology/fluid classes\nand the elastic material properties can be reliably predicted.\n", "  Taking into account the negative searches for New Physics at the LHC,\nelectroweak effective theories are appropriate to deal with current energies.\nTracks of new, higher scales can be studied through next-to leading order\ncorrections of the electroweak effective theory. We assume a generic non-linear\nrealization of the electroweak symmetry breaking with a singlet Higgs and a\nstrongly-coupled UV-completion. We further consider a high-energy Lagrangian\nthat incorporates explicitly a general set of new heavy fields. After\nintegrating out these heavy resonances, we study the pattern of low-energy\nconstants among the light fields, which are generated by the massive states.\n", "  We investigate topological phase transitions in Chern insulators within\nthree-band models, focusing on the empty band and lowest band populated by\nspinless fermions. We consider Lieb and kagome lattices and notice phase\ntransitions driven by the hopping integral between nearest-neighbors, which\nleads to the change of the lowest band Chern number from $C=1$ to $C=-1$. In\nthe single-particle picture, different phases are examined by investigating\ncorresponding entanglement spectra and the evolution of the entanglement\nentropy. Entanglement spectra reveal the spectral flow characteristic of\ntopologically nontrivial systems before and after phase transitions. For the\nlowest band with $1/3$ filling, Fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases are\nidentified by examining the ground state momenta, the spectral flow, and\ncounting of the entanglement energy levels below the gap in the entanglement\nspectrum. A quasilinear dependence of the entanglement entropy $\\alpha(n_A)$\nterm is observed for FCI phase, similarly to linear behavior expected for\nLaughlin phase in the fractional quantum Hall effect. At the topological phase\ntransition, for both empty and partially filled lowest bands, the energy gap\nclosure and a discontinuity in the entanglement entropy are observed. This\ncoincides with the divergence of a standard deviation of the Berry curvature.\nWe notice also a phase transition driven by the nearest-neighbor interaction in\nthe Lieb lattice, where the many-body energy gap closes. The phase transitions\nare shown to be stable for an arbitrary system size, thus predicted to be\npresent in the thermodynamic limit. While our calculations are performed for an\ninteraction energy far exceeding the gap between the two lowest energy bands,\nwe note that the higher band does not affect the phase transitions, however\ndestabilizes FCI phases.\n", "  In the field of molecular electronics thin films of molecules adsorbed on\ninsulating surfaces are used as the functional building blocks of electronic\ndevices. A control of the structural and electronic properties of the thin\nfilms is required for a reliable operating mode of such devices. Here,\nnoncontact atomic force and Kelvin probe force microscopies have been used to\ninvestigate the growth and electronic properties of pentacene on KBr(001) and\nKCl(001) surfaces. Mainly molecular islands of upright standing pentacene are\nformed, whereas a new phase of tilted molecules appear near step edges on some\nKBr samples. Local contact potential differences (LCPD) have been studied with\nboth Kelvin experiments and density-functional theory calculations. Large LCPD\nare found between the substrate and the differently oriented molecules, which\nmay be explained by a partial charge transfer from the pentacene to the\nsurface. The monitoring of the changes of the pentacene islands during\ndewetting shows that multilayers build up at the expense of monolayers.\nMoreover, in the Kelvin images, previously unknown line defects appear, which\nunveil the epitaxial growth of pentacene crystals.\n", "  We show that mock automorphic forms obtained from weak harmonic Maa{\\ss}\nforms give rise to nontrivial $(\\mathfrak g,K)$-cohomology, providing evidence\nfor replacing the `holomorphic' condition with `cohomological' when\ngeneralizing to general reductive groups. We note that such a candidate allows\nfor growing Fourier coefficients, in contrast to automorphic forms under the\nMiatello-Wallach conjecture. The second part of this note surveys the\nconnection with BPS black hole counts as a physical motivation for introducing\nmock automorphic forms.\n", "  The energy spectrum of the cosmic radiation in the range\n10$^{19}$-2.4$\\times$10$^{21}$ eV has been recently predicted showing a rich\nand distinctive staircase profile. In order to check the prediction, the\nspectra measured by running and past experiments above 10$^{19}$ eV are\nexamined. The computed spectrum compares more favourably with the Telescope\nArray, HiRes I and Yakutsk data rather than with the Auger data in the range\n(1-20)$\\times$10$^{19}$ eV. Previous flux measurements by Haverah Park, {\\sc\nsugar}, {\\sc agasa} and Fly's Eye experiments are above the predicted spectrum\nin the limited band (1-30)$\\times$10$^{19}$ eV. The flux measured by the Auger\nGroup in the band (8-18)$\\times$10$^{19}$ eV is below those of all other\nexperiments and below the prediction.\n  The energy scales of the instruments might be at the origin of the flux\nmismatch among the experiments. Accordingly, the energy scales of all the\neleven instruments operating above 10$^{20}$ eV are examined and the major\ninconsistencies discerned. The paucity of events above 10$^{20}$ eV of the\nAuger experiment with respect to all others is by far the major puzzle emerging\nfrom this scrutiny. The Auger instrument recorded only 4 events above 10$^{20}$\neV with an exposure exceeding 42500 km$^{2}$ sr year while the Telescope Array\nrecorded 13 events with an exposure of 8100 km$^{2}$ sr year. A tentative\nsolution of this puzzle is ventilated.\n", "  The extragalactic background radiation produced by distant galaxies emitting\nin the far infrared limits the sensitivity of telescopes operating in this\nrange due to confusion. We have constructed a model of the infrared background\nbased on numerical simulations of the large-scale structure of the Universe and\nthe evolution of dark matter halos. The predictions of this model agree well\nwith the existing data on source counts. We have constructed maps of a sky\nfield with an area of 1 deg$^2$ directly from our simulated observations and\nmeasured the confusion limit. At wavelengths $100-300$ $\\mu$m the confusion\nlimit for a 10-m telescope has been shown to be at least an order of magnitude\nlower than that for a 3.5-m one. A spectral analysis of the simulated infrared\nbackground maps clearly reveals the large-scale structure of the Universe. The\ntwo-dimensional power spectrum of these maps has turned out to be close to that\nmeasured by space observatories in the infrared. However, the fluctuations in\nthe number of intensity peaks observed in the simulated field show no clear\ncorrelation with superclusters of galaxies; the large-scale structure has\nvirtually no effect on the confusion limit.\n", "  Many-body perturbation theory is often formulated in terms of an expansion in\nthe dressed instead of the bare Green's function, and in the screened instead\nof the bare Coulomb interaction. However, screening can be calculated on\ndifferent levels of approximation, and it is important to define what is the\nmost appropriate choice. We explore this question by studying a\nzero-dimensional model (so called 'one-point model') that retains the structure\nof the full equations. We study both linear and non-linear response\napproximations to the screening. We find that an expansion in terms of the\nscreening in the random phase approximation is the most promising way for an\napplication in real systems. Moreover, by making use of the nonperturbative\nfeatures of the Kadanoff-Baym equation for the one-body Green's function, we\nobtain an approximate solution in our model that is very promising, although\nits applicability to real systems has still to be explored.\n", "  Motivated by the recent measurement of $D^0\\to\\rho^0\\gamma$ improved standard\nmodel (SM) predictions for branching ratios and CP asymmetries of radiative\ncharm decay are given. Weak annihilation induced decays are probes of\nnon-perturbative QCD approaches. Rare decays probe the SM and physics beyond\nthe SM, e.g. leptoquark and supersymmetric models. Opportunities with\n$\\Lambda_c\\to p\\gamma$ for future polarization measurements are presented.\n", "  We consider small perturbations of a dynamical system on the one-dimensional\ntorus. We derive sharp estimates for the pre-factor of the stationary state, we\nexamine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation for the pre-factor, we compute the capacities between disjoint sets,\nand we prove the metastable behavior of the process among the deepest wells\nfollowing the martingale approach. We also present a bound for the probability\nthat a Markov process hits a set before some fixed time in terms of the\ncapacity of an enlarged process.\n", "  This paper investigates the relative scintillation level associated with cusp\ndynamics (including precipitation, flow shears, etc.) with and without the\nformation of polar cap patches around the cusp inflow region by the EISCAT\nSvalbard radar (ESR) and two GPS scintillation receivers. A series of polar cap\npatches were observed by the ESR between 8:40 and 10:20 UT on December 3, 2011.\nThe polar cap patches combined with the auroral dynamics were associated with a\nsignificantly higher GPS phase scintillation level (up to 0.6 rad) than those\nobserved for the other two alternatives, i.e., cusp dynamics without polar cap\npatches, and polar cap patches without cusp aurora. The cusp auroral dynamics\nwithout plasma patches were indeed related to GPS phase scintillations at a\nmoderate level (up to 0.3 rad). The polar cap patches away from the active cusp\nwere associated with sporadic and moderate GPS phase scintillations (up to 0.2\nrad). The main conclusion is that the worst global navigation satellite system\nspace weather events on the dayside occur when polar cap patches enter the\npolar cap and are subject to particle precipitation and flow shears, which is\nanalogous to the nightside when polar cap patches exit the polar cap and enter\nthe auroral oval.\n", "  The presence of very few statistical studies on auroral omega bands motivated\nus to test-use a semi-automatic method for identifying large-scale undulations\nof the diffuse aurora boundary and to investigate their occurrence. Five\nidentical all-sky cameras with overlapping fields of view provided data for 438\nauroral omega-like structures over Fennoscandian Lapland from 1996 to 2007. The\nresults from this set of omega band events agree remarkably well with previous\nobservations of omega band occurrence in magnetic local time (MLT), lifetime,\nlocation between the region 1 and 2 field-aligned currents, as well as current\ndensity estimates. The average peak emission height of omega forms corresponds\nto the estimated precipitation energies of a few keV, which experienced no\nsignificant change during the events. Analysis of both local and global\nmagnetic indices demonstrates that omega bands are observed during substorm\nexpansion and recovery phases that are more intense than average substorm\nexpansion and recovery phases in the same region. The omega occurrence with\nrespect to the substorm expansion and recovery phases is in a very good\nagreement with an earlier observed distribution of fast earthward flows in the\nplasma sheet during expansion and recovery phases. These findings support the\ntheory that omegas are produced by fast earthward flows and auroral streamers,\ndespite the rarity of good conjugate observations.\n", "  The information of quantum pathways can be extracted in the framework of the\nHamiltonian-encoding and Observable-decoding method. For closed quantum\nsystems, only off-diagonal elements of the Hamiltonian in the Hilbert space is\nrequired to be encoded to obtain the desired transitions. For open quantum\nsystems, environment-related terms will appear in the diagonal elements of the\nHamiltonian in the Liouville space. Therefore, diagonal encodings have to be\nperformed to differentiate different pathways, which will lead to self-to-self\ntransitions and inconsistency of pathway amplitudes with Dyson expansion. In\nthis work, a well-designed transformation is proposed to avoid the\ncounter-intuitive transitions and the inconsistency, with or without control\nfields. A three-level open quantum system is employed for illustration, and\nnumerical simulations show that the method are consistent with Dyson expansion.\n", "  Specific features of the magnetic properties and magnetic dynamics of\nisolated phase separation domains in GdMn2O5 and Gd0.8Ce0.2Mn2O5 have been\ninvestigated. These domains represent 1D superlattices consisting of dielectric\nand conducting layers with the ferromagnetic orientation of their spins. A set\nof ferromagnetic resonances of separate superlattice layers has been studied.\nThe properties of the 1D superlattices in GdMn2O5 and Gd0.8Ce0.2Mn2O5 are\ncompared with the properties of the previously investigated RMn2O5 (R = Eu, Tb,\nEr, and Bi) series. The similarity of the properties for all the RMn2O5\ncompounds with different R ion types is established. Based on the concepts of\nthe magnetic dynamics of ferromagnetic multilayers and properties of\nsemiconductor superlattices, a 1D model of the superlattices in RMn2O5 is\nbuilt.\n", "  Using a nondegenerate four-wave mixing process based on a double-$\\Lambda$\nscheme in hot cesium vapor, we generate quantum correlated twin beams with a\nmaximum intensity-difference squeezing of 6.5 dB. The substantially improved\nsqueezing can be mainly attributed to very good frequency and phase-difference\nstability between the pump and probe beams in our experiment.\nIntensity-difference squeezing can be observed within a wide experimental\nparameter range, which guarantees its robust generation. Since this scheme\nproduces multi-spatial-mode twin beams at the Cs $D_{1}$ line, it is of\ninterest for experiments involving quantum imaging and coherent interfaces\nbetween atomic and solid-state systems.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of Z CVn, an RR Lyrae star that shows\nlong-term cyclic variations of its pulsation period. A possible explanation\nsuggested from the shape of the O-C diagram is the light travel-time effect,\nwhich we thoroughly examine. We used original photometric and spectroscopic\nmeasurements and investigated the period evolution using available maximum\ntimes spanning more than one century. If the binary hypothesis is valid, Z CVn\norbits around a black hole with minimal mass of $56.5$ $\\mathfrak{M}_{\\odot}$\non a very wide ($P_{\\rm orbit}=78.3$ years) and eccentric orbit ($e=0.63$). We\ndiscuss the probability of a formation of a black hole-RR Lyrae pair and,\nalthough we found it possible, there is no observational evidence of the black\nhole in the direction to Z CVn. However, the main objection against the binary\nhypothesis is the comparison of the systemic radial velocity curve model and\nspectroscopic observations that clearly show that Z CVn cannot be bound in such\na binary. Therefore, the variations of pulsation period are likely intrinsic to\nthe star. This finding represents a discovery/confirmation of a new type of\ncyclic period changes in RR Lyrae stars. By the analysis of our photometric\ndata, we found that the Blazhko modulation with period of 22.931 d is strongly\ndominant in amplitude. The strength of the phase modulation varies and is\ncurrently almost undetectable. We also estimated photometric physical\nparameters of Z CVn and investigated their variations during the Blazhko cycle\nusing the Inverse Baade-Wesselink method.\n", "  The magnetoresistance (MR) for relativistic electrons, i.e., the Dirac\nelectrons in solids, is investigated on the basis of the Boltzmann's theory.\nThe new formula of MR so obtaiend includes a relativistic correction, which has\nnot appeared in the conventional Boltzmann's theories. Our formula is\nquantitatively consistent with that obtained by the Kubo theory except for the\nquantum oscillations. While a field dependence of MR is unclear in the formula\nby Kubo theory, a clear field dependence is obtained in our formula, which is\nuseful for the analysis of experimental results. The effects of the\nrelativistic correction on the MR for the one-band and two-band model are\ndiscussed. By taking into account the field dependence of carrier density in\nsemimetals, the linear field dependence of MR is explained by our formula based\non the Boltzmann's theory\n", "  Heat production rates for the geologically important nuclides ${}^{26}$Al,\n${}^{40}$K, ${}^{60}$Fe, ${}^{232}$Th, ${}^{235}$U, and ${}^{238}$U are\ncalculated on the basis of recent data on atomic and nuclear properties. The\nrevised data differ by several per cent from some older values, but indicate\nthat more recent analyses converge toward values with an accuracy sufficient\nfor all common geoscience applications, although some possibilities for\nimprovement still remain, especially in the case of ${}^{40}$K and with regard\nto the determination of half-lives. A Python script is provided for calculating\nheat production (https://github.com/trg818/radheat).\n", "  In this thesis, we studied the Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) in two\nperspectives. Firstly, by using real scalar and abelian gauge fields, we built\nthe Weyl-invariant extension of TMG which unifies cosmological TMG and\nTopologically Massive Electrodynamics (TME) with a Proca mass term. Here, we\nhave demonstrated that the presence of (Anti)-de Sitter spaces as the\nbackground solution, spontaneously breaks the local Weyl symmetry, whereas the\nradiative corrections at two-loop level breaks the symmetry in flat vacuum. The\nbreaking of Weyl symmetry fixes all the dimensionful parameters and provides\nmasses to spin-2 and spin-1 particles as in the Higgs mechanism. Secondly, we\ncalculated the tree-level scattering amplitude in the cosmological TMG plus the\nFierz-Pauli mass term in (Anti)-de Sitter spaces and accordingly found the\nrelevant weak field potential energies between two covariantly conserved\nlocalized point-like spinning sources. We have shown that in addition to\nspin-spin and mass-mass interactions, there also occurs a mass-spin interaction\nwhich is generated by the gravitational Chern-Simons term that changes the\ninitial spin of particles converting them to gravitational anyons. In addition\nto these works concerning TMG, we have also discussed the issue of local\ncausality in $2+1$ dimensional gravity theories and shown that Einstein's\ngravity, TMG and the new massive gravity are causal as long as the sign of the\nNewton's constant is set to negative. We study the causality discussion with\nthe Shapiro time delay method.\n", "  Temporal modes (TM) are a new basis for storage and retrieval of quantum\ninformation in states of light. The full TM manipulation toolkit requires a\npractical quantum pulse gate (QPG), which is a device that unitarily maps any\ngiven TM component of the optical input field onto a different, easily\nseparable subspace or degree of freedom. An ideal QPG must \"separate\" the\nselected TM component with unit efficiency, whilst avoiding crosstalk from\northogonal TMs. All attempts at implementing QPGs in pulsed-pump traveling-wave\nsystems have been unable to satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This is due\nto a known selectivity limit in processes that rely on spatio-temporally local,\nnonlinear interactions between pulsed modes traveling at independent group\nvelocities. This limit is a consequence of time ordering in the quantum\ndynamical evolution, which is predicted to be overcome by coherently cascading\nmultiple stages of low-efficiency, but highly TM-discriminatory QPGs.\nMulti-stage interferometric quantum frequency conversion in nonlinear\nwaveguides was first proposed for precisely this purpose. TM-nonselective\ncascaded frequency conversion, also called optical Ramsey interferometry, has\nrecently been demonstrated with continuous-wave (CW) fields. Here, we present\nthe first experimental demonstration of TM-selective optical Ramsey\ninterferometry and show a significant enhancement in TM selectivity over\nsingle-stage schemes.\n", "  We point out at the possible relationship between the two many-body\nphenomena: Friedel oscillations and Mahan exciton/Fermi edge singularity in a\nrecombination process of a localized valence band hole with a degenerate\nelectron system. It is qualitatively described that the oscillating electron\ndensity around the screened potential of a neutral acceptor can modify the\nwavefunction of the valence band hole and thus promote its recombination with\nelectrons near Fermi-surface. The role of a finite hole mass for the net\nbalance of the two hole energies: the kinetic energy and Coulomb attraction to\nthe degenerate electron system, - is discussed and explicitly shown to be\ncrucial for the occurrence of Mahan enhancement phenomena.\n", "  We have studied the effective slip length of confined fluid with\nnano-structured fluid-solid interfaces. A formula bridging the effective slip\nlength and nano structures of the interfaces has been obtained analytically.\nFor the application of the formula, a confined fluid with wavy fluid-solid\ninterfaces has been studied as an example. In the study, the criteria of the\nformula have been detailed, and verified by the finite element method.\n", "  The Liquids Reflectometer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory provides neutron\nreflectivity capability for an average of about 30 experiments each year. In\nrecent years, there has been a large effort to streamline the data processing\nand analysis for the instrument. While much of the data reduction can be\nautomated, data analysis remains something that needs to be done by scientists.\nFor this purpose, we present a reflectivity fitting web interface that captures\nthe process of setting up and executing fits while reducing the need for\ninstalling software or writing Python scripts.\n", "  We proof the consistency of the different approaches for deriving the\nblack-hole radiation for the spherically symmetric case inside the theory of\nmassive gravity. By comparing the results obtained by using the Bogoliubov\ntransformations with those obtained by using the path-integral formulation, we\nfind that in both cases the presence of the extra-degrees of freedom create the\neffect of extra-particles creation due to the distortions on the notions of\ntime defined by the different observers at large scales. This however does not\nmean extra-particle creation at the horizon level.\n", "  The longstanding notion of stripe incommensurability being proportional to\ndoping, \\delta(x) ~ x, in lanthanum transition-metal oxides, La_{2-x}Sr_xTmO_4\n(Tm = Cu, Ni, Co), is partly borne out by experiment but also plagued with\nexceptions. Future neutron-scattering experiments on cobaltates could provide a\nclear distinction whether a linear or square-root dependence, \\delta(x) ~\nsqrt(x - x_0), is valid.\n", "  We report $^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the Mott\ninsulator with strong spin-orbit interaction Ba$_{2}$NaOsO$_{6}$ as a function\nof temperature in different magnetic fields ranging from 7 T to 29 T. The\nmeasurements, intended to concurrently probe spin and orbital/lattice degrees\nof freedom, are an extension of our work at lower fields reported in Nat.\nCommun., v 8, 14407 (2017). We have identified clear quantitative NMR\nsignatures that display the appearance of a canted ferromagnetic phase, which\nis preceded by local point symmetry breaking. We have compiled the field\ntemperature phase diagram extending up to 29 T. We find that the broken local\npoint symmetry phase extends over a wider temperature range as magnetic field\nincreases.\n", "  The Cosmic Neutrino Background is a prediction of the standard cosmological\nmodel, but it has been never observed directly. In the experiments with the aim\nof detecting relic CNB neutrinos, currently under development, the expected\nevent rate depends on the local density of relic neutrinos. Since massive\nneutrinos can be attracted by the gravitational potential of our galaxy and\ncluster around it, a local overdensity of cosmic neutrinos should exist.\nConsidering the minimal masses guaranteed by neutrino oscillations, we review\nthe computation of the local density of relic neutrinos and we present\nrealistic prospects for a PTOLEMY-like experiment.\n", "  Spicules have been proposed as significant contributors to the mass and\nenergy balance of the corona. While previous observations have provided a\nglimpse of short-lived transient brightenings in the corona that are associated\nwith spicules, these observations have been contested and are the subject of a\nvigorous debate both on the modeling and the observational side. Therefore, it\nremains unclear whether plasma is heated to coronal temperatures in association\nwith spicules. We use high-resolution observations of the chromosphere and\ntransition region with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and of\nthe corona with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) to show evidence of the formation of coronal\nstructures associated with spicular mass ejections and heating of plasma to\ntransition region and coronal temperatures. Our observations suggest that a\nsignificant fraction of the highly dynamic loop fan environment associated with\nplage regions may be the result of the formation of such new coronal strands, a\nprocess that previously had been interpreted as the propagation of transient\npropagating coronal disturbances (PCD)s. Our observations are supported by 2.5D\nradiative MHD simulations that show heating to coronal temperatures in\nassociation with spicules. Our results suggest that heating and strong flows\nplay an important role in maintaining the substructure of loop fans, in\naddition to the waves that permeate this low coronal environment.\n", "  First and second order non-equilibrium thermodynamics are studied in the\ncontext of particle creation mechanism for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW model\nand a general formulation of the emergent scenario is investigated. Finally,\nthe stability of the non-equilibrium thermodynamics is examined.\n", "  Galaxy clusters are the most massive constituents of the large-scale\nstructure of the Universe. While the hot thermal gas that pervades galaxy\nclusters is relatively well understood through observations with X-ray\nsatellites, our understanding of the non-thermal part of the intra-cluster\nmedium remains incomplete. With LOFAR and GMRT observations, we have identified\na phenomenon that can be unveiled only at extremely low radio-frequencies and\noffers new insights into the non-thermal component. We propose that the\ninterplay between radio-emitting plasma and the perturbed intra-cluster medium\ncan gently re-energise relativistic particles initially injected by active\ngalactic nuclei. Sources powered through this mechanism can maintain electrons\nat higher energies than radiative ageing would allow. If this mechanism is\ncommon for aged plasma, a population of mildly relativistic electrons can be\naccumulated inside galaxy clusters providing the seed population for\nmerger-induced re-acceleration mechanisms on larger scales such as turbulence\nand shock waves.\n", "  We address the stability and dynamics of eigenmodes in linearly-shaped\nstrings (dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers) built of droplets of a\nbinary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The binary BEC is composed of atoms in\ntwo pseudo-spin states with attractive interactions, dressed by properly\narranged laser fields, which induce the (pseudo-) spin-orbit (SO) coupling. We\ndemonstrate that the SO-coupling terms help to create eigenmodes of particular\ntypes in the strings. Dimer, trimer, and pentamer eigenmodes of the linear\nsystem, which correspond to the zero eigenvalue (EV, alias chemical potential)\nextend into the nonlinear ones, keeping an exact analytical form, while\ntetramers do not admit such a continuation, because the respective spectrum\ndoes not contain a zero EV. Stability areas of these modes shrink with the\nincreasing nonlinearity. Besides these modes, other types of nonlinear states,\nwhich are produced by the continuation of their linear counterparts\ncorresponding to some nonzero EVs, are found in a numerical form (including\nones for the tetramer system). They are stable in nearly entire existence\nregions in trimer and pentamer systems, but only in a very small area for the\ntetramers. Similar results are also obtained, but not displayed in detail, for\nhexa- and septamers.\n", "  Spectral observations of the solar transition region (TR) and corona show\nbroadening of spectral lines beyond what is expected from thermal and\ninstrumental broadening. The remaining non-thermal broadening is significant\n(5-30 km/s) and correlated with the intensity. Here we study spectra of the TR\nSi IV 1403 Angstrom line obtained at high resolution with the Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph (IRIS). We find that the large improvement in spatial\nresolution (0.33 arcsec) of IRIS compared to previous spectrographs (2 arcsec)\ndoes not resolve the non-thermal line broadening which in most regions remains\nat pre-IRIS levels of about 20 km/s. This invariance to spatial resolution\nindicates that the processes behind the broadening occur along the\nline-of-sight (LOS) and/or on spatial scales (perpendicular to the LOS) smaller\nthan 250 km. Both effects appear to play a role. Comparison with IRIS\nchromospheric observations shows that, in regions where the LOS is more\nparallel to the field, magneto-acoustic shocks driven from below impact the TR\nand can lead to significant non-thermal line broadening. This scenario is\nsupported by MHD simulations. While these do not show enough non-thermal line\nbroadening, they do reproduce the long-known puzzling correlation between\nnon-thermal line broadening and intensity. This correlation is caused by the\nshocks, but only if non-equilibrium ionization is taken into account. In\nregions where the LOS is more perpendicular to the field, the prevalence of\nsmall-scale twist is likely to play a significant role in explaining the\ninvariance and correlation with intensity.\n", "  We present our results on soft gluon resummation in the invariant mass\nthreshold applied to the associated production of a top quark pair with a W\nboson at the LHC in the Mellin space formalism.\n", "  Peridynamics (PD) represents a new approach for modelling fracture mechanics,\nwhere a continuum domain is modelled through particles connected via physical\nbonds. This formulation allows us to model crack initiation, propagation,\nbranching and coalescence without special assumptions. Up to date, anisotropic\nmaterials were modelled in the PD framework as different isotropic materials\n(for instance, fibre and matrix of a composite laminate), where the stiffness\nof the bond depends on its orientation. A non-ordinary state-based formulation\nwill enable the modelling of generally anisotropic materials, where the\nmaterial properties are directly embedded in the formulation. Other material\nmodels include rocks, concrete and biomaterials such as bones. In this paper,\nwe implemented this model and validated it for anisotropic composite materials.\nA composite damage criterion has been employed to model the crack propagation\nbehaviour. Several numerical examples have been used to validate the approach,\nand compared to other benchmark solution from the finite element method (FEM)\nand experimental results when available.\n", "  The principle goal of computational mechanics is to define pattern and\nstructure so that the organization of complex systems can be detected and\nquantified. Computational mechanics developed from efforts in the 1970s and\nearly 1980s to identify strange attractors as the mechanism driving weak fluid\nturbulence via the method of reconstructing attractor geometry from measurement\ntime series and in the mid-1980s to estimate equations of motion directly from\ncomplex time series. In providing a mathematical and operational definition of\nstructure it addressed weaknesses of these early approaches to discovering\npatterns in natural systems.\n  Since then, computational mechanics has led to a range of results from\ntheoretical physics and nonlinear mathematics to diverse applications---from\nclosed-form analysis of Markov and non-Markov stochastic processes that are\nergodic or nonergodic and their measures of information and intrinsic\ncomputation to complex materials and deterministic chaos and intelligence in\nMaxwellian demons to quantum compression of classical processes and the\nevolution of computation and language.\n  This brief review clarifies several misunderstandings and addresses concerns\nrecently raised regarding early works in the field (1980s). We show that\nmisguided evaluations of the contributions of computational mechanics are\ngroundless and stem from a lack of familiarity with its basic goals and from a\nfailure to consider its historical context. For all practical purposes, its\nmodern methods and results largely supersede the early works. This not only\nrenders recent criticism moot and shows the solid ground on which computational\nmechanics stands but, most importantly, shows the significant progress achieved\nover three decades and points to the many intriguing and outstanding challenges\nin understanding the computational nature of complex dynamic systems.\n", "  Using data from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)\nspacecraft in the 1-8 \\AA\\ wavelength range for Solar Cycles 23, 24, and part\nof Cycles 21 and 22, we compare mean temporal parameters (rising, decay times,\nduration) and the proportion of impulsive short-duration events (SDE) and\ngradual long-duration events (LDE) among C- and $\\geq$M1.0-class flares. It is\nfound that the fraction of the SDE $\\geq$M1.0-class flares (including spikes)\nin Cycle 24 exceeds that in Cycle 23 in all three temporal parameters at the\nmaximum phase and in the decay time during the ascending cycle phase. However,\nCycles 23 and 24 barely differ in the fraction of the SDE C-class flares. The\ntemporal parameters of SDEs, their fraction, and consequently the relationship\nbetween the SDE and LDE flares do not remain constant, but they reveal regular\nchanges within individual cycles and during the transition from one cycle to\nanother. In all phases of all four cycles, these changes have the character of\npronounced, large-amplitude \"quasi-biennial\" oscillations (QBOs). In different\ncycles and at the separate phases of individual cycles, such QBOs are\nsuperimposed on various systematic trends displayed by the analyzed temporal\nflare parameters. In Cycle 24, the fraction of the SDE $\\geq$M1.0-class flares\nfrom the N- and S-hemispheres displays the most pronounced synchronous QBOs.\nThe QBO amplitude and general variability of the intense $\\geq$M1.0-class\nflares almost always markedly exceeds those of the moderate C-class flares. The\nordered quantitative and qualitative variations of the flare type revealed in\nthe course of the solar cycles are discussed within the framework of the\nconcept that the SDE flares are associated mainly with small sunspots\n(including those in developed active regions) and that small and large sunspots\nbehave differently during cycles and form two distinct populations.\n"]}
