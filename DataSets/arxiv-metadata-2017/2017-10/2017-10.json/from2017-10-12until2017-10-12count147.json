Masses, moments, energies, spins, etc. are the\nparameters of the probability distribution of such events. The terms and\nequations of quark-gluon theories turn out theoretically probabilistic terms\nand theorems. Confinement and asymptotic freedom are explained by behaviour of\nsuch probabolities. And here we have the probabilistic foundations of the\ntheory of gravitation. In these article the Dark Matter and Dark Energy\nphenomenoms are explained by these results. Knowledge of the elements of linear\nalgebra and differential calculus is sufficient to understand the content of\nthis article\n", "  We study the Zariski topology of the ind-groups of polynomial and free\nassociative algebras $\\Aut(K[x_1,...,x_n])$ (which is equivalent to the\nautomorphism group of the affine space $\\Aut(K^n))$) and $\\Aut(K< x_1,...,\nx_n>$ via $\\Ind$-schemes, toric varieties, approximations and singularities.\n  We obtain some nice properties of $\\Aut(\\Aut(A))$, where $A$ is polynomial or\nfree associative algebra over a field $K$. We prove that all $\\Ind$-scheme\nautomorphisms of $\\Aut(K[x_1,...,x_n])$ are inner for $n\\ge 3$, and all\n$\\Ind$-scheme automorphisms of $\\Aut(K< x_1,..., x_n>)$ are semi-inner. We also\nestablish that any effective action of torus $T^n$ on $\\Aut(K< x_1,..., x_n>)$\nis linearizable provided $K$ is infinity. That is, it is conjugated to a\nstandard one.\n  As an application, we prove that $\\Aut(K[x_1,...,x_n])$ cannot be embedded\ninto $\\Aut(K< x_1,...,x_n>)$ induced by the natural abelianization. In other\nwords, the {\\it Automorphism Group Lifting Problem} has a negative solution.\n  We explore the close connection between the above results and the Jacobian\nconjecture, and Kontsevich-Belov conjecture, and formulate the Jacobian\nconjecture for fields of any characteristic.\n", "  The potential role of magnetic fields and cosmic ray propagation for feedback\nprocesses in the early Universe can be probed by studies of local starburst\ncounterparts with an equivalent star-formation rate. Archival data from the\nWSRT was reduced and a new calibration technique introduced to reach the high\ndynamic ranges needed for the complex source morphology of M82. This data was\ncombined with archival VLA data, yielding total power maps at 3cm, 6cm, 22cm\nand 92cm. The data shows a confinement of the emission at wavelengths of 3/6cm\nto the core region and a largely extended halo reaching up to 4kpc away from\nthe galaxy midplane at wavelengths of 22/92cm up to a sensitivity limit of\n90muJy and 1.8mJy respectively. The results are used to calculate the magnetic\nfield strength in the core region to 98muG and to 24muG in the halo regions.\nFrom the observation of free-free losses the filling factor of the ionised\nmedium could be estimated to 2%. We find that the radio emission from the core\nregion is dominated by very dense HII-regions and supernova remnants, while the\nsurrounding medium is filled with hot X-ray and neutral gas. Cosmic rays\nradiating at frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz are suffering from high\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton losses in the core region and are not able to\nreach the halo. Even the cosmic rays radiating at longer wavelengths are only\nable to build up the observed kpc sized halo, when several starbursting periods\nare assumed where the photon field density varies by an order of magnitude.\nThese findings together with the strong correlation between Halpha, PAH+, and\nour radio continuum data suggests a magnetic field which is frozen into the\nionised medium and driven out of the galaxy kinematically.\n", "  In this paper we study the formation of bound states in the continuum in a\nquantum dot molecule coupled to leads. Based in the combination of bound states\nin the continuum and Fano effect, we propose a new design of a spin-dependent\npolarizer. By lifting the spin degeneracy of the carriers in the quantum dots\nby means of a magnetic field the system can be used as a spin-polarized device.\nA detailed analysis of the spin-dependent conductance and spin polarization as\na function of the applied magnetic field and gate voltages is carried out.\n", "  Crepant resolutions of three-dimensional toric Gorenstein singularities are\nderived equivalent to noncommutative algebras arising from consistent dimer\nmodels. By choosing a special stability parameter and hence a distinguished\ncrepant resolution $Y$, this derived equivalence generalises the Fourier-Mukai\ntransform relating the $G$-Hilbert scheme and the skew group algebra\n$\\CC[x,y,z]\\ast G$ for a finite abelian subgroup of $\\SL(3,\\CC)$. We show that\nthis equivalence sends the vertex simples to pure sheaves, except for the zero\nvertex which is mapped to the dualising complex of the compact exceptional\nlocus. This generalises results of Cautis-Logvinenko and Cautis-Craw-Logvinenko\nto the dimer setting, though our approach is different in each case. We also\ndescribe some of these pure sheaves explicitly and compute the support of the\nremainder, providing a dimer model analogue of results from Logvinenko.\n", "  In this work we present a detailed Raman scattering investigation of zinc\noxide and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films characterized by a variety of\nnanoscale structure and morphology and synthesized by pulsed laser deposition\n(PLD) under different oxygen pressure conditions. The comparison of Raman data\nfor pure ZnO and AZO films with similar morphology at the nano/mesoscale allows\nto investigate the relation between Raman features (peak or band positions,\nwidth, relative intensity) and material properties such as local structural\norder, stoichiometry and doping. Moreover Raman measurements with three\ndifferent excitation lines (532, 457 and 325 nm) point out a strong correlation\nbetween vibrational and electronic properties. This observation confirms the\nrelevance of a multi-wavelength Raman investigation to obtain a complete\nstructural characterization of advanced doped oxide materials.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of the one-dimensional random field Ising\nmodel (RFIM) with long-range interactions ($\\propto r^{-(d+\\sigma)}$) by the\nnonperturbative functional renormalization group. We find two distinct regimes\nof critical behavior as a function of $\\sigma$, separated by a critical value\n$\\sigma_c$. What distinguishes these two regimes is the presence or not of a\ncusp-like nonanalyticity in the functional dependence of the renormalized\ncumulants of the random field at the fixed point. This change of behavior can\nbe associated to the characteristics of the large-scale avalanches present in\nthe system at zero temperature. We propose ways to check these predictions\nthrough lattice simulations. We also discuss the difference with the RFIM on\nthe Dyson hierarchical lattice.\n", "  We consider inverse obstacle and transmission scattering problems where the\nsource of the incident waves is located on a smooth closed surface that is a\nboundary of a domain located outside of the obstacle/inhomogeneity of the\nmedia. The domain can be arbitrarily small but fixed.The scattered waves are\nmeasured on the same surface. An effective procedure is suggested for recovery\nof interior eigenvalues by these data.\n", "  The random-field Ising model shows extreme critical slowdown that has been\ndescribed by activated dynamic scaling: the characteristic time for the\nrelaxation to equilibrium diverges exponentially with the correlation length,\n$\\ln \\tau\\sim \\xi^\\psi/T$ , with $\\psi$ an \\textit{a priori} unknown barrier\nexponent. Through a nonperturbative functional renormalization group, we show\nthat for spatial dimensions $d$ less than a critical value $d_{DR} \\simeq 5.1$,\nalso associated with dimensional-reduction breakdown, $\\psi=\\theta$ with\n$\\theta$ the temperature exponent near the zero-temperature fixed point that\ncontrols the critical behavior. For $d>d_{DR}$ on the other hand,\n$\\psi=\\theta-2\\lambda$ where $\\theta=2$ and $\\lambda>0$ a new exponent. At the\nupper critical dimension $d=6$, $\\lambda=1$ so that $\\psi=0$, and activated\nscaling gives way to conventional scaling. We give a physical interpretation of\nthe results in terms of collective events in real space, avalanches and\ndroplets. We also propose a way to check the two regimes by computer\nsimulations of long-range 1-$d$ systems.\n", "  The problem of diffusion in a porous medium with a spatially varying porosity\nis considered. The particular microstructure analyzed comprises a collection of\nimpenetrable spheres, though the methods developed are general. Two different\napproaches for calculating the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of\nthe microstructure are presented. The first is a deterministic approach based\non the method of multiple scales; the second is a stochastic approach for small\nvolume fraction of spheres based on matched asymptotic expansions. We compare\nthe two approaches, and we show good agreement between them in a number of\nexample configurations.\n", "  Self-assembly of polypeptides into fibrillar structures can be initiated by\nplanar surfaces that interact favorably with certain residues. Using a coarse\ngrained model, we systematically studied the folding and adsorption behavior of\na $\\beta$-roll forming polypeptide. We find that there are two different\nfolding pathways depending on the temperature: (i) at low temperature, the\npolypeptide folds in solution into a $\\beta$-roll before adsorbing onto the\nattractive surface, (ii) at higher temperature, the polypeptide first adsorbs\nin a disordered state, and folds while on the surface. The folding temperature\nincreases with increasing attraction, as the folded $\\beta$-roll is stabilized\nby the surface. Surprisingly, further increasing the attraction lowers the\nfolding temperature again, as strong attraction also stabilizes the adsorbed\ndisordered state, which competes with folding of the polypeptide. Our results\nsuggest that to enhance the folding, one should use a weakly attractive\nsurface. They also explain the recent experimental observation of the\nnon-monotonic effect of charge on the fibril formation on an oppositely charged\nsurface [C. Charbonneau, et al., ACS Nano, 8, 2328 (2014)].\n", "  We consider inverse potential scattering problems where the source of the\nincident waves is located on a smooth closed surface outside of the\ninhomogeneity of the media. The scattered waves are measured on the same\nsurface at a fixed value of the energy. We show that this data determines the\nbounded potential uniquely.\n", "  One of the most fundamental properties of an interacting electron system is\nits frequency- and wave-vector-dependent density response function, $\\chi({\\bf\nq},\\omega)$. The imaginary part, $\\chi''({\\bf q},\\omega)$, defines the\nfundamental bosonic charge excitations of the system, exhibiting peaks wherever\ncollective modes are present. $\\chi$ quantifies the electronic compressibility\nof a material, its response to external fields, its ability to screen charge,\nand its tendency to form charge density waves. Unfortunately, there has never\nbeen a fully momentum-resolved means to measure $\\chi({\\bf q},\\omega)$ at the\nmeV energy scale relevant to modern elecronic materials. Here, we demonstrate a\nway to measure $\\chi$ with quantitative momentum resolution by applying\nalignment techniques from x-ray and neutron scattering to surface\nhigh-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HR-EELS). This approach,\nwhich we refer to here as \"M-EELS,\" allows direct measurement of $\\chi''({\\bf\nq},\\omega)$ with meV resolution while controlling the momentum with an accuracy\nbetter than a percent of a typical Brillouin zone. We apply this technique to\nfinite-q excitations in the optimally-doped high temperature superconductor,\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi2212), which exhibits several phonons\npotentially relevant to dispersion anomalies observed in ARPES and STM\nexperiments. Our study defines a path to studying the long-sought collective\ncharge modes in quantum materials at the meV scale and with full momentum\ncontrol.\n", "  We have performed an ab initio investigation of the energetic stability, and\nthe electronic properties of transition metals (TMs = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ru)\nadsorbed on graphene upon the presence of grain boundaries (GBs). Our results\nreveal an energetic preference for the TMs lying along the GB sites (TM/GB).\nSuch an energetic preference has been strengthened by increasing the\nconcentration of the TM adatoms; giving rise to TM nanolines on graphene ruled\nby GBs. Further diffusion barrier calculations for Fe adatoms support the\nformation of those TM nanolines. We find that the energy barriers parallel to\nthe GBs are sligthly lower in comparision with those obtained for the defect\nfree graphene; whereas, perpendicularly to the GBs the Fe adatoms face higher\nenergy barriers. Fe and Co (Mn) nanolines are ferromagnetic (ferrimagnetic), in\ncontrast the magnetic state of Ru nanolines is sensitive to the Ru/GB\nadsorption geometry. The electronic properties of those TM nanolines were\ncharacterized through extensive electronic band structure calculations. The\nformation of metallic nanolines is mediated by a strong hybridization between\nthe TM and the graphene ($\\pi$) orbitals along the GB sites. Due to the net\nmagnetization of the TM nanolines, our band structure results indicate an\nanisotropic (spin-polarized) electronic current for some TM/GB systems.\n", "  Stochastic gravitational waves generated from early universe are placed in\nthe squeezed vacuum state. The quantum effect on the stochastic gravitational\nwaves leads to enhancement of its spectral amplitude in the long wavelength\nregime and oscillatory behaviour at higher frequency side of the spectrum in\nthe accelerating universe. The results of the present study may be found useful\nto test whether the stochastic gravitational waves generated in early universe\nexist in the squeezed vacuum state\n", "  The classical $\\overline \\partial$-method has been generalized recently\n[lnv], [lnv2] to be used in the presence of exceptional points. We apply this\ngeneralization to solve Dirac inverse scattering problem with weak assumptions\non smoothness of potentials. As a consequence, this provides an effective\nmethod of reconstruction of complex-valued one time differentiable\nconductivities in the inverse impedance tomography problem.\n", "  We show that any bipartite quantum state of rank four is distillable, when\nthe partial transpose of the state has at least one negative eigenvalue, i.e.,\nthe state is NPT. For this purpose we prove that if the partial transpose of a\ntwo-qutrit NPT state has two non-positive eigenvalues, then the state is\ndistillable. We further construct a parametrized two-qutrit NPT entangled state\nof rank five which is not 1-distillable, and show that it is not\n$n$-distillable for any given $n$ when the parameter is sufficiently small.\nThis state has the smallest rank among all 1-undistillable NPT states. We\nconjecture that the state is not distillable.\n", "  We investigate the separable states $\\r$ of an arbitrary multipartite quantum\nsystem with Hilbert space $\\cH$ of dimensionin $d$. The length $L(\\r)$ of $\\r$\nis defined as the smallest number of pure product states having $\\r$ as their\nmixture. The length filtration of the set of separable states, $\\cS$, is the\nincreasing chain $\\emptyset\\subset\\cS'_1\\subseteq\\cS'_2\\subseteq\\cdots$, where\n$\\cS'_i=\\{\\r\\in\\cS:L(\\r)\\le i\\}$. We define the maximum length, $L_{\\rm\nmax}=\\max_{\\r\\in\\cS} L(\\r)$, critical length, $L_{\\rm crit}$, and yet another\nspecial length, $L_c$, which was defined by a simple formula in one of our\nprevious papers. The critical length indicates the first term in the length\nfiltrartion whose dimension is equal to $\\dim\\cS$. We show that in general\n$d\\le L_c\\le L_{\\rm crit}\\le L_{\\rm max}\\le d^2$.\n  We conjecture that the equality $L_{\\rm crit}=L_c$ holds for all\nfinite-dimensional multipartite quantum systems. Our main result is that\n$L_{\\rm crit}=L_c$ for the bipartite systems having a single qubit as one of\nthe parties. This is accomplished by computing the rank of the Jacobian matrix\nof a suitable map having $\\cS$ as its range.\n", "  In classical semi-infinite Coulomb fluids, two-point correlation functions\nexhibit a slow inverse-power law decay along a uniformly charged wall. In this\nwork, we concentrate on the corresponding amplitude function which depends on\nthe distances of the two points from the wall. Recently [L. \\v{S}amaj, J. Stat.\nPhys. {\\bf 161}, 227 (2015)], applying a technique of anticommuting variables\nto a 2D system of charged rectilinear wall with \"counter-ions only\", we derived\na relation between the amplitude function and the density profile which holds\nfor any temperature. In this paper, using the M\\\"obius conformal transformation\nof particle coordinates in a disc, a new relation between the amplitude\nfunction and the density profile is found for that model. This enables us to\nprove, at any temperature, the factorization property of the amplitude function\nin point distances from the wall and to express it in terms of the density\nprofile. Presupposing the factorization property of the amplitude function and\nusing specific sum rules for semi-infinite geometries, a relation between the\namplitude function of the charge-charge structure function and the charge\nprofile is derived for many-component Coulomb fluids in any dimension.\n", "  Gauging is a ubiquitous tool in many-body physics. It allows one to construct\nhighly entangled topological phases of matter from relatively simple phases and\nto relate certain characteristics of the two. Here we develop a gauging\nprocedure for general submanifold symmetries of Pauli Hamiltonians, including\nsymmetries of fractal type. We show a relation between the pre- and\npost-gauging models and use this to construct short-range entangled phases with\nfractal-like symmetries, one of which is mapped to the cubic code by the\ngauging.\n", "  We consider a focusing Davey-Stewartson system and construct the solution of\nthe Cauchy problem in the possible presence of exceptional points (and/or\ncurves).\n", "  Quantum walks have been useful for designing quantum algorithms that\noutperform their classical versions for a variety of search problems. Most of\nthe papers, however, consider a search space containing a single marked element\nonly. We show that if the search space contains more than one marked element,\ntheir placement may drastically affect the performance of the search. More\nspecifically, we study search by quantum walks on general graphs and show a\nwide class of configurations of marked vertices, for which search by quantum\nwalk needs $\\Omega(N)$ steps, that is, it has no speed-up over the classical\nexhaustive search. The demonstrated configurations occur for certain placements\nof two or more adjacent marked vertices. The analysis is done for the\ntwo-dimensional grid and hypercube, and then is generalized for any graph.\n", "  Excellent fits of the tunneling density of states in disordered\nsuperconductors can be often achieved making use of the phenomenological Dynes\nformula. However, no consistent derivation of this formula has been available\nso far. The Dynes formula can be interpreted by the simplest causal\nfrequency-dependent gap function $\\Delta(\\omega)$ with a vanishing gap at the\nFermi level. Here we show, within the coherent potential approximation, that\nprecisely such gap function describes superconductors with a Lorentzian\ndistribution of pair-breaking fields and arbitrary potential disorder. We\npredict spectral and thermodynamic properties of such superconductors.\n", "  A systematic search for extremely deformed structures in the N~Z nuclei of\nthe A~40 mass region has been performed for the first time in the framework of\ncovariant density functional theory. At spin zero such structures are located\nat high excitation energies which prevents their experimental observation. The\nrotation acts as a tool to bring these exotic shapes to the yrast line or its\nvicinity so that their observation could become possible with future generation\nof $\\gamma-$tracking (or similar) detectors such as GRETA and AGATA. The major\nphysical observables of such structures (such as transition quadrupole moments\nas well as kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia), the underlying\nsingle-particle structure and the spins at which they become yrast or near\nyrast are defined. The search for the fingerprints of clusterization and\nmolecular structures is performed and the configurations with such features are\ndiscussed. The best candidates for observation of extremely deformed structures\nare identified. For several nuclei in this study (such as $^{36}$Ar), the\naddition of several spin units above currently measured maximum spin of\n$16\\hbar$ will inevitably trigger the transition to hyper- and megadeformed\nnuclear shapes.\n", "  The search for extremely deformed structures in the yrast and near-yrast\nregion of $^{28}$Si has been performed within the cranked relativistic mean\nfield theory up to spin $I=20\\hbar$. The fingerprints of clusterization are\nseen (well pronounced) in the superdeformed (hyperdeformed) configurations.\n", "  We propose a new model of f(R) gravity containing Arctan function in the\nlagrangian. We show here that this model satisfies fifth force constraint\nunlike a similar model in Kruglov 2013. In addition to this, we carry out the\nfixed point analysis as well as comment on the existence of curvature\nsingularity in this model. The cosmological evolution for this f(R) gravity\nmodel is also analyzed in the Freidmann Robertson Walker(FRW) background. To\nunderstand observational significance of the model, cosmological parameters are\nobtained numerically and compared with those of Lambda cold dark matter\n({\\Lambda}CDM) model. We also scrutinize the model with supernova data. We\napply Om diagnostic given by Sahni et al. 2008 to the model. Using this\ndiagnostic, we detect the distinction between cosmic evolution caused by the\nf(R) model and {\\Lambda}CDM. We find best-fit parameter values of the model\nusing Baryon Acoustic Oscillations data.\n", "  Random graph null models have found widespread application in diverse\nresearch communities analyzing network datasets, including social, information,\nand economic networks, as well as food webs, protein-protein interactions, and\nneuronal networks. The most popular family of random graph null models, called\nconfiguration models, are defined as uniform distributions over a space of\ngraphs with a fixed degree sequence. Commonly, properties of an empirical\nnetwork are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a\nconfiguration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties\nare meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the\nparticular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important\ndecisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and\ninvestigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a\nsuite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of\nspecifying the appropriate graph labeling (stub-labeled or vertex-labeled)\nunder which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study\nof random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the\nchoice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but\ncan have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with\nself-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of\nthree vignettes, analyzing network datasets under many different configuration\nmodels and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under\ndifferent models. We argue that in each case, only one of the possible\nconfiguration models is appropriate. While our work focuses on undirected\nstatic networks, it aims to guide the study of directed networks, dynamic\nnetworks, and all other network contexts that are suitably studied through the\nlens of random graph null models.\n", "  An inverse problem for the two-dimensional Schrodinger equation with\n$L^p_{com}$-potential, $p>1$, is considered. Using the\n$\\overline{\\partial}$-method, the potential is recovered from the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann map on the boundary of a domain containing the support of\nthe potential. We do not assume that the potential is small or that the Faddeev\nscattering problem does not have exceptional points. The paper contains a new\nestimate on the Faddeev Green function that immediately implies the absence of\nexceptional points near the origin and infinity when $v\\in L^p_{com}$.\n", "  One of the central goals of quantum optics is to generate large interactions\nbetween single photons. Light interacting with motion in an optomechanical\nsystem can sense minute fluctuations in displacement, and also impart a force\nvia radiation pressure. Taken together, these two effects mean that two photons\ncan \"sense\" each other's presence in an interaction mediated by motion. It is\naccepted that for an optomechanical system to mediate strong interactions\nbetween single photons, the mechanical system must respond before the photon is\nlost ($\\omega_m > \\kappa$), and the radiation pressure force must generate a\ndisplacement large enough to change the optical properties of the system ($g_0\n> \\kappa$). The challenge of achieving this \"vacuum strong coupling\" has\nprevented experiments from demonstrating single-photon interactions. In this\nwork we show that by adding a coherent feedback channel to a slow mechanical\nsystem ($\\omega_m < \\kappa$) that is weakly nonlinear ($g_0 < \\kappa$), two\nspatially separated single photons can be made to effectively interact with\neach other deterministically through the mechanical motion of a resonator. To\nnumerically analyze our system, we must solve Schr\\\"odinger's equation for the\nstate of an optomechanical system coupled to a long waveguide feeback channel.\nWe implement a matrix product state approach to keep track of and evolve the\ncomplete quantum state of the system in an efficient way. We analyze the\nprocess semiclassically and then solve the full quantum dynamics numerically to\nfind a cross-over between the semiclassical and quantum regimes of\noptomechanics. Finally we analyze the experimental prospects for implementing\nthis protocol.\n", "  Fermion-induced quantum critical points (FIQCPs) were recently discovered at\nthe putatively first-order transitions between two-dimensional (2D) Dirac\nsemimetals and the Kekule valence bond solids on the honeycomb lattice by\nsign-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations [Nature Communications 8, 314,\n(2017)]. Here, we investigate possible FIQCP in 3D topological Weyl semimetals\nat a $Z_3$ symmetry-breaking transition that is putatively first-order\naccording to the Landau criterion. We construct a lattice model featuring 3D\ndouble-Weyl fermions (monopole charges $\\pm$2) and we show that $Z_3$\nnodal-nematic transitions occur under finite Hubbard interaction. Furthermore,\nusing renormalization-group analysis, we identify such a transition as a\ngenuine FIQCP where the cubic terms are irrelevant and an enlarged U(1)\nsymmetry emerges at low energy. We further discuss quantum critical behaviors\nand experimental signatures of such FIQCPs in 3D double-Weyl semimetals.\n", "  The transport of sound and heat, in the form of phonons, can be limited by\ndisorder-induced scattering. In electronic and optical settings the\nintroduction of chiral transport, in which carrier propagation exhibits parity\nasymmetry, can remove elastic backscattering and provides robustness against\ndisorder. However, suppression of disorder-induced scattering has never been\ndemonstrated in non-topological phononic systems. Here we experimentally\ndemonstrate a path for achieving robust phonon transport in the presence of\nmaterial disorder, by explicitly inducing chirality through parity-selective\noptomechanical coupling. We show that asymmetric optical pumping of a symmetric\nresonator enables a dramatic chiral cooling of clockwise and counterclockwise\nphonons, while simultaneously suppressing the hidden action of disorder.\nSurprisingly, this passive mechanism is also accompanied by a chiral reduction\nin heat load leading to optical cooling of the mechanics without added damping,\nan effect that has no optical analogue. This technique can potentially improve\nupon the fundamental thermal limits of resonant mechanical sensors, which\ncannot be attained through sideband cooling.\n", "  The phenomenological study of neutral heavy gauge boson ($Z^{\\prime}_{B-L}$)\nof the minimal B-L extension was done on the dimuon production channel of the\nLHC. The study begins with the LEP-II constraints on $Z'$ searches, and the\ndimuon events are simulated at the parton level at the CM energies of 7 TeV and\n8 TeV and studied with an integrated luminosity of 1.21 $fb^{-1}$ and 20.5\n$fb^{-1}$ respectively. Later, the ATLAS detector-specific cuts unique to the\nMuon Pairs are imposed followed by the signal-selection-cuts on the Invariant\nMass of the dimuon which restrict the events that are to be passed for\nSignal-Background Analysis, that are finally compared with the ATLAS data, and\naccounted for no experimental detection of $Z^{\\prime}_{B-L}$ boson. It has\nbeen simulated further at the CM energy of 14 TeV with an integrated luminosity\nof 300 $fb^{-1}$ to predict a possible discovery of this B-L neutral-heavy\ngauge boson with a mass corresponding to 1.5 TeV and a $Z'$ coupling strength\nof 0.2 based on the signal-background analysis.\n", "  We examine the constraints on the trilinear Higgs coupling $\\lambda$ that\noriginate from associated ($Vh$) and vector boson fusion (VBF) Higgs production\nin $pp$ collisions in the context of the Standard Model effective field theory.\nThe 1-loop contributions to $pp \\to V h$ and $pp \\to jj h$ that stem from\ninsertions of the dimension-6 operator $O_6 = - \\lambda \\left (H^\\dagger H\n\\right )^3$ are calculated and combined with the ${\\cal O} (\\lambda)$\ncorrections to the partial decay widths of the Higgs boson. Employing\nnext-to-next-to-leading order QCD predictions, we analyse the sensitivity of\ncurrent and forthcoming measurements of the signal strengths in $Vh$ and VBF\nHiggs production to changes in $\\lambda$. We show that future LHC runs may be\nable to probe modifications of $\\lambda$ with a sensitivity similar to the one\nthat is expected to arise from determinations of double-Higgs production. The\nsensitivity of differential $Vh$ and VBF Higgs distributions to a modified\n$h^3$ coupling is also studied.\n", "  We study the inviscid damping of Couette flow with an exponentially\nstratified density. The optimal decay rates of the velocity field and the\ndensity are obtained for general perturbations with minimal regularity. For\nBoussinesq approximation model, the decay rates we get are consistent with the\nprevious results in the literature. We also study the decay rates for the full\nEuler equations of stratified fluids, which were not studied before. For both\nmodels, the decay rates depend on the Richardson number in a very similar way.\nBesides, we also study the dispersive decay due to the exponential\nstratification when there is no shear.\n", "  This paper presents a case-study assessing and analyzing student engagement\nwith and responses to binary, descriptive, and computational questions testing\nthe concepts underlying resistor networks (series and parallel combinations).\nThe participants of the study were undergraduate students enrolled in a\nuniversity in Pakistan. The majority of students struggled with the descriptive\nquestion, even when successfully answering the binary and computational ones,\nfailed to build an expectation for the answer, and betrayed significant lack of\nconceptual understanding in the process. The data collected was also used to\nanalyze the relative efficacy of the three questions as means of assessing\nconceptual understanding. The three questions were revealed to be uncorrelated\nand unlikely to be testing the same construct. The ability to answer the binary\nor computational question was observed to be divorced from a deeper\nunderstanding of the concepts involved.\n", "  A main distinguishing feature of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics is the\npresence of exceptional points (EPs). They correspond to the coalescence of two\nenergy levels and their respective eigenvectors. Here, we use the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model as a testbed to explore the strong connection\nbetween EPs and the onset of excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs).\nWe show that for finite systems, the exact degeneracies (EPs) obtained with the\nnon-Hermitian LMG Hamiltonian continued into the complex plane are directly\nlinked with the avoided crossings that characterize the ESQPTs for the real\n(physical) LMG Hamiltonian. The values of the complex control parameter\n$\\alpha$ that lead to the EPs approach the real axis as the system size\n$N\\rightarrow \\infty$. This happens for both, the EPs that are close to the\nseparatrix that marks the ESQPT and also for those that are far away, although\nin the latter case, the rate the imaginary part of $\\alpha$ reduces to zero as\n$N$ increases is smaller. With the method of Pad\\'e approximants, we can\nextract the critical value of $\\alpha$.\n", "  Future quantum networks in which superconducting quantum processors are\nconnected via optical links, will require microwave-to-optical photon\nconverters that preserve entanglement. A doubly-resonant electro-optic\nmodulator (EOM) is a promising platform to realize this conversion. Here, we\npresent our progress towards building such a modulator by demonstrating the\noptically-resonant half of the device. We demonstrate high quality factor ring,\ndisk and photonic crystal resonators using a hybrid silicon-on-lithium-niobate\nmaterial system. Optical quality factors up to 730,000 are achieved,\ncorresponding to propagation loss of 0.8 dB/cm. We also use the electro-optic\neffect to modulate the resonance frequency of a photonic crystal cavity,\nachieving a electro-optic modulation coefficient between 1 and 2 pm/V. In\naddition to quantum technology, we expect that our results will be useful both\nin traditional silicon photonics applications and in high-sensitivity\nacousto-optic devices.\n", "  In this work, we develop a coupled layer construction of fracton topological\norders in $d=3$ spatial dimensions. These topological phases have sub-extensive\ntopological ground-state degeneracy and possess excitations whose movement is\nrestricted in interesting ways. Our coupled layer approach is used to construct\nseveral different fracton topological phases, both from stacked layers of\nsimple $d=2$ topological phases and from stacks of $d=3$ fracton topological\nphases. This perspective allows us to shed light on the physics of the X-cube\nmodel recently introduced by Vijay, Haah, and Fu, which we demonstrate can be\nobtained as the strong-coupling limit of a coupled three-dimensional stack of\ntoric codes. We also construct two new models of fracton topological order: a\nsemionic generalization of the X-cube model, and a model obtained by coupling\ntogether four interpenetrating X-cube models, which we dub the \"Four Color Cube\nmodel.\" The couplings considered lead to fracton topological orders via\nmechanisms we dub \"p-string condensation\" and \"p-membrane condensation,\" in\nwhich strings or membranes built from particle excitations are driven to\ncondense. This allows the fusion properties, braiding statistics, and\nground-state degeneracy of the phases we construct to be easily studied in\nterms of more familiar degrees of freedom. Our work raises the possibility of\nstudying fracton topological phases from within the framework of topological\nquantum field theory, which may be useful for obtaining a more complete\nunderstanding of such phases.\n", "  The state of particles injected onto the surface of the Fermi sea depends\nessentially on the temperature. The pure state injected at zero temperature\nbecomes a mixed state if injected at finite temperature. Moreover the electron\nsource injecting a single-particle state at zero temperature may excite a\nmulti-particle state if the Fermi sea is at finite temperature. Here I unveil a\nsymmetry of the scattering amplitude of a source, which is sufficient to\npreserve a single-particle emission regime at finite temperatures if such a\nregime is achieved at zero temperature. I give an example and analyze the\neffect of temperature on time-dependent electrical and heat currents carried by\na single-particle excitation.\n", "  Presented data contains the record of five spreading campaigns that occurred\nin a virtual world platform. Users distributed avatars between each other\nduring the campaigns. The processes varied in time and range and were either\nincentivized or not incentivized. Campaign data is accompanied by events. The\ndata can be used to build a multilayer network to place the campaigns in a\nwider context. To the best of the authors knowledge, the study is the first\npublicly available dataset containing a complete real multilayer social network\ntogether, along with five complete spreading processes in it.\n", "  Thermodynamic potential of a neutral two-dimensional (2D) Cou\\-lomb fluid,\nconfined to a large domain with a smooth boundary, exhibits at any (inverse)\ntemperature $\\beta$ a logarithmic finite-size correction term whose universal\nprefactor depends only on the Euler number of the domain and the conformal\nanomaly number $c=-1$. A minimal free boson conformal field theory, which is\nequivalent to the 2D symmetric two-component plasma of elementary $\\pm e$\ncharges at coupling constant $\\Gamma=\\beta e^2$, was studied in the past. It\nwas shown that creating a non-neutrality by spreading out a charge $Q e$ at\ninfinity modifies the anomaly number to $c(Q,\\Gamma) = - 1 + 3\\Gamma Q^2$.\nHere, we study the effect of non-neutrality on the finite-size expansion of the\nfree energy for another Coulomb fluid, namely the 2D one-component plasma\n(jellium) composed of identical pointlike $e$-charges in a homogeneous\nbackground surface charge density. For the disk geometry of the confining\ndomain we find that the non-neutrality induces the same change of the anomaly\nnumber in the finite-size expansion. We derive this result first at the\nfree-fermion coupling $\\Gamma\\equiv\\beta e^2=2$ and then, by using a mapping of\nthe 2D one-component plasma onto an anticommuting field theory formulated on a\nchain, for an arbitrary coupling constant.\n", "  We examine the dynamics associated with the miscibility-immiscibility\ntransition of trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (TBECs) of dilute\natomic gases in presence of vortices. In particular, we consider TBECs of Rb\nhyperfine states, and Rb-Cs mixture. There is an enhancement of the\nphase-separation when the vortex is present in both condensates. In the case of\na singly charged vortex in only one of the condensates, there is enhancement\nwhen the vortex is present in the species which occupy the edges at\nphase-separation. But, suppression occurs when the vortex is in the species\nwhich occupies the core region. To examine the role of the vortex, we quench\nthe inter-species interactions to propel the TBEC from miscible to immiscible\nphase, and use the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation to probe the\nphenomenon of phase-separation. We also examine the effect of higher charged\nvortex.\n", "  We study the frequency-dependent conductivity of nodal line semimetals\n(NLSMs), focusing on the effects of carrier density and energy dispersion on\nthe nodal line. We find that the low-frequency conductivity has a rich spectral\nstructure which can be understood using scaling rules derived from the geometry\nof their Dupin cyclide Fermi surfaces. We identify different frequency regimes,\nfind scaling rules for the optical conductivity in each, and demonstrate them\nwith numerical calculations of the inter- and intraband contributions to the\noptical conductivity using a low-energy model for a generic NLSM.\n", "  Strongly Coupled Dark Energy plus Warm dark matter (SCDEW) cosmologies are\nbased on the finding of a conformally invariant (CI) attractor solution during\nthe early radiative expansion, requiring then the stationary presence of $\\sim\n1\\, \\%$ of coupled-DM and DE, since inflationary reheating. In these models,\ncoupled-DM fluctuations, even in the early radiative expansion, grow up to\nnon-linearity, as shown in a previous associated paper. Such early non-linear\nstages are modelized here through the evolution of a top-hat density\nenhancement. As expected, its radius $R$ increases up to a maximum and then\nstarts to decrease. Virial balance is reached when the coupled-DM density\ncontrast is just 25-26 and DM density enhancement is $\\cal O$$(10\\, \\%)$ of\ntotal density. Moreover, we find that this is not an equilibrium configuration\nas, afterwards, coupling causes DM particle velocities to increase, so that the\nfluctuation gradually dissolves. We estimate the duration of the whole process,\nfrom horizon crossing to dissolution, and find $z_{horizon}/z_{erasing} \\sim 3\n\\times 10^4$. Therefore, only fluctuations entering the horizon at $z \\lesssim\n10^9$-$10^{10}$ are able to accrete WDM with mass $\\sim 100\\, $eV -as soon as\nit becomes non-relativistic- so avoiding full disruption. Accordingly, SCDEW\ncosmologies, whose WDM has mass $\\sim 100\\, $eV, can preserve primeval\nfluctuations down to stellar mass scale.\n", "  IC 1613 is an isolated dwarf galaxy within the Local Group. Low foreground\nand internal extinction, low metallicity, and low crowding make it an\ninvaluable testbed for the calibration of the local distance ladder. We present\nnew, high-fidelity distance estimates to IC 1613 via its Tip of the Red Giant\nBranch (TRGB) and its RR Lyrae (RRL) variables as part of the Carnegie-Chicago\nHubble Program, which seeks an alternate local route to \\ho using Population II\nstars. We have measured a TRGB magnitude I=20.35+/-0.01 (statistical)+/-0.01\n(systematic) using wide-field observations obtained from the IMACS camera on\nthe Magellan-Baade telescope. We have further constructed optical and\nnear-infrared RRL light curves using archival BI- and new H- band observations\nfrom the ACS/WFC and WFC3/IR instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). In advance of future Gaia data releases, we set provisional values for\nthe TRGB luminosity via the Large Magellanic Cloud and Galactic RRL zero-points\nvia HST parallaxes. We find corresponding true distance moduli\n\\mu(TRGB)=24.30+/-0.03 (statistical)+/-0.05 (systematic) and\n\\mu(RRL)=24.28+/-0.04 (statistical+systematic). We compare our results to a\nbody of recent publications on IC 1613 and find no statistically significant\ndifference between the distances derived from stars of Population I and II.\n", "  Recent LHCb measurements of the $J/\\psi$ meson production in jets is analyzed\nusing fragmentation jet function formalism. It is shown that disagreement with\ntheoretical predictions for distribution over the fraction of $J/\\psi$\ntransverse momentum $z(J/\\psi)$ in the cases of prompt production can be\nexplained if one takes into account evolution of the fragmentation function and\ncontributions from double parton scattering mechanism.\n", "  A system of interacting Brownian particles subject to short-range repulsive\npotentials is considered. A continuum description in the form of a nonlinear\ndiffusion equation is derived systematically in the dilute limit using the\nmethod of matched asymptotic expansions. Numerical simulations are performed to\ncompare the results of the model with those of the commonly used mean-field and\nKirkwood-superposition approximations, as well as with Monte Carlo simulation\nof the stochastic particle system, for various interaction potentials. Our\napproach works best for very repulsive short-range potentials, while the\nmean-field approximation is suitable for long-range interactions. The Kirkwood\nsuperposition approximation provides an accurate description for both short-\nand long-range potentials, but is considerably more computationally intensive.\n", "  The study of dispersive properties of Schr\\\"odinger operators with point\ninteractions is a fundamental tool for understanding the behavior of many body\nquantum systems interacting with very short range potential, whose dynamics can\nbe approximated by non linear Schr\\\"odinger equations with singular\ninteractions. In this work we proved that, in the case of one point interaction\nin $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the perturbed Laplacian satisfies the same $L^p-L^q$\nestimates of the free Laplacian in the smaller regime $q\\in[2,3)$. These\nestimates are implied by a recent result concerning the $L^p$ boundedness of\nthe wave operators for the perturbed Laplacian. Our approach, however, is more\ndirect and relatively simple, and could potentially be useful to prove optimal\nweighted estimates also in the regime $q\\geq 3$.\n", "  Exceptional Field Theory employs an extended spacetime to make supergravity\nfully covariant under the U-duality groups of M-theory. The 12-dimensional EFT\nassociated to the group $SL(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ together with its action is\npresented. Demanding the closure of the algebra of local symmetries leads to a\nconstraint, known as the section condition, that must be imposed on all fields.\nThis constraint has two inequivalent solutions, one giving rise to\n11-dimensional supergravity and the other leading to Type IIB supergravity and\nF-theory. Thus $SL(2)\\times\\mathbb{R}^+$ Exceptional Field Theory contains both\nF-theory and M-theory in a single 12-dimensional formalism.\n", "  Flapping animal flight is often modeled as a combined pitching and heaving\nmotion in order to investigate the unsteady flow structures and resulting\nforces that could augment the animal's lift and propulsive capabilities. This\nwork isolates the heaving motion of flapping flight in order to numerically\ninvestigate the flow physics at a Reynolds number of 40,000, a regime typical\nfor large birds and bats and challenging to simulate due to the added\ncomplexity of laminar to turbulent transition in which boundary layer\nseparation and reattachment are traditionally more difficult to predict.\nPeriodic heaving of a thin flat plate at fixed angles of attacks of 1, 5, 9,\n13, and 18 degrees are simulated using a large-eddy simulation (LES). The\nheaving motion significantly increases the average lift compared with the\nsteady flow, and also surpasses the quasi-steady predictions due to the\nformation of a leading edge vortex (LEV) that persists well into the static\nstall region. The progression of the high-lift mechanisms throughout the\nheaving cycle is presented over the range of angles of attack. Lift enhancement\ncompared with the equivalent steady state flow was found to be up to 17%\ngreater, and up to 24% greater than that predicted by a quasi-steady analysis.\nFor the range of kinematics explored it is found that maximum lift enhancement\noccurs at an angle of attack of 13 degrees, with a maximum lift coefficient of\n2.1, a mean lift coefficient of 1.04.\n", "  The structural polymorphism in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)\nprovides exciting opportunities for developing advanced electronics. For\nexample, MoTe$_2$ crystallizes in the 2H semiconducting phase at ambient\ntemperature and pressure, but transitions into the 1T$^\\prime$ semimetallic\nphase at high temperatures. Alloying MoTe$_2$ with WTe$_2$ reduces the energy\nbarrier between these two phases, while also allowing access to the T$_d$ Weyl\nsemimetal phase. The MoWTe$_2$ alloy system is therefore promising for\ndeveloping phase change memory technology. However, achieving this goal\nnecessitates a detailed understanding of the phase composition in the\nMoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$ system. We combine polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy\nwith X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy\n(STEM) to study MoWTe$_2$ alloys over the full compositional range x from 0 to\n1. We identify Raman and XRD signatures characteristic of the 2H, 1T$^\\prime$,\nand T$_d$ structural phases that agree with density-functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations, and use them to identify phase fields in the MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$\nsystem, including single-phase 2H, 1T$^\\prime$, and T$_d$ regions, as well as a\ntwo-phase 1T$^\\prime$ + T$_d$ region. Disorder arising from compositional\nfluctuations in MoWTe$_2$ alloys breaks inversion and translational symmetry,\nleading to the activation of an infrared 1T$^\\prime$-MoTe$_2$ mode and the\nenhancement of a double-resonance Raman process in 2H-MoWTe$_2$ alloys.\nCompositional fluctuations limit the phonon correlation length, which we\nestimate by fitting the observed asymmetric Raman lineshapes with a phonon\nconfinement model. These observations reveal the important role of disorder in\nMoWTe$_2$ alloys, clarify the structural phase boundaries, and provide a\nfoundation for future explorations of phase transitions and electronic\nphenomena in this system.\n", "  We study, from an optimal control perspective, Noether currents for\nhigher-order problems of Herglotz type with time delay. Main result provides\nnew Noether currents for such generalized variational problems, which are\nparticularly useful in the search of extremals. The proof is based on the idea\nof rewriting the higher-order delayed generalized variational problem as a\nfirst-order optimal control problem without time delays.\n", "  The study of asymptotic properties of solutions to differential equations has\na long and arduous history, with the most significant advances having been made\nin the development of quantum mechanics. A very powerful method of analysis is\nthat of Phase Integrals, described by Heading. Key to this analysis are the\nStokes constants and the rules for analytic continuation of an asymptotic\nsolution through the complex plane. These constants are easily determined for\nisolated singular points, by analytically continuing around them and, in the\ncase of analytic functions, requiring the asymptotic solution to be single\nvalued. However, most interesting problems of mathematical physics involve\nseveral singular points. By examination of analytically tractable problems and\nmore complex bound state problems involving multiple singular points, we show\nthat the method of Phase Integrals can greatly improve the determination of\nbound state energies over the simple WKB values. We also find from these\nexamples that in the limit of large separation the Stokes constant for a first\norder singular point approaches the isolated singular point value.\n", "  Recognized as elementary particles in the standard model,Weyl fermions in\ncondensed matter have received growing attention. However, most of the\npreviously reportedWeyl semimetals exhibit rather complicated electronic\nstructures that, in turn, may have raised questions regarding the underlying\nphysics. Here, we report for the first time promising topological phases that\ncan be realized in specific honeycomb lattices, including ideal Weyl semimetal\nstructures, 3D strong topological insulators, and nodal-line semimetal\nconfigurations. In particular, we highlight a novel semimetal featuring both\nWeyl nodes and nodal lines. Guided by this model, we demonstrated that GdSI the\nlong perceived ideal Weyl semimetal has two pairs ofWeyl nodes residing at the\nFermi level, and that LuSI (YSI) is a 3D strong topological insulator with the\nright-handed helical surface states. Our work provides a new mechanism to study\ntopological semimetals, and proposes a platform towards exploring the physics\nof Weyl semimetals as well as related device designs.\n", "  The MicroBooNE liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) has been taking\ndata at Fermilab since 2015 collecting, in addition to neutrino beam,\ncosmic-ray muons. Results are presented on the reconstruction of Michel\nelectrons produced by the decay at rest of cosmic-ray muons. Michel electrons\nare abundantly produced in the TPC, and given their well known energy spectrum\ncan be used to study MicroBooNE's detector response to low-energy electrons\n(electrons with energies up to ~50 MeV). We describe the fully-automated\nalgorithm developed to reconstruct Michel electrons, with which a sample of\n~14,000 Michel electron candidates is obtained. Most of this article is\ndedicated to studying the impact of radiative photons produced by Michel\nelectrons on the accuracy and resolution of their energy measurement. In this\nenergy range, ionization and bremsstrahlung photon production contribute\nsimilarly to electron energy loss in argon, leading to a complex electron\ntopology in the TPC. By profiling the performance of the reconstruction\nalgorithm on simulation we show that the ability to identify and include energy\ndeposited by radiative photons leads to a significant improvement in the energy\nmeasurement of low-energy electrons. The fractional energy resolution we\nmeasure improves from over 30% to ~20% when we attempt to include radiative\nphotons in the reconstruction. These studies are relevant to a large number of\nanalyses which aim to study neutrinos by measuring electrons produced by\n$\\nu_e$ interactions over a broad energy range.\n", "  The computation of observables in high energy QCD involves an average over\nstochastic semiclassical small-x gluon fields. The weight of various\nconfigurations is determined by the effective action. We introduce a method to\nstudy fluctuations of observables, functionals of the small-x fields, which\ndoes not explicitly involve dipoles. We integrate out those fluctuations of the\ngluon field under which a given observable is invariant. Thereby we obtain the\neffective potential for that observable describing its fluctuations about the\nsaddle point. We determine explicitly the effective potential for the covariant\ngauge gluon distribution both for the McLerran-Venugopalan (MV) model and for a\n(non-local) Gaussian approximation for the small-x effective action. This\nprovides insight into the correlation of fluctuations of the number of hard\ngluons versus their typical transverse momentum. We find that the spectral\nshape of the fluctuations of the gluon distribution is fundamentally different\nin the MV model, where there is a pile-up of gluons near the saturation scale,\nversus the solution of the small-x JIMWLK renormalization group, which\ngenerates essentially scale invariant fluctuations above the absorptive\nboundary set by the saturation scale.\n", "  We improve the methodology to construct a complete active space-configuration\ninteraction (CAS-CI) expansion for density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG)\nwave function using matrix-product state representation, inspired by the\nsampling-reconstructed CAS [SR-CAS, Boguslawski et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2011,\n134, 224101] algorithm. In our scheme, a genetic algorithm, in which the\n\"crossover\" and \"mutation\" process can be optimized based on quantum\ninformation theory, is employed when reconstructing the CASCI-type wave\nfunction in the Hilbert space. Test analysis results for the ground and excited\nstate wave functions of conjugated molecules and transition metal compounds\nillustrate that our scheme is very efficient for searching the most important\nCI expansions in large active spaces.\n", "  Materials with Dirac point are so amazing since the charge carriers are\nmassless and have an effective speed of light. Among the reported\ntwo-dimensional silicon allotropes, no one showing such exciting nature was\nproved experimentally. This fact motivates us to search for other such\ntwo-dimensional silicon allotropes. As a result, a new single atomic layer thin\nsilicon allotrope was predicted by employing CALYPSO code in this work. This\nsilicon allotrope is composed of eight- membered rings linked by Si-Si bonds\nand presents buckling formation. Expectedly, the electronic calculation reveals\nthat there exists Dirac point at Fermi energy level. Furthermore, the ab initio\nmolecular dynamics simulations displays that the original atomic configuration\ncan be remained even at an extremely high temperature of 1000 K. We hope this\nwork can expand the family of single atomic layer thin silicon allotropes with\nDirac fermions.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions are currently the most promising option to realize\ncurrent-driven magnetic shift registers. A variety of concepts to create\nskyrmions were proposed and demonstrated. However, none of the reported\nexperiments show controlled creation of single skyrmions using integrated\ndesigns. Here, we demonstrate that skyrmions can be generated deterministically\non subnanosecond timescales in magnetic racetracks at artificial or natural\ndefects using spin orbit torque (SOT) pulses. The mechanism is largely similar\nto SOT-induced switching of uniformly magnetized elements, but due to the\neffect of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), external fields are not\nrequired. Our observations provide a simple and reliable means for skyrmion\nwriting that can be readily integrated into racetrack devices.\n", "  We have systematically studied the antiferromagnetic and nematic transitions\nin Sr$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Fe$_{1.97}$Ni$_{0.03}$As$_2$ by magnetic susceptibility and\nuniaxial-pressure resistivity measurements, respectively. The derivatives of\nthe temperature dependence of both magnetic and nematic susceptibilities show\nclearly sharp peak when the transitions are first-order. Accordingly, we show\nthat while both of the magnetic and nematic transitions change from first-order\nto second-order with increasing Barium doping level, there is a narrow doping\nrange where the former becomes second-order but the latter remains first-order,\nwhich has never been realized before in other systems. Moreover, the\nantiferromagnetic and nematic transition temperatures become different and the\njump of nematic susceptibility becomes small in this intermediate doping range.\nOur results provide key information on the interplay between magnetic and\nnematic transitions. Concerning the current debate on the microscopic models\nfor nematicity in iron-based superconductors, these observations agree with the\nmagnetic scenario for an itinerant fermionic model in excellent details.\n", "  In recent years, many natural Hamiltonian systems, classical and quantum,\nwith constants of motion of high degree, or symmetry operators of high order,\nhave been found and studied. Most of these Hamiltonians, in the classical case,\ncan be included in the family of extended Hamiltonians, geometrically\ncharacterized by the structure of warped manifold of their configuration\nmanifold. For the extended manifolds, the characteristic constants of motion of\nhigh degree are polynomial in the momenta of determined form. We consider here\na different form of the constants of motion, based on the factorization\nprocedure developed by S. Kuru, J. Negro and others. We show that an important\nsubclass of the extended Hamiltonians admits factorized constants of motion and\nwe determine their expression. The classical constants may be non-polynomial in\nthe momenta, but the factorization procedure allows, in a type of extended\nHamiltonians, their quantization via shift and ladder operators, for systems of\nany finite dimension.\n", "  Even though power-law or close-to-power-law degree distributions are\nubiquitously observed in a great variety of large real networks, the\nmathematically satisfactory treatment of random power-law graphs satisfying\nbasic statistical requirements of realism is still lacking. These requirements\nare: sparsity, exchangeability, projectivity, and unbiasedness. The last\nrequirement states that entropy of the graph ensemble must be maximized under\nthe degree distribution constraints. Here we prove that the hypersoft\nconfiguration model (HSCM), belonging to the class of random graphs with latent\nhyperparameters, also known as inhomogeneous random graphs or $W$-random\ngraphs, is an ensemble of random power-law graphs that are sparse, unbiased,\nand either exchangeable or projective. The proof of their unbiasedness relies\non generalized graphons, and on mapping the problem of maximization of the\nnormalized Gibbs entropy of a random graph ensemble, to the graphon entropy\nmaximization problem, showing that the two entropies converge to each other in\nthe large-graph limit.\n", "  The scaling dimension of the first excited state in two-dimensional conformal\nfield theories (CFTs) satisfies a universal upper bound. Using the modular\nbootstrap, we extend this result to CFTs with $W_3$ algebras which are\ngenerically dual to higher spin theories in AdS$_3$. Assuming unitarity and\nmodular invariance, we show that the conformal weights $h$, $\\bar{h}$ of the\nlightest charged state satisfy $h < c/12 + O(1)$ and $\\bar{h} < \\bar{c}/12 +\nO(1)$ in the limit where the central charges $c$, $\\bar{c}$ are large.\nFurthermore, we show that in this limit any consistent CFT with $W_3$ currents\nmust contain at least one state whose $W_3$ charge $w$ obeys $|w| > 4 |h-c/24|\n/\\sqrt{10 \\pi c} + O(1)$. We discuss hints on the existence of stronger bounds\nand comment on the interpretation of our results in the dual higher spin\ntheory.\n", "  A search for top squark pair production in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV\nis performed using events with a single isolated electron or muon, jets, and a\nlarge transverse momentum imbalance. The results are based on data collected in\n2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 35.9 inverse femtobarns. No significant excess of events is\nobserved above the expectation from standard model processes. Exclusion limits\nare set in the context of supersymmetric models of pair production of top\nsquarks that decay either to a top quark and a neutralino or to a bottom quark\nand a chargino. Depending on the details of the model, we exclude top squarks\nwith masses as high as 1120 GeV. Detailed information is also provided to\nfacilitate theoretical interpretations in other scenarios of physics beyond the\nstandard model.\n", "  We examine millisecond magnetars as central engines of Gamma Ray Bursts'\n(GRB) prompt emission. Using the proto-magnetar wind model of Metzger et al.\n2011, we estimate the temporal evolution of the magnetization and power\ninjection at the base of the GRB jet and apply these to different prompt\nemission models to make predictions for the GRB energetics, spectra and\nlightcurves. We investigate both shock and magnetic reconnection models for the\nparticle acceleration, as well as the effects of energy dissipation across\noptically thick and thin regions of the jet. The magnetization at the base of\nthe jet, $\\sigma_0$, is the main parameter driving the GRB evolution in the\nmagnetar model and the emission is typically released for $100\\lesssim \\sigma_0\n\\lesssim 3000$. Given the rapid increase in $\\sigma_0$ as the proto-magnetar\ncools and its neutrino-driven mass loss subsides, the GRB duration is typically\nlimited to $\\lesssim 100$ s. This low baryon loading at late times challenges\nmagnetar models for ultra-long GRBs, though black hole models likely run into\nsimilar difficulties without substantial entrainment from the jet walls. The\nmaximum radiated gamma-ray energy is $\\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{51}$erg,\nsignificantly less than the magnetar's total initial rotational energy and in\nstrong tension with the high end of the observed GRB energy distribution.\nHowever, the gradual magnetic dissipation model (Beniamini & Giannios 2017)\napplied to a magnetar central engine, naturally explains several key\nobservables of typical GRBs, including energetics, durations, stable peak\nenergies, spectral slopes and a hard to soft evolution during the burst.\n", "  Using the spin and flux evolution of the accreting pulsar 4U 1626$-$67 across\nthe 2008 torque reversal, we determine the fastness parameter dependence of the\ndimensionless torque acting on the pulsar. We find that the dimensionless\ntorque is qualitatively different from the existing models: it is concave-up\nacross the torque equilibrium whereas the existing torque models predict a\nconcave-down (convex) relation with the fastness parameter. We show that the\ndimensionless torque has a cubic dependence on the fastness parameter near the\ntorque equilibrium. We also find that the torque can not attain large values\naway from the equilibrium, either in the positive or the negative side, but\nsaturates at limited values. The spin-down torque can attain a 2.5 times larger\nmagnitude at the saturation limit than the spin-up torque. From the evolution\nof the frequency of quasi-periodic oscillations of 4U 1626$-$67 across the\ntorque reversal of 1990, we determine the critical fastness parameter\ncorresponding to torque equilibrium to be $\\omega_{\\rm c} \\simeq 0.75$ within\nthe framework of the beat frequency model and boundary region model for\nreasonable values of the model parameters. We find that the disc magnetosphere\ninteraction becomes unstable when the inner radius approaches the corotation\nradius as predicted by some models, though with a longer timescale. We also\nfind that there is an unstable regime that is triggered when the fastness\nparameter is 0.8 times the critical fastness parameter ($\\omega=0.6$ for\n$\\omega_{\\rm c} \\simeq 0.75$) possibly associated with an instability observed\nin numerical simulations.\n", "  We have investigated the weak antilocalization (WAL) effect in the p-type\nBi$_2$Se$_{2.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ topological system. The magnetoconductance shows a\ncusp-like feature at low magnetic fields, indicating the presence of the WAL\neffect. The WAL curves measured at different tilt angles merge together when\nthey are plotted as a function of the normal field components, showing that\nsurface states dominate the magnetoconductance in the\nBi$_2$Se$_{2.1}$Te$_{0.9}$ crystal. We have calculated magnetoconductance per\nconduction channel and applied the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka formula to determine\nthe physical parameters that characterize the WAL effect. The number of\nconduction channels and the phase coherence length do not change with\ntemperature up to T=5 K. In addition, the sample shows a large positive\nmagnetoresistance that reaches 1900% under a magnetic field of 35 T at T=0.33K\nwith no sign of saturation. The magnetoresistance value decreases with both\nincreasing temperature and tilt angle of the sample surface with respect to the\nmagnetic field. The large magnetoresistance of topological insulators can be\nutilized in future technology such as sensors and memory devices.\n", "  We analyze the interplay of spin-valley coupling, orbital physics and\nmagnetic anisotropy taking place at single magnetic atoms adsorbed on\nsemiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se).\nOrbital selection rules turn out to govern the kinetic exchange coupling\nbetween the adatom and charge carriers in the MX$_2$ and lead to highly\norbitally dependent spin-flip scattering rates, as we illustrate for the\nexample of transition metal adatoms with $d^9$ configuration. Our ab initio\ncalculations suggest that $d^9$ configurations are realizable by single Co, Rh,\nor Ir adatoms on MoS$_2$, which additionally exhibit a sizable magnetic\nanisotropy. We find that the interaction of the adatom with carriers in the\nMX$_2$ allows to tune its behavior from a quantum regime with full Kondo\nscreening to a regime of \"Ising spintronics\" where its spin-orbital moment acts\nas classical bit, which can be erased and written electronically and optically.\n", "  We theoretically study a Kitaev chain with a quasiperiodic potential, where\nthe quasiperiodicity is introduced by a Fibonacci sequence. Based on an\nanalysis of the Majorana zero-energy mode, we find the critical $p$-wave\nsuperconducting pairing potential separating a topological phase and a\nnon-topological phase. The topological phase diagram with respect to Fibonacci\npotentials follow a self-similar fractal structure characterized by the\nbox-counting dimension, which is an example of the interplay of fractal and\ntopology like the Hofstadter's butterfly in quantum Hall insulators.\n", "  The spreading of a cap-shaped spherical droplet of non-Newtonian power-law\nliquids, both shear-thinning and shear-thinning liquids, that completely wet a\nspherical substrate is theoretically investigated in the capillary-controlled\nspreading regime. The crater-shaped droplet model with the wedge-shaped\nmeniscus near the three-phase contact line is used to calculate the viscous\ndissipation near the contact line. Then the energy balance approach is adopted\nto derive the equation which governs the evolution of the contact line. The\ntime evolution of the dynamic contact angle $\\theta$ of a droplet obeys a power\nlaw $\\theta \\sim t^{-\\alpha}$ with the spreading exponent $\\alpha$, which is\ndifferent from Tanner's law for Newtonian liquids and those for non-Newtonian\nliquids on a flat substrate. Furthermore, the line-tension dominated spreading,\nwhich could be realized on a spherical substrate for late-stage of spreading\nwhen the contact angle becomes low and the curvature of the contact line\nbecomes large, is also investigated.\n", "  Epithelial cells cultured in a monolayer are very motile in isolation but\nreach a near-jammed state when mitotic division increases their number above a\ncritical threshold. We have recently shown that a monolayer can be reawakened\nby over-expression of a single protein, RAB5A, a master regulator of\nendocytosis. This reawakening of motility was explained in term of a flocking\ntransition that promotes the emergence of a large-scale collective migratory\npattern. Here we focus on the impact of this reawakening on the structural\nproperties of the monolayer. We find that the unjammed monolayer is\ncharacterised by a fluidisation at the single cell level and by enhanced\nnon-equilibrium large-scale number fluctuations at a larger length scale. Also\nwith the help of numerical simulations, we trace back the origin of these\nfluctuations to the self-propelled active nature of the constituents and to the\nexistence of a local alignment mechanism, leading to the spontaneous breaking\nof the orientational symmetry.\n", "  The zero-temperature angles of magnetic moments in a helix or sinusoidal fan\nconfined to the xy plane, with respect to an in-plane magnetic field Hx applied\nperpendicular to the z axis of a helix or fan, are calculated for commensurate\nhelices and fans with field-independent turn angles kd between moments in\nadjacent layers of the helix or fan using the classical J0-J1-J2 Heisenberg\nmodel. For 0 < kd < $4\\pi/9$, first-order transitions from helix to a fan\nstructure occur at fields Ht as previously inferred, where the fan is found to\nbe approximately sinusoidal. However, for $4 \\pi/9$ < kd < $\\pi$, different\nbehaviors are found depending on the value of kd and these properties vary\nnonmonotonically with kd. In this kd range, the change from helix to fanlike\nstructure is usually a crossover with no phase transition between them,\nalthough first-order and second order transitions are found. We also calculated\nthe average x-axis moment per spin $\\mu_{x ave}$ versus Hx for helices and fans\nwith crossovers and phase transitions between them. When smooth helix to\nfanlike crossovers occur in the range $4\\pi/9$ < kd < $\\pi$, $\\mu_{x ave}$\nexhibits an S-shape behavior with increasing Hx. This predicted behavior is\nconsistent with $\\mu_{x ave}$(Hx) data previously reported by Sangeetha, et al.\n[Phys. Rev. B 94, 014422 (2016)] for single-crystal EuCo2P2 possessing a helix\nground state with kd = $0.85\\pi$. The low-field magnetic susceptibility and the\nratio Ht/Hc are calculated analytically or numerically versus kd for helices.\n", "  Strongly Coupled Dark Energy plus Warm dark matter (SCDEW) cosmologies admit\nthe stationary presence of $\\sim 1\\, \\%$ of coupled-DM and DE, since\ninflationary reheating. Coupled-DM fluctuations therefore grow up to\nnon-linearity even in the early radiative expansion. Such early non-linear\nstages are modelized here through the evolution of a top-hat density\nenhancement, reaching an early virial balance when the coupled-DM density\ncontrast is just 25-26 and DM density enhancement is $ \\sim 10\\, \\%$ of total\ndensity. During the time needed to settle in virial equilibium, the virial\nbalance conditions however continue to modify, so that \"virialized\" lumps\nundergo a complete evaporation. Here we outline that DM particles processed by\noverdentities preserve a fraction of their virial momentum. Although fully\nnon-relativistic, the resulting velocities (moderately) affect the fluctuation\ndynamics over greater scales, entering the horizon later on.\n", "  A generalization of the quantum van der Waals equation of state for a\nmulti-component system in the grand canonical ensemble is proposed. The model\nincludes quantum statistical effects and allows to specify the parameters\ncharacterizing repulsive and attractive forces for each pair of particle\nspecies. The model can be straightforwardly applied to the description of\nasymmetric nuclear matter and also for mixtures of interacting nucleons and\nnuclei. Applications of the model to the equation of state of an interacting\nhadron resonance gas are discussed.\n", "  We study the problem to infer the original ground state of a spin-glass\nHamiltonian out of the information from the Hamiltonian with interactions\ndeviated from the original ones. Our motivation comes from quantum annealing on\na real device in which the values of interactions are degraded by noise. We\nshow numerically for quasi-one-dimensional systems that the Hamming distance\nbetween the original ground state and the inferred spin state is minimized when\nwe stop the process of quantum annealing before the amplitude of the transverse\nfield reaches zero in contrast to the conventional prescription. This result\nmeans that finite quantum fluctuations compensate for the effects of noise, at\nleast to some extent. Analytical calculations using the infinite-range\nmean-field model support our conclusion qualitatively.\n", "  The fully halogenated or hydrogenated B12X12 (X = H, F, Cl, Br and I)\nclusters are confirmed to be icosahedral. On the other hand, the bare B12\ncluster is shown to have a planar structure. A previous study showed that a\ntransformation from an icosahedron to a plane happens when 5 to 7 iodine atoms\nare substituted. Later, the transition was confirmed to be seven iodine\nsubstitutions based on an infrared spectroscopy study. In this study, we\ninvestigated the effects of different halogen atoms on the opening of the B12\nicosahedral cage by means of density functional theory calculations. We found\nthat the halogen elements do not have significant effects on the geometries of\nthe clusters. The computed IR spectra show similar representative peaks for all\nhalogen substituted clusters. Interestingly, we found a blue-shift in the IR\nspectra with the increase in the mass of the halogen atoms. Further, we\ncompared the Gibbs free energies at different temperatures for different\nhalogen atoms. The results show that the Gibbs free energy differences between\nopen and close structures of B12X7 become larger when heavier halogen atoms are\npresent. This interesting finding was subsequently investigated by energy\ndecomposition analysis.\n", "  The Prabhakar function (namely, a three parameter Mittag-Leffler function) is\ninvestigated. This function plays a fundamental role in the description of the\nanomalous dielectric properties in disordered materials and heterogeneous\nsystems manifesting simultaneous nonlocality and nonlinearity and, more\ngenerally, in models of Havriliak-Negami type. After reviewing some of the main\nproperties of the function, the asymptotic expansion for large arguments is\ninvestigated in the whole complex plane and, with major emphasis, along the\nnegative semi-axis. Fractional integral and derivative operators of Prabhakar\ntype are hence considered and some nonlinear heat conduction equations with\nmemory involving Prabhakar derivatives are studied.\n", "  Scientific curiosity to uncover original optical properties and\nfunctionalities of atomically thin semiconductors, stemming from unusual\nCoulomb interactions in the two-dimensional geometry and multi-valley band\nstructure, drives the research on monolayers of transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDs). While recent works ascertained the exotic energetic\nschemes of exciton complexes in TMDs, we here employ four-wave mixing\nmicroscopy to indicate that their subpicosecond dynamics is determined by the\nsurrounding disorder. Focusing on a monolayer WS$_2$, we observe that exciton\ncoherence is lost primarily due to interaction with phonons and relaxation\nprocesses towards optically dark excitonic states. Notably, when temperature is\nlow and disorder weak excitons large coherence volume results in huge\noscillator strength, allowing to reach the regime of radiatively limited\ndephasing and we observe long valley coherence. We thus elucidate the crucial\nrole of exciton environment in the TMDs on its dynamics and show that revealed\nmechanisms are ubiquitous within that family.\n", "  We show how all possible one-particle reducible tadpole diagrams in constant\nelectromagnetic fields can be constructed from one-particle irreducible\nconstant-field diagrams. The construction procedure is essentially algebraic\nand involves differentiations of the latter class of diagrams with respect to\nthe field strength tensor and contractions with derivatives of the one-particle\nirreducible part of the Heisenberg-Euler effective Lagrangian in constant\nfields. Specific examples include the two-loop addendum to the Heisenberg-Euler\neffective action as well as a novel one-loop correction to the charged particle\npropagator in constant electromagnetic fields discovered recently. As an\nadditional example, the approach devised in the present article is adopted to\nderive the tadpole contribution to the two-loop photon polarization tensor in\nconstant fields for the first time.\n", "  Context: Methanol is thought to be mainly formed during the prestellar phase\nand its deuterated form keeps memory of the conditions at that epoch. Thanks to\nthe unique combination of high angular resolution and sensitivity provided by\nALMA, we wish to measure methanol deuteration in the planet formation region\naround a Class 0 protostar and to understand its origin. Aims: We mapped both\nthe $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and CH$_2$DOH distribution in the inner regions ($\\sim$100\nau) of the HH212 system in Orion B. To this end, we used ALMA Cycle 1 and Cycle\n4 observations in Band 7 with angular resolution down to $\\sim$0.15$\"$.\nResults: We detected 6 lines of $^{13}$CH$_3$OH and 13 lines of CH$_2$DOH with\nupper level energies up to 438 K in temperature units. We derived a rotational\ntemperature of (171 $\\pm$ 52) K and column densities of 7$\\times$10$^{16}$\ncm$^{-2}$ ($^{13}$CH$_3$OH) and 1$\\times$10$^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$ (CH$_2$DOH),\nrespectively. Consequently, the D/H ratio is (2.4 $\\pm$ 0.4)$\\times$10$^{-2}$,\na value lower by an order of magnitude with respect to what was previously\nmeasured using single dish telescopes toward protostars located in Perseus. Our\nfindings are consistent with the higher dust temperatures in Orion B with\nrespect to that derived for the Perseus cloud. The emission is tracing a\nrotating structure extending up to 45 au from the jet axis and elongated by 90\nau along the jet axis. So far, the origin of the observed emission appears to\nbe related with the accretion disk. Only higher spatial resolution measurements\nhowever, will be able to disentangle between different possible scenarios: disk\nwind, disk atmosphere, or accretion shocks.\n", "  We give explicit criteria for the reflectionlessness, transparency, and\ninvisibility of a finite-range potential in the presence of an incoherent\n(intensity-dependent) nonlinearity that is confined to the range of the\npotential. This allows us to conduct a systematic study of the effects of such\na nonlinearity on a locally periodic class of finite-range potentials that\ndisplay perturbative unidirectional invisibility. We use our general results to\nexamine the effects of a weak Kerr nonlinearity on the behavior of these\npotentials and show that the presence of nonlinearity destroys the\nunidirectional invisibility of these potentials. If the strength of the Kerr\nnonlinearity is so weak that the first-order perturbation theory is reliable,\nthe presence of nonlinearity does not affect the unidirectional\nreflectionlessness and transmission reciprocity of the potential. We show that\nthe expected violation of the latter is a second order perturbative effect.\n", "  Spiking networks that perform probabilistic inference have been proposed both\nas models of cortical computation and as candidates for solving problems in\nmachine learning. However, the evidence for spike-based computation being in\nany way superior to non-spiking alternatives remains scarce. We propose that\nshort-term plasticity can provide spiking networks with distinct computational\nadvantages compared to their classical counterparts. In this work, we use\nnetworks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that are trained to perform both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks in their forward and backward information\nprocessing paths, respectively. During training, the energy landscape\nassociated with their dynamics becomes highly diverse, with deep attractor\nbasins separated by high barriers. Classical algorithms solve this problem by\nemploying various tempering techniques, which are both computationally\ndemanding and require global state updates. We demonstrate how similar results\ncan be achieved in spiking networks endowed with local short-term synaptic\nplasticity. Additionally, we discuss how these networks can even outperform\ntempering-based approaches when the training data is imbalanced. We thereby\nshow how biologically inspired, local, spike-triggered synaptic dynamics based\nsimply on a limited pool of synaptic resources can allow spiking networks to\noutperform their non-spiking relatives.\n", "  Up to date, there is no consensus regarding the origin of ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays (UHECR) beyond the Greisen--Zatsepin--Kuzmin (GZK) limit. In order\nfor these UHECRs to reach the Earth, an extremely suppressed interaction\nbetween them and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is required, which is\nimpossible for standard model (SM) particles, except neutrinos. In this letter,\nwe present constraints on the parameter space of models involving axion-like\nparticles and dark photons, as candidates for UHECRs, by assuming that these\nparticles can traverse the visible Universe without decaying. In the case of\naxion-like particles, the constraints are tighter than those given in previous\nworks. We present for the first time constraints on the parameter space of dark\nphoton models, by considering their kinetic term mixing with SM photons.\n", "  Electrooptic modulation performs the conversion between the electrical and\noptical domain with applications in data communication for optical\ninterconnects, but also for novel optical compute algorithms such as providing\nnonlinearity at the output stage of optical perceptrons in neuromorphic\nanalogue optical computing. Since the clock frequency for photonics on chip has\na power overhead sweet slot around 10s of GHz, ultrafast modulation may only be\nrequired in long distance communication, but not for short onchip links. Here\nwe show a roadmap towards atto Joule per bit efficient modulators on chip as\nwell as some experimental demonstrations of novel plasmon modulators with sub\n1fJ per bit efficiencies. We then discuss the first experimental demonstration\nof a photon plasmon-hybrid Graphene-based electroabsorption modulator on\nsilicon. The device shows a sub 1V steep switching enabled by near ideal\nelectrostatics delivering a high 0.05dB per V um performance requiring only 110\naJ per bit. Improving on this design, we discuss a plasmonic slot based\nGraphene modulator design, where the polarization of the plasmonic mode matches\nwith Graphenes inplane dimension. Here a push pull dual gating scheme enables\n2dB per V um efficient modulation allowing the device to be just 770 nm short\nfor 3dB small signal modulation. This in turn allows for a device-enabled two\norders of magnitude improvement of electrical optical co integrated network on\nchips over electronic only architectures. The latter opens technological\nopportunities in in cognitive computing, dynamic data-driven applications\nsystem, and optical analogue compute engines to include neuromorphic photonic\ncomputing.\n", "  Atomic Fermi gases have been an ideal platform for simulating conventional\nand engineering exotic physical systems owing to their multiple tunable control\nparameters. Here we investigate the effects of mixed dimensionality on the\nsuperfluid and pairing phenomena of a two-component ultracold atomic Fermi gas\nwith a short-range pairing interaction, while one component is confined on a\none-dimensional (1D) optical lattice whereas the other is in a homogeneous 3D\ncontinuum. We study the phase diagram and the pseudogap phenomena throughout\nthe entire BCS-BEC crossover, using a pairing fluctuation theory. We find that\nthe effective dimensionality of the non-interacting lattice component can\nevolve from quasi-3D to quasi-1D, leading to strong Fermi surface mismatch.\nUpon pairing, the system becomes effectively quasi-two dimensional in the BEC\nregime. The behavior of $T_c$ bears similarity to that of a regular 3D\npopulation imbalanced Fermi gas, but with a more drastic departure from the\nregular 3D balanced case, featuring both intermediate temperature superfluidity\nand possible pair density wave ground state. Unlike a simple 1D optical lattice\ncase, $T_c$ in the mixed dimensions has a constant BEC asymptote.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the\nself-diffusion of ammonia on exfoliated graphite. Using neutron time-of-flight\nspectroscopy we are able to resolve the ultrafast diffusion process of adsorbed\nammonia, NH$_3$, on graphite. Together with van der Waals corrected density\nfunctional theory calculations we show that the diffusion of NH$_3$ follows a\nhopping motion on a weakly corrugated potential energy surface with an\nactivation energy of about 4 meV which is particularly low for this type of\ndiffusive motion. The hopping motion includes further a significant number of\nlong jumps and the diffusion constant of ammonia adsorbed on graphite is\ndetermined with $D=3.9 \\cdot 10^{-8}~\\mbox{m}^2 /\\mbox{s}$ at 94 K.\n", "  We apply quantum statistics to our quantized versions of Schwarzschild-AdS\nand Kerr-AdS black holes and also to the quantized globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes having an asymptotically Euclidean Cauchy hypersurface by first\nproving, for the temporal Hamiltonian $H_0$, that $e^{-\\beta H_0}$, $\\beta>0$,\nis of trace class and then, that this result is also valid for the spatial\nHamiltonian $H_1$, which has the same eigenvalues but with larger\nmultiplicities. Since the lowest eigenvalue is strictly positive the extension\nof $e^{-\\beta H_1}$ to the corresponding symmetric Fock space is also of trace\nclass and we are thus able to define a partition function $Z$, the operator\ndensity $\\rho$, the entropy $S$, and the average energy $E$. We prove that $S$\nand $E$ tend to infinity if the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ tends to $0$\nand vanish if $|\\Lambda|$ tends to infinity. We also conjecture that $E$ is the\nsource of the dark matter and that the dark energy density is a multiple of the\neigenvalue of $\\rho$ with respect to the vacuum vector which is $Z^{-1}$.\n", "  Particle indistinguishability is at the heart of quantum statistics that\nregulates fundamental phenomena such as the electronic band structure of\nsolids, Bose-Einstein condensation and superconductivity. Moreover, it is\nnecessary in practical applications such as linear optical quantum computation\nand simulation, in particular for Boson Sampling devices. It is thus crucial to\ndevelop tools to certify genuine multiphoton interference between multiple\nsources. Here we show that so-called Sylvester interferometers are near-optimal\nfor the task of discriminating the behaviors of distinguishable and\nindistinguishable photons. We report the first implementations of integrated\nSylvester interferometers with 4 and 8 modes with an efficient, scalable and\nreliable 3D-architecture. We perform two-photon interference experiments\ncapable of identifying indistinguishable photon behaviour with a Bayesian\napproach using very small data sets. Furthermore, we employ experimentally this\nnew device for the assessment of scattershot Boson Sampling. These results open\nthe way to the application of Sylvester interferometers for the optimal\nassessment of multiphoton interference experiments.\n", "  We extend the inner product from bosonic Fock space to a pairing between\nsuitable antifunctionals on the symmetric algebra. Our account is illustrated\nby the (Gaussian) half-form pairing between positive polarizations in the form\nneeded for geometric quantization.\n", "  Techniques for approximately contracting tensor networks are limited in how\nefficiently they can make use of parallel computing resources. In this work we\ndemonstrate and characterize a Monte Carlo approach to the tensor network\nrenormalization group method which can be used straightforwardly on modern\ncomputing architectures. We demonstrate the efficiency of the technique and\nshow that Monte Carlo tensor network renormalization provides an attractive\npath to improving the accuracy of a wide class of challenging computations\nwhile also providing useful estimates of uncertainty and a statistical\nguarantee of unbiased results.\n", "  NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. It uses the NuMI\nbeam from Fermilab and two sampling calorimeter detectors placed off-axis from\nthe beam. The 293 ton Near Detector measures the unoscillated neutrino energy\nspectrum, which can be used to predict the neutrino energy spectrum observed at\nthe 14 kton Far Detector. The Near Detector also provides an excellent\nopportunity to measure neutrino interaction cross sections with high\nstatistics, which will benefit current and future long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments. This analysis implements new algorithms to identify\n$\\nu_{\\mu}$ charge-current events by using visual deep learning tools such as\nconvolutional neural networks. We present the status of a measurement of the\ninclusive $\\nu_{\\mu}$ CC cross section in the NOvA Near Detector.\n", "  The NOvA experiment observes oscillations in two channels (electron-neutrino\nappearance and muon-neutrino disappearance) using a predominantly muon-neutrino\nNuMI beam. The Near Detector records multiple overlapping neutrino interactions\nin each event and the Far Detector has a large background of cosmic rays due to\nbeing located on the surface. The oscillation analyses rely on the accurate\nreconstruction of neutrino interactions in order to precisely measure the\nneutrino energy and identify the neutrino flavor and interaction mode.\nSimilarly, measurements of neutrino cross sections using the Near Detector\nrequire accurate identification of the particle content of each interaction. A\nseries of pattern recognition techniques have been developed to split event\nrecords into individual spatially and temporally separated interactions, to\nestimate the interaction vertex, and to isolate and classify individual\nparticles within the event. This combination of methods to achieve full event\nreconstruction in the NOvA detectors has discussed.\n", "  Studies of heavy ion collisions have discovered that tiny fireballs of new\nphase of matter -- quark gluon plasma (QGP) -- undergoes explosion, called the\nLittle Bang. In spite of its small size, it is not only well described by\nhydrodynamics, but even small perturbations on top of the explosion turned to\nbe well described by hydrodynamical sound modes. The cosmological Big Bang also\nwent through phase transitions, the QCD and electroweak ones, which are\nexpected to produce sounds as well. We discuss their subsequent evolution and\nhypothetical inverse acoustic cascade, amplifying the amplitude. Ultimately,\ncollision of two sound waves leads to formation of gravity waves, with the\nsmallest wavelength. We briefly discuss how those can be detected.\n", "  In 1827, Colladon carried out a series of experiments in Lac Leman (Lake\nGeneva, Switzerland) to measure the speed of sound in water.\n  The purpose of our contribution is to treat this measurement as an inverse\nproblem, and show, by theory how to solve the latter. It is thus revealed under\nwhat circumstances it is legitimate to employ the time-of-flight scheme\nunderlying the Colladon experiments and how to bypass this scheme in order to\nfully account for the temporal and geometric characteristics of the source (of\nsound), the temporal characteristics of the received signal and the error\nincurred by the finite distance between the source and receiver.\n", "  Actin is a key component of the cytoskeleton, which plays central roles in\ncell motility, division, growth, and tensile strength. To enable this wide\nrange of transient mechanical processes and properties, networks of actin\nfilaments continuously disassemble and reassemble via active\nde/re-polymerization. However, the question remains as to how\nde/re-polymerization kinetics of individual actin filaments translate to\ntime-varying mechanics of dis/re-assembling networks. To address this question,\nto ultimately elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to exhibit a\nmyriad of transitory mechanical properties, we couple time-resolved active\nmicrorheology with microfluidics to measure the time-varying viscoelastic\nmoduli of entangled and crosslinked actin networks during chemically-triggered\nnetwork disassembly and reassembly. We also develop a corresponding\nmathematical model that relates the time-evolution of filament length to the\nresulting time-dependent storage moduli of evolving networks. During\ndisassembly, we find that the moduli exhibit two distinct exponential decays,\nwith experimental time constants of $\\sim$169 and $\\sim$47 min, which we show\narises from a phase transition from a rigid percolated network to a non-rigid\nregime occurring after $\\sim$90 min. During reassembly, measured moduli exhibit\nlinear increase with time for $\\sim$90 min, after which steady-state values are\nachieved. Our theoretical model shows that reassembly mechanics are dominated\nby elongation kinetics, and that elongation rates are much slower than has been\nrecently assumed. Our measurements shed much needed light onto how\npolymerization kinetics map to time-varying mechanics of actively evolving\ncytoskeleton networks, and provide a powerful platform for studying other\nactive and dynamic systems currently under intense investigation.\n", "  Solar photovoltaic power generation has achieved grid parity in a number of\ncountries during the last decade. This revolution has begun in countries where\nthe solar radiation intensity is not very high. Solar resource maps created by\na number of agencies worldwide indicate that areas of high intensity of solar\nradiation suitable solar for power generation are in deserts and semi-arid\nzones. These regions are dusty and are subjected to both anthropogenic\npollution and natural sand storms. The impact of these events on the solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) plant yield is significant. An increase in diffuse component\nof solar radiation is accompanied by a naturally occurring sand storm. Often\nthe solar panels are tilted at an optimal angle and the global tilted radiation\nvalue falling on the panels changes significantly during and after the sand\nstorms. It is noted that the decrease in the power output of a solar\nphotovoltaic plant during such events is high enough to warrant further\nconsideration while forecasting the plant output. Inverter performance during\nsuch sand storms is found to be satisfactory. Integrating dust storm monitoring\nwith PV power plant yield prediction algorithms is necessary for an improved\noperation of PV plants.\n", "  In this technical note, we study the possibility of using networks of\nground-based detectors to directly measure gravitational-wave polarizations\nusing signals from compact binary coalescences. We present a simple data\nanalysis method to partially achieve this, assuming presence of a strong signal\nwell-captured by a GR template.\n", "  The Mu2e experiment will search for coherent, neutrino-less conversion of\nmuons into electrons in the Coulomb field of an aluminum nucleus with a\nsensitivity of four orders of magnitude better than previous experiments. The\nsignature of this process is an electron with energy nearly equal to the muon\nmass. Mu2e relies on a precision (0.1%) measurement of the outgoing electron\nmomentum to separate signal from background. In order to achieve this goal,\nMu2e has chosen a very low-mass straw tracker, made of 20,736 5 mm diameter\nthin-walled (15 $\\mu$m) Mylar straws, held under tension to avoid the need for\nsupports within the active volume, and arranged in an approximately 3 m long by\n0.7 m radius cylinder, operated in vacuum and a 1 T magnetic field. Groups of\n96 straws are assembled into modules, called panels. We present the prototype\nand the assembly procedure for a Mu2e tracker panel built at Fermilab\n", "  In the first paper of this series, I introduced a non-linear, Hamiltonian,\ngeneralization of Schroedinger's theory that blocks formation of macroscopic\ndispersion (\"cats\"). But that theory was entirely deterministic, and so the\norigin of random outcomes in experiments such as Stern-Gerlach or EPRB was left\nopen. Here I propose that Schroedinger's wavefunction has a random component\nand demonstrate that such an improvised stochastic theory can violate Bell's\ninequality. Repeated measurements and the back-reaction on the microsystem are\ndiscussed in a toy example. Experiments that might falsify the theory are\ndescribed.\n", "  We study the Derivative Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (DNLS). equation for general\ninitial conditions in weighted Sobolev spaces that can support bright solitons\n(but exclude spectral singularities corresponding to algebraic solitons). We\nshow that the set of such initial data is open and dense in a weighted Sobolev\nspace, and includes data of arbitrarily large $L^2$-norm. We prove global\nwell-posedness on this open and dense set. In a subsequent paper, we will use\nthese results and a steepest descent analysis to prove the soliton resolution\nconjecture for the DNLS equation with the initial data considered here and\nasymptotic stability of $N-$soliton solutions.\n", "  If dark matter annihilates to light quarks in the core of the Sun, then a\nflux of 236 MeV neutrinos will be produced from the decay of stopped kaons. We\nconsider strategies for DUNE to not only observe such a signal, but to\ndetermine the direction of the neutrino from the hadronic recoil. We show that\nthis novel strategy can provide a better handle on systematic uncertainties\nassociated with dark matter searches.\n", "  This work is a natural extension of the authors previous work, Multiple\nscattering theory for heterogeneous elastic continua with strong property\nfluctuation, theoretical fundamentals and applications, which established the\nfoundation for developing multiple scattering model for strongly scattering\nheterogeneous elastic continua. In this work, the corresponding multiple\nscattering theory for polycrystalline materials with randomly oriented\nanisotropic crystallites is developed. As applications in ultrasonic\nnondestructive evaluation, we calculated the dispersion and attenuation\ncoefficient of one of the most important polycrystalline materials in\naeronautics engineering, high temperature titanium alloys. The effects of grain\nsymmetry, grain size, and alloying elements on the dispersion and attenuation\nbehaviors are examined. Key information is obtained which has significant\nimplications for quantitatively evaluating the average grain size, monitoring\nthe phase transition, and even estimating gradual change in chemical\ncomposition of titanium components in gas turbine engines. For applications in\nseismology, the velocities and Q-factors for both hexagonal and cubic\npolycrystalline iron models for the Earth uppermost inner core are obtained in\nthe whole frequency range. This work provides a universal, quantitative model\nfor characterization of a large variety of polycrystalline materials. It also\ncan be extended to incorporate more complicated microstructures, including\nellipsoidal grains with or without textures, and even multiphase\npolycrystalline materials. The new model demonstrates great potential of\napplications in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation and inspection of\naerospace and aeronautic structures. It also provides a theoretical framework\nfor quantitative seismic data explanation and inversion for the material\ncomposition and structural formations of the Earth inner core.\n", "  NOvA is a two detector, long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment\ndesigned to study $\\nu_{e}$ ($\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$) appearance and $\\nu_{\\mu}$\n($\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$) disappearance in a $\\nu_{\\mu}$ ($\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu}$) beam\nproduced at Fermilab. The near detector (ND) is located 100 meters underground\nat a distance of 1 km from the target whereas the far detector (FD) is located\non the surface, 810 km away from the beam source in Ash River, MN. The ND is\nused to measure the beam before oscillations and the FD measures the oscillated\nspectrum. The ND and the FD are functionally identical detectors and the ND\nspectra are extrapolated to the FD to predict the signal and background spectra\nexpected in the FD. The extrapolation and data fitting techniques developed for\nthese analyses within NOvA are presented.\n", "  The ANAIS experiment aims at the confirmation of the DAMA/LIBRA signal at the\nCanfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). Several 12.5 kg NaI(Tl) modules produced\nby Alpha Spectra Inc. have been operated there during the last years in various\nset-ups; an outstanding light collection at the level of 15 photoelectrons per\nkeV, which allows triggering at 1 keV of visible energy, has been measured for\nall of them and a complete characterization of their background has been\nachieved. In the first months of 2017, the full ANAIS-112 set-up consisting of\nnine Alpha Spectra detectors with a total mass of 112.5 kg was commissioned at\nLSC and the first dark matter run started in August, 2017. Here, the latest\nresults on the detectors performance and measured background from the\ncommissioning run will be presented and the sensitivity prospects of the\nANAIS-112 experiment will be discussed.\n", "  The analysis of statistical and systematic uncertainties and their\npropogation to nuclear extremes has been performed. Two extremes of nuclear\nlandscape (neutron-rich nuclei and superheavy nuclei) have been investigated.\nFor the first extreme, we focus on the ground state properties. For the second\nextreme, we pay a particular attention to theoretical uncertainties in the\ndescription of fission barriers of superheavy nuclei and their evolution on\ngoing to neutron-rich nuclei.\n", "  The distinction between the plasma dynamics dominated by collisional\ntransport versus collective processes has never been rigorously addressed until\nrecently. A recent paper [Yoon et al., Phys. Rev. E 93, 033203 (2016)]\nformulates for the first time, a unified kinetic theory in which collective\nprocesses and collisional dynamics are systematically incorporated from first\nprinciples. One of the outcomes of such a formalism is the rigorous derivation\nof collisional damping rates for Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, which can be\ncontrasted to the heuristic customary approach. However, the results are given\nonly in formal mathematical expressions. The present Brief Communication\nnumerically evaluates the rigorous collisional damping rates by considering the\ncase of plasma particles with Maxwellian velocity distribution function so as\nto assess the consequence of the rigorous formalism in a quantitative manner.\nComparison with the heuristic (\"Spitzer\") formula shows that the accurate\ndamping rates are much lower in magnitude than the conventional expression,\nwhich implies that the traditional approach over-estimates the importance of\nattenuation of plasma waves by collisional relaxation process. Such a finding\nmay have a wide applicability ranging from laboratory to space and\nastrophysical plasmas.\n", "  Surface heat flow is a key parameter for the geothermal structure, rheology,\nand hence the dynamics of continents. However, the coverage of heat flow\nmeasurements is still poor in many continental areas. By transforming the\nstable nonlinear heat conduction equation into a Poisson's one, we develop a\nmethod to infer surface heat flow for a stable or quasi-stable continent from a\nParker's-like formula. This formula provides the relationship between the\nFourier transform of surface heat flow and the sum of the Fourier transform of\nthe powers of geometry for the heat production (HP) interface in the\ncontinental lithosphere. Once the interface geometry is known, one to three\ndimensional distribution of the surface heat flow can be calculated accurately\nby this formula. As a case study, we estimate the three-dimensional surface\nheat flows for the Ordos geological block and its adjacent areas in China on a\n$1^\\circ \\times 1^\\circ$ grid based on a simple layered constant HP model.\nComparing to the measurements, most relative errors of the heat flows inferred\nare less than 20\\%, showing this method is a favorable way to estimate surface\nheat flow for stable or quasi-stable continental regions where measurements are\nrare or absent.\n", "  NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. It uses the NuMI\nbeam from Fermilab and two sampling calorimeter detectors located off-axis from\nthe beam. The NOvA experiment measures the rate of electron-neutrino appearance\nin the almost pure muon-neutrino NuMI beam, with the data measured at the Near\nDetector being used to accurately determine the expected rate at the Far\nDetector. It is very important to have automated and accurate monitoring of the\ndata recorded by the detectors so any hardware, DAQ or beam issues arising in\nthe 344k (20k) channels of the Far (Near) detector which could affect the\nquality of the data taking are determined. This paper will cover the techniques\nand detector monitoring systems in various stages of data taking.\n", "  Formation of recirculating wakes is a prominent feature of inertial flow\naround bluff bodies. Below the onset of vortex shedding in uniform unbounded\nflows, the fluid in the recirculating wake region moves on closed planar\norbits. The steady wake is thus an isolated zone in the flow and does not\nexchange fluid with the free stream. In this work, we utilize lattice-Boltzmann\nsimulations and microfluidic experiments to demonstrate that in microchannel\ninertial flow of Newtonian fluids, the recirculating wake is replaced by a\nthree-dimensional vortical flow. Spiraling streamlines generate a continuous\nexchange of fluid between the vortex behind the obstacle and the free stream.\nThe flow inertia is represented by Reynolds number defined as $Re =\n\\frac{u_{max}D_{y}}{\\nu}$, where $u_{max}$ is the maximum fluid velocity in the\nchannel inlet, $D_{y}$ is the characteristic obstacle length and $\\nu$ is the\nfluid kinematic viscosity. We discuss the effects of $Re$, the obstacle shape\nand the wall confinement on the fluid entry into the vortex. Further, we\ndemonstrate that in flow of a dilute suspension of particles around the\nobstacle, the fluid entry into the vortex can result in entrapment of particles\nas well.\n", "  In Astrophysics, the identification of candidate Globular Clusters through\ndeep, wide-field, single band HST images, is a typical data analytics problem,\nwhere methods based on Machine Learning have revealed a high efficiency and\nreliability, demonstrating the capability to improve the traditional\napproaches. Here we experimented some variants of the known Neural Gas model,\nexploring both supervised and unsupervised paradigms of Machine Learning, on\nthe classification of Globular Clusters, extracted from the NGC1399 HST data.\nMain focus of this work was to use a well-tested playground to scientifically\nvalidate such kind of models for further extended experiments in astrophysics\nand using other standard Machine Learning methods (for instance Random Forest\nand Multi Layer Perceptron neural network) for a comparison of performances in\nterms of purity and completeness.\n", "  The classical disturbing function of the three-body problem widely used in\nplanetary dynamics studies is an expansion of the gravitational interaction of\nthe three-body problem with respect to zero eccentricity and zero inclination.\nThis restricts its validity to nearly coplanar orbits. Motivated by the\ndynamical study of asteroids, Centaurs and transneptunian objects with\narbitrary inclinations, we derive a series expansion of the gravitational\ninteraction with respect to an arbitrary reference inclination that generalises\nour work on the polar and retrograde disturbing functions. The new disturbing\nfunction, like the polar one, may model any resonance as expansion order is\nunrelated to resonance order. The powers of eccentricity and inclination of the\nforce amplitude of a $p$:$q$ resonance depend only on the parity of the\nresonance order $|p-q|$. Disturbing functions with non zero reference\ninclinations are thus physically different from the classical disturbing\nfunction as the former are based on the three-dimensional three-body problem\nand the latter on the two-dimensional one. We illustrate the use of the new\ndisturbing function by showing that what is known as pure eccentricity\nresonances are intrinsically dependent on inclination contrary to the\nprediction of the classical disturbing function. We determine the inclination\ndependence of the resonance widths of the 2:1 and 3:1 prograde and retrograde\ninner resonances with Jupiter as well as those of the asymmetric librations of\nthe 1:2 and 1:3 prograde outer resonances with Neptune.\n", "  We report on our progress developing highly-miniaturised,\npolarisation-entangled, photon pair sources for CubeSats. We have a correlated\nphoton-pair source in orbit in the NUS Galassia 2U CubeSat. We also have an\nentangled photon pair source in production and a high brightness (1Mcps)\nentangled photon-pair source in development for our upcoming satellite\nmissions. All our sources are proof-of-principle demonstrations that the\nhardware necessary for entanglement-based QKD can be miniaturised and made\nsufficiently robust for operation in nano-satellites. The photon pairs they\nproduce are measured with liquid crystal-based Bell state analysers and\nGeiger-mode avalanche photo-diodes within the source. These space missions\nallow our on-the-ground radiation, thermal and vibration tests to be validated\nand the real-world operation and aging of the source in space to be studied. A\nBBM92 QKD-capable design of the source has been used in a phase A study of a\nsatellite-to-satellite QKD demonstration mission by the University of New South\nWales, Canberra. This mission study uses two 6U CubeSats in LEO and aims to\ndemonstrate QKD over separations of increasing distances as the two CubeSats\ndrift apart.\n", "  Using the large data sample accumulated by the Belle experiment at KEKB\nasymmetry energy $e^+e^-$ Collider, we report the preliminary measurements of\nthe branching fractions of the radiative decays $D^0 \\rightarrow V\\gamma$,\nwhere $V$ = $\\phi,\\bar{K^*}^0, \\rho^0$. This is the first observation of the\ndecay $D^0 \\rightarrow \\rho^0\\gamma$ and also present the preliminary results\nof the first measurement of $CP$ asymmetry in these decays. We present the\npreliminary result of the $CP$ asymmetry of the $D^0 \\rightarrow K^0_S K^0_S$\ndecay, which is consistent with no $CP$ violation and improves the uncertainty\nwith respect to the previous measurement of this quantity by more than a factor\nof three. Finally, we present the results of the rare charm decay $D^0\n\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$, resulting in the most restrictive upper limit to\ndate.\n", "  The electron band structure of graphene on SrTiO3 substrate has been\ninvestigated as a function of temperature. The high-resolution angle-resolved\nphotoemission study reveals that the spectral width at Fermi energy and the\nFermi velocity of graphene on SrTiO3 are comparable to those of graphene on a\nBN substrate. Near the charge neutrality, the energy-momentum dispersion of\ngraphene exhibits a strong deviation from the well-known linearity, which is\nmagnified as temperature decreases. Such modification resembles the\ncharacteristics of enhanced electron-electron interaction. Our results not only\nsuggest that SrTiO3 can be a plausible candidate as a substrate material for\napplications in graphene-based electronics, but also provide a possible route\ntowards the realization of a new type of strongly correlated electron phases in\nthe prototypical two-dimensional system via the manipulation of temperature and\na proper choice of dielectric substrates.\n", "  Recently, Iseni (arXiv:1709.03109v1) reported measurements and analysis of\nelectric field (EF) strengths adjacent to propagating ionization waves (IWs) in\nnon-thermal atmospheric pressure He plasma jets. We demonstrate that these\nmeasurements are in error due to an improperly aligned electric field probe.\n", "  Grain boundaries (GBs) can be used as traps for solute atoms and defects, and\nthe interaction between segregants and GBs is crucial for understanding the\nproperties of nanocrystalline materials. In this study, we have systematically\ninvestigated the tendency of Pt to segregate as well as the interaction between\nPt and oxygen vacancies at the sigma 3/(111) GB of ceria (CeO2). The Pt atom\nhas a stronger tendency to segregate to the sigma 3/(111) GB than to the (111)\nand (110) free-standing surfaces, but the tendency is weaker than to the (100)\nfree-standing surface. Mechanic contributions (lattice distortion) play a\ndominant role in the strong tendency of Pt to segregate. At the\nPt-segregated-GB (Pt@GB), oxygen vacancies prefer to form spontaneously near Pt\nin the GB region. However, at the pristine GB (no Pt and no vacancies), oxygen\nvacancies form only under O-poor conditions. Thus, Pt segregation to the GB\npromotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, and their strong interactions\nenhance the interfacial cohesion. We propose that GBs fabricated close to the\nsurfaces of nanocrystalline ceria can trap Pt from the bulk or other types of\nsurface, resulting in the suppression of the accumulation of Pt on the surface\nunder redox reactions, especially under O-poor conditions.\n", "  This paper presents a large amount of observations for the $\\delta$ Scuti\nstar AN Lyncis carried out in 2001--2012. The extensive observations include\ntwo tri-continent campaigns coordinated in 2002 and 2011, respectively, and\nseveral single-site contributions throughout the period. The data in total have\nmore than 104100 raw CCD frames and photoelectric records, which consist of 165\nnights (about 816 hours) spanning over 3778 days. The final reduced light\ncurves have more than 26500 data points (including those 3462 unpublished BYU\ndata), from which we determined 306 new timings of maximum light. A\ntime-dependent behaviour study based on all available data indicates cyclic\namplitude variability as well as period change [for the main periodicity].\nOrbital sinusoid fittings to $(O-C)$ residuals and pulsation amplitudes may\naccount for their variations being caused by the light-time effect of AN Lyn in\na binary system. The orbital period is about 26--30 years. Current results\nsupport the binarity of AN Lyn, first suspected by Zhou (2002). We further show\nthe detailed time evolution structure of the pulsation of AN Lyn as function of\nboth time and period through wavelet analyses.\n", "  The onset of viscous fingering in the presence of a non monotonic viscosity\nprofile is investigated theoretically for two immiscible fluids. Classical\nfluid dynamics predicts that no unstable behavior may be observed when a\nviscous fluid pushes a less viscous one in a Hele-Shaw cell. Here, we show that\nthe presence of a viscosity gradient at the interface between both fluids\ndestabilize the interface facilitating the spread of the perturbation. The\ninfluence of the viscosity gradient on the dispersion relation is analyzed.\n", "  Using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach, where the\ncondensate is coupled with the thermal cloud and the anomalous density, we\nstudy the equilibrium and the dynamical properties of three-dimensional\nquantum-degenerate Bose gas at finite temperature. Effects of the anomalous\ncorrelations on the condensed fraction and the critical temperature are\ndiscussed. In uniform Bose gas, useful expressions for the Bogoliubov\nexcitations spectrum, the first and second sound, the condensate depletion and\nthe superfluid fraction are derived. Our results are tested by comparing the\nfindings computed by Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We present also a\nsystematic investigation of the collective modes of a Bose condensate confined\nin an external trap. Our predictions are in qualitative agreement with previous\nexperimental and theoretical results. We show in particular that our theory is\ncapable of explaining the so-called anomalous behavior of the m=0 mode.\n", "  The flavour changing neutral current decays can be interesting probes for\nsearching for New Physics. Angular distributions of the decay $\\mathrm{B}^0 \\to\n\\mathrm{K}^{*0} \\mu^ +\\mu^-$ are studied using a sample of proton-proton\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 8~\\mathrm{TeV}$ collected with the CMS detector at\nthe LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $20.5~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.\nAn angular analysis is performed to determine $P_1$ and $P_5'$, where $P_5'$ is\nof particular interest due to recent measurements that indicate a potential\ndiscrepancy with the standard model. Based on a sample of 1397 signal events,\n$P_1$ and $P_5'$ angular parameters are determined as a function of the dimuon\ninvariant mass squared. The measurements are in agreement with standard model\npredictions.\n", "  Persistent Lagrangian transport patterns at the ocean surface are revealed\nfrom Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) computed from daily climatological\nsurface current velocities in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico (NWGoM). The\nvelocities are produced by a submesoscale permitting regional ocean model of\nthe Gulf of Mexico. The significance of the climatological LCSs (cLCSs) is\nsupported with ensemble-mean drifter density evolutions from simulated and\nhistorical satellite-tracked drifter trajectories. A persistent attracting\nbarrier between the NWGoM shelf and the deep ocean is effectively identified by\na hook-like pattern associated with groups of overall strongly attracting cLCSs\nthat extend along the shelf break. Localized reductions in the attraction rate\nalong these overall strongly attracting cLCSs proximal to cross-shore oriented\ncLCSs identify a pathway for potential transport across the shelf break. Groups\nof overall weakly-attracting cLCSs are not seen to strongly constrain material\ntransport. Tracers originating over the shelf tend to be trapped there by the\nhook-like pattern as they spread cyclonically. Tracers originating beyond the\nshelf tend to be initially attracted to the hook-like pattern as they spread\nanti-cyclonically and eventually over the deep ocean. The findings have\nimportant implications for the mitigation of contaminant accidents such as oil\nspills.\n", "  The results of chaos simulations in Josephson Fluxonic Diode (JFD) subject to\nthe magnetic field, rf driving and dc biasing currents in the RCSJ model are\nreported. The dynamic behavior of this nonlinear device is mapped as a function\nof loss, bias, frequency and amplitude of rf excitation which leads to find\nsustainable fluxon oscillation regions in microwave application. As a result,\nchaos does not happen if either the dc bias or the rf excitation is below\nspecific value, but the loss term can change this state without affected by rf\nfrequency. An attempt is made to explain the boundaries of the chaotic region\nin terms of parameter maps.\n", "  We propose quantum protection circuit (quantum lock), based on dark states of\nensembles of two-level atoms in optical cavity. The secret key is the splitting\nof atoms into pairs, and publicly accessible part of the lock is the tensor\nproduct of EPR singlets, corresponding to the given splitting. To open the lock\none must move synchronously pairs of atoms from the correct splitting to the\nother cavity; the lock will open if atoms do not emit photons. This scheme has\nperfect secrecy: it is impossible to hack it, even with effective solutions of\nany classical computational problems, in contrast to the RSA scheme. The method\nof obtaining dark states through Stark shift of atomic excitation energy is\nalso proposed. This scheme makes possible to create secret keys of a few tens\nof atoms that is sufficient for the most practical applications.\n", "  Sedimentation in active fluids has come into focus due to the ubiquity of\nswimming micro-organisms in natural and artificial environments. Here, we\nexperimentally investigate sedimentation of passive particles in water\ncontaining various concentrations of the bacterium E. coli. Results show that\nthe presence of living bacteria reduces the velocity of the sedimentation front\neven in the dilute regime, where the sedimentation velocity is expected to be\nindependent of particle concentration. Bacteria increase the effective\ndiffusion coefficient of the passive particles, which determines the width of\nthe sedimentation front. For higher bacteria concentration, we find the\ndevelopment of two sedimentation fronts due to bacterial death. A model in\nwhich an advection-diffusion equation describing the settling of particles\nunder gravity is coupled to the population dynamics of the bacteria seems to\ncapture the experimental trends relatively well.\n", "  This paper summarises a few selected topics discussed during Working Group 5\nof the Deep Inelastic Scattering 2017 conference, Physics with Heavy Flavours,\nrelated to the study of charm, bottom, and top quark physics. While the\nprogramme of this Working Group was structured by thematic areas, this\nconference was the occasion for intense cross-pollination between traditionally\ndisjoint research lines. The four LHC experiments all contribute to\nheavy-flavour physics, with some degree of overlap in most areas, while\nexperiments at other accelerators provide vital input in complimentary\nkinematic regions. Theorists now have the possibility to take inputs from more\nsources, and experimentalists focus on measurements that maximise utility. The\ninterplay of LHC heavy quark cross-section measurements with DIS expertise is\ngreatly improving PDF precision, leading to much improved models that, amongst\nother things, better inform the prospects for future colliders.\n", "  Graph theory provides a language for studying the structure of relations, and\nit is often used to study interactions over time too. However, it poorly\ncaptures the both temporal and structural nature of interactions, that calls\nfor a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts in order\nto cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary\nconcepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced\nconcepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected\ncomponents. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time,\nsimilar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This\nformalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are\npreserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special\ncases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher-level\nobjects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This\npaper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous\nlinks, and extensions to more complex cases.\n", "  The current generation of ground-based coronagraphic instruments uses\ndeformable mirrors to correct for phase errors and to improve contrast levels\nat small angular separations. Improving these techniques, several space and\nground based instruments are currently developed using two deformable mirrors\nto correct for both phase and amplitude errors. However, as wavefront control\ntechniques improve, more complex telescope pupil geome- tries (support\nstructures, segmentation) will soon be a limiting factor for these next\ngeneration coronagraphic instruments. In this paper we discuss fundamental\nlimits associated with wavefront control with deformable mirrors in high\ncontrast coronagraph. We start with an analytic prescription of wavefront\nerrors, along with their wave- length dependence, and propagate them through\ncoronagraph models. We then consider a few wavefront control architectures,\nnumber of deformable mirrors and their placement in the optical train of the\ninstrument, and algorithms that can be used to cancel the starlight scattered\nby these wavefront errors over a finite bandpass. For each configuration we\nderive the residual contrast as a function of bandwidth and of the properties\nof the incoming wavefront. This result has consequences when setting the\nwavefront requirements, along with the wavefront control architecture of future\nhigh contrast instrument both from the ground and from space. In particular we\nshow that these limits can severely affect the effective Outer Working Angle\nthat can be achieved by a given coronagraph instrument.\n", "  We have carried out a density functional theory study on the structures of\nDMSO clusters and analysed the structure and their stability using molecular\nelectrostatic potential and quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules (QTAIM). The\nground state geometry of the DMSO clusters, prefer to exist in ouroboros shape.\nPair wise interaction energy calculation show the interaction between methyl\ngroups of adjacent DMSO molecules and a destabilization is is created by the\nmethyl groups which are away from each other. Molecular electrostatic potential\nanalysis shows the existence of hole on the odd numbered clusters, which helps\nin their highly directional growth. QTAIM analysis show the existence of two\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds, of type SOC hydrogen bonds and methyl CHC\ndihydrogen bonds. The computed and Laplacian values were all positive for the\nintermolecular bonds, supporting the existence of noncovalent interactions. The\ncomputed ellipticity for the dihydrogen bonds have values > 2, which confirms\nthe delocalization of electron, are mainly due to the hydrogen-hydrogen\ninteractions of methyl groups. A plot of total hydrogen bonding energy vs the\nobserved total local electron density shows linearity with correlation\ncoefficient of near unity, which indicates the cooperative effects of\nintermolecular dihydrogen HH bonds.\n", "  The freezing of concentrated colloidal suspensions is a complex physical\nprocess involving a large number of parameters. These parameters provide unique\ntools to manipulate the architecture of freeze-cast materials at multiple\nlength scales in a single processing step. However, we are still far from\ndeveloping predictive models to describe the growth of ice crystals in\nconcentrated particle slurries. In order to exert reliable control over the\nmicrostructural formation of freeze-cast materials, it is necessary to reach a\ndeeper understanding of the basic relationships between the experimental\nconditions and the microstructure of the growing solid. In this work, we\nexplore the role of several processing variables (e.g., composition of the\nsuspension, freezing rate, and patterning of the freezing surface) that could\naffect the formulation strategies for the architectural manipulation of\nfreeze-cast materials. We also demonstrate, using freeze-cast lamellar\nstructures, how reducing the lamellar thickness by less than half increases\ncompressive strength by more than one order of magnitude.\n", "  In a complete sample of local 14-195 keV selected AGNs and inactive galaxies,\nmatched by their host galaxy properties, we study the spatially resolved\nstellar kinematics and luminosity distributions at near-infrared wavelengths on\nscales of 10-150 pc, using SINFONI on the VLT. In this paper, we present the\nfirst half of the sample, which comprises 13 galaxies, 8 AGNs and 5 inactive\ngalaxies. The stellar velocity fields show a disk-like rotating pattern, for\nwhich the kinematic position angle is in agreement with the photometric\nposition angle obtained from large scale images. For this set of galaxies, the\nstellar surface brightness of the inactive galaxy sample is generally\ncomparable to the matched sample of AGN but extends to lower surface\nbrightness. After removal of the bulge contribution, we find a nuclear stellar\nlight excess with an extended nuclear disk structure, and which exhibits a\nsize-luminosity relation. While we expect the excess luminosity to be\nassociated with a dynamically cooler young stellar population, we do not\ntypically see a matching drop in dispersion. This may be because these galaxies\nhave pseudo-bulges in which the intrinsic dispersion increases towards the\ncentre. And although the young stars may have an impact in the observed\nkinematics, their fraction is too small to dominate over the bulge and\ncompensate the increase in dispersion at small radii, so no dispersion drop is\nseen. Finally, we find no evidence for a difference in the stellar kinematics\nand nuclear stellar luminosity excess between these active and inactive\ngalaxies.\n", "  Short range correlations of identified charged hadrons in pp ($\\sqrt{s} =$\n0.9, 2.76, and 7 TeV), pPb ($\\sqrt{s_{_\\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 5.02 TeV), and\nperipheral PbPb collisions ($\\sqrt{s_{_\\mathrm{NN}}} =$ 2.76 TeV) are studied\nwith the CMS detector at the LHC. Charged pions, kaons, and protons at low\nmomentum and in laboratory pseudorapidity $|\\eta| < 1$ are identified via their\nenergy loss in the silicon tracker. The two-particle correlation functions show\neffects of quantum statistics, Coulomb interaction, and also indicate the role\nof multi-body resonance decays and mini-jets. The characteristics of the one-,\ntwo-, and three-dimensional correlation functions are studied as a function of\ntransverse pair momentum, $k_\\text{T}$, and the charged-particle multiplicity\nof the event. The extracted radii are in the range 1-5 fm, reaching highest\nvalues for very high multiplicity pPb, also for similar multiplicity PbPb\ncollisions, and decrease with increasing $k_\\text{T}$. The dependence of radii\non multiplicity and $k_\\text{T}$ largely factorizes and appears to be\ninsensitive to the type of the colliding system and center-of-mass energy.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate a new algorithm for sparse prestack azimuthal\nAVO inversion. A novel Euclidean prior model is developed to at once respect\nsparseness in the layered earth and smoothness in the model of reflectivity.\nRecognizing that methods of artificial intelligence and Bayesian computation\nare finding an every increasing role in augmenting the process of\ninterpretation and analysis of geophysical data, we derive a generalized\nmatrix-variate model of reflectivity in terms of orthogonal basis functions,\nsubject to sparse constraints. This supports a direct application of machine\nlearning methods, in a way that can be mapped back onto the physical principles\nknown to govern reflection seismology. As a demonstration we present an\napplication of these methods to the Marcellus shale. Attributes extracted using\nthe azimuthal inversion are clustered using an unsupervised learning algorithm.\nInterpretation of the clusters is performed in the context of the Ruger model\nof azimuthal AVO.\n", "  We present a solution of the DGLAP evolution equations, written in terms of\nSudakov form factors to describe the branching and no-branching probabilities,\nusing a parton branching Monte Carlo method. We demonstrate numerically that\nthis method reproduces the semi-analytical solutions. We show how this method\ncan be used to determine Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) parton\ndistribution functions, in addition to the usual integrated parton\ndistributions functions. We discuss numerical effects of the boundary of soft\ngluon resolution scale parameter on the resulting parton distribution\nfunctions. We show that a very good fit of the integrated TMDs to high\nprecision HERA data can be obtained over a large range in x and Q^2.\n", "  We present a geochemical dataset acquired during continual sampling over 7\nmonths (bi-weekly) and 4 weeks (every 8 hours) in the Neuwied Basin, a part of\nthe East Eifel Volcanic Field (EEVF). We used a combination of geochemical,\ngeophysical, and statistical methods to identify potential causal processes\nunderlying the correlations of degassing patterns of four gases (He, Rn, CO2,\nO2), earth tides, and tectonic processes in three mineral springs (Nette,\nKaerlich and Kobern). We explored whether temporal relations in gas\nconcentrations in the three mineral springs could be indicators of hidden\nfaults through which the gases migrate to the surface from deeper underground.\nOur results do not confirm CO2 as a primary carrier gas for trace gases in all\nsprings. Temporal analyses of the CO2-He couple indicate that Nette and\nK\\\"arlich are directly linked via a continuous tectonic fault in an ENE-WSW\ntrending direction. There is also evidence that Kaerlich and Kobern (NNE-SSW\nfault system) and Nette and Kobern (NW-SE fault system) are tectonically\nlinked. These fault linkages are unknown previously but could be related to the\nrising numbers of earthquake events occurring in this area since 2010. We did\nnot find any evidence that weather processes (e.g., barometric pressure), earth\ntides, or low local earthquake magnitudes actively modulate degassing. The\nvolcanic activity in the EEVF is dormant but not extinct and to understand and\nmonitor its magmatic and degassing systems, we recommend bi-weekly samplings at\nminimum.\n", "  Cars can nowadays record several thousands of signals through the CAN bus\ntechnology and potentially provide real-time information on the car, the driver\nand the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a new method for the\nanalysis and classification of driver behavior using a selected subset of CAN\nbus signals, specifically gas pedal position, brake pedal pressure, steering\nwheel angle, steering wheel momentum, velocity, RPM, frontal and lateral\nacceleration. Data has been collected in a completely uncontrolled experiment,\nwhere 64 people drove 10 cars for or a total of over 2000 driving trips without\nany type of pre-determined driving instruction on a wide variety of road\nscenarios. We propose an unsupervised learning technique that clusters drivers\nin different groups, and offers a validation method to test the robustness of\nclustering in a wide range of experimental settings. The minimal amount of data\nneeded to preserve robust driver clustering is also computed. The presented\nstudy provides a new methodology for near-real-time classification of driver\nbehavior in uncontrolled environments.\n", "  The low dimensional periodic Klein-Gordon lattices are studied for\nintegrability. We prove that the periodic lattice with two particles and\ncertain nonlinear potential is non integrable. However, in the cases of up to\nsix particles, we prove that their Birkhoff-Gustavson normal forms are\nintegrable, which allows us to apply KAM theory.\n", "  The low-energy scattering of three bosons or distinguishable particles with\nshort-range interactions is characterized by a fundamental parameter, the\nthree-body scattering hypervolume. Its imaginary part is directly related to\nthe three-body recombination rate in a quantum gas consisting of such\nparticles. We derive an analytical formula of it for weak interactions, and\nperform its first numerical calculations for bosons with a variable\nnonzero-range potential. For attractive interactions, we identify several\nthree-body resonances at which the three-body scattering hypervolume becomes\ndivergent or anomalously large.\n", "  The many approaches that have been pursued in seeking an understanding of\nnuclear rotational dynamics are reviewed and reassessed with a view to their\ndevelopment in the light of recent progress and the research tools that are now\navailable. A motivation for this review is the widespread observation of\nnuclear shape coexistence and sequences of rotational states in all regions of\nthe nuclear periodic table combined with the recognition that the study of the\nrotational dynamics of quantum fluids has led to significant advances in the\nquantum theory of many-boson systems. Recent experimental investigations of the\nrotational dynamics of a low-temperature $^6$Li gas indicate that its slow\nrotational flows are likewise the irrotational flows of a superfluid. In this\ncontext, the dynamics of rotating nuclei are of fundamental interest because\nthe nucleus is a unique zero-temperature finite many-fermion quantum system. A\npromising approach is provided by algebraic mean-field theory which, as its\nname suggests, is a combination of algebraic and mean-field methods. Static\nmean-field theories play a central role in many-body theory by defining optimal\nindependent-particle and independent quasi-particle basis states for the\nquantum mechanics of many-fermion systems. Their time-dependent extensions also\nlead, in the small-amplitude random-phase approximation, to the quantisation of\nthe classical normal-mode vibrations of many-fermion systems about their static\nequilibrium states. This review shows that mean-field methods become\nsignificantly more powerful when combined with algebraic methods and an\nappropriate coupling scheme for the nuclear shell model.\n", "  The complex spectropolarimetric patterns around strong chromospheric lines,\nthe result of subtle spectroscopic and transport mechanisms, are sensitive,\nsometimes in unexpected ways, to the presence of magnetic fields in the\nchromosphere, which may be exploited for diagnostics. We apply numerical\npolarization radiative transfer implementing partially coherent scattering by\npolarized multi-term atoms, in the presence of arbitrary magnetic fields, in\nplaneparallel stellar atmospheres to study a few important spectroscopic\nfeatures: Mg II h-k doublet; Ca II H-K doublet and IR triplet. We confirm the\nimportance of partial redistribution effects in the formation of the Mg II h-k\ndoublet in magnetized atmospheres, as previously pointed out for the\nnon-magnetic case. Morevover, we show, numerically and analytically, that a\nmagnetic field produces measurable modications of the broadband linear\npolarization even for relatively small field strengths, while circular\npolarization remains well represented by the magnetograph formula. We note that\nthis phenomenon has already (unknowingly) been observed by UVSP/SMM, and the\ninterest and possibility of its observation in stars other than the Sun. The\ninterplay between partial redistribution in the H-K doublet of Ca II and\nmetastable level polarization in its IR triplet allow diagnosing the\nchromospheric magnetic field at different layers and strengths. Our results\nsuggest several new avenues to investigate empirically the magnetism of the\nsolar and stellar chromospheres.\n", "  We study supersymmetric AdS$_D$ backgrounds of eleven-dimensional or type II\nsupergravity preserving $\\mathcal{N}$ supersymmetries using generalised\ngeometry. We show that a large class correspond precisely to spaces admitting a\ngeneralised $G_{D,\\mathcal{N}}$ structure with a weak integrability condition,\nwhich we call \"weak generalised holonomy\". This class contains all such\nbackgrounds with odd $D$, but for even $D$ we must impose a technical\nassumption concerning the inner products of Killing spinors. It is known that\nall compact smooth solutions are included, though our analysis is purely local.\nWe show that the Killing superalgebras of such backgrounds are isomorphic to\nthe standard $\\mathcal{N}$-extended AdS$_D$ superalgebras, and give a geometric\nproof of the existence of isometries of the internal spaces which realise the\nAdS R-symmetry, as often assumed in explicit studies of such solutions.\n", "  We investigate the effects in the spectral properties of a massive Dirac\nsystem of the dynamical renormalization induce by disorder/impurity scattering\nwithin the self-consistent Born approximation. We show how that these effects\nleads to a remarkable closing of the bandgap edge. Above a critical value $U_c$\nof the impurity scattering the gap eventually closes, giving rise a finite\ndensity of states at zero energy. We show that the bandgap closing stems from\nthe quasi-particle dynamical renormalization and it is not associated with the\nvanishing of the effective massive term. Incoherent processes are fundamental\nto describe such physics.\n", "  Materials that are strong, ultra-light weight and tough are in demand for a\nrange of applications, requiring architectures and components carefully\ndesigned from the micrometer down to nanometer scales. Nacre-a structure found\nin many molluscan shells-and bone are frequently used as examples for how\nnature achieves this through hybrid organic-inorganic composites.\nUnfortunately, it has proven extremely difficult to transcribe nacre-like\nclever designs into synthetic materials, partly because their intricate\nstructures need to be replicated at several length scales. We demonstrate how\nthe physics of ice formation can be used to develop sophisticated porous and\nlayered-hybrid materials, including artificial bone, ceramic/metal composites,\nand porous scaffolds for osseous tissue regeneration with strengths up to four\ntimes higher than those currently used for implantation.\n", "  We prove near-tight concentration of measure for polynomial functions of the\nIsing model under high temperature. For any degree $d$, we show that a\ndegree-$d$ polynomial of a $n$-spin Ising model exhibits exponential tails that\nscale as $\\exp(-r^{2/d})$ at radius $r=\\tilde{\\Omega}_d(n^{d/2})$. Our\nconcentration radius is optimal up to logarithmic factors for constant $d$,\nimproving known results by polynomial factors in the number of spins. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of polynomial functions as statistics for testing the\nstrength of interactions in social networks in both synthetic and real world\ndata.\n", "  Coefficients of surface tension for even-even nuclei were estimated using its\ndependence of nuclear rigidity. The values of nuclear rigidity were obtained\nowing to its connection to mean squared deformations. The correlation of\nestimated surface tension coefficients with data on nuclear shapes was\nrevealed.\n", "  Quantum anomalous Hall state is expected to emerge in Dirac electron systems\nsuch as graphene under both sufficiently strong exchange and spin-orbit\ninteractions. In pristine graphene, neither interaction exists; however, both\ninteractions can be acquired by coupling graphene to a magnetic insulator (MI)\nas revealed by the anomalous Hall effect. Here, we show enhanced magnetic\nproximity coupling by sandwiching graphene between a ferrimagnetic insulator\nyttrium iron garnet (YIG) and hexagonal-boron nitride (h-BN) which also serves\nas a top gate dielectric. By sweeping the top-gate voltage, we observe Fermi\nlevel-dependent anomalous Hall conductance. As the Dirac point is approached\nfrom both electron and hole sides, the anomalous Hall conductance reaches 1/4\nof the quantum anomalous Hall conductance 2e2/h. The exchange coupling strength\nis determined to be as high as 27 meV from the transition temperature of the\ninduced magnetic phase. YIG/graphene/h-BN is an excellent heterostructure for\ndemonstrating proximity-induced interactions in two-dimensional electron\nsystems.\n", "  Although the final observations of the Spitzer Warm Mission are currently\nscheduled for March 2019, it can continue operations through the end of the\ndecade with no loss of photometric precision. As we will show, there is a\nstrong science case for extending the current Warm Mission to December 2020.\nSpitzer has already made major impacts in the fields of exoplanets (including\nmicrolensing events), characterizing near Earth objects, enhancing our\nknowledge of nearby stars and brown dwarfs, understanding the properties and\nstructure of our Milky Way galaxy, and deep wide-field extragalactic surveys to\nstudy galaxy birth and evolution. By extending Spitzer through 2020, it can\ncontinue to make ground-breaking discoveries in those fields, and provide\ncrucial support to the NASA flagship missions JWST and WFIRST, as well as the\nupcoming TESS mission, and it will complement ground-based observations by LSST\nand the new large telescopes of the next decade. This scientific program\naddresses NASA's Science Mission Directive's objectives in astrophysics, which\ninclude discovering how the universe works, exploring how it began and evolved,\nand searching for life on planets around other stars.\n", "  Freeze-casting, the templating of porous structure by the solidification of a\nsolvent, have seen a great deal of efforts during the last few years. Of\nparticular interest are the unique structure and properties exhibited by porous\nfreeze-casted ceramics, which opened new opportunities in the field of cellular\nceramics. The objective of this review is to provide a first understanding of\nthe process as of today, with particular attention being paid on the underlying\nprinciples of the structure formation mechanisms and the influence of\nprocessing parameters on the structure. This analysis highlights the current\nlimits of both the understanding and the control of the process. A few\nperspectives are given, with regards of the current achievements, interests and\nidentified issues.\n"]}
