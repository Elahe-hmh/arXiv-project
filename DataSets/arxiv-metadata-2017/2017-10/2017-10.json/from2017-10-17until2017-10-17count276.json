mantle is believed to be composed mainly of (Mg,Fe)SiO3\nperovskite, with lesser amounts of (Mg,Fe)O and CaSiO3). But it has not been\npossible to explain many unusual properties of the lowermost 150 km of the\nmantle (the D\" layer) with this mineralogy. Here, using ab initio simulations\nand high-pressure experiments, we show that at pressures and temperatures of\nthe D\" layer, MgSiO3 transforms from perovskite into a layered CaIrO3-type\npost-perovskite phase. The elastic properties of the post-perovskite phase and\nits stability field explain several observed puzzling properties of the D\"\nlayer: its seismic anisotropy, the strongly undulating shear-wave discontinuity\nat its top and possibly the anticorrelation between shear and bulk sound\nvelocities.\n", "  The post-perovskite phase of (Mg,Fe)SiO3 is believed to be the main mineral\nphase of the Earth's lowermost mantle (the D\" layer). Its properties explain\nnumerous geophysical observations associated with this layer - for example, the\nD'' discontinuity, its topography and seismic anisotropy within the layer. Here\nwe use a novel simulation technique, first-principles metadynamics, to identify\na family of low-energy polytypic stacking-fault structures intermediate between\nthe perovskite and post-perovskite phases. Metadynamics trajectories identify\nplane sliding involving the formation of stacking faults as the most favourable\npathway for the phase transition, and as a likely mechanism for plastic\ndeformation of perovskite and postperovskite. In particular, the predicted slip\nplanes are (010) for perovskite (consistent with experiment) and (110) for\npostperovskite (in contrast to the previously expected (010) slip planes).\nDominant slip planes define the lattice preferred orientation and elastic\nanisotropy of the texture. The (110) slip planes in post-perovskite require a\nmuch smaller degree of lattice preferred orientation to explain geophysical\nobservations of shear-wave anisotropy in the D\" layer.\n", "  We investigate Luttinger junctions of quantum wires away from criticality.\nThe one-body scattering matrix, corresponding to the off-critical boundary\nconditions at the junction, admits in general antibound and/or bound states.\nTheir contribution to the theory is fixed by causality. The presence/absence of\nbound states determines the existence of two different regimes with\ninequivalent physical properties. A scattering matrix without bound states\ndefines an isolated equilibrium system. Bound states instead drive the system\naway from equilibrium, giving raise to non-trivial incoming or outgoing energy\nflows in the junction. We derive in both regimes and in explicit form the\nelectromagnetic conductance tensor, pointing out the different impact of bound\nand antibound states.\n", "  A frame representation is used to derive a first order quasi-linear symmetric\nhyperbolic system for a scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. This\nprocedure is inspired by similar evolution equations introduced by Friedrich to\nstudy the Einstein-Euler system. The resulting evolution system is used to show\nthat small nonlinear perturbations of expanding\nFriedman-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker backgrounds, with scalar field potentials\nsatisfying certain future asymptotic conditions, decay exponentially to zero,\nin synchronous time.\n", "  Ordered states of matter are typically categorized by their broken\nsymmetries. With the ordering of spins in a ferromagnet or the freezing of a\nliquid into a solid, the loss of symmetry distinguishes the ordered state from\nthe disordered one. In contrast, topological states are distinguished by\nspecific \\textit{topological} properties that are encoded in their quantum\nmechanical wavefunctions. Frequently, a consequence of these properties is that\nthere are robust \"topologically protected\" states on the sample's boundaries.\nThe edge states of the quantum Hall effect (QHE) are the classic example. In\nthe last few years, it was realized that another class of such topological\nmatter may exist in 3D band insulators with large spin-orbit interaction. These\nso-called topological insulators are predicted to host robust surface states,\nwhich exhibit a number of interesting properties including spin helicity,\nimmunity to back-scattering, and weak \\textit{anti}--localization. There are\npredictions of a number of unusual phenomena associated with these surface\nstates, including a proximity-effect-induced exotic superconducting state with\nMajorana fermions bound to a vortex and an `axion' electromagnetic response,\nand proposals for applications, such as their use in terahertz devices. In this\nLetter we report the observation of an unprecedentedly large rotation of the\npolarization plane of linearly polarized light reflected from thin films of the\ntopological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ in magnetic fields. This Kerr rotation can\nbe as large as 65$^\\circ$ and is due almost entirely to the surface states. Our\nresults are evidence for the intrinsic response of the topologically protected\nsurface states and provide a benchmark for the large magneto-electric effect\npredicted for these materials.\n", "  Spectral properties of the Hamiltonian function which characterizes a trapped\nion are investigated. In order to study semiclassical dynamics of trapped ions,\ncoherent state orbits are introduced as sub-manifolds of the quantum state\nspace, with the K\\\"ahler structure induced by the transition probability. The\ntime dependent variational principle (TDVP) is applied on coherent states'\norbits. The Hamilton equations of motion on K\\\"ahler manifolds of the type of\nclassical phase spaces naturally arise. The associated classical Hamiltonian is\nobtained from the expected values on symplectic coherent states of the quantum\nHamiltonian. Spectral information is thus coded within the phase portrait. We\ndeal with the bosonic realization of the Lie algebra of the SU(1,1) group,\nwhich we particularize for the case of an ion confined in a combined, Paul and\nPenning trap. This formalism can be applied to Hamiltonians which are nonlinear\nin the infinitesimal generators of a dynamical symmetry group, such as the case\nof ions confined in electrodynamic traps. Discrete quasienergy spectra are\nobtained and the corresponding quasienergy states are explicitly realized as\ncoherent states parameterized by the stable solutions of the corresponding\nclassical equations of motion. A correspondence between quantum and classical\nstability domains is thus established, using the Husimi representation.\n", "  Water exists as two nuclear-spin isomers, para and ortho, determined by the\noverall spin of its two hydrogen nuclei. For isolated water molecules the\nconversion between these isomers is forbidden and they act as different\nmolecular species. Yet, these species are not readily separable, and little is\nknown about their specific physical and chemical properties, conversion\nmechanisms, or interactions. Here we demonstrate the production of isolated\nsamples of both spin isomers in pure beams of para and ortho water, with both\nspecies in their respective absolute ground state. These single-quantum-state\nsamples are ideal targets for unraveling spin-conversion mechanisms, for\nprecision spectroscopy and fundamental-symmetry-breaking studies, and for\nspin-enhanced applications, e. g., laboratory astrophysics and -chemistry or\nhypersensitized NMR experiments.\n", "  Distilling highly entangled quantum states from weaker ones is a process that\nis crucial for efficient and long-distance quantum communication, and has\nimplications for several other quantum information protocols. We introduce the\nnotion of distillation under limited resources, and specifically focus on the\nenergy constraint. The corresponding protocol, which we call the canonical\ndistillation of entanglement, naturally leads to the set of canonically\ndistillable states. We show that for non-interacting Hamiltonians, almost no\nstates are canonically distillable, while the situation can be drastically\ndifferent for interacting ones. Several paradigmatic Hamiltonians are\nconsidered for bipartite as well as multipartite canonical distillability. The\nresults have potential applications for practical quantum communication\ndevices.\n", "  We have developed an efficient numerical method to investigate light\nscattering from plasmonic nanospheres on a substrate covered by a shell, based\non the half-space Greens function approach. We use this method to study optical\nscattering from DNA molecules attached to metallic nanoparticles on a substrate\nand compare with experiment. We obtain fairly good agreement between\ntheoretical predictions and the measured ellipsometric spectra. The metallic\nnanoparticles were used to detect the binding with DNA molecules in a\nmicrofluidic setup via spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and a detectable change\nin ellipsometric spectra was found when DNA molecules are captured on Au\nnanoparticles surface. Our theoretical simulation indicates that the coverage\nof Au nanosphere by a submonolayer of DNA molecules, which is modeled by a thin\nlayer of dielectric material, can indeed lead to a small but detectable change\nin ellipsometric spectra. Our studies demonstrated the ultra-sensitive\ncapability of SE for sensing submonolayer coverage of DNA molecules on Au\nnanospheres.\n", "  We study the spectral flow of Landau-Robin hamiltonians in the exterior of a\ncompact domain with smooth boundary. This provides a method to study the\nspectrum of the exterior Landau-Robin hamiltonian's dependence on the choice of\nRobin data, even explaining the heuristics of how the spectrum of the Robin\nproblem asymptotically tends to the spectrum of the Dirichlet problem. The main\ntechnical result concerns the continuous dependence of Landau-Robin\nhamiltonians on the Robin data in the gap topology. The problem can be\nlocalized to the compact boundary where the asymptotic behavior of the spectral\nflow in some special cases can be described.\n", "  The ratio of the measured $\\bar B\\to D^{(*)}\\ell\\bar{\\nu}$ decay rates for\n$\\ell = \\tau$ vs. $e,\\mu$ deviate from the Standard Model (SM) by about\n$4\\sigma$. We show that the data are in tension with the SM, independent of\nform factor calculations, and we update the SM prediction for $\\mathcal{B}(B\\to\nX_c\\tau\\bar{\\nu}) / \\mathcal{B}(B\\to X_c \\ell\\bar{\\nu})$. We classify the\noperators that can accommodate the measured central values, as well as their UV\ncompletions. We identify models with leptoquark mediators that are minimally\nflavor violating in the quark sector, and are minimally flavor violating or\n$\\tau$-aligned in the lepton sector. We explore experimental signatures of\nthese scenarios, which are observable in the future at ATLAS/CMS, LHCb, or\nBelle II.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the mathematical modeling for the cosmological\nattractors propagated in mimetic gravity upon which an interacting dark\nenergy-dark matter is supposed to be existed. The average value of the\ninteraction of these percentages, namely $\\Gamma_i$ say, may be used to\ninvestigate generally the modeling of an attractor; the actual value could only\nbe determined by data in any particular case. We have seen, for example, that\nit was led to investigate the subject of initially invariant submanifolds.\n", "  By introducing concepts of beam shaping into quantum mechanics, we show how\ninterference effects of the quantum wavefunction describing multiple electrons\ncan exactly balance the repulsion among the electrons. With proper shaping of\nthe fermionic wavefunction, we propose non-diffracting quantum wavepackets of\nmultiple electrons that can also carry orbital angular momentum, in the form of\nmulti-electron non-diffracting vortex beams. The wavefunction is designed to\ncompensate for both the repulsion between electrons and for the\ndiffraction-broadening. This wavefunction shaping facilitates the use of\nelectron beams of higher current in numerous applications, thereby improving\nthe signal-to-noise-ratio in electron microscopy and related systems without\ncompromising on the spatial resolution. Our scheme potentially applies for any\nbeams of charged particles, such as protons, muons and ion beams.\n", "  We present a loss-gain equalized reconfigurable phaser for dynamic radio\nanalog signal processing (R-ASP). Such a phaser provides real-time tunable\ngroup delay response with all-pass transmission. We propose a lumped loss-gain\nimplementation, where tuning and equalization are mostly easily achieved. A\ntheoretical study derives the transfer function and the fundamental\ncharacteristics of the device. The phaser is finally experimentally\ndemonstrated, first using a single loss-gain pair and finally a three cascaded\nloss-gain pair structure with full reconfigurability , where up-chirp and\ndown-chirp group delays are shown for illustration. It is expected that this\nphaser will find wide applications in radio analog signal processing (R-ASP)\nsystems requiring dynamic adaptability.\n", "  We study the effect of long gradient modes on large scale observables. When\ndefined correctly, genuine observables should not only be gauge invariant but\nalso devoid of any gauge artifacts. One such gauge artifact is a pure gradient\nmode. Using the relativistic formulation of large scale observables, we confirm\nthat a long gradient mode which is still outside observer's horizon leaves no\nimprint on the large scale observables at first order. These include the cosmic\nrulers and the number counts. This confirms the existing method for\nrelativistically defined observables. The general relativistic bias relation\nfor the halos and galaxies is also invariant under the presence of a long\ngradient mode perturbation. The observed power spectrum is not affected by this\nlong mode.\n", "  The origin of non-thermal motions in massive star forming regions can be\nascribed to turbulence acting against the gravitational collapse, or to the\nself-gravity itself driving the rapid global collapse. The dependence between\nvelocity dispersion, radius and clouds surface density found by Heyer et al.\n(2009), $\\sigma/R^{1/2}\\propto \\Sigma^{1/2}$, has been interpreted in terms of\nglobal collapse of clouds. In this work we demonstrate that this relation is an\nexpression of a more general relation between accelerations. We introduce the\ngravo-turbulent acceleration, a$_k$, which describe the non-thermal motions in\neach region, and the acceleration generated by the gravitational field a$_G$,\nwhich is proportional to $\\Sigma$. We also introduce a new coefficient, the\nforce partition coefficient $\\alpha_{for}$ which is equivalent to the virial\nparameter but does not distinguish between collapsing and non-collapsing\nregions. In this work we use the a$_k$ - a$_G$ formalism in the analysis of a\nnew sample of 16 massive starless clumps (MSCls) combined with data from the\nliterature. We show that a$_k$ and a$_G$ are not independent. The non-thermal\nmotions in each region can originate from both local turbulence and\nself-gravity but overall the data in the a$_k$ vs. a$_G$ diagram demonstrate\nthat the majority of the non-thermal motions originate from self-gravity. We\nfurther show that all the MSCls with $\\Sigma\\geq 0.1$ g cm$^{-2}$ show signs of\ninfall motions, a strong indication that the denser regions are the first to\ncollapse. Finally, we include in the formalism the contribution of an external\npressure and the magnetic fields.\n", "  Along with high strength, plasticity is what makes metals so widely usable in\nour material world. Both strength and plasticity properties of a metal are\ndefined by the motion of dislocations - line defects in the crystal lattice\nthat divide areas of atomic planes displaced relative to each other by an\ninteratomic distance. Here we present first fully dynamic atomistic simulations\nof single crystal plasticity in metal tantalum predicting that above certain\nmaximum rate of straining - the ultimate limit - the dislocations can no longer\nrelieve mechanical loads and another mechanism, twinning, comes into play and\ntakes over as the dominant mode of dynamic response. At straining rates below\nthe ultimate limit, the metal attains a path-independent stationary state of\nplastic flow in which both flow stress and dislocation density remain constant\nindefinitely for as long as the straining conditions remain unchanged. In this\ndistinct state tantalum flows like a viscous fluid while still remaining a\nstrong and stiff metal.\n", "  Cohering power and de-cohering power have recently been proposed to quantify\nthe ability of a quantum operation to produce and erase coherence respectively.\nIn this paper, we investigate the properties of cohering power and de-cohering\npower. First, we prove the equivalence between two different kinds of cohering\npower for any quantum operation on single qubit systems, which implies that l1\nnorm of coherence is monotone under Maximally incoherent operation (MIO) and\nDephasing-covariant operation (DIO) in 2-dimensional space. In higher\ndimensions, however, we show that the monotonicity under MIO or DIO does not\nhold. Besides, we compare the set of quantum operations with zero cohering\npower with Maximally incoherent operation (MIO) and Incoherent operation (IO).\nMoreover, two different types of de-cohering power are defined and we find that\nthey are not equal in single qubit systems. Finally, we make a comparison\nbetween cohering power and de-cohering power for single qubit unitary\noperations and show that cohering power is always larger than decohering power.\n", "  Compatible finite elements provide a framework for preserving important\nstructures in equations of geophysical fluid dynamics, and are becoming\nimportant in their use for building atmosphere and ocean models. We survey the\napplication of compatible finite element spaces to geophysical fluid dynamics,\nincluding the application to the nonlinear rotating shallow water equations,\nand the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations. We summarise analytic\nresults about dispersion relations and conservation properties, and present new\nresults on approximation properties in three dimensions on the sphere, and on\nhydrostatic balance properties.\n", "  We propose a finite element discretisation approach for the incompressible\nEuler equations which mimics their geometric structure and their variational\nderivation. In particular, we derive a finite element method that arises from a\nnonholonomic variational principle and an appropriately defined Lagrangian,\nwhere finite element H(div) vector fields are identified with advection\noperators; this is the first successful extension of the structure-preserving\ndiscretisation of Pavlov et al. (2009) to the finite element setting. The\nresulting algorithm coincides with the energy-conserving scheme presented in\nGuzm\\'an et al. (2016). Through the variational derivation, we discover that it\nalso satisfies a discrete analogous of Kelvin's circulation theorem. Further,\nwe propose an upwind-stabilised version of the scheme which dissipates\nenstrophy whilst preserving energy conservation and the discrete Kelvin's\ntheorem. We prove error estimates for this version of the scheme, and we study\nits behaviour through numerical tests.\n", "  We report on transport features in heavily boron doped nanocrystalline\ndiamond (BNCD) films which are not seen in conventional (s-wave) granular\nsuperconductors. Observations include an anomalous resistance peak near to the\nsuperconducting transition temperature as well as a strong zero bias\nconductance peak in the current-voltage spectra. The effect of finite bias\ncurrent on the evolution of the resistance peak is systematically investigated\nin this system. The shape of the resistance-temperature curves near the\ncritical temperature is seen to be strongly influenced by both magnetic field\nand bias current. As the bias current is lowered the resistance peak becomes\nmore pronounced whereas when the magnetic field is varied the peak shifts\ntowards lower temperatures, the resistance upturn shows a quadratic temperature\ndependence as expected for a Kondo transition. We find that a number of\ntransport features such as resistance peak height, zero bias conduction peak\nheight and width as well as magnetoresistance peaks scale according to a power\nlaw dependence. We interpret these features as a result of a charge-Kondo\neffect where hole dopants act as degenerate Kondo impurities by opening\nadditional pseudo-spin scattering channels.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the quantum dynamics of two spin-1 systems,\n$\\vec{\\textbf{S}}_1$ and $\\vec{\\textbf{S}}_2$, adopting a generalized\n$(\\vec{\\textbf{S}}_1+\\vec{\\textbf{S}}_2)^2$-nonconserving Heisenberg model. We\nshow that, due to its symmetry property, the nine-dimensional dynamics of the\ntwo qutrits exactly decouples into the direct sum of two sub-dynamics living in\ntwo orthogonal four- and five-dimensional subspaces. Such a reduction is\nfurther strengthened by our central result consisting in the fact that in the\nfour-dimensional dynamically invariant subspace, the two qutrits quantum\ndynamics, with no approximations, is equivalent to that of two non interacting\nspin 1/2's. The interpretative advantages stemming from such a remarkable and\nnon-intuitive nesting are systematically exploited and various intriguing\nfeatures consequently emerging in the dynamics of the two qutrits are deeply\nscrutinised. The possibility of exploiting the dynamical reduction brought to\nlight in this paper for exactly treating as well time-dependent versions of our\nHamiltonian model is briefly discussed.\n", "  When two Landau levels are brought to a close coincidence between them and\nwith the chemical potential in the Integer Quantum Hall regime, the two Landau\nlevels can just cross or collapse while the external or pseudospin field that\ninduces the alignment changes. In this work, all possible crossings are\nanalyzed theoretically for the particular case of semiconductor trilayer\nsystems, using a variational Hartree-Fock approximation. The model includes\ntunneling between neighboring layers, bias, intra-layer and inter-layer Coulomb\ninteraction among the electrons. We have found that the general pseudospin\nanisotropy classification scheme used in bilayers applies also to the trilayer\nsituation, with the simple crossing corresponding to an easy-axis ferromagnetic\nanisotropy analogy, and the collapse case corresponding to an easy-plane\nferromagnetic analogy. An isotropic case is also possible, with the levels just\ncrossing or collapsing depending on the filling factor and the quantum numbers\nof the two nearby levels. While our results are valid for any integer filling\nfactor $\\nu$ (=1,2,3,...), we have analyzed in detail the crossings at $\\nu=3$\nand $4$, and we have given clear predictions that will help in their\nexperimental search. In particular, the present calculations suggest that by\nincreasing the bias, the trilayer system at these two filling factors can be\ndriven from an easy-plane anisotropy regime to an easy-axis regime, and then\ncan be driven back to the easy-plane regime. This kind of reentrant behavior is\nan unique feature of the trilayers, compared with the bilayers.\n", "  In this paper we consider the optimal discrimination of two mixed qubit\nstates for a measurement that allows a fixed rate of inconclusive\nresults(FRIR). Our strategy for the problem is to transform the FRIR of two\nqubit states into a minimum error discrimination for three qubit states by\nadding a specific quantum state $\\rho_{0}$ and a prior probability\n$q_{0}$(which we will call an inconclusive degree), which we name the modified\nFRIR problem. First, we investigate special inconclusive degrees $q_{0}^{(0)}$\nand $q_{0}^{(1)}$, which appear naturally in the modified FRIR problem and are\nthe beginning and the end of practical interval of inconclusive degree, and\nfind the analytic form of them. Next, we show that the modified FRIR problem\ncan be classified into two cases $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(0)}$(or $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(1)}$)\nand $q_{0}^{(0)}\\!<\\!q_{0}\\!<\\!q_{0}^{(1)}$. In fact, by maximum confidences of\ntwo qubit states and non-diagonal element of $\\rho_{0}$, the modified FRIR\nproblem is completely understood. Then, we provide an analytic solution of the\nFRIR problem when $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(0)}$(or $q_{0}=q_{0}^{(1)}$). However, when\n$q_{0}^{(0)}\\!<\\!q_{0}\\!<\\!q_{0}^{(1)}$, we rather supply the numerical method\nto find the solution, because of the complex relation between inconclusive\ndegree and corresponding failure probability. Finally we confirm our results\nusing previously known examples.\n", "  We introduce the concept of fermionic matrix product operators, and show that\nthey provide a natural representation of fermionic fusion tensor categories.\nThis allows for the classification of two dimensional fermionic topological\nphases in terms of matrix product operator algebras. Using this approach we\ngive a classification of fermionic symmetry protected topological phases with\nrespect to a group $G$ in terms of three cohomology groups:\n$H^1(G,\\mathbb{Z}_2)$, describing which matrix product operators are of\nMajorana type, $H^2(G,\\mathbb{Z}_2)$, describing the fermionic nature of the\nfusion tensors that arise when two matrix product operators are multiplied, and\nthe supercohomolgy group $\\bar{H}^3(G,U(1))$ which corresponds to the\nassociator that changes the order of fusion. We also generalize the tensor\nnetwork description of the string-net ground states to the fermionic setting,\nyielding simple representations of a class that includes the fermionic toric\ncode.\n", "  We study an implementation of the open GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse\nEngineering) algorithm well suited for large open quantum systems. While\ntypical implementations of optimal control algorithms for open quantum systems\nrely on explicit matrix exponential calculations, our implementation avoids\nthese operations leading to a polynomial speed-up of the open GRAPE algorithm\nin cases of interest. This speed-up, as well as the reduced memory requirements\nof our implementation, are illustrated by comparison to a standard\nimplementation of open GRAPE. As a practical example, we apply this open-system\noptimization method to active reset of a readout resonator in circuit QED. In\nthis problem, the shape of a microwave pulse is optimized such as to empty the\ncavity from measurement photons as fast as possible. Using our open GRAPE\nimplementation, we obtain pulse shapes leading to a reset time over four times\nfaster than passive reset.\n", "  We construct a family of exact solutions to Maxwell's equations in which the\npoints of zero intensity form knotted lines topologically equivalent to a given\nbut arbitrary algebraic link. These lines of zero intensity, more commonly\nreferred to as optical vortices, and their topology are preserved as time\nevolves and the fields have finite energy. To derive explicit expressions for\nthese new electromagnetic fields that satisfy the nullness property, we make\nuse of the Bateman variables for the Hopf field as well as complex polynomials\nin two variables whose zero sets give rise to algebraic links. The class of\nalgebraic links includes not only all torus knots and links thereof, but also\nmore intricate cable knots. While the unknot has been considered before, the\nsolutions presented here show that more general knotted structures can also\narise as optical vortices in exact solutions to Maxwell's equations.\n", "  A picosecond pulse generator based on a pair of step recovery diodes (SRD),\nleveraging the transient response of the SRD PN junction and controlling the\npulse width by a resistor, is proposed. We first explain the operation\nprinciple of the device, decomposing the pulse generation into different\nphases, and then demonstrate an experimental prototype with two different\nresistance, and hence pulse width, values.\n", "  In this study, we consider nonlinear interactions between components such as\ndark energy, dark, matter and radiation in the Friedman-Robertson-Walker\nspace-time framework and propose a simple interaction model based on time\nevolution of the densities of these components. By using this model we show\nthat these interactions can be given by Lotka-Volterra equation for suitable\nequation of state parameters. We numerically solve these coupling equations and\nshow that interaction dynamics between dark energy-dark matter-matter or dark\nenergy-dark matter-matter-radiation has a strange attractor for $0>w_{de}>-1$,\n$w_{dm}\\ge 0$, $w_{m}\\ge 0$ and $w_{r}\\ge 0$ values. These strange attractors\nwith the positive Lyapunov exponent clearly show that chaotic dynamics appears\nin time evolution of the densities. These results imply that the time evolution\nof the universe is chaotic in the presence of interactions between these\ncomponents. The present model may has potential to solve some cosmological\nproblems such as the singularity, cosmic coincidence, crunch, big rip, horizon,\noscillations, emergence of galaxies, and large scale organization of the\nuniverse. Model also connects between dynamics of the competing species in\nbiological systems and dynamics of the time evolution of the universe, and\noffers a new perspective and a different scenario for the universe evolution\nunlike well known popular models.\n", "  Preliminary results for mean negatively charged pion multiplicities $\\langle\n\\pi^- \\rangle$ using the $h^-$ method are presented for central Ar+Sc\ncollisions at 13, 19, 30, 40, 75 and 150\\textit{A} GeV/c beam momentum. The\ndata were recorded by the NA61/SHINE detector at the CERN SPS. Starting with\nrapidity distributions ${dn}/{dy}$ the procedure of obtaining total\nmultiplicities is presented. The mean number of wounded nucleons $\\langle\nW\\rangle$ extracted from the Glissando MC model is used to calculate the ratio\n$\\langle \\pi^- \\rangle/\\langle W\\rangle.$ The results are compared to those\nfrom other experiments and their dependence on colliding systems and collision\nenergy is discussed.\n", "  Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) possess metallic surface states\nprotected by crystalline symmetry, which are a versatile platform for exploring\ntopological phenomena and potential applications. However, progress in this\nfield has been hindered by the challenge to probe optical and transport\nproperties of the surface states owing to the presence of bulk carriers. Here\nwe report infrared (IR) reflectance measurements of a TCI, (001) oriented\n$Pb_{1-x}Sn_{x}Se$ in zero and high magnetic fields. We demonstrate that the\nfar-IR conductivity is unexpectedly dominated by the surface states as a result\nof their unique band structure and the consequent small IR penetration depth.\nMoreover, our experiments yield a surface mobility of 40000 $cm^{2}/(Vs)$,\nwhich is one of the highest reported values in topological materials,\nsuggesting the viability of surface-dominated conduction in thin TCI crystals.\nThese findings pave the way for exploring many exotic transport and optical\nphenomena and applications predicted for TCIs.\n", "  After recalling the definition of Grassmann algebra and elements of\nGrassmann--Berezin calculus, we use the expression of Pfaffians as Grassmann\nintegrals to generalize a series of formulas relating generating functions of\npaths in digraphs to Pfaffians. We start with the celebrated\nLindstr\\\"om-Gessel-Viennot formula, which we derive in the general case of a\ngraph with cycles. We then make further use of Grassmann algebraic tools to\nprove a generalization of the results of (Stembridge 1990). Our results, which\nare applicable to graphs with cycles, are formulated in terms of systems of\nnonintersecting paths and nonintersecting cycles in digraphs.\n", "  We introduce a novel simple algorithm for thermostatting path integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD) with the Langevin equation. The staging\ntransformation of path integral beads is employed for demonstration. The\noptimum friction coefficients for the staging modes in the free particle limit\nare used for all systems. In comparison to the path integral Langevin equation\n(PILE) thermostat, the new algorithm exploits a different order of splitting\nfor the phase space propagator associated to the Langevin equation. While the\nerror analysis is made for both algorithms, they are also employed in the PIMD\nsimulations of three realistic systems (the H2O molecule, liquid para-hydrogen,\nand liquid water) for comparison. It is shown that the new thermostat increases\nthe time interval of PIMD by a factor of 4~6 or more for achieving the same\naccuracy. In addition, supplemental material shows the error analysis made for\nthe algorithms when the normal-mode transformation of path integral beads is\nused.\n", "  We propose a new unified theoretical framework to construct equivalent\nrepresentations of the multi-state Hamiltonian operator and present several\napproaches for the mapping onto the Cartesian phase space. After mapping an\nF-dimensional Hamiltonian onto an F+1- dimensional space, creation and\nannihilation operators are defined such that the F+1 dimensional space is\ncomplete for any combined excitations. Commutation and anti-commutation\nrelations are then naturally derived, which show that the underlying degrees of\nfreedom are neither bosons nor fermions. This sets the scene for developing\nequivalent expressions of the Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics and\ntheir classical/semiclassical counterparts. Six mapping models are presented as\nexamples. The framework also offers a novel way to derive such as the\nwell-known Meyer-Miller model.\n", "  We introduce the isomorphism between the multi-state Hamiltonian and the\nsecond-quantized many-electron Hamiltonian (with only 1-electron interactions).\nThis suggests that all methods developed for the former can be employed for the\nlatter, and vice versa. The resonant level (Landauer) model for nonequilibrium\nquantum transport is used as a proof-of-concept example. Such as the classical\nmapping models for the multi-state Hamiltonian proposed in our previous work\n[J. Chem. Phys. (submitted)] lead to exact results for this model problem. We\nfurther demonstrate how these methods can also be applied to the\nsecond-quantized many-electron Hamiltonian even when 2-electron interactions\nare included.\n", "  We present analytical formulae for the Sommerfeld corrections to the\nannihilation of massive colored particles into quarks and gluons through the\nstrong interaction. These corrections are essential to accurately compute the\ndark matter relic density for coannihilation with colored partners. Our\nformulae allow to compute the Sommerfeld effect, not only for the lowest term\nin the angular momentum expansion of the amplitude, but for all orders in the\npartial wave expansion. In particular, we carefully account for the effects of\nthe spin of the annihilating particle on the symmetry of the two-particle wave\nfunction. This work focuses on strongly interacting particles of arbitrary spin\nin the triplet, sextet and octet color representations. For typical velocities\nduring freeze-out, we find that including Sommerfeld corrections on the\nnext-to-leading order partial wave leads to modifications of up to ten to\ntwenty percent on the total annihilation cross section. Complementary to QCD,\nwe generalize our results to particles charged under an arbitrary unbroken\nSU(N) gauge group, as encountered in dark glueball models. In connection with\nthis paper a Mathematica notebook is provided to compute the Sommerfeld\ncorrections for colored particles up to arbitrary order in the angular momentum\nexpansion.\n", "  We investigate in detail antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC)\nphases as well as their coexistence in the two-dimensional Kondo lattice model\non a square lattice, which is a paradigmatic model for heavy fermion materials.\nThe results presented are mainly obtained using the variational cluster\napproximation (VCA) and are complemented by analytical findings for the\nequations of motion of pairing susceptibilities. A particularly interesting\naspect is the possibility to have s-wave SC near half filling as reported by\nBodensiek \\textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{110}, 146406 (2013)]. When\ndoping the system, we identify three regions which correspond to an AF metallic\nphase with small Fermi surface at weak coupling, an AF metal with a different\nFermi surface topology at intermediate coupling, and a paramagnetic metal with\na large Fermi surface at strong coupling. The transition between these two AF\nphases is found to be discontinuous at lower fillings, but turns to a\ncontinuous one when approaching half-filling. In the quest for s-wave\nsuperconductivity, only solutions are found which possess mean-field character.\nNo true superconducting solutions caused by correlation effects are found in\nthe s-wave channel. In contrast, we clearly identify robust d-wave pairing away\nfrom half-filling. However, we show that only by treating antiferromagnetism\nand superconductivity on equal footing artificial superconducting solutions at\nhalf-filling can be avoided. Our VCA findings support scenarios previously\nidentified by variational Monte Carlo approaches and are a starting point for\nfuture investigations with VCA and further approaches such as cluster-embedding\nmethods.\n", "  Causal variational principles, which are the analytic core of the physical\ntheory of causal fermion systems, are found to have an underlying Hamiltonian\nstructure, giving a formulation of the dynamics in terms of physical fields in\nspace-time. After generalizing causal variational principles to a class of\nlower semi-continuous Lagrangians on a smooth, possibly non-compact manifold,\nthe corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are derived. In the first part, it\nis shown under additional smoothness assumptions that the space of solutions of\nthe Euler-Lagrange equations has the structure of a symplectic Fr\\'echet\nmanifold. The symplectic form is constructed as a surface layer integral which\nis shown to be invariant under the time evolution. In the second part, the\nresults and methods are extended to the non-smooth setting. The physical fields\ncorrespond to variations of the universal measure described infinitesimally by\none-jets. Evaluating the Euler-Lagrange equations weakly, we derive linearized\nfield equations for these jets. In the final part, our constructions and\nresults are illustrated in a detailed example on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,1} \\times S^1$\nwhere a local minimizer is given by a measure supported on a two-dimensional\nlattice.\n", "  The production cross-section of $J/\\psi$ pairs is measured using a data\nsample of $pp$ collisions collected by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-mass\nenergy of $\\sqrt{s} = 13 \\,{\\mathrm{TeV}}$, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of $279 \\pm 11 \\,{\\mathrm{pb^{-1}}}$. The measurement is performed\nfor $J/\\psi$ mesons with a transverse momentum of less than $10\n\\,{\\mathrm{GeV}}/c$ in the rapidity range $2.0<y<4.5$. The production\ncross-section is measured to be $15.2 \\pm 1.0 \\pm 0.9 \\,{\\mathrm{nb}}$. The\nfirst uncertainty is statistical, and the second is systematic. The\ndifferential cross-sections as functions of several kinematic variables of the\n$J/\\psi$ pair are measured and compared to theoretical predictions.\n", "  We study the bi-Hamiltonian structures for the hierarchy of a 3-component\ngeneralization of the Degasperis-Procesi (3-DP) equation. We show that all\nHamiltonian functionals in the hierarchy are homogenous, and Hamiltonian\nfunctionals of the hierarchy in the negative direction are local. We construct\ntwo different Liouville transformations by construct a reciprocal\ntransformation. The associated system for the first one is a reduction of a\nnegative flow in a modified Yajima-Oikawa hierarchy. The associated system for\nthe second one and the associated system for another 3-component CH type system\nunder a equivalent transformation are shown to be different reductions of a\nnegative generalized mKdV equation, besides the Hamiltonian structures of the\n3-DP equation under this Liouville transformation are considered. In addition,\nwe consider a limit for the 3-DP equation.\n", "  To explain the small neutrino masses, heavy Majorana neutrinos are introduced\nin the left-right twin Higgs model. The heavy neutrinos, together with the\ncharged scalars and the heavy gauge bosons, may contribute large mixings\nbetween the neutrinos and the charged leptons, which may induce some distinct\nlepton flavor violating processes. We will check the \\bar \\ell_i \\ell_j (i,j=\ne,\\mu,\\tau,i\\neq j) productions in the \\gamma\\gamma collision in the left-right\ntwin Higgs model, and find that the production rates may be large in some\nspecific parameter space, in the optimal cases even possible to be detected\nwith reasonable kinematical cuts. we have also shown that these collisions can\nconstrain effectively the model parameters such as the Higgs vacuum expectation\nvalue and the right-handed neutrino mass, etc., and may serve as a sensitive\nprobe of this new physics model.\n", "  The lack of open-source tools for hyperspectral data visualization and\nanalysiscreates a demand for new tools. In this paper we present the new\nPlanetServer,a set of tools comprising a web Geographic Information System\n(GIS) and arecently developed Python Application Programming Interface (API)\ncapableof visualizing and analyzing a wide variety of hyperspectral data from\ndifferentplanetary bodies. Current WebGIS open-source tools are evaluated in\norderto give an overview and contextualize how PlanetServer can help in this\nmat-ters. The web client is thoroughly described as well as the datasets\navailablein PlanetServer. Also, the Python API is described and exposed the\nreason ofits development. Two different examples of mineral characterization of\ndifferenthydrosilicates such as chlorites, prehnites and kaolinites in the Nili\nFossae areaon Mars are presented. As the obtained results show positive outcome\nin hyper-spectral analysis and visualization compared to previous literature,\nwe suggestusing the PlanetServer approach for such investigations.\n", "  Our paper is devoted to the oscillator semigroup, which can be defined as the\nset of operators whose kernels are centered Gaussian. Equivalently, they can be\ndefined as the the Weyl quantization of centered Gaussians. We use the Weyl\nsymbol as the main parametrization of this semigroup. We derive formulas for\nthe tracial and operator norm of the Weyl quantization of Gaussians. We\nidentify the subset of Gaussians, which we call quantum degenerate, where these\nnorms have a singularity.\n", "  Compared with conventional accelerators, laser plasma accelerators can\ngenerate high energy ions at a greatly reduced scale, due to their TV/m\nacceleration gradient. A compact laser plasma accelerator (CLAPA) has been\nbuilt at the Institute of Heavy Ion Physics at Peking University. It will be\nused for applied research like biological irradiation, astrophysics\nsimulations, etc. A beamline system with multiple quadrupoles and an analyzing\nmagnet for laser-accelerated ions is proposed here. Since laser-accelerated ion\nbeams have broad energy spectra and large angular divergence, the parameters\n(beam waist position in the Y direction, beam line layout, drift distance,\nmagnet angles etc.) of the beamline system are carefully designed and optimised\nto obtain a radially symmetric proton distribution at the irradiation platform.\nRequirements of energy selection and differences in focusing or defocusing in\napplication systems greatly influence the evolution of proton distributions.\nWith optimal parameters, radially symmetric proton distributions can be\nachieved and protons with different energy spread within 5% have similar\ntransverse areas at the experiment target.\n", "  Exclusive measurements of the quasi-free $pn \\to pp\\pi^-$ and $pp \\to\npp\\pi^0$ reactions have been performed by means of $pd$ collisions at $T_p$ =\n1.2 GeV using the WASA detector setup at COSY. Total and differential cross\nsections have been obtained covering the energy region $T_p = 0.95 - 1.3$ GeV\n($\\sqrt s$ = 2.3 - 2.46 GeV), which includes the regions of $\\Delta(1232)$,\n$N^*(1440)$ and $d^*(2380)$ resonance excitations. From these measurements the\nisoscalar single-pion production has been extracted, for which data existed so\nfar only below $T_p$ = 1 GeV. We observe a substantial increase of this cross\nsection above 1 GeV, which can be related to the Roper resonance $N^*(1440)$,\nthe strength of which shows up isolated from the $\\Delta$ resonance in the\nisoscalar $(N\\pi)_{I=0}$ invariant-mass spectrum. No evidence for a decay of\nthe dibaryon resonance $d^*(2380)$ into the isoscalar $(NN\\pi)_{I=0}$ channel\nis found. An upper limit of 180 $\\mu$b (90 $\\%$ C.L.) corresponding to a\nbranching ratio of 9 $\\%$ has been deduced.\n", "  We create a multi-partite entangled state by storing a single photon in a\ncrystal that contains many large atomic ensembles with distinct resonance\nfrequencies. The photon is re-emitted at a well-defined time due to an\ninterference effect analogous to multi-slit diffraction. We derive a lower\nbound for the number of entangled ensembles based on the contrast of the\ninterference and the single-photon character of the input, and we\nexperimentally demonstrate entanglement between over two hundred ensembles,\neach containing a billion atoms. In addition, we illustrate the fact that each\nindividual ensemble contains further entanglement. Our results are the first\ndemonstration of entanglement between many macroscopic systems in a solid and\nopen the door to creating even more complex entangled states.\n", "  In this note, we report about two, as it seems to us, rather unusual\nobservations made in molecular dynamics simulations of the single component\nsystems of particles interacting through the harmonic-repulsive pair potential\nin 3D. In particular, at some densities, we observed deeply supercooled liquid\nstates which did not exhibit crystallization in rather long MD runs. This\nobservation is unusual because usually liquids formed by particles of only one\ntype rather readily crystallize on supercooling. At a different value of the\ndensity we observed crystallization of the liquid into a state formed by chains\n(or lines) of particles which organize themselves into columns in such a way\nthat each column is formed by seven lines of particles. Alternatively, one can\nthink that each such column is formed by three alternating helical coils. In\nour view, it is possible that the overall structure that crystallizes from the\nliquid at this density is quasicrystalline. If it is indeed the case, then this\nobservation is unusual because, as far as we understand, it is not expected, at\npresent, that quasicrystalline structures can form in such a simple potential\nas harmonic-repulsive potential. Investigations related to the presumable phase\ndiagram of the particles interacting through the harmonic-repulsive potential\nhave been reported in [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 134}, 044903 (2011)]. Our results\nappear to be at odds with some of the results presented there.\n", "  We discuss a scheme in which sequential state-discrimination measurements are\nperformed on qudits to determine the quantum state in which they were initially\nprepared. The qudits belong to a set of nonorthogonal quantum states and hence\ncannot be distinguished with certainty. Unambiguous state discrimination allows\nerror-free measurements at the expense of occasionally failing to give a\nconclusive answer about the state of the qudit. Qudits have the potential to\ncarry more information per transmission than qubits. We considered the\nsituation in which Alice sends one of N qudits, where the dimension of the\nqudits is also N. We look at two cases, one in which the states all have the\nsame overlap and one in which the qudits are divided into two sets, with qudits\nin different sets having different overlaps. We also study the robustness of\nour scheme against a simple eavesdropping attack and found that by using qudits\nrather than qubits, there is a greater probability that an eavesdropper will\nintroduce errors and be detected.\n", "  Quantum Tunneling is ubiquitous across different fields, from quantum\nchemical reactions, and magnetic materials to quantum simulators and quantum\ncomputers. While simulating the real-time quantum dynamics of tunneling is\ninfeasible for high-dimensional systems, quantum tunneling also shows up in\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations that scale polynomially with system size.\nHere we extend a recent results obtained for quantum spin models {[{Phys. Rev.\nLett.} {\\bf 117}, 180402 (2016)]}, and study high-dimensional continuos\nvariable models for proton transfer reactions. We demonstrate that QMC\nsimulations efficiently recover ground state tunneling rates due to the\nexistence of an instanton path, which always connects the reactant state with\nthe product. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of\nquantum chemical reactions and quantum annealing, where quantum tunneling is\nexpected to be a valuable resource for solving combinatorial optimization\nproblems.\n", "  We consider in the paper axially-symmetric and stationary fields and\ncylindrically symmetric gravito-electromagnetic waves in the Nonsymmetric\nKaluza-Klein Theory.Using symbollic manipulations we write down all important\nquantities in the theory. We write field equations for both cases and partially\nintegrate them.We consider also a generalized Kerner-Wong-Kopczynski equation\nin GSW model.\n", "  We establish the equivalence between the loss of coherence due to mixing in a\nquantum system and the loss of information after performing a projective\nmeasurement. Subsequently, it is demonstrated that the quantum discord, a\nmeasure of correlation for the bipartite system $\\rho_{Alice\\leftarrow Bob}$,\nis identical to the minimum difference (over all projectors {|i><i|}) between\nlocal coherence (LQICC monotone) on Bob side and coherence of the reduced\ndensity matrix $\\rho^B$.\n", "  Due to the presence of strong correlations, theoretical or experimental\ninvestigations of quantum many-body systems belong to the most challenging\ntasks in modern physics. Stimulated by tensor networks, we propose a scheme of\nconstructing the few-body models that can be easily accessed by theoretical or\nexperimental means, to accurately capture the ground-state properties of\ninfinite many-body systems in higher dimensions. The general idea is to embed a\nsmall bulk of the infinite model in an \"entanglement bath\" so that the\nmany-body effects can be faithfully mimicked. The approach we propose is\nefficient, simple, flexible, sign-problem-free, and it directly accesses the\nthermodynamic limit. The numerical results of the spin models on honeycomb and\nsimple cubic lattices show that the ground-state properties including quantum\nphase transitions and the critical behaviors are accurately captured by only\n$\\mathcal{O}(10)$ physical and bath sites. Moreover, since the few-body\nHamiltonian only contains local interactions among a handful of sites, our work\nprovides new ways of studying the many-body phenomena in the infinite\nstrongly-correlated systems by mimicking them in the few-body experiments using\ncold atoms/ions, or developing novel quantum devices by utilizing the many-body\nfeatures.\n", "  Measurements are presented of W gamma gamma and Z gamma gamma production in\nproton-proton collisions. Fiducial cross sections are reported based on a data\nsample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.4 inverse femtobarns\ncollected with the CMS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. Signal is\nidentified through the W to l nu and Z to ll decay modes, where l is a muon or\nan electron. The production of W gamma gamma and Z gamma gamma, measured with\nsignificances of 2.6 and 5.9 standard deviations, respectively, is consistent\nwith standard model predictions. In addition, limits on anomalous quartic gauge\ncouplings in W gamma gamma production are determined in the context of a\ndimension-8 effective field theory.\n", "  In a unital C*-algebra with a faithful trace functional $\\tau$, the set\n$D_\\tau(A)$ of positive $\\rho\\in A$ of trace \\tau(\\rho)=1 is an algebraic\nanalogue of the space of density matrices (the set of all positive matrices of\na fixed dimension of unit trace). Motivated by the literature concerning the\nmetric properties of the space of density matrices, the present paper studies\nthe density space $D_\\tau(A)$ in terms of the Bures metric. Linear maps on A\nthat map $D_\\tau(A)$ back into itself are positive and trace preserving, hence,\nthey may be viewed as an algebraic analogue of a quantum channel, which are\nstudied intensely in the literature on quantum computing and quantum\ninformation theory.\n  The main results in this paper are: (i) to establish that the Bures metric is\nindeed a metric, (ii) to prove that channels induce nonexpansive maps of the\ndensity space $D_\\tau(A)$, (iii) to introduce and study channels on A that are\nlocally contractive maps (which we call Bures contractions) on the metric space\n$D_\\tau(A)$, and (iv) to analyse Bures contractions from the point of view of\nthe Frobenius theory of cone preserving linear maps.\n  Although the focus is on unital C*-algebras, an important class of examples\nis furnished by finite von Neumann algebras. Indeed, several of the C*-algebra\nresults are established by first proving them for finite von Neumann algebras\nand then proving them for C*-algebras by embedding a C*-algebra A into its\nenveloping von Neumann algebra $A^{**}$.\n", "  It has been shown that long-range {\\it p}-wave superconductivity in a Kitaev\nchain can be engineered via an ac field with a high frequency [Benito et al.,\nPhys. Rev. B 90, 205127 (2014)]. For its experimental realization, however,\ntheoretical understanding of Floquet engineering with a broader range of\ndriving frequencies becomes important. In this work, focusing on the ac-driven\ntunneling interactions of a Kitaev chain, we investigate effects from the\nleading correction to the high-frequency limit on the emergent {\\it p}-wave\nsuperconductivity. Importantly, we find new engineered long-range {\\it p}-wave\npairing interactions that can significantly alter the ones in the\nhigh-frequency limit at long interaction ranges. We also find that the leading\ncorrection additionally generates nearest-neighbor {\\it p}-wave pairing\ninteractions with a renormalized pairing energy, long-range tunneling\ninteractions, and in particular multiple pairs of Floquet Majorana edge states\nthat are destroyed in the high- frequency limit.\n", "  The topological Hall effect (THE) of electrons in skyrmion crystals is\nstrongly related to the quantum Hall effect (QHE) on lattices. This relation\nsuggests to revisit the QHE because its Hall conductivity can be\nunconventionally quantized. It exhibits a jump and changes sign abruptly if the\nFermi level crosses a van Hove singularity. In this Paper, we investigate the\nunconventional QHE features by discussing band structures, Hall conductivities,\nand topological edge states for square and triangular lattices; their origin\nare Chern numbers of bands in the skyrmion crystal (THE) or of the\ncorresponding Landau levels (QHE). Striking features in the energy dependence\nof the Hall conductivities are traced back to the band structure without\nmagnetic field whose properties are dictated by the lattice geometry. Based on\nthese findings, we derive an approximation that allows us to determine the\nenergy dependence of the topological Hall conductivity on any twodimensional\nlattice. The validity of this approximation is proven for the honeycomb\nlattice. We conclude that skyrmion crystals lend themselves for experiments to\nvalidate our findings for the THE and - indirectly - the QHE.\n", "  Despite their important applications in metrology and in spite of numerous\nexperimental demonstrations, weak measurements are still confusing for part of\nthe community. This sometimes leads to unjustified criticism. Recent papers\nhave experimentally clarified the meaning and practical significance of weak\nmeasurements, yet in [R.E. Kastner, Found. Phys. 47, 697-707 (2017)], Kastner\nseems to take us many years backwards in the debate, casting doubt on the very\nterm \"weak value\" and the meaning of weak measurements. Kastner appears to\nignore both the basics and frontiers of weak measurements and misinterprets the\nweak measurement process and its outcomes. In addition, she accuses the authors\nof [Y. Aharonov et al., Ann. Phys. 355, 258-268 (2015)] in statements\ncompletely opposite to the ones they have actually made. There are many points\nof disagreement between Kastner and us, but in this short reply I will leave\naside the ontology (which is indeed interpretational and far more complex than\nthat described by Kastner) and focus mainly on the injustice in her criticism.\nI shall add some general comments regarding the broader theory of weak\nmeasurements and the Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF), as well as supporting\nexperimental results. Finally, I will point out some recent promising results,\nwhich can be proven by (strong) projective measurements, without the need of\nemploying weak measurements.\n", "  In a previous work a novel parametrization was proposed for the $pp$ and\n$\\bar{p}p$ total cross section. Here, results are presented for analysis\nupdated with taken into account the recent data from accelerator experiments as\nwell as from cosmic ray measurements. The analytic parameterizations suggested\nwithin axiomatic quantum field theory (AQFT) provide the quantitative\ndescription of energy dependence of global scattering observables with robust\nvalues of fit parameters. Based on the fit results the estimations are derived\nfor the total cross section and the $\\rho$ parameter in elastic $pp$ scattering\nat various $\\sqrt{s}$ up to energy frontier $\\sqrt{s}=10$ PeV which can be\nuseful for present and future hadron colliders as well as for cosmic ray\nmeasurements at ultra-high energies.\n", "  We investigate theoretically and experimentally the evaporation of liquid\ndisks in the presence of natural convection due to a density difference between\nthe vapor and the surrounding gas. From the analogy between thermal convection\nabove a heated disk and our system, we derive scaling laws to describe the\nevaporation rate. The local evaporation rate depends on the presence of a\nboundary layer in the gas phase such that the total evaporation rate is given\nby a combination of different scaling contributions, which reflect the\nstructure of the boundary layer. We compare our theoretical predictions to\nexperiments performed with water in an environment controlled in humidity,\nwhich validate our approach.\n", "  In the presence of strong magnetic fields near pulsars, the QED vacuum\nbecomes a birefringent medium due to nonlinear QED interactions. Here, we\nexplore the impact of the effective photon-photon interaction on the\npolarization evolution of photons propagating through the magnetized QED vacuum\nof a pulsar. We solve the quantum Boltzmann equation within the framework of\nthe Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian to find the evolution of the Stokes parameters.\nWe find that linearly polarized X-ray photons propagating outward in the\nmagnetosphere of a rotating neutron star can acquire high values for the\ncircular polarization parameter. Meanwhile, it is shown that the polarization\ncharacteristics of photons besides photon energy depend strongly on parameters\nof the pulsars such as magnetic field strength, inclination angle and\nrotational period. Our results are clear predictions of QED vacuum polarization\neffects in the near vicinity of magnetic stars which can be tested with the\nupcoming X-ray polarimetric observations.\n", "  Compact modeling of inter-device radiation-induced leakage underneath the\ngateless thick STI oxide is presented and validated taking into account CMOS\ntechnology and hardness parameters, dose-rate and annealing effects, and\ndependence on electric modes under irradiation. It was shown that proposed\napproach can be applied for description of dose dependent static leakage\ncurrents in complex FPGA circuits.\n", "  A self-consistent procedure for the ion-induced soft error rate calculation\nin space environment taking into account Error Correcting Codes is proposed.\nThe method is based on the partitioning of the multiple cell events into groups\nwith different multiplicities. The proposed partitioning method has been\nvali-dated for the ground and on-orbit literature data.\n", "  The phase stabilities and ordering tendencies in the quaternary full-Heusler\nalloys NiCoMnAl and NiCoMnGa have been investigated by in-situ neutron\ndiffraction, calorimetry and magnetization measurements. NiCoMnGa was found to\nadopt the L2$_1$ structure, with distinct Mn and Ga sublattices but a common\nNi-Co sublattice. A second-order phase transition to the B2 phase with disorder\nalso between Mn and Ga was observed at 1160 K. In contrast, in NiCoMnAl slow\ncooling or low-temperature annealing treatments are required to induce\nincipient L2$_1$ ordering, otherwise the system displays only B2 order. Linked\nto this L2$_1$ ordering, a drastic increase in the magnetic transition\ntemperature was observed in NiCoMnAl, while annealing affected the magnetic\nbehavior of NiCoMnGa only weakly due to the low degree of quenched-in disorder.\nFirst principles calculations were employed to study the thermodynamics as well\nas order-dependent electronic properties of both compounds. It was found that a\nnear half-metallic pseudo-gap emerges in the minority spin channel only for the\ncompletely ordered Y structure, which however is energetically unstable\ncompared to the predicted ground state of a tetragonal structure with\nalternating layers of Ni and Co. The experimental inaccessibility of the\ntotally ordered structures is explained by kinetic limitations due to the low\nordering energies.\n", "  The quantitative composition of metal alloy nanowires on InSb(001)\nsemiconductor surface and gold nanostructures on germanium surface is\ndetermined by blind source separation (BSS) machine learning (ML) method using\nnon negative matrix factorization (NMF) from energy dispersive X-ray\nspectroscopy (EDX) spectrum image maps measured in a scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM). The BSS method blindly decomposes the collected EDX spectrum\nimage into three source components, which correspond directly to the X-ray\nsignals coming from the supported metal nanostructures, bulk semiconductor\nsignal and carbon background. The recovered quantitative composition is\nvalidated by detailed Monte Carlo simulations and is confirmed by separate\ncross-sectional TEM EDX measurements of the nanostructures. This shows that SEM\nEDX measurements together with machine learning blind source separation\nprocessing could be successfully used for the nanostructures quantitative\nchemical composition determination.\n", "  High temperature cuprate superconductivity remains a defining problem in\ncondensed matter physics. Among myriad approaches to addressing this problem\nhas been the study of alternative transition metal oxides with similar\nstructures and 3d electron count that are suggested as proxies for cuprate\nphysics. None of these analogs has been superconducting, and few are even\nmetallic. Here, we report that the low-valent, quasi-two-dimensional trilayer\ncompound, Pr4Ni3O8 avoids a charge-stripe ordered phase previously reported for\nLa4Ni3O8, leading to a metallic ground state. By combining x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we further find that\nmetallic Pr4Ni3O8 exhibits a low-spin configuration and significant orbital\npolarization of the unoccupied eg states with pronounced dx2-y2 character near\nthe Fermi energy, both hallmarks of the cuprate superconductors. Belonging to a\nregime of 3d electron count found for hole-doped cuprates, Pr4Ni3O8 thus\nrepresents one of the closest analogies to cuprates yet reported and a\nsingularly promising candidate for high-Tc superconductivity if appropriately\ndoped.\n", "  We report the first single crystal growth of the correlated metal LaNiO3\nusing a high-pressure optical-image floating zone furnace. The crystals were\nstudied using single crystal/powder x-ray diffraction, resistivity, specific\nheat, and magnetic susceptibility. The availability of bulk LaNiO3 crystals\nwill (i) promote deep understanding in this correlated material, including the\nmechanism of enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility, and (ii) provide rich\nopportunities as a substrate for thin film growth such as important\nferroelectric and/or multiferroic materials. This study demonstrates the power\nof high pO2 single crystal growth of nickelate perovskites and correlated\nelectron oxides more generally.\n", "  Given a Hilbert space, we investigate the well-posedness of the Cauchy\nproblem for the wave equation for operators with discrete non-negative spectrum\nacting on it. We consider the cases when the time-dependent propagation speed\nis regular, H\\\"older, and distributional. We also consider cases when it it is\nstrictly positive (strictly hyperbolic case) and when it is non-negative\n(weakly hyperbolic case). When the propagation speed is a distribution, we\nintroduce the notion of \"very weak solutions\" to the Cauchy problem. We show\nthat the Cauchy problem for the wave equation with the distributional\ncoefficient has a unique \"very weak solution\" in appropriate sense, which\ncoincides with classical or distributional solutions when the latter exist.\nExamples include the harmonic oscillator and the Landau Hamiltonian on $\\mathbb\nR^n$, uniformly elliptic operators of different orders on domains,\nH\\\"ormander's sums of squares on compact Lie groups and compact manifolds,\noperators on manifolds with boundary, and many others.\n", "  We show a unified second-order scheme for constructing simple, robust and\naccurate algorithms for typical thermostats for configurational sampling for\nthe canonical ensemble. When Langevin dynamics is used, the scheme leads to the\nBAOAB algorithm that has been recently investigated. We show that the scheme is\nalso useful for other types of thermostat, such as the Andersen thermostat and\nNos\\'e-Hoover chain. Two 1-dimensional models and three typical realistic\nmolecular systems that range from the gas phase, clusters, to the condensed\nphase are used in numerical examples for demonstration. Accuracy may be\nincreased by an order of magnitude for estimating coordinate-dependent\nproperties in molecular dynamics (when the same time interval is used),\nirrespective of which type of thermostat is applied. The scheme is especially\nuseful for path integral molecular dynamics, because it consistently improves\nthe efficiency for evaluating all thermodynamic properties for any type of\nthermostat.\n", "  Quantum harmonic analysis on phase space is shown to be linked with\nlocalization operators. The convolution between operators and the convolution\nbetween a function and an operator provide a conceptual framework for the\ntheory of localization operators which is complemented by an appropriate\nFourier transform, the Fourier-Wigner transform. We use Lieb's uncertainty\nprinciple to establish a sharp Hausdorff-Young inequality for the\nFourier-Wigner transform. Noncommutative Tauberian theorems due to Werner allow\nus to extend results of Bayer and Gr\\\"ochenig on localization operators.\nFurthermore we show that the Arveson spectrum and the theory of Banach modules\nprovide the abstract setting of quantum harmonic analysis.\n", "  Magnetization in rock samples is crucial for paleomagnetometry research, as\nit harbors valuable geological information on long term processes, such as\ntectonic movements and the formation of oceans and continents. Nevertheless,\ncurrent techniques are limited in their ability to measure high spatial\nresolution and high-sensitivity quantitative vectorial magnetic signatures from\nsuch samples. As a result, our understanding of this magnetization is limited,\nspecifically for the case of multi-domain samples. In this work we use a newly\ndeveloped nitrogen-vacancy magnetic microscope, capable of quantitative\nvectorial magnetic imaging with optical resolution. We demonstrate direct\nimaging of the vectorial magnetic field of a single, multi-domain dendrite, as\nwell as the measurement and calculation of the weak magnetic moments of\nindividual grains on the micron scale. These results pave the way for future\napplications in paleomagnetometry, and for the fundamental understanding of\nmagnetization in multi-domain samples.\n", "  Cavity optomechanics has proven to be a field of research rich with\npossibilities for studying motional cooling, squeezing, quantum entanglement\nand metrology in solid state systems. While to date most studies have focused\non the modulation of the cavity frequency by the moving element, the emergence\nof new materials will soon allow to explore the influences of nonlinear optical\neffects. We therefore study in this work the effects due to a nonlinear\nposition-modulated self-Kerr interaction and find that this leads to an\neffective coupling that scales with the square of the photon number, meaning\nthat significant effects appear even for very small nonlinearities. This strong\neffective coupling can lead to lower powers required for motional cooling and\nthe appearance of multi-stability in certain regimes.\n", "  By mapping the most advanced elements of the contemporary social\ninteractions, the world scientific collaboration network develops an extremely\ninvolved and heterogeneous organization. Selected characteristics of this\nheterogeneity are studied here and identified by focusing on the scientific\ncollaboration community of H. Eugene Stanley - one of the most prolific world\nscholars at the present time. Based on the Web of Science records as of March\n28, 2016, several variants of networks are constructed. It is found that the\nStanley #1 network - this in analogy to the Erd\\H{o}s # - develops a largely\nconsistent hierarchical organization and Stanley himself obeys rules of the\nsame hierarchy. However, this is seen exclusively in the weighted network\nrepresentation. When such a weighted network is evolving, an existing relevant\nmodel indicates that the spread of weight gets stimulation to the\nmultiplicative bursts over the neighbouring nodes, which leads to a balanced\ngrowth of interconnections among them. While not exclusive to Stanley, such a\nbehaviour is not a rule, however. Networks of other outstanding scholars\nstudied here more often develop a star-like form and the central hubs\nconstitute the outliers. This study is complemented by a spectral analysis of\nthe normalised Laplacian matrices derived from the weighted variants of the\ncorresponding networks and, among others, it points to the efficiency of such a\nprocedure for identifying the component communities and relations among them in\nthe complex weighted networks.\n", "  Had magnetic monopoles been ubiquitous as electrons are, we would probably\nhave had a different form of matter, and power plants based on currents of\nthese magnetic charges would have been a familiar scene of modern technology.\nMagnetic dipoles do exist, however, and in principle one could wonder if we can\nuse them to generate magnetic currents. In the present work, we address the\nissue of generating magnetic currents and magnetic thermal currents in\nelectrically-insulating low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets by invoking\nthe (broken) electricity-magnetism duality symmetry. The ground state of these\nmaterials is a spin-liquid state that can be described well via~the\nJordan--Wigner fermions, which permit an easy definition of the magnetic\nparticle and thermal currents. The magnetic and magnetic thermal conductivities\nare calculated in the present work using the bond--mean field theory. The\nspin-liquid states in these antiferromagnets are either gapless or gapped\nliquids of spinless fermions whose flow defines a current just as the one\ndefined for electrons in a Fermi liquid. The driving force for the magnetic\ncurrent is a magnetic field with a gradient along the magnetic conductor. We\npredict the generation of a magneto-motive force and realization of magnetic\ncircuits using low-dimensional Heisenberg antiferromagnets. The present work is\nalso about claiming that what the experiments in spintronics attempt to do is\ntrying to treat the magnetic degrees of freedoms on the same footing as the\nelectronic ones.\n", "  One of the most widely known building blocks of modern physics is\nHeisenberg's indeterminacy principle. Among the different statements of this\nfundamental property of the full quantum mechanical nature of physical reality,\nthe uncertainty relation for energy and time has a special place. Its\ninterpretation and its consequences have inspired continued research efforts\nfor almost a century. In its modern formulation, the uncertainty relation is\nunderstood as setting a fundamental bound on how fast any quantum system can\nevolve. In this Topical Review we describe important milestones, such as the\nMandelstam-Tamm and the Margolus-Levitin bounds on the quantum speed limit, and\nsummarise recent applications in a variety of current research fields --\nincluding quantum information theory, quantum computing, and quantum\nthermodynamics amongst several others. To bring order and to provide an access\npoint into the many different notions and concepts, we have grouped the various\napproaches into the minimal time approach and the geometric approach, where the\nformer relies on quantum control theory, and the latter arises from measuring\nthe distinguishability of quantum states. Due to the volume of the literature,\nthis Topical Review can only present a snapshot of the current state-of-the-art\nand can never be fully comprehensive. Therefore, we highlight but a few works\nhoping that our selection can serve as a representative starting point for the\ninterested reader.\n", "  High quality electrical contact to semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as $MoS_2$ is key to unlocking their unique\nelectronic and optoelectronic properties for fundamental research and device\napplications. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts reliable\nohmic contact to doped TMDCs remains elusive and would benefit from a better\nunderstanding of the underlying physics of the metal-TMDC interface. Here we\npresent measurements of the atomic-scale energy band diagram of junctions\nbetween various metals and heavily doped monolayer $MoS_2$ using ultra-high\nvacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM). Our measurements reveal that\nthe electronic properties of these junctions are dominated by 2D metal induced\ngap states (MIGS). These MIGS are characterized by a spatially growing measured\ngap in the local density of states (L-DOS) of the $MoS_2$ within 2 nm of the\nmetal-semiconductor interface. Their decay lengths extend from a minimum of\n~0.55 nm near mid gap to as long as 2 nm near the band edges and are nearly\nidentical for Au, Pd and graphite contacts, indicating that it is a universal\nproperty of the monolayer semiconductor. Our findings indicate that even in\nheavily doped semiconductors, the presence of MIGS sets the ultimate limit for\nelectrical contact.\n", "  Standard Leggett and Garg inequalities (SLGIs) were formulated for testing\nthe incompatibility between the classical worldview of macrorealism and quantum\nmechanics. In recent times, various other formulations, such as Wigner form of\nLGIs (WLGIs), entropic LGIs (ELGIs) and the no-signaling in time (NSIT)\ncondition have also been proposed. It is also recently argued that no set of\nSLGIs can provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for macrorealism but\na suitable conjunction of NSIT conditions provides the same. In this paper, we\nfirst provide a comparative study of the various formulations of LGIs for\ntesting macrorealism pertaining to the two different unsharp measurements.\nWhile the violations of WLGIs are more robust than SLGIs and ELGIs for\nspin-POVMs, here we demonstrate that for the case of biased POVMs, the quantum\nviolations of both SLGIs and ELGIs provide the same robustness as WLGIs.\nImportantly, the violations of all formulations of LGIs can be achieved for\n\\textit{any non-zero value} of unsharpness parameter. We have also studied the\nconnection between LGIs and NSIT conditions. Further, we investigate the role\nof the joint measurability of the POVMs in the violation of LGIs and found that\nthere is no generic connection.\n", "  In this work we develop an experimental procedure to interrogate the single-\nand multiphoton scattering matrices of an unknown quantum system interacting\nwith propagating photons. Our proposal requires coherent state laser or\nmicrowave inputs and homodyne detection at the scatterer's output, and provides\nsimultaneous information about multiple ---elastic and inelastic--- segments of\nthe scattering matrix. The method is resilient to detector noise and its errors\ncan be made arbitrarily small by combining experiments at various laser powers.\nFinally, we show that the tomography of scattering has to be performed using\npulsed lasers to efficiently gather information about the nonlinear processes\nin the scatterer.\n", "  We simulate anisotropic thermal conduction between the intracluster medium\n(ICM) and the hot coronal interstellar medium (ISM) gas in cluster galaxies. In\nthe earlier Paper I (Vijayaraghavan & Sarazin 2017a), we simulated the\nevaporation of the hot ISM due to isotropic (possibly saturated) conduction\nbetween the ISM and ICM. We found that hot coronae evaporate on $\\sim 10^2$ Myr\ntimescales, significantly shorter than the $\\sim 10^3$ Myr gas loss times due\nto ram pressure stripping. No tails of stripped gas are formed. This is in\ntension with the observed ubiquity and implied longevity of compact X-ray\ncoronae and stripped ISM tails, and requires the suppression of evaporation,\npossibly due to magnetic fields and anisotropic conduction. We perform a series\nof wind tunnel simulations similar to Paper I, now including ISM and ICM\nmagnetic fields. We simulate the effect of anisotropic conduction for a range\nof extreme magnetic field configurations: parallel and perpendicular to the ICM\nwind, and continuous and completely disjoint between the ISM and ICM. We find\nthat when conduction is anisotropic, gas loss due to evaporation is severely\nreduced; the overall gas loss rates with and without anisotropic conduction do\nnot differ by more than $10 - 20\\%$. Magnetic fields also prevent stripped\ntails from evaporating in the ICM by shielding, and providing few pathways for\nheat transport between the ICM and ISM. The morphology of stripped tails and\nmagnetic fields in the tails and wakes of galaxies are sensitive to the initial\nmagnetic field configuration.\n", "  In Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) or High Angular Resolution Diffusion\nImaging (HARDI), a tensor field or a spherical function field (e.g., an\norientation distribution function field), can be estimated from measured\ndiffusion weighted images. In this paper, inspired by the microscopic\ntheoretical treatment of phases in liquid crystals, we introduce a novel\nmathematical framework, called Director Field Analysis (DFA), to study local\ngeometric structural information of white matter based on the reconstructed\ntensor field or spherical function field: 1) We propose a set of mathematical\ntools to process general director data, which consists of dyadic tensors that\nhave orientations but no direction. 2) We propose Orientational Order (OO) and\nOrientational Dispersion (OD) indices to describe the degree of alignment and\ndispersion of a spherical function in a single voxel or in a region,\nrespectively; 3) We also show how to construct a local orthogonal coordinate\nframe in each voxel exhibiting anisotropic diffusion; 4) Finally, we define\nthree indices to describe three types of orientational distortion (splay, bend,\nand twist) in a local spatial neighborhood, and a total distortion index to\ndescribe distortions of all three types. To our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to quantitatively describe orientational distortion (splay, bend, and\ntwist) in general spherical function fields from DTI or HARDI data. The\nproposed DFA and its related mathematical tools can be used to process not only\ndiffusion MRI data but also general director field data, and the proposed\nscalar indices are useful for detecting local geometric changes of white matter\nfor voxel-based or tract-based analysis in both DTI and HARDI acquisitions. The\nrelated codes and a tutorial for DFA will be released in DMRITool.\n", "  This work aims to identify common challenges in the preparation of the\nblister test devices designed for measurement of energy release rate for\nbrittle thin films and to propose easy-to-implement solutions accordingly. To\nthis end, we provide a step-by-step guide for fabricating a blister test device\ncomprised of thin polystyrene films adhered to glass substrates. Thin films are\nfirst transferred from donor substrates to an air-water interface, which is\nthen used as a platform to locate them on a receiver substrate. We embed a\nmicrochannel at the back of the device to evacuate the air trapped in the\nopening, through which the pressure is applied. We quantify the height and the\nradius of the blister to estimate the adhesion energy using the available\nexpressions correlating the normal force and the moment with the shape of the\nblister. The present blister test provided adhesion energy per unit area of $G\n= 18 \\pm 2$ $ \\mbox{mJ}/{\\mbox m}^2$ for polystyrene on glass, which is in good\nagreement with the measurement of $G = 14 \\pm 2$ $ \\mbox{mJ}/{\\mbox m}^2$ found\nin our independent cleavage test.\n", "  Halide perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3 and related materials have\nemerged as the most exciting development in the next generation photovoltaic\ntechnologies, yet the microscopic phenomena involving photo-carriers, ionic\ndefects, spontaneous polarization, and molecular vibration and rotation\ninteracting with numerous grains, grain boundaries, and interfaces are still\ninadequately understood. In fact, there is still need for an effective method\nto interrogate the local photovoltaic properties of halide perovskite solar\ncells that can be directly traced to their microstructures on one hand and\nlinked to their device performance on the other hand. In this perspective, we\npropose that scanning probe microscopy techniques have great potential to\nrealize such promises at the nanoscale, and highlight some of the recent\nprogresses and challenges along this line of investigation toward local probing\nof photocurrent, work function, ionic activities, polarization switching, and\nchemical degradation. We also emphasize the importance of multi-modality\nimaging, in-operando scanning, big data analysis, and multidisciplinary\ncollaboration for further studies toward fully understanding of these complex\nsystems.\n", "  Precise control of tensile stress and intrinsic damping is crucial for the\noptimal design of nanomechanical systems for sensor applications and quantum\noptomechanics in particular. In this letter we study the in uence of oxygen\nplasma on the tensile stress and intrinsic damping of nanomechanical silicon\nnitride resonators. Oxygen plasma treatments are common steps in micro and\nnanofabrication. We show that oxygen plasma of only a few minutes oxidizes the\nsilicon nitride surface, creating several nanometer thick silicon dioxide\nlayers with a compressive stress of 1.30(16)GPa. Such oxide layers can cause a\nreduction of the e ective tensile stress of a 50 nm thick stoichiometric\nsilicon nitride membrane by almost 50%. Additionally, intrinsic damping\nlinearly increases with the silicon dioxide lm thickness. An oxide layer of\n1.5nm grown in just 10s in a 50W oxygen plasma almost doubled the intrinsic\ndamping. The oxide surface layer can be e ciently removed in bu ered HF.\n", "  We study generalized disformal transformations, including derivatives of the\nmetric, in the context of the Effective Field Theory of Inflation. All these\ntransformations do not change the late-time cosmological observables but change\nthe coefficients of the operators in the action: some couplings are effectively\nredundant. At leading order in derivatives and up to cubic order in\nperturbations, one has 6 free functions that can be used to set to zero 6 of\nthe 17 operators at this order. This is used to show that the tensor\nthree-point function cannot be modified at leading order in derivatives, while\nthe scalar-tensor-tensor correlator can only be modified by changing the scalar\ndynamics. At higher order in derivatives there are transformations that do not\naffect the Einstein-Hilbert action: one can find 6 additional transformations\nthat can be used to simplify the inflaton action, at least when the dynamics is\ndominated by the lowest derivative terms. We also identify the leading\nhigher-derivative corrections to the tensor power spectrum and bispectrum.\n", "  The significant diversity of rotation curve (RC) shapes in dwarf galaxies has\nrecently emerged as a challenge to LCDM: in dark matter (DM) only simulations,\nDM halos have a universal cuspy density profile that results in self-similar RC\nshapes. We compare RC shapes of simulated galaxies from the NIHAO project with\nobserved galaxies from the homogeneous SPARC dataset. The DM halos of the NIHAO\ngalaxies can expand to form cores, with the degree of expansion depending on\ntheir stellar-to-halo mass ratio. By means of the $V_{\\rm 2kpc}-V_{\\rm Rlast}$\nrelation (where $V_{\\rm Rlast}$ is the outermost measured rotation velocity),\nwe show that both the average trend and the scatter in RC shapes of NIHAO\ngalaxies are in reasonable agreement with SPARC: this represents a significant\nimprovement compared to simulations that do not result in DM core formation,\nsuggesting that halo expansion is a key process in matching the diversity of\ndwarf galaxy RCs. Note that NIHAO galaxies can reproduce even the extremely\nslowly rising RCs of IC 2574 and UGC 5750. Revealingly, the range where\nobserved galaxies show the highest diversity corresponds to the range where\ncore formation is most efficient in NIHAO simulations, 50$<V_{\\rm Rlast}$\\km\ns$^{-1}<$100. A few observed galaxies in this range cannot be matched by any\nNIHAO RC nor by simulations that predict a universal halo profile.\nInterestingly, the majority of these are starbursts or emission-line galaxies,\nwith steep RCs and small effective radii. Such galaxies represent an\ninteresting observational target providing new clues to the process/viability\nof cusp-core transformation, the relationship between starburst and inner\npotential well, and the nature of DM.\n", "  Non-equilibrium Markov State Modeling (MSM) has recently been proposed [Phys.\nRev. E 94, 053001 (2016)] as a possible route to construct a physical theory of\nsliding friction from a long steady state atomistic simulation: the approach\nbuilds a small set of collective variables, which obey a transition-matrix\nbased equation of motion, faithfully describing the slow motions of the system.\nA crucial question is whether this approach can be extended from the original\n1D small size demo to larger and more realistic size systems, without an\ninordinate increase of the number and complexity of the collective variables.\nHere we present a direct application of the MSM scheme to the sliding of an\nisland made of over 1000 harmonically bound particles over a 2D periodic\npotential. Based on a totally unprejudiced phase space metric and without\nrequiring any special doctoring, we find that here too the scheme allows\nextracting a very small number of slow variables, necessary and sufficient to\ndescribe the dynamics of island sliding.\n", "  Impulsive, non-diverging, Petrov-Segre type N gravitational wave solutions to\na general massive three-dimensional gravity in the de Sitter, anti-de Sitter\nand flat Minkowski backgrounds are constructed in a unified manner by using the\nexterior algebra of differential forms.\n", "  Recent pump-probe experiments reported an enhancement of superconducting\ntransport along the $c$-axis of underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\\delta}$ (YBCO),\ninduced by a mid-infrared optical pump pulse tuned to a specific lattice\nvibration. To understand this transient non-equilibrium state, we develop a\npump-probe formalism for a stack of Josephson junctions, and we consider the\ntunneling strengths in presence of modulation with an ultrashort optical pulse.\nWe demonstrate that a transient enhancement of the Josephson coupling can be\nobtained for pulsed excitation and that this can be even larger than in a\ncontinuously driven steady-state. Especially interesting is the conclusion that\nthe effect is largest when the material is parametrically driven at a frequency\nimmediately above the plasma frequency, in agreement with what is found\nexperimentally. For bilayer Josephson junctions, an enhancement similar to that\nexperimentally is predicted below the critical temperature $T_c$. This model\nreproduces the essential features of the enhancement measured below $T_c$. To\nreproduce the experimental results above $T_c$, we will explore extensions of\nthis model, such as in-plane and amplitude fluctuations, elsewhere.\n", "  We regard the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation as an ensemble mean\nrepresentation of the stochastic motion of a single particle in a vacuum,\nsubject to an undefined stochastic quantum force. The local mean of the quantum\nforce is found to be proportional to the third spatial derivative of the\nprobability density function, while its associated pressure is proportional to\nthe second spatial derivative. The latter arises from the single particle\ndiluted gas pressure, and this observation allows to interpret the quantum Bohm\npotential as the energy required to put a particle in a bath of fluctuating\nvacuum at constant entropy and volume. The stochastic force expectation value\nis zero and is uncorrelated with the particle location, thus does not perform\nwork on average. Nonetheless it is anti-correlated with volume and this\nanti-correlation leads to an uncertainty relation. We analyze the dynamic\nGaussian solution to the Schrodinger equation as a simple example for exploring\nthe mean properties of this quantum force. We conclude with a few possible\ninterpretations as to the origins of quantum stochasticity.\n", "  Tidal dissipation in binary star and planetary systems is poorly understood.\nFortunately, eccentric binaries known as heartbeat stars often exhibit tidally\nexcited oscillations, providing observable diagnostics of tidal circularization\nmechanisms and timescales. We apply tidal theories to observations of the\nheartbeat star KIC 8164262, which contains an F-type primary in a very\neccentric orbit that exhibits a prominent tidally excited oscillation. We\ndemonstrate that the prominent oscillation is unlikely to result from a chance\nresonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation mode. However, the\noscillation has a frequency and amplitude consistent with the prediction of\nresonance locking, a mechanism in which coupled stellar and orbital evolution\nmaintain a stable resonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation\nmode. The resonantly excited mode produces efficient tidal dissipation\n(corresponding to an effective tidal quality factor $Q \\sim 5 \\times 10^4$),\nsuch that tidal orbital decay/circularization proceeds on a stellar evolution\ntime scale.\n", "  We consider the operator spectrum of a three-dimensional ${\\cal N} = 2$\nsuperconformal field theory with moduli spaces of one complex dimension, such\nas the fixed point theory with three chiral superfields $X,Y,Z$ and a\nsuperpotential $W = XYZ$. By using the existence of an effective theory on each\nbranch of moduli space, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of certain\nlow-lying operators carrying large $R$-charge $J$. While the lowest primary\noperator is a BPS scalar primary, the second-lowest scalar primary is in a\nsemi-short representation, with dimension exactly $J+1$, a fact that cannot be\nseen directly from the $XYZ$ Lagrangian. The third-lowest scalar primary lies\nin a long multiplet with dimension $J+2 - c_{-3} \\, J^{-3} + O(J^{-4})$, where\n$c_{-3}$ is an unknown positive coefficient. The coefficient $c_{-3}$ is\nproportional to the leading superconformal interaction term in the effective\ntheory on moduli space. The positivity of $c_{-3}$ does not follow from\nsupersymmetry, but rather from unitarity of moduli scattering and the absence\nof superluminal signal propagation in the effective dynamics of the complex\nmodulus. We also prove a general lemma, that scalar semi-short representations\nform a module over the chiral ring in a natural way, by ordinary multiplication\nof local operators. Combined with the existence of scalar semi-short states at\nlarge $J$, this proves the existence of scalar semi-short states at all values\nof $J$. Thus the combination of ${\\cal N}=2$ superconformal symmetry with the\nlarge-$J$ expansion is more powerful than the sum of its parts.\n", "  We report an experimental study on the manipulation of colloidal particles in\na drop sitting on a hydrogel. The manipulation is achieved by diffusiophoresis,\nwhich describes a directed motion of particles induced by solute gradients. By\nletting the solute concentrations for the drop and the hydrogel be different,\nwe control the motion of particles in a stable suspension, which is otherwise\ndifficult to achieve. We show that diffusiophoresis can cause the particles to\nmove either toward or away from the liquid-air interface depending on the\ndirection of the solute gradient and the surface charge of the particles. We\nmeasure the particle adsorption experimentally and rationalize the results with\na one-dimensional numerical model. We show that diffusiophoretic motion is\nsignificant at the lengthscale of a drop deposited on a hydrogel, which\nsuggests a simple method for the deposition of particles on hydrogels.\n", "  Most risk analysis models systematically underestimate the probability and\nimpact of catastrophic events (e.g., economic crises, natural disasters, and\nterrorism) by not taking into account interconnectivity and interdependence of\nrisks. To address this weakness, we propose the Cascading Alternating Renewal\nProcess (CARP) to forecast interconnected global risks. However, assessments of\nthe model's prediction precision are limited by lack of sufficient ground truth\ndata. Here, we establish prediction precision as a function of input data size\nby using alternative long ground truth data generated by simulations of the\nCARP model with known parameters. We illustrate the approach on a model of\nfires in artificial cities assembled from basic city blocks with diverse\nhousing. The results confirm that parameter recovery variance exhibits power\nlaw decay as a function of the length of available ground truth data. Using\nCARP, we also demonstrate estimation using a disparate dataset that also has\ndependencies: real-world prediction precision for the global risk model based\non the World Economic Forum Global Risk Report. We conclude that the CARP model\nis an efficient method for predicting catastrophic cascading events with\npotential applications to emerging local and global interconnected risks.\n", "  We derive the theoretical and numerical framework for investigating\nnonequilibrium properties of spin-orbit coupled wires with Zeeman splitting\nproximized by a superconductor in the non-linear diffusive regime. We\ndemonstrate that the anisotropic behaviour of triplet Cooper pairs in this\nsystem leads to novel spin accumulation profiles tunable by the magnetic field\nand strength of applied voltage bias. This paves the way for enhanced\nmanipulation of superconducting spintronic devices, and enables further\ninvestigation of nonequilibrium effects in proximity-coupled superconducting\nstructures more generally.\n", "  Many materials of interest are polycrystals, i.e. aggregates of single\ncrystals. Randomly distributed orientations of single crystals lead to\nmacroscopically isotropic properties. Here, we briefly review strategies of\ncalculating effective isotropic second and third order elastic constants from\nthe single crystal ones. Our main emphasize is on single crystals of cubic\nsymmetry. Especially the averaging of third order elastic constants has not\nbeen particularly successful in the past, and discrepancies have often been\nattributed to texturing of the polycrystal as well as to uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of elastic constants of both poly and single crystals. While this\nmay well be true, we point out here also shortcomings in the theoretical\naveraging framework.\n", "  We present an analytical theory of domain wall tilt due to a transverse\nin-plane magnetic field in a ferromagnetic nanostrip with out-of-plane\nanisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). The theory treats the\ndomain walls as one-dimensional objects with orientation-dependent energy,\nwhich interact with the sample edges. We show that under an applied field the\ndomain wall remains straight, but tilts at an angle to the direction of the\nmagnetic field that is proportional to the field strength for moderate fields\nand sufficiently strong DMI. Furthermore, we obtain a nonlinear dependence of\nthe tilt angle on the applied field at weaker DMI. Our analytical results are\ncorroborated by micromagnetic simulations.\n", "  We compare case studies of Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)-observed\nmagnetopause electron diffusion regions (EDRs) to determine how the rate of\nwork done by the electric field,\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot(\\vec{E}+\\vec{v}_e\\times\\vec{B})\\equiv\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$, and\nelectron dynamics vary with magnetic shear angle. We provide an in-depth\nanalysis of an MMS-observed EDR event with a guide field approximately the same\nsize as the magnetosheath reconnecting field, which occurred on 8 December\n2015. We find that $\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ was large and positive near the\nmagnetic field reversal point, though patchy lower-amplitude\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ also occurred on the magnetosphere-side EDR near the\nelectron crescent point. The current associated with the large\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ near the null was carried by electrons with a velocity\ndistribution function (VDF) resembling that of the magnetosheath inflow, but\naccelerated in the anti-parallel direction by the parallel electric field. At\nthe magnetosphere-side EDR, the current was carried by electrons with a\ncrescent-like VDF. We compare this 8 December event to four others with\ndiffering magnetic shear angles. This type of dual-region\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ was observed in another intermediate-shear EDR event,\nwhereas the high-shear events had a strong positive $\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ near\nthe electron crescent point and the low-shear event had a strong positive\n$\\vec{J}\\cdot\\vec{E}'$ near the in-plane null. We propose a physical\nrelationship between the shear angle and mode of energy conversion where (a) a\nguide field provides an efficient mechanism for carrying a current at the field\nreversal point (streaming) and (b) a guide field may limit the formation of\ncrescent eVDFs, limiting the current carried near the stagnation point.\n", "  Light electroweakinos, the neutral and charged fermionic supersymmetric\npartners of the Standard Model $\\mathrm{SU}(2)\\times\\mathrm{U}(1)$ gauge bosons\nand of the two $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Higgs doublets, are an important target for\nsearches for new physics with the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, if the\nlightest neutralino is the dark matter, constraints from direct dark matter\ndetection experiments rule out large swaths of the parameter space accessible\nto the LHC, including in large part the so-called \"well-tempered\" neutralinos.\nWe focus on the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and explore in\ndetail which regions of parameter space are not excluded by null results from\ndirect dark matter detection, assuming exclusive thermal production of\nneutralinos in the early universe, and illustrate the complementarity with\ncurrent and future LHC searches for electroweak gauginos. We consider both\nbino-Higgsino and bino-wino \"not-so-well-tempered\" neutralinos, i.e. we include\nmodels where the lightest neutralino constitutes only part of the cosmological\ndark matter, with the consequent suppression of the constraints from direct and\nindirect dark matter searches.\n", "  We study the properties of entanglement in two-dimensional topologically\nordered phases of matter. Such phases support anyons, quasiparticles with\nexotic exchange statistics. The emergent nonlocal state spaces of anyonic\nsystems admit a particular form of entanglement that does not exist in\nconventional quantum mechanical systems. We study this entanglement by adapting\nstandard notions of entropy to anyonic systems. We use the algebraic theory of\nanyon models (modular tensor categories) to illustrate the nonlocal\nentanglement structure of anyonic systems. Using this formalism, we present a\ngeneral method of deriving the universal topological contributions to the\nentanglement entropy for general system configurations of a topological phase,\nincluding surfaces of arbitrary genus, punctures, and quasiparticle content. We\nanalyze a number of examples in detail. Our results recover and extend prior\nresults for anyonic entanglement and the topological entanglement entropy.\n", "  We study the simplest superstring bit model at finite N using the characters\nof the SU(N) group. We obtain exact, analytic expressions for small N partition\nfunctions and Gaussian approximations for them in the high temperature limit\nfor all N. We use numerical evidence to identify two temperature regimes where\nthe partition function has different limiting behaviors. The temperature at\nwhich this transition takes place is identified as the Hagedorn temperature.\n", "  Understanding the origin of unintentional doping in Ga2O3 is key to\nincreasing breakdown voltages of Ga2O3 based power devices. Therefore,\ntransport and capacitance spectroscopy studies have been performed to better\nunderstand the origin of unintentional doping in Ga2O3. Previously unobserved\nunintentional donors in commercially available (-201) Ga2O3 substrates have\nbeen electrically characterized via temperature dependent Hall effect\nmeasurements up to 1000 K and found to have a donor energy of 110 meV. The\nexistence of the unintentional donor is confirmed by temperature dependent\nadmittance spectroscopy, with an activation energy of 131 meV determined via\nthat technique, in agreement with Hall effect measurements. With the\nconcentration of this donor determined to be in the mid to high 10^16 cm^-3\nrange, elimination of this donor from the drift layer of Ga2O3 power\nelectronics devices will be key to pushing the limits of device performance.\nIndeed, analytical assessment of the specific on-resistance (Ronsp) and\nbreakdown voltage of Schottky diodes containing the 110 meV donor indicates\nthat incomplete ionization increases Ronsp and decreases breakdown voltage as\ncompared to Ga2O3 Schottky diodes containing only the shallow donor. The\nreduced performance due to incomplete ionization occurs in addition to the\nusual tradeoff between Ronsp and breakdown voltage. To achieve 10 kV operation\nin Ga2O3 Schottky diode devices, analysis indicates that the concentration of\n110 meV donors must be reduced below 5x10^14 cm^-3 to limit the increase in\nRonsp to one percent.\n", "  QmeQ is an open-source Python package for numerical modeling of transport\nthrough quantum dot devices with strong electron-electron interactions using\nvarious approximate master equation approaches. The package provides a\nframework for calculating stationary particle or energy currents driven by\ndifferences in chemical potentials or temperatures between the leads which are\ntunnel coupled to the quantum dots. The electronic structures of the quantum\ndots are described by their single-particle states and the Coulomb matrix\nelements between the states. When transport is treated perturbatively to lowest\norder in the tunneling couplings, the possible approaches are Pauli\n(classical), first-order Redfield, and first-order von Neumann master\nequations, and a particular form of the Lindblad equation. When all processes\ninvolving two-particle excitations in the leads are of interest, the\nsecond-order von Neumann approach can be applied. All these approaches are\nimplemented in QmeQ. We here give an overview of the basic structure of the\npackage, give examples of transport calculations, and outline the range of\napplicability of the different approximate approaches.\n", "  We autonomously stabilize arbitrary states of a qubit through parametric\nmodulation of the coupling between a fixed frequency qubit and resonator. The\ncoupling modulation is achieved with a tunable coupler design, in which the\nqubit and the resonator are connected in parallel to a superconducting quantum\ninterference device. This allows for quasi-static tuning of the qubit-cavity\ncoupling strength from 12 MHz to more than 300 MHz. Additionally, the coupling\ncan be dynamically modulated, allowing for single photon exchange in 6 ns.\nQubit coherence times exceeding 20 $\\mu$s are maintained over the majority of\nthe range of tuning, limited primarily by the Purcell effect. The parametric\nstabilization technique realized using the tunable coupler involves engineering\nthe qubit bath through a combination of photon non-conserving sideband\ninteractions realized by flux modulation, and direct qubit Rabi driving. We\ndemonstrate that the qubit can be stabilized to arbitrary states on the Bloch\nsphere with a worst-case fidelity exceeding 80 %.\n", "  We present a systematic density functional theory (DFT) plus Hubbard $U$\nstudy of structural trends and the stability of different magnetically ordered\nstates across the rare-earth nickelate series, $R$NiO$_3$, with $R$ from Lu to\nLa. In particular, we investigate how the magnetic order, the change of the\nrare-earth ion, and the Hubbard interaction $U$ are affecting the bond-length\ndisproportionation between the nickel sites. Our results show that structural\nparameters can be obtained that are in very good agreement with present\nexperimental data, and that DFT+$U$ is in principle able to capture the most\nimportant structural trends across the nickelate series. However, the amplitude\nof the bond-length disproportionation depends very strongly on the specific\nvalue used for the Hubbard $U$ parameter and also on the type of magnetic order\nimposed in the calculation. Regarding the relative stability of different\nmagnetic orderings, a realistic antiferromagnetic order, consistent with the\nexperimental observations, is favored for small $U$ values, and becomes more\nand more favorable compared to the ferromagnetic state towards the end of the\nseries (i.e., towards $R$=Pr). Nevertheless, it seems that the stability of the\nferromagnetic state is generally overestimated within the DFT+$U$ calculations.\nOur work provides a profound starting point for more detailed experimental\ninvestigations, and also for future studies using more advanced computational\ntechniques such as, e.g., DFT combined with dynamical mean-field theory.\n", "  We report on \\textit{in situ} growth of crystalline Al and Nb shells on InAs\nnanowires. The nanowires are grown on Si(111) substrates by molecular beam\nepitaxy (MBE) without foreign catalysts in the vapor-solid mode. The metal\nshells are deposited by electron-beam evaporation in a metal MBE. High quality\nsupercondonductor/semiconductor hybrid structures such as Al/InAs and Nb/InAs\nare of interest for ongoing research in the fields of gateable Josephson\njunctions and quantum information related research. Systematic investigations\nof the deposition parameters suitable for metal shell growth are conducted. In\ncase of Al, the substrate temperature, the growth rate and the shell thickness\nare considered. The substrate temperature as well as the angle of the impinging\ndeposition flux are explored for Nb shells. The core-shell hybrid structures\nare characterized by electron microscopy and x-ray spectroscopy. Our results\nshow that the substrate temperature is a crucial parameter in order to enable\nthe deposition of smooth Al layers. Contrary, Nb films are less dependent on\nsubstrate temperature but strongly affected by the deposition angle. At a\ntemperature of 200{\\deg}C Nb reacts with InAs, dissolving the nanowire crystal.\nOur investigations result in smooth metal shells exhibiting an impurity and\ndefect free, crystalline superconductor/InAs interface. Additionally, we find\nthat the superconductor crystal structure is not affected by stacking faults\npresent in the InAs nanowires.\n", "  Spin-gapless semiconductors with their unique band structures have recently\nattracted much attention due to their interesting transport properties that can\nbe utilized in spintronics applications. We have successfully deposited the\nthin films of quaternary spin-gapless semiconductor CoFeMnSi Heusler alloy on\nMgO (001) substrates using a pulsed laser deposition system. These films show\nepitaxial growth along (001) direction and display uniform and smooth\ncrystalline surface. The magnetic properties reveal that the film is\nferromagnetically soft along the in-plane direction and its Curie temperature\nis well above 400 K. The electrical conductivity of the film is low and\nexhibits a nearly temperature independent semiconducting behaviour. The\nestimated temperature coefficient of resistivity for the film is -7x10^-10\nOhm.m/K, which is comparable to the values reported for spin-gapless\nsemiconductors.\n", "  The discovery of colour-kinematic duality has led to significant progress in\nthe computation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. At tree\nlevel, the origin of the duality can be traced back to the monodromies of\nopen-string amplitudes. This construction has recently been extended to all\nloop orders. In the present paper, we dissect some consequences of these new\nmonodromy relations at one loop. We use single cuts in order to relate them to\nthe tree-level relations. We show that there are new classes of kinematically\nindependent single-cut amplitudes. Then we turn to the Feynman diagrammatics of\nthe string-theory monodromy relations. We revisit the string-theoretic\nderivation and argue that some terms, that vanish upon integration in string\nand field theory, provide a characterisation of momentum-shifting ambiguities\nin these representations. We observe that colour-dual representations are\ncompatible with this analysis.\n", "  We present a unified perspective on symmetry protected topological (SPT)\nphases in one dimension and address the open question of what characterizes\ntheir phase transitions. In the first part of this work we use symmetry as a\nguide to map various well-known fermionic and spin SPTs to a Kitaev chain with\ncoupling of range $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb Z$. This unified picture uncovers new\nproperties of old models --such as how the cluster state is the fixed point\nlimit of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state in disguise-- and elucidates the\nconnection between fermionic and bosonic phases --with the Hubbard chain\ninterpolating between four Kitaev chains and a spin chain in the Haldane phase.\nIn the second part, we study the topological phase transitions between these\nmodels in the presence of interactions. This leads us to conjecture that the\ncritical point between any SPT with $d$-dimensional edge modes and the trivial\nphase has a central charge $c \\geq \\log_2 d$. We analytically verify this for\nmany known transitions. This agrees with the intuitive notion that the phase\ntransition is described by a delocalized edge mode, and that the central charge\nof a conformal field theory is a measure of the gapless degrees of freedom.\n", "  We discuss the universal spin dynamics in quasi one-dimensional systems\nincluding the real spin in narrow-gap semiconductors like InAs and InSb, the\nvalley pseudospin in staggered single-layer graphene, and the combination of\nreal spin and valley pseudospin characterizing single-layer transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$. All\nthese systems can be described by the same Dirac-like Hamiltonian.\nSpin-dependent observable effects in one of these systems thus have\ncounterparts in each of the other systems. Effects discussed in more detail\ninclude equilibrium spin currents, current-induced spin polarization (Edelstein\neffect), and spin currents generated via adiabatic spin pumping. Our work also\nsuggests that a long-debated spin-dependent correction to the position operator\nin single-band models should be absent.\n", "  Systems with interacting degrees of freedom play a prominent role in\nstochastic thermodynamics. Our aim is to use the concept of detached path\nprobabilities and detached entropy production for bipartite Markov processes\nand elaborate on a series of special cases including measurement-feedback\nsystems, sensors and hidden Markov models. For these special cases we show that\nfluctuation theorems involving the detached entropy production recover known\nresults which have been obtained separately before. Additionally, we show that\nthe fluctuation relation for the detached entropy production can be used in\nmodel selection for data stemming from a hidden Markov model. We discuss the\nrelation to previous approaches including those which use information flow or\nlearning rate to quantify the influence of one subsystem on the other. In\nconclusion, we present a complete framework with which to find fluctuation\nrelations for coupled systems.\n", "  The polarization-response spectrum of the fullerene C60 modeled as a\nhomogeneous spherical plasma shell is calculated in the framework of the\nhydrodynamic approach allowing for the spatial dispersion caused by the\nFermi-distributed valence electrons. The dipole eigenoscillations spectrum of\nthe shell is found to contain a series of plasmons distinguished by the\nfrequency and the radial structure. The first two of them (whose structures for\nC60 is the subject of discussion up to now) pass to the lower and higher\nsurface plasmons of the plasma shell if its thickness is much larger than\nTomas-Fermi length. However, under parameters values corresponding to the C60\nmolecule, when these lengths are of the same order, both these plasmons\n(providing the main contribution to the fullerene absorption spectrum) are\nfound to be actually volume ones in their spatial structure, and the frequency\nof the higher of them becomes larger than the plasma frequency (as with all the\nhigher volume plasmons). The resonance curve of the fullerene absorption\ncross-section calculated on the basis of the developed model with allowance for\nthe surface losses caused by the reflection of electrons at the shell\nboundaries agrees satisfactory with the experimental data.\n", "  A minimal fermion-scalar preonic model containing two fermionic and one\nscalar preons is proposed. This scheme allows to prevent the occurrence of\nundesired SM-level particles, namely leptons and quarks with unusual electric\ncharges. Similar to the previous FS models, color-octet leptons and\ncolor-sextet quarks, which are expected to have masses much lower than the\ncompositeness scale, are predicted. Observation of these particles could\nprovide first indications of preonic models. FCC (SppC) pp option will give\nopportunity to probe $m_{q_{6}}$ up to 48 (75) TeV and $m_{l_{8}}$ up to 15\n(27) TeV within one year operation at nominal luminosity. FCC/SppC based ep and\n$\\mu$p colliders will essentially enlarge covered mass region, namely,\n$m_{e_{8}}$ up to 23/27 TeV and $m_{\\mu_{8}}$ up to 68/80 TeV.\n", "  A shaped doublet pump pulse is proposed for simultaneous octave-spanning\nsoliton Kerr frequency comb generation and second-harmonic conversion in a\nsingle microresonator. The temporal soliton in the cavity is trapped atop a\ndoublet pulse pedestal, resulting in a greatly expanded soliton region compared\nto that with a general Gaussian pulse pump. The possibility of\nsingle-microresonator comb self-referencing in a single silicon nitride\nmicroring, which can facilitate compact on-chip optical clocks, is demonstrated\nvia simulation.\n", "  As network science has matured as an established field of research, there are\nalready a number of courses on this topic developed and offered at various\nhigher education institutions, often at postgraduate levels. In those courses,\ninstructors adopted different approaches with different focus areas and\ncurricular designs. We collected information about 30 existing network science\ncourses from various online sources, and analyzed the contents of their syllabi\nor course schedules. The topics and their curricular sequences were extracted\nfrom the course syllabi/schedules and represented as a directed weighted graph,\nwhich we call the topic network. Community detection in the topic network\nrevealed seven topic clusters, which matched reasonably with the concept list\npreviously generated by students and educators through the Network Literacy\ninitiative. The minimum spanning tree of the topic network revealed typical\nflows of curricular contents, starting with examples of networks, moving onto\nrandom networks and small-world networks, then branching off to various\nsubtopics from there. These results illustrate the current state of consensus\nformation (including variations and disagreements) among the network science\ncommunity on what should be taught about networks and how, which may also be\ninformative for K--12 education and informal education.\n", "  How precisely can we estimate cosmological parameters by performing a quantum\nmeasurement on a cosmological quantum state? In quantum estimation theory the\nvariance of an unbiased parameter estimator is bounded from below by the\ninverse of measurement-dependent Fisher information and ultimately by quantum\nFisher information, which is the maximization of the former over all positive\noperator valued measurements. Such bound is known as the quantum Cramer-Rao\nbound. We consider the evolution of a massless scalar field with Bunch-Davies\nvacuum in a spatially flat FLRW spacetime, which results in a two-mode squeezed\nvacuum out-state for each field wave number mode. We obtain the expressions of\nthe quantum Fisher information as well as the Fisher informations associated to\noccupation number measurement and power spectrum measurement, and show the\nspecific results of their evoluation for pure de Sitter expansion and de Sitter\nexpansion followed by a radiation-dominated phase as examples. We will discuss\nthese results from the point of view of the quantum-to-classical transition of\ncosmological perturbations and show quantitatively how this transition and the\nresidual quantum correlations affect the bound on the precision.\n", "  We examine the possibility of a dark matter (DM) contribution to the recently\nobserved gamma-ray spectrum seen in the M31 galaxy. In particular, we apply\nlimits on Weakly Interacting Massive Particle DM annihilation cross-sections\nderived from the Coma galaxy cluster and the Reticulum II dwarf galaxy to\ndetermine the maximal flux contribution by DM annihilation to both the M31\ngamma-ray spectrum and that of the Milky-Way galactic centre. We limit the\nenergy range between 1 and 12 GeV in M31 and galactic centre spectra due to the\nlimited range of former's data, as well as to encompass the high-energy\ngamma-ray excess observed in the latter target. In so doing, we will make use\nof Fermi-LAT data for all mentioned targets, as well as diffuse radio data for\nthe Coma cluster. The multi-target strategy using both Coma and Reticulum II to\nderive cross-section limits, as well as multi-frequency data, ensures that our\nresults are robust against the various uncertainties inherent in modelling of\nindirect DM emissions.\n  Our results indicate that, when a Navarro-Frenk-White (or shallower) radial\ndensity profile is assumed, severe constraints can be imposed upon the fraction\nof the M31 and galactic centre spectra that can be accounted for by DM, with\nthe best limits arising from cross-section constraints from Coma radio data and\nReticulum II gamma-ray limits. These particular limits force all the studied\nannihilation channels to contribute 1% or less to the total integrated\ngamma-ray flux within both M31 and galactic centre targets. In contrast,\nconsiderably more, 10-100%, of the flux can be attributed to DM when a\ncontracted Navarro-Frenk-White profile is assumed. This demonstrates how\nsensitive DM contributions to gamma-ray emissions are to the possibility of\ncored profiles in galaxies.\n", "  Knowing the band structure of materials is one of the prerequisites to\nunderstand their properties. Therefore, especially in the last decades,\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has become a highly demanded\nexperimental tool to investigate the band structure. However, especially in\nthin film materials with a layered structure and several capping layers, access\nto the electronic structure by ARPES is limited. Therefore, several alternative\nmethods to obtain the required information have been suggested. Here, we\ndirectly invert the results by cyclotron resonance experiments to obtain the\nband structure of a two-dimensional (2D) material. This procedure is applied to\nthe mercury telluride quantum well with critical thickness which is\ncharacterized by a 2D electron gas with linear dispersion relations. The\nDirac-like band structure in this material could be mapped both on the electron\nand on the hole side of the band diagram. In this material, purely linear\ndispersion of the hole-like carriers is in contrast to detectable quadratic\ncorrections for the electrons.\n", "  We compute the four-loop $n_f$ contribution proportional to the quartic\nCasimir of the QCD cusp anomalous dimension as an expansion for small cusp\nangle $\\phi$. This piece is gauge invariant, violates Casimir scaling, and\nfirst appears at four loops. It requires the evaluation of genuine non-planar\nfour-loop Feynman integrals. We present results up to ${\\mathcal O}(\\phi^4)$.\nOne motivation for our calculation is to probe a recent conjecture on the\nall-order structure of the cusp anomalous dimension. As a byproduct we obtain\nthe four-loop HQET wave function anomalous dimension for this color structure.\n", "  We discuss the nonlinear Andreev current of an interacting quantum dot\ncoupled to spin-polarized and superconducting reservoirs when voltage and\ntemperature biases are applied across the nanostructure. Due to the\nparticle-hole symmetry introduced by the superconducting (S) lead, the subgap\nspin current vanishes identically. Nevertheless, the Andreev charge current\ndepends on the degree of polarization in the ferromagnetic (F) contact since\nthe shift of electrostatic internal potential of the conductor depends on spin\norientation of the charge carrier. This spin-dependent potential shift\ncharacterizes nonlinear responses in our device. We show how the subgap current\nversus the bias voltage or temperature difference depends on the lead\npolarization in two cases, namely (i) S-dominant case, when the\ndot-superconductor tunneling rate ($\\Gamma_R$) is much higher than the\nferromagnet-dot tunnel coupling ($\\Gamma_L$), and (ii) F-dominant case, when\n$\\Gamma_L\\gg \\Gamma_R$. For the ferromagnetic dominant case the spin-dependent\npotential shows a nonmonotonic behavior as the dot level is detuned. Thus the\nsubgap current can also exhibit interesting behaviors such as current\nrectification and the maximization of thermocurrents with smaller thermal\nbiases when the lead polarization and the quantum dot level are adjusted.\n", "  The mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms of Cu/Nb nanoscale\nmetallic multilayers (NMMs) manufactured by accumulative roll bonding (ARB) are\nstudied at 25C and 400C. Cu/Nb NMMs with individual layer thicknesses between 7\nand 63 nm were tested by in-situ micropillar compression inside a scanning\nelectron microscope Yield strength, strain-rate sensitivities and activation\nvolumes were obtained from the pillar compression tests. The deformed\nmicropillars were examined under scanning and transmission electron microscopy\nin order to examine the deformation mechanisms active for different layer\nthicknesses and temperatures. The analysis suggests that room temperature\ndeformation was determined by dislocation glide at larger layer thicknesses and\ninterface-related mechanisms at the thinner layer thicknesses. The high\ntemperature compression tests, in contrast, revealed superior thermo-mechanical\nstability and strength retention for the NMMs with larger layer thicknesses\nwith deformation controlled by dislocation glide. A remarkable transition in\ndeformation mechanism occurred as the layer thickness decreased, to a\ndeformation response controlled by diffusion processes along the interfaces,\nwhich resulted in temperature-induced softening. A deformation mechanism map,\nin terms of layer thickness and temperature, is proposed from the results\nobtained in this investigation.\n", "  Chiral and helical domain walls are generic defects of topological\nspin-triplet superconductors. We study theoretically the magnetic and transport\nproperties of superconducting singlet-triplet-singlet heterostructure as a\nfunction of the phase difference between the singlet leads in the presence of\nchiral and helical domains inside the spin-triplet region. The local inversion\nsymmetry breaking at the singlet-triplet interface allows the emergence of a\nstatic phase-controlled magnetization, and generally yields both spin and\ncharge currents flowing along the edges. The parity of the domain wall number\naffects the relative orientation of the interface moments and currents, while\nin some cases the domain walls themselves contribute to spin and charge\ntransport. We demonstrate that singlet-triplet heterostructures are a generic\nprototype to generate and control non-dissipative spin and charge effects,\nputting them in a broader class of systems exhibiting spin-Hall, anomalous Hall\neffects and similar phenomena. Features of the electron transport and magnetic\neffects at the interfaces can be employed to assess the presence of domains in\nchiral/helical superconductors.\n", "  Boolean logic is used to prove the CHSH inequalities. The proof elucidates\nthe connection be- tween Einstein elements of reality and quantum non locality.\nThe violation of the CHSH inequality by quantum theory is discussed and the two\nstage view of quantum measurement relevance to incompatible observables is\noutlined.\n", "  We explore some of the ramifications arising from superflares on the\nevolutionary history of Earth, other planets in the Solar system, and\nexoplanets. We propose that the most powerful superflares can serve as\nplausible drivers of extinction events, and that their periodicity could\ncorrespond to certain patterns in the terrestrial fossil diversity record. On\nthe other hand, weaker superflares may play a positive role in enabling the\norigin of life through the formation of key organic compounds. Superflares\ncould also prove to be quite detrimental to the evolution of complex life on\npresent-day Mars and exoplanets in the habitable zone of M- and K-dwarfs. We\nconclude that the risk posed by superflares has not been sufficiently\nappreciated, and that humanity might potentially witness a superflare event in\nthe next $\\sim 10^3$ years leading to devastating economic and technological\nlosses. In light of the many uncertainties and assumptions associated with our\nanalysis, we recommend that these results should be viewed with due caution.\n", "  We have carried out a campaign to characterize the hot Jupiters WASP-5b,\nWASP-44b and WASP-46b using multiband photometry collected at the\nObservat\\'orio do Pico Dos Dias in Brazil. We have determined the planetary\nphysical properties and new transit ephemerides for these systems. The new\norbital parameters and physical properties of WASP-5b and WASP-44b are\nconsistent with previous estimates. In the case of WASP-46b, there is some\nquota of disagreement between previous results. We provide a new determination\nof the radius of this planet and help clarify the previous differences. We also\nstudied the transit time variations including our new measurements. No clear\nvariation from a linear trend was found for the systems WASP-5b and WASP-44b.\nIn the case of WASP-46b, we found evidence of deviations indicating the\npresence of a companion but statistical analysis of the existing times points\nto a signal due to the sampling rather than a new planet. Finally, we studied\nthe fractional radius variation as a function of wavelength for these systems.\nThe broad-band spectrums of WASP-5b and WASP-44b are mostly flat. In the case\nof WASP-46b we found a trend, but further measurements are necessary to confirm\nthis finding.\n", "  We analyze the transport properties of a low density ensemble of identical\nmacroscopic particles immersed in an active fluid. The particles are modeled as\ninelastic hard spheres (granular gas). The non-homogeneous active fluid is\nmodeled by means of a non-uniform stochastic thermostat. The theoretical\nresults are validated with a numerical solution of the corresponding the\nkinetic equation (direct simulation Monte Carlo method). We show a steady flow\nin the system that is accurately described by Navier-Stokes (NS) hydrodynamics,\neven for high inelasticity. Surprisingly, we find that the deviations from NS\nhydrodynamics for this flow are stronger as the inelasticity decreases. The\nactive fluid action is modeled here with a non-uniform fluctuating volume\nforce. This is a relevant result given that hydrodynamics of particles in\ncomplex environments, such as biological crowded environments, is still a\nquestion under intense debate.\n", "  The use of methylammonium (MA) lead halide perovskites \\ce{CH3NH3PbX3} (X=I,\nBr, Cl) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has made great progress in performance\nefficiency during recent years. However, the rapid decomposition of \\ce{MAPbI3}\nin humid environments hinders outdoor application of PSCs, and thus, a\ncomprehensive understanding of the degradation mechanism is required. To do\nthis, we investigate the effect of water intercalation and hydration of the\ndecomposition and ion migration of \\ce{CH3NH3PbX3} using first-principles\ncalculations. We find that water interacts with \\ce{PbX6} and MA through\nhydrogen bonding, and the former interaction enhances gradually, while the\nlatter hardly changes when going from X=I to Br and to Cl. Thermodynamic\ncalculations indicate that water exothermically intercalates into the\nperovskite, while the water intercalated and monohydrated compounds are stable\nwith respect to decomposition. More importantly, the water intercalation\ngreatly reduces the activation energies for vacancy-mediated ion migration,\nwhich become higher going from X=I to Br and to Cl. Our work indicates that\nhydration of halide perovskites must be avoided to prevent the degradation of\nPSCs upon moisture exposure.\n", "  Inks of permanent markers and water-proof cosmetics create elastic thin films\nupon application on a surface. Such adhesive materials are deliberately\ndesigned to exhibit water-repellent behavior. Therefore, patterns made up of\nthese inks become resistant to moisture and cannot be cleaned by water after\ndrying. However, we show that sufficiently slow dipping of such elastic films,\nwhich are adhered to a substrate, into a bath of pure water allows complete\nremoval of the hydrophobic coatings. Upon dipping, the air-water interface in\nthe bath forms a contact line on the substrate, which exerts a\ncapillary-induced peeling force at the edge of the hydrophobic thin film. We\nhighlight that this capillary peeling process is more effective at lower\nvelocities of the air-liquid interface and lower viscosities. Capillary peeling\nnot only removes such thin films from the substrate but also transfers them\nflawlessly onto the air-water interface.\n", "  The idea that excitonic state (electronic) coherences are of fundamental\nimportance to natural photosynthesis gained popularity when, a decade ago,\nslowly dephasing quantum beats were observed in the two-dimensional electronic\nspectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex at 77 K. These were assigned to\nquantum superpositions of excitonic states; a controversial interpretation, as\nthe spectral linewidths suggested fast dephasing arising from strong\ninteractions with the environment. While it has been pointed out that\nvibrational motion produces similar spectral signatures, concrete assignment of\nthese coherences to distinct physical processes is still lacking. Here we\nrevisit the coherence dynamics of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex using\npolarization-controlled two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy, supported by\ntheoretical modelling. We show that the long-lived quantum beats originate\nexclusively from vibrational coherences, whereas electronic coherences dephase\nentirely within 240 fs even at 77 K - a timescale too short to play a\nsignificant role in light harvesting. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nspecific vibrational coherences are excited via vibronically coupled states.\nThe detection of vibronic coupling indicates the relevance of this phenomenon\nfor photosynthetic energy transfer.\n", "  Interlayer rotation and stacking were recently demonstrated as effective\nstrategies for tuning physical properties of various two-dimensional materials.\nThe latter strategy was mostly realized in hetero-structures with continuously\nvaried stacking orders, which obscure the revelation of the intrinsic role of a\ncertain stacking order in its physical properties. Here, we introduce\ninversion-domain-boundaries into molecular-beam-epitaxy grown MoSe2\nhomo-bilayers, which induce unusual-fractional lattice translations to their\nsurrounding domains, accounting for the observed diversity of large-area and\nuniform stacking sequences. Unusual low-symmetric stacking orders were observed\nusing transmission electron microscopy and detailed geometries were identified\nby density functional theory. A linear relation was also revealed between\ninterlayer distance and stacking energy. These stacking sequences yield various\nenergy alignments between the valence states at {\\Gamma} and K, showing\nstacking dependent bandgaps and valence band tail states in the measured\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy. These results may benefit the design of\ntwo-dimensional multilayers with manipulable stacking orders.\n", "  We report on the detection of three transiting small planets around the\nlow-mass star LP 358-499 (K2-133), using photometric data from the Kepler-K2\nmission. Using multiband photometry, we determine the host star to be an early\nM dwarf with an age likely older than a Gigayear. The three detected planets\nK2-133 b, c, and d have orbital periods of ca. 3, 4.9 and 11 days and transit\ndepths of ca. 700, 1000 and 2000 ppm, respectively. We also report a planetary\ncandidate in the system (EPIC 247887989.01) with a period of 26.6 days and a\ndepth of ca. 1000 ppm, which may be at the inner edge of the stellar habitable\nzone, depending on the specific host star properties. Using the transit\nparameters and the stellar properties, we estimate that the innermost planet\nmay be rocky. The system is suited for follow-up observations to measure\nplanetary masses and JWST transmission spectra of planetary atmospheres.\n", "  A new kind of spin-1 chain Hamiltonian consisting of competing dimer and\ntrimer projection operators is proposed. As the relative strengths and signs of\nthe interactions are varied, the model exhibits a number of different phases\nincluding the gapped dimer phase and the gapless trimer phase with critical\ncorrelations described by a conformal field theory with central charge $c=2$. A\nsymmetry-protected topological phase also exists in this model, even though the\nmicroscopic interactions are not the simple adiabatic extensions of the\nwell-known Heisenberg and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model and contains\nboth two- and three-particle permutations. A fourth phase is characterized by\nmacroscopically degenerate ground states. While bearing almost a one-to-one\nresemblance to the phase diagram of the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain\nHamiltonian, our model is rooted on very different physical origin, namely the\ntwo competing tendencies of spin-1 particles to form singlets through either\ndimer or trimer formation.\n", "  In this paper, two dilatonic fields that capture two conformal symmetries in\nthe Georgi-Glashow SU(5) model are introduced. Then, one of the fields is\nassociated with the Higgs, and the other one with inflation. By using the Higgs\nportal, the mass of the dilatonic Higgs can be tuned by the coupling constant\nbetween the two dilatonic fields.\n", "  Even though it is not possible to differentiate General Relativity from\nTeleparallel Gravity using classical experiments, it could be possible to\ndiscriminate between them by quantum gravitational effects. These effects have\nmotivated the introduction of nonlocal deformations of General Relativity, and\nsimilar effects are also expected to occur in Teleparallel Gravity. Here, we\nstudy nonlocal deformations of Teleparallel Gravity along with its cosmological\nsolutions. We observe that Nonlocal Teleparallel Gravity (like nonlocal General\nRelativity) is consistent with the present cosmological data obtained by SNe Ia\n+ BAO + CC + $H_0$ observations. Along this track, future experiments probing\nnonlocal effects could be used to test whether General Relativity or\nTeleparallel Gravity give the most consistent picture of gravitational\ninteraction.\n", "  Our quantitative understanding of how scientists choose and shift their\nresearch focus over time is highly consequential, because it affects the ways\nin which scientists are trained, science is funded, knowledge is organized and\ndiscovered, and excellence is recognized and rewarded. Despite extensive\ninvestigations of various factors that influence a scientist's choice of\nresearch topics, quantitative assessments of mechanisms that give rise to\nmacroscopic patterns characterizing research interest evolution of individual\nscientists remain limited. Here we perform a large-scale analysis of\npublication records, finding that research interest change follows a\nreproducible pattern characterized by an exponential distribution. We identify\nthree fundamental features responsible for the observed exponential\ndistribution, which arise from a subtle interplay between exploitation and\nexploration in research interest evolution. We develop a random walk based\nmodel, allowing us to accurately reproduce the empirical observations. This\nwork presents a quantitative analysis of macroscopic patterns governing\nresearch interest change, discovering a high degree of regularity underlying\nscientific research and individual careers.\n", "  The state of a single particle injected onto the surface of the Fermi sea is\na pure state if the temperature is zero and is a mixed state if the temperature\nis finite. Moreover, the state of an injected particle is orthogonal to the\nstate of the Fermi sea at zero temperature, while it is not orthogonal at\nnon-zero temperature. These changes in the quantum state of the injected\nparticles can be detected using the temperature dependence of the shot noise\nthat is generated when the particles one by one pass through a semitransparent\nquantum point contact. Namely, the shot noise produced by the mixed state is\nsuppressed in comparison with the noise of the pure state. In addition, the\ncorrelations between the injected particles and the underlying Fermi sea,\npresent at non-zero temperature, do enhance the shot noise. Furthermore,\nantibunching of injected particles with possible thermal excitations coming\nfrom another input channel of a quantum point contact does suppress shot noise.\nHere I analyze in detail these three effects, which are responsible for the\ntemperature dependence of the shot noise, and discuss how to distinguish them\nexperimentally.\n", "  Recent studies reveal that the free eccentricities of Kepler-34b and\nKepler-413b are much larger than their forced eccentricities, implying that the\nscattering events may take place in their formation. The observed orbital\nconfiguration of Kepler-34b cannot be well reproduced in disk-driven migration\nmodels, whereas a two-planet scattering scenario can play a significant role of\nshaping the planetary configuration. These studies indicate that circumbinary\nplanets discovered by Kepler may have experienced scattering process. In this\nwork, we extensively investigate the scattering outcomes of circumbinary\nplanets focusing on the effects of planet mass ratio. We find that the\nplanetary mass ratio and the the initial relative locations of planets act as\ntwo important parameters which affect the eccentricity distribution of the\nsurviving planets. As an application of our model, we discuss the observed\norbital configurations of Kepler-34b and Kepler-413b. We first adopt the\nresults from the disk-driven models as the initial conditions, then simulate\nthe scattering process occurred in the late evolution stage of circumbinary\nplanets. We show that the present orbital configurations of Kepler-34b and\nKepler-413b can be well reproduced when considering two unequal-mass planet\nejection model. Our work further suggests that some of the currently discovered\ncircumbinary single-planet systems may be the survivals of original\nmultiple-planet systems. The disk-driven migration and the scattering events\noccurring in the late stage both play an irreplaceable role in sculpting the\nfinal systems.\n", "  Conventional phased-array metasurfaces utilize resonant nanoparticles or\nnanowaveguides to specify spatially-dependent amplitude and phase responses to\nlight. In nearly all these implementations, subwavelength-scale elements are\nstitched together while minimizing coupling between adjacent elements. In this\nreport, we theoretically analyze an alternate method of metasurface design,\nutilizing freeform inverse design methods, which support significantly enhanced\nefficiencies compared to conventional designs. Our design process optimizes\nwavelength-scale elements, which dramatically increases the design space for\noptical engineering. An in-depth coupled mode analysis of ultra-wide-angle beam\ndeflectors and wavelength splitters shows that the extraordinary performance of\nour designs originates from the large number of propagating modes supported by\nthe metagrating, in combination with complex multiple scattering dynamics\nexhibited by these modes. We also apply our coupled mode analysis to\nconventional nanowaveguide-based metasurfaces to understand and quantify the\nfactors limiting the efficiencies of these devices. We envision that freeform\nmetasurface design methods will open new avenues towards truly\nhigh-performance, multi-functional optics by utilizing strongly coupled\nnanophotonic modes and elements.\n", "  We investigate the decay properties of the quantumness including quantum\nentanglement, quantum discord and quantum coherence for two photonic qubits,\nwhich are partially entangled in their orbital angular momenta, through\nKolmogorov turbulent atmosphere. It is found that the decay of quantum\ncoherence and quantum discord may be qualitatively different from that of\nquantum entanglement when the initial state of two photons is not maximally\nentangled. We also derive two universal decay laws for quantum coherence and\nquantum discord, respectively, and show that the decay of quantum coherence is\nmore robust than nonclassical correlations.\n", "  We study a unique network dataset including periodic surveys and electronic\nlogs of dyadic contacts via smartphones. The participants were a sample of\nfreshmen entering university in the Fall 2011. Their opinions on a variety of\npolitical and social issues and lists of activities on campus were regularly\nrecorded at the beginning and end of each semester for the first three years of\nstudy. We identify a behavioral network defined by call and text data, and a\ncognitive network based on friendship nominations in ego-network surveys. Both\nnetworks are limited to study participants. Since a wide range of attributes on\neach node were collected in self-reports, we refer to these networks as\nattribute-rich networks. We study whether student preferences for certain\nattributes of friends can predict formation and dissolution of edges in both\nnetworks. We introduce a method for computing student preferences for different\nattributes which we use to predict link formation and dissolution. We then rank\nthese attributes according to their importance for making predictions. We find\nthat personal preferences, in particular political views, and preferences for\ncommon activities help predict link formation and dissolution in both the\nbehavioral and cognitive networks.\n", "  Young giant exoplanets emit infrared radiation that can be linearly polarized\nup to several percent. This linear polarization can trace: 1) the presence of\natmospheric cloud and haze layers, 2) spatial structure, e.g. cloud bands and\nrotational flattening, 3) the spin axis orientation and 4) particle sizes and\ncloud top pressure. We introduce a novel high-contrast imaging scheme that\ncombines angular differential imaging (ADI) and accurate near-infrared\npolarimetry to characterize self-luminous giant exoplanets. We implemented this\ntechnique at VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS and developed the corresponding observing\nstrategies, the polarization calibration and the data-reduction approaches. By\ncombining ADI and polarimetry we can characterize planets that can be directly\nimaged with a very high signal-to-noise ratio. We use the IRDIS pupil-tracking\nmode and combine ADI and principal component analysis to reduce speckle noise.\nWe take advantage of IRDIS' dual-beam polarimetric mode to eliminate\ndifferential effects that severely limit the polarimetric sensitivity\n(flat-fielding errors, differential aberrations and seeing), and thus further\nsuppress speckle noise. To correct for instrumental polarization effects, we\napply a detailed Mueller matrix model that describes the telescope and\ninstrument and that has an absolute polarimetric accuracy $\\leq0.1\\%$. Using\nthis technique we have observed the planets of HR 8799 and the (sub-stellar)\ncompanion PZ Tel B. Unfortunately, we do not detect a polarization signal in a\nfirst analysis. We estimate preliminary $1\\sigma$ upper limits on the degree of\nlinear polarization of $\\sim1\\%$ and $\\sim0.1\\%$ for the planets of HR 8799 and\nPZ Tel B, respectively. The achieved sub-percent sensitivity and accuracy show\nthat our technique has great promise for characterizing exoplanets through\ndirect-imaging polarimetry.\n", "  Trending topics are often the result of the spreading of information between\nusers of social networks. These special topics can be regarded as rumors. The\nspreading of a rumor is often studied with the same techniques as in epidemics\nspreading. In order to provide a prediction curve, we implemented an adaptative\nneuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). It is common that many datasets may not\nhave enough measured variables, so we propose a method for obtaining a more\naccurate fitting of a spreaders curve by selecting estimated variables given by\nthe deterministic model. So, in our numerical experimentations, a deterministic\napproach using SIR and SIRS models (with delay) for two different topics is\nused.\n", "  In this work, we shall analyze the effects of quantum fluctuations on the\nproperties of a BTZ black hole, in a massive theory of gravity. We will analyze\nthis for a charged BTZ black hole in asymptotically AdS and dS space-times. The\nquantum fluctuations would produce thermal fluctuations in the thermodynamics\nof this BTZ black hole. As these fluctuations would become relevant at a\nsufficiently small scale, we shall discuss the effects of such thermal\nfluctuations on the entropy of a small charged BTZ black. We shall also analyze\nthe effects of these fluctuations on the stability of such a black hole.\n", "  BPS coherent states closely resemble semiclassical states and they have\ngravity dual descriptions in terms of semiclassical geometries. The half BPS\ncoherent states have been well studied, however less is known about quarter BPS\ncoherent states. Here we provide a construction of quarter BPS coherent states.\nThey are coherent states built with two matrix fields, generalizing the half\nBPS case. These states are both the eigenstates of annihilation operators and\nin the kernel of dilatation operator. Another useful labeling of quarter BPS\nstates is by representations of Brauer algebras and their projection onto a\nsubalgebra $\\mathbb{C}[S_n\\times S_m]$. Here, the Schur-Weyl duality for the\nWalled Brauer algebra plays an important role in organizing the operators. One\ninteresting subclass of these Brauer states are labeled by representations\ninvolving two Young tableaux. We obtain the overlap between quarter BPS Brauer\nstates and quarter BPS coherent states, where the Schur polynomials are used.\nWe also derive superposition formulas transforming a truncated version of\nquarter BPS coherent states to quarter BPS Brauer states. The entanglement\nentropy of Brauer states as well as the overlap between Brauer states and\nsqueezed states are also computed.\n", "  Background: Challenging questions of the $\\alpha$-particle optical-model\npotential (OMP) are still pointed out by recent high-precision measurements of\n$\\alpha$-induced reaction data below the Coulomb barrier. Moreover, the\nreliability of a previous OMP for $\\alpha$-particles on nuclei within the mass\nnumber range 45$\\leq$$A$$\\leq$209 has been recently proved for emitted $\\alpha$\nparticles as well, but only in the case of proton-induced reactions on Zn\nisotopes [Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 91}, 064611 (2015), Paper I].\n  Purpose: Analysis of most recent $(\\alpha,\\gamma)$ reaction data for Ge and\nZr isotopes, which provides an additional validation of the above-mentioned\npotential, is related to a further account of $\\alpha$-particle emission in\nneutron-induced reactions on Zr isotopes, at the same time with a suitable\ndescription of all competitive processes.\n  Methods: A consistent parameter set, established or validated by independent\nanalysis of recent various data, particularly $\\gamma$-ray strength functions,\nhave been involved within model calculation of the $(\\alpha,\\gamma)$ as well as\n$(n,\\alpha)$ reaction cross sections. The latter are part of the whole analysis\nof the neutron activation of Zr isotopes, in order to avoid any error\ncompensation or latent ambiguity.\n  Results: The aforesaid potential provides a consistent description of recent\n$\\alpha$-induced reaction data with no empirical rescaling factors of the\n$\\gamma$ and/or nucleon widths. On the other hand, its use leads to\nunderestimated predictions of the pre-equilibrium emission and statistical\nmodels for the $(n,\\alpha)$ reaction cross sections.\n  Conclusions: An optical potential with a volume imaginary component seems to\nbe needed to describe the low-energy $\\alpha$-particle evaporation, while only\nsurface absorption occurs in $\\alpha$-induced reactions at similar energies.\n", "  It is a challenging task to detect genuine multipartite nolocality (GMNL). In\nthis paper, the problem is considered via computing the maximal quantum value\nof Svetlichny operators for three-qubit systems and a tight upper bound is\nobtained. The constraints on the quantum states for the tightness of the bound\nare also presented. The approach enables us to give the necessary and\nsufficient conditions of violating the Svetlichny inequalities (SI) for several\nquantum states, including the white and color noised GHZ states. The relation\nbetween the genuine multipartite entanglement concurrence and the maximal\nquantum value of the Svetlichny operators for mixed GHZ class states is also\ndiscussed. As the SI is useful for the investigation on GMNL, our results give\nan effective and operational method to detect the GMNL for three-qubit mixed\nstates.\n", "  Cell migration and mechanics are tightly regulated by the integrated\nactivities of the various cytoskeletal networks. In cancer cells, cytoskeletal\nmodulations have been implicated in the loss of tissue integrity, and\nacquisition of an invasive phenotype. In epithelial cancers, for example,\nincreased expression of the cytoskeletal filament protein vimentin correlates\nwith metastatic potential. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism whereby vimentin\naffects cell motility remains poorly understood. In this study, we measured the\neffects of vimentin expression on the mechano-elastic and migratory properties\nof the highly invasive breast carcinoma cell line MDA231. We demonstrate here\nthat vimentin stiffens cells and enhances cell migration in dense cultures, but\nexerts little or no effect on the migration of sparsely plated cells. These\nresults suggest that cell-cell interactions play a key role in regulating cell\nmigration, and coordinating cell movement in dense cultures. Our findings pave\nthe way towards understanding the relationship between cell migration and\nmechanics, in a biologically relevant context.\n", "  In the last decade the detection of individual massive dark matter sub-halos\nhas been possible using potential correction formalism in strong gravitational\nlens imaging. Here we propose a statistical formalism to relate strong\ngravitational lens surface brightness anomalies to the lens potential\nfluctuations arising from dark matter distribution in the lens galaxy. We\nconsider these fluctuations as a Gaussian random field in addition to the\nunperturbed smooth lens model. This is very similar to weak lensing formalism\nand we show that in this way we can measure the power spectrum of these\nperturbations to the potential. We test the method by applying it to simulated\nmock lenses of different geometries and by performing an MCMC analysis of the\ntheoretical power spectra. This method can measure density fluctuations in\nearly type galaxies on scales of 1-10 kpc at typical rms-levels of a percent,\nusing a single lens system observed with the Hubble Space Telescope with\ntypical signal-to-noise ratios obtained in a single orbit.\n", "  We present two particular decoding procedures for reconstructing a quantum\nstate from the Hawking radiation in the Hayden-Preskill thought experiment. We\nwork in an idealized setting and represent the black hole and its entangled\npartner by $n$ EPR pairs. The first procedure teleports the state thrown into\nthe black hole to an outside observer by post-selecting on the condition that a\nsufficient number of EPR pairs remain undisturbed. The probability of this\nfavorable event scales as $1/d_{A}^2$, where $d_A$ is the Hilbert space\ndimension for the input state. The second procedure is deterministic and\ncombines the previous idea with Grover's search. The decoding complexity is\n$\\mathcal{O}(d_{A}\\mathcal{C})$ where $\\mathcal{C}$ is the size of the quantum\ncircuit implementing the unitary evolution operator $U$ of the black hole. As\nwith the original (non-constructive) decoding scheme, our algorithms utilize\nscrambling, where the decay of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) guarantees\nfaithful state recovery.\n", "  Recently, Motes et al. proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 170802 (2015) a\nlinear optics interferometer with N identical single photon input states as a\ntool for sub-shot-noise phase estimation which does not require NOON states\nsources. This thesis investigates how the degree of distinguishability between\nthe input photonic spectra affects the interferometric phase sensitivity, by\nemploying the results obtained by Tamma and Laibacher in Phys. Rev. Lett. 114,\n243601 (2015). Remarkably, the obtained results show, that for small phases,\nthe phase sensitivity in the case of completely distinguishable photons is\nidentical to the one in the case of identical photons considered by Motes et\nal. apart from a constant factor that is independent of the number N of input\nphotons. Consequently, multiphoton interference does not provide in the scheme\nproposed by Motes et al. any sub-shot-noise sensitivity for a large number N of\nphotons.\n", "  We consider the noncommutative Standard Model that contains Lorentz symmetry\nviolation as a subset of the Standard Model extension. We introduce a constant\nelectromagnetic field as a background to derive mutual relations between the\nfree parameters of both theories. As the Lorentz violation parameters of the\nStandard Model extension are extensively explored in different experiments and\nmany stringent bounds on these parameters are available, we can find new bounds\non the scale of noncommutativity of the order of a few to tens of teraelectron\nvolts.\n", "  This is the revised version of Sect. I - IV of the paper\nhttps://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.125022 originally published in 2014. The\nthing is that in https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.125022 the text was\ninsufficiently clear and, in addition, it contained (through my fault) a few\ntypos. This is the reason why I decided to offer a revised version.\n  Original abstract: This is the eighth paper in the series devoted to the\nsystematic study of effective theories. Below, I discuss the renormalization of\nthe one-loop two-leg functions in multicomponent effective scalar theory. It is\nshown that only a part of numerous contributions that appear in the general\nexpression for a two-leg graph can be considered as the true self-energy\nfunction. This part is completely fixed by the values of minimal coupling\nconstants; it is the only one that should be taken into account in the\nconventional process of the summation of Dyson's chain that results in explicit\nexpression for the full propagator. The other parts provide the well-defined\nfinite corrections for the graphs with the number of legs n > 2. It is also\nshown that there is no need to attract the renormalization prescriptions for\nthe higher derivatives of the two-leg function on the mass shell; the\nrequirements of finiteness and diagonability turn out to be quite sufficient.\n", "  Two twin binaries, KIC 4826439 and KIC 6045264, with very similar component\nstars were found photometrically based on $\\textit{Kepler}$ eclipsing binary\nlight curves. The absolute parameters of the massive components are\n1.156(0.03)$M_\\odot$, 1.881(0.02)$R_\\odot$, 6065K for KIC 4826439, and\n0.874(0.3)$M_\\odot$, 1.206(0.02)$R_\\odot$, 6169(30)K for KIC 6045264. The\ndifferences between the components are less than two percents for all the\nparameters. A very low proportion of the twin binaries ($2/1592\\approx0.13\\%$)\nwas found, which does not support the previous findings of the excesses of\ntwins on binary mass ratio distribution, but support a deficiently low\nproportion of twins. A new method is practiced to work out the absolute\nparameters of the two twins without the radial velocities. This method requires\nthe solution of the light curves, the spectra and the evolutionary isochrones\nof covering the complete stellar parameter space, simultaneously. We also\nstudied their evolution tracks that: KIC 4826439 will experience an unstable\nmass transfer stage followed by an unclear ending, and KIC 6045264 will become\na single star via an over-contact phase. It seems highly unlikely that the two\ntwin binaries will produce twin degenerate binaries, although they have quite\nsimilar components.\n", "  We present results obtained from a Suzaku observation of the accretion\npowered X-ray pulsar GX 1+4. Broad-band continuum spectrum of the pulsar was\nfound to be better described by a simple model consisting of a blackbody\ncomponent and an exponential cutoff power-law than the previously used compTT\ncontinuum model. Though the pulse profile had a sharp dip in soft X-rays ($<$10\nkeV), phase-resolved spectroscopy confirmed that the dimming was not due to\nincrease in photoelectric absorption. Phase-sliced spectral analysis showed the\npresence of a significant spectral modulation beyond 10 keV except for the dip\nphase. A search for the presence of cyclotron resonance scattering feature in\nthe Suzaku spectra yielded a negative result. Iron K-shell (K$_\\alpha$ and\nK$_\\beta$) emission lines from nearly neutral iron ions ($<$Fe III) were\nclearly detected in the source spectrum. A significant K$_\\alpha$ emission line\nfrom almost neutral Ni atoms was detected for the first time in this source. We\nestimated the iron abundance of $\\sim$80 % of the solar value and Ni/Fe\nabundance ratio of about two times of the solar value. We searched for a iron\nLy$_\\alpha$ emission line and found a significant improvement in the spectral\nfitting by inclusion of this line.\n", "  The radial drift problem constitutes one of the most fundamental problems in\nplanet formation theory, as it predicts particles to drift into the star before\nthey are able to grow to planetesimal size. Dust-trapping vortices have been\nproposed as a possible solution to this problem, as they might be able to trap\nparticles over millions of years, allowing them to grow beyond the radial drift\nbarrier. Here, we present ALMA 0.04\"-resolution imaging of the pre-transitional\ndisk of V1247 Orionis that reveals an asymmetric ring as well as a\nsharply-confined crescent structure, resembling morphologies seen in\ntheoretical models of vortex formation. The asymmetric ring (at 0.17\"=54 au\nseparation from the star) and the crescent (at 0.38\"=120 au) seem smoothly\nconnected through a one-armed spiral arm structure that has been found\npreviously in scattered light. We propose a physical scenario with a planet\norbiting at $\\sim0.3$\"$\\approx$100 au, where the one-armed spiral arm detected\nin polarised light traces the accretion stream feeding the protoplanet. The\ndynamical influence of the planet clears the gap between the ring and the\ncrescent and triggers two vortices that trap mm-sized particles, namely the\ncrescent and the bright asymmetry seen in the ring. We conducted dedicated\nhydrodynamics simulations of a disk with an embedded planet, which results in\nsimilar spiral-arm morphologies as seen in our scattered light images. At the\nposition of the spiral wake and the crescent we also observe $^{12}$CO (3-2)\nand H$^{12}$CO$^{+}$ (4-3) excess line emission, likely tracing the increased\nscale-height in these disk regions.\n", "  The Born rule assigns a probability to any possible outcome of a quantum\nmeasurement, but leaves open the question how these probabilities are to be\ninterpreted and, in particular, how they relate to the outcome observed in an\nactual experiment. We propose to avoid this question by replacing the Born rule\nwith two non-probabilistic postulates: (i) the projector associated to the\nobserved outcome must have a positive overlap with the state of the measured\nsystem; (ii) statements about observed outcomes are robust, that is, remain\nvalid under small perturbations of the state. We show that the two postulates\nsuffice to retrieve the interpretations of the Born rule that are commonly used\nfor analysing experimental data.\n", "  Several methods exist for finding ground (as well as excited) states of\nnonlinear waves equations. In this paper we first introduce two modifications\nof the so-called accelerated imaginary-time evolution method (AITEM). In our\nfirst modification, time integration of the underlying gradient flow is done\nusing exponential time differencing instead of using more standard methods. In\nthe second modification, we present a generalization of the gradient flow\nmodel, motivated by the work of Nesterov, as well as that of Candes and\ncollaborators. Additionally, we consider combinations of these methods with the\nso-called spectral renormalization scheme. Finally, we apply these techniques\nto the so-called Squared Operator Method, enabling convergence to excited\nstates. Various examples are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of these new\nschemes, comparing them to standard ones established in the literature. In most\ncases, we find significant reductions in the number of iterations needed to\nreach convergence.\n", "  Common substitutional isovalent semiconductor alloys usually form disordered\nmetastable phases with positive excess formation enthalpies ({\\Delta}H). In\ncontrast, monolayer alloys of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX2 (M =\nMo, W; X = S, Se) always have negative {\\Delta}H, suggesting atomic ordering,\nwhich is, however, not yet experimentally observed. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we find that the negative {\\Delta}H of cation-mixed TMD alloys\nresults from the charge transfer from weak Mo-X to nearest strong W-X bonds and\nthe negative {\\Delta}H of anion-mixed TMD alloys comes from the larger energy\ngain due to the charge transfer from Se to nearest S atoms than the energy cost\ndue to the lattice mismatch. Consequently, cation-mixed and anion-mixed alloys\nshould energetically prefer to have Mo-X-W and S-M-Se ordering, respectively.\nThe atomic ordering, however, is only locally ordered but disordered in the\nlong range due to the symmetry of TMD monolayers, as demonstrated by many\nenergetically degenerate structures for given alloy compositions. Besides, the\nlocal ordering and disordering effects on the macroscopic properties such as\nbandgaps and optical absorptions are negligible, making the experimental\nobservation of locally ordered TMD alloys challenging. We propose to take the\nadvantage of microscopic properties such as defects which strongly depend on\nlocal atomic configurations for experiments to identify the disordering and\nlocal ordering in TMD alloys. Finally, quaternary TMD alloys by mixing both\ncations and anions are studied to have a wide range of bandgaps for\noptoelectronic applications. Our work is expected to help the formation and\nutilization of TMD alloys.\n", "  We propose a portable cartridge based lab-on-a-chip platform. The main\nsensing mechanism uses high frequency acoustic waves. Feasibility of two\ndifferent transducers has been investigated for biological measurements. We\nused zincoxide (ZnO) based piezoelectric transducers for blood coagulation time\nmeasurements. The method is based on the measurement of amplitude of acoustic\nreflections from a microfluidic channel which is filled with blood. The volume\nof the microfluidic channel could be as low as 1 micro-litre. A low cost\ndisposable cartridge made of glass has been designed to perform the\nmeasurements. The cartridge is composed of two glass substrates and a double\nsided tape layer where the channel is defined. One of the glass substrates has\na micromachined ZnO based transducer that operates at 400 MHz on the outer\nsurface of the cartridge where electrical connections are also provided. The\ntransducer is aligned with the channel to generate acoustic pulses in the fluid\nthat is filling the channel. The reflections coming from the top of the channel\npropagate through the liquid therefore their amplitude and phase are affected\nby the fluid properties. In the experiments whole blood was used without any\nsample preparation. The viscosity of the blood changes during coagulation\ntherefore by monitoring the amplitude of the reflection coming from the top of\nthe channel one can measure the coagulation time. The method which requires\nonly 1 micro-litre of blood has been tested with calcium and activated partial\nthromboplastin (aPTT) reagents. The proposed method has a potential to be used\nin a low cost portable coagulation time measurement system for patient\nself-testing. The second transducer was made of CMUTs (Capacitive Micromachined\nUltrasonic Transducers). We introduce this technology for immersion in liquids\nas a biological sensor for viscosity measurements.\n", "  Evidence is presented of universal behavior in modulationally unstable media.\nAn ensemble of nonlinear evolution equations, including three partial\ndifferential equations, an integro-differential equation, a nonlocal system and\na differential-difference equation, is studied. Collectively, these systems\narise in a variety of applications in the physical and mathematical sciences,\nincluding water waves, optics, acoustics, Bose-Einstein condensation, and more.\nAll these models exhibit modulational instability, namely, the property that a\nconstant background is unstable to long-wavelength perturbations. In this work,\neach of these systems is studied analytically and numerically for a number of\ndifferent initial perturbations of the constant background, and it is shown\nthat, for all systems and for all initial conditions considered, the dynamics\ngives rise to a remarkably similar structure comprised of two outer, quiescent\nsectors separated by a wedge-shaped central region characterized by modulated\nperiodic oscillations. A heuristic criterion that allows one to compute some of\nthe properties of the central oscillation region is also given.\n", "  Increasing the efficiency of directional design of functional materials is a\nchallenging work in theory, whose performance and stability are determined by\ndifferent factors entangled with each other complicatedly. In this work, we\napply the Pareto Optimization based on the Pareto Efficiency and Particle-Swarm\nOptimization to design new functional materials directionally. As a\ndemonstration, we apply the method to the thermoelectric design of 2D SnSe\nmaterials and identify several novel structures with lower free energy and\nbetter thermoelectric performance than the experimental monolayer structure in\ntheory. We hope the multi-objective Pareto Optimization method can make the\nintegrative design of multi-objective and multi-functional materials a reality.\n", "  A semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) protocol allows a quantum user and a\nlimited \"classical\" user to establish a shared secret key secure against an\nall-powerful adversary. In this work, we present a new SQKD protocol where the\nquantum user is also limited in her measurement capabilities. We describe the\nprotocol, prove its security, and show its noise tolerance is as high as \"fully\nquantum\" QKD protocols.\n", "  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for pancreatic cancer requires a\nskillful approach to deliver ablative doses to the tumor while limiting dose to\nthe highly sensitive duodenum, stomach, and small bowel. Here, we develop\nknowledge-based artificial neural network dose models (ANN-DMs) to predict dose\ndistributions that would be approved by experienced physicians. Using dose\ndistributions calculated by a commercial treatment planning system (TPS),\nphysician-approved treatment plans were used to train ANN-DMs that could\npredict physician-approved dose distributions based on a set of geometric\nparameters (vary from voxel to voxel) and plan parameters (constant across all\nvoxels for a given patient). Differences between TPS and ANN-DM dose\ndistributions were used to evaluate model performance. ANN-DM design, including\nneural network structure and parameter choices, were evaluated to optimize dose\nmodel performance. Mean dose errors were less than 5% at all distances from the\nPTV, and mean absolute dose errors were on the order of 5%, but no more than\n10%. Dose-volume histogram errors demonstrated good model performance above 25\nGy, but much larger errors were seen at lower doses. ANN-DM dose distributions\nshowed excellent overall agreement with TPS dose distributions, and accuracy\nwas substantially improved when each physician's treatment approach was taken\ninto account by training their own dedicated models. In this manner, one could\nfeasibly train ANN-DMs that could predict the dose distribution desired by a\ngiven physician for a given treatment site.\n", "  With the nonuniform media taken into account, the nonisospectral and\nvariable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation, which describes various\nphysical situations such as fluid dynamics and plasma, is under investigation\nin this paper. With appropriate selection of wave functions, the Darboux\ntransformation is constructed, by which the multi-soliton solutions are derived\nand graphs are presented. The spectral parameters, coefficients and initial\nphase are discussed analytically and numerically to demonstrate their\nrespective effect on the soliton dynamics, which plays a role in achieving the\nfeasible soliton management with explicit conditions taken into account.\n", "  We obtain sufficient conditions that ensure block diagonalization (by a\ndirect rotation) of sign-indefinite symmetric sesquilinear forms as well as the\nassociated operators that are semi-bounded neither from below nor from above.\nIn the semi-bounded case, we refine the obtained results and, as an example,\nrevisit the block Stokes Operator from fluid dynamics.\n", "  Under investigation in this paper is the nonisospectral and variable\ncoefficients modified Kortweg-de Vries (vc-mKdV) equation, which manifests in\ndiverse areas of physics such as fluid dynamics, ion acoustic solitons and\nplasma mechanics. With the degrees of restriction reduced, a simplified\nconstraint is introduced, under which the vc-mKdV equation is an integrable\nsystem and the spectral flow is time-varying. The Darboux transformation for\nsuch equation is constructed, which gives rise to the generation of variable\nkinds of solutions including the double-breather coherent structure, periodical\nsoliton-breather and localized solitons and breathers. In addition, the effect\nof variable coefficients and initial phases is discussed in terms of the\nsoliton amplitude, polarity, velocity and width, which might provide feasible\nsoliton management with certain conditions taken into account.\n", "  Nanodiamonds have emerged as promising materials for quantum computing,\nbiolabeling, and sensing due to their ability to host color centers with\nremarkable photostability and long spin-coherence times at room temperature.\nRecently, a bottom-up, high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) approach was\ndemonstrated for growing nanodiamonds with color centers from amorphous carbon\nprecursors in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LH-DAC) that was supported by\na near-hydrostatic noble gas pressure medium. However, a detailed understanding\nof the photothermal heating and its effect on diamond growth, including the\nphase conversion conditions and the temperature-dependence of color center\nformation, has not been reported. In this work, we measure blackbody radiation\nduring LH-DAC synthesis of nanodiamond from carbon aerogel to examine these\ntemperature-dependent effects. Blackbody temperature measurements suggest that\nnanodiamond growth can occur at 16.3 GPa and 1800 K. We use Mie theory and\nanalytical heat transport to develop a predictive photothermal heating model.\nThis model demonstrates that melting the noble gas pressure medium during laser\nheating decreases the local thermal conductivity to drive a high spatial\nresolution of phase conversion to diamond. Finally, we observe a\ntemperature-dependent formation of nitrogen vacancy centers and interpret this\nphenomenon in the context of HPHT carbon vacancy diffusion using CB{\\Omega}\ntheory.\n", "  Nonlocal gradient operators are basic elements of nonlocal vector calculus\nthat play important roles in nonlocal modeling and analysis. In this work, we\nextend earlier analysis on nonlocal gradient operators. In particular, we study\na nonlocal Dirichlet integral that is given by a quadratic energy functional\nbased on nonlocal gradients. Our main finding, which differs from claims made\nin previous studies, is that the coercivity and stability of this nonlocal\ncontinuum energy functional may hold for some properly chosen nonlocal\ninteraction kernels but may fail for some other ones. This can be significant\nfor possible applications of nonlocal gradient operators in various nonlocal\nmodels. In particular, we discuss some important implications for the\nperidynamic correspondence material models.\n", "  These lectures, presented at TASI 2016: Anticipating the Next Discoveries in\nParticle Physics, provide an introduction to some key methods and tools of\nindirect dark matter searches. Topics covered include estimation of dark matter\nsignals, thermal freezeout and related scenarios, potential effects of dark\nmatter annihilation on the early universe, modeling photon signals from\nannihilation or decay, and a brief and qualitative introduction to diffusive\npropagation of cosmic rays. The second half of the notes gives a status report\n(circa summer 2016) on selected experimental searches, the resulting\nconstraints and some potential signal candidates. These notes are intended as\nan introduction to indirect dark matter searches for graduate students,\nfocusing on back-of-the-envelope estimates and useful concepts rather than\ndetailed quantitative computations.\n", "  Using the coalescence model based on the phase-space distribution of nucleons\nfrom an extended blast-wave model that includes the space-momentum correlation\nof high momentum nucleons, we study the transverse momentum spectra and\nelliptic flows of deuteron and helium-3 in Pb+Pb collisions at the energy\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find that the measured elliptic flows of deuteron\ncan be satisfactorily described if nucleons of large transverse momenta are\nmore spread in space when their momenta are more aligned along the reaction\nplane.\n", "  Topological semimetals, including Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, and\nnodal line semimetals, receive enormous research interest due to their\nintrinsic topological nature and fascinating properties. In present work, with\nthe help of density functional theory (DFT), we find that nodal line semimetals\nand Dirac semimetals can coexist in the low energy electron of two dimensional\n(2D) monolayer B2C. Intriguingly, besides type-I and type-II Dirac fermions, a\nkind of open nodal line appears around the Fermi level. The low energy\nelectronic nature of B2C sheet can be described by a tight-binding (TB) model\nrelied on the basis of B-py, pz and C-py, pz states. One of the most merit of\nthe system is that the energy windows of these four types topological\nsemimetals are different that can be easily distinguished in experiments.\nMoreover, the system provides an excellent platform for studying the interplay\nbetween different type semimetals.\n", "  Cable-in-Conduit Conductors (CICCs) are used in the fabrication of\nsuperconducting fusion grade magnets. It acts as a narrow cryostat to provide\ncryo-stability with direct contact of coolant fluid to conductor. The\nsuperconducting magnets are cooled using forced flow (FF), supercritical helium\nor two phase (TP) cooling through void space in the CICC. Thermo-hydraulics\nusing supercritical helium single phase flow is well-known and established.\nResearch topic of behavior of forced flow, two phase (TP) helium cooling in\nCICC involves perceived risks of the CICC running into flow chocking and\npossible thermo-acoustic oscillations leading to flow instabilities. This\nresearch work involves study of forced flow two phase helium cooling in CICC\nwound superconducting magnets. The TP flow provides cryo-stability by the\nlatent heat of helium not by enthalpy as in case of CICC being cooled with\nsupercritical helium. Study reveals some attractive regimes in the case of TP\ncooling, at a given mass flow rate of single phase helium at the inlet and a\nheat flux acting on the CICC. Analysis carried out predicts significant gains\nwith TP cooling on a prototype CICC, which is circular in cross section and\nappropriate for fusion devices for high magnetic field applications. These\ngeneral formalisms may be extended to specific magnets wound with CICC. This\npaper describes analysis of TP cooling of a CICC.\n", "  The aim of the paper is to propose an algorithm based on the Multispin Coding\ntechnique for the Kob-Andersen glassy dynamics. We first give motivations to\nspeed up the numerical simulation in the context of spin glass models [M.\nMezard, G. Parisi, M. Virasoro, Spin Glass Theory and Beyond (World Scientific,\nSingapore, 1987)], after defining the Markovian dynamics as in [W. Kob, H.C.\nAndersen, Phys. Rev. E 48, 4364 (1993)] as well as the related interesting\nobservables, we extend it to the more general framework of random regular\ngraphs, listing at the same time some known analytical results [C. Toninelli,\nG. Biroli, D.S. Fisher, J. Stat. Phys. 120, 167 (2005)]. The purpose of this\nwork is a dual one, firstly, we describe how bitwise operators can be used to\nbuild up the algorithm by carefully exploiting the way data are stored on a\ncomputer. Since it was first introduced [M. Creutz, L. Jacobs, C. Rebbi, Phys.\nRev. D 20, 1915 (1979), C. Rebbi, R.H. Swendsen, Phys. Rev. D 21, 4094 (1980)],\nthis technique has been widely used to perform Monte Carlo simulations for\nIsing and Potts spin systems, however, it can be successfully adapted to more\ncomplex systems in which microscopic parameters may assume boolean values.\nSecondly, we introduce a random graph in which a characteristic para- meter\nallows to tune the possible transition point. A consistent part is devoted to\nlisting the numerical results obtained by running numerical simulations.\n", "  Superconducting transport properties of granular materials are greatly\ninfluenced by the microstructure. We show that in heavily boron-doped diamond\nfilms (HBDDF) films some sharp transport features can be manipulated by\napplying a magnetic field and controlled finite bias current. We demonstrate\nthe conductivity cross-over from dirty metal to the superconducting state\nthrough an insulating peak arising at a very low current or magnetic field\nregion and particularly pronounced negative magnetoresistance with periodic\noscillatory features. The current-voltage characteristics show features of the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transitions which verifies the\ntwo-dimensional structure in HBDDF observed recently. A zero bias conductance\npeak can be attributed to the Andreev bound state formed at the grain\nboundaries of diamond nanocrystals. The set of observations can be\nqualitatively explained consistently through the concept of a superconducting\ntransition with a non-s wave order parameter in the diamond heterostructures.\n", "  We study mechanical behavior of soft rubber-like digital materials used in\nPolyjet multi-material 3D-printing to create deformable composite materials and\nflexible structures. These soft digital materials are frequently treated as\nlinear elastic materials in the literature. However, our experiments clearly\nshow that these materials exhibit significant non-linearities under large\nstrain regime. Moreover, the materials demonstrate pronounced rate-dependent\nbehavior. In particular, their instantaneous moduli as well as ultimate strain\nand stress significantly depend on the strain rate. To take into account both\nhyper- and viscoelasticity phenomena, we employ the Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic\n(QLV) model with instantaneous Yeoh strain-energy density function. We show\nthat the QLV-Yeoh model accurately describes the mechanical behavior of the\nmajority of the soft digital materials under uniaxial tension.\n", "  I give a brief review of a few recent developments and future directions in\nthe search for dark matter using high-energy neutrinos from the Sun. This\nincludes the ability to recast neutrino telescope limits on nuclear scattering\nof dark matter to arbitrary new theories, and new calculations of the solar\natmospheric background relevant to such searches. I also touch on applications\nto global searches for new physics, and prospects for improving searches for\nasymmetric dark matter in the Sun.\n", "  Rubber compounds for pressure sealing application typically have inferior\ndimensional stability with temperature fluctuations compared with their steel\ncounterparts. This effect may result in seal leakage failures when subjected to\ndecreases in temperature. Composites of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber\n(HNBR) and zirconium tungstate as a negative thermal expansion filler were\nprepared in order to control the thermal expansivity of the material. The\namount of zirconium tungstate (ZrW2O8) was varied in the range of 0 to about 40\nvol%. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), bulk modulus, uniaxial\nextension and compression set properties were measured. The CTE of the\nZrW2O8-filled HNBR decreases with the filler content and it is reduced by a\nfactor of 2 at the highest filler concentration used. The filler effect on CTE\nis found to be stronger when HNBR is below the glass transition temperature.\nThe experimental thermal expansion data of the composites are compared with the\ntheoretical estimates and predictions given by FEA. The effect of ZrW2O8 on the\nmechanical characteristics and compression set of these materials is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  Matter exhibits phases and their transitions. These transitions are\nclassified as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones. While\nthe latter has a well-established theory of the renormalization group, the\nformer is only qualitatively accounted for by classical theories of nucleation,\nsince their predictions often disagree with experiments by orders of magnitude.\nA theory to integrate FOPTs into the framework of the renormalization-group\ntheory has been proposed but seems to contradict with extant wisdom and lacks\nnumerical evidence. Here we show that universal hysteresis scaling as predicted\nby the renormalization-group theory emerges unambiguously when the theory is\ncombined intimately with the theory of nucleation and growth in the FOPTs of\nthe paradigmatic two-dimensional Ising model driven by a linearly varying\nexternally applied field below its critical point. This not only provides a new\nmethod to rectify the nucleation theories, but also unifies the theories for\nboth classes of transitions and FOPTs can be studied using universality and\nscaling similar to their continuous counterpart.\n", "  The paper by Popova et al. presents an oversimplified mathematical model of\nsolar activity with a claim of predicting/postdicting it for several millennia\nahead/backwards. The work contains several flaws devaluating the results: (1)\nthe method is unreliable from the point of view of signal processing (it is\nimpossible to make harmonic predictions for thousands of years based on only 35\nyears of data) and lacks quality control, (2) the result of post-diction\napparently contradicts the observational data. (3) theoretical speculations\nmake little sense, To summarize, a multi-harmonic mathematical model, hardly\nrelated to full solar dynamo theory, is presented, which is not applicable to\nrealistic solar conditions because of the significant chaotic/stochastic\nintrinsic component and strong non-stationarity of solar activity. The obtained\nresult is apparently inconsistent with the data in the past and thus cannot be\ntrusted for the future predictions.\n", "  Addressing the optical properties of a single nanoparticle in the infrared is\nparticularly challenging, thus alternative methods for characterizing the\nconductance spectrum of nanoparticles in this spectral range need to be\ndeveloped. Here we describe an efficient method of fabricating single\nnanoparticle tunnel junctions on a chip circuit. We apply this method to narrow\nband gap nanoparticles of HgSe, which band structure combine the inverted\ncharacter of the bulk semimetal with quantum confinement and self-doping. Upon\ntuning the gate bias, measurement reveals the presence of two energy gaps in\nthe spectrum. The wider gap results from the interband gap, while the narrower\ngap results from intraband transitions. The observation of the latter near zero\ngate voltage confirms the doped character of the nanoparticle at the single\nparticle level, which is in full agreement with the ensemble optical and\ntransport measurements. Finally we probe the phototransport within a single\nquantum dot and demonstrate a large photogain mechanism resulting from\nphotogating.\n", "  Speech on the occasion of accepting the Dagmar and Vaclav Havel Foundation\nVIZE 97 Prize for 2017. Delivered at Prague Crossroads, October 5, 2017\n", "  A list of searches is presented for massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ,\nZZ, WH, ZH and HH boson pairs in proton-proton collision data collected by the\nCMS experiment at the LHC. The data are taken at centre-of-mass energies of\n13TeV, corresponding to respective integrated luminosities of 12.9/fb(ICHEP)\nand up to 35.9/fb. The results are interpreted in the context of heavy vector\ntriplet and singlet models that mimic properties of composite-Higgs models\npredicting W' and Z' bosons decaying to WZ, WW, WH, and ZH bosons. A model with\na bulk graviton that decays into WW and ZZ is also considered. Upper limits are\nset on the production cross section of the two models and no evidence is found\nfor a signal.\n", "  ATLAS is making extensive efforts towards preparing a detector upgrade for\nthe high luminosity operations of the LHC (HL-LHC), which will commence\noperation in about 10 years. The current ATLAS Inner Detector will be replaced\nby an all-silicon tracker (comprising an inner Pixel tracker and outer Strip\ntracker). The software currently used for the new silicon tracker is broadly\ninherited from that used for the LHC Run-1 and Run-2, but many new developments\nhave been made to better fulfill the future detector and operation\nrequirements. One aspect in particular which will be highlighted is the\nsimulation software for the Strip tracker. The available geometry description\nsoftware (including the detailed description for all the sensitive elements,\nthe services, etc.) did not allow for accurate modelling of the planned\ndetector design. A range of sensors/layouts for the Strip tracker are being\nconsidered and must be studied in detailed simulations in order to assess the\nperformance and ascertain that requirements are met. For this, highly\nflexibility geometry building is required from the simulation software. A new\nXml-based detector description framework has been developed to meet the\naforementioned challenges. We will present the design of the framework and its\nvalidation results.\n", "  Self-reflection is important metacognitive skill, enabling students to build\ncoherence into their learning and embed content in a broader context. While\nvarious pedagogical techniques exist to encourage student reflection, little\nresearch has examined the differences between formally guided, partially guided\nand unguided reflections. This study focuses on student responses to online\nGuided Reflection Forms (GRFs) from students in a first-semester non-physics\nclass and, separately, a sophomore-level Vibrations \\& Waves course for physics\nmajors, and compares these guided reflections with partially guided and\nunguided journals from a STEM enrichment summer program for incoming college\nstudents. A previously developed coding scheme was used on guided reflections\nand the {\\bf LIWC} computational linguistics tool used to confirm the distinct\nnature of the categories. A new coding scheme was created and validated for the\nunguided journals. We find that both guided and unguided reflections elicit\nmetacognitive and reflective practice, although of measurably different\nfrequencies and kinds.\n", "  Spreading is a ubiquitous process in the social, biological and technological\nsystems. Therefore, identifying influential spreaders, which is important to\nprevent epidemic spreading and to establish effective vaccination strategies,\nis full of theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, a weighted\nh-index centrality based on virtual nodes extension is proposed to quantify the\nspreading influence of nodes in complex networks. Simulation results on\nreal-world networks reveal that the proposed method provides more accurate and\nmore consistent ranking than the five classical methods. Moreover, we observe\nthat the monotonicity and the computational complexity of our measure can also\nyield excellent performance.\n", "  Coronal Bright Fronts (CBF) are large-scale wavelike disturbances in the\nsolar corona, related to solar eruptions. They are observed in extreme\nultraviolet (EUV) light as transient bright fronts of finite width, propagating\naway from the eruption source. Recent studies of individual solar eruptive\nevents have used EUV observations of CBFs and metric radio type II burst\nobservations to show the intimate connection between low coronal waves and\ncoronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shocks. EUV imaging with the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly(AIA) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has\nproven particularly useful for detecting CBFs, which, combined with radio and\nin situ observations, holds great promise for early CME-driven shock\ncharacterization capability. This characterization can further be automated,\nand related to models of particle acceleration to produce estimates of particle\nfluxes in the corona and in the near Earth environment early in events. We\npresent a framework for the Coronal Analysis of SHocks and Waves (CASHeW). It\ncombines analysis of NASA Heliophysics System Observatory data products and\nrelevant data-driven models, into an automated system for the characterization\nof off-limb coronal waves and shocks and the evaluation of their capability to\naccelerate solar energetic particles (SEPs). The system utilizes EUV\nobservations and models written in the Interactive Data Language (IDL). In\naddition, it leverages analysis tools from the SolarSoft package of libraries,\nas well as third party libraries. We have tested the CASHeW framework on a\nrepresentative list of coronal bright front events. Here we present its\nfeatures, as well as initial results. With this framework, we hope to\ncontribute to the overall understanding of coronal shock waves, their\nimportance for energetic particle acceleration, as well as to the better\nability to forecast SEP events fluxes.\n", "  We propose ultranarrow dynamical control of population oscillation (PO)\nbetween ground states through the polarization content of an input bichromatic\nfield. Appropriate engineering of classical interference between optical fields\nresults in PO arising exclusively from optical pumping. Contrary to the\nexpected broad spectral response associated with optical pumping, we obtain\nsubnatural linewidth in complete absence of quantum interference. The\nellipticity of the light polarizations can be used for temporal shaping of the\nPO leading to generation of multiple sidebands even at low light level.\n", "  The selection of beam orientations, which is a key step in radiation\ntreatment planning, is particularly challenging for non-coplanar radiotherapy\nsystems due to the large number of candidate beams. In this paper, we report\nprogress on the group sparsity approach to beam orientation optimization,\nwherein beam angles are selected by solving a large scale fluence map\noptimization problem with an additional group sparsity penalty term that\nencourages most candidate beams to be inactive. The optimization problem is\nsolved using an accelerated proximal gradient method, the Fast Iterative\nShrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA). We derive a closed-form expression\nfor a relevant proximal operator which enables the application of FISTA. The\nproposed algorithm is used to create non-coplanar treatment plans for four\ncases (including head and neck, lung, and prostate cases), and the resulting\nplans are compared with clinical plans. The dosimetric quality of the group\nsparsity treatment plans is superior to that of the clinical plans. Moreover,\nthe runtime for the group sparsity approach is typically about 5 minutes.\nProblems of this size could not be handled using the previous group sparsity\nmethod for beam orientation optimization, which was slow to solve much smaller\ncoplanar cases. This work demonstrates for the first time that the group\nsparsity approach, when combined with an accelerated proximal gradient method\nsuch as FISTA, works effectively for non-coplanar cases with 500-800 candidate\nbeams.\n", "  The thesis focuses on study of optical and photovoltaic properties of\niso-type and aniso-type heterostructures based on photosensitive layers of\norganic semiconductors. The primary attention has been paid on determination of\noptimal conditions for preparation of organic thin-film structures of methyl\nsubstituted perylene pigment, hexathiopentacene and SnCl2 phthalocyanine. These\nstructures are perspective for fabrication of photosensitive heterostructures\nand can be used for development of effective photoconverters of solar energy.\nThe influence of annealing and substrate temperature during thermal deposition\nof the films on morphology and surface structure, optical and photovoltaic\nproperties of thin films of methyl substituted perylene pigment,\nhexathiopentacene and SnCl2 phthalocyanine was studied. The surface and bulk\nparameters of considered films were determined from the results obtained here.\nThe photovoltaic and optical properties of organic iso-type and aniso-type\nheterostructures prepared on the substrates with different temperatures were\nstudied. The obtained data for heterostructures were analyzed using Anderson\nmodel and Van Opdorp model, respectively. This analysis showed that organic\naniso-type heterostructures based on methyl substituted perylene pigment and\niso-type heterostructures based on pentacene can be described by the models\nproposed and developed for inorganic semiconductor heterojunctions. The optimal\nconditions were determined for preparation of organic photosensitive\nheterostructures, which absorb most part of solar radiation in visible and near\ninfrared range, as well as effectively generate and separate charge carriers on\nthe interface of heterojunction. The aniso-type and iso-type heterostructures\nprepared under optimal conditions are perspective elements for development of\norganic photoconverters, including organic solar cells.\n", "  We provide a reply to a comment by I. Goychuk arXiv:1708.04155, version v2\nfrom 27 Aug 2017 (not under active consideration with Phys. Rev. Lett.), on our\nLetter E. Aghion, D. A. Kessler and E. Barkai, Phys. Rev. Lett., 118, 260601\n(2017).\n", "  In this paper, we focus on three specific interactions of dark sector in the\nexistence of baryonic matter and radiation. First, we attempt to assume\nbaryonic matter and radiation can affect the conversion between dark energy and\ndark matter like the way catalyst influences the conversion rate of two\nmaterials in some reversible chemical reactions. Then we present phase space\nanalysis for every special interaction model. Finally, for every case, we\nobtain a stable attractor solution that can alleviate the coincidence problem.\n", "  We describe new exact results for a model of ionization of a bound state,\ninduced by an oscillating potential. In particular we have obtained exact\nexpressions, in the form of readily computable rapidly convergent sums, for the\nenergy distribution of the emitted particles as a function of time, frequency\nand strength of the oscillating potential. Going beyond perturbation theory,\nthese show resonances in the energy distribution which look like single or\nmulti-photon absorption, similar to those observed in laser induced electron\nemission from solids or atoms. This is particularly so when the strength of the\noscillating potential is small compared to the binding energy but is still\nvisible for large fields, and even for time-periods of a few oscillations. We\nhave also obtained the space-time structure of the wave function. Our model\nexhibits a form of stabilization; the ionization probability is not monotone in\nthe strength of the oscillating potential.\n", "  The status of Higgs boson measurements in the $WW^{\\ast}$, $\\tau\\tau$, and\n$\\mu\\mu$ decay modes with the ATLAS experiment is presented. These measurements\nare done using $pp$ collision data from the Large Hadron Collider with either\nthe full Run 1 dataset at $\\sqrt{s}= 7\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ and $\\sqrt{s}=\n8\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ or with a partial Run 2 dataset at $\\sqrt{s}=\n13\\,\\mathrm{TeV}$ of either $5.81\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ or\n$36.1\\,\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The different couplings to the Higgs boson are probed\nby measuring the production cross sections and extracting the signal strengths.\nDepending on the analysis, the measurements are sensitive to the gluon-fusion\nor vector-boson fusion Higgs boson production, or associated production of a\nvector boson and a Higgs boson.\n", "  We study the statistics, in stationary conditions, of the work $W_\\tau$ done\nby the active force in different systems of self-propelled particles in a time\n$\\tau$. We show the existence of a critical value $W_\\tau ^\\dag$ such that\nfluctuations with $W_\\tau >W_\\tau ^\\dag$ correspond to configurations where\ninteraction between particles plays a minor role whereas those with $W_\\tau <\nW_\\tau ^\\dag$ represent states with single particles dragged by clusters. This\ntwo-fold behavior is fully mirrored by the probability distribution $P(W_\\tau)$\nof the work, which does not obey the large-deviation principle for $W_\\tau\n<W_\\tau ^\\dag$. This pattern of behavior can be interpreted as due to a phase\ntransition occurring at the level of fluctuating quantities and an order\nparameter is correspondingly identified.\n", "  Finite-volume effects in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) have been a subject of\nmuch theoretical interest for more than two decades. They are in particular\nimportant for the analysis and interpretation of QCD simulations on a finite,\ndiscrete space-time lattice. Most of these effects are closely related to the\nphenomenon of spontaneous breaking of the chiral flavor symmetry and the\nemergence of pions as light Goldstone bosons. These long-range fluctuations are\nstrongly affected by putting the system into a finite box, and an analysis with\ndifferent methods can be organized according to the interplay between pion mass\nand box size. The finite volume also affects critical behavior at the chiral\nphase transition in QCD. In the present review, I will be mainly concerned with\nmodeling such finite volume effects as they affect the thermodynamics of the\nchiral phase transition for two quark flavors.\n  I review recent work on the analysis of finite-volume effects which makes use\nof the quark-meson model for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. To account for\nthe effects of critical long-range fluctuations close to the phase transition,\nmost of the calculations have been performed using non-perturbative\nRenormalization Group (RG) methods. I give an overview over the application of\nthese methods to a finite volume. The method, the model and the results are put\ninto the context of related work in random matrix theory for very small\nvolumes, chiral perturbation theory for larger volumes, and related methods and\napproaches. They are applied towards the analysis of finite-volume effects in\nlattice QCD simulations and their interpretation, mainly in the context of the\nchiral phase transition for two quark flavors.\n", "  Recent advances in the fabrication of nanostructures and nanoscale features\nin metasurfaces offer a new prospect for generating visible, light emission\nfrom low energy electrons. In this paper, we present the experimental\nobservation of visible light emission from low-energy free electrons\ninteracting with nanoscale periodic surfaces through the Smith-Purcell (SP)\neffect. SP radiation is emitted when electrons pass in close proximity over a\nperiodic structure, inducing collective charge motion or dipole excitations\nnear the surface, thereby giving rise to electromagnetic radiation. We\ndemonstrate a controlled emission of SP light from nanoscale gold gratings with\nperiodicity as small as 50 nm, enabling the observation of visible SP radiation\nby low energy electrons (1.5 to 6 keV), an order of magnitude lower than\npreviously reported. We study the emission wavelength and intensity dependence\non the grating pitch and electron energy, showing agreement between experiment\nand theory. Further reduction of structure periodicity should enable the\nproduction of SP-based devices that operate with even slower electrons that\nallow an even smaller footprint and facilitate the investigation of quantum\neffects for light generation in nanoscale devices. A tunable light source\nintegrated in an electron microscope would enable the development of novel\nelectron-optical correlated spectroscopic techniques, with additional\napplications ranging from biological imaging to solid-state lighting.\n", "  In this work, the influence of the plastic size effect on the fracture\nprocess of metallic materials is numerically analyzed using the strain-gradient\nplasticity (SGP) theory established from the Taylor dislocation model. Since\nlarge deformations generally occur in the vicinity of a crack, the numerical\nframework of the chosen SGP theory is developed for allowing large strains and\nrotations. The material model is implemented in a commercial finite element\n(FE) code by a user subroutine, and crack-tip fields are evaluated thoroughly\nfor both infinitesimal and finite deformation theories by a boundary-layer\nformulation. An extensive parametric study is conducted and differences in the\nstress distributions ahead of the crack tip, as compared with conventional\nplasticity, are quantified. As a consequence of the strain-gradient\ncontribution to the work hardening of the material, FE results show a\nsignificant increase in the magnitude and the extent of the differences between\nthe stress fields of SGP and conventional plasticity theories when finite\nstrains are considered. Since the distance from the crack tip at which the\nstrain gradient significantly alters the stress field could be one order of\nmagnitude higher when large strains are considered, results reveal that the\nplastic size effect could have important implications in the modelization of\nseveral damage mechanisms where its influence has not yet been considered in\nthe literature.\n", "  We update the global fit to electroweak precision observables, including the\neffect of the latest measurements at hadron colliders of the $W$ and top-quark\nmasses and the effective leptonic weak mixing angle. We comment on the impact\nof these measurements in terms of constraints on new physics. We also update\nthe bounds derived from the fit to the Higgs-boson signal strengths, including\nthe observables measured at the LHC Run 2, and compare the improvements with\nrespect to the 7 and 8 TeV results.\n", "  NA61/SHINE is a fixed target experiment at the CERN Super-Proton-Synchrotron.\nThe main goals of the experiment are to discover the critical point of strongly\ninteracting matter and study the properties of the onset of deconfinement. In\norder to reach these goals, a study of hadron production properties is\nperformed in nucleus-nucleus, proton-proton and proton-nucleus interactions as\na function of collision energy and size of the colliding nuclei. In this talk,\nrecent results on particle production in p+p interactions, as well as Be+Be and\nAr+Sc collisions in the SPS energy range are reviewed. Transverse momentum,\ntransverse mass and rapidity spectra obtained with various analysis methods are\npresented. Surprises in studies of signatures of onset of deconfinement are\ndiscussed. The results are compared with available world data.\n", "  This paper presents a simple approach to increase the normal zone propagation\nvelocity in (RE)BaCuO thin films grown on a flexible metallic substrate, also\ncalled superconducting tapes. The key idea behind this approach is to use a\nspecific geometry of the silver thermal stabilizer that surrounds the\nsuperconducting tape. More specifically, a very thin layer of silver stabilizer\nis deposited on top of the superconductor layer, typically less than 100 nm,\nwhile the remaining stabilizer (still silver) is deposited on the substrate\nside. Normal zone propagation velocities up to 170 cm/s have been measured\nexperimentally, corresponding to a stabilizer thickness of 20 nm on top of the\nsuperconductor layer. This is one order of magnitude faster than the speed\nmeasured on actual commercial tapes. Our results clearly demonstrate that a\nvery thin stabilizer on top of the superconductor layer leads to high normal\nzone propagation velocities. The experimental values are in good agreement with\npredictions realized by finite element simulations. Furthermore, the\npropagation of the normal zone during the quench was recorded in situ and in\nreal time using a high-speed camera. Due to high Joule losses generated on both\nedges of the tape sample, a \"U-shaped\" profile could be observed at the\nboundaries between the superconducting and the normal zones, which matches very\nclosely the profile predicted by the simulations.\n", "  The Axion Resonant InterAction Detection Experiment (ARIADNE) is a\ncollaborative effort to search for the QCD axion using techniques based on\nnuclear magnetic resonance. In the experiment, axions or axion-like particles\nwould mediate short-range spin-dependent interactions between a laser-polarized\n3He gas and a rotating (unpolarized) tungsten source mass, acting as a tiny,\nfictitious \"magnetic field\". The experiment has the potential to probe deep\nwithin the theoretically interesting regime for the QCD axion in the mass range\nof 0.1-10 meV, independently of cosmological assumptions. The experiment relies\non a stable rotary mechanism and superconducting magnetic shielding, required\nto screen the 3He sample from ordinary magnetic noise. Progress on testing the\nstability of the rotary mechanism is reported, and the design for the\nsuperconducting shielding is discussed.\n", "  In this thesis we study the lateral electrostatic interaction between a pair\nof non-identical, moderately charged colloidal particles trapped at an\nelectrolyte interface in the limit of short inter-particle separations. Using a\nsimplified model system we solve the problem analytically within the framework\nof linearised Poisson-Boltzmann theory and classical density functional theory.\nIn the first step, we calculate the electrostatic potential inside the system\nexactly as well as within the widely used superposition approximation. Then\nthese results are used to calculate the surface and line interaction energy\ndensities between the particles. Contrary to the case of identical particles,\ndepending upon the parameters of the system, we obtain that both the surface\nand the line interaction can vary non-monotonically with varying separation\nbetween the particles and the superposition approximation fails to predict the\ncorrect qualitative behaviours in most cases. Additionally, the superposition\napproximation is unable to predict the energy contributions quantitatively even\nat large distances. We also provide expression for the constant (independent of\nthe inter-particle separation) interaction parameters, i.e., the surface\ntension, the line tension and the interfacial tension. Our results are expected\nto be of use for modelling particle-interaction at fluid interfaces and, in\nparticular, for emulsion stabilization using oppositely charged particles.\n", "  We report the discovery of rising X-ray emission from the binary neutron star\n(BNS) merger event GW170817. This is the first detection of X-ray emission from\na gravitational-wave source. Observations acquired with the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory (CXO) at t~2.3 days post merger reveal no significant emission,\nwith L_x<=3.2x10^38 erg/s (isotropic-equivalent). Continued monitoring revealed\nthe presence of an X-ray source that brightened with time, reaching L_x\\sim\n9x10^39 erg/s at ~15.1 days post merger. We interpret these findings in the\ncontext of isotropic and collimated relativistic outflows (both on- and\noff-axis). We find that the broad-band X-ray to radio observations are\nconsistent with emission from a relativistic jet with kinetic energy\nE_k~10^49-10^50 erg, viewed off-axis with theta_obs~ 20-40 deg. Our models\nfavor a circumbinary density n~ 0.0001-0.01 cm-3, depending on the value of the\nmicrophysical parameter epsilon_B=10^{-4}-10^{-2}. A central-engine origin of\nthe X-ray emission is unlikely. Future X-ray observations at $t\\gtrsim 100$\ndays, when the target will be observable again with the CXO, will provide\nadditional constraints to solve the model degeneracies and test our\npredictions. Our inferences on theta_obs are testable with gravitational wave\ninformation on GW170817 from Advanced LIGO/Virgo on the binary inclination.\n", "  A long-standing paradigm in astrophysics is that collisions- or mergers- of\ntwo neutron stars (NSs) form highly relativistic and collimated outflows (jets)\npowering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) of short (< 2 s) duration. However, the\nobservational support for this model is only indirect. A hitherto outstanding\nprediction is that gravitational wave (GW) events from such mergers should be\nassociated with GRBs, and that a majority of these GRBs should be off-axis,\nthat is, they should point away from the Earth. Here we report the discovery of\nthe X-ray counterpart associated with the GW event GW170817. While the\nelectromagnetic counterpart at optical and infrared frequencies is dominated by\nthe radioactive glow from freshly synthesized r-process material in the merger\nejecta, known as kilonova, observations at X-ray and, later, radio frequencies\nexhibit the behavior of a short GRB viewed off-axis. Our detection of X-ray\nemission at a location coincident with the kilonova transient provides the\nmissing observational link between short GRBs and GWs from NS mergers, and\ngives independent confirmation of the collimated nature of the GRB emission.\n", "  11 hours after the detection of gravitational wave source GW170817 by the\nLaser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory and Virgo Interferometers,\nan associated optical transient SSS17a was discovered in the galaxy NGC 4993.\nWhile the gravitational wave data indicate GW170817 is consistent with the\nmerger of two compact objects, the electromagnetic observations provide\nindependent constraints of the nature of that system. Here we synthesize all\noptical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy of SSS17a collected by\nthe One-Meter Two-Hemisphere collaboration. We find that SSS17a is unlike other\nknown transients. The source is best described by theoretical models of a\nkilonova consisting of radioactive elements produced by rapid neutron capture\n(the r-process). We find that SSS17a was the result of a binary neutron star\nmerger, reinforcing the gravitational wave result.\n", "  With the first direct detection of merging black holes in 2015, the era of\ngravitational wave (GW) astrophysics began. A complete picture of compact\nobject mergers, however, requires the detection of an electromagnetic (EM)\ncounterpart. We report ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray observations by Swift and the\nNuclear Spectroscopic Telescope ARray (NuSTAR) of the EM counterpart of the\nbinary neutron star merger GW170817. The bright, rapidly fading ultraviolet\nemission indicates a high mass ($\\approx0.03$ solar masses) wind-driven outflow\nwith moderate electron fraction ($Y_{e}\\approx0.27$). Combined with the X-ray\nlimits, we favor an observer viewing angle of $\\approx 30^{\\circ}$ away from\nthe orbital rotation axis, which avoids both obscuration from the heaviest\nelements in the orbital plane and a direct view of any ultra-relativistic,\nhighly collimated ejecta (a gamma-ray burst afterglow).\n", "  We present a comprehensive comparison of the properties of the radio through\nX-ray counterpart of GW170817 and the properties of short-duration gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs). For this effort, we utilize a sample of 36 short GRBs spanning a\nredshift range of $z \\approx 0.12-2.6$ discovered over 2004-2017. We find that\nthe counterpart to GW170817 has an isotropic-equivalent luminosity that is\n$\\approx 3000$ times less than the median value of on-axis short GRB X-ray\nafterglows, and $\\gtrsim10^{4}$ times less than that for detected short GRB\nradio afterglows. Moreover, the allowed jet energies and particle densities\ninferred from the radio and X-ray counterparts to GW170817 and on-axis short\nGRB afterglows are remarkably similar, suggesting that viewing angle effects\nare the dominant, and perhaps only, difference in their observed radio and\nX-ray behavior. From comparison to previous claimed kilonovae following short\nGRBs, we find that the optical and near-IR counterpart to GW170817 is\ncomparatively under-luminous by a factor of $\\approx 3-5$, indicating a range\nof kilonova luminosities and timescales. A comparison of the optical limits\nfollowing short GRBs on $\\lesssim 1$ day timescales also rules out a \"blue\"\nkilonova of comparable optical isotropic-equivalent luminosity in one previous\nshort GRB. Finally, we investigate the host galaxy of GW170817, NGC4993, in the\ncontext of short GRB host galaxy stellar population properties. We find that\nNGC4993 is superlative in terms of its large luminosity, old stellar population\nage, and low star formation rate compared to previous short GRB hosts.\nAdditional events within the Advanced LIGO/VIRGO volume will be crucial in\ndelineating the properties of the host galaxies of NS-NS mergers, and\nconnecting them to their cosmological counterparts.\n", "  We discovered Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a) in the LIGO/Virgo\nCollaboration (LVC) localization volume of GW170817, the first detected binary\nneutron star (BNS) merger, only 10.9 hours after the trigger. No object was\npresent at the location of SSS17a only a few days earlier, providing a\nqualitative spatial and temporal association with GW170817. Here we quantify\nthis association, finding that SSS17a is almost certainly the counterpart of\nGW170817, with the chance of a coincidence being < 9 x 10^-6 (90% confidence).\nWe arrive at this conclusion by comparing the optical properties of SSS17a to\nother known astrophysical transients, finding that SSS17a fades and cools\nfaster than any other observed transient. For instance, SSS17a fades >5 mag in\ng within 7 days of our first data point while all other known transients of\nsimilar luminosity fade by <1 mag during the same time period. Its spectra are\nalso unique, being mostly featureless, even as it cools. The rarity of\n\"SSS17a-like\" transients combined with the relatively small LVC localization\nvolume and recent non-detection imply the extremely unlikely chance\ncoincidence. We find that the volumetric rate of SSS17a-like transients is <\n1.6 x 10^4 Gpc^-3 year^-1 and the Milky Way rate is <0.19 per century. A\ntransient survey designed to discover similar events should be high cadence and\nobserve in red filters. The LVC will likely detect substantially more BNS\nmergers than current optical surveys will independently discover SSS17a-like\ntransients, however a 1-day cadence survey with LSST could discover an order of\nmagnitude more events.\n", "  On 2017 August 17, gravitational waves were detected from a binary neutron\nstar merger, GW170817, along with a coincident short gamma-ray burst,\nGRB170817A. An optical transient source, Swope Supernova Survey 17a (SSS17a),\nwas subsequently identified as the counterpart of this event. We present\nultraviolet, optical and infrared light curves of SSS17a extending from 10.9\nhours to 18 days post-merger. We constrain the radioactively-powered transient\nresulting from the ejection of neutron-rich material. The fast rise of the\nlight curves, subsequent decay, and rapid color evolution are consistent with\nmultiple ejecta components of differing lanthanide abundance. The late-time\nlight curve indicates that SSS17a produced at least ~0.05 solar masses of heavy\nelements, demonstrating that neutron star mergers play a role in r-process\nnucleosynthesis in the Universe.\n", "  We present Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra imaging, combined with Very\nLarge Telescope MUSE integral field spectroscopy of the counterpart and host\ngalaxy of the first binary neutron star merger detected via gravitational wave\nemission by LIGO & Virgo, GW170817. The host galaxy, NGC 4993, is an S0 galaxy\nat z=0.009783. There is evidence for large, face-on spiral shells in continuum\nimaging, and edge-on spiral features visible in nebular emission lines. This\nsuggests that NGC 4993 has undergone a relatively recent (<1 Gyr) ``dry''\nmerger. This merger may provide the fuel for a weak active nucleus seen in\nChandra imaging. At the location of the counterpart, HST imaging implies there\nis no globular or young stellar cluster, with a limit of a few thousand solar\nmasses for any young system. The population in the vicinity is predominantly\nold with <1% of any light arising from a population with ages <500 Myr. Both\nthe host galaxy properties and those of the transient location are consistent\nwith the distributions seen for short-duration gamma-ray bursts, although the\nsource position lies well within the effective radius (r_e ~ 3 kpc), providing\nan r_e-normalized offset that is closer than ~90% of short GRBs. For the long\ndelay time implied by the stellar population, this suggests that the kick\nvelocity was significantly less than the galaxy escape velocity. We do not see\nany narrow host galaxy interstellar medium features within the counterpart\nspectrum, implying low extinction, and that the binary may lie in front of the\nbulk of the host galaxy.\n", "  On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:06 UTC the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM)\ndetected and triggered on the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A. Approximately\n1.7 s prior to this GRB, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO) triggered on a binary compact merger candidate associated\nwith the GRB. This is the first unambiguous coincident observation of\ngravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation from a single astrophysical\nsource and marks the start of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. We\nreport the GBM observations and analysis of this ordinary short GRB, which\nextraordinarily confirms that at least some short GRBs are produced by binary\ncompact mergers.\n", "  This article is devoted problems of electromagnetic interaction in curved\nspacetime. Such problems exist, in particular, when we investigate\nelectromagnetic quantum processes near black holes. The generalization of\nreduction formalism permits to find formulas for scattering matrices. For the\nfree Dirac and electromagnetic fields corresponding generating functionals are\ncalculated. Next we have found the generating functional for the interaction of\nthese fields. This result holds the central position in our investigation. By\nmeans of generating functionals and reduction formulas we have obtained the\nscattering amplitudes for elementary electrodynamic processes: Compton\nscattering and the annihilation of electron-positron pair (for the tree-level\napproximation). On the base of these results we have formulated the generalized\nFeynman rules for the electromagnetic interaction in curved spacetime. Another\nelectrodynamic processes can be studied by means of these Feynman rules and\ncrossing-symmetry. The generating functional can be used to study problems of\nquantum statistics in curved spacetime.\n", "  We report the e INTernational Gamma-ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL)\ndetection of the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A (discovered by Fermi-GBM)\nwith a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.6, and, for the first time, its association\nwith the gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron star (BNS) merging event\nGW170817 detected by the LIGO and Virgo observatories. The significance of\nassociation between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is\n3.2 $\\sigma$, while the association between the Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL\ndetections is 4.2 $\\sigma$. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument\nabout 2 s after the end of the gravitational wave event. We measure a fluence\nof $(1.4 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.6) \\times$10$^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2})$ (75--2000 keV),\nwhere, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1 $\\sigma$\nconfidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in\nthe spectral model and instrument response.\n  We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL,\nstarting 19.5 h after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a\nstringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy\nrange, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to\n$<7.1\\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (80--300 keV). Exploiting the\nunique capabilities of INTEGRAL, we constrained the gamma-ray line emission\nfrom radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the\nenergy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a\nstringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example from a\nnewly formed magnetar.\n", "  We present the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations of the binary\nneutron star merger event GW170817 and the associated short gamma-ray burst\n(SGRB) GRB\\,170817A detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. The LAT was\nentering the South Atlantic Anomaly at the time of the LIGO/Virgo trigger\n($t_{\\rm GW}$) and therefore cannot place constraints on the existence of\nhigh-energy (E $>$ 100 MeV) emission associated with the moment of binary\ncoalescence. We focus instead on constraining high-energy emission on longer\ntimescales. No candidate electromagnetic counterpart was detected by the LAT on\ntimescales of minutes, hours, or days after the LIGO/Virgo detection. The\nresulting flux upper bound (at 95\\% C.L.\\/) from the LAT is\n$4.5\\times$10$^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1--1 GeV range covering a\nperiod from T0 + 1153 s to T0 + 2027 s. At the distance of GRB\\,170817A, this\nflux upper bound corresponds to a luminosity upper bound of 9.7$\\times10^{43}$\nerg s$^{-1}$, which is 5 orders of magnitude less luminous than the only other\nLAT SGRB with known redshift, GRB\\,090510. We also discuss the prospects for\nLAT detection of electromagnetic counterparts to future gravitational wave\nevents from Advanced LIGO/Virgo in the context of GW170817/GRB\\,170817A.\n", "  On 2017 August 17, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory\n(LIGO) and the Virgo interferometer detected gravitational waves emanating from\na binary neutron star merger, GW170817. Nearly simultaneously, the Fermi and\nINTEGRAL telescopes detected a gamma-ray transient, GRB 170817A. 10.9 hours\nafter the gravitational wave trigger, we discovered a transient and fading\noptical source, Swope Supernova Survey 2017a (SSS17a), coincident with\nGW170817. SSS17a is located in NGC 4993, an S0 galaxy at a distance of 40\nmegaparsecs. The precise location of GW170817 provides an opportunity to probe\nthe nature of these cataclysmic events by combining electromagnetic and\ngravitational-wave observations.\n", "  The merging neutron star gravitational wave event GW170817 has been observed\nthroughout the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio waves to\n$\\gamma$-rays. The resulting energetics, variability, and light curves are\nshown to be consistent with GW170817 originating from the merger of two neutron\nstars, in all likelihood followed by the prompt gravitational collapse of the\nmassive remnant. The available $\\gamma$-ray, X-ray and radio data provide a\nclear probe for the nature of the relativistic ejecta and the non-thermal\nprocesses occurring within, while the ultraviolet, optical and infrared\nemission are shown to probe material torn during the merger and subsequently\nheated by the decay of freshly synthesized $r$-process material. The simplest\nhypothesis that the non-thermal emission is due to a low-luminosity short\n$\\gamma$-ray burst (sGRB) seems to agree with the present data. While low\nluminosity sGRBs might be common, we show here that the collective prompt and\nmulti-wavelength observations are also consistent with a typical, powerful sGRB\nseen off-axis. Detailed follow-up observations are thus essential before we can\nplace stringent constraints on the nature of the relativistic ejecta in\nGW170817.\n", "  We present a near-infrared spectral sequence of the electromagnetic\ncounterpart to the binary neutron star merger GW170817 detected by Advanced\nLIGO/Virgo. Our dataset comprises seven epochs of J+H spectra taken with\nFLAMINGOS-2 on Gemini-South between 1.5 and 10.5 days after the merger. In the\ninitial epoch, the spectrum is dominated by a smooth blue continuum due to a\nhigh-velocity, lanthanide-poor blue kilonova component. Starting the following\nnight, all subsequent spectra instead show features that are similar to those\npredicted in model spectra of material with a high concentration of\nlanthanides, including spectral peaks near 1.07 and 1.55 microns. Our fiducial\nmodel with 0.04 M_sun of ejecta, an ejection velocity of v=0.1c, and a\nlanthanide concentration of X_lan=1e-2 provides a good match to the spectra\ntaken in the first five days, although it over-predicts the late-time fluxes.\nWe also explore models with multiple fitting components, in each case finding\nthat a significant abundance of lanthanide elements is necessary to match the\nbroad spectral peaks that we observe starting at 2.5 d after the merger. These\ndata provide direct evidence that binary neutron star mergers are significant\nproduction sites of even the heaviest r-process elements.\n", "  We report the discovery and monitoring of the near-infrared counterpart\n(AT2017gfo) of a binary neutron-star merger event detected as a gravitational\nwave source by Advanced LIGO/Virgo (GW170817) and as a short gamma-ray burst by\nFermi/GBM and Integral/SPI-ACS (GRB170817A). The evolution of the transient\nlight is consistent with predictions for the behaviour of a\n\"kilonova/macronova\", powered by the radioactive decay of massive neutron-rich\nnuclides created via r-process nucleosynthesis in the neutron-star ejecta. In\nparticular, evidence for this scenario is found from broad features seen in\nHubble Space Telescope infrared spectroscopy, similar to those predicted for\nlanthanide dominated ejecta, and the much slower evolution in the near-infrared\nKs-band compared to the optical. This indicates that the late-time light is\ndominated by high-opacity lanthanide-rich ejecta, suggesting nucleosynthesis to\nthe 3rd r-process peak (atomic masses A~195). This discovery confirms that\nneutron-star mergers produce kilo-/macronovae and that they are at least a\nmajor - if not the dominant - site of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis in\nthe universe.\n", "  We present optical and ultraviolet spectra of the first electromagnetic\ncounterpart to a gravitational wave (GW) source, the binary neutron star merger\nGW170817. Spectra were obtained nightly between 1.5 and 9.5 days post-merger,\nusing the SOAR and Magellan telescopes; the UV spectrum was obtained with the\n\\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} at 5.5 days. Our data reveal a rapidly-fading\nblue component ($T\\approx5500$ K at 1.5 days) that quickly reddens; spectra\nlater than $\\gtrsim 4.5$ days peak beyond the optical regime. The spectra are\nmostly featureless, although we identify a possible weak emission line at $\\sim\n7900$ \\AA\\ at $t\\lesssim 4.5$ days. The colours, rapid evolution and\nfeatureless spectrum are consistent with a \"blue\" kilonova from polar ejecta\ncomprised mainly of light $r$-process nuclei with atomic mass number $A\\lesssim\n140$. This indicates a sight-line within $\\theta_{\\rm obs}\\lesssim 45^{\\circ}$\nof the orbital axis. Comparison to models suggests $\\sim0.03$ M$_\\odot$ of blue\nejecta, with a velocity of $\\sim 0.3c$. The required lanthanide fraction is\n$\\sim 10^{-4}$, but this drops to $<10^{-5}$ in the outermost ejecta. The large\nvelocities point to a dynamical origin, rather than a disk wind, for this blue\ncomponent, suggesting that both binary constituents are neutron stars (as\nopposed to a binary consisting of a neutron star and a black hole). For\ndynamical ejecta, the high mass favors a small neutron star radius of $\\lesssim\n12$ km. This mass also supports the idea that neutron star mergers are a major\ncontributor to $r$-process nucleosynthesis.\n", "  We present Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter\nArray ALMA radio observations of GW\\,170817, the first Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO)/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) event from\na binary neutron star merger and the first GW event with an electromagnetic\n(EM) counterpart. Our data include the first observations following the\ndiscovery of the optical transient at both the centimeter ($13.7$ hours post\nmerger) and millimeter ($2.41$ days post merger) bands. We detect faint\nemission at 6 GHz at 19.47 and 39.23 days after the merger, but not in an\nearlier observation at 2.46 d. We do not detect cm/mm emission at the position\nof the optical counterpart at frequencies of 10-97.5 GHz at times ranging from\n0.6 to 30 days post merger, ruling out an on-axis short gamma-ray burst (SGRB)\nfor energies $\\gtrsim 10^{48}$ erg. For fiducial SGRB parameters, our limits\nrequire an observer viewer angle of $\\gtrsim 20^{\\circ}$. The radio and X-ray\ndata can be jointly explained as the afterglow emission from an SGRB with a jet\nenergy of $\\sim 10^{49}-10^{50}$ erg that exploded in a uniform density\nenvironment with $n\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ cm$^{-3}$, viewed at an angle of $\\sim\n20^{\\circ}-40^{\\circ}$ from the jet axis. Using the results of our light curve\nand spectral modeling, in conjunction with the inference of the circumbinary\ndensity, we predict the emergence of late-time radio emission from the\ndeceleration of the kilonova (KN) ejecta on a timescale of $\\sim 5-10$ years\nthat will remain detectable for decades with next-generation radio facilities,\nmaking GW\\,170817 a compelling target for long-term radio monitoring.\n", "  We present the properties of NGC 4993, the host galaxy of GW170817, the first\ngravitational wave (GW) event from the merger of a binary neutron star (BNS)\nsystem and the first with an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. We use both\narchival photometry and new optical/near-IR imaging and spectroscopy, together\nwith stellar population synthesis models to infer the global properties of the\nhost galaxy. We infer a star formation history peaked at $\\gtrsim 10$ Gyr ago,\nwith subsequent exponential decline leading to a low current star formation\nrate of 0.01 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which we convert into a binary merger\ntimescale probability distribution. We find a median merger timescale of\n$11.2^{+0.7}_{-1.4}$ Gyr, with a 90% confidence range of $6.8-13.6$ Gyr. This\nin turn indicates an initial binary separation of $\\approx 4.5$ R$_{\\odot}$,\ncomparable to the inferred values for Galactic BNS systems. We also use new and\narchival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ images to measure a projected offset of\nthe optical counterpart of $2.1$ kpc (0.64$r_{e}$) from the center of NGC 4993\nand to place a limit of $M_{r} \\gtrsim -7.2$ mag on any pre-existing emission,\nwhich rules out the brighter half of the globular cluster luminosity function.\nFinally, the age and offset of the system indicates it experienced a modest\nnatal kick with an upper limit of $\\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. Future GW$-$EM\nobservations of BNS mergers will enable measurement of their population delay\ntime distribution, which will directly inform their viability as the dominant\nsource of $r$-process enrichment in the Universe.\n", "  We present the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) discovery of the optical\ncounterpart of the first binary neutron star merger detected through\ngravitational wave emission, GW170817. Our observations commenced 10.5 hours\npost-merger, as soon as the localization region became accessible from Chile.\nWe imaged 70 deg$^2$ in the $i$ and $z$ bands, covering 93\\% of the initial\nintegrated localization probability, to a depth necessary to identify likely\noptical counterparts (e.g., a kilonova). At 11.4 hours post-merger we detected\na bright optical transient located $10.6''$ from the nucleus of NGC\\,4993 at\nredshift $z=0.0098$, consistent (for $H_0 = 70$\\, km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) with\nthe distance of $40 \\pm 8$\\, Mpc reported by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nand the Virgo Collaboration (LVC). At detection the transient had magnitudes\n$i\\approx 17.30$ and $z\\approx 17.45$, and thus an absolute magnitude of $M_i =\n-15.7$, in the luminosity range expected for a kilonova. We identified 1,500\npotential transient candidates. Applying simple selection criteria aimed at\nrejecting background events such as supernovae, we find the transient\nassociated with NGC\\,4993 as the only remaining plausible counterpart, and\nreject chance coincidence at the 99.5\\% confidence level. We therefore conclude\nthat the optical counterpart we have identified near NGC\\,4993 is associated\nwith GW170817. This discovery ushers in the era of multi-messenger astronomy\nwith gravitational waves, and demonstrates the power of DECam to identify the\noptical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources.\n", "  The cosmic origin of the elements heavier than iron has long been uncertain.\nTheoretical modelling shows that the matter that is expelled in the violent\nmerger of two neutron stars can assemble into heavy elements such as gold and\nplatinum in a process known as rapid neutron capture (r-process)\nnucleosynthesis. The radioactive decay of isotopes of the heavy elements is\npredicted to power a distinctive thermal glow (a 'kilonova'). The discovery of\nan electromagnetic counterpart to the gravitational-wave source GW170817\nrepresents the first opportunity to detect and scrutinize a sample of freshly\nsynthesized r-process elements. Here we report models that predict the detailed\nelectromagnetic emission of kilonovae and enable the mass, velocity and\ncomposition of ejecta to be derived from the observations. We compare the\nmodels to the optical and infrared radiation associated with GW170817 event to\nargue that the observed source is a kilonova. We infer the presence of two\ndistinct components of ejecta, one composed primarily of light (atomic mass\nnumber less than 140) and one of heavy (atomic mass number greater than 140)\nr-process elements. Inferring the ejected mass and a merger rate from GW170817\nimplies that such mergers are a dominant mode of r-process production in the\nUniverse.\n", "  This paper presents a new approach to study the effects of temperature on the\nporo- elastic and viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage. Biphasic\nsolid-fluid mixture theory is applied to study the poro-mechancial behavior of\narticular cartilage in a fully saturated state. The balance of linear momentum,\nmass, and energy are considered to describe deformation of the solid skeleton,\npore fluid pressure, and temperature distribution in the mixture. The\nmechanical model assumes both linear elastic and viscoelastic isotropic\nmaterials, infinitesimal strain theory, and a time-dependent response. The\ninfluence of temperature on the mixture behavior is modeled through temperature\ndependent mass density and volumetric thermal strain. The fluid flow through\nthe porous medium is described by the Darcy's law. The stress-strain relation\nfor time-dependent viscoelastic deformation in the solid skeleton is described\nusing the generalized Maxwell model. A verification example is presented to\nillustrate accuracy and efficiency of the developed finite element model. The\ninfluence of temperature is studied through examining the behavior of articular\ncartilage for confined and unconfined boundary conditions. Furthermore,\narticular cartilage under partial loading condition is modeled to investigate\nthe deformation, pore fluid pressure, and temperature dissipation processes.\nThe results suggest significant impacts of temperature on both poro- elastic\nand viscoelastic behavior of articular cartilage.\n", "  In the middle of last century, Bondi and his coworkers proposed an out going\nboundary condition for the Einstein equations. Based on such boundary condition\nthe authors theoretically solved the puzzle of the existence problem of\ngravitational wave. Currently many works on gravitational wave source modeling\nuse Bondi's result to do the analysis including the gravitational wave\ncalculation in numerical relativity. Recently more and more observations imply\nthat the Einstein equations should be modified with an nonzero cosmological\nconstant. In this work we use Bondi's original method to treat the Einstein\nequations with cosmological constant for theoretical curiosity. We find that\nthe gravitational wave does not essentially exist if Bondi's original out going\nboundary condition is imposed. We find this unphysical result is due to the\nnon-consistency between Bondi's original out going boundary condition and the\nEinstein equations with cosmological constant. Based on theoretical analysis,\nwe propose an new Bondi-type out going boundary condition for the Einstein\nequations with cosmological constant. With this new boundary condition, the\ngravitational wave behavior for the Einstein equations with cosmological\nconstant is similar to the Einstein equations without cosmological constant. In\nparticular, when the cosmological constant goes to zero, the behavior of the\nEinstein equations without cosmological constant is recovered. Together with\ngravitational wave, electromagnetic wave is also analyzed. The boundary\nconditions for electromagnetic wave does not depend on the cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  We propose an operating principle to achieve broadband and highly tunable\nmode conversion and amplification exploiting inter-modal four wave mixing in a\nmultimode fiber. A bandwidth of 30 nanometers is demonstrated by properly\ndesigning a simple step-index silica fiber.\n", "  Validation experiments of the two-dimensional inverse algorithm are performed\nin a pulsed Poiseuille flow exposing shear reversal phases. The method is\napplied to the three-segment electrodiffusion (ED) probe for which a specific\nnondimensionalization process is suggested, allowing to better link\nmeasurements from a real ED probe to the modeled one in the inverse problem.\nThis approach provided a two-component wall shear rate in good agreement with\nthe one obtained from laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements, thus\nvalidating the ability of ED probes to deal with high-amplitude unsteady flows.\nThe classic linear velocity approximation ($u=sy$) in the probe vicinity is\nalso investigated in such a flow.\n", "  The success of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) in computer vision\nespecially image classification problems requests a new information theory for\nfunction of image, instead of image itself. In this article, after establishing\na deep mathematical connection between image classification problem and quantum\nspin model, we propose to use entanglement entropy, a generalization of\nclassical Boltzmann-Shannon entropy, as a powerful tool to characterize the\ninformation needed for representation of general function of image. We prove\nthat there is a sub-volume-law bound for entanglement entropy of target\nfunctions of reasonable image classification problems. Therefore target\nfunctions of image classification only occupy a small subspace of the whole\nHilbert space. As a result, a neural network with polynomial number of\nparameters is efficient for representation of such target functions of image.\nThe concept of entanglement entropy can also be useful to characterize the\nexpressive power of different neural networks. For example, we show that to\nmaintain the same expressive power, number of channels $D$ in a convolutional\nneural network should scale with the number of convolution layers $n_c$ as\n$D\\sim D_0^{\\frac{1}{n_c}}$. Therefore, deeper CNN with large $n_c$ is more\nefficient than shallow ones.\n", "  Non-zero leptonic CP phases in the neutrino sector are clear evidence for\nphysics beyond the Standard Model and have many implications in particle\nphysics and cosmology. Some clues to maximal Dirac CP violation\n$\\delta_{CP}=3\\pi/2$ are reviewed. An approach to connect the Dirac CP\nviolation phase and the neutrino mass hierarchy in terms of the measurement of\nCP asymmetry is proposed. Under appropriate requirements for baseline distance\nand beam energy, the problem of neutrino mass hierarchy can be revealed at\nmaximal Dirac CP violation. General allowed parameter spaces are investigated,\nwithin which the two unknown neutrino issues, mass hierarchy and Dirac CP\nviolation, can be solved simultaneously. The abilities of addressing the mass\nhierarchy of current long baseline neutrino experiments are also discussed.\n", "  LHCb observes the $B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+$ decay with $R_{D^0 K} = f_c/f_u \\times\n{\\cal B}(B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+)=(9.3^{+2.8}_{-2.5} \\pm 0.6)\\times 10^{-7}$. The\ncorresponding branching ratio (BR) of the decay can be estimated as ${\\cal\nB}(B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+) \\approx (10.01 \\pm 3.40)\\times 10^{-5}$; however, the\ntheoretical estimates vary from $\\sim 10^{-7}$ to $\\sim 5\\times 10^{-5}$. We\nphenomenologically investigate the $B^+_c \\to (D^0 K^+, D^0 \\pi^+)$ decays\nthrough the analysis of $B\\to KK$, $B^+_u\\to D^+ K^0$, and $B_d \\to D^-_s K^+$.\nWith the form factor of $f^{B_c D}_0\\approx 0.2$, it is found that the\ntree-annihilation contribution dominates the $B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+$ decay, and\nwhen ${\\cal B}(B^+_u \\to D^+ K^0) \\approx (1-3.1) \\times 10^{-7}$ is required,\nwe obtain ${\\cal B}(B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+)\\approx (4.4- 9) \\times 10^{-5}$, and the\nmagnitude of CP asymmetry is lower than approximately $10\\%$. Although the\n$B^+_c \\to D^0 \\pi^+$ decay is dominated by the tree-transition effect, the\ntree-annihilation also makes an important contribution, where its effect could\nbe around $70\\%$ of the tree-transition. It is found that when ${\\cal B}(B^+_c\n\\to D^0 K^+)\\approx (4.4- 9) \\times 10^{-5}$ is taken, the BR and CP asymmetry\nfor $B^+_c \\to D^0 \\pi^+$ with the common values of parameters can be ${\\cal\nB}(B^+_c \\to D^0 \\pi^+)\\approx (4.9-8)\\times 10^{-6}$ and of the order of one,\nrespectively. Moreover, we conclude ${\\cal B}(B^+_c \\to D^+ K^0)\\approx {\\cal\nB}(B^+_c \\to D^0 K^+)$, and the BRs for $B^+_c \\to K^+ \\bar K^0$ and $B^+_c \\to\nJ/\\Psi \\pi^+$ are $(6.99 \\pm 1.34) \\times 10^{-7}$ and $(7.7 \\pm 1.1)\\times\n10^{-4}$, respectively.\n", "  Filtering theory gives an explicit models for the flow of information and\nthereby quantifies the rates of change of information supplied to and\ndissipated from the filter's memory. Here we extend the analysis of Mitter and\nNewton from linear Gaussian models to general nonlinear filters involving\nMarkov diffusions.The rates of entropy production are now generally the average\nsquared-field (co-metric) of various logarithmic probability densities, which\nmay be interpreted as Fisher information associate with Gaussian perturbations\n(via de Bruijn's identity). We show that the central connection is made through\nthe Mayer-Wolf and Zakai Theorem for the rate of change of the mutual\ninformation between the filtered state and the observation history. In\nparticular, we extend this Theorem to cover a Markov diffusion controlled by\nobservations process, which may be interpreted as the filter acting as a\nMaxwell's Daemon applying feedback to the system.\n", "  We theoretically explore the superconducting critical temperature of hole\ndoped blue phosphorene. Implementing the density functional theory\ncalculations, we show that for the hole doped blue phosphorene, the isotropic\nsuperconducting state is induced owing to the quite strong electron-phonon\ncoupling. The theory is based on the Migdal-Eliashberg formalism and the\ncritical temperature is obtained through set-of-equations, self-consistency. In\naddition, we include a vertex correction diagram to the Migdal-Eliashberg\nformalism. The inclusion of the vertex correction beyond the Migdal-Eliashberg\nformalism changes the $T_c$ about $\\pm20$K, depending on the level of the\ndoping. Our accurate numerical results show that the superconducting critical\ntemperature is still quite high, even in the cases that the vertex correction\nis implemented.\n", "  The statistical-thermodynamic dislocation theory developed in our earlier\nstudies is used here in an analysis of the experimental observations of\nadiabatic shear banding in steel by Marchand and Duffy (1988). Employing a\nsmall set of physics-based parameters, which we expect to be approximately\nindependent of strain rate and temperature, we are able to explain experimental\nstress-strain curves at six different temperatures and four different strain\nrates. We make a simple model of a weak notch-like disturbance that, when\ndriven hard enough, triggers shear banding instabilities that are\nquantitatively comparable with those seen in the experiments.\n", "  We present the experimental demonstration of interaction induced enhancement\nin Rydberg excitation or Rydberg anti-blockade in thermal atomic vapor. We have\nused optical heterodyne detection technique to measure Rydberg population due\nto two-photon excitation to the Rydberg state. The anti-blockade peak which\ndoesn't satisfy the two-photon resonant condition is observed along with the\nusual two-photon resonant peak which can't be explained using the model with\nnon-interacting three-level atomic system. A model involving two interacting\natoms is formulated for thermal atomic vapor using the dressed states of\nthree-level atomic system to explain the experimental observations. A\nnon-linear dependence of vapor density is observed for the anti-blockade peak\nwhich also increases with increase in principal quantum number of the Rydberg\nstate. A good agreement is found between the experimental observations and the\nproposed interacting model. Our result implies possible applications towards\nquantum logic gates using Rydberg anti-blockade in thermal atomic vapor.\n", "  The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) project carried out in\nthe Institute of Physics of the Jagiellonian University is focused on\nconstruction and tests of the first prototype of PET scanner for medical\ndiagnostic which allows for the simultaneous 3D imaging of the whole human body\nusing organic scintillators. The J-PET prototype consists of 192 scintillator\nstrips forming three cylindrical layers which are optimized for the detection\nof photons from the electron-positron annihilation with high time- and high\nangular-resolutions. In this article we present time calibration and\nsynchronization of the whole J-PET detection system by irradiating each single\ndetection module with a 22Na source and a small detector providing common\nreference time for synchronization of all the modules.\n", "  Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) has shown to be a powerful\ntool to study the nanostructures of porous materials. Positron Emissions\nTomography (PET) are devices allowing imaging of metabolic processes e.g. in\nhuman bodies. A newly developed device, the J-PET (Jagiellonian PET), will\nallow PALS in addition to imaging, thus combining both analyses providing new\nmethods for physics and medicine. In this contribution we present a computer\nprogram that is compatible with the J-PET software. We compare its performance\nwith the standard program LT 9.0 by using PALS data from hexane measurements at\ndifferent temperatures. Our program is based on an iterative procedure, and our\nfits prove that it performs as good as LT 9.0.\n", "  An overview of the latest results for top pair production in association with\na vector gauge boson in the ATLAS detector at LHC is presented. The results\ninvolving $Z$ and $W$ bosons are recorded at $\\sqrt{13}$ TeV collision energy,\nwhile the results involving photons are recorded at $\\sqrt{7}$ TeV and\n$\\sqrt{8}$ TeV collision energy.\n", "  While long-range propagating plasmons have been extensively investigated for\nimplementing on-chip optical sensing platforms, waveguide-excited localized\nsurface plasmon resonance (LSPR) based sensing systems have not yet received\nmuch attention. Waveguide excitation and readout as an alternative to\nfree-space light based single-particle spectroscopy are particularly attractive\nfor high-throughput sensing and on-chip drug discovery platforms. Here we\npresent a numerical investigation of the optical response of a\nwaveguide-excited plasmonic dolmen-shaped compound nanoantenna that exhibits a\nFano signature in its spectral response. Although only evanescently coupled to\nthe waveguide, the compound nanoantenna is seen to induce a high-contrast\nextinction in the transmission spectrum of the waveguide. The compound\nplasmonic nanoantenna configuration presented here is of interest in hybrid\nphotonic-plasmonic sensing approaches with high-throughput capabilities.\n", "  Action potentials are the basic unit of information in the nervous system and\ntheir reliable detection and decoding holds the key to understanding how the\nbrain generates complex thought and behavior. Transducing these signals into\nmicrowave field oscillations can enable wireless sensors that report on brain\nactivity through magnetic induction. In the present work we demonstrate that\naction potentials from crayfish lateral giant neuron can trigger microwave\noscillations in spin-torque nano-oscillators. These nanoscale devices take as\ninput small currents and convert them to microwave current oscillations that\ncan wirelessly broadcast neuronal activity, opening up the possibility for\ncompact neuro-sensors. We show that action potentials activate microwave\noscillations in spin-torque nano-oscillators with an amplitude that follows the\naction potential signal, demonstrating that the device has both the sensitivity\nand temporal resolution to respond to action potentials from a single neuron.\nThe activation of magnetic oscillations by action potentials, together with the\nsmall footprint and the high frequency tunability, makes these devices\npromising candidates for high resolution sensing of bioelectric signals from\nneural tissues. These device attributes may be useful for design of\nhigh-throughput bi-directional brain-machine interfaces.\n", "  Dynamics of platicons caused by the third-order dispersion is studied. It is\nshown that under the influence of the third-order dispersion platicons obtain\nangular velocity depending both on dispersion and on detuning value. A method\nof tuning of platicon associated optical frequency comb repetition rate is\nproposed.\n", "  In this thesis, we considered quantum systems coupled to several baths. We\nsupposed that the system state is governed by the quantum master equation\n(QME). We investigated the quantum pump and the excess entropy production. In\nthe first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using the full\ncounting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the\nlatter part of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The\naverage entropy production is composed of the time integral of the\ninstantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess entropy production.\nWe define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle\ncurrents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME.\nThe excess entropy production is given by a line integral in the control\nparameter space and its integrand is called the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN)\nvector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN vector is\ndescribed by $\\ln \\rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\\rho_0$ where $\\rho_0$ is the\ninstantaneous steady state of the QME and $\\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME\nwhich is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb shift term. In general, the\npotential dose not exist. The origins of the non-existence of the potential are\na quantum effect (the Lamb shift) and the breaking of the time-reversal\nsymmetry. The non-existence of the potential means that the excess entropy\nessentially depends on the path of the modulation. If the system Hamiltonian is\nnon-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy\nproduction approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann\nentropies of the system. We pointed out that the expression of the entropy\nproduction obtained in the classical Markov jump process is different from our\nresult and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in the weakly\nnonequilibrium regime.\n", "  Red giant stars are solar-like pulsators presenting mixed-modes. Such modes\nconsist in a coupling between pressure waves propagating in the external\nconvective envelope and gravity waves propagating in the radiative interior.\nTherefore, the red giant asteroseismology provides us with a direct view on\ntheir core and opens the possibility to monitor the evolution of their core\nrotation. Previous measurements of the mean core rotation revealed that angular\nmomentum is efficiently transferred from the core to the envelope inside red\ngiants, but the physical mechanisms at work are not yet fully understood. We\nthus need stronger observational constraints on the evolution of the red giant\ncore rotation. In this context, we developed an automated method to determine\nthe mean core rotation of red giant branch stars observed with Kepler. This\nautomated method is paving the way for the future PLATO data, representing\nhundreds of thousands of potential red giant oscillation spectra. Results\nobtained for almost 1200 red giant branch stars indicate that the rate of the\ncore rotation braking is lower than previously estimated and does not seem to\ndepend on the stellar mass.\n", "  Distributed radio interferometric calibration based on consensus optimization\nhas been shown to improve the estimation of systematic errors in radio\nastronomical observations. The intrinsic continuity of systematic errors across\nfrequency is used by a consensus polynomial to penalize traditional\ncalibration. Consensus is achieved via the use of alternating direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. In this paper, we extend the existing\ndistributed calibration algorithms to use ADMM with an adaptive penalty\nparameter update. Compared to a fixed penalty, its adaptive update has been\nshown to perform better in diverse applications of ADMM. In this paper, we\ncompare two such popular penalty parameter update schemes: residual balance\npenalty update and spectral penalty update (Barzilai-Borwein). We apply both\nschemes to distributed radio interferometric calibration and compare their\nperformance against ADMM with a fixed penalty parameter. Simulations show that\nboth methods of adaptive penalty update improve the convergence of ADMM but the\nspectral penalty parameter update shows more stability.\n", "  Recent results from the CMS experiment on the production of multiple vector\nbosons in proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC are presented. Measurements\nof WZ and ZZ production with fully leptonic decays, Z$(\\nu\\nu)\\gamma$, and WV\n(V $=$ W,Z $\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}$) production at 8 and 13 TeV are discussed.\nSelected cross section measurements, unfolded differential measurements, and\nlimits on anomalous triple gauge couplings are presented and compared with\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  The talk contains an overview of recent experimental results obtained by the\nLHC experiments. The measured inclusive event properties, as well as various\ncorrelation phenomena, are compared with predictions of phenomenological\nmodels.\n", "  We show that if the non Gaussian part of the cumulants of a random matrix\nmodel obey some scaling bounds in the size of the matrix, then Wigner's\nsemicircle law holds. This result is derived using the replica technique and an\nanalogue of the renormalisation group equation for the replica effective\naction. This is a transcript of a talk given at \"5th Winter Workshop on\nNon-Perturbative Quantum Field Theory\" Sophia-Antipolis, March 2017 and is\nbased on former work in collaboration with A. Tanasa and D.L. Vu, see\narXiv:1609.01873 .\n", "  We study the effect of phase slips in a quasi 1d superconducting channel\nalong which a current flows and report a new phenomenon where an avalanche of\nphase slips occurs. This limits the critical current in thin films and wires\nand drives the system to a topological phase transition at a temperature lower\nthan the bulk critical temperature. We describe the mechanism of such a\ncatastrophic phase slip avalanche and, following Kosterlitz and Thouless, we\nuse group renormalization techniques to derive an exact analytical expression\nfor the critical current as a function of film width and temperature. Our\nresults are in very good agreement with, and reproduce, the available\nexperimental data on superconducting MgB$_2$ thin films. The phenomenon we\ndescribe is very general and can be used in the construction of new devices\nwhere the superconducting state can coexist with the normal state.\n", "  We perform a numerical study to recognize the difference between various\nmassive potentials in the dRGT massive gravity on the holographic\nthermalization in the AdS and AdS Gauss-Bonnet gravities. The massive potential\nin $4+1$ dimensions includes three symmetric polynomial terms which we denote\nthem as $a_1$, $a_2$ and $a_3$ terms. We observe, in the case of time evolution\nof entanglement entropy that there is a critical size of the entangling surface\non the boundary below which both signs of $a_1$ and above the critical size\n$a_3$ are able to reduce the thermal value of entanglement entropy. Our\nnumerical computations show the more positive $a_i$'s are, the faster system\nreaches to its thermal value. The order of saturation time of positive\npotentials when supplemented to AdS or AdS-GB backgrounds is as\n$t_{sat}(a_{1})>t_{sat}(a_{2})>t_{sat}(a_{3})$. We also explore these effects\non the time evolution of the holographic mutual information.\n", "  In a multidimensional infinite layer bounded by two hyperplanes, the Poisson\nequation with the polynomial right-hand side is considered. It is shown that\nthe Dirichlet boundary value problem and the mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary\nvalue problem with polynomial boundary conditions have a unique solution in the\nclass of functions of polynomial growth and it solution is a polynomial. An\nalgorithm for constructing this polynomial solution is given and examples are\nconsidered.\n", "  We have studied the prospects of using the Drell-Yan dilepton process in\npion-nucleus collisions as a novel input in the global analysis of nuclear\nparton distribution functions (nPDFs). In a NLO QCD framework, we find the\nmeasured nuclear cross-section ratios from the NA3, NA10 and E615 experiments\nto be largely insensitive to the pion parton distributions and also compatible\nwith the EPS09 and nCTEQ15 nPDFs. These data sets can thus be, and in EPPS16\nhave been, included in global nPDF analyses without introducing significant new\ntheoretical uncertainties or tension with the other data. In particular, we\nexplore the constraining power of these data sets on the possible flavour\nasymmetry in the valence-quark nuclear modifications. Moreover, using the\nCOMPASS kinematics we present predictions for pion charge-difference ratio, a\nnew measurable which could help to further constrain this asymmetry.\n", "  This paper presents a laser amplifier based on an antireflection coated laser\ndiode. This laser amplifier operates without active temperature stabilisation\nat any wavelength within its gain profile without restrictions on the injection\ncurrent. Using a active feedback from an external detector to the laser current\nthe power stabilized to better than $10^{-4}$, even after additional optical\nelements such as an optical fiber and/or a polarization cleaner. This power can\nalso be modulated and tuned arbitrarily. In the absence of the seeding light,\nthe laser amplifier does not lase, thus resulting in an extremely simple setup,\nwhich requires neither an external Fabry Perot cavity for monitoring the mode\npurity nor a temperature stabilization.\n", "  We present an analysis of risk levels on multi-lane roads. The aim is to use\nthe crash metrics to understand which direction of the flow mainly influences\nthe safety in traffic flow. In fact, on multi-lane highways interactions among\nvehicles occur also with lane changing and we show that they strongly affect\nthe level of potential conflicts. In particular, in this study we consider the\nTime-To-Collision as risk metric and we use the experimental data collected on\nthe A3 German highway.\n", "  Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) is a promising form of urban transport. Its\noperation consists in the use of small unmanned vehicles which convey the\npassengers among stations within a dedicated network. Various aspects of the\nPRT network performance are frequently evaluated using the discrete-event\nsimulation. The paper supports the need of establishing some reference models\nfor the simulation of PRT networks, targeted mainly towards the needs of the\nresearch on network management algorithms. Three models of such PRT network\nmodels are proposed and discussed. The presented models can play the role of\nbenchmarks which would be very useful for comparative evaluation of heuristic\ncontrol algorithms, developed by different research groups.\n", "  Artificial ice systems have unique physical properties promising for\npotential applications. One of the most challenging issues in this field is to\nfind novel ice systems that allows a precise control over the geometries and\nmany-body interactions. Superconducting vortex matter has been proposed as a\nvery suitable candidate to study artificial ice, mainly due to availability of\ntunable vortex-vortex interactions and the possibility to fabricate a variety\nof nanoscale pinning potential geometries. So far, a detailed imaging of the\nlocal configurations in a vortex-based artificial ice system is still lacking.\nHere we present a direct visualization of the vortex ice state in a\nnanostructured superconductor. By using the scanning Hall probe microscopy, a\nlarge area with the vortex ice ground state configuration has been detected,\nwhich confirms the recent theoretical predictions for this new ice system.\nBesides the defects analogous to artificial spin ice systems, other types of\ndefects have been visualized and identified. We also demonstrate the\npossibility to realize different types of defects by varying the magnetic\nfield.\n", "  We present results of our recent EPPS16 global analysis of NLO nuclear parton\ndistribution functions (nPDFs). For the first time, dijet and heavy gauge boson\nproduction data from LHC proton-lead collisions have been included in a global\nfit. Especially, the CMS dijets play an important role in constraining the\nnuclear effects in gluon distributions. With the inclusion of also\nneutrino-nucleus deeply-inelastic scattering and pion-nucleus Drell-Yan data\nand a proper treatment of isospin-corrected data, we were able to free the\nflavor dependence of the valence and sea quark nuclear modifications for the\nfirst time. This gives us less biased, yet larger, flavor by flavor uncertainty\nestimates. The EPPS16 analysis indicates no tension between the data sets used,\nwhich supports the validity of collinear factorization and universal nPDFs for\nnuclear hard-collision processes in the kinematical range studied.\n", "  Experiments may not reveal their full import at the time that they are\nperformed. The scientists who perform them usually are testing a specific\nhypothesis and quite often have specific expectations limiting the possible\ninferences that can be drawn from the experiment. Nonetheless, as Hacking has\nsaid, experiments have lives of their own. Those lives do not end with the\ninitial report of the results and consequences of the experiment. Going back\nand rethinking the consequences of the experiment in a new context, theoretical\nor empirical, has great merit as a strategy for investigation and for\nscientific problem analysis. I apply this analysis to the interplay between\nFizeau's classic optical experiments and the building of special relativity.\nEinstein's understanding of the problems facing classical electrodynamics and\noptics, in part, was informed by Fizeau's 1851 experiments. However, between\n1851 and 1905, Fizeau's experiments were duplicated and reinterpreted by a\nsuccession of scientists, including Hertz, Lorentz, and Michelson. Einstein's\nanalysis of the consequences of the experiments is tied closely to this\ntheoretical and experimental tradition. However, Einstein's own inferences from\nthe experiments differ greatly from the inferences drawn by others in that\ntradition.\n", "  Uniaxial tensile properties of hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons and\ndependence of these properties on temperature, strain rate, and the inclusion\nof vacancy defects have been explored with molecular dynamics simulations using\nTersoff potential. The ultimate tensile strength of pristine hexagonal boron\nnitride nanoribbon of 26 nm x 5 nm with armchair chirality is found to be 100.5\nGPa. The ultimate tensile strength and strain have been found decreasing with\nincreasing the temperature while an opposite trend has been observed for\nincreasing the strain rate. Furthermore, the vacancy defects reduce ultimate\ntensile strength and strain where the effect of bi-vacancy is clearly\ndominating over point vacancy.\n", "  Using Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, The scenario of warm inflation with viscous\npressure is considered. The formalism gives a way of computing the slow-rolling\nparameters without extra approximation, and it is well-known as a powerful\nmethod in cold inflation. The model is studied in detail for three different\ncases of dissipation and bulk viscous pressure coefficients. In the first case\nwhere both coefficients are taken as a constant, it is shown that the case\ncould not portray warm inflationary scenario compatible with observational data\neven it is possible to restrict the model parameters. For other cases, the\nresults shows that the model could properly predicts the perturbation\nparameters in which they stay in perfect agreement with Planck data. As a\nfurther argument, $r-n_s$ and $\\alpha_s-n_s$ are drown that show the required\nresult could stand in acceptable area expressing a compatibility with\nobservational data.\n", "  We review the basic optical, electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric and\nmechanical properties of few-layer black phosphorus (BP), a layered\nsemiconductor that can be exfoliated from bulk BP, the most stable allotrope of\nphosphorus. The distinguishing trait of BP is its highly anisotropic crystal\nstructure, which leads to strong optical linear dichroism, elliptical\nplasmonics energy surfaces, anisotropic electronic and thermal conductivities\nand elasticity. We provide tutorial-like discussion of these phenomena and\ntheir theoretical models.\n", "  We derive a new exact evolution equation for the scale dependence of an\neffective action. The corresponding equation for the effective potential\npermits a useful truncation. This allows one to deal with the infrared problems\nof theories with massless modes in less than four dimensions which are relevant\nfor the high temperature phase transition in particle physics or the\ncomputation of critical exponents in statistical mechanics.\n", "  We demonstrate a high-throughput direct measurement method for the\nmagnetocaloric effect (MCE) by means of a lock-in thermography (LIT) technique.\nThis method enables systematic measurements of the magnetic-field and\noperation-frequency dependences of the temperature change induced by the MCE.\nThis is accomplished in a shorter time compared with conventional adiabatic\ntemperature measurement methods. The direct measurement based on LIT is free\nfrom any possible miscalculations and errors arising from indirect measurements\nusing thermodynamic relations. Importantly, the LIT technique makes\nsimultaneous MCE measurements of multiple materials possible without increasing\nmeasurement time, realizing high-throughput investigations of the MCE. By\napplying this method to Gd, we obtain the MCE-induced temperature change of\n1.84 $\\pm$ 0.11 K under a modulation field of 1.0 T and modulation frequency of\n0.5 Hz at a temperature of 300.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 K, offering evidence that the LIT\nmethod gives quantitative results.\n", "  The recent coincident detection of gravitational waves (GW) from a binary\nneutron star merger with aLIGO/Virgo and short-lived gamma-ray emission with\nFermi/GBM (called GW 170817) is a milestone for the establishment of\nmulti-messenger astronomy. Merging neutron stars (NS) represent the standard\nscenario for short-duration (< 2 sec) gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which are\nproduced in a collimated, relativistically expanding jet with an opening angle\nof a few degrees and a bulk Lorentz factor of 300-1000. While the present aLIGO\ndetection is consistent with predictions, the measured faint gamma-ray emission\nfrom GW 170817A, if associated to the merger event at a distance of 40 Mpc, is\nabout 1000x less luminous than known short-duration GRBs (sGRBs). Hence, the\npresence of this sGRB in the local Universe is either a very rare event, or\npoints to a dramatic ignorance of the emission properties of sGRBs outside\ntheir narrow jets. Here we show that the majority of previously detected faint\nsGRBs are local, at redshift smaller than 0.1, seen off-axis. In contrast, the\nbrighter sGRBs are seen on-axis, and therefore out to larger distances,\nconsistent with the measured redshift distribution. Examining the\nobserver-frame parameter space of all Fermi/GBM sGRBs shows that the sGRB\nassociated with GW 170817A is extreme in its combination of flux, spectral\nsoftness and temporal structure. We identify a group of similar GRBs, one of\nwhich has been associated to a bright galaxy at 75 Mpc. We incorporate off-axis\nemission in the estimate of the rates of sGRBs, and predict that the majority\nof future GW-detections of NS-NS mergers will be accompanied by faint gamma-ray\nemission, contrary to previous thinking. The much more frequent off-axis\nemission of sGRBs also implies a much higher deadly rate of gamma-rays for\nextraterrestrial life in the Universe.\n", "  We describe a mechanism by which an electrical bias voltage applied across a\nunipolar semiconductor quantum well can drive an exciton or polariton\nsupercurrent. The mechanism depends on the properties of electronic\nquasiparticles in quantum wells or two-dimensional materials that are dressed\nby interactions with the coherent exciton field of an exciton condensate or the\ncoherent exciton and photon fields of a polariton condensate, and on\napproximate conservation laws. We propose experiments that can be performed to\nrealize this new light-matter coupling effect, and discuss possible\napplications.\n", "  We discuss the feasibility of using astrophysical observations of white\ndwarfs as probes of fundamental physics. We quantify the effects of varying\nfundamental couplings on the white dwarf mass-radius relation in a broad class\nof unification scenarios, both for the simple case of a polytropic stellar\nstructure model and for more general models. Independent measurements of the\nmass and radius, together with direct spectroscopic measurements of the\nfine-structure constant in white dwarf atmospheres lead to constraints on\ncombinations of the two phenomenological parameters describing the underlying\nunification scenario (one of which is related to the strong sector of the\ntheory while the other is related to the electroweak sector). While currently\navailable measurements do not yet provide stringent constraints, we show that\nforthcoming improvements, expected for example from the Gaia satellite, can\nbreak parameter degeneracies and lead to constraints that ideally complement\nthose obtained from local laboratory tests using atomic clocks.\n", "  On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo\ngravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron\nstar inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one\nper $8.0\\times10^4$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be\nbetween 0.86 and 2.26 $M_\\odot$, in agreement with masses of known neutron\nstars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron\nstars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 $M_\\odot$,\nwith the total mass of the system $2.74^{+0.04}_{-0.01}\\,M_\\odot$. The source\nwas localized within a sky region of 28 deg$^2$ (90% probability) and had a\nluminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-14}$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely\nlocalized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray\nburst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence,\ncorroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first\ndirect evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts.\nSubsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic\nspectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event\nas a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and\nelectromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter,\ngravitation and cosmology.\n", "  The detection of GW170817 in both gravitational waves and electromagnetic\nwaves heralds the age of gravitational-wave multi-messenger astronomy. On 17\nAugust 2017 the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors observed GW170817, a strong\nsignal from the merger of a binary neutron-star system. Less than 2 seconds\nafter the merger, a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A) was detected within a region\nof the sky consistent with the LIGO-Virgo-derived location of the\ngravitational-wave source. This sky region was subsequently observed by optical\nastronomy facilities, resulting in the identification of an optical transient\nsignal within $\\sim 10$ arcsec of the galaxy NGC 4993. These multi-messenger\nobservations allow us to use GW170817 as a standard siren, the\ngravitational-wave analog of an astronomical standard candle, to measure the\nHubble constant. This quantity, which represents the local expansion rate of\nthe Universe, sets the overall scale of the Universe and is of fundamental\nimportance to cosmology. Our measurement combines the distance to the source\ninferred purely from the gravitational-wave signal with the recession velocity\ninferred from measurements of the redshift using electromagnetic data. This\napproach does not require any form of cosmic \"distance ladder;\" the\ngravitational wave analysis can be used to estimate the luminosity distance out\nto cosmological scales directly, without the use of intermediate astronomical\ndistance measurements. We determine the Hubble constant to be\n$70.0^{+12.0}_{-8.0} \\, \\mathrm{km} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$\n(maximum a posteriori and 68% credible interval). This is consistent with\nexisting measurements, while being completely independent of them. Additional\nstandard-siren measurements from future gravitational-wave sources will provide\nprecision constraints of this important cosmological parameter.\n", "  We present UV, optical, and NIR photometry of the first electromagnetic\ncounterpart to a gravitational wave source from Advanced LIGO/Virgo, the binary\nneutron star merger GW170817. Our data set extends from the discovery of the\noptical counterpart at $0.47$ days to $18.5$ days post-merger, and includes\nobservations with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), Gemini-South/FLAMINGOS-2\n(GS/F2), and the {\\it Hubble Space Telescope} ({\\it HST}). The spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) inferred from this photometry at $0.6$ days is well\ndescribed by a blackbody model with $T\\approx 8300$ K, a radius of $R\\approx\n4.5\\times 10^{14}$ cm (corresponding to an expansion velocity of $v\\approx\n0.3c$), and a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol}\\approx 5\\times10^{41}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. At $1.5$ days we find a multi-component SED across the optical and\nNIR, and subsequently we observe rapid fading in the UV and blue optical bands\nand significant reddening of the optical/NIR colors. Modeling the entire data\nset we find that models with heating from radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni, or\nthose with only a single component of opacity from $r$-process elements, fail\nto capture the rapid optical decline and red optical/NIR colors. Instead,\nmodels with two components consistent with lanthanide-poor and lanthanide-rich\nejecta provide a good fit to the data, the resulting \"blue\" component has\n$M_\\mathrm{ej}^\\mathrm{blue}\\approx 0.01$ M$_\\odot$ and\n$v_\\mathrm{ej}^\\mathrm{blue}\\approx 0.3$c, and the \"red\" component has\n$M_\\mathrm{ej}^\\mathrm{red}\\approx 0.04$ M$_\\odot$ and\n$v_\\mathrm{ej}^\\mathrm{red}\\approx 0.1$c. These ejecta masses are broadly\nconsistent with the estimated $r$-process production rate required to explain\nthe Milky Way $r$-process abundances, providing the first evidence that BNS\nmergers can be a dominant site of $r$-process enrichment.\n", "  The merger of two neutron stars has been predicted to produce an\noptical-infrared transient (lasting a few days) known as a 'kilonova', powered\nby the radioactive decay of neutron-rich species synthesized in the merger.\nEvidence that short gamma-ray bursts also arise from neutron-star mergers has\nbeen accumulating. In models of such mergers a small amount of mass\n($10^{-4}$-$10^{-2}$ solar masses) with a low electron fraction is ejected at\nhigh velocities (0.1-0.3 times light speed) and/or carried out by winds from an\naccretion disk formed around the newly merged object. This mass is expected to\nundergo rapid neutron capture (r-process) nucleosynthesis, leading to the\nformation of radioactive elements that release energy as they decay, powering\nan electromagnetic transient. A large uncertainty in the composition of the\nnewly synthesized material leads to various expected colours, durations and\nluminosities for such transients. Observational evidence for kilonovae has so\nfar been inconclusive as it was based on cases of moderate excess emission\ndetected in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. Here we report optical to\nnear-infrared observations of a transient coincident with the detection of the\ngravitational-wave signature of a binary neutron-star merger and of a\nlow-luminosity short-duration gamma-ray burst. Our observations, taken roughly\nevery eight hours over a few days following the gravitational-wave trigger,\nreveal an initial blue excess, with fast optical fading and reddening. Using\nnumerical models, we conclude that our data are broadly consistent with a light\ncurve powered by a few hundredths of a solar mass of low-opacity material\ncorresponding to lanthanide-poor (a fraction of $10^{-4.5}$ by mass) ejecta.\n", "  The first detected gravitational wave from a neutron star merger was\nGW170817. In this study, we present J-GEM follow-up observations of SSS17a, an\nelectromagnetic counterpart of GW170817. SSS17a shows a 2.5-mag decline in the\n$z$-band from 1.7 days to 7.7 days after the merger. Such a rapid decline is\nnot comparable with supernovae light curves at any epoch. The color of SSS17a\nalso evolves rapidly and becomes redder for later epochs; the $z-H$ color\nchanged by approximately 2.5 mag in the period of 0.7 days to 7.7 days. The\nrapid evolution of both the optical brightness and the color are consistent\nwith the expected properties of a kilonova that is powered by the radioactive\ndecay of newly synthesized $r$-process nuclei. Kilonova models with Lanthanide\nelements can reproduce the aforementioned observed properties well, which\nsuggests that $r$-process nucleosynthesis beyond the second peak takes place in\nSSS17a. However, the absolute magnitude of SSS17a is brighter than the expected\nbrightness of the kilonova models with the ejecta mass of 0.01 $\\Msun$, which\nsuggests a more intense mass ejection ($\\sim 0.03 \\Msun$) or possibly an\nadditional energy source.\n", "  The merger of two dense stellar remnants including at least one neutron star\n(NS) is predicted to produce gravitational waves (GWs) and short duration gamma\nray bursts (GRBs). In the process, neutron-rich material is ejected from the\nsystem and heavy elements are synthesized by r-process nucleosynthesis. The\nradioactive decay of these heavy elements produces additional transient\nradiation termed \"kilonova\" or \"macronova\". We report the detection of linear\noptical polarization P = (0.50 +/- 0.07)% at 1.46 days after detection of the\nGWs from GW170817, a double neutron star merger associated with an optical\nmacronova counterpart and a short GRB. The optical emission from a macronova is\nexpected to be characterized by a blue, rapidly decaying, component and a red,\nmore slowly evolving, component due to material rich of heavy elements, the\nlanthanides. The polarization measurement was made when the macronova was still\nin its blue phase, during which there is an important contribution from a\nlanthanide-free outflow. The low degree of polarization is consistent with\nintrinsically unpolarized emission scattered by Galactic dust, suggesting a\nsymmetric geometry of the emitting region and low inclination of the merger\nsystem. Stringent upper limits to the polarization degree from 2.45 - 9.48 days\npost-burst are consistent with the lanthanides-rich macronova interpretation.\n", "  Recent detection of gravitational waves from a neutron star (NS) merger event\nGW170817 and identification of an electromagnetic counterpart provide a unique\nopportunity to study the physical processes in NS mergers. To derive properties\nof ejected material from the NS merger, we perform radiative transfer\nsimulations of kilonova, optical and near-infrared emissions powered by\nradioactive decays of r-process nuclei synthesized in the merger. We find that\nthe observed near-infrared emission lasting for > 10 days is explained by 0.03\nMsun of ejecta containing lanthanide elements. However, the blue optical\ncomponent observed at the initial phases requires an ejecta component with a\nrelatively high electron fraction (Ye). We show that both optical and\nnear-infrared emissions are simultaneously reproduced by the ejecta with a\nmedium Ye of ~ 0.25. We suggest that a dominant component powering the emission\nis post-merger ejecta, which exhibits that mass ejection after the first\ndynamical ejection is quite efficient. Our results indicate that NS mergers\nsynthesize a wide range of r-process elements and strengthen the hypothesis\nthat NS mergers are the origin of r-process elements in the Universe.\n", "  We present the spectroscopic evolution of AT 2017gfo, the optical counterpart\nof the first binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected by LIGO and Virgo,\nGW170817. While models have long predicted that a BNS merger could produce a\nkilonova (KN), we have not been able to definitively test these models until\nnow. From one day to four days after the merger, we took five spectra of AT\n2017gfo before it faded away, which was possible because it was at a distance\nof only 39.5 Mpc in the galaxy NGC 4993. The spectra evolve from blue\n($\\sim6400$K) to red ($\\sim3500$K) over the three days we observed. The spectra\nare relatively featureless --- some weak features exist in our latest spectrum,\nbut they are likely due to the host galaxy. However, a simple blackbody is not\nsufficient to explain our data: another source of luminosity or opacity is\nnecessary. Predictions from simulations of KNe qualitatively match the observed\nspectroscopic evolution after two days past the merger, but underpredict the\nblue flux in our earliest spectrum. From our best-fit models, we infer that AT\n2017gfo had an ejecta mass of $0.03M_\\odot$, high ejecta velocities of $0.3c$,\nand a low mass fraction $\\sim10^{-4}$ of high-opacity lanthanides and\nactinides. One possible explanation for the early excess of blue flux is that\nthe outer ejecta is lanthanide-poor, while the inner ejecta has a higher\nabundance of high-opacity material. With the discovery and follow-up of this\nunique transient, combining gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy,\nwe have arrived in the multi-messenger era.\n", "  During the second observing run of the Laser Interferometer gravitational-\nwave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Interferometer, a gravitational-wave signal\nconsistent with a binary neutron star coalescence was detected on 2017 August\n17th (GW170817), quickly followed by a coincident short gamma-ray burst trigger\nby the Fermi satellite. The Distance Less Than 40 (DLT40) Mpc supernova search\nperformed pointed follow-up observations of a sample of galaxies regularly\nmonitored by the survey which fell within the combined LIGO+Virgo localization\nregion, and the larger Fermi gamma ray burst error box. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a new optical transient (DLT17ck, also known as SSS17a; it has\nalso been registered as AT 2017gfo) spatially and temporally coincident with\nGW170817. The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of DLT17ck are unique,\nwith an absolute peak magnitude of Mr = -15.8 \\pm 0.1 and an r-band decline\nrate of 1.1mag/d. This fast evolution is generically consistent with kilonova\nmodels, which have been predicted as the optical counterpart to binary neutron\nstar coalescences. Analysis of archival DLT40 data do not show any sign of\ntransient activity at the location of DLT17ck down to r~19 mag in the time\nperiod between 8 months and 21 days prior to GW170817. This discovery\nrepresents the beginning of a new era for multi-messenger astronomy opening a\nnew path to study and understand binary neutron star coalescences, short\ngamma-ray bursts and their optical counterparts.\n", "  The historic detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star\nmerger (GW170817) and its electromagnetic counterpart led to the first accurate\n(sub-arcsecond) localization of a gravitational-wave event. The transient was\nfound to be $\\sim$10\" from the nucleus of the S0 galaxy NGC 4993. We report\nhere the luminosity distance to this galaxy using two independent methods. (1)\nBased on our MUSE/VLT measurement of the heliocentric redshift ($z_{\\rm\nhelio}=0.009783\\pm0.000023$) we infer the systemic recession velocity of the\nNGC 4993 group of galaxies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) frame to be\n$v_{\\rm CMB}=3231 \\pm 53$ km s$^{-1}$. Using constrained cosmological\nsimulations we estimate the line-of-sight peculiar velocity to be $v_{\\rm\npec}=307 \\pm 230$ km s$^{-1}$, resulting in a cosmic velocity of $v_{\\rm\ncosmic}=2924 \\pm 236$ km s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\\rm cosmic}=0.00980\\pm 0.00079$) and a\ndistance of $D_z=40.4\\pm 3.4$ Mpc assuming a local Hubble constant of\n$H_0=73.24\\pm 1.74$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. (2) Using Hubble Space Telescope\nmeasurements of the effective radius (15.5\" $\\pm$ 1.5\") and contained intensity\nand MUSE/VLT measurements of the velocity dispersion, we place NGC 4993 on the\nFundamental Plane (FP) of E and S0 galaxies. Comparing to a frame of 10\nclusters containing 226 galaxies, this yields a distance estimate of $D_{\\rm\nFP}=44.0\\pm 7.5$ Mpc. The combined redshift and FP distance is $D_{\\rm NGC\n4993}= 41.0\\pm 3.1$ Mpc. This 'electromagnetic' distance estimate is consistent\nwith the independent measurement of the distance to GW170817 as obtained from\nthe gravitational-wave signal ($D_{\\rm GW}= 43.8^{+2.9}_{-6.9}$ Mpc) and\nconfirms that GW170817 occurred in NGC 4993.\n", "  We qualify a relevant range of fractional powers of the so-called Hamiltonian\nof point interaction in three dimensions, namely the singular perturbation of\nthe negative Laplacian with a contact interaction supported at the origin. In\nparticular we provide an explicit control of the domain of such a fractional\noperator and of its decomposition into regular and singular parts. We also\nqualify the norms of the resulting singular fractional Sobolev spaces and their\nmutual control with the corresponding classical Sobolev norms.\n", "  We construct traversable thin-shell wormholes which are asymptotically Ads/dS\napplying the cut and paste procedure for the case of an acoustic metric created\nby a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate. We examine several definitions of\nthe flare-out condition along with the violation or not of the energy\nconditions for such relativistic geometries. Under reasonable assumptions about\nthe equation of state of the matter located at the shell, we concentrate on the\nmechanical stability of wormholes under radial perturbation preserving the\noriginal spherical symmetry. To do so, we consider linearized perturbations\naround static solutions. We obtain that dS acoustic wormholes remain stable\nunder radial perturbations as long as they have small radius, such wormholes\nwith finite radius do not violate the strong/null energy condition. Besides, we\nshow that stable Ads wormhole satisfy some of the energy conditions whereas\nunstable Ads wormhole with large radii violate them.\n", "  These are expository notes based on a talk given at the Superschool on\nderived categories and D-branes at University of Alberta in July of 2016. The\ngoal of these notes is to give a motivated introduction to the\nStrominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) conjecture from the point of view of homological\nmirror symmetry.\n", "  Recent experimental results provided by the CMS and LHCb, Belle and BaBar\ncollaborations are showing a tension with the SM predictions in $R_{K^{(*)}}$,\nwhich might call for an explanation from new physics. In this work, we examine\nthis tension in the type-III two-Higgs doublet models. We focus on the\ncontributions of charged Higgs boson to the observable(s) $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and\nother rare processes $\\Delta M_q$ ($q=s,d$), $B \\to X_s \\gamma$ $B_s \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^{-}$ and $B_q \\to X_s \\mu^+ \\mu^{-}$, which are governed by the same\neffective Hamiltonian. It is found that regions of large $\\tan\\beta$ and light\ncharged Higgs mass $m_{H^\\pm}$ can explain the measured value of $R_{K^{(*)}}$\nand accommodate other B physics data as well. In contrast, the type-II\ntwo-Higgs doublet model can not.\n"]}
