We prove that there\nare at most two analytic central potentials for which all the bounded,\nnonsingular orbits are closed and that there are exactly two on some surfaces\nwith constant Gaussian curvature. The two potentials leading to closed orbits\nare suitable generalizations of the gravitational and harmonic oscillator\npotential. We also show that there could be surfaces admitting only one\npotential that leads to closed orbits. In this case, the potential is a\ngeneralized harmonic oscillator. In the special case of surfaces of revolution\nwith constant Gaussian curvature, we prove a generalization of the well-known\nBertrand theorem.\n", "  High-dimensional Hilbert spaces possess large information encoding and\ntransmission capabilities. Characterizing exactly the real potential of\nhigh-dimensional entangled systems is a cornerstone of tomography and quantum\nimaging. The accuracy of the measurement apparatus and devices used in quantum\nimaging is physically limited, which allows no further improvements to be made.\nTo extend the possibilities, we introduce a post-processing method for quantum\nimaging that is based on the Radon transform and the projection-slice theorem.\nThe proposed solution leads to an enhanced precision and a deeper\nparameterization of the information conveying capabilities of high-dimensional\nHilbert spaces. We demonstrate the method for the analysis of high-dimensional\nposition-momentum photonic entanglement. We show that the entropic separability\nbound in terms of standard deviations is violated considerably more strongly in\ncomparison to the standard setting and current data processing. The results\nindicate that the possibilities of the quantum imaging of high-dimensional\nHilbert spaces can be extended by applying appropriate calculations in the\npost-processing phase.\n", "  In eikonal and quenched approximations at least, it is argued that the strong\ncoupling fermionic QCD amplitudes obtained with the help of the newly\ndiscovered effective locality property, depart from a dependence on the sole\n$SU_c(3)$ quadratic Casimir operator, evaluated over the fundamental gauge\ngroup representation. This result, in contradistinction with Perturbation\nTheory, but also with a number of non-perturbative approaches such as the MIT\nBag, the Stochastic Vacuum Models, and Lattice simulations, accounts, instead,\nfor the full algebraic content of the rank-2 $SU_c(3)$-Lie algebra\n", "  Recently it has been proposed that dark matter axions from the galactic halo\ncan produce a small Shapiro step-like signal in Josephson junctions whose\nJosephson frequency resonates with the axion mass [C. Beck, PRL 111, 231801\n(2013)]. Here we show that the axion field equations in a voltage-driven\nJosephson junction environment allow for a nontrivial solution where the\naxion-induced electric current manifests itself as an oscillating supercurrent.\nThe linear change of phase associated with this nontrivial solution implies the\nformal existence of a large magnetic field in a tiny surface area of the weak\nlink region of the junction which makes incoming axions decay into microwave\nphotons. We derive a condition for the design of Josephson junction experiments\nso that they can act as optimum axion detectors. Four independent recent\nexperiments are discussed in this context. The observed Shapiro step anomalies\nof all four experiments consistently point towards an axion mass of $(110 \\pm\n2)\\mu $eV. This mass value is compatible with the recent BICEP2 results and\nimplies that Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking was taking place after inflation.\n", "  We give a characterization of linear canonoid transformations on symplectic\nmanifolds and we use it to generate biHamiltonian structures for some\nmechanical systems. Utilizing this characterization we also study the behavior\nof the harmonic oscillator under canonoid transformations. We present a\ndescription of canonoid transformations due to E.T. Whittaker, and we show that\nit leads, in a natural way, to the modern, coordinate-independent definition of\ncanonoid transformations. We also generalize canonoid transformations to\nPoisson manifolds by introducing Poissonoid transformations. We give examples\nof such transformations for Euler's equations of the rigid body (on\n$\\mathcal{so}^\\ast (3) $ and $ so^\\ast (4)$) and for an integrable case of\nKirchhoff's equations for the motion of a rigid body immersed in an ideal\nfluid. We study the relationship between biHamiltonian structures and\nPoissonoid transformations for these examples. We analyze the link between\nPoissonoid transformations, constants of motion, and symmetries.\n", "  We examine in detail the relative equilibria of the 4-vortex problem when\nthree vortices have equal strength, that is, $\\Gamma_{1} = \\Gamma_{2} =\n\\Gamma_{3} = 1$, and $\\Gamma_{4}$ is a real parameter. We give the exact number\nof relative equilibria and bifurcation values. We also study the relative\nequilibria in the vortex rhombus problem.\n", "  One can implement fast two-qubit entangling gates by exploiting the Rydberg\nblockade. Although various theoretical schemes have been proposed,\nexperimenters have not yet been able to demonstrate two-atom gates of high\nfidelity due to experimental constraints. We propose a novel scheme, which only\nuses a single Rydberg pulse illuminating both atoms, for the construction of\nneutral-atom controlled-phase gates. In contrast to the existing schemes, our\napproach is simpler to implement and requires neither individual addressing of\natoms nor adiabatic procedures. With parameters estimated based on actual\nexperimental scenarios, a gate fidelity higher than 0.99 is achievable.\n", "  The understanding of the origin of $1/f$ magnetic flux noise commonly\nobserved in superconducting devices such as SQUIDS and qubits is still a major\nunsolved puzzle. Here we discuss the possibility that a significant part of the\nobserved low-frequency flux noise measured in these devices is ultimately\nseeded by cosmological fluctuations. We consider a theory where a primordial\nflux noise field left over in unchanged form from an early inflationary or\nquantum gravity epoch of the universe intrinsically influences the phase\ndifference in SQUIDs and qubits. The perturbation seeds generated by this field\ncan explain in a quantitatively correct way the form and amplitude of measured\nlow-frequency flux noise spectra in SQUID devices if one takes as a source of\nfluctuations the primordial power spectrum of curvature fluctuations as\nmeasured by the Planck collaboration. Our model predicts flux noise with a\nspectrum given by an $1/f^{2-n_s}$ spectrum, where $n_s=0.96$ is the spectral\nindex of the near-scale invariant primordial density fluctuations. For the\ntypical amplitude of this cosmologically generated universal flux noise we\ntheoretically calculate the average value $\\delta \\Phi /\\Phi_0 =3.41 \\cdot\n10^{-6}$ at 1Hz. These theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with\nrecent low-frequency flux noise measurements of various experimental groups.\nMagnetic flux noise, so far mainly considered as a nuisance for electronic\ndevices, may thus contain valuable information about fluctuation spectra in the\nvery early universe.\n", "  In this paper we attempt to discuss what has Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem to\nsay about physical invariance and quantum individuality. In particular, we will\ndiscuss the impossibility of making reference to objective physical properties\nwithin the orthodox formalism of quantum mechanics. Through an analysis of the\nmeaning of physical invariance and quantum contextuality we will derive a\nCorollary to KS theorem that proves that a vector in Hilbert space cannot be\ninterpreted coherently as an object possessing (objective) physical properties.\nAs a consequence, the notion of quantum object can be only defined in terms of\nnomological properties. We conclude the paper by analyzing the consequences of\nthis Corollary to KS theorem for the ongoing debate about quantum\nindividuality.\n", "  The propulsive dynamics of a flexible undulating foil in a self-propelled\nswimming configuration near a wall is studied experimentally. Measurements of\nthe swimming speed and the propulsive force are presented, together with image\nacquisition of the kinematics of the foil and particle image velocimetry (PIV)\nin its wake. The presence of the wall enhances the cruising velocity in some\ncases up to 25% and the thrust by a 45%, for swept angles of 160 and 240\ndegrees. The physical mechanisms underlying this effect are discussed by\nstudying the vorticity dynamics in the wake of the foil. Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD) is applied to the PIV measurements in order to analyse the\nkinetic energy modal distribution in the flow and to relate it to the\npropulsion generated by the foil.\n", "  We study the bifurcations of central configurations of the Newtonian\nfour-body problem when some of the masses are equal. First, we continue\nnumerically the solutions for the equal mass case, and we find values of the\nmass parameter at which the number of solutions changes. Then, using the\nKrawczyk method and some result of equivariant bifurcation theory, we\nrigorously prove the existence of such bifurcations and classify them.\n", "  We study a light-like charged collapsing shell in AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom\nspacetime, investigating whether the corresponding Vaidya metric is supported\nby matter that satisfies the null energy condition. We find that, if the\nabsolute value of the charge decreases during the collapse, energy conditions\nare fulfilled everywhere in spacetime. On the other hand, if the absolute value\nof the charge increases, the metric does not satisfy energy conditions in the\nIR region. Therefore, from the gauge/gravity perspective, this last case is\nonly useful to study the thermalization of the UV degrees of freedom. For all\nthese geometries, we probe the thermalization process with two point\ncorrelators of charged operators, finding that the thermalization time grows\nwith the charge of the operator, as well as with the dimension of space.\n", "  Recently it has been found that a certain class of hybrid star equations of\nstate with a large latent heat (strong first order phase transition obtained by\na Maxwell construction) between stiff hadronic hadronic and stiff quark matter\nphases allows for the appearance of a third family of compact stars (including\n\"twins\") at high mass of $\\sim 2 M_\\odot$. We investigate how robust this\nhigh-mass twin phenomenon is against a smoothing of the transition which would\noccur, e.g., due to pasta structures in the mixed phase. To this end we propose\na simple construction of a pasta-like equation of state with a parameter that\nquantifies the degree of smoothing of the transition and could eventually be\nrelated to the surface tension of the pasta structures. It is interesting to\nnote that the range of energy densities for the transition as well as the\npressure at the onset of the transition of this class of hybrid star matter at\nzero temperature corresponds well to values of the same quantities found in\nfinite temperature lattice QCD simulations for the 1 $\\sigma$ region at the\npseudocritical temperature $T_c=154 \\pm 9$ MeV. The pattern of the speed of\nsound as a function of energy density is very different.\n", "  We report the observation of macroscopic harmonic states in an optically\ninduced confinement in a highly photoexcited semiconductor microcavity at room\ntemperature. The spatially photomodulated refractive index changes result in\nthe visualization of harmonic states in a micrometer-scale optical potential at\nquantized energies up to 4 meV even in the weak-coupling plasma limit. We\ncharacterize the time evolution of the harmonic states directly from the\nconsequent pulse radiation and identify sequential multiple $\\sim$10 ps pulse\nlasing with different emitting angles and frequencies.\n", "  In a coalescence plus independent fragmentation approach we calculate the\n$p_T$ spectra of the main hadrons: $\\pi, K, p, \\bar p, \\Lambda, \\phi$ in a wide\nrange of transverse momentum from low $p_T$ up to about 10 GeV. The approach in\nits main features was developed several years ago at RHIC energy. Augmenting\nthe model with the inclusion of some more main resonance decays, we show that\nthe approach correctly predicts the evolution of the $p_T$ spectra from RHIC to\nLHC energy and in particular the baryon-to-meson ratios $p/\\pi,\\bar\np/\\pi,\\Lambda/K$ that reach a value of the order of unit at $p_T \\sim 3\\, \\rm\nGeV$. This is achieved without any change of the coalescence parameters. The\nmore recent availability of experimental data up to $p_T \\sim 10\\rm\\, GeV$ for\n$\\Lambda$ spectrum as well as for $p/\\pi$ and $\\Lambda/K$ shows some lack of\nyield in a limited $p_T$ range around 6 GeV. This indicates that the baryons\n$p_T$ spectra from AKK fragmentation functions are too flat at $p_T\\lesssim 8\n\\,\\rm GeV$. We also show that in a coalescence plus fragmentation approach one\npredicts a nearly $p_T$ independent $p/\\phi$ ratio up to $p_T \\sim 4 \\rm\\, GeV$\nfollowed by a significant decrease at higher $p_T$. Such a behavior is driven\nby a similar radial flow effect at $p_T< 2 \\,\\rm GeV$ and the dominance of\nfragmentation for $\\phi$ at larger $p_T$.\n", "  The influence of the non-collinear magnetic configuration on Friedel is\ninvestigated theoretically. Specifically the influence of the magnetic\nconfiguration on the induced electric charge in a N\\'{e}el type domain wall\n(DW) has been obtained. The well-known Levy and Zhang eigenstates for a linear\nDW have been employed. Then the dielectric function of this magnetic system has\nbeen obtained within the random phase approximation. Results of the current\nwork demonstrated that magnetic configuration of the system manifests itself in\nthe electric properties such as induced charge distribution. Meanwhile the\nanisotropy of the induced charge distribution in the real space provides a\nmeasurable way for the determination of the DW orientation. In addition\nanisotropy of the dielectric function in k-space arises as a result of the\nanisotropy of the magnetic configuration. Therefore the orientation of the\nmagnetic DW could also be captured by full optical measurements.\n", "  Different ways of implementing dimension-by-dimension CWENO reconstruction\nare discussed and the most efficient method is applied to develop a fourth\norder central scheme for multi-dimensional hyperbolic problems. Fourth order\naccuracy and shock capturing nature of the scheme are demonstrated in various\nnonlinear multi-dimensional problems. In order to show the overall performance\nof the present central scheme numerical errors and non-oscillatory behavior are\ncompared with existing multi-dimensional CWENO based central schemes for\nvarious multi-dimensional problems. Moreover, the benefits of the present\nfourth order central scheme over third order implementation are shown by\ncomparing the numerical dissipation and computational cost between the two.\n", "  Bi-Hamiltonian structures are of great importance in the theory of integrable\nHamiltonian systems. The notion of compatibility of symplectic structures is a\nkey aspect of bi-Hamiltonian systems. Because of this, a few different notions\nof compatibility have been introduced. In this paper we show that, under some\nadditional assumptions, compatibility in the sense of Magri implies a notion of\ncompatibility due to Fass\\`o and Ratiu, that we dub bi-affine compatibility. We\npresent two proofs of this fact. The first one uses the uniqueness of the\nconnection parallelizing all the Hamiltonian vector fields tangent to the\nleaves of a Lagrangian foliation. The second proof uses Darboux-Nijenhuis\ncoordinates and symplectic connections.\n", "  We discuss the integrability of rank 2 sub-Riemannian structures on\nlow-dimensional manifolds, and then prove that some structures of that type in\ndimension 6, 7 and 8 have a lot of symmetry but no integrals polynomial in\nmomenta of low degrees, except for those coming from the Killing fields and the\nHamiltonian, thus indicating non-integrability of the corresponding geodesic\nflows.\n", "  A general model for treating the effects of three dimensional interface\nroughness (IFR) in layered semiconductor structures has been derived and\nexperimentally verified. Configurational averaging of the IFR potential\nproduces an effective grading potential in the out-of-plane direction, greatly\naltering the energy spectrum of the structures. IFR scattering self-energy is\nalso derived for the general case; when IFR is strong, its scattering effect is\nshown to dominate over phonon interaction and impurity scattering. When applied\nto intersubband transitions, the theoretical predictions explain the\nexperimental observation of the anomalous energy shift and unusual broadening\nof the ISB transitions in III-Nitride thin-layered superlattices.\n", "  Ho\\v{r}ava gravity has been proposed as a renormalizable, higher-derivative\ngravity without ghost problems, by considering different scaling dimensions for\nspace and time. In the non-relativistic higher-derivative generalization of\nEinstein gravity, the meaning and physical properties of black hole and\nmembrane space-times are quite different from the conventional ones. Here, we\nstudy the singularity and horizon structures of such geometries in IR-modified\nHo\\v{r}ava gravity, where the so-called \"detailed balance\" condition is softly\nbroken in IR. We classify all the viable static solutions without naked\nsingularities and study its close connection to non-singular cosmology\nsolutions. We find that, in addition to the usual point-like singularity at\n$r=0$, there exists a \"surface-like\" curvature singularity at finite $r=r_S$\nwhich is the cutting edge of the real-valued space-time. The degree of\ndivergence of such singularities is milder than those of general relativity,\nand the Hawking temperature of the horizons diverges when they coincide with\nthe singularities. As a byproduct we find that, in addition to the usual\n\"asymptotic limit,\" a consistent flow of coupling constants, that we called \"GR\nflow limit,\" is needed in order to recover general relativity in the IR.\n", "  Nucleosome positioning is an important process required for proper genome\npacking and its accessibility to execute the genetic program in a\ncell-specific, timely manner. In the recent years hundreds of papers have been\ndevoted to the bioinformatics, physics and biology of nucleosome positioning.\nThe purpose of this review is to cover a practical aspect of this field, namely\nto provide a guide to the multitude of nucleosome positioning resources\navailable online. These include almost 300 experimental datasets of genome-wide\nnucleosome occupancy profiles determined in different cell types and more than\n40 computational tools for the analysis of experimental nucleosome positioning\ndata and prediction of intrinsic nucleosome formation probabilities from the\nDNA sequence. A manually curated, up to date list of these resources will be\nmaintained at http://generegulation.info.\n", "  In this note, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation is shown to be\ncapable of functioning as a Random Bit Generator, and constitutes an\neffectively infinite supply of truly random one-time pad values of arbitrary\nlength. It is further argued that the CMB power spectrum potentially conforms\nto the FIPS 140-2 standard. Additionally, its applicability to the generation\nof a (n x n) random key matrix for a Vernam cipher is established.\n", "  Samarium hexaboride (SmB6) has been presumed to show a topological Kondo\ninsulating state consisting of fully occupied quasiparticle bands in the\nconcept of a Fermi liquid. This gap emerging below a small coherence\ntemperature is the ultimate sign of coherence for a many-body system, which in\naddition induces a non-trivial topology. Here, we demonstrate that just one\nenergy scale governs the gap formation in SmB6, which supports the Fermi liquid\ndescription. The temperature dependence of the gap formation in the mixed\nvalence regime is captured within the dynamical mean field (DMFT) approximation\nto the periodic Anderson model (PAM). The scaling property of the model with\nthe topological coherence temperature provides a strong connection to the\nphotoemission spectra of SmB6. Our results suggest a simple way to compare a\nmodel study and an experiment result for heavy fermion insulators.\n", "  Via Gelfand duality, a unital C*-algebra $A$ induces a functor from compact\nHausdorff spaces to sets, $\\mathsf{CHaus}\\to\\mathsf{Set}$. We show how this\nfunctor encodes standard functional calculus in $A$ as well as its multivariate\ngeneralization. Certain sheaf conditions satisfied by this functor provide a\nfurther generalization of functional calculus. Considering such sheaves\n$\\mathsf{CHaus}\\to\\mathsf{Set}$ abstractly, we prove that the piecewise\nC*-algebras of van den Berg and Heunen are equivalent to a full subcategory of\nthe category of sheaves, where a simple additional constraint characterizes the\nobjects in the subcategory. It is open whether this additional constraint holds\nautomatically, in which case piecewise C*-algebras would be the same as sheaves\n$\\mathsf{CHaus}\\to\\mathsf{Set}$.\n  Intuitively, these structures capture the commutative aspects of C*-algebra\ntheory. In order to find a complete reaxiomatization of unital C*-algebras\nwithin this language, we introduce almost C*-algebras as piecewise C*-algebras\nequipped with a notion of inner automorphisms in terms of a self-action. We\nprovide some evidence for the conjecture that the forgetful functor from unital\nC*-algebras to almost C*-algebras is fully faithful, and ask whether it is an\nequivalence of categories. We also develop an analogous notion of almost group,\nand prove that the forgetful functor from groups to almost groups is not full.\n  In terms of quantum physics, our work can be seen as an attempt at a\nreconstruction of quantum theory from physically meaningful axioms, as realized\nby Hardy and others in a different framework. Our ideas are inspired by and\nalso provide new input for the topos-theoretic approach to quantum theory.\n", "  We construct the 12-dimensional exceptional field theory associated to the\ngroup $\\mathrm{SL}(2) \\times \\mathbb{R}^+$ . Demanding the closure of the\nalgebra of local symmetries leads to a constraint, known as the section\ncondition, that must be imposed on all fields. This constraint has two\ninequivalent solutions, one giving rise to 11-dimensional supergravity and the\nother leading to F-theory. Thus $\\mathrm{SL}(2) \\times \\mathbb{R}^+$\nexceptional field theory contains both F-theory and M-theory in a single\n12-dimensional formalism.\n", "  We use exceptional field theory to establish a duality between certain\nconsistent 7-dimensional truncations with maximal SUSY from IIA to IIB. We use\nthis technique to obtain new consistent truncations of IIB on $S^3$ and\n$H^{p,q}$ and also give a no-go theorem for the uplift of certain gaugings.\n", "  In this article we prove that Lax pairs associated with $\\hbar$-dependent six\nPainlev\\'e equations satisfy the topological type property proposed by\nBerg\\`ere, Borot and Eynard for any generic choice of the monodromy parameters.\nConsequently we show that one can reconstruct the formal $\\hbar$-expansion of\nthe isomonodromic $\\tau$-function and of the determinantal formulas by applying\nthe so-called topological recursion to the spectral curve attached to the Lax\npair in all six Painlev\\'e cases. Finally we illustrate the former results with\nthe explicit computations of the first orders of the six $\\tau$-functions.\n", "  Conformal loop ensembles are random collections of loops in a simply\nconnected domain, whose laws are characterized by a natural conformal\ninvariance property. The set of points not surrounded by any CLE loop is a\nnatural random and conformally invariant analog of the Sierpinski gasket or\ncarpet.\n  In the present paper, we derive a direct relationship between each CLE\nconsisting of simple disjoint loops (CLE($\\kappa$) with $\\kappa$ between 8/3\nand 4) and the corresponding CLE($\\kappa'$) where $\\kappa':=16/\\kappa$, a CLE\nconsisting of non-disjoint loops. This is the continuum analog of the\nEdwards-Sokal coupling (between the q-state Potts model and the associated FK\nrandom cluster model) and its generalization to non-integer q.\n  Like its discrete analog, our continuum correspondence has two directions.\nFirst, we show that one can construct (variants of) CLE($\\kappa$) as follows:\nsample a CLE($\\kappa'$), then use a biased coin to independently color each\nloop one of two colors, and then consider the outer boundaries of the clusters\nof loops of a given color. Second, we show how to interpret CLE($\\kappa'$)\nloops as interfaces of a continuum analog of critical percolation within a\nCLE($\\kappa)$ carpet. This is the first description of continuous percolation\ninterfaces in fractal domains.\n  These constructions provide new interpretations of the relationship between\nCLEs and the Gaussian free field. Along the way, we obtain results about\ngeneralized SLE$(\\kappa;\\rho)$ curves, and define a continuous family of\nnatural CLE variants called boundary conformal loop ensembles (BCLEs) that\nshare some (but not all) of the conformal symmetries that characterize CLEs,\nand that should be scaling limits of critical models with special boundary\nconditions. We extend the CLE correspondence to a BCLE correspondence that\nmakes sense for all $\\kappa$ between 2 and 4.\n", "  We examine a discrete version of the two-dimensional nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma\nmodel derived from discrete complex analysis. We adopt two lattices, one\nrectangular, the other polar. We define a discrete energy $E({f})^{\\rm disc.}$\nand a discrete area ${\\cal{A}}({f})^{\\rm disc.}$, where the function $f$ is\nrelated to a stereographic projection governed by a unit vector of the model.\nThe discrete energy and area satisfy the inequality $E({f})^{\\rm disc.} \\ge\n|{\\cal{A}}({f})^{\\rm disc.}|$, which is saturated if and only if the function\n$f$ is discrete (anti-)holomorphic. We show for the rectangular lattice that,\nexcept for a factor 2, the discrete energy and the area tend to the usual\ncontinuous energy $E({f})$ and the area ${\\cal{A}}({f})=4 \\pi N, \\,\\,N\\in\n\\pi_2(S^2)$ as the lattice spacings tend to zero. In the polar lattice, we\nsection the plane by $2M$ lines passing through the origin into $2M$ equal\nsectors and place vertices radially in a geometric progression with a common\nratio $q$. For this polar lattice, the Euler--Lagrange equation derived from\nthe discrete energy $E({f})^{\\rm disc.}$ yields rotationally symmetric\n(anti-)holomorphic solutions $f(z)=Cz^{\\pm 1}\\,\\,(C\\bar{z}^{\\pm 1})$ in the\nzeroth order of $\\kappa:=q^{-1}-q$. We find that the discrete area evaluated by\nthese zeroth-order solutions is expressible as a $q$-integral (the Jackson\nintegral). Moreover, the area tends to $\\pm 2\\cdot 4\\pi$ in the continuum limit\n($M \\to \\infty$ and $q \\to 1\\!-0$) with fixed discrete conformal structure\n$\\rho_0 =2 \\sin{(\\pi/M)}/ \\kappa$.\n", "  We propose a new non-perturbative technique for calculating the field-theory\nS-matrix directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our method involves\na discretized momentum space and a momentum cutoff, thereby truncating the\nHilbert space and making numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nachievable. We show how to do this in the context of a simplified $\\lambda\n\\phi^4$ theory in two space-time dimensions. We present the results of our\ndiagonalization, its dependence on time, its dependence on the parameters of\nthe theory and its renormalization.\n", "  Schr\\\"odinger's cat is one of the most striking paradoxes of quantum\nmechanics that reveals the counterintuitive aspects of the microscopic world.\nHere, I discuss the paradox in the framework of quantum information. Using a\nquantum networks formalism, I analyse the information flow between the atom and\nthe cat. This reveals that the atom and the cat are connected only through a\nclassical information channel: the detector clicks $\\rightarrow$ the poison is\nreleased $\\rightarrow$ the cat is killed. No amount of local operations and\nclassical communication can entangle the atom and the cat, which are initially\nin a separable state. This casts a new light on the paradox.\n", "  Samarium hexaboride (SmB6), which lies in the mixed valence regime in the\nAnderson model, has been predicted to possess topologically protected surface\nstates. The intensive investigations on SmB6 have brought up the long standing\nquestions about the discrepancy between the surface and bulk electronic\nproperties in rare-earth compounds in general. Here, we investigate and\neventually clarify this discrepancy in the particular case of SmB6 by the\nphotoemission core-level spectra. We focus on the change in both Sm and B\nstates depending on time, temperature, probing depth, and surface termination\non the cleaved (100) surface. Our spectra show that the unusual time-dependent\nchange in the Sm valence occurs within a period of hours, which is not related\nto the adsorption of residual gases. Moreover, we observe a reduction of the\nsurface feature in the B and Sm states on the same timescale accompanied by the\nformation of a subsurface region. Thus, it indicates the relatively slow charge\nredistribution between the surface and subsurface regions. Our findings\ndemonstrate that the f states is strongly involved in the surface relaxation.\n", "  We report optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) in reflection from GaSe\ncrystals of 1 to more than 100 layers using a fundamental picosecond pulsed\npump at 1.58 eV and a supercontinuum white light pulsed laser with energies\nranging from 0.85 to 1.4 eV. The measured reflected SHG signal is maximal in\nsamples of $\\sim$20 layers, decreasing in thicker samples as a result of\ninterference. The thickness- and frequency-dependence of the SHG response of\nsamples thicker than $\\sim$7 layers can be reproduced by a second-order optical\nsusceptibility that is the same as in bulk samples. For samples $\\lesssim$7\nlayers, the second-order optical susceptibility is reduced compared to that in\nthicker samples, which is attributed to the expected bandgap increase in mono-\nand few-layer GaSe.\n", "  We describe a fiber ring resonator comprised of a relatively long loop of\nstandard single-mode fiber with a short nanofiber segment. The evanescent mode\nof the nanofiber segment allows the cavity-enhanced field to interact with\natoms in close proximity to the nanofiber surface. We report on an experiment\nusing a warm atomic vapor and low-finesse cavity, and briefly discuss the\npotential for reaching the strong coupling regime of cavity QED by using\ntrapped atoms and a high-finesse cavity of this kind.\n", "  We investigate superradiance and subradiance of indistinguishable atoms with\nquantized motional states, starting with an initial total state that factorizes\nover the internal and external degrees of freedom of the atoms. Due to the\npermutational symmetry of the motional state, the cooperative spontaneous\nemission, governed by a recently derived master equation [F. Damanet et al.,\nPhys. Rev. A 93, 022124 (2016)], depends only on two decay rates $\\gamma$ and\n$\\gamma_0$ and a single parameter $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{dd}}$ describing the\ndipole-dipole shifts. We solve the dynamics exactly for $N=2$ atoms,\nnumerically for up to 30 atoms, and obtain the large-$N$-limit by amean-field\napproach. We find that there is a critical difference $\\gamma_0-\\gamma$ that\ndepends on $N$ beyond which superradiance is lost. We show that exact\nnon-trivial dark states (i.e. states other than the ground state with vanishing\nspontaneous emission) only exist for $\\gamma=\\gamma_0$, and that those states\n(dark when $\\gamma=\\gamma_0$) are subradiant when $\\gamma<\\gamma_0$.\n", "  Zipf's law for cities is probably the most famous regularity in social\nsciences. So much that, a hundred years of publication later, its status is not\nclear: is it a law of social organisation? Is it an instrument of description\nof city size distributions? Is it an element of validation of geographical\nobjects (cities and systems of cities in particular)? Empirical estimations of\nthe rank-size parameters are very numerous and contradict each other. In this\nstudy, we present the results of a reproducible meta-analysis of the largest\npool of papers regarding this issue, obtained from the collection of data made\nopen and the construction of an online interactive application which allows the\nreader to explore this literature. We find that a large part of the variations\nobserved in the measure of Zipf's coefficient is unnecessary as it comes from\nthe choice of different technical specifications in the way cities are defined,\nwhereas some of the current theories to explain the remaining share of\nvariations are challenged by our results.\n", "  In this paper we present a new family of approximate Riemann solvers for the\nnumerical approximation of solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. They are\napproximate, also referred to as incomplete, in the sense that the solvers\navoid computing the characteristic decomposition of the flux Jacobian. Instead,\nthey require only an estimate of the globally fastest wave speeds in both\ndirections. Thus, this family of solvers is particularly efficient for large\nsystems of conservation laws, i.e. with many different propagation speeds, and\nwhen no explicit expression for the eigensystem is available. Even though only\nfastest wave speeds are needed as input values, the new family of Riemann\nsolvers reproduces all waves with less dissipation than HLL, which has the same\nprerequisites, requiring only one additional flux evaluation.\n", "  In this paper, we study the competition between finite-size effects (i.e.\ndiscernibility of particles) and dipole-dipole interactions in few-atom systems\ncoupled to the electromagnetic field in vacuum. We consider two hallmarks of\ncooperative effects, superradiance and subradiance, and compute for each the\nrate of energy radiated by the atoms and the coherence of the atomic state\nduring the time evolution. We adopt a statistical approach in order to extract\nthe typical behavior of the atomic dynamics and average over random atomic\ndistributions in spherical containers with prescribed $k_0R$ with $k_0$ the\nradiation wavenumber and $R$ the average interatomic distance. Our approach\nallows us to highlight the tradeoff between finite-size effects and\ndipole-dipole interactions in superradiance/subradiance. In particular, we show\nthe existence of an optimal value of $k_0R$ for which the superradiant\nintensity and coherence pulses are the less affected by dephasing effects\ninduced by dipole-dipole interactions and finite-size effects.\n", "  We present results of a high-frequency all-sky search for continuous\ngravitational waves from isolated compact objects in LIGO's 5th Science Run\n(S5) data, using the computing power of the Einstein@Home volunteer computing\nproject. This is the only dedicated continuous gravitational wave search that\nprobes this high frequency range on S5 data. We find no significant candidate\nsignal, so we set 90%-confidence level upper-limits on continuous gravitational\nwave strain amplitudes. At the lower end of the search frequency range, around\n1250 Hz, the most constraining upper-limit is $5.0\\times 10^{-24}$, while at\nthe higher end, around 1500 Hz, it is $6.2\\times 10^{-24}$. Based on these\nupper-limits, and assuming a fiducial value of the principal moment of inertia\nof $10^{38}$kg$\\,$m$^2$, we can exclude objects with ellipticities higher than\nroughly $2.8\\times10^{-7}$ within 100 pc of Earth with rotation periods between\n1.3 and 1.6 milliseconds.\n", "  We report on a new mechanism that leads to the generation of primordial\nchiral gravitational waves, and hence, the violation of the parity symmetry in\nthe Universe. We show that nonperturbative production of fermions with a\ndefinite helicity is accompanied by the generation of chiral gravitational\nwaves. This is a generic and model-independent phenomenon that can occur during\ninflation, reheating and radiation eras, and can leave imprints in the cosmic\nmicrowave background polarization and may be observed in future ground- and\nspace-based interferometers. We also discuss a specific model where chiral\ngravitational waves are generated via the production of light chiral fermions\nduring pseudoscalar inflation.\n", "  Metastable states of noble gas atoms are typically produced by electrical\ndischarge techniques or \"all-optical\" excitation methods. Here we combine\nelectrical discharges with optical pumping to demonstrate \"optically enhanced\"\nproduction of metastable xenon (Xe*). We experimentally measure large increases\nin Xe* density with relatively small optical control field powers. This\ntechnique may have applications in systems where large metastable state\ndensities are desirable.\n", "  A multiple integral representation of single and joint moments of the total\nmass of the limit log-infinitely divisible stochastic measure of Bacry and Muzy\n[$\\textit{Comm. Math. Phys.}$ ${\\bf 236}$: 449-475, 2003] is derived. The\ncovariance structure of the total mass of the measure is shown to be\nlogarithmic. A generalization of the Selberg integral corresponding to single\nmoments of the limit measure is proposed and shown to satisfy a recurrence\nrelation. The joint moments of the limit lognormal measure, classical Selberg\nintegral with $\\lambda_1=\\lambda_2=0,$ and Morris integral are represented in\nthe form of multiple binomial sums. For application, low moments of the limit\nlog-Poisson measure are computed exactly and low joint moments of the limit\nlognormal measure are considered in detail.\n", "  In the paper, we make use of Manton's analytical method to investigate the\nforce between kink and the anti-kink with large distance in $1+1$ dimensional\nfield theory. The related potential has infinite order corrections of\nexponential pattern, and coefficients for each order are determined. These\ncoefficients can also be obtained by solving the equation of the fluctuation\naround the vacuum. At the lowest order, the kink lattice represents the Toda\nlattice. With higher order correction terms, the kink lattice can represent one\nkind of the generic Toda lattice. With only two sites, the kink lattice is\nclassically integrable. If the number of sites of the lattice is larger than\ntwo, the kink lattice is not integrable but a near integrable system. We take\nuse of the Flaschka's variables to study the Lax pair of the kink lattice.\nThese Flaschka's variables have interesting algebraic relations and the\nnon-integrability can be manifested. We also discussed the higher Hamiltonians\nfor the deformed open Toda lattice, which has a similar result as the ordinary\ndeformed Toda.\n", "  Inclusive jet spectra from pp and PbPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon\ncenter-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC,\nare presented. Jets are reconstructed with three different distance parameters\n(R = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4) for transverse momentum (pT) greater than 70 GeV and\npseudorapidity abs(eta) < 2. Next-to-leading-order quantum chromodynamic\ncalculations with non-perturbative corrections are found to over-predict jet\nproduction cross sections in pp for small distance parameters. The jet nuclear\nmodification factors for PbPb compared to pp collisions, show a steady decrease\nfrom peripheral to central events, along with a weak dependence on the jet pT.\nThey are found to be independent of the distance parameter in the measured\nkinematic range.\n", "  The ability to separately identify the Cherenkov and scintillation light\ncomponents produced in scintillating mediums holds the potential for a major\nbreakthrough in neutrino detection technology, allowing development of a large,\nlow-threshold, directional detector with a broad physics program. The CHESS\n(CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation) experiment employs an innovative\ndetector design with an array of small, fast photomultiplier tubes and\nstate-of-the-art electronics to demonstrate the reconstruction of a Cherenkov\nring in a scintillating medium based on photon hit time and detected\nphotoelectron density. This paper describes the physical properties and\ncalibration of CHESS along with first results. The ability to reconstruct\nCherenkov rings is demonstrated in a water target, and a time precision of 338\n+/- 12 ps FWHM is achieved. Monte Carlo based predictions for the ring imaging\nsensitivity with a liquid scintillator target predict an efficiency for\nidentifying Cherenkov hits of 94 +/- 1% and 81 +/- 1% in pure linear alkyl\nbenzene (LAB) and LAB loaded with 2 g/L of PPO, respectively, with a\nscintillation contamination of 12 +/- 1% and 26 +/- 1%.\n", "  During the last ten years, superconducting circuits have passed from being\ninteresting physical devices to becoming contenders for near-future useful and\nscalable quantum information processing (QIP). Advanced quantum simulation\nexperiments have been shown with up to nine qubits, while a demonstration of\nQuantum Supremacy with fifty qubits is anticipated in just a few years. Quantum\nSupremacy means that the quantum system can no longer be simulated by the most\npowerful classical supercomputers. Integrated classical-quantum computing\nsystems are already emerging that can be used for software development and\nexperimentation, even via web interfaces.\n  Therefore, the time is ripe for describing some of the recent development of\nsuperconducting devices, systems and applications. As such, the discussion of\nsuperconducting qubits and circuits is limited to devices that are proven\nuseful for current or near future applications. Consequently, the centre of\ninterest is the practical applications of QIP, such as computation and\nsimulation in Physics and Chemistry.\n", "  We investigate the spectral function of fermions in a $p$-wave\nsuperconducting state, at finite both temperature and gravitational coupling,\nusing the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence and extending previous research. We found\nthat, for any coupling below a critical value, the system behaves as its zero\ntemperature limit. By increasing the coupling, the \"peak-dip-hump\" structure\nthat characterizes the spectral function at fixed momenta disappears. In the\nregion where the normal/superconductor phase transition is first order, the\npresence of a non-zero order parameter is reflected in the absence of\nrotational symmetry in the fermionic spectral function at the critical\ntemperature.\n", "  Efficient thermoelectric materials are highly desirable, and the quest for\nfinding them has intensified as they could be promising alternatives to fossil\nenergy sources. Here we present a general first-principles approach to predict,\nin multicomponent systems, efficient thermoelectric compounds. The method\ncombines a robust evolutionary algorithm, a Pareto multiobjective optimization,\ndensity functional theory and a Boltzmann semi-classical calculation of\nthermoelectric efficiency. To test the performance and reliability of our\noverall framework, we use the well-known system Bi$_2$Te$_3$-Sb$_2$Te$_3$.\n", "  The paper presents my recent investigations of volume corrections on the\ncumulant products of net-charge distributions in statistical model,\ncorresponding to the data reported by the STAR collaboration. The corrected\nstatistical expectations, under simple Poisson approximations, can reasonably\nexplain the data measured in experiment. The results indicate that volume\ncorrections play crucial role in event-by-event multiplicity fluctuation\nstudies.\n", "  Paradigme shift in gauge topology, from instantons to their constituents --\ninstanton-dyons -- has recently lead to very significant advances. Like\ninstantons, they have fermionic zero modes, and their collectivization at\nsufficiently high density explains the chiral symmetry breaking. Unlike\ninstantons, these objects have electric and magnetic charges. Their back\nreaction on the mean value of the Polyakov line (holonomy) allows to explain\nthe deconfinement transition. The talk summarizes recent works on the dyon\nensemble, done in the mean field approximation (MFA), and also by direct\nnumerical statistical simulation. Introduction of non-trivial quark periodicity\nconditions leads to drastic changes in both deconfinement and chiral\ntransitions. In particulaly, in the so called Z(N_c)-QCD model the former gets\nmuch stronger, while the latter does not seem to occur at all.\n", "  Thermal stability of nanocrystalline multilayer thin film is of paramount\nimportance as the applications often involve high temperature. Here we report\non the layer instability phenomenon in binary polycrystalline thin film\ninitiating from the grain boundary migrations at higher temperatures using\nphase-field simulations. Effect of layer thickness, bilayer spacing and the\nabsence of grain boundary are also investigated along with the grain boundary\nmobility of individual phases on the layer stability. Layer instability in the\npolycrystalline film is shown to arise from the grain boundary grooving which\noriginates spontaneously from the presence of grain boundaries. Our results\nshow that the growth of the perturbation generated from the differential\ncurvature follows Plateau-Rayleigh instability criterion. Increase in layer\nthickness, lower bilayer thickness as well as lower grain boundary mobility\nimprove layer stability. Phase-field simulations show similar microstructural\nevolution as has been observed in our Zirconium (Zr)/Zirconium Nitride (ZrN)\nsystem experimentally. Detail analysis performed in this work to understand the\nmechanisms of layer instability leads us to predict measures which will improve\nthe thermal stability of multilayer nanocrystalline thin film.\n", "  A well-known feature of quantum mechanics is the secure exchange of secret\nbit strings which can then be used as keys to encrypt messages transmitted over\nany classical communication channel. It is demonstrated that this quantum key\ndistribution allows a much more general and abstract access than commonly\nthought. The results include some generalizations for the Hilbert space version\nof quantum key distribution,but base upon a general non-classical extension of\nconditional probability. A special state-independent conditional probability is\nidentified as origin of the superior security of quantum key distribution and\nmay have more profound implications for the foundations and interpretation of\nquantum mechanics,quantum information theory, and the philosophical question\nwhat actually constitutes physical reality.\n", "  In the same way as the quantum no-cloning theorem and quantum key\ndistribution in two preceding papers, entanglement-assisted quantum\nteleportation and Grover's search algorithm are generalized by transferring\nthem to an abstract setting, including usual quantum mechanics as a special\ncase. This again shows that a much more general and abstract access to these\nquantum mechanical features is possible than commonly thought. A non-classical\nextension of conditional probability and, particularly, a very special type of\nstate-independent conditional probability are used instead of Hilbert spaces\nand wavefunctions.\n", "  We find approximate solutions for the two-dimensional non-linear\n{\\Sigma}-model with Dzyalioshinkii-Moriya term, representing magnetic\nSkyrmions. They are built in an analytic form, by pasting different approximate\nsolutions found in different regions of space. We verify that our construction\nreproduces the phenomenology known from numerical solutions and Monte Carlo\nsimulations, giving rise to a Skyrmion lattice at an intermediate range of\nmagnetic field, flanked by spiral and ferromagnetic phases for low and high\nmagnetic field respectively.\n", "  We introduce a new spin chain which is a deformation of the Fredkin spin\nchain and has a phase transition between bounded and extensive entanglement\nentropy scaling. In this chain, spins have a local interaction of three nearest\nneighbors. The Hamiltonian is frustration-free and its ground state can be\ndescribed analytically as a weighted superposition of Dyck paths. In the purely\nspin $1/2$ case, the entanglement entropy obeys an area law: it is bounded from\nabove by a constant, when the size of the block $n$ increases (and $t>1$). When\na local color degree of freedom is introduced the entanglement entropy\nincreases linearly with the size of the block (and $t>1$). The entanglement\nentropy of half of the chain is tightly bounded by ${ n}\\log s$ where $n$ is\nthe size of the block, and $s$ is the number of colors. Our chain fosters a new\nexample for a significant boost to entropy and for the existence of the\nassociated critical rainbow phase where the entanglement entropy scales with\nvolume that has recently been discovered in Zhang et al. (arXiv:1606.07795)\n", "  The galaxy cluster system Abell 1689 has been well studied and yields good\nlensing and X-ray gas data. Modified gravity (MOG) is applied to the cluster\nAbell 1689 and the acceleration data is well fitted without assuming dark\nmatter. Newtonian dynamics and Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) are shown not\nto fit the acceleration data, while a dark matter model based on the\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) mass profile is shown to fit the acceleration data\nfor the radial range $r > 200$ kpc.\n", "  Using the tool of concatenated stabilizer coding, we prove that the\ncomplexity class QMA remains unchanged even if every witness qubit is disturbed\nby constant noise. This result may not only be relevant for physical\nimplementations of verifying protocols but also attacking the relationship\nbetween the complexity classes QMA, QCMA and BQP, which can be reformulated in\nthis unified framework of a verifying protocol receiving a disturbed witness.\nWhile QCMA and BQP are described by fully dephasing and depolarizing channels\non the witness qubits, respectively, our result proves QMA to be robust against\n27% dephasing and 18% depolarizing noise.\n", "  A new generation of wide-field radio interferometers designed for 21-cm\nsurveys is being built as drift scan instruments allowing them to observe large\nfractions of the sky. With large numbers of antennas and frequency channels the\nenormous instantaneous data rates of these telescopes require novel, efficient,\ndata management and analysis techniques. The $m$-mode formalism exploits the\nperiodicity of such data with the sidereal day, combined with the assumption of\nstatistical isotropy of the sky, to achieve large computational savings and\nrender optimal analysis methods computationally tractable. We present an\nextension to that work that allows us to adopt a more realistic sky model and\ntreat objects such as bright point sources. We develop a linear procedure for\ndeconvolving maps, using a Wiener filter reconstruction technique, which\nsimultaneously allows filtering of these unwanted components. We construct an\nalgorithm, based on the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula, to efficiently\ninvert the data covariance matrix, as required for any optimal signal-to-noise\nweighting. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated using simulations\nof a cylindrical transit telescope.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to characterise the abundance patterns of five\niron-peak elements (Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) for which the stellar origin and\nchemical evolution are still debated. We automatically derived iron peak (Mn,\nFe, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and alpha element (Mg) chemical abundances for 4666 stars.\nWe used the bimodal distribution of [Mg/Fe] to chemically classify sample stars\ninto different Galactic substructures: thin disc, metal-poor and high-alpha\nmetal rich, high-alpha and low-alpha metal-poor populations. High-alpha and\nlow-alpha metal-poor populations are fully distinct in Mg, Cu, and Zn. Thin\ndisc trends of [Ni/Fe] and [Cu/Fe] are very similar and show a small increase\nat supersolar metallicities. Thin and thick disc trends of Ni and Cu are very\nsimilar and indistinguishable. Mn looks different from Ni and Cu. [Mn/Fe]\ntrends of thin and thick discs actually have noticeable differences: the thin\ndisc is slightly Mn richer than the thick disc. [Zn/Fe] trends look very\nsimilar to those of [alpha/Fe] trends. The dispersion of results in both discs\nis low (approx 0.05 dex for [Mg, Mn, and Cu/Fe]) and is even much lower for\n[Ni/Fe] (approx 0.035 dex). Zn is an alpha-like element and could be used to\nseparate thin and thick disc stars. [Mn/Mg] ratio could also be a very good\ntool for tagging Galactic substructures. Some models can partially reproduce\nthe observed Mg, Zn, and, Cu behaviours. Models mostly fail to reproduce Mn and\nNi in all metallicity domains, however, models adopting yields normalised from\nsolar chemical properties reproduce Mn and Ni better, suggesting that there is\nstill a lack of realistic theoretical yields of some iron-peak elements. Very\nlow scatter (approx 0.05 dex) in thin and thick disc sequences could provide an\nobservational constrain for Galactic evolutionary models that study the\nefficiency of stellar radial migration.\n", "  Thirty years ago, the present author discussed pure state unraveling\n(stochastic quantum trajectories) of Markovian open system dynamics. The fact\nthat he considered all positive dynamics, not restricted for the\nLindblad-Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan complete-positive subclass, has remained\nunnoticed so far. Here we point out the importance of the transition rate\noperator and the merit of invariant (representation-independent) approach, with\nreference to invariant condition of positive dynamics and extension of quantum\nstate diffusion beyond complete-positive dynamics. A new result, description of\nall diffusive unravelings of positive dynamics directly follows.\n", "  Secret sharing, in which a dealer wants to split a secret in such a way that\nany unauthorized subset of parties is unable to reconstruct it, plays a key\nrole in cryptography. The security of quantum protocols for the task is\nguaranteed by the fact that Eve's any strategies to obtain secret information\nfrom encoded quantum states should cause a disturbance in the signal. Here, we\npropose a quantum secret sharing (classical information) scheme for $N$ parties\nbased on totally different principle in which monitoring signal disturbance is\nno longer need. In this scheme, the secret is divided among several partners by\nsequential transmissions of a $L$-dimensional qudit state, which can be\npractically implemented using a conventional laser and some standard\noff-the-shelf components. Our scheme paves a novel and practical way for\nquantum secret sharing.\n", "  We study the heat transport due to phonons in nanomechanical structures using\na phase space representation of non-equilibrium Green's functions. This\nrepresentation accounts for the atomic degrees of freedom making it\nparticularly suited for the description of small (molecular) junctions systems.\nWe show that for the steady state limit our formalism correctly recovers the\nheuristic Landauer-like heat conductance for a quantum coherent molecular\nsystem coupled to thermal reservoirs. We find general expressions for the\nnon-stationary heat current due to an external periodic drive. In both cases we\ndiscuss the quantum thermodynamic properties of the systems. We apply our\nformalism to the case of a diatomic molecular junction.\n", "  In the present work the authors revisit a classical problem of crack\npropagation in a lattice. Authors investigate the questions concerning possible\nadmissible steady-state crack propagations in an anisotropic lattice. It was\nfound that for certain values of contrast in elastic and strength properties of\na lattice the stationary crack propagation is impossible. Authors also address\na question of possible crack propagation at low velocity.\n", "  Homodyne measurement is a corner-stone of quantum optics. It measures the\nfundamental variables of quantum electrodynamics - the quadratures of light,\nwhich represent the cosine-wave and sine-wave components of an optical field\nand constitute the quantum optical analog of position and momentum. Yet,\nstandard homodyne, which is used to measure the quadrature information, suffers\nfrom a severe bandwidth limitation: While the bandwidth of optical states can\neasily span many THz, standard homodyne detection is inherently limited to the\nelectrically accessible, MHz to GHz range, leaving a dramatic gap between the\nrelevant optical phenomena and the measurement capability. We demonstrate a\nfully parallel optical homodyne measurement across an arbitrary optical\nbandwidth, effectively lifting this bandwidth limitation completely. Using\noptical parametric amplification, which amplifies one quadrature while\nattenuating the other, we measure two-mode quadrature squeezing of 1.7dB below\nthe vacuum level simultaneously across a bandwidth of 55THz, using just one\nlocal-oscillator - the pump. As opposed to standard homodyne, our measurement\nis highly robust to detection inefficiency, and was obtained with $>50\\%$ loss\nin the detection channel. This broadband parametric homodyne measurement opens\na wide window for parallel processing of quantum information.\n", "  We consider weakly interacting bosonic gases with local and non-local\nmulti-body interactions. By using the Bogoliubov approximation, we first\ninvestigate contact interactions, studying the case in which the interparticle\npotential can be written as a sum of N-body {\\delta}-interactions, and then\nconsidering general contact potentials. Results for the quasi-particle spectrum\nand the stability are presented. We then examine non-local interactions,\nfocusing on two different cases of 3-body non-local interactions. Our results\nare used for systems with 2- and 3-body {\\delta}-interactions and applied for\nrealistic values of the trap parameters. Finally, the effect of conservative\n3-body terms in dipolar systems and soft-core potentials (that can be simulated\nwith Rydberg dressed atoms) is also studied.\n", "  Recent spectropolarimetric surveys of bright, hot stars have found that ~10%\nof OB-type stars contain strong (mostly dipolar) surface magnetic fields (~kG).\nThe prominent paradigm describing the interaction between the stellar winds and\nthe surface magnetic field is the magnetically confined wind shock (MCWS)\nmodel. In this model, the stellar wind plasma is forced to move along the\nclosed field loops of the magnetic field, colliding at the magnetic equator,\nand creating a shock. As the shocked material cools radiatively it will emit\nX-rays. Therefore, X-ray spectroscopy is a key tool in detecting and\ncharacterizing the hot wind material confined by the magnetic fields of these\nstars. Some B-type stars are found to have very short rotational periods. The\neffects of the rapid rotation on the X-ray production within the magnetosphere\nhave yet to be explored in detail. The added centrifugal force due to rapid\nrotation is predicted to cause faster wind outflows along the field lines,\nleading to higher shock temperatures and harder X-rays. However, this is not\nobserved in all rapidly rotating magnetic B-type stars. In order to address\nthis from a theoretical point of view, we use the X-ray Analytical Dynamical\nMagnetosphere (XADM) model, originally developed for slow rotators, with an\nimplementation of new rapid rotational physics. Using X-ray spectroscopy from\nESA's XMM-Newton space telescope, we observed 5 rapidly rotating B-type stars\nto add to the previous list of observations. Comparing the observed X-ray\nluminosity and hardness ratio to that predicted by the XADM allows us to\ndetermine the role the added centrifugal force plays in the magnetospheric\nX-ray emission of these stars.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a thorough study on the expansion of single trace\nEinstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes into linear combination of color-ordered\nYang-Mills amplitudes, from various different perspectives. Using the gauge\ninvariance principle, we propose a recursive construction, where EYM amplitude\nwith any number of gravitons could be expanded into EYM amplitudes with less\nnumber of gravitons. Through this construction, we can write down the complete\nexpansion of EYM amplitude in the basis of color-ordered Yang-Mills amplitudes.\nAs a byproduct, we are able to write down the polynomial form of BCJ numerator,\ni.e., numerators satisfying the color-kinematic duality, for Yang-Mills\namplitude. After the discussion of gauge invariance, we move to the BCFW\non-shell recursion relation and discuss how the expansion can be understood\nfrom the on-shell picture. Finally, we show how to interpret the expansion from\nthe aspect of KLT relation and the way of evaluating the expansion coefficients\nefficiently.\n", "  We consider the scattering of Dirac particles in graphene due to the\nsuperposition of an external magnetic field and mechanical strain. As a model\nfor a graphene nanobubble, we find exact analytical solutions for\nsingle-particle states inside and outside a circular region submitted to the\nfields. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for the scattering\ncross-section, as well as for the Landauer current through the circular region.\nOur results provide a fully-analytical treatment for electronic transport\nthrough a graphene nanobubble, showing that a combination of a physical\nmagnetic field and strain leads to valley polarization and filtering of the\nelectronic current. Moreover, our analytical model provides an explicit\nmetrology principle to measure strain by performing conductance experiments\nunder a controlled magnetic field imposed over the sample.\n", "  We investigate dynamics of probe particles moving in the near-horizon limit\nof (2N+1)-dimensional extremal Myers-Perry black hole with arbitrary rotation\nparameters. We observe that in the most general case with nonequal nonvanishing\nrotational parameters the system admits separation of variables in\nN-dimensional ellipsoidal coordinates. This allows us to find solution of the\ncorresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation and write down the explicit expressions\nof Liouville constants of motion.\n", "  One dimensional laser-written modulated photonic lattices are known to be\nparticularly suitable for diffraction management purposes. Here, we address the\nconnection between discrete non-diffracting states and topological properties\nin such devices through the experimental observation and identification of\nthree classes of non-diffracting state. The first one corresponds to\ntopologically protected edge states, recently predicted in Floquet topological\ninsulators, while the second and third are both bulk modes. One of them\ntestifies of a topological transition, although presenting topological features\ndifferent from those of the edge states, whether the other one result from\nspecific band structure engineering.\n", "  We use our previously developed identification of dispersion relations with\nHamilton functions on phase space to locally implement the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e\ndispersion relation in the momentum spaces at each point of a generic curved\nspacetime. We use this general construction to build the most general\nHamiltonian compatible with spherical symmetry and the Plank-scale-deformed one\nsuch that in the local frame it reproduces the $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'e dispersion\nrelation. Specializing to Planck-scale-deformed Schwarzschild geometry, we find\nthat the photon sphere around a black hole becomes a thick shell since photons\nof different energy will orbit the black hole on circular orbits at different\naltitudes. We also compute the redshift of a photon between different observers\nat rest, finding that there is a Planck-scale correction to the usual redshift\nonly if the observers detecting the photon have different masses.\n", "  We re-analyse the cosmic microwave background (CMB) Cold Spot (CS) anomaly\nwith particular focus on understanding the bias a mask (contaminated by\nGalactic and point sources) may introduce. We measure the coldest spot, found\nby applying the Spherical Mexican Hat Wavelet transform on 100 000 cut-sky\n(masked) and full-sky CMB simulated maps. The CS itself is barely affected by\nthe mask; we estimate a 94 per cent probability that the CS is the full-sky\ntemperature minimum. However, approximately 48 per cent (masked fraction of the\nmask) of full-sky minima are obscured by the mask. Since the observed minima\nare slightly hotter than the full-sky ensemble of minima, a cut-sky analysis\nwould have found the CS to be significant at approximately 2.2 sigma with a\nwavelet angular scale of R = 5 degrees. None the less, comparisons to full-sky\nminima show the CS significance to be only approximately 1.9 sigma and less\nthan 2 sigma for all R. The CS on the last scattering surface may be hotter due\nto the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect in the line of sight. However, our\nsimulations show that this on average only approximately 10 per cent (about 10\nmicro K but consistent with zero) of the CS temperature profile. This is\nconsistent with Lambda and cold dark matter reconstructions of this effect\nbased on observed line-of-sight voids.\n", "  We explore remanent magnetization ($\\mu$) as a function of time and\ntemperature, in a variety of rhombohedral antiferromagnets (AFM) which are also\nweak ferromagnets (WFM) and piezomagnets (PzM). These measurements, across\nsamples with length scales ranging from nano to bulk, firmly establish the\npresence of a remanence that is quasi static in nature and exhibits a\ncounter-intuitive magnetic field dependence. These observations unravel an\nultra-slow magnetization relaxation phenomenon related to this quasi static\nremanence. This feature is also observed in a defect free single crystal of\n$\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, which is a canonical WFM and PzM. Notably,\n$\\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is not a typical geometrically frustrated AFM and in\nsingle crystal form, it is also devoid of any size or interface effects, which\nare the usual suspects for a slow magnetization relaxation phenomenon. The\nunderlying pinning mechanism appears exclusive to those AFM which are either\nsymmetry allowed WFM, driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) or can\ngenerate this trait by tuning of size and interface. The qualitative features\nof the quasi static remanence indicate that such WFM are potential\npiezomagnets, in which magnetization can be tuned by \\textit{stress} alone.\n", "  We introduce a community detection algorithm (Fluid Communities) based on the\nidea of fluids interacting in an environment, expanding and contracting as a\nresult of that interaction. Fluid Communities is based on the propagation\nmethodology, which represents the state-of-the-art in terms of computational\ncost and scalability. While being highly efficient, Fluid Communities is able\nto find communities in synthetic graphs with an accuracy close to the current\nbest alternatives. Additionally, Fluid Communities is the first\npropagation-based algorithm capable of identifying a variable number of\ncommunities in network. To illustrate the relevance of the algorithm, we\nevaluate the diversity of the communities found by Fluid Communities, and find\nthem to be significantly different from the ones found by alternative methods.\n", "  We consider the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations in a\nthree-dimensional moving thin domain. Under the assumption that the moving thin\ndomain degenerates into a two-dimensional moving closed surface as the width of\nthe thin domain goes to zero, we give a heuristic derivation of singular limit\nequations on the degenerate moving surface of the Euler and Navier-Stokes\nequations in the moving thin domain and investigate relations between their\nenergy structures. We also compare the limit equations with the Euler and\nNavier-Stokes equations on a stationary manifold, which are described in terms\nof the Levi-Civita connection.\n", "  Purpose: To develop a rapid imaging framework for balanced steady-state free\nprecession (bSSFP) that jointly reconstructs undersampled data (by a factor of\nR) across multiple coils (D) and multiple acquisitions (N). To devise a\nmulti-acquisition coil compression technique for improved computational\nefficiency.\n  Methods: The bSSFP image for a given coil and acquisition is modeled to be\nmodulated by a coil sensitivity and a bSSFP profile. The proposed\nreconstruction by calibration over tensors (ReCat) recovers missing data by\ntensor interpolation over the coil and acquisition dimensions. Coil compression\nis achieved using a new method based on multilinear singular value\ndecomposition (MLCC). ReCat is compared with iterative self-consistent parallel\nimaging (SPIRiT) and profile encoding (PE-SSFP) reconstructions.\n  Results: Compared to parallel imaging or profile-encoding methods, ReCat\nattains sensitive depiction of high-spatial-frequency information even at\nhigher R. In the brain, ReCat improves peak SNR (PSNR) by 1.1$\\pm$1.0 dB over\nSPIRiT and by 0.9$\\pm$0.3 dB over PE-SSFP (mean$\\pm$std across subjects;\naverage for N=2-8, R=8-16). Furthermore, reconstructions based on MLCC achieve\n0.8$\\pm$0.6 dB higher PSNR compared to those based on geometric coil\ncompression (GCC) (average for N=2-8, R=4-16).\n  Conclusion: ReCat is a promising acceleration framework for\nbanding-artifact-free bSSFP imaging with high image quality; and MLCC offers\nimproved computational efficiency for tensor-based reconstructions.\n", "  We derive an Ito stochastic differential equation for entropy production in\nnonequilibrium Langevin processes. Introducing a random-time transformation,\nentropy production obeys a one-dimensional drift-diffusion equation,\nindependent of the underlying physical model. This transformation allows us to\nidentify generic properties of entropy production. It also leads to an exact\nuncertainty equality relating the Fano factor of entropy production and the\nFano factor of the random time, which we also generalize to non steady-state\nconditions.\n", "  We present a holographic description of the thermal behavior of $ b \\bar b$\nheavy vector mesons inside a plasma at finite temperature and density. The\nmeson dissociation in the medium is represented by the decrease in the height\nof the spectral function peaks. In order to find a description for the\nevolution of the quasi-states with temperature and chemical potential it is\ncrucial to use a model that is consistent with the decay constant behavior. The\nreason is that the height of a spectral function peak is related to the value\nof the zero temperature decay constant of the corresponding particle. AdS/QCD\nholographic models are in general not consistent with the observation that\ndecay constants of heavy vector mesons decrease with radial excitation level.\nHowever, it was recently shown that using a soft wall background and\ncalculating the correlation functions at a finite position of anti-de Sitter\nspace, associated with an ultraviolet energy scale, it is possible to describe\nthe observed behavior. Here we extend this proposal to the case of finite\ntemperature $T $ and chemical potential $\\mu $. A clear picture of the\ndissociation of bottomonium states as a function of $ \\mu $ and $T$ emerges\nfrom the spectral function. The energy scales where the change in chemical\npotential leads to changes in the thermal properties of the mesons is\nconsistent with QCD expectations.\n", "  We explore double Higgs production via gluon fusion in the $b\\bar{b} \\gamma\n\\gamma $ channel at the high-luminosity LHC using machine learning tools. We\nfirst propose a Bayesian optimization approach to select cuts on kinematic\nvariables, obtaining a $30-50$ \\% increase in the significance compared to\ncurrent results in the literature. We show that this improvement persists once\nsystematic uncertainties are taken into account. We next use boosted decision\ntrees (BDT) to further discriminate signal and background events. Our analysis\nshows that a joint optimization of kinematic cuts and BDT hyperparameters\nresults in an appreciable improvement in the significance. Finally, we perform\na multivariate analysis of the output scores of the BDT. We find that assuming\na very low level of systematics, the techniques proposed here will be able to\nconfirm the production of a pair of Standard Model Higgs bosons at 5$\\sigma$\nlevel with 3 ab$^{-1}$ of data. Assuming a more realistic projection of the\nlevel of systematics, around 10\\%, the optimization of cuts to train BDTs\ncombined with a multivariate analysis delivers a respectable significance of\n4.6$\\sigma$. Even assuming large systematics of 20\\%, our analysis predicts a\n3.6$\\sigma$ significance, which represents at least strong evidence in favor of\ndouble Higgs production. We carefully incorporate background contributions\ncoming from light flavor jets or $c$-jets being misidentified as $b$-jets and\njets being misidentified as photons in our analysis.\n", "  The structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of (STO)$_4$/(YTO)$_2$\nsuperlattice consisting of Mott insulator YTiO$_3$ (YTO) and band insulator\nSrTiO$_3$ (STO) under strain are investigated by the density-functional-theory\nplus \\emph{U} method. It is found that an insulator-metal transition occurs\nwhen a compressive strain of 0.2\\% is applied. The structural analyses reveal\nthat the presence of metallic state in such superlattices accompanies\nstructural phase transition with restoring of inversion symmetry. Further study\nshows that this strain-induced structural transition makes the $d$ energy level\nof the interfacial Ti atoms of the YTO layer move upward due to the decreasing\nof the TiO$_{6}$ octahedral volume and induces the electron reconstruction in\nthe whole superlattice systems. In addition, when the on-site interaction $U$\nis changed from 5 to 4 eV, a similar insulator-metal transition also occurs in\nsuch superlattices due to the weakened electron correlation. These findings can\nimprove our understanding of the insulator-metal transitions in such oxide\nsuperlattices.\n", "  We introduce a method to compute one-loop soft functions for exclusive\n$N$-jet processes at hadron colliders, allowing for different definitions of\nthe algorithm that determines the jet regions and of the measurements in those\nregions. In particular, we generalize the $N$-jettiness hemisphere\ndecomposition of [Jouttenus 2011] in a manner that separates the dependence on\nthe jet boundary from the observables measured inside the jet and beam regions.\nResults are given for several factorizable jet definitions, including\nanti-$k_T$, XCone, and other geometric partitionings. We calculate explicitly\nthe soft functions for angularity measurements, including jet mass and jet\nbroadening, in $pp \\to L + 1$ jet and explore the differences for various jet\nvetoes and algorithms. This includes a consistent treatment of rapidity\ndivergences when applicable. We also compute analytic results for these soft\nfunctions in an expansion for a small jet radius $R$. We find that the\nsmall-$R$ results, including corrections up to $\\mathcal{O}(R^2)$, accurately\ncapture the full behavior over a large range of $R$.\n", "  Binary systems containing boson stars---self-gravitating configurations of a\ncomplex scalar field--- can potentially mimic black holes or neutron stars as\ngravitational-wave sources. We investigate the extent to which tidal effects in\nthe gravitational-wave signal can be used to discriminate between these\nstandard sources and boson stars. We consider spherically symmetric boson stars\nwithin two classes of scalar self-interactions: an\neffective-field-theoretically motivated quartic potential and a solitonic\npotential constructed to produce very compact stars. We compute the tidal\ndeformability parameter characterizing the dominant tidal imprint in the\ngravitational-wave signals for a large span of the parameter space of each\nboson star model. We find that the tidal deformability for boson stars with a\nquartic self-interaction is bounded below by $\\Lambda_{\\rm min}\\approx 280$ and\nfor those with a solitonic interaction by $\\Lambda_{\\rm min}\\approx 1.3$.\nEmploying a Fisher matrix analysis, we estimate the precision with which\nAdvanced LIGO and third-generation detectors can measure these tidal parameters\nusing the inspiral portion of the signal. We discuss a new strategy to improve\nthe distinguishability between black holes/neutrons stars and boson stars by\ncombining deformability measurements of each compact object in a binary system,\nthereby eliminating the scaling ambiguities in each boson star model. Our\nanalysis shows that current-generation detectors can potentially distinguish\nboson stars with quartic potentials from black holes, as well as from\nneutron-star binaries if they have either a large total mass or a large mass\nratio. Discriminating solitonic boson stars from black holes using only tidal\neffects during the inspiral will be difficult with Advanced LIGO, but\nthird-generation detectors should be able to distinguish between binary black\nholes and these binary boson stars.\n", "  In this work we focus on a novel completion of the well-known Brans-Dicke\ntheory that introduces an interaction between the dark energy and dark matter\nsectors, known as complete Brans-Dicke (CBD) theory. We obtain viable\ncosmological accelerating solutions that fit Supernovae observations with great\nprecision without any scalar potential $V(\\phi)$. We use these solutions to\nexplore the impact of the CBD theory on the large scale structure by studying\nthe dynamics of its linear perturbations. We observe a growing behavior of the\nlensing potential $\\Phi_{+}$ at late-times, while the growth rate is actually\nsuppressed relatively to $\\Lambda$CDM, which allows the CBD theory to provide a\ncompetitive fit to current RSD measurements of $f\\sigma_{8}$. However, we also\nobserve that the theory exhibits a pathological change of sign in the effective\ngravitational constant concerning the perturbations on sub-horizon scales that\ncould pose a challenge to its validity.\n", "  We discuss the prospects for enhancing absorption and scattering of light\nfrom a weakly coupled atom in a high-finesse optical cavity by adding a medium\nwith large, positive group index of refraction. The slow-light effect is known\nto narrow the cavity transmission spectrum and increase the photon lifetime,\nbut the quality factor of the cavity may not be increased in a metrologically\nuseful sense. Specifically, detection of the weakly coupled atom through either\ncavity ringdown measurements or the Purcell effect fails to improve with the\naddition of material slow light. A single-atom model of the dispersive medium\nhelps elucidate why this is the case.\n", "  A first-principles approach based on Density Functional Theory and\nNon-Equilibrium Green's functions is used to study the molecular transport\nsystem consisting of benzenedithiolate connected with monoatomic gold and\nplatinum electrodes. Using symmetry arguments we explain why the conductance\nmechanism is different for gold and platinum electrodes. We present the charge\nstability diagram for the benzenedithiolate connected with monoatomic platinum\nelectrodes including many-body effects in terms of an extended Hubbard\nHamiltonian and discuss how the electrodes and the many-body effects influence\nthe transport properties of the system.\n", "  An external off-resonant pumping is proposed as a tool to control the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in ferromagnetic layers with strong\nspin-orbit coupling. Combining theoretical analysis with numerical simulations\nfor an $s$-$d$-like model we demonstrate that linearly polarized off-resonant\nlight may help stabilizing novel noncollinear magnetic phases by inducing a\nstrong anisotropy of the DMI. We also investigate how with the application of\nelectromagnetic pumping one can control the stability, shape and size of\nindividual skyrmions to make them suitable for potential applications.\n", "  Let $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a bounded convex domain in the plane and\nconsider \\begin{align*}\n  -\\Delta u &=1 \\qquad \\mbox{in}~\\Omega \\\\ u &= 0 \\qquad \\mbox{on}~\\partial\n\\Omega. \\end{align*} If $u$ assumes its maximum in $x_0 \\in \\Omega$, then the\neccentricity of level sets close to the maximum is determined by the Hessian\n$D^2u(x_0)$. We prove that $D^2u(x_0)$ is negative definite and give a\nquantitative bound on the spectral gap $$ \\lambda_{\\max}\\left(D^2u(x_0)\\right)\n\\leq - c_1\\exp\\left( -c_2\\frac{diam(\\Omega)}{inrad(\\Omega)} \\right)$$ for\nuniversal $c_1, c_2$ This is sharp up to constants. The proof is based on a new\nlower bound for Fourier coefficients whose proof has a topological component:\nif $f:\\mathbb{T} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous and has $n$ sign\nchanges, then $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{n/2}{ \\left| \\left\\langle f, \\sin{kx}\n\\right\\rangle \\right| + \\left| \\left\\langle f, \\cos{kx} \\right\\rangle \\right| }\n\\gtrsim_n \\frac{ | f\\|^{n+1}_{L^1(\\mathbb{T})}}{ \\| f\\|^{n\n}_{L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{T})}}.$$ This statement immediately implies estimates on\nhigher derivatives of harmonic functions $u$ in the unit ball: if $u$ is very\nflat in the origin, then the boundary function $u(\\cos{t}, \\sin{t}):\\mathbb{T}\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ has to have either large amplitude or many roots. It\nalso implies that the solution of the heat equation starting with $f:\\mathbb{T}\n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ cannot decay faster than $\\sim\\exp(-(\\# \\mbox{sign\nchanges})^2 t/4)$.\n", "  Solution of free particle quantum master equation with spatial decoherence\ncan be unravelled into stochastic quantum trajectories in many ways. The first\nexample, published in 1985, proposed a piecewise deterministic jump process for\nthe wave function. While alternative unravellings, diffusive ones in\nparticular, proved to be tractable analytically, the jump process 1985, also\ncalled orthojump, allows for few analytic results, it needs numeric methods as\nwell. Here we prove that, similarly to diffusive unravellings, it is localizing\nthe quantum state.\n", "  A laser is based on the electromagnetic modes of its resonator, which\nprovides the feedback required for oscillation. Enormous progress has been made\nin controlling the interactions of longitudinal modes in lasers with a single\ntransverse mode. For example, the field of ultrafast science has been built on\nlasers that lock many longitudinal modes together to form ultrashort light\npulses. However, coherent superposition of many longitudinal and transverse\nmodes in a laser has received little attention. The multitude of disparate\nfrequency spacings, strong dispersions, and complex nonlinear interactions\namong modes greatly favor decoherence over the emergence of order. Here we\nreport the locking of multiple transverse and longitudinal modes in fiber\nlasers to generate ultrafast spatiotemporal pulses. We construct multimode\nfiber cavities using graded-index multimode fiber (GRIN MMF). This causes\nspatial and longitudinal mode dispersions to be comparable. These dispersions\nare counteracted by strong intracavity spatial and spectral filtering. Under\nthese conditions, we achieve spatiotemporal, or multimode (MM), mode-locking. A\nvariety of other multimode nonlinear dynamical processes can also be observed.\nMultimode fiber lasers thus open new directions in studies of three-dimensional\nnonlinear wave propagation. Lasers that generate controllable spatiotemporal\nfields, with orders-of-magnitude increases in peak power over existing designs,\nshould be possible. These should increase laser utility in many established\napplications and facilitate new ones.\n", "  Recently it has been claimed by Chinaglia and Zerbini that the curvature\nsingularity is present even in the so-called regular black hole solutions of\nthe Einstein equations. In this brief note we show that this criticism is\ndevoid of any physical content.\n", "  Fluorescent paramagnetic defects in solids have become attractive systems for\nquantum information processing in the recent years. One of the leading\ncontenders is the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defect in diamond with\nvisible emission but alternative solution in technologically mature host is an\nimmediate quest for many applications in this field. It has been recently found\nthat various polytypes of silicon carbide (SiC), that are standard\nsemiconductors with wafer scale technology, can host nitrogen-vacancy defect\n(NV) that could be an alternative qubit candidate with emission in the near\ninfrared region. However, it is much less known about this defect than its\ncounterpart in diamond. The inequivalent sites within a polytype and the\npolytype variations offer a family of NV defects. However, there is an\ninsufficient knowledge on the magneto-optical properties of these\nconfigurations. Here we carry out density functional theory calculations, in\norder to characterize the numerous forms of NV defects in the most common\npolytypes of SiC including 3C, 4H and 6H, and we also provide new experimental\ndata in 4H SiC. Our calculations mediate the identification of individual NV\nqubits in SiC polytypes. In addition, we discuss the formation of NV defects in\nSiC with providing detailed ionization energies of NV defect in SiC which\nreveals the critical optical excitation energies for ionizing this qubits in\nSiC. Our calculations unravel the challenges to produce NV defects in SiC with\na desirable spin bath.\n", "  We establish a scenario where fluctuations of new degrees of freedom at a\nquantum phase transition change the nature of a transition beyond the standard\nLandau-Ginzburg paradigm. To this end we study the quantum phase transition of\ngapless Dirac fermions coupled to a $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric order parameter\nwithin a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in 2+1 dimensions, appropriate for the\nKekul\\'e transition in honeycomb lattice materials. For this model the standard\nLandau-Ginzburg approach suggests a first order transition due to the\nsymmetry-allowed cubic terms in the action. At zero temperature, however,\nquantum fluctuations of the massless Dirac fermions have to be included. We\nshow that they reduce the putative first-order character of the transition and\ncan even render it continuous, depending on the number of Dirac fermions $N_f$.\nA non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach is employed to\ninvestigate the phase transition for a wide range of fermion numbers. For the\nfirst time we obtain the critical $N_f$, where the nature of the transition\nchanges. Furthermore, it is shown that for large $N_f$ the change from the\nfirst to second order of the transition as a function of dimension occurs\nexactly in the physical 2+1 dimensions. We compute the critical exponents and\npredict sizable corrections to scaling for $N_f =2$.\n", "  Ten types of discrete Fourier transforms of Weyl orbit functions are\ndeveloped. Generalizing one-dimensional cosine, sine and exponential, each type\nof the Weyl orbit function represents an exponential symmetrized with respect\nto a subgroup of the Weyl group. Fundamental domains of even affine and dual\neven affine Weyl groups, governing the argument and label symmetries of the\neven orbit functions, are determined. The discrete orthogonality relations are\nformulated on finite sets of points from the refinements of the dual weight\nlattices. Explicit counting formulas for the number of points of the discrete\ntransforms are deduced. Real-valued Hartley orbit functions are introduced and\nall ten types of the corresponding discrete Hartley transforms are detailed.\n", "  Field sensor networks have important applications in environmental\nmonitoring, particularly climate change, air, water and soil quality, in\ndisaster monitoring and in border security. The reduced cost of electronics,\nsensors and actuators make it possible to deploy hundreds if not thousands of\nthese sensor modules. However power technology have not kept up. Current power\nsupply technologies such as batteries limit many applications due to their low\nspecific energy. Photovoltaics typically requires large bulky panels and is\ndependent on varying solar insolation and therefore requires backup power\nsources. Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising\nalternative, because they are clean, quiet and operate at high efficiency.\nHowever challenges remain in achieving long lives due to factors such as\ncatalyst degradation and hydrogen storage. In this work, we devise a framework\nfor designing fuel cells power supplies for field sensor networks to achieve\nlong lives and utilize lithium hydride hydrogen storage technology that offers\nhigh energy density of up to 5,000 Wh/kg. Using this design framework, we\nidentify operating conditions to maximize the life of the power supply, meet\nthe required power output and minimize fuel consumption. We devise a series of\ncontrollers to achieve this capability and demonstrate it using a bench-top\nexperiment that operated for 5,000 hours. The laboratory experiments point\ntowards a pathway to design and scale these fuel cell power supplies for\nvarious field applications. Our studies show the proposed PEM fuel cell hybrid\nsystem fueled using lithium hydride offers at least a 3 fold reduction in mass\ncompared to state of the art batteries and 3-5 fold reduction in mass compared\nto current fuel cell technologies.\n", "  The gap between first and second ranked galaxy magnitudes in groups is often\nconsidered a tracer of their merger histories, which in turn may affect galaxy\nproperties, and also serves to test galaxy luminosity functions (LFs). We\nremeasure the conditional luminosity function (CLF) of the Main Galaxy Sample\nof the SDSS in an appropriately cleaned subsample of groups from the Yang\ncatalog. We find that, at low group masses, our best-fit CLF have steeper\nsatellite high ends, yet higher ratios of characteristic satellite to central\nluminosities in comparison with the CLF of Yang et al. (2008). The observed\nfractions of groups with large and small magnitude gaps as well as the Tremaine\n& Richstone (1977) statistics, are not compatible with either a single\nSchechter LF or with a Schechter-like satellite plus lognormal central LF.\nThese gap statistics, which naturally depend on the size of the subsamples, and\nalso on the maximum projected radius, $R_{\\rm max}$, for defining the 2nd\nbrightest galaxy, can only be reproduced with two-component CLFs if we allow\nsmall gap groups to preferentially have two central galaxies, as expected when\ngroups merge. Finally, we find that the trend of higher gap for higher group\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_{\\rm v}$, at given richness, discovered by Hearin\net al. (2013), is strongly reduced when we consider $\\sigma_{\\rm v}$ in bins of\nrichness, and virtually disappears when we use group mass instead of\n$\\sigma_{\\rm v}$. This limits the applicability of gaps in refining\ncosmographic studies based on cluster counts.\n", "  The membrane tubulation induced by banana-shaped protein rods is investigated\nby using coarse-grained meshless membrane simulations. It is found that the\ntubulation is promoted by laterally isotropic membrane inclusions that generate\nthe same sign of spontaneous curvature as the adsorbed protein rods. The\ninclusions are concentrated in the tubules and reduce the bending energy of the\ntip of the tubules. On the other hand, the inclusions with an opposite\ncurvature suppress the tubulation by percolated-network formation at a high\nprotein-rod density while they induce a spherical membrane bud at a low rod\ndensity. When equal amounts of the two types of inclusions (with positive and\nnegative curvatures) are added, their effects cancel each other for the first\nshort period but later the tubulation is slowly accelerated. A positive surface\ntension suppresses the tubulation. Out results suggest that the cooperation of\nscaffolding of BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and isotropic membrane\ninclusions is important for the tubulation.\n", "  Recent advances in microelectromechanical systems often require\nmultifunctional materials, which are designed so as to optimize more than one\nproperty. Using density functional theory calculations for alloyed nitride\nsystems, we illustrate how co-alloying a piezoelectric material (AlN) with\ndifferent nitrides helps tune both its piezoelectric and mechanical properties\nsimultaneously. Wurtzite AlN-YN alloys display increased piezoelectric response\nwith YN concentration, accompanied by mechanical softening along the\ncrystallographic c direction. Both effects increase the electromechanical\ncoupling coefficients relevant for transducers and actuators. Resonator\napplications, however, require superior stiffness, thus leading to the need to\ndecouple the increased piezoelectric response from a softened lattice. We show\nthat co-alloying of AlN with YN and BN results in improved elastic properties\nwhile retaining most of the piezoelectric enhancements from YN alloying. This\nfinding may lead to new avenues for tuning the design properties of\npiezoelectrics through composition-property maps.\n  Keywords: piezoelectricity, electromechanical coupling, density functional\ntheory, co-alloying\n", "  In this work we address the reheating issue in the context of $F(R)$ gravity,\nfor theories that the inflationary era does not obey the slow-roll condition\nbut the constant-roll condition is assumed. As it is known, the reheating era\ntakes place after the end of the inflationary era, so we investigate the\nimplications of a constant-roll inflation era on the reheating era. We quantify\nour considerations by calculating the reheating temperature for the\nconstant-roll $R^2$ model and we compare to the standard reheating temperature\nin the context of $F(R)$ gravity. As we demonstrate, the new reheating\ntemperature may differ from the standard one, and in addition we show how the\nreheating era may restrict the constant-roll era by constraining the\nconstant-roll parameter.\n", "  We show that the spontaneous scalarization scenario in scalar-tensor theories\nis a specific case of a more general phenomenon. The key fact is that the\ninstability causing the spontaneous growth in scalars is due to the nonminimal\ncoupling in the theory, and not related to the nature of the scalar. Another\nfield with the same form of coupling undergoes spontaneous growth as well. We\nexplicitly demonstrate this idea for vectors, naming it \"spontaneous\nvectorization\", and study spherically symmetric neutron stars in such a theory.\nWe also comment on other tensor fields the idea can be applied, naming the\ngeneral mechanism \"spontaneous tensorization\".\n", "  J. Willard Gibbs' Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics was the\ndefinitive work of one of America's greatest physicists. Gibbs' book on\nstatistical mechanics establishes the basic principles and fundamental results\nthat have flowered into the modern field of statistical mechanics. However, at\na number of points, Gibbs' teachings on statistical mechanics diverge from\npositions on the canonical ensemble found in more recent works, at points where\nseemingly there should be agreement. The objective of this paper is to note\nsome of these points, so that Gibbs' actual positions are not misrepresented to\nfuture generations of students.\n", "  Motivated by the recent hints of lepton flavour non-universality in $B$-meson\nsemi-leptonic decays, we study the constraints of perturbative unitarity on the\nnew physics interpretation of the anomalies in $b \\to c \\ell \\bar \\nu$ and $b\n\\to s \\ell \\bar \\ell$ transitions. Within an effective field theory approach we\nfind that $2 \\to 2$ fermion scattering amplitudes saturate the unitarity bound\nbelow 9 TeV and 80 TeV, respectively for $b \\to c \\ell \\bar \\nu$ and $b \\to s\n\\ell \\bar \\ell$ transitions. Stronger bounds, up to few TeV, are obtained when\nthe leading effective operators are oriented in the direction of the third\ngeneration, as suggested by flavour models. We finally address unitarity\nconstraints on simplified models explaining the anomalies and show that the new\nphysics interpretation is ruled out in a class of perturbative realizations.\n", "  While the density profiles (DPs) of $\\Lambda$CDM haloes obey the NFW law out\nto roughly one virial radius, $r_{\\rm vir}$, the structure of their outer parts\nis still poorly understood, since the 1-halo term describing the halo itself is\ndominated by the 2-halo term representing the other haloes picked up. Using a\nsemi-analytical model, we measure the real-space `1-halo' number DP of groups\nout to $20\\,r_{\\rm vir}$ by assigning each galaxy to its nearest group with\nmass above $M_{\\rm a}$, in units of the group $r_{\\rm vir}$. If $M_{\\rm a}$ is\nsmall (large), the outer DP of groups falls rapidly (slowly). We find that\nthere is an optimal $M_{\\rm a}$ for which the stacked DP resembles the NFW\nmodel to $0.1$ dex accuracy out to $\\simeq 13\\,r_{\\rm vir}$. We find similar\nlong-range NFW surface DPs (out to $\\simeq 10\\,r_{\\rm vir}$) in the SDSS\nobservations using a galaxy assignment scheme that combines the non-linear\nvirialized regions of groups with their linear outer parts. The optimal $M_{\\rm\na}$ scales as the minimum mass of the groups that are stacked to the power\n$0.25-0.3$. Our results suggest that the NFW model does not solely originate\nfrom violent relaxation. Moreover, populating haloes with galaxies using HOD\nmodels must proceed out to larger radii than usually done.\n", "  We study a 5D bottom-up holographic model that is expected to describe the\ndynamics of the minimal composite Higgs model characterized by a $SO(5)\\to\nSO(4)$ global symmetry breaking pattern. We assume that the fundamental degrees\nof freedom are scalars transforming under some representation of $SO(5)$ and\nsubject to some unspecified strong interactions. The holographic description\npresented here is inspired by previous studies performed in the context of QCD\nand it allows for the consideration of spin one and spin zero resonances. The\nresulting spectrum leads in a natural way to a variety of resonances. Namely,\nthose transforming under the unbroken $SO(4)$ subgroup exhibit an exact\ndegeneracy between the two Regge trajectories of vector and scalar channels,\nwhile the resonances with quantum numbers in the $SO(5)/ SO(4)$ coset lie on a\ntrajectory of (heavier) spin one states and a non-degenerated one of scalar\nresonances where the four lowest lying ones are massless. These correspond to\nthe four Goldstone bosons in 4D associated to the global symmetry breaking\npattern. Restrictions derived from the experimental constraints (Higgs\ncouplings, $S$ parameter, etc.) are then implemented and we conclude that the\nmodel is able to accommodate vector and scalar resonances with masses in the\nrange 1 TeV to 2 TeV without encountering phenomenological difficulties.\nExtension to generic models characterized by the breaking pattern $SO(N)\\to\nSO(N^\\prime<N)$ is straightforward.\n", "  We investigate the effect of both strong and weak potential scattering caused\nby local impurities and extended (line) defects in the array of Luttinger\nliquid wires. We find that in both cases a finite range inter-wire interaction\nstabilises metallic state. Based on calculation of the scaling dimensions of\none-particle scattering operators, we construct the phase diagram for\nlow-temperature transport along the array. We find that unlike local impurity\ncase where only conducting and insulating states are realised (metal-insulator\ntransition driven by interactions), the extended line defects may bring the\nsystem into a mixed state where conducting or insulating behavior can be\nobserved depending on bare strength of the scatterer (metal-insulator\ntransition driven by disorder).\n", "  The degree of freedom of orbital angular momentum (OAM) is an important\nresource in high-dimensional quantum information processing, as the quantum\nnumber of OAM can be infinite. The Dove prism (DP) is a most common tool to\nmanipulate the OAM light, such as in interferometers. However, the Dove prism\ndoes not preserve the polarization of the photon states and decreases the\nsorting fidelity of the interferometer. In this work, we analyze the\npolarization-dependent effect of the DP on single-path Sagnac interferometers.\nThe results are instructive to quantum information processing with OAM light.\nWe also proposed a modified single-path beam splitter Sagnac interferometer\n(BSSI), of which the sorting fidelity is independent on input polarization and\ncan be 100\\% in principle. The single-path BSSI is stable for free running.\nThese merits are crucial in quantum information processing, such as quantum\ncryptography.\n", "  We propose an information-theoretic framework to quantify multipartite\ncorrelations in classical and quantum systems, answering questions such as:\nwhat is the amount of seven-partite correlations in a given state of ten\nparticles? We identify measures of genuine multipartite correlations, i.e.\nstatistical dependencies which cannot be ascribed to bipartite correlations,\nsatisfying a set of desirable properties. Inspired by ideas developed in\ncomplexity science, we then introduce the concept of weaving to classify states\nwhich display different correlation patterns, but cannot be distinguished by\ncorrelation measures. The weaving of a state is defined as the weighted sum of\ncorrelations of every order. Weaving measures are good descriptors of the\ncomplexity of correlation structures in multipartite systems.\n", "  The CMS apparatus was identified, a few years before the start of the LHC\noperation at CERN, to feature properties well suited to particle-flow (PF)\nreconstruction: a highly-segmented tracker, a fine-grained electromagnetic\ncalorimeter, a hermetic hadron calorimeter, a strong magnetic field, and an\nexcellent muon spectrometer. A fully-fledged PF reconstruction algorithm tuned\nto the CMS detector was therefore developed and has been consistently used in\nphysics analyses for the first time at a hadron collider. For each collision,\nthe comprehensive list of final-state particles identified and reconstructed by\nthe algorithm provides a global event description that leads to unprecedented\nCMS performance for jet and hadronic tau decay reconstruction, missing\ntransverse momentum determination, and electron and muon identification. This\napproach also allows particles from pileup interactions to be identified and\nenables efficient pileup mitigation methods. The data collected by CMS at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV show excellent agreement with the simulation and\nconfirm the superior PF performance at least up to an average of 20 pileup\ninteractions.\n", "  We revisit the chiral transition in the finite density Sakai-Sugimoto model\nand find that, at fixed temperature $T$, the magnetisation near the critical\nline $\\mu_c(B)$ acts as an order parameter to distinguish Inverse Magnetic\nCatalysis from Magnetic Catalysis. Moreover, we propose a universal relation\nbetween $\\mu_c (B)$ and the magnetisation that allows us to predict the\nbehaviour of the former from the behaviour of the latter. We find that a\nsimilar relation holds, at fixed chemical potential $\\mu$, for the critical\nline $T_c(B)$. Our results are obtained by investigating a fully numerical\nsolution to the relevant equations. At low temperatures our results reduce to\nthose obtained by Preis, Rebhan and Schmitt [JHEP 1103 (2011) 033], based on a\nsemi-analytic approximation.\n", "  Recently, a hydrodynamic description of local equilibrium dynamics in quantum\nintegrable systems was discovered. In the diffusionless limit, this is\nequivalent to a certain \"Bethe-Boltzmann\" kinetic equation, which has the form\nof an integro-differential conservation law in $(1+1)$D. The purpose of the\npresent work is to investigate the sense in which the Bethe-Boltzmann equation\ndefines an \"integrable kinetic equation\". To this end, we study a class of $N$\ndimensional systems of evolution equations that arise naturally as\nfinite-dimensional approximations to the Bethe-Boltzmann equation. We obtain\nnon-local Poisson brackets and Hamiltonian densities for these equations and\nderive an infinite family of first integrals, parameterized by $N$ functional\ndegrees of freedom. We find that the conserved charges arising from quantum\nintegrability map to Casimir invariants of the hydrodynamic bracket and their\ngroup velocities map to Hamiltonian flows. Some results from the\nfinite-dimensional setting extend to the underlying integro-differential\nequation, providing evidence for its integrability in the hydrodynamic sense.\n", "  A measurement of the cross section for top quark-antiquark (tt-bar) pairs\nproduced in association with a photon in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) =\n8 TeV is presented. The analysis uses data collected with the CMS detector at\nthe LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 inverse femtobarns.\nThe signal is defined as the production of a tt-bar pair in association with a\nphoton having a transverse energy larger than 25 GeV and an absolute\npseudorapidity smaller than 1.44. The measurement is performed in the fiducial\nphase space corresponding to the semileptonic decay chain of the tt-bar pair,\nand the cross section is measured relative to the inclusive tt-bar pair\nproduction cross section. The fiducial cross section for associated tt-bar pair\nand photon production is found to be 127 +/- 27 (stat + syst) fb per\nsemileptonic final state. The measured value is in agreement with the\ntheoretical prediction.\n", "  A full description of a magnetic sample includes a correct treatment of the\nboundary conditions (BCs). This is in particular important in thin film\nsystems, where even bulk properties might be modified by the properties of the\nboundary of the sample. We study generic ferromagnets with broken spatial\ninversion symmetry and derive the general micromagnetic BCs of a system with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). We demonstrate that the BCs require\nthe full tensorial structure of the third-rank DMI tensor and not just the\nantisymmetric part, which is usually taken into account. Specifically, we study\nsystems with $C_{\\infty v}$ symmetry and explore the consequences of the DMI.\nInterestingly, we find that the DMI already in the simplest case of a\nferromagnetic thin-film leads to a purely boundary-driven magnetic twist state\nat the edges of the sample. The twist state represents a new type of\nDMI-induced spin structure, which is completely independent of the internal DMI\nfield. We estimate the size of the texture-induced magnetoresistance effect\nbeing in the range of that of domain walls.\n", "  We investigate the effect of counter-rotating-wave terms on the\nnon-Markovianity in quantum open systems by employing the hierarchical\nequations of motion in the framework of the non-Markovian quantum state\ndiffusion approach. As illustrative examples, the non-Markovian memory effect\nof a qubit embedded in a bosonic and a fermionic environment at zero\ntemperature are analyzed. It is found that the counter-rotating-wave terms are\nable to enhance the observed non-Markovianity no matter the environment is\ncomposed of bosons or fermions. This result suggests that the rotating-wave\napproximation may inevitably reduce the non-Markovianity in quantum open\nsystems. Moreover, we find that the modification of the non-Markovianity due to\nthe different statistical properties of environmental modes becomes larger with\nthe increase of the system-environment coupling strength.\n", "  We study $D \\geq 4$-dimensional half-maximal flux backgrounds using\nexceptional field theory. We define the relevant generalised structures and\nalso find the integrability conditions which give warped half-maximal\n$\\mathrm{Minkowski}_D$ and $\\mathrm{AdS}_D$ vacua. We then show how to obtain\nconsistent truncations of type II / 11-dimensional SUGRA which break half the\nsupersymmetry. Such truncations can be defined on backgrounds admitting\nexceptional generalised $\\mathrm{SO}(d-1-N)$ structures, where $d = 11 - D$,\nand $N$ is the number of vector multiplets obtained in the lower-dimensional\ntheory. Our procedure yields the most general embedding tensors satisfying the\nlinear constraint of half-maximal gauged SUGRA. We use this to prove that all\n$D\\geq 4$ half-maximal warped $\\mathrm{AdS}_D$ and Minkowski$_D$ vacua of type\nII / 11-dimensional SUGRA admit a consistent truncation keeping only the\ngravitational supermultiplet. We also show to obtain heterotic double field\ntheory from exceptional field theory and comment on the M-theory / heterotic\nduality. In five dimensions, we find a new $\\mathrm{SO}(5,N)$ double field\ntheory with a $(6+N)$-dimensional extended space. Its section condition has one\nsolution corresponding to 10-dimensional ${\\cal N}=1$ supergravity and another\nyielding six-dimensional ${\\cal N}=\\left(2,0\\right)$ SUGRA.\n", "  Results of a search for a long-range monopole-dipole coupling between the\nmass of the Earth and rubidium (Rb) nuclear spins are reported. The experiment\nsimultaneously measures the spin precession frequencies of overlapping\nensembles of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb atoms contained within an evacuated,\nantirelaxation-coated vapor cell. The nuclear structure of the Rb isotopes\nmakes the experiment particularly sensitive to spin-dependent interactions of\nthe proton. The spin-dependent component of the gravitational energy of the\nproton in the Earth's field is found to be smaller than $3 \\times 10^{-18}~{\\rm\neV}$, improving laboratory constraints on long-range monopole-dipole\ninteractions by over three orders of magnitude.\n", "  Frustrated magnetic systems exhibit many fascinating phases. Prime among them\nare quantum spin liquids, where the magnetic moments do not order even at zero\ntemperature. A subclass of quantum spin liquids called Kitaev spin liquids are\nparticularly interesting, because they are exactly solvable, can be realized in\ncertain materials, and show a large variety of gapless and gapped phases. Here,\nwe show that non-symmorphic symmetries can enrich spin liquid phases, such that\nthe low-energy spinon degrees of freedom form three-dimensional Dirac cones or\nnodal chains. In addition, we suggest how such Kitaev spin liquids may be\nrealized in metal-organic-frameworks.\n", "  We study various definitions of the gravitational field energy based on the\nusage of isometric embeddings in the Regge-Teitelboim approach. For the\nembedding theory we consider the coordinate translations on the surface as well\nas the coordinate translations in the flat bulk. In the latter case the\nindependent definition of gravitational energy-momentum tensor appears as a\nNoether current corresponding to global inner symmetry. In the field-theoretic\nform of this approach (splitting theory) we consider Noether procedure and the\nalternative method of energy-momentum tensor defining by varying the action of\nthe theory with respect to flat bulk metric. As a result we obtain energy\ndefinition in field-theoretic form of embedding theory which, among the other\nfeatures, gives a nontrivial result for the solutions of embedding theory which\nare also solutions of Einstein equations. The question of energy localization\nis also discussed.\n", "  The set of pure spin states with vanishing spin expectation value can be\nregarded as the set of the less coherent pure spin states. This set can be\ndivided into a finite number of nested subsets on the basis of higher order\nmoments of the spin operators. This subdivision relies on the notion of\nanticoherent spin state to order $t$: A spin state is said to be anticoherent\nto order $t$ if the moment of order $k$ of the spin components along any\ndirections are equal for $k= 1, 2,\\ldots, t$. Most spin states are neither\ncoherent nor anticoherent, but can be arbitrary close to one or the other. In\norder to quantify the degree of anticoherence of pure spin states, we introduce\nthe notion of anticoherence measures. By relying on the mapping between\nspin-$j$ states and symmetric states of $2j$ spin-$1/2$ (Majorana\nrepresentation), we present a systematic way of constructing anticoherence\nmeasures to any order. We briefly discuss their connection with measures of\nquantum coherence. Finally, we illustrate our measures on various spin states\nand use them to investigate the problem of the existence of anticoherent spin\nstates with degenerated Majorana points.\n", "  In this paper we propose a novel supersymmetric inverse seesaw model which\nhas only one additional $Z_6$ symmetry. The field content is minimal to get a\nviable neutrino spectrum at tree-level. Interestingly, the inverse seesaw scale\nin our model is related to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking. Due to\nthat origin we are less biased about hierarchies and discuss three different\ntypes of the inverse seesaw mechanism with different phenomenologies. We can\nsuccessfully reproduce neutrino masses and mixing and our model is consistent\nwith current bounds on neutrinoless double beta decay, non-unitarity of the\nPMNS matrix and charged lepton flavor violation.\n", "  We apply a phase space expansion scheme to incorporate the N-body scattering\nprocesses in the S-matrix formulation of statistical mechanics. A generalized\nphase shift function suitable for studying the thermal contribution of $N\n\\rightarrow N$ processes is motivated and examined in various models. Using the\nexpansion scheme, we revisit how the hadron resonance gas model emerges from\nthe S-matrix framework, and consider an example of structureless scattering in\nwhich the phase shift function can be exactly worked out. Finally we analyze\nthe influence of dynamics on the phase shift function in a simple example of 3-\nand 4-body scattering.\n", "  We explore the electronic and related properties of\nCu$_{2}$MnAl$_{1-x}$Ga$_{x}$ with a first-principles, relativistic\nmultiscattering Green function approach. We discuss our results in relation to\nexisting experimental data and show that the electron-core hole interaction is\nessential for the description of the optical spectra especially in describing\nthe X-ray absorption and magnetic circular dichroism spectra at the L$_{2,3}$\nedges of Cu and Mn.\n", "  Measurement of zeta potential of Ga and N-face gallium nitride has been\ncarried out as function of pH. Both the faces show negative zeta potential in\nthe pH range 5.5-9. The Ga face has an isoelectric point at pH 5.5. The N-face\nshows higher negative zeta potential due to larger concentration of adsorbed\noxygen. Zeta potential data clearly showed that H-terminated diamond seed\nsolution at pH 8 will be optimal for the self assembly of a monolayer of\ndiamond nanoparticles on the GaN surface. Subsequent growth of thin diamond\nfilms on GaN seeded with H-terminated diamond seeds produced fully coalesced\nfilms confirming a seeding density in excess of 10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. This\ntechnique removes the requirement for a low thermal conduction seeding layer\nlike silicon nitride on GaN.\n", "  Thin elastic sheets bend easily and, if they are patterned with cuts, can\ndeform in sophisticated ways. Here we show that carefully tuning the location\nand arrangement of cuts within thin sheets enables the design of mechanical\nactuators that scale down to atomically-thin 2D materials. We first show that\nby understanding the mechanics of a single, non-propagating crack in a sheet we\ncan generate four fundamental forms of linear actuation: roll, pitch, yaw, and\nlift. Our analytical model shows that these deformations are only weakly\ndependent on thickness, which we confirm with experiments at centimeter scale\nobjects and molecular dynamics simulations of graphene and MoS$_{2}$ nanoscale\nsheets. We show how the interactions between non-propagating cracks can enable\neither lift or rotation, and we use a combination of experiments, theory,\ncontinuum computational analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations to provide\nmechanistic insights into the geometric and topological design of kirigami\nactuators.\n", "  The cubic double perovskite Ba$_2$YIrO$_6$ has been investigated by the local\nprobe techniques nuclear magnetic resonance ($^{89}$Y NMR) and muon spin\nrotation (muSR). Both methods confirm the absence of magnetic long-range order\nin this compound but find evidence for diluted localized paramagnetic moments.\nNMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 measurements suggest a slowing down of\nlocalized spin moments at low temperatures. An increase of the muSR\nspin-lattice relaxation rate lambda confirms the presence of weak magnetism in\nBa$_2$YIrO$_6$ . However, these findings cannot be explained by the recently\nsuggested excitonic type of magnetism. Instead, they point towards tiny amounts\nof localized paramagnetic spin centers leading to this magnetic response on the\nbackground of a simple nonmagnetic ground state of the 5d$^4$ ($J=0)$\nelectronic configuration of Ir$^{5+}$.\n", "  We study a coevolving nonlinear voter model describing the coupled evolution\nof the states of the nodes and the network topology. Nonlinearity of the\ninteraction is measured by a parameter q. The network topology changes by\nrewiring links at a rate p. By analytical and numerical analysis we obtain a\nphase diagram in p, q parameter space with three different phases: Dynamically\nactive coexistence phase in a single component network, absorbing consensus\nphase in a single component network, and absorbing phase in a fragmented\nnetwork. For finite systems the active phase has a lifetime that grows\nexponentially with system size, at variance with the similar phase for the\nlinear voter model that has a lifetime proportional to system size. We find\nthree transition lines that meet at the point of the fragmentation transition\nof the linear voter model. A first transition line corresponds to a continuous\nabsorbing transition between the active and fragmented phases. The other two\ntransition lines are discontinuous transitions fundamentally different from the\ntransition of the linear voter model. One is a fragmentation transition between\nthe consensus and fragmented phases, and the other is an absorbing transition\nin a single component network between the active and consensus phases.\n", "  Recent experiments indicate that superconductivity in Bi$_2$Se$_3$\nintercalated with Cu, Nb or Sr is nematic with rotational symmetry breaking.\nMotivated by this observation, we present a model study of nematic and chiral\nsuperconductivity induced by odd-parity fluctuations. We show that odd-parity\nfluctuations in the two-component $E_u$ representation of $D_{3d}$ crystal\npoint group can generate attractive interaction in both the even-parity\n$s$-wave and odd-parity $E_u$ pairing channels, but repulsive interaction in\nother odd-parity pairing channels. Coulomb repulsion can suppress $s$-wave\npairing relative to $E_u$ pairing, and thus the latter can have a higher\ncritical temperature. $E_u$ pairing has two distinct phases: a nematic phase\nand a chiral phase, both of which can be realized in our model. When $s$-wave\nand $E_u$ pairings have similar instability temperature, we find an\nintermediate phase in which both types of pairing coexist.\n", "  Strong-field mid-infrared pump--terahertz (THz) probe spectroscopy has been\nproven as a powerful tool for light control of different orders in strongly\ncorrelated materials. We report the construction of an ultrafast broadband\ninfrared pump--THz probe system in reflection geometry. A two-output optical\nparametric amplifier is used for generating mid-infrared pulses with GaSe as\nthe nonlinear crystal. The setup is capable of pumping bulk materials at\nwavelengths ranging from 1.2 $\\mu$m to 15 $\\mu$m and beyond, and detecting the\nsubtle, transient photoinduced changes in the reflected electric field of the\nTHz probe at different temperatures. As a demonstration, we present 15 $\\mu$m\npump--THz probe measurements of a bulk EuSbTe$_{3}$ single crystal. A $0.5\\%$\ntransient change in the reflected THz electric field can be clearly resolved.\nThe widely tuned pumping energy could be used in mode-selective excitation\nexperiments and applied to many strongly correlated electron systems.\n", "  Charge and heat transfer through a nanoscale conductor is not only determined\nby the transmission properties of the electrons, but can also be strongly\nimpacted by coupling to other degrees of freedom in the environment of the\nconductor. Here, we analyze the influence of the electromagnetic environment on\na simple, yet significant thermoelectric property, the thermopower, in the\nsimple transport scenario of single-charge transfer across a tunnel junction.\nConsidering both thermal and out-of-equilibrium steady-state environments, we\nfind that the thermopower can be strongly affected by the environmental state\nand can, in turn, act as a sensitive probe of environmental properties.\n", "  (349) Dembowska, a large, bright main-belt asteroid, has a fast rotation and\noblique spin axis. It may have experienced partial melting and differentiation.\nWe constrain Dembowska's thermophysical properties, e.g., thermal inertia,\nroughness fraction, geometric albedo and effective diameter within 3$\\sigma$\nuncertainty of $\\Gamma=20^{+12}_{-7}\\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$, $f_{\\rm\nr}=0.25^{+0.60}_{-0.25}$, $p_{\\rm v}=0.309^{+0.026}_{-0.038}$, and $D_{\\rm\neff}=155.8^{+7.5}_{-6.2}\\rm~km$, by utilizing the Advanced Thermophysical Model\n(ATPM) to analyse four sets of thermal infrared data obtained by IRAS, AKARI,\nWISE and Subaru/COMICS at different epochs. In addition, by modeling the\nthermal lightcurve observed by WISE, we obtain the rotational phases of each\ndataset. These rotationally resolved data do not reveal significant variations\nof thermal inertia and roughness across the surface, indicating the surface of\nDembowska should be covered by a dusty regolith layer with few rocks or\nboulders. Besides, the low thermal inertia of Dembowska show no significant\ndifference with other asteroids larger than 100 km, indicating the dynamical\nlives of these large asteroids are long enough to make the surface to have\nsufficiently low thermal inertia. Furthermore, based on the derived surface\nthermophysical properties, as well as the known orbital and rotational\nparameters, we can simulate Dembowska's surface and subsurface temperature\nthroughout its orbital period. The surface temperature varies from $\\sim40$ K\nto $\\sim220$ K, showing significant seasonal variation, whereas the subsurface\ntemperature achieves equilibrium temperature about $120\\sim160$ K below\n$30\\sim50$ cm depth.\n", "  Black phosphorus stands out from the family of two-dimensional materials as a\nsemiconductor with a direct, layer-dependent bandgap in energy corresponding to\nthe spectral range from the visible to the mid-infrared (mid-IR), as well as\nmany other attractive optoelectronic attributes. It is, therefore, a very\npromising material for various optoelectronic applications, particularly in the\nimportant mid-IR range. While mid-IR technology has been advancing rapidly,\nboth photodetection and electro-optic modulation in the mid-IR rely on\nnarrow-band compound semiconductors, which are difficult and expensive to\nintegrate with the ubiquitous silicon photonics. For mid-IR photodetection,\nblack phosphorus has been proven to be a viable alternative. Here, we\ndemonstrate electro-optic modulation of mid-IR absorption in few-layer black\nphosphorus under field applied by an electrostatic gate. Our experimental and\ntheoretical results find that, within the doping range obtainable in our\nsamples, the quantum confined Franz-Keldysh effect is the dominant mechanism of\nelectro-optic modulation. Spectroscopic study on samples with varying thickness\nreveals strong layer-dependence in the inter-band transition between different\nsub-bands. Our results show black phosphorus is a very promising material to\nrealizing efficient mid-IR modulators.\n", "  The OLYMPUS experiment measured the cross-section ratio of positron-proton\nelastic scattering relative to electron-proton elastic scattering to look for\nevidence of hard two-photon exchange. To make this measurement, the experiment\nalternated between electron beam and positron beam running modes, with the\nrelative integrated luminosities of the two running modes providing the crucial\nnormalization. For this reason, OLYMPUS had several redundant luminosity\nmonitoring systems, including a pair of electromagnetic calorimeters positioned\ndownstream from the target to detect symmetric M{\\o} ller and Bhabha scattering\nfrom atomic electrons in the hydrogen gas target. Though this system was\ndesigned to monitor the rate of events with single M{\\o} ller/Bhabha\ninteractions, we found that a more accurate determination of relative\nluminosity could be made by additionally considering the rate of events with\nboth a M{\\o} ller/Bhabha interaction and a concurrent elastic $ep$ interaction.\nThis method was improved by small corrections for the variance of the current\nwithin bunches in the storage ring and for the probability of three\ninteractions occurring within a bunch. After accounting for systematic effects,\nwe estimate that the method is accurate in determining the relative luminosity\nto within 0.36\\%. This precise technique can be employed in future\nelectron-proton and positron-proton scattering experiments to monitor relative\nluminosity between different running modes.\n", "  Exploration of novel electromagnetic phenomena is a subject of great interest\nin topological quantum materials. One of the unprecedented effects to be\nexperimentally verified is topological magnetoelectric (TME) effect originating\nfrom an unusual coupling of electric and magnetic fields in materials. A\nmagnetic heterostructure of topological insulator (TI) hosts such an exotic\nmagnetoelectric coupling and can be expected to realize the TME effect as an\naxion insulator. Here we designed a magnetic TI with tricolor structure where a\nnon-magnetic layer of (Bi, Sb)2Te3 is sandwiched by a soft ferromagnetic\nCr-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3 and a hard ferromagnetic V-doped (Bi, Sb)2Te3.\nAccompanied by the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, we observe zero Hall\nconductivity plateaus, which are a hallmark of the axion insulator state, in a\nwide range of magnetic field between the coercive fields of Cr- and V-doped\nlayers. The resistance of the axion insulator state reaches as high as 10^9\nohm, leading to a gigantic magnetoresistance ratio exceeding 10,000,000% upon\nthe transition from the QAH state. The tricolor structure of TI may not only be\nan ideal arena for the topologically distinct phenomena, but also provide\nmagnetoresistive applications for advancing dissipationless topological\nelectronics.\n", "  It has been proven that the intense tightly focused Gauss beam (GB) generates\npressures in excess of a few TPa creating the novel super-dense phases of\nAluminium and silicon [1-5]. Recently it was demonstrated that the Bessel beam\n(BB) focused inside sapphire produced the cylindrical void being two orders of\nmagnitude larger than that generated by the GB [6-8]. Analysis of the\nexperimental data presented below allows making the remarkable conclusions\nbased solely on the void size measurements without any ad hoc assumptions about\nthe interaction process. First, the void size is direct evidence of strong\n(>40%) absorption of the pulse energy. Second, it is a direct experimental\nevidence of the high-energy concentration in the central spike of the focus.\nThe unique features of the intense Bessel beam interaction then allow\nunderstanding the experimental observation. This interaction generates early in\nthe pulse time the spatial distribution of excited permittivity changing from\npositive to negative values. Then the light interacts with\nzero-real-permittivity surface, separating plasma and dielectric areas, which\nleads to high energy concentration near the axis of cylindrical focus up to\nseveral MJ/cm3 (pressure range of 4-8 TPa). The effect depends on the angle\nbetween the permittivity gradient and the field polarisation. High pressure\ngenerates intense cylindrical shock/ rarefaction waves, which led to formation\nof void and compressed shell. We demonstrate that the Bessel beam proves to be\nan effective tool for producing extreme pressure/temperature conditions on the\nlaboratory tabletop. It appears that adjusting polarisation and permittivity\ngradient might be a novel way for increasing the maximum pressure. This tool\nallows for search of novel high-pressure material phases, for the 3D laser\nmachining and for creating Warm Dense Matter as those in star cores.\n", "  The Fornax Cluster is a low-mass cool-core galaxy cluster. We present a deep\n{\\sl Chandra} study of NGC 1399, the central dominant elliptical galaxy of\nFornax. The cluster center harbors two symmetric X-ray cavities coincident with\na pair of radio lobes fed by two collimated jets along a north-south axis. A\ntemperature map reveals that the AGN outburst has created a channel filled with\ncooler gas out to a radius of 10 kpc. The cavities are surrounded by cool\nbright rims and filaments that may have been lifted from smaller radii by the\nbuoyant bubbles. X-ray imaging suggests a potential ghost bubble of $\\gtrsim$\n5\\,kpc diameter to the northwest. We find that the amount of gas lifted by AGN\nbubbles is comparable to that which would otherwise cool, demonstrating that\nAGN driven outflow is effective in offsetting cooling in low-mass clusters. The\ncluster cooling time scale is $>30$ times longer than the dynamical time scale,\nwhich is consistent with the lack of cold molecular gas at the cluster center.\nThe X-ray hydrostatic mass is consistent within 10\\% with the total mass\nderived from the optical data. The observed entropy profile rises linearly,\nfollowing a steeper slope than that observed at the centers of massive\nclusters; gas shed by stars in NGC 1399 may be incorporated in the hot phase.\nHowever, it is far-fetched for supernova-driven outflow to produce and maintain\nthe thermal distribution in NGC 1399 and it is in tension with the metal\ncontent in the hot gas.\n", "  We study the effect of hotter or colder particles on the evolution of the\nchiral magnetic field in the early universe. We are interested in the\ntemperature dependent term in the chiral vortical effect. There are no changes\nin the magnetic energy spectrum at large lengthscales but in the Kolmogorov\nregime we do find a difference. Our numerical results show that the Gaussian\npeak in the magnetic spectrum becomes negatively skewed. The negatively skewed\npeak can be fitted with a beta distribution. Analytically one can relate the\nnon-Gaussianity of the distribution to the temperature dependent vorticity\nterm. The vorticity term is therefore responsible for the beta distribution in\nthe magnetic spectrum. Since the beta distribution has already been used to\nmodel turbulent dispersion in fluids, hence it seems that the presence of\nhotter or colder particles may lead to turbulence in the magnetized plasma.\n", "  In recent years, the optical control of exchange interactions has emerged as\nan exciting new direction in the study of the ultrafast optical control of\nmagnetic order. Here we review recent theoretical works on antiferromagnetic\nsystems, devoted to i) simulating the ultrafast control of exchange\ninteractions, ii) modeling the strongly nonequilibrium response of the magnetic\norder and iii) the relation with relevant experimental works developed in\nparallel. In addition to the excitation of spin precession, we discuss examples\nof rapid cooling and the control of ultrafast coherent longitudinal spin\ndynamics in response to femtosecond optically induced perturbations of exchange\ninteractions. These elucidate the potential for exploiting the control of\nexchange interactions to find new scenarios for both faster and more\nenergy-efficient manipulation of magnetism.\n", "  The Braess paradox encountered in classical networks is a counterintuitive\nphenomenon when the flow in a road network can be impeded by adding a new road\nor, more generally, the overall net performance can degrade after addition of\nan extra available choice. In this work, we discuss the possibility of a\nsimilar effect in a phase-coherent quantum transport and demonstrate it by\nexample of a simple Y-shaped metallic fork. To reveal the Braess-like partial\nsuppression of the charge flow in such device, it is proposed to transfer two\noutgoing arms into a superconducting state. We show that the differential\nconductance-vs-voltage spectrum of the hybrid fork structure varies\nconsiderably when the extra link between the two superconducting leads is added\nand it can serve as an indicator of quantum correlations which manifest\nthemselves in the quantum Braess paradox.\n", "  We obtain exact solutions to the two-dimensional (2D) Dirac equation for the\none-dimensional P\\\"oschl-Teller potential which contains an asymmetry term. The\neigenfunctions are expressed in terms of Heun confluent functions, while the\neigenvalues are determined via the solutions of a simple transcendental\nequation. For the symmetric case, the eigenfunctions of the supercritical\nstates are expressed as spheroidal wave functions, and approximate analytical\nexpressions are obtained for the corresponding eigenvalues. A universal\ncondition for any square integrable symmetric potential is obtained for the\nminimum strength of the potential required to hold a bound state of zero\nenergy. Applications for smooth electron waveguides in 2D Dirac-Weyl systems\nare discussed.\n", "  We report on the NuSTAR observations of two bright Seyfert 1 galaxies, namely\nMCG +8-11-11 (100 ks) and NGC 6814 (150 ks). The main goal of these\nobservations was to investigate the Comptonization mechanisms acting in the\ninnermost regions of AGN which are believed to be responsible for the UV/X-ray\nemission. The spectroscopic analysis of the NuSTAR spectra of these two sources\nrevealed that although they had different properties overall (black hole\nmasses, luminosity and Eddington ratios) they had very similar coronal\nproperties. Both presented a power law spectrum with a high-energy cutoff at\n$\\sim 150-200$ keV, a relativistically broadened Fe K$\\alpha$ line and the\nassociated disk reflection component, plus a narrow iron line likely emitted in\nCompton thin and distant matter. The intrinsic continuum was well described by\nComptonization models that show for MCG +8-11-11 a temperature of the coronal\nplasma of kT$_{\\rm e} \\sim$ 60 keV and an extrapolated optical depth\n$\\tau$=1.8; for NGC 6814 the coronal temperature was kT$_{\\rm e} \\sim$ 45 keV\nwith an extrapolated optical depth of $\\tau$=2.5. We compare and discuss these\nvalues to some most common Comptonization models which aim at explaining the\nenergy production and stability of coronae in active galactic nuclei.\n", "  The Tsallis relative entropy $S_q (\\hat{\\rho},\\hat{\\sigma})$ measures the\ndistance between two arbitrary density matrices $\\hat{\\rho}$ and\n$\\hat{\\sigma}$. In this work the approximation to this quantity when\n$q=1+\\delta$ ($\\delta\\ll 1$) is obtained. It is shown that the resulting series\nis equal to the von Neumann relative entropy when $\\delta=0$. Analyzing the von\nNeumann relative entropy for arbitrary $\\hat{\\rho}$ and a thermal equilibrium\nstate $\\hat{\\sigma}=e^{- \\beta \\hat{H}}/{\\rm Tr}(e^{- \\beta \\hat{H}})$ is\npossible to define a new inequality relating the energy, the entropy, and the\npartition function of the system. From this inequality, a parameter that\nmeasures the distance between the two states is defined. This distance is\ncalculated for a general qubit system and for an arbitrary unimodal Gaussian\nstate. In the qubit case, the dependence on the purity of the system is studied\nfor $T \\geq 0$ and also for $T<0$. In the Gaussian case, the general partition\nfunction given a unimodal quadratic Hamiltonian is calculated and the\ncomparison of the thermal light state as a thermal equilibrium state of the\nparametric amplifier is presented.\n", "  The barrel-region particle identification detector is crucial for extending\nthe physics reach of the Belle II experiment operating at the SuperKEKB\naccelerator. For this purpose, an imaging-Time-of-Propagation (iTOP) counter\nwas developed, which is a new type of ring-imaging Cherenkov detector. The iTOP\nconsists of 16 separate modules arranged azimuthally around the beam line. Each\nmodule consists of optical components fabricated from quartz (one mirror, one\nprism, and two bars), an array of micro-channel-plate photo-multiplier tubes\n(MCP-PMTs), and front-end electronics. The waveforms read out are processed by\nfirmware, and the resulting pulse-heights and hit times are sent to the Belle\nII data acquisition system. The detector construction was completed and the\ndetector installed by the summer of 2016, and since then the detector has\nundergone commissioning. This talk describes the construction and commissioning\nof the Belle II iTOP counter.\n", "  Heterogeneous materials consisting of different phases are ideally suited to\nachieve a broad spectrum of desirable bulk physical properties by combining the\nbest features of the constituents through the strategic spatial arrangement of\nthe different phases. Disordered hyperuniform heterogeneous materials are new,\nexotic amorphous matter that behave like crystals in the manner in which they\nsuppress volume-fraction fluctuations at large length scales, and yet are\nisotropic with no Bragg peaks. In this paper, we formulate for the first time a\nFourier-space numerical construction procedure to design at will a wide class\nof disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with prescribed spectral\ndensities, which enables one to tune the degree and length scales at which this\nsuppression occurs. We demonstrate that the anomalous suppression of\nvolume-fraction fluctuations in such two-phase materials endow them with novel\nand often optimal transport and electromagnetic properties. Specifically, we\nconstruct a family of phase-inversion-symmetric materials with variable\ntopological connectedness properties that remarkably achieves a well-known\nexplicit formula for the effective electrical (thermal) conductivity. Moreover,\nwe design disordered stealthy hyperuniform dispersion that possesses nearly\noptimal effective conductivity while being statistically isotropic.\nInterestingly, all of our designed materials are transparent to electromagnetic\nradiation for certain wavelengths, which is a common attribute of all\nhyperuniform materials. Our constructed materials can be readily realized by 3D\nprinting and lithographic technologies. We expect that our designs will be\npotentially useful for energy-saving materials, batteries and aerospace\napplications.\n", "  We show how to construct half-maximal consistent truncations of 10- and\n11-dimensional supergravity to seven dimensions using exceptional field theory.\nThis procedure gives rise to a seven-dimensional half-maximal gauged\nsupergravity coupled to $n$ vector multiplets, with $n \\neq 3$ in general. We\nalso show how these techniques can be used to reduce exceptional field theory\nto heterotic double field theory.\n", "  Correlations between the momenta of the final state hadrons measured in\nproton or nucleus collisions contain information that sheds light on the\ninitial conditions and evolutionary dynamics of the collision system. These\ncorrelation measurements have revealed the long-range rapidity correlations in\np-p and p-Pb systems, and they have also made it possible to extract the\nelliptic flow coefficient from hadron correlation measurements. In this work,\nwe calculate five- and six-gluon correlation functions in the framework of\nsaturation physics by using superdiagrams. We also derive the cumulant\nexpansion of the gluon correlators that is valid in the gluon saturation limit.\nWe show that the cumulant expansion of the gluon correlators that is used for\ncounting the number of diagrams to be calculated does not follow the standard\ncumulant expansion. We also explain how these findings can be used in obtaining\nexperimentally relevant observables such as flow coefficients calculated from\ncorrelations as well as ratios of the correlation functions of different\norders.\n", "  We study the buckling of an idealized, semiflexible filament along whose\ncontour magnetic moments are placed. {We give analytic expressions for the\ncritical stiffness of the filament below which it buckles due to the magnetic\ncompression. For this, we consider various scenarios of the attachment of the\nmagnetic particles to the filament. One possible application for this model are\nthe magnetosome chains of magnetotactic bacteria. An estimate of the critical\nbending stiffness indicates that buckling may occur within the range of\nbiologically relevant parameters and suggests a role for the bending stiffness\nof the filament to stabilize the filament against buckling, which would\ncompromise the functional relevance of the bending stiffness of the used\nfilament.\n", "  We propose to study novel quantum phases and excitations for a 2D spin-orbit\n(SO) coupled bosonic $p$-orbital optical lattice based on the recent\nexperiments. The orbital and spin degrees of freedom with SO coupling compete\nand bring about nontrivial interacting quantum effects. We develop a\nself-consistent method for bosons and predict a spin-orbital entangled order\nfor the ground phase, in sharp contrast to spinless high-orbital systems.\nFurthermore, we investigate the Bogoliubov excitations, showing that the Dirac\nand topological phonons are obtained corresponding to the predicted different\nspin-orbital orders. In particular, the topological phonons exhibit a bulk gap\nwhich can be several times larger than the single-particle gap of $p$-bands,\nreflecting the enhancement of topological effect by interaction. Our results\nhighlight the rich physics predicted in SO coupled high-orbital systems and\nshall attract experimental efforts in the future.\n", "  Difference imaging or image subtraction is a method that measures\ndifferential photometry by matching the pointing and point-spread function\n(PSF) between image frames. It is used for the detection of time-variable\nphenomena. Here we present a new category of method---CPM Difference Imaging,\nin which differences are not measured between matched images but instead\nbetween image frames and a data-driven predictive model that has been designed\nonly to predict the pointing, PSF, and detector effects but not astronomical\nvariability. In CPM Difference Imaging each pixel is modelled by the Causal\nPixel Model (CPM) originally built for modeling Kepler data, in which pixel\nvalues are predicted by a linear combination of other pixels at the same epoch\nbut far enough away such that these pixels are causally disconnected,\nastrophysically. It does not require that the user have any explicit model or\ndescription of the pointing or point-spread function of any of the images. Its\nprincipal drawback is that---in its current form---it requires an imaging\ncampaign with many epochs and fairly stable telescope pointing. The method is\napplied to simulated data and also the K2 Campaign 9 microlensing data. We show\nthat CPM Difference Imaging can detect variable objects and produce precise\ndifferentiate photometry in a crowded field. CPM Difference Imaging is capable\nof producing image differences at nearly photon-noise precision.\n", "  The nearby space surrounding the Earth is densely populated by artificial\nsatellites and instruments, whose orbits are distributed within the\nLow-Earth-Orbit region (LEO), ranging between 90 and 2 000 $km$ of altitude. As\na consequence of collisions and fragmentations, many space debris of different\nsizes are left in the LEO region. Given the threat raised by the possible\ndamages which a collision of debris can provoke with operational or manned\nsatellites, the study of their dynamics is nowadays mandatory. This work is\nfocused on the existence of equilibria and the dynamics of resonances in LEO.\nWe base our results on a simplified model which includes the geopotential and\nthe atmospheric drag. Using such model, we make a qualitative study of the\nresonances and the equilibrium positions, including their location and\nstability. The dissipative effect due to the atmosphere provokes a tidal decay,\nbut we give examples of different behaviors, precisely a straightforward\npassage through the resonance or rather a temporary capture. We also\ninvestigate the effect of the solar cycle which is responsible of fluctuations\nof the atmospheric density and we analyze the influence of Sun and Moon on LEO\nobjects.\n", "  Climatologists have calculated that a complete melting of the Greenland Ice\nSheet would cause global sea levels to rise by some 7.2 meters (23.6 feet).\nThis article investigates the possibility of physically removing this excess\nwater from the surface of the Earth by lifting the water into space. The\ntheoretical minimum amount of work for this task is calculated, and is found to\nbe equal to the amount of solar energy intercepted by the Earth in just 32\nyears.\n", "  Parametric coupling of lower hybrid pump wave with low frequency\ncollisionless/weakly collisional trapped electron drift wave, with frequency\nlower than the electron bounce frequency is studied. The coupling produces two\nlower hybrid sidebands. The sidebands beat with the pump to exert a low\nfrequency ponderomotive force on electrons that causes a frequency shift in the\ndrift wave, leading to the growth of the latter. The short wavelength modes are\ndestabilized and they enhance the anomalous diffusion coefficient.\n", "  Enhancements in WIMP annihilation rates have been identified with a\nnonperturbative \"Sommerfeld enhancement\" arising from the exchange of light\nmediators. At certain critical values of the WIMP mass, the enhancement is\nincreased dramatically due to a zero-energy resonance at the WIMP-pair\nthreshold. For masses near these critical values, WIMP scattering processes are\naccurately described by an effective field theory where WIMPs have\nnonperturbative zero-range contact interactions. The effective field theory is\ncontrolled by a renormalization-group fixed point at which the WIMPs are\ndegenerate in mass and their scattering length is infinite. If the WIMPs can\nexchange massless mediators, the resulting long-range interaction must also be\ntreated nonperturbatively. We develop an effective field theory for\nSU(2)-triplet dark matter, which have short-range weak and long-range\nelectromagnetic interactions. We refer to these dark matter particles as winos.\nThe long-range Coulomb interaction between charged winos is resummed to all\norders. The parameters of the effective field theory can be determined by\nmatching wino-wino scattering amplitudes calculated by solving the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation with a potential describing exchange of electroweak\ngauge bosons. With Coulomb resummation, the effective field theory at leading\norder gives a good description of the low-energy two-body observables for\nwinos.\n", "  We study boundary conditions of topological sigma models with the goal of\ngeneralizing the concepts of anomalous symmetry and symmetry protected\ntopological order. We find a version of 't Hooft's anomaly matching conditions\non the renormalization group flow of boundaries of invertible topological sigma\nmodels and discuss several examples of anomalous boundary theories. We also\ncomment on bulk topological transitions in dynamical sigma models and argue\nthat one can, with care, use topological data to draw sigma model phase\ndiagrams.\n", "  For half a century, the Roper resonance has defied understanding. Discovered\nin 1963, it appears to be an exact copy of the proton except that its mass is\n50% greater. The mass is the first problem: it is difficult to explain with any\ntheoretical tool that can validly be used to study quantum chromodynamics\n[QCD]. In the last decade, a new challenge has appeared, viz. precise\ninformation on the proton-to-Roper electroproduction transition form factors,\nreaching $Q^2\\approx 4.5\\,$GeV$^2$. This scale probes the domain within which\nhard valence-quark degrees-of-freedom could be expected to determine form\nfactor behavior. Hence, with this new data the Roper resonance becomes a\nproblem for strong-QCD [sQCD]. An explanation of how and where the Roper\nresonance fits into the emerging spectrum of hadrons cannot rest on a\ndescription of its mass alone. Instead, it must combine this with a detailed\nunderstanding of the Roper's structure and how that is revealed in the\ntransition form factors. Furthermore, it must unify all this with a similarly\ncomplete picture of the proton. This is a prodigious task, but a ten-year\ninternational effort, drawing together experimentalists and theorists, has\npresented a solution to the puzzle. Namely, the Roper is at heart the proton's\nfirst radial excitation, consisting of a dressed-quark core augmented by a\nmeson cloud that reduces the core mass by approximately 20% and materially\nalters its electroproduction form factors on $Q^2<2m_N^2$, where $m_N$ is the\nproton's mass. We describe the experimental motivations and developments which\nenabled electroproduction data to be procured within a domain that is\nunambiguously the purview of sQCD, thereby providing a real challenge and\nopportunity for modern theory; and survey the developments in reaction models\nand QCD theory that have enabled this conclusion to be drawn about the nature\nof the Roper resonance.\n", "  The interaction of (quasi)particles with a periodic potential arises in\nvarious domains of science and engineering, such as solid-state physics,\nchemical physics, and communication theory. An attractive test ground to\ninvestigate this interaction is represented by superconductors with artificial\npinning sites, where magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) interact with\nthe pinning potential $U(r) = U(r + R)$ induced by a nanostructure. At a\ncombination of microwave and dc currents, fluxons act as mobile probes of\n$U(r)$: The ac component shakes the fluxons in the vicinity of their\nequilibrium points which are unequivocally determined by the local pinning\nforce counterbalanced by the Lorentz force induced by the dc current, linked to\nthe curvature of $U(r)$ which can then be used for a successful fitting of the\nvoltage responses. A good correlation of the deduced dependences $U(r)$ with\nthe cross sections of the nanostructures points to that pinning is primarily\ncaused by vortex length reduction. Our findings pave a new route to a\nnon-destructive evaluation of periodic pinning in superconductor thin films.\nThe approach should also apply to a broad class of systems whose evolution in\ntime can be described by the coherent motion of (quasi)particles in a periodic\npotential.\n", "  In this paper we develop a mathematical model of the distribution of\nmicrowave electric field in heterogenous biological tissue of mammary gland. We\nuse this model to investigate the efficiency of the medical diagnostic method\nbased on microwave thermometry. Also we run a numerical modeling of\nelectromagnetic field in biotissue of mammary gland for various sets of the\nspatial structure of biotissue. The small-scale structure is caused by a\ncomplex combination of several components: blood flows, fat tissue, muscle\ntissue, milk lobules, skin. Next we vary in the model the spatial structure of\nthe tissue to evaluate the effect of the heterogeneous structure of the tissue\non the distribution of the electromagnetic field in the volume of mammary\ngland.\n", "  Is physics education research based on a representative sample of students?\nTo answer this question we skimmed physics education research papers from three\njournals for the years 1970 - 2015 looking for the number of research subjects,\nthe course the subjects were enrolled in, and the institution where the\nresearch was conducted. We then compared the demographics of our research\npopulation to those of all students taking physics in the United States. Our\nresults suggest that research subjects as a whole are better prepared\nmathematically and are less diverse than the overall physics student\npopulation.\n", "  NOvA (NuMI Off-axis {\\nu}e Appearance) experiment is designed to study\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillations using two detectors, the Near Detector (ND)\nat Fermilab and the Far Detector (FD) at a distance 810 km in Northern\nMinnesota. NOvA looks for the $\\nu_{e}$ appearance at the FD using a narrow\nband $\\nu_\\mu$ beam peaked at 2 GeV in energy. Neutral Current (NC)\ninteractions with a $\\pi^{0}$ in the final state represent the main background\nin the $\\nu_{e}$ appearance measurement. The $\\pi^{0}$ decay into two photons\ncan fake the $\\nu_{e}$ appearance signal in two ways either two photon showers\nmerge together or one of the two photons may escape the detection. Therefore, a\ncomplete understanding of $\\nu_{\\mu}$ induced NC interactions with $\\pi^{0}$ in\nthe final state is very important. It will also help in reducing the background\nuncertainties for current and future long-baseline neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. We present here the current status of the analysis related to the\ninclusive NC $\\pi^{0}$ production cross section measurement with the NOvA ND.\n", "  The Faraday effect, caused by a magnetic-field-induced change in the optical\nproperties, takes place in a vast variety of systems from a single atomic layer\nof graphenes to huge galaxies. Currently, it plays a pivot role in many\napplications such as the manipulation of light and the probing of magnetic\nfields and material's properties. Basically, this effect causes a polarization\nrotation of light during its propagation along the magnetic field in a medium.\nHere, we report an extreme case of the Faraday effect where a linearly\npolarized ultrashort laser pulse splits in time into two circularly polarized\npulses of opposite handedness during its propagation in a highly magnetized\nplasma. This offers a new degree of freedom for manipulating ultrashort and\nultrahigh power laser pulses. Together with technologies of ultra-strong\nmagnetic fields, it may pave the way for novel optical devices, such as\nmagnetized plasma polarizers. In addition, it may offer a powerful means to\nmeasure strong magnetic fields in laser-produced plasmas.\n", "  A cascaded ion acceleration scheme is proposed by use of ultrashort\nlaser-irradiated microtubes. When the electrons of a microtube are blown away\nby intense laser pulses, strong charge-separation electric fields are formed in\nthe microtube both along the axial and along the radial directions. By\ncontrolling the time delay between the laser pulses and a pre-accelerated\nproton beam injected along the microtube axis, we demonstrate that this proton\nbeam can be further accelerated by the transient axial electric field in the\nlaser-irradiated microtube. Moreover, the collimation of the injected proton\nbeam can be enhanced by the inward radial electric field. Numerical simulations\nshow that this cascaded ion acceleration scheme works efficiently even at\nnon-relativistic laser intensities, and it can be applied to injected proton\nbeams in the energy range from 1 to 100 MeV. Therefore, it is particularly\nsuitable for cascading acceleration of protons to higher energy.\n", "  Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum\nphenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity. In such a state,\nsuperfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with\nunique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual\nunderstanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear\nKlein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to\nspecial vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation,\nreconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with\ntheoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality\nsuperfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex\nvisualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a\nnew vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with\nvelocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane\nstrategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various\nsuperfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual\nanalysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex\nstring interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous\nKelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These\nvisualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and\nfurther explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.\n", "  The evolutionary pathways of core-collapse supernova progenitors at the\nlow-mass end of the spectrum are beset with major uncertainties. In recent\nyears, a variety of evolutionary channels has been discovered in addition to\nthe classical electron capture supernova channel of super-AGB stars. The few\navailable progenitor models at the low-mass end have been studied with great\nsuccess in supernova simulations as the peculiar density structure makes for\nrobust neutrino-driven explosions in this mass range. Detailed nucleosynthesis\ncalculations have been conducted both for models of electron capture supernovae\nand low-mass iron core supernovae and revealed an interesting production of the\nlighter trans-iron elements (such as Zn, Sr, Y, Zr) as well as rare isotopes\nlike Ca-48 and Fe-60. We stress the need to explore the low-mass end of the\nsupernova spectrum further and link various observables to understand the\ndiversity of explosions in this regime.\n", "  The optical spectroscopic and radio interferometric HI 21 cm-line\nobservations of the blue compact dwarf galaxy Mrk 22 are presented. The\nWolf-Rayet (WR) emission line features corresponding to high ionization lines\nof HeII $\\lambda$4686 and CIV $\\lambda$5808 from young massive stars are\ndetected. The ages of two prominent star forming regions in the galaxy are\nestimated as $\\sim$10 Myr and $\\sim$ 4 Myr. The galaxy has non-thermal radio\ndeficiency, which also indicates a young star-burst and lack of supernovae\nevents from the current star formation activities, consistent with the\ndetection of WR emission lines features. A significant N/O enrichment is seen\nin the fainter star forming region. The gas-phase metallicities [12 + log(O/H)]\nfor the bright and faint regions are estimated as 7.98$\\pm$0.07 and\n7.46$\\pm$0.09 respectively. The galaxy has a large diffuse HI envelop. The HI\nimages reveal disturbed gas kinematics and HI clouds outside the optical extent\nof the galaxy, indicating recent tidal interaction or merger in the system. The\nresults strongly indicate that Mrk 22 is undergoing a chemical and\nmorphological evolution due to ongoing star formation, most likely triggered by\na merger.\n", "  The characterization and understanding of online social network behavior is\nof importance from both the points of view of fundamental research and\nrealistic utilization. In this manuscript, we propose a stochastic differential\nequation to describe the online microblogging behavior. Our analysis is based\non the microblog data collected from Sina Weibo which is one of the most\npopular microblogging platforms in China. Especially, we focus on the\ncollective nature of the microblogging behavior reflecting itself in the\nanalyzed data as the characters of the periodic pattern, the stochastic\nfluctuation around the baseline, and the extraordinary jumps. Compared with\nexisting works, we use in our model time dependent parameters to facilitate the\nperiodic feature of the microblogging behavior and incorporate a compound\nPoisson process to describe the extraordinary spikes in the Sina Weibo volume.\nSuch distinct merits lead to significant improvement in the prediction\nperformance, thus justifying the validity of our model. This work may offer\npotential application in the future detection of the anomalous behavior in\nonline social network platforms.\n", "  In this paper we address a $n+1$-body gravitational problem governed by the\nNewton's laws, where $n$ primary bodies orbit on a plane $\\Pi$ and an\nadditional massless particle moves on the perpendicular line to $\\Pi$ passing\nthrough the center of mass of the primary bodies. We find a condition for that\nthe configuration described be possible. In the case that the primaries are in\na rigid motion we classify all the motions of the massless particle. We study\nthe situation when the massless particle has a periodic motion with the same\nminimal period than primary bodies. We show that this fact is related with the\nexistence of certain pyramidal central configuration.\n", "  Ultrasensitive detections have been proposed as an application of\noptomechanical systems. Here we develop an approach to mass sensing by\ncomparing the detected quadratures of light field coupled to a mechanical\nresonator, whose slight change of the mass should be precisely measured. The\nchange in the mass of the mechanical resonator will cause the detectable\ndifference in the evolved quadrature of the light field, to which the\nmechanical oscillator is coupled. It is shown that the ultra-small change\n$\\Delta m$ from a mass $m$ can be detected up to the ratio $\\Delta m/m\\sim\n10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ by choosing the feasible system parameters.\n", "  Since its discovery in 1938, superfluidity has been the subject of much\ninvestigation because it provides a unique example of a macroscopic\nmanifestation of quantum mechanics. About 60 years later, scientists\nsuccessfully observed this phenomenon in the microscopic world though the\nspectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in helium nano-droplets. This\nreduction of scale suggests that not only helium but also para-H2 (pH2) can be\na candidate for superfluidity. This expectation is based on the fact that the\nsmaller number of neighbours and surface effects of a finite-size cluster may\nhinder solidification and promote a liquid-like phase. The first prediction of\nsuperfluidity in pH2 clusters was reported in 1991 based on quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The possible superfluidity of pH2 was later indirectly observed in\na spectroscopic Andronikashvili experiment in 2000. Since then, a growing\nnumber of studies have appeared, and theoretical simulations have been playing\na special role because they help guide and interpret experiments. In this\nreview, we go over the theoretical studies of pH2 superfluid clusters since the\nexperiment of 2000. We provide a historical perspective and introduce the basic\ntheoretical formalism along with key experimental advances. We then present\nillustrative results of the theoretical studies and comment on the possible\nfuture developments in the field. We include sufficient theoretical details\nsuch that the review can serve as a guide for newcomers to the field.\n", "  Following the techniques of [4], we formulate a Normal Form Lemma suited to\nclose to be integrable Hamiltonian systems where not all the coordinates are\naction angles. The Lemma turns to be useful in the theory of KAM tori of\nSun-Earth-Asteroids systems.\n", "  The Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, a top-down gauge/gravity model of\nlarge-$N_c$ low-energy QCD based on type-IIA string theory and $N_c$ D4 branes\nwith chiral quarks added by probe D8 branes, involves only one dimensionless\nparameter, the 't Hooft coupling at its cutoff (Kaluza-Klein) scale. Although\nthis cutoff scale is around 1 GeV, the model has turned out to be surprisingly\npredictive also quantitatively, reproducing masses of vector and axial vector\nmesons, their decay rates, as well as the anomalous mass of the \\eta' meson,\nall within 10-30% errors. Using it as a guide for glueball signatures, we have\nargued that it indicates that the meson $f_0(1710)$ may be a nearly pure\nglueball, with rather specific predictions for the still-to-be-measured 4\\pi\nand \\eta\\eta' decays. Here we present our new predictions for the decay pattern\nof the (very narrow) pseudoscalar glueball, which is closely related to the\nU(1)$_A$ problem that the model is in fact handling correctly.\n", "  We explore the collision of two cylindrical bubbles in classical general\nrelativity with a scalar field stress-energy tensor. Inside each bubble the\nfield rests at a local minimum of the potential with non-negative energy\ndensity. Outside the field rests at zero potential, the global minimum. The\ncalculation resolves the connection from the inner de-Sitter region to the\nasymptotically flat Minkowski spacetime. We choose initial conditions such that\nthe two bubbles collide and study the full nonlinear evolution by means of a\ntwo-dimensional numerical simulation of Einstein's equations. The collision\ngenerates a strongly interacting region with spatially varying fields and\npotentials. These circumstances promote dynamical exploration of the\npotential's landscape. No horizon is present and the scalar curvature\ninvariants eventually diverge. We speculate that Schwarzschild-like horizons\nwill encompass only part of the complicated, interesting regions of spacetime\nin the analogous case of colliding spherical bubbles.\n", "  Conventional Josephson metal-insulator-metal devices are inherently\nunderdamped and exhibit hysteretic current-voltage response due to a very high\nsubgap resistance compared to that in the normal state. At the same time,\noverdamped junctions with single-valued characteristics are needed for most\nsuperconducting digital applications. The usual way to overcome the hysteretic\nbehavior is to place an external low-resistance normal-metal shunt in parallel\nwith each junction. Unfortunately, such solution results in a considerable\ncomplication of the circuitry design and introduces parasitic inductance\nthrough the junction. This paper provides a concise overview of some generic\napproaches that have been proposed in order to realize internal shunting in\nJosephson heterostructures with a barrier that itself contains the desired\nresistive component. The main attention is paid to self-shunted devices with\nlocal weak-link transmission probabilities so strongly disordered in the\ninterface plane that transmission probabilities are tiny for the main part of\nthe transition region between two superconducting electrodes, while a small\npart of the interface is well transparent. We consider the possibility of\nrealizing a universal bimodal distribution function and emphasize advantages of\nsuch junctions that can be considered as a new class of self-shunted Josephson\ndevices promising for practical applications in superconducting electronics\noperating at 4.2 K.\n", "  We present our recent results for long-distance QCD effects in the FCNC\nradiative leptonic decays $B\\to\\gamma\\ell^+\\ell^-$, $\\ell=\\{e,\\mu\\}$. One\nencounters here two distinct types of long-distance effects: those encoded in\nthe $B\\to\\gamma$ transition form factors induced by the $b\\to q$ quark\ncurrents, and those related to the charm-loop effects. We calculate the\n$B\\to\\gamma$ form factors in a broad range of the momentum transfers making use\nof the relativisitc dispersion approach based on the constituent quark picture\nwhich has proven to provide reliable predictions for many weak-transition form\nfactors. Concerning the description of the charm-loop contributions, we point\nout two observations: First, the precise description of the charmonium\nresonances, in particular, the relative phases between $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$, has\nimpact on the differential distributions and on the forward-backward asymmetry,\n$A_{\\rm FB}$, in a broad range of $q^2\\ge 5$ GeV$^2$. Second, the shape of\n$A_{\\rm FB}$ in $B\\to\\gamma\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and in $B\\to V\\ell^+\\ell^-$ ($V$ the\nvector meson) {\\it in the $q^2$-region between $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$} provides an\nunambiguous probe of the relative phases between $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. Fixing the\nlatter will lead to a strong reduction of the theoretical uncertainties in\n$A_{\\rm FB}$ at $q^2=5-9$ GeV$^2$ where it has the sensitivity to physics\nbeyond the SM.\n", "  We apply Starobinsky's formalism of stochastic inflation to the case of a\nminimally coupled scalar field with linear self-interaction potential. We solve\nthe corresponding Fokker-Planck equation exactly, and obtain analytical\nexpressions for the stochastic expectation values.\n", "  In Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), the most prevalent beamforming algorithm is\ndelay-and-sum (DAS) due to its simple implementation. However, it results in a\nlow quality image affected by the high level of sidelobes. Coherence factor\n(CF) can be used to address the sidelobes in the reconstructed images by DAS,\nbut the resolution improvement is not good enough compared to the high\nresolution beamformers such as minimum variance (MV). As a weighting algorithm\nin linear-array PAI, it was proposed to use high-resolution-CF (HRCF) weighting\ntechnique in which MV is used instead of the existing DAS in the formula of the\nconventional CF. The higher performance of HRCF was proved numerically and\nexperimentally. The quantitative results obtained with the simulations show\nthat at the depth of 40 mm, in comparison with DAS+CF and MV+CF, HRCF improves\nthe full-width-half-maximum of about 91 % and 15 % and the signal-to-noise\nratio about 40 % and 14 %, respectively. Moreover, the contrast ratio at the\ndepth of 20 mm has been improved about 62 % and 21 % by HRCF, compared to\nDAS+CF and MV+CF, respectively\n", "  We present a new clustering algorithm that is based on searching for natural\ngaps in the components of the lowest energy eigenvectors of the Laplacian of a\ngraph. In comparing the performance of the proposed method with a set of other\npopular methods (KMEANS, spectral-KMEANS, and an agglomerative method) in the\ncontext of the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) Benchmark for undirected\nweighted overlapping networks, we find that the new method outperforms the\nother spectral methods considered in certain parameter regimes. Finally, in an\napplication to climate data involving one of the most important modes of\ninterannual climate variability, the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon,\nwe demonstrate the ability of the new algorithm to readily identify different\nflavors of the phenomenon.\n", "  Recent literature suggests that there are two modes through which galaxies\ngrow their stellar mass - a normal mode characterized by quasi-steady star\nformation, and a highly efficient starburst mode possibly triggered by\nstochastic events such as galaxy mergers. While these differences are\nestablished for extreme cases, the population of galaxies in-between these two\nregimes is poorly studied and it is not clear where the transition between\nthese two modes of star formation occurs. We utilize ALMA observations of the\nCO J=3-2 line luminosity in a sample of 20 infrared luminous galaxies that lie\nin the intermediate range between normal and starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.25-0.6\nin the COSMOS field to examine the gas content and star formation efficiency of\nthese galaxies. We compare these quantities to the galaxies' deviation from the\nwell-studied \"main sequence\" correlation between star formation rate and\nstellar mass (MS) and find that at log($SFR/SFR_{MS}$) < 0.6, a galaxy's\ndistance to the main sequence is mostly driven by increased gas content, and\nnot a more efficient star formation process.\n", "  A Schur decomposition of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT) for homogeneous,\nisotropic turbulence (HIT) is undertaken and its physical consequences\nexamined. This decomposition permits the normal parts of the tensor\n(represented by the eigenvalues) to be separated explicitly from the non-normal\neffects. Given the restricted {E}uler approximation to the VGT dynamics is\nwritten in terms of the isotropic part of the pressure Hessian and the\ninvariants of the characteristic equation of the VGT (in turn expressed in\nterms of the eigenvalues), the non-normal terms are related to the non-local\naspects of the dynamics and the anisotropic part of the pressure Hessian. Using\na direct numerical simulation of HIT, we show that the norm of the non-normal\npart of the tensor is of a similar order to the normal part, highlighting the\nimportance of non-local effects. In fact, beneath the discriminant function in\na Q-R plot, all enstrophy arises from the non-normal term, meaning that\nvorticity and intermediate strain eigenvector alignment in this region is an\nimmediate consequence of non-normality. A non-normal term appears in the\nexpressions for both enstrophy and total strain and cancels when calculating\nthe second invariant of the VGT, while the self-amplification of non-normality\nand the normal straining of non-normality appear in the strain production and\nenstrophy production equations and cancel when calculating the third invariant.\nHowever, these terms are significant for understanding the full VGT dynamics,\nexplaining how flow structures evolve to a disc-like state despite the strain\neigenvalues sometimes indicating opposite (rod-like) behaviour, as well as\nexplaining vorticity and strain alignments in HIT.\n", "  Topological superfluids are of technological relevance since they are\nbelieved to host Majorana bound states, a powerful resource for quantum\ncomputation and memory. Here we propose to realize topological superfluidity\nwith fermionic atoms in an optical lattice. We consider a situation where atoms\nin two internal states experience different lattice potentials: one species is\nlocalized and the other itinerant, and show how quantum fluctuations of the\nlocalized fermions give rise to an attraction and strong spin-orbit coupling in\nthe itinerant band. At low temperature, these effects stabilize a topological\nsuperfluid of mobile atoms even if their bare interactions are repulsive. This\nemergent state can be engineered with ${}^{87}$Sr atoms in a superlattice with\na dimerized unit cell. To probe its unique properties we describe protocols\nthat use high spectral resolution and controllability of the Sr clock\ntransition, such as momentum-resolved spectroscopy and supercurrent response to\na synthetic (laser-induced) magnetic field.\n", "  The functional properties of devices based on perovskite oxides depend\nstrongly on the growth modes that dramatically affect surface morphology and\nmicrostructure of the hetero-structured thin films. To achieve atomically flat\nsurface morphology, which is usually a necessity for the high quality devices,\nunderstanding of the growth mechanism of heteroepitaxial thin film is\nindispensable. In this study, we explore heteroepitaxial growth kinetics of the\nSrRuO3 using intermittent growth scheme of pulsed laser epitaxy and ex-situ\natomic force microscopy. Two significant variations in surface roughness during\ndeposition of the first unit cell layer were observed from atomic force\nmicroscopy indicating the possible formation of the half unit cell of the\nSrRuO3 before the complete formation of the first unit cell. In addition,\nlayer-by-layer growth mode dominated during the first two unit cell layer\ndeposition of the SrRuO3 thin film. Our observation provides underlying growth\nmechanism of the heteroepitaxial SrRuO3 thin film on the SrTiO3 substrate\nduring the initial growth of the thin film.\n", "  Quantum gravity has become a fertile interface between gravitational physics\nand quantum many-body physics, with its double goal of identifying the\nmicroscopic constituents of the universe and their fundamental dynamics, and of\nunderstanding their collective properties and how spacetime and geometry\nthemselves emerge from them at macroscopic scales. In this brief contribution,\nwe outline the problem of quantum gravity from this emergent spacetime\nperspective, and discuss some examples in which ideas and methods from quantum\nmany-body systems have found a central role in quantum gravity research.\n", "  The instability of transverse wobbling claim is disputed.\n", "  We propose to use metasurfaces as a mean of controlling radiation pressure\nfor increasing the range of motions of spacecraft solar sails. Specifically, we\npresent a theoretical study of different electromagnetic field configurations,\nand corresponding metasurface structures, that allow one to achieve repulsive,\nattractive, lateral and rotational forces.\n", "  The medium modified hadron properties are studied by using the scale-chiral\nperturbation theory $\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$ in which the lightest scalar meson\n$f_0(500)$ is included as an explicit degree of freedom by regarding it as the\nNambu-Goldstone boson of scale symmetry both spontaneously broken and\nexplicitly broken by the QCD trace anomaly. We derive Brown-Rho scaling at the\nleading order of scale symmetry from $\\chi$PT$_\\sigma$ and formulate how to\nmake higher-order scale-chiral corrections going beyond the leading order of\nscale symmetry. By taking into account the intrinsic density dependence given\nby the dilaton condensate in the \"bare\" parameters of the Lagrangian, the\nmedium modified hadron properties are investigated. Relying on available\nexperimental information and certain reasonable assumptions, we arrive at the\nleading order scale symmetric effective theory that can be confronted with\nnature .\n", "  Apart from not having crystallized, supercooled liquids can be considered as\nbeing properly equilibrated and thus can be described by a few thermodynamic\ncontrol variables. In contrast, glasses and other amorphous solids can be\narbitrarily far away from equilibrium and require a description of the history\nof the conditions under which they formed. In this paper we describe how the\nlocality of interactions intrinsic to finite-dimensional systems affects the\nstability of amorphous solids far off equilibrium. Our analysis encompasses\nboth structural glasses formed by cooling and colloidal assemblies formed by\ncompression. A diagram outlining regions of marginal stability can be adduced\nwhich bears some resemblance to the quasi-equilibrium replica meanfield theory\nphase diagram of hard sphere glasses in high dimensions but is distinct from\nthat construct in that the diagram describes not true phase transitions but\nkinetic transitions that depend on the preparation protocol. The diagram\nexhibits two distinct sectors. One sector corresponds to amorphous states with\nrelatively open structures, the other to high density, more closely-packed\nones. The former transform rapidly owing to there being motions with no free\nenergy barriers; these motions are string-like locally. In the dense region,\namorphous systems age via compact activated reconfigurations. The two regimes\ncorrespond, in equilibrium, to the collisional or uniform liquid and the so\ncalled landscape regime, respectively. These are separated by a spinodal line\nof dynamical crossovers. Owing to the rigidity of the surrounding matrix in the\nlandscape, high-density part of the diagram, a sufficiently rapid pressure\nquench adds compressive energy which also leads to an instability toward\nstring-like motions with near vanishing barriers. (SEE REST OF ABSTRACT IN THE\nARTICLE.)\n", "  The theory of homogeneously driven granular gases of hard particles predicts\nthat the stationary state is characterized by a velocity distribution function\nwith overpopulated high-energy tails as compared to the exponential decay valid\nfor molecular gases. While this fundamental theoretical result was confirmed by\nnumerous numerical simulations, an experimental confirmation is still missing.\nUsing self-rotating active granular particles, we find a power-law decay of the\nvelocity distribution whose exponent agrees well with the theoretic prediction.\n", "  Accurate knowledge of the nuclear level density is important both from a\ntheoretical viewpoint as a powerful instrument for studying nuclear structure\nand for numerous applications. For example, astrophysical reactions responsible\nfor the nucleosynthesis in the universe can be understood only if we know the\nnuclear level density. We use the configuration-interaction nuclear shell model\nto predict nuclear level density for all nuclei in the $sd$-shell, both total\nand for individual spins (only with positive parity). To avoid the\ndiagonalization in large model spaces we use the moments method based on\nstatistical properties of nuclear many-body systems. In the cases where the\ndiagonalization is possible, the results of the moments method practically\ncoincide with those from the shell-model calculations. Using the computed level\ndensities, we fit the parameters of the Constant Temperature phenomenological\nmodel, which can be used by practitioners in their studies of nuclear reactions\nat excitation energies appropriate for the $sd$-shell nuclei.\n", "  KASCADE and KASCADE-Grande were multi-detector installations to measure\nindividual air showers of cosmic rays at ultra-high energy. Based on data sets\nmeasured by KASCADE and KASCADE-Grande, 90% C.L. upper limits to the flux of\ngamma-rays in the primary cosmic ray flux are determined in an energy range of\n${10}^{14} - {10}^{18}$ eV. The analysis is performed by selecting air showers\nwith a low muon content as expected for gamma-ray-induced showers compared to\nair showers induced by energetic nuclei. The best upper limit of the fraction\nof gamma-rays to the total cosmic ray flux is obtained at $3.7 \\times\n{10}^{15}$ eV with $1.1 \\times {10}^{-5}$. Translated to an absolute gamma-ray\nflux this sets constraints on some fundamental astrophysical models, such as\nthe distance of sources for at least one of the IceCube neutrino excess models.\n", "  The inability to efficiently tune the optical properties of waveguiding\nstructures has been one of the major hurdles for the future scalability of\nintegrated photonic systems. In silicon photonics, although dynamic tuning has\nbeen achieved with various mechanisms, even the most effective thermo-optic\neffect offers a refractive index change of only $1.86 \\times 10^{-4} K^{-1}$.\nTo enhance this small change, light recycling based on resonators has been\nemployed in order to realize efficient modulators, phase shifters, and optical\nswitches. However, the resonant enhancement comes at a great cost of optical\nbandwidth, fabrication tolerance and system scalability. Here we demonstrate a\nscalable light recycling approach based on spatial-mode multiplexing. Our\napproach offers a fabrication tolerance of ${\\pm}$ 15 nm, in stark contrast to\nthe non-scalable subnanometer tolerance in typical silicon resonators. We\nexperimentally demonstrate light recycling up to 7 passes with an optical\nbandwidth greater than 100 nm. We realize power-efficient thermo-optic phase\nshifters that require only 1.7 mW per ${\\pi}$, representing more than an 8-fold\nreduction in the power consumption.\n", "  We report on new results on $B \\to K^* \\gamma$ and recent studies on $B \\to\nK^* \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ and $B \\to h \\nu \\bar{\\nu}$ at Belle at KEKB accelerator.\nAll the analyses used full data sample of 711~fb${}^{-1}$ taken on\n$\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance.\n", "  We present in this work an analysis of the damage imposed by the atom on the\nfield state inside a lossy superconducting cavity. To access such effects, we\npropose two procedures to preserve a qubit of the decay effects of an imperfect\nquantum memory: the first by means of an quasi-instantaneous phase kick applied\nin the atom, and the second by means of controlled resonant and dispersive\ninteractions. We immediately demonstrate that, in both procedures, the dwell\ntime of the qubit in the cavity increases significantly, being expressively\nhigher for the second. A relation between the inaccuracy of the preparation of\nthe atomic beam and the quality of the cavity arises naturally from our\ncalculations for each procedure. This result is unprecedented, and sets out the\nrules to increase the dwell time of the qubit.\n", "  We use phase-shifting digital holography to measure the amplitude and phase\nof twisted light. In our experiment, a spatial light modulator generates the\nstudied vortex beams in addition to a co-propagating reference beam with a\ncontrollable relative phase. We show complex field measurements for single and\nsuperposition Laguerre Gaussian (LG) modes, demonstrate full modal\ndecompositions into LG and orbital angular momentum (OAM) power spectral bases,\nprovide error analysis and demonstrate high insensitivity to detector\nmisalignment to show the robustness of the technique. This enables rapid\ndetermination of OAM spectra with low uncertainty, allowing us to report the\nfirst vortex beams with 99.9% purity.\n", "  The finite-size scaling theory for continuous phase transition plays an\nimportant role in determining critical point and critical exponents from the\nsize-dependent behaviors of quantities in the thermodynamic limit. For\npercolation phase transition, the finite-size scaling form for the reduced size\nof largest cluster has been extended to cluster ranked $R$. However, this is\ninvalid for explosive percolation as our results show. Besides, the behaviors\nof largest increase of largest cluster induced by adding single link or node\nhave also been used to investigate the critical properties of percolation and\nseveral new exponents $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$, $1/\\nu_1$ and $1/\\nu_2$ are defined\nwhile their relation with $\\beta/\\nu$ and $1/\\nu$ is unknown. Through the\nanalysis of asymptotic properties of size jump behaviors, we obtain correct\ncritical exponents and develop a new approach to finite size scaling theory\nwhere sizes of ranked clusters are averaged at same distances from the\nsample-dependent pseudo-critical point in each realization rather than\naveraging at same value of control parameter.\n", "  The $k$-core percolation is a fundamental structural transition in complex\nnetworks. Through the analysis of the size jump behaviors of $k$-core in the\nevolution process of networks, we confirm that $k$-core percolation is\ncontinuous phase transition when $k=1,2$ while it is a hybrid\nfirst-order-second-order phase transition when $k\\ge 3$. $2$-core percolation\nbelongs to different universality class from that of $1$-core (giant component)\npercolation. The discontinuity of $k$-core percolation with $k\\ge 3$ can be\nconcluded from largest size jump of $k$-core which will not disappear in the\nthermodynamic limit while its continuous characteristic is reflected by second\nlargest size jump which converges to zero in power law as $N\\to \\infty$.\nFurthermore, along with the previously known exponent $\\beta=0.5$, we obtain a\nset of exponents which are independent of $k$ when $k\\ge 3$ and also different\nfrom those critical exponents of $1$-core and $2$-core percolation.\n", "  A approach of finite size scaling theory for discontinous percolation with\nmultiple giant clusters is developed in this paper. The percolation in\ngeneralized Bohman-Frieze-Wormald (BFW) model has already been proved to be\ndiscontinuous phase transition. In the evolution process, the size of largest\ncluster $s_1$ increases in a stairscase way and its fluctuation shows a series\nof peaks corresponding to the jumps of $s_1$ from one stair to another. Several\nlargest jumps of the size of largest cluster from single edge are studied by\nextensive Monte Carlo simulation. $\\overline{\\Delta}_k(N)$ which is the mean of\nthe $k$th largest jump of largest cluster, $\\overline{r}_k(N)$ which is the\ncorresponding averaged edge density, $\\sigma_{\\Delta,k}(N)$ which is the\nstandard deviation of $\\Delta_k$ and $\\sigma_{r,k}(N)$ which is the standard\ndeviation of $r_k$ are analyzed. Rich power law behaviours are found for\n$\\overline{r}_k(N)$, $\\sigma_{\\Delta,k}(N)$ and $\\sigma_{r,k}(N)$ with critical\nexponents denoted as $1/\\nu_1$, $(\\beta/\\nu)_2$ and $1/\\nu_2$. Unlike\ncontinuous percolation where the exact critical thresholds and critical\nexponent $1/\\nu_1$ are used for finite size scaling, the size-dependent pseudo\ncritical thresholds $\\overline{r}_k(N)$ and $1/\\nu_2$ works for the data\ncollapse of the curves of largest cluster and its fluctuation in discontinuous\npercolation in BFW model. Further, data collapse can be obtained part by part.\nThat is, $s_1(r,N)$ can be collapsed for each jump from one stair to another\nand its fluctuation can be collapsed around each peak with the corresponding\n$\\overline{r}_k(N)$ and $1/\\nu_2$.\n", "  Hadronic $B$ decays without a charm quark constitute a powerful probe to\nsearch for physics beyond the standard model as well as to provide constraints\non $CP$ violation parameters. We report final measurements from Belle of the\nbranching fractions and $CP$ asymmetries for the decays $B^{0} \\rightarrow\n\\pi^{0} \\pi^{0}$ and $B^{\\pm} \\rightarrow K^{+} K^{-} \\pi^{\\pm}$. The $B^{0}\n\\rightarrow \\pi^{0} \\pi^{0}$ measurements enable us to improve constraints on\nthe angle $\\phi_{2}$ of the CKM unitarity triangle. For $B^{\\pm} \\rightarrow\nK^{+} K^{-} \\pi^{\\pm}$ we measure $CP$ asymmetry as a function of the invariant\nmass of the $K^{+}K^{-}$ system, where we find a strong evidence for large $CP$\nviolation and a large increase in yield at low mass region. This result\nchallenges conventional theoretical approaches as it requires a large\nenhancement in both tree and loop level diagrams in the same small region of\nphase-space.\n", "  Carbon nanotubes (CTNs) with large aspect-ratios are extensively used to\nestablish electrical connectedness in polymer melts at very low CNT loadings.\nHowever, the CNT size polydispersity and the quality of the dispersion are\nstill not fully understood factors that can substantially alter the desired\ncharacteristics of CNT nanocomposites. Here we demonstrate that the electrical\nconductivity of polydisperse CNT-epoxy composites with purposely-tailored\ndistributions of the nanotube length L is a quasiuniversal function of the\nfirst moment of L. This finding challenges the current understanding that the\nconductivity depends upon higher moments of the CNT length. We explain the\nobserved quasiuniversality by a combined effect between the particle size\npolydispersity and clustering. This mechanism can be exploited to achieve\ncontrolled tuning of the electrical transport in general CNT nanocomposites.\n", "  Advanced LIGO detected a significant gravitational wave signal (GW170104)\noriginating from the coalescence of two black holes during the second\nobservation run on January 4$^{\\textrm{th}}$, 2017. An all-sky high-energy\nneutrino follow-up search has been made using data from the ANTARES neutrino\ntelescope, including both upgoing and downgoing events in two separate\nanalyses. No neutrino candidates were found within $\\pm500$ s around the GW\nevent time nor any time clustering of events over an extended time window of\n$\\pm3$ months. The non-detection is used to constrain isotropic-equivalent\nhigh-energy neutrino emission from GW170104 to less than $\\sim4\\times 10^{54}$\nerg for a $E^{-2}$ spectrum.\n", "  Edge plasma density fluctuations are shown to have a significant effect on\nthe electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) beam in the DIII-D tokamak.\nExperimental measurements of the ECRH deposition profile have been taken in\nthree operating scenarios: L-mode, H-mode and negative triangularity. Each\nscenario corresponds to distinct turbulence characteristics in the edge region\nthrough which the beam must propagate. The measured ECRH deposition profile is\nsignificantly broadened by comparison to the profile predicted by the ray\ntracing code TORAY-GA and has been shown to scale with the severity of edge\nturbulence. Conventional ray tracing does not include the effects of turbulence\nand therefore a 3D full-wave cold plasma finite difference time domain code\nEMIT-3D is presented and used for the simulations. The turbulence is generated\nthrough the Hermes model in the BOUT++ framework which takes as input the\nmeasured time averaged electron density, temperature and magnetic field\nprofiles for the specific shot in question. The simulated turbulence is\nconstrained to match the experimentally measured (by use of the BES and DBS\nsystems) correlation length and normalised fluctuation levels. The predictions\nof the beam broadening from the simulations are found to agree very well with\nthe experimentally-observed broadening in all cases: L-mode, H-mode and\nnegative triangularity. Due to the large gradients within the H-mode edge, the\nresolution uncertainty and error in the measurement from Thomson scattering and\nBES diagnostics result in a spread in the simulated turbulence amplitude. In\nlight of this a parameter scan through the range in experimental diagnostic\nmeasurement uncertainty has been conducted to explore the impact on beam\nbroadening predictions.\n", "  A family of compressible exact periodic solutions is reported for the first\ntime in an open cavity flow setup. These are found using a novel framework\nwhich permits the computation of such solutions in an arbitrary complex\ngeometry. The periodic orbits arise from a synchronised concatenation of\nconvective and acoustic events which strongly depend on the Mach number. This\nflow-acoustic interaction furnishes the periodic solutions with a remarkable\nstability and it is found to completely dominate the system's dynamics and the\nsound directivity. The periodic orbits, which could be called `exact Rossiter\nmodes', collapse with a family of equilibrium solutions at a subcritical Hopf\nbifurcation, occurring in the quasi-incompressible regime. This shows\ncompressibility has a destabilising effect in cavity flows, which we analyse in\ndetail. By establishing a connection with previous 2D and 3D stability studies\nof cavity flows, we are able to isolate the effect of purely compressible\ntwo-dimensional flow phenomena across Mach number. A linear stability analysis\nof the equilibria provides insight into the compressible flow mechanisms\nresponsible for the instability. A close look at the adjoint modes suggests\nthat an eigenvalue merge occurs at a Mach number between 0.35 and 0.4, which\nboosts the receptivity of the leading mode and determines the onset of the\nunstable character of the system. The effect of the choice of base flow over\nthe transition dynamics is also discussed, where in the present case, the\nfrequencies associated to the leading eigenmodes show a strong connection with\nthe frequencies of the periodic orbits at the same Mach numbers.\n", "  As radio polarised emission from astrophysical objects traverse through\nforeground magnetised plasma, the physical conditions along the lines of sight\nare encrypted in the form of Rotation Measure (RM). We performed broadband\nspectro-polarimetric observations of high Rotation Measure (|RM| >~ 300 rad\nm-2) sources away from the Galactic plane (|b| > 10 deg) selected from the NVSS\nRM catalogue. The main goals are to verify the NVSS RM values, which could be\nsusceptible to n{\\pi}-ambiguity, as well as to identify the origin of the\nextreme RM values. We show that 40 % of our sample suffer from n{\\pi}-ambiguity\nin the NVSS RM catalogue. There are also hints of RM variabilities over ~20\nyears epoch for most of our sources, as revealed by comparing the RM values of\nthe two studies in the same frequency ranges after correcting for\nn{\\pi}-ambiguity. At last, we demonstrate the possibility of applying\nQU-fitting to study the ambient media of AGNs.\n", "  Efficient coupling of single quantum emitters to guided optical modes of\nintegrated optical devices is of high importance for applications in quantum\ninformation science as well as in the field of sensing. Here we present the\ndesign and fabrication of a platform for on-chip experiments based on\ndielectric optical single-mode waveguides(Ta2O5 on SiO2). The design of the\nwaveguide is optimized for broadband (600-800 nm) evanescent coupling to a\nsingle quantum emitter (expected efficiency: up to 36%) and efficient off-chip\ncoupling to single-mode optical fibers using inverted tapers. First test\nsamples exhibit propagation losses below 1.8 dB/mm and off-chip coupling\nefficiencies exceeding 57%. These results are promising for efficient coupling\nof solid state quantum emitters like NV- and SiV-centers to a single optical\nmode of a nanoscale waveguide.\n", "  We investigate Casimir effect as well as thermal Casimir effect for a pair of\nparallel perfectly plates placed in general stationary space-time background.\nIt is found that the Casimir energy is influenced by the 00-component of metric\nand the corresponding quantity in dragging frame. We give a scheme to\nrenormalize thermal correction to free energy in curved space-time. It is shown\nthat the thermal corrections to Casimir thermodynamic quantities not only\ndepend on the proper temperature and proper geometrical parameters of the\nplates, but also on the determinant of space-time metric.\n", "  We investigate the thermal Casimir effect of a massless scalar field for two\nparallel plates moving in the equatorial orbit in Kerr space-time. Under the\nassumption that the typical cavity size is much smaller than the orbital\nradius, proposed by Sorge, we deduce the analytical expression of the\nrenormalized free energy in this curved space-time. We also get the analytical\nrepresentation for the renormalized internal energy, and find that there is a\nthermal correction to the Casimir energy, which depends on the proper\ntemperature and the proper geometrical parameters of the plates. The asymptotic\nbehavior of the Casimir free energy, entropy and internal energy at low\ntemperature is also investigated.\n", "  We investigate the nonlinear stability of the superposition of a viscous\ncontact wave and two rarefaction waves for one-dimensional bipolar\nVlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann (VPB) system, which can be used to describe the\ntransportation of charged particles under the additional electrostatic\npotential force. Based on a new micro-macro type decomposition around the local\nMaxwellian related to the bipolar VPB system in our previous work [26], we\nprove that the superposition of a viscous contact wave and two rarefaction\nwaves is time-asymptotically stable to 1D bipolar VPB system under some\nsmallness conditions on the initial perturbations and wave strength, which\nimplies that this typical composite wave pattern is nonlinearly stable under\nthe combined effects of the binary collisions, the electrostatic potential\nforce, and the mutual interactions of different charged particles. Note that\nthis is the first result about the nonlinear stability of the combination of\ntwo different wave patterns for the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system.\n", "  The Event Horizon Telescope, an Earth-sized interferometer, aims to capture\nan image of a black hole's event horizon to test the theory of general\nrelativity and probe accretion processes.\n", "  In this paper, the growth-induced bending deformation of a thin hyperelastic\nplate is studied. For a plane-strain problem, the governing PDE system is\nformulated, which is composed of the mechanical equilibrium equations, the\nconstraint equation and the boundary conditions. By adopting a gradient growth\nfield with the growth value changes linearly along the thickness direction, the\nexact solution to the governing PDE system can be derived. With the obtained\nsolution, some important features of the bending deformation in the plate can\nbe found and the effects of the different growth parameters can be revealed.\nThis exact solution can serve as a benchmark one for testing the correctness of\nnumerical schemes and approximate plate models in growth theory.\n", "  In this work we consider CMB spectral distortions as a probe of dark matter\nmicrophysics in the early universe. We demonstrate that future experiments such\nas PRISM have the potential to distinguish between scenarios which offer\nsolutions to the small-scale problems of CDM cosmology.\n", "  We study four-body central configurations with one pair of opposite sides\nparallel. We use a novel constraint to write the central configuration\nequations in this special case, using distances as variables. We prove that,\nfor a given ordering of the mutual distances, a trapezoidal central\nconfiguration must have a certain partial ordering of the masses. We also show\nthat if opposite masses of a four-body trapezoidal central configuration are\nequal, then the configuration has a line of symmetry and it must be a kite. In\ncontrast to the general four-body case, we show that if the two adjacent masses\nbounding the shortest side are equal, then the configuration must be an\nisosceles trapezoid, and the remaining two masses must also be equal.\n", "  We describe the main scientific developments that lead LIGO project to the\ndetection of the gravitational waves: general relativity, black holes and\ngravitational waves predictions; numerical relativity and the collision and\ncoalescence simulations of binary black holes and the development of different\nkind of gravitational wave detectors. Most important, this detection is\nconfirming the existence of the enigmatic black holes.\n", "  The design and performance of liquid metal batteries, a new technology for\ngrid-scale energy storage, depend on fluid mechanics because the battery\nelectrodes and electrolytes are entirely liquid. Here we review prior and\ncurrent research on the fluid mechanics of liquid metal batteries, pointing out\nopportunities for future studies. Because the technology in its present form is\njust a few years old, only a small number of publications have so far\nconsidered liquid metal batteries specifically. We hope to encourage\ncollaboration and conversation by referencing as many of those publications as\npossible here. Much can also be learned by linking to extensive prior\nliterature considering phenomena observed or expected in liquid metal\nbatteries, including thermal convection, magnetoconvection, Marangoni flow,\ninterface instabilities, the Tayler instability, and electro-vortex flow. We\nfocus on phenomena, materials, length scales, and current densities relevant to\nthe liquid metal battery designs currently being commercialized. We try to\npoint out breakthroughs that could lead to design improvements or make new\nmechanisms important.\n", "  Light polarization can conveniently encode information. Yet, the ability to\nsteer polarized optical fields is notably demanding but crucial to develop\npractical methods for data encryption and to gather fundamental insights into\nlight-matter interactions. Here we demonstrate the dynamic manipulation of the\nchirality of light in the telecom wavelength regime. This unique possibility is\nenrooted in the multivalley nature of the conduction band of a conventional\nsemiconductor, namely Ge. In particular, we demonstrate that optical pumping\nsuffices to govern the kinetics of spin-polarized carriers and eventually the\nchirality of the radiative recombination. We found that the polarization of the\noptical transitions can be remarkably swept through orthogonal eigenstates\nwithout magnetic field control or phase shifter coupling. Our results\nanticipate spin-enhanced optoelectronic functionalities in materials backed by\nthe mainstream microelectronics industry and provide guiding information for\nthe selection and design of functionalized emitters based on novel group IV\ncompounds.\n", "  We use a simple model of particle shape to investigate how particle asymmetry\naffects particle-surface interaction, orientation, and stochastic dynamics over\na planar surface. With this geometric model, we construct potential energy\ncurves as a function of particle orientation relative to the surface, and\nidentify the potential energy minimum for particles of various shapes ranging\nfrom symmetric (sphere) to asymmetric (oval-shaped). The calculated difference\nbetween particle centroid position and potential energy minimum location is\nused to define an offset, which is useful for comparison with experimental\nparticle trajectories. For asymmetric particles the potential energy minimum\nlocation is decoupled from the center of the particle long-axis. Based on these\nobservations, we construct a Brownian motion model of a rigid rotor with one\nend fixed to the planar surface. In the case of asymmetric particles, the\nresulting stochastic trajectories exhibit passive circular Brownian motion,\nthus providing one possible microscopic mechanism for the stochastic dynamics\nof fluorescence upconversion nanoparticles near a surface previously reported\nby us.\n", "  Circuit quantum electrodynamics ('circuit QED') describes the quantum\nmechanics and quantum field theory of superconducting electrical circuits\noperating in the microwave regime near absolute zero temperature. It is the\nanalog of cavity QED in quantum optics with the role of the atoms being played\nby superconducting qubits. The present lecture notes focus primarily on novel\nquantum states that can be produced and measured using the strong coupling\nbetween an artificial atom and one or more cavities. Of particular importance\nare Schrodinger cat states of photons. Despite long being considered exemplars\nof frail quantum superpositions that quickly decohere, such states have\nrecently been used as the basis for quantum error correction codes which have\nreached the long-sought goal of enhancing the lifetime of quantum information\nthrough active quantum error correction.\n", "  Using {\\em ab initio} density functional theory calculations, we characterize\nchanges in the electronic structure of MoS$_{2}$ monolayers introduced by\nmissing or additional adsorbed sulfur atoms. We furthermore identify the\nchemical and electronic function of substances that have been reported to\nreduce the adverse effect of sulfur vacancies in quenching photoluminescence\nand reducing electronic conductance. We find that thiol-group containing\nmolecules adsorbed at vacancy sites may re-insert missing sulfur atoms. In\npresence of additional adsorbed sulfur atoms, thiols may form disulfides on the\nMoS$_{2}$ surface to mitigate the adverse effect of defects.\n", "  High pressure can provoke spin transitions in transition metal-bearing\ncompounds. These transitions are of high interest not only for fundamental\nphysics and chemistry, but also may have important implications for\ngeochemistry and geophysics of the Earth and planetary interiors. Here we have\ncarried out a comparative study of the pressure-induced spin transition in\ncompounds with trivalent iron, octahedrally coordinated by oxygen.\nHigh-pressure single-crystal M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy data for FeBO$_3$,\nFe$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_3$(Fe$_{1.766(2)}$Si$_{0.234(2)}$)(SiO$_4$)$_3$ are\npresented together with detailed analysis of hyperfine parameter behavior. We\nargue that $\\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ is an intermediate phase in the reconstructive\nphase transition between $\\iota$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and $\\theta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and\nquestion the proposed perovskite-type structure for $\\zeta$-Fe$_2$O$_3$.The\nstructural data show that the spin transition is closely related to the volume\nof the iron octahedron. The transition starts when volumes reach 8.9-9.3\n\\AA$^3$, which corresponds to pressures of 45-60 GPa, depending on the\ncompound. Based on phenomenological arguments we conclude that the spin\ntransition can proceed only as a first-order phase transition in\nmagnetically-ordered compounds. An empirical rule for prediction of cooperative\nbehavior at the spin transition is proposed. The instability of iron octahedra,\ntogether with strong interactions between them in the vicinity of the critical\nvolume, may trigger a phase transition in the metastable phase. We find that\nthe isomer shift of high spin iron ions depends linearly on the octahedron\nvolume with approximately the same coefficient, independent of the particular\ncompounds and/or oxidation state. For eight-fold coordinated Fe$^{2+}$ we\nobserve a significantly weaker nonlinear volume dependence.\n", "  Bilayer graphene can exhibit deformations such that the two graphene sheets\nare locally detached from each other resulting in a structure consisting of\ndomains with different inter-layer coupling. Here we investigate how the\npresence of these domains affect the transport properties of bilayer graphene.\nWe derive analytical expressions for the transmission probability, and the\ncorresponding conductance, across walls separating different inter-layer\ncoupling domain. We find that the transmission can exhibit a valley-dependent\nlayer asymmetry and that the domain walls have a considerable effect on the\nchiral tunnelling properties of the charge carriers. We show that transport\nmeasurements allow one to obtain the strength with which the two layers are\ncoupled. We performed numerical calculations for systems with two domain walls\nand find that the availability of multiple transport channels in bilayer\ngraphene modifies significantly the conductance dependence on inter-layer\npotential asymmetry.\n", "  This paper reports the development of a Python Non-Uniform Fast Fourier\nTransform (PyNUFFT) package, which accelerates non-Cartesian image\nreconstruction on heterogeneous platforms. Scientific computing with Python\nencompasses a mature and integrated environment. The NUFFT algorithm has been\nextensively used for non-Cartesian image reconstruction but previously there\nwas no native Python NUFFT library. The current PyNUFFT software enables\nmulti-dimensional NUFFT on heterogeneous platforms. The PyNUFFT also provides\nseveral solvers, including the conjugate gradient method, $\\ell$1\ntotal-variation regularized ordinary least square (L1TV-OLS) and $\\ell$1\ntotal-variation regularized least absolute deviation (L1TV-LAD).\nMetaprogramming libraries were employed to accelerate PyNUFFT. The PyNUFFT\npackage has been tested on multi-core CPU and GPU, with acceleration factors of\n6.3 - 9.5$\\times$ on a 32 thread CPU platform and 5.4 - 13$\\times$ on the GPU.\n", "  Many results in mathematical relativity, including results for both the\ninitial data problem and for the evolution problem, rely on the existence of a\nconstant mean curvature (CMC) Cauchy surface in the underlying spacetime.\nHowever, it is known that some spacetimes have no CMC Cauchy surfaces (slices).\nThis is an obstacle for many results and constructions with these types of\nspacetimes, and is particularly worrisome since it is not known whether\nspacetimes that do have CMC slices are in any sense generic. In this expository\npaper, we will discuss the known results about the existence (and\nnon-existence) of CMC slices, examine the evidence for cases which are unknown,\nand make several conjectures concerning the existence of CMC slices and their\ngenerality.\n", "  The NOvA experiment is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment\ndesigned to measure the rates of electron neutrino appearance and muon neutrino\ndisappearance. The NOvA near detector is located at Fermilab, 800 m from the\nprimary target and provides an excellent platform to measure and study\nneutrino-nucleus interactions. We present the status of the measurement of the\ndouble differential cross section with respect to muon kinematics for\ninteractions involving charged pions in the final state, $\\nu_{\\mu} + N\n\\rightarrow \\mu + \\pi^{+/-} + X$. We have derived a convolutional neural\nnetwork-based approach for the identification of neutrino interactions with the\nspecific final state topology. We present event classification efficiency\nstudies using this particle identification and classification methodology,\nalong with systematic uncertainties and prospects for the measurement.\n", "  The El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a mode of interannual\nvariability in the coupled equatorial Pacific coupled atmosphere/ocean system.\nEl Ni\\~no describes a state in which sea surface temperatures in the eastern\nPacific increase and upwelling of colder, deep waters diminishes. El Ni\\~no\nevents typically peak in boreal winter, but their strength varies irregularly\non decadal time scales. There were exceptionally strong El Ni\\~no events in\n1982-83, 1997-98 and 2015-16 that affected weather on a global scale. Widely\npublicized forecasts in 2014 predicted that the 2015-16 event would occur a\nyear earlier. Predicting the strength of El Ni\\~no is a matter of practical\nconcern due to its effects on hydroclimate and agriculture around the world.\nThis paper discusses the frequency and regularity of strong El Ni\\~no events in\nthe context of chaotic dynamical systems. We discover a mechanism that limits\ntheir predictability in a conceptual \"recharge oscillator\" model of ENSO. Weak\nseasonal forcing or noise in this model can induce irregular switching between\nan oscillatory state that has strong El Ni\\~no events and a chaotic state that\nlacks strong events, In this regime, the timing of strong El Ni\\~no events on\ndecadal time scales is unpredictable.\n"]}
