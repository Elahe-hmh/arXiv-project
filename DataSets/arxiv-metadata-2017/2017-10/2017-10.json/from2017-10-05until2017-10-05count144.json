We find a series of interesting features that can be\ndirectly contrastedto the case of the typically energy-conserving ultracold\nalkali-atom Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). For sizeable parameter ranges, in\nline with earlier findings, the nodeless state becomes unstable towards the\nformation of {\\em stable} nonlinear single or multi-vortex excitations. The\npotential instability of the single vortex is also examined and is found to\npossess similar characteristics to those of the nodeless cloud. We also report\nthat, contrary to what is known, e.g., for the atomic BEC case, {\\it stable}\nstationary gray rings (that can be thought of as radial forms of a Nozaki-Bekki\nhole) can be found for polariton condensates in suitable parametric regimes. In\nother regimes, however, these may also suffer symmetry breaking instabilities.\nThe dynamical, pattern-forming implications of the above instabilities are\nexplored through direct numerical simulations and, in turn, give rise to\nwaveforms with triangular or quadrupolar symmetry.\n", "  We study the time evolution of a conformal field theory deformed by a\nrelevant operator under a smooth but fast quantum quench which brings it to the\nconformal point. We argue that when the quench time scale $\\delta t$ is small\ncompared to the scale set by the relevant coupling, the expectation value of\nthe quenched operator scales universally as $\\delta g/ \\delta t ^{2\\Delta-d}$\nwhere $\\delta g$ is the quench amplitude. This growth is further enhanced by a\nlogarithmic factor in even dimensions. We present explicit results for free\nscalar and fermionic field theories, supported by an analytic understanding of\nthe leading contribution for fast quenches. Results from this Letter suggest\nthat this scaling result, first found in holography, is in fact universal to\nquantum quenches. Our considerations also show that this limit of fast smooth\nquenches is quite different from an instantaneous quench from one\ntime-independent Hamiltonian to another, where the Schrodinger picture state at\nthe time of the quench simply serves as an initial condition for subsequent\nevolution with the final Hamiltonian.\n", "  A mysterious increase of radiocarbon 14C ca. 775 AD in the Earth's atmosphere\nhas been recently found by Miyake et al. (Nature, 486, 240, 2012). A possible\nsource of this event has been discussed widely, the most likely being an\nextreme solar energetic particle event. A new exotic hypothesis has been\npresented recently by Liu et al. (Nature Sci. Rep., 4, 3728, 2014) who proposed\nthat the event was caused by a comet bringing additional 14C to Earth. Here we\ncalculated a realistic mass and size of such a comet to show that it would have\nbeen huge (~100 km across and 10^{14}-10^{15} ton of mass) and would have\nproduced a disastrous impact on Earth. Such an impact could not remain\nunnoticed in the geological records and chronicles. The absence of an evidence\nfor such a dramatic event makes this hypothesis invalid.\n", "  For any Lie supergroup whose underlying Lie group is reductive, we prove an\nextension of the Casselman-Wallach globalisation theorem: There is an\nequivalence between the category of Harish-Chandra modules and the category of\nSF-representations (smooth Fr\\'echet representations of moderate growth) whose\nmodule of finite vectors is Harish-Chandra. As an application, we extend to Lie\nsupergroups a general general form of the Gel'fand-Kazhdan criterion due to\nSun-Zhu.\n", "  We propose an algorithm for solution of high-dimensional evolutionary\nequations (ODEs and discretized time-dependent PDEs) in the Tensor Train (TT)\ndecomposition, assuming that the solution and the right-hand side of the ODE\nadmit such a decomposition with a low storage. A linear ODE, discretized via\none-step or Chebyshev differentiation schemes, turns into a large linear\nsystem. The tensor decomposition allows to solve this system for several time\npoints simultaneously using an extension of the Alternating Least Squares\nalgorithm. This method computes the TT approximation of the solution directly,\nwithout ever solving the original large problem, and encapsulates the Galerkin\nmodel reduction of the ODE. This allows an efficient estimation of the time\ndiscretization error, and hence provides a way to adapt the time steps.\nBesides, conservation laws can be preserved exactly in the reduced model by\nexpanding the approximation subspace with the generating vectors of the linear\ninvariants and correction of the euclidean norm. In numerical experiments with\nthe transport and the chemical master equations, we demonstrate that the new\nmethod is faster than traditional time stepping and stochastic simulation\nalgorithms, whereas the invariants are preserved up to the machine precision\nirrespectively of the TT approximation accuracy.\n", "  The underlying structural order that transcends the liquid, glass and\ncrystalline states is identified using an efficient genetic algorithm (GA). GA\nidentifies the most common energetically favorable packing motif in crystalline\nstructures close to the alloy's Al-10 at.% Sm composition. These motifs are in\nturn compared to the observed packing motifs in the actual liquid structures\nusing a cluster-alignment method which reveals the average topology.\nConventional descriptions of the short-range order, such as Voronoi\ntessellation, are too rigid in their analysis of the configurational poly-types\nwhen describing the chemical and topological ordering during transition from\nundercooled metallic liquids to crystalline phases or glass. Our approach here\nbrings new insight into describing mesoscopic order-disorder transitions in\ncondensed matter physics.\n", "  We expand on the investigation of the universal scaling properties in the\nearly time behaviour of fast but smooth quantum quenches in a general\n$d$-dimensional conformal field theory deformed by a relevant operator of\ndimension $\\Delta$ with a time-dependent coupling. The quench consists of\nchanging the coupling from an initial constant value $\\lambda_1$ by an amount\nof the order of $\\delta \\lambda$ to some other final value $\\lambda_2$, over a\ntime scale $\\delta t$. In the fast quench limit where $\\delta t$ is smaller\nthan all other length scales in the problem, $ \\delta t \\ll\n\\lambda_1^{1/(\\Delta-d)}, \\lambda_2^{1/(\\Delta-d)}, \\delta\n\\lambda^{1/(\\Delta-d)}$, the energy (density) injected into the system scales\nas $\\delta{\\cal E} \\sim (\\delta \\lambda)^2 (\\delta t)^{d-2\\Delta}$. Similarly,\nthe change in the expectation value of the quenched operator at times earlier\nthan the endpoint of the quench scales as $<{\\cal O}_\\Delta> \\sim \\delta\n\\lambda (\\delta t)^{d-2\\Delta}$, with further logarithmic enhancements in\ncertain cases. While these results were first found in holographic studies, we\nrecently demonstrated that precisely the same scaling appears in fast mass\nquenches of free scalar and free fermionic field theories. As we describe in\ndetail, the universal scaling refers to renormalized quantities, in which the\nUV divergent pieces are consistently renormalized away by subtracting\ncounterterms derived with an adiabatic expansion. We argue that this scaling\nlaw is a property of the conformal field theory at the UV fixed point, valid\nfor arbitrary relevant deformations and insensitive to the details of the\nquench protocol. Our results highlight the difference between smooth fast\nquenches and instantaneous quenches where the Hamiltonian abruptly changes at\nsome time.\n", "  Variational integrators for Lagrangian dynamical systems provide a systematic\nway to derive geometric numerical methods. These methods preserve a discrete\nmultisymplectic form as well as momenta associated to symmetries of the\nLagrangian via Noether's theorem. An inevitable prerequisite for the derivation\nof variational integrators is the existence of a variational formulation for\nthe considered problem. Even though for a large class of systems this\nrequirement is fulfilled, there are many interesting examples which do not\nbelong to this class, e.g., equations of advection-diffusion type frequently\nencountered in fluid dynamics or plasma physics. On the other hand, it is\nalways possible to embed an arbitrary dynamical system into a larger Lagrangian\nsystem using the method of formal (or adjoint) Lagrangians. We investigate the\napplication of the variational integrator method to formal Lagrangians, and\nthereby extend the application domain of variational integrators to include\npotentially all dynamical systems. The theory is supported by physically\nrelevant examples, such as the advection equation and the vorticity equation,\nand numerically verified. Remarkably, the integrator for the vorticity equation\ncombines Arakawa's discretisation of the Poisson brackets with a symplectic\ntime stepping scheme in a fully covariant way such that the discrete energy is\nexactly preserved. In the presentation of the results, we try to make the\ngeometric framework of variational integrators accessible to non specialists.\n", "  A highly nonlinear, fourth-order wave equation that models the continuum\ntheory of long wavelength pulses in weakly compressed, discrete, homogeneous\nchains with a general power-law contact interaction is studied. For this wave\nequation, all solitary wave solutions and all nonlinear periodic wave\nsolutions, along with all conservation laws, are derived. The solutions are\nexplicitly parameterized in terms of the asymptotic value of the wave amplitude\nin the case of solitary waves and the peak of the wave amplitude in the case of\nnonlinear periodic waves. All cases in which the solution expressions can be\nstated in an explicit analytic form using elementary functions are worked out.\nIn these cases, explicit expressions for the total energy and total momentum\nfor all solutions are obtained as well. The derivation of the solutions uses\nthe conservation laws combined with an energy analysis argument to reduce the\nwave equation directly to a separable first-order differential equation which\ndetermines the wave amplitude in terms of the travelling wave variable. This\nmethod can be applied more generally to other highly nonlinear wave equations.\n", "  We show that the in-plane heterostructures realized in vertical cavities with\nhigh contrast grating(HCG) reflector enables exotic configurations of\nheterostructure and photonic wells. In photonic crystal heterostructures\nforming a photonic well, the property of a confined mode is determined by the\nwell width and barrier height. We show that in vertical-cavity in-plane\nheterostructures, anisotropic dispersion curvatures plays a key role as well,\nleading to exotic effects such as a photonic well with conduction band like\nwell and a valence band like barrier. We investigate three examples to discuss\nthe rich potential of this heterostructure as a platform for various physics\nstudies and propose a system of two laterally coupled cavities which shows the\nbreaking of parity-time symmetry as an example.\n", "  Dark matter may be charged under dark electromagnetism with a dark photon\nthat kinetically mixes with the Standard Model photon. In this framework, dark\nmatter will collect at the center of the Earth and annihilate into dark\nphotons, which may reach the surface of the Earth and decay into observable\nparticles. We determine the resulting signal rates, including Sommerfeld\nenhancements, which play an important role in bringing the Earth's dark matter\npopulation to their maximal, equilibrium value. For dark matter masses $m_X\n\\sim$ 100 GeV - 10 TeV, dark photon masses $m_{A'} \\sim$ MeV - GeV, and kinetic\nmixing parameters $\\varepsilon \\sim 10^{-10} - 10^{-8}$, the resulting\nelectrons, muons, photons, and hadrons that point back to the center of the\nEarth are a smoking-gun signal of dark matter that may be detected by a variety\nof experiments, including neutrino telescopes, such as IceCube, and space-based\ncosmic ray detectors, such as Fermi-LAT and AMS. We determine the signal rates\nand characteristics, and show that large and striking signals---such as\nparallel muon tracks---are possible in regions of the $(m_{A'}, \\varepsilon)$\nplane that are not probed by direct detection, accelerator experiments, or\nastrophysical observations.\n", "  A finite dimensional quantum system for which the quantum chaos conjecture\napplies has eigenstates, which show the same statistical properties than the\ncolumn vectors of random orthogonal or unitary matrices. Here, we consider the\ndifferent probabilities for obtaining a specific outcome in a projective\nmeasurement, provided the system is in one of its eigenstates. We then give\nanalytic expressions for the joint probability density for these probabilities,\nwith respect to the ensemble of random matrices. In the case of the unitary\ngroup, our results can be applied, also, to the phenomenon of universal\nconductance fluctuations, where the same mathematical quantities describe\npartial conductances in a two-terminal mesoscopic scattering problem with a\nfinite number of modes in each terminal.\n", "  Reduced magnetohydrodynamics is a simplified set of magnetohydrodynamics\nequations with applications to both fusion and astrophysical plasmas,\npossessing a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure and consequently a number of\nconserved functionals. We propose a new discretisation strategy for these\nequations based on a discrete variational principle applied to a formal\nLagrangian. The resulting integrator preserves important quantities like the\ntotal energy, magnetic helicity and cross helicity exactly (up to machine\nprecision). As the integrator is free of numerical resistivity, spurious\nreconnection along current sheets is absent in the ideal case. If effects of\nelectron inertia are added, reconnection of magnetic field lines is allowed,\nalthough the resulting model still possesses a noncanonical Hamiltonian\nstructure. After reviewing the conservation laws of the model equations, the\nadopted variational principle with the related conservation laws are described\nboth at the continuous and discrete level. We verify the favourable properties\nof the variational integrator in particular with respect to the preservation of\nthe invariants of the models under consideration and compare with results from\nthe literature and those of a pseudo-spectral code.\n", "  Dark matter may interact with the Standard Model through the kinetic mixing\nof dark photons, $A'$, with Standard Model photons. Such dark matter will\naccumulate in the Sun and annihilate into dark photons. The dark photons may\nthen leave the Sun and decay into pairs of charged Standard Model particles\nthat can be detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The directionality of\nthis \"dark sunshine\" is distinct from all astrophysical backgrounds, providing\nan opportunity for unambiguous dark matter discovery by AMS. We perform a\ncomplete analysis of this scenario including Sommerfeld enhancements of dark\nmatter annihilation and the effect of the Sun's magnetic field on the signal,\nand we define a set of cuts to optimize the signal probability. With the three\nyears of data already collected, AMS may discover dark matter with mass 1 TeV\n$\\lesssim m_X \\lesssim$ 10 TeV, dark photon masses $m_{A'} \\sim \\mathcal\nO(100)$ MeV, and kinetic mixing parameters $10^{-10} \\lesssim \\varepsilon\n\\lesssim 10^{-8}$. The proposed search extends beyond existing beam dump and\nsupernova bounds, and it is complementary to direct detection, probing the same\nregion of parameter space for elastic dark matter, but potentially far more in\nthe case of inelastic dark matter.\n", "  For the super-hyperbolic space in any dimension, we introduce the\nnon-Euclidean Helgason--Fourier transform. We prove an inversion formula\nexhibiting residue contributions at the poles of the Harish-Chandra c-function,\nsignalling discrete parts in the spectrum. The proof is based on a detailed\nstudy of the spherical superfunctions, using recursion relations and\nlocalization techniques to normalize them precisely, careful estimates of their\nderivatives, and a rigorous analysis of the boundary terms appearing in the\npolar coordinate expression of the invariant integral\n", "  We show the strength of the Fourier modal method (FMM) for numerically\ninvestigating the optical properties of vertical cavities including\nsubwavelength gratings. Three different techniques for determining the\nresonance frequency and Q-factor of a cavity mode are compared. Based on that,\nthe Fabry-Perot approach has been chosen due to its numerical efficiency. The\ncomputational uncertainty in determining the resonance frequency and Q-factor\nis investigated, showing that the uncertainty in the Q-factor calculation can\nbe a few orders of magnitude larger than that in the resonance frequency\ncalculation. Moreover, a method for reducing 3D simulations to\nlower-dimensional simulations is suggested, and is shown to enable approximate\nand fast simulations of certain device parameters. Numerical calculation of the\ncavity dispersion, which is an important characteristic of vertical cavities,\nis illustrated. By employing the implemented FMM, it is shown that adiabatic\nheterostructures designs are advantageous compared to abrupt heterostructures\nfor minimizing the cavity scattering loss.\n", "  We use the form factors of the quantum transfer matrix in the\nzero-temperature limit in order to study the two-point ground-state correlation\nfunctions of the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime. We obtain\nnovel form factor series representations of the correlation functions which\ndiffer from those derived either from the q-vertex-operator approach or from\nthe algebraic Bethe Ansatz approach to the usual transfer matrix. We advocate\nthat our novel representations are numerically more efficient and allow for a\nstraightforward calculation of the large-distance asymptotic behaviour of the\ntwo-point functions. Keeping control over the temperature corrections to the\ntwo-point functions we see that these are of order $T^\\infty$ in the whole\nantiferromagnetic massive regime. The isotropic limit of our result yields a\nnovel form factor series representation for the two-point correlation functions\nof the XXX chain at zero magnetic field.\n", "  We report the spectroscopic confirmation of 22 new multiply lensed sources\nbehind the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS~J0416.1$-$2403 (MACS\n0416), using archival data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on\nthe VLT. Combining with previous spectroscopic measurements of 15 other\nmultiply imaged sources, we obtain a sample of 102 secure multiple images with\nmeasured redshifts, the largest to date in a single strong lensing system. The\nnewly confirmed sources are largely low-luminosity Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters with\nredshift in the range [3.08-6.15]. With such a large number of secure\nconstraints, and a significantly improved sample of galaxy members in the\ncluster core, we have improved our previous strong lensing model and obtained a\nrobust determination of the projected total mass distribution of MACS 0416. We\nfind evidence of three cored dark-matter halos, adding to the known complexity\nof this merging system. The total mass density profile, as well as the sub-halo\npopulation, are found in good agreement with previous works. We update and make\npublic the redshift catalog of MACS 0416 from our previous spectroscopic\ncampaign with the new MUSE redshifts. We also release lensing maps\n(convergence, shear, magnification) in the standard HFF format.\n", "  We present a novel framework for Finite Element Particle-in-Cell methods\nbased on the discretization of the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the\nVlasov-Maxwell system. We derive a semi-discrete Poisson bracket, which retains\nthe defining properties of a bracket, anti-symmetry and the Jacobi identity, as\nwell as conservation of its Casimir invariants, implying that the semi-discrete\nsystem is still a Hamiltonian system. In order to obtain a fully discrete\nPoisson integrator, the semi-discrete bracket is used in conjunction with\nHamiltonian splitting methods for integration in time. Techniques from Finite\nElement Exterior Calculus ensure conservation of the divergence of the magnetic\nfield and Gauss' law as well as stability of the field solver. The resulting\nmethods are gauge invariant, feature exact charge conservation and show\nexcellent long-time energy and momentum behaviour. Due to the generality of our\nframework, these conservation properties are guaranteed independently of a\nparticular choice of the Finite Element basis, as long as the corresponding\nFinite Element spaces satisfy certain compatibility conditions.\n", "  The global optimum for valence population transfer in the NO$_2$ molecule\ndriven by impulsive x-ray stimulated Raman scattering of one-femtosecond x-ray\npulses tuned below the Oxygen K-edge is determined with the Multiconfiguration\nTime-Dependent Hartree-Fock method, a fully-correlated first-principles\ntreatment that allows for the ionization of every electron in the molecule.\nFinal valence state populations computed in the fixed-nuclei, nonrelativistic\napproximation are reported as a function of central wavelength and intensity.\nThe convergence of the calculations with respect to their adjustable parameters\nis fully tested. Fixing the 1fs duration but varying the central frequency and\nintensity of the pulse, without chirp, orientation-averaged maximum population\ntransfer of 0.7\\% to the valence B$_1$ state is obtained at an intensity of\n3.16$\\times$10$^{17}$ W cm$^{-2}$, with the central frequency substantially 6eV\nred-detuned from the 2nd order optimum; 2.39\\% is obtained at one specific\norientation. The behavior near the global optimum, below the Oxygen K-edge, is\nconsistent with the mechanism of nonresonant Raman transitions driven by the\nnear-edge fine structure oscillator strength.\n", "  We present the discovery of a very faint stellar system, SMASH 1, that is\npotentially a satellite of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Found within the Survey\nof the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH), SMASH 1 is a compact ($r_h =\n9.1^{+5.9}_{-3.4}$ pc) and very low luminosity (M_V = -1.0 +/- 0.9,\n$L_V=10^{2.3 +/- 0.4}$ Lsun) stellar system that is revealed by its sparsely\npopulated main sequence and a handful of red-giant-branch candidate member\nstars. The photometric properties of these stars are compatible with a\nmetal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.2) and old (13 Gyr) isochrone located at a distance\nmodulus of ~18.8, i.e. a distance of ~57 kpc. Situated at 11.3$^\\circ$ from the\nLMC in projection, its 3-dimensional distance from the Cloud is ~13 kpc,\nconsistent with a connection to the LMC, whose tidal radius is at least 16 kpc.\nAlthough the nature of SMASH 1 remains uncertain, its compactness favors it\nbeing a stellar cluster and hence dark-matter free. If this is the case, its\ndynamical tidal radius is only <19 pc at this distance from the LMC, and\nsmaller than the system's extent on the sky. Its low luminosity and apparent\nhigh ellipticity ($\\epsilon=0.62^{+0.17}_{-0.21}$) with its major axis pointing\ntoward the LMC may well be the tell-tale sign of its imminent tidal demise.\n", "  In encryption, non-malleability is a highly desirable property: it ensures\nthat adversaries cannot manipulate the plaintext by acting on the ciphertext.\nAmbainis, Bouda and Winter gave a definition of non-malleability for the\nencryption of quantum data. In this work, we show that this definition is too\nweak, as it allows adversaries to \"inject\" plaintexts of their choice into the\nciphertext. We give a new definition of quantum non-malleability which resolves\nthis problem. Our definition is expressed in terms of entropic quantities,\nconsiders stronger adversaries, and does not assume secrecy. Rather, we prove\nthat quantum non-malleability implies secrecy; this is in stark contrast to the\nclassical setting, where the two properties are completely independent. For\nunitary schemes, our notion of non-malleability is equivalent to encryption\nwith a two-design (and hence also to the definition of Ambainis et al.). Our\ntechniques also yield new results regarding the closely-related task of quantum\nauthentication. We show that \"total authentication\" (a notion recently proposed\nby Garg, Yuen and Zhandry) can be satisfied with two-designs, a significant\nimprovement over the eight-design construction of Garg et al. We also show\nthat, under a mild adaptation of the rejection procedure, both total\nauthentication and our notion of non-malleability yield quantum authentication\nas defined by Dupuis, Nielsen and Salvail.\n", "  In nuclear astrophysics, quantum simulations of large inhomogeneous dense\nsystems as they appear in the crusts of neutron stars present big challenges.\nThe number of particles in a simulation with periodic boundary conditions is\nstrongly limited due to the immense computational cost of the quantum methods.\nIn this paper, we describe techniques for an efficient and scalable parallel\nimplementation of Sky3D, a nuclear density functional theory solver that\noperates on an equidistant grid. Presented techniques allow Sky3D to achieve\ngood scaling and high performance on a large number of cores, as demonstrated\nthrough detailed performance analysis on a Cray XC40 supercomputer.\n", "  We use the density matrix renormalization group method to study the\nproperties of the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model doped with Kondo\nholes. We find that the perturbation of the Kondo holes to the local\nhybridization exhibits spatial oscillation pattern and its amplitude decays\nexponentially with distance away from the Kondo hole sites. The hybridization\noscillation is correlated with both the charge density oscillation of the\nconduction electrons and the oscillation in the correlation function of the\nHeisenberg spins. In particular, we find that the oscillation wavelength for\nintermediate Kondo couplings is given by the Fermi wavevector of the large\nFermi surface even before it is formed. This suggests that heavy electrons\nresponsible for the oscillation are already present in this regime and start to\naccumulate around the to-be-formed large Fermi surface in the Brillouin zone.\n", "  Neutrinos are the only known elementary fermions that can exhibit Majorana\nnature. As per the \"practical Dirac-Majorana confusion theorem\" it is\nimpossible to distinguish between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos via any\nkinematic tests when their masses are very small. However, it is also well\nknown that Majorana neutrino and anti-neutrino present in the final state must\nobey the Fermi-Dirac statistics, irrespective of how small the mass of neutrino\nis. We propose a new method to search for Majorana neutrinos by exploiting\ntheir quantum statistical property. We analyse `effective' three-body decays of\nthe kind $X \\to Y \\nu \\overline{\\nu}$ (e.g.\\ $X \\left[ B^0 \\right] \\to \\pi^+\n\\big( \\to \\mu^+ \\nu_{\\mu} \\big) \\mu^- \\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu} \\equiv Y \\left[\n\\mu^+ \\mu^-\\right] \\nu_{\\mu} \\overline{\\nu}_{\\mu}$), with 4-momenta of $X$ and\n$Y$ experimentally known, such that the 4-momenta of both neutrino and\nanti-neutrino can be deduced. For Majorana neutrinos the distribution of events\nin the `effective' Dalitz plot for such a well chosen process would be fully\nsymmetric under exchange of the neutrino and anti-neutrino. Unlike the\nneutrinoless double-beta decay or other lepton-number violating modes, this\ndistinction between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos survives even in the almost\nmassless neutrino limit due to the quantum statistical property.\n", "  In this paper, we prove a general result concerning finite-range, attractive\ninteracting particle systems on $\\{-1, 1\\}^{\\mathbb{Z}^d}$. If the particle\nsystem has a unique stationary measure and, in a precise sense, relaxes to this\nstationary measure at an exponential rate then any small perturbation of the\ndynamics also has a unique stationary measure to which it relaxes at an\nexponential rate. To augment this result, we study the particular case of\nGlauber dynamics for the Ising model. We show that for any non-zero external\nfield the dynamics converges to its unique invariant measure at an exponential\nrate. Previously, this was only known for $\\beta<\\beta_c$ and $\\beta$\nsufficiently large. As a consequence, Glauber dynamics is stable to small,\nnon-equilibrium perturbations in the entire uniqueness phase.\n", "  Using Bloch's parametrization for qudits ($d$-level quantum systems), we\nwrite the Hilbert-Schmidt distance (HSD) between two generic $n$-qudit states\nas an Euclidean distance between two vectors of observables mean values in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{\\Pi_{s=1}^{n}d_{s}^{2}-1}$, where $d_{s}$ is the dimension for\nqudit $s$. Then, applying the generalized Gell Mann's matrices to generate\n$SU(d_{s})$, we use that result to obtain the Hilbert-Schmidt quantum coherence\n(HSC) of $n$-qudit systems. As examples, we consider in details one-qubit,\none-qutrit, two-qubit, and two copies of one-qubit states. In this last case,\nthe possibility for controlling local and non-local coherences by tuning local\npopulations is studied and the contrasting behaviors of HSC, $l_{1}$-norm\ncoherence, and relative entropy of coherence in this regard are noticed. We\nalso investigate the decoherent dynamics of these coherence functions under the\naction of qutrit dephasing and dissipation channels. At last, we analyze the\nnon-monotonicity of HSD under tensor products and report the first instance of\na consequence (for coherence quantification) of this kind of property of a\nquantum distance measure.\n", "  A ferromagnetic quantum critical point is thought not to exist in two and\nthree-dimensional metallic systems yet is realized in the Kondo lattice\ncompound YbNi4(P,As)2, possibly due to its one-dimensionality. It is crucial to\ninvestigate the dimensionality of the Fermi surface of YbNi4P2 experimentally\nbut common probes such as ARPES and quantum oscillation measurements are\nlacking. Here, we studied the magnetic field dependence of transport and\nthermodynamic properties of YbNi4P2. The Kondo effect is continuously\nsuppressed and additionally we identify nine Lifshitz transitions between 0.4\nand 18 T. We analyze the transport coefficients in detail and identify the type\nof Lifshitz transitions as neck or void type to gain information on the Fermi\nsurface of YbNi4P2. The large number of Lifshitz transitions observed within\nthis small energy window is unprecedented and results from the particular flat\nrenormalized band structure with strong 4f-electron character shaped by the\nKondo lattice effect.\n", "  A precise measurement of the Higgs $h \\to Z \\gamma$ decay is very challenging\nat the LHC, due to the very low %SM $h \\to Z \\gamma\\, (Z \\to \\ell \\ell)$\nbranching fraction and the shortage of kinematic handles to suppress the large\nSM $Z \\gamma$ background. We show how such a measurement would be significantly\nimproved by considering Higgs production in association with a hard jet. We\ncompare the prospective HL-LHC sensitivity in this channel with other Higgs\nproduction modes where $h$ is fairly boosted, e.g.~weak boson fusion, and also\nto the potential $h \\to Z \\gamma$ measurement achievable with a future\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ circular collider ({\\sl fcc-ee}). Finally, we discuss new physics\nimplications of a precision measurement of $h \\to Z \\gamma$.\n", "  In this paper we present the status of the physics of Planck scale black\nholes with particular reference to their conjectured production in particle\naccelerator experiments at the terascale. After reviewing some open issues of\nfundamental interactions and introducing the physics in the large\nextra-dimensional scenario, we present the expected signatures left by a\nmicroscopic black hole in a particle detector. The final part of the paper is\ndevoted to the latest experimental bounds on the sought black hole signals.\n", "  A theory for the evolution of a metric $g$ driven by the equations of\nthree-dimensional continuum mechanics is developed. This metric in turn allows\nfor the local existence of an evolving three-dimensional Riemannian manifold\nimmersed in the six-dimensional Euclidean space. The Nash-Kuiper theorem is\nthen applied to this Riemannian manifold to produce a wild evolving $C^{1}$\nmanifold. The theory is applied to the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes\nequations. One practical outcome of the theory is a computation of critical\nprofile initial data for what may be interpreted as the onset of turbulence for\nthe classical incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n", "  The dark sector may contain a dark photon that kinetically mixes with the\nStandard Model photon, allowing dark matter to interact weakly with normal\nmatter. In previous work we analyzed the implications of this scenario for dark\nmatter capture by the Sun. Dark matter will gather in the core of the Sun and\nannihilate to dark photons. These dark photons travel outwards from the center\nof the Sun and may decay to produce positrons that can be detected by the Alpha\nMagnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) on the ISS. We found that the dark photon\nparameter space accessible to this analysis is largely constrained by strong\nlimits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section from direct detection\nexperiments. In this paper we build upon previous work by considering the case\nwhere the dark sector contains two species of Dirac fermion that are nearly\ndegenerate in mass and couple inelastically to the dark photon. We find that\nfor small values of the mass splitting $\\Delta \\sim 100 ~\\text{keV}$, the\npredicted positron signal at AMS-02 remains largely unchanged from the\npreviously considered elastic case while constraints from direct detection are\nrelaxed, leaving a region of parameter space with dark matter mass $100\n~\\text{GeV} \\lesssim m_X \\lesssim 10 ~\\text{TeV}$, dark photon mass $1\n~\\text{MeV} \\lesssim m_{A'} \\lesssim 100 ~\\text{MeV}$, and kinetic mixing\nparameter $10^{-9} \\lesssim \\varepsilon \\lesssim 10^{-8}$ that is untouched by\nsupernova observations and fixed target experiments but where an inelastic dark\nsector may still be discovered using existing AMS-02 data.\n", "  Cellular materials not only show interesting static properties but can also\nbe used to manipulate dynamic mechanical waves. In this contribution, the\nexistence of phononic band gaps in periodic cellular structures is\nexperimentally shown via sonic transmission experiment. Cellular structures\nwith varying numbers of cells are excited by piezoceramic actuators and the\ntransmitted waves are measured by piezoceramic sensors. The minimum number of\ncells necessary to form a clear band gap is determined. A rotation of the cells\ndoes not have an influence on the formation of the gap, indicating a complete\nphononic band gap. The experimental results are in good agreement with the\nnumerically obtained dispersion relation.\n", "  The studies of many-body dynamics of interacting spin ensembles, as well as\nquantum sensing in solid state systems, are often limited by the need for high\nspin concentrations, along with efficient decoupling of the spin ensemble of\ninterest from its spin-bath environment. In particular, for an ensemble of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, high conversion efficiencies between\nnitrogen (P1) defects and NV centers are essential, while maintaining long\ncoherence times of an NV ensemble. In this work, we study the effect of\nelectron irradiation on the conversion efficiency and the coherence time of\nvarious types of diamond samples with different initial nitrogen\nconcentrations. The samples were irradiated using a 200 keV transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM). Our study reveals that the efficiency of NV creation\nstrongly depends on the initial conversion efficiency as well as on the initial\nnitrogen concentration. We observe an order of magnitude improvement in the NV\nconcentration (up to $\\sim 10^{11}$ NV/cm^2), without any degradation in their\ncoherence times of $\\sim 180$ \\mu m. We address the potential of this technique\nto pave the way toward the study of many-body physics of ensembles of NV spins,\nand contribute to the creation of non-classical spin states for quantum\nsensing.\n", "  Photon pairs produced by parametric down-conversion or four-wave mixing can\ninterfere with each other in multiport interferometers, or carry entanglement\nbetween distant nodes for use in entanglement swapping. This requires the\nphotons be spectrally pure to ensure good interference, and have high heralding\nefficiency to know accurately the number of photons involved and to maintain\nhigh rates as the number of photons grows. Spectral filtering is often used to\nremove noise and define spectral properties. For heralded single photons high\npurity and heralding efficiency is possible by filtering the heralding arm, but\nwhen both photons in typical pair sources are filtered, we show that the\nheralding efficiency of one or both of the photons is strongly reduced even by\nideal spectral filters with 100% transmission in the passband: any improvement\nin reduced-state spectral purity from filtering comes at the cost of lowered\nheralding efficiency. We consider the fidelity to a pure, lossless single\nphoton, symmetrize it to include both photons of the pair, and show this\nquantity is intrinsically limited for sources with spectral correlation. We\nthen provide a framework for this effect for benchmarking common photon pair\nsources, and present an experiment where we vary the photon filter bandwidths\nand measure the increase in purity and corresponding reduction in heralding\nefficiency.\n", "  We investigate the quantum parameter estimation in circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics via dispersive measurement. Based on the Metropolis Hastings\n(MH) algorithm and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration, a new\nalgorithm is proposed to calculate the Fisher information by the stochastic\nmaster equation for unknown parameter estimation. Here, the Fisher information\nis expressed in the form of log-likehood functions and further approximated by\nthe MCMC integration. Numerical results demonstrate that the single evolution\nof the Fisher information can probably approach the quantum Fisher information.\nThe same phenomenon is observed in the ensemble evolution in the short time\ninterval. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm.\n", "  We have studied the cathodo- and radioluminescence of Nd:YAG and of Tm:YAG\nsingle crystals in an extended wavelength range up to $\\approx 5\\,\\mu$m in view\nof developing a new kind of detector for low-energy, low-rate energy deposition\nevents. Whereas the light yield in the visible range is as large as $\\approx\n10^{4}\\,$photons/MeV, in good agreement with literature results, in the\ninfrared range we have found a light yield $\\approx 5\\times\n10^{4}\\,$photons/MeV, thereby proving that ionizing radiation is particularly\nefficient in populating the low lying levels of rare earth doped crystals.\n", "  We introduce seven families of stochastic systems of interacting particles in\none-dimension corresponding to the seven families of irreducible reduced affine\nroot systems. We prove that they are determinantal in the sense that all\nspatio-temporal correlation functions are given by determinants controlled by a\nsingle function called the spatio-temporal correlation kernel. For the four\nfamilies ${A}_{N-1}$, ${B}_N$, ${C}_N$ and ${D}_N$, we identify the systems of\nstochastic differential equations solved by these determinantal processes,\nwhich will be regarded as the elliptic extensions of the Dyson model. Here we\nuse the notion of martingales in probability theory and the elliptic\ndeterminant evaluations of the Macdonald denominators of irreducible reduced\naffine root systems given by Rosengren and Schlosser.\n", "  We explore multi-round quantum memoryless communication protocols. These are\nrestricted version of multi-round quantum communication protocols. The\n\"memoryless\" term means that players forget history from previous rounds, and\ntheir behavior is obtained only by input and message from the opposite player.\nThe model is interesting because this allows us to get lower bounds for models\nlike automata, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams and streaming algorithms. At\nthe same time, we can prove stronger results with this restriction. We present\na lower bound for quantum memoryless protocols. Additionally, we show a lower\nbound for Disjointness function for this model. % As an application of\ncommunication complexity results, we consider Quantum Ordered Read-$k$-times\nBranching Programs ($k$-QOBDD). Our communication complexity result allows us\nto get lower bound for $k$-QOBDD and to prove hierarchies for sublinear width\nbounded error $k$-QOBDDs, where $k=o(\\sqrt{n})$. Furthermore, we prove a\nhierarchy for polynomial size bounded error $k$-QOBDDs for constant $k$. This\nresult differs from the situation with an unbounded error where it is known\nthat an increase of $k$ does not give any advantage.\n", "  AMIGA (Auger Muons and Infill for the Ground Array) is an upgrade of the\nPierre Auger Observatory designed to extend its energy range of detection and\nto directly measure the muon content of the cosmic ray primary particle\nshowers. The array will be formed by an infill of surface water-Cherenkov\ndetectors associated with buried scintillation counters employed for muon\ncounting. Each counter is composed of three scintillation modules, with a 10\nm$^2$ detection area per module. In this paper, a new generation of detectors,\nreplacing the current multi-pixel photomultiplier tube (PMT) with silicon photo\nsensors (aka. SiPMs), is proposed. The selection of the new device and its\nfront-end electronics is explained. A method to calibrate the counting system\nthat ensures the performance of the detector is detailed. This method has the\nadvantage of being able to be carried out in a remote place such as the one\nwhere the detectors are deployed. High efficiency results, i.e. 98 % efficiency\nfor the highest tested overvoltage, combined with a low probability of\naccidental counting ($\\sim$2 %), show a promising performance for this new\nsystem.\n", "  We present how to implement special relativity in computer games. The\nresultant relativistic world shows the time dilation and Lorentz contraction\nexactly, not only for the player but also for all the nonplayer characters, who\nobey the correct relativistic equation of motion according to their own\naccelerations. Causality is explicitly maintained in our formulation by use of\nthe covariant velocities, proper times, worldlines, and light cones. Faraway\nrelativistic scenes can be accurately projected onto the skydome. We show how\nto approximate a rigid body consisting of polygons, which is ubiquitous in\ncomputer games but itself is not a relativistically invariant object. We also\ngive a simple idea to mimic the Doppler effect within the RGB color scheme.\n", "  We demonstrate that an integrated silicon microring resonator is capable of\nefficiently producing photon pairs that are completely unentangled; such pairs\nare a key component of heralded single photon sources. A dual-channel\ninterferometric coupling scheme can be used to independently tune the quality\nfactors associated with the pump and signal and idler modes, yielding a\nbiphoton wavefunction with Schmidt number arbitrarily close to unity. This will\npermit the generation of heralded single photon states with unit purity.\n", "  Time-reversal invariant superconductors in three dimensions may contain nodal\nlines in the Brillouin zone, which behave exactly as Wilson loops of 3d\nmomentum-space Chern-Simons theory of the Berry connection. Here we study the\nconditions of realizing linked nodal lines (Wilson loops), which yield a\ntopological contribution to the thermal magnetoelectric coefficient that is\ngiven by the Chern-Simons action. We find the essential conditions are the\nexistence of torus or higher genus fermi surfaces and spiral spin textures. We\nconstruct such a model with two torus fermi surfaces, where a generic\nspin-dependent interaction leads to double-helix-like linked nodal lines as the\nsuperconductivity is developed.\n", "  We study order transitions and defect formation in a model high-entropy alloy\n(CuNiCoFe) under ion irradiation by means of molecular dynamics simulations.\nUsing a hybrid Monte-Carlo/molecular dynamics scheme a model alloy is generated\nwhich is thermodynamically stabilized by configurational entropy at elevated\ntemperatures, but partly decomposes at lower temperatures by copper\nprecipation. Both the high-entropy and the multiphase sample are then subjected\nto simulated particle irradiation. The damage accumulation is analyzed and\ncompared to an elemental Ni reference system. The results reveal that the\nhigh-entropy alloy---independent of the initial configuration---installs a\ncertain fraction of short-range order even under particle irradiation.\nMoreover, the results provide evidence that defect accumulation is reduced in\nthe high-entropy alloy. This is because the reduced mobility of point defects\nleads to a steady state of defect creation and annihilation. The lattice\ndefects generated by irradiation are shown to act as sinks for Cu segregation.\n", "  Segmented silicon detectors (micropixel and microstrip) are the main type of\ndetectors used in the inner trackers of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments\nat CERN. Due to the high luminosity and eventual high fluence, detectors with\nfast response to fit the short shaping time of 20 ns and sufficient radiation\nhardness are required.\n  Measurements carried out at the Ioffe Institute have shown a reversal of the\npulse polarity in the detector response to short-range charge injection. Since\nthe measured negative signal is about 30-60% of the peak positive signal, the\neffect strongly reduces the CCE even in non-irradiated detectors. For further\ninvestigation of the phenomenon the measurements have been reproduced by TCAD\nsimulations.\n  As for the measurements, the simulation study was applied for the p-on-n\nstrip detectors similar in geometry to those developed for the ATLAS experiment\nand for the Ioffe Institute designed p-on-n strip detectors with each strip\nhaving a window in the metallization covering the p$^+$ implant, allowing the\ngeneration of electron-hole pairs under the strip implant. Red laser scans\nacross the strips and the interstrip gap with varying laser diameters and\nSi-SiO$_2$ interface charge densities were carried out. The results verify the\nexperimentally observed negative response along the scan in the interstrip gap.\nWhen the laser spot is positioned on the strip p$^+$ implant the negative\nresponse vanishes and the collected charge at the active strip proportionally\nincreases.\n  The simulation results offer a further insight and understanding of the\ninfluence of the oxide charge density in the signal formation. The observed\neffects and details of the detector response for different charge injection\npositions are discussed in the context of Ramo's theorem.\n", "  In this article, we tentatively assign the $X^*(3860)$ to be the\n$C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type scalar tetraquark state, study its mass and\nwidth with the QCD sum rules, special attention is paid to calculating the\nhadronic coupling constants $G_{X\\eta_c\\pi}$ and $G_{XDD}$ concerning the\ntetraquark state. We obtain the values $M_{X}=3.86 \\pm 0.09\\,\\rm{GeV}$ and\n$\\Gamma_{X}= 202\\pm 146 \\,\\rm{MeV}$, which are consistent with the experimental\ndata. The numerical result supports assigning the $X^*(3860)$ to be the\n$C\\gamma_5\\otimes \\gamma_5C$ type scalar tetraquark state.\n", "  Simultaneous scattering invisibility and free-space field enhancement have\nbeen achieved based on multipolar interferences among all-dielectric\nnanoparticles. The scattering properties of all-dielectric nanowire quadrumers\nare investigated and two sorts of scattering invisibilities have been\nidentified: the trivial invisibility where the individual nanowires are not\neffectively excited; and the nontrivial invisibility with strong multipolar\nexcitations within each nanowire, which results in free-space field enhancement\noutside the particles. It is revealed that such nontrivial invisibility\noriginates from not only the simultaneous excitations of both electric and\nmagnetic resonances, but also their significant magnetoelectric\ncross-interactions. We further show that the invisibility obtained is both\npolarization and direction selective, which can probably play a significant\nrole in various applications including non-invasive detection, sensing, and\nnon-disturbing medical diagnosis with high sensitivity and precision.\n", "  Noise-induced transitions between metastable fixed points in systems evolving\non multiple time scales are analyzed in situations where the time scale\nseparation gives rise to a slow manifold with bifurcation. This analysis is\nperformed within the realm of large deviation theory. It is shown that these\nnon-equilibrium transitions make use of a reaction channel created by the\nbifurcation structure of the slow manifold, leading to vastly increased\ntransition rates. Several examples are used to illustrate these findings,\nincluding an insect outbreak model, a system modeling phase separation in the\npresence of evaporation, and a system modeling transitions in active matter\nself-assembly. The last example involves a spatially extended system modeled by\na stochastic partial differential equation.\n", "  The quality of graphene in nanodevices has increased hugely thanks to the use\nof hexagonal boron nitride as a supporting layer. This paper studies to which\nextent hBN together with channel length scaling can be exploited in graphene\nfield effect transistors (GFETs) to get a competitive radio frequency (RF)\nperformance. Carrier mobility and saturation velocity were obtained from an\nensemble Monte Carlo simulator that accounted for the relevant scattering\nmechanisms (intrinsic phonons, scattering with impurities and defects, etc.).\nThis information is fed into a self consistent simulator, which solves the\ndrift diffusion equation coupled with the two dimensional Poisson's equation to\ntake full account of short channel effects. Simulated GFET characteristics were\nbenchmarked against experimental data from our fabricated devices. Our\nsimulations show that scalability is supposed to bring to RF performance an\nimprovement that is, however, highly limited by instability. Despite the\npossibility of a lower performance, a careful choice of the bias point can\navoid instability. Nevertheless, maximum oscillation frequencies are still\nachievable in the THz region for channel lengths of a few hundreds of\nnanometers.\n", "  Dissipation even at zero temperature reduces quantum fluctuations and tends\nto localize particles. A notable exception is the nonlinear dissipation due to\nquasiparticle tunneling in a Josephson junction. It is well known that\nquasiparticle dissipation does not prevent the phase particle in a\nsuperconducting junction to coherently tunnel to the next-nearest minimum even\nthough tunneling to the nearest minimum is suppressed. The reason is that the\ndissipative action admits an instanton solution, the so-called Korshunov\ninstanton. Here, we analyze this model at elevated bias current $I$. We find\nthat besides the known regime where the logarithm of the tunneling rate scales\nas $I^{2/3}$ there is novel regime with a scaling $I^2$. We argue that the\nnovel regime opens an opportunity for an experimental verification of the\nKorshunov instantons as the elevated bias current leads to a larger tunneling\nrate compared to earlier results.\n", "  We study the effect of inelastic processes on the magneto-transport of a\nquasi-one dimensional Weyl semi-metal, using a modified Boltzmann-Langevin\napproach. The magnetic field drives a crossover to a ballistic regime in which\nthe propagation along the wire is dominated by the chiral anomaly, and the role\nof fluctuations inside the sample is exponentially suppressed. We show that\ninelastic collisions modify the parametric dependence of the current\nfluctuations on the magnetic field. By measuring shot noise as a function of a\nmagnetic field, for different applied voltage, one can estimate the\nelectron-electron inelastic length $l_{\\rm ee}$.\n", "  We analyze the IceCube four-year neutrino data in search of a signal from the\nFermi bubbles. No signal is found from the bubbles or from their dense shell,\neven when taking into account the softer background. This imposes a\nconservative $\\xi_i<8\\%$ upper limit on the cosmic-ray ion (CRI) acceleration\nefficiency, and an $\\eta\\equiv \\xi_e/\\xi_i \\gtrsim0.006$ lower limit on the\nelectron-to-ion ratio of acceleration efficiencies (at the $2\\sigma$ confidence\nlevel). For typical $\\xi_i$, a signal should surface once the number of IceCube\nneutrinos increases by $\\sim$an order of magnitude, unless there is a $<$PeV\ncutoff on the CRI spectrum.\n", "  The quantum Hall effect is usually observed in 2D systems. We show that the\nFermi arcs can give rise to a distinctive 3D quantum Hall effect in topological\nsemimetals. Because of the topological constraint, the Fermi arc at a single\nsurface has an open Fermi surface, which cannot host the quantum Hall effect.\nVia a \"wormhole\" tunneling assisted by the Weyl nodes, the Fermi arcs at\nopposite surfaces can form a complete Fermi loop and support the quantum Hall\neffect. The edge states of the Fermi arcs show a unique 3D distribution, giving\nan example of (d-2)-dimensional boundary states. This is distinctly different\nfrom the surface-state quantum Hall effect from a single surface of topological\ninsulator. As the Fermi energy sweeps through the Weyl nodes, the sheet Hall\nconductivity evolves from the 1/B dependence to quantized plateaus at the Weyl\nnodes. This behavior can be realized by tuning gate voltages in a slab of\ntopological semimetal, such as the TaAs family, Cd$_3$As$_2$, or Na$_3$Bi. This\nwork will be instructive not only for searching transport signatures of the\nFermi arcs but also for exploring novel electron gases in other topological\nphases of matter.\n", "  Complex network formalism allows to explain the behavior of systems composed\nby interacting units. Several prototypical network models have been proposed\nthus far. The small-world model has been introduced to mimic two important\nfeatures observed in real-world systems: i) local clustering and ii) the\npossibility to move across a network by means of long-range links that\nsignificantly reduce the characteristic path length. A natural question would\nbe whether there exist several \"types\" of small-world architectures, giving\nrise to a continuum of models with properties (partially) shared with other\nmodels belonging to different network families. Here, we take advantage of the\ninterplay between network theory and time series analysis and propose to\ninvestigate small-world signatures in complex networks by analyzing\nmultifractal characteristics of time series generated from such networks. In\nparticular, we suggest that the degree of right-sided asymmetry of multifractal\nspectra is linked with the degree of small-worldness present in networks. This\nclaim is supported by numerical simulations performed on several parametric\nmodels, including prototypical small-world networks, scale-free, fractal and\nalso real-world networks describing protein molecules. Our results also\nindicate that right-sided asymmetry emerges with the presence of the following\ntopological properties: low edge density, low average shortest path, and high\nclustering coefficient.\n", "  We study the behavior of the fermion propagator in an external time dependent\npotential in 0+1 dimension. We show that, when the potential has upto quadratic\nterms in time, the propagator can be expressed in terms of generalized Airy\nfunctions (or standard Airy functions depending on the exact time dependence).\nWe study various properties of these new generalized functions which reduce to\nthe standard Airy functions in a particular limit.\n", "  We study the evolution from few- to many-body physics of fermionic systems in\none spatial dimension with attractive pairwise interactions. We determine the\ndetailed form of the momentum distribution, the structure of the one-body\ndensity matrix, and the pairing properties encoded in the two-body density\nmatrix. From the low- and high-momentum scaling behavior of the single-particle\nmomentum distribution we estimate the speed of sound and Tan's contact,\nrespectively. Both quantities are found to be in agreement with previous\ncalculations. Based on our calculations of the one-body density matrices, we\nalso present results for the particle-partition entanglement entropy, for which\nwe find a logarithmic dependence on the total particle number.\n", "  Experimental evidence on high-Tc cuprates reveals ubiquitous charge density\nwave (CDW) modulations, which coexist with superconductivity. Although the CDW\nhad been predicted by theory, important questions remain about the extent to\nwhich the CDW influences lattice and charge degrees of freedom and its\ncharacteristics as functions of doping and temperature. These questions are\nintimately connected to the origin of the CDW and its relation to the\nmysterious cuprate pseudogap. Here, we use ultrahigh resolution resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to reveal new CDW character in underdoped\nBi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\\delta} (Bi2212). At low temperature, we observe dispersive\nexcitations from an incommensurate CDW that induces anomalously enhanced phonon\nintensity, unseen using other techniques. Near the pseudogap temperature T*,\nthe CDW persists, but the associated excitations significantly weaken and the\nCDW wavevector shifts, becoming nearly commensurate with a periodicity of four\nlattice constants. The dispersive CDW excitations, phonon anomaly, and\ntemperature dependent commensuration provide a comprehensive momentum space\npicture of complex CDW behavior and point to a closer relationship with the\npseudogap state.\n", "  Two recent publications report different boundaries for the dimerized phase\nof the bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 Heisenberg model with quadratic Zeeman\neffect. We address these discrepancies for the biquadratic model with quadratic\nZeeman term and explain the differences. Based on our numerical results the\nphase boundaries of the dimerized phase are determined.\n", "  The coupled spin tube system, which is equivalent to a stacked\nKagome-triangular spin system, exhibits the cuboc order -- a non-coplanar spin\norder with a twelve-sublattice structure accompanying spontaneous breaking of\nthe translational symmetry -- in the Kagome-triangular plane. On the basis of\nthe spin-wave theory, we analyze spin-wave excitations of the planar\nKagome-triangular spin system, where the geometric phase characteristic to the\ncuboc spin structure emerges. We further investigate spin-wave excitations and\ndynamical spin structure factors for the coupled spin tubes, assuming the\nstaggered cuboc order.\n", "  Inclusive jet production cross-sections are measured in proton--proton\ncollisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=$8 TeV recorded by the ATLAS\nexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The total integrated\nluminosity of the analysed data set amounts to $20.2$ fb$^{-1}$.\nDouble-differential cross-sections are measured for jets defined by the\nanti-$k_{t}$ jet clustering algorithm with radius parameters of $R=0.4$ and\n$R=0.6$ and are presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum, in the\nrange between 70 GeV and 2.5 TeV and in six bins of the absolute jet rapidity,\nbetween 0 and 3.0. The measured cross-sections are compared to predictions of\nquantum chromodynamics, calculated at next-to-leading order in perturbation\ntheory, and corrected for non-perturbative and electroweak effects. The level\nof agreement with predictions, using a selection of different parton\ndistribution functions for the proton, is quantified. Tensions between the data\nand the theory predictions are observed.\n", "  Ultralight scalar fields around spinning black holes can trigger superradiant\ninstabilities, forming a long-lived bosonic condensate outside the horizon. We\nuse numerical solutions of the perturbed field equations and astrophysical\nmodels of massive and stellar-mass black hole populations to compute, for the\nfirst time, the stochastic gravitational-wave background from these sources. In\noptimistic scenarios the background is observable by Advanced LIGO and LISA for\nfield masses $m_s$ in the range $\\sim [2\\times 10^{-13}, 10^{-12}]\\,{\\rm eV}$\nand $\\sim 5\\times[ 10^{-19}, 10^{-16}]\\,{\\rm eV}$, respectively, and it can\naffect the detectability of resolvable sources. Our estimates suggest that an\nanalysis of the stochastic background limits from LIGO O1 might already be used\nto marginally exclude axions with mass $\\sim 10^{-12.5}{\\rm eV}$. Semicoherent\nsearches with Advanced LIGO (LISA) should detect $\\sim 15~(5)$ to $200~(40)$\nresolvable sources for scalar field masses $3\\times 10^{-13}$ ($10^{-17}$) eV.\nLISA measurements of massive BH spins could either rule out bosons in the range\n$\\sim [10^{-18}, 2\\times 10^{-13}]$ eV, or measure $m_s$ with ten percent\naccuracy in the range $\\sim[10^{-17}, 10^{-13}]$ eV.\n", "  We study transport properties and the charge quantization phenomenon in a\nsmall metallic island connected to the leads through two quantum point contacts\n(QPCs). The linear conductance is calculated perturbatively with respect to\nweak tunneling and weak backscattering at QPCs as a function of the temperature\n$T$ and gate voltage. The conductance shows Coulomb blockade (CB) oscillations\nas a function of the gate voltage that decay with the temperature as a result\nof thermally activated fluctuations of the charge in the island. The regimes of\nquantum, $T \\ll E_C$, and thermal, $T \\gg E_C$, fluctuations are considered,\nwhere $E_C$ is the charging energy of an isolated island. Our predictions for\nCB oscillations in the quantum regime coincide with previous findings in [A.\nFurusaki and K. A. Matveev, Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 52}, 16676 (1995)]. In the\nthermal regime the visibility of Coulomb blockade oscillations decays with the\ntemperature as $\\sqrt{T/E_C}\\exp(-\\pi^2T/E_C)$, where the exponential\ndependence originates from the thermal averaging over the instant charge\nfluctuations, while the prefactor has a quantum origin. This dependence does\nnot depend on the strength of couplings to the leads. The differential\ncapacitance, calculated in the case of a single tunnel junction, shows the same\nexponential decay, however the prefactor is linear in the temperature. This\ndifference can be attributed to the non-locality of the quantum effects. Our\nresults agree with the recent experiment [S. Jezouin {\\em et al}., Nature {\\bf\n536}, 58 (2016)] in the whole range of the parameter $T/E_C$.\n", "  Ultralight bosons can induce superradiant instabilities in spinning black\nholes, tapping their rotational energy to trigger the growth of a bosonic\ncondensate. Possible observational imprints of these boson clouds include (i)\ndirect detection of the nearly monochromatic (resolvable or stochastic)\ngravitational waves emitted by the condensate, and (ii) statistically\nsignificant evidence for the formation of \"holes\" at large spins in the spin\nversus mass plane (sometimes also referred to as \"Regge plane\") of\nastrophysical black holes. In this work, we focus on the prospects of LISA and\nLIGO detecting or constraining scalars with mass in the range $m_s\\in\n[10^{-19},\\,10^{-15}]$ eV and $m_s\\in [10^{-14},\\,10^{-11}]$ eV, respectively.\nUsing astrophysical models of black-hole populations calibrated to observations\nand black-hole perturbation theory calculations of the gravitational emission,\nwe find that, in optimistic scenarios, LIGO could observe a stochastic\nbackground of gravitational radiation in the range $m_s\\in [2\\times 10^{-13},\n10^{-12}]$ eV, and up to $10^4$ resolvable events in a $4$-year search if\n$m_s\\sim 3\\times 10^{-13}\\,{\\rm eV}$. LISA could observe a stochastic\nbackground for boson masses in the range $m_s\\in [5\\times 10^{-19}, 5\\times\n10^{-16}]$, and up to $\\sim 10^3$ resolvable events in a $4$-year search if\n$m_s\\sim 10^{-17}\\,{\\rm eV}$. LISA could further measure spins for black-hole\nbinaries with component masses in the range $[10^3, 10^7]~M_\\odot$, which is\nnot probed by traditional spin-measurement techniques. A statistical analysis\nof the spin distribution of these binaries could either rule out scalar fields\nin the mass range $\\sim [4 \\times 10^{-18}, 10^{-14}]$ eV, or measure $m_s$\nwith ten percent accuracy if light scalars in the mass range $\\sim [10^{-17},\n10^{-13}]$ eV exist.\n", "  We consider a space with noncommutativity of coordinates and noncommutativity\nof momenta. It is shown that coordinates in noncommutative phase space depend\non mass therefore they can not be considered as kinematic variables. Also,\nnoncommutative momenta are not proportional to a mass as it has to be. We find\nconditions on the parameters of noncommutativity on which these problems are\nsolved. It is important that on the same conditions the weak equivalence\nprinciple is not violated, the properties of kinetic energy are recovered, and\nthe motion of the center-of-mass of composite system and relative motion are\nindependent in noncommutative phase space.\n", "  Monolayer two-dimensional transitional metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2,\nWS2 and WSe2, are direct band gap semiconductors with large exciton binding\nenergy. They attract growing attentions for opto-electronic applications\nincluding solar cells, photo-detectors, light-emitting diodes and\nphoto-transistors, capacitive energy storage, photodynamic cancer therapy and\nsensing on flexible platforms. While light-induced luminescence has been widely\nstudied, luminescence induced by injection of free electrons could promise\nanother important applications of these new materials. However,\ncathodoluminescence is inefficient due to the low cross-section of the\nelectron-hole creating process in the monolayers. Here for the first time we\nshow that cathodoluminescence of monolayer chalcogenide semiconductors can be\nevidently observed in a van der Waals heterostructure when the monolayer\nsemiconductor is sandwiched between layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\nwith higher energy gap. The emission intensity shows a strong dependence on the\nthicknesses of surrounding layers and the enhancement factor is more than 1000\nfolds. Strain-induced exciton peak shift in the suspended heterostructure is\nalso investigated by the cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Our results\ndemonstrate that MoS2, WS2 and WSe2 could be promising cathodoluminescent\nmaterials for applications in single-photon emitters, high-energy particle\ndetectors, transmission electron microscope displays, surface-conduction\nelectron-emitter and field emission display technologies.\n", "  Efficient charge separation at the interfaces between the perovskite and with\nthe carrier transport layers is crucial for perovskite solar cells to achieve\nhigh power conversion efficiency. We systematically investigate the hole\ninjection dynamics from MAPbI$_3$ perovskite to three typical hole transport\nmaterials (HTMs) PEDOT:PSS, PTAA and NiO$_x$ by means of pump-probe\ntransmission measurements. We photoexcite only near the MAPbI$_3$/HTM interface\nor near the back surface, and measure the differential transient transmission\nbetween the two excitation configurations to extract the carrier dynamics\ndirectly related to the hole injection. The differential transmission signals\ndirectly monitor the hole injections to PTAA and PEDOT:PSS being complete\nwithin 1 and 2 ps, respectively, and that to NiO$_x$ exhibiting an additional\nslow process of 40 ps time scale. The obtained injection dynamics are discussed\nin comparison with the device performance of the solar cells containing the\nsame MAPbI$_3$/HTM interfaces.\n", "  We consider classical, pure Yang-Mills theory in a box. We show how a set of\nstatic electric fields that solve the theory in an adiabatic limit correspond\nto geodesic motion on the space of vacua, equipped with a particular Riemannian\nmetric that we identify. The vacua are generated by spontaneously broken global\ngauge symmetries, leading to an infinite number of conserved momenta of the\ngeodesic motion. We show that these correspond to the soft multipole charges of\nYang-Mills theory.\n", "  A non-Clifford gate is required for universal quantum computation, and,\ntypically, this is the most error-prone and resource intensive logical\noperation on an error-correcting code. Small, single-qubit rotations are\npopular choices for this non-Clifford gate, but certain three-qubit gates, such\nas Toffoli or controlled-controlled-Z (CCZ), are equivalent options that are\nalso more suited for implementing some quantum algorithms, for instance those\nwith coherent classical subroutines. Here, we calculate error rates and\nresource overheads for implementing logical CCZ with pieceable fault-tolerance,\na non-transversal method for implementing logical gates. We provide a\ncomparison with a non-local magic-state scheme on a concatenated code and a\nlocal magic-state scheme on the surface code. We find the pieceable\nfault-tolerance scheme particularly advantaged over magic states on\nconcatenated codes and in certain regimes over magic states on the surface\ncode. Our results suggest that pieceable fault-tolerance is a promising\ncandidate for fault-tolerance in a near-future quantum computer.\n", "  We present a traveling wave model for a semiconductor diode laser based on\nquantum wells. The gain model is carefully derived from first principles and\nimplemented with as few phenomeno- logical constants as possible. The\ntransverse energies of the quantum well confined electrons are discretized to\nautomatically capture the effects of spectral and spatial hole burning, gain\nasym- metry, and the linewidth enhancement factor. We apply this model to\nsemiconductor optical amplifiers and single-section phase-locked lasers. We are\nable to reproduce the experimental re- sults. The calculated frequency\nmodulated comb shows potential to be a compact, chip-scale comb source without\nadditional external components.\n", "  We present a novel framework for addressing the nonlinear Landau collision\nintegral in terms of finite element and other subspace projection methods. We\nemploy the underlying metriplectic structure of the Landau collision integral\nand, using a Galerkin discretization for the velocity space, we transform the\ninfinite-dimensional system into a finite-dimensional, time-continuous\nmetriplectic system. Temporal discretization is accomplished using the concept\nof discrete gradients. The conservation of energy, momentum, and particle\ndensities, as well as the production of entropy is demonstrated algebraically\nfor the fully discrete system. Due to the generality of our approach, the\nconservation properties and the monotonic behavior of entropy are guaranteed\nfor finite element discretizations in general, independently of the mesh\nconfiguration.\n", "  We investigate genuinely entangled $N$-qubit states with no $N$-partite\ncorrelations in the case of symmetric states. Using a tensor representation for\nmixed symmetric states, we obtain a simple characterization of the absence of\n$N$-partite correlations. We show that symmetric states with no $N$-partite\ncorrelations cannot exist for an even number of qubits. We fully identify the\nset of genuinely entangled symmetric states with no $N$-partite correlations in\nthe case of three qubits, and in the case of rank-2 states. We present a\ngeneral procedure to construct families for an arbitrary odd number of qubits.\n", "  We observe the translational and rotational diffusion of dimer tracer\nparticles in quasi-2D colloidal samples. The dimers are in dense samples of two\ndifferent sizes of spherical colloidal particles, with the area fraction\n${\\phi}$ of the particles varying from dilute to nearly glassy. At low ${\\phi}$\nrotational and translational diffusion have a ratio set by the dimer size, as\nexpected. At higher ${\\phi}$ dimers become caged by their neighboring\nparticles, and both rotational and translational diffusion slow. For short\ndimers we observe rapid reorientations so that the rotational diffusion is\nfaster than translational diffusion: the two modes of diffusion are decoupled\nand have different ${\\phi}$ dependence. Longer dimers do not exhibit fast\nrotations, and we find translational and rotational diffusion stay coupled for\nall ${\\phi}$. Our results bridge prior results that used spheres (very fast\nrotation) and long ellipsoids (very slow rotation).\n", "  We explore a web of connections between quantum entanglement and knot theory\nby examining how topological entanglement entropy probes the braiding data of\nquasi-particles in Chern-Simons theory, mainly using $SU(2)$ gauge group as our\nworking example. The problem of determining the Renyi entropy is mapped to\ncomputing the expectation value of an auxiliary Wilson loop in $S^3$ for each\nbraid. We study various properties of this auxiliary Wilson loop for some\n2-strand and 3-strand braids, and demonstrate how they reflect some geometrical\nproperties of the underlying braids.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a novel method for generating\npropagation-invariant spatially-stationary fields in a controllable manner. Our\nmethod relies on producing incoherent mixtures of plane waves using planar\nprimary sources that are spatially completely uncorrelated. The strengths of\nthe individual plane waves in the mixture decide the exact functional form of\nthe generated coherence function. We use LEDs as the primary incoherent sources\nand experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating\nseveral spatially-stationary fields, including a new type, which we refer to as\nthe \"region-wise spatially-stationary field.\" We also experimentally\ndemonstrate the propagation-invariance of these fields, which is an extremely\ninteresting and useful property of such fields. Our work should have important\nimplications for applications that exploit the spatial coherence properties\neither in a transverse plane or in a propagation-invariant manner, such as\ncorrelation holography, wide-field OCT, and imaging through turbulence.\n", "  Recent lattice determinations of direct CP violation in kaon decays,\nparametrized by $\\epsilon'$, suggest a discrepancy of several sigma between\nexperiment and the standard model. Assuming that this situation is due to new\nphysics, we investigate a solution in terms of right-handed charged currents.\nChiral perturbation theory, in combination with lattice QCD results, allows one\nto accurately determine the effect of right-handed interactions on $\\epsilon'$.\nIn addition, similar techniques provide a direct link between the right-handed\ncontributions to $\\epsilon'$ and hadronic electric dipole moments. We\ndemonstrate that the $\\epsilon'$ discrepancy can be resolved with right-handed\ncharged currents, and that this scenario can be falsified by next-generation\nhadronic electric dipole moment experiments.\n", "  An $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet with\nnext-nearest-neighbor interactions is investigated under a magnetic field by\nthe numerical-diagonalization method. It is known that, in both cases of weak\nand strong next-nearest-neighbor interactions, this system reveals a\nmagnetization plateau at one-third of the saturated magnetization. We examine\nthe stability of this magnetization plateau when the amplitude of\nnext-nearest-neighbor interactions is varied. We find that a nonplateau region\nappears between the plateau phases in the cases of weak and strong\nnext-nearest-neighbor interactions.\n", "  We present new spectroscopy of the z=3.62 gravitationally lensed quasar\nB1422+117 from the Gemini North GMOS integral field spectrograph. We observe\nsignificant differential magnifications between the broad emission lines and\nthe continuum, as well as across the velocity structure of the Lyman-alpha\nline. We take advantage of this differential microlensing to algebraically\ndecompose the quasar spectrum into the absorbed broad emission line and\nabsorbed continuum components. We use the latter to derive the intrinsic\nLy-alpha forest absorption spectrum. The proximity effect is clearly detected,\nwith a proximity zone edge of 8.6-17.3 Mpc from the quasar, implying (perhaps\nintermittent) activity over at least 28 Myrs. The Ly-alpha line profile\nexhibits a blue excess that is inconsistent with a symmetric fit to the\nunabsorbed red side. This has important implications for the use of this\nfitting technique in estimating the absorbed blue Ly-alpha wings of\nGunn-Peterson trough quasars.\n", "  We present the design and construction of an NMR probe to investigate single\ncrystals under strain at cryogenic temperatures. The probe head incorporates a\npiezoelectric-based apparatus from Razorbill Instruments that enables both\ncompressive and tensile strain tuning up to strain values on the order of 0.3%\nwith a precision of 0.001%. $^{75}$As NMR in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ reveals large\nchanges to the electric field gradient, and indicates that the strain is\nhomogeneous to within 16% over the volume of the NMR coil.\n", "  We report on the growth of epitaxial Sr2RuO4 films using a hybrid molecular\nbeam epitaxy approach in which a volatile precursor containing RuO4 is used to\nsupply ruthenium and oxygen. The use of the precursor overcomes a number of\nissues encountered in traditional MBE that uses elemental metal sources.\nPhase-pure, epitaxial thin films of Sr2RuO4 are obtained. At high substrate\ntemperatures, growth proceeds in a layer-by-layer mode with intensity\noscillations observed in reflection high-energy electron diffraction. Films are\nof high structural quality, as documented by x-ray diffraction, atomic force\nmicroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The method should be suitable\nfor the growth of other complex oxides containing ruthenium, opening up\nopportunities to investigate thin films that host rich exotic ground states.\n", "  The Leidenfrost transition leads a boiling system to the boiling crisis, a\nstate in which the liquid loses contact with the heated surface due to\nexcessive vapor generation. Here, using experiments of liquid droplets boiling\non a heated surface, we report a new phenomenon, termed oscillating boiling, at\nthe Leidenfrost transition. We show that oscillating boiling results from the\ncompetition between two effects: separation of liquid from the heated surface\ndue to localized boiling, and rewetting. We argue theoretically that the\nLeidenfrost transition can be predicted based on its link with the oscillating\nboiling phenomenon, and verify the prediction experimentally for various\nliquids.\n", "  We present an atlas of starburst galaxy emission lines spanning 10 orders of\nmagnitude in ionizing flux and 7 orders of magnitude in hydrogen number\ndensity. Coupling SEDs from Starburst99 with photoionization calculations from\nCloudy, we track 96 emission lines from 977 {\\AA} to 205 m which are common to\nnebular regions, have been observed in H II regions, and serve as useful\ndiagnostic lines. Each simulation grid displays equivalent widths and contains\n~1.5x10$^4$ photoionization models calculated by supplying a spectral energy\ndistribution, chemical abundances, dust content, and gas metallicity (ranging\nfrom 0.2 Z$\\odot$ to 5.0 Z$\\odot$). Our simulations will prove useful in\nstarburst emission line data analysis, especially regarding local starburst\ngalaxies that show high ionization emission lines. One sample application of\nour atlas predicts that C IV $\\lambda$1549 will serve as a useful diagnostic\nemission line of vigorous star formation for coming James Webb Space Telescope\nobservations predicting a peak equivalent width of approximately 316 {\\AA}.\n", "  Direct laser excitation of the lowest known nuclear excited state in\n$^{229}$Th has been a longstanding objective. It is generally assumed that\nreaching this goal would require a considerably reduced uncertainty of the\nisomer's excitation energy compared to the presently adopted value of $(7.8\\pm\n0.5)$ eV. Here we present a direct laser excitation scheme for\n$^{229\\text{m}}$Th, which circumvents this requirement. The proposed excitation\nscheme makes use of already existing laser technology and therefore paves the\nway for nuclear laser spectroscopy. In this concept, the recently\nexperimentally observed internal-conversion decay channel of the isomeric state\nis used for probing the isomeric population. A signal-to-background ratio of\nbetter than $10^4$ and a total measurement time of less than three days for\nlaser scanning appear to be achievable.\n", "  Transition metal dichalcogenides have recently emerged as promising\ntwo-dimensional materials with intriguing electronic properties. Existing\ncalculations of intrinsic phonon-limited electronic transport so far have\nconcentrated on the semicondcucting members of this family. In this paper we\nextend these studies by investigating the influence of electron-phonon coupling\non the electronic transport properties and band renormalization of prototype\ninherent metallic bulk and monolayer TaS$_2$. Based on density functional\nperturbation theory and semi-classical Boltzmann transport calculations,\npromising room temperature mobilities and sheet conductances are found, which\ncan compete with other established 2D materials, leaving TaS$_2$ as promising\nmaterial candidate for transparent conductors or as atomically thin\ninterconnects. Throughout the paper, the electronic and transport properties of\nTaS$_2$ are compared to those of its isoelectronic counterpart TaSe$_2$ and\nadditional informations to the latter are given. We furthermore comment on the\nconventional su- perconductivity in TaS$_2$, where no phonon-mediated\nenhancement of TC in the monolayer compared to the bulk state was found.\n", "  In oxide materials, nanostructuring effect has been found very promising\napproach for the enhancement of \\textit{figure-of-merit}, \\textit{ZT}. In the\npresent work, we have synthesized La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) compound\nusing sol-gel method and samples of crystallite size of 34, 41, and 49 nm were\nobtained by giving different heat treatment. Seebeck coefficient ($\\alpha$),\nelectrical resistivity ($\\rho$), and thermal conductivity ($\\kappa$)\nmeasurements were carried out in 300-600 K temperature range. The systematic\nchange in the values of $\\alpha$ from $\\sim$ -19 $\\mu$V/K to $\\sim$ -24\n$\\mu$V/K and drastic reduction in the values of $\\kappa$ from $\\sim$0.88 W/mK\nto $\\sim$0.23 W/mK are observed as crystallite size is reduced from 49 nm to 34\nnm at $\\sim$600 K. Also, fall in the values of $\\rho$ in the paramagnetic (PM)\ninsulator phase (400-600 K) are effectively responsible for the increasing\ntrend in the values of \\textit{ZT} at high temperature. For the crystallite\nsize of 41 nm, value of \\textit{ZT} at 600 K was found to be $\\sim$0.017, which\ncan be further increased up to $\\sim$0.045 around 650 K temperature. The\npredicted value of \\textit{ZT} suggests that LSMO can be suitable oxide\nmaterial for thermoelectric applications at high temperature.\n", "  Local interactions, when individuals meet, can regulate collective behavior.\nIn a system without any central control, the rate of interaction may depend\nsimply on how the individuals move around. But interactions could in turn\ninfluence movement; individuals might seek out interactions, or their movement\nin response to interaction could influence further interaction rates. We\ndevelop a general framework to address these questions, using collision theory\nto establish a baseline expected rate of interaction based on proximity. We\ntest the models using data from harvester ant colonies. A colony uses feedback\nfrom interactions inside the nest to regulate foraging activity. Potential\nforagers leave the nest in response to interactions with returning foragers\nwith food. The time series of interactions and local density of ants show how\ndensity hotspots lead to interactions that are clustered in time. A correlated\nrandom walk null model describes the mixing of potential and returning\nforagers. A model from collision theory relates walking speed and spatial\nproximity with the probability of interaction. The results demonstrate that\nalthough ants do not mix homogeneously, trends in interaction patterns can be\nexplained simply by the walking speed and local density of surrounding ants.\n", "  The perovskite SrIrO3 is an exotic narrow-band metal owing to a confluence of\nthe strengths of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the electron-electron\ncorrelations. It has been proposed that topological and magnetic insulating\nphases can be achieved by tuning the SOC, Hubbard interactions, and/or lattice\nsymmetry. Here, we report that the substitution of nonmagnetic, isovalent Sn4+\nfor Ir4+ in the SrIr1-xSnxO3 perovskites synthesized under high pressure leads\nto a metal-insulator transition to an antiferromagnetic (AF) phase at TN > 225\nK. The continuous change of the cell volume as detected by x-ray diffraction\nand the lamda-shape transition of the specific heat on cooling through TN\ndemonstrate that the metal-insulator transition is of second-order. Neutron\npowder diffraction results indicate that the Sn substitution enlarges an\noctahedral-site distortion that reduces the SOC relative to the spin-spin\nexchange interaction and results in the type-G AF spin ordering below TN.\nMeasurement of high-temperature magnetic susceptibility shows the evolution of\nmagnetic coupling in the paramagnetic phase typical of weak itinerant-electron\nmagnetism in the Sn-substituted samples. A reduced structural symmetry in the\nmagnetically ordered phase leads to an electron gap opening at the Brillouin\nzone boundary below TN in the same way as proposed by Slater.\n", "  The discovery of intriguing properties related to the Dirac states in\ngraphene has spurred huge interest in exploring its two-dimensional group-IV\ncounterparts, such as silicene, germanene, and stanene. However, these\nmaterials have to be obtained via synthesizing on substrates with strong\ninterfacial interactions, which usually destroy their intrinsic\n$\\pi$($p_z$)-orbital Dirac states. Here we report a theoretical study on the\nexistence of Dirac states arising from the $p_{x,y}$ orbitals instead of $p_z$\norbitals in silicene on 4H-SiC(0001), which survive in spite of the strong\ninterfacial interactions. We also show that the exchange field together with\nthe spin-orbital coupling give rise to a detectable band gap of 1.3 meV. Berry\ncurvature calculations demonstrate the nontrivial topological nature of such\nDirac states with a Chern number $C = 2$, presenting the potential of realizing\nquantum anomalous Hall effect for silicene on SiC(0001). Finally, we construct\na minimal effective model to capture the low-energy physics of this system.\nThis finding is expected to be also applicable to germanene and stanene, and\nimply great application potentials in nanoelectronics.\n", "  The study and quantification of UV photon-induced desorption of frozen\nmolecules furthers our understanding of the chemical evolution of cold\ninterstellar regions. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important intermediate species in\nboth gas-phase and solid-phase chemical networks. In this work, we present\nquantitative measurements of the photodesorption of a pure NO ice.We used the\ntunable monochromatic synchrotron light of the DESIRS beamline of the SOLEIL\nfacility near Paris to irradiate NO ices in the 6 - 13.6 eV range and measured\ndesorption by quadrupole mass spectrometry.We find that NO photodesorption is\nvery efficient, its yield being around 1e-2 molecule per incident photon for UV\nfields relevant to the diffuse and dense interstellar medium. We discuss the\nextrapolation of our results to an astrophysical context and we compare\nphotodesorption of NO to previously studied molecules.\n", "  Magnetic systems with spins sitting on a lattice of corner sharing regular\ntetrahedra have been particularly prolific for the discovery of new magnetic\nstates for the last two decades. The pyrochlore compounds have offered the\nplayground for these studies, while little attention has been comparatively\ndevoted to other compounds where the rare earth R occupies the same\nsub-lattice, e.g. the spinel chalcogenides CdR2X4 (X = S, Se). Here we report\nmeasurements performed on powder samples of this series with R = Yb using\nspecific heat, magnetic susceptibility, neutron diffraction and\nmuon-spin-relaxation measurements. The two compounds are found to be\nmagnetically similar. They long-range order into structures described by the\n\\Gamma_5 irreducible representation. The magnitude of the magnetic moment at\nlow temperature is 0.77 (1) and 0.62 (1) mu_B for X = S and Se, respectively.\nPersistent spin dynamics is present in the ordered states. The spontaneous\nfield at the muon site is anomalously small, suggesting magnetic moment\nfragmentation. A double spin-flip tunneling relaxation mechanism is suggested\nin the cooperative paramagnetic state up to 10 K. The magnetic space groups\ninto which magnetic moments of systems of corner-sharing regular tetrahedra\norder are provided for a number of insulating compounds characterized by null\npropagation wavevectors.\n", "  We study the theory of Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria in one spatial dimension, as\nwell as its application to current sheet and flux tube models. The 'inverse\nproblem' is that of determining a Vlasov-Maxwell equilibrium distribution\nfunction self-consistent with a given magnetic field. We develop the theory of\ninversion using expansions in Hermite polynomials of the canonical momenta.\nSufficient conditions for the convergence of a Hermite expansion are found,\ngiven a pressure tensor. For large classes of DFs, we prove that non-negativity\nof the distribution function is contingent on the magnetisation of the plasma,\nand make conjectures for all classes.\n  The inverse problem is considered for nonlinear 'force-free Harris sheets'.\nBy applying the Hermite method, we construct new models that can describe\nsub-unity values of the plasma beta $(\\beta_{pl})$ for the first time. Whilst\nanalytical convergence is proven for all $\\beta_{pl}$, numerical convergence is\nattained for $\\beta_{pl}= 0.85$, and then $\\beta_{pl} = 0.05$ after a\n're-gauging' process.\n  We consider the properties that a pressure tensor must satisfy to be\nconsistent with 'asymmetric Harris sheets', and construct new examples. It is\npossible to analytically solve the inverse problem in some cases, others must\nbe tackled numerically. We present new exact Vlasov-Maxwell equilibria for\nasymmetric current sheets, which can be written as a sum of shifted Maxwellian\ndistributions, ideal for implementations in particle-in-cell simulations.\n  We study the correspondence between the microscopic and macroscopic\ndescriptions of equilibrium in cylindrical geometry, and then attempt to find\nVlasov-Maxwell equilibria for the nonlinear force-free 'Gold-Hoyle' model.\nHowever, it is necessary to include a background field, which can be\narbitrarily weak if desired. The equilibrium can be electrically non-neutral,\ndepending on the bulk flows.\n", "  We investigate the effects of modular and temporal connectivity patterns on\nepidemic spreading. To this end, we introduce and analytically characterise a\nmodel of time-varying networks with tunable modularity. Within this framework,\nwe study the epidemic size of Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, SIR, models and\nthe epidemic threshold of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible, SIS, models.\nInterestingly, we find that while the presence of tightly connected clusters\ninhibit SIR processes, it speeds up SIS diseases. In this case, we observe that\nheterogeneous temporal connectivity patterns and modular structures induce a\nreduction of the threshold with respect to time-varying networks without\ncommunities. We confirm the theoretical results by means of extensive numerical\nsimulations both on synthetic graphs as well as on a real modular and temporal\nnetwork.\n", "  (21) Lutetia has been visited by Rosetta mission on July 2010 and observed\nwith a phase angle ranging from 0.15 to 156.8 degrees. The Baetica region,\nlocated at the north pole has been extensively observed by OSIRIS cameras\nsystem. Baetica encompass a region called North Pole Crater Cluster (NPCC),\nshows a cluster of superposed craters which presents signs of variegation at\nthe small phase angle images. For studying the location, we used 187 images\ndistributed throughout 14 filter recorded by the NAC (Narrow Angle Camera) and\nWAC (Wide Angle Camera) taken during the fly-by. We photometrically modeled the\nregion using Minnaert disk-function and Akimov phase function to finally\nreconstruct a resolved spectral slope map at 5 and 20 degrees of phase angle.\nWe observed a dichotomy between Gallicum and Danuvius-Sarnus Labes in the NPCC,\nbut no significant phase reddening. In the next step, we applied the Hapke\n(2008, 2012) model for the NAC F82+F22 (649.2 nm), WAC F13 (375 nm) and WAC F17\n(631.6 nm), enabling us to compose the normal albedo and Hapke parameter maps\nfor NAC F82+F22. On Baetica, the 649 nm global properties are: geometric albedo\nof 0.205+-0.005, the average single-scattering albedo of 0.181+-0.005, the\naverage asymmetric factor of -0.342+-0.003, the average shadow-hiding\nopposition effect amplitude and width respectivelly of 0.824+-0.002 and\n0.040+-0.0007, the average roughness slope of 11.45+-3 deg. and the average\nporosity is 85+-0.2%. In the NPCC, the normal albedo variegation among the\ncraters walls reach 8% brighter for Gallicum Labes and 2% fainter for Danuvius\nLabes. The Hapke parameter maps also show a dichotomy at the opposition effect\ncoefficients, single-scattering albedo and asymmetric factor, that may be\nattributed to the maturation degree of the regolith or to compositonal\nvariation.\n", "  We develop a powerful tree tensor network states method that is capable of\nsimulating exciton-phonon quantum dynamics of larger molecular complexes and\nopen quantum systems with multiple bosonic environments. We interface this\nmethod with ab initio density functional theory to study singlet exciton\nfission (SF) in a pentacene dimer. With access to the full vibronic many-body\nwave function, we track and assign the contributions of different symmetry\nclasses of vibrations to SF and derive energy surfaces, enabling us to dissect,\nunderstand, and describe the strongly coupled electronic and vibrational\ndynamics, relaxation, and reduced state cooling. This directly exposes the rich\npossibilities of exploiting the functional interplay of molecular symmetry,\nelectronic structure and vibrational dynamics in SF material design. The\ndescribed method can be similarly applied to other complex (bio-) molecular\nsystems, characterised by a rich manifold of electronic states and vibronic\ncoupling driving non-adiabatic dynamics.\n", "  On social networks, while nodes bear rich attributes, we often lack the\n`semantics' of why each link is formed-- and thus we are missing the `road\nsigns' to navigate and organize the complex social universe. How to identify\nrelationship semantics without labels? Founded on the prevalent homophily\nprinciple, we propose the novel problem of Attribute-based Relationship\nProfiling (ARP), to profile the closeness w.r.t. the underlying relationships\n(e.g., schoolmate) between users based on their similarity in the corresponding\nattributes (e.g., education) and, as output, learn a set of social affinity\ngraphs, where each link is weighted by its probabilities of carrying the\nrelationships. As requirements, ARP should be systematic and complete to\nprofile every link for every relationship-- our challenges lie in effectively\nmodeling homophily. We propose a novel reverse smoothness principle by\nobserving that the similarity-closeness duality of homophily is consistent with\nthe well-known smoothness assumption in graph-based semi-supervised learning--\nonly the direction of inference is reversed. To realize smoothness over noisy\nsocial graphs, we further propose a novel holistic closeness modeling approach\nto capture `high-order' smoothness by extending closeness from edges to paths.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of\nARP.\n", "  Galaxy clusters, employed by Zwicky to demonstrate the existence of dark\nmatter, pose new stringent tests. If merging clusters demonstrate that dark\nmatter is self-interacting with cross section $\\sigma/m\\sim 2$ cm$^2$/gr,\nMACHOs, primordial black holes and light axions that build MACHOs are ruled out\nas cluster dark matter. Recent strong lensing and X-ray gas data of the quite\nrelaxed and quite spherical cluster A1835 allow to test the cases of dark\nmatter with Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distribution, next\nto Navarro-Frenck-White profiles. Fits to all these profiles are formally\nrejected at over $5\\sigma$, except in the fermionic situation. The\ninterpretation in terms of (nearly) Dirac neutrinos with mass of\n$1.61^{+0.19}_{-0.30}$ eV/$c^2$ is consistent with results on the cluster\nA1689, with the WMAP, Planck and DES dark matter fractions and with the\nnondetection of neutrinoless double $\\beta$-decay. The case will be tested in\nthe 2018 KATRIN experiment.\n", "  We provide a framework to describe all local-realistic theories and all\nno-signalling operational theories. We show that when the dynamics is\nreversible, these two concepts are equivalent. In particular, this implies that\nunitary quantum theory can be given a local-realistic model.\n", "  Multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE) has been a prevalent tool to quantify the\ncomplexity of time series. However, it is extremely sensitive to the\npredetermined parameters and length of time series and it may yield an\ninaccurate estimation of entropy or cause undefined entropy when the length of\ntime series is too short. In this paper the Sigmoid-based refined composite\nmultiscale fuzzy entropy (SRCMFE) is introduced to improve the robustness of\ncomplexity measurement of MFE for short time series analysis. Also SRCMFE is\nused to quantify the dynamical properties of mechanical vibration signals and\nbased on that a new rolling bearing fault diagnosis approach is proposed by\ncombining SRCMFE with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) for\nfeature dimension and variable predictive models based class discrimination\n(VPMCD) for mode classification. In the proposed method, SRCMFE firstly is\nemployed to extract the complexity characteristic from vibration signals of\nrolling bearing and t-SNE for feature dimension reduction is utilized to obtain\na low dimensional manifold characteristic. Then VPMCD is employed to construct\na multi-fault classifier to fulfill an automatic fault diagnosis. Finally, the\nproposed approach is applied to experimental data of rolling bearing and the\nresults indicate that the proposed method can effectively distinguish different\nfault categories of rolling bearings.\n", "  In this work, we analyze the free expansion of Bose-Einstein condensates\ncontaining multicharged vortices. The atomic cloud is initially confined in a\nthree-dimensional asymmetric harmonic trap. We apply both approximate\nvariational solutions and numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. The data obtained provide a way to establish the presence as well as\nthe multiplicity of vortices based only on the properties of the expanded cloud\nwhich can be obtained via time-of-flight measurements. In addition, several\nfeatures such as the evolution of the vortex core size and the asymptotic\nvelocity during free expansion were studied considering the atomic cloud as\nbeing released from different harmonic trap configurations.\n", "  The measurement of a reaction cross section from a pulse height spectrum is a\nubiquitous problem in experimental nuclear physics. In $\\gamma$-ray\nspectroscopy, this is accomplished frequently by measuring the intensity of\nfull-energy primary transition peaks and correcting the intensities for\nexperimental artifacts, such as detection efficiencies and angular\ncorrelations. Implicit in this procedure is the assumption that full-energy\npeaks do not overlap with any secondary peaks, escape peaks, or environmental\nbackgrounds. However, for complex $\\gamma$-ray cascades, this is often not the\ncase. Furthermore, this technique is difficult to adapt for coincidence\nspectroscopy, where intensities depend not only on the detection efficiency,\nbut also the detailed decay scheme. We present a method that incorporates the\nintensities of the entire spectrum (e.g., primary and secondary transition\npeaks, escape peaks, Compton continua, etc.) into a statistical model, where\nthe transition intensities and branching ratios can be determined using\nBayesian statistical inference. This new method provides an elegant solution to\nthe difficulties associated with analyzing coincidence spectra. We describe it\nin detail and examine its efficacy in the analysis of\n$^{18}$O(p,$\\gamma$)$^{19}$F and $^{25}$Mg(p,$\\gamma$)$^{26}$Al resonance data.\nFor the $^{18}$O(p,$\\gamma$)$^{19}$F reaction, the measured branching ratios\nimprove upon the literature values, with a factor of 4 reduction in the\nuncertainties.\n", "  Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media disclose the peculiarities of electrodynamics\nin the limit of infinite wavelength but non-zero frequency for experiments and\napplications. Theory suggests that wave interaction with obstacles and\ndisturbances dramatically changes in this domain. To investigate the optics of\nthose effects we fabricated a nanostructured 2D optical ENZ multilayer\nwaveguide that is probed with wavelength-tuned laser light via a nanoscale wave\nlaunch configuration. In this experimental framework we directly optically\nmeasure wave propagation and diffraction in a realistic system with the level\nand scale of imperfection that is typical in nanooptics. As we scan the\nwavelength from 1.0 $\\mu$m to 1.7 $\\mu$m, we approach the ENZ regime, and\nobserve the interference pattern of a micro-scale Young's double slit to\nsteeply diverge. By evaluating multiple diffraction orders we experimentally\ndetermine the effective refractive index $n_{eff}$ and its zero-crossing as an\nintrinsic measured reference, which is in agreement with theoretical\npredictions. We further verify that the double-slit and specifically placed\nscattering objects become gradually invisible when approaching the ENZ regime.\nWe also observe that light-matter-interaction intensifies towards ENZ and\nquantify how speckle noise, caused by tiny random imperfections, increasingly\ndominates the optical response and blue-shifts the cut-off frequency.\n", "  Students from statistically underrepresented minority (URM) groups and women\nearn a smaller fraction of undergraduate and graduate degrees in most physical\nsciences, particularly physics. This underrepresentation is also prevalent at\nthe faculty level and in higher administration roles at most physics\ndepartments, universities, and national laboratories. This proceedings\nsummarizes a presentation that presented statistics on participation in\nphysical sciences, and discussed the outcomes of initiatives such as Bridge\nPrograms which aim to improve diversity in physics graduate programs.\n", "  Eccentricity is an important orbital parameter. Understanding its effect on\nplanetary climate and habitability is critical for us to search for a habitable\nworld beyond our solar system. The orbital configurations of M-dwarf planets\nare always tidally-locked at resonance states, which are quite different from\nthose around Sun-like stars. M-dwarf planets need to be investigated\nseparately. Here we use a comprehensive three-dimensional atmospheric general\ncirculation model to systematically investigate how eccentricity influences\nclimate and habitability of M-dwarf exoplanets. The simulation results show\nthat (1) the seasonal climatic cycles of such planets are very weak even for e\n= 0.4. It is unlikely that an aqua planet falls out of a habitable zone during\nits orbit. (2) The annual global mean surface temperature significantly\nincreases with increased eccentricity, due to the decrease of the cloud albedo.\nBoth the runaway greenhouse inner edge and moist greenhouse inner edge shift\noutward. (3) Planets in an eccentric orbit can be captured in other spin-orbit\nresonance states which lead to different climate patterns, namely eyeball\npattern and striped-ball pattern.The striped-ball pattern has evidently higher\nsurface temperatures due to the reduced planetary albedo. Near the outer edge,\nplanets with p = 1.0 and 2.0 are more resistant to the snowball state due to\nmore locally-concentrated stellar fluxes. Thus, planets with integer spin-orbit\nresonance numbers have wider habitable zones than those with half-integer\nspin-orbit resonance states. Above all, as a comparison to circular orbit,\neccentricity shrinks the width of the habitable zone.\n", "  We have performed a search for the K$^{0}_{L} \\rightarrow\n\\pi^{0}\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ decay with the KOTO detector at J-PARC. The KOTO detector\nwas designed to observe the decay and measure its branching ratio (BR).\nFocusing on this golden decay in quark flavor physics provides an ideal\ncandidate to probe for physics beyond the standard model (BSM). The established\nexperimental upper limit of the branching ratio was set by the KEK E391a\ncollaboration at 2.6 x 10$^{-8}$. This is still well above the standard model\nvalue of the branching ratio, which is predicted to be 2.43 x 10$^{-11}$ with\nminor uncertainties. The important signal is a pair of photons from the\n$\\pi^{0}$ decay and no coincident signals from veto counters. This along with a\nlarge discernible transverse momentum provides us with unique signature. KOTO\nuses a Cesium Iodide (CsI) electromagnetic calorimeter as the main photon\ndetector and hermetic veto counters to ensure that there are no other de-\ntected particles. This proceeding summarizes a presentation that discussed\nachievements, improvements to the detector, detailed the current analysis\nstatus for 2015 data, and future prospects.\n", "  We consider topological insulators and superconductors with discrete\nsymmetries and clarify the relevant index theory behind the periodic table\nproposed by Kitaev.\n  An effective Hamiltonian determines the analytical index, which can be\ncomputed by a topological index. We focus on the spatial dimensions one, two\nand three, and only consider the bulk theory.\n  In two dimensions, the $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued invariants are given by the first\nChern number. Meanwhile, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariants can be computed by\nthe odd topological index and its variations.\n  The Bott-Kitaev periodic table is well-known in the physics literature, we\norganize the topological invariants in the framework of KR-theory.\n", "  In the inverse problem of the calculus of variations one is asked to find a\nLagrangian and a multiplier so that a given differential equation, after\nmultiplying with the multiplier, becomes the Euler--Lagrange equation for the\nLagrangian. An answer to this problem for the case of a scalar ordinary\ndifferential equation of order $2n, n\\geq 2,$ is proposed.\n", "  We develop a theory to probe the effect of non-equilibrium\nfluctuation-induced forces on the size of a polymer confined between two\nhorizontal thermally conductive plates subject to a constant temperature\ngradient, $\\nabla T$. We assume that (a) the solvent is good and (b) the\ndistance between the plates is large so that in the absence of a thermal\ngradient the polymer is a coil whose size scales with the number of monomers as\n$N^{\\nu}$, with $\\nu \\approx 0.6$. We predict that above a critical temperature\ngradient, $\\nabla T_c \\sim N^{-\\frac{5}{4}}$, favorable attractive\nmonomer-monomer interaction due to Giant Casimir Force (GCF) overcomes the\nchain conformational entropy, resulting in a coil-globule transition. The\nlong-ranged GCF-induced interactions between monomers, arising from thermal\nfluctuations in non-equilibrium steady state, depend on the thermodynamic\nproperties of the fluid. Our predictions can be verified using light-scattering\nexperiments with polymers, such as polystyrene or polyisoprene in organic\nsolvents (neopentane) in which GCF is attractive.\n", "  In this article we show the duality between tensor networks and undirected\ngraphical models with discrete variables. We study tensor networks on\nhypergraphs, which we call tensor hypernetworks. We show that the tensor\nhypernetwork on a hypergraph exactly corresponds to the graphical model given\nby the dual hypergraph. We translate various notions under duality. For\nexample, marginalization in a graphical model is dual to contraction in the\ntensor network. Algorithms also translate under duality. We show that belief\npropagation corresponds to a known algorithm for tensor network contraction.\nThis article is a reminder that the research areas of graphical models and\ntensor networks can benefit from interaction.\n", "  We study nondiffusive thermal transport by phonons at small distances within\nthe framework of the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) and demonstrate that\nthe transport is significantly affected by the distribution of phonons emitted\nby the source. We discuss analytical solutions of the steady-state BTE for a\nsource with a sinusoidal spatial profile, as well as for a three- dimensional\nGaussian hot spot, and provide numerical results for single crystal silicon at\nroom temperature. If a micro/nanoscale heat source produces a thermal phonon\ndistribution, it gets hotter than predicted by the heat diffusion equation;\nhowever, if the source predominantly produces low-frequency acoustic phonons\nwith long mean free paths, it may get significantly cooler than predicted by\nthe heat equation, yielding an enhanced heat transport.\n", "  Electrolyte gating is widely used to induce large carrier density modulation\non solid surfaces to explore various properties. Most of past works have\nattributed the charge modulation to electrostatic field effect. However, some\nrecent reports have argued that the electrolyte gating effect in VO2, TiO2 and\nSrTiO3 originated from field-induced oxygen vacancy formation. This gives rise\nto a controversy about the gating mechanism, and it is therefore vital to\nreveal the relationship between the role of electrolyte gating and the\nintrinsic properties of materials. Here, we report entirely different\nmechanisms of electrolyte gating on two high-Tc cuprates, NdBa2Cu3O7-{\\delta}\n(NBCO) and Pr2-xCexCuO4 (PCCO), with different crystal structures. We show that\nfield-induced oxygen vacancy formation in CuO chains of NBCO plays the dominant\nrole while it is mainly an electrostatic field effect in the case of PCCO. The\npossible reason is that NBCO has mobile oxygen in CuO chains while PCCO does\nnot. Our study helps clarify the controversy relating to the mechanism of\nelectrolyte gating, leading to a better understanding of the role of oxygen\nelectro migration which is very material specific.\n", "  The issue of a recurrence of the modulationally unstable water wave trains\nwithin the framework of the fully nonlinear potential Euler equations is\naddressed. It is examined, in particular, if a modulation which appears from\nnowhere (i.e., is infinitesimal initially) and generates a rogue wave which\nthen disappears with no trace. If so, this wave solution would be a breather\nsolution of the primitive hydrodynamic equations. It is shown with the help of\nthe fully nonlinear numerical simulation that when a rogue wave occurs from a\nuniform Stokes wave train, it excites other waves which have different lengths,\nwhat prevents the complete recurrence and, eventually, results in a\nquasi-periodic breathing of the wave envelope. Meanwhile the discovered effects\nare rather small in magnitude, and the period of the modulation breathing may\nbe thousands of the dominant wave periods. Thus, the obtained solution may be\ncalled a quasi-breather of the Euler equations.\n", "  We have investigated the combined effect of low-energy self-implantation and\nthermal annealing on the near-surface defect concentration of ZnO\nsingle-crystals. Using ionoluminescence (IL), we demonstrate that a combination\nof low-energy low-fluence Zn and O ion implantation followed by annealing in Ar\nincreases the near-surface point defect concentration in ZnO by two orders of\nmagnitude. Point defects are known to increase the surface reactivity of ZnO,\nthereby improving the efficiency of ZnO photocatalytic processes such as\nbilirubin degredation. We hereby provide recommendations on how to improve the\nefficiency of ZnO-related photocatalytic processes.\n", "  The Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) plus proton-neutron quasiparticle random\nphase approximation (pnQRPA) approach based on Skyrme interaction is applied to\nstudy the nuclear $\\beta^+$/EC decay for nuclei near the proton magic numbers\n$Z=$20, 28, and 50. With properly selected Skyrme interactions that include the\ntensor terms, and the $T=0$ pairing interaction, the experimental $\\beta^+$/EC\ndecay half-lives of these nuclei can be systematically reproduced quite well.\nIt is shown that the tensor and $T=0$ pairing interactions play different roles\nin different nuclei. The specific effect is relevant to the configurations that\ncontribute to the decay. The attractive and repulsive properties of tensor\ninteraction for the GT state is also studied. The present results indicate that\nit works repulsively on the GT states dominated by the configurations from $\\pi\nj_\\gtrless$ to $\\nu j_\\gtrless$ orbits, while working attractively for those\nmainly composed of the configurations from $\\pi j_\\gtrless$ to $\\nu j_\\lessgtr$\norbits.\n", "  We consider the existence and stability of solitons in a $\\chi^{(2)}$\ncoupler. Both the fundamental and second harmonics undergo gain in one of the\ncoupler cores and are absorbed in the other one. The gain and losses are\nbalanced creating a parity-time (${\\cal PT}$) symmetric configuration. We\npresent two types of families of ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric solitons, having equal\nand different profiles of the fundamental and second harmonics. It is shown\nthat gain and losses can stabilize solitons. Interaction of stable solitons is\nshown. In the cascading limit the model is reduced to the ${\\cal PT}$-symmetric\ncoupler with effective Kerr-type nonlinearity and balanced nonlinear gain and\nlosses.\n", "  Based on the problem of quantum data compression in a lossless way, we\npresent here an operational interpretation for the family of quantum R\\'enyi\nentropies. In order to do this, we appeal to a very general quantum encoding\nscheme that satisfies a quantum version of the Kraft-McMillan inequality. Then,\nin the standard situation, where one is intended to minimize the usual average\nlength of the quantum codewords, we recover the known results, namely that the\nvon Neumann entropy of the source bounds the average length of the optimal\ncodes. Otherwise, we show that by invoking an exponential average length,\nrelated to an exponential penalization over large codewords, the quantum\nR\\'enyi entropies arise as the natural quantities relating the optimal encoding\nschemes with the source description, playing an analogous role to that of von\nNeumann entropy.\n", "  The photonic framework offers clues leading to a possible update of the\nfoundations of quantum mechanics yet preserving its mathematical grounds.\nReconsideration of quantum theoretic measurement theory warrants removal of\nideological prejudices brought in by von Neumann Copenhagen interpretation.\nConditions required to bridge abstract to laboratory space formulations of QM\npermit underscoring fundamental differences to the standard view; entanglement\nand sustainment concepts help in this task. Entanglement events integrate\nprobing devices leading to q-measurements seen as physical processes.\nRepresentation elements based on classical physics pictures are removed. A\nnon-representational framework stands up as a result.\n", "  Harmonic maps from Riemann surfaces arise from a conformally invariant\nvariational problem. Therefore, on one hand, they are intimately connected with\nmoduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, and on the other hand, because the conformal\ngroup is noncompact, constitute a prototype for the formation of singularities,\nthe so-called bubbles, in geometric analysis. In theoretical physics, they\narise from the nonlinear $\\sigma$-model of quantum field theory. That model\npossesses a supersymmetric extension, coupling a harmonic map like field with a\nnonlinear spinor field. In the physical model, that spinor field is\nanticommuting. In this contribution, we analyze both a mathematical version\nwith a commuting spinor field and the original supersymmetric version.\nMoreover, this model gives rise to a further field, a gravitino, that can be\nseen as the supersymmetric partner of a Riemann surface metric. Altogether,\nthis leads to a beautiful combination of concepts from quantum field theory,\nstructures from Riemannian geometry and Riemann surface theory, and methods of\nnonlinear geometric analysis.\n", "  This paper presents an efficient parallel method for the deterministic\nsolution of the 3D stationary Boltzmann transport equation applied to diffusive\nproblems such as nuclear core criticality computations. Based on standard\nMultiGroup-Sn-DD discretization schemes, our approach combines a highly\nefficient nested parallelization strategy with the Piecewise Diffusion\nSynthetic Acceleration (PDSA) parallel technique applied for the first time to\n3D transport problems. These two key ingredients enable us to solve extremely\nlarge neutronic problems involving up to $10^{12}$ degrees of freedom in less\nthan an hour using 64 super-computer nodes.\n", "  The modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory of the restricted primitive model\ndouble layer is revisited and recast in a fresh, slightly broader perspective.\nDerivation of relevant equations follow the techniques utilized in the earlier\nMPB4 and MPB5 formulations and clarifies the relationship between these. The\nMPB4, MPB5, and a new formulation of the theory are employed in an analysis of\nthe structure and charge reversal phenomenon in asymmetric 2:1/1:2 valence\nelectrolytes. Furthermore, polarization induced surface charge amplification is\nstudied in 3:1/1:3 systems. The results are compared to the corresponding Monte\nCarlo simulations. The theories are seen to predict the \"exact\" simulation data\nto varying degrees of accuracy ranging from qualitative to almost quantitative.\nThe results from a new version of the theory are found to be of comparable\naccuracy as the MPB5 results in many situations. However, in some cases\ninvolving low electrolyte concentrations, theoretical artifacts in the form of\nun-physical \"shoulders\" in the singlet ionic distribution functions are\nobserved.\n", "  Fire protection mainly takes place through physical or chemical pathways or\nboth of them. The thermal diffusivity is one of the basic thermophysical\nproperties which can connect the chemical structure. It is well-known in the\nliterature that there exist relationships between the thermal diffusivity and\nthe thermal stability. Also, the thermal diffusivity can be related to some\nfire retardant properties such as total-heat-release (THR), time-to-ignition\n(TTI) and peak-heat-rare-release (PHRR) that are of the most important\nparameters in the evaluation of potential fire hazard of a given material.\nMetal oxides, as one of the most promising flame retardant additives, improve\nthe fire-retardant and the thermal stability properties of polymers. In the\npresent study, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on the united atom\nmodel are utilized to study the effect of alumina nanoparticles on the thermal\ndiffusivity of isotactic Polymethyl methacrylate (is-PMMA) polymer.\n", "  We present a stochastic CA modelling approach of corrosion based on spatially\nseparated electrochemical half-reactions, diffusion, acido-basic neutralization\nin solution and passive properties of the oxide layers. Starting from different\ninitial conditions, a single framework allows one to describe generalised\ncorrosion, localised corrosion, reactive and passive surfaces, including\noccluded corrosion phenomena as well. Spontaneous spatial separation of anodic\nand cathodic zones is associated with bare metal and passivated metal on the\nsurface. This separation is also related to local acidification of the\nsolution. This spontaneous change is associated with a much faster corrosion\nrate. Material morphology is closely related to corrosion kinetics, which can\nbe used for technological applications.\n", "  We introduce a stochastic lattice model to investigate the effects of pore\nformation in a passive layer grown with products of metal corrosion. It\nconsiders that an anionic species diffuses across that layer and reacts at the\ncorrosion front (metal-oxide interface), producing a random distribution of\ncompact regions and large pores, respectively represented by O (oxide) and P\n(pore) sites. O sites are assumed to have very small pores, so that the\nfraction $\\Phi$ of P sites is an estimate of the porosity, and the ratio\nbetween anion diffusion coefficients in those regions is $D_{\\text r}<1$.\nSimulation results without the large pores ($\\Phi =0$) are similar to those of\na formerly studied model of corrosion and passivation and are explained by a\nscaling approach. If $\\Phi >0$ and $D_{\\text r}\\ll 1$, significant changes are\nobserved in passive layer growth and corrosion front roughness. For small\n$\\Phi$, a slowdown of the growth rate is observed, which is interpreted as a\nconsequence of the confinement of anions in isolated pores for long times.\nHowever, the presence of large pores near the corrosion front increases the\nfrequency of reactions at those regions, which leads to an increase in the\nroughness of that front. This model may be a first step to represent defects in\na passive layer which favor pitting corrosion.\n", "  In the present work, the formation of silver and copper nanostructures on\nhighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) modified with self-assembled gold\nnanoparticles (Au NPs) is demonstrated. Surface patterning with nanometer\nresolution was achieved. Different methods such as field emission scanning\nelectron microscopy (FEGSEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to illustrate a selective deposition\nof silver and copper on Au NPs. The mechanism of silver and copper ions\nreduction on Au NP with $n$-dodecanethiol coating is discussed.\n", "  In this paper we have explored the role of valence fluctuations in an\nextended Anderson impurity model (e-SIAM) in which there is an additional\nHubbard repulsion between conduction and impurity electrons, employing\nperturbative renormalization methods. We have calculated the scaling equations\nfor the model parameters and solved them both analytically and numerically to\nfind how valence fluctuations renormalize these parameters. Analytical\nsolutions of the scaling equations yielded scaling invariants of the model\nwhich we find to be different than the Anderson impurity model signifying\ndifferent kind of scaling trajectories of e-SIAM. The strong coupling physics\nof SIAM is known to be governed by spin fluctuations and we hence analysed how\nthe strong coupling regime of e-SIAM is renormalized by valence fluctuations.\nDoing a third order perturbative renormalization of the model gave us access to\nthe Kondo scale. We not only confirmed that valence fluctuations enhance the\nKondo scale but we also calculated the functional form of this dependence.\nBenchmarking some of our results with numerical renormalization group\ncalculations, we found excellent agreement. Applying Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we found that the strong coupling regime of the model is\ngoverned by spin-charge Kondo model unlike the Anderson impurity model. Our\nresults suggest that spin Kondo effect can co-exist with valence fluctuation\nmediated charge Kondo effect.\n", "  The novelty of the Jean Pierre Badiali last scientific works stems to a\nquantum approach based on both (i) a return to the notion of trajectories\n(Feynman paths) and (ii) an irreversibility of the quantum transitions. These\niconoclastic choices find again the Hilbertian and the von Neumann algebraic\npoint of view by dealing statistics over loops. This approach confers an\nexternal thermodynamic origin to the notion of a quantum unit of time (Rovelli\nConnes' thermal time). This notion, basis for quantization, appears herein as a\nmere criterion of parting between the quantum regime and the thermodynamic\nregime. The purpose of this note is to unfold the content of the last five\nyears of scientific exchanges aiming to link in a coherent scheme the Jean\nPierre's choices and works, and the works of the authors of this note based on\nhyperbolic geodesics and the associated role of Riemann zeta functions. While\nthese options do not unveil any contradictions, nevertheless they give birth to\nan intrinsic arrow of time different from the thermal time. The question of the\nphysical meaning of Riemann hypothesis as the basis of quantum mechanics, which\nwas at the heart of our last exchanges, is the backbone of this note.\n", "  This work is concerned with the minimization of quantum entropies under local\nconstraints of density, current, and energy. The problem arises in the work of\nDegond and Ringhofer about the derivation of quantum hydrodynamical models from\nfirst principles, and is an adaptation to the quantum setting of the moment\nclosure strategy by entropy minimization encountered in kinetic equations. The\nmain mathematical difficulty is the lack of compactness needed to recover the\nenergy constraint. We circumvent this issue by a monotonicity argument\ninvolving energy, temperature and entropy, that is inspired by some\nthermodynamical considerations.\n", "  We present the second Multi-Epoch X-ray Serendipitous AGN Sample (MEXSAS2),\nextracted from the 6th release of the XMM Serendipitous Source Catalogue\n(XMMSSC-DR6), cross-matched with Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar catalogues\nDR7Q and DR12Q. Our sample also includes the available measurements for masses,\nbolometric luminosities, and Eddington ratios. Analyses of the ensemble\nstructure function and spectral variability are presented, together with their\ndependences on such parameters. We confirm a decrease of the structure function\nwith the X-ray luminosity, and find a weak dependence on the black hole mass.\nWe introduce a new spectral variability estimator, taking errors on both fluxes\nand spectral indices into account. We confirm an ensemble softer when brighter\ntrend, with no dependence of such estimator on black hole mass, Eddington\nratio, redshift, X-ray and bolometric luminosity.\n", "  Moment tensor inversion is conducted to characterize the source properties of\nthe September 3, M6.3, the September 3, M4.6, and the September 23, M3.4\nseismic events occurred in 2017 in the nuclear test site of DPRK. To overcome\nthe difficulties in the comparison, the inversion uses the same stations, the\nsame structural model, the same algorithm, and nearly the same filters in the\nprocessing of waveforms. It is shown that the M6.3 event is with predominant\nexplosion component, the M4.6 event is with predominant implosion component,\nwhile the M3.4 event is with a predominant double couple component (~74%) and a\nsecondary explosion component (~25%). The three seismic events are with a\nsimilar centroid depth. The double couple component of the M3.4 event shows a\nnormal fault striking northeastward.\n", "  The missing piece in the jigsaw of silicon photonics is a light source that\ncan be easily incorporated into the standard silicon fabrication process.\nRecent advances in the development of atomically thin layers of semiconducting\ntransition metal dichalogenides (TMDs), with direct bandgaps in the\nnear-infrared region, have opened up new possibilities for addressing this\nneed. Here, we report a unique silicon laser source that employs molybdenum\nditelluride (MoTe2) as a gain material in a photonic crystal nanocavity\nresonator, fabricated in silicon-on-insulator. We demonstrate optically pumped\nMoTe2-on-silicon devices lasing at 1305 nm, i.e. in the centre of the O-band\nused in optical communications, operating in the continuous-wave (CW) regime,\nat room temperature and with a threshold power density as low as 1.5 kW/cm2.\nThis 2D-on-silicon geometry offers the promise of an integrated low-cost\nelectrically pumped nanoscale silicon light source, thereby adding an essential\nbuilding block to the silicon photonics platform.\n", "  We present results of a new analysis campaign, which combines the final data\nsamples collected by the B factory experiments BABAR and Belle in single\nphysics analyses to achieve a unique sensitivity in time-dependent \\CP\\\nviolation measurements. The data samples contain $(471 \\pm 3) \\times 10^6 ~B\n\\bar B$ pairs recorded by the BABAR detector and $(772 \\pm 11) \\times 10^6 ~ B\n\\bar B$ pairs recorded by the Belle detector in $e^+e^-$ collisions at the\ncenter-of-mass energies corresponding to the mass of the $\\Upsilon(4S)$\nresonance at the asymmetric-energy $B$ factories PEP-II at SLAC and KEKB at\nKEK, respectively. We present a measurement of $\\sin 2\\beta $ and $\\cos 2\\beta\n$ by a time-dependent Dalitz plot analysis of $B^0 \\to D^{(*)} h^0$ with $D \\to\nK^0_S \\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays. A first evidence for $\\cos 2\\beta >0$, the exclusion\nof trigonometric multifold solutions of the Unitarity Triangle and an\nobservation of \\CP\\ violation are reported.\n", "  We built a 8um selected sample of galaxies in the NEP-AKARI field by defining\n4 redshift bins with the four AKARI bands at 11, 15, 18 and 24 microns\n(0.15<z<0.49, 0.75<z<1.34, 1.34<z<1.7 and 1.7<z<2.05) . Our sample contains\n4079 sources, 599 are securely detected with Herschel/PACS. Also adding\nultraviolet (UV) data from GALEX, we fit the spectral energy distributions\nusing the physically motivated code CIGALE to extract the star formation rate,\nstellar mass, dust attenuation and the AGN contribution to the total infrared\nluminosity (L_{IR}). We discuss the impact of the adopted attenuation curve and\nthat of the wavelength coverage to estimate these physical parameters. We focus\non galaxies with a luminosity close the characteristic L_{IR}^* in the\ndifferent redshift bins to study the evolution with redshift of the dust\nattenuation in these galaxies.\n", "  A cellular automaton is presented whose governing rule is that the Kolmogorov\ncomplexity of a cell's neighborhood may not increase when the cell's present\nvalue is substituted for its future value. Using an approximation of this\ntwo-dimensional Kolmogorov complexity the underlying automaton is shown to be\ncapable of simulating logic circuits. It is also shown to capture trianry logic\ndescribed by a quandle, a non-associative algebraic structure. A similar\nautomaton whose rule permits at times the increase of a cell's neighborhood\ncomplexity is shown to produce animated entities which can be used as\ninformation carriers akin to gliders in Conway's game of life.\n", "  We test the $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ sigma models for the Painlev\\'e property.\nWhile the construction of finite action solutions ensures their meromorphicity,\nthe general case requires testing. The test is performed for the equations in\nthe homogeneous variables, with their first component normalised to one. No\nconstraints are imposed on the dimensionality of the model or the values of the\ninitial exponents. This makes the test nontrivial, as the number of equations\nand dependent variables are indefinite. A $\\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ system proves to\nhave a $(4N-5)$-parameter family of solutions whose movable singularities are\nonly poles, while the order of the investigated system is $4N-4$. The remaining\ndegree of freedom, connected with an extra negative resonance, may correspond\nto a branching movable essential singularity. An example of such a solution is\nprovided.\n", "  Edelmann (2003) identified two chemically peculiar hot subdwarfs, PG 0909+276\nand UVO 0512-08, as having very high overabundances of iron-group elements. We\nobtained high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopy in order to measure\nabundances of species not observable in the optical, and to seek evidence for\nchemical stratification in the photosphere. Abundances were measured in three\nwavelength regions; the optical 3900\\AA-6900\\AA\\ range was re-analysed to\nconfirm consistency with Edelmann. Ultraviolet spectra were obtained with the\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST), covering the far-UV (1140\\AA-1740\\AA) and the near-UV (1740\\AA-2500\\AA).\nWe computed a grid of theoretical LTE spectra to find basic parameters\n(effective temperatures, surface gravity, surface hydrogen and helium\nfractions). We measured abundances using a spectral-synthesis approach in each\nwavelength range. We confirm that several iron-group metals are highly\nenriched, including cobalt, copper and zinc, relative to typical sdB stars. We\ndetect gallium, germanium, tin, and lead, similar to analysis of ultraviolet\nspectra of some other sdB stars. Our results confirm that PG 0909+276 and UVO\n0512-08 exhibit peculiarities which make them distinct from both the normal\nH-rich sdB and intermediate He-rich sdB stars. The process which leads to this\nparticular composition has still to be identified.\n", "  Literature mentions only incidentally a sub-Doppler contribution in the\nexcitation spectrum of the backward fluorescence of a dense vapor. This\ncontribution is here investigated on Cs vapor, both on the first resonance line\n(894 nm) and on the weaker second resonance line (459 nm). We show that in a\nstrongly absorbing medium, the quenching of excited atoms moving towards a\nwindow irradiated under near normal incidence reduces the fluorescence on the\nred side of the excitation spectrum. Atoms moving slowly towards the window\nproduce a sub- Doppler velocity-selective contribution, whose visibility is\nhere improved by applying a frequency-modulation technique. This sub-Doppler\nfeature, induced by a surface quenching combined with a short absorption length\nfor the incident irradiation, exhibits close analogies with the narrow spectra\nappearing with thin vapor cells. We also show that a normal incidence\nirradiation is essential for the sub-Doppler feature to be observed, while it\nshould be independent of the detection geometry\n", "  Manipulation of intrinsic magnetic and electronic structures of graphene\nnanoflakes is of technological importance. Here we carry out systematic study\nof the magnetic and electronic phases, and its manipulation in graphene\nnanoflakes employing first-principles calculation. We illustrate the intricate\nshape and size dependence on the magnetic and electronic properties, and\nfurther investigate the effects of carrier doping, which could be tuned by gate\nvoltage. A transition from nonmagnetic to magnetic phase is observed at a\ncritical flake size for the flakes without sublattice imbalance, which we\nidentify to be originated from the armchair defect at the junctions of two\nsublattices on the edge. Electron, or hole doping simultaneously influences the\nmagnetic and electronic structures, and triggers phase changes. Beyond a\ncritical doping, crossover from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase is\nobserved for the flakes without sublattice imbalance, while suppression of\nmagnetism, and a possible crossover from magnetic to nonmagnetic phase is\nobserved for flakes with sublattice imbalance. Simultaneous to magnetic phase\nchanges, a semiconductor to (half) metal transition is observed, upon carrier\ndoping.\n", "  The production of heavy flavor quark pairs, including top-anti-top, at the\nLHC proceeds primarily through gluon fusion. The correlation between the gluon\nspins affects various spin correlations between the produced quark and\nanti-quark. Both single spin asymmetries and double correlations of the quark\npair spins will be manifest in the subsequent hadronization and decay\ndistributions. For top pairs this is most pronounced. Dilepton, single lepton,\nand purely hadronic top pair decay channels allow for the extraction of gluon\nspin information as well as providing a window into possible interactions\nBeyond the Standard Model. Spin related asymmetries and polarizations will be\npresented. The implications for experimental determination will be discussed.\n", "  In atomic multi-level systems, adiabatic elimination is a method used to\nminimize complicity of the system by eliminating irrelevant and strongly\ncoupled levels by detuning them from one-another. Such a three-level system,\nfor instance, can be mapped onto physical in form of a three-waveguide system.\nActively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes\nallows modulating light propagating through the device, as proposed here. The\nouter waveguides act as an effective two- photonic-mode system similar to\nground- and excited states of a three-level atomic system, whilst the center\nwaveguide is partially plasmonic. In adiabatic elimination regime, the\namplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster in comparison to the\nouter waveguides leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the middle\nwaveguide becomes a dark state and hence a low insertion-loss of 8 decibel is\nexpected to keep when achieving the modulation depth as high as 70 decibel\ndespite the involvement of a plasmonic waveguide in the design presented here.\nThe modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a\ncritical coupling regime to adiabatic elimination condition via\nelectrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration and hence the optical\nindex of a thin ITO layer residing in the plasmonic center waveguide. This\nalters the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus\nmodulation in each of outer waveguides. Our results show a modulator energy\nefficiency as low as 40 atto-joule per bit and an extinction ratio of 50\ndecibel. Given the minuscule footprint of the modulator, the resulting\nlumped-element limited RC delay is expected to exceed 200 giga hertz. This type\nof modulator paves the way for next-generation both energy-and speed conscience\noptical short-reach interconnects.\n", "  We present a deep neural network for a model-free prediction of a chaotic\ndynamical system from noisy observations. The proposed deep learning model aims\nto predict the conditional probability distribution of a state variable. The\nLong Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is employed to model the nonlinear\ndynamics and a softmax layer is used to approximate a probability distribution.\nThe LSTM model is trained by minimizing a regularized cross-entropy function.\nThe LSTM model is validated against delay-time chaotic dynamical systems,\nMackey-Glass and Ikeda equations. It is shown that the present LSTM makes a\ngood prediction of the nonlinear dynamics by effectively filtering out the\nnoise. It is found that the prediction uncertainty of a multiple-step forecast\nof the LSTM model is not a monotonic function of time; the predicted standard\ndeviation may increase or decrease dynamically in time.\n", "  Due to some current interest in this subject we have produced this note.\nThere is no claim to anything new, except possibly to show that a direct\nnumerical approach is quite simple and instructive. For comparison purposes we\ninclude a section on the Coulomb Klein-Gordon equation.\n", "  We present a photometric $J$-band variability study of GU Psc b, a T3.5\nco-moving planetary-mass companion (9-13$M_{\\rm{Jup}}$) to a young ($\\sim$150\nMyr) M3 member of the AB Doradus Moving Group. The large separation between GU\nPsc b and its host star (42\") provides a rare opportunity to study the\nphotometric variability of a planetary-mass companion. The study presented here\nis based on observations obtained from 2013 to 2014 over three nights with\ndurations of 5-6 hr each with the WIRCam imager at Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope. Photometric variability with a peak-to-peak amplitude of $4\\pm1$% at\na timescale of $\\sim$6 hr was marginally detected on 2014 October 11. No\nhigh-significance variability was detected on 2013 December 22 and 2014 October\n10. The amplitude and timescale of the variability seen here, as well as its\nevolving nature, is comparable to what was observed for a variety of field T\ndwarfs and suggests that mechanisms invoked to explain brown dwarf variability\nmay be applicable to low-gravity objects such as GU Psc b. Rotation-induced\nphotometric variability due to the formation and dissipation of atmospheric\nfeatures such as clouds is a plausible hypothesis for the tentative variation\ndetected here. Additional photometric measurements, particularly on longer\ntimescales, will be required to confirm and characterize the variability of GU\nPsc b, determine its periodicity and to potentially measure its rotation\nperiod.\n", "  We present the results of a direct-imaging survey for very large separation\n($>$100 au), companions around 95 nearby young K5-L5 stars and brown dwarfs.\nThey are high-likelihood candidates or confirmed members of the young\n($\\lessapprox$150 Myr) $\\beta$ Pictoris and AB Doradus moving groups (ABDMG)\nand the TW Hya, Tucana-Horologium, Columba, Carina, and Argus associations.\nImages in $i'$ and $z'$ filters were obtained with the Gemini Multi-Object\nSpectrograph (GMOS) on Gemini South to search for companions down to an\napparent magnitude of $z'\\sim$22-24 at separations $\\gtrapprox$20\" from the\ntargets and in the remainder of the wide 5.5' $\\times$ 5.5' GMOS field of view.\nThis allowed us to probe the most distant region where planetary-mass\ncompanions could be gravitationally bound to the targets. This region was left\nlargely unstudied by past high-contrast imaging surveys, which probed much\ncloser-in separations. This survey led to the discovery of a planetary-mass\n(9-13 $\\,M_{\\rm{Jup}}$) companion at 2000 au from the M3V star GU Psc, a highly\nprobable member of ABDMG. No other substellar companions were identified. These\nresults allowed us to constrain the frequency of distant planetary-mass\ncompanions (5-13 $\\,M_{\\rm{Jup}}$) to 0.84$_{-0.66}^{+6.73}$% (95% confidence)\nat semimajor axes between 500 and 5000 au around young K5-L5 stars and brown\ndwarfs. This is consistent with other studies suggesting that gravitationally\nbound planetary-mass companions at wide separations from low-mass stars are\nrelatively rare.\n", "  We develop an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to classify simulated\nsignals corrsponding to the semi-classical description of Bloch oscillations in\npristine graphene. After the ANN is properly trained, we consider the inverse\nproblem of Bloch oscillations (BO),namely, a new signal is classified according\nto the external electric field strength oriented along either the zig-zag or\narm-chair edges of the graphene membrane, with a correct classification that\nranges from 82.6% to 99.3% depending on the accuracy of the predicted electric\nfield. This approach can be improved depending on the time spent in training\nthe network and the computational power available. Findings in this work can be\nstraightforwardly extended to a variety of Dirac-Weyl materials.\n", "  We initiate a series of works where we study the interior of dynamical\nrotating vacuum black holes without symmetry. In the present paper, we take up\nthe problem starting from appropriate Cauchy data for the Einstein vacuum\nequations defined on a hypersurface already within the black hole interior,\nrepresenting the expected geometry just inside the event horizon. We prove that\nfor all such data, the maximal Cauchy evolution can be extended across a\nnon-trivial piece of Cauchy horizon as a Lorentzian manifold with continuous\nmetric. In subsequent work, we will retrieve our assumptions on data assuming\nonly that the black hole event horizon geometry suitably asymptotes to a\nrotating Kerr solution. In particular, if the exterior region of the Kerr\nfamily is proven to be dynamically stable---as is widely expected---then it\nwill follow that the $C^0$-inextendibility formulation of Penrose's celebrated\nstrong cosmic censorship conjecture is in fact false. The proof suggests,\nhowever, that the $C^0$-metric Cauchy horizons thus arising are generically\nsingular in an essential way, representing so-called \"weak null singularities\",\nand thus that a revised version of strong cosmic censorship holds.\n", "  We study Ollivier-Ricci curvature, a discrete version of Ricci curvature,\nwhich has gained popularity over the past several years and has found\napplications in diverse fields. However, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature requires\nan optimal mass transport problem to be solved, which can be computationally\nexpensive for large networks. In view of this, we propose two alternative\nmeasures of curvature to Ollivier-Ricci which are motivated by the Jaccard\ncoefficient and are demonstrably less computationally intensive, a cheaper\nJaccard (JC) and a more expensive generalized Jaccard (gJC) curvature metric.\nWe show theoretically that the gJC closely matches the Ollivier-Ricci curvature\nfor Erdos-Renyi graphs in the asymptotic regime of large networks. Furthermore,\nwe study the goodness of approximation between the proposed curvature metrics\nand Ollivier-Ricci curvature for several network models and real networks. Our\nresults suggest that in comparison to an alternative curvature metric for\ngraphs, the Forman-Ricci curvature, the gJC exhibits a reasonably good fit to\nthe Ollivier-Ricci curvature for a wide range of networks, while the JC is\nshown to be a good proxy only for certain scenarios.\n"]}
